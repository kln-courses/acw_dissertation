<plain_text><page sequence="1">(Dis)figuring the System: Vision, History, and Trauma in Blake's Lambeth Books TILOTTAMA RAJAN TW ) riting in 1986 Stephen Leo Carr referred to "the still common as- sumption that an essentially homogeneous (noncontradictory) 'sys- tem' or 'myth' underlies Blake's art, guaranteeing that each illuminated book is finally a performance of the same, a marginal deviation or derivation from some ur-text or 'vision' . . . to be recuperated by reading each Blakean text in the context of all others."' Since the conference "Blake and Criticism," held in Santa Cruz, California, in 1982, we have been more inclined to privilege the resistances to homogeneity previously marginalized by Blake crit- icism. One such challenge to the structures stubbornly constructed by Northrop Frye and S. Foster Damon had already been provided in 1980 by Leopold Damrosch, who saw the tradition Blake inherited as a "nest of problems," and therefore saw the system as mobilized precisely by the contradictions it struggled endlessly to "reconcile."2 More common now than this use of "Mental Fight" to defer but protect the system is its replacement by a logic of absolute difference in which the Blakean text exists only in its performances, as a transformational narrative surface, or in terms of a writerly rather than readerly textuality.3 As much as the system, absolute difference protects the economy of literature and the self-satisfaction it affords the critic. As Steven Goldsmith points out with ref- erence to current Blake studies, there is a strange symbiosis between poststruc- turalism and representative democracy: the culture in which every voice is heard, and differences are consumed and satisfied in a unifying pluralism.4 As Jane Gallop points out more generally, the death of the author becomes all too easily 1.

At the heart of the system completed in Jerusalem is an alignment between space and time that first becomes an issue because of the two media that make up Blake's composite art, and for which the illuminated book as the apocalyptic (en)closure of history through art serves as a material trope. In this essay, however, the completed sys- tem and its icon, the Book as Logos, will provide no more than a starting point. Instead I shall explore the (dis)figuration of the system at its first site of emer- gence in the Lambeth books, where Blake attempts to arrange world history mythopoeically, or rather to work (out) the system through the materiality of his- tory. The difficulty he has in doing so is apparent in two areas. To begin with, the verbal and visual components of three of the Lambeth poems- The (First) Book of Urizen, The Book ofAhania, and The Book ofLos-are conspicuously disjoined. This separation points to a radical disturbance of an aesthetic economy in which time and space form a circle, such that vision is realized in time, but time is then gathered up into an ahistorical space. Secondly, the three major poems in the group (Europe, America, and Urizen) are prefaced by preludia or proems. Rather than read these works mimetically or dramatically, as adumbrating or performing the system,7 we are therefore called on to read them reflexively, as texts that are configured within the scene of their own writing. This does not mean that the Lambeth books are examples (like Milton) of what Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe and Jean-Luc Nancy call the literary absolute, in which the deconstruction of authorial authority is recovered within "the model 5.

I am using this word in quotation marks to refer to its technical philosophical signification in Husserlian phenomenology, where it denotes a "bracketing" of the natural standpoint, or more generally of compli- cating elements that interfere with grasping the essential structures of consciousness. 7. Northrop Frye and S. Foster Damon provide obvious examples of work that assumes in the "system" a constative level of myth that precedes and guarantees prophetic utterance. The alternative view of prophecy as "performative" is introduced by Leslie Tannenbaum, who argues with reference to eighteenth-century theories of prophecy that Blake's work is rhetorical and oratorical rather than mimetic (Biblical Tradition in Blakes Early Prophecies: The Great Code ofArt [Princeton, N.J., 1982], 25-54). More recently, Angela Esterhammer approaches the visionary performativity of Blake's texts from the perspective of speech-act theory in Creating States: Studies in the Performative Language ofJohn Milton and William Blake (Toronto, 1994). My own account of "nomadic textuality" in the second section of this paper attributes a more anarchic form of performativity to a limited group of Blake's texts. 384 ^ TILOTTAMA RAJAN</page><page sequence="3">VISION, HISTORY, AND TRAUMA IN BLAKE'S LAMBETH BOOKS of the subject-work creating itself."8 Rather, these texts are caught in the impos- sibility of their own writing, as a process in which Blake articulates, cancels, and (dis)figures the system that he can produce only in and as its abjected parts.9 In Europe and America this disfiguration is thematized and confined within the pre- ludia, allowing the prophecies at least some performative existence apart from it. Along with the supplementary Song of Los, these poems comprise the first group of Lambeth books. But in the second group, consisting of Urizen, Ahania; and The Book of Los (none of which refers to itself as a prophecy), the scene of writ- ing extends throughout the entire text. For the texts in question move forward only with enormous difficulty, and indeed are about the difficulty of their writ- ing. In the earlier and later Lambeth books, Blake seems to be accumulating the raw material for a system: the "mythemes" and "gross constituent units," as Levi- Strauss describes them. But this material has yet to be processed aesthetically or psychically, and the Lambeth books are the process of trying to give it structural articulation by shaping it into a narrative leading to organized innocence. Moreover, the process of shaping-later figured in Milton as Milton sculpt- ing the image of Urizen (Milton 20:8-10, E 114)-is full of false starts, provok- ing the bard in America to break his harp (America 2:18-20, E 52).10 Thus in Ahania, Urizen's disk takes ten years to make and is then countered by the "fiery beam" of Fuzon, which wanders the earth for five hundred years before Los "siez[es]" it and gives it a shape (Ahania, 2:44-8, E 85). The shaping of force into form is a recurrent concern of these texts, as it also is in Shelley's last texts, where the imagination forms a revolutionary vision out of the ethereality of a shape all light or out of a materiality without form or outline. But in Ahania it is not clear what Los makes out of the beam of Fuzon in hammering it back into the body 8.

Barnard and Lester (Albany, N.Y., 1988), xvi; see also 5. 9. I borrow the terms "abject" and "abjection" from Julia Kristeva's Powers of Horror: An Essay on Abjection, trans. Leon Roudiez (New York, 1982). Briefly, Kristeva defines the abject as that which does not fit, and that therefore produces a sense of dis-ease in the body of the Kantian, or Cartesian, subject. Associated with phenomena that lack boundaries, and thus with the confusion of subject and object or inside and outside, it threatens the power of (self)definition, and must therefore be cast out for predication to occur. The very term confuses grammatical boundaries, functioning as subject, object, and verb. "Abjection" or ("to abject") indicates, from the point of view of the subject, the violent expulsion of what is constructed as other. But the "abject" also refers to what is cast out. Finally, "abjection" also refers to a feeling not dissimilar to what Coleridge calls dejection, which follows the casting out of the self as other. 10.

Likewise Urizen's body takes seven ages to emerge, figuring the aeons it takes Los as prophetic imagination to hammer out a form for world history. And when that body is complete we are only at the beginning of a narrative that is continued in Ahania, itself to be discontinued when the desire figured in Fuzon amounts to nothing. Able to invent names for entities without distinct characteristics and energies without shape, Blake cannot do anything with them, so that the slowing down of historical time also figures the "abjection"-the unusable negativity-that haunts his writing.'1 For the system at this stage is disorganized, emerging in bits and pieces like Urizen's body. This body is figured as a corps morcele that has yet to be hammered into imaginary or symbolic totality, and in which the parts emerge out of sequence and disjoined from any larger whole: spine first, then brain and heart entangled with each other, then over four ages the senses, and fi- nally the limbs. Likewise Blake works on his myth in overlapping segments, which are like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that do not fit together. In Europe, he works on a genealogy of the female will as prime cause behind the nightmare of history. But he puzzlingly depicts Enitharmon as asleep during the damage she brings about, as though like Milton she may have a "real, immortal" self that stands apart from her shadow or her spectre (Milton 15:1-17, E 109). In Urizen, Enitharmon plays a minor role, and Blake turns to a male power who frustrat- ingly exceeds his characterization as reason and his role as villain. In America, Blake deals with revolutionary change, but in Urizen he retreats to an onto- psychic analysis of what makes change impossible, thus leaving open the question of whether his characters are forces in the theater of public events or spectres in a dialogue of the mind with itself. And finally in The Song of Los, he gestures to- 11. The concept of unusable negativity, in the particular form I employ it here, derives from Maurice Blanchot, who reconceives negativity in terms radically different from those of Hegel. Whereas Hegel sees negativity as an antithetical stimulus to the generation of new positions, and thus puts it to use within the dialectic (generating progression through contraries, in Blakean terms), Blanchot explores a form of negativity that cannot be "re-economized" or put to work. Through his notions of worklessness (desouevrement) and death, Blanchot theorizes a depressive form of negativity significantly different from the more energetic version of unusable negativity developed by his colleague Georges Bataille, through the notion of a heterogeneity or surplus that cannot be absorbed back into the restricted economy of Hegelian dialectic. Blanchot's version of unusable negativity thus anticipates Kristeva's interest in abjection and melancholia.

Lydia Davis (Barrytown, N.Y., 1981), 21-78, as well as The Space of Literature, trans. Ann Smock (Lincoln, Nebr., 1982), 85-160, and 163-70. TILOTTAMA RAJAN 386 -</page><page sequence="5">VISION, HISTORY, AND TRAUMA IN BLAKE'S LAMBETH BOOKS ward a world-historical frame for his previous texts but is able to produce it only as two disjoined fragments. The difficulty Blake has in articulating his system has much to do with his relationship to history (a term that I am not using in a Marxist way, since events for Blake are not simply social or cultural but are intergenerated with ontologi- cal issues and collective traumas). Writing in the 1790s, Blake does not have the apocalyptic privilege of disengaging himself from events, both past and present. As is suggested by the tormented family romances that traverse these texts, his- tory is the scene of the system's psychoanalysis, an unconscious or radical alter- ity inseparable from its prehistory in trauma. Struggling to reduce this otherness to symbolic form, the later Blake, as both Damrosch and Lorraine Clark point out, replaces the dialectical with the apocalyptic. He "cast[s] off" what is threat- ening by defining "the qualities he dislikes ... as Satanic" and thus "external to the self."12 Crucial to this turn is Blake's retrieval of negation13 as a category he can use to abject difficult or traumatic material-or more precisely his displace- ment of the term negation, which no longer describes a binary and limited epis- temic mode but rather names the substance or state that he wants to exclude (Milton 40:33-34, E 142). The consequence is the system: a master narrative with its own regulatory symbolism, and thus also a Symbolic order in Lacan's sense of the term (see n. 28 below). Constantly threatened by what it has ab- jected-like the masquerades of Jean Genet's Balcony-Blake's Symbolic order can maintain itself only through an elaborate apparatus of classes and levels in which the self, as Damrosch puts it, is "distribut[ed] among different levels of re- ality,"14 so that the "real" Milton can remain in Eden while his vegetable body exists in Ulro. The mode that constructs this separation between levels of reality, so as to protect them from mixing with each other, is "Sublime Allegory" (E 730) as de- veloped within the fourfold scheme of Christian theology. As an apparatus of lev- els, allegory is a kind of schizophrenia:15 a form in which pneuma is separated 12. Lorraine Clark, Blake, Kierkegaard, and the Spectre of Dialectic (Cambridge, 1991), 4; Damrosch, Symbol and Truth, 179, 154. Damrosch sees this development as unfortunate (p. 154), whereas Clark valorizes it as a turn "from a Hegelian 'both-and' dialectic ... to something very like a Kierkegaardian 'either/or"' in which the Spectral or Satanic must be purged entirely (pp. 2, 5). 13. Clark, The Spectre of Dialectic, 3; Damrosch, Symbol and Truth, 181. 14. Damrosch further points out that the later Blake distinguishes a hylic, a psychic, and a pneumatic self (Symbol and Truth, 155). 15.

The dominant figure of the Lambeth books is by contrast cat- achresis, a figure in which tenor and vehicle cannot be separated, the vehicle seem- ing at times to be its tenor. One example is the extended description of Urizen's body, in chapter IV(b) of The (First) Book of Urizen, in which the body is config- ured simultaneously with the seven ages and the four points of the compass. Here the literalism of the figure is such that figure and ground cannot be differentiated: Urizen's sleeping body cannot be made a mere metaphor for the nightmare of his- tory, because as figure he usurps the ground he is supposed to represent, becoming in some sense the Real, which can be grasped only as its traumatic figuration. I shall return to the disfigurative effects of catachresis and other condensations that block the work of systematization. Suffice it to say here that allegory is the figure of separation as well as of the exegetical translation of matter into spirit; catachre- sis, by contrast, is the figure of unreadability: it is the form taken by what Julia Kristeva calls the abject, as the state in which spirit remains glued to matter, like Los to Urizen. In abjection, which is a pre-thetic rather than synthetic identity, things cannot be separated and predication cannot occur because subject and ob- ject are confused, as are inside and outside, spirit and body.16 Catachresis is the rhetorical form of abjection, because it jams together phenomena that cannot be seen in the same space and confuses the figural and literal aspects of metaphor. In a text such as Urizen, catachresis blocks vision (as a form of imaginative predica- tion), because the figural is stuck to the literal, thus figuring the way that vision it- self is stuck to the materiality of history. To put it differently, catachresis is the site at which these texts confront something radically inhuman, a materiality that Blake grasps as "history." Whereas Hegel anthropomorphizes history by figuring it as a phenomenology of mind, Blake disfigures this organicism by grotesquely overlaying Urizen's body on the map of the world, so that the body is outside it- self-as an inside that is neither inside nor outside. I conclude this introductory section with a last point on Blake's myth in the Lambeth poems. Although Damrosch proposes that Blake's myth is "psychologi- cal,"17 the figure of a containing self fragmented into different parts is in fact a 16. Kristeva frequently uses feces and vomit to figure the "abject" as an in-between phenomenon that is neither subject nor object and that hovers between a material substance and a psychological condition (analogous to dejection, but more violent). Abjection makes predication impossible by blocking the separation of subject from object, inside from outside, and spirit from body. In order to enter the thetic phase and constitute himself as a bounded ego, the subject must overcome abjection and distinguish himself from an object or Other. 17. Damrosch, Symbol and Truth, 122. TILOTTAMA RAJAN 388 -</page><page sequence="7">VISION, HISTORY, AND TRAUMA IN BLAKE'S LAMBETH BOOKS later development, beginning with The Four Zoas and culminating in Jerusalem. In the latter, Blake returns to the figure that disfigures The Book of Urizen when he equates the four senses with the four points of the compass in his description of Golgonooza: Fourfold the Sons of Los in their divisions and fourfold, The great City of Golgonooza: ... And the Four Points are thus beheld in Great Eternity West, the Circumference: South, the Zenith: North, The Nadir: East, the Center, unapproachable for ever. These are the four Faces towards the Four Worlds of Humanity In every Man. Ezekiel saw them by Chebars flood. And the Eyes are the South, and the Nostrils are the East. And the tongue is the West, and the Ear is the North. (Jerusalem 12:45-60, E 156) In this recuperation of The Book of Urizen, Urizen is replaced by Golgonooza so that catachresis can be reorganized as allegory.18 Correspondingly, the material world is securely placed inside the body, which in turn becomes a pure signifier: a phenomenal rather than material body, written over by numbers and concepts and invested with the ideality of mathematics and myth. This iconic body is the culminating figure for the process of ego consolida- tion that Blake begins in The Four Zoas, where he posits the metasubject of Albion so as to interiorize the action of his texts, in which subjects had previously been dispersed, produced, and used up by events. Through Albion, Blake intro- duces the notion of an original or potential self, thereafter replacing the chroni- cle structure of the early texts with autobiography in Milton, and with history as cosmic autobiography in Jerusalem. In the Lambeth books, however, it is not the self but the historical process that dominates, affecting even Blake's system (as the body of beliefs he would like to inhabit) with an element of irreducible exterior- ity. This exteriority is nowhere more evident than in the strange names that pop- ulate these texts as disfigurations of subjectivity. For "Los" and "Orc" are attempts to ascribe subjectivity to what may well be a process without a subject: 18. Catachresis obviously continues to exist in the later Blake-in fact, Milton's body is an extensive example of it, an almost hysterical literalization of the hermeneutic figure that says that to understand and overcome a system of beliefs you must understand it from within. The point, however, is that catachresis is contained within allegory, in a re-vision of the earlier work that sometimes verges dangerously on being a repetition.  - 389</page><page sequence="8">390 TILOTTAMA RAJAN a process of "changes" and "rift[s]" that is fundamentally inhuman (The [First] Book of Urizen 3:10-11, E 70). Names trope Blake's attempt to insert himself as subject into this uncontrollable process, so as to write the text of history as his own text. Confronting a similarly inhuman process in the form of Demogorgon, Shelley will represent the countervailing act of (self)figuration or mythopoeia through Asia's ascent in the Chariot of the Hour: literally a vehicle without a tenor that Asia bends to her author's will when she steers it toward the utopian ending of her marriage to Prometheus. Blake, however, cannot reconfigure the materiality of his text through his characters, who are responses to events rather than selves, and who therefore do not give him a stable position to occupy. Thus Urizen is authoritarian in chapter 2, yet helpless and anguished at other points, almost to the point of not seeming to be the character earlier referred to by that name. Characters are produced and discarded, like the Eternals, who are largely absent after chapter 3 of Urizen; or like Fuzon, who appears almost as an after- thought at the end of this text but then takes center stage at the beginning of Ahania, only to be used up and forgotten by the end of that poem. Blake's characters, with their strange names, are in fact the site of his struggle with the recalcitrant materiality of history. As Vincent De Luca observes, Blake does not construct his names allegorically by translating a concept into a charac- ter: rather he first encounters them as signifiers, as acoustic forms that have yet to be given a content. But this does not mean, as De Luca concludes, that the names are "iconic"-that we should conceive of the signifier in phenomenal rather than material terms.19 In the Lambeth books at least, where they appear sporadically rather than within epic lists, the strangeness of these names figures the unreadability of the events that Blake struggles to control by naming them with names that he does not himself understand. If the names are an attempt at humanization, their anthropomorphism turns into something like catachresis. Thus the "system," far from being an indicator of Blake's creative autonomy, is the scene of his implication in a world that as yet operates only at the level of the signifier. It is no help that this world can seem familiar: that its characters inter- mittently function like counterparts to figures in Milton and the Bible; or that their Nordic and uncouth names sometimes evoke eighteenth-century projects 19. De Luca argues that names are "miniature iconic centres" or "encapsulated portions of imaginative energy that derive from the permanent forms of 'Los' Halls"' (Words of Eternity: Blake and the Poetics of the Sublime [Princeton, N.J., 1991], 94, 97). But this is mainly true of the later prophecies, where names occur in epic catalogues, and where their opacity is heraldic and ceremonial. 390 - TILOTTAMA RAJAN</page><page sequence="9">VISION, HISTORY, AND TRAUMA IN BLAKE'S LAMBETH BOOKS 391 for the assimilation of difference through syncretist mythology. For Blake carries over these hermeneutic paradigms only in bits and pieces, as if unable to incor- porate them, and as if he can do no more than introject them, as possibilities that can neither be digested nor discarded. II So far I have set the Lambeth books against Blake's subsequent development of a system for the management of difficulty, divided allegorically between a nomenclature and a conceptual apparatus.20 The material signifier of this system is the illuminated book, which unites time and space-in defiance of Lessing's view that art is limited by its medium.21 As the containing form of the system, the illuminated book accomplishes what the system by itself cannot. For whereas the system as verbal construct can do no more than contain difficulty-in the double sense of the word contain-the composite artifact of the illuminated book "reduces"22 difficulty within the intricacy of a figured surface, allowing us to look rather than read, to assimilate the text as art rather than experience. We can approach the aesthetics of the illuminated book by way of De Luca's discussion of the sublime, which is also concerned with the problem of diffi- culty as it is deployed through the thematics of space and time. De Luca dis- tinguishes two modes of the sublime, the bardic and the iconic, corresponding roughly to Kant's mathematical and dynamic sublime-the distinction between the sublime that overwhelms us and the sublime as an experience that restores the bounded ego to a sense of mastery. The bardic style is a style of crisis that is serial, characterized by catalogues of undifferentiated details and by parataxis and metamorphosis rather than culmination. The iconic, while seeming to share the syntax and tactics of the bardic, emphasizes structure rather than flow, "com- pressing signs so densely and firmly that their contingent signifieds are virtu- ally squeezed out," leaving only "a conclave of signifiers, the visible form of intellect mirroring itself."23 It seems that the mode of the bardic is time, whereas that of the iconic is space, and that Blake's texts are generated by a dialectic in 20. This conceptual apparatus is notably absent from the Lambeth books, which in turn increases the diffi- culty we have in separating figure from ground. 21.

According to De Luca, there are "no limits to the scale of an iconic text. Insofar as we can situate ourselves at the proper distance to perceive its form as consolidated and autonomous, a whole poem . . . or even an entire canon in illuminated printing. . . may operate as a magnified word, an iconic centre of arrest and release."24 Ideally, then, the en- graved work would function as a form of iconic sublimity, enclosing the diffi- culty of the system within the illuminated book, which, to adapt Maurice Blanchot, is a "labyrinth in which all combinations of forms, words and letters are rolled up in volumes."25 De Luca's notion of the iconic resembles what Joseph Frank some time ago called spatial form, as an experience in which the reader grasps "both past and present simultaneously in a moment of . .'pure time."' In spatial form, as in the "centripetal concentration" of the icon, we encounter "word-groups that have no comprehensible relation to each other when read consecutively," and we then ap- prehend these units of meaning as "referred to each other reflexively" in space.26 Whereas Lessing stresses the mutual inadequacy of painting and poetry, as media in which one either encounters bodies without action and movement or action without bodily presence, Blake's own late engraving Laocoon is precisely such an instance of spatial form: a kind of concrete poem in which the visual representa- tion of the Laocoon is surrounded by aphorisms, iconically distilled from Blake's other works (figure 28). Converting time to space by allowing words to function visually as borders, Laocoon reverses the layout of Blake's other textographic works, in which a verbal center is enframed by visual borders. It thus makes the point that in a composite art the individual components are not limited to their own media, but rather each order can draw on the powers of the other. Thus Laocoin is a paradigm for the iconic reading of Jerusalem in terms of the inter- convertibility of verbal and visual, time and space, within a logocentrism that al- lows word groups to function as pure signifiers purged of materiality yet endowed with the presence of the visual. Spatial form is profoundly ahistorical. For the sys- tem totalized as verbal icon is a refiguration of history as art, a putting of time into space that inscribes the end of history. Compositeness is a formal marker of the fact that composition involves bring- ing together incommensurables, including space and time or myth and history. 24. Ibid., 94. 25.

Rather I shall return to the difficulty Blake had with composition: with organizing the Lambeth books into what Leslie Tannenbaum claims is a "coherent and unified vision of human life from the Creation to the Apocalypse."27 We can sense this difficulty in the way the Lambeth books fall into two groups, as if Blake found himself reassessing his project in midstream. The first group follows the mode of The French Revolution, which is historically local- ized and full of spectacular scenes and hyperbolical speeches. Thus America, Europe, and The Song ofLos are keyed to presenting actions, and they erupt rather than develop, their very disconnectedness signifying prophetic crisis rather than epic continuity. All four poems place themselves in a world-historical space and, as we shall see, construct history as a shifting discursive surface. In sharp contrast is the second group of poems, whose titles are provided by characters and not conti- nents, those characters (Urizen, Ahania, Los) being psychological rather than geo- graphical "states." Speeches are few and far between in these texts. Shifting from events to the space that precedes them, a space indeterminately cosmic or psychic, Blake reaches back to the prehistorical traumas that encode history, the unseen "rifts" and "perturbations" that produce its furious disorganization. He now seems to want more than a discursive surface, developing the dimension of myth that had first entered his work in Europe, in which the figure of Enitharmon was palimpsestically overlaid upon contemporary events. But this is myth in an an- thropological rather than visionary sense, raw and violent. In other words, it is a fundamentally unartistic form of myth, functioning more like the semiotic that precedes the Symbolic order:28 a way of taking culture back to the overdetermined primal scenes that constitute its contradictions. Developing his myth between 1791 and 1795, Blake reaches for an explana- tion of the historical world whose surface he is initially content to appropriate through discourse. In the process, however, he dismantles the temporary synthe- sis he had constructed in his earliest historical poems to deal with the alienness of history as a world of energy resistant to imagination. He likewise disables these texts from functioning within the world-historical space of prophecy, aborting 27. Tannenbaum, Blakes Early Prophecies, 7. 28. I use these terms as they are used by Julia Kristeva. The "Symbolic" order, as in Lacan, is the order of law and patriarchy inscribed in the very structures of language and predication. The "semiotic" is a pre-thetic realm of drives and "pulsions" that precedes the entry into language by way of which the frag- mented body is organized into a bounded ego, and that continues to erupt into the Symbolic throughout adult life. 394 -v TILOTTAMA RAJAN</page><page sequence="13">VISION, HISTORY, AND TRAUMA IN BLAKE'S LAMBETH BOOKS them within a semiotic and pre-textual space. As I shall suggest, the preludia to Europe and America are Blake's first reflection on the relationship between that space and the time of history, while the splitting apart of visual and verbal ele- ments in the next group of texts traumatically figures the sense that that trans- ference can no longer be made. That the early Blake's view of history is in no sense humanist has already been suggested. From The French Revolution to the texts of 1795, history is de- picted in terms of "unseen conflictions" and abrupt "changes" (The [First] Book of Urizen 3:10, 14, E 70) that are the archeological symptoms of its structuring by an arbitrarily (im)positional power that makes the inscription of any individ- ual event in a sequential narrative virtually impossible. Nevertheless, The French Revolution and The Marriage of Heaven and Hell-as well as the "prophecy" sec- tions of America and to a lesser extent Europe-differ from Urizen in the style of their engagement with this "history." They protect prophecy by developing what I shall call a nomadic textuality, which survives by assuming the form of the his- tory that disfigures it. In these texts history is Foucauldian rather than Hegelian, which is to say that it is not teleological but governed by power. What we have in The French Revolution and America is a world of pure surfaces in which actors on the world-historical stage put on and take off the apocalyptic discourse of cloud and fire like clothing. They appear, seize the microphone, and cease, elud- ing "commentary by supposing no remainder, nothing in excess of what has been said, but only the fact of its historical appearance."29 Because these characters exist only as what they say, the prophecies inscribe themselves as pure event, in the performative presence of what Tannenbaum calls "significative action,"30 which creates an iconic focus on the physical or discursive event. But perhaps even more appropriate than Foucault as a recent gloss on these texts is Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari's "nomad" politics, which reworks the concept of power in a more libidinal and anorganic way.31 Nomads are those that live outside the state apparatus, avoiding the "sedentary road" (p. 380) for the 29.

I use the word anorganic to indicate that the rhizome, while after all a form of life and not a structure, also violates conventional notions of the organism. Analogous to the rhizome (represented in the plant world by tubers and weeds, in the animal world by rat packs, and in the insect world by ants) is Deleuze and Guattari's notion of the body without organs. See Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia, trans.

Consequently, while no- madic territory will have "lines of articulation or segmentarity," it will also be characterized by "lines of flight, movements of deterritorialization and destratifi- cation" (p. 3). Corresponding to such societies, and to an imagination that is prophetic rather than priestly, is the rhizomatic text as distinct from the "root- book" constituted "by the interiority of a substance or subject" (pp. 5, 9). The rhi- zome is "a stranger to any idea of genetic axis or deep structure" (p. 12). Instead, like certain weed forms, it grows as a "ramified surface extension in all directions," such that if it is broken at a given point "it will start up again on one of its old lines, or on new lines" (pp. 7, 9). From time to time it will stabilize in a bulb or tuber, as the energy of Blake's text is temporarily fixed in a figure such as Orc be- fore passing on and leaving us "with nothing more than a name as the trace of an intensity" (pp. 7, 4). This notion of the text as transmitting intensities is in fact the key to understanding how Blake preserves the prophetic function in a world of power: a rhizomatic world that he will later associate more darkly with the poly- pus. The nomad text is not meant to be read, or even to be looked at, but rather to be felt. It is not an illuminated book but an "assemblage" printed in the infernal method with corrosives, which means that we do not ask "what it means, as signi- fied or signifier" but rather "what it functions with, in connection with what other things it does or does not transmit intensities" (p. 4). Because it is a "body without organs" converging with the reader's body, it causes "asignifying particles or pure intensities to pass or circulate" (p. 4), and can thus discharge revolutionary inten- sity without narrating the achievement of revolution. Indeed, narrative is unnec- essary to the nomad text, since "the rhizome connects any point to any other point" (p. 21). In this sense it does not matter that tyranny is not overthrown in what Blake wrote of The French Revolution, or that the significance of the "strife of blood" at the end of Europe is so unclear as to have been read in totally contradic- tory ways. For Blakean prophecy is not a prediction or a vision, but a "literary ma- chine" that functions in conjunction with other machines: "a war machine, love machine, revolutionary machine, etc." (p. 4). ^ III % As the politicized form of the negative capability discussed at the beginning of this essay, the nomad text is the inverse mirror image of the illuminated book. 396 - TILOTTAMA RAJAN</page><page sequence="15">VISION, HISTORY, AND TRAUMA IN BLAKE'S LAMBETH BOOKS But the evidence is that Blake was growing increasingly troubled with this model. The beginnings of this discomfort are already evident in Europe and America, which, by way of their division into preludium and prophecy, raise the question of what lies behind prophetic power. The narrative sections of these poems are focused on the discursive event and not on its (psycho)analysis. America in par- ticular continues the tactics of the rhizomatic text most clearly developed in The Marriage ofHeaven and Hell. Where the "book composed of chapters has culmi- nation and termination points," the rhizomatic text consists of plateaus, which always occur "in the middle, not at the beginning or the end" (Deleuze and Guattari, A Thousand Plateaus, 22, 21), each act or speech act in the case of America constituting one of these thousand plateaus. But in both Europe and America, nomadic prophecy is placed within a specifically masculine space, by way of its positioning in relation to preludia spoken by women who have no voice in the prophetic discourse itself. For in America the protagonists of the main narrative are all male. As for Europe, the vilification of Enitharmon marks the prophetic voice as decisively male, even as the strangely rhythmic quality of her speeches combined with the positing of a female "depth" behind the mascu- line surface of world-historical action inscribes gender as a site of excess unac- counted for by this vilification. As Julia Wright points out in the most impressive account to date of the pre- ludia, both preludia focus on women agonistically divided between womb and voice so as to foreground the stamping (out) of their heterogeneity in the "solid form" (Europe 2:8, E 61) of the book.32 But in contrast to Wright I would argue that the nomad text is in some ways complicit with the book. For one thing, it evades time and thus experience through a sub-version of spatial form in which each "plateau can be read starting anywhere and can be related to any other plateau" (A Thousand Plateaus, 22). Moreover, in substituting general for re- stricted economy, it merely replaces a homogeneous with a heterogeneous prophetic power.33 For the female of Europe there is no clear division between these two modes, between the prolific and "vig'rous progeny of fires" that 32.

I am also indebted to Wright's doctoral dissertation "The Politics of Textuality: 'Unceasing Practice' in Blake's Work" (University of Western Ontario) for making me think about textual cruxes and oddities even when we interpret them differently. 33. I borrow these terms from Georges Bataille, who obviously stands behind the work of Deleuze and Guattari. The most succinct account of heterogeneity and general economy can be found in Bataille's "The Psychological Structure of Fascism," Visions of Excess: Selected Writings, 1927-1939, ed.

Occupying the same position in Blake's text as do Milton's invoca- tions to his muse, the preludia disable rather than enable the subsequent process of composition, forcing prophecy to "roll inward" (2:16, E 61) and consider its own basis. In America, the writing of the poem is facilitated by a form of rape, symbol- ically normalized by figuring the shadowy female as dumb nature, and recuperat- ing her violation as that which gives her access to speech. The mating of Orc and the shadowy female, however, is hardly a union of spirit with matter. For both are primitive and chthonic beings, and what the female finds in her new access to lan- guage is "eternal death" and "the torment long foretold" (2:17, E 61). In Europe, expression-whether it involves the restriction of creativity through the "stamp- ing" attributed to Enitharmon34 or its dissemination through what Blake had ear- lier described as the casting of his metals into the expanse-is felt by the female as a constant violation. Breaking his harp in two copies, the bard of America may concede that he cannot make the shadowy daughter of Urthona work as a figure of inspiration who would be the female (and historically localized) counterpart of Los. Or he may recognize that his (ab)use of the female (dis)figures the work that follows by inscribing it as part of a will-to-power, complicit with a historical world in which there is no substantive distinction between tyranny and energy, "Albions Angel" and America's "thirteen Angels" (5:1, 9:13; E 53, 54). Both preludia, moreover, are focalized through nameless shadowy females who raise the question of what is involved in the naming that will prove so cru- cial to Blake's system (including perhaps the naming of the female as Enitharmon).35 Insofar as the female of America gains access to speech only after her rape, we can see these "Unnam'd forms" (The Marriage of Heaven and Hell 15, E 40) with which Blake begins as versions of what Kristeva calls the semiotic, which for Blake is found in the prelinguistic space of myth. For Kristeva as for Plato, the semiotic "chora" is a specifically female space. Through the females, then, Blake represents the reading of history through the transposition of myth into literature as a reduction to Symbolic form of the semiotic that Nietzsche de- scribes as "the original Oneness, its pain and contradiction."36 For the female of 34. Wright points out that the process of stamping with a signet recalls the licensing of books (which of course Blake tried to avoid through his unique mode of producing texts). 35. The link between the female and Enitharmon is suggested by the female's reference to the latter as the "accursed mother" who brings her "into life" even as she labors to bring into life her own vigorous progeny of fires (E 1:11, 2:8). 36.

In these lines the unnamed form is surre- alistically given a face, beginning as a tree, then turning into an ocean that is also a woman giving birth, and then becoming a thunderstorm that emerges in fe- male clothing to give birth to herself from her head: "I wrap my turban of thick clouds around my lab'ring head; / And fold the sheety waters as a mantle round my limbs" (1:8-13, E 60). The lines represent the process of figuration by which the semiotic is given symbolic shape, but they represent this process agonistically as disfiguration. For on the one hand the unnamed form is given a face by means of its clothing in the rhetoric of apocalypse, much as characters elsewhere in Blake put on prophetic discourse like clothing. But on the other hand the re- sulting tree is uprooted and inverted, and the lines conspicuously draw attention to the process of clothing by which the nameless female is figured as the muse of prophecy-a process whose gendered violence Blake had already confronted in Visions of the Daughters ofAlbion.37 The disturbing effect of these lines is in large part owing to the fact that they rework metaphors and similes from earlier works as catachresis. Thus in The French Revolution we scarcely notice the comparison of the duke of Burgundy to a storm extending over a ripe vineyard (lines 83-86, E 289). But in the pre- ludium to Europe, three heterogeneous entities (woman, tree, and ocean) are vi- olently yoked together in a "space they cannot logically share," so that the "ordinary referentiality of one set of terms wars against the ordinary referential- ity of the other."38 These multiple symbolic constructions, far from giving a face to the female, leave her "void as death" (Europe 2:11, E 60). For catachresis, as Andrzej Warminski notes, "generously 'humanizes' cabbages and lettuces by giv- ing them 'heads,"' yet it thereby "deprives them of a face, body and limbs," thus threatening us with similar mutilation.39 Symbolically figured as a tree, the fe- male is disabled from existing as a human being. But of course the female herself 37. For a discussion of this point see the analysis of Visions in Tilottama Rajan, The Supplement of Reading: Figures of Understanding in Romantic Theory and Practice (Ithaca, N.Y., 1990), 238-52. 38. This is De Lucas description of catachresis (Blake and the Poetics of the Sublime, 99-100). De Luca, however, associates catachresis as a trope of "identification" with the iconic, whereas I would see symbol (as theorized from Coleridge to Paul de Man) as the trope of identification, and would see catachresis as its dismemberment. Insofar as catachresis involves "identification," it is the kind of identification (or confusion) we find in the abject. 39. Andrzej Warminski, Readings in Interpretation: Holderlin, Hegel, Heidegger (Minneapolis, 1987), Ix. It is not clear, of course, whether the tree in this passage is being figured as a female and thus "de-faced" or whether the female is being figured as a tree and thus rendered profoundly unnatural.  &lt;- 399</page><page sequence="18">400 ' TILOTTAMA RAJAN is a figure-a way of affecting us with the pathos of "her" (dis)figuration through images that are profoundly unnatural in the way they naturalize "her." So in the end the catachresis also implicates its author and readers, inscribing our own "mutilation by figures"40 that represent us at the cost of leaving out some part of what we are. As I have suggested, it is possible to read the "prophecy" section of Europe as a nomad text, thus giving it a performative power apart from the preludium. But its style is also dense and involuted, in a way that distinguishes it from the previ- ous historical poems. More specifically the prophecy is constructed as a dark con- ceit that is itself more like catachresis than allegory, or fourfold vision. For the entire narrative is based on a figure, or rather a montage, in which the myth of Enitharmon is overlaid on the masque of European history. But it is far from clear how we separate figure from ground here: that is, whether European history is the phantasmagoric effect of the Female Will; or whether conversely Enitharmon is a figure for a "history" that would then constitute the ground of the figure. If the latter is the case, Enitharmon would also be a figure constructed within history, a misogynistic trope for the nightmare with which the masculine Logos cannot deal. The curious fact that she is asleep for the entire duration of this history lit- erally allows us to figure history as her nightmare. But it also suspends the causative link between ground and figure, between the Female Will and the so- ciohistorical world, by dislocating any sense of agency in the poem. As an ex- tended catachresis, then, the narrative of Europe is unreadable because we cannot see the two quite disparate entities of "Enitharmon" and "history" in the same space, and therefore cannot see the relationship between them. For it is far from clear whether the action takes place in Enitharmon's crystal house or the histori- cal world, catachresis also being a figure that undoes perspective as the difference between foreground and background. The impossibility of seeing the text, of en- visioning its narrative, generates on a broader level a loss of vision that makes it impossible to see the relationship between myth and history. Or to put it differ- ently, Blake cannot see this relationship: a predicament that he expresses by plac- ing Enitharmon and history on two separate planes of space and time, each organized, it would seem, according to its own logic. As a figure that makes the text unreadable, catachresis is linked to other forms of deformation that enter the Lambeth books after America. These include nar- rative compression and genealogical metalepsis. Thus in Europe the shadowy fe- 40. Ibid., lx. TILOTTAMA RAJAN 400 ,</page><page sequence="19">VISION, HISTORY, AND TRAUMA IN BLAKE'S LAMBETH BOOKS male rises from "out the breast of Orc" (1:1, E 60), yet Orc in the form of "howl- ing terrors" seems to be the fruit of the labor she goes through in childbirth (2:4, E 61). Moreover, it is not clear whether the labor of childbirth is endured by Enitharmon producing the female (1:8-11, E 60), by the female giving birth to herself (1:12, E 61), or by the female giving birth to Orc, with whom a shadowy female had mated in the preludium to America. This scrambling of genealogy makes it impossible to figure (out) the relationship between the mythic charac- ters, and thus to understand how mythic space might inform the historical time with which Blake seems to want to align it.41 Like the catachrestic structure of Europe, the poem's mangled genealogy forces us to encounter the increasing dif- ficulty of composition as a process in which Blake has two sets of material and cannot translate the one into the other. On the one hand he is accumulating more and more of the mythemes or "Unnam'd forms" that will constitute his "system." On the other hand their relationship to history is far from clear. Moreover, the archetypes themselves are characterized by a certain excess, such that their transposition into time is a disfiguration, a stamping with "solid form" of the semiotic that precedes language. &lt;a IV &lt; Despite the increasing difficulty of transferring myth into history in these works, Blake continues in The Song of Los with the project of nomadic prophecy, con- structing a frame to contain America and Europe within a structure of four "plateaus" that now includes Africa and Asia as well. In the process he also be- gins to disclose nomadic space as imperial, by mapping it onto four continents that can be linked in a temporal structure, introducing at least the potential for a fusion of time and space in world history conceived in apocalyptic rather than Hegelian and evolutionary terms. The logistics of this structure have been out- lined by Erdman and Tannenbaum. Erdman sees the "Africa" and "Asia" sections of the Songas forming a prologue to America and Europe, since "Africa" ends with the first line of America and "Asia" begins with the howl that proceeds from Orc's appearance in Europe.42 Tannenbaum further develops this suggestion within a biblical framework by arguing that Africa or Egypt is the place where abstract law 41. Damrosch discusses the persistence of these genealogical dislocations in the later texts, but concludes simply that they show "the irrelevance of ordinary causal and genetic assumptions" to Blake's post- Newtonian narrative (Symbol and Truth, 129). 42.

Erdman, Blake: Prophet against Empire (1954; reprint, Garden City, N.Y., 1969), 258.  401</page><page sequence="20">402 TILOTTAMA RAJAN and philosophy were first imposed, while Asia is "the area in which Paul did his most important work."43 To this hypothesis about Blake's intentions we might want to add one modification. Asia can provide no more than the trace of apoc- alypse, since an interpretive imperialism so resolutely occidental as the one out- lined here is unlikely to find salvation in the third world. Rather than functioning as prologue and epilogue to the earlier poems, then, Asia and Africa, as places where history has its primitive origins, might be seen as pre-forming the arche and telos of Western history. In other words their relationship to America and Europe would not be a linear one in which they provide the beginning and end of a secular scripture. Instead we would see the continents as comprising two pairs of plateaus, in which the movement from the shorter to the longer prophe- cies transposes myth into history, and juxtaposes the European crisis in which the nightmare of history implodes on itself with the more positive explosion of this energy in the American revolution. What is noteworthy, however, is that this framework becomes apparent only as a frame that does not work-which may be why Blake never listed the Song among his works. Blake, moreover, seems unable to make Asia function except as a dark continent: in the climax of this section Urizen unfolds his wings to pro- tect her kings, simultaneously unfolding his books of law, which melt Icarus-like; but as the books are destroyed, the continent on which they fall is also consumed in "clouds of despair / ... howling, weeping" (Song ofLos 7:12, 16, E 69). Rather than seeing the continents as political states that Blake has succeeded in coloniz- ing by putting them into world history, we should therefore see them instead as psychic "states" that he is unable to put into time. Like the other Lambeth books, the Song assembles bits and pieces of the system, summoning up virtually all the characters Blake has named so far, but as an array that the text cannot narrativize. Whatever its intention, the Song conspicuously fails to enact the progress from Africa to America projected in the union of Orc, "the image of God who dwells in darkness of Africa," with the dark virgin of America (America 2:8, E 52). Instead, Europe, Africa, and Asia (Song ofLos 4:18-21, E 68), as well as different episodes from world history, seem to be concurrently present in a space without time. Moreover, the difficulty of making space and time work together is ex- pressed in a new division between the material components of Blake's work. Insofar as the verbal for Lessing was associated not just with time but also with 43. According to Tannenbaum, "Blake uses the two continents as symbols that define the movement of biblical history, starting in Africa with the origin of Mosaic law and ending in Asia with the abrogation of the law and the apocalyptic birth of a new dispensation" (Blake's Early Prophecies, 185-86). 402 , TILOTTAMA RAJAN</page><page sequence="21">VISION, HISTORY, AND TRAUMA IN BLAKE'S LAMBETH BOOKS action and the visual with the static presence of bodies in space,44 this division thematizes what we had already sensed in the text of the Song: namely, that Blake cannot combine bodies and actions, psychic space and history. Thus in Ahania and The Book of Los the text is completely without design. On the other hand, Urizen has more full-page designs than any other text by Blake (a total of ten). Furthermore, where text and design are combined, the lat- ter dwarfs the former, often dominating it from above or pressing against it from below, but always occupying a separate space-whereas in previous texts the two orders had intersected and intertwined. In retrospect this dichotomous organiza- tion draws attention to a problem already present as early as Visions of the Daughters ofAlbion, the first work to include a full-page design that is not sim- ply part of the front matter (see color plates I-XI). Invited to collect these de- signs separately in his "Large Book of Designs," Blake began to constitute the visual as a zone separate from language. But it is Europe in particular that antic- ipates the precedence of the visual in Urizen. For Europe contains five pull-page designs, and more bizarrely two plates in which the verbal and visual intersect, but as in a collage. These plates are particularly interesting because they interrupt the seamless functioning of visual and verbal orders. The plate beginning "And the clouds &amp; fires pale rolld round in the night of Enitharmon" (E 64, plate 12) is mostly text but is broken up by a cobweb, spoiled, in a gesture similar to the bard's breaking of his harp in America. In the plate beginning "The Red limbd Angel seiz'd in horror and torment," two incomplete visual segments are spliced together with a text also cut into two pieces (see color plate XVIII; E 65, plate 13). Dividing the text between European history and Enitharmon's crystal house, the plate also divides the phenomenality of prophecy from the raw materiality of the design underneath it, which usurps the foreground so as to make what Blake is saying seem irrelevant. Moreover, this foreground consists only of mutilated fragments: a frontal view of a manacled and shrieking prisoner, and the backside of some rough beast slouching away-either the jailor or the freed prisoner him- self holding a link of his chain. The "Red limbd Angel" plate is the visual equivalent of the preludia in func- tioning reflexively as a scene of composition. It shows Blake trying to splice to- gether materials that are incommensurable, thus defacing the aesthetic of the illuminated book as a unity in which seeing and saying support each other. But 44. Lessing, Laocoon, 78.  v- 403</page><page sequence="22">404 TILOTTAMA RAJAN while Europe still struggles to unite different orders of perception and thus to per- form as prophecy, in the later Lambeth books this synthesis is increasingly dis- abled. In Urizen (copy G),45 the text's attempt to construct the Eternals in opposition to Urizen, "As the stars are apart from the earth" (6:1, E 73), fails en- tirely to translate the design of the facing plate 7, which shows the Eternals bound and twisted, falling head downward into the depths of the earth. More generally, designs in Urizen often bear no relationship to the texts they face, thus inscribing an excess, a separate zone, whose "dark visions of torment" cannot eas- ily be translated into "swift winged words" (2:6-7, E 70). This zone exists as a space apart from time, a space of trauma rather than transcendence. For the de- signs in Urizen are dominated by the body, and lack the foliage, the traces of the natural world, that are still occasionally present in Europe. They constitute space as inside rather than outside, as the space of a psyche that grasps itself as body rather than spirit, and thus as outside itself, in materiality. Moreover, they draw us irresistibly into this space, because the body is pushed into the foreground and represented frontally, so as to deny us any distance from what we see. The designs in Urizen are material signifiers of the semiotic foreclosed by the text's struggle to reduce history to systematic form so as to refine body into spirit. Thus the text tries to construct a Symbolic order by distinguishing Urizen from the Eternals and Los from Urizen, so as to name characters within a system of bi- nary oppositions. But the designs are full of unnamed forms whose identity is far from clear, even to Blake himself, who must keep naming and unnaming them by attaching them to different segments of text. Moreover, the designs traumati- cally foreground images such as the globule of blood or Urizen's skeleton. They project a zone of the abject, to reintroduce Kristeva's term: a zone of pre-thetic horror that precedes and impedes the construction of subjectivity by making it impossible to distinguish this from that, Los from Urizen, or inside from outside. Because it precedes syntax and predication, the abject emerges visually rather than linguistically, rendering vision itself a profoundly problematic concept. For the precedence of the visual also coincides with Blake's foregrounding of the word "vision, "which is increasingly associated not with transcendence but with "tor- ment" and "dark seperation" (The [First] Book of Urizen 15:8, E 78): with the pri- mal scenes that anthropologists study as "myth." The emergence of the visual as a separate affective register figures Blake's growing sense of the connection between myth and trauma, which in turn ac- 45.

Easson (Boulder, Co., and New York, 1979). 404 , TILOTTAMA RAJAN</page><page sequence="23">VISION, HISTORY, AND TRAUMA IN BLAKE'S LAMBETH BOOKS counts for the difficulty he has in translating vision into language. In Urizen (as also in Ahania and The Book ofLos), Blake goes behind the mangled surface of history to the pre-history in which it is inscribed, thus confronting a recurrent problem: namely the origin of historical events in cultural traumas for which there may not be material causes or remedies. These traumas are collectively en- coded in myth, which turns out to be closer to the Real than to the Imaginary. Myth therefore functions as a shifter for Blake, a defense mechanism that switches the track on which the texts move by diverting what is meant to be the rationalization of history, in the anagogic terms of the system, into an encounter with its pre-history. But it is not that language avoids the trauma en-visioned in myth, for the text itself is usurped by metaphors that are intensely visual but jammed together in such a way as to make visualization impossible. At the root of the difficulty we have in seeing this text is the text's own uncertainty as to what "Urizen" is. Thus it is important not to approach the title character through the role Blake gener- ally assigns to him. Rather the "Urizen" of this text is what makes necessary his supplementary figuration as a tyrannical rationalist whose separation from the other Zoas accounts for the genesis of both history and the self as a fragmented body or corps morcele. From the beginning Urizen has no identity, and can be evoked only negatively as a "shadow of horror," or by subtraction as a "vacuum" that is "Unknown, unprolific!" and "unseen" (3:1-5, 10, E 70). Before Urizen there is something else, a landscape that is confusedly material and psychic: a space in which obscure and cataclysmic geological mutations appear that are nei- ther inside nor outside a subject who seems unseparated from the material world. While the Eternals try to see this space as a void created by Urizen and thus to place it within a perceptual syntax that distinguishes subject from object, what they confront is more like the abject: a state in which Urizen is the "vast forests" that the Eternals construct genitively as "his" (3:24-26, E 71). This impossibil- ity of separating subject from object is why "Urizen" so often appears as a func- tion rather than a subject ("an activity unknown and horrible" [3:20, E 71]), or as the congealed effect of a verb without an agent, as in the description of him as an "obscure separation" (5:40, E 73). Attempting to understand this cognitive "void," the poem's speaker asks "What Demon" has formed it and answers with the statement, "Some said / 'It is Urizen"' (3:3-6, E 70). He concedes that what he calls "Urizen" may be a process without a subject, whose "history" may be no more than an anthropomorphizing figure. Significantly, the very positing of Urizen leaves open the question of a subject distinct from its object, since it is  - 405</page><page sequence="24">406 ' TILOTTAMA RAJAN unclear whether "It is Urizen" who has created the void, or whether "It" (as the void) is Urizen. As a work that begins by conceding its own figurality, The Book of Urizen on one level is about figuration, and enacts the disfiguration of the abject it attempts to screen. The abject as a loss of distinctions leaks into the text through a syntax that suppresses predication and subordination in favor of adjectives and com- pacted participial constructions that can refer to more than one actant, or dis- placements of word-order characteristic of an inflected language. Thus when Urizen says "I alone,. . . the winds merciless / Bound" (4:19-20, E 72), it is un- clear whether the adjective refers to Urizen or to the winds; and when he de- scribes how he fought with fire it is unclear whether he or the fire is "consum'd / Inwards" (4:14-15, E 72). Often activities are described, or verbs used, that have no clear agency: Shrill the trumpet: &amp; myriads of Eternity, Muster around the bleak desarts Now fill'd with clouds, darkness &amp; waters That roll'd perplex'd labring &amp; utter'd Words articulate, (3:54-4:4, E 71) Here the subject of the verb "utter'd" ought to be "Urizen," but the only possible grammatical subject is "clouds, darkness &amp; waters," thus once again confusing "Urizen" with the elements. Moreover, while it is often eventually possible to as- sign subjects to participles and verbs in the punctuated written text, such assign- ments are radically suspended in an oral reading, making words into intensities or pulsions through which characters exchange identities.46 And it is an oral read- ing that is called for in the opening lines, in which the Eternals dictate their swift, winged words to the poet. This syntactic amorphousness reflects the text's status as myth, which we can define as the dream-work of anthropology. As Jurij Lotman points out, myth in general differs from the "plot-text" in being cyclic and in "precipitating" within a single "text-image" characters who in literature would be distinguished syn- chronically (like Los and Urizen) or diachronically (like Orc and Fuzon). Because myths consist of self-repeating cycles of events that can be told starting at any 46. An example is "Los wept... for in anguish, / Urizen was rent from his side" (6:2-4). The punctuation makes it clear that the anguish belongs to Urizen, but in an oral reading either Los or Urizen could be "in anguish." 406 - TILOTTAMA RAJAN</page><page sequence="25">VISION, HISTORY, AND TRAUMA IN BLAKE'S LAMBETH BOOKS point, linear categories of beginning and end are irrelevant to them,47 as are moral categories of good and evil. Myth in this sense is the abject of literature: an orality without syntax in which actantial identities are not yet distinct and events (such as the Creation and Fall) are condensed together. Attempting to or- ganize this chaos in transmitting the "words" dictated by the Eternals into writ- ing, Blake constructs the "Book" of Urizen as a story that isolates a beginning, a middle, and an end, so as to inscribe the horror of Urizen within a chain of re- sponsibility. He likewise structures the field of characters in terms of binary op- positions that will separate good from evil and proper from improper. But the chronology of the poem remains radically unclear, even at the level of simple words such as the "When" of the Preludium (2:2, E 70). Thus it may be that the Eternals confined Urizen in the north "when" he assumed power. Or it may be that he assumed power "when" they cast him aside by banishing him to the north, or even that they confined him to the north when they assumed him to have a power that they needed to figure as concentrated in him. Likewise the characters that Blake distinguishes keep collapsing back into each other. Thus Urizen is accused of dividing space and time (3:8, E 70), but Los also divides "The horrible night into watches" (10:10, E 75). The Eternals produce the seven deadly sins that are also attributed to Urizen (4:49, 30, E 72), and anticipate Urizen's construction of the "Net of Religion" when they spread the "Tent" of "Science" (25:22, 19:2-9; E 82, 78). Indeed the preludium already makes it im- possible to distinguish the Eternals from Urizen, referring to "the primeval Priests assum'd power" (2:1, E 70), and leaving it unclear whether "Priests" refers to Urizen or (as is more likely given the plural form) to the Eternals.48 If the story the text tries to tell itself is constantly precipitated back into the unresolved mythic matrix from which it emerges, it is also twisted and inter- rupted by grotesque metaphors such as a roof "fram'd: like a womb" or a "Web" that is a "Female in embrio" (5:28-29, 25:18; E 73, 82). These metaphors are in- tensely visual yet cannot be visualized, marking the eruption into language of the trauma Blake tries to confine in the designs. More important, they are catachre- ses-the dominant mode of Urizen, which constantly attaches body parts to what seems nonhuman, figuring rivers as "veins / Of blood" and the world as "a human heart strugling &amp; beating" (5:30-36, E 73). Catachresis, as Warminski argues, is 47. Jurij M. Lotman, "The Origin of Plot in the Light of Typology," trans. Julian Graffy, Poetics Today 1 (autumn 1979): 163, 167. 48. I discuss these ambiguities of syntax and plot at greater length in The Supplement of Reading, 262-70. However, my attempt to allow space for a more positive reading of Urizen now seems rather forced.  o 407</page><page sequence="26">408 TILOTTAMA RAJAN the trope of disfiguration because it is abusive, far-fetched-thus opening up the tropological system so that it cannot constitute itself seamlessly.49 But as I have further suggested, it is also the trope of abjection. This is true not only because of its link to the horrifying and grotesque, but also because catachresis blocks the sep- aration of figural and literal, Symbolic and Real, a suspension that is necessary if literature is to address the spiritual rather than corporeal understanding. Thus in the metaphor of the roof "fram'd: like a womb," the text replaces one figure (the roof) with another (the womb), withholding the ground of the figure in an image that is doubly figural. But at the same time the second figure is more affectively real than the first, as if afflicted by the Real that it would like to forget by using the womb as no more than a symbol for a female nature. We can grasp this point bet- ter by referring to Ortega y Gasset's suggestion that metaphor is linked to "the spirit of taboo," and involves the substitution of "one thing for another-from an urge not so much to get at the first as to get rid of the second."50 Where metaphor as an agent of the Symbolic is a mechanism for forgetting, catachresis is a kind of memory: a literalization of figure that remembers the Real.51 As a memory of the material, catachresis in The Book of Urizen produces the abjection of a humanist history that reads material processes in organic terms by making use of such figures as "the body politic." The prophet of the Lambeth books wants to see history as the story of a subject, albeit a fragmented subject struggling to return to the primal unity destroyed by "Urizen." But this subject ap- pears only in bits and pieces, its organs transplanted into rivers that are "veins / Of blood" and a world "Like a human heart strugling &amp; beating." Indistinguishably Urizen and Albion, the subject seems grafted onto the material world, as if it can be imagined only outside its own body, where it also returns as an inside through the affect of its abjection. In this sense Urizen brings to a climax the crisis first in- troduced when the Bard of America breaks his harp, ashamed of his attempt to an- thropomorphize the American Revolution by figuring it as the union of Orc with a shadowy female. This first disfiguration of prophecy is agonistically figured in a motif that is repeated across the last four Lambeth books: the figure of a globe or disk that may be a world, a womb, an embryo, an orb of vision, or a globule of blood. The figure occurs thrice in the designs of Urizen and twice in those of The 49. Warminski, Readings in Interpretation, liv. 50. Jose Ortega y Gasset, The Dehumanization ofArt and Other Writings on Art and Culture (New York, 1956), 31. 51. I am obviously diverging here from the more rhetorical account of catachresis given by de Man and Warminski, although I would argue that my psychoanalytic account of the figure is implicit in the pathos of Warminski's description, which in effect does posit a Real (and not just a lack) at the origin of the figure. 408 '~ TILOTTAMA RAJAN</page><page sequence="27">VISION, HISTORY, AND TRAUMA IN BLAKE'S LAMBETH BOOKS Song of Los. It also appears at numerous points in the text of Urizen as "the dark globe of Urizen" over which Los keeps watch (5:38, E 73), the "red / Round globe hot burning deep" which drops from Urizen's spine (11:2-3, E 75), and the round globe of blood that drops from Los when he is divided by pity (13:58, E 77), be- coming a "globe of life" that turns into "the first female form now separate" (18:1, 15, E 78). Blake tries to recuperate this figure within a teleology in Jerusalem, when he says "There is a Void, outside of Existence, which if enterd into / Englobes itself &amp; becomes a Womb" (Jerusalem 1:1-2, E 144). In the Lambeth books, however, the globe englobes the organ of vision for which it is a catachre- sis, and (dis)figures itself as a globule of blood, binding vision to the trauma from which it is born. c' V ~ In the three texts that follow Urizen, Blake expands his system, like Urizen's body, in various directions, inscribing it in a process of displacement and substitution. He makes two mutually supplementary attempts to move beyond the anger and dejection cathected onto "Urizen," by adding characters in Ahania and The Book of Los and a world-historical framework in the Song ofLos. Thus the Songtakes off from the penultimate lines of Urizen, where the followers of Fuzon name "the pendulous earth" Egypt and leave it (28:21-22, E 83). Crossing back from pre- history into history, these lines gesture toward a spiritual nationalism that will map space into time, such that this time can itself be gathered up into the total- ized space of Jerusalem as the end of history. They reconstitute psychic as political states, so as to organize what in Urizen has neither "form-nor outline,"52 by di- viding self from other and inside from outside. But the lines in Urizen already concede the futility of this project, begun by the Eternals when they confined "Urizen" geographically by giving him a place in the North. For Fuzon's followers give the name of Egypt not to Africa but to the entire pendulous earth, thus "leav- ing" Egypt only in the sense that they leave behind what they cannot deal with. These lines, in other words, already prefigure the generalizing of national into psychic space that will stall Blake's project in the Song. Thus in the next two books he expands his system horizontally by adding characters rather than vertically through historical time, and he once again approaches history in psychic terms rather than in terms of events. By the same token, he compulsively repeats Urizen, 52. Percy Bysshe Shelley, Prometheus Unbounad II.iv.6 (in Shelleys Poetry and Prose, ed. Donald Reiman and Sharon B. Powers [New York, 1977]).  z' 409</page><page sequence="28">410 TILOTTAMA RAJAN returning to the problem that had afflicted the earlier text: that of bodies that can- not be put into narrative. The failure of the Lambeth books is acknowledged in The Book ofLos, which functions as a reflexive coda to the series as well as a "roll[ing] inward" (Europe 2:16, E 61) from the global ambitions of The Song ofLos. The Book ofLos focuses on the five- hundred-year process to which Blake had alluded in Ahania: the shaping of the sun into an icon, an "immense Orb of fire" that is, however, with- out light (Book ofLos 5:34, E 94). The poem might seem to be a cosmogony, but it is rather an introjection of cosmogony as a metaphor for Blake's own dark vi- sions. Chapter 3 is an elaboration of plates 6 and 8 of Urizen, in which a human form now described as a "white Polypus" forces its way through the waters (Book of Los, 4:57-67, E 93). Chapter 4 develops the last plate of the Song, in which Los bends with a hammer over a red orb, which in turn is linked to the globes and globules that recur in Urizen. The entire text is thus an elaboration of earlier plates that encloses and aborts them within the scene of their own composition. Moreover, in The Song of Los the prophetic voice had tried to enter the void so as to englobe it as a specific country, thus mapping psychic space into world-his- torical time. But in The Book of Los the project of binding or defining semiotic energies crucial to representation seems to lead nowhere. Los labors for "Nine ages" (5:41, E 94) at creating the sun, but when it is complete nothing happens. Instead the sun seems to be a form without content, a shape that cannot be in- scribed in a sequential or Symbolic narrative; it therefore produces "no light," thus making no impact on the "unform'd / Dark vacuity" it was supposed to en- globe (5:48-50, E 94). As pure form, "self-balanc'd" and self-contained (5:45, E 94), the sun seems not to lend itself to human use or thus to figuration-a process that Blake, unlike Shelley in The Triumph of Life, does not even attempt. The sun as pure form resists the very notion of artistic labor as praxis, in which work is "the force of history" because it "affirms the presence in the world of something which was not there before," a product or "work" that "transform[s] natural and human realities."53 Instead the sun, as a form that is simply there, leaves its creator superfluous, or as Blanchot says "workless" (desouevre),54 like the shadowy female who is left "void as death" after giving birth to the prophecy. 53.

Blanchot, "The Essential Solitude," in The Gaze of Orpheus, 65. 410 - TILOTTAMA RAJAN</page><page sequence="29">VISION, HISTORY, AND TRAUMA IN BLAKE'S LAMBETH BOOKS Blake recognizes this fact when he concedes that the sun produces "no light, for the Deep fled away / On all sides, and left an unform'd / Dark vacuity" (5:48-50, E 94). Moreover, because the positivity of the sun is without use, the negativity that produces it (the wrath of Los, the melancholy of Ahania) also can- not be dialectically recuperated. The Book of Los, in other words, is an extended "preludium" that deconstructs artistic creation by returning it to the site of an unusable negativity, felt as an "absence of time ... [a] time in which nothing be- gins, in which initiative is not possible."55 In the process, it also deconstructs both dialectical and apocalyptic history-the figures projected by Los's mas- culinization of labor as work-in which laboring at the furnaces of imagination produces Giant Forms that use negativity to change the world by "destroy[ing] language in its present form" to "create it in another form."56 Los, of course, does not accept this deconstruction, and he tries to forge a dialectical and productive relationship between the positivity of the sun and the negativity of "Urizen." Attempting to put the energy of the sun to work Symbolically by binding it to the hi(story) of Urizen, Los tries to give a face to the abject till its "Brain in a rock, &amp; [its] Heart / In a fleshy slough formed four rivers" (5:52-53, E 94). But the "Form" he creates is pure "Illusion" (5:55-56, E 94), and Blake therefore does not tell us what it is, seeming almost to pass him by in the "darkness and deep clouds" that end The Book ofLos (5:57, E 94). Perhaps it is for the same rea- son that Blake includes virtually no designs with his text, turning away from Los and from "the glowing illusion" (5:47, E 94) of the illuminated book.
