Jay Neugeboren published his first book of stories almost thirty years ago; of the more than fifty stories he has writ- ten since, he has collected here fifteen notable for their subtle intelligence and imaginative range. Many are about middle-class New Yorkers contending with love and loss; others explore very different worlds and psyches. Neuge- boren is as adept at conjuring a modern- day Jamesian ghost story, complete with that master's cadences, as he is at dis- secting life in a 1960's Southern town through the eyes of a brain-damaged black veteran. Whatever the subject or setting, Neugeboren creates and sustains a solid, particularized reality in a style at once limpid and evocative. These stories invite repeated readings, revealing layers of meaning that res- onate-especially the title piece which, a mere twenty pages long, reads like a very short, very powerful, and very dis- quieting play. The basic situation will be familiar to readers of Neugeboren's 1997 memoir, Imagining Robert : My Brother , Madness , and Survival. Michael, a successful professional deeply attached to his emotionally disabled brother, is fighting for primary custody of his own three children. The story opens on Michael's surreally tense interview with the court-appointed investigator, whose uncle happens to be the presiding judge. From the outset, both Michael and the reader find themselves on ever-shifting ground: as Michael is anxiously gauging the investigator's every response, the reader is trying to get a bead on Mi- chael's character. The result is an ex- pertly maintained unbalancing act, with Michael left to feel secure and grounded primarily in the love he and his brother share. Neugeboren plays several variations on this theme; perhaps the most poi- gnant is "Minor Sixths, Diminished Sevenths." Jimmy is a middle-aged black musician making a good living in Paris, where he lives with his wife and young son. Separated from his brother, how- ever, whom he has not contacted in years, he feels essentially alone and, far worse, unknown. Weaving memory and wish fulfillment, he expresses their rap- port in musical terms: "Jimmy's hands moved across the keys, the blocked chords- minor sixths, diminished sev- enths-giving Eddie the solid ground he needed. Without that ground, Eddie was lost; with that ground beneath him, Eddie found purchase on this world, could set the music inside him free." Cruel ironies unfold: Jimmy is, in fact, the lost brother, whose unspecified act of cowardly betrayal severed their ties; Eddie talks to Jimmy only in the latter 's imagination. A similarly intense interior mono- logue dominates "In Memory of Jane Fogarty." A psychiatrist becomes the beneficiary of a $500,000 flight insurance policy following the death of one of her patients, a talented but unknown poet who has been in and out of mental hos- pitals. His death and the unexpected windfall generate a series of imagined conversations- in a sense, loopy therapy sessions- with the dead man. The doctor turns patient as she comes to acknowl- edge her sense of incompleteness. The essential ingredient, she decides, is imag- ination: "People who loved stories . . . who could think of their lives as stories -could learn to trust, no matter their childhoods, no matter the psychic and</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 799 bridge the gap. In one of the best essays in the collection, "Ravens at Deadhorse Canyon," he sheds his scientific objec- tivity long enough to imagine, with un- abashed anthropomorphism, two crows as lovers. The concluding sentences are an understated testimony to his new- found animism: "the raven pair IVe been watching- who couldn't care less what I do or do not believe- tell me that sometimes things are what they seem. And tell me to believe what I'm seeing." Reaching Keet Seel offers glimpses into an alien world where the spirit is alive in ways we can only guess, yet the book itself is at times oddly spiritless. Saner's tools- the vocabulary of his an- alytical mind- sometimes fail him, caus- ing the prose to be pedestrian and heavy going. More troubling is his tendency to distance himself from all that is around him. His motives for going on this jour- ney remain murky, and even in the final pages it is not clear what he has found along the way. Saner's theme is univer- sal-the yearning to recapture "gone times"- but too often the book lacks the passion necessary for the task. When I think of other recent chron- iclers of the West- Gretei Ehrlich with her sadness and her blunted desire, or Kathleen Norris obsessed with her re- ligious mission- I believe I sense some of what is missing here. Reaching Keet Seel ultimately gives us an informed view of these sacred sites, but Saner seems to lack intimate enough knowl- edge to bridge the gap between the an- cient world and our own. The ruins of the past remain mute, and walking among the fallen stones through the pages of this book mainly leaves us even more aware of our loneliness. emotional devastation visited upon them." This is a fitting epigram not only for "In Memory of Jane Fogarty" but also for a book so rich in incident, character, images, and insight. Kathleen Snodgrass Erieville, NY</page></plain_text>
