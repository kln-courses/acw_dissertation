<plain_text><page sequence="1">responses to those of his conscious, Mr Matthews proceeds to discuss the aims which the surrealist poet does bear in mind and in the light of which his work must be approached. The literary and historical context of the movement is outlined concisely but adequately and the nature of surrealism presented clearly but in sufficient detail to give a balanced view of the poets' intentions. Attention is given to the surrealist interest in automatic writing and the cult of objective hasard; to the role played by dreams and insanity in presenting the Surrealists with new images and with a fantastical world, - bearing no relation to normal perception dictated by logic yet imposing itself on the dreamer or paranoiac with an apparent logic that is unquestioned and which transforms the world according to the hallucination. Mr Matthews concludes that the ultimate success or failure of the surrealist poem lies in the extent to which it liberates the reader from a purely rational interpretation of the universe and makes him receptive to new and startling images. The fantastical will then no longer appear fantastical because it is as real as every- thing which has hitherto been accepted as real. A domain of surreality is glimpsed, in which perception is no longer a static acceptance of the order imposed on the universe by human reason; it becomes instead a dynamic adventure into the potentialities of each object. The principal aim of Surrealist poetry is echoed by Professor Matthews at the end of his introduction, when he declares: 'My hope is to arouse curiosity, not to exhaust it.' That he should have achieved this in so short a space is no mean attainment. A ANN DUNCAN EXETER Romain Rolland: I'dme et I'art. BYJEAN-BERTRAND BARRERE. Paris: Albin Michel. 1966. 256 pp. 5 N.F. Basically this book is a collection of reprinted articles and as such suffers both from repetition and from lack of continuity. But the dual approach of art and religion, suggested by the subtitle, is appropriate to Romain Rolland, particularly when the centenary year of his birth invites a reappraisal. It seems to be generally agreed that Rolland had a noble character and his denunciation of nationalism, his qualified pacifism, and his message of human unity are more nearly acceptable now than in his day. But his artistic merit is still debated, particularly among his own countrymen. The chief accusation seems to be against his style and on this score he is easily convicted by the criteria of his critics. He can lay no claim to the eminently French qualities of condensation, precision, and wit. He would be quite incapable of the neatness of Anatole France's '[elle] me fessa par simplicite' (L'Ermitage du Jardin des Plantes). On the other hand France, who detested Jean-Christophe, would never have been guilty of the diffuse banality of Rolland's 'le cher visage las de l'amie endormie, et sa paleur d'amour', which Edmond Beaujon justly finds regrettable (Critique, 22 (1966),' 807-8; Jean- Christophe, one volume edition, p. 1173). Rolland admired Voltaire and was influ- enced by him in his satirical farce Liluli, but he couldn't write like Voltaire - he didn't even try. As a matter of fact much of the blame of Rolland comes from a failure to understand his objectives. Gide professed to be puzzled why he should have chosen a German for the hero of Jean-Christophe. He might as well have wondered why Montesquieu had to bring Persians into the Lettres persanes. Gide also managed to suggest that being translatable was a defect, and unpatriotic. Such absurd judge- ments, although later regretted by their author, are nevertheless more often quoted than more favourable comments from the same source (Journal, I889-1939, pp. 543-4, 660). 262 Reviews</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 263 One can find many statements by Rolland himself which seem to play into the hands of his critics. For instance, he wrote to Malwida von Meysenbug on 30 December I895: 'Vous m'appelez un missionnaire. Certes, le titre me convient mieux que celui d'artiste. L'art m'est haissable, quand il n'est pas l'instrument de la pensee; la pensee m'est odieuse, quand elle ne travaille pas pour Dieu' (Cahiers Romain Rolland, No. I, p. 157). A few years later he wrote to Sofia Bertolini: ' . . . au fond (tres sincerement), je me moque de la litterature. Si on lit ce queje fais comme de la litterature, on ne me comprend certainement pas' (Cahiers, No. io, p. 80, 7 July I902). And in December I908, when he had passed the midpoint of Jean- Christophe, he recorded in his notebook, 'Je n'ecris pas une ceuvre de litterature. J'ecris une ceuvre de foi' (quoted in Preface to the one volume edition, p. xiv). Such disavowals of artistic intent are in private communications indiscreetly intercepted by a later generation; publicly he wanted to be considered an artist. After Jean-Christophe was finished he wrote to Gillet, who was planning a volume of extracts with critical comment: 'Je souhaiterais notamment qu'on mit en lumiere (ce qu'on n'a guere fait, jusqu'a present) la personnalite, non seulement morale, mais artistique de Jean-Christophe - ce que l'oeuvre peut avoir d'original, au point de vue litteraire, - et notamment, ses procedes symphoniques ... (Cahiers, No. 2, p. 263, 30 July 1913). The best statement of his position comes in a letter to Alphonse Seche, written for exactly the same purpose as the one to Gillet: ' . . . quand vous dites que "je ne suis pas artiste", c'est peut-etre un peu dur, sans que vous le veuillez; et cela ferait trop plaisir a mes ennemis. J'ai mon idee de l'art qui n'est pas la leur. ... Je crois qu'il serait plus juste de dire que je ne regarde pas l'art comme une fin, mais comme un moyen, comme une langue expressive' (quoted by Barrere p. 14 and (more fully) pp. 240-I). Artistic criticism depends on definitions of art, which in turn are the product of shifting fashions. Rolland was capable of composing admirably quotable passages but he saved them for high points in his narrative. Not for him the sustained perfec- tion of detail, the meticulous structuring, the carefully understated symbolism of the young N.R.F. group. Today small perfections have lost favour. The critical wind has shifted and now sets so strongly in the symbolism quarter that change once more impends. Meanwhile the reputation of Romain Rolland profits, for critics approve of authors who supply materials for their favoured operations. With com- plete plausibility one can discover major symbols running through the work of Rolland and M. Barrere has shown how far one can get with 'riviere', 'racines', and 'souffle'. To say that religion is less satisfactorily handled is no great disparagement of M. Barrere, for the subject is not one to be brushed off in a chapter. The disap- pointment is due not so much to what he says as to what he omits. We miss the beautiful essay he has not written. He modestly effaces himself before the genius of Claudel, who did write on the subject. He finds an excuse in the present unavail- ability of part of the record. And in the end we feel that the subject has not been disposed of but whisked away by sleight of hand. Religion is bipolar. On the one hand is the outer, the organizational, the cultural aspect; on the other, the inner aspect, religion as personal conviction. In the cultural context Rolland often asserted his Catholicism, with the same sort of satisfaction as he showed over his blond hair and blue eyes. But just as often, just as emphatically, he disavowed it as a personal conviction. There is nothing novel about this distinction, but what continued to surprise Rolland was the strength of the emotional link between the inner and the outer poles. He wrote to Claudel in I943:</page><page sequence="3">264 Reviews lttrange dualite de ma nature! Une raison ferme, tranquille, inflexible, qui ne croit pas, et sur laquelle aucun argument de foi ne mord. Un instinct du cceur, qui s'abandonne aux elans de la priere, et peut-6tre surtout au puissant courant du fleuve invisible, coulant sous terre des siecles d'ames croyantes qui m'ont prcedde et engendr6. Nous cheminons ainsi sur deux chemins paralleles, sans rien pouvoir l'un sur l'autre, mais sans nous heurter. (Claudel, (Euvres completes, XVIII, 193) M. Barrere, disapproving of Rolland's refusal to accept revelation and align himself with the Church, calls him a 'sentimental', according to the definition of Le Senne: 'Le sentimental substitue a la religion organisee un anarchisme religieux, une religiosite sincere, mais ind6terminee' (Barrere, p. 105). Claudel too regretted Rolland's intransigence, but more tolerantly: 'On me dira que la religion, que la foi de Romain Rolland, si elle a penetre toute sa vie, toute son activite de penseur et d'artiste, n'a jamais pris la forme dogmatique, ne s'est jamais pliee a aucune discipline precise. Je l'avoue et, comme catholique, je le regrette' (CEuvres completes, xvIII, I74). Claudel's own idea of the religious significance of Rolland's career is this: 'L'ame de Romain Rolland fut essentiellement religieuse. Son itineraire a travers le pantheisme, avec le secours de la musique et sous son influence preeminente, fut une ascension vers la croyance en un Dieu personnel et transcendant qu'il atteignit au cours de ses dernieres annees' (quoted by Barrere, p. 79). Is this then the untold story of Rolland's religion ? Objections leap to mind, first among them Claudel's word 'ascension'. Currently it is bad form, it is 'mere anthropomorphism', to believe in a 'personal' God. Rolland himself, in notes for 'La Delivrance' (a projected chapter of his autobiography) included 'Dieu person- nel' (along with 'patrie', 'croyances communes', and other items) among the beautiful concepts from which he had had to detach himself (Le voyage interieur, 1959, p. 338). Yet this word 'ascension' is borrowed from Rolland who, protesting against the accusation of scepticism called forth by Liluli, exclaimed in a letter quoted by Claudel, 'moi, dont la vie n'a et6 qu'une apre et inlassable ascension du fond du pessimisme ou ma jeunesse se debattait! Aucun de mes amis ne concoit ma foi profonde' ((Euvres completes, XVIII, 174). Very well, we grant him this 'foi profonde' but in what? The answer, full of contradictions if we take Rolland's writings as a simultaneous whole, becomes intelligible if followed as a 'route en lacets qui monte' (to use a phrase borrowed by Rolland from Renan) from a given beginning to an end. The beginning is in 'the depths of pessimism of his youth', the end, not yet reached at the time of the quoted letter, is in the early months of I943. What he needed was support, something to fill the double gap left by the death of God and the disintegration of his own personality. Through all his searchings God - as God - remained dead. And yet, through the closing years of the nineteenth century and on into the twentieth, the word 'Dieu' continually crops up in his letters - not out of piety, not in hypocrisy, not even in the meaning he would offer in excuse if asked, but as if he could put God back in heaven by repeating His name. 'Je ne crois pas a ce Dieu distinct des hommes', he stubbornly insisted (Cahiers, No. 2, p. 14I, 2I May 1901). What he meant, or what he came to mean, is explained in his Journal for August 1914: Ma vraie personnalit6 est essentiellement religieuse; elle est aspir6e en Dieu. Dieu-Maelstrom qui suce toutes les vies.... Si le bien n'est pas un attribut essentiel de ce Dieu implacable tel que je le conqois, si le bien existe en moi et non en lui, c'est donc qu'il est en moi un divin superieur a Dieu mgme. Etje le crois. I1 y a Dieu le Pere. Et il y a le Fils de Dieu. Le Fils de Dieu, c'est nous qui, sortis de la souche divine, sommes ses fleurs et ses fruits. Nous sommes ce</page><page sequence="4">Reviews 265 qu'il doit etre, ce qu'il faut qu'il devienne, ce qu'il sera peut-etre ... car rien n'est fatal dans l'univers, et notre volont6 libre est l'6ldment essentiel de l'avenir. (Journal des annees de guerre, p. 35, Rolland's italics) This position, incidentally, is very similar to the one reached by Gide in I943, with his distinction between the cote-Zeus and the cote-Promethee (Feuillets d'automne, pp. 257-9). Meanwhile many components went into the melting pot of Rolland's religion: Spinoza, Empedocles (important for the idea of Eternal Recurrence), Hindu and Buddhist philosophy (early read, forgotten, and rediscovered), Tolstoy - these all more for confirmation than as sources. His true masters were private illuminations, music, the Alps. When he thought he was about to die he wrote, in 1926, the appalling Royaume du T, in which God became Urseele, his own immortal soul and his mistress. Later he seemed to regret this Freudian extravagance. And so he struggled on, bearing on his weak shoulders the burden of creating God. His illness of January and February 1943 brought him closer to death than he had yet been. Of his experiences he wrote to Gillet, who had himself been very ill and who was to die before Rolland: Que vous devez etre fatigu6! Je sens cette fatigue dans mes os. Je n'ai qu'a me souvenir des jours, des semaines si proches, ofu je ne pouvais que murmurer a ma femme penchde sur moi . . . 'Fatigue... fatigue . . . ' Il y a eu des instants oiu j'ai senti qu'il suffisait d'un abandon, pour passer le seuil, j'6tais au bord, (j'ai eu des illuminations singulieres), je me suis rejete en arriere, au prix d'un effort douloureux. L'affection de ma femme et de ma soeur a beaucoup fait pour me retenir. Le sentiment (presque la sensation) aussi de certaines ames qui priaient pour moi.... Eh bien, a mon tour, je prie pour vous. Puissiez-vous prendre un peu appui sur ma priere! (Cahiers, No. 2, p. 352, 12 June I943) All his life Rolland had fought for the values of individuality while disbelieving in its survival or indeed in anything personal on the other side of the threshold. At the end he seems to have been relieved a little of his solitude. NORTHAMPTON, MASSACHUSETTS HAROLD MARCH The Mind of Dante. Edited by U. LIMENTANI. London: Cambridge University Press.

The opening lecture by Natalino Sapegno was delivered in Italian; it appears here in an English translation by P. Boyde. The other six, originally written in English, were delivered by members of the Department of Italian at Cambridge. Signor Sapegno's brief lecture 'Genesis and Structure: Two approaches to the poetry of the Comedy', makes some very illuminating observations on the positions taken up by Croce and De Sanctis. It would perhaps have been more conclusive (and, I feel sure, clearer to his under- graduate audience) if he had told us at the beginning whether he accepts or rejects the basis of Croce's aesthetic theory. Even at the end of the essay there seems a certain reluctance to do so unequivocally:</page></plain_text>
