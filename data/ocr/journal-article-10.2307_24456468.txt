D. CHENU 181 would carry the destinies of love even within matter.1 It is not only in carnal love that this divine expansion is achieved, it is also everywhere that a community is expressed which is based on a material work. The solidarity of work is a privileged area at a time when this solidarity is in effect creative of humanity, and by that very act, a motive force of history, since material time is the vehicle of this continuous creation. The sacred history of the Incarnation transcends in every way this terrestrial history, but it does not evacuate it. On the contrary, it will consummate, in new heavens and a new earth, all provisory labors and all unsatisfied loves. Here theology will rejoin one of its favorite contemplations. On several oc casions we spoke of "divine govern ment." It is a common expression— which must be severely purified of its anthropomorphism—among the masters of Christian medieval thought. Their Summas of theology consecrate an en tire section to situating man in the uni verse, observing substantial connections of his nature with Nature, disclosing his role as artifex, and calculating the den sity of matter not only in his body, but in the fabrication of the universe of which he is in charge. They study mat ter in these "mutations," these "mo tions," which are echoed from celestial bodies from circle to circle even in the secrets of spirit and the freedom of men. These medieval doctors even considered the biological laws of nutrition and gen eration, since, they said, matter "is of importance in the truth about human nature." It is on this subject, with the treatise on divine government, that St. Thomas completes the first part of his Summa (Utrum aliquid de alimento con 1 The reference is to the author of Ars ca tholicae fidei, of the end of the 12th century, probably Alain de Lille; Patr. lat. 210, col. 607 608. vertatur in veritatem humanae naturae). Why have modern theologians, accept ing the Lutheran split between nature and grace, almost completely abandoned this vision of the world, natural frame work and spiritual milieu of the action of men at work? The historical dimen sion which we have to add today, far from reducing its value, multiplies it, just as a third dimension transfigures the surface of space without deforming it. 'T'oday's circumstances invite Chris tians to rediscover, in this new di mension, the forgotten vision of their forefathers, which in truth was the bib lical vision of nature. We analyzed cer tain special aspects of our situation at the outset: the revolution of work, which has been effected by the pressure of dis coveries and new techniques, has brought about a serious stock-taking, often bit ter, but which is based on the truth of things and the truth about man. The proletariat has been the battleground of this coming to consciousness. In fact, the four open perspectives, from the passage from the tool to the machine, in the transformation of work, have vin dicated this evolution, and have shown us, along with the new laws of work, the area of their temporary setback: ra tionalization, the profit economy, con centration, the march of history, have worked together to produce a proletar iat. Its revolutionary consciousness re gains (but could betray) a scientific con sciousness of the functions of work in the 20th century. It is in this conscious ness that, like psychology, sociology, or metaphysics, the theology of work could be developed. It is not by chance, nor by the sole fact of multiplied individual failings, that the world of labor is the nerve cen ter of positive atheism, which is so dif ferent from the bourgeois atheism of</page><page sequence="8">182 CROSS CURRENTS the libertines or the philosophes. It is a more serious atheism, but also a great deal more significant.1 In the very de gree to which man has been alienated through his work, he has lost God at the same time as himself. Work could no longer have a religious meaning for him, because he no longer had a hu man meaning. To restore his density to him, instead of applying various exter nal moral correctives (and political cor rectives are the most equivocal), would be, theologically speaking, to re-establish him in his cosmic and human function, and in the framework of God the crea tor. We certainly must not divinize work; but those who succumb to this idolatry, which destroys persons and denies God at the same time, are act ing only to satisfy their need of the sacerd. This deception occurs partly be cause theology no longer knew how to consider work as an "object" worthy of its attention in the destiny of men. A reawakened theology will quickly discover its resources and the objects of its inspiration: Man and the universe: work is lo cated at their junction, as well as at the junction of spirit and matter. Man is master of the universe: the place of God, the vocation of man, according to the formulas revealed in Genesis. This should be seen not as an initial pre historic episode (with a purely static transcendence of God, with nature pre fabricated and unchangeable), but in a cosmic unfolding of the divine plan. Man is a collaborator in creation, and the demi-urge of his evolution in dis covery, exploitation, and the spiritual ization of nature. This action on na ture (work) is a divine participation, even in its risk. The homo faber belongs by right to Christian humanism, if not to "classical" humanism. The machine 1 Cf. Maritain's essay on modern atheism, in The Rartge of Reason (Scribner's). is the instrument of this creative under taking. Man himself: He is composed of spir it and matter. Soul and body are not simply in juxtaposition, not joined ex ternally; the emergence of the immortal soul does not reduce the unity of this common life. We may even speak of a consubstantiality of freedom (spiritual) and determinisms (material, technical, economic). Work creates the "human" by the conjunction of the growth of techniques and the consciousness of free dom. The fabricating reason is not oth er, in its spiritual root, in spite of the difference of methods and functions, than the contemplative reason which is master of interiority. The total economy of salvation: The cosmos enters there, through man, pre cisely through the transforming fact of man. The eschatological perspective takes place, in spite of the rupture of death, and does not eliminate the earth ly perspective. The former can act as a brake on a naive and erroneous op timism. Finally, the Incarnation. God made man: everything that is human is mate rial for grace. If work takes on a human stability (but only then), it enters into the economy of grace; it enters there twice, both as work of man, and as prin ciple of a community, which is also a world of grace. The Incarnation con tinued; the Mystical Body of Christ; this theme which from now on will be classic for a spirituality in which the world will find its equilibrium and its Christian position, and not simply by the acquisition of merits. Is this a new spirituality? No, it is that of Genesis, of St. Thomas, St. Paul, of our primary dogmas. But with what an accent, and with what human mate rial it can be renewed! For too long Christians have not taken consciousness of these implicit powers, and their spir</page><page sequence="9">Μ. D. CHENU 183 ituality, like their apostolate, has con tracted into "the interior life." St. Aug ustine, master of this interior life in the West, has nevertheless had the sense of the dimensions of the universe and of man, in space and time. In any case, the Christian heritage includes a cosmic spirituality, of which work is one of its axes. The "civilization of work," as has already been said of the 20th century, the civilization of technics, would in His service be wonderful material for the grace of Christ. We have come to the moment at which the simple and ordi nary man has access, by his very status as worker, in the kingdom of God. Translated by Joseph Ε. Cunneen</page></plain_text>
