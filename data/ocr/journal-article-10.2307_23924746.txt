<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Literature &amp; Theology, Vol. 7, No. 1, March 1993 AFTER THEOLOGY: END OR TRANSFORMATION? Pamela Anderson After theology conceived as male and patriarchal, feminists may propose an end or a transformation of theology. In this era of postmodernism, posthumanism, post-histoire... 'post-theology' could mean either 'wither' or 'whither' theology. In order to explore these alternatives I would like to consider Daphne Hampson's Theology and Feminism (1990). This work does not address the challenges of postmodernism, but it does call for a certain end to Christian theology and, at the same time, a transformation of theology which would make it compatible with feminism. Hampson's theological work can help us recognise ways in which feminism and post modernism both converge and diverge. As a self-confessed post-Christian Hampson proposes an end to Christian theology insofar as it is based upon the unique revelation of Jesus as the Christ and the accompanying myth of Christ. This is a patriarchal myth whose symbolism has, as Hampson argues, distorted human religious awareness.1 Put simply feminism is incompatible with the central male symbolism of traditional Christianity. A transformation is clearly necessary, but Hampson insists that—whatever the new terms—this symbolism cannot be transformed for feminists without ceasing to be Christian. The argument of Theology and Feminism is for discarding Christian revela tion and christology, while exploring the possibilities of feminist anthropo logy and perceptivity of God. By perceptivity of God Hampson means natural theology which, in more contemporary terms, may be conceived according to women's experiences of relationality and of connectedness with creation.2 In a revealing passage Hampson admits, Whether the quality of women's experience tends to be different, such that they may want to speak of God in other ways than do men, it must be difficult to know... Women have thought their thoughts within the context of a patriarchal society, dominated by a patriarchal religion. What I think we can say is that some of the thought forms which have developed, not least within feminism, in recent years, may be peculiarly suited to expressing what we mean by God. Thus a realisation of relationality and of connectedness may well allow us the better to conceive ... what we mean by self and what we Oxford University Press 1993</page><page sequence="2">AFTER THEOLOGY 79 mean by God... What would seem to be crucial is the question as to whether we can learn to perceive... the presence of God in our world.3 Hampson thinks it possible that women's experiences are different from men's and that their perceptivity of God, once freed from a patriarchal religion, may offer new insight for theology. Hampson distinguishes her theological position from all Christian femin ists by claiming that Whereas Christian feminists want to change the actors in the play, what I want is a different kind of play.4 Again postmodernism does not inform Hampson's post-Christian desire for a different kind of play. This does not lessen the relevance or significance of Hampson's work. However I do think that a question emerges: what 'play' is being discarded in Theology and Feminism? Hampson has insisted that she utterly rejects a reading of her work as that of a liberal feminist whose argument only rules out conservative Christianity. Yet I continue to read the Christianity which this work discards as that of conservative theologians. These are theologians who must maintain that the Christian God, who is uniquely revealed in history, is ineradicably male and that the subordination of women is intrinsic to faith; consistent with a liberal feminist position, Theology and Feminism rejects such faith for lack of human equality. I will support this reading with an elucidation of Hampson's assumptions concerning female self-identity, history and God. Her assumptions can be shown to resist a more radical conception of Christianity. I aim to reveal this resistance by demonstrating—more generally—that these assumptions do not make her theology amenable to challenges for a radical transforma tion of tradition. In the demonstration to follow I consider three postmodern challenges which can be described as the death of the human subject as an universal rational being, the death of history as a totality which justifies the fiction of man's progress and the death of metaphysics as the real ground of truth beyond all particularity and change. Closer consideration of Hampson with reference to these 'deaths' of the human subject, of history and of meta physics indicates certain problems with, as well as possibilities of, Theology and Feminism. My ultimate aim will be to indicate new direction for the transformation of theology compatible with feminism. With regard to the postmodern 'death of the subject' it must be granted that Hampson does not naively replace the essential male subject with an essential female subject. In the section entitled 'Renaming God' Hampson realises that many women, not least those who are feminists, would be</page><page sequence="3">8o PAMELA ANDERSON worried by 'female language about God which conjured up some essential nature of woman'.5 Yet I would contend that Theology and Feminism slides towards an universal—essentialist—conception of female experience as evident in its use of such works as those of Nancy Chodorow and Carol Gilligan. The problem with this is that Chodorow, Gilligan and Hampson each—however different—suggest that a distinctively female identity may be discovered and universally defined in contrast with a distinctively male identity.6 Perhaps it is impossible to avoid essentialism and still be able to talk about women's experiences and/or identity. Yet it is precisely such essentialist assumptions which are being brought into question by the post modern death of the subject: the radical challenge for feminists is to recon ceive subjects according to difference rather than an essential identity without losing altogether women's subjectivity and agency.7 Ironically both Chodorow and Gilligan may have been initially hailed as non-essentialists. Chodorow gives a social explanation of male and female instead of assuming essential biological differences; Gilligan bases her work on empirical data collected in her research on girls and boys. However essentialist conceptions of gender identity have been shown to be assumed in each of these cases.8 Similarly an essentialist conception of gender identity would seem to underlie both Hampson's proposal for a feminist anthropo logy and her reconceptualisation of God. I would contend that, first of all, an unwarranted sense of identity haunts Hampson's approach to a feminist theological anthropology. Hampson makes direct references to Chodorow and Gilligan in support of her view that differences between men and women may extend cross-culturally.9 This would suggest that gender is isolatable from other elements of identity; consequently a sense of a shared identity could be given to women across lines of race, class and ethnicity. Second, Hampson is willing to consider that a central difference between female and male identity has to do with the degree to which one is and sees oneself as being in relation to and/or connected with others. Yet this idea of relationality tends to promote an unwarranted sense of a shared community of women across lines of race, class and ethnicity. It has become highly problematical in feminist debates to assume this sense of a community.10 But this is precisely what Hampson must assume if relationality is to be one of the ways in which women might rename God. As quoted earlier Hampson remains open to the possibility that 'the interest feminists have shown in the relationship of the self to its world may enable us to think in subtle and complex ways about that relationship between what we mean by self and what we mean by God'.11 The decisive problem with these assumptions is that our own personal histories, which are characterised by differences and often harmful divisions, indicate that a shared identity and a shared community do not follow merely</page><page sequence="4">AFTER THEOLOGY 81 from the fact of our having become women. Becoming a woman simply does not mean acquiring an universal female nature [Hampson herself claims to agree with this]! But to insist on this point should close off the possibility of assuming an essential identity or community of men and/or women. Now this would be to claim a version of the death of the universal subject. With reference to the postmodern call for the 'death of history' Hampson definitely discards christology, which is at the heart of Christian tradition, and so the view of history implicit in christology—in which 'God could intervene... or be revealed through particular events... or through a particu lar person'.12 However, she does not seem to recognise the significance of engendering new historical narratives. I would maintain that a feminist would want to uphold a weak version of the postmodern end of history. Not histories but the dominant male fiction of an history of progress is to wither away. The task for feminists would be to engender historical narrat ives which would challenge the unity, homogeneity and linearity of the dominant white male history with the fragmentation, heterogeneity and varying pace of different temporalities experienced by persons of different gender, race, class and ethnicity. Hampson does not see history in the light of any such task. Here I think Hampson leaves herself open to being read as a liberal feminist who retains the conservative Christian male view of history only to reject it outright. Consider two illuminating examples of this. For one, Hampson criticises Rosemary Ruether's attempt to elucidate a thread of 'the prophetic liberating tradition of Biblical faith as a norm through which to criticise the Bible'.13 Not only is this a fruitless endeavour according to Hampson, but she insists that when a sacred history is threaded through history then this 'golden thread approach' fails to confront the theodicy question.14 For her the question to pose a Christian is: 'why has history been what it has been and given what history has been what may be said of God's intention in relation to women?'15 She also views with skepticism Ruether's project to make women's experiences visible in the context of a new canon com prised of texts from various religious traditions, as well as from different social, cultural and historical points of view.16 Ruether brings together various texts and illustrations by/on women from the ancient Near East, the Hebrews, the Greeks, the New Testament and marginalised communities on the fringes of Judaism and Christianity. Hampson's criticism of this collection is: 'I fail to see how these can be named "our" experience?... Women [today] can scarcely use these images, can they, as vehicles through which to reach God?'17 But is this the right question? Instead Ruether may be offering a means to reread the tradition which does not focus strictly on patriarchy. A counter-response to Hampson could be: shouldn't one endeav our to recognise different women's experiences of God in order to avoid</page><page sequence="5">82 PAMELA ANDERSON the construction of a God in one's own 20th-century white middle-class... image? I realise that Hampson rejects Ruether's project in order to avoid both essentialism and separatism but, ironically, I believe that she avoids neither. I will return to this. For another example, Hampson is suspicious of the theological intention behind Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza's work.18 While finding little fault with Schüssler Fiorenza's reconstructive 'her-story' Hampson rules out her idea of'the universal solidarity of sisterhood' because it is far-fetched.19 I would agree insofar as this assumes some sort of universal female experience. However, Hampson's real criticism of Schüssler Fiorenza is different from this. She contends that the only reason Schüssler Fiorenza wants to look at the women of the earliest church is because she herself remains a Christian. Hampson argues, If one is Christian, one must, in some way, make reference to Christ. For a feminist, the most obvious way in which to do this (for Christ is a male figure) is to make reference to the earliest community of disciples, particularly the community of women. It appears to be a clever move to make. It is however to evade the issue as to whether Christianity and feminism are compatible... It is of significance that one finds mention of Christ to be singularly absent from Schüssler Fiorenza's work... she gives the impression that, by looking to the earliest community of women and men, she has found a way for women to be Christian.20 Hampson asks, 'But why (if it were not for the fact that one is a Christian) should one be wanting to stay with the experience of women within the biblical tradition'? Again I might further concede that we are not so trapped that our only option is to re-read the biblical text. But Hampson seems to rule out any historical re-reading of women's experiences, whether in different traditions or not, as noted above in her criticism of Reuther; I use re-reading in a hermeneutical sense which is not restricted to a dominant— e.g. homogeneous male—narrative of history. Hampson's rejection of Christian feminism implies the necessity to separate from Christian tradition and history as irredeemiably patriarchal. The only alternative is to cast off history which represents male domination and oppression; in Theology and Feminism there is no option to deconstruct or to reconstruct this history. Although Hampson claims that in special cases 'one remains in dialogue with the tradition',21 her proposal to deny the revelation of God in history and to rely on the perceptivity of God in present experience begins to appear—however ironically—ahistorical and separatist. This is true if one perceives God primarily in the present relationality and connectedness of women, e.g. in the effectiveness of prayer.22 With regard to the postmodern 'death of metaphysics' Hampson remains</page><page sequence="6">AFTER THEOLOGY 83 a metaphysical realist. She wants God to remain the real ground of truth and of our connectedness, although not an entity or an anthropomorphic agent.23 Hampson confesses that I should have no difficulty in saying, with Julian of Norwich, of God, that God is one 'in whom my soul standeth'. Furthermore I am—as a feminist interested in coming into my own—excited by the possibility of taking up the daring words which Catherine of [Genoa] is reputed to have uttered: 'my real me is God'.24 Perhaps it seems odd in light of what was concluded above concerning the end of history that Hampson does cite Julian of Norwich and Catherine of Genoa—women from the Christian tradition. Yet this is not to say we need Christianity or its symbolism, as Hampson goes on to explain: we must find a way to capture our experience of God in the language of our day... There is nothing to prevent our taking up past conceptualisations of God if we wish. But we are not constrained to do so if new thought forms appear more persuasive... But [in fact] ... that we shall need a highly articulated mythology and symbolism, such as Christianity employs, would seem to be unlikely.25 For Hampson the language of our day needs to be used to very literally capture our experience of God. As a metaphysical realist she intends to bring forth empirical evidence for belief that there is a ground of experience which should be named 'God'. Not only is Hampson's view foundational ist—and so the object of the postmodern critique of metaphysics—but her conceptualisation of God seems to be opened to the earlier modern critiques of religion from Kant to Feuerbach, Marx, Nietzsche and Freud. We reach with this point a completely different question which is, nonetheless, intimately related to all three postmodern deaths. This is the question of language. Whether we consider Hampson's claim that our language should capture God and, as she also says, 'that for me the word "God" refers',26 or her claim that the male symbolism of Christianity cannot be transformed without ceasing to be Christian, she seems to assume that language is univocal. Such an assumption is rejected by postmodernists; the polysemy of language may be understood in various ways. Belief in the absolute literalness of language would seem to be extremely difficult for anyone to maintain post-Freud. Yet Hampson seems to offer an univocal reading of Christian male symbolism which remains static and in opposition to a female construct. Hampson would not insist that the core symbolism of Christianity can only be understood in one way if her assumptions on language were different. Constructs of language—including symbols, myths</page><page sequence="7">84 PAMELA ANDERSON and narratives of self-identity—have been recognised to possess a multipli city of meanings, ambiguities, plays which are not always coherent. For this reason a more radical feminist should be able to challenge the dominant narratives of patriarchy—i.e. the totalising account of history—with the engendering of new heterogeneous narratives and new non-linear interpreta tions of old narratives.27 In the terms of the Bulgarian French psychoanalytic linguist and semio tician Julia Kristeva, for instance, language is a heterogeneous process. After Marx, Nietzsche and Freud Kristeva recognises the language-using subject as decentred, overdetermined and differentiated. Both language and the subject are in process.28 Kristeva has no conception of female gender identity but she speaks of marginality and subversion.29 Women dominated by a patriarchal order are understood as marginal; the need in situations of domination is to deconstruct the opposition between masculinity and femin inity—and not to invert the form of sexism. Kristeva sees the destructive nature of a metaphysical belief in fixed gender identities; she remains uncompromisingly anti-essentialist. Patriarchal symbolism may be subverted by transcending the traditional opposition which names 'masculinity' and 'femininity'. Any individual subject is constituted as a play of differences and meanings which cannot be conceived in an universal sense. The acknow ledgement of a subject who is decentred, over-determined and differentiated by language would render impossible an unwarranted ideal of shared iden tity or community. This returns us to the postmodern death of the universal rational subject, as well as to the previously stated criticism of the identity and community of women. We can see that, in contrast to Kristeva, Hampson does not incorporate difference into her account of the subject nor is she able to recognise her own essentialism. My conclusion is that Flampson suffers—in spite of her intentions—from being overly exclusive. Ironically her openness to con ceiving spirituality in terms of relationality and connectedness is accompan ied by an exclusiveness. By discarding symbolism—which includes all myths of creation, fall and salvation—Hampson appears to lack a meaning ful framework for renaming religious awareness. Although Hampson would want to deny the description of her work as that of a liberal feminist who retains a conservative view of Christianity only to denounce it, Theology and Feminism appears to fit these categories due to its lack of more radical conceptions of the subject, history and experience. The realism which characterises Hampson's feminist ethics, anthropology and spirituality seems ahistorical and separatist. By ahistorical I mean being defined by present— relational—experience of God. By separatist I do not mean an atomistic individualism nor necessarily an exclusive female experience, but a position</page><page sequence="8">AFTER THEOLOGY 85 which sets itself apart in being selectively determined by particular experi ence^) of God. Hampson herself says of feminist separatism that it is often an attempt to create something new in the midst of the old. This means that if one is to operate according to a radical equality it may be necessary to put a temporary distance between yourself and society; separatism is not necessar ily permanent.30 I applaud Hampson's idea of feminists endeavouring to create something new in the midst of the old. I have tried to indicate that a feminist postmodern critique of Christianity would lead to the creation of trans-signifying narratives; these narratives would be constitutive of new forms of sacred praxis.31 Theological traditions need not be cast off. A radical transformation of traditions is different from a decisive rupture; and a weak version of the end of history would allow for engendering historical narratives. A transformation of Christian tradition and history would imply that new heterogeneous narratives subvert the male Christianity which Hampson opposes. If, in this process, the identity of Christianity is radically changed we should not worry—even if it ceases to be Christian in Hampson's sense of the word. It makes more sense to me to transform symbolism which is patriarchal and exclusive than to seek the possibility of a distinctive experi ence on which one might build a feminist theology or spirituality. The inclusive goal would be to deconstruct traditional texts in order to recon struct narratives which transcend the dualities of gender and sex. It is unlikely that theology will meet the postmodern challenges to the subject, history and metaphysics if based as Hampson suggests on present—rela tional—experience.32 REFERENCES 1 Daphne Hampson, Theology and Feminism (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1990) pp. 2-3; also see Hampson, The Independent 13 July 1991. 2 Ibid., p. 166.
