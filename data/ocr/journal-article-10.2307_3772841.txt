<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Religion and World View of the Marghi James H. Vaughan, Jr. University of Cincinnati The concept of "world view" implies that societies organize natural and super? natural phenomena into integrated, meaningful systems?what might be called philosophic systems. Though the process of integration is unquestion- ably psychological in nature and permeates all behavior, the system is mani? fest most clearly in the sociological institution of religion. Since our interest is so broad, it is important that we consider both the ideational and the behav? ioral components of religion, that is, both theology and ritual. This is particu? larly necessary in this presentation, for each aspect emphasizes a different, and somewhat contrasting, relationship between the natural and the supernatural. The world view is indicated only in the integration of the two. The Marghi, one of the highland tribes of Northern Nigeria, are found in the Mandara Mountains, which form a part of the border between Nigeria and Cameroun, and in the adjacent Chad basin of Nigeria. They do not pos? sess a homogeneous culture?partly because of several distinct historical tradi? tions among the clans, partly because they are organized into autonomous and frequently hostile kingdoms, and finally because of differential acculturation with Muslim tribes to the north and west. The central and eastern kingdoms are, however, relatively homogeneous and unacculturated. The material here- in is drawn from the eastern Marghi, who are considered, both by themselves and by other Marghi, to be the most conservative branch of the tribe. Theology Marghi theology recognizes three classes of supernatural beings or forces. The supreme supernatural entity is iju, the ultimate cause of all, both good and bad. In some myths, proverbs, and figures of speech, iju is personalized, but on the whole the term is better translated "fate" than "god." Since iju is omnipotent and omnipresent, it is beyond the manipulations of men. There is no logical system which encompasses iju; a scoundrel may prosper, or a good man fail, and the explanation is iju. When an individual suffered a dramatic, accidental injury, he was consoled by comments of "iju, iju." Inquiry re? vealed that two things were implied in the comments: first, that the accident was attributable to iju and, second, that the victim's survival was likewise at? tributable to iju. Iju is not, however, intimately concerned with the lives of individuals. One 389</page><page sequence="2">390 ethnology of the most widely known myths recounts the alienation of man and iju. Ac? cording to this myth, in the beginning man and iju (personalized in this myth) lived together, iju providing food for all, but through the carelessness and ingratitude of a woman the daughter of iju was fatally injured, and he withdrew from the world of men for all time. This tale validates the remote- ness of iju. Despite the supremacy of the power of iju, it is a generalized power, only implicitly concerned with daily routines and the problems of men. The raison d'etre of all is iju, but this fact exists as an unspecified axiom un- derlying all other theological concepts. The other two classes of supernatural beings are less remote and are ac? tively malevolent or mischievous. The good which they do is entirely passive; that is, they do good by not doing evil. It is significant, I believe, that neither of them is believed to be present in the afterworld. These supernaturals are anthropomorphic in habits though not always in appearance. They are more manlike in personality and are capable of being pleased or angered. They also have places of residence in proximity to man. The importance of these spirits and their localized nature give Marghi religion a distinctly provincial charac? ter; it is a religion bound to specific places. This provincialism, which is un- doubtedly characteristic of other societies, has important implications for at? tempts to understand social and cultural change among societies of this type, but these lie outside the scope of this paper. The first of these classes of supernaturals is comprised of the yal. They are the most dangerous of spirits, capable of causing serious illness and death. They live in extraordinary places?in unusual rocks or trees, in springs or caves, or occasionally atop deserted mountains. Clairvoyants {sal\ur) have in the past revealed some of the specific residences of yal. These bear thereaf? ter the names of their residences and form a group which we might call "pub? lic yair Usually priests {zuli) look after the shrines of these yal and conduct annual ceremonies which recognize and attempt to placate them. Public yal are associated with the villages near which they are found, and the priesthood is usually hereditary in the senior clan of the village. In a sense such a yal be? longs to the village, and in some cases where mountain villages have become deserted the zuli must return annually to the shrine of the yal?a fact which emphasizes the provincialism of the religion. Another class of supernaturals is called shatar. They are quite similar to yal except that they are less dreadful and occasionally only mischievous. It is said, however, that a shatar can give a person to a yal. There are no "public shatar,,f and though they are thought to be more numerous than yal they are in many ways less specific. Shatar are not named, they have no shrines, nor are priests associated with them. Although shatar have no specific abodes, ant hills are in general considered to be their residences, and one often sees offerings left there. One type of shatar is more specialized?the %i\yuwi, dwarfs who live in tiny compounds in the earth. (The walls of their allegedly deserted com- pounds are occasionally found and look suspiciously like cross sections of large water pots.) These dwarfs are notorious for causing people to become lost. It is said that they urinate across paths and that when one crosses such a spot the</page><page sequence="3">RELIGION AND WORLD VIEW OF THE MARGHI 39I world becomes reversed, right becoming left, etc. The only way to reorient oneself is to place one's left foot on an anthill. Ancestor worship has a place in Marghi religion, though more as an append- age than as an integral part. Only the most recently deceased ancestor is re- vered and believed to have any direct sway over the affairs of the living. The eldest living son is the keeper of the shrine of a deceased father, while a de? ceased woman's youngest son keeps her shrine. The attention paid to female ancestors is trivial and not universal among the Marghi. The ancestral shrine is used only once a year, and in general there is only a minimal concern for the ancestors in a religious context. The afterworld, ivuhu (ivu, inside; hu, grave), is vaguely conceived. There is agreement that it is a place very much like this world and is located in the mountains to the east. Ivuhu is a better world, a world without hunger and sickness, though it is not the paradise of Christian belief. The souls (mambpl) oi all persons go to ivuhu, though there is some disagreement as to what hap? pens to an evil person once there. The Marghi do not seem overly concerned with the notion of good versus evil or with divine punishment. It seems pos? sible that evil may simply be expurgated. Mambdl must work and farm and, in general, live as do mortals. Many logical difficulties are resolved in reliance upon iju, who will "judge" all disputes in ivuhu. In the organization of Marghi theology iju is the locus of all power. Men may question and supplicate, yal and shatar may execute, but everything is caused by iju. We must caution again, however, that a theology and its struc? ture are not the totality of a world view. Ritual Overt religious behavior can be divided into public and private ceremonies, neither of which occupies a large portion of the people's time. Most of the pub? lic ceremonies and some of the private ones are calendrical, but others vary with circumstances or the needs of the individual. The number and name of the public ceremonies vary from kingdom to kingdom, but there is a consid? erable similarity between them, in function if not in form. The ceremonies briefly described herewith are the principal ones in the Kingdom of Gulagu, and this paper will attempt to cover only the major events. The Marghi calendar begins with the new moon near the end of March or the beginning of April. There is no rationale for this beginning, though we may note that it virtually corresponds with the first moon after the vernal equinox and that during this month the first rains of the new year may be ex? pected to fall. One ceremony occurs during this month, but, since it bears such an intrinsic relation to the ceremonies of the past year, we shall discuss it as the last of the public ceremonies. The major religious ceremony of the Marghi is yawal, a three-day festival occurring at the end of the fourth moon. All planting is completed by this time. The rains are at their peak, and the fields and mountainsides are green with the growth of the new year. Formerly this was the time of the year when wars were fought, and?significantly, I believe?it was traditionally the time</page><page sequence="4">392 ETHNOLOGY when the Marghi killed or forcibly removed the old king and installed their new one. Yawal is a time of virility and growth. The ceremonies are notable for the feasting that accompanies them. Large quantities of beef are consumed, although the Marghi do not in general keep cattle. The feature of the first day's ritual is the sacrificing of the "spirit cow" (mambdl thla) by the king, who performs the act wearing the traditional dress of a ram-skin loin garment and a cape of hyrax skin. In addition, his head is uncovered, and the royal hairlock is plainly visible; at no other time may subjects see the king's head uncovered. The meat from the "spirit cow" is divided ritually among the members of the king's council, who are repre- sentatives of clans and other divisions of the kingdom. The second day's ceremonies begin before sunrise when the king throws a lighted torch into a tree, an act which is interpreted as prophetic of the coming year. If the torch should quickly go out or fall from the tree, a poor year would be indicated. This is followed by dancing, by mock battles, and finally by a staged combat between the uninitiated boys and the adult males. The boys withdraw from the royal village and then march on the royal com? pound. After refusing to be placated by an offering of food from the king, which they eat nonetheless, they attack the men of the village, who are dc- feated. After further dancing the people adjourn to their homes to gather in neighborhood groups for feasting. The king sits outside his compound during these activities, encouraging the dancing and fighting, and retires only after taking a mouthful of food. This event is likewise unique, for ordinarily no one is permitted to observe the king eating; there is even a legend of a king who fled his kingdom in shame after having been tricked into eating in public. The main feature of the final day of yawal is a "miniature" grain thresh- ing. Three heads of guinea corn are threshed with tiny sticks, as a drummer sets the pace of the work and the spectators drink beer and chat. The corn is deposited in the king's granary, and a goat is sacrificed. In all respects this is identical to the threshing ceremonies which will occur after harvest except that the amount of corn threshed is restricted to only three heads. The second major ceremonial event is the boys' initiation {dd\wa). Because of the general festivity involved, this affects virtually everyone in the com? munity for at least two days. It occurs one month after yawal and consists of a one-week mountain retreat and a less formal period lasting for the rest of the month. This custom is more appropriate to a consideration of rites of pas? sage (Vaughan 1962), and its complexities are too great for the present dis? cussion. The arjgarawai is a harvest ceremony which takes place during the eleventh moon and features females, particularly new mothers. In many ways the cen? tral role belongs to the king's senior wife, called thladawa, who in general plays an important part in the ritual life of the kingdom. In this ceremony the women, with their infants on their backs, go out along the paths into the fields and return, dancing and singing, to the king's compound. They are led by the birma, the royal steward, who is a slave. He carries a sword and a basket in which are placed a ceremonial sickle and three heads of corn?those which</page><page sequence="5">RELIGION AND WORLD VIEW OF THE MARGHI 393 will be threshed at the next yawal. The thladawa walks behind the birma dressed as though she were a young maid and carrying a calabash of food. They all salute the king, after which the ceremony dissolves into general danc? ing and beer drinking. The final public celebration in Gulagu occurs at the end of the first moon. It is called digu digal, "great threshing." On the morning of the selected day the three heads of corn are again separated from the king's harvest, and the remaining corn is threshed in the conventional manner. This is the last thresh? ing of the year; soon it will be time to start planting again. In the afternoon the people gather in front of the royal compound, where the king, in his most elaborate dress, sits and talks with the visitors. When the crowd is sufhciently large, he takes his sacred staff and moves away from the royal compound to the edge of the fields. All the men in attendance then go and "bring" him back to his compound. They lead and he follows; no one may remain behind ?not even observing anthropologists. He is the last to come from the field, the last to enter the village. The men then dance, and there is a great deal of drinking and conversation. On the whole, the participants in this ceremony are males as those of the arjgarawai had been female. There is but one other class of public religious observances, and these are not a part of the calendrical cycle of ceremonies. From time to time, in re? sponse to forebodings, warnings, disasters, or the like, villages or kingdoms de- clare an asada\a or holiday, during which no work is done and individuals may propitiate the yal and shatar with sacrifices and offerings. (The same term is used among some Marghi to designate a particular funeral celebration, by others to denote any holiday from work.) Individual ceremonies frequently overlap public ceremonies. In all individ? ual ceremonies the proper dress for males is a ram-skin loin garment. Marghi shrines, typically, are specially made pots called tiwa?usually six to eight inches in diameter with narrow elongated necks. Each man has one such shrine, called iju hir (kir, head), at which he should sacrifice a goat once a year during the month of the yawal celebration. These sacrifices are for the general well-being of the compound and thus in practice tend to be confined to household heads. Theoretically, however, a man may sacrifice at his iju \ir at any time after his initiation. A similar shrine is the \optu tada (\optu, shrine; tada, father), at which the eldest son must sacrifice each year. The ceremony takes place on the day following the iju \ir custom and is considered to be more important. Men not infrequently sacrifice goats to their hoptu tada but only cocks at their iju \ir, and it is said that if a man can perform only one sacrifice it is better to render the former. This, however, probably implies less about the relative im? portance of ancestors and iju than it does about Marghi notions concerning respect toward fathers. The \optu tada shrine is usually slightly larger than that of the iju \ir, but the distinctive difference is the occurrence of two or three small protuberances on the upper portion of the pot?two indicating that the deceased's first child was female, three that it was male. The \optu tada shrine is preserved more carefully than the iju \ir and is kept outside the owner's house, often in a tiny house of its own. Otherwise the ceremony is</page><page sequence="6">394 ETHNOLOGY quite similar to that at the iju \ir. A mother's shrine {\optu mama) is rarely an liwa; it is often only a piece of broken calabash and at most receives a sac? rifice of a hen. On the whole this custom is very irregularly and incompletely observed. A \optu bzir {bzir, children) is usually only the neck of a cooking pot placed to the right of the entrance to the compound. A chicken is sacrificed at this shrine on the first day of yawal and on the seventh day following the birth of the child. This custom is manifestly intended to insure the good health and well-being of the youngest child in the family, but by extension it applies to all children in the family. It is probably a minor fertility shrine as well, for in one instance during yawal I observed a barren woman performing a rite at the household \optu bzir. The remaining category of ceremonies is that of private, noncalendrical ap? proaches to the supernatural, which in fact constitute the major part of Marghi religious behavior. All things are caused by iju, of course, but misfortunes, including illness, are quite likely to be due to yal and shatar. Since these latter spirits are amenable to human intervention, almost all misfortunes are met by attempts at propitiation. In practice, routine and common illnesses are usually treated from a common store of knowledge without reference to supernatural powers, but more serious or unusual illnesses require both symptomatic and causal treatment. To the Marghi causality is supernatural. Misfortune in gen? eral is directly referable to supernatural causation, and the specific super? natural cause is usually determined by a diviner. The term for diviner, maU aga, is also the word for crab, undoubtedly because the most common mode of divination utilizes a crab. Once divination has indicated a cause for the ill, the diviner suggests a course of propitiation for its alleviaton. Occasionally a client requires a personal medicine for his protection or to increase his abilities, but the most common prescription of diviners is an offering. Two types of of- ferings are recognized: nadhsu (nadln, coarsely ground guinea corn; su&gt; thing) and zibdsu or zibsu (zibz, to come out; su, thing). The former is usually some form of grain or seed, whereas the latter is an offering of meat, prefer- ably from a sacrificed goat or chicken. The following generalizations about offerings are based upon observations but do not form a conscious part of Marghi belief. There is a correlation be? tween the type of offering and the seriousness of the problem, zibzsu being more powerful than nadhsu. Similarly, there is a tendency for zifosu to be as? sociated with yal and nadhsu with shatar. In addition, it would seem that women often offer nadhsu, whereas zibpsu, and certainly sacrifice, are ren- dered by men. Funerals, too, are a part of ritual life, though, like initiations, they might better be discussed as rites of passage. Funerals require community participa? tion, primarily dancing and singing. The entire village participates in intense public mourning, which lasts for about 24 hours or until interment. General mourning continues for at least seven more days, but this is observed more in fashion and decorum than in overt mourning behavior. The funeral itself is energetically cathartic; mourning is vigorous, and references to "the long journey," death, and iju are frequent. Mourners at funerals frequently carry</page><page sequence="7">RELIGION AND WORLD VIEW OF THE MARGHI 395 sprigs of thorn to protect them from loitering evil spirits. The frailty and un- certainty of life are made apparent to all who attend. Though religion permeates their lives, the Marghi do not spend a great deal of their time in overt religious behavior. The public ceremonies occupy only seven days. The more formal individual rituals add only two more, since the \optu tada and \optu mama rituals occur on the same day and the \optu bzir takes place on the first day of yawal. The variable ceremonies, the asa- da\a or rest days, funerals, and individual propitiations account for the greater part of the religious life of Marghi. Asada\a may vary widely, but a range from five to ten days is possibly typical. Funerals are less variable, ex? cept that the older one becomes and the wider his contacts the more funerals he is likely to attend; an adult male may attend perhaps twelve per year. The actual number of days devoted to specific supernatural propitiation is not great. This fact may, however, be misleading since two other circumstances seem more indicative of the importance of individual propitiation. First, the ominous threat of misfortune and illness is so pervasive and persistent that it constantly intrudes in thought and behavior, so that the potentiality for this type of religious behavior overrides its actual occurrence. Second, the distri? bution of such behavior throughout the population is such that everyone is constantly aware of it, quite apart from his personal involvement, thus giving it greater importance than might be assumed from the involvement of partic? ular individuals. The calendrical ceremonies, both public and private, are not directed to im? mediate or conscious ends. In most instances no overt reason is given for hold? ing them. Plausible interpretations of them have doubtless occurred to the reader, but the aims of this presentation are served if we indicate that these ceremonies all establish or reafnrm the relationship of man and iju. The bene? fit sought is the general harmony or well-being of the world. This lack of specificity perhaps explains why many of the ceremonial acts have little mani? fest meaning; they are mere parts of a total configuration toward a general- ized end. The variable ceremonies are directed more toward specific ends. They are therefore more concerned with yal and shatar than with iju. Funerals and asada\a, to be sure, may be thought of as reaffirmations of the relationship of man to iju, but they are always closely tied to specific misfortunes and crises and thus actually emphasize the importance of the relationship of man to yal and shatar. Since the variable ceremonies, as previously indicated, constitute the most pervasive part of Marghi religion, we may conclude that the empha? sis of Marghi ritual life is on the malevolent yal and shatar. This is in opposi? tion to the primacy accorded iju in Marghi theology. World View An understanding of the way Marghi view the world is possible only if we accept the prevalence of both the fatalism manifest in their theology and the individualism apparent in their rituals and see the relationship of each theme to the other. The greatest strength of Marghi philosophy may lie in the inte-</page><page sequence="8">396 ETHNOLOGY gration of these contrasting themes, which may be summarized as follows. Iju is an omnipotent power, but it is remote and impersonal. The affairs and fortunes of individuals are only generally the concern of iju and are much more directly and explicitly governed by yal, shatar, and occasionally the an? cestors. These powers are much more personal in their habits and specific in their actions, and they are not intractable but may be influenced by the cere? monies of men. Consequently, despite the fatalistic theme of Marghi theology, man is not helpless in the face of misfortune caused by supernatural powers, except to the extent that all things are, in the end, preordained by iju. This system, which is typical of other West African cultures (cf. Fortes 1959), per- mits man to attempt to control his fortunes while it offers him a final expla? nation of human failure that does not destroy his belief in the efficacy of reli? gious ceremony. This explains the activist system of ceremonies which masks a fatalistic theology. Man may engage in propitiatory ceremonies for the al- leviation of specific ills without contradicting his ultimate reliance upon iju. As a consequence of these contrasting themes, the Marghi are extremely re- served, even defensive, in their religion; and because it forms the basis of their world view, defensiveness permeates all their behavior. Each act of pro? pitiation masks a semiconscious awareness that such an act may be futile. Though they never give in to passivity, they seem always to expect the worst. Looked at from another point of view, this attitude might be characterized as a means of control whereby they attempt to prepare themselves for the even- tualities of life. This view is illustrated in the frequent and casual references to pregnant women as "dead women," a practice which prepares them for the possibility of death in childbirth. By predicting, as it were, this unhappy even- tuality, they attain a measure of control over the situation. It is preferable in some instances to have a known unhappy destiny than simply an unknown destiny. At a spot on a trail leading to a large market one may puli a leaf and place it upon a rock and thereby incur the fate of this coming market day for future market days. Clearly, the Marghi have a low tolerance for ambiguity. Comparable attempts at control are manifest in interpersonal relations as well. Any action which makes an individual uncharacteristically dependent upon another?particularly an unrelated person?is an obvious manifestation of loss of control and hence creates an intolerable situation. Consequently arguments are interminable, for no one will admit to being bested. Individu? als are reluctant to ask the simplest favors for the same reason. Requests are usually made through an intermediary or are phrased so indirectly that the favor may be granted without the recipient's having made an overt request. Public embarrassment is a dire event, and the Marghi carefully avoid causing embarrassment to others. The only cases of suicide known to me followed em? barrassment. Conspicuous pretense characterizes some of this defensiveness, since certain patterns seem to indicate a lack of concern in the very things about which the Marghi care the most. Pretense or masking is an impprtant part of their be? havior. The more one emotionally invests in a thing, the more one has to lose should it be removed; and the more one loses, the more he loses control of the situation. This pattern is evident in the characteristically deprecating com-</page><page sequence="9">RELIGION AND WORLD VIEW OF THE MARGHI 397 ments concerning infants. The zibumbwa (zib, to come out; umbwa, house) ceremony make the same point somewhat more subtly. This ritual, which takes place seven days after the birth of a child, and at which the child is seen publicly for the first time, marks the social birth of the individual. If the infant dies before this ceremony, it is as though it were never born; biological birth counts for naught. It is, of course, during these seven days that death is most likely; thus in a sense the probability of a child's social survival is increased by delaying its social birth. If the child dies before the ceremony, people can deny that, socially, it ever lived and thus lessen their loss. This world view is adaptive for the circumstances in which the Marghi live. The high rates of infant and maternal mortality, the rates of morbidity, and historical conditions of warfare, slavery, and exploitation are reconciled with their own activist traditions. Their religion and world view reflect these cir? cumstances but in turn provide the rationale for pursuing their way of life. They perceive a world, not of their making, full of natural and supernatural dangers. But their conception of the relationship of man to supernatural per? mits them to meet these dangers. Should they fail, then that was their fate, but they succeed in enough instances to insure the persistence of their beliefs. Such a world view is tolerant of changes in natural or material conditions. which the Marghi meet with characteristic aggressiveness. On the other hand, it is a world view rigidly intolerant of changes that threaten its philosophic basis. The importance of a society's world view is indicated in these observations, for it goes beyond the field of religion. A world view is more accurately a ma? trix which channels and encompasses the totality of cultural experience. It is a part of the unconscious basis of the process of social life, as relevant to discus? sions of cultural change as to discussions of cultural content. BIBLIOGRAPHY Fortes, M. 1959.
