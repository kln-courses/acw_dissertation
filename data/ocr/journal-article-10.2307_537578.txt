<plain_text><page sequence="1">I72 Vol. 77, No. 304 Journal of American Folklore April-June, I964 Schutzgeister und Gottheiten des Wildes (der Jagdtiere und Fische) in Nordeurasien. By Ivar Paulson. (Stockholm: Almqvist &amp; Wiksell, I96I. Pp. 3I5, Abbreviations, list of sources, $I2.00.) American ethnologists have been well aware of the importance of animals in Indian myth and ritual. However, beast and bird have been treated chiefly in relation to their effect on men in the vision or the strife for hunting prestige. Paulson's book explores the nature of animals as it appears to the primitive mind. Do they all, or only the important species, have souls? Is there a collective species soul? And what is its connection with gods in animal form or with anthropomorphic gods who protect animals? The book, Spirit Protectors and Divinities of the Wild, has an imposing bibliography in languages of Eastern Europe as well as of Western Europe and America. The material it presents shows the world of early northern hunters as a single culture area extending from Northwest America and Northeast Siberia far to the west and south until its usages are obscured and lost among the agriculturists. How much further it may once have extended is left to conjecture. One prominent element in this culture, mentioned in all American studies of Indians, is that of the Animal Owner, a being of supernatural power who sends his "people" out toward the good hunter and withholds them from one who has broken taboos. Paulson finds this Owner in full force among the hunting people of Siberia though sometimes belonging only to one species as does the Walrus Mother of the Coast Chukchi. Toward the west and south of Eurasia, where there is contact with more complex cultures, the concept becomes more general. There is a spirit of the Forest, the Sea, or the Mountains, disposing of all animals in his district-or sometimes hers. Finally, there may be anthropomorphic gods, who look after fishermen and hunters as well as their prey. Or perhaps a supreme deity is patron of all. This is an interesting progression and Paulson asks, "Was there originally a supreme deity whose functions became divided and sub-divided?" The American material is proof to the contrary. Our hunting Indians had no general Sea and Forest gods and few anthropomorphic ones except Sedna and Moon Man of the Eskimo. (A corroboration of the theory that Eskimos came later than most Indians and from a different environment?) In view of this lack of general concepts, the question of a supreme being whose functions were gradually subdivided fades away. "It is clear," says Paulson, "that the Species Owner is an elemental basic phenomenon from a common hunting stage." This opens an interest- ing field for study and speculation. Have our Indians, because of their long separation from the more complex cultures of the Old World, preserved some primitive traits once widely distributed but lost or obscured in the older countries? When Paulson goes on to a discussion of the exact nature of the Species Owner, we are in deeper waters. Is the Owner a specially large animal of the species with some super- natural power? Is he a supernatural being who can take animal form? Is he a collective species soul? Few Indians have ever been asked such questions, and the inquirer in America must often do his own deducing from myths and vague-seeming statements. The most systematic study of the question was made by the Swedish ethnologist Hultkrantz ("Conceptions of the Soul Among North American Indians," I953). He and Paulson agree that in North America as in Siberia, animals, like human beings, have two souls: a body soul which dies with the body and a free soul which may be reincarnated. Perhaps this idea of the individual free soul is even older than that of the species soul, for among all northern hunters the soul of an individual bear is honored after its body has been killed. One wonders whether the decorating of a dead deer by the Zuni and of a whale by the Nootka come under the same heading. This belief in individual souls, Paulson suggests, may have been the basis on which developed the concept of a collective species soul. He proceeds to a careful analysis of the individual and the species soul in animals and</page><page sequence="2">of man's relation to them. In using hunt magic, to which soul does the hunter appeal? Most of our ethnographies are vague on this subject, quoting songs or spells addressed to "the deer" or "the whale." Speck has gone furthest into the matter, stating that the hunter, before his expedition, must overpower the souls of the game by drumming and singing. Ray has mentioned that, on the Plateau, he must master the guardian spirits of the animals. Here is another field where, surely, there is still information to be gathered. A further problem is that of the identity of the guardian spirit in animal form who appears to vision seekers. Paulson takes it for granted that this is the species Owner and has even some quotations to that effect. In America, however, the Visitant may be Ghost, Cloud, or perhaps the spirit of War or Wealth. Writers on the subject have been interested in the psychology of the visionary rather than in the exact nature of the Visitant. This new angle of approach from the Old World may renew interest in an already well worked field. Denver, Colorado RUTH M. UNDERHILL FOLKLORE IN AFRICA Umbundu, Folk Tales from Angola. Collected and translated by Merlin Ennis, comparative analysis by Albert B. Lord. (Boston: Beacon Press, 1962. Pp. xxix + 316, preface, appendix, glossary. $7.50.) Yes and No, The Intimate Folklore of Africa, Dilemma Tales, Proverbs, Stories of Love, and Adult Riddles. By Alta Jablow, introduction by Paul Goodman. (New York: Horizon Press, 1961. Pp. 223, foreword. $3.95.) The President of our Society once remarked that "readers of non-Western oral literature are ... about as rare as nuclear physicists who read Bulgarian poetry." Like translated jokes, printed tale texts have usually lost most of their point and savor. These two collections of African tales, in their relative comprehensibility, may attract the growing audience bent on a greater understanding of the too-long-Dark Continent. Both collectors spent years in Africa, Mr. Ennis as a missionary in Angola, and Mrs. Jablow as an anthropologist and wife of a UNESCO representative in Liberia, so their lamentably brief notes on the settings and functions of their material in its cultural context are straightforward and informative. Both collections have curious introductions, Yes and No a wary cross-cultural discussion of narrative style and content by the novelist Paul Goodman, and Umbundu a struc- turalistic "comparative analysis" of themes and formulas in Angolan, Babylonian, Greek, Finnish, and yes, even in Bulgarian oral literature by Albert Lord. Dorson (CA IV:io9) found this latter attempt "naive" because of Lord's seeming unawareness of the worldwide occurrence of most of these Angolan tale types. Both works also classify the tales, Ennis by characters and Jablow by forms, both include small proverb collections, and neither attempts the "scholarly courtesy" of indicating type and motif designations. Yes and No is essentially an anthology "culled" from the standard West African collec- tions plus texts collected by the author in Liberia. Her technique for "reconstructing" the tales for publication deserves immortality as a model of its kind: "Knowledge of the creative role of the narrator has provided me with the insight necessary for the recon- struction of those tales . . . which I found recorded in the earlier volumes of published folklore as bald and unadorned plot sequences, as well as those which are in my notes in similar form. I have adhered rigidly to the known framework of African storytelling in content, style and characterization, and I have transcribed in the pattern of the West African teller of tales" (pp. 28-29). Would that she had outlined that "known framework" which is valid across West Africa, or indicated more clearly her concept of the mechanisms of the creative role of the narrator. Jablow's primary concern is with dilemma tales, a somewhat rare form which ends on a moot point allowing the audience to decide the just de'nouement.
