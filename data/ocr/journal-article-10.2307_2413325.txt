GREHAN AND RUTH AINSWORTH Zoology Department, Victoria University of Wellington, Private Bag, Wellington, New Zealand Abstract.-In the panbiogeographic evolutionary synthesis, orthogenesis is referred to as a process which involves an inherent tendency to vary in certain directions, as ancestors vicariate or break apart into descendants. Orthogenesis has origins in the studies of form, but is given a biogeographic perspective in panbiogeography. The panbiogeographic use of orthogenesis is compatible with the origin of the term as presented by Haacke and Eimer. Misinterpretations of orthogenesis describing it as mystical, teleological and linear are invalid. The orthogenetic aspect of evolution was recognized by Darwin as "laws of growth," but was neglected in favor of natural selection. Although an internal component to evolution is recognized by contem- porary biologists, it is often considered to be secondary to natural selection. Where recognition is given to an internal tendency for evolution to proceed without requiring the action of natural selection, terms such as "constraints," "bias," and "potential" may imply orthogenesis. [Ortho- genesis; panbiogeography; biogeography; vicariism; evolution; dispersal.] The orthogenetic idea that evolution has its own inexorable internal momentum forcing lineages beyond the limits of natural selection is obviously absurd [Dawkins and Krebs, 1979:507]. In due time all theories defending orthogenesis were refuted [Mayr, 1982a:530]. I can accordingly understand that some naturalists may wax "religious," and speak of orthogenesis in mystical terms; others indulge in philosophical abstractions in regard also of the same orthogenesis etc. Naturally, I do not see the need for my part to follow in their company, but I do believe that, whatever we intend and believe, we had all better be clear about the substances here in play [Croizat, 1958:165]. In contemporary biology it is the bio- logical synthesis "panbiogeography" which brings orthogenesis to the atten- tion of the biologist as a necessary and useful concept. In the panbiogeographic synthesis, evolution is recognized as hav- ing an internal component that produces a tendency for evolutionary change with- out natural selection being required as a driving force. The result of the interaction between orthogenesis and the environ- ment is adaptation, with extinction as the alternative. The term "orthogenesis" has a relatively long history and varied usage, but in contemporary orthodox evolution- ary theory it has received almost universal condemnation and is referred to only in a historical context. Panbiogeography (Croizat, 1958, 1961, 1964a, 1968, 1975) presents a biogeograph- ic method, and a synthesis of ideas on pro- cesses concerning the evolution of animal and plant forms over space. By the study of distributions and linking together lo- calities of related taxa, patterns of dispers- al emerge and analysis of these patterns provides an insight into how animals and plants evolve under natural conditions. As an independent science with its own methods and principles (Croizat, 1964a: 708), panbiogeography provides a biogeo- graphic basis for understanding evolution without prior commitment to any evolu- tionary theory. Given the stark contrast in attitudes concerning orthogenesis (see quotations above) and the recent interest being shown in panbiogeography and Principia botanica, we believe the time is ap- propriate for a review of the panbiogeo- graphic concept of orthogenesis. The mer- its and methodology of panbiogeography in relation to other disciplines will not be considered here, but relevant discussion is presented in a number of papers (Craw, 1978, 1982, 1983, 1985; Heads, 1983, 1984, 1985a, b; Craw and Gibbs, 1984; Craw and Weston, 1984). It is not the purpose of this paper to "prove" orthogenesis, but to compare the panbiogeographic concept of orthogenesis to the original meaning of the term, and to show why we believe the criticisms of orthogenesis to be misdirect- 174</page><page sequence="2">1985 ORTHOGENESIS AND EVOLUTION 175 ed. We will then discuss orthogenesis in relation to the concept of "constraint" which is receiving increased interest in contemporary evolutionary theory. ORTHOGENESIS AND PANBIOGEOGRAPHY When attempting to interpret and ex- plain the origin of plant and animal dis- tribution patterns, the biologist is imme- diately confronted with the question, "What process is responsible for the evo- lution of new forms?" This question is of particular concern when attempting to understand vicariism, where related taxa are now found in different localities so that they replace each other in space (compare with Darwin, 1872:318). Darwin's (1872: 320) evolutionary theory emphasized a process consisting of speciation in com- mon "centers of origin" from which species migrated according to their differ- ent "means of dispersal." Within this process, the role of natural selection was given priority with adaptation and com- petition producing new and better adapt- ed species. A major focus of Croizat's pan- biogeography was to test Darwin's theory by analyzing the patterns of dispersal that exist for present geographic distributions. Croizat found that the dispersal patterns were not only highly repetitious, follow- ing the same basic "channels," but were also independent of purported "means of dispersal" for the taxa involved. This pat- tern did not conform to a process of dis- persal from centers of origin and conse- quently Croizat recognized a need for a re-evaluation of the evolutionary process. To explain vicariant distributions, Croi- zat (1958) proposed the existence of a broadly distributed ancestor which estab- lishes its range during a period of "mo- bilism" as ordinary means of survival be- come means of dispersal (Croizat, 1964a: 213; Craw, 1978:105). The ancestor breaks apart or fractures as a consequence of dif- ferent evolutionary trends taking place over its range, and the descendants, there- fore, have evolved in the different locali- ties they now occupy as if there had been actual migration between them. Subse- quent disjunctions of the descendants oc- cur through "extinctions" in the formerly contiguous range. In this evolutionary framework, dispersal is seen as a process that gives rise to distribution through form-making rather than actual migration of the descendant taxa. Vicariism or vicar- iant form-making is not to be confused with "vicariance" which refers to the di- vision of a formerly continuous popula- tion by the appearance of a barrier (Nel- son and Platnick, 1981:45). The implication of vicariant form-making for our under- standing of an evolutionary "mechanism" is that we must look for a process that will establish change in form in the ancestor over a "wide" area and not at some spe- cific "point" or "center of origin." The ne- cessity for this approach is illustrated by the panbiogeographic interpretation giv- en for the dispersal of the woodpecker subfamily Picumninae and the lizard fam- ilies Iguanidae and Agamidae (Croizat, 1958, 1961, 1964a, 1975). The dispersal of the Picumninae in- volves four genera and 30 species (Croizat, 1971:137). The majority of species are grouped into the genus Picumnus with 25 species in the New World and one in southeastern Asia. The three remaining genera are: Nesoctites with one species in the New World (Haiti); Verreauxia with one species in Africa; and Sasia with two species in southeast Asia (Fig. 1). The dispersal of Picumninae forms part of a standard pat- tern (compare with Gnetum; Croizat, 1958: 146), oriented with respect to the Atlantic and Indian Oceans as indicated by the baseline drawn in Figure 1 (see Craw [1983: 433] for discussion of the baseline con- cept). What makes the woodpecker exam- ple stand out is the disjunction of 13,000 to 16,000 km between the lone Asian P. innominatus and the remaining bulk of the genus Picumnus in the New World. How- ever, this distance is only impressive when one attempts to explain P. innominatus as a derivative of the New World representa- tives or vice versa. Croizat (1968:320) explained the "out- lier" as the result of a pre-Picumninae ancestor (family "Picidae") forming the</page><page sequence="3">176 SYSTEMATIC ZOOLOGY VOL. 34 FIG. 1. Dispersal of Picumninae genera: Picumnus (stipple), Nesoctites (darkened), Verreauxia (horizontal lines), and Sasia (vertical lines). Baseline (solid squares joined by line) of dispersal in Atlantic and Indian Oceans. subfamily Picumninae by the process of vicariant form-making giving different genera from Guatemala to Borneo. Each genus "originated" over a broad front of ancestral distribution, so that Nesoctites evolved in what is now Haiti, Verreauxia in Africa, Sasia in southeastern Asia, and Picumnus in both the New and Old World. The origin of P. innominatus is no more a "derivative" of the New World Picumnus than are any of the genera from each oth- er. The process of ancestral vicariism means that some "individuals" or "popu- lations" evolved into a Picumnus in the Orient instead of a Sasia or Verreauxia, etc. Evolution is therefore seen as a process of "level," the generalized pre-Picumninae giving way to the relatively specialized genera Nesoctites, Verreauxia, Sasia and Pi- cumnus which in turn "dissolve" vicari- ously into species, etc. That Picumnus turns up "twice" is a consequence of a process of form-making, which is not dependent on immediate derivation by migration. In- stead, Croizat (1968:320, 1978:137) attrib- uted the origin of taxa to particular com- binations of characters that are now used to "define" each group. This combination happened to "duplicate" Picumnus such that it is represented strongly in the New World and weakly in the Old. Croizat's support for a widespread Picumninae ancestor was not based on a commitment to any geological theory, but was derived from biogeographic evidence on biologi- cal relationships and distribution. This in- dependence of biogeographic analysis from geology was in direct conflict with the leading evolutionists of the time (com- pare with Croizat, 1958:Chap. 3, 1984a). The dispersal of the Iguanidae and Agamidae (Fig. 2) presents a homologous pattern to that of the Picumninae, as in- dicated by the Atlantic/Indian Oceans baseline. The Iguanidae has its principal diversity in the Americas, and three gen- era occur widely disconnected-one in Tonga and Fiji, and two in Madagascar. In contrast, the Agamidae occur in the Old World, but not Madagascar. Overlap with the Iguanidae in Fiji was recorded by Bar- tholomew et al. (1911), but not by Goin et al. (1978) or Brown and Gibson (1983). The process of dispersal responsible for the vi- cariant pattern, and the "outliers" of the Iguanidae, is the very same as for the Pi- cumninae. An ancestor common to both the Iguanidae and Agamidae existed over the present range of the two families and exhibited both iguanid and agamid char- acters. The populations in the New World retained or emphasized various features which we identify today as iguanid char- acters (small postfrontal, pleurodont-</page><page sequence="4">1985 ORTHOGENESIS AND EVOLUTION 177 FIG. 2. Dispersal of Iguanidae (stippled) and Agamidae (vertical lines). Baseline as in Figure 1. homodont dentition, etc.; Romer, 1956:534) and, therefore, separated out of the ances- tor as Iguanidae, while the Old World populations emphasized agamid features (loss of postfrontal, acrodont heterodont dentition, etc.; Romer, 1956:537) so to be- come Agamidae (Croizat, 1958, 1961, 1975). The concept of a generalized ancestor of both agamid and iguanid characters agrees well with Romer's (1956:534) comment: "Two typical families are separated main- ly on the basis of dentition (with which the geographic situation agrees), and some fossil forms do not sort readily into either" (italics added). The reason why there are iguanids in Madagascar, Tonga, and Fiji is not because they are derived from the Americas (com- pare with Blanc, 1982:41-43; Brown and Gibson, 1983:323) by "means of dispersal" across oceans or continents, but because of a common tendency in the populations concerned to evolve from the pre-agamid/ iguanid level of evolution to that of the modern families regardless of local envi- ronment. This is not "parallelism" in the sense of an "independent" acquisition of characters (Gosliner and Ghiselin, 1984: 258), but a common orthogenetic potential giving rise to iguanids in Madagascar in exactly the same manner as for the aga- mids or iguanids in their respective main ranges. The species of Iguanidae in Mad- agascar may be considered as much "true" iguanids as those of South America, re- gardless of differences in detail. The fossil record shows that in the Eocene the Agamidae was represented in the Ameri- cas (Moody, 1980) and the Iguanidae in Europe (Smith, 1935:130), a situation no different from the Picumnus outlier found in the distribution range of Sasia today. Each of the above biogeographic exam- ples of vicariant form-making demon- strates a process of evolution that occurs over a "wide" area of ancestral distribu- tion. This process is more than an "exter- nal" or environmental influence such as natural selection because the particular evolutionary trends of each descendant has proceeded in the face of many different environments. This process is capable of giving rise to the same descendants more than "once" without there being any nec- essary contact between them. While there may be different adaptations, these are held within a directional change in vari- ation which proceeds regardless of envi- ronment. This directional, non-environ- mental (nonadaptive) change is called orthogenesis (Croizat, 1958:165, 1964a:678) and a particular taxon, therefore, owes its identity of structure (type of organization) to a common orthogenetic tendency pro- ducing a change in level of evolution from the ancestor to descendant. The reason for the occurrence of different directional ten- dencies is that the ancestor itself is not a</page><page sequence="5">178 SYSTEMATIC ZOOLOGY VOL. 34 homogeneous unit or "species" but a het- erogeneous mix of characters, either in po- tential (morphogeny) or actual structure (morphology), which are "clumped" over the ancestral range. This clumping of the ancestral potential forms a "main mass- ing" whereby the evolution of the descen- dant forms tend to emphasize different lo- calities (e.g., iguanids in the New World, agamids in the Old) through different combinations of ancestral characters. The origins of the main massing do not lie with any particular taxonomic entity but arise through periods of "mobilism" and "im- mobilism" of ancestral forms. The ulti- mate origins of the tendencies forming the main massing may be very old and greatly antedate the appearance of particular taxa as recognized by formal taxonomic or technical criteria. In the "genetic potential hypothesis" of Schwabe and Warr (1984), it is recognized that the potential direc- tions of evolutionary pathways may have been determined at the initial formation of living organizations. Orthogenetic variation does not mean that there is no "natural selection" but, be- cause there is a tendency for variation to proceed in certain definite directions re- gardless of environment, natural selection is understood to have a different role from that ascribed by Darwin (1860, 1872). In a living organism, patterns of interaction with the environment are recognized, which we will refer to as adaptation after Simpson (1949:143), Croizat (1964a:678) and Lewontin (1978). The relationship of adaptation to natural selection can be rec- ognized in the way there are different kinds of adaptation in different environ- ments. This kind of relationship was re- ferred to by Croizat (1964a:711) as "envi- ronmental form-making." Because such adaptations are clearly correlated to differ- ent environments and are seen as "useful" or "advantageous" to the organisms, the evolutionary process might be attributed solely or principally to natural selection. However, adaptation to different environ- ments can be recognized as subsidiary to an underlying pattern of variation which owes its origins to a process of vicariant form-making which has proceeded in cer- tain directions regardless of local environ- ments. The orthogenetic process giving rise to structure is called "structural form-mak- ing." Together, structural form-making and environmental form-making provide the basis for adaptation. For any adapta- tion to environment (environmental form- making) to be possible, an organism must already be adapted in the sense of having the "appropriate" structure. The relation- ship between the two processes was illustrated by Croizat (1964a:681) with the formula: Organism + environment = ad- aptation. In terms of the evolutionary pro- cess, therefore, adaptation was understood by Croizat (1964a) as the "result" of the process: Orthogenetic tendencies acting regardless of environment + environ- ment = natural selection. This means that the role of natural se- lection is determined by orthogenetic ten- dencies coming to interact with a partic- ular environment (Croizat, 1964a:681). Natural selection operates within the lim- its and directions set by orthogenesis so that structural form-making determines the kind of adaptation which is possible. Some of these structures may be far older than others. For example, the tetrapod limb "type of organization" that determines the way the iguanid interacts with its envi- ronment by a certain kind of locomotion was initially set at the "fish" level of evo- lution (Croizat, 1964a:761). Lewontin (1978:168) claimed that the reality of ad- aptation is to be demonstrated by the "in- disputable fact" that unrelated groups of animals "respond" to similar selective pressures with similar adaptations; he cit- ed locomotion in water as requiring a par- ticular kind of structure. However, Le- wontin (1982:157, 1983:280) argued against his former indisputable fact and, rather than a concept of adaptation to the envi- ronment, supported the view that organ- isms "construct" their environments. For example, Lewontin (1983:283) did not re- gard the evolution of the seal flippers as the solution to some imagined adaptive problem, but rather the very existence of</page><page sequence="6">1985 ORTHOGENESIS AND EVOLUTION 179 such structures makes the aquatic situa- tion part of the seal environment. This view is extremely close to Croizat's (1964a: 709) view that the structure determines the adaptation, but instead of recognizing the orthogenetic origin of structure Lewontin (1983:283) only vaguely referred to possi- bilities such as "gene drift" and "pre-ad- aptation." Although a non-utilitarian ba- sis is accepted for the origin of adaptation, Lewontin (1982, 1983) differed from Croi- zat (1964a) by lacking a broad concept of structural (orthogenetic) evolution. In the context of orthogenesis, the seal flipper is a particular outcome of the mammal limb "type of organization" which, along with other changes, has made the present ma- rine "adaptation" possible. In the context of orthogenesis, all ad- aptation can be interpreted as the inter- relationship between structural and envi- ronmental form-making. This is in contrast with the "taxonomic" approach of Gould and Vrba (1982:4), who classified the evo- lution of structure on the basis of "func- tionality." If the origin of a structure can be ascribed to the present interaction with its environment (function), it is regarded as an "adaptation." If an adaptive story cannot be constructed, then the structure is regarded as an "exaptation," whereby it is claimed that it originated by a historical adaptation, etc. This classification is a di- rect consequence of using standards of "utility," "fitness," and "advantage" as the criteria for evolutionary process and is one which Croizat (1964a:721) objected to, ar- guing that evolution as a "doctrine" is not concerned with welfare or otherwise of any particular individual or group. What is perceived as useful or advantageous to one person may be something quite dif- ferent to that perceived by another and to use such standards would inevitably de- feat clarity of thought (Croizat, 1964a:720). The contrast between the "functional" classification by Gould and Vrba (1982) and "process" classification by Croizat (1964a) can be illustrated in reference to an ex- ample of evolution discussed by both. Gould and Vrba (1982:7) suggested that the fully feathered Archaeopteryx was probably only capable of the simplest feats of flight. They noted that this fact has led some biologists to suggest that the initial development of the feather was the result of selection for thermoregulation while the subsequent development of the contour feather was attributed to selection for in- creased efficiency in predation. In this "scenario," the basic design of feathers was regarded by Gould and Vrba (1982) as an adaptation for thermoregulation, later to become an exaptation for predation, while contour feathers arose as adaptations for predation and exaptations for flight. Analysis of feathers with aftershafts by Croizat (1964a:439) suggested that the ba- sic design was of a composite rather than unitary origin. Instead of a single "feath- er" consisting of the feather proper and an "aftershaft," these structures were in- terpreted as two "feathers" bound togeth- er as a common morphological structure. This observation led to the question: "Why two feathers in one?" The reason Croizat (1964a) offered was that the feather evolved as one orthogenetic development of the ancestral (pre-avian level of evolu- tion) feather or "scale" which became re- structured or reorganized through definite laws of biological structure called "sym- metry," that are the same as those deter- mining the phyllotactic arrangement of plant leaves, petals, etc. (for further ex- amples, see Heads, 1984). An important type of symmetry is that of a 2/5 mode (Croizat, 1961, 1964a:762; Heads, 1984) consisting of a spiral'of two "turns" along which 5 parts are arranged around a central axis of growth (Fig. 3). The term 2/5 is not a mathematical rep- resentation, but an expression of biologi- cal arrangement or symmetric disposition of structure. Croizat (1964a:445) observed that a cross section of the feather base shows the two components to be slightly offset and he noted that where this kind of geometrical asymmetry is found in two leaves or other structures, a further three would be expected to make up a complete 2/5 arrangement. The "modern" bird feather was regarded by Croizat (1964a) as a morphological expression of only two</page><page sequence="7">180 SYSTEMATIC ZOOLOGY VOL. 34 x 5 ox- X3 FIG. 3. Diagrammatic representation of a 2/5 mode of biological symmetry. Five members or structures (1-5) are arranged in a spiral of two "turns." This spiral is organized around a central axis of growth which is represented in the diagram by the cylinder. The sixth member (6) is superimposed above the first and, thus, represents the first of another series of five parts. parts out of a morphogeny which con- tained the potential series of structures ar- ranged in the mode 2/5. The evolution of the feather involved a definite "law of growth" and, therefore, Croizat (1964a) was opposed to attributing the feather to evolution by a "random" event favored by purported advantages of insulation or flight. Functions were regarded by Croizat (1964a) as a consequence of structural form- making so that the bird feather, once formed, could "function" for insulation or flight, etc., as determined by the interac- tion of the structure with its environment. This illustrates the importance of structur- al analysis in understanding the evolution of various features. Gould and Vrba (1982) did not present such analysis but rather adaptationist hypotheses of the very kind that Croizat (1964a) and, ironically, Gould and Lewontin (1979) criticized exten- sively. Gould and Vrba (1982:7, 10) em- phasized that they did not wish to assert the correctness of the hypotheses, but this seems to indicate that the usefulness of "exaptation" is not in how evolution oc- curs but only for further arbitrary, adap- tationist "stories" of the kind Gould and Lewontin (1979) rejected (but both Den- nett [1983:353] and Eldredge [1983:361] identified Gould and Lewontin as conven- tional adaptationists). If the examples are completely arbitrary, do they really con- tribute to our understanding of actual evo- lutionary processes? Is the biologist con- fined to trying to "outguess" the "intentions" of biological processes? This is exactly the kind of danger Croizat (1964a:702) warned of. The reason for Gould and Vrba's (1982) position seems to stem from a theory of evolution consisting of a collection of assorted processes: "The evolutionary history of any complex struc- ture will probably include a mixture of ad- aptations, primary exaptations and sec- ondary adaptations" (Gould and Vrba, 1982:12; italics added). This approach is discussed further below under the term "pluralism." Croizat's concept of orthogenetic evo- lution is neither "gradualism" nor "punc- tuated equilibria," because the process is not determined by a slow steady transfor- mation of entire "populations" by natural selection, nor by small isolated popula- tions giving rise to new taxa by stochastic and other external forces (compare with Eldredge and Gould, 1972:84, 114). The evolutionary rate is ultimately under the control of orthogenesis and can be either "fast," "slow," or in "stasis." THE ORIGIN OF ORTHOGENESIS There has been some confusion over the origin of the term "orthogenesis," some biologists (Bateson, 1910; Lang, 1923; Gould, 1977) attributing it to Theodore Ei- mer, while others (Eimer, 1898:19; Jepsen, 1949; Rensch, 1966; Mayr, 1982a) acknowl- edge the source as Haacke (1893), who presented the term orthogenesis in a chap- ter titled "Orthogenesis und Amphigene- sis." Haacke (1893:31) noted that, in gen- eral, there is an evolution of "higher" organisms from "lower" levels of com- plexity. He suggested that there were two possible processes responsible for the di- rection of variation; it could either pro- ceed in any direction or it followed only</page><page sequence="8">1985 ORTHOGENESIS AND EVOLUTION 181 a "predestined" direction. Haacke's (1893: 32) conclusion was that variation could only proceed in one direction so that structural types such as "mammal" would not revert to ancestral forms such as "am- phibian." This was regarded as a general principle in which apparent "reversions" might occur but they could be seen as sec- ondary manifestations to an overall direc- tional trend. An example of a well-known evolutionary trend, because of the atten- tion it received from Simpson (1949, 1951, 1953), is the reduction of toes during the evolution of the horse. Haacke's (1893:32) view was that, although there may be the occasional throwback in present day horses (i.e., doubling the number of toes), it was out of the question that the modern horse will become five-toed again. Haacke (1893: 32) argued that, in general, if variation could proceed in any direction reversals should have often occurred, such as flight- less birds evolving flight again due to it being "advantageous" at some stage. Haacke recognized orthogenesis as a di- rectionality in evolutionary trends that did not owe its origin to the environment. We therefore disagree with L0vtrup's (1977: 239) description of the principle of ortho- genesis as the theorem: "In a new taxon of superior rank the prominent direction of evolution will give rise to animals with larger body size as long as this is associ- ated with an increase in the PP [popula- tion potential]." According to Haacke (1893), the phe- nomenon of "parallel" evolution could be readily explained in terms of orthogenesis through ancestor-descendant relation- ships, whereby related forms could devel- op along similar orthogenetic tendencies: The statement that evolution occurs in one direc- tion applies however only to the members of an evolutionary succession related through descent in an ascending and descending time; it applies only to the immediately preceding and following line of each individual animal. From one point where a line of descendants splits into 2 or more branches evolution can proceed in several direc- tions, but when a line of descent has forked its branches also often flow nearly parallel. So we see for example that the thumbs of the apes of both the Old and New Worlds tend to retard; and the rodents and insectivores constitute two groups of lower animals whose evolution has to a high de- gree been parallel ... and as such, parallelism can be identified in almost all other related animal groups and not less so for plants [our translation; Haacke, 1893:33-34]. Haacke (1893) recognized an irreversi- bility in evolution as did Dollo (Dollo's Law) in the same year (Gould, 1970). The explanation of irreversibility offered by Simpson (1953:311) and Gould (1970:198) was that the probability of getting a com- plete reversal was statistically so small as to be non-existent. This is in contrast to Haacke (1893), who attributed irreversi- bility to orthogenetic variation. The issue over whether or not there is any such pro- cess as "irreversibility" (see Simpson, 1953: 312) is independent of the issue of ortho- genesis since alternative explanations are possible. The term orthogenesis was adopted by Eimer (1895, 1898:19) for his own use, and he has been credited with the populari- zation of the term (Jepsen, 1949:489; Rensch, 1966:204; Bowler, 1979:40). Eimer (1898) advocated orthogenesis as a univer- sal law of variation in a few definite direc- tions and believed (Eimer, 1898:23) that directions of evolution have nothing to do with utility. This is not to say that the re- sulting structures had no utilitarian value, but the utility of a structure has nothing to do with determining its origin. In Ei- mer's view the origin of variation is non- random, tending to occur more readily in some directions than others, and this being the case the direction of variation itself may control the direction of evolution, with selection playing only a negative role of eliminating harmful directions (Bowler, 1979:40). Eimer's (1898:20) comments il- lustrate the view of directionality: Whereas many plants with non-indented leaves most frequently produce varieties with more or less divided leaves, in the case of other flowers divided leaves are unheard of. No one would ex- pect grass to produce a variety with divided leaves. This emphasis on direction in variation is in terms of the possible range of outcomes being limited and, therefore, determined rather than random. Although differing in emphasis, Eimer (1898:19) believed his</page><page sequence="9">182 SYSTEMATIC ZOOLOGY VOL. 34 concept of orthogenesis to be fundamen- tally the same as that of Haacke (1893). Considerable agreement with Eimer's ear- lier ideas on evolution in one direction being due to "constitutional" causes, was expressed by Haacke (1893:313). Jointly, their works promote a concept of ortho- genesis as a process of internally directed evolution inferred from the range and pattern of variation observed. This con- cept of orthogenesis was supported by a number of biologists such as Rosa (1923), Lang (1923), Metcalf (1928), Trueman (1940), Kappers (1947) and Croizat (1958, 1961, 1964a, 1968). DEBATE ON THE NATURE OF ORTHOGENESIS Dobzhansky (1951:17) claimed that or- thogenesis is a term that has escaped pre- cise definition, and it is possible that this view has contributed to the controversy surrounding it. Similarly, Croizat (1964a: 657) regarded the use of imprecise, as- sumptive vocabulary as a major stumbling block and illustrated this in reference to Simpson (1949:130) who, on the one hand accepted nonrandom evolutionary se- quences, oriented evolution, etc., but re- jected the very same process when under the label "orthogenesis." The term has certainly received varied use (Jepsen, 1949: 489; Fothergill, 1952:166-170, 244-380; Bowler, 1983). Criticisms of orthogenesis are often leveled at particular interpreta- tions, which are either side issues (do not involve the primary concept) or are erro- neous. There are many biologists who have formulated ideas similar to those of ortho- genesis. In particular, we believe it prob- able that some of the principles encom- passed in the term "nomogenesis" (Berg, 1926) are very close to those of orthogen- esis. While such considerations are be- yond the scope of this paper, we direct attention to discussion by Jepsen (1949), Simpson (1950), Berg (1926), Rensch (1966), Riedl (1978:61) and Bowler (1983). Orthogenesis and "adaptive" radiation.- Many biologists have equated orthogene- sis with "straight line" evolution where there is no allowance for splitting of lin- eages or adaptation to different environ- ments (Goodrich, 1924:169; Haldane and Huxley, 1927:217; Shull, 1936:220; Mayr, 1947:293, 1963:670, 1978:42; Romer, 1949: 107; Simpson, 1953:220; Easton, 1960:41; Goldschmidt, 1960:321; Avers, 1974:206; Gould, 1977:84; Riedl, 1978:261; Stanley, 1979:182; Stebbins, 1982:91; Minkoff, 1983: 304). Simpson's (1953) rather caustic view is perhaps shared by many biologists: "Or- thogenesis is a product rather of the ten- dency of the minds of scientists to move in straight lines than of a tendency for na- ture to do so." This is an important obser- vation since the claim that orthogenesis is tied to a straight line has more to do with set ideas than recognition of a basic con- cept of internal directionality. The "fact" of evolutionary radiation as evidence that evolution does not follow in a straight line is one which is not in con- flict with the concept of orthogenesis as inherent directionality. Haacke's (1893:32) concept of orthogenesis was primarily one of direction in a temporal sense and clear- ly encompassed splitting of lineages. Ei- mer (1890:32) very clearly did not associ- ate evolution with a straight line: "The an- cestral tree of organic forms does not rise in a straight line, but has ramose (forked) branchings." The splitting of orthogenet- ically determined lineages was explained in Rosa's (1918) theory of hologenesis as the result of differences in the internal structure or "idioplasm" of the ancestor (Rosa, 1923; Baroni-Urbani, 1979). Radia- tion and orthogenesis are not incompati- ble phenomena and combination of the two means that during radiation ancestral characters form new combinations in the descendants through the process of vicar- iant form-making. Like Croizat (1958, 1961, 1964a), Rosa (1918) supported a process of dispersal involving the fragmentation of a formerly widespread ancestor (this com- mon view has been commented on by Croizat [1961, 1964b, 1978] and Nelson [1973]). While the descendants ("new adaptive types"; Simpson, 1949:140) may necessarily represent a change in the di- rection of evolution they still involve or- igin and divergence within a directional</page><page sequence="10">1985 ORTHOGENESIS AND EVOLUTION 183 stream (orthogenesis) provided for by the ancestral type of organization (Croizat, 1964a:658). Although Bowler (1983:141) accepted the translation of orthogenesis as meaning lit- erally "linear evolution," he made no ef- fort to restrict orthogenesis within this def- inition. Several translations are possible from the Greek word orthos: "straight," "right," "direct," "proper," and "correct" (Funk, 1902; Onions and Craigie, 1933). We suggest that arbitrary restriction to a par- ticular meaning, as the basis for evaluat- ing orthogenesis, confuses words with concepts. In view of both Haacke's and Ei- mer's positions, we feel that if any dic- tionary meaning is to be emphasized it is that of "direct" (variation being direction- al) and "straight" in this sense, rather than a translation to "linear evolution" or "rec- tilinearity." Thus, the patterns of diversity cited by Simpson (1951, 1953) for horse evolution as evidence against orthogene- sis applies only to the restricted view of orthogenesis as a straight line, but does not invalidate orthogenesis as internally directed evolution. Trueman (1940) directed the attention of his paper to the meaning of orthogen- esis, a term which he (p. 78) considered to be frequently misinterpreted. Although Trueman (1940:85) referred to Eimer (1895) as proposing the term orthogenesis "to de- scribe evolution in a definite direction un- der the influence of some internal factor," he did not discuss Eimer's work in detail nor did he refer to Haacke's original in- troduction of the term. We believe, in ref- erence to our consideration of Haacke's and Eimer's work, that Trueman (1940:86) adopted an unnecessarily restrictive defi- nition for orthogenesis (i.e., "by strict def- inition orthogenesis can be recognised when changes are known only in one lin- eage . . ." [italics added]). Orthogenesis, trends and extinction.-This is the aspect of orthogenesis, which often is briefly covered in some undergraduate courses, with the mention of such "clas- sics" as sabre-toothed tigers (Eusmilus, Smi- lodon), Irish elks (Megaloceros), Gryphaea, and other hapless beasts. The connection of orthogenesis with evolution in a straight line has also led to its synonymy with "nonadaptive" evolution (e.g., Dobzhan- sky et al., 1977:242). As a student, one is left with the idea that orthogenesis is re- sponsible solely for trends which result di- rectly in the overdevelopment of certain structures beyond the limit of usefulness, and ends in extinction. This is an ex- tremely narrow view of orthogenesis and is based on anthropomorphic concepts of "usefulness" and "overdeveloped," which lead to insoluble debates (Croizat, 1964a; Gould and Lewontin, 1979). In the context of Eimer's (1898) work "nonadaptive" is not implying "against adaptation" but rather indifference to adaptation (Bowler, 1983:161) and Croizat (1964a:668) de- scribed a nonadaptive trend as a trend not oriented by adaptation. However, some orthogenesists have linked orthogenesis solely to ideas of "racial senility" and "overdevelopment." This link occurred because such phenomena could not be at- tributed to directional selection (Bowler, 1983:161-162). One term used for direc- tional selection is "orthoselection" (Mayr, 1982a:530). However, this term could be regarded as etymologically inappropriate since the prefix "ortho" means that the "selection" can no longer be free but is oriented by that which is directional (or- tho). In this way orthoselection becomes a concept of selection within the limits of orthogenesis (Croizat, 1964a:475), which is quite the opposite meaning from that which was intended. Once the direction of a trend exceeds the requirements of survival (natural se- lection), extinction must result. If a partic- ular "type of organization" is involved, then a nonteleological concept of racial senility may be appropriate, and this has been applied in reference to contempo- rary genetic knowledge by Ycas (1982). Ideas very similar to that of orthogenetic extinction were expressed by Simpson (1953:312), who recognized that evolution can "run into blind alleys, from which there is no turning back ... perhaps some day all will end in a blind alley." Simpson (1953) certainly did not have orthogenesis</page><page sequence="11">184 SYSTEMATIC ZOOLOGY VOL. 34 in mind, but the example serves to illus- trate that the ideas of "inevitable" extinc- tion due to a limited evolutionary poten- tial are not necessarily far removed from some conventional thoughts. While "or- thodox" evolutionists accept evolutionary trends (Stebbins, 1967:139; Dobzhansky, 1970:391; Eldredge and Gould, 1972:111; Dobzhansky et al., 1977:120; Mayr, 1978: 47; Campbell, 1982:192; Gould, 1982a:381), their explanation is not in the form of or- thogenesis. Orthogenetic interpretations of evolu- tionary trends have been attacked as being misinterpretations of the evidence (Simp- son, 1949; Gould, 1972; Dobzhansky et al., 1977), but these misinterpretations were either unrelated to the issue of orthogen- esis (e.g., patterns in the fossil record) or due to a restricted definition of orthogen- esis (e.g., linearity). It has also been ar- gued that, even if a particular trend is not adaptive (i.e., "useful") in its own right, it must be correlated in some way with another aspect of an organism which is adaptive (Dobzhansky, 1951:100). In par- ticular, this view has been applied to the allometric relationship between antlers ("nonadaptive") and body size ("adap- tive") of the Irish elk (Gould, 1977) but, at the same time, it was equally possible to interpret the antlers as adaptive anyway (Gould, 1973:376, 1977:88). We believe that allometry should be recognized as an expression of internally directed change and, therefore, is orthogenetic. To claim that one or both components of the allom- etry are adaptive is to leave the real issue of nonadaptive trends unaddressed. Orthogenesis and mystical forces. -Per- haps one of the most serious allegations made against orthogenesis is that it lies beyond the realm of science. This link was expressed by Huxley (1974:465) who stat- ed: "Most biologists also look askance at orthogenesis, in its strict sense, as imply- ing an inevitable grinding out of results predetermined by some internal germinal clockwork. This is too much akin to vital- ism and mysticism for their liking." A link between orthogenesis and some sort of mystical belief was strongly advocated by Mayr: ... [orthogenesis] relies on some built-in tendency or drive toward perfection or progress. All these theories were finalistic: they postulated some form of cosmic teleology of purpose or program [Mayr, 1978:42]. Eimer, adopting a term first proposed by Haacke, called the "perfecting principle" orthogenesis ... [Mayr, 1982b:529]. Similar thoughts were expressed by other biologists (Bateson, 1910:101; Romer, 1949: 104; Grant, 1963:164; Eldredge and Gould, 1972:97; Gould, 1980a:129; Rosen, 1982:271; Mayo, 1983:4) in marked contrast with Ei- mer's (1898:20) own declaration dispelling any such connotations: Nageli's definitely directed evolution was a purely theoretical assumption, having been based on his equally theoretical and unfounded hypothesis of a principle of perfection. With the principle of perfection, Nageli's whole doctrine falls to the ground. My own conception had nothing to do with it. Earlier, Eimer (1890) realized that his the- ory of evolution was being likened to mystical forces, and he blamed this on his use of the term "internal causes," which had also been applied by Nageli to a te- leological "principle of improvement." Therefore, Eimer (1890:21) altered his ter- minology: Instead of the term "internal causes" I subsequent- ly employed "constitutional causes" in order to indicate that I sought the cause of the modification of forms, not in some fundamental impulse, cor- responding to vital force, but rather in physical and chemical processes depending on the material composition of the body. The mechanism of orthogenesis, there- fore, was seen as a natural process of the material or physical kind with no link to a "mysterious" or "perfecting" force. This distinction from perfection or purpose was also made by Haacke (1893:31), and Lang (1923) argued that, while Darwinians might label their opponents as "mystical," internally directed variation was merely a property of the organism inferred from observation. Griggs (1939:118) recognized that, while some may view orthogenesis</page><page sequence="12">1985 ORTHOGENESIS AND EVOLUTION 185 as due to agencies "beyond the reach of scientific enquiry," there was no necessity for him to follow suit. In some recent evo- lutionary literature there is no explicit ref- erence to orthogenesis, and alternatives to the "modern" evolutionary synthesis are presented as unspecified "vitalist theo- ries" (Patterson, 1978:148), "pagan alter- natives" (Eldredge, 1979:7), and "inner urges" (Stebbins, 1983:823). Orthogenesis has also been condemned as mysterious and/or rejected because there was no known "mechanism" (com- pare with Cronquist, 1951:3; Gould and Lewontin, 1979:159; Mayr, 1982b:529). We regard mechanism as a "process" which is accepted as an explanation in relation to some authority or discipline. In this con- text the requirement of "mechanism" is not a prerequisite for the acceptance of a bio- logical phenomenon (for example, Lov- trup, 1981:153). Often enough the require- ment of "mechanism" is for an explanation from an entirely different discipline to that describing the phenomenon. Thus, we be- lieve that to reject the reality of orthogen- esis on the basis of "no mechanism" is comparable to denying the reality of stan- dard patterns of dispersal because there is no available geological mechanism (Fran- kel, 1984:142). Ironically, such biogeo- graphic information can be used to predict geological mechanisms (Craw and Wes- ton, 1984). Darwin's theory of evolution was based on the inheritance of characters and, although pangenesis was an attempt to provide a mechanism, it was later con- tested without bringing the whole theory into disrepute. The question of mecha- nism for orthogenesis did not receive prominence since the process was not generally accepted in the first place. Yet some biologists did recognize the need for detailed investigation (Shull, 1936:238; Trueman, 1940:90; Cronquist, 1951:4; Croi- zat, 1964a). The contradictions that arise from rejec- tion of orthogenesis because of the lack of an agreed-upon mechanism are illustrated by Gould and Lewontin (1979:593), who reject "unknown and perhaps 'internal' mechanisms" as the explanation for trans- formation of the Bauplane, because this is believed to be "close to an appeal to mys- ticism." However, they go on to support (p. 594) "phyletic constraints" which are said to contain "developmental con- straints" that in turn are the product of "architectural constraints," for which Gould and Lewontin (1979:595) left the mechanism to "future research"! In appar- ent contradiction to Gould and Lewontin (1979), Gould (1980a:129) accepted "inter- nal factors" which "channel and constrain Darwinian forces" but the only "mecha- nism" he offered was a metaphor (Galton's polyhedron) which does not appear to be anything more substantial than the pur- ported appeal to "mysticism" for internal mechanisms (Gould and Lewontin, 1979). According to L0vtrup (1982:239), con- straints are acceptable only on the epige- netic level because in an "empirical" the- ory of evolutionary mechanism we must accept the premise that mutations are al- ways random. On the basis of the "state of the art" in genetics, Dobzhansky et al. (1977:17), Gould (1972:93), and Ruse (1982: 148) have denied orthogenesis. This has the implicit claim that the theory of ge- netic mechanisms was fully understood and in the light of such knowledge ortho- genesis was impossible, and it is well to refer here to a comment by Gould (1977: 165): "'impossible' is usually defined by our theories." In this respect, the "theory" of molecular genetics is still progressing with the explicit recognition of a possible directional component in the mechanisms of genomic turnover that leads to "molec- ular drive" (Dover, 1982:111), which Hes- lop-Harrison (1983:32) regarded as a "rec- ipe" for orthogenesis. Ironically, when genetics opposes orthogenesis it has an el- evated authority for evolutionists, but when it provides evidence in favor, its au- thority is diminished (e.g., Stebbins' [1983: 823] need for "factual confirmation"). Grehan (1983:678) suggested that mo- lecular drive may be one of the mecha- nisms of orthogenesis, but Dover (1983) incorrectly took this to mean equating the</page><page sequence="13">186 SYSTEMATIC ZOOLOGY VOL. 34 two concepts and offered (1983, pers. comm.) the following comment: "I see no connection between the known internal mechanisms of genomic turnover which lead to molecular drive and the unknown mechanisms responsible for some process called orthogenesis for which there is no separate evidence" (italics added). Unfor- tunately, in this context orthogenesis is being synonymized with "unknown" mechanisms which automatically pre- cludes any "known" mechanisms of direc- tionality from association with orthogen- esis. The importance of a biogeographic background to the role of genetic mecha- nisms is illustrated by the way Walsh (1983:467) considered biased gene conver- sion to be unimportant in "species" for- mation since he believed that, to be effec- tive, biased gene conversion required "large" populations, while the predomi- nant view was that speciation required "population bottlenecks." Panbiogeo- graphic analysis shows that important evolutionary processes occur which do not require small populations, and genetic models discussed by Walsh (1983) and Dover (1982) may be significant in this context (compare with Heads, 1983:546). We offer the following conclusions con- cerning the meaning and validity of or- thogenesis: (1) The primary concept of or- thogenesis is one of inherent, internally directed evolution. (2) Orthogenetic "the- ory" recognizes orthogenesis as a primary evolutionary process. (3) Criticisms of or- thogenesis on the grounds of "mysticism," "perfection," "straight lines," and "non- adaptation" apply only to particular uses (or misuses!) of the term and do not in- validate the concept of inherent direction- ality. (4) Orthogenesis is topical and not of historical interest only. (5) Orthogene- sis involves inherent directionality in the transformation of "types of organization" such that there are definite limits to the expression of variation. (6) Since variation is directional it is not "absurd" for evolu- tion to proceed orthogenetically beyond the "limits" of natural selection. In such cases extinction is the result. However, it is equally possible for orthogenetic pro- cesses to produce in those organisms which continue to survive, features which can be anthropomorphically described as "use- ful," "advantageous," etc. Orthogenesis, constraints and natural selec- tion.-Natural selection was only one of a number of evolutionary mechanisms rec- ognized by Darwin (Croizat, 1964a, 1977; Gould and Lewontin, 1979; Grehan, 1984), and throughout the works of Darwin there are repeated, although relatively brief, references to "laws of growth" (see the compilation by Craw, 1984a). These laws of growth refer to a process which was responsible for the evolution of structure independent of natural selection. For ex- ample, when considering flower structure, Darwin (1872:175) observed: We thus see that with plants many morphological changes may be attributed to the laws of growth and the interaction of parts independently of natu- ral selection [italics added]. In spite of the strong support given to Darwin's theory of evolution (albeit mod- ified) and extensive literature on the sub- ject, Croizat (e.g., 1958, vol. 2b:1010-1083, 1964a, 1977, 1981, 1984b) is the only biol- ogist to have scrutinized what Darwin meant by "laws of growth," considered in depth how Darwin treated them in his theory, and examined the consequences of this for modern biology. Croizat (1958: 1059) observed that Darwin (1872:157) was aware of the importance of understanding the effects of "complex laws of growth" providing the basis for subsequent utili- zation by an organism. Thus, there are two interacting factors-one of internal direc- tion, the other being environment-and Croizat's (1958:1059) conclusion was that Darwin's "laws of growth" did not differ in concept from orthogenesis. Darwin's recognition of laws of growth indicates that orthogenesis is not entirely anti-Darwinism (Eimer [1898:16] quite cor- rectly referred to omnipotent selectionism as pseudo-Darwinism), although it is in- congruent with the synthesis that devel- oped Darwin's methodology. The neo- Darwinian view of Charlesworth et al.</page><page sequence="14">1985 ORTHOGENESIS AND EVOLUTION 187 (1982:477) noted the existence of evolu- tionary constraints imposed by character correlations, but they presented this in terms of correlated responses to selection. In contrast, "laws of growth" are distinct- ly independent of natural selection. Nevertheless, Darwin (1860, 1872) did not amplify on the role for "laws of growth" as a central part of his theory. In the sense that Darwin recognized both laws of growth and natural selection, his work is definitely "pluralistic." This situation is expressed philosophically by Gould (1980a: 119): ".... Darwinism as a set of ideas, is sufficiently broad and variously defined to include a multitude of truths and sins." However, even Gould (1981:131) had cause to complain about too much pluralism: "the more you encompass the more form- less you become." We agree with Croizat (1964a:636) and Eldredge and Gould (1983: 444) that support for anything and every- thing may be found in Darwin's works and, to assess his approach, it is more im- portant to concentrate on "general tenor." The general tenor of Darwin's evolution- ism was to emphasize "natural selection," "centers of origin," and "means of dis- persal," although he did later acknowl- edge (Darwin and Seward, 1903:343) that laws of growth superseded the role of nat- ural selection. Instead of "laws of growth," contem- porary orthodox evolutionary theory often refers to the term "constraints" for an in- ternal component in evolution (Grasse, 1977; Riedl, 1978; Gould and Lewontin, 1979; Williamson, 1981; Goodwin, 1982; Lauder, 1982; Leith, 1982; L0vtrup, 1982; Wiley and Brooks, 1982; Katz, 1983; Walk- er, 1983:812). The reference to constraints is usually in relation to morphology and developmental biology, but also is rele- vant to genetics. How much "constraint" may be compared or equated with ortho- genesis depends on how much constraint implies a tendency to evolve in certain di- rections and the role assigned to such a process. Unfortunately, these implications are often far from explicit and interest in constraints does not represent a unified field of opinion (Brooks, 1983:2642), al- though the main emphasis appears to be one of limited possibilities (Lewin, 1980:883; Brooks, 1983:2642). Alberch (1980:660) recognized limits to morphological variability that impose def- inite limits to the role of directional selec- tion. He noted that morphological novel- ties do not appear at "random" and suggested a "mutational" pressure which may produce polymorphisms regardless of selection. Although Alberch (1980:664) believed that developmental constraints set up phyletic trends, external factors were considered to determine the "prob- ability" of fixation. In this context there is an emphasis on morphological transfor- mation within the limits imposed by gen- eral body plans or developmental pro- grams (Alberch et al., 1979:315). These views appear to differ from orthogenesis by requiring an external influence deter- mining "fixation" rather than being due to inherent tendency. Ho and Saunders (1979:589) argued that the origin of phe- notypic variation is the result of interac- tions between the organism and environ- ment during development, but recognized the "internal factors" of physiology and development to be more important in the causation of evolution than the "external factors" of "random mutation" and natu- ral selection. This relationship is similar to that given by Croizat (1964a) to organ- ism and environment but without the ex- plicit orthogenetic context. As indicated earlier, Darwin recognized multiple evolutionary processes, but Croi- zat (1964a) has argued that Darwin failed to synthesize them. Darwin's approach is supported by Gould and Lewontin (1979)-that is, there is both randomness and constraints. In "pluralism," we are faced with a concept of constrained random- --ness, despite its implicit contradictions (Ho and Saunders, 1982:98). When faced with character incongruence for Cerion snails, Gould (1983:19) suggested "independent" evolution and postulated (p. 21) a direc- tional factor: The traits must somehow be coordinated in Ce- rion's genetic program; they must be evoked, or</page><page sequence="15">188 SYSTEMATIC ZOOLOGY VOL. 34 "called forth," together. Some genetic releaser must coordinate the joint appearance of these charac- ters. Does the master genetic program of all Cerions encode alternate pathways representing the sev- eral basic forms that evolve again and again? By itself the mechanism postulated by Gould (1983) could be interpreted as or- thogenetic (i.e., internally directed), but to Gould (1983) the phenomenon is a special case due to the presence of characters which do not match up with the taxonomy of the snails. What is this incongruence in evolutionary terms? The situation is no dif- ferent from iguanids located in agamid territory. Through a common orthogenet- ic tendency from a pre-Cerion level of evo- lution, the "modern" Cerion species come to share characters which do not "fit" in with other characters used in classifica- tion. It follows that if internal directionality can be accepted for incongruent charac- ters, then it is equally valid for congruent ones as well. The internal evolution rec- ognized by Gould (1983) is not confined to just some characters but to all the other characters that go to make up Cerion. Giv- en order or "constraints" on one hand (Gould, 1982b:11), can there be any room for "chance" on the other? Croizat's (1964a: 817) observation was: In sum, call it in any odd way you like dear reader, something overtops "natural selection" which every author-even Darwin and the most staunch dar- winist-is bound sooner or later to stumble against in his efforts. At the genetic level, Mayr (1982a:530) declared himself against "biological laws," yet agreed to the possibility that trends may be necessitated by the "internal cohe- sion of the genotype which places severe constraints on the morphological changes that are possible." How such a phenome- non could be distinguished from biologi- cal law is not elucidated and it is not clear whether his view is meant to refer to directed variation (orthogenesis by "another" name), but given Mayr's (1947, 1963, 1982a) general works, we do not think so. Brooks (1983:2462) appeared to make some distinction between the limited pos- sibilities of constraint that "rule out" some evolutionary options, and the possibility of an "inherent bias in the dynamics of genetic systems, where selection will al- ways be faced with a 'stacked deck' of biased options." To us, the view of inher- ent bias would seem about as orthogenetic as possible without actually using the word. It places the role of natural selection as a secondary process in the same way as did Haacke, Eimer and Croizat. Isolated references are sometimes made to evolu- tion by tendency which are of an ortho- genetic context (e.g., "predisposition in some agamid genera to centric fusion" [Witten, 1983:539]). In the "genetic poten- tial hypothesis," Schwabe and Warr (1984: 482) suggested that evolution is the result of a predeterministic process-cells that possessed all genes for the formation of higher organisms are part of such organ- isms now. Under the genetic potential hy- pothesis, organisms adapt to environment only so far as their genetic potential will allow and, if the environmental condi- tions exceed the potential range of appro- priate variation, extinction ensues (p. 481). Schwabe and Warr (1984:476) recognized an interaction with the environment such that different environmental conditions allow for different expressions of form, but only within the boundaries set by "steric and energetic factors." Although Schwabe and Warr (1984:476) described their hy- pothesis as a new "synthesis" of evolu- tion, we suggest it is basically an ortho- genetic theory of evolution in a biochemical/genetic context. The con- cepts presented in the genetic potential hypothesis appear to be very compatible with the concept of orthogenesis pre- sented in panbiogeography. In contrast to "bias," "genetic poten- tial," and orthogenesis, Gould (1980b:43) espoused "structural integration" which he claimed regards organisms as constrained and integrated wholes and does not deny the fundamental role of natural selection as an agent of evolutionary change. How- ever, this may conflict with the "structur- alist" view given by Webster and Good- win (1982:38), who regarded organisms as</page><page sequence="16">1985 ORTHOGENESIS AND EVOLUTION 189 "wholes" but did not seem to hold a fun- damentally important role for natural se- lection. There also seems to be some con- nection between such views and the teleological frameworks of the 19th cen- tury (Lenior, 1984) and one of the leading proponents-von Baer-was strongly against natural selection as the mechanism of evolution (Lenior, 1982:248). CONCLUSION Croizat (1964a:356) suggested that the denial of orthogenesis is because of a lack of methods and concepts to see it for what it really is. This limitation may have been responsible, not only for the past mis- understandings over orthogenesis, but also for the present debates over "internal" versus "external" factors in evolution and controversy surrounding terms such. as "constraints" and "bias." The importance of panbiogeography to these debates is in its role as a unique critique of Darwinism (Craw, 1984b), and its alternative methods and concepts for the investigation of evo- lutionary processes. For orthogenesis, panbiogeography has provided a distinct- ly spatiotemporal perspective (Croizat, 1964b) and provides a potentially power- ful complement to evolutionary studies on form. It is our belief that panbiogeogra- phy offers substantial clarification of or- thogenesis as part of a general evolution- ary synthesis and, therefore, is of interest to biologists who wish to advance their understanding of biology and evolution.
