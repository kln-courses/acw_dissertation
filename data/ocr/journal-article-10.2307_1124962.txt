<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Theatrical World Of Michel de Ghelderode By AURELIU WEISS The recent death of Ghelderode has awakened renewed interest in his drama. One of the most astounding figures in the contem- porary theatre (a theatre full of astounding figures), his work is characterized by such bizarre aspects as fetishism, living dead men, leaps through time, devils, sorcerers, ghosts, grinning buf- foons, legendary heroes stubbornly destroying their legend, his- torical characters denying the facts of their history, philosophical drunkards, and death as a character in farce. Obsessed by a universe of dark forces in endless ferment, he saw evil and damnation everywhere. Plagued by them, it did not occur to him to attack them with righteous wrath, as did Calder6n and Tirso de Molina, the priest-playwrights of the Golden Age of Spanish drama. In Ghelderode's works the devil is alive and ac- tive. Moreover, if one probes beneath his anxiety, one finds a certain satisfaction, a feeling of tenderness and amusement. Ghel- derode's gift of anthropomorphic animism enables him to see the many incarnations of the forces of evil that fling themselves against man. Even inanimate matter, even objects made by man or machine, are able to hide mysterious powers capable of influ- encing human destiny. In love with the late Middle Ages, Ghelderode cherished the revels of apocalyptic visions, the terrors of fanaticism. A latter-day romantic, Ghelderode sometimes slipped into melodrama instead of the mystery of the Middle Ages, as he believed. Thus, he juxta- posed noisy, uproarious, vividly drunken characters against heroes who were devoid of life, force, or human truth. Contemptuous of 51</page><page sequence="2">52 Tulane Drama Review his own time, Ghelderode felt himself to be a contemporary of pre-Renaissance men; above all he loved what he believed to be their spirit, their way of life, their struggles and aspirations. He was ardently, jealously, and exclusively attached to them, and this attachment took possession of his creative powers, and even of his spare time. He believed these men to be freer and larger in their tumultuous passions than the men of our own day, weakened, frightened, and enslaved by material comfort. No other modern dramatist has clung with such force and per- severance to a single period of history. And so that nothing foreign might disturb this plunge into the past, Ghelderode isolated him- self from everything that could remind him of the pulse of con- temporary life. "I work in a state of hypnosis; if someone speaks to me about what I'm doing, it's fouled up," he said in his pic- turesque language. His is a vast world, created by a tortured imagination. At times he manages to captivate spectator and reader, evoking an un- familiar frisson; at other times, he compensates for the darkness of his vision by comic contortions that are meant to arouse a vulgar, often trivial, belly-laugh which contrasts sharply with refined, complicated, cerebral art. The plays he values most are characterized by verbal abundance, which has been chosen by abstract considerations. Only rigorous cutting and compression could save him from his tendency to- wards empty verbiage. Occasionally, Ghelderode has done just that. Paul Guth has reported that Hop Signor and Chronicles of Hell are "three-act plays concentrated into one act by dizzying compression. Hop Signor was reworked five times," and Ghel- derode would have gained by applying this "dizzying compres- sion" to all his dramatic works. Psychoanalysis aroused his fury, and he condemned all of it, without distinguishing science from philosophy. Nevertheless, his plays: The Death of Dr. Faust, Don Juan, The Actor Makes His Exit, Pantagleize, Christopher Columbus, and even Mademoiselle Jaire are philosophic attempts. His distaste for all knowledge that has contributed to progress is paralleled by the often surprising weakness of his thought. Deprived of all valid culture, his heroes suffer from the illusion that they are thinking profoundly, with-</page><page sequence="3">AURELIU WEISS 53 out suspecting how grotesque their ambitions are. From this illu- sion springs the politico-philosophical babbling of Ghelderode's Pantagleize or Christopher Columbus, their angelic naivet6, their astonishing frankness, their improbable tribulations.,, Most of Ghelderode's heroes are not alive; they are purely intellectual constructions; Don Juan, Faust, Columbus, Pantagleize, and the author Jean-Jacques from The Actor Makes His Exit speak abun- dantly and, endeavoring to reach far and wide, they proclaim their scorn for all the trivialities of the world. Ghelderode's Don Juan is a poor hero who, during a carnival, disguises himself in the legendary masque and costume. "Pitiful, thin, pale, nervous" most of the time he thinks himself the real Don Juan, speaking and acting like a true hero. His Faust, hero of a "farcical play for the music-hall" is not a happier creation. The action of this "farcical play" takes place in Flanders in an "ancient and future" city, at once in the sixteenth and twentieth centuries. That is what has been called breaking the boundaries of time. The disciple of the "doctor" is no longer Wagner, but Cretinus. In this play, Margaret, "a young servant of seventeen," no longer plays at false virtue; and she proves it conclusively in a shabby hotel. Let us skip the details of this poor parody of the Faust legend; it would be too simple to show its deficiencies. Let us leave Faust to his Cretinus, to his devil (Diamotoruscant) and to his ineffable Margaret; Faust and Don Juan are twins, nour- ished from the same philosophic source. If we leave the quicksand of legend to enter the domain of his- tory, we meet Christopher Columbus. He too amuses himself by fusing different eras, crying "Long live Lindberg," and speaking of "gabardine." We see the fragility of the boundary of time; any- thing can violate it. But here the author has taken precautions; it is no longer a drama, but a "dramatic fairy-tale; it should be played quickly, without insistence, from the perspective of dreams." Curious dream! Ghelderode's one-act play The Sun Sets, has as protagonist Charles of Hapsburg, father of Philip II, and under this title (which implicitly denies the fact that the sun never sets on the immense Hapsburg empire) Ghelderode por- trays the powerful monarch, after he abandoned his throne, when he had retired to the Monastery of Yuste, during the last phase of</page><page sequence="4">54 Tulane Drama Review his life. Ghelderode has a curious conception of the greatness of his heroes. From an entire life that fills pages of history, Ghel- derode retains the dubious legend of a man who witnesses his own funeral. In this sense some critics have found a greatness worthy of the most illustrious examples of heroic antiquity. All the foregoing may seem severe, but it reflects my disillusion in re-reading most of Ghelderode's plays. This is an overall view, for it is true that each of the plays contains interesting details. Although the dialogue usually drags, it occasionally quickens, becoming incisive, tormented, rapid, poignant. The most banal ideas occasionally give way to quick striking phrases that reveal keen sensitivity. Painful trivialities follow close upon poetic ex- pressions. Certain traits reveal a born painter. His work is a curious mixture in which everything is piled up chaotically, so that one has to search for the precious stone by digging in a bric-a-brac of capricious contrivances, caricatures, ab- surdities, agitated puppets, meditative platitudes, extravagances, esoteric obscurities, improbabilities, and naivetds. The whole re- calls the strange decor of certain fantastic tales such as those of Hoffmann, to whom the Belgian writer felt closely drawn. All about him Hoffmann saw ghosts, dead men come to life, strange beings who fled from daylight to plunge into the shadows. There is certainly a striking parallel between the spirit of the German writer and that of the Belgian dramatist, not only in the prolifera- tion of fantastic visions, but also in the need to react against the anguish that gripped them both. Their mad hallucinations cover life and nature with a veil, upon which they embroider monstrosities and apocalyptic figures. In their works, artificial explosions replace natural light; curious costumes, strong colors, striking decorations, tortured thought replace natural scenes and movements, the free flow of the healthy imagination. A feverish agitation drives their grimacing world without respite; under the power of mysterious magic that world flings itself about frantically; but not a single noble feeling or inspired thought rises from all this uneasy throbbing, murky dreams, anxiety, fright. Reality, simplicity, idealism are absent. The vision of these two writers leads them to extremes, to excess in imagery and vocabulary, and with similar lack of moderation,</page><page sequence="5">AURELIU WEISS 55 their grotesque humor clashes with their terrifying revels. Their comic tone is as black as their darkest meditations or visions. Ghelderode never succeeds in detaching himself from super- natural imagery in order to see things from a higher viewpoint. One might say that with each step he sinks deeper into the quick- sand of fetishism. His voice always has a subterranean sound, even when he embarks on vast metaphysical considerations. Is Mademoiselle Jaire the expression of a subterranean spirit? Is this a mystery play which contains the secret of life and death, the intimate relationship between human life and the principle of universal life, the impenetrable enigmas of the esoteric world? Can this drama be subterranean, when it is not only a mystery, but also a miracle, in which death is only a passing event, a re- flection, a preparatory step towards something so vast, so luminous, and so pure that words cannot express it? It is precisely here that the spirit is even more subterranean than in the other plays. The play deals with a resurrection, probably inspired by the Gospel of St. John, who speaks of the resurrection of Lazarus, a mystery that is widely known. However, the events of Ghelderode's play evoke other resonances, such as those of the plays of Tirso de Molina, of Calder6n, and of Zorrilla's Don Juan Tenorio. One can trace this theme far back into the past, for Mademoiselle Jaire deals again with the legend of the dead restored to life, which has haunted human imagination from earliest times. Tirso de Molina's play, The Man Damned for Lack of Faith, presents a bandit, Paulo, who, having been hunted down and killed by the police, is buried in the forest where he fled. He re- vives for a few minutes before falling into an eternal sleep. Some- thing similar happens in Calder6n's Devotion to the Cross. To- wards the end of this play, the bandit Eusebio dies, and the author says clearly: "he dies." Dying, he cries, "Alberto!" Three scenes later (the fifteenth scene of the last act) Alberto arrives in Rome, and hears the dead man still calling him: "I am Eusebio. Come, Alberto, come here where I am buried. Raise the branches. Fear nothing." Alberto approaches, finds the body of Eusebio who begs him to receive his confession before dying. "I should have died a while ago," he says. "But although the terrible blow of early death has liberated my soul and made my body incapable of</page><page sequence="6">56 Tulane Drama Review reclaiming it, death has not yet separated them." He leads Alberto off stage to confess his sins, and, a little later, Alberto returns on stage to report the most astonishing miracle: "After having killed Eusebio, heaven granted that his soul remain in its mortal en- velope until he should confess his sins. Such is God's grace to those who show devotion to the cross." Finally, in Zorrilla's drama, when Don Juan enters the tomb, after having challenged the statue of the Commander, he is completely changed: his legs barely support him, he has no weight. It seems that after a brawl, Captain Alvarez killed him at the door of his house, but Don Juan does not recall this fact. He is dead, but not completely. He walks like a ghost. The bells ring the death knell, and Don Juan asks, "For whom do the bells toll?" "For you." "And that funeral passing by?" "It is your own." Only then does he exclaim, "I am dead," and he asks for divine grace. The resurrection of Lazarus and these three examples are enough to suggest where Ghelderode might have taken the idea of the resurrection of Blandine and her double death. But this was only the groundwork upon which the Belgian author built a more ambitious story. Molina and Calderdn simply gave expression to an idea that was widely circulated in their time. In their works, the mystery is in the miracle, in divine will. The event that ex- presses it is clear, simple, precise, and as such, must have struck the popular imagination. Their explanation is temperate, short, concise; there is no metaphysical debate, no verbal obscurity. The resurrection and its heavenly overtones do not become the subject of dramatic commentary; he who believes, accepts, and on the stage the miracle is a fact, woven into the unraveling of the plot. In the Spanish works the resurrection is not the crux of the plot, but acts as a conclusion, giving the moral meaning of the drama; the human soul will leave for Heaven or Hell, depending upon whether it submits to or scorns the divine will. Ghelderode builds his dramatic structure on the foundation of this supernatural event. It is no longer an episode but the very center of the action, the axis of his esoteric and metaphysical revels. The dream of Blandine Jaire is heavy as a nightmare, although Ghelderode wished it to be light as a feather. This heroine is bound to the earth by innumerable superstitions, absurd naivete,</page><page sequence="7">AURELIU WEISS 57 and the disconcerting intervention of characters created to break spells. And as if this were not enough, the dramatic development is blocked by ponderous metaphysics conveyed through esoteric dialogue whose meaning is deliberately obfuscated so as to appear profound. Following the Romantics, Ghelderode seems to have wanted to seize upon the divine principle that governs the spiritual world. Unfortunately, his sense of the divine is so permeated with the monstrous visions of his esoteric universe, that he can no longer distinguish the divine from the monstrous, and it is the latter that rules supreme in his world. Where he seeks the divine he finds only primitive preconceptions and superstitions. From his mind, "darkness, as if an inherent positive quality, poured forth upon all objects of the moral and physical universe in one unceasing radiation of gloom," as Edgar Poe said of Roderick Usher. And yet Ghelderode has successfully treated a resurrection in Chronicles of Hell, where the miracle, as in the Spanish plays, is a dramatic fact, an element in the conflict and the action, with neither obscure complications nor tiring metaphysics. A crime has been committed against Bishop Jan in Eramo, who saw the crime but was unable to prevent it. The criminal is Bishop Laque- deem, his assistant. Jan in Eramo rises from the dead, and there ensues a life-and-death struggle between the two bishops. There is no need to go into detail; the resurrected bishop dies again shortly after the epic combat. The events of this play are clear, the action compressed into a single act, the conflict is moving; the rapid succession of scenes allows no time for reflection. If one reads Ghelderode attentively, it becomes clear that his best effects are due to his narrative and pictorial talents. Color plays a vital role. One has the impression of encountering a painter who expresses his vision with words instead of a brush. For this reason one cannot separate the scenic action from the pictorial whole. Often his characters give the feeling that they emerged from a painting to move under an incantation. The narrator com- plements the painter. Ghelderode's plays contain stage directions in which the portraits of the characters have intrinsic artistic value. In a few words, he evokes an atmosphere, delineates a char- acter whose face haunts you. Upon the entrance on stage of most</page><page sequence="8">58 Tulane Drama Review of his characters, he paints their physical features, their moral resonance, showing his gift for suggestion, economy, life, and color. Bosch, Breughel, Tenier, Jordaens were his teachers and his inspiration, to a greater degree than the Elizabethans and the Spanish, and to an even greater degree than the fantastic writers of Germany and France. Of them all, it is Breughel who had the greatest influence upon him. In his paintings and etchings Ghel- derode discovered a grotesque humanity, a mixture of suffering and surging joy, grotesque masques, hallucinatory visions, which one finds in his plays. However, when there are no crowd scenes, the Belgian writer sometimes moves away from what we may call popular vision, and Breughel's influence is replaced by a refine- ment drawn from other sources. His farces, such as The Ballad of the Great Macabre, About a Devil Who Preaches Marvels, The Strange Rider, The Farce of the Shadows, contain matter to delight the popular spirit. These works put on the stage drunken, stinking monks, magicians, devils with their tricks and disguises, corrupt men, stutterers, lying min- isters. Red Magic treats that popular type, the miser, whose exag- gerated features have always delighted the masses. The characters of these plays are old friends; their superstitions have a long tra- dition of popular favor. But one has to go a long way from this popular art to understand Ghelderode's own spirit, for beneath these outbursts of vulgar, obvious humor hides a visionary, one who is obsessed and overtaxed. The public does not see this man, or cannot understand him. There is nothing that springs from nature into his theatre with- out passing through his interior illumination, which transforms the aspects, the perspectives, the original meaning of things. He sees nature and man only through a kaleidoscope, at the bottom of which lies an infinite number of varying designs. Landscapes, men, or costumes may recall pictures seen somewhere, during trips through museums or through studios of painters. In the scenic directions of many of his plays there are references to a particular painter, etcher, or picture which recall similar scenes on his own stage. Breughel, Laermans, the Flemish primitives, Goya, Jacques</page><page sequence="9">AURELIU WEISS 59 Callot (who influenced Hoffmann so strongly) are designated by name. This viewing of men and the world through pictorial art is one of the most curious features of Ghelderode's drama, which, worked out both plastically and poetically, is highly personal. However, the two ways of working are not simultaneous; the poet describes what is seen by the painter, engraver, sculptor, who, in turn, in- spires the writer with his moral philosophy, and molds his per- ception of life. As a result, the writer no longer looks at life with his physical eyes or those of his imagination, but life is projected through painting. Inspiration does not move directly from object to image. But a dramatist should see things in terms of the stage: he discerns life in the development of the conflicts to which it gives rise, just as the painter or sculptor gives plastic form to life. These two kinds of perception are fundamentally different. Paying no attention to the essential function of dramatic dia- logue, Ghelderode repeats the weakness of many other writers, in giving the same language to all his characters. Whatever their education or social class, they all express themselves in the same stylized language. In Hop Signor for example, the sculptor, the gentlemen, the dwarfs, the executioner, the monk, the heroine all reason impeccably in fine flashes of insight, poetically ex- pressed. The romantics were past masters in this sort of psycho- logical confusion, and Villiers de L'Isle-Adam in Contes cruels has done something similar that probably inspired Ghelderode. It is of some interest that one finds specifically dramatic dialogue in only one Ghelderode play, Escurial. More than any other of his plays, Escurial successfully combines the interest of an un- usual plot with the poignancy of an anguished wait, while at the same time maintaining a high literary standard from beginning to end. The dramatic development is sure, the dialogue tight, the conflict all the more powerful because it is hidden beneath a dangerous game. The king and the fool change roles. The fool will pay with his life for the hour of truth. In Ghelderode's comedies, death and evil are as omnipresent as in his serious drama, playing a primary role. Death, as in pictures of the late Middle Ages, sits astride man's shoulders, plays the fool,</page><page sequence="10">60 Tulane Drama Review becomes comically theatrical. But the instinct of self-preservation in Ghelderode is powerless in and of itself, needing the stimula- tion of alcohol. It is alcohol that inspires the comic zeal and exag- gerated outbursts of the heroes of his farces. Drunkenness is sovereign in Ghelderode's grotesque drama, and its effect on his plays' quality is unmistakable. The first inescapable reflection after examining Ghelderode's theatre is that this view of the world reveals nothing new in art or thought. One can, of course, see the effort to create something new both in scenic conception and in form, but this effort leads to nothing distinguished, powerful, or significantly personal. His style degenerates into mannerism, arousing curiosity rather than real dramatic interest. His weakness lies rooted in the nature of his inspiration, which leads him to exploit the prejudices of a past age well-known for its intolerant fanaticism, for its dark superstition, and for its crimes. This shadowy period of history knew occasional bright moments, but the Belgian author does not seem to have noticed that. His feelings, his temperament, and his convictions bound him to the most absurd beliefs, to the most unreasonable superstitions. By seeking and cherishing them, he has sunk into the black clay from which he kneads his characters and moulds his fables, until he can no longer break free of it. Since these were his resources, he could be neither original, nor a true thinker. In spite of the humor of his farces, his drama leaves one uneasy. Tenderness, love, generosity, pure emotions are ab- sent. He thought that he had put them into his mystery play, Mademoiselle Jaire, but his resources betrayed his intentions. His faith has only bat-wings on which to soar into the vast spaces of thought and knowledge. When one begins by reading or seeing Escurial, continues with Hop Signor, Lord Halewyn, and The Ballad of the Great Macabre, one senses an original talent, a powerful imagination full of re- markable visions. In spite of certain reservations that one may have, Chronicles of Hell does not contradict this impression. How- ever, as soon as one goes on to other works and above all to those that claim to be philosophical, disenchantment and disappoint- ment increase until our reaction is finally transformed into re-</page><page sequence="11">AURELIU WEISS 61 sistance and protest. The accumulation of absurdities becomes too great. It is indeed disappointing to see on today's stage a revival of those gloomy textures and primitive eccentricities that tormented the lives of people for long, hard centuries. Ghelderode has created these works, not to derive from them a philosophy of human mis- takes or of the disastrous effect of fanaticism, not to illuminate the thick fog of ignorance with a ray of light coming from above and beyond, not to show, through the dark paths of fate, the continu- ous human effort towards spiritual and moral progress, but he has created his drama to make us share his love for all these aberrations and to look at them with a tender and sympathetic eye. In the face of such weaknesses and deficiencies, the few merits of Ghelderode's theatre make it improbable that his drama will be judged favorably or that it will last.
