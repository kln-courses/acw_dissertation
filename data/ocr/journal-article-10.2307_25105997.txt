<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME CONCLUSIONS OF A FREE-THINKER. BY THE LATE D. H. CHAMBERLAIN. It is deemed well that a document so personal as is the following should have a brief prefatory sketch of the main events of its author's career and the more salient features of his character, that " the persons who read what he has written may know upon what large experience of life his conclusions are based." Such is the task here essayed. Of simple, upright, God-fearing New England stock, Daniel Henry Chamberlain was born at West Brookfield, Mass., on June 23rd, 1835, the ninth child of Captain Eli and Achsah (Forbes) Chamberlain. Until fourteen years of age he worked on his father's farm, intermittently at tending the common schools of the town. At the age of fifteen he began to study Latin and Greek during the few months he spent at Amherst College in 1850. Thence he passed for a short time to the Phillips Academy at Andover, Mass., teaching school, to defray his expenses, when the opportunity offered. When twenty-one years of age he en tered the Worcester, Mass., High School, and there, under the tutelage of such rare teachers as Homer B. Sprague and Wolcott Calkins, he progressed rapidly, showing, as one who knew him at the time has recently said, " an extraordinary maturity and power of study." Through many struggles he passed to Yale College, which he entered in the fall of 1858. Marked throughout by unusual thoroughness and industry, and even brilliancy, his course in college culminated in his graduation in 1862, with the award of highest honors in oratory and English composition and the fourth place in a class of one hundred and ten members. That he did not fail to leave the impress of his ability on his teachers and classmates is well shown by the remark of one of his professors, who, when asked who among Yale students had made upon him the strongest impression of intellectual ability, replied, "John C. Calhoun and Daniel H. Chamberlain," while President Woolsey char acterized him as " a born leader of men." Such was his record in a class containing Franklin MacVeagh, W. H. H. ("Adirondack") Murray, Judge Frederic Adams, S. B. Eaton, Henry Holt, Buchanan Winthrop and Melville C. Day. From Yale he went to the Harvard Law School. Here his career was short, but the time spent there sufficed to secure him the enviable repu tation of being, in the words of Charles S. Fairchild, ex-Secretary of</page><page sequence="2">SOME CONCLUSIONS OF A FREE-THINKER. 175 the Treasury, " on the whole the ablest man in the Harvard Law School," and this when its register enrolled the names of Frederic Adams, William C. Whitney, George Gray, Anthony Higgins, Henry James, John Fiske, William Everett, James Green, and Charles S. Fair child. " Chamberlain," said one of his fellow students, " was in the front rank. In the union of legal scholarship, debating power, and personal attractiveness which go to make up a great lawyer, he was second to none in this promising group." But the vital issues of the Civil War loomed large at this time, and in November of 1863 he wrote to a friend: "I am going to the war within the next two months. ... I have no plans beyond that; . . . but go I must. I ought to have gone in '61, but the real reason I didn't was that I was then, as I am now, in debt for my college ex penses to those who cannot possibly afford to lose what I have bor rowed from them. . . . But years hence I shall be ashamed to have it known that, for any reason, I did not have a hand in this life-or death struggle for the Union and for Freedom. I find that I can insure my life for enough to cover the $2,000 I owe, and nothing shall hinder me longer than is necessary to get the money to do this." Through his friend, the late Emory Washburn, he secured from Governor Andrew a lieutenant's commission in the Fifth Massachusetts Cavalry, afterwards commanded by Colonel Charles Francis Adams. His work in the army was done, as elsewhere, thoroughly and faithfully, and in December, 1865, he was mustered out of service at Boston. In January, 1866, going to Charleston, S. C, to settle the affairs of a deceased classmate, and, perhaps, " impelled southward by the mag netism of his own destiny," Chamberlain cast in his lot with the proudest State of the South. Two years he spent in a pecuniarily unsuccessful effort at cotton-planting, in the hope of paying his college debts. In the fall of 1867 this lawyer, " whose legal studies had been prematurely broken off, and who had never had a day's practice in the courts," was chosen a member of the Constitutional Convention. In the reorgani zation of the State government the office of Attorney-General fell natu rally to his lot. Here he at once found himself pitted against some of the most brilliant members of an ever able and distinguished bar, who soon learned that they had to reckon with one in whom no flaw of legal armor was to be found which indefatigable labor and the most consci entious thinking could remedy. He soon became the candidate of the Republican party for Governor, and, elected in 1874, he held office until April 11th, 1877. Those interested in the events of that stormy career may find the story told in graphic terms in the admirable work by Walter Allen, entitled " Governor Cham berlain's Administration in South Carolina." Constantly at war with the baser elements of his own party as well as of the opposition, he fought with remarkable vigor and pertinacity a straight-out battle for civic virtue and public morality. That he suf fered then and later from unavoidable association with corrupt charac ters was inevitable, but the facts, impartially viewed, give evidence of</page><page sequence="3">176 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. naught but the most resolute perseverance in the course which he be lieved to be for the greatest good of the people. Walter Allen's excellent narrative bears ample testimony to his loftiness of purpose and the purity of his aim of these years. Its historical accuracy and fidelity to demonstrable facts cannot be impugned. Upon its publication in 1888, the " Boston Herald " said : " The work ... is carefully written, and, while enthusiastic in its admiration of the Governor and his work, is yet fortified by an amount of proof that justifies all the praise that is awarded in its pages." Said the " Cincinnati Commercial Gazette " : " No man can read this book, made up largely, as it is, of messages, addresses, interviews, letters, and various other forms of personal ex pression, and not feel that he is in the presence not simply of a great man, but a man filled full of the instinct and passion and ambition of a reformer?a man who would have gone to the stake two hundred years ago for his opinions, a man who valued intellectual honesty above all price." But the most powerful mentality and physique could not well stand the terrible strain. To see his purposes thwarted at every step, his hopes blasted, his ambition frustrated, was an experience that under mined his vitality. In the cause of honest government, he sacrificed the health of thirty years to come. In the closing words of Allen's book, it was the " story of a brave attempt, a good fight, and a baffling, cruel defeat. . . . From first to last it was a battle, waged with daunt less energy and fortitude, for two great causes which he represented with an ardor and fidelity equal towards each?the cause of equal rights and the cause of hottest government. From beginning to end it illustrates the candor of his avowal of his ambition and hope . . . and not less the sincerity of his declaration : ' Public duty is my only master.' " The story of the closing days of his administration has become history. How in the election of 1876 honest men were divided in opinion as to the result, how he and Hampton were invited to Washington to confer with President Hayes, how the Federal troops were finally withdrawn and his continuance in ofiice made impossible, these things the world knows. Shortly after he gave up the keys of office he removed to New York City, where for thirty years he practised in the State and Federal courts. In 1882, broken in health, he sought in Europe a renewal of strength. On his return to this country in 1883, he became non-resident professor of Constitutional Law in Cornell University. In 1897, finding the ex actions of his legal duties undermining his health, and having laid aside a considerable competence, he retired from his profession, and, purchasing the old Chamberlain homestead at West Brookfield, Mass., he remod elled it completely, intending there to end his days among his books and the associations of his youth. But in 1902 he suffered a terrible blow in the death of his youngest son, which rendered longer residence at the scene of bereavement intol erable to him. His health again failed him and he sold his estate and sought the curative effects of less rigorous climes. The winter of 1902-03</page><page sequence="4">SOME CONCLUSIONS OF A FREE-THINKER. 177 he spent in South Carolina. In 1903, accompanied by his son, he sailed for England. Returning in the fall, he again went to South Carolina, but, continuing to fail in health, he once more set sail, this time for Egypt. Twenty months spent in Egypt, where he became acquainted with Lord Cromer, on the Riviera, and in London, seemed in a measure to revive some of his old-time vigor. But the end was not far off. He landed in New York for the last time on June 23rd, 1906. He went at once to Charlottesville, Va., never to leave it except to be carried to the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and back again. The dread cancer which carried him off had begun to manifest itself, and from now on its inroads were rapid. He saw the end approach, but was undismayed. His mental powers were wholly unimpaired, even to the last hour. His power of sustained thought, his patriotism, his interests, were as strong as ever. Almost entirely confined to his bed, he had little or no strength, yet his purpose to serve his country never flagged. Very near the end he wrote one of his most powerful invectives against one whom he thought a " Traitor to Public Duty." Of the well-nigh super human exertion it required, he said in a letter to a friend : " I did not let you know what I was doing, for I felt you would think me foolhardy, and I could not blame you if you did. But I simply couldn't give up my purpose. I little cared whether or not it killed me, and I was actu ally so weak that when I had partially raised myself on my pillow and had my pencil in my hand, I could write only a dozen or twenty words, and then give up exhausted and panting. I thus wrote during five long days, and then from my notes, undecipherable to any one but myself, I dictated it to a stenographer. What I did now seems almost incredible even to myself. Considering the circumstances, I must consider it the greatest feat of my life. I reckon it shows how the spirit can triumph over the flesh." Such was the spirit and temper of the man as he watched the end approach. In the care of friends and relatives his life slowly ebbed away, until, after a day of more than usual animation, in the midst of a hemorrhage, he passed away on the morning of the 13th of April, 1907. Of the many estimates of his career and character which appeared in the public press, space will permit of but two quotations. Said the " Springfield Republican " : " In the public spirit, breadth and sanity of his contributions to current issues of national moment, the late ex Governor Daniel H. Chamberlain rendered faithful and conscientious service to the people and the country. His spirit and temper and ability were to be ranked with the good work done by George William Curtis, Carl Schurz, and James Russell Lowell, whose capacity for clear and high thinking made them leaders and mentors for a host of young and honest voters possessed of less grasp, knowledge and background. . . . He handled a subject to illumine and adorn it with that touch of a strong personality which is powerful to enlighten and impress. . . . He faced declining health with bravery, and his brain and pen were vol. cLxxxvi.?no. 623. 12</page><page sequence="5">178 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. kept busy after his personal activity came to be circumscribed by the inroads of disease. There was no flickering in the steady flame of hi? thought, and the purpose to serve his day and generation remained to the end." Said the " News and Courier " of Charleston, S. C. : " Mr. Chamberlain was a very remarkable man. He was a scholar of the truest temper, a lover of his country of the broadest views." The same paper, three years before, on the occasion of the publication of his now famous Open Letter to Mr. Bryce on the Negro Problem, had said : " In sheer intellectual ability and mastery of the English language few excel him." One more public appreciation deserves notice. On May 9th, 1907, Charles Francis Adams, as its President, rose in a meeting of the Mas sachusetts Historical Society and paid the Governor eloquent tribute. In it he quoted from a remarkable letter from Colonel A. C. Haskell of South Carolina, one time the bitterest enemy of Mr. Chamberlain, lat terly his devoted friend. Colonel Haskell closes with these words : " He was endowed with high traits; he was a patriot, he was a searcher after truth, and, when he believed it found, he was brave enough to declare it, without regard to danger or its inconsistency with his past. He loved his country, and was to the end loyal to the State of his adoption, and he came to love the men who had crushed his highest hope in the zenith of his public life. He was a student, a worker, and a thinker. . . . He was pure of heart and of a pure mind; and in time he rose above the clouds. I remember him with love and respect." In politics he was a free-trader, an anti-imperialist, and an Independent. Some years ago he publicly said : " I am not a Democrat more than a Republican. I am an Independent, i. e., one who tries to look at polit ical matters with his eyes and not with his prejudices, one always on the lookout merely for the best men and the best measures, one who, as a rule, seeks only what is the best thing practicable." In religious matters his views are fully and fearlessly set forth in the following document, found after his death, sealed and addressed to the present writer. P. C. C. If I were asked why I write these lines I might not be able to give a very satisfactory answer. My motives are probably quite mixed. One thing is certain : I do not write primarily for publication now or hereafter. Perhaps no more than two or three persons will ever see what I now write. Still less do I write in a proselyting spirit. I wish to change or influence no man's opinions or beliefs. All my life I have re spected the views of others, many times forbearing to even ex press my own from deference to those of others. In matters of outward conduct or form, I should describe myself a con formist. I do not love singularity in any of its forms. When</page><page sequence="6">SOME CONCLUSIONS OF A FREE-THINKER. 179 ever honor or truth or public weal have seemed to be at stake, I trust I have been able to act fearlessly and independently; but, whenever duty has not seemed to call for divergence from others in action or opinion, I have been glad to acquiesce in feelings and opinions with those with whom my life has been thrown. Least of all, have I sought or wished to influence or unsettle the religious beliefs of others. These I have regarded as sacred precincts, within which no uninvited steps might intrude. More than this, when invited or challenged to put forth my views on religious topics, I have ordinarily declined. Lifelong I have been a constant attendant at the religious services of the standard churches of the communities where I have resided or been temporarily located. Still, near the close of a long life, I have found myself wish ing to record in terms the views which I have most maturely and deeply pondered and adopted on the most important themes. This record I purpose to place where it will be certain to be used only, if used at all, for purposes consistent with my lifelong attitude towards my fellow men, as just stated. I may properly make another introductory remark. My edu cation, environment, associations, all those pressures which or dinarily influence, and often determine, one's religious views, have been of the strictly orthodox Protestant sort. I will not quite say of the Calvin istic sort, though I might call them of a modified or modern Calvinism. Through Sunday-schools, prayer meetings, church-going at the pace of four services a Sunday, including the Sunday-school, all forms of Christian nurture and training, so called, such as New England Protestant communi ties are apt to provide, I have come from my earlier years. Some thirty years ago, after a careful reading of Newman's " Apologia pro Vita Sua " and " A Grammar of Assent/' I was led to review with some care my own thoughts and customary beliefs?hardly beliefs, more nearly habitudes of thought?on topics which concern the realms which lie outside or beyond our visual world, or world of material experience. During the period since I began this special study, I have read and studied widely and deeply, though constantly following assiduously my profession as a lawyer, and never neglecting entiiely the aultivaitkwi o? literature generally, and especially of</page><page sequence="7">180 TEE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. the classical writers of Greece and Eome. For all these sub ordinate purposes, I have rarely been able to reserve on an aver age more than an hour a day; but even so short a time, when utilized with diligence for a quarter of a century and more, will cover a very large measure of reading and study. I shall not undertake to give the authorities which I have examined and studied in my long search. The list would be too long to repeat here. I will, however, remark that by far the larger part of these have been the works of writers who have accepted and defended the Christian religion and the sources of support on which that religion relies. I should say that only four books of an opposite tendency have had much to do with my conclusions?Strauss's " Leben Jesu," Kant's " Critique of Pure Beason," Benan's " Vie de J?sus," and Haeckel's " Biddle of the Universe," though I have read nearly all the German works that are germane to the subject. Leslie Stephens's brief writings on the same themes have interested me very greatly. I cannot help remarking the rather peculiar fact that, as Newman was telling us how, step by step, he was making his way to Borne, where reason is dethroned as a final umpire, I was shaking off, under the influence of Newman's two subtlest and most persuasive works, and not a little under the influence of his thoughts and arguments, the last shackles of former Chris tian beliefs and creeds, and going forth into the freedom and clear sunlight of unfettered thought and unbiassed judgment. The " Apologia" I suppose, I might have read ten times or more, each time for a different, special purpose, but always in part for its unequalled literary style and merits; but I have never yet succeeded, much as I have tried, in putting myself, even for the moment and by the strongest effort of imagination, into New man's attitude towards religious matters, and especially towards dogmas and the Church. I mean his attitude towards these long before he openly and nominally seceded to Borne. His re ligious proclivities came from sources and were directed by forces that made for dogma and sacerdotalism. Eome lay plain ly at the end of the road he was travelling when he was the cynosure and pride of so many young and ardent Anglicans at Oxford. His direction was fixed from the start. What re mained was only to answer the query, How soon? Still I confess I hold Newman in reverence such as I give to</page><page sequence="8">SOME CONCLUSIONS OF A FREE-THINKER. 181 hardly any other great religious character, especially a Church man. Besides his almost unrivalled literary gifts, making him, as another has said, "the F?nelon of our day/' there was that about him which, combined with his golden voice, put to shame his enemies; while, as Mr. Gosse has well said, "he performed the inestimable service of preserving the tradition of sound, un emphatic English." After my marriage in 1869, I associated myself with my wife's church, the Unitarian, and there I found, as I still find, much that commands my approval and enlists my sympathy as respects both doctrines and spirit. At all times I have been a great reader of printed sermons, as well as a listener to the most eminent preachers. There are but few volumes of sermons in English, whether modern or of the last two or three centuries, which I have not read; and I have seldom missed hearing Chris tian preachers of note who were accessible to me during the last sixty years?preachers so unlike in all respects as Dr. Bel lows, Mr. Beecher, Dr. Bushnell, Dr. Patton of Princeton, Bishop Brooks, Moody, and Ingersoll, if the last may be, as I think he may, classed among preachers. As a passing remark of possible interest, I will say that the most powerful pulpit orator I have ever heard was by long odds Henry Ward Beecher, while, to me, the most pungent and affecting was President Wool sey of Yale College. His sermon entitled, I think, in the pub lished volume of his sermons, " The Self-propagating Power of Sin," I heard in the old Yale College chapel, and it sticks in my memory now as the most moving and transpiercing sermon I have ever heard. I still often read it to refresh the sensations it gave me when I heard it delivered. From all my studies and reflections of so many years, my first clear resulting postulate was that my own reason, reasoning faculty, was the final guide and master which I must follow and obey in my search for truth and in fixing my opinion on all subjects. By this I do not mean my unaided reason, but reason as fully informed and as largely aided as is possible; but that my own reason when so informed and aided must finally pass upon and decide all questions whatever. Of the validity of this position I have no shadow of doubt. This is not a narrow view. It excludes nothing. It does not forbid belief in what is called the supernatural, or imagined, or</page><page sequence="9">182 TEE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. miraculous. It only demands that the reason shall be satisfied, on whatever grounds, of the truth or reasonableness of what one accepts and believes. Through all the intervening years, this postulate has guided me. What my reason has not approved, I have not accepted as truth. What my reason has approved, that I have accepted. A second leading, guiding thought has been the fact of the limited area of our knowledge and the vastness of the world of the unknown and unknowable. A recent writer has said, " Our whole knowledge or science is but a tenuous film floating over the vast ocean of our nescience." The boundaries of the un knowable have grown greater for me as the years have gone on. Many things which I once may have dogmatized on, and which most men still profess to know, I now put within the barriers of the unknowable?unknowable, at least, by any means now available to human effort. A third great leading thought has been the stupendous evolu tionary theory of the world. I say "theory of I he world"; for, in my view, it covers the world and all it contains?the universe, so far as our knowledge of it goes. The mental and moral world, like the physical, is the result, at every stage, of the working of the laws of evolution. In creation, the making of something out of nothing, the best we can know teaches that there is no ground for belief. As I shall hereafter point out, what lies back of evolution, what force, power or influence first put its laws into operation, I regard as an insoluble mystery, a matter lying wholly within the bounds of the unknowable. What we do know and see is the actual working and results of these laws. These three fundamental concepts,?(1) reason, human rea son, one's own reason, the final arbiter or touchstone of truth, not for other men, but for each one's self, for every individual person; (2) the vast realm of the unknowable, a realm infinite in comparison with our knowledge and science; and (3) the all-embracing law of evolution, sweeping over the whole world and ruling all things within our ken,?these three are the in struments, guides and measures by means of which I have tried to fix my beliefs and mould my moral and intellectual life. I need hardly say that, working by these rules, the great task has been to cast off, put aside, root out, preconceptions fixed in my mind by my previous course of life and thought, by all the</page><page sequence="10">SOME CONCLUSIONS OF A FREE-THINKER. Ig3 associations of the past years,?beliefs once dear and undoubted, conclusions long cherished and interwoven in the very fibre of being. That this has not been at all times a pleasant task I need not aver, but through it all the clear light of truth, the comfort of deep conviction, have been solaces and compensations which have for the most part made the way not only plain, but pleasant. The most comprehensive, perhaps the most important, result of the application of the three great rules or guides of thought which I have enumerated, has been the entire rejection of what we commonly call the Providential and the Miraculous. The prime tenet of evolution is cosmic law ruling all things. From this it follows that suspensions, interruptions, modifications of the laws of evolution, are simply impossible. Providence, so called, miracles, however defined, are excluded from all part or lot in the progress or development or course of events. I have already said that what gave to evolution its initial force is past finding out, but the steady, inflexible, unvarying work ing and progress of its laws I hold to be one of the conclusions of human science which may be accepted as proved and true. It is a gigantic step which this conclusion compels,?that no power exists anywhere which can or does for a moment interfere to any degree with the course of events as determined by the laws of evolution. The elimination of accident, Providence, so called, and mira cles, works momentous changes in many directions, but espe cially in religious or theological matters. For example, as I have already observed, while it does not exclude the idea or belief or posit of a First Cause or Power, it does, to my mind, exclude the idea of a presiding or controlling Deity, to use the common locution, who continually watches over the universe, exercising the function either of keeping the machinery of the universe in working-order or putting it in order on occasions. Especially does it exclude, once for all and peremptorily, the idea of an anthropomorphic God or Deity, a person or individual who rules all things, animal and human, visible or invisible, earthly and spiritual. Such a God, the God now conceived of, believed in, and worshipped by the vast majority of human beings, evolution forbids. Equally certain, the central ideas of the Christian re ligion become impossible of rational belief when tested by the</page><page sequence="11">184 TEE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. essential principles of evolution. I mean such ideas as sin, re demption, conversion, salvation, atonement, the person, office and work of Jesus Christ, the Trinity; in a word, the whole circle and array of dogmas and beliefs which make up the Chris tian religion, as well as a large part of the carefully developed other great religious systems of the world. In this general result my reason has forced me to concur and believe. This has, of course, involved the abandonment of many specific beliefs which are fundamental in the scheme of Chris tianity and other wide-spread religious systems. For example, the Christian religion, it is claimed, is authenticated by a book called the Bible. This book is held by Christians generally to be a true and inspired supernatural revelation of a God who rules all things according to his sovereign personal will and pleasure, who is omnipotent over all things, omniscient, every where active, on whom our lives, all life, momentarily depend, who sends or withholds the gifts and operations of nature? the rain, the fruits of the soil, seed-times and harvests?and without whose personal permission and aid nothing exists or is or can be done. Many Christians, probably a majority now, cer tainly until very recently a great majority, believe the Bible to be plenarily inspired, that is, that the men who composed it were miraculously guided to write nothing but the absolute truth. Evolution cuts up all such notions by the roots; the Bible be comes, like other books, valuable so far as by the test of human reason it records truth or teaches morality or influences to good living. The Bible still towers in the world of literature above nearly all other books. There are passages in its so-called his torical books which portray, as are portrayed almost nowhere else, the characters of great and just men. There are touching idyllic stories, as of Esther; lofty psalms like many of David's; the magnificent poem of Job ; uplifting and moving chapters, as in the major prophets, Isaiah and Ezekiel; these all will justly keep the Bible, the Old Testament at least, one of the priceless literary documents of the world. Not so much can be said for the New Testament. Discarding its claims to supernatural inspiration and infallibility, it be comes only the record and exposition of an impossible super natural religion. The personality and influence of Jesus Christ, alleged God and man, son of a Judean peasant, yet son of God;</page><page sequence="12">SOME CONCLUSIONS OF A FREE-THINKER. Ig5 put to death on the cross, yet one of the Trinity in Heaven? this grotesque conception, with all its concomitants, goes to the limbo of impossible beliefs. Aside from its fate when brought to the test of evolutionary truths, there was never offered to the human mind, as I think, a scheme of thought, or a conception called religious, so unreasonable and preposterous in all its main features as the so-called plan of salvation set forth and ex pounded in the Gospels and Epistles of the New Testament. It is the marvel of marvels that it has won credence, still more, wide credence, among the most intelligent and cultivated nations of the modern world. For what is the plan ? It presupposes that Sin, so called, has been permitted by God to come into the world, thereby fatally tainting the whole, every member, of the human race; that God Himself, though infinite in power, could not pardon or forgive sinners until atonement had been made; that man was absolutely unable to make atonement; that, in this dilemma, Jesus Christ, Son of God, coequal member of the God head, or Trinity, volunteered to come into this world and to take upon himself the sins, or the effects and penalties of the sins, of the whole race of men, past, present and future; that he came to Palestine on this errand in the guise of a child, miraculously begotten of the Holy Ghost, the Third Person of the Trinity, and a virgin peasant of Judea, lived in obscurity and silence for thirty years, then announced his mission and preached his mes sage for three years, then gave up his life upon the cross, returned to life in three days, and shortly after visibly ascended to Heaven and resumed his seat as a member of the Trinity; that he sits there forever, exercising the functions and powers of God; that this atonement for man's sin was accepted by God, the Father, First Person of the Trinity, as adequate ; that henceforth all who put faith in Jesus Christ, that is, all who believe in him and what has now been stated of him, will be saved from all con sequences of their personal sins, and after death be admitted to Heaven, to be happy forever; and that even those who lived be fore Christ and never heard of him will likewise be saved by virtue of his death; and that thus, and thus only, has a way been opened by which the human race can be saved from the consequences of their own voluntary sins. I do not see how any intelligent person can, unbiassed, consider this "plan" and not reject it as utterly impossible and as the</page><page sequence="13">186 TEE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. height of unreason; and yet millions to one accept it, pin to it their hopes and faith, and live and die in unwavering belief in it. If asked on what their confidence rests, such Christians will say, "Upon the New Testament, its Gospels and other records, and its Epistles." But, looking into these alleged evidences and proofs with the eye of ordinary human reason, we find that the records of the New Testament are throughout of the most doubt ful authenticity. Not one of the Gospels, nor the book called "The Acts of the Apostles," is verifiable. Intrinsically, they are entirely incredible. They are a tissue of myths, traditions and what may be called " old wives' tales." Take the life and teach ings of Jesus Christ and separate from them all that is mythical, miraculous or otherwise incredible, and what is left? Much that is good and valuable, but little that is superlatively good, or great, or original. The best ethical sayings of Jesus Christ are easily paralleled from the doctrines and precepts of the other great religions or systems of religious thought of the Eastern world. " The Sermon on the Mount," so called, generally con sidered the high-water mark of his teachings, sets up no higher or purer standard of living or of aspiration than are found in authoritative Brahmanical writings or in those of Confucianism. The same is measurably true of a comparison of Christianity and Mohammedanism in respect to their ethical principles. The Golden Eule, so called, was laid down in these great religious schemes long before the advent of Jesus Christ. What has helped to support the excessive claims made for the Christian religion has been the fact that it was almost infinitely superior, ethically, to the barbarous Jewish or Mosaic religion or scheme of religious polity. This is, indeed, its chief distinction?that it cut up Judaism by the roots, so that its growth may be said to have been suspended since the Christian era. The modern Jewish faith and practice, if they may be identified with the Mosaic, have scarcely held their own even among the Hebrew or Jewish race. But if not superior to other religions in its theoretical stand ards, has the Christian religion, as set forth by Jesus Christ him self, proved itself superior as a practical force in human de velopment since the dawn of its era? Here Christian apologists generally affect to challenge all comers. They say, "Look at the result of Christianity as seen in its influence on the nations</page><page sequence="14">SOME CONCLUSIONS OF A FREE-THINKER. \gj or communities which have embraced it; observe the higher morality, the greater social advancement, of those nations, es pecially Protestant nations, which have been trained in the Christian faith." But if we take this test and first look back ward, I do not think the Christian claim can be made good. Since the advent of Jesus Christ and the considerable prevalence of the Christian religion, its abuses, crimes against humanity, atrocities and cruelties are absolutely greater, far greater, than can be charged against any other system of religion whatever. This is a broad assertion, but modern history fully sustains it. There is no parallel elsewhere to the extent and fiendishness of the great persecutions, by Christian potentates and zealots, of those who rejected the claims of Christianity or disregarded the edicts of those who represented the Church, which Christianity held to be the only true Church. "But look," say the same apologists, "at the contrast of to day between Christian and other nations and peoples." Here we find, undoubtedly, some, perhaps much, confirmation of the Christian claims. But it is to be considered whether the con trast so favorable on its face to Christianity has really come from Christianity or from other causes. My study and reflection lead me to deny the claim that the greater advancement and higher civilization of the nations called Christian are due alone or chiefly to the prevalence of the Christian religion. The cause is more largely racial than religious. Since Christianity won the Koman Empire, it has held sway over those nations most closely allied in polity, in laws and in institutions, to the Boman system of government and the Boman national cast of tempera ment and character. These are especially the nations of Con tinental, and most particularly of Western, Europe. Christianity with these nations has been more an inheritance than a choice. These nations, speaking generally, are by blood, by nature, by long habitudes, by inherited ideas and influences the virile, strong, aggressive, progressive, enterprising nations of the world. By these qualities it has come about that they have taken the lead and kept it for at least the last ten centuries of human advancement. I am speaking now of the so-called Christian nations. This in cludes Koman Catholic nations, as well as the Protestant. Chris tianity must answer for the former, as much as for the latter. I am not, in what I am now writing, seeking to present argu</page><page sequence="15">188 TEE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. ments, so much as conclusions reached by me by my own studies and reflections; and on this point I am convinced that the cause of the superiority in general polity and in what we call, quite too complacently, Christian progress and civilization, is far more racial than religious. I do not see sufficient grounds for belief that, if the facts had been reversed and Christianity had moved East instead of West, the condition of the East would be better than it is to-day, or that of the West worse than it is to-day. Nor do I believe?and I may as well say this here as later?that to-day the condition of the East, the countries where Brahmanism and Mohammedanism and Confucianism prevail, would be improved if what Christians so flippantly and self complacently call "the conversion of the world" were now to take place. We, Western peoples, are filled with self-conceit and vaunt our asserted vast superiority over the East in all ways, religious, moral and economic. I confess I have much respect for many of the characteristics of the Eastern or Oriental mind, spirit and civilization. (We even deny to these nations the name of civilization.) The Eastern mind is essentially meditative, in trospective, tending to mysticism, but highly religious. Eco nomically the East is, in our estimate, stationary, backward and incapable of much progress. I could wish, however, that we of the West could have a large infusion of the Eastern spirit in place, or in modification, of our restless, aggressive, strenuous, noisy and turbulent mode of life and effort. Certainly, the fret and fury of our life cannot be favorable to the best and deepest religious development and attainment. It is of the despised and slandered East that Matthew Arnold truly says: "That wonderful East, from which, whatever airs of superiority Europe generally gives itself, all our religion has. come, and where religion, of some sort or other, has still an empire over men's feelings such as it has nowhere else." So a very able recent writer has said: "We must never forget that not only were the founders of all the great religions of Asiatic origin, but that religion is now a more vital force in Asia than on any other continent. The deep, dreamy, spiritual insight, the brooding intellectual habit, the strength of ante cedents, that belong to the East, put religion there in a position as lofty as it is unique.* * S. E. Baldwin, " American Historical Review." Vol. XII, 239.</page><page sequence="16">SOME CONCLUSIONS OF A FREE-THINKER. Ig9 A word further deserves to be said as to the New Testament as the support of the Christian religion. Many, or some, cham pions of Christianity, especially of its theological or dogmatic claims,?its creeds and rubrics of belief?rely largely upon the Epistles of the New Testament as proofs of its divine or super natural origin, authority and power. But when evolution has swept away the foundation of the supernatural, the Epistles are reduced to mere human documents, to be looked at and passed upon as one would do in the case of confessedly secular docu ments, such as the classical writings and texts of Greece and Kome. So considered they seem to me, especially the Epistles of Paul, a mere tissue or congeries of assumptions and claims, manifestly untenable. I never could see the validity of Paul's dogmatic statements, on which the Church has depended almost as much as on the recorded words of Jesus Christ himself. Paul was a conscious or unconscious metaphysician, who sought to de velop a theology, supposedly logical, under which to bind the Church of Jesus Christ. He deserves little respect for his ef forts to pour the whole of Christian truth,?the simplicity, the natural, undogmatie ideas and teachings of Jesus Christ,?into the shallow moulds of his dogmatic statements. I think I have studied and read in the last forty years nearly, if not quite, all the Commentaries of the Christian theologians, casuists, and apologists of the Protestant faith, on Paul and his Epistles. Many of these are works of massive learning, of pro found research, and of undoubted piety. I have studied them with deep respect, but from them all I have taken no light or leading towards reasonable religious beliefs. One and all, they start with assumptions which cannot be admitted, and reach conclusions which are without validity, except on the theory that Paul and the other writers of the Epistles were, as the hackneyed phrase is, " divinely inspired." So, too, in the case of all the preachers of our Protestant churches; one and all, without exception, they adopt premises which are unproved and cannot be proved to the satisfaction of any but convinced Christians. They appeal to Bible texts, not noticing the fundamental necessity of establishing the authority, validity and truth of such texts. I aver, with confidence, that, in all the so-called logical discourses to which I have listened from Christian pulpits, there has not been one that did not as</page><page sequence="17">190 TEE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. sume the very things which a non-Christian denies and demands proof of. I do not demand that such a preacher shall establish his premises whenever he opens his mouth in the pulpit; but, when he professes to undertake a logical exposition or defence of his belief or creed, I think it is due from him to proceed logically by making good his premises. Emerson, many years ago, well called the Christian pulpit " the coward's fort." There is another topic closely connected in the minds of most with religious beliefs, though it is more properly a scientific subject,?the immortality of the soul, or simply immortality. The subject is one of never-slackening interest. It is a Christian doctrine, but it is also a belief developed and matured long be fore Christianity. It is not taught, if it is assumed or implied, in the Old Testament, but it was a favorite belief or theme of speculation with the Greek philosophers before Plato, but es pecially with Plato himself, and the men of his day and later. As upon other themes, Plato is easily the most persuasive ad vocate of the belief or doctrine. I am apt to pick up my Jowett's "Plato" whenever my mind is turned to this subject and re read, for perhaps the hundredth time, the " Phgedo." It richly repays the reading, whether one accepts its conclusions or not, for its wonderful beauty, even in Jowett's translation; but no one can really know its artistic and aesthetic charm except by an easy and familiar acquaintance with it in its original tongue. Its argument, too, is, for me, as good and strong as any I know. If Plato touched the summit of reasoning and speculation on this theme in the ancient world, Wordsworth has done the same in his " Ode " for the modern world. But, like Plato's specula tions, Wordsworth's " Ode " is too slight an argument to become the foundation of a reasonable belief. Of course, the " Ode " is, first of all, poetry, not prose ; fancy and feeling, not argument or logic. A poet, however, sees far more deeply than a logician; and I always read the great " Ode " with profound respect, as well as profound admiration. Commonly called, shortly, the " Ode on Immortality," its very title reveals at once its limita tions in the mind of its author,?"Intimations of Immortality from Becollections of Early Childhood." The title fully ex presses its scope. It professes only to draw "intimations," not a belief in immortality, and from but one source,?recollections of early childhood. Very few, I venture to think, have ever had</page><page sequence="18">SOME CONCLUSIONS OF A FREE-THINKER. IQ\ the visions or recollections which are the staple of this remarkable poem. For this reason, it can never become, I think, a really prevailing argument with the general, nor even a strong support of any kind for the doctrine of immortality. The really strongest argument for immortality is, to my mind, the wide-spread, almost universal, longing and hope of mankind that it may be true. If we could accept Paul's dictum,?faith is " the evidence of things not seen,"?we might at once pronounce the doctrine of immortality to be proved, but plainly Paul's dictum is of little or no validity or force. Looking for proofs or evidence on this topic, we see that evolu tion has nothing to tell us. It is, as it must ever be, matter of pure speculation, with no data or facts as a basis or starting point. There are one or two considerations which have always deeply impressed me in my reflections on the subject. One is the broad fact that, in all the experience of mankind, no authentic voice has ever come back to us from beyond the grave. All the yearn ings, the hopes, the agonized prayers of all the world of hu manity have drawn no response. If behind a thin veil the spirits of the departed are, and have always been, living and watching sublunary scenes, is it not well past belief that no sign or sound has pierced that veil? I, of course, put aside, with a degree of contempt which I seldom bestow on beliefs of others, the claims made of spiritual manifestations from a world beyond this world. I have never examined one such claim that did not appear un founded and absurd, if even it were not palpably fraudulent. Another important consideration has impressed me,?the over whelming improbability that the whole human race should have been or should be preserved forever. Statisticians tell us that probably no less than two hundred and eighty billions of human beings have passed across the stage of human life, since man was developed as we now see him. The process goes on, and no end can be predicted. Is it probable, even possible, as matter of reason, that such a stupendous, well-nigh inconceivable, mass of human beings, good, bad and indifferent, should be endlessly preserved ? One is forced to cry out, " Cui bono ?" and no an swer can be given which 4oes not posit an anthropomorphic God. As Emerson once said of almsgiving, "The worst of charity is that the lives you are asked to preserve are not worth preserving."</page><page sequence="19">192 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. But of all arguments against this doctrine, the strongest is the physical one. The human soul, the spirit of man, whatever the name we give it, is manifested, becomes known, acts and exercises its observed functions, so far as we can see, only through the human physical brain. This, I suppose, is universally con ceded, or is properly undeniable. In the death of the human body, the brain perishes like the rest of the parts. The soul or spirit, therefore, which, we commonly say, " tenanted the brain " in life, must perish. If the soul or spirit lives on, it must be in a new habitat and must be another soul or spirit than the one that inhabited the body here. I have read attempts to get over this difficulty in accepting the doctrine of immortality. All I can say of them is that, if they might be called ingenious speculations, they are tenuous, misty and quite inconclusive, and not even valuable as arguments. My conclusion is, therefore, on all grounds, that "Death ends all." If this conclusion cuts up some fond hopes and anticipa tions, as it undoubtedly does in the case of nearly every one, to me, like other inevitable conclusions, it has its reliefs and com pensations; for one thing, it summarily puts a quietus on the painful and gloomy thought of a system of future rewards and punishments which has so long harassed the world. For me, another pleasant result is secured; namely, that this life, if well lived, must be lived unselfishly and without hope of reward, except in the good one may do in this life. I have now set down, lying on a sick-bed, prostrated by what the best physicians pronounce a mortal and incurable malady, what I have wished to leave on record of the conclusions which I have reached at the end, or probably near the end, of a life extended beyond what is called the normal period of man's life. I here repeat, what I have said at the beginning, that I seek and wish to change no man's convictions on the themes dis cussed. I say " convictions," not beliefs traditionally received or held or lightly considered. I could wish that all might so deeply study and reflect that their beliefs might fairly be called convictions. Farther than that, I feel no concern for others in these matters. Integrity of mind, heart and life is all I seek, either for myself or for others. I cannot help thinking that one who should read these lines</page><page sequence="20">SOME CONCLUSIONS OF A FREE-THINKER. 193 might ask me questions. One might well be this: You have put aside ordinary beliefs and constraints,?how do you maintain what you, in common with others, would, I suppose, call "mor als," " moral standards," " rules of good conduct," conduct which Matthew Arnold calls " three-fourths of life and duty " ? The question deserves answer. Man's moral sense is the re sult primarily of evolution. " The moral sense," in the view of evolutionary philosophy, " is not ultimate, but derivative, having been built up out of slowly organized and duly transmitted an cestral experiences of pleasure and pain." Here is the rock on which I rest and risk all,?a slowly developed sense which is intended, if one may use the word in this connection, and fitted, to lead men to good conduct, as well as a test and touchstone when doubts arise of what is good conduct. What can be safer? It is not the shifting sands of men's opinions, " apparitions of a day," or the precepts of a book, or the rubrics and decrees of a church, but the granite rock of experience, running continually through all the ages and periods of the existence of this frame of things. " Here I stand ; I can do no otherwise." Another possible question might be : How do you feel that your present conclusions have affected your moral character and your happiness ? It is certainly difficult for one to pass judgment on one's character, but here I answer, frankly and confidently, that I feel that my moral sense and nature have been uplifted, purified and strengthened by my present conclusions as I have now stated them. I feel it. I think I know it. Moreover, I do not believe any one who knows me has suspected or marked any falling off in my later years. As to happiness, I can speak more safely. I know that my present views have added to my happiness. I cannot say, as Newman said, after he had reached the haven of the Komish Church,?" I have since had no trace of doubt, but only the most perfect certitude"; but I can at least say that I know of no earthly inducement which could lead me to go back to what now seems to me the darkness and unrest of former days and beliefs. I have had no little difficulty in fixing upon a truly descriptive title for these lines. "Atheist," "infidel," "unbeliever," "ag nostic," all are objectionable as hackneyed, cant words. "Athe VOL. CLXXXVI.?no. 623. 13</page><page sequence="21">194 THE NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW. ist " is too narrow. I am much more than a mere atheist, for I reject the whole Christian religion. " Infidel " and " unbeliever " are indefinite, almost meaningless; neither etymologically nor according to usage do they describe me. " Agnostic " is also too indefinite. I think we know many things, though ignorant of many. If the word meant only that we did not know all, or comparatively much, I might adopt it as others have done. At last it has seemed to me that " free-thinker " was the truly descriptive phrase. It means and implies no more nor less than appears on its face. I am as well aware, in concluding this review of one phase of my history and stating some of the conclusions in which I now rest, as any possible critic who might read these lines could be, that I am but one against millions, far less than "the voice of one crying in the wilderness"; but when one believes one has found the right way, what is there for one but to fare forward in the never-ending quest of truth, right living and good conduct? My only strong wish and aim throughout my career in the respects with which these lines are concerned have been to be en tirely fearless in investigation and clear-sighted in finding a way to the truth. I think these lines from Omar Khayyam have some application to me: " If I myself upon a looser creed Have loosely strung the jewel of good deed, Let this one thing for my atonement plead, That one for two I never did misread."</page></plain_text>
