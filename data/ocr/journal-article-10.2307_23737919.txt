<plain_text><page sequence="1">HUMANIST DELIVERS AN UNINVITED LECTURE TO SCIENTISTS Ludovico Settembrini Suppose that on august 2, 1939, President Roosevelt re ceived a letter signed by T. S. Eliot informing him that as a result of certain discoveries made in obscure, specialized li braries on the continent it was now possible to devise the key which would unlock the secret of the Shakespearean cipher and thereby give the United States control over the most overwhelming force ever known to man. Suppose that on the basis of this information, President Roosevelt decided to gamble untold millions of dollars on a top-priority, top secret project to prove its feasibility. Suppose that three years later, on December 2, 1942, a small team of Shakespearean scholars in a secluded corner of the University of Chicago Library established that the theoretical formulation was in fact practical. Suppose that another three years later, on July 16, 1945, in the deserts of New Mexico, the first full scale demonstration was conducted in the greatest secrecy before a small, awe-stricken group of Shakespeareans. Sup pose that less than a month later, on August 6, 1945, an un believing world was shown what power lay in the secret of the Shakespearean cipher, now in the hands of the United States. And suppose, finally, that I was one of the small group of Shakespeareans both at the University of Chicago and in New Mexico who worked on the critical test and its later proof. It is now 21 years later, and, at the age of 50, I am a well established, and, if I may say so, even distinguished Shake spearean scholar. I hold the chair of Shakespeare studies at a most reputable university which is convinced that the prestige of my presence is worth the loss of my teaching and the time I spend away from campus, especially since 85% of my salary 262</page><page sequence="2">AN UNINVITED LECTURE and research budget is paid, not by the university, but by gov ernment and industry contracts which, incidentally, I am free to take with me when and where I wish to go. My schol arly reputation was originally based on a piece of pure, disin terested research on the use of the couplet in the plays as hid den stage direction. By sheer chance, it has turned out that it was from this very quarter that the cipher could be most quickly broken and it was for this reason that I was invited to join the original team of secret researchers. Nevertheless, I first pursued, and continue to pursue, this study for its own sake, as a kind of play of the mind which has no other end than the demonstration of the way things actually work in Shakespeare; I need and seek no other justification for my re search. At the same time, the more I learn about the couplet as hidden stage direction, the more I learn about the Shake spearean cipher, and the more I learn about the cipher, the more I find myself deeper and deeper in the heart of our mili tary-economic-university research complex which has be come to such a large degree dependent on the perpetuation of the study of the cipher in all its ramifications. For it turns out that what I know about Shakespeare, Du Pont needs to know about a new fiber with unlimited commercial possi bilities; it is therefore natural that I should become, not an employee of Du Pont because that would be too crass for a pure research man like me, but a consultant to Du Pont. And of course what I know about Shakespeare is also precisely what the Shakespeare Energy Commission needs to know about the military applications of the cipher; again, it is natural that I should become, not an employee of the SEC, for, as I said, I am a pure theoretical Shakespearean, but a con sultant for it. And since the practical applications of the cipher now play such a leading role in domestic and foreign policy, I find myself a frequent visitor to Washington, to testify at Defense Department meetings and before Congres sional committees and on TV interview programs. In fact, what with my many commitments to government and to in dustry, not to mention invitations to appear at international gatherings of Shakespeareans in every part of the civilized 263</page><page sequence="3">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW world where work on the cipher is going on, more and more of my research is actually done by my assistants and graduate students, and they are glad of it, for my name ahead of theirs on an article in SHAKESPEARE QUARTERLY means for them a first-class job in a first-class institution, their first step —and I should add, a quicker and easier one than mine—up the same academic ladder I have climbed. When, on those occasions I can be on campus and have lunch at the faculty club, I am gently twitted by my col leagues who cannot refrain from pointing out to me that my absences have not gone altogether unnoticed, I smile and say nothing, but to those colleagues in the sciences who are not a little envious of my ability to get government, industry, and foundation support for my research, I say: "After all, the cul ture of the sciences was the dominant one in our society for centuries; now it is the turn of the humanities." When they respond somewhat sharply to this, I remark with a bit more asperity: "And look what your culture has managed to ac complish [accompanied by a sniff] in all its centuries of domi nance." But I soften the blow by pointing out to them that as the fortunate result of the overheads which accrue to the university from my grants, their research is being subsidized as well. To those who complain that my demands for bigger and better libraries and more specialized collections of Shake speareana are forcing education into a bricks and mortar real estate operation, I reply that their cyclotrons and computers take up a lot of space and cost a lot of money too, and that when they have the chance to jump on the contract band wagon, they have no more hesitation in abandoning their stu dents than I do, and besides, the favorable publicity which my projects bring the university hasn't hurt them, financially and otherwise. To those who object to my relationship with Du Pont, I have to point out that these are changed times, that Shake spearean studies can no longer be carried on in the ivory tower, that it takes team-work and equipment and money, and that the alliance between industry and education is of equal necessity and benefit to both. To those who criticize 264</page><page sequence="4">AN UNINVITED LECTURE me for my connection with the SEC, I say that while I would be the first to return to my original, disinterested Shakespeare scholarship, the national defense demands that we be pre pared; our national prestige makes it imperative that we lead the world in this crucial field, no matter what the cost; and as long as the Russians also carry on applied Shakespeare stud ies, we dare do no less; indeed, we must always do more, for in the long run this is the only language they understand. It is indeed true that in other circumstances the need for devel oping nuclear weapons and space platforms and moon-shots —in fact, all those technological advances which could wipe out disease and poverty and the rest of the ills of man—these would surely take precedence in any really decent and hu mane kind of world but this is the way the world is now and we must face up to it. And to those who accuse me of im morality and irresponsibility, I answer that if I didn't do it, some one else would; that I can't help it if the truth which is derived from Shakespeare studies turns out to be what it is and is therefore capable of the applications which have been made of it; that any dedicated Shakespearean must relentlessly follow the truth, no matter where it leads him and no matter what others may do with what he discovers; he alone cannot be responsible for the deeds of all men. Indeed, I should be betraying the great tradition of Shakespearean study if I allowed myself to be distracted from my research which I carry on by methods of inquiry sanctified by years of selfless devotion to it by other, greater Shakespeareans than I. For if the duty of scientists is, as they claim, to Science alone, then the duty of the humanist must be to the Humanities alone. For if we should stop, who knows what greater dis coveries we would be prevented from making, what advances in knowledge, what benefits to man? II I know that by now you want to scream at me that I exagger ate criminally; that, by and large, most scientists are no bet ter off, so far as salary, equipment, prestige, and power are concerned, than are humanists; that I have confused the ways 265</page><page sequence="5">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW of thought and work as well as the purposes of mathema ticians, pure and applied; scientists, pure and applied; techni cians; engineers; and administrators; and that I have mali ciously burdened the many with the sins of a few. I concede quite readily that the overwhelming number of scientists are decent, humane, modest, underpaid family men who love their fellow-men, including even humanists. But that is not the point. The point is that scientists have created a mythos to account for their ethos, and it is my contention that this mythos, with its corresponding ethos, has enabled them to develop an attitude which justifiably—to them—separates and frees them from the obligations and responsibilities of other men. And it is my further contention that scientists cannot claim this exemption, not on the basis of what they do, nor with how they do it, nor with the consequences of what they do. I hasten to add that the mythos and ethos of science are not the dark and deliberate fabrications of a single arch-scientist nor of a cabal of scientists and I am not accusing scientists of hatching a plot against mankind in general and the humanities in particular. All I am saying is that a certain way of viewing phenomena which scientists share to a lesser or greater degree, that is, their mythos, determines a certain way of dealing with the effects and implications of what they do, which again scientists share to a lesser or greater degree, that is, their ethos. It is these "certain ways" which I should like to consider. I began with the assumption, which I trust will not be chal lenged, that scientists are men like other men. If this is so, as I naturally assume it is so, then Science is nothing more than what men who are called scientists do. Science is therefore neither supra- nor super-human; it is not a moral imperative to which mere mortals must be helplessly subservient; it is not a Platonic deity outside and above them which determines the course of their actions, irrespective of what they might otherwise wish. To adapt the words of Lewis Mumford from another context, scientists are not the passive agents of some supernatural power known as Science. If science, then, is what scientists do, it is subject to the same human frailty and 266</page><page sequence="6">AN UNINVITED LECTURE error which all the other pursuits of men share. And if it is so subject, it cannot be free of the ordinary motivations, passions, and prejudices of ordinary men. To be sure, this is all very obvious, but it is so obvious that it is often forgotten. Men, including scientists, are all too prone to elevate man made intellectual notions into universal, eternal, and tran scendent Ideas which thereupon assume the status of a greater than human fiat; their all too human origins forgotten, they are now incapable of being affected by the very men who made them. The history of ideas is in effect the lesson of the mischief and worse, which such ideas have wrought, and it is decidedly worth warning against the tendency to trans form science, that is, what scientists can do, into Science, that is, what scientists must do. A prime instance of this tendency at work is the idea of nature as assumed by most scientists. Science claims that it seeks to discover the laws by which nature functions; it fur ther claims that these laws are observable, measurable, and predictable; that they are moreover regular, orderly, and in variable (at least in the gross); and that finally they are dis obeyed, so to speak, only at man's peril. In other words, nature has been given a personality with sharply defined psy chological attributes and ethical qualities. I will not go so far as to suggest that this characterization of nature is nothing more than an up-dated version of the jealous and irascible god of ancient myth and the Old Testament. Rather, I should prefer to point out that what the scientist seems to be doing unconsciously is to read into nature anthropomorphic traits, under the stress of what psychological impulses I do not know, which he needs to find there, and then, by an even more fascinating psychological process, reverses himself to say now, that since these traits were really there before he found them, they must therefore have been, are, and will be eternal, immutable, and objectively outside of men and so constitute a force to which men must yield. I am almost tempted to add this force must be propitiated by the perform ance of appropriate rituals, i.e., scientific method, adminis tered by an instructed and initiated priesthood, the sole 267</page><page sequence="7">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW guardians and manipulators of the mystery, i.e., scientists. If this is so, then it cannot be taken for granted that the phenomena which science observes and describes are the way in which nature really operates; it can only be said that this is the way it appears to work to us as men. Indeed, we cannot even say that they are in fact laws of nature; we can only say that this is what we in our particular time and place and in terms of our particular physical and mental constitution believe we see. In other words, the statements of science must be taken as the fallible statements of fallible men who, like all of us, suffer from the limitations of our creation. When we are told that there are now exemptions to the law of parity, we have to remember that nature never passed such a law in the first place and was therefore under no necessity of re pealing it afterwards. The longing for order, regularity, and unity is altogether understandable, and scientists are far from being the only men to be affected by it. It is man's pro test—deep-rooted, age-old, even heroic, though it would be more accurate to say, tragic—protest against the utter indiffer ence of creation; it is the desire for security in a universe too large, too strange, and too unconcerned for human comfort, comprehension, and control; yet it must be recognized for what it is—a man-made prop, ingenious, inventive, inspiring, what you will, but for all that, still man-made and therefore man-limited. If scientists can deride humanistic concern for myth as naive, sentimental, and undisciplined, then it is only fair to point out that they themselves are no less liable to the sin of self-deception by arrogant and uncritical faith in the operations of the mind when it takes the form in their case, not of myth or of art, but of science. I am yet to be convinced that the mind of the scientist is sui generis, its mode of opera tion unique, its results ineluctable. I have suggested that the concept of nature is a conception of man; as such, it has had a fascinating history. No less fasci nating has been the history of the idea of science. And if we study the history of science, we find that the modern attitude toward science as a way of life distinctively different from other modes of thought and behavior is a recent innovation, 268</page><page sequence="8">AN UNINVITED LECTURE that the divorce of science from the other areas of intellectual activity is likewise recent, and that there is just about as much acceptance-rejection of ideas in science as in any other field of speculation. Most of all, we learn that science, far from being a self-contained system which proceeds by its own special laws of behavior and is responsible only to its own self-determined rules, is in fact a most intimate part of the history of society; that its problems which seem so unique to it, so self-contained within its own structure, so self-gen erating, and so distant and alien from the other affairs of men, are in fact problems handed to it, so to speak, by society, though admittedly, the steps between the problem in its final scientific form and its ultimate origins are many and often self-eradicating; and that its recent efforts to disentangle itself from ethical and social responsibility go counter to its own traditions, particularly those established in the seventeenth century in England. In other words, science, like all the pur suits of man, is not outside but deep within history, and more so today than at any other time in its development. The hu manist, knowing that he is blind, knows how circumscribed is his vision of the elephant, and it is offensive to him as a human being to be taunted for his blindness by another blind man. Incidentally, I am quite aware of the antiquity of my arguments; I do not think, however, that they are thereby invalidated. Ill To return now to myself to what I am, which is a student and teacher of literature, especially of Shakespeare. I cannot say that what I do has no effects; it does. I cannot say that I am not responsible for the consequences of my work; I am. I cannot say that I cannot help what I say and write about Shakespeare; I do. I cannot say that the justification for what I do is outside and beyond my power to affect; it is not. As a scholar and teacher, I am responsible for what I do and say; and I am responsible as a scholar and teacher in the same way that I am responsible as a citizen and as a human being. I have my principles, such as they are; I know where I derive 269</page><page sequence="9">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW them and I know pretty well what their strengths and weak nesses are; but having made my choice, I abide, often uncom fortably I must confess, by the consequences of that choice; but above all, I do not seek to have it both ways. I do not come to you and say: "Look what I have done; now what are you going to do about it?" Either I have made up my mind not to do it because I think it is wrong to start with, or I do it because I think it is right, and I defend myself in the best way I can. I defend myself by appeals to human reason, hu man knowledge, and human decency, knowing all the time how fallible, uncertain, and capricious they are; but I know of no other appeals except appeals to a law and a will greater than man, and those I refuse to accede to because I know how cruel, arbitrary, and unjust they have been and are. I do not ask for special favors because of the mystery of my pro fession nor do I claim a special mystique for its methods; I am nothing more than a man who makes his living by teach ing and research and I am no different inside my classroom and carrell than I am outside of them. In short, I do not separate the man from his work, and especially so in our so ciety which defines a man much less by his ancestry or class than by his occupation, by what he does. If we look at the matter of responsibility more closely, I think we shall find that the humanist has as many and much the same problems in his research and teaching as does the scientist. To begin with, the humanist is confronted by the same problem of choice: What shall he study? The range of subject matter in the humanities is so overwhelming that I must, out of ignorance, confine myself to literature, but even with this limitation the range of choice is still enormous. The student of literature can devote himself to the trivial as well as to the significant, but if he does, the onus is squarely on him; all things in the humanities are not equal to each other. We have our pedants and our timeservers no less than science but we do not excuse them on the grounds that all is grist to our research mill. The mythos of science defends the scientist's choice of what he studies by asserting that nothing is without interest, for everything is a part of nature: 270</page><page sequence="10">AN UNINVITED LECTURE smallness, largeness; significance, insignificance; useful, use less; meaningful, meaningless; good, bad—all these value terms, in the context of the scientific mythos, simply have no relevance. Like the mountain which had to be climbed be cause it was there, all scientific questions have to be answered because they have been raised. This is romantic nonsense, just as it is nonsense to exempt the scientist from the ordinary rules of human relationship simply because he happens to have the gift of the faculty for intellectual abstraction, but here I fear there is as much snobbery and childish behavior among artists and scholars as there is among scientists; the sin of pride is endemic to intellectuals. Moreover, a teacher is confronted with the problem of choosing which works he will teach; he cannot teach them all and he must therefore carefully select what he will present to his class for he is well aware that what he has his students read will condition their taste and judgment, and this is no small responsibility. By and large, we try to choose works of literature which, by accepted lit erary standards, are first-rate; again, we do not say every thing is equally interesting and equally worth pursuing; on the contrary, we deliberately select in order to change and to improve the habits of mind and of taste of our students. The signal value of literature is that it depicts a range of experience as wide, as intense, and as varied as life itself, only far more heightened, deepened, and sharpened. But that very quality brings with it a danger: not only are there more badly written books than well written ones, there are more bad books, ethically, than good ones. By this I do not mean obscenity or anything as stupidly elementary as that; I mean books which portray life as easier or less painful or more sim ple or more sentimental than we know it to be. We reject such books on the grounds that they are bad for our stu dents; we say such books prettify and therefore falsify. We strive that our students should obtain from their reading and our discussions a view of life which is hard yet ennobling, one which recognizes the depths and heights of which men are simultaneously capable, which forces them to see that it is only by overcoming evil through suffering that man can raise 271</page><page sequence="11">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW himself above himself, and even if that rise is at best but brief and bought with pain, it is worth the effort simply to show that man can be human. We do not accept the world as it is, and even in utopia we would be critical, and that is why, at bottom, the humanities are feared. It will be objected that I am imposing a dogmatism not unlike that I accused the scien tists of holding; if so, it is a dogmatism so undefined, inde fensible, and personal as to be no dogmatism at all; and I should be lucky if it should gain my own assent. IV It has become a commonplace in recent discussion of the re lations of the humanities to science to say that while the two pursue different methods of inquiry, they both aim at the same ultimate end, which is, the establishment of a viable modus vivendi between man and his environment. I myself have been guilty of this pious if pleasant fabrication but I must confess that despite my best intentions I am no longer able to hold to this view. I do not know if the reason for the difference is one of the disciplines involved or of a fundamen tal dissimilarity in temperament which drives one man to become a humanist and another a scientist, but it seems to me that there is a decided difference between the way each views phenomena and that as a consequence of that difference the two modes for the apprehension, comprehension, and sys tematization of experience must remain apart, and perhaps even competitive with each other. To be sure, both humanist and scientist begin with particulars, but, unlike the scientist, the humanist anticipates no generalizations, or if he does, these are generalizations of such limited scope that to dignify them into laws of behavior appears ridiculous to him. In fact, he would be shocked and dismayed to find literature exhibit ing characteristics capable of being subsumed within such categories as regularity, uniformity, and conformity. Indeed, the usual touchstones of science—standardization of proce dure, consistency, reliability, predictability, and verifiability, particularly of the statistical sort—seem to him unhelpful, and even harmful, in his confrontation of literature. I must admit 272</page><page sequence="12">AN UNINVITED LECTURE that under the influence of 19th century science, it was thought possible to apply the techniques of classification to literary study, but not only was the analogy of scientific method to literary method false in itself, but the very source of the analogy, science as descriptive, broke down under the im pact of the new mathematics and the new physics, and, so far as I know, no serious effort has since been made to apply the method of quantification to literary analysis. Since then, the study of literature has returned to its proper business, en riched, to be sure, by insights derived from science, partic ularly anthropology and psychology, but once more concerned with the qualitative analysis of works of art, that is, the per ception, discrimination, and evaluation of the individual and unique in the specific piece itself. Thus, to take a simple example, we find that there are many hexameral poems in the Renaissance and 17th century which are devoted to the same subject matter, that is, the narration of the events of creation as depicted in Genesis, and which therefore use substantially the same characters, incidents, allu sions, images, and language. The task of the student of lit erature is not merely to show in what ways those works are alike; that is a relatively simple matter of literary history. His real job is to distinguish with all the knowledge and sen sitivity at his command the unique qualities of Milton's PARADISE LOST which differentiate it from the hexameral tradition from which it stems, and to determine why, despite all its similarities with other poems on the same theme, PARADISE LOST is a better and greater poem. Thus, like the scientist, the humanist is on the lookout for similarities in dissimilarity, but unlike the scientist, he uses similarities not additively, to build up generalizations of quantification from them, but differentially, to discriminate the qualitative differ ences which distinguish objects from each other. And even when he essays generalizations based on the accumulation of data, such as concepts of genre, form, period, and style, his concern is still with the qualities of his quantifications. Thus the humanist sees the world, not in terms of abstractions which must of necessity trim and square off the particular so 273</page><page sequence="13">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW it may be fitted into the aggregate, but in terms of qualities which set apart the particulars from the aggregate. So where the scientist reads wavelengths, the humanist sees colors, hears sounds, savors tastes, sniffs odors, feels textures; where the scientist endeavors to bring more and more disparate phe nomena under the rule of fewer, simpler, yet ever more em bracing laws, and, in the very process of expanding the uni verse, contracts it into formulae, the humanist voyages with Odysseus, cries aloud with Oedipus, rages with Lear, laughs with Don Quixote, loves with Don Juan, despairs with K., and finds the contemplation of the richness of human experi ence prodigal and puzzling enough to satisfy his ambition. Yet this account of the methods of literary study ought not to sound too strange to scientific ears. For if I under stand the implications of recent developments in physics correctly, it would seem that one of the most fruitful conse quences of uncertainty theory is that it has forced the physi cist to treat the ultimate particles of matter as distinct indi viduals with wills of their own strong enough and mischiev ous enough to change their shapes and direction as their inclinations impel them; one must, in fact, grant them the old-fashioned attribute of character and therefore treat them as persons and not as mere numbers. I rather like the notion of nature as having what can only be described as a puckish sense of humor, though I must say that as a layman it worries me not a little to realize that the airplane in which I plan to fly next week and with what had been the greatest confi dence in the mathematics and engineering of its manufacture is actually composed of countless numbers of infinitesimal particles any one of which might at any time take it into its little head to stray out of its accustomed orbit. But then I remember the horror which greeted the idea that the hitherto solid billiard balls known as atoms were really vast reaches of emptiness faintly populated by electrical charges, and I am assured that while particles may act irresponsibly on the sub atomic level, they are quite mature in their behavior at the macroscopic stage. The concept of nature as ironic, capri cious, even existential is certainly congenial to the modern 274</page><page sequence="14">AN UNINVITED LECTURE mind, and then that reminds me that the concept of nature as daring and heroic was equally congenial to the Renaissance mind, as was the concept of nature as cool and elegantly sim ple to the neo-classic mind, as was the concept of nature as organic to the Romantic mind, and as was the concept of nature as dignified, orderly, and correct to the Victorian mind. One wonders, in short, if science is not after all, like the arts and letters, a reflection of the minds of the men who practice it, a style of vision, noble in aspiration, but, like the arts and letters too, doomed by the mutually reinforcing bars of physiological limitation and its corresponding linguistic and conceptual inadequacy to eternal imprisonment in the narrow cell of self. V I should like to raise one more point. There are scientists who will admit that they do work which is intended for the de struction of man but excuse it on the grounds that out of this work come applications of social utility. Only the other day I read a news release from NASA which proudly declared that as a byproduct of our space effort the American house wife can now enjoy the benefits of pyroceram, teflon, and quick freezing in her kitchen. To which I can only reply: "O monstrousl but one half-penny-worth of bread to this intol erable deal of sack!" Is it really true that only under the stimulus of war does scientific knowledge make its greatest leaps forward? If so, this is an indictment of all of us, scien tists not excepted. A variant of this argument is that scien tists cannot be held responsible for what happens to their work after it leaves their labs (this seems to be an argument which, however, cuts very little ice with companies which hold profitable government contracts as witness the Wohlge muth-Goodrich case). Apparently it is the bad men in indus try and in government who convert and corrupt scientific achievement to bad ends. And who are these bad men in in dustry and in government? They are college graduates, educated by us and given our stamp of approval, scientists again not exempted. Have scientists forgotten that they are 275</page><page sequence="15">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW teachers too? They talk as though their only responsibility was to their work, but if anything goes wrong outside of their labs, it is always the fault of others. But given the pres tige they now enjoy, is it not fair to say that the pedagogical responsibility of scientists is now greater rather than less? And I would ask: How many humanists are there in positions of power in industry and in government and in education compared with physical and social scientists? It is now just a hundred years ago that Huxley first voiced the demand of scientists for a greater role in the decision making processes of society; that demand has been met with a greater response than even Huxley dared hope. But if history proved the scien tists' case against the classicists was right, has not history like wise demonstrated the failure of science as well? The sad truth is that neither humanist before nor scientist now can escape the verdict of moral and social failure. Please do not think that I am an intellectual Luddite. I am grateful for the speed of my typewriter in putting down these thoughts, for the warmth and safety of my home as I type on this cold and blustery night, for the ease and con venience with which I air-mail my manuscript. But I can not help being alarmed at the price we are being called on to pay for these comforts, and, like everything else connected with the cost of living, the price is inexorably rising. The fearsome alliance of science, technology, industry, govern ment, education, and the war machine appears to me to be gripping the ordinary citizen more and more tightly; the more it demands of him, the less answerable it is to him; un der the guise of his protection, it creates the conditions for his destruction; and since what it does it does in the name of all, it is liable to no one. What terrifies me is that in all this vast army, there is no one who can be called on to account, who can be told to stop, who can stop it; everyone who is caught up in it becomes his neighbor's pawn; all have become the worshippers of a gray and faceless force they themselves have made. Yet I as a humanist can never accept a way of looking at the world which converts men and their deeds into statistical abstractions subject to blind and immutable 276</page><page sequence="16">AN UNINVITED LECTURE laws. Each individual is precious to me, even the ones I hate, for if scientists do not, I admit to my passions and prejudices. All the variety of men and their actions is wonderful to me, even at the very same moment that I fight with all my might against the ideas and actions of men I condemn, and I do not see this as a contradiction. As a humanist, I have many mis deeds, historically and personally, to answer for, but I am aware of and responsible for what I do—or fail to do. If science means nothing more than knowledge and a scientist is one who is a lover of knowledge, then I too am a scientist. Like the scientist, I too seek the truth, not in the same ways that he does nor in the same areas of search, but I do not claim that mine are the only ways of seeking nor mine the only places to explore. I agree with my friends in science that I neglect what they know at my peril; I wish they would agree with me that they neglect what I know at their—and my—peril. 277</page></plain_text>
