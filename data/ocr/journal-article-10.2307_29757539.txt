<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Discovery of a Funerary Ritual Inanna/Ishtar and Her Descent to the Nether World in Titri? H?y?k, Turkey by Nicola Laneri Inanna and Geshtinanna went to the edges of the steppe. They found Dumuzi weeping. Inanna took Dumuzi by the hand and said: 'You will go to the underworld half the year. Your sister, since she has asked, will go the other half. On the day you are called, that day you will be taken. On the day Geshtinanna is called, that day you will be set free'. Inanna placed Dumuzi in the hands of the eternal. Holy Ereshkigal! Great is your renown! Holy Ereshkigal! I sing your praises! (From the end of 'The Descent of Inanna to the Nether World', in Wolkstein &amp; Kramer 1983: 89) In July 1991 a group of international archaeologists directed by Guillermo Algaze (University of California, San Diego) commenced the excavation of the site Titri? H?y?k in Turkey, after having completed a preliminary survey of the lower basin of the Turkish Euphrates valley (Algaze, Misir &amp; Wilkinson 1992; Algaze et al. 1995). Titri? H?y?k is a site totaling 45 hectors and is located approximately 45 km North of Sanliurfa, in an area not far from the Euphrates valley (Fig. 1) (*). The site's Southern border is demarcated by the stream Tavuk Qay, which was wider and directly connected to the Euphrates during ancient times (Matney &amp; Algaze 1995; Matney, Algaze &amp; Pittman 1997; Matney et al. 1999; Algaze et al. 1995, 2001). Titrig H?y?k main period of occupation occurred during the 3rd millennium B.C.E. (Fig. 2). This early occupation (Early Early Bronze Age, c. 3000-2700 B.C.E.) * This article has been written during my period of stay (2000-2001) at Columbia University's Department of Anthropology as a Visiting Scholar with a Fulbright Fellowship.

(*) Today the lake created by the Ataturk Dam, built on the Euphrates valley during the 80s, is about one or 2 miles north-west of the site. [1] 9</page><page sequence="2">was situated on the top of the mound, the site 1 ha. Acropolis, as well as in the Lower Town and in the area immediately around it (Algaze et al. 1995). During the second (Mid Early Bronze Age, c. 2700-2400/2350 B.C.E.) and third (Late Early Bronze Age, c. 2350-2100 B.C.E.) phases, Titri? H?y?k grew first in the Outer Town, followed by an expansion into the Lower Town, which contained a peripheral flint working area belonging to the second phase and residing approximately 400 m east of the main city wall (Algaze et al. 2001). This fortification was built during the two later phases to provide better protection for the city from external enemies, during a period in which Titrig H?y?k reached its maximum economic acme and territorial expansion (Matney et al. 1999; Algaze et al. 2001). In the second phase an extramural cemetery was created outside of the town at about 400 m west of the city wall, and in the third phase the cemetery went out of use (Algaze et al. 1995; Honga and Algaze 1998; Laneri, in press) (Fig. 2). At this time the entire town was planned with a precise and impressive urban regularity, in which wide streets, c. 2 m wide, and alleyways, both in the Outer and Lower Town, connected the private dwellings to different sections of the town (Matney et al. 1999). The domestic structures were built in an architectural style reminiscent of 3rd millennium B.C.E. Mesopotamian houses, such as Tell Asmar and Abu Salabikh (Postgate 1980; Matney &amp; Algaze 1995; Algaze et al. 2001), in which the main courtyard was the center of daily life activities and was linked to both the surrounding rooms and the working areas (Matney, Algaze and Pittman 1997). Here the archaeologists found important working features and tools still in situ, such as plastered basins for processing grapes, grinding tools for preparing flour, flint tools ('Canaanean Blades'), a limestone 'trinket' mould for casting metal objects, and large storage jars {ibid). During this period intramural tombs were built inside Titri? H?y?k houses, with the typical private dwelling usually containing at least one funerary chamber constructed in a single room or inside the main courtyard (Laneri 1999). At the beginning of the 2nd millennium B.C.E. (Late Early/Middle Bronze Age, c. 2100-1800 B.C.E.) the main areas of both the Lower and Outer Town were abandoned and some of the private dwellings' rooms were reused for the deposition of the deceased (Laneri, in press). At this time part of the population probably resided in the Acropolis, while others moved elsewhere, but only further archaeological excavations will solve these unanswered questions. After this phase no additional archaeological information became available until Hellenistic and Roman times, when only some areas of the town were reoccupied (Algaze et al. 1995). One of the most fascinating aspects of Titri? H?y?k is represented by its ancient funerary customs and their transformation throughout the site's periods of occupation. Many of the questions that have emerged from the analytical process still need to be solved, such as the fact that in the later phase the 'outside' tombs (extramural cemetery) were moved 'inside' the houses (intramural tombs) and incorporated into the construction of the private dwellings (Laneri, in press). Despite such ambiguities, it is clear from the archaeological records that the rite de passage of burying the dead in Titri? H?y?k during the second half of the 3rd 10 [2]</page><page sequence="3">A MODERN CITY 0 75_150 km N Fig. 1 - Map of the Syro-Anatolian Euphrates Valley. (After Wattenmaker 1994: fig. 40). millennium B.C.E. was considered by the community of the living as an opportunity to establish a strong connection between aspects of their socio-economic, cultural, and religious systems and their essential ideological framework. During this period the funerary rituals can be further characterized by: an increase in the diversity of [3] 11</page><page sequence="4">religious beliefs, such as devotion to ancestral spirits and probably to symbolic divinities; symbolic productive activities, such as the act of processing grapes and making wine; and the fundamental importance of the corpse and its treatment in the act of reinforcing the religious power of the world of the ancestors and their role in the devotion to fertility by the communities of the living. In the following text I attempt to gain a better understanding of these funerary rituals beginning with the known data (Act I). The second phase (Act II) is dedicated to the interpretation of the archaeological data and a funerary ritual which links the processing and consumption of wine to the concept of death, fertility, and re-birth in the establishment of religious beliefs within the communities of Titri? H?y?k. In the final phase (Act III) the process of reconstruction is used to formulate a historical reconstruction in the present of those ancient funerary rituals. The aim of this process is to create a story through which the burial customs of Titri? H?y?k are clarified. Each phase of this story is centered around the use of a completely different analytical approach, each of which can be characterized by the following schools of archaeological analysis, - empirical/neopositivist - Act I; - interpretative/postmodernist - Act II; - reconstructive/historical-romanticist - Act III; all of which are crucial to the practice of analyzing, understanding, interpreting and, finally, communicating to the external public ancient forms of social organization in the present. The story written in this paper is grounded on real facts and analyzed according to archaeological data, but in the act of reconstruction (Act III) I let my imagination fly through speculations based on real archaeological data from the 3rd millennium B.C.E. site of Titrig H?y?k, Turkey, and through the reading of Ancient Near Eastern mythological texts concerning the relationship between several goddesses (Inanna/Ishtar-Ereshkigal-Geshtinanna), a god (Enki), mythological characters (Gilgamesh-Enkidu-Dumuzi/Tammuz) and the Underworld. Throughout this process I try to bear in mind the chronological and geographical links between the texts and the archaeological contexts of Titri? H?y?k, but in certain cases I overstep the contextual line represented by the text and attempt to use other comparable mythological literature useful for this re-constructive process. In the practice of re? construction I sometimes lean towards a speculative attitude, because I view it as necessary for creating fictional archaeology in the present. Many scholars, including myself, are extremely concerned about the idea of re? constructing the past for analytical purposes because of the likelihood of misinterpreting unprovable facts. But in recent years I have realized that everybody tends to subjectively re-construct their past in order to normalize its irregularities. This is part of our ancestral attitude towards the past, in which it is viewed as a better place than the present. In this analytical process the de-constructive approach of analysis is 12 [4]</page><page sequence="5">\ I I Fig. 2 - Map of Titri? H?y?k. (After Matney &amp; Algaze 1993: fig. 2). instrumental for interpreting the role of the symbolic and metaphoric meanings of material culture in the creation of diverse socio-cultural creatures, such as rituals, myths, techniques, and others (Act II). The use of the imagination is the key to bringing these ancient creatures and their ideological structures, which may or may not have existed in the past, to our present fantasies. Thus, following this logic, we archaeologists have the right to use our imaginations to re-create ancient cultural processes in the present using the available data in the most accurate and reliable manner possible. Act I Data Extramural Cemeteries The most ancient Titri? H?y?k tomb, belonging to the beginning of the 3rd millennium B.C.E. (Early Bronze Age, c. 3000-2600 B.C.E.), was discovered in the Lower Town during the 1993 campaign (Laneri, in press). It was probably part of a larger extramural cemetery of the main h?y?k (Fig. 2). Little archaeological data from other areas of the settlement belong to this phase (Matney &amp; Algaze 1995).

The corpse is that of a woman with the typical pathologies of an old person (Honga &amp; Algaze 1998). Both the corpse and structure of the tomb are oriented E-W and the skeleton is articulated, flexed, and positioned on its left side (Laneri, in press). The funerary goods found close to the skull include three cups, two small jars, and one jar of the Plain Simple Ware type (Algaze et al. 1995). During the subsequent Mid Early Bronze Age Phase (c. 2700-2350 B.C.E.), a large extramural cemetery was built outside of Titri? H?y?k, which as mentioned before, is located about 400 m West of the main city wall (Algaze et al. 1995) (Fig. 2). A total of fifteen tombs were discovered here during the excavation s 1994 summer (Honca &amp; Algaze 1998), but unfortunately the entire funerary complex was badly disturbed by modern plowing as well as by looting. Thus, it has been very difficult to redefine the original ancient boundaries of the cemetery. Even the tombs brought to light in 1994 are not in perfect condition, which has contributed to the discontinuation of digging in this area during subsequent excavation campaigns. Each of the tombs are cist-graves with the exception of the biggest, B94.54, which is a chamber tomb (5 x 3.5 m) with a semi-circular shaped dromos and a few steps that go down into the main room. The structure of this major grave is similar to the later intramural tombs (Laneri, in press). The topographic distribution of these graves is clustered, with the bigger one surrounded by smaller cist-graves. The majority of the extramural tombs are oriented E-W, with a few exceptions having a S-N direction. Although there is very little information about the content of the graves, the skeletons, and the funerary goods as a result of the badly disturbed context, it is possible to make some general statements based on the data retrieved throughout the archaeological excavation, such as: 1. the tombs are mostly of multiple and primary deposition with the latest skeleton deposed in an articulated position, and it has been very difficult to distinguish the sex and age of all of the skeletons (Honca &amp; Algaze 1998); 2. numerous types and categories of vessels were discovered among the funerary goods (jars, bowls, cups, bottles, miniatures and tripods of Plain Simple Ware, Karababa Painted Ware and Metallic Ware) that are typical of the middle 3rd millennium B.C.E. horizon of South-east Anatolia and Northern Syria, and which have several typological similarities to the cemetery of the nearby site of Lidar H?y?k (Marro &amp; Helwing 1995; Carter &amp; Parker 1995; Rova 2000) (Fig. 4); 3. several bronze pins and bronze bracelets, some of which have goat extremities, were found near the buried skeletons, proving that the dead were dressed before they were deposed inside the tomb (Laneri, in press); 4. other personal effects were found together with metal objects, such as necklaces with semiprecious stone beads (carnelian, agate and quartz), bone rings and earrings (Laneri, in press); [7] 15</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 4 - Pottery from the funerary assemblage of a mid 3rd millennium B.C.E. tomb from the Extramural Cemetery of Titris, H?y?k. (Photo by G. Algaze). 5. human and animal figurines fabricated from limestone and terracotta were situated in these funerary contexts, and in one case a naked human figurine, probably female, was placed inside a grinding basalt stone probably indicating a relationship between death and fertility (Laneri, in press). Other graves contemporaneous to the cemetery were found in the Outer Town directly underneath the later phase houses. Because of their similarities to the above mentioned extramural cemetery based on pottery typology we can hypothesize the existence of another extramural cemetery on the eastern section of the mid 3rd millennium B.C.E. town of Titrig H?y?k (Algaze et al. 1995). In two cases, B91.10 and B92.39 (2), the chamber tomb structure reflects the previously described large grave of the extramural cemetery, while anticipating the architectural features typical of the intramural tombs of the Late Early Bronze Age (Laneri, in press). These last graves display a possible secondary type of deposition with the skeleton fully unarticulated (for further physical anthropological analysis see Honga &amp; Algaze 1998). The funerary goods are also very similar to those found in the tombs of the other extramural cemetery, but with a higher percentage of open pottery forms, such as bowls, cups, miniatures, small jars, small bottles, 'Champagne cups' (Fig. 4), which are characteristic tall footed cups found in the funerary assemblage of the tombs of the first half of the 3rd millennium B.C.E. along the Syro-Anatolian Euphrates Valley (2) In the following text the capital letter B followed by a number, for example B91.10, will symbolize the number of the grave from the Titri? H?y?k Burial List. 16 [8]</page><page sequence="9">(Marro &amp; Helwing 1995; Carter &amp; Parker 1995; Sertok &amp; Ergeg 1999), 'Syrian bottles', and small four-lugged jars with lids (Algaze et al. 1995; Laneri 1999 and in press). The pottery is usually of the Plain Simple Ware type with some exceptions, such as the Karababa Painted Ware, TH 7591, which links the Titri? H?y?k pottery horizon to the North (Marro &amp; Helwing 1995; Rova 2000), and the Metallic Ware, which instead demonstrates a cultural connection to the South and West (Mazzoni 1982, 1991; Carter &amp; Parker 1995; Porter 1999). In one case bronze rings and semiprecious stone necklaces were found close to the skeletons along with a human figurine similar to those found in the other extramural tombs. A pottery cachet was discovered in the grave's dromos entrance of B92.39, providing a definite clue that a form of rituality was connected to the closure of the tomb (Algaze et al. 1995). Foundation Tombs With the expansion of the city in the LEBA Phase (c. 2350-2100 B.C.E.) a drastic transformation is witnessed both in terms of the site's urban planning and funerary customs (Matney &amp; Algaze 1995). During this period the archaeological team did not uncover any extramural tombs and the only recovered funerary remains are associated with intramural tombs or other tombs built underneath the houses, for a total of four cist graves and one jar burial, in this article considered to be foundation tombs (Laneri, in press) (3). The Titri? H?y?k private dwellings of the LEBA Phase, both in the Lower and Outer Town, are in fact built on top of these tombs (B95.59, B96.72, B96.73) and show pottery typologies similar to the material culture found inside the contexts of the houses and their intramural tombs (Matney, Algaze &amp; Pittman 1997). This is probably a clear indicator that these tombs were not just part of another later extramural cemetery, but are rather foundation tombs comparable to those associated with other archaeological contexts, such as the dwellings of the Agean area belonging to the Early Elladic II period (Forsen 1992; Branigan 1998). All of these graves have related architectonic structures, chambers, cists, and jars, and are distinguished by an increase, compared to previous periods, in the number of objects buried inside of the funerary chambers (Laneri, in press). In one case, B96.73, one of the capping slabs collapsed over the corpses, and as a result the burial chamber was filled with purposeful fill, full of trash and potsherds [...] at the time the house was constructed. (Matney, Algaze &amp; Pittman 1997: 67). The funerary goods are primarily pottery vessels of Plain Simple Ware, Late Karababa Ware, Incised Ware, and Metallic Ware, with a high percentage of open forms (cups, bowls, goblets, and miniatures) and other liquid containers (small jars, four-lugged (3) In a previous analysis these burials were considered part of a Late Early Bronze Age extramural cemetery (Matney, Algaze &amp; Pittman 1997: 67). The argument still needs a broader debate and further analyses to prove either hypothesis. [9] 17</page><page sequence="10">jars, bottles, and 'Syrian bottles') which together represent the typical Late 3rd millennium B.C.E. horizon of all Syro-anatolian regions (Mazzoni 1982, 1991; Marro &amp; Helwing 1995; Carter &amp; Parker 1995; Porter 1999). Also, jewelry has a high representation of metal rings (one in silver, B96.73), bracelets, earrings, and semi? precious stone necklaces. The large quantity of bronze pins indicate that the corpses were dressed before burial in the 'foundation graves'. In one case (B96.73) human remains were discovered deposited inside of a bowl, probably part of votive offering left at the entrance of the dromos to strengthen the ritual relationship between the tomb and the construction of the overlaying house (Matney, Algaze &amp; Pittman 1997; Laneri, in press). Intramural Tombs In the Ancient Near East and particularly Anatolia, the use of intramural tombs is a custom that dates as far back as the Neolithic Periods between the 7th and the 6th millennia B.C.E. ((^atal H?y?k, (^ay?n?, Tell Sabi Abyad, Jerf el Ahmar, Bouqras; Verhoeven 2000), with frequent practice also in the 5th Millennium B.C.E., such as at the Syrian settlement of Tell Arpachiyah (Campbell 1995), and the 4th Millennium B.C.E., in both Northern Mesopotamia, Tepe Gawra (Forest 1987), and North Eastern Anatolia (Korogutepe and Nor?untepe; van Loon 1978; Frangipane 1996). During the 6th and the 5th millennium B.C.E. skulls contain greater significance than other parts of the skeleton, and in fact have often been retrieved from burials located inside of domestic interiors (Campbell 1995; Verhoeven 2000). In contrast, throughout the Chalcolitic phase (4th millennium B.C.E.) there is an increase of child burials inside of dwellings and a total lack of information about extramural cemeteries, which again reappear at the beginning of the 3rd millennium B.C.E. (Forest 1987; Frangipane 1996). The change in funerary customs during the 3rd millennium B.C.E. is not only related to the distribution of space within the tombs and their relationship to the living community, but can also be noticed as developments in the structure of the grave itself, which is no longer based only on a pit or in a mudbrick structure, but develops into essentially a stone built tomb (cist, chamber, shaft, monumental structure). The funerary practices of the extramural cemetery and the intramural tomb coexisted during the 3rd millennium B.C.E., but they were never used simultaneously in the same site. The intramural tombs characterize the burial customs of the late 3rd millennium B.C.E. in Titri? H?y?k and in other Near Eastern sites (Laneri 1999), particularly with the contemporaneous phase of the Abu Salabikh settlement and other Southern Mesopotamian sites (Delougaz, Hill &amp; Lloyd 1967; Postgate 1980; Steele 1990), where both the intramural customs and the distribution of space within the private dwellings recall the southeastern Anatolian site here investigated (Fig. 3). In the specific case of Titri? H?y?k the structure of the grave with a rectangular stone wall chamber and a dromos as entrance, similar to those previously analyzed, is precisely planned with and incorporated into the layout 18 [10]</page><page sequence="11">Fig. 5 - Private dwellings of the late 3rd millennium B.C.E., showing three intramural tombs (A, B and C) in the Outer Town of Titri? H?y?k. (After Matney &amp; Algaze 1995: fig. 10). of the house (Fig. 5). During this specific archaeological phase the intramural tombs became the exclusive form so that the extramural cemetery was suddenly discontinued leading to its complete disappearance. In most instances there is one tomb for each dwelling, except for one house in the Outer Town where two intramural tombs were constructed (Laneri 1999). Each one of Titrig H?y?k intramural graves demonstrates a multiple deposition custom (Fig. 6) (4). The skeletons were buried inside the funerary chamber either in (4) Only B96.64 in the Lower Town presents one articulated skeleton, but also the structure of the grave is completely different from the others: the skeleton was laid on a bench and the structure of the tomb is made out of mudbricks used for the foundation along with limestones. [11] 19</page><page sequence="12">Fig. 6 - An intramural tomb of the late 3rd millennium B.C.E. in the Outer Town of Titri? H?y?k. View from the south. (After Algaze et al. 1996: fig. 3). an articulated, primary deposition, and/or in the manner of a dis? articulated secondary deposition. From the archaeological data it appears that the secondary de? position is commonly used in the Outer Town tombs, in which the remains of the buried are usually represented by skulls and a few other bones concentrated along the side of the chamber. Instead, the Lower Town tombs present the last buried skeleton in a perfectly articulated position, while the corpses of the earlier dead are scattered around the corner or to the side opposite to the funerary chamber entrance. Also in these cases the number of bones associated with each skull do not form a complete skeleton. This information provides an opportunity to formulate a funerary custom in which during the act of burying the last corpse inside the tomb, members of the living removed many bones belonging to earlier buried corpses in order to enlarge the space inside the chamber but always and purposely leaving their skulls inside the grave. The funerary goods are not very different from those of the earlier foundation tombs, and are mostly pottery vessels of Plain Simple Ware, Later Karababa Ware, Incised and Painted Ware, and some Metallic Ware (Mazzoni 1991; Algaze et al. 1995; Carter &amp; Parker 1995; Porter 1999) with a predominance of bowls and cups (Fig. 7) (6). In some occurrences unique objects, such as a handled pitcher (5) In one case (B96.75) dirt was removed from the floor of the tomb to provide space for a larger number of funerary assemblages and skulls (Laneri 1999 and in press). (6) In terms of pottery typology several vessel profiles recall types found along Syrian Euphrates sites but with a decoration typical of the South Eastern Anatolian region, for example the high footed goblet with a painted rim, further illustrating how Titri? H?y?k was in the center of a cultural and economic exchange area between Southern and Northern regions during the 3rd millennium B.C.E. 20 [12]</page><page sequence="13">^ ^^^^^ ^^ji Fig. 7 - Pottery from the funerary assemblage of a late 3rd millennium B.C.E. intramural tomb of the Outer Town in Titri?

The presence of a double handled depas amphikypellon in two of the funerary assemblages (Fig. 8), B95.60 and B96.64, assists with the process of understanding the economic and cultural contacts that interrelate the communities of Southeastern Anatolia and Northern Syria to Central Anatolian and Aegean groups, because, as will be explained in the following section (Act II), the depas, 'Syrian bottles', and four-lugged jar {zwilling?sen), play an important role in the performance of rituals during the 3rd millennium B.C.E. throughout a broad geographic area extending from the Aegean islands of Lemnos and Syros (Troy II period) to the Syrian Euphrates valley settlements of Tell Selenkahiye and Tell B'ia (van Loon 1968, 1973; ?zgu? 1985; ?zgu? &amp; Tenizer 1993; Spanos &amp; Strommenger 1993) (7). Another important object belonging to the intramural funerary assemblages is a double four-lugged jar separated by a pair of bulls positioned back-to-back (Fig. 9). This vessel is an unicuum in the pottery horizon of Titrig H?y?k and is not available outside funerary contexts. The two bulls (7) It is interesting to note that in Tell B'ia the depas was found in the main courtyard of the alteren palast, where the German archaeological team discovered a monumental intramural tomb, giving us more clues about the importance of this liquid container in the funerary rituals of this region (Strommenger 1994).

The reminder of objects from within the intramural tomb chambers include: bronze pins originally attached to the clothes worn by the buried corpses; bronze and silver earrings and rings, semiprecious stone necklaces which serve to distinguish the gender of the deceased; and individual bronze weapons such as a dagger (B96.75) and a large spear-point (B96.65), both placed underneath male skulls (Laneri 1999 and in press). Lead objects with a hook-shaped element on one end and measuring 7 cm in length were found inside of several funerary chambers (Fig. 10). These unusual objects were located in the fill of the funerary room and were presumably originally used to hang additional funerary goods from the walls or ceiling of the tomb. There are two examples of rooms containing both intramural tombs, B93.76 and B96.65, and infant burials, two associated with the former, B91.25 and B91.26, and three with the latter tomb, B96.66, B96.67, and B96.78. The infants were buried inside of cooking pots followed by deposition in the main floor, providing significant evidence in terms of the importance of rituality throughout the entire area around the intramural tomb. The 'Trinket' Mould The strong relationship between ritual practices and daily life activities in the private dwellings is not only understandable through this use of the inner architectural space, but also through some of the objects found in situ, such as a 'trinket' stone mould discovered in the main courtyard of one of the Lower Town houses (Matney, Algaze &amp; Pittman 1997: 68-69, figs. 19-20) (8). One half of this originally 2-part 'trinket' mould of 'a soft grayish stone, either chlorite/steatite or serpentine' {ibid:. 68), was found positioned on its side. The piece is (8) The 'trinket' stone mould was found on the surface of the courtyard, but the archaeologists were not able to understand if it was in situ or re-used to make the stone pavement of the courtyard (Guillerme Algaze personal communication). 22 [14]</page><page sequence="15">Fig. 9 - A four-lugged jar embellished with a double-headed bull from the funerary assemblage of a late 3rd millennium B.C.E. intramural tomb in the Lower Town of Titri?

Fig. 11 - The stone mould found on the floor of a private dwelling of the late 3rd millennium B.C.E. in the Lower Town of Titri? H?y?k. (After Matney, Algaze &amp; Pittman 1997: fig. 19). rectangular in shape, measures 7.8 x 7.3 x 1.0 cm, contains a total of eight figurative and geometric patterns tooled into its surface, and functioned in ancient times as a mould for casting metal objects (Fig. 11). Two holes located on opposite corners of the mould are indicative of its original 2-part construction. Other examples of so-called 'trinket' moulds exist, but are usually available from antiquarian contexts (Canby 1965). Thus, the Titri? H?y?k 'trinket' mould is a very good candidate for iconographic and symbolic analysis because of its exact archaeological context. The provenance of these moulds is from a large geographical area which extends from the site of Assur across to the regions of the Western Anatolia {ibid.). All of the moulds were primarily utilized to cast lead objects as evidenced by lead figurines found in other contemporaneous Near Eastern archaeological contexts, that are reminiscent of those carved in the Titri? H?y?k mould (Emre 1971; Matney, Algaze &amp; Pittman 1997). However, the only other mould with a context is from a house in Assur (level G), which dates to the so-called Early Dynastic HIB/Akkadian period (c. 2500-2300 B.C.E.) and is almost contemporaneous to the one found in the LEBA courtyard of the private dwelling of Titri? H?y?k (Canby 1965) (9). The exterior surface of the Titri? H?y?k mould is uncarved and striated, 'perhaps the result of the sharpening or cleaning of a blade' (Matney, Algaze &amp; Pittman 1997: 69). The interior surface instead contains eight evenly spaced figures carved into its surface, which can be distinguished clockwise from left to right, as follows (Fig. 12): 1. a pendant representing a pseudo-circular shaped structure with concentric horizontal grooves in its center; 2. a very poorly preserved star with a recessed dot between each point; 3. a pendant comprised of a circular, spiraled base from which protrudes a grooved long neck that ends in a point; (9) In terms of relative chronology Emre has pointed out that these 'trinket' moulds 'appear to have been contemporaneous with Troy Ilg in Western Anatolia, with the last phase of the EBIII in Central Anatolia and with the Akkadian and part of the Isin-Larsa periods in Mesopotamia' (Emre 1971: 130). 24 [16]</page><page sequence="17">Fig. 12 - Drawing of the inner surface of the stone mould of the late 3rd millennium B.C.E.

The female figurine (5), the two stamp seals (4 and 7) and the double bull headed pendant (6) are the forms with the highest percentage of occurrence from among the body of the other known 'trinket' moulds (Canby 1965). The nude female figurine in particular is incorporated into all of the moulds available from both archaeological and antiquarian contexts. More rare are the other three forms (1-3 and 8) included in the Titri? H?y?k mould. [17] 25</page><page sequence="18">An iconographic analysis of the eight objects represented in this late 3rd millennium B.C.E. mould provides the opportunity to investigate the stylistic and symbolic relationship between this site and other contemporaneous Near Eastern regions. The pendant with a pseudo-circular structure (1) is not archaeologically very well known. In other contemporaneous contexts objects have been found with a similar pseudo-circular/conical shape, but with an oblique and vertical rather than concentric positioning of the inner grooves. For example, one of such objects was found amongst the funerary goods located inside a pithos grave from Oylum H?y?k, a site chronologically contemporaneous to Titri? H?y?k and located about 150 km South-West of it. It is a gold diadem which clearly recalls the pseudo-circular pendant worked into the Titri? H?y?k mould (Ozgen 1993: fig. 4). Another gold pendant, with a decoration similar to the pendant incised into Titri? H?y?k 'trinket' mould, was discovered in a tomb of the Central Anatolian site of K?ltepe (level 13/Akkadian period; Ozg?c 1985: figs. 3-36), and in one of the tombs of the Royal Cemetery of Ur (Wooley 1934: pi. 219, U9365). The star with dots (2) is a very well known motif obtainable from both contemporaneous and later Ancient Near Eastern reliefs, sealings, and seals. It is usually considered to be a cosmological symbol of Inanna/Ishtar in her heavenly embodiment as goddess of the Evening and Morning Star, Venus (Wolkstein &amp; Kramer 1983). The third pendant (3) most likely depicts a pitcher or vessel, similar to the one visible in a mould discovered in an antiquarian market in Izmir (Canby 1965: fig. 1). Metal and ceramic pitchers with comparable shapes can be traced to numerous contemporaneous Central and Western Anatolian archaeological contexts such as Troy (II/III), Tarsus, Konya, Alaca H?y?k and K?ltepe (Emre 1971; Ozg?c 1985). Scholars have usually linked these vessels to ritual activities including funerary customs, but none of the archaeological examples are known to be from Southeastern Anatolian contexts; thus, it is probably important try to interpret the shape of the vessel incised on the Titri? H?y?k mould, because 'the negative is a somewhat distorted version of a real vessel' (Canby 1965: 47). The vessel represented in the mould has a profile that can be interpreted as either a globular pitcher with an anthropomorphic spout, such as the one (Th 11878) excavated from an intramural tomb of the Lower Town (B95.60); or, because of its globular body and the grooves around its neck, the well known 'Syrian bottle' (Algaze et al. 1995). From amongst 3rd millennium B.C.E. Central Anatolian settlements that manifest the presence of 'Syrian bottles' in their material culture there is one of particular interest, the so called 'Treasure of Eskiyapar', which belongs to the Eskiyapar site located 20 km Southeast of Alaca H?y?k (Ozg?c &amp; Tenizer 1993). Here 'Syrian bottles' were interspersed among other metal vessels and gold objects, and were buried in unison underneath the courtyard floor of one of the Eskiyapar houses {ibid). The geometric designs of the two stamp seals (4 and 7) are suggestive of themes dating back to the 4th millennium B.C.E. in this area as well as in other Northern Syrian and Central Anatolian regions (Canby 1965). 26 [18]</page><page sequence="19">The nude female figurine holding her breasts (5) has a well known repertoire, beginning with the famous representation of the so called 'Great Mother Goddess' of the Neolithic Period, and continuing throughout almost every site from Northern Mesopotamian to the Central Anatolian settlements ((Jatal H?y?k, Tell Sabi Abyad, etc.; Leeming 1994). During the 3rd millennium B.C.E. she appears in a different posture as is visible from this example and other similar moulds for casting metal objects and terracotta figurines (Canby 1965; Barrelet 1968). In some cases the arms extend down along either side of the body, as with the case of the painted plaster figure discovered by Andrae and his German expedition in the Ishtar temple (level H-Early Dynastic III, c. mid 3rd millennium B.C.E.; Canby 1965; Zettler et al. 1998: 110). In other examples the naked figurine is without a crown, such as in the case of the one from the Louvre (Canby 1965: fig. 1). Other figurines have been found in the later G level of the same Ishtar temple in Assur, as well as in Mari (Parrot 1956: pi. LXVI), situated in Northern Mesopotamia, and Central Anatolia (Canby 1965). One bronze nude female figurine holding a pitcher and with a shape similar to the one previously described, was part of the funerary goods of Tomb H in Alaga H?y?k (c. end of the 3rd millennium B.C.E.; ibid.: fig. 2). At the beginning of the 2nd millennium B.C.E. the number of these figurines in terracotta, hand or mould made, increased dramatically (Barrellet 1968). However, figurines from this period lack the crown thought by art historians of the Ancient Near East to suggest an iconographic distinction between the representation of goddesses and gods from humans or mythological characters (Black &amp; Green 2000: 120). The necklace and waist belt are typically ornamental. These two accessories presumably played an important role during the performance of ritual activities as evidenced by similar adornments found amongst the funerary goods of the tombs of the Royal Cemetery of Ur (c. 2600-2350 B.C.E.; Zettler et al. 1998: 94-110). Several limestone (female?) figurines were also retrieved from the funerary assemblages of Titri? H?y?k Mid Early Bronze Age extramural cemetery (c. 2500 B.C.E.), one of which, TH 7594 from B94.52, is embellished with neck rings visible as three grooves encircling the neck (Algaze et al. 1995: fig. 35). It is still very difficult to determine the role of these nude female figurines, but it is also likely that they were in some form related to ritual activities, specifically in burial customs and the worship of a female Goddess and/or religious priestess (10). The double bull-headed pendant (6), as with the figurine, embodies numerous important symbolic meanings. The overall shape of this pendant is similar to those considered by scholars as an idealized reproduction of a byre, a structure in which the holy cattle was housed, as illustrated in the Ancient Near Eastern iconographies (10) It is interesting to notice that the 'trinket' mould at the Louvre Museum (Canby 1965: fig. 2) depicts a naked female figurine along with a lion, which is another symbol of the Goddess Ishtar (Kramer 1972: 76-96). [19] 27</page><page sequence="20">since the end of the 4th and beginning of the 3rd millennium B.C.E. and as written in various Sumerian and Akkadian texts (for interpretation see Act II; Wolkstein &amp; Kramer 1983; Rice 1998; Black &amp; Green 2000). The bull heads that surmount the side poles of the 'holy cattle byre' are reminiscent of several symbolic representations of mythological figures, such as: the 'Great Bull' used to celebrate Enlil, the God of Air, and Enki, the God of Earth (Algaze et al.: 88); Gu-gul-ganna, the bull which is the husband of Ereshkigal, the Queen of the Underworld (Rice 1998: 88); the 'Bull of Heaven', known from the 'Epic of Gilgamesh', who is a mythical beast sent to Uruk by Anu, the God of Heaven, under the request of Inanna and killed by Gilgamesh and Enkidu (Heidel 1949; Rice 1998: 95-104) (n); the bull-man, a creature with a bull's head and a human body, who is considered to be 'one of the guardians against evil' (Rice 1998: 104) in the Ancient Near Eastern tradition and later became a fundamental character in the myths of nearby regions, such as the Minotaur, a legendary Cretian figure known from post-Mycenaean Greek mythology (mid 2nd millennium B.C.E.; ibid:. 208-12); the 2nd millennium B.C.E symbolic association with the storm god, Adad (Ishkur) (Black and Green 2000); or, finally, Dumuzi, who is addressed with the epithet 'wild bull' by Inanna in the 'Courtship of Inanna and Dumuzi' (Wolkstein &amp; Kramer 1983: 55; Rice 1998: 92). Other artifacts which contain the double bull head motif were encountered in several archaeological contexts including the house of the level G of Assur, where a bronze double bull head associated with the 'trinket' mould was excavated (Early Dynastic IIIB/Akkadian Period, c. 2500-2300 B.C.E.; Canby 1965; Emre 1971), and the E level of Mari's Temple of Ishtar (mid 3rd millennium B.C.E.; Parrot 1965: pi. LVIII) (12). Similar objects were interspersed among the funerary goods of several tombs in the cemeteries of Kish of Tell Brak, of Tell Asmar, and in the Royal Cemetery of Ur (Rice 1998: 85-108; Zettler et al. 1998: 52-53). Even one of Titrig H?y?k LEBA (c. 2300-2150 B.C.E.) funerary assemblages, as already presented in the previous paragraph, contained a double four-lugged jar separated by a pair of bulls positioned back-to-back (Laneri 1999) (Fig. 9). The combined funerary context of the four-lugged jar and the 'trinket' mould's pendant present the opportunity to evaluate the symbolic connotations of the double bull within the performance of the funerary rituals. The final object of the mould (8) is another pendant with a very simplistic bird shape, 'probably a waterfowl' (Matney, Algaze &amp; Pittman 1997: 69). Several other bird (u) In the 'Epic of Gilgamesh' Tnanna threatens to open the graves and bring back the dead from the Underworld [...] unless Anu sends down the Bull of Heaven to destroy the pair' (Rice 1998: 99), after Gilgamesh's violent rejection to her marriage proposal. (12) The temple of Ishtar in Mari has a connection with at least one large chamber tomb (T 300), while an additional two tombs were discovered in the same area built underneath the temple walls (Jean-Marie 1990). 28 [20]</page><page sequence="21">figurines have been found in contexts associated with ritual activity in a broad area extending from Southern Meso? potamia to Central Anatolian (Pinnock 2000) , such as in several tomb funerary assemblages of the Royal Cemetery of Ur (Zettler et al. 1998: 20-45), as well as the tombs of Alaga H?y?k, Horoztepe, Gre Virike, and Tell Selenkahiye (Canby 1965; van Loon 1968, 1973; Emre 1971; ?kse 2001) . Bones of birds, usually doves (13), are frequently found deposited inside of tombs or buried inside the entrance dromos of 3rd millennium B.C.E. sites along the Syrian Euphrates, such as Tell Fig. 13 - A plaster basin from a private dwelling of the late 3rd millennium B.C.E. in the Lower Town of Titri? H?y?k. (Photo by G. Algaze). Selenkahiye, Tell Sweyhat, and Jerablus Tahtani (van Loon 1968,1973; Peltenburg et al. 1995; Zettler et al. 1996), indicating the sacrificial importance of birds in rituals associated with burial customs during this specific period. The Burial Plaster Basin During Titri? H?y?k 1998 excavation campaign, an area in the Outer Town was excavated close to the main city wall of the LEBA. After two weeks of excavation three skulls were uncovered from the inside of a private dwelling of the latest construction phase (c. 2150 B.C.E.). In the following week of digging it was possible to clarify those first finds. The first group of three skulls was part of a major ritual deposition composed of a total of 17 skulls placed around the perimeter of a plaster basin located in the corner of this house (Fig. 13). The central part of the basin was instead covered by an irregular mass of mostly long bones, measuring about 60 cm in height. At this archaeological phase the room containing the plaster basin was separate from the rest of the building and linked to the main street running between the casemate built around the city wall and the other Outer Town dwellings. A total of six other plaster basin features were also uncovered in Titri? H?y?k (Fig. 14) from other contemporaneous contexts inside private dwellings of both the Outer and Lower Town (Algaze et al. 1995). Each basin is circular in shape with a diameter of about 1.40 m, is built on the top of the preparation floor of the main (13) A ritualistic relationship between the use of cloves' figurines and the cult of Ishtar is recognizable during the first half of the 2nd millennium B.C.E. in a few archaeological contexts at Ebla, Syria (Pinnock 2000).

After chemical analyses of organic residues deposited on the top surfaces of a few of these basins (Nesbitt &amp; Samuel 1996), it was possible to link their primary function to the processing of grapes, 'possibly in connection with wine production' (Matney &amp; Algaze 1995: 41) (14). These features were also connected to ritual practices, such as funerary rites, an assumption supported by the unusual skulls and human bones burial previously described, as well as the fact that almost every dwelling from this late 3rd millennium B.C.E. phase contains a plaster basin built in the working area along with an intramural tomb. Further evidence in support of this association is the discovery of a plaster basin in one of the Outer Town dwellings intentionally deposited on top of the entrance to the intramural tomb in order to seal the dromos (Laneri, in press). Graves from an Abandoned Site Sometime between the end of the 3rd and the beginning of 2nd millennium B.C.E. most of the Titrig H?y?k settlement was abandoned. After this event the large private dwellings of the LEBA Phase were reused for the disposal of trash, as exemplified by the archaeological presence of large pits filled with debris, as well as for the continual burial of the dead. These later graves are very simple in terms of both the structural containers (pits, cists and/or pithoi) and the objects contained (Laneri, in press). Although the poor preservation of these depositions due to modern plowing impedes a clear archaeological analysis, the following generalizations can be made. The graves usually contain a single articulated skeleton, flexed on its left side and positioned with a E-W or S-N orientation. The assemblage is also simple, containing one Plain Simple Ware cup or bowl, and some pins adorning the corpse. In one case (B91.24) an adult corpse was buried inside of a pithos along with four bronze rings and one large bronze pin (Laneri, in press). Although these tombs are very scattered, they continue to be located in the vicinity of earlier intramural tombs, probably as a way of maintaining the memory of past ancestors. (14) These analyses identified traces of tartaric acid salts, derived from red wine's pigmented tannins, and sometimes carbonized fragments and peduncles of domesticated grape {Vitts viniferd) were recovered on the floors of rooms directly connected to plaster basins (Nesbitt &amp; Samuel 1996; Algaze et al. 1995: 30; Schlee personal communication). 30 [22]</page><page sequence="23">Fig. 14 - The plaster basin covered with human bones from a private dwelling of the late 3rd millen? nium B.C.E. in the Outer Town of Titri? H?y?k. (Photo by T. Matney). Act II Interpretation Wine... The grape was one of the most important and valuable agricultural products of South-East Anatolia during the late 3rd millennium B.C.E., and even more strongly in the 2nd millennium B.C.E. (Hoffner 1974; Milano 1994; Zettler &amp; Miller 1996). Vineyards occupied land extending throughout the region south of the Taurus Mountains. Only a few select people had the privilege of touching, and more importantly, harvesting this crop. As such a highly, even overly, regarded product, its devastation was considered to be one of the worst human acts against nature and subsequently the gods (Powell 1996). The grape fundamental to Anatolian cultural, social, and religious life at least in part because the 'Festival of the New Year' was in fact organized during the month of cropping the vineyards, in October (Hoffner 1974: 39-41). By squeezing and processing this fruit, it was possible to create a powerful beverage, the geshtin or wine in Sumerian, the beverage that 'gives the life' Xbullutum) (Milano 1994). [23]</page><page sequence="24">This information is available from both paleobotanical and textual data. Several cuneiform tablets from the Archives of the Palace G in Ebla, Syria (mid 3rd millennium B.C.E.), as well as other 2nd millennium B.C.E. texts from nearby regions such as Mari and other Hittite and Mitanni settlements, document the overwhelming importance of the production and consumption of this alcoholic beverage, as well as grape cultivation, throughout Syro-anatolian regions (Zettler &amp; Miller 1996). In Mari, for example, wine was stored in large quantities in the palatial cellars of Zimri-lim (Milano 1994), a complex of 'storerooms opened off a corridor in the south-central part of the palace' (Zettler &amp; Miller 1996: 127). Another Hittite text describes that a special permit was required to cut off a branch of a grapevine; a person breaking this stricture received a corporeal punishment (Hoffner 1974: 40-41). The wine produced in these regions had a crucial impact on both economic and cultural aspects of the communities of South-East Anatolia as well as of those of other Near Eastern and Mediterranean regions. From Southeastern Anatolia, it was exported as 'a very expensive beverage' to the nearby regions throughout the Euphrates river, and rarely to some Mesopotamian cities, such as Sippar, between the end of the 3rd millennium and the beginning of the 2nd millennium B.C.E., where this precious liquid was used probably by Amorites elite during the performance of particular ceremonies (Powell 1996). As a rare commodity, wine was subsequently more valued that other alcoholic liquids such as beer, which were mostly consumed during daily life occasions (Milano 1994). The distribution and consumption of wine and beer geographically divides Ancient Near East communities of the 3rd and 2nd millenium B.C.E., while also differentiating them from an economic, religious, and cultural standpoint (Zettler &amp; Miller 1996). Beer was primarily produced in Mesopotamia, and barley, its principal ingredient, was harvested in Spring corresponding to the ancient Mesopotamian tradition of the New Year Festival (akitu) (Milano 1994; Bell 1997: 17-20). Wine was instead processed in the Northern regions of Khabur, piedmont Taurus, and the Syro Anatolian Euphrates, as well as along the coastal areas of Syro-Palestinian (Powell 1996). Here the grape was harvested in the Fall, six months later than the barley harvest, which during the 2nd millennium B.C.E. corresponded to the Hittite New Year Festival (Hoffner 1974: 39). These two alcoholic beverages are linked not only by the process of fermentation, but also by their clear symbolic religious associations to the chthonic deities, Geshtinanna, the 'rootstock of the grapevine' (15), and Dumuzi in his aspect of Dumu who holds 'the power in growing the grain'. Geshtinanna and Dumuzi, brother and sister in the Sumerian Pantheon, are also the (13) During the 18th century B.C.E. the city of Karana'a (Tell al Rimah, a Northern Mesopotamian site laying between the Tigris and Euphrates) was one of the most important center for producing wine, as shown by several contemporaneous texts. Karanu in Akkadian means 'wine' and several scholars have linked the ancient city of Karana'a with Geshtinanna, 'in other words Wine-Land and Wine Goddess' (Powell 1996: 115) 32 [24]</page><page sequence="25">two mythological figures who substitute Inanna/Ishtar in the Nether World for a period of six months each, providing us another link between daily life activities and the construction of broader religious beliefs within the ancient communities of the Near Eastern regions (Jacobsen 1976: 62-63; Wolkstein &amp; Kramer 1983: 168). Wine and beer were widespread throughout the Near East during the 3rd millennium B.C.E. in connection to funerary and other religious rituals (Joffee 1998). It is clear from contemporaneous reliefs, seals, and texts reconstructed from the Urukagina period (first half of the 3rd millennium B.C.E.; Lutz 1922: 121-25; Liverani 1988) that during these occasions the alcoholic beverages were served in diverse types of open and closed containers (Pinnock 1994), one of which recalls the so called 'Champagne Cup' excavated from several 3rd millennium B.C.E. extramural tombs from Syro-anatolian settlements (see Act I; Carter &amp; Parker 1995) (Fig. 4). A high percentage of ceramic vessels functioning as liquid containers, such as bottles, pitchers, goblets, and cups, have been also found amongst the funerary goods of Titri? H?y?k LEBA intramural tombs (see Act I; Laneri 1999 and in press). From amongst those there is an even higher number of vessel types with clear symbolic meanings as they have rarely or never been found in urban contexts, such as the depas, a pitcher with an animal spout, and high footed painted goblets. Both wine and beer are likely to have had a great importance in both the productive and ritual activities of Titri? H?y?k, an assumption supported by paleobotanical data which characterizes the majority of the site as 'hulled barley (Hordeum sativumY (Algaze et al. 1995: 29). The predominance of barley used 'as fodder for animals', as Duncan Schlee has pointed out {ibid.: 31) in Titrig H?y?k agriculture production also provides a bridge between pastoral economies and the world of the sedentary in which the same grains are used for processing beer. Information about the function of ceramic vessels in relation to paleobotanical data provides a useful starting point for the interpretation of the pendant (3) of the 'trinket' mould (see Act I), determined to be a representation of a pitcher or a bottle, as a possible symbolic liquid container (Canby 1965; Emre 1971; Matney, Algaze &amp; Pittman 1997). Archaeological records support the importance of symbolic vessels such as the 'Syrian bottles', imported by 'Western' communities from 'Eastern' cultures and incorporated into ritual contexts of Central Anatolian tombs and 'treasures'. An opposite W-E exchange is also evidenced by the depas found in the Syro-anatolian tombs (Ozg?g 1985; Ozg?g &amp; Tenizer 1993; Spanos &amp; Strommenger 1993). These vessels must be visualized as more than just exotic exchange products, but also as important symbols of the relationship between the product contained in them and the rituals involved in their use. In the case of Titri? H?y?k these symbolic 'tools' should begin to be connected with ritual activities, such as the example of wine production and the creation of an ideology related to a belief in the afterlife. The symbolic and cultural value of wine in the Ancient Near East was in fact related to its color, and more importantly, to the process involved in its production. A distinctly reddish colored liquid, wine can easily be associated with blood, as [25] 33</page><page sequence="26">written in texts from later periods such as the 2nd millennium B.C.E. cuneiform tablets from Ugarit, or the Bible (Milano 1994; Michalowsky 1994; Sassen 1994; Joffee 1998). In ancient times the process of making wine, which includes the harvesting, picking, treading, and fermentation of the grapes, and finally the cooking of the liquid, had an extraordinary metaphorical meaning that is analogous to the course of human life - birth, life, death - (McGovern 1998; De Martino 2000). Wine also embodies other important factors, such as, for instance, the relationship between its use, the concept of re-birth and the liberation of human sexual instincts (Douglas 1987). During the ancient Roman times the god Liber was the divinity of both wine and semen, and the use of wine was prohibited by women because of its incredible sexual power (Bettini 1995). The relationship between sex and wine is evident during the performance of other important rituals, such as the so-called Sumerian 'Sacred marriage' (Jacobsen 1976: 42-47; Reade 1995). In this case the metaphorical value of wine, seen as a sexual stimulus, is positively explained by the Shu-Sin's hymn dated to the III Dynasty of Ur (c. 2100 B.C.E.), in which wine is constantly associated with Inanna's vulva during the performance of Shu-Sin's 'Sacred Marriage' (Kramer 1969: 94). and Death The 3rd millennium B.C.E. in the Ancient Near East is also a period of drastic transformation in terms of funerary customs, resulting in an increase in the quality and quantity of archaeological data (16) as compared to the prior lack of information coming from the known contexts of the 4th millennium B.C.E., and even to the little information available from the previous millennia (Laneri 1999 and in press). This body of archaeological evidence facilitates the visualization of more complex social, economic, and cultural structures in the process of their interpretation in the present. This does not necessarily mean that earlier or later funerary rituals were less elaborate, but only that they were different and less visible. During this phase (3rd millennium B.C.E.), as pointed out in the previous section (see Act I), the 'world of dead' shifted to the center of the cultural and socio-political organization of the 'world of living' communities, spanning a very broad geographical area bordered by the Transcaucasian region in the East (Biscione &amp; Bondioli 1989) and the Mediterranean basin in the West, both physical frontiers within this cultural scenario (Branigan 1998). The various types of graves (cist, chamber, shaft tomb, pit, pithos, dolmen, cinerary urns; Carter &amp; Parker 1995), the introduction of limestone vs. the previous predominance of mudbrick in the construction of the tombs (Giulio (16) For 'quality' of data I intend the possibility of better decipher and interpret throughout the discover of a large 'quantity' of burial data and related information (texts, material culture, architectural structures, and so on), the inner ideological constituency of ancient funerary rituals and their impact in the social organization of the living communities. 34 [26]</page><page sequence="27">Palumbi personal communication), and the diversity in the placement of graves and the enactment of ancient funerary rituals (extramural cemetery, intramural tomb, monumental mausoleums, large cemetery without no direct link to settlements along the Euphrates, graves inside houses of settlement in state of abandon), signify fundamental ideological markers which clearly distinguish cultural traditions and geographic distribution within the 3rd millennium B.C.E. (Fig. 3). This archaeological information combined with the diverse treatment of the corpse (articulated, secondary deposition, skulls, flexed position of the corpse, purification of the corpse and of bones, sacrifices, cremation) provides physical evidence and subsequent insights into upcoming transformations such as belief in the afterlife, variety in the ideological structure of religious systems, diversity in the manipulation of the role of the ancestors, strengthening of kinship within living communities, and entrenchment of social memory (Jonker 1995). Each of these cultural structures is used by the living in the attempt to defeat the natural event of death and to reunify the group without losing the power of the social organization (Hertz 1928; Parker Pearson 1999: 193-97). The symbolic use of wine in association with funerary rituals becomes clearly visible in Titri? H?y?k during the late 3rd millennium B.C.E. with the discovery of the funerary deposition of seventeen skulls and other human bones covering an entire plaster basin (B98.87), presumed to have been used for the processing of grapes (Laneri, in press) (Fig. 14). Thus, the basin probably functioned as a part of the daily life activities of this period's ancient communities for the preparation of the precious alcoholic liquid {geshtin). The same structure acted as a surface on which to purify the corpse prior to the act of burial in the final grave (intramural tomb, extramural cemetery or the river). A similar ritual is visible within modern communities of South East Asia (Huntington &amp; Metcalf 1991). Among these societies, large ceramic storage jars normally used for processing rice wine, also serve as temporary housing for the disarticulated bones of the dead prior to final burial in a tomb. The process of making wine becomes a metaphor for the rite de passage and especially for the treatment of the corpse which involves 'the three stages of preparation, decomposition, and extraction' {ibid.: 73). As we have seen before, the wine is also incorporated into other rituals, such as rites of purification and re-birth, so that its ideological role cements agricultural based societies to the social and economic roots of the elite powers, such as religion and the construction of foundation myths. The Descent oflnanna to the Nether World As illustrated by Shu-Sin's lyric (Kramer 1969: 94), wine, blood, fertility and re? birth are often interrelated in mythological stories and funerary rituals, with an emphasis placed on the sexuality of the goddesses, gods, and mythological figures who are also deeply rooted to an idealized metaphorical representation of the [27] 35</page><page sequence="28">relationship between life and death. Such is the case with The Descent of Inanna to the Nether World', a Sumerian text that dates from the Sumerian version of the Old Babylonian Period (c. 1750 B.C.E.), to the Neo-Assyrian one which is an Akkadian translation (Kramer 1972). The majority of the tablets from which philologists have been able to reconstruct the story in its integrity, were stored in the scribes' houses of Nippur or originate from other fragments found at Ur (Wolkstein &amp; Kramer 1983). Nippur (17) is considered to be one of the most important and traditional religious centers of the Mesopotamian region during the 3rd and the 2nd millennium B.C.E., and along with Uruk, 'the city of Inanna' (Zettler 1992), is one of the seven cities where this Goddess of Love, Heaven, and War was worshipped both as Morning and Evening star and as Holy wife of Dumuzi, the mythological Sumerian king of Uruk. Although the cuneiform tablets which compose the text of 'the Descent of Inanna' belong to phases chronologically known to be at least about three centuries later then the funerary assemblages of Titri? H?y?k and geographical areas further south of southeastern Anatolias regions, the presence of a nude female figurine similar to Inanna/Ishtar iconographies, combined with a star, which symbolically represents Inanna/Ishtar as the star of the Heaven, in the Titri? H?y?k 'trinket' mould found in a context of a private dwelling are all important steps in the direction of a careful and exhaustive comparative analysis between the later 3rd millennium B.C.E. funerary contexts in Titri? H?y?k and that famous 2nd millennium B.C.E. text (18). Comparative analysis is a precious tool in the process of interpreting and understanding aspects of the socio-cultural background that produces, for example, the above mentioned funerary customs of Titri? H?y?k, even in case such as this that draws from different chronological phases. The plot of 'the Descent of Inanna' is very simple: Inanna decides to move from 'the Great Above' where she has sovereign power, to 'the Great Below', where Ereshkigal, Inanna's sister, is in charge (19). Following the demand of Ereshkigal that (17) During the 70s, the Oriental Institute Archaeological project in Nippur uncovered the layers of the Inanna temple ranging from the 3rd to 1st millennium B.C.E. It is interesting to note that most of the texts found within rooms, belonging to the layers of the Ur III dynasty (last quarter of the 3rd millennium B.C.E.) are about administrative topics, without any mention of the mythological stories related to the Goddess of Love (Zettler 1992). This dyscrasia between the location of the literary texts and that of the cult suggest that archaeologists, as well as the historian and the philologists, should in future studies reanalyze the relationship between texts and their contexts. (18) It is also important to note that these kind of moulds were in use throughout a broad chronological period beginning with the late part of the 3rd millennium B.C.E. and corresponding to the maximum expansion of Titri? H?y?k, and ending at the Old Babylonian period (c. 1750 B.C.E.), the archaeological phase of The Descent of Inanna/Ishtar to the Nether world' (Canby 1965; Emre 1971; Matney, Algaze &amp; Pittman 1997). (19) The reason that moves Inanna to the Nether World is still unclear. 'Perhaps in order to free her lover Dumuzi' (Kramer 1972: 86). But if so why at the end of the myth does she decide to condemn Dumuzi to death? 36 [28]</page><page sequence="29">is delivered by the guardian Neti to all of the dead entering the Nether World, Inanna must pass through seven doors in order to enter the Underworld. During this journey Inanna sheds herself of her royal garments that symbolize the seven me (the shugurra, the crown of the steppe; a small beaded lapis necklace; a double breasted strand of beads; a breastplate; a gold wrist band; the lapis measuring rod and line; and, finally, the royal robe) (20), one for each door. As Inanna enters Ereshkigal's throne room, 'naked and bowed low' (Wolkstein &amp; Kramer 1983: 60), she is 'turned into a corpse, a piece of rotting meat, and [is] hung from a hook on the wall' by her sister, the Queen of the 'Great Below' (ibid.: 60). After the passing of three days with any words from the goddess, Inanna's servant, Ninshubur, '[sets] up a lament for her by the ruins' (ibid.: 61). When this does not successfully return the goddess, Nishubur turns to Inanna's grandfather, Enlil, the Air god, and her father, Nanna, the Moon god, for help in bringing Inanna back up to 'the Great Above'. The pleas are not answered and they each reply to Ninshubur with anger: 'She [Inanna] who goes to the Dark City stays there' (ibid.: 61-62). Ninshubur thus cries for the help of the maternal grandfather, Enki, the god of Water and Wisdom, who instead decides to help Inanna by sending to the Underworld the unsexed characters, kurgarra and galatur, created from dirt only for this occasion. He gave the food of life to the kurgarra. He gave the water of life to the galatur. (Ibid.: 64). They entered the Underworld 'like flies' through a crack in the ground and after facing the naked Ereshkigal, Queen of the Underworld, and refusing her gifts of water and grain, they retrieve Inanna's corpse (ibid.: 64). The kurgarra sprinkled the food of life on the corpse. The galatur sprinkled the water of life on the corpse. Inanna arose. (Ibid.: 67). But Ananna, the judge of the Underworld, blocks them on their ascent to the Great Above by sending the gutta demons who stop Inanna and demand her to give them a substitute for herself in the Underworld. Inanna refuses to send down her sukkal Ninshubur, as well as her sons, Shara and Lulal. Finally, she decides to sacrifice her human husband, Dumuzi, the shepherd king of Uruk (21), who in response desperately seeks help from the Sun god, Utu, Inanna's brother and the divinity who originally introduced and supported Dumuzi to his promised wife, Inanna. Take him! Take Dumuzi away! (Ibid.: 71). (20) The me represent various divine powers and can be symbolized by different objects. (21) Dumuzi is mentioned as one of the first Sumerian kings of Uruk after Lugalbanda and before Gilgamesh. His kingdom spanned about 100 years. Dumuzi is probably a real historical figure, but his presence in mythological texts completely erases any importance of his historical position. The myth is never history, it is an ideological structure upon which communities, and especially the elite, build their own social organizations and memories through precise beliefs. [29] 37</page><page sequence="30">The second part of the story was found in an archaeological context different than the first, and is centered around Dumuzi's dream of his own death, which causes him to exclaim: the bottom of my churn drops away/ my drinking cup falls from his peg/ my shepherd's crook has disappeared. {Ibid.: 15). The main characters of this second part are Dumuzi and his sister, Geshtinanna, the Queen of the vineyards and wine. Her role is that of Dumuzi's alter ego, for she responds to his worries about his death dream by hiding him from the galla demons who wish to take him to the Underworld. His sister resists the demons' torture and does not reveal his hide-out, but one of Dumuzi's friends brings the galla straight to him in Aralli (Jacobsen 1976: 48-49). Upon his discovery the galla capture him, but the god Utu helps him to escape. Dumuzi goes first to Kubiresh and then to the old woman, Bilili, who gives him food and drink. But the demons follow Geshtinanna to Dumuzi's sheepfold. Here the seven galla climb 'the reed fence', seize him, and throw 'the drinking cup down from its peg'. The churn was silent. No milk was poured/ The cup was shattered. Dumuzi was no more/ The sheepfold was given to the winds. (Wolkstein &amp; Kramer 1983: 84). The third section opens with a lament in which all of Uruk citizens mourn for his premature loss. Even Inanna, who has sent Dumuzi to the Underworld, cries for her deceased husband: 'Where is my husband? [...] I can no longer bring him food [...] I can no longer serve him drink' {ibid.: 87). Dumuzi's mother, Sirtur, and sister, Geshtinanna, weep along with her for their desolation. 'There is a mourning in the house, there is a grief in the inner chamber' {ibid.: 87). And finally, a fly appears in front of Inanna and Geshtinanna and shows them the way to Dumuzi in the steppe, only after Inanna bribes it with many promises (22). At this point Inanna decides to let Dumuzi and his sister, Geshtinanna, share the residence in the Underworld, so that each stays there for half a year at a time on a rotating basis. The Myth and Archaeological Evidence of a Funerary Ritual One of the most valuable elements within 'The Descent of Inanna into the Nether World' is the importance of the familial organization and the manner in which each individual respects her or his duty in the consolidation of this primeval social structure. Furthermore, each character plays a fundamental symbolic role in the ideological construction of the identity of the myth, in the performance of the ritual, and in the establishment of the fictional memory of the living communities (22) Inanna said: 'If you tell me, I will let you frequent the beer-houses and taverns. I will let you dwell among the talk of the wise ones. I will let you dwell among the songs of the minstrels' (Wolkstein &amp; Kramer 1983: 88). 38 [30]</page><page sequence="31">associated with the beliefs described in the mythological story. Thus, bearing in mind the fictional and the ideological aspects of this myth, it is important to try to attempt an association between the functional and ideological aspects played by each character and the archaeological remains related to the performance of funerary rituals in the Ancient Near Eastern (Postgate 1992: 82-108), as for example in the case of the settlement of Titri? H?y?k. Perhaps the strongest and most obvious message to emerge from the Inanna myth is that of the diametrically opposed intercourse between the pairs of siblings: the sisters, the goddesses Inanna/Ishtar and Ereshkigal; and the brother and sister, Dumuzi and Geshtinanna. Inanna is a cosmological deity 'who adorns [herself] with the agate necklace of fertility' (Wolkstein &amp; Kramer 1983: 88). She represents life, fertility, and birth and has her alter ego in Ereshkigal, a chthonic divinity and 'Queen of the Underworld', who is instead responsible for controlling the death of human beings, the destruction of their bodies, and the end of their lives. Dumuzi and Geshtinanna have speculative and opposite roles in the productive organization of human life, a theme previously highlighted through the analysis of the geographic, economic, cultural, and religious differences associated with the use of beer (Dumuzi) and wine (Geshtinanna) in the Ancient Near Eastern tradition. Dumuzi is the shepherd, the nomad, the producer of milk and other dairy products, a 'wild bull' (23) who finally settled by marrying Inanna, 'plowing her vulva', while still maintaining a strong relationship with the pastoral world. Geshtinanna in contrast is characterized as the 'the lady of the open countryside', the goddess of wine, a rural deity associated with farming (Jacobsen 1976: 62). These four figures, who are also interrelated in several other mythological texts, perfectly embody the different elements that form the productive and natural course of life amongst the communities of the Ancient Near East, where pastoral and agricultural economies are the basis of socio-political organization (Porter, in press). The complete or partial nudity of the two female goddesses is another repeated feature within the written myth of Inanna descending to the Nether World. The nudity of death is powerful enough to destroy anything, even the sexual attributes of the galla demons who are in control of the 'world of the dead' (23) In this study I will consider the symbolic intercourse between Dumuzi and the bull, both in the literature and the iconographic representations, more as related to his sexual power, which is strongly emphasized in the so called 'Courtship of Inanna and Dumuzi' text: 'Great Lady [Inanna], the king will plow your vulva/ I, Dumuzi the King, will plow your vulva [...] At the king's lap stood the rising cedar' (Wolkstein &amp; Kramer 1983: 37). In several contexts, ancient and contemporaneous, 'being a bull' is often synonymous within male virility. In the case of Dumuzi this sexual attribute is probably strengthened by the idea of controlling and expanding the cattle, which is a typical role of the bull and a basic concept for a settled shepherd, such as Dumuzi, who also wants to acquire the role of farmer... plowing Inanna's vulva. [31] 39</page><page sequence="32">(the 'ground', kur in Sumerian; Black &amp; Green 2000: 180) (24). The same nudity is clearly visible in the crowned naked figurine depicted in the Titri? H?y?k 'trinket' mould (late 3rd millennium B.C.E.) and in the other stone figurines found inside of the mid 3rd millennium B.C.E. extramural cemetery tombs of the same settlement. In examples of Titrig H?y?k moulds and figurines the only accessories adorning the nude bodies are a necklace (the 'agate necklace'?) (25) and a waist belt. The mould figurine's body is otherwise fully visible with an emphasis placed on her sexual organs with her hands holding her breasts and a wide triangle outlining her pubic region. If the mythological text of 'The Descent of Inanna into the Nether World' is analyzed in detail to search for symbolic meanings that correlate to the process of dying, it is possible to recognize that the nudity of the two women is truly a symbolic representation of the nudity of death, rather than a naturalistic representation of one of the mythological figures (Inanna and/or Ereshkigal). In the Nether World they both lose their original human identity. They are the alter egos of each other for the way in which Ereshkigal destroys human values, while Inanna reconstructs them. While in the Nether World, Ereshkigal obliterates all of the values embodied by Inanna, whereas in the world of the living Inanna's feminine attributes, the figurines, the beads, etc., serve to reinforce her human representations of war, sex and birth. Inanna-Ereshkigal is a unique figure, able to idealize established standards of human behavior that distinguish the world of humanity (rational) from the world of 'bestiality' (irrational) (26). The violence of both the sexual act and the moment of human (24) The creatures kurgarra and galatur sent by Enki to the Nether World to save Inanna, do not have sexual attributes: 'neither male nor female' (Wolkstein &amp; Kramer 1983: 64). Inanna instead incorporates in her personality both masculine and feminine traits, which sometimes appear as strongly opposing attributes. She is in fact traditionally considered by Ancient Near Eastern scholars to be an androgynous or hermaphrodite figure, and her realm of cult includes heterosexuality, bi-sexuality, homosexuality, and transvestism (Bahrani 2000), but I will concentrate more on the different sexual aspects of Inanna/Ishtar's personality and her relationship with the Nether World in future researches. (25) Beads have a fundamental symbolic values, such as: the connection between the role of Inanna in Ancient Near Eastern mythological accounts (she adorned herself 'with the agate necklace of fertility' [Wolkstein &amp; Kramer 1983: 33]; 'she arranged her precious lapis beads around her neck' [ibid/. 38]); her sexual representation (in a Ur III Dynasty, c. 2100 B.C.E., version of the famous text of 'The sacred marriage between Dumuzi and Inanna' the bead symbolize Ishtar's vulva and in one case the 'lapis vulva' is put in relation with the 'golden star', Inanna/Ishtar's symbol; Lambert 1987); and their symbolic use in the funerary contexts (thousand of beads, of gold and other semi-precious materials, have been found both in the intramural tomb 7 and the 'White Monuments A' buried with and without human corpses; Porter, in press). Beads also served a symbolic function within the funerary assemblages of the tombs of the Royal Cemetery of Ur (c. 2600-2350 B.C.E.), where they 'were found only generally associated with bodies' (Pittman in Zettler et al. 1998: 110). (26) The mythological character of Enkidu, known from 'The Epic of Gilgamesh', is the the perfect example for demonstrating the role of sexuality in defining the frontier between bestiality and humanity in the Ancient Near East tradition. In fact in this case Enkidu is able to lose his original wild behavior and animal traits thanks to the leisure period spent with the harlot (Wolkstein &amp; Kramer 1983). 40 [32]</page><page sequence="33">death have to be re-organized through the creation of rules, which as Bataille (1962: 49-62) has correctly pointed out, are used to balance out the order between discontinuity (life) and continuity (death). The ideological control over the universe of sex and death through the use of taboos is a primary reason for a certain group, like the elite, to establish the concept of power over the rest of population (Shanks &amp; Tilley 1982). In the case of Inanna and Ereshkigal, their nudity in the Nether World can be interpreted as a loss of all power, which is erased from everyone, including the divinities, when entering the world of dead. This symbolic nudity represents ancestral continuities: naked when born, naked in the act of conceiving a new creature, 'naked' bones, and, finally, naked in the afterlife (Parker Pearson 1999: 45-71). The importance of the presence/absence of nudity as related to death also points to the crucial role clothing has in the performance of funerary rituals by several ancient and contemporaneous societies. For example, in texts from the Archive of the Royal Palace G in Ebla (c. 2450 B.C.E.) the new kings must bestow a tribute to their ancestors when visiting the royal family mausoleum, bringing with them such goods as clothing (Fronzaroli 1993). This is also the case of the so-called 'in one's Sunday best' worn by the dead in our contemporaneous western societies. Thus, archaeologists should make an effort to interpret the symbolic meaning of the clothing worn by the ancient dead, because those clothes which were originally pinned up to the people when buried, and are now recognizable only by the remaining bronze pins, as it carries with them the power of defeating the nudity of the underworld, strongly represented by the seven doors that Inanna had to pass through on her way to the Nether World (Pollock 1991). These 'funeral' clothes have in fact the same significant power as the garments of the holy me worn and removed by Inanna during her descent into the Nether World. The same me are worn by Dumuzi while he sits in on the throne of Uruk before Inanna and the galla seek him for his death (Wolkstein &amp; Kramer 1983: 75). Dumuzi and his pastoral world also play an essential role in the mythological construction of symbols associated with the Underworld and consequently, with the performance of the funerary ritual. Dumuzi is an idealized portrayal of the dual aspects of the Ancient Near Eastern world (civilized-living vs. wild-dead). Along with the mythological figure of Enkidu (27), he is divided between the 'city of Uruk' (the civilized human world) where he wears the me garments, and the (27) In the same way that Enkidu became civilized through sexual activities Dumuzi has moved himself from the role of a simple shepherd, living in a wild context, to that of the husband of a goddess (Inanna/Ishtar) and king of Uruk 'plowing' Inanna/Ishtar's vulva. Thus the sexual act is again used to reaffirm the power of rationality, the conquer of human order over natural disorder (Kramer 1969: 107-93). [33] 41</page><page sequence="34">'steppe' (the wild nature), where he hides himself behind the 'reed fence' of his 'sheepfold' to avoid the Underworld. In Ancient Near Eastern iconography, the sheepfold, along with the byre, can be considered as symbolic representations of animal farming and its inclusion in the economic tradition of these communities. The iconographic stylized description of both the sheepfold and the byre are in fact consistent with the real overall landscape of that time, which includes the use of: 'reed fences'; sheepfolds and byres; farmed fields with cultivated plants or 'plowing' grooves; urban landscapes, cities, and smaller villages marked by city walls; ziqqurats, houses, palaces, temples, and funerary mausoleums. Archaeological examples from Syro-anatolian regions include information available from the cuneiform texts of Ebla (Fronzaroli 1993), Tell Umm el-Marr in Syria between Ebla and Aleppo (Schwartz et al. 2000), Jerablus Tahtani, and Tell Banat, both along the Euphrates (Peltenburg et al. 1995, 2000; Porter, in press). These real ancient landscapes have been translated into symbols for social and cultural memories of the living communities of these regions (Jonker 1995: 35-42). These symbols have been consequently used to both construct mythological stories written in texts and to perform the rituals connected with them. In this way, rituals were reinforced by an ideological manipulation of the iconography connected with those symbols (28). Thus, included in the Titrig H?y?k 'trinket' mould of the crowned naked figure previously taken into account (Matney, Algaze &amp; Pittman 1997), we have found a schematic representation of a reed byre with two bulls protruding from the top of the poles (see Act I: Fig. 12.6). The symbolic relationship between this architectural structure, animal raising, and the figure of Dumuzi, both as the shepherd and Inanna s 'wild bull', should be strongly examined because of the archaeological context in which the mould was found. It was uncovered from within the courtyard (28) The pendant with a grooved circular shape (Fig. 12.1) that is part of the 'trinket' mould found in Titri? H?y?k (Act I) is an example of an iconic representation of a 'real' symbolic architectural structure. It is easily reminiscent of a stylized top plan of the conical funerary monument, 'White Monument A', found at some distance from the main site of Tell Banat. The conical structure, which is a huge tumulus of about 100 m in diameter and 20 m in height, is made from gravel and stones mixed with dirt with a final outer layer of white marble plaster. It 'once may have had the appearance of a layered cake, or perhaps a stepped pyramid' (Porter, in press), and it is the last version of this kind of 'mortuary mound' (ibid.) and belonging to the Banat Period III (2450-2350 B.C.E.). The 'White Monument A', as well as the earlier versions (B and C), 'contained a series of discrete burial deposits' and 'several deposited objects, primarily beads and biconical clay balls' (ibid.). The relationship between Titri? H?y?k and Tell Banat in terms of funerary rituals, such as the use of the intramural tombs at both sites, has already been emphasized in one of my previous studies (Laneri 1999). This new evidence (the pendant and the 'White Monument A') provide more material from which interpret the importance of monumental structures in the process of constructing social identities and religious beliefs (Bradley 1998). This happens usually through the use of landscape as a way of establishing a metaphoric and symbolic connection between an existing 'real life' and a world of imagination (Tilley 1999). 42 [34]</page><page sequence="35">of a house linked to one of Titri? H?y?k LEBA intramural tombs (see Act I; Laneri 1999). Included in this funerary assemblage is a double four-lugged jar separated by two bulls facing opposite directions, which are reminiscent of Gu-gal-anna, the bull husband of Ereshkigal (Black &amp; Green 2000: 77). A long, pear-shaped, lead peg with a hook on one side was also found in the same funerary chamber, with similar objects found inside of almost all of this site intramural tombs (29). As already shown in the previous section (Act I), this tool was probably inserted into a wall or the ceiling of the tomb for the suspension of funerary goods, most likely the double four-lugged jar with the bull figurines. This brings us again to the text of the 'Descent of Inanna to the Nether World', where it is written and repeated three times per each section: 1. Inanna's corpse was hanging from a hook on the wall; 2. Dumuzi's cup falls from the peg. This ability to define the metaphorical functions of archaeological assemblages found in the funerary context of Titrig H?y?k through association with the mythological figure of Dumuzi and the role he assumed in the Nether World, can act as a model for the importance of other symbolic actions performed in accordance with funerary rituals of the ancient communities of Titri? H?y?k. For example, the discovery of the plaster basin in the corner of a late 3rd millennium B.C.E. Titrig H?y?k house, containing seventeen skulls and a 60 cm thick layer of bones, provides an incredible opportunity to explore the multiple roles of the figure of Geshtinanna as Dumuzi's sister, as Inanna's substitute in the Nether World for six months, and as the 'rootstock of the grapevine' (Wolkstein &amp; Kramer 1983: 168). These symbolic correlations bring us back to the beginning of this section and the existing association between the production of wine and the belief in kur&gt; one of the Sumerian words for afterlife (Kramer 1972: 76-96). Geshtinanna serves as a direct link between the world of the living, represented by wine production, and the world of the dead, symbolized by her residence in the Nether World for six months, signifying that Dumuzi and Geshtinanna [...] are now responsible for keeping open the passage from the Great Above to the Great Below. (Wolkstein &amp; Kramer 1983: 168). (29) The importance of material choice for the manufacture of objects used for the performance of the funerary rituals in the Ancient Near East is a topic that probably needs further analyses in the future. Lead, for example, was used for casting objects for funerary rituals in Southern Mesopotamia as well as South Eastern and Central Anatolia regions (Zettler et al. 1998). The 'trinket' moulds of the type previously analyzed were probably used to cast lead figurine and pendants (Canby 1965; Matney, Algaze &amp; Pittman 1997). Similarly, the cups found near the head of dead in several Mesopotamian cemeteries were also made out of lead (Zettler et al. 1998; Ozdogan &amp; Basgelen 1999: 35-64). And finally, even in recent times lead was melted in front of the home by Turkish for apotropaic purposes (Stein personal communication). [35] 43</page><page sequence="36">Thus, the plaster basin carries both a productive and symbolic meaning for the ancient communities of Titrig H?y?k. On the one hand it portrays the production of wine {geshtin), while on the other it represents a perfect connection between the world of the living and the 'underworld' of the dead, made possible by Geshtinanna's efforts. This process was probably made possible through the use of the plaster basin for the purification of the human bones (with wine?) (30). Following the comparisons between a portion of the text dedicated to the beliefs about the Underworld by Ancient Near Eastern communities ('The Descent of Inanna to the Nether World'), to the late 3rd millennium B.C.E. intramural tombs of Titris H?y?k (funerary goods, treatment of the corpse, architectural features) and the interpretation of the symbolic meanings of objects (liquid containers, the 'trinket' mould) and features (the plaster basin) found in contexts connected with both the world of the living and the dead, we can possibly suppose, or, if you prefer, speculate, that a ritual was performed inside of these tombs, probably similar to the one described in the 'Descent of Inanna'. The rites de passage can be separated into three different moments, as part of this process of reconstructing the performance of this rituality: 1. Internal - separation of the living from the dead: visible from the archaeological records buried inside of the tomb, such as the use of specific symbolic objects in the funerary assemblages (in Titrig H?y?k: liquid containers, 'Syrian bottles', four-lugged jars, lead pegs, cloths, beads, weapons, and others) and the treatment of the corpse (in Titrig H?y?k: primary or secondary deposition); 2. Internal/External - the mourning of the living: not visible from the archaeological records found within the tombs, but reconstructable from the ancient texts as a possible form of mourning and lamentation performed during the funerary rituals (for example the text of 'The Descent of Inanna to the Nether World'); 3. External - re-aggregation of the living: sometimes discernible amongst the archaeological records in the form of ex-votos related to the memory of the dead, as simple cults of the dead or as a sign of a cult of the ancestors (D?rkheim 1912: 250-76). In the case of Titrig H?y?k and other 3rd millennium Near Eastern settlements, this scenario is recognizable from both the offering in the dromos of the (30) It is very important to remember that from a preliminary physical anthropological report made from the University of Ankara (Dilek Erdal personal communication), fifteen skulls are of young adults showing clear traces of wounds probably made by weapons, on two skulls these are traces of trepanation, one other skull is of an infant, and the final one is of a young woman. Further analyses will permit a better study of the symbolic role played by this unusual funerary deposition (violent death from a battle or a human sacrifice?), but it is also important to remind that Inanna/Ishtar is the divinity of both Love and War. In (Jayonu, a Neolithic site along the river Tigris 50 km North of the modern town of Diyarbakir, a dwelling was used to decompose the corpses of the dead prior to the final burial of the skulls and bones underneath the floors of other houses. The symbolic role of this dwelling was probably similar to the plaster basin found in Titri? H?y?k. 44 [36]</page><page sequence="37">tombs and the discovery of figurines, pendants, or moulds for their casting in the world of the living' (Laneri, in press; Porter, in press). In the last act I attempt a sort of hypothetical reconstruction of daily life activities, ancient rituals, and magical beliefs related to the funerary customs during the late 3rd millennium B.C.E. city of Titri? H?y?k. This reconstruction will follow a fine line that blurs and merges diverse topics such as the concept of the underworld and funerary customs, the symbolic use of wine, and the role of sexuality in the construction of ideologies and rituals. The reconstruction is based on the data analyzed in the first paragraph, but in several instances the narration will stretch beyond the boundaries of reality entering a world of fantasy more rooted in the ancient texts (31), such as The Descent of Inanna to the Nether World', or as a parody of other contemporaneous funerary rituals. Act III Reconstruction Once upon a time, at the beginning of the 3rd millennium B.C.E., a group of people decided to establish their own settlement on top of a small limestone hill, nowadays known as Titrig H?y?k, a village which lays between a small creek, the Tavuk (^ay, and the main river way of the Euphrates. This area, with its direct access to the water, developed into an ideal place for farming olives, pistachios, acorns, vetches, wheat, barley, and grapes, but also, because of its proximity to both the Euphrates and the Taurus Mountains, a perfect city for trading finished products (pottery, clothing) and raw materials (limestone, metal, wood) between Southern Mesopotamian and Anatolian communities. Sheep, goats, cows, and other animals were raised. Outside of the main city walls there was an area devoted to the manufacture of stone objects, primarily flint tools. At this time the technique of casting metal objects was increasing the efficiency of the production of useful objects and bronze weapons needed by the local army. After five centuries, when agriculture, object manufacture, trading and animal farming were fully established for the realization of a perfect social and economic organization, the village slowly expanded and became a town of 45 ha. The population increased. New houses were rebuilt on the top of the old ones through the use of a terrace system, and additional houses were erected on virgin territory, following an architectural plan based the Southern Mesopotamian distribution of (31) We should not forget we have little knowledge about the practice of funerary rituals during the 3rd millennium B.C.E. (Kramer 1972). Thus some of the Sumerian terms used in this paragraph are an adaptation of similar roles found in other later texts. For example gudu is the Sumerian translation of the priest appointed for the libations in the practice of rituals of the 1st millennium B.C.E. [37] 45</page><page sequence="38">Space. The courtyard was the center of daily life activities. A thick city wall now surrounded the entire city. The workers abandoned the manufacturing area and joined the population of the main town. Everything slowly changed... and the cemeteries, 'the city of the dead', were abandoned. The living population realized that death should be incorporated into their daily life. They preferred to move the burials of their ancestors inside of their homes, a sudden change from the traditional rituals previously used. The transformed communities based their familial group and the ownership of their homes on a certain lineage, with a strong link between them and their ancestors, the spirits of the dead... the memory of the selected dead, buried inside of the home and inside of the tombs built as foundations for the main outer walls of the houses, became the center of the life of the living. Certain rituals, beliefs, myths, and even the production of specific foods were all connected to those ancestral spirits, forming a religious cohesive force that provided the living communities with the possibility of producing more and formulating better answers to define the unexplainable nature of death. To create this 'perfect world' it was necessary to conjure up symbols that intermingled the cult of the ancestors with daily life activities. Symbolic meaning is given to the geshtin, the Sumerian word for wine, and the large plaster basins, constructed inside of the dwelling for the producing of wine. Wine is the ideal metaphor for the course of life... for the blood that flows inside of the human veins and disappears after our deaths... reappearing in a different way... in an alcoholic beverage that gives pleasure to human beings. At that time the production of wine was one of the primary agricultural activities throughout Southeastern Anatolia, and through the process of making wine solid religious beliefs relating to the afterlife were also formed. Geshtinanna, the 'rootstock of the grapevine', was venerated as a divinity associated with the geshtin and the Underworld, where she was trapped for six months after Dumuzi, combined with 'the power to grow the grain', was freed from the imprisonment of Ereshkigal, 'Queen of the Underworld'. For their release the help of Inanna was needed... Inanna, the Goddess of Love, War, Fertility, Birth and Sexuality. It is these four mythological characters who were fundamental to the performance of the ritual of purifying the corpses of the dead ancestors. Prior to burial and eternal rest this act of purification could take place in the plaster basin where the bones of the dead, once removed from their original corpse, were cleaned of the impurities accumulated during life. But to make the ritual effective, the ritual had to be repeated at precise intervals... one month... one year... three years... seven years in order to execute for the living a continual positive influence from the new spiritual ancestors. The reading and singing of mythological and religious texts by the performers became another prime requirement for the successful outcome of ritual. The ritual was directed by a leader, the dugu, to reconstruct a mythological scenario known by all of the attendants... a lead 'peg' with a 'hooked' end was inserted into the ceiling of the funerary chamber as a reminder of Inanna, 46 [38]</page><page sequence="39">Geshtinanna, and Dumuzi s defeat by Ereshkigal, the 'Queen of the Underworld'... a four-lugged jar embellished with a double headed bull, a metaphorical reference to Dumuzi and his 'drinking cup' falling from 'its peg', was attached to a rope and hung from the lead peg after the body or the bones of the dead were laid on the virgin soil dressed in the appropriate clothing... the containers for animal sacrifices and beverages, such as wine, beer, and milk, were brought into the tomb to purify the newly deceased and venerate the spirits of the ancestors... everything was ready... the dugu poured the libations over the tomb and corpse... the attendants mourned and repeated three times the words to allow the spirit of the dead to be welcomed into the new status of ancestral spirit and member of the kur... The churn was silent. No milk was poured. The cup was shattered. Dumuzi was no more. The sheepfold was given to the winds. The ritual was over. The community of the household could reconstruct its own identity. The spirit of the new ancestor belonged to the memory of the group. The beliefs were at this point linked to the symbolic roles that fertility and re-birth played in the production of daily life activities. The ancestral crypt was silent... consecrated to the cult of the Underworld. Figurines and pendants were kept, worn and venerated by individuals of the group as symbols for devotion to that holy place, the intramural tomb. A few steps down and a threshold away were the only barriers which separated their quiet life from the kur, but it always served as reminder during their daily activities of who held their future... their fate... their death. Holy Ereshkigal! Great is your renown! Holy Ereshkigal! I sing your praises! [39] 47</page><page sequence="40">REFERENCES Algaze, G. et al. (1995) Titris H?y?k.
