<plain_text><page sequence="1">RELIGIOUS ART EAST AND WEST The religious art of all peoples and periods has always been the ex- pression in visual form of their belief in unseen supernatural powers governing their lives and destinies. This revelation of the truths of belief may take either a symbolical or an anthropomorphic form, depending on the religion and the social conditions of the times. Although the artist devoted to religious themes may work within a discipline imposed by tradition, it is always possible that a painter like Giotto or El Greco may impose on timeworn themes such hu- manity or such an aura of supernal mystery as to impel the beholder to belief by this moving pictorial presentation that is in reality the artist's personal interpretation of scripture. Under such conditions religious art becomes a new religious experience. In the same way, an artist working within the framework of a tradition of prescribed iconography and technical procedure may out of his own imagination present such a heightened comprehension, an exegesis of the articles of belief, that his painted or sculptured icon will move the devotee more than an image by another uninspired artisan who simply follows the canons imposed upon him by his tradition. In many of the works to be discussed in this paper, the icons, although not in any sense original inventions, are the works of men who within the discipline of their craft, and using prototypes drawn from many sources, pro- duced creations of compelling splendor. 11 Benjamin Rowland</page><page sequence="2">Religious Art East and West It could be stated as a generality that religious art employs the same techniques and styles as what is called secular art, so that, for example, the intricate convolutions on a page illuminated by an Irish monk in the eighth century are no different from the ornaments in gold wrought by secular craftsmen of the same period. Again, the pathos and realism of a saint painted in the Baroque period are also present in the representations of pagan themes in the seventeenth century. The artist dedicated to producing religious works of art in a period of belief will be possessed of a body of iconographical and technical recipes inherited as part of his training or imparted by clerical instruc- tion. This corpus of information makes him an artist competent to express the truths of the faith comprehensible at different levels and in different ways by the learned churchman and the layman. The icon which he manufactures will be imbued with the symbolical at- tributes necessary to make it at once magically effective as a revela- tion of a divine prototype and touching the heart or inspiring the awe of the ordinary worshiper. This language of religious expression mani- fests itself within the framework of the style determined by such factors as the society and the background of the artist. It is the concern of the religious artist to translate into concrete terms the concepts of Christian and Buddhist doctrine, sometimes of such a transcendent metaphysical nature as to defy an explicit em- bodiment in plastic form. Although every great artist will bring what we describe as imagination or originality to his creation, it is as true of Michelangelo as of the anonymous maker of Buddhist images that he is inevitably affected by his knowledge of pre-existing forms that provide models for his guidance. Although some forms of religious art are perforce inventions for which no pictorial prototypes existed, the artists of early Christianity and Buddhism in many instances adopted the vocabulary of earlier religious art for the expression of new ideas. This is the principal concern of this paper. There is, of course, the possibility that craftsmen separated in time and place might independently arrive at a similar solution for presenting a like concept, but the history of the development of the style and iconog- raphy of Christian and Buddhist art reveals that in the main the artist attached to these religions relied on ready-made forms in pagan art or earlier Asiatic art which they found readily adaptable to the solution of their problems. The result of this common heritage is a great number of parallels both in iconography and style, which are of great interest and importance for the study of the interrelationships between Buddhism and Christianity in the beginning of their plastic traditions. 12</page><page sequence="3">The parallels that exist between religious art in the worlds of early Buddhism and Christianity are partly the result of similarities in- herited from beliefs of previous periods, revealing themselves in similar plastic or pictorial form. In other cases they may be attributed to the transmission of artistic influences, in which the pre-existing form may in turn affect belief and its artistic expression. At other times these parallels may be attributed to exchanges in doctrine through the intermediary of faiths like Mithraism and Mazdaism that prevailed in the geographic regions separating East and West, or they may be traced to certain common backgrounds in the religions of the ancient Near East. These parallels are not always contemporary but often reflect the taking up of earlier artistic forms or beliefs by one or the other religious system over a period of centuries. The nimbus is a common attribute of early Christian and Byzan- tine art, as it is of Indian art from the first century A.D. onward. In this case we are dealing with a common adaptation of the sun disk used as a device to symbolize supraterrestrial splendor or divine light in the Mazdean period or Achaemenid art in Iran. In the Iranian art of this classical period a disk is set behind the personification of Ahura Mazda as a symbolical reference to the sun and the celestial glory of the supreme light. In this very simple example of the adaptation of older emblems by later religious systems the sun disk of Ahura Mazda was transformed into the halo to denote the divine radiance emanating from the persons of Christ and Buddha. As will be seen, we also have to deal with the phenomenon in art of separate religious systems literally inventing a new imagery based on their common heritage from both the Asiatic and Hellenic past and in each case modified by the requirements of a particular iconography. Although the question of the independent evolution of ideas and belief and their portrayal in art in widely separated places and times is always within the range of possibility, it is logical to assume that many of these parallels represent both developments from a common source or borrowings by one religious system from another. The ex- amination of a number of these spiritual and artistic affinities is a subject of vital importance both for the history of religions and the history of art. The development of Christian and Buddhist art in the early cen- turies of our era affords an opportunity for the study of certain parallels in concepts and stylistic expression that are the result partly of similarities in doctrine, and partly the result of common borrowings from the tradition of classical pagan art. Most of the examples chosen for comparison and analysis will be drawn from early Christian sculp- ture of the third to the fifth centuries and from the semi-Roman school 13</page><page sequence="4">Religious Art East and West of art that flourished in Gandhara, now northwestern Pakistan, in the first five centuries of the Christian era. Among the parallels existing between Christian and Buddhist art that are founded on common iconographical as well as doctrinal back- ground are the first representations of Christ and Buddha in early Christian art and the Greco-Buddhist art of Gandhara. GANDHARA AND EARLY CHRISTIAN ART: BUDDHA PALLIATUS The resemblance of certain Gandhara statues of the Buddha, such as those excavated at Hadda in Afghanistan, to early representations of Christ (Figs. 1 and 2) has long been noticed, as has the fact that both apparently spring from the Greek orator type as exemplified by the Sophocles of the Lateran.l In these Buddha figures the garment worn is unmistakably a himation and not the regular sanghdtz: even though the undergarment visible in some of these statues suggests the tunic worn under the Roman toga, this mantle should, as will be explained directly, be described as a himation or pallium from the association of this dress with the ancient philosophers.2 The various personages in antique sculpture with the right hand emerging from the himation 1 H. Graeven, "Ein Christustypus in Buddhafiguren," Oriens Christianus (1901), pp. 159-67; L. Brehier, L'Art chretien (Paris, 1928), p. 50, etc. The German scholar of liturgical vestments, Father Braun, describing a typical Gandhara Buddha, has written: "Es sind merkwiirdige Darstellungen, die nicht selten wie ein getreues Bild eines christlichen Priesters aus altchristlicher Zeit in seiner liturgischen Gewandung aussehen" (J. Braun, Die liturgische Gewandung [Frei- burg, 1907], p. 243). 2 The word "pallium" used here is not to be confused with the Christian vest- ment, the "pallium" or "palla," with which, so far as the writer has been able to discover, it has no connection. The classical word "pallium" in classical Latin meant any kind of covering, garment, or a mantle; it was also the equivalent of the Greek "himation," which differed from the Roman toga in being a rectangular piece of cloth and not rounded or semicircular like the toga. The himation or pallium, which, we may conclude from what follows, is the garment worn by the Sophocles of the Lateran and the Aeschines of the Naples Museum, was, as Tertullian tells us, particularly reserved for philosophers, orators, poets, etc. (J. Wilpert, "Neue Monumente zur Symbolik des heiligen Palliums," Romische Quartalschrift, II/II [1926], 96); Pliny (NH. xxxv, 40) implies that "palliatus" was a regular synonym for "philosopher." It was, as can be seen in the frescoes of Dura Europas, a garment worn by those who came before God or the people on ceremonial occasions. Although at first held in contempt by the Romans, this garment later replaced the toga in popularity. The pallium-himation was inter- national in popularity in contrast with the national character of the Roman toga. Worthy of note with regard to Christ's dress is Wilpert's statement (I sarcofagi cristiani antichi, II [Rome, 1932], 6): "Mai il Signore porta la toga, come qualcuno ha supposto." Erwin Goodenough has kindly called to my attention the fact that the wearing of the pallium is probably to be associated with the dress of the priests of Osiris in Egypt and of the Roman mystery cults of the Near East whose function it was to conduct the devotee to the realm of the shades, just as Christ and Buddha clad in this same garment, welcome the soil to the other world. In the burials in the Roman Fayum the dead who have been translated to the realm of Osiris are often arrayed in the pallium; in similar fashion, this robe is worn by the deceased in Palmyra grave portraits and by priests in the wall paintings of Dura Europas (see Goodenough, Jewish Symbols in the Greco-Roman Period [New York, 1953]). 14</page><page sequence="5">FIG. 1.-Christ, sarcophagus from Psamatia, FIG. 2.-Buddha from Hadda, Afghanistan, third century A.D., Kaiser Friedrich Museum, third-fourth century A.D., Kabul Museum, Berlin. Afghanistan.</page><page sequence="6">or pallium illustrate a style of wearing the garment that prevailed in every quarter of the late Antique world: it is paralleled at once in the Buddhas of Gandhara, in Roman portrait statues, in portrayals of Christ, and in the countless grave reliefs of Palmyra.3 The fact that the pallium, draped in such a way that the right arm was supported as though muffled in a sling, continued to be worn until at least the fourth century is illustrated in many portrait statues, notably the effigy of Julian the Apostate in the Louvre.4 It was not a prevailing fashion of dress, however, but the association of this costume with ancient representations of philosophers and teachers that led to its adaptation to the early images of Christ and Buddha.5 However, the resemblance between the first statues of Christ and Buddha is not at all surprising if we consider that both are the result of closely parallel philosophic concepts in the religious complex of the Greco-Roman orbit: Justin had stated that Socrates was the "best" of the classic philosophers, since he denied the ancient gods and enjoined man to seek the unknown god in the Logos; he therefore urged his followers to know Christ as the personal appearance of the Logos indwelling in all people.6 The implication that Christ is of the line of the great classic teachers is almost too obvious. Augustine again draws a parallel between Christ, the Master of the new doctrine, and the ancient philosophers: "paucis mutatis verbis," he says, in speaking of Plato, "atque sententiis Christiani fierent."7 Christ the Pedagogue is here 3L.

Wilson, loc. cit.). What Br6hier (op. cit., p. 50) says about the Christ figure in relation to the antique philosopher type can be applied equally well to the evolution of the Buddha from the orator type: "Sur toutes ces ceuvres on trouve une ressemblance d'attitude qui ne peut etre l'effet du hasard: le bras droit enroule dans les plis de l'himation avec la main posee sur la poitrine, le bras gauche rejete en arriere et appuye a la hanche, tout le corps portant sur la jambe gauche et legerement renverse, la physionomie grave et meditative qui force l'attention des auditeurs, tels sont les traits qui distinguent le type abstrait du philosophe ou du docteur." 6One is tempted to draw a parallel between this concept and the Nirmanakaya and Dharmakaya of Buddhism. 7 F. Saxl, "Fruhes Christentum und spates Heidentum in ihren kiinstl. Aus- drucksformen," Wiener Jahrbuch fur Kunstgeschichte, I1 (1923), 68. In the pre- Constantinian period Christ is the true philosopher who leads men back to the true Paradise lost by the sin of Adam. The earliest Christian symbol of this concept is the Good Shepherd; at the same time, Christus philosophicus is shown instructing his followers in the true doctrine (see F. Gerke, Christus in der Spatantiken Plastik [Berlin, 1940], p. 7). 15</page><page sequence="7">Religious Art East and West again thought of as replacing the teachers of the ancients.8 Concepts of this sort made it natural to represent the great teacher of Chris- tianity in the iconography of the "teacher-orator" of the classic world. So also Justin preached the Word of God clad in the philosopher's gown. It seems almost redundant to point out that, in a similar way, Buddha was regarded as the great teacher, the denier of the ancient order as represented by the Vedas: the Greco-Roman workmen who fashioned his images in Gandhara, like their early Christian cousins chose the classic orator type as the most suitable for portraying the Teacher, the "Logos" of the Eastern world.9 Father Braun states that the philosopher's gown was worn by holy men in the Roman Christian world of the second and third centuries and that it was regarded as a garb of honor.'? As Br6hier has demonstrated, there was nothing un- usual in the selection of the pagan orator type for the representation of our Lord, who was Himself the supreme teacher, the eternal Peda- gogue.ll It is eminently worthy of note that, in both the Buddha and Christ image, a youthful ephebic type is substituted for the mature bearded faces of the orators. It has been suggested that the early Christian representations of Christ as a young man with long hair are taken over from earlier Apollonian prototypes.l2 Our Lord's Resurrection is 8 On a sarcophagus from Monastirne, now in the museum at Salona, Christ wearing the philosopher's gown and surrounded by a host of children is portrayed as the divine Pedagogue (see O. Wulff, Altchristliche und Byzantinische Kunst, I [Berlin, 1914], Abb. 167, 173-74. The incident is undoubtedly based on Christ's blessing of the children and the idea of the acceptance of the Kingdom of God ex- pressed in Luke 18:15-17. 9 "Buddha und Christus sind gleichermassen Antipoden des Herosklassischer Pragung. Jiidisch-hellenistischer und indisch-hellenistischer Spiritualismus haben die Welt erobert" (F. Saxl, Mithras [Berlin, 1931], p. 107). It must be strongly emphasized that, at about the same time or slightly earlier, the Buddha was being portrayed as a Yaksha in the studios of Mathura. The independent origin of these first truly Indian "portraits" of Sakyamuni is beyond question, since they have nothing to do with either the style or concept of the Gandhara Buddhas. 10 Op. cit., pp. 65, 657. 11 Brehier, op. cit., p. 50.

Elliger, Zur Entste- hung und freihen Entwicklung der altchristlichen Bildkunst (Leipzig, 1934), p. 247; Gerke, op. cit., pp. 10, 12, 77. 12 For the stylistic aspect of this borrowing see H. Diitschke, Ravennatische Studien (Leipzig, 1909), p. 117. The Apollonian Christ type, as seen in a sar- cophagus in the Lateran (Gerke, op. cit., Abb. 53-55) seems to be a borrowing from the archaistic Apollo bronzes of the Naples Museum; generally, the Buddha heads are more closely related to the Apollo Belvedere, the krobylos forming a ready-made shape for the usnisa (see A. Foucher, L'Art Greco-Bouddhique du Gan- dhdra, II [Paris, 1918], 296 ff., etc.). Although he refers to youthful representations of Christ as "Apollonian" in spirit (p. 42), Gerke never specifically suggests an Apollo type as model. Presumably the deification of Christ, which took place in the fourth century and which we can see in the emergence of the Maiestas Domini concept, demanded a "supernaturally" beautiful representation of the Lord of the World. The deification of Christ is, of course, implied in the Fourth Gospel. 16</page><page sequence="8">the sun's rising; His descent into Hell the setting of the orb beyond the Western rim.l3 The analogy to the daily and eternal course of Helios-Apollo is apparent at once. Beyond this there are many de- scriptions in the Gospels and the writings of the church fathers that, by the luciferous character attributed to Christ, must have suggested the pagan images of the sun-god as models for representing Him. I need mention only Our Lord's "glory," referred to so often in the Gospels (John 1:14, etc.) or that His face "did shine as the sun" (Matt. 7:2). Ambrose, indeed, addresses Christ directly as "Sol": Splendor paternae gloriae de luce lucem proferens, Primordiis lucis novae diem dies illuminans. Verusque sol illabere, micans nitore perpeti, .. .14 A similar choice of the classic sun-god as the type for the Buddha may naturally have suggested itself to the Eurasian artisans who carved the images at Gandhara from the frequent allusions to the Buddha's solar character in the sutras. The following quotations will illustrate this point: The Buddhas shine both by night and by day.'5 Like the Sun bursting from a cloud in the morning, ... so he, too, when he was born from his mother's womb, made the world bright like gold;... dispelled the darkness.16 He shone like the young sun descended upon the earth.7 He will shine forth as a sun of knowledge to destroy the darkness of illusion in the world.l8 As far as we can say at the moment, Sakyamuni must have been represented in the guise of Sophocles and Aeschinus at the same time that Christ was given a similar anthropomorphic representation.19 We 13 W.

Cf. Diitschke, op. cit., p. 101. 17</page><page sequence="9">Religious Art East and West may be justified in assuming that the iconographic type was intro- duced from the Roman Orient. Again the stylistic parallels between this type in the East and West are as close as the spiritual similarities suggested by the literary sources mentioned above: the Buddha in our illustration (Fig. 2) has-as is only to be expected-the same sharp and linear caricature of the form-fitting robe of the Hellenistic orator type that we find in the well-known example from Psamatia (Fig. 1). SOLAR SYMBOLISM IN BUDDHISM AND CHRISTIANITY The solar nature of Christ and Buddha has already been referred to in our examination of the "palliatus" type. Even more explicit sug- gestions of solar symbolism in Buddhism and early Christianity are worthy of more intensive exploration. Significant as at least partly explaining the mentality that led to the eventual emergence of the Buddha and Sun myths is a passage from the Buddhacarita in which Sakyamuni, on entering the "place of austerities," is mistaken for the sun-god or the moon: "This is Suryadeva or Candradeva, coming down."20 This is enough to show that fundamentally the identification of Buddha with the sun seems to have grown up within the complex of Indian philosophic-religious ideas. The transformation of the Buddha into the driver of the solar chariot is not markedly different from the ideology that deified the Roman emperor as Helios-Kosmokrator, and Khosrau as the brother of the sun and moon: as an example of this iconography we may cite the portrayal of Caracalla and other rulers as the sun-god Helios.21 Something of the same concept is seen in the early Christian representations of Helios in connection with figures of Peter, the Good Shepherd, etc.; Philo of Alexandria saw the Logos in the rising sun; in the poetry and exegesis of Christian Egypt, the morning orb is Christ himself.22 The solar character of Christ is, of course, symbolized in the feast of His birth, supplanting the Roman festival for the New Year and the sun, a means whereby the early Christians sought to rival the ancient pagan holiday with their own. In the tympana of the cathedrals of Parma and Piacenza the sun is 20 Buddhacarita, op. cit., LIX, 72. 21 0. Brendel, "Das Schild des Achilles," Die Antike, XII, No. 4 (1936), 272 ff. The Emperor Galerius as kosmokrator is represented seated above the sun and moon on his triumphal arch at Saloniki (cf. Peirce and Tyler, L'Art byzantin, I [Paris, 1931], P1. I).

The central figure in this decoration stands upon a crescent and is inclosed in a huge sun disk. It is clad in a long mantle of the Parthian and Kushan sovereigns and surrounded by a variety of emblems stressing the astral character of the decoration. This image is a reference to the Buddha as another sun, rising to illuminate the dark- ness of the world. A symbolic allusion to the solar nature indicated by the Apollonian type of Buddha is discussed in an earlier section. The painting is evidently intended to be read in context with the giant statue beneath and the paintings of the Buddhas of past eras represent- ed on the haunch of the vault. Pictorially this is only one of a number of such references in Buddhist art to Sakyamuni in his solar aspect. In a relief from Mathura, we have a frieze with a series of events from the life of the Buddha: in this arrangement, the place normally occupied by the Nativity of Gautama is replaced by a representation of Surya in his chariot. Below this band of carving is a zone with the Buddhas of the past and Maitreya, so that, as at Bamiyan with the painted representations of the Manushi Buddhas, the symbolical implication is that, like these other teachers of other eras, Sakyamuni at his birth dawned as another sun to illumine the world. In the same way the many other portrayals of Sfirya the sun-god at Bodh Gaya, Bhaja, and elsewhere are allusions to the Buddha's solar nature just as the cars of sun and moon at Parma are references to the celestial light of Christ. THE COLOSSAL IMAGE IN BUDDHIST AND CHRISTIAN ART The enlargement of the earliest images of Christ and Buddha to colossal size presents another problem of iconographic and stylistic affinities in the two religions. This problem of the use of magnification to suggest the supernatural aspects of the deity is one that concerns both the iconography of Buddhism and that of early Christianity. Everyone is, of course, familiar with the making of giant statues in the ancient world and the transference of this concept to the statues of the deified Roman emperors in the late Antique Period. In Bud- dhism the earliest examples of the colossus in art are to be found in the two giant Buddha statues carved in the sandstone cliff at Bamiyan. 23 A. K. Porter, Lombard Architecture, I (New Haven, Conn., 1917), 352. 19</page><page sequence="11">Religious Art East and West The larger of the two colossi at Bamiyan (Fig. 3) is housed in an enormous cusped niche at the western end of the great cliff. It was carved presumably at about the same time as its smaller companion.24 Although the hands are now broken off, it seems likely that originally the right hand was raised in "abhaya mudrd," and the left, as in so many Buddha statues of Mathura and Gandhara, was shown holding a fold of the robe. It is notable that, in his description of this statue, Hsiian-tsang refers to it merely as "Fo hsiang" (Jap. butsuzs), or "Buddha image," whereas he specifically designated the smaller idol at Bamiyan as Sakyamuni.25 The scheme of painted decoration in the interior of the great vaulted chamber originally was even more extensive and complicated than the cycle in the niche of the smaller Buddha. We can see standing on the head of the colossus, ornamenting the ceiling above, the images of numerous enthroned bodhisattvas with attendants and musicians. On the haunch of the vault at the right and left again are rows of these seated deities. Immediately below are painted Buddhas in multicol- ored halos and in various mudrds. Looking up from the feet of the giant statue we can see that the under surfaces of the cusps of the arches are painted with the representations of trinities of flying deities in medallions. Below these again are the fragments of row upon row of Buddhas, differentiated from one another by their mudrds and the trees under which they are seated. At present the first seventy-five feet of wall surface is devoid of any painting. I repeat here that the very scale of this great image at Bamiyan implies that the religious of this center considered the Buddha as a more than mortal teacher and is thereby thoroughly in keeping with the transcendent nature attributed to him by the Lokottaravadins. We should also consider in this regard the possible influence of classic antiquity on the fashioning of enormous images of the gods not only in Christian iconography, but also as here on Buddhist art. I need only 24 The drapery style of the smaller (120-foot) statue is an enormous enlargement of the formula of deeply channeled folds with sharp crests seen in Gandhara images of the third and fourth centuries A.D. (cf. L. Bachhofer, Early Indian Sculpture (New York, n.d.), P1. 155). Allowing for a time-lag between Bamiyan and the main centers of Greco- Buddhist art, it may be even later. The wall paintings decorating the niche of this image are, as I have shown elsewhere, certainly no earlier than the sixth or seventh century A.D. (cf. B. Rowland, "The Dating of the Sassanian Paintings at Bamiyan and Dukhtar-i-Nushirvan," Bulletin of the Iranian Institute, December, 1946, pp. 35-42). The larger (175-foot) image is a magnification of Mathura statues of the Gupta period in which the drapery is reduced to a pattern of stringlike loops (cf. A. K. Coomaraswamy, History of Indian and Indonesian Art [London, 1927], Fig. 158). This figure at Bamiyan may, therefore, be dated not earlier than the fifth century A.D. 26 S. Beal, Buddhist Records of the Western World, I (London, 1906), p. 50. 20</page><page sequence="12">FIG. 3.-The 175-foot Buddha, Bamiyan, Afghanistan, fourth-fifth century A.D.</page><page sequence="13">mention the statue of the Olympian Zeus and the effigies of the div- inized emperors of Rome among the logical artistic prototypes for the practice of magnification to suggest a supraterrestrial power.26 There is a possible parallel and explanation for the making of colossi in the beginnings of Christian art. In the West, the early Christian conception of the Lord as the Good Shepherd was in Byzantium of the fourth century and was later replaced by the conception of the super- human Christ reigning in majesty above the skies. Under influences almost certainly emanating from Iran, the emperors as early as Con- stantine had assumed the title of kosmokrator; the founder of Byzan- tium himself was portrayed in statues of giant size, dimensions deemed appropriate for the Lord of the Universe. When the emperor himself had thus grown to colossal stature, it was hardly possible to show any longer the Light of the World as a mere man; there evolved imme- diately the Christ Pantocrator, Ruler of All and regal embodiment of the Word of the Father. Since colossi do not appear in Buddhism before the Gandhara school, it may be that among the contributions of this hybrid art was the plastic realization of the superhuman nature of the Buddha contained in the texts, aided and abetted by the Greco- Roman artists' knowledge of over life-sized figures of gods and kosmok- rators in the West. Although Christian art can boast no images on the scale of the Eastern examples, the enormously enlarged representations of Christ in the mosaics of the domes and apses of Byzantine churches are il- lustrations of the same principle. In both Buddhist and Christian art the colossus is an outgrowth of the ancient device of hieratic scaling, in which the most significant personage was magnified in order to assert its importance over other figures in the painting or relief. Before the colossi at Bamiyan and the pantocrators of Byzantium the spectator himself provides the scale for the giant being that over- shadows him. One very good reason for creating colossal images of Buddha even at a very early period would be the conception of the Lord as Maha- purusa. Buddha and Cakravartin, with whom he early became iden- tified, are essentially the Purusa (Prajapati) of vedic mythology and mysticism: the "laksanas" are derived from the distinctive marks 26 On this problem in early Christian art, consult Visser, op. cit., p. 61. It must be remembered-especially in regard to what follows-that the Mahasanghika sects regarded the Tathagatas as having limitless rapakaya (cf. R.

"Thou art the Ancient Puruga" (XI, 18).30 As Paul Mus has remarked there is a suggestion of just such a cosmological stature in the Buddha's flattening the earth with his footsteps, in the likening of his head to an umbrella;31 indeed Coomaraswamy has shown that the early icons symbolizing Buddha by a parasol, altar, and footprints are really likenesses of the "mystical" body of the Great Person, respectively, sky, air, and earth-or, in other words, the cosmic anatomy of Prajapati.32 It be- comes clear with this that, as cosmic god and universal ruler (Purusa- Cakravartin) equal to all space, Buddha could appropriately be shown in enormous size as though literally filling a whole "cosmos."33 That cosmos is-in the case of the Bamiyan Buddhas the shrine or niche that, like the chaitya, the elevation of which it reproduces in cross- section, may be understood as the cosmic house-its portals broad as the earth, its roof the sky:34 "Cut .. .in the vertical direction, the massive world fabric shows its net where everything is fixed in its place."35 This idea of the Buddha-Purusa is already present in the chapter on the vision of the Universal Form in the Bhagavad Gita and corres- ponds to the conception of Vairocana in the Kegonkyo, in which text the Tathagata's body is described as comprehending all the directions, all space, all living beings;36 a similar text, the Bommokyo, determined 27 Cf.

Although it is, of course, impossible to state categorically that the colossus in Afghani- stan already represents a production of the worship of Vairocana or Universal Buddha as understood by the esoteric sects, the implica- tions of what we see at Bamiyan-an enormous image surrounded by paintings of multiple Buddhas and bodhisattvas-certainly suggests that the idea of Vairocana is there in all but name. It is safe to say that the concept of Buddha as Mahapurusa, present even in Hinayana texts, and the role of Lokottara, assigned to him in the Mahasanghika sects, can be seen as working together to produce these first colossi of the Buddhist world.40 The giant statues of Yiin Kang and Lung-Men are the full development of this ideology and show us the Universal Lord of the Lotus Sutra and the Avatamsaka- Buddha as Brahma, the Father of the World. THE TRANSCENDENTAL CHRIST AND BUDDHA Related to the idea of the colossus as a supernatural portrayal of divinity are certain types of Christian and Buddhist art in which various other iconographical devices are employed to suggest the supernal nature of the divinity. Again, one of the more striking ex- amples may be found at the great monastic site of Bamiyan. 37 S.

Sekino, Buddhist Monuments in China (Tokyo, 1925), P1. 41; Matsumoto, op. cit., pp. 313-14; and A. Getty, Gods of Northern Buddhism (London, 1928), p. 73. There is some question in my mind as to the validity of Matsumoto's identification since not only is there an inscription of the year 489 A.D. (Tokiwa and Sekino, op. cit., II, 54-55) with a specific reference to a dedica- tion of a group of Buddha and Prabhftaratna and a Maitreya trinity, but also there are on the walls of the cave repeated representations of the two Buddhas in conversation, a factor which might lead one to suppose-as did Sekino-that the whole cave is an illustration of the Lotus Sutra. It is equally possible that private dedications such as these may have been completely independent of the main image-even inspired by a different scripture. 40 In this connection, I quote Ch'ang Min on the two colossi of Vairocana at Bisakka (Ayodhya?): "Among the gods there is none greater than the Buddha" (H5obgirin, III [Paris, 1937], 213a). 23</page><page sequence="16">Religious Art East and West Group E is the designation given a small complex of caves about a hundred yards to the west of the smaller colossal Buddha at Bamiyan (Fig. 4). The only surviving painted decoration in these caves is a bodhisattva painted on the soffit of the niche that shelters the smallest statue of a seated Buddha at Bamiyan. The divinity is ensconced under a blunted pediment and wearing a costume that recalls the dress of the Gandhara bodhisattvas. The right hand is raised in vitarka mudrd. A necklace and heavy scarves are the only ornaments of the upper part of the body. In the headdress are fluttering ribbons conventionalized in the shape of French horns. The bodhisattva is represented seated on a rainbow of seven colors that at the same time serves as the aureole of the sculptured figure below it. This conception is strangely suggestive of the vision of the Apocalyptic Christ seated on the rainbow above the firmament.41 In St. John's descrip- tion, the rainbow is a familiar natural phenomenon employed in the mystic's vocabulary to suggest more tangibly the transcendent beauty of the Lord, and by its position spanning the heavens to place the pantocrator vividly above the sky42 beyond the world. Besides its appropriateness as a glory or throne, the rainbow is probably intended as a symbol of the Lord's mercy, an allusion to his compact of Gen. 9:13-17. A painting of the Last Judgment from the circle of Guido da Siena in the Church of the Misericordia at Grosseto (Fig. 5) is illuminating with regard to the function of the rainbow in the iconography of the Revelation: the Pantocrator is seated on an arc of spectral colors that 41 Rev. 4:3: "And there was a rainbow round about the throne in sight like unto an emerald." Cf. also the Vision of Ezekiel (Ezek. 1:26): "And above the firmament was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire-stone: and upon the likeness of a throne was the likeness of the glory of the Lord." 42 Matt. 5:24: "Coelum thronus Dei est"; Isa. 66:1: "Coelum sedes mea, terra autem scarbellum pedum meorum"; Ps. 88:30, 37: "Thronus eius sicut Deis Coeli; thronus eius sicut sol." P. Mus, op. cit., p. 587. The idea of a rainbow nimbus is suggested in description of the final attainment of enlightenment in the Nidanakatha: in this text the Buddha is said to have emitted six rays from his person like "A blue cloud, the rock-rose, a white robe, a red garland, and a pillar of light" (R. S. Hardy, Manual of Buddhism [London, 1860], pp. 179-80). Bigandet (The Life or Legend of Gautama, the Buddha of the Burmans [Rangoon, 1866]) speaks of these rays as brown, gold, purple, white, red, and crystal in color. H. C. Warren (Buddhism in Translation [Cambridge, 1906], HOS, III, p. 92): "The Rays of six different colours which is- sued from his body race hither and thither over places and pagodas, and deck them, as it were, with the yellow sheen of gold, or with the colours of a painting." The multicolored nimbus is, of course, a translation of these rays into pictorial terms (see also T. W. Rhys-Davids, Buddhist Birth Stories, I [London, 1880], 125: "A halo resplendent with many colours, proceeding to a fathom's length all around his [The Buddha's] person"). 24</page><page sequence="17">FIG. 4.-Buddha Maitreya, Group E, Bamiyan, Afghanistan, ca. fifth century A.D.</page><page sequence="18">FIG. 5.-Guido da Siena, Last Judgment, Grosseto</page><page sequence="19">bisects his enframing mandorla; another smaller rainbow serves as a footstool, and below this is the Cross supported by angels, rising like the cosmic tree to the top of the sky43 and suggestive of Christ's earthly body and sufferings, as the Buddha in the niche may be the nirmdnskdya of the vision above. Anyone looking at the Grosseto icon would have been reminded that Christ by his cross brought peace as the rainbow symbolized the peace of the cosmic forces. Although no such allusion to a covenant with the deity is implied in the Buddhist painting, the rainbow still fulfils the function of suggesting a being raised above the world by the heavenly arc with a like implication of transcendence over the cosmos. In Buddhist iconography, the aureoles of rainbow hue are probably to be taken as standing for the magic rays of varicolored light of "precious substances" that the Buddhas emanate from their persons. A suggestion of the possible symbolical significance of the nimbus that forms the seat of our bodhisattva is contained in the opening of the eleventh chapter of the Saddharma Pundarika: "then there arose a Stfpa, consisting of seven precious substances, from the place of the earth opposite the Lord, the assembly being in the middle, a Stuipa five hundred yojanas in height and proportionate in circumference."44 Kern in his note explains this phenomenon as follows: "between the Lord and (the Sun) is the stapa of seven ratnas," that is, the rainbow of seven colors.45 He goes on to say that there are in Indian ideology either five or seven colors (RV, pancarasmi and saptarafmi) and that just as there exists a parallelism between the five colors and five 43 The Cross as a symbol of the cosmic axis as well as the cardinal points is an ancient one and has been treated in extenso by R. Guenon, Le Symbolisme de la Croix (Paris, 1931). 44 H. Kern, "The Saddharma Pundarika," Sacred Books of the East, XXI, 227. The body halo or aureole is not peculiar to Buddhism and Christianity but goes back to Mesopotamian prototypes. In the pre-Buddhist period, there is, e.g., the Prabhamandala of Narayana (E. Burnouf, La Lotus de la Bonne Loi [Paris, 1852], p. 59). Unlike the usnisa, the halo is visible to mortals: it might from the frequency with which it is mentioned in the text be regarded as one of the laksanas of a great man. Senart (op. cit., p. 114) quotes the Mahabharata (XII, 12304 xx ff.) in which the Prabhamandaladuradrisah renders Purusa invisible to Ekata, Dvita, and Frita, who had come to Svetadipa to see him. 46 Kern, op. cit., p. 227, n. 1. In connection with this sky-filling wonder-a sort of nimbus-I quote Coomaraswamy: "The word 'nimbus' cognated with 'nebula' is the etymological equivalent of Skr. nabhas (mist, cloud, sky) and Hittite nebis (sky)" (Coomaraswamy, "Usnisa and Chattra," op. cit., p. 6, n. 2). Putting it very briefly indeed, there appears to be a relation between this vision and the ancient Indian concept of the sun (here the Buddha) supporting the sky. Tiered ziggurut, or magic stipa are, of course, cognates and are to be thought of in relation to "axis" which either as a pole or as cosmic man holds up the sky. 25</page><page sequence="20">Religious Art East and West planets,46 there should be a like parallelism between the ratnas, seven colors and the seven grihas or stellar mansions.47 A more pertinent Christian interpretation of this ancient stellar symbolism is expressly stated by John (Rev. 1:20): "As for the mys- tery of the seven stars that thou seest in my right hand, and the seven golden lamp-stands-the seven stars are the seven angels of the seven churches, and the seven lamp-stands are the seven churches." In other words, the ancient astronomical symbolism has been swept away in favor of a symbolism understandable to the evan- gelist's contemporaries. The bodhisattva at Bamiyan is dressed in the turban-crown and jewels of a Royal Buddha: the position of this deity seated on the rain- bow suggests that he may be intended as the Sambhogakdya in the skies in relation to the earthly teacher, Nirmdnakdya of Buddha, personified in the ruined statue below. Such an arrangement would be analogous to the Paradise pictures of Tun-huang in which Sakyamuni in the center preaches of the Buddha Amitabha who appears as a tiny vision at the top of the sky,48 it is Sakyamuni in his transcendental aspect who introduces mortals to the happy land in the West. This is the Buddhist equivalent of the Christ of the dictum in the Fourth Gospel, "Nemo venit ad patrem nisi per me." THE ARCHITECTURE OF PARADISE IN BUDDHIST AND CHRISTIAN ART A final and somewhat more complex example of the iconographical relations between Christianity and Buddhism may be examined in the artistic device known as the homme-arcade motif, the use of an archi- tectural setting-a colonnade-to frame divine personages for icono- graphical as well as artistic reasons. Here again the comparisons will be between examples from Gandhara and early Christian art (Figs. 6 and 7). From what we know of the movement of artistic influences in the 46 This is, of course, a spatio-temporal concept including a color, a jewel, and a planet for each of the five directions which, as Mus has so admirably demonstrated, is portrayed in the Sarnath column and goes back to Mesopotamian antecedents. The Mahayana Buddhist idea of the Five Dhyani Buddhas or the Five Jinas, each associated with one of the directions and the zenith, is directly evolved from this. In Japanese mandalas, the Bodhisattva Vajrasattva (Jap. Kongo-satta Bosatsu) is sometimes given a nimbus of five colors to signify that this deity is a magic entity comprising the five elements, the five colors, as well as the five Dhyani Buddhas (Cf. A. Getty, The Gods of Northern Buddhism [London, 1928], p. 29). 47 Kern, op. cit., p. 227, n. 3. Cf. the Seven Lamps of the Apocalyptic vision and the Seven Altars of Mithraic legend which are both parallels of the seven planets (Saxl, Mithras, p. 97). One might be justified in discerning a further paral- lel in these Seven Lamps which are the Seven Spirits of God and the Seven Jewels. 48 Mus, "Le Bouddha Par6," Bulletin de l'ecolefrangaise d'Extreme-Orient, 1928, pp. 222-27, 245. 26</page><page sequence="21">FIG. 6.-Christ and the Apostles, early Christian, fourth century A.D., Musee Lapidaire, Aries</page><page sequence="22">FIG. 7.-Buddhas in Arcades of Stapa, third century A.D., Hadda, Afghanistan</page><page sequence="23">late Antique world, it is unlikely that the arcade-and-figure motif originated in Gandhara and spread from there to the West. The synthetic character of art in the twilight of the classic world is such that probably the truth lies in all the proposed explanations for the appearance of the concept in India; that is, it is derived ultimately from the fa(ades with engaged orders in the Roman world, and more specifically from the form as developed on early Christian sarcophagi through the collaboration of Syrian workmen, who, as will be explained below, saw the appropriateness of this funerary architecture to the needs of the Buddhist church of Gandhara. Since the developed form of the homme-arcade is unknown before the Asiatic sarcophagi of the late second century A.D., it would be impossible to suppose that any occurrence of the type in Gandhara is prior to this date. In studying the photographs of the Gandhara stupas with their multiple images of Buddhas under arcades we are faced with another problem of an iconographical nature. It is not without importance for the stylistic aspects of the question: anyone seriously investigating the religious art of the East is bound to ask himself first of all whether the work of art he is examining was made for the expression of a definite concept that determined its form. In this case, one is bound to ask whether the repeated figures of the Buddha, each one nearly identical to its neighbor, were made as parts of a whole representing the miraculous appearance of the Buddha in many places at one time, as in the Great Miracle of Sravasti and in the transcendental sections of the Lotus Sutra (Saddharma Pundarzka), or whether these are mere- ly repeated effigies of Sakyamuni duplicated for the merit believed to accrue from the making of statues of the Great Teacher. From what we know of Buddhism in Gandhara there is little evidence that the sculpture of this region was dedicated to Mahayana Buddhism: the only bodhisattva recognizable in Gandhara art is Maitreya; insofar as we know, the mystic Buddhas of Mahayana are unknown, and only Sakyamuni and his mortal predecessors, the manusi Buddhas, are carved in the sanctuaries of northwestern India. More often than not, the number of statues seems determined solely by the dimensions of the space to be filled, but since the individual figures are differen- tiated from one another, it may be that they are either Sakyamuni at various moments of his career, or Sakyamuni and the Buddhas of the Past who were worshipped in Gandhara. The story related by Hsiian-tsang about the double-bodied Buddha at the great stapa of Kanishka at Peshawar furnishes us a clue to the significance of Buddha images on the stupas: in this legend two men each engaged an artist to paint a picture of the Enlightened One; 27</page><page sequence="24">Religious Art East and West when they came to pay their respects to the icons they had ordered, the two patrons were disappointed to find only one painting of the Buddha.49 At the artist's insistence that he had not defrauded them and that the picture would give some "spiritual indication" of this, the Painted Buddha divided in two from the waist upward, and the two men "believed and exulted."50 It is specifically implied in this passage that each man wished to have his own picture of the Buddha; in other words, we might well be justified in assuming that the multiple statues of Buddhas on the monuments at Taxila and Hadda are in- dividual donations, or, at least, different likenesses of the same Buddha. In the photograph of the Ali-Masjid stupa one can make out statues of Buddhas and bodhisattvas of various types: it is tempt- ing to think of these as different deities or different aspects of the same deity each in its separate niche like the chapels dedicated to various saints or types of Christ in the ambulatory of a great cathedral. One could see in this repetition of the Buddha images on all four sides of the stupas the germ of the idea embodied in the four-faced statues of Lokesvara at Angkor which are not four-headed monsters but one deity both seen and seeing everywhere at once.51 The multiple Buddha images could be interpreted as representing not many different Bud- dhas but one Buddha seen everywhere and simultaneously. I have already suggested that the homme-arcade, a motif universally employed for sepulchral monuments in the West, was for this reason found appropriate for the decoration of reliquaries and stapas which can be regarded as funerary in function. Diitschke in his brilliant chapter on the significance of the columnar sarcophagi in pagan and Christian art has suggested that, first and foremost, the pagan sarcophagus was the House of the Dead: it was also a representation of the Palace of Hades as abode of the shades.52 In Christian art the Palace of Hades is converted into the Halls of Heaven or the Heavenly Jerusalem: Christ and the elect emerge from the colonnade that had formerly sheltered Apollo and the Muses as companions of the departed.53 What could be more appropriate for a sepulchral monument than the representation of the Celestial City where the soul hoped to dwell in peace with the Savior? In the same 49 Beal, op. cit., p. 102. 60 For an account of representations of this renowned image and later copies of it, see Matsumoto, op. cit., pp. 317 ff. 61 Cf. Mus, "Has Brahma Four Faces?"

The nearest textual confirmation to the suggestion that the revetment of the stupa was in a sense a vision of celestial architecture is contained in the description of the building of the Lohapasada in the Ma- havamsa.56 The significance of this seeming digression is that with the accept- ance of the homme-arcade as a means of representing the architecture of Paradise it seems not at all unlikely, but indeed very probable, that the form was adopted for Buddhist usage to represent the realms of the Buddhas. In earlier Indian art, as, for example, on the east gate at Sanci, the palaces of the devas are represented as columnar halls probably drawn from contemporary architecture; such a conception of the Buddhist Heaven recurs in the sixth-century fresco of Buddha in the Tusita Heaven in Cave 2 at Ajanta.67 In this regard, it is inter- esting to note that we may identify the three central figures of the Bimaran reliquary as a representation of the descent of Sakyamuni from the Tusita Heaven.58 The multiple images of Buddhas on the stupas of Gandhara, then, could be explained as representing the Buddha and the Buddhas of other kalpas enshrined in the golden halls of their heavens: the substitution of classical architectural forms being made the easier by the fact that Indian architectural forms had already been used for paradisiacal settings in earlier Indian art. The fact that the homme-arcade was specifically used to depict the architec- ture of the celestial regions in the West would only make it more ac- ceptable to the Buddhists of Gandhara who always showed themselves open to borrowing ready-made classical types and techniques of all 64 Ibid., pp. 137 ff., 142, passim. 65 See "The Maha-Sudassana Suttanta," Sacred Books of the East, xl (Oxford, 1881), pp. 265 ff. 66 W.

Foucher, L'Art Greco-Bouddhique du Gandhara, I (Paris, 1905), pp. 537-39. 29</page><page sequence="26">Religious Art East and West sorts for the realization of their iconographical ideas. The concept of the Buddhas in their heavens as a decoration for the exterior of the stapa is not in the least incompatible with the essential meaning of these monuments as symbols of the universe.9 The hypothesis be- comes even more convincing when we recall that although the arcade undergoes a considerable transformation-into Indian terms-it is still employed to shelter the Buddhas of the Four Directions whose multiple images once crowded the niches of the Mahabodhi temple at Gaya and the many copies of that memorial in the Eastern world.60 Again, single images of Buddhas, either of the Four Buddhas of the Past or the Four Mystic Buddhas, were often placed at the four sides of stapa bases to symbolize the paradises of these Tathagatas at the four points of the compass.6' The Buddhas on the stapas of Gandhara, sitting or standing in a palatial architectural setting of mixed classical and Indian form, could then be said to be a primitive form of the Paradise iconography, a concept exactly paralleling the prototype of the Heavenly Jerusalem as symbolized by the arcades of the early Christian sarcophagi. CONCLUSION In conclusion, it should be emphasized that, in the examples of reli- gious art we have examined, traditions of the most ancient cosmolo- gies known to man, traditions of magic, craft, and ritual-which, although no longer completely understood in later periods, still de- termined the forms proper to religious concepts-from the orientation of the temple to the least of the symbols decorating the footprints of Buddha. For the centuries of faith these remain in a way apart from change except insofar as they are variously interpreted in the stylistic form language accidental to different places and periods. This latter problem is a separate one which is no less significant in weighing the- for us-final value of the icon in the history of art. This problem is separate and different because such "aesthetic" or antiquarian considerations never entered the mind of a craftsman working in a tradition before the rise of the individual "artist" in the modern sense of the term. In the great periods of Asiatic art, before the breakdown of tradition in craft and religion, the geometry of the images of Buddha, the particular concepts that necessitated their 69 Mus, Barabudur, pp. 195 ff. 60 B. Rowland, Jr., "A Miniature Replica of the Mahabodhi Temple," Journal of the Indian Society of Oriental Art, 1938, p. 73, P1. 23. 61 Cf. T. Naito, "Jodai toba shiho shibutsu no seiritsu katei ni tsuite," Toyo Bijutsu, December, 1931, pp. 1-12. 30</page><page sequence="27">particular form, the method and purpose of making and worshipping icons remained very much the same as did the technical training and spiritual approach of the actual craftsman. In later periods the pri- mordial secrets of the time-and-space mechanism of the cosmos, the reasons for the images being as they were-abstract and beyond nature-were remembered only dimly by the majority or else they were repeated only as formulas not truly understood; but even in later centuries in India, China, and Japan there were men by whom the ancient mysteries were still understood in all the awful clarity of their original meaning, and to these the survival of the ancient tradi- tions is due. In periods like our own time when tradition is almost synonymous with superstition, such concepts as the Tree of Life sug- gest only a design in a modern "Numdah" rug, and no explanation beyond technical inadequacy is deemed necessary for the attenuated proportions of the early icons of Christ and Buddha. In the period with which we are concerned, enough of these traditions were still alive all over Asia to account for the seeming identity in "style"-the identity is really as much in "content." It must be pointed out that, in Asiatic art, comparisons of details according to the systems of modern scientific art history, although revealing to a certain degree, are actually useless and beside the point in such a unified, traditional art as that of Asia in which the artist never emerges completely as an individual, but is dedicated to expressing communal ideas, not his own personality. The language of his expression is based on certain forms which, by common consent through generations of artistic practice, have been conceived as proper to revealing the essential nature of the divinities for the edification of the believers. The like- nesses and differences in physical type in such things as detail in orna- ments are due to racial likenesses and differences and ideals which are beyond the control even of traditional iconography or what the art historian is pleased to call influences. As Langdon Warner has so well expressed it: "Dealing directly with the artist's Formal Cause and original conception is quite apart from dealing with influences, where the artist either copies externals or is so close in the grip of his tradi- tion that his spiritual stimulus is controlled by traditional shapes. The critic's difficulty is that he often has to deal with material pro- duced under mixed conditions: direct original imagination clothed in traditional shapes." A valuable lesson in what influences really are can be learned in studying the vicissitudes of the Udayana Buddha type. The famous sandalwood image was, according to legend, made in the lifetime of Sakyamuni for the king of Udayana. The original Udayana Buddha 31</page><page sequence="28">Religious Art East and West in art was, judging from existing copies, an image of the Gandhara school which the latter adopted as the legendary effigy of Sakyamuni. The story has the earmarks of a pious fabrication designed to popular- ize and to justify the worship of the first and very foreign images of Buddha with the "rippling" folds of their Roman togas. Copies were known in China in Hsiian-tsang's time and continued to be made in Japan through the Kamakura Period; the type survives in Tibet and Nepal to the present day. On the grossly humanistic concept of the Gandhiran original, the artist of the dark and mystic figure that we see today in the shrine at Seiryoji has produced something abstract and enormously ghostly. The general lines of the robe of a Gandhara image are there; we recognize them as superficially related, but in the Japanese statue the folds are worked into rhythms that greatly ag- grandize the figure and convey the feeling of the universal character of drapery structure-not the particular attempt to show the surface appearance of a special robe. In the same way the formalization of the realism of the Roman dress in the early Christian images of Christ and the reduction of the sensuous beauty of the Apollo head to a bland mask of serenity in these and the Gandhara Buddhas impart a ghostly character that was not present in the humanistic originals. Finally, it must be emphasized that no matter how large the stylis- tic factor may loom in such problems of art history, more significant still in traditional art is the concept that determined the form: in tracing down the history of the content and in analyzing it we shall come closer to truth than in a pursuit of such will-o'-the-wisps as "influences" so often turn out to be. In the origin of the dominating idea we shall find in part the explanation of the form as well. That biological expansion of the cosmos described with both faith and the authority of science by Pere Teilhard is only an ordering of concepts of the metaphysical structure of the universe embodied in the texts of and iconography of mystical Buddhism: that world tree whose branches flower into space, towering upward to infinity to bear us all at last to our astral home, is a scientifically explained miracle em- bodied in the ancient ideas of the world-axis, of Yggdrasil, and the all-embracing cosmic person who is at once Christ and Buddha. 32</page></plain_text>
