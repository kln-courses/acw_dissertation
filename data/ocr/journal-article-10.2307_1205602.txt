<plain_text><page sequence="1">God the "Stone/Rock": Myth, Idolatry, and Cultic Fetishism in Ancient Israel* Ithamar Gruenwald / Tel Aviv University I One of the peculiar features of the divine nomenclature in Scripture is that it occasionally engages the semantic field of Stone-Rock-Mountain- Place. Among these names, those of tsur (or sel'a), "rock," and even, "stone," occupy a unique position. Notable examples include "The Rock, his work is perfect; for all his ways are justice" (Deut. 32:4); "then he forsook God who made him, and scoffed at the Rock of his salvation" (Deut. 32:15); "How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thou- sand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and the Lord had given them up? For their rock is not as our Rock" (Deut. 32:30-31); "For who is God, but the Lord? And who is a rock, except our God" (2 Sam. 22:32). In a more evocative context we find: "The Lord is my rock, and my for- tress, and my deliverer, my God, my rock, in whom I take refuge" (2 Sam. 22:2-3; Ps. 18:2); "Yea, thou art my rock and my fortress" (Ps. 31:3; 71:3); "I say to God, my rock" (Ps. 42:10 [9]).' * This article is part of a larger project in which the nature of Jewish religiousness in biblical and postbiblical times will be studied and extensively discussed. Special attention will be given in it to matters relating the assessment of mythic language. As will be made clear in the course of this article, these subjects belong to an area of studies in which the nature of religious language as "second language" or "a language within a language" is taken up. Previous versions of this article were read as lectures at New York University and the Divinity School at the University of Chicago. Many people offered their kind help in addressing questions and in making useful suggestions. Among them I would like to single out Professors H. D. Betz and Michael Fishbane of the Divinity School at the University of Chicago. Two earlier versions of this paper were read by Professor Simo Parpola, the Uni- versity of Helsinki, who encouraged me at a time when I most needed his critical observa- tions. This is also the place to thank Professor W. Clark Gilpin, dean of the Divinity School, and Professor Frank E. Reynolds, program director of the Institute for the Advanced Study of Religion-both of the University of Chicago-for their kind hospitality. Professor Josef Stern, the Department of Philosophy, the University of Chicago, took great interest in this article in the final stages of its composition and provided a few helpful comments.

However, since in some of the cases the word "rock" is used synonymously with "fortress" and "deliverer," the reader may be induced to think that "rock" should be understood as a simile and not as one of the proper names of God. This article will discuss the various interpretative options that such nomenclature implies and their signifi- cance for the study of the history of religions, in general, and that of the religion of Ancient Israel, in particular. Similarly, we find that God is referred to, though less frequently, as "stone": "by the name of the Shepherd, the Stone [Hebrew: even] of Is- rael" (Gen. 49:24); "The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner" (Ps. 118:22).3 The implied difference between "rock" and "stone" is of no substantial consequence: the two terms belong to the same semantic field. Thus, in whatever context and mode of inter- pretation they appear, they share a similar notional framework. Admit- tedly, as indicated above, if we view them from a frequently maintained interpretive perspective, the cases under discussion may indeed imply what may be referred to as metaphorical notions. Accordingly, a certain quality of the divine may be implied by those terms, but not God's actual name or his real essence or being. In fact, a first reading of most of these verses is likely to take into con- sideration established reading habits. Accordingly, nothing could be more natural than maintaining in these cases the relevance of a metaphorical reading. Furthermore, a literal understanding of these names, according to which God really is a "rock" or "stone," is viewed as running counter to customarily maintained theological beliefs and assumptions. These hold fast to the basic concept according to which Scripture unambigu- ously maintains antimythic and antifetishist positions.4 However, what in the eyes of many looks like an inevitable assumption, and for that matter the only possible interpretative option, constitutes in our eyes a herme- neutical problem deserving serious consideration.5 This article, then, deals with a number of key issues in the study of 2See, e.g., Deut. 32:15, 30-31. 3 The meaning of this particular verse from the Book of Psalms is not indisputable. How- ever, the immediate context-the neighboring verses-speak about God. A messianic inter- pretation is suggested in a saying attributed to Jesus as quoted in Matt. 21:42. 4 See, e.g., Deut. 4:16-18, 5:7-8, 12:3. See, further, Moshe Weinfeld, Deuteronomy 1-11 (the Anchor Bible) (New York: Doubleday, 1992), pp. 289 ff. 5 It is worth comparing the position taken here with that of Arthur Marmorstein, The Old Rabbinic Doctrine of God (London: Oxford University Press, 1927). 429</page><page sequence="3">The Journal of Religion religious expression and language. More specifically, it deals with mythic language in Hebrew Scripture. As we shall see, mythic language consti- tutes a special type of language that uses ordinary language to refer to supernatural realms in intensely anthropomorphic terms. If we assume that it addresses issues relating a special, paranatural (or supernatural) nature, it actually constitutes "a language within a language." In many ways, mythic language is the basic language of religion. How- ever, it is often assumed that the "monotheistic religions" are diametri- cally opposed to anything that hints of myth or mythopoesis. We should make clear that we distinguish between mythological materials-rem- nants of which may be found in Scripture, Jewish and Christian alike- and mythic language and mythic forms of conceptualizing religious expe- rience and perception. The latter are the subject of this article. As we shall see, this assumption about myth and "monotheistic religions" requires modification. Briefly stated, myth and mythopoesis occupy a central posi- tion at the heart of religion in general. In this respect, the "monotheistic religions" are no exception to the rule.6 Thus, mythic modes of expres- sion are paradigmatic: they set the quality, nature, and framework of reli- gious language in general. They likewise make evident the most adequate forms for the study of religious language. It is commonly assumed that mythic forms of expression are fictional and cast in poetic form. When used in a poetic context, objects usually take on personified dimensions. On theological grounds, then, it is often assumed that such forms of ex- pression require special hermeneutical decoding. However, since the bor- derlines of hermeneutical decoding are not set by the text itself, the ques- tion arises, What are the limits of such a decoding, and in whose hands should their setting be entrusted? In the history of Jewish and Christian exegesis of Scripture we often find that allegory dominates the interpretative scene. Words and notions are relegated to other spheres of signification, mostly those that can be accounted for on rational, or rationalistic, grounds. However, allegory should not be viewed in the narrow context of a tactical solution. It often becomes an exegetical strategy that addresses matters of conceptual sub- stance. Allegory often sets the contents of religious belief. In any event, it 6 In this respect, the work ofY. Kaufmann played a most influential role, particularly on the Israeli scholarly scene. Kaufmann's contributions to modern biblical scholarship are still very much "in the air," but in recent years a growing amount of criticism is accumulating demanding a substantial revision of Kaufmann's positions. Eventually that criticism will change the scholarly scene, even where it has not yet succeeded in doing so. It should, however, be remarked that, in stating his positions, e.g., in questions relating to myth and the Ancient Israelite attitude toward Canaanite idolatry, Kaufmann was remarkably careful to use nuanced, and hence dialectical, formulations. Most of Kaufmann's studies were pub- lished in Hebrew. 430</page><page sequence="4">God the "Stone/Rock" forces on the text something that comes from without, something that is not intrinsically implied by the text in question. It is not dictated by the objectively formulated needs of the text from "within." In the context of the present discussion, allegory will be viewed as tantamount to a meta- phorical interpretation of Scripture. It is applied to help certain people read Scripture in a way that removes for them interpretative obstacles that, to the best of their theological perception, cannot be found in the text. With the passage of time, certain modes of interpretation become so deeply embedded in the general reading experience and habits of the readers that these modes, and their underlying interpretative assump- tions, are viewed as intrinsically implied by the text itself. What is even more interesting to note from our point of view is the fact that certain interpretative habits that have crystallized in a theological milieu are taken over by scholars for whom rationalism is the sine qua non of their interpretative stances. For instance, many people would still find it diffi- cult to accept another interpretation of the word bara--"created," in Gen. 1:1--than the one suggesting the notion of creatio ex nihilo. It is indeed difficult, even for a modern reader of Scripture, to think of the verb bara in terms that are different from the usually accepted notion of a spiritual, rather than mythical, creation. As we shall see, a similar problem exists with regard to those utterances in Scripture in which God is spoken of in terms such as "stone" and "rock." People would indeed find it difficult to read these words in terms different from their usually accepted metaphorical meaning. Here, once again, an interpretative tradition has established itself in the context of which all utterances implying cultic fetishism and corporeal anthropo- morphism are explained away as similes and metaphors. On a general hermeneutic level, then, this article deals with the prob- lems that arise when people assume that a certain type of biblical lan- guage necessarily requires a theological or rationalistic transposition. If the metaphorical interpretation of Scripture is not made the order of the day, new options are opened for a better understanding of the nature of biblical religion and language. In dealing with religious language and expression, one touches upon questions that do not necessarily belong to the area of literary criticism. They concern the very essence of religious language as such, and in this respect they require separate methodologi- cal attention. Newly discovered materials, as well as improved editions of ones already known, are constantly being published in great quantities and make it 431</page><page sequence="5">The Journal of Religion clear that those sections in the Hebrew Scriptures that appear to propa- gate the purist's notion of religious monotheism and its consequent cul- tural separatism have to be read in a different light. Actually, our overall picture of the scriptural world has to be modified in a substantial manner. Parts of this modification, as well as some of its more important conse- quences, will be discussed here. In this respect, questions relating to the very identification of what are assumed to be coded forms of expression and their respective deci- phering occupy a central position. The question is always an open one: how are we to identify religious codes? What is a code, and on what grounds are we entitled to assume that what seems to be the simple and plain language of Scripture potentially carries coded messages? When can we treat words as if they are dressed in a metaphorical garb, and when should we stick to reading them in their downright and unimpeded lexical immediacy? The answers to these questions are not as easy as one could wish. As we shall see, different views hold equal rights to interpreta- tive validity. The act of interpretation easily reaches slippery ground. For it has long been recognized that the truth of any interpretation is more often than not configured as the self-projected identity of a personally engaged reader. If this is the case, subjective considerations always play a major role in the choice of the interpretative options. However, I believe that scholars should be exempted from the task of having to upgrade seemingly ambiguous texts to the status of theological formulations that are dictated by rationalistic considerations. For schol- ars, metaphorical modes of interpretation should not be seen as the es- cape exit when the theological roof is in flames. There are no self-evident interpretative principles on the basis of which texts have to be read meta- phorically. As a matter of common practice, texts should be allowed to address us in their unimpeded lexical immediacy. In any event, we should be alert to the fact that interpretation all too easily becomes hyper- interpretation. In other words, when used as a maximizing rhetorical device, meta- phoricism, as a hermeneutic principle, is very likely to do the opposite of what is expected. Instead of making us hear the voice of the text in all its clarity, it may critically distort the issues involved. The extensive discus- sion of theoretical issues, therefore, has one purpose: to make us aware of the fact that what we establish in biblical theology is very much depen- dent on the kind of hermeneutical activity we are engaged in. The answer to the question, How did the Ancient Israelites conceive of their God? depends on how we read the relevant scriptural texts. That is to say, what matters most in the framing of our conceptual world is the kind of inter- pretation we bring to the texts in question. 432</page><page sequence="6">God the "Stone/Rock" But there is more to our subject than just the formal question of inter- pretative metaphoricism. It has become a theological commonplace in Judaism (and also in some sectors of Islam and Christianity) that almost every name attributed to God is considered a metaphor. God's essence is above and beyond every form of human conceptualization, cognition, and expression. This, so the line of theological argumentation goes, turns every name or attribute of God into a metaphor. "Metaphor" here means any form of expression that is attributed to God without implying any- thing essential. In discussing the framework in which these terms were interpreted in the past, attention should first be given to Maimonides. For it may well be argued that, at least in the framework of the Jewish tradition of inter- preting Scripture, Maimonides more than any other personality colored the hermeneutical scene and left there an indelible mark. Consequently, the metaphorical interpretation of Scripture has become almost the order of the day.7 This is what Maimonides says on some of the verses quoted above: "Rock [zur (tsur)] is an equivocal term.8... God, may He be exalted, is designated as the Rock, as He is the principle and the efficient cause of all things other than himself."9 With this kind of statement, the meta- phorical scene is clearly set. Maimonides goes on to say that what is im- plied in these verses is the notion that one should "rely upon, and be firm in considering God, may He be exalted, as the first principle. This is the entryway through which you shall come to Him, as we have made clear when speaking of His saying [to Moses]: Behold, there is a place by Me [where you shall stand upon the Rock]" (Exod. 33:21).10 The last verse was not included in the list quoted above, nor was the verse, "Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb" (Exod. 17:6), as these verses will receive special attention below. In dealing with the interpretative oeuvre of Maimonides, one has to 7 This is also true of those Jewish interpreters of Scripture who tried to introduce Mid- rashic and Qabbalistic notions into their commentaries. Here the name of Ramban, Rabbi Moshe ben Nahman, comes to mind in the first place. Ramban was one of the chief voices on the Jewish scene reacting against many of the Maimonidean presuppositions in the in- terpretation of Scripture. Nevertheless, even in his work, a substantial degree of metaphor- icism enters the interpretative scene. 8 That is, it belongs to the sphere of the "accidentals." For a good summary of the prob- lems involved in this subject, see Majid Fakhry, Islamic Occasionalism and Its Critique by Averroes and Aquinas (London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1958). 9 What Maimonides has in mind here is the Hebrew word for rock, zur, which is close to the root, yzr, to create or craft. 10 Maimonides, The Guide of the Perplexed, trans. Shlomo Pines (Chicago, 1963), pt. 1, chap. 16, p. 42. 433</page><page sequence="7">The Journal of Religion take into consideration the fact that for him the philosophical end justi- fied the interpretative means and result. As we shall immediately realize, Maimonides, like many other philosophers and commentators, preferred interpretative metaphoricism to any other way of reading problematic religious texts. Problems arose for him when, because of their anthropo- morphic or materially concrete language, texts spoke a philosophically redundant language. Originally, Maimonides explained, language had to be used to meet the needs of the uninformed audience of the time. In its original setting, that language indeed was mythical and anthropomor- phic. However, philosophers and correctly informed readers have more sophisticated agenda. As a result, they apply hermeneutical tools in which problematic expressions are explained as metaphors. In other words, the philosophical layer of meaning is decoded in the language used by Scripture. The hermeneutical presuppositions upon which Maimonides builds his interpretative oeuvre are defined in the first chapter of his magnum opus, Mishneh Torah: "The Torah speaks in the language of men. All these phrases" are metaphorical.... The term is used allegorically and all these phrases are to be understood in a similar sense."12 There is no need to enter into a full-scale discussion of Maimonides' interpretative stance here. Suffice it to repeat that since certain expressions in Scripture imply anthropomorphism in relation to God, they all demand a metaphorical transposition. In the eyes of Maimonides, and many who adopted his line of thinking, anthropomorphism was likely to breed the worst kind of idolatry, which in his eyes was conceptual or theological idolatry. In short, Maimonides represents a classical example of what may be called "meta- phorical reformatting," or interpretative metaphoricism. III To come back to the initial point, several of the scriptural quotes to which I referred at the beginning of this study occur in a poetic context. Thus, from a purely literary point of view they can easily be viewed as de- manding metaphorical interpretations.3 One does not have to heed phil- osophical concerns to indulge in metaphoricism. Metaphoricism indeed " That is, all the terms and scriptural utterances that speak of God in terms that allude to him as having human qualities. 12 Maimonides, The Book of Knowledge, trans. H. M. Russell and J. Weinberg (New York: Ktav, 1983), "Laws Concerning the Basic Principles of the Torah," chaps. 1, 9. '3 It is essential in this connection to distinguish between metaphors as conceived of in the mind of the original writer and metaphors that are the result, or actually the presuppo- sition, of the interpretative act. 434</page><page sequence="8">God the "Stone/Rock" has enriching potential. It opens up hermeneutical possibilities and en- riches the evocative potential of language, in general, and of the interpre- tation of texts, in particular. However, it should be made clear that, as a matter of interpretative principle, the metaphorical kind of interpreta- tion is not a logical conditio sine qua non. Its alleged conclusiveness cannot pass unchallenged. In this respect, we follow the midrashic way of ap- proaching scriptural texts. For, and this is the crucial point, we shall see that the rabbis did not always find it necessary to employ what may be called "metaphorical circumvention" in order to mitigate the rather be- wildering effect that certain expressions in Scripture might have left on certain readers. Although methodological observations take up much of the space here, my discussion is not taking issue with abstract questions alone. On the contrary, from a phenomenological point of view there is ample compara- tive material that should give rise to similar questions.'4 Stones and rocks are almost universally identified with cultic sites on which a great variety of rituals is enacted.'5 In some cases stones and rocks become the founda- tions of temples.'6 In any event, rocks and outstandingly shaped stones '4 In this connection mention should be made of Mircea Eliade, The Sacred and Profane: The Nature of Religion (San Diego: Harcourt Brace &amp; Co., 1959). Eliade refers to the concept of "hierophany," that is, "the manifestation of the sacred in some ordinary object, a stone or a tree" (p. 11). Eliade expresses the view that "a sacred stone remains a stone; apparently (or, more precisely, from the profane point of view) nothing distinguishes it from all other stones. But for those to whom a stone reveals itself as sacred, its immediate reality is trans- muted into a supernatural reality" (p. 12). It should be noted, though, that I go one step further than Eliade. For Eliade speaks about a sacred manifestation in material objects, whereas I refer to the identification of deities with stones. The difference between these two positions may seem too insignificant to dwell upon, but in my eyes it is substantial. '5 Stones and rocky structures are part of the cultic life of many religions. The compara- tive materials will be discussed below; however, by way of introduction, I mention here that in Islam the Ka'ba still functions as the central cult place. It is a large black stone. As already noted by Maimonides in Responsa (ed. Joshua Blau, 2:725-27 [the Responsum to 'Ovadia the proselyte]), its history goes back to pre-Islamic days, so also its cult(s). In the Koran, Sura 106, the Ka'ba is only briefly mentioned as "the House"; but in a later text, Sura 2 (115), the Ka'ba is mentioned in relation to Abraham as "the [praying] Place" of the Patri- arch. (The special meaning of the term "the place" will be discussed below.) Mention should also be made in this connection to the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem, which in some cases was declared a substitute for the pilgrimage to Mecca. Mircea Eliade, Myths, Rites, Symbols (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1976), 2:377 ff., links sacred stones with the Omphalos, the Naval of the Earth, and sacred mountains in general. See, further, Robert Graves and Ra- phael Patai, Hebrew Myths: The Book of Genesis (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1966), pp. 207-8, who point to the location of temples on mountain tops as also to the Matsebah, the sacred pillar or altar, which had to be avoided in the cult of the Israelites, and even destroyed along with other Canaanite cult objects; see Exod. 34:13; Deut. 12:3. If Frank Moore Cross, Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1973), pp. 52 ff., is right, then the Hebrew epithet for God, Shadday, means "the mountain of [God]." 16 This is the case with the even ha-shetiyah, placed in the Holy of Holies of the Jerusalem Temple. I shall discuss this issue in a longer, forthcoming version of this article. On stones 435</page><page sequence="9">The Journal of Religion are universally singled out as sacred sites in many parts of the world, including the Near East."7 Evidently, stone structures can inspire a sense of the "numinous."'8 The same holds true of rocky mountains, which are often described as sites upon which theophanies have taken place (e.g., Mount Sinai). Such mountains become the places on which temples are built (e.g., Mount Moriah), and in some cases they even bear the names of gods ("The Mountain of God": 2 Sam. 21:6, 9; Ps. 24:3).19 The question that needs be asked, then, is: Are these rocks, stones, and mountains only a dwelling place of the gods, or are they identical with them? Mountains and rocky sites in many cases bear the names of deities. "Sinai" may be understood as a divine name (Judg. 5:4-5; Ps. 68:9), as well as "Moriah" in relation to Adonai Yir'eh (Gen. 22:14). Beth-El, which is the place of the stone consecrated as an altar by Jacob (Gen. 28:18-19; see the discussion below), is another case of the same kind. Of particular interest in this respect is the divine name Har ha-Gadol (the Great Moun- tain) mentioned along with the term even ha-roshah (apparently the "head stone") in Zach. 4:7. We know that the term the "Great Mountain" is also a standard name of Enlil, head of the Sumerian pantheon, who was and temples, see also N. Na'aman, "Bethel and Bet-Aven: An Investigation into the Loca- tion of the Early Israelite Cult Places" (in Hebrew), ZION 50 (1985): 15-25 (this is the jubilee volume of the journal published by the Historical Society of Israel, Jerusalem, celebrating the years 1935-85). Na'aman collects interesting materials that are relevant to the discus- sion here, though his major purpose is to show that cult places "in Israel during the pre- monarchical and early-monarchical periods were built outside of their respective towns" (see the English summary, pp. viii-ix). Notice should be taken, too, of Na'aman's argument to the effect that "Beth-aben [mentioned seven times in Scripture] ('House of the Stone Pil- lar') was the original name of Bethel's early sanctuary.... The name Beth-aven ('House of Wickedness') was developed by the prophets of the eighth century B.C.E. as a pejorative substitute for Bethel and its sanctuary" (p. viii). A line of thinking that has still to be ex- plored is connected with the Sanctuary-Temple topos in the Hebrew Scripture. It is very often argued that the scriptural narratives about the Sanctuary built by Moses in the desert should be viewed as a polemical statement against the Stone-Temple built by King Solomon. 17 In Eretz Yisrael such stones were found at Gezer. See M. D. Coogan, "10 Great Finds," Biblical Archaeologist 21 (1995): 40. Famous, too, are the "stones" at Stonehenge, Wiltshire, England, and the stone formations, called "Lord and Madam Mayor," in the Adrshpach Rock Hills in the Czech Republic. Those who travel in the state of Arizona cannot avoid noticing the endless and different stone formations there. Doubtlessly, all these formations originally served cultic purposes. See also the materials surveyed in Fredric Lehrman, The Sacred Landscape (Berkeley: Celestial Arts, 1988). In this connection, mention should be made of the name "ha-Even ha-Gedolah" (the Great Stone) given to the Bamah at Giv'on (2 Sam. 20:8). '8 Such a "numinous" feeling is certainly inspired on visiting, e.g., Temppeliaukio Church in Helsinki, Finland. This church is cut and built into a granite rock hill. Its walls actually are the roughly cut colored rocks of the place. 19 In the eyes of Nepalese Buddhism, the Himalayas are the abode (alaya) of the Snow- God Hima. On the whole, there is a vast scholarly literature on this subject as it appears in many cultures and religions. 436</page><page sequence="10">God the "Stone/Rock" equated with ASsur.20 Thus, it appears that one is justified in identifying these objects with the gods themselves. I have already referred to the fact that stones found in cultic places are likely to be treated as the foundation of the world, the axis mundi, or the navel of the world.2" In this connection, they may have a phallic-that is, sexually creative-function, too.22 It may not be insignificant to notice that in Hebrew words for "rock" and "stone," respectively, belong to dif- ferent genders: zur or tsur ("rock") is masculine, while even ("stone") is feminine. Stones are often considered as the birthplace of gods and spe- cial heroes: Mithraism is a notable example.23 I should also mention that Abraham is called tsur in his capacity as the patriarchal forefather of the Israelites (Isa. 51:1-2). In this connection we should also be reminded of the words of John the Baptist: "God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham" (Matt. 3:9; Luke 3:8). God himself, called tsur ("rock") is mentioned as the forgotten "Father" of the Israelites (Deut. 32:18). In short, the comparative study of "stone/rock" imagery leads into semantic territories that substantially transform the way in which the cor- responding material in Scripture should be read. Interesting as this comparative material is in itself, it also shows that the metaphorical interpretation is not as inevitable and self-sustained as it often appears to be. Phenomenologically speaking, the exclusivity of this approach can no longer be sustained or justified. Contrary to what established itself as a rationalistic way of reading Scripture, we may now adapt a more open, that is, mythic way of reading it. Many people in the 20 This information was kindly passed on to me by Professor Simo Parpola. For recently published references, see James B. Pritchard, Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament, 3d ed. (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1969), p. 574, lines 35-40: "In the city, the holy seat of Enlil, / In Nippur, the beloved shrine of the Father, the Great Mountain..."; "... planted in it a pure place like a (high) rising mountain, / Its prince, the Great Mountain, Father Enlil .. ."; and p. 575, line 124: "Without Enlil, the Great Moun- tain ... ." In a letter dated March 27, 1995, Parpola kindly informed me that he had "checked the Assyrian database for theophoric personal names containing the element of shaddu, 'mountain,' and found all of them to be of the type 'DIVINE NAME-is-my/our- mountain' (DN-shaddua/ni), with only four divine names attested as the theophoric element: Assur, Bel, Marduk and Nabu. As you know, both Assur and Marduk were equated with Enlil; Nabu was equated with Ninurta, specifically in the aspect of the exalted saviour; and Bel was an appellative of both Marduk and Nabu/Ninurta as Victorious God.... This not only confirms that the God/Mountain imagery was current in Assyria too, but specifically suggests that it had as its mythological background the reunion of Ninurta and Enlil in Lugale and very probably was also used in the allegorial sense of Ps. 118:22/Matt. 21:42." 21 I shall discuss this particular issue later on in relation to the notion of the Even ha- Shetiyah. However, at this point we can already mention the Even ha-R'oshah (most probably, "the head stone" = "the Foundation Stone") in Zach. 4:7. 22 See the discussion below. 23 See Leroy A. Campbell, Mithraic Iconography and Ideology (Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1968), pp. 275-77. 437</page><page sequence="11">The Journal of Religion past did indeed feel that their concept of God was strengthened, rather than weakened, through its association with such a nomenclature as the "stone/rock." What it signaled to them came through the plain and imme- diate sense of the terms, not its alleged metaphorical explanation. IV If the foregoing discussion makes sense, its consequences are likely to achieve a breakthrough in our attempts to obtain a clearer, more nu- anced, and hence also more accurate picture of biblical religiousness. In this respect, scriptural myth and mythopoesis will escape being swept un- der the carpet of prejudicial opinion. What is of crucial importance for this discussion is not only the realization that myth or mythic materials are found in Scripture but that myth itself and, what is even more im- portant, mythic forms of thinking are a deeply rooted factor in scriptural lit- erature. One further observation has to be made at this point. In Ancient Israel there was no such term as "myth," or any other term, that implied what this one does in modern philosophy and scholarship.24 Thus, no distinc- tion was maintained, as is the case in phases of modern study, between mythic, nonmythic, and even antimythic materials. However, it should be noted that in the modern history of the term, a tinge of negative judg- ment is often implied.25 In such cases, the term does not serve descriptive and phenomenological aims. In a wider sense, the term "myth" implies tendencies toward prejudicial refutation rather than sincere attempts at scholarly realization. Myth, we should notice, is a special way of ap- proaching reality, both natural and supernatural. It involves cognitive modes and forms of expression that are different from the ones applied in, or as a result of, ordinary perception. When, however, myth is con- ceived as synonymous with pagan, hence primitive or idolatrous, forms of religiousness, it is likely to lose its usefulness as a term objectively desig- nating a cognitive mode or, as Ernst Cassirer called it, a unique "sym- bolic form."26 Briefly stated, value judgments are frequently involved in how the term "myth" is used. Doing so implies the scaling and grading of higher 24 For a comprehensive overview of major scholarly positions taken in relation to myth and Scripture, see Frederick H. Cryer, Divination in Ancient Israel and Its Near Eastern Environ- ment: A Socio-historical Investigation (Sheffield: Journal for the Study of the Old Testament Press, 1994), pp. 42 ff. 25 In this respect, a considerable amount of rationalistic apologetics still enters the mod- ern discussion of myth.

In my view of the matter, myth is a perceptive attitude rather than a descriptive or expressive performance. It presupposes, or actually enacts, certain modes of perception that sub- stantially expand the borders of the realizable world, such that the com- monly observed distinctions between various forms of reality are crossed. Consequently, modes of expression different from the ones applied to ordinary human experience, as established by sense perception and nor- mal rules of logical perception, are allowed to prevail. Generally speaking, the mythic aspects evolving in Scripture are mostly connected with theophanies and angelophanies. Among these, theophan- ies in the Sanctuary, or the Temple, occupy a special place." However, in this discussion I will limit myself to theophanies that are in one way or another connected with rocks and stones. The first example comes from Exod. 17:6: "Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb; and you shall strike the rock, and water shall come out of it" (my emphasis). The midrashic comment of the Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael suggests this: "God said to him [Moses]: In every place in which you find the imprint(s) of a man's legs, there I am before you."28 What the Mekhilta appears to imply is that God's image can take a physical shape, and even leave a physical-humanlike-imprint in or on a rock.29 Although, strictu sensu, what the Mekhilta says is that Moses could see vestiges of the divine pres- ence in that particular rock, there is more to what the Mekhilta text im- plies than is usually conceded. We can safely say that, since the scriptural verse reads "there I am before you," the Midrash actually implies that God's imprints in the rock indicate his presence there. There are good reasons to read this comment of the Mekhilta in light of the complementary notion, frequently referred to in other places in rabbinic literature, that physical representations of kings and gods actu- ally indicate the virtual presence of the represented being in their en- 27 It is interesting to notice, in this connection, that the "Sanctuary/Temple" symbolism in Qabbalah is "heavenly," too. 28 Horovitz and Rabin, Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael, p. 175. The English translation is mine. Notice should be taken of the fact that mentioning the footprints of God can here mean that the midrashist wanted to avoid the notion implied by the verse in the Book of Exodus to the effect that Moses actually hit the rock, that is, God, so as to bring water out of it. This is probably the sense in which the so-called Jerusalem Targum uses the suggestion that the "rock" here did not mean God but only his footprints. 29 It is interesting to compare here the information brought by Peter Harvey, An Introduc- tion to Buddhism (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), p. 191: "Pilgrims also visit Mount Siripada [in Sri Lanka], known in English as 'Adam Peak'.... On its summit is a 1.7 metre long depression in the rock, held to be a footprint of the Buddha when he used his meditative powers to fly to the island on a teaching trip. Such 'footprints' exist elsewhere in the Buddhist world, and are greatly valued as objects associated with Gotama." Notice should also be taken of the fact that the cultic symbol of the God Shiva is the Linga, that is, a phallic-like stone pillar. 439</page><page sequence="13">The Journal of Religion graved or painted images.30 I would even argue that this notion comes as close as one can to what is generally referred to as a fetishist visualization, even conceptualization, of the represented essence, whether divine or human. Thus, for instance, Genesis 1 maintains that man was created in the image of God. This is often interpreted as indicating the consubstan- tial identity of God and man.3 It is also said, once again in the Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael, that, if people break the sculpted images of emperors and other rulers displayed in public places, they actually "diminish the image of the King."32 If this saying of the Mekhilta is to make any sense, we should read it in the context of rulers' cult and royal worship in late antiquity. In this respect, it cannot but convey the then prevailing notion of fetishist veneration of deities and rulers.33 What is of even greater in- terest is the fact that this saying of the Mekhilta comes by way of illustrat- ing the theurgically expressed notion that, in disobeying God's decrees, people not only affect but actually diminish his (spiritual) essence.34 What interests us most here is the fact that, according to the Mekhilta (and it is not unimportant to notice that there are quite a number of midrashic parallels to this saying), the spiritual essence of the divine may assume physicality of one kind or another. Otherwise, the rabbis of the Midrash would not have treated the breaking or the desecration of those 30 The Mesopotamian background of this belief is discussed by Irene J. Winter, "Idols of the King: Royal Images as Recipients of Ritual Action in Ancient Mesopotamia," Journal of Ritual Studies 6 (1992): 13-42. I owe this reference to Professor Simo Parpola of Helsinki. For a wide-ranging discussion of icons and images in cult and art see Hans Belting, Likeness and Presence (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1994). 31 See, e.g., Mishnah Sanhedrin in Mishnah, trans. H. Danby (Oxford, 1933), 6:5: "Rabbi Meir said: When a man is sour troubled, what says the Shekhinah? My head is ill at ease, my arm is ill at ease!" 32 See the Mekhilta, p. 233. In another text that reflects Roman or Byzantine customs, it is said that, if a person throws a stone and even curses the "icon" of a king put up in the public square, he risks capital punishment. See Sh. A. Wertheimer, Batei Midrashot, 1:170. 33 It is interesting to notice that, in commenting on the halakhic discussions of ruler cults in late antiquity as we find them in the Talmud, some medieval commentators make a clear distinction between idols of gods and representational images of human beings. Prostration to the second class is not always considered Avodah Zarah. See in the Talmud "Tosafot" to Bav. Avodah Zarah 3/a, s.v. "She-l'o." In biblical times it was not uncommon to bow down to distinguished people. However, Mordecai "did not bow down or do obeisance" to Haman (Esther 3:2). The three men of Jewish origin did not "fall down and worship the [golden] image" that Nebuchadnezzar had erected. The prevalent and official rabbinic view on these matters was formulated rather sweepingly in Mishnah Avodah Zarah 3:1: "All images are forbidden [for any kind of utility] because they are worshipped once a year. So Rabbi Meir. But the sages say: Only that is forbidden which bears in its hand a staff or a bird or a sphere [symbols of lordship]. Rabban Simeon ben Gamliel says: That which bears aught in his hand" (Mishnah, trans. and comments by Danby). 34 See the extensive discussion in Moshe Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1988), pp. 156-99. I thank Professor Idel for several com- ments made on an early version of this article. 440</page><page sequence="14">God the "Stone/Rock" royal images in terms of the "diminishing the image of the king" nor have associated it with the severe consequences of the actual desecration by diminution of God. The rabbis' aim was to make clear to their listeners the severe consequences of religious blasphemy. It amounted to inflicting physical offense on God and, hence, made the desecrating person liable to and deserving of death. Those trained in rational theology may see in this an inherent contra- diction in terms. How can one compromise between such conflicting no- tions as the physical presence of God in or on a rock, on the one hand, and the notion of the alleged incorporeality of God, on the other? In- deed, there is an implied ambiguity in Jewish religiousness in this respect. Among other things, this self-contradictory element derives from the fact that in some places it is explicitly stated that on the occasion of receiving the Law on Mount Sinai the People of Israel did not see any temunah, that is, physical image (Deut. 4:12, 15). This is often interpreted as main- taining the absolute incorporeality of God. Since, however, we know that Moses did in fact see the temunat adonai (Num. 12:8), we must assume that Scripture holds two conflicting-though somewhat complemen- tary-views on the same subject. According to one view, there was in fact a temunah of God seen by the people, and according to the other, no hu- man being except Moses actually saw it.35 In any event, contradictions should not be explained away through metaphorical interpretation. As I have pointed out above, if this is done, dialectical nuancing loses its effectiveness, and scholars are likely to be deprived of the comprehension of scriptural religiousness in all its rich diversity.36 In short, metaphorization in our case is likely to flatten diver- sity into apologetic harmonizations. Let me be more specific on this issue. The injunction that one should not make "a graven image [pesel] in the form [temunah] of anything which the Lord your God has forbidden you" (Deut. 4:23, 25) is very clear about its limited inclusiveness: it forbids only the making of such "pesel in the temunah of anything.""37 It does not preclude the existence of a temunah altogether. Furthermore, it does not say anything about cultic objects and places that make no use of such a temunah. These are elsewhere forbidden in the form of the asherah, matsevah, and bamah (e.g., 1 Kings 14:23). 15 U. Cassuto, La questione della Genesi (Florence: University of Florence, 1934), tried to show that the view held in biblical criticism according to which these conflicting views can be attributed to two different "documental sources" has no evidential substance to it. 36 Whether this difference between Moses and the People of Israel reflects two contrasting points of view or only two accidental cases is an issue that need not be discussed here. 3 The word temunah is also used in the Decalogue (Exod. 20:3; Deut. 5:7), where idol worship is forbidden. 441</page><page sequence="15">The Journal of Religion Initially, then, rocks and stones could be worshiped or serve as cultic places. It made sense to worship such a rock only when it was believed actually to contain an aspect of divine essence or representation. The cult objects that were initially prohibited were handmade reproductions of certain divine images. Obviously, this does not exclude the possibility of a physical presence of God in or on a rocky place. When spoken to (Num. 20:7 ff.) or beaten with the magical staff of Moses (Exod. 17:7), a divine rock could even render drinking water, whatever that meant. When that rock was not properly handled, God himself was virtually desecrated, and the people involved-in this case, Moses and Aaron-were severely punished. In short, the above-mentioned case of the Mekhilta (and its parallels) makes one thing clear: the rabbis in question would not have elaborated on the rock issue in the way they did if there had been anything in their very concept of religion or of God that in principle spoke against it. What I have in mind is this: the law prohibiting the making and worshiping of cultic images in all likelihood received its special status already in the various forms of Pentateuchal religion, and particularly in its Deuterono- mistic sections. However, many people in the ancient world shared the opposite belief that, "theologically" speaking, there was nothing wrong with the presence of a divine essence in certain material objects. Notice how the People of Israel rejoiced at the golden calf, actually referring to it as "the God of Israel" (Exod. 32:4, 8). Moses saw the temunat Adonai and thus could make the proper distinctions of essence. The People of Israel, who had not seen such a temunah-that is, had no actual vision of a physical shape-were accused of confusing essence and appearance. As we shall see, scriptural religion did not fight idol worship just be- cause that kind of worship was nonsensical. Admittedly, there are in fact voices in Scripture, and later on in rabbinic writings, that actually ridicule idolatry. However, for most scriptural writers, the agendum was set at es- tablishing a different kind of God, one that was conceived of as physically dwelling in the sanctuary or temple. Although God was not conceived as being in any handmade objects, he was conceived of as occupying a certain place. Here, "place" (in Hebrew, maqom, which later on became the actual name of God)38 rather than a certain object was the key factor. At times, however, that "place" could still be identified with a cultic object, a stone39 or a rock, as the case might be. 38 See Efraim Elimelech Urbach, The Sages (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1987), pp. 66-79. 39 One should mention in this connection the cultic stones that the high priest was wear- ing in the temple and that were believed to be shining on special occasions; see Exod. 39:2-32. 442</page><page sequence="16">God the "Stone/Rock" V This brings us to a point in which a few words are due on idolatry in ancient Israel. Occasionally, idolatry became the target of theological ridi- cule. In principle, however, it could not, and should not, be taken as a cultic joke. It is one thing to treat idolatry as "cultic abomination" (Deut. 29:16) and another to ridicule it, as some of the prophets and psalmists did in their poetic enthusiasm.40 Primarily, I maintain that any theophany in nature implied a physical presence of God in a specific location. Evi- dently, this led to the consecration of sacred places (e.g., the theophany in the burning bush in Exodus 3). Idol worship is often connected with such places, but it had other aspects, too. In the face of the archeological evidence, also reflected in the sharp criticism that the prophets leveled at it, idolatry must be viewed as a live issue in Ancient Israel. No legal rul- ings were effective in eliminating its existence from the cultic scene. As a matter of theological principle, people were directed to believe that God could not be contained in a small place or object. As the prayer of King Solomon so clearly says on the occasion of the inauguration and consecration of the Jerusalem Temple, "But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built!" (1 Kings 8:27). However, the various occasions on which God or his glory were described as descend- ing into, or on (as the case might be), the sanctuary (e.g., Exod. 40:34-35; Lev. 9:23-24), the Temple (1 Kings 8:10-11; 2 Chron. 5:13-14), and Mount Sinai (Exod. 19:18; Deut. 4:11; 5:19-21) make it clear that a differ- ent view was allowed to prevail in practice. Accordingly, something of the divine essence could be experienced spatially. In light of the above, new explanations have to be offered for the pro- hibition of idol worship in Ancient Israel. It seems safe to say that the prohibition of worshiping idols came as a result of the fact that idolatry could all too easily lead to a desecration of the worshiped deity. Idols could be physically abused, mishandled, and damaged. The Israelite con- cept of God maintained his aloofness: God was above everything that 40 A typical example of this ridicule is found in Isa. 44:9-20 and 46:6-7. In medieval times, it was Maimonides who mocked at idols and considered their manufacturing as ex- pressive of human vanity. A strong polemical strain runs through most of Maimonides' writings, from the early days of his Commentary to the Mishnah (e.g., Tractate Avodah Zarah) to the late days of The Guide of the Perplexed. However, no ridicule but deep philosophical concern runs through most of Maimonides' polemics. In rabbinic writings of the talmudic period, we find the notion of "leitsanuta de-Avodah Zarah" (ridiculing the idol). As Saul Lieb- erman has shown in Hellenism in Jewish Palestine (New York: Jewish Theological Seminary of America, 1962), pp. 115 ff., there is very little mockery and sarcasm in the way in which the rabbis gave expression to their resentment of idol worship. The rabbis very seldom ridi- culed idol worship in a manner that is reminiscent of the church fathers of their times. 443</page><page sequence="17">The Journal of Religion could either harm or damage him, and this, first and foremost, in the physical sense of the term. Sacral profanation was always a real threat, even in the case of the God of the Israelites. God's aloofness protected him from physical damage.41 However, in a considerable number of cases, different things happened: God was either seen or envisioned in some aspect of corporeality or physicality. One such form of corporeality was the rock or the stone. Diagnosing, as we do, a theological conflict of interests is not something that should be interpreted as an open door for scholarly relativism. Quite to the contrary, in nuancing one's scholarly observations in face of con- flicting evidence, one becomes better equipped to judge data in the real- ity of their phenomenal complexity. In this respect, certain pages in the history of religiousness in Ancient Israel have to be rewritten. Moreover, it should be noticed that the rabbis of the Mishnah and Tal- mud were very serious in their handling of idolatry. Their halakhic oppo- sition to participating in anything that was likely to tempt their Jewish coreligionists to commit idolatry was extremely well informed. In fact, it is amazing to note how seriously they took the practice of idolatry. Too much was at stake for them to engage in frivolity. In this respect, even when discussing the issue of the one who "sits in the seat of scoffers" (Ps. 1:1) in the context of idolatry, the talmudic sages (Bav. Avodah Zarah 18b-19a) did not fall into the trap of sarcastically condemning their oppo- nents. The rabbis were well aware of what was at stake in such matters and cases. They were also fully aware of what was expected of them. After all, their non-Jewish neighbors were no literary fictions or social failures. They were friends, or real enemies, as the case might be, but not nonenti- ties. If so, their idolatrous customs had to be treated seriously. Border- lines created by disinformation can be effective only where ignorance prevails. But this was not the case with the talmudic rabbis nor even with their medieval successors: they very well understood that sarcasm and mockery could make people laugh but not convince them of the need to engage all their mental resources in fighting idolatry. VI Two further examples of this rock/stone imagery will bring us to the end of this study. When Jacob fled from his parents' home in Be'er Sheb'a, he "came to the Place, and stayed there for the night .... He took from the stones of the Place and put [it/them] under his head .... And he was afraid, 4 That kind of aloofness is quite commonly interpreted as indicating scriptural notions of transcendentalism. However, philosophical transcendentalism can hardly go together with the idea of a personal God. Thus, those who use the term actually do so by substantially misusing it, or using it out of its strict philosophical context. 444</page><page sequence="18">God the "Stone/Rock" and said, 'How awesome is this Place! This is none other than the House of God, and this is the Gate of Heaven.' So Jacob rose early in the morn- ing, and he took the stone which he had put under his head and set it up for an altar and poured oil on the top of it. He called the name of that place Bethel [= the House of God]" (Gen. 28:10 ff.).42 It is interesting to notice that Midrash Bereshit Rabbah (par. 68) interprets the word Makom ("the Place") as one of the epithets of God.43 Following this interpretation, the first verse in our passage would read: "And he came 'to God,' " Maqom being a metonym of God. In accordance with this translation, the verse "and he took from the stones of the Place" would read: "And he took from the stones of 'God.'" This brings us to Philo and to his interpretation of some of the verses quoted above. It is interesting to note that Philo ad locum does not sound as allegorical as he does on many other occasions. When, for instance, Philo comments on the passage describing Jacob and the stone(s) at Bethel, he writes in almost mythical terms: Now "place" [topos] has a threefold meaning, first that of a space filled by a mate- rial form, secondly that of the Divine Word [ho theios logos], which God Himself has completely filled throughout with incorporeal potencies [italics added]; for "they saw", says Moses, "the place where the God of Israel stood" (Exod. 24:10). Only in this place did He permit them to sacrifice, forbidding them to do so elsewhere: for they were expressly bidden to go up "to the place which the Lord God shall choose" (Deut. 12:5), and there to sacrifice.... There is a third signification, in keeping with which God Himself is called 'a Place', by reason of his containing things, and being contained by nothing whatever, and being a place for all to flee into, and because He is Himself the space which holds Him; for He is that which He Himself has occupied, and naught encloses Him but Himself. "I, mark you, am not a place, but in a place" [italics added].44 Among other things, it is interesting to observe how Philo creates an in- terpretative link between "the stone[s] of the place," the name of God, and the cultic place of worship. In doing so, something of the mythical is allowed to shine through. A similar passage of Philonian interpretation says this: "For, then, they shall behold the place45 which in fact is the Word [logos], where stands 42 To set the context of the ensuing discussion, see above note 11. The fact that the vision is a dream need not bother us here. A similar terminology would have been used had it been a "real vision." 43 A survey of various rabbinic sayings that relate to God in terms of "place" and "space" are discussed in Urbach, pp. 66-67. This discussion takes a completely different turn than the one taken by Urbach. For Urbach still considers the "place" terminology as applied to God to be on the conceptual, rather than the mythic, side. 44 Philo, De Somniis (On dreams) I, 61-64 [630], in the Loeb Classical Library, 5: 328-29. 45 Here Philo refers to the Septuagint, Exod. 24:10: "and they saw the God of Israel"- "And they saw the place where the God of Israel stood." This clearly reminds us of the 445</page><page sequence="19">The Journal of Religion God the never changing, never swerving, and also what lies under his feet like 'the work of a brick of sapphire, like the form of the firmament of the heaven' (Exod. 24: 10)."46 We need not enter here the ensuing dis- cussion in Philo's text. It should, however, be clear to the reader that with the addition of the reference to Exod. 24:10, the circle is closed: the "brick of sapphire," alias a heavenly stone, cannot be accidental in this context of "place" and "God." In this connection mention should be made of Exod. 33:21-23: "And the Lord said, Behold, there is a place by me where you shall stand upon the rock, and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by ... and you shall see my back." The italicized words, a place and the rock, fit very well into the picture that has been drawn so far. It is also interesting to notice that "seeing" here, as "seeing the place" in Gen. 22:4, is best taken as a technical term implying a theophany, or divine vision. It is said of Abra- ham: "On the third day, Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off." Elsewhere, I have shown that the words "lifted up his eyes" indicate a supernatural vision (perhaps a prophetic clairvoyance). If this is the case, it is once again noteworthy that Abraham saw "the place." In the biblical narrative, that place was a (or on a) mountain. In line with our current interpretation, it is reasonable to argue that the verse in question gives expression to the view that Abraham actually had a divine vision of God dwelling in a mountainous location. In fact, Midrash Rabbah, treating the verse explicitly, says that Abraham saw a cloud (of the glory of God).47 In other words, Abraham saw God. It is reasonable, therefore, to argue that in this case, as also in many others, both Scripture and its midrashic interpretations use the same technical language with the same framework of significations in mind. This being the case, the intertextual relationship between Scripture and Midrash should be viewed, not as is usually the case in the framework of a hermeneutic stance only, but actually as manifesting an ongoing tradi- tion of technical terminology.48 In fact, the Midrash helps the scriptural verse to convey its mythic content or meaning. Understandably, we cannot enter here a full-scale discussion of all the different aspects of the stone/rock symbolism, including for that matter comment made by the Mekhilta de Rabbi Ishmael, quoted above, to the effect that the vestiges of God's feet can be seen upon the rock. 46 Philo, De confusione linguarum (The confusion of tongues) 96 [419]. 47 See Midrash Rabbah to Gen., ed. Theodor-Abeck, p. 595. See also the legendary conver- sation Abraham conducts with his young attendants and son. The former had to admit that they did not see the cloud and were left behind, whereas Isaac saw the cloud. 48 The same would hold true in the case of certain materials incorporated in the pseude- pigraphic literature of the so-called intertestamental period. 446</page><page sequence="20">God the "Stone/Rock" the Qabbalah literature. However, in order to realize how far-reaching that symbolism is, we shall refer to one example taken from Joseph Gika- tilla's Sha'arei Orah (Gates of light).49 This book, most probably written around the time of the completion of the Zohar, often functions as a sys- tematic compendium to the symbolism of the Zohar However, it can well stand in its own right, independently stating important Qabbalistic posi- tions and issues. Sha'arei Orah has a rather long entry on even (stone). It starts with this statement: "Adonai is also referred to as EVEN, for it is the foundation of all the building in the world. All the world depends on it and its needs are fulfilled by it. It was called Even ha-Ro'shah [the first stone; Zech. 4:7], from here came forth the celestial and earthly multitudes of Creation." 50 The reference here is twofold. In the first place, mention should be made of the general Qabbalistic context. Even in the Qabbalah is a symbol5' of the tenth, and hence lowest, Sephirah, Malkhut (kingdom). In a sense, it functions as a junction between the upper and the lower worlds: "and after it draws from these higher sources, it then sustains all that is found below it, each according to his need."52 Through that Sephirah, the flow of the divine emanation into the lower world(s) becomes possible. In this sense, "the world [really] depends on it." Obviously, this marks a com- pletely new turn of the stone/rock imagery. Still, it is noteworthy that one of the chief attributes of Malkhut (kingdom), especially in its creative capacity, is Even. Briefly, then, the "kingdom" of God, technically viewed as the tenth Sephirah, is symbolically configured as "stone." That "stone" is viewed as a fountainhead of all the divine emanations that stream into the lower world. Qabbalah, then, transforms an old notion and adapts it for its own purposes. It is unlikely that this could have been done, unless an ancient tradition sustained it. VII Although there is much more to our subject than could be included in the present article, I hope that the materials discussed prove useful not only for the study of the language of Scripture, but also for a fuller real- ization of the mythic structures that are implied in that language. Over 4 Unless otherwise indicated, I quote from the new translation, Joseph Gikatilla, Gates of Light, trans. A. Weinstein (San Francisco: Harper Collins, 1994). 50 Ibid., p. 21. Weinstein's translation here wrongly has Ha-Rishonah instead of Ha- Ro'shah. 5' The names of the Sephirot are commonly referred to in the scholarly jargon as "sym- bols." However, the term "symbol" as used in literary and philosophical research does not fully cover the semiotic complexity of the names of the Sephirot. 52 Gates of Light, p. 22. 447</page><page sequence="21">The Journal of Religion against a rationalistic, demythicized reading of Scripture, I have sug- gested a reading of certain sections of it in light of a more relaxed attitude toward myth and mythopoesis. In employing that kind of reading, I tried to expose both a mythic superstructure as well as a mythopoetic infra- structure in the language used in Scripture. I have shown that myth in Scripture is not only a matter of casual borrowings from the pagan envi- ronment but actually a basic mode of cognition that characterized the Israelite perception of God. In other words, I have suggested that we realize the presence in scriptural language of a dimension, or layer, of mythic expression that for a long time has evaded readers and scholars alike. Among other things, that reading can help us in understanding im- portant issues in relation to the concept of idolatry in the various phases of Israelite religiousness in antiquity. I took issue with Maimonides over several principle issues because in my view his is a classic example of an approach that engages all of its intellectual resources for the sterilization of the mythic aspects of Scripture. From his own philosophical point of view, Maimonides may have had good reasons for doing so, but, as I have argued, that kind of rationalistic approach was not contained within its own medieval limits. It spilled over and later on, during the time of the Enlightenment, was reinforced by all kinds of philosophical considera- tions. Since then, it has also substantially colored the academic and schol- arly scenes. The point here is not to take issue with Maimonides, but to clarify some positions that used to, and sometimes still do, shape scholarly views. It may be argued that even when not directly reflecting theological inter- ests, those positions and views have prevented people from approaching the phenomenological subject matter in an openminded and unbiased manner. For a long time now, scholars have found it convenient to con- centrate mainly on textual and historical issues. The scholarly agenda have been set by the historical-critical approach, which relegates issues such as the ones raised here, to conditions that allegedly prevailed in a distant and primitive past. It has been argued that once religion made its first steps toward liberating itself from the ancient world, it turned everything upside down. Myth was converted by theology and for that matter could be declared "liquidated." Writing on myth in Judaism, G. Scholem made this comment: "In any case, the tendency of classical Jewish tradition to liquidate myth as a central spiritual power is not diminished by such quasi-mythical vestiges transformed into metaphors."53 This article has tried to show that such a position can no longer be maintained in the 5 Gershom Scholem, On the Kabbala and Its Symbolism (New York: Schocken, 1965), p. 88; the italics were added. 448</page><page sequence="22">God the "Stone/Rock" scholarly study of Jewish religion. The question here is, what is "classical Jewish tradition"? If it is Scripture, then Scholem is wrong, because there is myth in Scripture.
