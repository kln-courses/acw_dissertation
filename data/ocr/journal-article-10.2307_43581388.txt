Gaster sensational finds which throw light upon ancient life and thought. One of the most interesting of these is a small limestone plaque (4) discovered in 1933 near Arslan Tash (ancient Ņadatu) (2), in the plain of Seruj, and now preserved in the Museum of Antiquities at Aleppo (8). The plaque is engraved with three grotesque magical figures and contains, in characters of the seventh century B. C. (4), a Canaanite incantation against certain child-stealing demons. Pierced at the top for suspension, it was evidently intended to be hung in the room of a woman in childbirth. The text of this incantation was originally made known by its discoverer, Count du Mesnil du Buisson, in the Mélanges syriens offerts à René Dussaud , vol. I, Paris 1939, pp. 421-434. It was subsequently republished, first by A. Dupont-Sommer in Revue de Vhistoire des religions , 120 (1939), pp. 133- 159 (6), and later (with (l) The exact measurements are: height, 82 mm; width, 67 mm; maxi- mum thickness, 22 mm. (*) Dussaud, Syria 1925, 300, identifies Arslan Tash with the Thilati- comum of the Itinerary of Antoninus Placentinus. (3) Registration No. 1329. (4) The dating is that of Albright, who compares the script with that of the Aramaic legends on cuneiform dockets from Nerab. It is later than the Zenjirli inscriptions, already exhibiting debased forms of heh, heth and certain other letters. (5) Dupont-Sommer's article makes little advance upon the editio prin- ceps , and is marred by a number of interpretations which violate the laws of grammar. Thus, in line 3, the author reads Ak, and explains the group I*?# p as the equivalent of Akk. tnár i lisu, lit. " son of his god ", i. e. votary. In this dialect, however, " his god " would be (cp. 16, 17, M), not iSk. Similarly, the translation of lines 1-5 as " Incantation to eAthê, the goddess, by Sasom, son of Padrašeša, his god involves an impossible sep- aration of the two members of the status constructus DDD fit wb by the in- terpolation of the subordinate let alone the fact that the latter is now shown to he a false reading. Again, in line 16, in place of 'S) Din , the author reads DXn and renders pâture de ma bouche (as an epithet of the god H -w-r-n). But since when has DTPl meant "feed"? In Hebrew (Micah 1:13) it means " bind M, and this is also the meaning of the cognate Arabic ^ IV and of the Akkadian rotāmu . Moreover, as Albright has shown, the correct reading there is Dfl PK and, as pointed out below, this is the equi- valent of the common Akkadian formula sa pùsu ellu. Lastly, in the in- scription on the winged sphinx, the words Upt UVt are taken as verbs and rendered " strike, strike", whereas the analogy of the formula &amp;qti &amp;qti in Greek magical texts shows clearly that they are adverbs meaning ł c right now, right now ".</page><page sequence="3">A Canaanite Magical Text 43 improved readings and renderings) by W. F. Albright in the BASOR, Number 76 (December 1939), pp. 5-11. In all of these studies attention was directed primarily to the task of philological exegesis. Here, however, the document is ap- proached from a different angle, namely, as a monument of folklore and not only of Semitic archaeology. An attempt is made to give it its right place in magical literature generally, and it is shown, by the confrontation of parallels, that it is, in fact, an early Canaanite form of an incantation which survives to the present day. Each of its constituent elements is traced both backwards and forwards, - backwards to the Assyrian Lamashtu texts and similar more ancient sources, and forwards, through later Greek and Aramaic incantations, down to the modern Jewish " Kimpettzettel " (= " Kindbettzettel ")Ē In the light of this material several expressions hitherto obscure at last become clear (4). In order to bring out more readily the relation of our text to the comparative material, the commentary has been divided into three parts, according to subjects. The first discusses the demons against whom the spell is addressed. The second discusses the deities by whose power it is effected. The third discusses the magical praxis itself. A word should be added on the subject of language. The text is written in pure Canaanite, not in Aramaic, as was at first supposed (*). That the demoness KDÖU bears a distinctly Aramaic name does not detract from this conclusion, the explanation being that a standard Canaanite formula was addressed, in this particular case, to a figure of local Aramaic folklore. In precisely the same way, later Aramaic incantations are frequently addressed to Persian, Greek and other exotic demons (3). (4) Attention may be drawn especially to the following: (a) rbx, in lines 9, 13, 14 and 15, = TÒH , not . - (ò) bïl || 31, in lines 11-12, = Akk. wak/utn and rubďum . - (¿r) pin IltPK, in line 16, = Ereškigal. - (ď) Díl tPK, ibid., ~ Akk. ša pūšu ellu . - (e) Q9B DVB , on the winged sphinx = Greek, ölqxi ôqti or fjôr) Tļ0rļ. - (f) on the she- wolf = Akk. formula at-la-ki. - {g) fit TD, on the male figure = repre- sentation oí magical &lt;( hissing and spitting". (8) To give but one example, if the text were Aramaic, we should expect 13 instead of ¿3 in line 11. (3) Similarly, the Aramaic H7X (if rightly read) in line 3 could have been taken over automatically in the comprehensive group nSx KtWIIB. The word is similarly attached to a divine name in the 9th cent. B. C. inscription from Ördek-börnu, viz. line 5 : ^K33lS ; margin : nSłt tPOtP.</page><page sequence="4">44 Theodor H.

The conception of the child-stealing demon as a flying creature has interesting parallels. 1. In Classical belief she is definitely identified with the strix, or night- owl. The description given by Ovid, Fasti, VI, 131 if. may be taken as re- presentative : Sunt avidae volucres . . . Node volant ptierosque petunt nutricis egentes, Et vitiant eunis corpora rapta suis. Carpere dicuntur lactentia viscera rostris Et plenum poto sanguine guttur habent . Est Ulis strigibus nomen . . . (Greedy birds there are . . . that fly by night and seek out babes when their nurses are absent. These they carry away, and mar their bodies with their talons. The bowels of sucking bairns they are said to rip out with their beaks, and they have their throats full glutted with the blood they drink. They go under the name of screech-owls. . .) (*). - Cf. also Pliny, Hist. Nat. XI, 39. 95. 2. In Arabia, the child-stealing witch likewise takes the form of a screech- owl. - Doughty, Arabia Deserta , I, 305. 3. In the Old Testament, Isaiah 34 : 14-15, Lilith is associated with such winged creatures as kites (J11H) and with jackals. Similarly, in the Talmud, Niddah 24b, she is said to possess wings: 1ÖK fllÖH nSßön ib hSk «in „tpS hköe. (If a miscarriage possess the form of a lilith, its mother is still subject to the law of purification after childbirth, for it is none the less a child, although it possess wings). - Cf. also Rashi ad Sanhédrin 109a. (4) In the Hebrew charm still suspended on the walls of a lying-in chamber by more superstitious Jews, one of the names of Lilith is given as .JUntĎtP. I suggest that this is an error for na*ltDtf , i. e. the strix. The witdi is still called Strygoi in Rumania and the Balkans generally.</page><page sequence="6">46 Theodor H. Gaster 4. In line with this is the later Jewish belief in a lilith-like demon called Broxa, for this name connects with the Spanish bruxa and the Provencal bruesche , which means primarily " a noxious night-bird" . - Trachtenburg, Jewish Magic and Superstition , 278, 34. 5. Similarly, Devid de Pomis, in his Semah David (Venice, 1587), p. 73, describes Lilith as " a wild animal or spirit, or, - as some say, - a bird which flies by night ". - Trachtenburg, loc. cit. 6. Significant also is the fact that Targum Onqelos renders DDnfl, the name of an unclean bird in Leviticus 11 : 16 and Deuteronomy 14 : 15, by the word KTlB'tOn (lit. 44 Snatcher " ; cf. Ovid's carperei ), for in the Aramaic chartns, Montgomery 8,2 and 17,4, is the name of a demon! This shows that there was a popular belief in a bird-like demon who li snatched away " his or her victims (4). 7. An analogous demon called 'Oçvtaç (from õqviç " bird ") appears in the Greek charm, Pradel, 20, 19 f: ôai}ióviov tò ¿ietapaM.ónevov âv x&lt;H&gt;&lt;xxtt¡qi ávÜQíójiov, oí tò õvoiia 'Opvíaç (the demon which asumes human shape, and is called Ornias, or Birdsprite). This demon is mentioned also in Codex Neapol. II, c. 34, fol. 324, while in the Testament of Solomon (ed. Cony- beare, JQR XI, 17), Ornias is a demon who strangles lustful men. The name is directly comparable with our KflBP. 8. An Armenian charm against the Ale, or child-stealing witch, published by (Mrs.) J. S. Wingate in Folk-Lore 1930, 169 ff. identifies that demon with a " foul eagle " (p. 181), and in a related charm in the same MS., the demon is portrayed grasping the oesophagus and bronchial tubes oí his victim, and having bird's claws (ib. PI. II, fig. 1). 9. Among the Malayans, the child-stealing witch is identified with a screech-owl, and known as langsuyar . - Skeat, Malay Magic , 322. 10. An early Sumerian counterpart to our demon Kilty may be recog- nised in the much-discussed " Burney relief" of the Larsa period (Davis, Illustrated London News , June 13, 1936 ; D. Opitz and Mrs. E. Douglas Van Buren, AFO 1937, 350 ff. ; H. Frankfort, AfO 1938, 128 f. ; E. G. Kraeling, BASOR No. 67, 16 f.). This images a winged female figure standing nude upon two lions, and possessing bird's feet. She is flanked by standing owls. Prof. Kraeling has already suggested that the relief depicts Lilith. In the light of the material assembled above, it is clear that we have here the pro- totype of our KDE? , - a winged female demon, capable of transformation into a bird, and of essentially nocturnal character (note the owls). It should be observed especially that in a magical text published by Fossey, the analogous Lamashtu is described as possessing the feet of birds ! This single passage, which no one has yet aduced, ought to have been sufficient to point the way towards the correct interpretation of this unique relief. Significant (A) Montgomery would see PJXin = in the DTIH of one of his charms; but this, I think, is a mistake. 1W there means penis&gt; as often in later Hebrew, and the expression is explicable from Leviticus 15:3: DWTTT lifers . Note that the curtailment of progenitive powers is one of the prop- erties of the lilith, regularly mentioned in texts of this kind.</page><page sequence="7">A Canaanite Magical Text 47 also is the fact, duly noted by Frankfort, that female demons with bird's feet are sometimes imaged on Akkadian seal-cylinders " holding a crouching man in their talons and another in each hand " (e. g. B. M. 89746 ; Dela- porte, Catalogue des Cylindres du Louvre , A. 144). A possible identification of Lilith with a bird in Sumerian times may perhaps be found in a tablet from Ur containing part of a Gilgamesh epic, published by Chiera in Sumerian Epics and Myths , 1934, No. 21 : 42,84,96, and recently discussed by S. N. Kramer in his Gilgamesh and the Huluppu- Tree , Chicago 1938. This text states that Lilith * ' built for herself a house " in the midst of the sacred huluppu- tree, while the Zu-bird occupied its topmost branch. This may point to an identification of Lilith with a bird, possibly the owl. 11. That Lamashtu, the child-stealing witch of Assyrian folklore, was believed to possess wings, is implied by the address to her in Lamashtu I i 18 : itti issûré lami taparraì (with the birds of heaven fly away), - an address recurring, in slightly altered form, on a plaque figured in Lajard, Culte de Vénus , Pl. XVII, fig. 1, and discussed by Thureau-Dangin in RA 1921, 198. 12. The belief in a child-stealing witch who turns into a bird may also be found underlying a Ceylon story recorded in Folk-Lore 1887, 352 f.: The devil-bird (syrnium indrani) is thus accounted for: "a jealous and morose husband, doubting the fidelity of his wife, killed her infant son during her absence and had him cooked, and on her return set him before her. She unwittingly partook of it, but soon discovered that it was the body of her child by a finger which she found in the dish. In a frenzy, she fled to the forest and was transformed into a pianta, or devil-bird, whose appalling screams represent the agonised cries of the bereaved mother when she left her husband's house ". Here we have, clearly, a conflation of two familiar motifs , viz., (a) murder revealed by a portion of the victim's body, and (ò) bereaved mother becomes a bird-demon (cf. Malayan langsuyar). 13. Nor is it only the child-stealing vampire who is regarded in ancient folklore as possessing the form of a bird or winged creature. The belief obtains also in the case of other demons. (a) The evil spirits of Babylonia are often portrayed as winged beings. - Jastrow, Religion Babyloniens und Assyriens, I, 281. In Utukkê limnûti , V, I, 20 (Thompson, Devils etc.y I, 50) evil spirits are identified with owls who hoot over a city ( eś sepu sa ina âli iś ag g umu sunu). - (â) In late Roman- Egyptian magic, demons often have the form of birds. - Wünsch, Sethia - nische Verfluchung stafeln, 103. - (c) In the Aru isles it is believed that evil men ( suwanggi ) turn into noxious birds. - J. G. F. Riedel, De siui- ken kroesbarige rassen tusschen Selebes en Papua , 1886, 372, 305 (quoted in Crawley-Besterman, The Mystic Rose , I, 101). - (d) In Temimber and Timor- laut, demons have similar form. - Riedel, op . cit., 305. - (e) In Job 5 : 7 the coterie of the plague-god Rashaph are described as winged beings : • LXX renders the word ř|tth by Ywróç* Aquila by jinļvov, Symmachus by nereivcov, Vulgate by avis, Peshitta by Kfciy OS (cf. our KDBP!) while Targum Onqelos actually identifies the Pjtíh *32 with the familiar seven demons of Mesopotamian folklore.</page><page sequence="8">48 Theodor H. Gaster 14. It is, of course, always possible that the child-stealing RTW of our text was really regarded as a witch who assumed bird form, for belief in the possibility of such transformations was common in antiquity. It may best be illustrated from Classical sources : (a) Ovid, Am. I, 8. 13 : hanc ego nocturnas versam volitare per umbras Suspicor et fama est . (Methinks, and rumor hath it. that o' nights She changeth shape and flitteth thro' the gloom). (ô) A pulei us % Met. II, 22: perpetuam noctem eximie vigilandum est , excertis et inconivis oculis semper in cadaver Mentis, nec acies usquam de- vertenda . . . quippe cum deterrimae versipelles in quodvis animal ore converso latenter adre pant . . . nam et aves et rur sum canes et mures immo vero etiam muscas induunt . (All night long a sharp watch must be kept, eyes alert, riveted and glued to the body and gaze never wandering . . since there are dread beings capable of changing their skins into those of animals, who might perchance creep nigh it by stealth, with face averted These beings assume the forms of birds, or dogs, or mice. Sometimes, indeed, they even appear as flies) (4). - (c) Lucian, Asinus , § 12: fuiéQCMç ôè -uore^ov oti tcoMcùç dyyetai jiqÓç i) IlaXaiatQa cóç i) Ôéojioiva avtfjç oqviç }ićXA.oi Jietéafrai Jtçòç tòv èço&gt;nevov. (Some few days later Palaistra brings me word that her mistress is about to change into a bird and fly to her lover). - (d) Papyrus Leyden II, 1901, 1 : jwhtjöov h« yevéaíhn êv ói¿ouó(iaai jicivTcov xTiafiátcov, Aúxov, xvva, Piovra, jtöq, ôévôpov, y v nay tel/oç, "uÔíoq, t1 ô dé&gt;c£iç (Make me to assume the form of anything at will, to become, at choice, wolf, dog, lion, fire, wood, vulture, wall, water, or what you please). This collection of parallels thus shows clearly that the identification of the child-stealing demon with an RTlcy, or winged creature , is in line with a well-established magical tradition , traceable both before and after the date of the composition of our text. Epithets: 1. ļtPH "ttrQ XT'ty (a l), Flier in the dark chamber . This description of the child-stealing lilith has several highly interesting parallels. - (a) In the Egyptian charm published by Erman, Zaubersprüche für Mutter und Kind ( Abh . Preuss . Akad. Wiss. Phil. -hist. Kl. 1901, i.), p. 12, she is invoked as " thou (f.) that comest in darkness - (¿) An exact counterpart to this is to be found in the B. M. magical bowl, 51-10-9, 96 (cited by Tallquist, Maglu, 128 ; cf. PSBA XII, 300): TS [^3¡5&lt;3 KM Kfl'V? " Lilith who cometh in darkness". - ( c ) Similar also in the description of the ( 1 ) The details about entering with face averted recurs in Erman 's Egyptian charm, p. 12 : 11 thou (f.) . . . that slinkest (?) in with nose behind thee afid face averted</page><page sequence="9">A Canaanite Magical Text 49 analogous Empusa given by Libanius in the life of Aeschines : ex axomvcov TÓJioov Tolç Jtaiaì xai yvvaillv (oprato " out of dark places she proceedeth against children and women ". - (d) In Sumerian, this demon was known as KISKIL UDDAKARRA, or " Maiden who seizes away the light ". - Langdon, Semitic Mythology , 362. - ( e ) An Akkadian equivalent of this last may be found in Lamashtu, I iii 19, where that demon is called [musa3]dirat ùmê% " darkener of the day". - (/) By way of more general comparison, it may be recalled that the Arabic word jinn means etymologically " creature of darkness", or the like (cf. Ps. 91:6 "the pestilence that walketh in dark- ness". - As for the espression ļtPH IT, it is noteworthy that this is an exact equivalent of the Akkadian bit iklîti ( Maqlü II 21 ; IV R 14. 11 etc.), which is significantly identified in RT XX 208, IV 22 with Ê. AZAG. AN (= Akk. bit asakki), "house of the demon" (v. Meissner, OLZ 1916, 141). 2. ntSÖ (b 1), Plutuleress. The reference is, of course, to the carrying off of newborn babes. "Kidnapper" would be, perhaps, a not inappropriate translation. - An exact equivalent is afforded by Lamashtu II, ii 60, where that demoness is similarly called ha-ab-ta-at , of the same meaning. Cp. also IV R 58 d 32, where she is styled mut-tab-bi-lat&gt; of the same general sense. 3. T'tnt (b 1), Crusher (of bones). The reading is due to Albright, who explains the word as equivalent by metathesis to the Hebrew nace, used in this sense in Micah 3:3. We may also compare Arabic Ethiopie ¿Kvfi, and Akkadian pasâhu of the same meaning. An Arabic identical with our form, is recorded in the Kamûs. This epithet, too, has interesting parallels. One of Erman's Egyptian charms (Ber. 3027, B. I, 4-7) describes the child-stealing witch as "Thou breaker of bones ". With this we may aptly compare Lamashtu I, ii, 2, where it is said of that fell spirit tu-Âas-sa-si buané, "Thou breakest men's thews in pieces Cp. also IV R 55 b 17 (Fossey, La Magie chaldéenne , 397), where the demon Utukku is called UTUK HUL. GAL SAG KAZ, "Evil Utukku who smashes the head" . Since the verb JTIŁ may possess the meaning of "break- ing by splitting", the following parallels may also be pertinent: - In a Greek charm printed in Pradel, p. 20, 22, an analogous demon is described as çfjaoov ttjv xe&lt;pcdr)v tov àvdQaíJiov, " (demon) that splitteth open a man's head". Similarly, on a Lamashtu-plaque figured in Lajard, Culte de Vénus, Pl. XVII, fig. 1, and republished by Thureau-Dangin, RA 1921, 198, her third name is given as pairu sa qaqqada unattu , " dagger that splitteth the skull ". Again, in the Armenian charm against the child-stealing Ale (Folk- Lore 1930, 181) that demon, transformed into an eagle, is described as " sitting on a man's head, devouring his flesh, and sucking out his brain ", - which comes to the same thing. A male demon who " crushes thy bone(s) '' D*DßÖ) is mentioned in the Aramaic charm, Montgomery 7:17, while ibid . I, 10-11 reference is made in general terms to demons pîMCÔI ['fita "who scourge and mutilate and break". On the other hand, if we Orientalia - 4</page><page sequence="10">50 Theodor H. Gaster prefer to read MIO, with du Mesnil du Buisson, we may find an excellent parallel in Maqlù I 29 which speaks similarly of the actions of nocturnal demons in the words ina eli kispiìa limhasüsi i láni musiti , 4 'may the demons (lit. gods) of the night assail him 4. [XVpW&gt; (a 2), Lilith. Only the letters *bb are clear, but the feminine form is surely required, seeing that this is an epithet of XT't$ who is definitely termed " goddess " in line 1. Du Mesnil du Buisson has, indeed, suspected the existence of a fourth letter, but his reading pSS is scarcely probable. The identification of the child-stealing witch with Lilith (Akk. lilitu)&gt; who in Assyro-Babylonian magic is primarily a succubo, , follows a tradition well attested in Aramaic and later Jewish sources. Thus, in Montgomery 11,6 Lilith is described as " plaguing boys and girls", while in 18,6 she is said to "strangle (v. infra) and eat" them, and "to drink up their urine", like a pariah dog. In Midrasli Numbers Rabbah, sect. 16, Lilith is said to prey on little children, even eating her own when she cannot find any others. The Jewish " Kindbettzettel ", still hung up by superstitious persons on the wall of a lying-in chamber, usually contains in its centre the Hebrew legend pn "Get out, Lilith", written in bold characters. The accompanying text (v. Montgomery, 42) gives Lilith as the first of the demon's many names, - though this is changed to the equally familiar Gello in European counterparts of this charm ( 1 ). (A) Here perhaps is a fitting place to introduce the suggestion that the masculine (Akk. Itlu), so common in the Aramaic texts, may indeed be found in the Old Testament. The passage in question is Isaiah 2 : 18 which runs as follows in MT : • Now, it has long been observed that the assumed ad- verbial use of in the sense of " utterly " lacks basis, and that the usual rendering, viz. " And the idols shall utterly pass away " would at least re- quire . A standard emendation is , but this scarcely accords with the following verse : 14 And they shall enter the caverns of the rock and the holes in the ground before the Terror of YHWH n. I therefore suggest that the right reading is PfSn* D*WļtHļ " and the idols shall be as a lilù that fiits by In support of this reading, five indépendant points may be made, viz : - 1) is le mot juste for the flitting by of spirits ; cf. Job 4 : 15. It is especially happy when it is remembered that lilù (from Sumerian LIL) really means " wind ". 2) The next verse now follows logically, for in Babylonian and Greek incantations, demons are frequently banished to clefts in the rocks etc. ; v. Pradel, 97, 107. 3) Added point is given to the words HIPP "TIC OBÖ for it is just this Terror, called in Greek text? $ópoç, which is said in magical incantations to cause the flight of demons ; v. Dieterich, Abraxas, 87 if.</page><page sequence="11">A Canaanite Magical Text 51 b) 1ÖK flpjn, S h e Who Strangles Lamb(s). With this name du Mesnil du Buisson has aptly compared the Arabic jjy LL (strangler of the ram), - a popular name for the child-stealing demon. This comparison makes it plain that we are dealing here with an- other hypostasis of the lilith, and not with a real assailant of cattle, such as Greek and Syriac charms often mention. The reason why the demon was thus known as 14 the strangler of rams " is explained by the accompanying illustration which depicts her as a she-wolf (4). This has interesting folklore parallels : 1. In the Akkadian Lamashtu text, II, II 59-60 and III r i 7 (cp. also IV R 55 r; 1 RA XVIII, 166, line 13; ZA XVI 156, line 39), that demon is described not only as " grim and grisly " (ezzit samrat ), but also as a she-wolf {barbarai . - 2. In Greek belief, the bogey who comes after children, and with whom they are threatened, is called (iOQiioXwcEtov, - a name plausibly explained as meaning the li Bogey (^OQjjuó)-wolf '' - Aristophanes, Thesmo- phoriae, 417 ; Plato, Phaedo, 77 E etc. - 3. In Indo-German folklore, the wolf passes as a chthonic beast (H. Hirt, Die Indogermanen , II, 1907, 496, 733 ; Rosche, Abh. König. Sächs. Gesell. Wiss. Phil. -Hist. Kl. XVII, 1897, 52, 57 if.). The demoniacal raksas of the Vedas, for instance, often have the forms of wolves. Similarly, Greek lore associates a ghostly wolf or jackal with Hekate (Rosche, Kyn. 61 ff.). - 4. In the Middle Ages, the Devil himself was often regarded as a wolf (C. Meyer, Aberglauben d. Mittelalters, 247, 269 ff. ; v. Abt, Apol. Apulei, 126, n. 2). - 5. Perhaps, as my wife suggests, we have here a Semitic werewolf. This would give added point to the name flpjn , since the strangling of its victims plays a prominent rôle in the werewolf idea. - 6. The title RTIpW (Strangler) by itself occurs frequently in Aramaic and Syriac texts as a designation of the child-stealing hag.

The divine name S-s-m has Cypriotic connections (4). It recurs in the theophoron DDD^Sy (servant of S-s-m) in the Cypriotic inscriptions CIS I 46, i (IV-III cent. B. C.) ; I 93, 3 (254 B. C.) and I 49, 53 (Tan. 2), Its earlier occurrence (c. XVI cent. B. C ) in the DDDTiy of the Ras Shamra (Ugaritic) inscription Bauer No. 64 r 6 does not argue against its Cypriotic origin , for the relations between Ras Shamra and Cyprus, which lies almost directly opposite, were close (v. Schaeffer, Ugaritica I, 42-3). The name may also be detected, as Albright has observed, in the 'ÖDD (LXX Zoao|¿a¿ ; Vulg. Sisamot) of I Chron. 2, 40, but here again it is significant that the only parallel is the Cypriotic 'ODD of Larnax Lapithos I (CIS i 95), 3 (end of IV cent. B.C.). The probability that S-s-m is of Cypriotic provenance is strengthened by the fact in a second magical plaque from Arslan Tash, not yet published, mention is expressly made of a deity (or of two deities?) called (sic!), i. e. the Cypriot (or, two Cypriotsi). Important also in this connection is the fact that S-s-m is here shewn brandishing an axe, for this widespread symbol of divinity has, indeed, certain specifically Cyp- riotic connections. It is found as a symbol on vases from Cyprus (v. fournal of Hellenic Studies XXI 107, fig. 3), and one of the names of the Cypriotic "high god" was indeed AePçávioç (Karo, ARW VII 125), - a name now generally explained from Asianic labrys " axe " (Plutarch 2, 302 A), i. e. the (4) The vocalisation of this name is uncertain.

A Carian Sáaacopioç is also known (Sayce, TSBA IX 121), but -co|íoç is there a native ending (as in e. g. 'AqXîcojaoç, Botœpioç), for cp. the Carian toponym üóaavóa (Diod.

As likely a guess as any is that he was an hypostasis of that Cypriotic plague-god whom the Graeco-Semitic bilinguals (e. g. CIS I 89) identify respectively with Apollo and Rashaph. The expression b-n P-d-r-s-s-a is more difficult to explain. There would appear to be two possibilities, viz: - 1) B-n means "son of", and P-d-r-s-s-a is the name of a deity. Accepting this view, du Mesnil du Buisson and Albright suggest that the first element in P-d-r-s-s-a may equate with the divine name P-d-r (and P-d-r-y) of the Ras Shamra texts (2). (*) The prevalence of this symbol in Asia Minor and North Syria is shewn by the fact that a tract of territory near Commagene is actually written e. " Land of the Double-Axe " in " Hittite " hieroglyphic script (v. Hrozný, Archiv Orientalni 1936, 206, n. 8). (ž) The evidence about the deity PDR-PDRy is as follows : The name occours in the following passages of the RS texts: - Semitic: RS 1929 I 15; XXII 4 ; XXIX 3; Syria 1938, 343, line 4 ; I AB V 10-11 ; II AB I 17-19; V AB a 23-5, c. 3, e. 3,49. - Hurrian : RS 1929 IV 62; VII 10; XXXV 2,4; XLIX 1 (restoring P'DR]). - The character of the deity is best determined by a careful study of his or her affiliations : In V AB I 23 fif. PDR-y occurs as one of the daughters of BAAL. - In the Hymn to Nikkal , {Syria 1936. 209-228) we are told that when the moon- god YARIH sued for the hand of NIKKAL daughter of BAAL, he was first offered PDR-y (v. Aistleitner, ZDMG 1939, 52-9). The text says very clearly: In'mn ilm, lhtti-m B' l, trh Pdry b[t] . . . aqrbk ab h B' I, " O thou well-be- loved of the gods, thou would-be son-in-law of Baal, espouse thou rather PDR-y, the daughter] . . . Then will I cause her father Baal to come nigh unto thee (sc. in favor)". With this last accords the fact that in the ritual tariff RS 1929 I 14 f. PDR-y is associated with B'L and YRH. In RS 1929 I 15 PDR-y is associated with SRMN. This is undoubtedly the Hur- rian ŠARUMA of the Tell Ta'anek theophorous name Puti-Šaruma "serv- ant of Šaruma " (IV r. 6; VII obv. 3). Goetze (MVAeG 1933, 258 f.) iden- tifies with ŠARMA , mentioned in KUB XV I ii 18 f. as a son of the goddess Hepit, but it is noteworthy that in Bo. 4818 V 16 (Forrer, ZDMG 1922, 194, No. 32) ŠARUMA occurs as a synonym of HEPIT herself, while in the Ras Shamra text 1929 XXXIV 3 ŠRMN is associated with ŠWSK, i. e. the Hurrian goddess ŠAUŠřCA , who is in turn associated with HEPIT (HBT) in RS 1929 XLIX (Bauer) 5-6. - In RS 1929, No. VII, PDR is associated with KMRB , i. e. the Hurrian KUMARPI , "father of the gods", who is in turn associated with Hepit in KUB XXVII I i 59,60; XX 8 etc. - [In line 1 of the RS text, KMRB is styled Kmrb urgn, in which I have no hesitation in recognizing KUMARPI of URKIS, mentioned in the old Hittite myth discussed by Forrer, JA 1930, 238 f.

Un-</page><page sequence="14">54 Theodor H. Gaster On this two observations may be offered: (a) the naming of deities by pat- ronymics or metronymics is not in accordance with general Semitic usage, and would therefore suggest imitation of a foreign style, like Greek Kqo- viÔtjç = Zeus, or At)toÍôi1ç = Apollo, - an assumption further supported by the foreign ending -i-i-a ; - (¿) P-d-r of the Ras Shamra texts can now be gnad, Subartu, 142-3. Further, in the Mari Text, No. 282, we hear of a certain Terru, king of Urkis ; v. Jean, RES 1938, 132). That urgti in the RS text is indeed a toponym is clear from the fact that in the parallel text RS 1929, No. XXXIV, Kmrb urgn is replaced by Šwsk rdn, and in a Hur- rian text a word beginning with r- is most plausibly explained as a loan- word, and hence here as a toponym, qualifying Swsk = ŠAUŠKA]. - In RS 1929 XXII 4, PDR occurs beside a deity whose name ends in -rt. Since 'STRT (Ashtareth) is specifically mentioned in line 6 of that very text the only alternative is 'AS]RT (Asherath), consort of the high god EL, and thus the Semitic equivalent of Hurrian Hepit. Note in this connection that in the Hurrian text RS 1929 IV 6-9, the god KUMAR PI (Kmrb), whom we have already seen to be closely associated with Hepit, is actually identified with the Semitic EL. The text reads : hzr hzlz II Kmrb ha s arai hasulés Ilu Kumarpi " may (this prayer) indeed be heard, O El, 0 Kumarpi 1 [That hzr hzlz is the Hurrian formula hasarai hasulês of KUB XXVII 42 r. 20 f ~was~ already seen by Friedrich in AIO X 295. The formula now recurs in the analogous text KUB XXIX 8 r. iii 23-4. The ending - ulês may be identified with that in katihulêi EA 53, 65, and sehalulês and kaslulés of KUB XXIX 8 iv 31, identified" by Goetze (RHA 1939^03^ as that of 3rd sg. optative. Since has- is known to mean 4 'hear", kasarai ha su lèi will denote something like 11 with hearing be it heard cp. the He- brew construction tflötP etc.]. In RS 1929 XXXV 2-4 (in the latter case miswritten PBRtn-), the deity is associated with T[SB] and HBT, i. e. the Hurrian Tešub and Hepit. (For the restoration, see my note, AfO 1937, 150.) Thus it is clear that PDR/PDR-y is a goddess, virtually iden- tical with the Hurrian Hepit , or at least of the same type, regarded in terms of Semitic mythology as a daughter of BA'AL, and associated with such deities of vegetation and/or fertility as ARS-y " goddess of the soil " (cp. Sanchuniathon's (Tij!) and TL-y "goddess of small rain, dew ' (V AB 1 23 ff. etc.). Concerning the provenance of the goddess, two points should be taken into account, viz : - (a) The frequent occurrence of her name in non-Semitic documents from RS makes a Semitic origin unlikely. - (¿) On the other hand, her complete absence from Boghaz Kewi, Nuzu or Mari texts makes it equally unlikely that she was Hurrian. Most probably she was a foreign importation, from some Asianic, or possibly even Cypriotic, source into both the Semitic and Hurrian panthea of that cosmopolitan seaport, Ugarit (Ras Shamra). That she was thoroughly naturalized in both systems by the time our RS texts came to be written is clear from the way in which she possesses in each clearly defined affiliations and associations. Note-</page><page sequence="15">A Canaanite Magical Text 55 shewn to be a goddess ; hence, the style b-n P-d-r-š-s-a would be metro - tiymiCi and this would suggest that S-s-tn originated in an area, like e. g. Lycia, where it was customary to name men, and hence deities, by metro- nymics, rather than patronymics. - 2) The alternative is to regard P-d-r-s-s-a as a name of a place, and to take b-n as the equivalent of the Hebrew worthy in this respect is the hybrid theophorous name Pdr-mlk in RS 1929 XXIX 3. (It is impossible to accept the view of Eissfeldt that mlk and OT mdle c h are but names of a Phoenician kind of sacrifice, since the divine name Malkum occurs already on tablets of the Illrd Dynasty of Ur ; v. on this, N. Schneider, Biblica 1937, 337-343 and 1938, 204). The meaning of the name PDR /PDR-y cannot yet be determined. Since the goddess is, in all likelihood, not of Semitic origin, efforts to explain it by means of a Semitic etymon may be rejected from the start. This disposes of Dus- saud's derivation ( Syria 1925, 410) from a root p-d-r , akin to Arabic fadara "break stones", in the sense of "Thunder-deity", - a view which also encounters the difficulty that Arabic fadara " break stones " is itself uncertain jJsjo " a stone broken into large pieces" being probably a specialized de- velopment of f-d-r " be large " in the sense of "to make into large pieces Two views may be mentioned: (a) In Syria 1932, 116 Virolleaud reports a RS word p-d-r denoting some sort of emblem of royalty, sometimes par- allel to b-r-q " lightning ". In OLZ 1937, 671 the present writer suggested that this pdr might be a loan-word from Sumerian badara " double axe", which was also borrowed into Akkadian in the form patarru. In that case, PDR/ PDR-y as a divine name would be comparable with Graeco-Asianic AaßQttvöev? etc. (from labrys "axe") as a name or title of the high-god ("Zeus"; and possibly also with the (Zeus) AaxiTpróç of Strabo 536 f. which P. Carolidis ( Bemerk . zu den alten kleinasiatischen Sprachen und Mythen , Strassburg 1913, 55 f. ; cited by A. B. Cook, Zeus II, 616) ingeniously ex- plains from Armenian daku "axe". (The objection raised by Aistleitner in ZDMG 1939, 56 that badara means "club'* rather than "double axe", is not well-founded. Chiera, Sumerian Religious Texts , No. 1, III 3 speaks of eunuchs (, kur-gar-ra , Akk assiné) who are equipped with ba-da-ta, while Langdon Babylonian Liturgies 79, 21 speaks in similar terms. Since we know from other sources (e. g. BA v. 626, 10 : kurgarré palaqqi ; CT XIX 41 a 24 : assinnu - nas pilaqqt) that eunuchs carried axes, if not double-axes, the proposed rendering of badara (taken from Langdon, JRAS 1926, 25, no. 1) is more probable than "club"). - (b) The alternative view is to connect PD R/ PDR-y with Urartean padari " city ", which actually occurs in Ugaritic in the form pdr (lì AB vii 10 : ss Issm ahd V sb'm sb' pdr , " six and sixty towns hath he gotten as his possession, yea, seventy-seven CITIES "). This word appears to have been widespread over the ancient Near East. It may be seen again in the N. Syrian Pelhor (written P-d-r in Tothmes Ill's list at Karnak, No. 280, and specifically described as a non-Semitic native name by Shalmaneser II, Monolith 85 : Al Asur-ut-tir-as-bat sa sidi am-ma-te sa nàr Pur aitu sa eli nârSa-gu-ri ša nîsi-e mât Hat- a-ai âlPi-it-ru i-qa-bu-su-ni,</page><page sequence="16">56 Theodor H.

Hattusas-Boghaz Kewi) etc. In that case, the name would mean either 44 goddess of the city " in a gen- eral way, or specifically 14 goddess of Pethor, or Patara " (vel sim.). For the latter, cp. 14 the gods of Sajur ", i. e. of Pethor on the river Sajur, in the 44 Hittite" hieroglyphic inscription from Carchemish I A II c. 3 (v. Hrozný, IHH I 126, n. 6). As for the suffix -sìa, this might then equate with the adjectival and gentilic - aisas and -issai of Hittite texts. Forrer (ZDMG 1922, 218-9), who claims it as Luwian, cites as examples the deities Heu - assas 44 god of rain " (&gt; Hittite heyus ), Hant-asšas 44 god of truth " (&gt;Hit- tite hant - 44 be firm, true "), -Istam-asšas 44 god of hearing " O Hitt. islam - 44 hear ") etc. - If then, P-d-r-s-s-a is really to be connected with RS. PDR¡ PDR-y , the goddess will be a vegetation-cum-fertility deity. And as the mother of the Apollo-like S-j-w, she will correspond to that originally Asianic mother-goddess who is known to us from Greek tradition as Leio/Lato. Now, according to that same tradition, Leto bore Apollo in Lycia (v. Gruppe, Griech . Myth ., 332), and in Lycia it was customary to call men, and hence gods, by metronymics rather than by patronymics (v. Herodotos I, 173 : xaXéouGi oblò xwv |ít1T8Qíov éavcovç, xai ovxì oblò xcõv JiaxÉQCôv). Moreover, the capital of Lycia was Patara , and Apollo himself was known as Patareus (cf. Horace, Odes III 4, 64 ; Ovid, Metam. I, 516 ; Herod. I 182 etc.). AH this accords with what we find in our present text : the god is Apolline in character; he is named by a metronymic; his mother is PDRŠŠA, which may well mean 44 she of Patara That the goddess is not called specifically LetoJ I ato is readily explicable ; Leto/ Lato is itself really nothing but a title, deriving from the Lycian lada 44 Lady, Queen ", on the analogy of Semitic Ast (4ł Woman") for Asherath in RS V AB d 84 and of Hurrian Alla-ni-s , which Brandenstein has shewn to mean 44 Lady '* (ZDMG 1937, 571, n. 1 ; in addition to Bo. 9250, If., al-la-ni e-le-na-sa 44 Lady in heaven" which he quotes, I would cite Bo. 2618 III 23 : dISTAR al-la-a-i and the Nuzu text, AASOR XVI 50:30: dIŠTAR al-la-i-wa-aš-we, as well as the theo- phora Al-la-wa-ah-ri of SMN 113 : 7 and Al-la-i-tu-ra-hé of Gadd 55, 10; v. L. Oppenheim, AfO 1938, 154 b). Sumerian uses DAM in the same way (Langdon, Tammuz and Ishtar , p. 7, n. 1). In connection with this deriv- ation from Urartean patari and with the apparently Cypriotic character of the god S-s-nty it is worth recalling that according to Bork ( Sprache von Alasija , p. 14), the word may actually be recognized in the Eteocypriotic malore (= watore) of the Amathus bilinguals, where it seems to render the Greek jióXiç 44 city ". Friedrich, however, doubts this identification (Einfüh-</page><page sequence="17">A Canaanite Magical Text 57 also found. It is likewise common in later Phoenician (v. Cooke, NSI 33) and South Arabian inscriptions (v. Conti Rossini, Gloss . s.v., p. 114b). On this view, the style b-n P-d-r-s-s-a would be comparable with the similar form with 2 often used in Phoenician inscriptions to indicate that a given deity is of foreign provenance. Examples are: CIS I 90,2 : Vno " Rashaph-Mukal of Idalion"; CIS 1 139, 1 : Dttwa DDWn " Baea(l)-Sha- men, of the Isle of Hawks ". Analogous also is the Greek form Ze-ùç l| At&amp;ijç (v. Cook, Zeus, I, 249, 836-7) (4). As for the name P-d-r-s-s-a , the final element might then be comparable with the - isa which appears in so many Hittite and North Syrian toponyms, e. g. : Balhu-issa, Sar-issa, Bi~ gaitiar-issa, Dadd-assi-s, Hakb-issa, Mutamut-assa , Nett- assa, P alapa l-assa, Sulup-assi-ì, Uru-usìa, ĪVast-iisa-s , etc. This was a common Asianic ending, and has long since been identified with the -oooç of toponyms preserved in Greek sources (v. Bilabel, Gesch. Vorderasiens und Aegyptens , 245, 281). Such Carian instances as e. g. Tymn-iss-os, Sam-assi-s , Imbr-assi-s (cf. n. dei Itnbramos ), Arl-issi-s, Arty-assi-s, Ardy-ssi-s, Arbe-ssi-s (collected by Sayce, TSBA IX, 121) may also be cited (2). The basic element may still be the pdr " city " mentioned above (cp. "IP "city ", as the name of the capital of Moab, Numb. 21 : 8; Isaiah 15 : 1 has the synonymous T¡5). In view of the prob- able identification of s-s-m with Apollo (v. supra), it is not impossible that S-s-m b-n P-d-r-s-s-a is the exact equivalent of the Greek 'AjióXtaov IlaxaQéuç (3). The invocation of foreign, and therefore exotic, deities is a rung ins UrarL , p. 30). It may be noted that according to du Mesnil and Albright, the actual name P-d-r-s-s-a may be found in the RS text 1929 XXIII r. 5: ipdr ss s , but this is surely wrong, for analogies suggest that ss there means "six", the text reading: I Pdr ss s[uri] "for PDR six sheep " (for sg. sun , cf.

On this view, which is adopted by du Mesnil and Dupont- Sommer, both S-s-tn and P-d-r-š-š-a are hypocoristica, while the style is explained from the Akkadian mär ilüu ("son of his god") in the sense of " votary, devotee". The dif- ficulty here is that the equivalent of már ilisu in the dialect of our inscription would be ^Kmp not nSlt«*p, and this reading is epigraphically excluded.

The former equates with Akk. zvaklum which was used to denote the &lt;ł chief justice " of the mother city, Aššur (v. Lewy, ZA, NF II, 1925,24; OLZ 1926,759 ; Goetze, Kleinasien , 70. n. 23). According to a document published in Babyloniaca IV, 1911, 65, No. 1, he was recog- nized as the supreme legal authority in the colonies. The latter term equates with Akk. rubá* um which denoted the native chieftain in the several colonies (Goetze, op. cit., pp. 71-2). The compound expression YT 2*1 recalls the frequent juxtaposition of rubá' um and álum (city) in Akkadian texts, e.g. BIN IV 112:33; TC XIV 41: 19 f.; KT BI 18 rs. 17 f. (Goetze, p. 70, n. 22), and is comparable also with the later Palmyrene KYI H KVHPp (Ledrain F. 3) on which v. Clermont-Ganneau. Ree. Ill, 22, 107-9; Lidzbarski, Ephemeris, II 87. This parallelism of ^21 and 2"! with the termini technici waklum and rubďum, and their occurrence in a document which actually conies from an Assyrian colony (viz. Hadatu = Arslan Tash) clinch our interpretation of the former word. In his editio princeps , du Mesnil reads [DJBHp bï YT 2Y. , taking Tí to be an error for "I of, but Albright's amended reading of line 16 (viz. tPK for tPp) has shown that the relative pronoun in this dialect was tPK rather than 1.

The cumbrous accumulation of genitives in the phrase DttHp ^3 311 is readily explained by the fact that 11 31 , as a stereotyped compound, was construed as virtually a single word. b) pK Lord of the Earth. The restoration is here proposed for the first time. Du Mesnil reads pK J[D] .... 4 4 the lord of the face of the earth", and Albright n^K3 pK J[D " among the goddesses (who are) mistresses of the face of the earth ". This last, however, depends upon taking dSk as " goddesses and, as we shall see presently, this is incorrect. The style pK [IK corresponds to the regular title of Marduk, bel mátá ti. In Lamashtu II i 50, he is invoked in the same manner as is his Assyrian counterpart here, by the simple style bêl mátâti, without direct mention of his name. Cp. also Uttukê limnûti, V iii 30, 54: nil *Bêl bél mâtâti lû tamâtu , " By the life of Bêl, lord of (all) lands, be thou exorcized ". Comparable also is the Ugaritic ^3T pK (I AB i 42; iv-v 4; II AB vi 11 etc.), where ^3Î means 44 highness, prince" (&gt;ļ/tat - Akk. zabâlu il be high", like Heb. &gt;ļ/#tM). c) pin rm, The Consort of H-w-r-n. Du Mesnil has already recognized in pin the Canaanite god pin whose name survives in the Biblical [1in JVI (Joshua 16:5 etc.; Egyptian Biti- Hwrutiy LXX BaiOíÓQtov). Thanks to Egyptian, and now also to Ugaritic sources, the nature of this deity can be pretty closely determined. The standard discussion is that of Albright in AJSL LI1I, 1-12, but this can now be supplemented. Albright points out three references to H-w-runa in the Egyptian Papyrus Harris. In the first (i. 7) he is combined with 'Anat as one who renders impotent the fangs of wild beasts. In the second (ii. 1), he is a protecting shepherd. In the third (ii. 2), he is invoked to forefend hurtful beasts from a field. He is thus a deity who protects by being able to inflict damage. These passages are now amplified by an Ugaritic text cited by Virolleaud (RES 1937, 36 ff. ; v. also, Dussaud, Syria, XVII 394) from the yet unpublished second part of the Legend of Keret. H-r-n (so written) is there invoked to " split open" (ybn ; cf. Ar. ) and break { ysbr ) a man's skull, along with the goddess 'Ashtareth. Here again he is a deity of assault (l). (£) Virolleaud and Dussaud's attempts to combine Hrn ybn with an Avqowxç Tajiveíaç (Hõrõn of Jabneh) in an inscription published by Plassart, Les sanctuaires et les cultes du mont Cynthe, p. 279, are improbable. De Vaux</page><page sequence="22">62 Theodor H. Gaster H-w-r-n- is thus a virtual equivalent of Rašaph (note the similar pairing of the latter with 'Anat, and v. my note, AfO 1938, 148), who is, in turn, the West Semitic counterpart of the Babylonian Nergal, god of plague and the netherworld. In support of this is the fact, duly noted by Albright, that his name may mean literally "(He of) the Pit" (cf. Arab, hauran ), and thus correspond to Nergal = Sumerjan NE.URU.GAL, of roughly the same connotation (4). This being so, the " consort of H-w-r-n " will be the counterpart of EREŠKIGAL, wife of Nergal and mistress of the netherworld. With this accords the fact that just Ereškigal is indeed invoked in magical incantations down to a comparatively late period, e. g. Pap. Paris, Wessely 335, 7 : jiaQaxaTaTtöejiai vjaIv tovtov tòv xaraôeopiôv deolç x^ovíoiç 'YveajHYaôcov xat Kovqx) IleQaeípóvQ 'Eçeoxiva^ - B. M. Pap.

In point of general comparison, reference may be made to the similar invocation of netherworld goddesses in Latnashtu I iii 41 : u-tam-me-ki d Nin-kar-ra-ag ab-rak-kat Ê-kur (" I invoke against thee the goddess Ninkarrag, mistress of the netherworld"). It should also be noted that pin IltPK is a virtually exact rendering of the name EREŠKIGAL ! Epithet: Díl tMt, Whose mouth (' utterance ) is perfect . The correct reading (as against du Mesnil's DTH tPp = ?) is due to Albright, but his rendering " whose utterance is true " does not bring out the complete meaning. DTI tPK is to be compared with such Akkadian expressions as e. g. K. 2107, 15: AMarduk sa tûsu ellit (Marduk whose spell is pure); Utiuké limnûti III 265: tâka ellu''pîka e lin. Cf. Tallquist, Maqlû, p. 121. Compare also the frequent reference to the pû ellu sa AEa (pure mouth, i. e. utterance, of Ea) in Akkadian magical texts. The point is that the deity is the master (or, mistress) of the effective spell, - the Akkadian bèi sipli and the late has recently sought to interpret^» as y bn łł O son", and this has been endorsed by Albright (BASOR 70, 23). However, in the RS Poem of Dan(i)el, I 114-119, 128-133, ybn similarly occurs as a parallel to ysbry and has been plausibly explained by Montgomery (J AOS LVI 444) from Syriac b-y-n (and, be it noted, Arabic ; cf. Heb. pa) " to spilt ". I therefore see this meaning also in the passage cited. (4) Virolleaud would also find H-r-n in the RS Hurrian text, Syria 1937, 127, B. 12-13: eli hm en hrn et Tsbs ... This we regard as very doubtful. hm may be a verb (cf. Mitannian Letter I, 93: ha-a-ar-ri-eniï).</page><page sequence="23">A Canaanite Magical Text 63 Jewish Dtf Sys (" master of the divine name").

The are the countless hosts of netherworld demonesses who constitute the harem of H-w-r-n. They may be equated with the Greek 'Eçivúeç and Latin Furiae (Furies), who are similarly invoked in charms. For the title &lt;4 co-wives of H-w-r-n cp. in a general way, Aeschylos, Choiphoroi 393 (of the Erinyes) : Tvçawíôfç vcqtcqcov ; Orphic Hymn 68 : 3 ļimtai. They are associated with Hades (=: Hwrn) and Persephone (= Ast Hwrn ; cf. Orph. 29 : 3, IIA.óvccôvoç ôápiaç ; Euripides, Alcestis 746 : "Aiôov vúpupfl) in Iliad IX 569 ; Aeschylos, Eumenides 72, 416. The word mat is, of course, the Hebrew fTjat II ; Akkadian serritu, and S. Arabian X)B Dr. C. H. Gordon has pointed out to me that in the Old Testament (I Samuel 1:6; cf. Lev. 18 : 18) rnX is used to describe the character of the co-wife vis-à-vis the primary wife, and is not an absolute term. In view of this acute observation, it is clear that the suffix in *mat must refer back to pin m , and is not to be taken proleptically, as referring to Ba'al, - the construction adopted by du Mesnil and Albright. For the invocation of infernal deities in incantations, cp. Pradel 21, 11 : evxe^elTai Rúqioç õ 0eòç ¿yvéXoiç cuiotó^ioiç xal JiaQoòcóaovavv {jjiãç àYyéXoiç xaQTOQ0iJX0iç (The Lord shall consign you unto angels which cut off, and they shall deliver you unto infernal angels). In contrast to the 4 ( sevenfold co- wives of the Consort of H-w-r-n " are the 44 eightfold consorts of Ba'al ". These are demonesses of the supernal world, regarded as constituting the harem of Ba'al. The distinction thus approximates to that between Igigi and Anunnaki in Akkadian magical texts. In other words, we have what amounts to a blanket formula comprehending all evil powers, above and below.</page><page sequence="24">64 Theodor H. Gaster III.

The following clause DttHp bs T7 311 üb K 33 tal 'b ITO WK will then be very naturally epexegetical : " Ašur hath made a covenant with us, governor (tal - waklum ; v. supra) of the divine beings and chief of all the holy ones M.

Compare also Lamashtu I i 18: utanamêki .... i láni rabüti la lamé u irsitim summa ana bít annâ tatürima.

IV. The Magical Figures 1. The grotesque figures which accompany our text (4) are not purely or- namental, but possess a very definite magical significance. Indeed, they are the core and essence of the entire charm. Such figures are the usual thing in amulets of this kind, from the Lamashtu-plaques of ancient As- syria, down through later Greek and Aramaic texts, to the modern Jewish " Kimpettzettel " (= " Kindbettzettel ") (2). The purpose of them is to scare, or even destroy, the demon by the sight of his own image, or that of a power superior to himself. 2ģ The former idea is a commonplace in folklore. It recurs, for example, in the mirrors frequently borne by African medicine-men to forefend evil spirits, and in the widespread superstition that the painting, drawing, or even photographing of one's image may encompass one's destruction. Sir James Frazer, in his Taboo and Perils of the Soul , chap. II, pp. 93 ff. (es- pecially, p. 100), has traced the idea through primitive cultures, and accounts for it on the grounds that a man's image, like any object closely connected with his person, is regarded by the primitive mind as a vessel, or vehicle, of his " soul " or individuality (3). We need not assume, of course, that this basic idea was always consciously realized. A superstition - as the very name implies - is essentially a survival or carry-over , and in the (4) The figures were incised before the text. This is apparent from the manner in which the characters of the letter are disposed on the tablet. (2) For the Lamashtu-plaques, v. Thureau-Dangin, RA 1921, 190ff. For the Aramaic texts v.

Where magical plaques are embellished with pictures of gods or other superior powers, the purpose is, of course, obvious. The face of the god or power acts as a warning to evil spirits. Literary expression of this idea may be found in the Old Testament in such passages as Ps. 34 : 17 D13T jnWJ JrnaiS jņ mn' »» '• the face of YHWH is against evildoers, to cut off their remembrance fom the earth"; J Jer. 44:11 DD2 DfeMJJn J V T - T T • : • nnsnS " Behold, I set My face against you for evil, and to cut off the whole of Judah Ezek. 14:8 11*10 TWDnV44* mnn tfWft 0Ç W01 UI will set My face against that man... and will cut him off from the midst of My people''. As often, the idea enshrined in a figure of speech also finds expression in other than verbal symbolism ( 1 ). 4. The custom of drawing such pictures on limestone plaques, or of fashioning limestone figurines and inscribing incantations upon them (vir- tually the same thing) is mentioned expressly in Assyrian literature. Thus Lamashiu , I i 10, II ii 8f. speaks of inscribing "the spell of the daugther of Anu (i. e. Ishtar) " on either a slab of limestone or a figurine made of that material (siptu már at dAnim ina eli [sc. gissi] tasattar ), while Zim- mern, Ritualtafeln, 45 + 47 50 -|- 41 etc. (*) gives detailed instructions for fashioning magical images and writing spells upon them. 5. Closely connected with the representation of demons, or of superior powers, is the express mention of their names. The two things go together, for the name possesses precisely the same potency as the image. These two things constitute the essential " virtue " of a spell, the actual formula being secondary. If for instance, as in the present case, a god or protective spirit has compacted with a votary to guard him from demons, the outward sign of such compact, which alone renders it effective, is the exhibition to the demon of the divine or angelic name and/or image. The " ban " pro- nounced on evil spirits has, for this reason, always to be pronounced in the name of the god or protective genius (3). Four quotations, from Greek ( 1 ) Of course the divine face can also be turned toward a person in favor; cp. the Priestly Benediction, Numb. 6 : 25-6, and the Arabic expression ¿JU1 Jao " May God make bright His countenance ". The erection of a divine image in a house therefore also carries with it ideas of protection to the worshipper. Cf. ikons at the present day. (a) Edited in English by O. R. Gurney, Annals of Archaeology and An- thropology , XXII, 31-96. (3) Note in this connection that from the XVth century B. C. the Name , and possibly also the Face, of the god was hypostatized on Semitic soil. Thus, an Ugarit text designates the goddess 'Ashtareth as sm 2ťlt 44 Name</page><page sequence="30">70 Theodor H. Gaster and Semitic sources, will suffice to illustrate this familiar point. The first is from the Greek charm, Allatius, pp. 133f. (= Pradel, p. 91, n. 2), where the demon speaks as follows : 5?tov etoiv tá ôcòôexá (¿ot) òvó^axa... xal xò ovopux oov, Surívie xal üivóócoQe, ov jat| eloeXdco 14 Wheresoever be my dozen names... and yours also, O (Saints) Sisinos and Sinodõros, there durst I not enter! " (£). The second is from the Jewish Kabbalistic work, the Zohar (Wa-ethanan, 263, 2): in .T1?

The third is from the modern Jewish " Kimpettzettel " (2), a charm hung up in the lying-in chamber to forefend Lilith "and all her gang" i"6h DD SDÌ. The of Ba'al " (Virolleaud, RES 1937, 39), - a style which recurs in the 3rd cent. B. C. inscription of Eshmun'azar of Sidon, line 18 (v. Cooke, NSI, p. 37). In OT, cf. Isaiah 30:27 pmap K* m.T-00 nin " Behold, YHWH'S name comes from afar", etc. The hypostatized Face is seen by Virolleaud (Syria 1934, 311) in the Ugarit text, Death of Ba'al , i, 14, where the god Y-d-d is seemingly described as the pn , " Face M, of the god EL G-z-r, but the interpretation is doubtful. Pn ITI, " Face of Ba'al ",is a common ap- pellation of the goddess Tanith on Punic inscriptions from Carthage (v. Cooke, NSI, p. 132). In OT, cf. Isaiah 63:9 (LXX text), "13t JÓ B^to «in ttSorm inansa MNťln • ÍUB - " In all their tribulation it is no messenger ° T T : T : v : T : T • t - ° nor angel, but His Face that rescues them.

Our fourth and last illustration comes from the modern Samaritans of Nablus (Shechem), Palestine. In reponse to an inquiry whether they be- lieve in a child-stealing Lilith or Ghoul, the writer received, in 1940, the following interesting statement from the priest Abisha* (Naji), son of Pinehas : nxt inpS : o'jnart Dana» na-ian mSon niainaa lanar* p-i : f2) -ipx nrt -laiS ¡'K :d3-ûx oki tow »» bt »otp rw (3) (!) itwr /wai prw maya bbnn&gt; dot ua»o * bv 003.1 Sjn nun bv lSril inp* fao " There is no basis for this. The people get all the virtues of divine blessing by having the priests write out for them the words of the Priestly Benediction (Numbers 6: 22-7). They derive this usage from the statement of God, praised be He, anent Aaron and his sons, viz. 4 Set My name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them'. In accordance therewith, they take such scripts and hang them upon the mother and the children In the light of these quotations it is apparent that the figures which accompany our text must stand in direct relationship to the gods and demons mentioned in it. 6. The connection between the images and the demons named in the inscription has been recognized by all the previous editors, but it is due to Albright that the winged sphinx has been identified with KT1W , " The Winged One", rather than with the goddess (!) * Athe, as the name was originally read. The she-wolf swallowing the child is, of course, the demon "1ÖK Tlpjn , " She Who Strangles the Lamb In connection with these identifications, however, there is a point which ought to be made. We have seen above that WW, "The Winged One corresponds in other cultures to a bird (e. g. the Arabian screech-owl, the Greek 'Oqvíoç, the Latin avidae volucres , the Armenian "foul eagle", the Malayan langsuyar , the Jewish broxai or night-jar etc.). It follows, therefore, that the representation of this demon as a winged sphinx is due solely to a later identification of it with a mytho- logical figure (viz. the " cherub M) common in contemporary art. In other words, the folkloristic tradition underlying our text is distinct from that which inspires the illustrations, the latter being merely an attempt to portray the dramatis personae of the inscription in terms of artistic conventions current in the 8th-7th century B. C. (4) Montgomery, who obtained the text from the late Prof. Richard Gottheil, does not recognize its source, but supposes that it came from a bowl. Nor was Gottheil able to declare its origin, although it was the document actually reproduced by him in the article Amulets in the Jewish Encyclopedia ! (*) The regular Samaritan form for Heb. (3) The original text of Numb. 6 : 27 has</page><page sequence="32">72 Theodor H. Gaster 7. If we are on safe ground in the identification of the winged sphinx and she-wolf, the problem becomes more complicated in the case of the anthropomorphic figure on the reverse of the plaque. This figure represents a curious blend of Assyrian and " Syro-Hittite " elements, for while the costume is Assyrian, the posture and the introduction of the brandished axe and the dirk at waist are clearly copied from contemporary portrayals of the " Syro-Hittite" supreme Storm-god (cp. the reliefs from Zenjirli, Carchemish and Babylon ; Pl. II) (*). The identification will therefore depend on whether we regard him asa u Syro-Hittite " god invested with Assyrian traits or an Assyrian god invested with M Syro-Hittite " ones. In the former case, we may see in him either (a) with du Mesnil and Dupont-Sommer, the obscure P-d-r-s-s-a of lines 2-3, patron god of S-s-m (hypocoristicon ; cp. Biblical •»ODD) (2), owner of the plaque (8), or (à) with Albright, the depotentized S-s-m, regarded as a demon. Both of these deities were, as we have seen (supra, p. 53 fif.), of Cypriotic or " Syro-Hittite " provenance. The Assyrian color- ation would then be due only to the fact that the artist lived in the Assyrian colony of Hadatu (Arslan Tash). If, however, we prefer the second alter- native, it may be suggested that the figure represents the god Ašur, whose name we have now recovered in line 10 of the inscription and by whose authority the spell is worked pïl IHS ItPK »dS? dSķ 'b fHÎD). The 11 Syro- Hittite " traits would then be due to the fact that the artist took as his model contemporary representations of the "Syro-Hittite" high god, but the Assyrian coloration would show pointedly that he was intending to portray the Assyrian counterpart of that deity. In other words, though taking " Teshub " as his model (4), he takes pains to dress him in the raiment of Ašur to guard against any mistaken identification. (*) The Zenjirli and Babylonian reliefs are reproduced from Koldewey's Die hettitische Inschrift etc. (WVDOG, 1), 1900. The Carchemish relief is taken from Hogarth's Carchemish , PI. B, 11. A prototype of this style may be seen in the Ras Shamra relief of the Storm-god (XIV cent. B. C.) in Syria XIV, PI. 1, though the god there brandishes a club, not an axe. This, however, may have been a later de- velopment, for in the mythological texts, of earlier origin, he is sometimes called Aley-Qrdm , meaning, according to one interpretation (Virolleaud, Syria XII, 336), " He who is puissant with the axe " (cp. Heb. DYlg; cp. Asianic AapQavôeúç !). (*) Cp. analogously such hypocoristica as Ugaritic Rsp (Bauer, 56 : 12), Biblical (I Chr. 7 : 25) and Bibl. Pļļfe (I Chr. 4 : 22) from the names of the W. Sem. plaque-god Rašapu and Šarrapu. (*) In this interpretation, fl7K p is taken like Akkd. már itisu " votary , but this would require 'Sk p. However, the last letter is blurred. (4) As a matter of fact, most •' Syro-Hittite 99 male deities are so por- trayed while an hieroglyphic inscription on altars erected by King Tudļia liyas IV (c. 1250 B. C.) at Emir Ghazi and Eski Kisla etc. describes the god</page><page sequence="33">A Canaanite Magical Text 73 This view is strongly supported by the consideration that if, as Albright supposes, the artist desired to portray the foreign god S-s-m, the very thing he would have wanted to stress, in representing him as a demon, would have been his alien and exotic character (4). Seeing, therefore, that his model was indeed an alien " Syro-Hittite" deity, there would have been 110 point in deliberately " naturalizing " his outlandish costume. As it is, how- ever, he carefully substitutes for the thigh -length jerkin of the original the " full dress" cloak and tunic more familiar in Mesopotamia; instead of the pileus, he draws the typical Assyrian headgear of the period (2), and he elim- inates altogether the characteristic snow-shoes with turned-up toes. For these changes, it would seem, there can be but one explanation: the artist was doing his best to point out that, though using a " Syro-Hittite " model, his desire was to draw an Assyrian god. This applies also, though with less force, if the artist were trying to portray the " patron deity " P-d-r-s-s-a . In that case, we might perhaps allow for the Assyrianization on the grounds that, to a man living in Hadatu, P-d-r-i-s-a as a patron deity would come to be virtually identical with Ašur. The fact that he was not seeking to depict that god as a demon might excuse his taking pains to disguise the originally foreign costume. It may be observed also, in connection with the proposed identification of our figure with Ašur, that although the dirk at waist and the brandished axe are taken over directly from the " Syro-Hittite " original, the former does indeed appear in Assyrian religious lore as the special emblem of Ašur. Thus, in the Cappadocian texts, frequent mention is made of swearing " by the dirk (patru) of Ašur " ( e. g .J. Lewy, Tablettes cappadociennes , III, 269 : 35, 270 : 52, 271 : 41, 272 : 22 etc. : mahar patrim sa Aššur sibūtini niddin, " before the dirk of Aššur we give our testimony ", or of " producing" this dirk in the ceremony of taking oaths (e. g. I. J. Gelb, Inscriptions from Alishar atid Vicinity , No. 2:1: patram sa Aiur iési[a]nitn, patram nusési). Similarly, there is mention in these texts of an analogous metal object, called suga - Apulunas (Apollon?) as "god of the axe v. Hrozný, Archiv Orientální, 1936, 177. (*) As is well known, when depotentized foreign gods are cited as de- mons in magical texts, the writers are generally careful to preserve the exotic appearance of their names ; v. Montgomery, pp. 70-3. This is analogous. Moreover, it must be remembered that foreign costume is the most distin- guishing mark of the alien. Cp., significantly, Zephaniah 1 : 8. (2) The fleur-de-lys which surmounts the headdress may be taken as the N. Syrian emblem of royalty (v. Stanley Cook, Religion of Ancient Pal- estine etc. Schweich lectures, 1925, 57). Originally, it was probably a symbol of immortality, or indesinence. That, at least, seems to be its significance in Hellenic cults of Hera and Herakles (v. Farnell, Cults of the Greek States , I, 28). In Aegean art, it is sometimes combined with the double-axe (A. B. Cook, Zeus, II, 524 f.). In Egypt, the lily symbolizes immortality. Cf. also Vergil, Aen. VI, 883 f.</page><page sequence="34">74 Theodor M. Gaster riauíH (as yet unidentified), which was likewise an emblem of Ašur and like- wise used in the ceremony of adjuration (cp. the expression Sugariam ta - òâlum(l), and see on the whole subject Oppenheim, AfO 1939, 3-12-6) (*). The presence at Babylon, in later ages, of a god equipped with dirk and axe is expressly attested in the Apocryphal Epistle of Jeremy, verse 15: ¿X&amp;i ôè éyxeiQÍÓiov ôe|i$ xal nétaxw, eaircòv Ôè ex jioAì^ou xal Xxiatcov ovx ¿leXeiTai, "He hath a dirk in his right hand, and (hath) also an axe, but cannot deliver himself from battle or the assault of bandits' It should be observed also that the portrayal of a protective god or genius bearing arms against evil spirits is a common feature of amulets in all ages, so that there is no reason for assuming at once that such a figure must necessarily repre- sent a demon. In this connection, reference may be made especially to the series of ancient Assyrian texts which prescribe the making of prophylactic images (Zimmern, Ritualtafeln , Nos. 45, 50, 41 + other fragments =. O. R. Gur- ney, Annals of Archaeology and Anthropology , XXII, Nos. 1-2, pp. 43 if.), for it is there very frequently specified that the images are to be those of genii carrying arms. The following passages may be cited : Gurney, I, Ob v. 2, 7 ff. : sibitti salmé ilAni sibitti a-gi-e ratnâni-sù-nu [ap-ru lu-bu]-us ramáni-sú-nu lab-sü ina kigalli **bini [tuš-zaz-su-n] u- ti [ina qâti imni- sà-nú] qul-ma (3) s i parr i, [ina qâti sutnéli-sû-nu potar sipaĄri na-su-ù (4). 4&lt; Seven images of the Seven Gods crowned with their proper headdresses, (4) The expression is reminiscent, as Oppenheim points out, of surinna nasáhu, in a similar sense in documents of the IJammurapi period (e. g. CT.~II, PI. 9). Making due allowance for the obscurity of the word D2 , is it not pos- sible that a similar ceremony among the Hebrews explains that famous crux interpretům, Exodus 17 : 16: ŤI ÏTO pStJJ» ITO'1? ¡TOS bp , i. e. "For a hand has been placed upon the kes (throne??) of Yah as a token of eternal war vowed against 'Amaleq"? This suggestion would gain in strength if, as many have proposed, we read D3 for DS, i. e. " A hand has been placed upon the symbol (cf. surinnu) of Yah " etc. (*) In later Assyrian texts, the dirk gives way to the staff (sibirru; e. g. Sanherib, Const. 5 : sibirru ezzu of Ašur ; v. Frank, Bilder und Symbole babš-assyr. Götter , p. 26), just as at Ras Shamra the original axe of Aleyan- Ba'al gave place to the club. The symbols of axe, spear and sword similarly alternate in the iconography of the Greek Zeus (v. A. B. Cook, Zeus, II, 704 ff.). That Yahweh was regarded likewise as wielding a battle-axe is deduced by many commentators from Psalm 35 : 3 "UDÌ IWI fTlTļl , where the final word is equated with the Scytho-Persian oáyoQiç, (Herodotos, 1, 215 etc.) and the verse rendered : " Grasp thou shield and buckler, and rise up in my help. And draw forth spear and axe to encounter my pursuers". The sword of Yahweh is mentioned in Deut. 32 : 41, Isaiah 27 : 1 and other places. (3) Or kul-ma, with Gurney?

Budge, Amulets and Superstitions, pp. 274 if.), while similar in sentiment are the following words from a Maudaean amulet published by Mrs. E. S. Drower in J RAS 1939, pp. 397 ff. (') : .HOW K'MJ"Wp K31 Kin .TOBI' .TODI "IMI D»Kp "IKwVl K"OJ Kin ntwcn B«*p innovi B'jS .¡TOO KWI iť«K "He, the man who stands upon the ether, the righteous, the guarded, Yusmir, the great primordial light is his name, with a shining hammer (3) in his hand rose up and smote the ma- gician, the sorcerers and the demons ". There is also another point which may perhaps be adduced in support of this conclusion, namely, the dis- position of the pictures in relation to the text. The winged sphinx and she- wolf occur on the obverse of the plaque, where the principal characters mentioned in the text are RTIDP , " The Winged One ", and 1DK flpjn, " She Who Strangles the Lamb". The anthropomorphic figure, on the other hand, occurs on the reverse, where the principal character mentioned in the text ( 1 ) Gurney renders "scimitar". Robert Eisler has suggested "boome- rang", seeing in its resemblance to the shape of the gamlu the origin of the name gimel given to the third letter in the Sinaitic-Phoenician alphabet. (*) I transcribe into Hebrew characters. Mrs. Drower uses Roman letters. O Al (8) In support of this rendering, cp. Syriac ILoJ "hammer". Mrs. Drower draws attention, however, to another Mandaean word (obviously derived from San " consume "), meaning a "consuming ray of light ". If that be the sense here (somewhat unlikely, in view of the verb rPHKÖ), cp. Ps. 97 : 3, 4i A fire goeth before him, and burnetii up his adversaries round about ".</page><page sequence="36">76 Theodor H. Gaster is the god Ašur. It is reasonable to suppose that the close relation of il- lustration to text which obtains in the one case should also obtain in the other. The anthropomorphic figure would thus be none other than Ašur. It may be observed also that, on this assumption, the disposition of the figures acquires added effectiveness. The demon first sees his own ugly image, sufficient to scare him away. Then, the reverse of the tablet is exhibited to him and, as a coup de grâce , he beholds the image of the god by whose terrible power ("TIĎ, $ópoç) his evil machinations will be frustrated! Addendum . On the question of the double-axe and the sword of Ašur (supra, pp. 55, 73 f.) see now Bittel-Naumann-Otto, Yazihkaya (= WVDOG, No. 61), 1941, pp. 87, 102 f. This work, reference to which is due to Father A. Pohl, is unfortunately still inaccessible to the writer. - Significant for the identification of Sumerian badara is the text B.
