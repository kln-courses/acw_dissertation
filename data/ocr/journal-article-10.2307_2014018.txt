<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DATA OF CONSCIOUSNESS AS ESSENCES ABOUT a decade ago Mr. Santayana revived the Aristotelian term "essence"; his Skepticism and Animil Faith contains a long disquisition on essences, contrasting the term "essence" with " existence, " and with " intuition "-consciousness being, in his view, an intuition of essences. His just published volume, The Realm of Essence, will throw further light on what has become one of his favorite concepts. Meantime Mr. Strong and I have been using the term and de- fending from various angles the doctrine that the data of conscious- ness are, as such, mere essences; i.e., that they are not necessarily ex- istents, mental or physical. Strong's view is most clearly presented in his Origin of Consciousness and in his essay in the co6perative volume, Essays in Critical Realism. My view was outlined in the last two sections of my essay in that co-operative volume, and was presented more fully in the opening chapters of Mind and its Place in Nature, as well as in several magazine articles. I believe our views to be identical, so far as the essence-doctrine</page><page sequence="2">570J RJOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY itself goes. Indeed, the doctrine is a very simple one; and I am sure that we agree in rejecting the alternative views held by other thinkers. What has been the subject of long debate betwixt us- particularly between Strong and me, since Santayana is not much inclined toward disputation-is the question as to what terms and propositions best express and convey the view. We have wavered a good deal here, being discouraged now by this misunderstanding, now by that. Strong has several times repudiated earlier versions of his view, seeking always the perfect and final expression. I am myself rather of Santayana's opinion, that all expressions of philo- sophic doctrine must be literary rather than exact, and that all of our numerous versions of the doctrine come to the same thing when understood in their real intent. Since there is no agreement as to the meaning of philosophic terms, an unfamiliar view must be ex- pressed in varying phraseology, in the hope that some turn of phrase, sooner or later, will strike a spark in the reader's mind and suddenly give the view that initial plausibility without which it will not get a hearing. But this has its disadvantages. These varying verbal explica- tions offer tempting targets for the critic. It is easy, by taking isolated statements, to discover apparent contradictions, and to make deductions which lead to patent absurdity. I do not mean that the objections thus raised are gratuitous; they point to verbal dif- ficulties which must be overcome before the doctrine can be gen- erally understood. But all this dialectic remains external. For however clumsy, or misleading, our phrases, however open to attack our terms, they are, after all, but the verbal expression of a theory which in itself is definite and clear-cut, a theory, moreover, for which we have adduced powerful arguments-which our critics seldom show signs of having noticed! The doctrine has lately become quite a storm-center of discussion, though mostly of this dialectical sort. The most that one can do is to try to show that current criticisms are based upon misapprehen- sions. It is not to be expected that any positive conversions will thereby be made; but possibly a reader or two may be incited to go back to the fuller statements of the theory. The only thing really worth while in philosophy is to steep oneself in a doctrine until one gets into the spirit of it, beyond the barbed-wire entanglements of language. But if criticisms by able thinkers remain unanswered, it may be thought that they are unanswerable, and the doctrine may suffer discredit. In a forthcoming article in The Philosophical Review I have answered criticisms of the doctrine from the pens of Professors Sellars, Calkins, Ducasse, and Macintosh. Here I propose to take</page><page sequence="3">THE DATA OF CONSCIOUSNESS AS ESSENCES 571 up some points made by Professor Boas in a recent article entitled The Datunm as Essence.1 This article is addressed to Strong and me; and in my reply I shall penetrate at some points beyond the essence-doctrine itself, which we share with Santayana, to the meta- physical theory which is peculiarly our own. At the outset, Mr. Boas calls attention to "an assumption which is vital to the whole theory, namely, that what we think of is idenl- tical with what we perceive, that there is no essential difference between sensation and thought." This assumption, he says, we do not discuss; and he himself does not accept it. . . . Now, of course there is a difference between sensation and thought. In sensation, essences are brought before the mind usually with more vividness and in greater detail than in thought or imagination. The reason for this is that in sensation, as everyone knows, outer events are affecting the brain through the sense-organs, and thereby setting up more cerebral activity than is commonly excited from within. These cerebral states are physical or mental, on our theory, according to the point of view from which one is speaking. It is by their "projection" that perceptual essences are brought before the mind. In thought, also, the somewhat slighter mental states are "projected." But it is a fact, with which every theory must reckon, that what we think of may be identical with what we per- ceive; i.e., the very same essence may be brought before the mind in the one way as in the other way; else we could never think or talk about what we see and hear. The very same essence that is brought before your mind may be brought before my mind; else we two could not talk about the same thing. This fact, by the way, constitutes an excellent argument for the truth of our doctrine. For if the status of being a datum were an existential status, your datum (what you are perceiving or think- ing of) could not be identical with my datum, for the reasons which have led Broad, and Bertrand Russell, and others, to assume private spaces for different people's sensa. Certainly your datum of today could not, strictly speaking, be identical with either my datum or yours of yesterday. If Mr. Boas takes data to be, as such, exist- ents, he very properly refuses to believe that what we think of is identical with what we perceive. For no two instances of existence are identical; even if exactly similar, they are numerically different. But if the status of "givenness" is not an existential status, the same object can be "given" to consciousness over and over again, in different ways, and to different people. If, then, it is proper for us to say, as everybody does, that different people, at different times and places, think and talk about the same thing (and this, in 1 This JOTJRNAL, Vol. XXIV, p. 487; Sept. 1, 1927.</page><page sequence="4">672 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY some cases, the very same thing that 'exists in its own right, inde- pendently of our thinking and perceiving), this language implies that these different acts of perceiving and thinking do not create, or light upon, different existents, but that they all focus upon one and the same thing. Doubtless, Mr. Boas would say that the datum is a different existent in each case, but that each of the data has a "transcendent reference" (this is his phrase) to a single thing; and that our popular language is therefore inaccurate. But we think the pop- ular language accurate, and his machinery too complicated. We do not think of something, and then, because that something has a transcendent reference, infer the existence of something else; we think directly of the thing itself. So far as I can see, on Mr. Boas' theory we could never really think of the same thing at different times, or think of the same thing that any one else is thinking of. We could only think of something that has a transcendent reference to what we are trying to think of. . . . But surely the "trans- cendent reference" is an aspect of the very process of thinking of something; when we have thought of it we have already made the transcendent reference. Cognition gets all the way across in one jump, it does not create intermediate existents. It is the object at the further end that is the datum. . . . I understand fully how the facts of error, of dreaming, of imagination, etc., have led thinkers like Mr. Boas to believe that our data are a separate class of existents from those independent objects that cognition is trying to reach. But here again our essence-doctrine saves the day by showing that in the cases where our data are not independent ex- istents they are mere non-existent essences; so there is still no need to assume any other existents than the organism, with its states and reactions, and the physical things that surround it. How can a distant object, existing in its own right, become a datum of some one's consciousness? How can the same thing be- come your datum and mine? How can it be now a datum for perception and now a datum for concepttion? It is precisely to answer such questions that Strong and I have written the books above referred to. I can not even summarize our theory here. But the bearing of our theory upon Mr. Boas' point is that, while there is a physical and psychological difference between perception and thought, there is no essential epistemological difference. Either process may bring an identical object before the mind; and in neither case does "bringing it before the mind" make it into an existent, if it is not one already, or create a new, substitute, existent. Essences are, however, of all degrees of simplicity or complexity. The essence "given" in a moment of perception may be far more</page><page sequence="5">THE DATA OP CONSCIOUSNESS AS ESSENCES 573 detailed than the essence "given" im a moment of conception. 'What is "given," what is our datum, in conception, may then be only a part, or aspeet, of the total essence, or complex of essences, given in perception. But if that aspect, that character, that es- sence, is identical, that is enough. It is that essence that we are talking about as the same. Mr. Boas thinks we have failed to explain why perceptual es- sences are concrete and vivid while non-perceptual essences are not. Perhaps what I have said may serve to remind him of our explana- tion of why they are more vivid-or rather, as I should say, more vividly brought before the mind. And they are not necessarily more concrete. The data of conception may be perfectly concrete, as when we conceive some particular object. What he really balks at is the idea that any essence can be concrete. But that is because be has been misled by our use of the term "universal," and has refused to take seriously our repeated asseverations that essences may be as concrete as you please. He quotes with ineredulity my statement beginning "But of course what I am aware of may be a particular. That particular is, then, my 'datum,' the'essence 'given' to me. The term 'essence' need not be contrasted with the particular, or the concrete, or, in- deed, with anything. The class of essences is the inclusive class, covering anything that can be mentioned." - Surely, he says, I am exaggerating; if the term is used in such an inclusive sense, it is meaningless. ... No, it is extremely useful to have a term which we can apply to everything, without raising the question whether it is an existent or not. Without such a term, I do not see how we could have expressed our doctrine, which seems to us the correct solution of the so-long disputed epistemological problem. The con- troversy has raged back and forth: Are the data of perception phy- sical existents, or mental existents? Our answer is, they may be physical existents, or aspects of physical existents, or they may not be. In any case, they are essences; that is all that we can say about the whole class of data. So of non-perceptual data. Anything you can mention may be a datum of consciousness, and, indeed, is a datum for you when you mention it; the fact that it is a datum implies nothing else about it, implies nothing whatever, that is, save that it is just this descri'bable essence, and that it is "given." True, we contrast essences with existents, which sounds as if existents were not essences. It would be safer, though clumsier, to speak of mere essences versus eistents. For every existent is "a describable somewhat " and that is the definition of "essence. " But not every "describable somewhat" is an existent. The relation be- tween the status of existence and the status of being-an-essence is im-</page><page sequence="6">574 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY possible to define, I fear, perhaps impossible to understand. Some- times we say that existents are "embodied essences," sometimes that every existent "has" an essence. Considering what it is, it is an essence; the fact of existence is a superadded fact. Only a very few of the infinite host of essences ever attain to existence. In the definition, the word "describable" is inserted to focus at- tention upon the n1ature, the character; because it is a difference of nature, of choracter, that distinguishes one essence from another. And, I suppose, every essence is describable in some terms, how- ever incoherent or ambiguous, or as yet uninvented. But it is as purely adventitious to essences to be described, or mentioned, or per- ceived, as it is for them to exist.... Mr. Boas, however, thinks we are mistaken in that belief; he finds that many essences are "ef- fects or products of the human equation," e.g., toothaches, visceral sensations, and anthropomorphic gods. Indeed, we speak of the "fusion" of sensations to produce sensible qualities, and Mr. Strong wrote two articles in Mind on "The Genesis of Sensible Appear- ances." . . . But both Mr. Strong and I have been at pains to ex- plain what we mean. Only existents can, literally, be fused, or created, or born. Nothing can happen, or be done, to what does not exist. To speak of the "genesis" of an appearance is to speak of the events that cause an organism to become conscious of that essence. It is always the gi'venness (or the existence) of an essence that is to be explained. There is never anything to be explained about es- sences themselves. Mr. Boas thinks we can not mean this; for "unless the process (of fusion) is a real one operating upon fusible elements, it is of little value to their theories." . . . Certainly there is (if we are right) a real process going on, in the realm of existence; and we have described in some detail what we conceive this process to be. We believe that there would be no "appearance" of essences at all, unless there were psycho-physical processes going on. But we think it essential to distinguish between this machinery, which is behind the scenes, so to speak, and the series of essences of which it causes us to be conscious. It does, indeed, seem to be true, as Mr. Boas contends, that one datum "is causally related to " another, "is modified by" other data present to the mind, etc.-which would seem to prove that they are existents of some sort. . . . But remember that, on our theory, these causal processes are going on in physical things, including the organ- ism. It is the seeing of the new essence which is caused, in the case of "fusion," not the essence itself. It is the seeing of this particular mirror-image that is caused; and it is caused by the physical thing reflected, together with the physical mirror, and the organism, not</page><page sequence="7">THE DATA OF CONSCIOUSNESS AS ESSENCES 575 by the essence "given" (seen) as the physical object, which may be quite different from the physical existent, and at best does not include the factors which are really the causes of the seeing, viz., the jumps of its electrons from one orbit to another. The trouble goes back, I think, to the fact that it is hard to make people see that there is a distinction where they have not been accustomed to make one. For us there are three categories in cog- nition, three essences involved: the essence which exists as the object to be known, the essence which exists as the mental state of the knower, and the essence which is "given," which is "before the mind," which one " sees, " or " feels, " or what not. It is this third essence which is non-existent, except as it coincides with the first or the second essence. But it is this third essence which is our datum, and which, therefore, is usually supposed to be the one sure and self-evident existent. And that natural, but false, suppo- sition, throws the epistemological problem into hopeless confusion. We have been at fault, I think, in using the term "essence" too exclusively of this third group of essences, our data. For example, Mr. Strong, says, in the Origin of Consciousness, p. 175, "The es- sence is the vision-of-the-object which we get in cognition." This, of course, is not a definition of the term "essence," it is a statement about that particular essence which is the daturm in cognition. Later he says, "An essence is the logical shadow of anything without its substance." That, too, is not a definition, it is an attempt to state the relation between an essence-which-exists and the existent-that- has-that-essence. . . . If our critics will distinguish between what we are saying about one or the other of these classes of essences from what we are saying about essences in general, they will not fall into the error of supposing that essences are some new and queer sort of being to add to the confusion of existence. The exact opposite is the fact: the concept of essence is the simplest possible concept, and the use of the concept enables us to reduce the number of existents which many philosophers feel obliged to believe in. Mr. Boas thinks that it does not enable us to escape "representa- tionism," "for as long as the datum is not the whole object, so long as there are parts of the object which can not be given, those parts are represented by what is given and one's theory of perception is dualistic." . . . But how can any one suppose that the datum in perception is ever the whole object! In the nature of the case, perception can not give us the details of the insides of things-of that enormously complicated dance of electrons and protons of which physics tells us. If the possibility of being an epistemological monist depended upon our being aware of " the whole object," no one could be monistic.</page><page sequence="8">576 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY What we do say is that the essence of which we are aware may be a part, or aspect, of the total essence (or complex of essences) that exists as the physical thing. In so far as the two essences coincide, perception is veridical, and epistemological monism is a fact. In view of the enormous amount of error or illusion, in perceptual experiences, and the obviously partial nature of the most veridical perceptions, this is all the epistemological monism that can be had. To be sure, Mr. Boas believes that "the impossibility of the identity of data . . . and any part of a physical object can easily be proved." The proof, however, rests upon the fact that the datum is, as we describe it, a universal, whereas the physical object is a particular; the essence is timeless, the physical object is in time; and these are incompatible properties. The difficulty, however, is merely verbal. The term "universal"s was applied to essences in the attempt to explain the difference be- tween "essence " and "existence." Any essence, however concrete, any "somewhat" that you can possibly describe or imagine, may conceivably exist at more than one time and place, or be "given," be a datum for a consciousness, over and over again. An existent, on the other hand, though it is loosely said to endure in time and to move in space, is really composed of existent events each of which has its one particular locus in space-time. So, as contrasted with a bit of existence, any mere disembodied essence, however particu- larized, may be called a universal. We used the term "concrete universal" to avoid just this misunderstanding. But I see that our use of the term has given trouble. I have, as a matter of fact, been wary of using it myself, and I shall steer clear of it in the future. As to calling essences "timeless' and "spaceless," I am more obstinate. What is meant is that they are not, as such, existent in time or space. It is not incompatible with their nature to be existent, and when they attain existence they attain a spatio-tem- poral locus. But it simply is not an essential part of their nature to have that status. In other words, "timeless" and "spaceless" do not mean "never located in time and space," but merely "inde- pendent of any particular location in time and space." Some essences, to be sure, have a temporal or spatial character as a part of their very being; they may even be, precisely, temporal or spatial characters. But it is not of the nature of even such es- sences to be existent in the spatio-temporal existing universe, else the Ontological Argument would apply to them all. The essence "this speech a hundred hours long" is, in our sense, as "timeless" as any other essence; i.e., the fact of there being such a mentionable essence does not prove in the least that any set of existent events</page><page sequence="9">BIOLOGICAL OR PSYCHOLOGICAL? 577 that we might call a "speech" ever lasted a hundred hours. That essence may never have a locus in time. And the essence "this snake a hundred feet long" may never have a locus in space. In other words, it is to that set of relations between existents which we call space-time that we refer, when we say that it is not a part of the nature of even such essences to be in space or time. They are homeless unless and until, by the accidents of existence, they do find a home. On the other hand, they may find more than one home. Heaven forfend, but there might conceivably be more than one in- stance of "this speech a hundred hours long" or of "this snake a hundred feet long," each instance being a different existent, but always the same essence. If any one will invent less ambiguous terms in which to discuss these matters, much trouble will be saved. Until then, we must just muddle along, trying patiently to explain what we mean. For we can not get to the really important discussion, the discussion of the reasons for thinking this doctrine true or false, until we can get the doctrine understood. DURANT DRAKE.
