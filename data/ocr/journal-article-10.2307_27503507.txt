<plain_text><page sequence="1">Is the End Nigh?: internationalism, Global Chaos, and the Destruction of the Earth. Graham Lyons, Evonne Moore, &amp; Joseph Wayne Smith. Brookfield, VT (USA): Ashgate Publishing Company, 1995. 281 pages. Hardcover ISBN 1 85972 218 0. Robert A. McConnell University of Pittsburgh INTRODUCTION After being awakened in 1982 while on a trek through the wilderness of para psychology, this reviewer was convinced that "the end is nigh" (McConnell, 1983, pp. 117-145; 1987, pp. 207-221). Nevertheless, he welcomed the task of reading a book that questioned his conviction in the hope that he could change his answer to "Not yet." The book by Lyons, Moore, and Smith (hereafter LM&amp;S) will not be acceptable to those who still sleep, but it will fascinate those few whose life-guiding urge is to know reality and the future as fully as is possible by language-bound reason. We are given in this book by LM&amp;S a survey of the optimistic and pessimistic literature of futurology. This is a definitive work: factual, balanced, and generally accurate. But it is incomplete in that it ignores the most important determinant of the future of civilization, namely, man himself: his dual nature and his genetic heritage. Of this, more later. One feature setting this book apart from others of its genre is its Australian outlook. Its examples and arguments are drawn largely from Australian experience, but its conclusions are universally true or false as the case may be. Printed in En gland, this book comes without jacket and has no foreword. The title page tells us only that it was written by three geographers from the University of Adelaide, which is odd because there are chapters that show advanced knowledge o? physics and economics. In their opening chapter LM&amp;S present the major conclusions of the book as questions to be examined from various points of view in later chapters. Their schol arly ambition is shown by 730 end notes and references, 200 pages of text and 143 blocked quotations within the text. The index, however, is inadequate. The authors' general procedure is to present opinions dealing with various aspects of each ques tion and then to say where their own predilections lie. This review recapitulates their conclusions, category by category. The somewhat surprising thesis of this book is that internationalism is a crucial contributor to the present world crisis. The authors aim to show that the one-world Please address correspondence to Prof. Robert A. McConnell, A234 Langley Hall, Uni versity of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260.</page><page sequence="2">83 BOOK REVIEWS aspirations that most of us share are foolish and that the geo-economics of transna tionaiism will not dominate geo-politics. Instead, in the years to come, civilization will battle civilization for dwindling land and natural resources, while culture will battle culture within those nations that are culturally divided. The authors argue that modernization (i.e., the adoption of technology) does not imply Westernization. Present Australian foreign policy is mistakenly guided by the belief that Australia's future lies with East Asia. By and large, the East Asian cultures do not share Western values of individual equality, human rights, the rule of law, democracy, and freedom of speech. One sees already an emerging anti Western Confucian-Islamic alliance based upon political as well as economic expe diency. We cannot hope to change ancient cultures to match our own. Indeed, what the West must accept is that, worldwide, the choice in many countries is not between totalitarianism and democracy but between totalitarianism and anarchy. Nor are international disputes resolvable by a shared desire for peace. The Arab-Israeli conflict is over resources as much as religion and will not be resolved by yielding to the Palestinians the West Bank (with an aquifer holding a large part of the water of the Jordan basin) while the Israelis are draining most of the water from that aquifer from within Israel. Although this book is international in its standpoint, its ideas speak to internal national problems as well. The rise of midwestern USA paramilitary militia in revolt against federal government regulation follows inevitably from the imperatives of advancing technology and rising population density. We must explain that to the militia. THE MIGRATION OF DISEASE The authors examine disease epidemics, current, past, and future, and how they depend upon population movements. Attention is given first to the AIDS pan demic, including details not known to the general public. Among the authors' more widely known conclusions: AIDS in the USA is transmitted primarily by anal inter course and will not pose a serious threat to the United States unless it mutates, e.g., to be transmitted by mosquitoes. It is pandemic in the undeveloped world because of heterosexual promiscuity and primitive medical conditions. The controversial origins of AIDS are discussed at some length. Its worldwide spread is the result of the globalization of business, but, more especially, of immi gration and tourism. Its progress is described and predicted in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Effects upon First World countries will be primarily indirect but nev ertheless disastrous, as by the collapse of Third World economies and the resulting migration of people. Barring the discovery of a practical vaccine, nothing can be done about the course of the disease in the Third World. A short general history of the spread of disease begins with leprosy. Europeans brought smallpox, measles, and swine flu.to the Americas and received in return the gift of syphilis. Australian problems with the importation of communicable dis eases receive particular attention?surprising to those of us a hemisphere away. The future of communicable disease is viewed with alarm: A new virulent strain of influenza has been identified in horses and asses in China, and this may prove to be as lethal as the strain of influ</page><page sequence="3">84 POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT enza that killed over 30 million people at the end o? the first World War. Across the globe there are a number of viruses?Junin, Sabia, Machupo, Lassa, Dengue, Hanta, Rift Valley Fever, Oropouche?that could be unleashed upon the white Western world, [p. 34] [The world experiences] about 220 million new malaria cases a year, with a million deaths in Africa alone being caused by this disease. Malarial parasites are becoming increasingly resistant to drugs. . . . [p. 35]. AFFLUENCE AND ENTROPY In Chapter 3 the authors examine in reverse order two questions about sustain able economic growth: Is it thermodynamically possible? If not, what are our op tions? The authors distinguish here between "development" (i.e., technological re finement), which is presumably indefinitely possible, and "growth," which they be lieve must be negative if the environment is to be sustained. However, in later chapters "development" includes growth, because that is the way pro-growth econ omists invariably use the word. Pursuing familiar themes, LM&amp;S compare developed-world and Third World consumption, concluding that, even if the developed world were to cut its present consumption by 80%, all remaining sustainable resources would still leave the Third World far behind. The authors present at length the position that, quite aside from considerations of equity, the developed world must promptly abandon affluence. There are some obvious places to begin: planned obsolescence (e.g., unrepairable household ap pliances), trivial technology (e.g., motor-driven tooth brushes), obscene luxury (e.g., private yachts). More generally, we must abandon our junk lifestyle in which satis faction is achieved by maximizing material possessions. Conceivably, this might be brought about in a lifetime by education, but not in the few remaining years before it will be forced upon us in socially disagreeable ways. The salient point is made that we are currently proceeding in the wrong direc tion. Conserving might be achieved by education as a national/local activity. The international capitalist system toward which we are racing has an insatiable thirst for growth. The second half of this chapter begins with a ten-page lecture on the immuta ble principles of thermodynamics?a noble effort, including everything from Gibbs free energy to the Boltzman equation defining entropy in terms of probability. The main fallacies among popular interpretations of entropy are then discussed. This is all a bit much for any reader who has not had an advanced course in physics. Why was it necessary to bring up the heavy artillery? The answer is that there are economists who publish learned treatises ostensibly proving erroneous environ mental theses that can only be finally destroyed by saturation bombardment. The authors demolish the foremost of these misconceptions in an intellectually satisfying manner, but for most readers perhaps an appeal to common sense would have served as well.</page><page sequence="4">85 BOOK REVIEWS The question at issue is whether, as claimed by J.L. Simon et al. (and believed by some of the most powerful rightwing voices in the United States): "There are no physical or economic reasons why human resource fulness and enterprise cannot forever continue to respond to impending shortages and existing problems with new expedients that, after an ad justment period, leave us better off than before the problem arose. Adding more people will cause us more such problems, but at the same time there will be more people to solve those problems and leave us with the bonus of lower costs and less scarcity in the long run. The bonus applies to such desirable resources as better health, more wilder ness, cheaper energy, and a cleaner environment" [p. 68f.]. Simon claims that improved production methods and the discovery of replace ment products in response to rising costs will ensure that the supply of natural resources is "not finite." With regard to a shortage of copper, for example, he says: "[Finite] can have two principle meanings,... the length of a one inch line is finite in the sense that it is bounded at both ends. But the line within the endpoints contains an infinite number of points; these points cannot be counted, because they have no defined size. There fore the number of points in that segment is not finite. Similarly, the quantity of copper that will be ever available to us is not finite, because there is no method, even in principle, of making an appropriate count of it, given the problem of the economic definition of "copper," the possibility of creating copper or its economic equivalent from other materials, and thus the lack of boundaries to the sources from which copper might be drawn" [p. 71]. We shall ignore this play upon words. A proper response by E. Cook is as follows: "The reversal of the historic cost curves for energy and materials, including food, has profound social significance. It foretells the end of economic growth based on production, the end of what Adam Smith called the progressive state of mankind. It means the replacement of a consumer society by a conserver society. It means that the hopes of the poor of the world, insofar as they are based on a desire for comfort, will not be realized. . . . "We are already into the Revolution of Declining Expectations and we are ill prepared to cope with the changes that will be needed to maintain hope and to preserve political freedom. The quality of life for many people in this country [England], once the richest in the world, is now declining, and there is widespread fe?r of the future" [p. 69]. This chapter raises in this reviewer's mind an interesting but rarely discussed question: "How long is a 'sustained future'"? Obviously, the Earth will eventually come to an end as the sun ages. Possibly much sooner, collision with an asteroid</page><page sequence="5">86 POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT will obliterate human life on Earth. Your reviewer's inclination in matters environ mental is to plan for another one thousand years rather than the 100 years most talked about by conservationists. THE SINFUL FRUIT OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE In exploring the "postindustrial information age," LM&amp;S begin by describing New Age predictions that start with the world as "'a cosmic network, a network of forces and fields, of nonlocal quantum connections and nonlinear, creative matter'" (p. 85). The authors analyze some of the sophisticated nonsense of those who prophesy a high-tech society moving towards unprecedented prosperity, equality, and freedom. Living people must have food, shelter, and clothing. It is obvious that the gurus of Utopia never had to meet a payroll. Drawing upon opinions from many sources, LM&amp;S turn their attention to "in tellectuals" as a source of our present troubles. The social sciences yield knowledge that is incomplete and inconsistent, which, when applied, generally fails to keep its promises and often results in unintended adverse consequences. Natural science, on the other hand, yields dependable knowledge, but its application is often delete rious to society. The argument that LM&amp;S present by implication, using the words of others, is that there is "good" knowledge but also "bad" knowledge that should remain hidden. Either directly, or in attempting to ameliorate unintended effects, scientific knowledge and its offspring, technology, lead to social inequities, the welfare state, the concentration of power and the withering of democracy, the emergence of an underclass, and the creation of bureaucracies who represent their own interests but not those of society at large. Cited among the undesirable fruits of science, here and yet to come, are drug resistant diseases, weapons of warfare, structural unemployment, damage to the environment, alienation of the populace, informational overload and consequent confusion, invasion of privacy, vulnerability of vital social functions to the cata strophic breakdown or malfunction of high-tech communication and management systems. These complaints are serious and justified. Paraphrased, LM&amp;S are saying that intellectuals (scientist explorers) find knowledge that intellectuals (scientist ad visers) cannot handle. What LM&amp;S ignore is inevitability. Man is the victim of his aspirations and his limitations. In his upward intellectual thrust there was a point of no return at the beginning of the Industrial Age, but there never was a choice point. The present is not the creation of those who mistakenly welcomed it. Scientists are not villains. They are the agents of human destiny. This is not a time for anger but for calm reflection and consultation. IMMIGRATION, PRO AND CON In the middle chapter of their book, LM&amp;S examine the question of large-scale immigration into Australia, which is currently advocated by "popularist Australian left-wing organizations, left-liberal academics, and their growth colleagues on the rationalistic] economic right" (p. 111).</page><page sequence="6">87 BOOK REVIEWS Contrary to worldwide as well as uninformed Australian opinion, Australia is not an underpopulated country but has severe problems with soil quality, water shortages, and pollution. It has already overshot its sustainable population carrying capacity and is living off its ecological capital. The authors laboriously examine seven false environmental and economic ar guments offered by proponents of mass immigration. One such argument: ... The Australian government should encourage the mass immigration of young Japanese with skills. . . . Asian migration will dry up in the next 40-50 years, "giving us that long to get the best people from Northeast and Southeast Asia" [p. 125]. Next, the authors take up five fallacious pro-immigration arguments based on national security, social justice, cultural diversity, Christian compassion, and "the natural right of families to be together." One counter-argument is illustrated by this quotation borrowed from John Stuart Mill: "Free institutions are next to impossible in a country made up of different nationalities. Among a people without fellow-feeling, especially if they read and speak different languages, the united public opinion necessary to the working of representative government cannot exist" {p. 131]. As we shall see in the next section, free immigration moves the population problem, like a spreading disease, from its source countries to all countries, causing it to grow and rendering it unsolvable. DISMANTLING INTERNATIONALISM In Chapter 6 the authors call for the "dismantling of internationalism" and the abandonment of the ideal of "one world." They recognize that "the erosion of na tional sovereignty and the creation of a global culture are largely the product of economic, demographic, and technological forces" (p. 162), and they show here and elsewhere in the book the following truths: 1. That international capitalism is an irresistible force for growth. 2. That transnational technocracy is not accountable except to the profit line. 3. That economic growth at the current rate will lead to world economic collapse, certainly within 100 years and perhaps much sooner. The authors therefore oppose "universalism" as represented by such ideas as a borderless world, voluntary surrender of national sovereignty, socialization of world resources, an international income tax, elimination of all tariff and non-tariff trade barriers, world control of the production and distribution of food, rapid industrial ization of the Third World, adoption of measures to ensure increased exports of manufactured goods from developing countries to developed countries, net transfer of technical, financial, and capital resources to the developing countries, interna tional control of a new international reserve currency, waiver of debt for the least developed countries, and the creation of a world culture where the destiny of man will become one.</page><page sequence="7">88 POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT They review how all of these actions are being ardently promoted by promi nent pundits as the way to world salvation, and then they go on: But where does this leave the problem of the global crisis?of over-population, AIDS, the resurgence of diseases, and ecological threats and disasters. The above reasoning lead us to believe that no solution is possible to the global crisis. This is not to say that the world is therefore doomed. In fact, our only hope lies in a decentralized ap proach: developing a nationalist and a locaIist perspective... . Most of the growth strategies which stand to threaten the environment, such as the industrialization of China and the consequent use of vast coal re serves, are intimately linked with being part of an international econ omy and one world?and global capitalism itself must either expand or die [p. 167f.]. China's industrial development may be "linked" with the international econ omy, but your reviewer is not aware that it has needed any encouragement from the global community. It would appear that only international diplomacy, leveraged by international trade, will allow us to convince China to leave their vast coal reserves in the ground to minimize global warming. Moreover, close international coopera tion will be needed not only for the protection of the shared environment, but also for the control of nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons of terror and for the exchange of resources not widely distributed over the Earth. This chapter is at once the most important and the most discouraging of the book. It poses the dilemma of internationalism, but offers no suggestion for its reso lution. How can economic growth be brought to a halt everywhere, and what can replace it as a goad toward international cooperation? On one point LM&amp;S offer sound advice that can be followed at once by any nation that has the will to do so. Population control can only be achieved at the local level and therefore immigration must be stopped. Their reasoning is given in this quotation from Garrett Hard in: "We shall make no progress with population problems, which are a root cause of both hunger and poverty, until we deglobalize them. Populations ... are produced locally and, unlike atmospheric pollu tion, remain local?unless some people are so unwise as to globalize them by permitting population excesses to migrate into the better-en dowed countries. ... "We are not faced with a single global population problem but, rather, with about 180 separate population problems. All population controls must be applied locally: local governments are the agents best prepared to choose local means. Means must fit local traditions. For one nation to attempt to impose its ethical principles on another is to violate national sovereignty and endanger international peace. The only legitimate demand that nations can make on one another is this: 'Don't try to solve your population problem by exporting your excess people to us'" [p. 155f.].</page><page sequence="8">89 BOOK REVIEWS THOUGHTS ON THE DISMAL SCIENCE In Chapter 7, titled "The bankruptcy of economics," LM&amp;S examine (1) eco nomics as a science and (2) current attempts by some economists to use theories of economic value to solve population problems by weighing the happiness of one group against the misery of another. Presumably, the plan of LM&amp;S is to discredit (2) by first showing in (1) that economics is not a science. What is not apparent to your reviewer is why (2) should be seriously considered. After exposing in this chapter the epistemol?gica! poverty of economics, LM&amp;S will show in the next chapter how free-trade advocates are not achieving even their immediate economic goals. Finally, in that same next and its following chapter LM&amp;S will show how transnational capitalists under the guidance of fallacious eco nomic theory are driving our civilization simultaneously toward ecological and economic disaster. As to (1) above, after giving nearly a half-century to the study of reality avoid ance and self-deception in science, your reviewer is open to the suggestion that the science of economics as taught in the universities of the Western world is without a defensible theoretical foundation and adequate mathematical structure and must therefore be judged solely on the basis of its success in forecasting. On the other hand, your reviewer has not seriously studied economics and will try to present the authors' views in this area without passing judgment. The basis for the public acceptance of economics is economists' avowed devo tion to the principle of "rationalism," i.e., to finding a theoretical argument to back each economic belief. What is at issue here is whether the economic reasoning offered as a basis for social policy is sound. The authors use the adjective "rational ist." Your reviewer prefers the word, "rationalistic." To think rationally is to use logic to operate upon facts. In the natural sciences, ideally the facts are hard and the logic tight. In the social sciences, the facts are often doubtful or fuzzy and the choice of logic, arbitrary. In your reviewer's opinion any social science that goes beyond description and attempts to justify its claims by reason should be regarded with suspicion. The reigning school of economics is variously known as "modern," "ortho dox," "received," and "neoclassical." The terms "modern" and "neoclassical" will be used herein. According to ML&amp;S, "competitive equilibrium theory" is the central concept of modern economics. Using this theory, with one or another mathematical model, economists attempt to explain how economic decisions (to buy and sell) are reached in an unregulated economy. The success of any theory depends upon three elements: its basic definitions, the adequacy of the mathematical model, and the availability of the required input data. LM&amp;S attack the validity of economic theory on all fronts, using the published criticisms of well-credentialed economists. Beyond such technical matters is the larger question of whether social policy should be based upon the satisfactions gained by the buying and selling of goods and services, i.e., upon materialism to the exclusion of other valued human activ ities of an esthetic or spiritual nature. The consensus economic theory guiding the world is "rationalistic" (as defined above), "individualist," and "utilitarian" (both to be defined). There are, of course,</page><page sequence="9">90 POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT economists who disagree with the consensus theory, but their voices will not be heeded because of the momentum of the prevailing ideology plus the simple fact that rulers and congressmen prefer to believe what is pleasant; while those who give advice know that only pleasant advice will be rewarded. The principle of "individualism" assumes that the operation of the economy can be explained by the linear aggregation of the behavior of rational economic man "whose sole purpose is the maximization of his own welfare based upon util itarian calculations. Rational economic man has fully ordered preferences, perfect information, and omnipotent computing power" (p. 177). According to modern economic theory, ". . . ail there is to social reality are individuals. There are no irreducible social entities, properties, or relationships" (p. 183). It is assumed, for example, that social organizations behave economically as the linear aggregation of their member's behaviors and that there are no social interactions that make the organization's behavior more than the sum of its mem bers' behaviors. According to modern economic theory, "each rational economic man pursuing his own selfish interests best serves the interests of all in the long run" (p. 185). The authors refute both of these ridiculous ideas by quoting from Garrett Hardin's "Tragedy of the Commons": "Let a number o? herdsmen turn their cattle loose in a pasture that is jointly owned, and soon the common will be ruined. Why? Because the pasture has limited 'carrying capacity' . . . and each herdsman gets the full benefit of adding to his herd, while the disbenefits arising from over-exploitation of the resource (e.g., soil erosion) are shared by all herdsmen. Fractional losses are not enough to deter aggressive cattle owners, so all the exploiters suffer in an unmanaged common" (p. 185]. The "utilitarian principle" in economics was first based upon the "law of di minishing marginal utility," which is the idea that "every individual consumes a particular product such that the utility derived from the consumption of the final unit of it, is equal to the cost of obtaining that unit, and as extra units of a commod ity are consumed by an agent, the utility/satisfaction gained from each unit will fall" (p. 187). This formulation of economic decision theory has been under theoretical and empirical attack for more than a generation, but the various proposed substitutes, e.g., "revealed preference theory," in turn, lead to unacceptable paradoxes. The authors conclude that "utilitarianism is bankrupt": The point of marginal utility theory and revealed preference theory was to justify epistemologically the theory of supply and demand. Ba logh in The Irrelevance of Conventional Economics points out that even relatively simple relations such as supply and demand schedules for simple homogeneous commodities involved "staggering diffi culties." All that is available for verification are specific observations at historical points in time. The shape of the supply and demand curves may be so intricate as to defy mathematical handling?at least by con ventional methods. They may not be smooth curves at all, but better</page><page sequence="10">91 BOOK REVIEWS represented by discontinuities. The system of equations describing such curves may not be linear. Worse, Balogh maintains that the distinction between movement along and shifts of supply and demand curves is not merely false, it is logically false.... The only way around this is for the neoclassicist to assume that people have no memories?an utterly hopeless representation of the real world [p. 190f.]. Under the subheading "Utilitarianism and Population Theory" LM&amp;S' first two paragraphs are, Perhaps the most impressive array of paradoxes facing utilitaria nism and received economics can be found in the area of population theory. Derek Parfifs Reasons and Persons is, despite his intentions, a good illustration of the limits of utilitarianism. As Don Locke points out in his review of Parfit/s book, linked with a crude utilitarianism con cerned with total or average amounts of "happiness" or "utility" is the belief that future wellbeing will increase and that there are no substan tial threats to human society that technology cannot deal with. On this basis Parfit argues that a world with 2x happy people is better than a world with x happy people provided that 2x is not so large as to pro duce less total wellbeing of the group rather than more. This assump tion generates a number of paradoxes of population policy that Parfit attempts, unsuccessfully, to solve in his book. The paradoxes which Parfit discusses in his book are the Non-identity Problem, the Repug nant Conclusion, the Absurd Conclusion, and the Mere Addition Para dox. We shall show that these paradoxes undermine utilitarian justi fications of population increases, especially by immigration. The Non-identity Problem can be illustrated by the example of a 14-year-old girl who has a child. Because she is young, it is likely that the child will have a bad start in life. Suppose, however, that the child's life would be worth living. If the girl had waited several years, she could have had a different child which would have had a better start in life. Now suppose the girl has had the child, which, as predicted, has a bad start in life. Can we claim that the girl's decision was worse for her child? If she had waited, that particular child would not have existed at all. If "causing to exist" can be said to benefit someone, then the girl's decision benefits her child. If "causing to exist" does not benefit someone as such, we can still ask: "If someone lives a life that is worth living, is this worse for this person than if he/she had never existed at ail?" The answer would seem to be "no." Does this argument give us reason to change our mind about our recommendation to the girl [p. 191 ]? This goes on for seven pages, inducing in this reviewer a feeling of nausea. Reading this stuff is a recommended educational experience. LM&amp;S conclude: Unless the rationality and social desirability of individual wants and preferences are examined, the economic process itself is inherently self-defeating. However, to examine the rationality of wants and prefer</page><page sequence="11">92 POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT enees is a sociological, political, ecological, and philosophical task. It follows that, if economics is to be a scientific study of scarcity, it can not be the autonomous, isolated science that orthodox economics largely is [p. 200]. ON FREE TRADE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES In Chapter 8, LM&amp;S discuss what is happening as the philosophy and practice of economic theory are applied to international trade. Modern economics starts with the goal: freedom and the good life for all, or nearly all, and then fashions arguments to show that this goal will be attained if nations will deregulate their internal economies and allow free trade internationally. What is found, among other effects, is that free trade is the equivalent of free immigration. It globalizes and renders unsolvable the problem of overpopulation. While free trade has resulted in profits for transnational corporations and their stockholders, the effect upon manufacturing labor and middle management is be coming ever more disastrous. Unskilled labor, worldwide, is now in one competi tive pool. Manufacturing plants are being moved to the poverty-stricken areas of the world. Arguably, this might be good in the long run if the competition were fair and could bring labor, worldwide, to an acceptable common standard of living. LM&amp;S show that this is not happening and cannot happen for various fundamental reasons that are being ignored by free-trade economists. Foremost is the fact that for most of the Third World the population density already exceeds the carrying capacity for "an acceptable standard of living," so that, barring a drastic reduction in population, the door is closed to the ideal of "one world." Laying aside this unresolved dilemma, let us examine how interna tional competition operates to cause the problems that are already upon us today. The classical Ricardian theory of free trade is based on the idea of "compara tive advantage" operating in competitive equilibrium. Between two countries each country will manufacture and export those goods which it can make most effi ciently and this will be to the economic advantage of both countries. In theory, this will work even though over-all labor costs differ between the two countries. However, classical theory assumes that capital is immobile, i.e, that capitalists will not be willing to invest in a foreign country. Today, because capital flows around the world at the push of a button, comparative advantage has become abso lute advantage, producing First World impoverishment as noted above. LM&amp;S take ten pages to describe various factors that can interfere with the proper operation of "comparative advantage." We shall first describe two in which competitive equilibrium is not attained. As regards specific items of trade, because of the multiplicity of his costs, where supply and demand are already in. equilibrium, an importer will generally prefer not to pass along cost reductions on an individual item but will charge what the market will bear. As regards the overall market, changes in currency-exchange values as driven by large-scale speculation may far outweigh general-cost changes and, of course, are not responsive to item-cost changes. For example, the annual trade in Australian dollars is ten times the value of traded goods and services.</page><page sequence="12">93 BOOK REVIEWS We turn now to more subtle considerations. For competitive equilibrium to work, as it often has within nations, competition must be constructive rather than destructive. In practice, we know that competition must be moderated by cultural kinship and by government intervention to protect the worker and the environment. Such restrained competition as opposed to cut-throat competition is not possi ble where there are: 1. Substantial disparities in culture. 2. Disparities in economic desperation caused by major differences in natural re sources or in population density (measured against carrying capacity). 3. Substantial disparities in capacity for technological growth for any of several reasons. 4. Substantial disparities in the current standard of living. In an affluent, high-cost society such as the USA, an unskilled worker cannot live contentedly or even practically at the material living standard of the Third World. The result in the First World of direct competition between First World and Third World unskilled labor is both increased subsidies to the unemployed poor and increased urban violence. The manufacturer who went off shore has improved his profit margin, but the home government is paying dearly. It is wrongly assumed by free-trade proponents that tariff-free trade means fair trade. Competition appears at every level of economic intercourse. Business can be hampered or helped by quarantines of goods in shipment, by licensing and label ling requirements, by quotas, by arbitrary technical specifications, by local taxes, tax rebates, visa restrictions, and by economic policy operating in more subtle ways. There is no end to the interference possible when a government works closely with its own businessmen. Most governments have an aggressive policy of managing trade in politically, economically, or militarily sensitive goods. While agreeing publicly to free trade, most governments violate their agreements as a matter of policy. It would be child like naivete to expect otherwise. The more open governments such as the United States are at a disadvantage relative to the more closed, business-integrated coun tries such as Japan, and this disadvantage is augmented by the childlike naivete of the economic advisers in the more open governments. One is reminded of the gullibility of Neville Chamberlain who, as one gentleman to another, was willing to take Hitler's word, although all the evidence pointed the other way. To make matters worse, as corporations become transnational, they no longer protect national interests, and governments find they are dealing with supranational entities who hold financial cards that national governments cannot match. The net result is that governments must become ever more, rather than less, involved in international business dealings in order to protect their economic interests. A major factor in the one-world argument that is ignored by LM&amp;S are the innate differences in cognitive competence among populations around the world. In economic theory, the "rational economic man" is an intellectual genius having total knowledge of the market and unlimited computing power. In free-trade discus sions, references are made to "unskilled labor" ?any further discussion being "po litically incorrect." If the world crisis is to be solved, it may be necessary to explore the implica tions of other factors. The exact figures are still unknown, but, roughly, where the U.S. Caucasian population average score is 100 on a scale with a standard devia</page><page sequence="13">94 POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT tion of 15 measuring general intelligence (Spearman's g), East Asian orientals aver age 105, U.S. blacks average 85, and sub-Saharan blacks average 75 (Rushton, 1995). While there are many aptitudes that are called "intelligence" by some psychol ogists, Spearman's g, a measure of reasoning power, is a primary determinant of success even in primitive societies, and in developed countries it is the sine qua non of prosperity. Spearman's g will be a vital consideration in the implementation of any plan for world survival, which must be understood and approved by the governments and by the people in Africa as well as in Asia. As Herrnstein and Murray (1994) have explained, increasing technological complexity combined with differences in cognitive ability are creating a two-class society in the United States, with the unfavorable consequences they describe. This situation is exacerbated by unemployment in the lower class caused by the current free-trade policy. Unfortunately, the evidence shows that variations in Spearman's g are largely determined by inheritance and are strongly resistant to environmental improve ment It now appears probable that most of the so-called "environmental" com ponent of intelligence test-score variance is caused by chaotic (noise-like) pre- or post-natal biochemical developments within the brain and is, in principle, beyond extra-uterine environmental control. (Jensen, 1996) Thus, the world population problem should be thought of as two problems: (1) The carrying capacity of many countries and of the world as a whole has already been exceeded. (2) There are too many unskilled people to be self-supporting in an advanced technological society. On the other hand, if one believes that there is no population problem and that displaced unskilled workers can, if willing, be trained for high-level jobs, both problems disappear. Thus, the heritabiiity of intelligence is a question of some im portance that is today being publicly ignored because it is not "PC." What the neoclassical economist does not seem to understand is that there is more to life than the exchange of goods and services. LM&amp;S say it this way: "'The deepest need of human beings is/ as John Gray [Beyond the New Rightl has stated, a sense of existential and social identity, a sense of place in the scheme of things, a home, a network of common practices and inherited traditions that confers on them the blessing of a settled identity. Indeed, without the undergirding support of a framework of common culture, the freedom of the individuals so cherished by liberalism is of little value, and will not long survive. Human beings are, above all, fragile creatures, for whom the meaning of life is a local matter that is easily dissipated; their freedom is worthwhile and meaningful to them only against a back ground of common cultural forms. Such forms cannot be created anew for each generation. We are not like the butterfly, whose generations are unknown to each other; we are a familial and historical species, for whom the past must have authority (that of memory) if we are to have identity, and whose lives are, in part, self-created narratives, woven from the received text of the common life. Where change is incessant or pluralism too insistent, where the links between generations are bro ken or the shared raiment of the common culture is in tatters, human beings will not flourish. They will wither, or else fall into anomlc vio lence. Insofar as neo-Itberalism has been an ideology of radical</page><page sequence="14">95 BOOK REVIEWS change, whose debts are to liberal individualism rather than to tradi tional conservatism, it has tended to reinforce the disintegrative pro cesses of modernist societies'" (p. 230]. THE END IS NIGH in their final chapter LM&amp;S examine critically the concept of ecological sus tainability and answer the question, "Is it possible?" Public concern about a sustainable future for the earth's people first appeared only 40 years ago. Since then there have been scores of commissions, symposia, and books on the subject. Prominent among these was the Brundtland Commission Report published by the United Nations in 1987. Its key objectives were fulfilling "the essential needs of the world's poor" and determining the "limitations imposed by the state of technol ogy and social organization on the environment's ability to meet present and future needs" (p. 242). Note how the limitations are assumed to be in "technology" and "social organization" and not in the environment. The Commission argued that a necessary condition for the elimination of abso lute poverty is a national annual per capita income growth in the Third World of five per cent, resulting in a five- to ten-fold increase in economic activity over the next 50 years. There was no mention of population control. H.E. Daly responded to this in 1992: "Present total resource use levels are already unsustainable, and multi plying them by a factor of five or ten as envisaged in the Brundtland Report... is ecologically impossible" [p. 247]. LM&amp;S cite with approval the following definition of a steady-state economy offered by Daly, but doubt its attainability: 1. The rate of use of renewable resources does not exceed the rate of regeneration of resources. 2. The rate of use of non-renewable resources does not exceed the rate at which sustainably renewable substitutes are developed. 3. The rate of pollution emission does not exceed the assimilative capacity of the environment [p. 250]. To cover material omitted from their book, LM&amp;S inserted at this point a six page condensation of Virginia Abernethy's Population Politics: The Choices that Shape Our Future. Rather than review a review, your reviewer has added below a summary of that part of Abernethy's book that he believes most essential to under standing the future that we face. In their final section titled "The Stillbirth of a Sustainable Society," LM&amp;S find "no evidence, despite scores of scholarly books written on the topic, that Western societies are beginning an historical U-turn and making the transition towards steady state, no-growth, decentralized self-reliant or self-sufficient societies. In fact, all the evidence points in the opposite direction" (p. 258). The authors then sketch a handful of scenarios proposed by others describing how a sustainable civilization might or might not be reached. In a final farewell</page><page sequence="15">96 POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT LM&amp;S say: "Is the end nigh? It may well be, [but] pessimistic and fatalistic resigna tion will only prove to be a self-fulfilling prophecy. We can no more accept the death of the human species, than we can accept, without struggle, our own death. Yet die we shall. {Alfred North] Whitehead observed in Science and the Modern World that: '. . . the essence of dramatic tragedy is not unhappiness. It resides in the solemnity of the remorseless working of things. This inevitableness of destiny can only be illustrated in terms of human life by incidents which in fact involve unhappiness. For it is only by them that the futil ity of escape can be made evident in the drama. This remorseless inev itableness is what pervades scientific thought. The laws of physics are the decrees of fate.' Such is the pathos and paradox of our plight" (p. 261). WHY DO WOMEN HAVE BABIES? Virginia Abernethy, Professor of Psychiatry at Vanderbilt Medical School, is an anthropologist with credentials in economics, sociobiology, and medical ethics. Her book, Population Politics: The Choices that Shape Our Future (Abernethy, 1993) includes 310 pages of text, plus 308 bibliographical references, a 20-page index, only a handful of tables and graphics, and essentially no notes. Abernethy recognizes that in the population/environment equation, population is the independent variable and is where emphasis must be placed. In the teeth of continuing population growth, any action relating to the environment can be only palliative. Your reviewer suspects that much of environmental protection activity is psychologically a denial of the urgency of the more difficult population problem. The first hundred pages of Population Politics are an anthropological study of the causes and control of population density in two-dozen cultural episodes rang ing in time from the late Roman Empire to the present, and geographically over all continents/ The study describes, by rough count, 30 premodern socially-sanctioned methods of limiting the "total fertility rate" (children per couple). These include sexual abstinence supported by superstition and taboo, legal and cultural restric tions on marriage, polygyny, prostitution, primogeniture, ultimogeniture, infibula tion in the female or subincision in the male, abortion by primitive methods, pro longed lactation, infanticide, and the depersonalizatton or killing of widows. The methods of fertility control are themselves of no importance except as they show that overpopulation is an ancient problem that has been met in the past in many ways. The heart of the study is its answer to the question: "What determines The remainder of Abernethy's book is devoted to other aspects of the population/envi ronment problem, e.g., U.S. and world population carrying capacities, cultural integrity as the key to survival, grave errors in neoclassical economic theory, unintended consequences of international generosity, "one world" as yesterday's dream and tomorrow's nightmare, and ethical dilemmas that are forced upon us.</page><page sequence="16">97 BOOK REVIEWS the fertility rate?" Abemethy has been able to identify factors that increase fertility, one that will decrease fertility, and others that are ineffectual. It is for this accom plishment that your reviewer believes her book deserves an accolade as a contribu tion to our understanding of the impending world population crisis. Abernethy's findings can be expressed very simply, and they conform to com mon sense: How many children a couple gets largely depends upon how many they want, and how many they want depends importantly upon how many they think they can support. That, in turn, depends upon their optimism or pessimism about the future. Factors that increase fertility include anything that reduces economic pressure or that promises to do so. Chief among these are: 1. Government subsidies to the poor in housing, food, and education, and acting as employer of last resort. 2. Foreign aid intended to alleviate suffering. 3. Emigration of one's countrymen (by relieving population pressure and by rai sing the hopes of those left behind). 4. The intrusion of Western culture, as by missionaries, trade, or television (by destroying old ways of controlling fertility and by promising prosperity). Factors that are ineffective in changing fertility are: 1. Lowering the child mortality rate. 2. Availability of contraceptives. 3. Government exhortation or laws regulating the number of children. The only national factor certain to reduce the average fertility rate is govern ment-imposed disincentives such as the withdrawal of subsidies. The same is true for international subsidies. Abernethy's findings are unwelcome and therefore potentially controversial. (Up to now they have simply been ignored.) The importance of her work is that by a study of history it supports what some population experts have been saying for some time, namely, that the "demographic transition theory," which is the basis of U.S. and U.N. policy for controlling world population, is fallacious. Abernethy says nothing about the dependence of fertility upon the subordination of female to male because that is an incidental issue. The liberation of women from the domination of men can occur only at a late stage in the demographic transition? after cultural maturation?and that will never happen in the Third World. Briefly put, the demographic transition theory is the belief that countries such as Mexico can be economically developed to reach a standard of living and level of education where fewer children will be desired, thus limiting world population. Two flaws in this theory stand out: (1) The resources of the earth are no longer sufficient to raise the Third World to an acceptable standard of living. We are living off our ecological capital and the total population must be reduced as quickly as possible if we are to achieve sustainability before feedback mechanisms make its attainment impossible. (2) If economic development by transnational capitalism (which is the centerpiece of demographic transition) is continued, then long before a steady state can be reached, environmental strictures and population increases</page><page sequence="17">POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT inherent in the economic development process will bring world civilization crash ing to ruin. There are other, subtle flaws involving cultural characteristics and cul tural dissolution, which are explained in Population Politics. DOES MAN HAVE A SOUL? Nearly everyone who has struggled with the social problems of our time has come to the conclusion that we are living in an age of moral decay and that the devil is "materialism." For many, the guidance of revealed religion has been lost, and there is nothing to take its place. Your reviewer believes that our civilization will not long survive unless we face squarely the challenge of the dual nature of mankind. As a small beginning he offers the following essay, which will appear in a shorter form as a guest editorial in the Journal of Parapsychology (59[3]) with the title: "The Role of Parapsychology in the Re-establishment of Morality." How the seemingly disparate topics of parapsychology and the survival of civilization are integrated in this reviewer's mind, can be examined in Far Out in the New Age: The Subversion of Science by Cultural Communism (McConneil, 1995). It is commonly believed that our civilization is threatened from both ends of the political spectrum: by the power hunger of the Far Right and its disregard of the common man, and by the tribalism of the Academic Left that has permeated our universities as cultural separatism. Perhaps both of these errors of extremism can some day be reined in by parapsychology. The mistake of the Far Right is not so much ideological as it is shortsighted and selfish. On the other hand, although the Academic Left seeks power, it claims an ideological basis for its behavior and, thus, may be more immediately responsive than the Right to reason and reality. Against both errors I believe that our best hope lies in a return to morality by the universal acceptance of certain religious principles. Scientists and other persons of high intelligence who regard observation and logic as the arbiters of reality tend to be offended by the ritual and dogma of orga nized religion and in many cases develop a deep antagonism toward religious con cepts such as an anthropomorphic First Cause, the existence of a spiritual realm, and the persistence of personality after death, as well as toward the social rituals and petty taboos that we have inherited with the religions of the prescientific era. There is only one religious belief that is almost universally tolerated by scien tists, namely, that our conscious actions are not entirely determined by chromo somes and environment but that, in some sense, we are responsible for the good and evil that we do. However, even among scientists there are a few who by some quirk of logic deny "free will" even though they pride themselves on the lives they lead. This is so bizarre a combination of beliefs that it must be illustrated to be appreciated. Biology Professor William Provine of Cornell University published in The Sci entist (5 September 1988) an article titled. "Scientists, Face It! Science and Religion are Incompatible." As of 1995, he has continued to give lectures supporting this position. The heart of his thesis is contained in the following quotation (ibid.): Humans are complex organic machines that die completely with no survival of soul or psyche. Humans and other animals make choices</page><page sequence="18">99 BOOK REVIEWS frequently, but these are determined by the interaction of heredity and environment and are not the result of free will. No inherent moral or ethical laws exist.... we have no ultimate meaning in life. Later in the same article he wrote: Although no cosmic or ultimate meaning for humans exists, we can certainly live deeply meaningful lives. I am married to a talented and beautiful woman, have two wonderful sons, live on a farm, teach at a fine university, and have many excellent friends. ... the nonexistence of ultimate moral laws in no way prevents a robust and ethical basis to society. Somewhere along the line, Professor Provine's no-free-will argument loses logi cal contact with his attitude toward his own cheerful private circumstances. How can Professor Provine be so self-satisfied if his good life is entirely something that his genes and environment did to him? Does not his cosmology reduce good gov ernment and, with it, all of history to a matter of chance or predestination?thus mocking mankind's higher aspirations? Fortunately, except among radical materialists, free will is an accepted part of the culture of scientists and common man alike, even if it does not seem to be very effective as a prop for public and private morality. If one accepts free will as a fact of human nature, where is the entity that exercises it? Most scientists would say, vaguely, "in the brain." However, that is an evasion of the question if we believe that the brain is merely an assembly of mate rial neurons. Admittedly, something more is needed, but popular religious explanations are not acceptable because they violate our epistemol?gica! principles. What should we do? I believe that parapsychology has something to say about the possibility of free will and about how it might be exercised. We know that the experimental findings of parapsychology show beyond reasonable doubt that under some conditions an information transfer can occur between humans that is not mediated by sensory mechanisms. In other words, what has been called "extrasensory perception" can not be explained by any of the known principles of physics and, indeed, violates certain basic limiting assumptions of Western science. Even though we cannot yet predict the occurrence of, or conceptualize an explanation for, extrasensory perception, that phenomenon has been shown to be real using the epistemol?gica! criteria of the West. This anomalous violation of expectation, occurring totally within the concep tual space of Western science, leads inevitably, I believe, to the conclusion that we are ignorant of the cosmic nature of consciousness and that humility-before-the unknown is the only proper stance for a scientist to take in this area. I think we can go further and, without abandoning our operational principles, conclude that consciousness is our contact with a nonmateria! realm of reality that extends beyond the human body and that man has two natures, material and non material?label the latter what you will. The findings of parapsychology disprove materialism, namely, the dogma that man is matter only and is governed only by the laws of matter. Moreover, those</page><page sequence="19">100 POPULATION AND ENVIRONMENT findings show that the nonmaterial realm is accessible to scientific investigation. Let us get on with it! We parapsychoiogists have validated two important religious concepts. We have shown the duality of human nature and the reality of what may reasonably be called a spiritual realm. We have, if the truth be known, destroyed the ideological justification of the Academic Left, which is materialism. As for the Far Right, if the rest of us could agree upon our philosophic princi ples, perhaps we could convince them that their ruthless pursuit of power belies their proclaimed belief in the God of our forefathers.
