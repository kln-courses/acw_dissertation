<plain_text><page sequence="1">Fragmentation in Archaeology: People, Places and Broken Objects in the Prehistory of South-Eastern Europe. John Chapman. New York: Routledge, 2000. 296 pp. DOUGLASS W. BAILEY Cardiff University Of Western archaeologists active in the prehistory of eastern Europe, John Chapman is one of the most knowledgeable. If you need to know the story behind an artifact, the historiography of a site, or the spatial distribution of a culture group, he is the first person you should contact. Why then is this book not a greater success? Chapman sets himself an ambitious task: to weave high-level anthropological theory into the outstandingly textured fabric of southeast European prehistory between c. 7000 and 3000 B.C. The big ideas are enchainment, accumulation, and fragmenta- tion. The material record is that of Europe's first farmers, first animal breeders, and first settlers. The argument runs that spe- cial (and ordinary) artifacts were exchanged, accumulated, bro- ken, and deposited in particular, intentional ways and that these practices created, maintained, and altered social relationships. After a thoroughly engaging introduction (chapter 1), Chap- man provides much needed site location maps before he launches into a theory chapter (chapter 2) to introduce the con- cepts of enchainment, accumulation, fragmentation, objectifi- cation, personification, and, finally, to present the author' s ideas about sets of artifacts and hoards. Chapter 3, 56 pages long and full, plunges the reader into the material record by examining each category of artifact in detail and putting the case for the im- portance of fragmentation processes. In chapter 4, Chapman presents the case for accumulation and focuses on hoards and "sets" of artifacts (i.e., costume, scenes, hoards, grave goods, burnt-house contents). Chapter 5 examines people and bodies in more detail in the mortuary sequences for eastern Hungary and northeast Bulgaria. In chapter 6, the focus shifts to places and landscapes with detail provided for Danube Gorge sites and the tell at Vina. Chapter 7 summarizes and concludes the book. Many of the figures (e.g., site location maps) are very useful especially in a research area in which overviews have been too infrequent. Some figures are less helpful; a few seem to confuse rather than clarify (e.g., figure 5.7). The Gazetteer of culture groups (with dates and geographic information) will be wel- comed by many and shows Chapman's strength of detailed knowledge; bibliographic references for the key dated sites would have been welcomed. The bibliography is especially strong on the original Hungarian publications. Chapman makes his interpretation with huge, superhuman sweeps across the region and through three millennia.

From the start, the scale of the project will stagger some readers; the author's decision not to differentiate between subregions or subphases will knock others off balance. Synthetic overviews are the privi- lege of the informed outsider and Chapman contributes to this sequence as have others in the past (namely, Childe, Hodder, and Tringham). First concerns arise over Chapman's assumptions about ta- phonomy and excavation strategy. The crux of the fragmenta- tion argument is that figurines, pots, tools, and bodies were in- tentionally broken before they entered the archaeological record. Chapman makes unwarranted (and uninvestigated) as- sumptions about taphonomy and postdepositional and deposi- tional processes. Questions over taphonomy and deposition can only be answered by context-based excavations in which de- tailed recording is married with fine-scale methodologies. Ex- cavation by context, the use of stratigraphic matrices, and dry- sieving are still too infrequent in east European archaeology (though increasingly they appear on the best projects); total re- covery (e.g., of coarse-ware sherds) is met on too few projects. That many of Chapman's examples come from excavations car- ried out over the past 100 years adds to more general worries about the quality of the information with which he builds his ar- guments. There are other concerns about the artifacts chosen as exam- ples: exotics, figurines, prestige goods, and special raw materi- als. How are we to tie such special goods into the practicalities of daily prehistoric life? Similar anxiety hovers over the choice of the main case study sites: the Danube Gorges and the Vin'a Tell. By Chapman's own admission, these are not "normal" sites either in their local prehistoric contexts or in the attention de- voted to them by archaeologists. Sites such as Vina, Lepenski Vir, Vlasac, and Padina are extraordinary in the most literal sense of that word. To the best of my knowledge, none of these sites were particularly well excavated; debates over even the ba- sics of the larger-phased stratigraphy at Vinia still rage (see p. 205). Certainly, if the processes of fragmentation, enchainment, and accumulation really do drive Neolithic Balkan life, then such processes must be sought in the most mundane of activities and places. Where is the mundane? These concerns aside, many readers will be disappointed that the bulk of Fragmentation in Archaeology does not engage the potentially exciting and dynamic concept of fragmentation as a major social practice in Europe's materially most precocious three millennia. How are we to differentiate between deliber- ately and accidentally broken objects? How do different raw material characteristics affect breakage? How do different transformative technologies (e.g., pyrotechnology) affect dura- bility? What are the details of the ethnographic and ethnoar- chaeological case studies that provide middle-range links among the higher theory and the sherd and bone fragments? How does Vinia and the Gorges sites help us to see fragmenta- tion at work? Most importantly, what is the thread that runs through the theory, the examples, and the case studies and that ties the argument together and convinces the reader that broken objects are the keys to unlocking people and their places in southeastern Europe prehistory? When these questions are sat- isfactorily addressed, and there is no doubt that Chapman is the man to provide those answers, then we will be much enlightened about social practice in Balkan prehistory. *</page></plain_text>
