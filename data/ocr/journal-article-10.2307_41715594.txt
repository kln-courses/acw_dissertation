The biographical dictionary or collection of biographies has since early times been one of the recognised literary forms in Islam. Amongst standard works of Arabic literature belonging to this class we may mention the Lives of the Prophet's Companions by Ibn Sa'd, W the Biographical Dictionary of Ibn Khallikãn (2) and the Lives of Learned Men by Yãqut of Hamã. (3) Bio- graphical dictionaries were devoted to the various groups of celebrities known to the Muslim world such as wazirs and kadis, poets, philosophers, gram- marians, jurisconsults of the different rites, sûfïs and saints, and the name kitâb al fabaqât - or book of classes - came to be recognised as the technical term for works of this type. Towards the beginning of the 19th century Muhammad al Nur b. Dayf Allah öf Halfãyat al Muluk near Khartoum, conceived the happy idea of (l) Kitâb al fabaqät al kubrã by Ibn Sa'd (died A. D. 845) (2) Wafayãt al a'yän by Ibn Khallikãn (died A. D. 1256). English translation by M. G. de Slane, London 1843-71. (3) Ir shäd al arìb tia m à* rif at al adlb by Yãqõt. (died A.

His pious and conscientious labours resulted in the interesting book which forms the subject of this paper. The literary models which inspired our author appear to have been the volume of Sûfï lives by 'Abd al Wahhãb al Sha'rânï, an Egyptian mystic and miracle monger who died in A.D. 1565, and the Tabaqãt of Shafi'ite jurisconsults by al Subkí; from the former work he more than once quotes parallels to sayings and incidents recorded by him, and he refers to the example of the latter to justify the inclusion of his own father's biography amongst the lives of the scholars and saints. The book, which is known as Tabaqät Wad Dayf Alläh or Tabaqât al awltä, contains notices of about 260 men roughly arranged in alphabetical order. Thèse greatly differ in length according to the importance of the subject or the amount of information available. In point of time they cover the period roughly from A. D. 1500 to A. D. 1800, i.e. from the foundation of of the Fung kingdom to the author's own time. Their geographical extent likewise roughly corresponds to the political frontiers of the Fung: the author himself divides his territory into the two divisions of the North (siïfil) corresponding to the modern provinces of Dongola, Berber and Khartoum, and the South ($cfld) corresponding to the island of Sennar. It is along the Main Nile to the North of Khartoum and along the Blue River between Khartoum and Sennar that the dwelling places of Holy Men and the seats of learning cluster most thickly. The White Nile, we are told, had once also been a home of learning, but the schools which had flourished of old in the country between Alays and Khartoum had disappeared by the time of the author, destroyed, partly by the hunger year known as titntn lohnt W and partly by Shilluk raids. Occasionally we hear of scholars from Tãka which is K^ssala ; but the Western Sudan (Kordofan and Darfur) contributes no heroes to the biographies, whether this be due to the fact that the author excluded from his survey lands not belonging to the political orbit of Sennar, or that the countries in question were still outside the pale of Islamic tradition. Manuscripts of the Tabaqät exist in the possession öf various notables of the country : most of those seen were in a more or less tattered condition owing to the ravages of time, and a printed edition should be undertaken soon, if the (1) A.

The present writer* a few years agof caused a copy to be made by an Omdurman scribe, who unfortunately added many mistakes to those of his original,, and was incorrigibly addicted to the vice of homoiotelexton. The copy thus obtained has been collated with an ancient manuscript lent by the present head of the Dayf Allah family, and apart from a few passages still unhealed, a readable text could be constituted. The text of the different copies which it has been possible to inspect represents a single recension, and the spelling of the colloquial forms is remarkably uniform. The principal source of our author's information is oral tradition which appears to have been piously preserved amongst the descendants and disciples of each Holy Man ; but wherever he has access to written materials he makes full use of them, and he freely quotes from letters and other documents : occasionally he refers to literary compositions ascribed to subjects of his biographies. Dates he records with praiseworthy zeal whenever they are known to him. . . One of the most remarkable features of the work is its linguistic form, which makes it of unique interest to the student of Arabic dialects, though it renders the task of the translator and commentator somewhat difficult. With a bold disregard for tradition the author employed the spoken vernacular of his. country, and apart from quotations and from such classicising forms as inevitably flow from the pen whenever the colloquial is reduced to writing, the language of the book represents the spoken idiom of the eastern Sudan, or rather a form of colloquial koinl based on the elements common to the many patois and sub-dialects. It thus forms a most valuable lexicographical store, house, especially as it preserves a good many words which now seem to have become obsolete. There is no reason to believe that it was ignorance of the written language which drove the author to choose the vernacular, as the book itself proves him to have been well read in some branches of Arabic literature, and it is clear that he had received the usual training of the literati of his country who generally are able to use nahwl Arabic with some fluency and correctness. It is rather to be supposed that be regarded it as a pious duty to record the sayings of his heroes and the stories related about them in the ¡exact -, linguistic form in which they had been handed down by oral tradition, and it may be hoped that he was not unconscious of the fact that the rough and homely Doric, which so happily fits his theme, gives the book a literary merit which could not have been achieved by the use of the smooth and colourless nahwl. (l) (1) It is an interesting coincidence that an ancient Persian work of similar title and contents, theTabaqat or Sufi Lives of Ansar i , a holy man of Herat who died in A. D. 1088, is composed not in ordinary literary Persian, but in the old dialect of Herat. See J. R. A. S. 1933, p. 1 ff.</page><page sequence="4">194 SUDAN NOTES AND RECORDS* 2 . A study of the Tabaqät has been included by Mr. H. A. Macmichael in the second volume of his History of the Arabs in the Sudan. Mr. Macmichael has justly appraised the value of the book amongst the sources for the history of the period and has given a full abstract of the contents accompanied by a selection of significant passages and explanatory notes. He has been particularly happy in elucidating the dates and family relationships of the subjects of the biographies and in extracting the historical information from the text : the merit of his study is not seriously affected by a number of slips in matters textual and linguistic and in technical points of Muslim scholarship. His study however does not exhaust the interest of the book and it is the object of the present paper to give an account of an aspect of the Tabaqät which has not been fully brought out by Mr. Macmichael, i.e. to attempt a study of the religious world in which Wad Dayf Allah's heroes lived and had their being. As Mr. Macmichael says' the value of the book is not merely that it tells one for whom the majority of the qubbas that stud the Sudan were built, but that one gains some insight into the ways of living ;.nd thinking and speaking of the people of the land in the seventeenth and eigiteenth centuries. Many of their beliefs and customs, their superstitions and practical ideas, are revealed: and the fact that the author is not aiming at any such effect must obviously enhance the value of the information gained.' 3. A study of these beliefs and customs is not only of historical value, but has the interest of actuality for those who strive to understand the life and ideas of the Sudan Arab at the present day. It is true that since Wad Dayf Allah's day there has arisen an educated class whose religious ideas are fashioned in the moulds supplied by the modern Muslim world, and whose intellectual life is in contact with the schools of Cairo and India : but though the educated wage earnest war against the 'superstitions* of their unlearned countrymen, and though a flood of new things and new ideas has poured into the country ever since the days of Muhammad 'Ali, it is yet a fact that the intellectual and emotional world of Wad Dayf Alläh's heroes still lives amongst that large majority whose minds are uninfluenced by the innovations of the 'Turk'. A variety of views has been expressed by different writers concerning the part played by religion in the life of the Arab. Stress has been laid on the alleged indifference of the Beduin to the rites, and ceremonies of institutional religion - 'the Bedawi in Arabia'* says Doughty, 'passes for as good as a clerk that can say bis formal devotion, and Palgrave asserts the same'. As fat as the</page><page sequence="5">ÏABAQAT WAD DAV F- AtLAHr J$5 Sudali is, concerned it is clear from the, writings of Bruce and Burckhardt, and ¿ndèçd. frpm the pages of the Tabaqãt itself, that such prohibition^ as that of ,Vine* were . openly disregarded by the mass of the population ; from the. Tabaq£t again we learn that side by side with the world of the saints there existed a world of 'rulers and grandees'; on whom the holy ones looked much as the prophets of the Old Testament did upon most Israelitish kings. On the other hand the world has long been familiar with those outbursts of religious fçrvôur, . of which the Wáhhãbl movement in Arabia and Mahdism in the Sudan are, recent and famous examples. The truth of the matter seems to be that the. Arab is peculiarly susceptible to, the psychological experience of 'conversion', espepially where if acts .with the force of mass suggestion, and this owing to the fact that jn ; spi te of a healthy strain of worldliness and even cynicism, his. deeper nature calls for religious interpretation of the. universe and demand?. a religious sanction for all the duties which life imposes on him. A second point which needs to be stressed is that the individual, in striving to know and to be saved, requires a mediator between himself and an unapproach- able and ifcconceivable God, and it is the fact that prophets, saints and holy men are;.. conceived as mediators-- as the ivaslla indispensable to salvation-* which gives them their -peculiar virtue and explains the irresistible power with which they sway the minds and acts of their followers. . 4. While it seems possible thus to reduce the influence of fakîs. and paints to à single psychological formula, we. cannot fail to notice that the men ■who wield this influence by no means exhibit a uniform type: we find in fact that most of the currents of thought which at different times have agitated Islamic opinion have found a channel . into this.; remote backwater of the Muslim, world, and that the- . scholars and : saints -yvho fill the stage of the Tabaqât reflect in their different attitudes and typés a variety of the spiritual and intellectual doctrines which have been the subject of theological study and controversy in Islam, In view of the isolation of the country and the backward state. of learning it is not surprising that the reflection is extremely feeble, and that the subtleties of schoolmen and mystics, when transplanted to this barren soi li are reduced to the level required by .scant scholarship and crude intelligence. Amongst the followers of. Islam, as well as in other systems, we may distinguish two main attitudes towards the religious life corresponding to different psychological needs bf the human mind. On the one hand there are tliose for whòm religion in the main is a matter of the intellect, and for whom salvation lies in sound dogmatic belief and the strict observance of legal and ritual ordinances. Of this tribe are the Scribes and Pharisees whose counterpart 16 (K)</page><page sequence="6">m SÜbAN NOTÉS AŇD ŘĚČOŘĎŠ. in Islam are the theologians, commentators and canon lawyers, whose labours have created and handed down a vast body of learning directed towards a correct understanding of the sacred texts and a minute codification of the precepts derived from them. Another class of mind sees the essence of religion in spiritual experience and seeks salvation in the religions life, as exhibited in the sphere of conduct by asceticism and the annihilation of self, and in the sphere of knowledge by intuition and mystical contact with the Divine. In Islam this latter class is represented by Sufism ( taçawwuf) and the religious orders ( furuq, sg. fařtqa) which are its later development. 5. The representatives öf the two tendencies did not always see eye to eye : the champions of orthodox tradition were not unreasonably alarmed at the pretensions of those who set the flights of individual fancy above the letter of the law, while the mystics scorned the earthbound narrowness of the formalists. During the earlier period the controversy was often charged with bitterness, &amp;nd the Scribes and Pharisees strove hard to stamp the mýstics ivith the brand òf heresy and unbelief, but the catholicity of Islam has found it possible to retain the followers of both parties within its fold. The compromise was the work of al Ghazãli (died A.D. 11 II) who after gaining eminence in the sphere ôf orthodox learning renounced the world and sought knowledge and salvation in the contemplative life, 'The doctrine of al Ghazãli broke down the barrier which separated sõfism from the prevailing religious attitude, and gave it a rightful place as a normal element of the Muslim faith. He aimed at spiri, tualising the dry formalism of the ruling theology by means of ideas derived from mysticism ¿ . . . . but he parted company with the süfis in his rejection of their pantheistic aims and of their contempt for the Law/ (Gold^iher, Vorlesungen uber den Islam; p. 179), The teaching oì al Ghazãli has profoundly influenced the cpnsensus of Islam, but for practical purposes it has only produced a truce and no true reconciliation of the two opposing factions. The formalism of the casuists still prevails at al Azhar, and the mysticism of the süffs survives in a degenerate form amongst the followers of holy mein and in the organised worship of the furuq. The populace; indifferent to theological controversies, honours the memory of pantheist philosophers like IbnaL 'Arabi, and seeks the blessings^ of wonder working shaykhs, while paying due respect to the be-turbaned *älitti who expounds the casuistry of the Law. The ancient quarrel between Fiqh and Ta$awwuf had its echo in the Sudan, but the pious author of the Tabaqât follows the popular instinct tod without criticism or undue preference includes in his catalogue ot worthies all kinds and conditions of men, from the modest seeker after formal learning to the- antmotaian</page><page sequence="7">TABAQAT WAD DAY? ALLAH« 197 ( malä ma it) and the spiritual anarchist ( magdhüb), about whom more anon« 6. Nor did the quarrel appear acute to tho minds t&gt;f the majority, and many aspirants to the religious life sought to combine instruction in the books of learning with progress on the sûfï path. Most biographies give an account of the course of studies pursued by their hero and the names of the teachers are carefully recorded, for great importance was attached to the continuity of tradition and to spiritual pedigrees, and the saying held that one who studied without a shaykh could never become a true ' ältm ( mä nahsib al beyiqrã betã shaykh yibqa 'älitn). The following examples are typical of many others : Dayf Allah b. 'Ali b.' Abd al Ghan! (died A. D. 1684) ... a native of Halfãya. He memorised the Koran in the mosque of his native town, and studied the Mukhtasar of Khalll and the Risala of Ibn Abl Zayd under Shaykh al Zayn. His teacher of Tawhïd was Ahmed al Sâridï . . . and in sùfism he attached himself to ( sahab) Shaykh Daf Allâh b. Abu Idrïs. Müsá b. Ya'qöb (a contemporary of King Badi b. Rubãt) . . . He received initiation into sõfism from his father (salai j tarlq al qawm min abíh) who was also his teacher in the Mukhtasar of Khalïl, the Risàlar and the 'Aqa'id, and under whom he memorised the Koran . . , He became an imäm both in the external and the esoteric sciences. Khôgalï b. 'Abd al Rahman (died A. D. 1742) ... a native of Tuti Island. He began the study of the Koran under the Faqïra 'A'isha bint Qaddäl, studied Kaläm and sùfism under Faqíh Arbãb, and became proficient in Khalïl ( tafaqqah fi Khalïl) under Shaykh Zayn b. Saghirün : for he was one of those who combine the study of fiqh and sufism {gama ' bayn al fiqh wal taçawwuf.) In another class of cases however the external and esoteric sciences are put in opposition to each other arid the impression is gained that by some at any rate devotion to book learning was held to be incompatible with progress on the Path. We may quote the following instances : 'Abd al Mâgid b. Hamad (died A.D. 1710). After memorising the Koran under his father and studying the Mukhtasar of Khalïl under Shaykh al A'sar he succeeded his father as teacher and lived a long life during which he gained great fame . . . He received revelations of hidden things whereby he was able to read the hidden thoughts of men, Thus when his disciples Sa'd and Hammâd, sons of Faki Samïh, sought his advice as to whether they should pursue the study of Khalïl at ai Gõz, he told them them to go and marry and beget children, for their lives would bè wasted if they studied Khalïl . . . Disregarding this advice they attended eight complete readings of Khalïl</page><page sequence="8">198 SUDAN NOTES AND RECOKDS. and died . . . Once thé , Qãdl Mustafa b. Hünain went to see our shaykh: às he entered his. presence he said to himself in his heart: my parents were younger than he is when they died, and he is still alive. The shaykh, réading his thoughts, addressed him saying: by Allah, my son, I was sorely grieved at the death of your parents . . . Shaykh *Abd al Mãgid was jealous of his discip- lçs and forbade them to seek initiation into the sûfî path, saying that his tariqd wàs the Koran and the jtizb at bahr . . . His pupil Hamad b. 'Abd Allah relates: I was initiated into the path by Bedawl Abü Dilayq to* the great displeasure of my uncle ; then I saw a vision in which I beheld my uncle seizing me by one hand and dragging me. towards him, while Bedawl got hold of the other hand and drew me the other wajf : at last the prophet appeared and said to Abu Dilayq : do you contend Avi tli Walad Hamad 'about his son and disciple ? 'Abd al Rahman b. Sâlih b. Bán al Naqã (born A. D. 1708 or .1709). At first he adopted süfism and received initiation into the Path from his father, who put him through a course of ascetic exercises and bade him go into retreats for certain periods. But when his initiation was complete and he had reached man's estate he occupied himself with the study of the external sciences (al ' ulilm al zãhira) and the acquisition of books relating to them, and spent much money on teachers and scribes. The reason for his devotion to the sciences was a dream : he saw his grand father (Ban al Naqä) flying between earth and sky and his father (Sâlih) behind him, while himself was following after the two, but they motioned him to descend to the earth and he obeyed. The dream vision was interpreted by Sharif 'Abd Allah as meaning that they wished him to occupy himself with the external sciences . A list is next given of the various teachers under whom he studied. In addition to the inevitable Khalîl and Risala he read 'Aqďtd and Tagwld , Ibn 'Atâ Alláh, and the three treatises of al Sanüsi. He sent to Egypt and the Higas for books of which he owned six cupboards full. Dreams and visions are recorded .on the authority of a manuscript in his own writing: The Almighty appeared to him in a dream and addressed him, saying that he had made him a successor of the Prophets and Apostles and had given him might in this world and the next. And in another dream the Prophet addressed him as follows : my love has penetrated you as the green branch is penetrated by sap. And again: You are under my protection and those you protect are under my protection also - on them the peace of Allah in this world and the next,</page><page sequence="9">TABAQAT WAD DAYF ALLAH 199 To our minds the difference between such men and the professed sûfïs does not appear very obvious, and it is characteristic of the age and the country that even these champions of formal learning live in a world of visions and dreams arid lay stress on devotions which in their essential nature do not differ: from the exercises of the dhikr. The following extract records the protest of a man of learning against the miracle moiigering of the saints, but we notice- that no disbelief in the reality of their supernatural powers is implied. It is quoted from the notice of Muhammad ài Hamlm, an antinomian saint to whom we shall have to return later : _ It is related that shaykh Daf' Allah used to lie half the day amongst his womenfolk studying the books of learning^ for his lectures. One day his daughter Sittenâ said to him: father, the people of Walad Abu Sâdiq (i.e. IVluhammad al Hamlm) have gained power over Fung and Arabs (by their miracles); for them elephants bring doleib palms from the south country to the north. His disciples take his horses from Mandara to the river, a three days' journey in in one noontide, and bring them back with their tails still wet. But from you and may brother Mahmud we hear nothing but such words as qäl al muçannif (thus says the author i.e. quotations from books). Shaykh Daf Alláh sat up leaning on his hand and replied : The people of Walad Abu Sãdiq possess the gift of having their prayers answered and thus have gained power over the world. But at the end of time all the foundations shall stand on the foundation of your father ( äkhir al waqt gamV ai asäsät taqlf * ala asãs abüki). 7. It will be convenient to summarise in this place the studies and textbooks which entered into the curriculum of the schools. The foundation of all learning was the Koran which it was the ambition of every student to memorise without troubling himself much about the meaning of the sacred words; no manuscript copies were used in the Koran schools : the teačhér dictated from memory and the texts were written down, lesson by lesson on the wooden tablets ( lêhân , sg. lõh) from which they could be washed off, when they had been thoroughly mastered. Instruction in reading and writing thus inevitably accompanied the study of the Koran. The method of study followed a fixed tradition and the text was divided and subdivided into a number of larger and smaller sections: the progress of a student could thus be gauged from the section or chapter to which he had attained (*)• Of a practically illiterate (l) The Koran is divided into 30 guz'm, each guz' consists of two hizbt or eight rub' or sixteen thumn , or 32 kharrôba. A thumn is the length of a lesson or tablet written by an advanced student. Another division is into seven parts-sM&amp;* al dirâsa-one for each evening of the week. Note also the following expressions: bâdi, a beginner; *ûda, a second reading ; dalla ßl Qur'ân, to gò through a seçond reading ; dâris , an advanced student, 16*</page><page sequence="10">200 SUDAN NOTES AND RECORDS. person, for instance, our author says that he had read no further than the zilzila i.e. the chapter entitled Earthquake which comes early in the first section, A complete reading was called a khatma or sealing. For many the study of the Koran was the end, as it was the beginning, of their scholastic career, and the fuqarä al ' dm or students of theology formed a class distinct from the fuqarä al Qtir'än. Next to the Koran the most popular subject was Fiqht the, ritual and canon law of Islam according to the system of Malik, which was studied from two famous compendia - the Risàia of Ibn Abî Zayd of Qayrawân (died about 996 A.D.), and the Mtikhtaçar of Khalïl, a Cairo divine who died in A.D. 1365. These handbooks still form the foundation of all legal studies wherever the Mãlikl rite prevails, and the existence of modern translations into French, Italian and English testify to to their interest from the point of view of the Colonial administrator. The next subject is dogmatic theology which we meet with under the names of Kaldm, Tawliïd and 'Aqďid. With regard to the first it seems clear that the term is not used in its original significance, which indeed belongs to an earlier phase in ths development of Muslim theology, and it is doubtlessly loosely applied to what should more properly be called Tawfyld. The mutakallimdn , or exponents of Kalãm , aimed at a rationalistic interpretaion of dogma in the terms of philosophical categories borrowed from the Greeks, but the discussions and controversies to which their dialectic gave rise had long died down, and the agreement of Islam had accepted an authoritative statement of dogmas and definitions which was studied in the schools under the name of Tawhïd - the doctrine of unity. The textbook most in .vogue in the schools of the Sudan was the Muqaddima (or Prolegomena) of al Sanõsl, a Maghribine writer of the 15th century, whose three treatises on the Creed 0 Aqldat ahi al tawhïd - Ufnm al barâhtn or al sattilsïya al sughrä - al murshida or al sanûsïya al wusfä) were likewise the chief sources for the study of % Aqďid, a subject closely related to Tawhïd and consisting of a statement of orthodox dogma in the form of a creed or articles of belief W- These three subjects - Koran, Canon Law and Dogmatic Theology - were fairly extensively studied, and the comparatively few who required still further (1) In the notice of Muhammâd b. .Adlân, who taught at Tangassi m lhe Sha lglya country, it is stated that only the Umm al barâhtn was commonly studied in the Gezira of the Fung. It is remarked on as exceptional that this Mubammaçl 1?. *l§g taught the Rubra ancj the Vf usta.</page><page sequence="11">TAĎAQAT WAD DAYF ALLAti. 201 ¡earning might find teachers expounding the sciences connected with the correct methods of reciting the Koran ( Tagwld and Qiraãt) ; but other stock subjects of Muhammadan higher education such as Tradition ( Hadith ) Exegesis of the Koran ( Tafslr ) and Arabic grammar and Rhetoric do not appear to have formed part of the regular course of studies, though references are not lacking to individual scholars who are said to have excelled in them. 8. It would be altogether a mistake to take at their face value the eulogistic terms in which our author refers to the scholastic attainments of his heroes: it is true that they pursued learning earnestly and industriously, but owing to the isolation of their country they had never drunk of the main stream of Muslim tradition and their attempts to grapple with the mysteries of law and dogma are ingenuous and pathetic rather than profound. For many attendance at a 'reading* of Khalïl or the Risala was more in the nature of a devotional exercise than a serious attempt to study law, and there is a curious anecdote which shows how in this atmosphere, the authors of dry and matter-of-fact law books might come to be conceived of as competitors for the devotion of their disciples just as if they had been shaykhs of rival Tarïqas. Muhammad wad Medanï, the eponymous hero of the now famous town, had studied Khalîl and the Risala under al Qaddäl b. al Fardi, and upon the completion of his studies his shaykh placed in his charge a number of students with the injunction that he should lecture to them on Khalîl. But Muhammad wad Medanl had a dream or vision in which he saw himself writing on board a vessel, when Ibn Ab! Zayd, the author of the Risia, appeared and 'took the rope of the vessel out of his hands/ Next he was visited by a mysterious dervish who after conversing with him enjoined him on leaving 'to lecture on the Risala and give greetings to his father'; this visit was repeated a second and a third time and the visitor parted with the request that Muhammad should report the incident to his father. The father immediately understood that the visitor was none other than the prophet al Khidr, and Wad Medani forthwith began to lecture on the Risala, devoting his holidays to Koran readings under Shaykh Dať Alltfh (bil bafala yiqra lêhãn al subii %ind al shaykh Daf Alläh). His lectures on the Risàia proved a gťeat success and were attended by as many aâ 500 students. And once when on a visit to Muhammad wad al Tinqâr, the latter suggested that he might change from lecturing on the Risàia to the reading of the great book' {má ianqul le qirďat al kitâb al ¿eMr-perhaps Khalil is intended), whereupon Ibn Abî Zayd appeared in a dream in the shape of a lion ready to devour him.</page><page sequence="12">202 SUDAN NOTÉS AND RECORDS. À íew more anecdotes may be quoted to illustrate the intellectual calibre of the 'men of learning' and the kind of problems which agitated their minds. During the time of Shaykh Idrïs b. al Arbâb (the end of the 16ih century) the custom of drinking coffee and smoking tobacco had become prevalent, and though coffee was generally agreed to be lawful, there was divergence of opinion with regard to tobacco. A debate was held at Rufâ'a in the presence of Shaykh 'Agïb, the temporal ruler, between Idrïs b. al Arbâb and Sharif * Abd al Wahhâb : the former opened by categorically declaring tobacco to be unlawful, but was asked to produce his authorities : 'min rasali aw min karrâsak-d oes this come out of your head or from your book?' He replied: tobacco has been declared unlawful by Sultan Mustafa of Stambul, and the rite of Mâlik enjoins obedience to the sultan and recourse to him in cases where there is no clear text emanating from the lawgiver. Furthermore I have been informed by the Prophet that it is unlawful, a revelation to which Muhammad al Hamîm and Hasan wad Hassüna can bear witness, and even Dushayn the Judge, who smoked until the day of his death, at first declared it to be forbidden» Said Sharif 'Abd al Wahhtfb : 'for me the practice of Ďushayn is good enough'; but to clinch the argument Shaykh Daf Allah, who seems to have been present at the debate, sent to the tomb of Qcldï Dushayn to put the question to the dead man and out of the grave came the answer : 'tobacco is unlawful, bid the shaykh pray that I may be pardoned for smoking'. This is a bit too much for our pious author who remarks parenthetically that a voice from the tomb may be a miracle, but cannot be used as an argument on which to base a legal ruling (su'âl al mayyit là yatarattab ' alayh hukman (sic) sharï, inn ama hflxva min bãb al karãmãt lil awliyä). To make assurance doubly sure Idrïs referred the problem to Cairo where there were two doctors of the Malikï rite enjoying special fame, 'Ali al Ughüri andai Laqâni, who held opposite views concerning the question and debated it publicly and dramatically in one of the Cairo mosques* As soon as the Friday prayer was over al Laqânî enjoined all believers to keep their places and addressed ál UghörZ as follows : tobacco "has been brought by the Christians out of the Frankish country to cause trouble amongst the Muslimîn, and now you are stirring up trouble by ruling it to be lawful, whereas it is forbidden for three reasons: because it is an innovation {biďa), because it is wasteful extravagance and because it is burnt in fire. Said al Ughüri : as for it being an innovation what do you say concerning the wearing of garments silcH as the Prophet never wore? and as for extravagance may not a man whose alimoný for the support of his family has been fixed at three "dirhems lawfully give</page><page sequence="13">TAÖAßAT WAP ĎAYF AL1LAH. 2Õ3 them ten ? and as for it being burnt, is not coffee burnt likewise, yet may be drunk lawfully ? Al Laqãní, worsted in argument, thereupon challenged his opponent to the ordeal of mubâhala - the mutual curse- praying that whichever of the two was wrong in his ruling should be struck blind. And soon afterwards al Ughürí was stabbed in the head by a Maghrabi shaykh whom he had offended by one of his decisions and became blind in consequence. He subsequently had a vision of the Prophet which convinced him of the virtue and holiness of Shaykh Idrls and sent him ^the famous flag beáring the date of 981, and his turban and belt and length of cloth*. The debate may well be historical : for according tò Brockelmann (Geschichte der arabischen Litteratur, vol II, p. 316) Ibrahim al Laqanï, a Maliki shaykh of al Azhàr who died in 1631, composed a diatribe against smoking entitled Naçîkat al ikhxoän bint i ti áb sJiurb al dttkhäfi, while hiscontemporary'Alial Ughurî (died 1656) is the author of a treatise entitled Ghüyat al bayãn li hill mä lä yughayytb al 'aql min al dukhãn-z. full explanation of the lawfulness of tobacco in so far as it does not impair the mental faculties. ALMedawwťb/ Muhammad al Misrî (died 1684) lectured to large crowds at Sbendi on the Risàia, on grammar, dogmatic theology, the sources óf canon law, and logic ; and in: addition to his teaching work composed voluminous works 'worthy to be written in letters of gold*, amongst them four commentaries on al Sanůsťs Umm al barâhîn. Yet when one of his disciples propounded to him the problem 'whether the ostrich is an animal or a birď he owned himself defeated and set out with his disciples to Sennar, in order to discuss the puzzle with his friend 'Umãra al Khatïb who possessed a library of 'strange books on all subjects'rand in these he hoped to find the answer. Our author relates how al Medawwï was honoured and loaded with gifts by king Unsa at Sennar, but omits to telLus how the problem was solved. Saghïrûn al Shaqaläwf, who dwelt at Umm Markha and lived to an .age exceeding a hundred years, was in the habit offpermitting a wife to return to her husband after the triple divorce, without an intervening marriage to another man as required by law. For this he was reproved by ' Abd al Qãdir b. Idrls on the ground that he was making bastards of all the people. Saghïrûn referred him to his own mother who confessed that 'Abd al Qãdir himself would have to be accounted a bastard if the decision of Saghïrûn were reversed : for she had been thrice divorced by her husband, and after remaining single eight yeajVreturned to him in obedience to a decision given by Saghïrûn, and subsequently gave birth to 'Abd al Qãdir.

He is even more impressed by Ya'qub's philosophical learning as displayed in the following passage in which the concept of h ay Ma (the hyte ~ materia of the classics) is discussed : 'know then that the con trovei sy between the people of the Sunna and the materialist philosophers {al huhamiï) concerning hayüla is not as to whether it exists, or not.

Now the hayüla of our father Adam is dust, the hayüla of the devil is fire, the hayüla of the angels is light, and the hayüla of the staff of Moses (which was changed into a serpent) is wood. 9. We thus form a picture of men earnestly striving after knowledge, eager to serve the cause of religion and good learning, but hopelessly handicapped by their isolation from the great seats of learning and by their thaumaturgie prepossessions. It should be remembered that even in Càiro and Stambul the period was one of great intellectual stagnation - the darkest hour of night between the brilliant day of Baghdad and Spain and the new dawn which began with the 19th century. In the matter of obscurantism and credulity there is perhaps not much to choose between the doctors and saints of the Tabaqât and their contemporaries at al Azhar, but the former were, still further handicapped by the dearth of books, the poverty of their country and the l&gt;arbarity of their surroundings, Their services to their faith and their country should not be underestimated : it was no small thing to keep alight the torch of learning amidst a desolation of barbarism and it may be said with some truth that they were the real missionaries who established Islam in Nubia and Sennar. No doubt the Fung and Arabs who overran the kingdoms of Dongola and 'Aiwa were Muslims before their final victory, but their adherence to Islam seems to have been little more than nominal, until there arrived in their midst that first generation of scholars who started a tradition of preaching and teaching?., The Fung1 says our author, 'possessed and conquered the country of the Nuba, and early in the tenth century, the year 910, the city of Sennar was founded by king 'Umâra al Dunqasî.

And early in the second half of the tenth century Sultan 'Umära Abü Sakâkïn gave lordship to Shaykh 'Agìb al Mangilak, and early in the latter's reign Shaykh Ibrahim al Bulad? came from Egypt to the Sha'igiya country, where he taught Khalil and the Risàia ; whence learning and Fiqh spread to the Gezirp. Then after a short time came Shaykh Tag ai Dîii al BehãrZ from Baghdad and introduced the path of the süfis into the Fung country. Then came al- Tilimsânî, the Maghribine, to Shaykh Muhammad b.' Isa Suwar al Dhahab and initiated him into the sufi path, and taught him dogmatic theology ( Kaläm ) and the sciences of the Koran, such as Grammar and Tagwld and the Variant Readings etc. whence the scinces of Tawhîd and Tagwtd spread in the Gezira, for it is said that 'Abd Alláh al Aghbash and Nasr, the father of Fakt Abu Sinayna, were his pupils in Koranic subjects. Then arose the saintship of Shaykh Idrls b. Arbãb without the coming of any shaykh to teach him, though it is said by some that he studied under a shaykh who came at al Khatwâ (?). Next arose the saintship of Hasan b. Hassüna by the grace of the Prophet on whom be blessings and peace. Further there came Hamad b. Zarrüq at al Sabãb?, and Shaykh Muhammad al Mi$rř àt Berber, who taught Tagwld and Grammar and the Risàia, and his knowledge of Tradition spread abroad. All these shaykhs flourished during the reign of Shaykh 'Aglb which lasted 41 years until he died in the yearl917. (*) Shortly after his death Shaykh Saghîrûn and 'Abd ai Rahmân b. Hamadtu migrated from the Sha'igiya country to the Dâr al Abwâb (i.e., the district of Kabushia and Shendi) ; this happened during the reign of king Bâdi Ö) while authority was divided between Qañís and 'Agib b.

An interesting account of one of these zealots for the faith is contained in the notice of Hamad b. Muhammad, known as Umm Maryüm, a native of Tuti Island who was born in 1646. It is too long to quote in extenso , but a few of the more characteristic ancédotes will show how the influence of this grim puritan combated the worldliness and indifference of his contemporaries. Umm Maryüm reproved his shaykh, Arbâb al 'Aqâ'id, for reciting the prayer for the dead at the grave of a sinner, wherein he was acting contrary to the teaching of Khalïl. For a while Arbab refrained from this practice' in deference to his disciple's zeal, but at length fell back into his ancient error, wherefore Umm Maryüm left him and settled on Tuti Island. Many came to him to seek forgiveness for their sins (tftb ' alff yadayh) and on thèse he imposed harsh conditions before he would be convinced of the sincerity of their repentance, bidding them give up fornication, usury, hypocrisy, pride, envy, tale-bearing and vanity. They were enjoined not to associate with evil livers'or to give their daughters and wards in marriage to such. He insisted on the seclusion of women with such strictness that even their voices were not allowed within the hearing of men, and his disciples were taught to fix the eyes on the ground when passing a woman. He opposed the excision practised on the pudenda mulierum (which nevertheless still remains the custom of the country) declaring it to be contrary to the sunna of Islam. Penitents were required to give away in charity any illgotten gains in their possession, and to fast till the flèsh raised up by forbidden or unlawfully acquired food had wasted away. His sons-in-law were obliged - under pain of divorce - to leave thèir wives in their father's cáre, lest his daughters should be corrupted in strange surroundings, - a custom which, I am informed, is still observed by the Maryûmâb, as the descendants of Umm Maryüm are called. And if any of the people of the Court (al salfana) would have dealings with him, he insisted that ' they as well as their attendants and servants and children should know the six pillars of belief- (arkân al imän) and the five pillars of Islam. W (1) The five pillars of Islam arc (1) the confession that there is no God but God, and that Muhammad is the Prophet of God (2) the five daily prayers (3) payment of the3poortax (4) the fast in Ramadan (3) the pilgrimage to Mecca.

Taking into consideration the general lawlessness of the times, the rapacity of princes and rulers, and the low level of public and private morality, there can be no doubt that the influence of the zealots and puritans was highly beneficial, however short-lived it may have been in individual cases. Though superstitious fears largely account for the estimation in which, they were held, they often used their power in a way which made for a better and more civilized life, and it is interesting to find this impression, formed from reading the Tabaqât, confirmed by Burckhardťs account of El Damer, that little hierarchical state* governed by the Magãdhib, a family of Holy Men, whose founder Hamad b. al Magdhüb (died 1776) is the subject of a short notice in the Tabaqât. The date of Burckhardt's voyage (1814) takes us right to the end of the period covered by the Tabaqât, but it is reasonable to assume that his description is equally valid for an earlier date, and that the influence of the Magãdhíb at El Damer provides an analogy to the influence of earlier fakîs in other localities. Burckhardt was struck by the contrast between Berber and El Damer, a contrast entirely to the advantage of the latter town, which not only was a centre of learning, but also enjoyed better government and order under the benevolent rule of her religious men. Even so, he was 'somewhat surprised to find that, notwithstanding the austerity of the Fakys a great number of Bouza shops, and houses of debauchery, were established all over the town'.

Reference may lastly be made to the severe discipline of Kbalwa life, which not only required disciples to render every kind of menial service to their shaykh, but imposed upon them ascetic habits and long hours of study. The notice of 'Abd al Rahmân b. Asid (died 1715) preserves the formidable time table of a Fakts1 College, in which lessons began immediately after the morning prayer, and continued with little interruption until the morning prayer of the following day. Put in tabular form it reads somewhat as follows : (l) The Morning Prayer. (2) Repetition of the last day's lesson from Khalïl. (3) Correction of the tablets of the the fttqarä. (4) Opening lesson from Khalîl. (5) Lesson on al Kharrâzî, the Gazariya, and the Shãtiblya (books on Koran reading). (6) Lecture on 'Aqďtd and al Akhdarî and al .'Ashmâwï (the last two being writers on fiqh.) (7) The Noon Prayer. (8) Midday lesson from Khal?l. (9) The 'Asr Prayer. (10) Lecture on Tawhld. (11) Same subject as nunîber 6. (12) The Maghrib Prayer. (13) Evening lesson from KhaM. (14) Parade of the advanced Koran students to recite their lesson. (15) The 'Isha Prayer/ (16) The Students' dinner. (17) Reading of the sub1 of the Koran appointed for that night. (18) Rétirement of the shaykh to this khalwa. (19) Private study of the shaykh in the presence of the students. (20) Tablets are washed clean, and a new lesson written. (21) Correction of thé tablets of the advanced Koran pupils ( durräs s g. däris). (22) Call to the Morning Prayer. On holidays the shaykh gave judgments and decisions (yahkutn wa yuftl) and wrote amulets, .and thus he carried on until his death. It does not apper that this routine is quoted by our author as being of exceptional severity - for I am told that eighteen hours a day were the usual working hours of a khalwa even in recent times, but rathèr to illustrate the wide rabge of Ibn Asid's teaching in contrast with that of other shaykhs who generally confined themselves to one book or subject. • 12. On $üfism there is an immense literature in the East, and great store of Western, scholarship. Its rise has been ascribed to an Aryan reaction against Semitic Islam, to the influence of the Neo-Platonist philosophy, to contacts with Gnosticism, and to borrowings from Buddhism and other Indian systems. It may be said mpre truly that it had its roots within Islam itself, but owed much in its development to the various influences mentioned. In accordance with its syncretistic development it presents a variety of forms and aspects, and has in the course of its history been many things to many different types of men. To some it was in the main a creed of asceticism and flight from the world, others developed the speculative side and founded philosophical</page><page sequence="19">tABAQAT WAt&gt; Î) AÝF AIXA if. 2Ó9 schools and systems of theosophy, in Persia it acquired a curious association with fine letters and especially the poetry of wine-bibbing, and to the populace everywhere it presented the welcome gift of an hagiology and boundless opportunities for the cult of saints* Western students and admirers of füfism have been chiefly attracted by its philosophical speculation and its poetry, but neither of these two features is prominent in the ?üfism of the Sudan. The aspects of the Path, which most powerfully appealed to the heroes of the Tabaqât may be grouped under three heads : the ascetic life, the çiific forms of devotion and worship, and the spiritual experiences and miracles of the saints. 13. Asceticism, to judge from its wide distribution in all countries and and creeds, appears to answer to a powerful human need, and in spite of the Prophet's express disapproval of nionasticism, an ascetic strain existed within Islam since a very early period : similarly the association between the ascetic life and the mystical path goes back to the very beginnings of sufism. The use of the words faqlr and danvJsh , both originally meaning 'poor', to denote persons who devote themselves to the religious life is characteristic of this association of ideas. The author of the Tabaqât iš fond of relating the acts of self-denial and mortification to which his heroes subjected themselves, such as the wearing of the dervish cloak ( dilq) with its ostentatious patches, the use of coarse food and frequent fasting, avoidance of worldy talk and the company of women, and frequent periods of seclusion in the retirement of the khalwa. As an example of the ascetic we may select Hamad al Nahlãn (died 1704), better known as Wad al Turãbl, who is the occupant of a qubba a few miles north west of Kamlin. Hamad, after attending ten kkatmas of Khalll devoted himself to the Path and lived the ascetic, life : in spite of the entreaties of his friends he shut himself up in a khalwa, the entrance of which he caused to be bricked up ; of provisions he had three handfuls of garad (the bitter pods of the sunt tree) and seven dates ; a little water and a muttdla (a kind of bread cooked in ashes) of the size of a camel's eye were handed ia daily through a small window. He came forth after 32 months of seclusion, and it was found that none of the food had been touched and that his rakwa was still full of water. Later he spent another 30 months in: similar seclusion and eome forth bereft of flesh and blood, with the skin sticking to his bones whence he was called al nahlãn (emaciated). His wife al Hãgga relates : when I went to massage the shaykh, I found náught on him but the skin upon his bones. And he said ; Hâggar I have let all human attributes waste away from</page><page sequence="20">210 SUDAN NOTES AND RECORDS. mc, take my cousin Abü Kasayba who is young, and will beget sons. - His poet said of him : He has divorced this torn and broken world, he has suspended it from the seventh heaven, neither money does he ask of it nor the worth of a needle ; the covenant he made with his Lord he has not broken. W There follow highly curious stories of Hamaďs pilgrimage to Mecca, where he claimed to be the Mahdi, and of his dealings with Sulaymân al- Tamâmî, a general of Fung armies - but these must be omitted as being inappropriate to our present context. It should be noted that the ascetic life as understood by Muslims, does not involve celibacy, but even of this supreme form of self-abnegation there are examples : Khalll b. Bishãra, a native of Shambat, remained unmarried all his life, as did also al 'Agamí. b. Hassüna.who even refused the daughter of the Sultan of Stambul, when her father, believing in the saint's virtue, offered her in marriage together with vast wealth. 14. Closely connected with asceticism is the devotional or liturgical element of sufism i.e. the forms of worship denoted by the terms dhikr , wird ( pl. aivrãd), and rät ib. The five daily prayers of Islam did not satisfy the ascetics and devotees, who desired a more emotional form of worship than that of the formal prayers : hence the institution of the dhikr which is founded on the Koranic injunction 'to remember God often*. (2) Each of the great fraternities instituted its own form of dhikr, and though the Tabaqât tells us nothing on the subject, we may assume that the rites of the Qãdirlya and Shâdhilïya were those most in vogue in the Sudan. Attention may be drawn to the term karJr used in the Arabic of the Sudan, to denote the dhikr, especially that ol the Qtfdiriya: it is a word of onomatopoeic origin and discribes the noise made in drawing up and emitting the breath when repeating the name of God. A wird is defined as a recitation of certain litanies or orisons performed at appointed hours of day or night (see Dozy s. v.). Such a litany consists of Í1) AI dunyä um qu-düd fallaqhä fi sdbť samawät * allaqhä fihä ma bdür ibra wa lä mukallaqhõ al ' tiqda al * aqadhä ma* rabbo ma fakfakhä. (2) Koran XXXIII 14.

The Tabaqãt mentions the Hizb al òtf/i/y'and'one famous all over the Muslim world, called Dal ď il al khayrìft : others now in use in the Sudan are the Hizb al sayf , and the Hizb al NawawT. It is the custom for a devotee to adopt one of these for daily recitation, and his choice ought to be directed by his shaykh, as unguided selection is attended by various dangers. The awrild are used for private devotion, and the word rcltib is applied, at least in the Sudan, to similar litanies recited, in assemblies or prayer meetings. Well known examples are the Rätib of the Mahdi, and those of the Sammãniya and Mirghanïya Tarlqas. The term does not seem to occur in the Tabaqãt. Yet another form of devotional exercise is the repetition, a large number of times, of the 'majestic name* (lafz al galäla- Alláhů, or of such formulai as astaghfir Allah - I ask pardon of God - or the invocation of blessings on the Prophet. Thus Shaykh 'Abd al Rahmân b. Sâlih b. Banal Naqâ imposed upon himself the pious duty of repeating the invocation of blessings 50,000 times a day for the period of a year, after which he contented himself with 12,000 times each morning, and at night repeating the majestic name 100,000 times ; at the same time he used to read through the Dalďil al kli ay rät twice every day. For the purpose of keeping count a rosary of a thousand beads ( sibha alflya) was used. 15. The goal of the mystic's progress is the attainment of a state of spiritual perfection, an idea which is capable of various interpretations, but seems to' be always associated with a process of acquiring transcendental knowledge by means other than those of the intellect. The mystic, who is suitably prepared by ascetic exercises or who, without effort on his part, becomes a vessel of the divine grace enjoys ecstatic experiences called 'states1 ahwäl which convey a certitude of conviction concerning transcendental truths surpassing that which is attainable by reason or the intellect. The content of the truths thus experienced varies to an astonishing degree, and they are frequently expressed by means of metaphors derived from the vocabulary of erotic poetry and drinking songs. The culminating point of the ecstatic states is a stage called fatui (annihilation, absorption), in which there is no consciousness of individuality and no sensation capable of being expressed by the imperfect instrument of language. 'This state', says al Ghazãlf, 'is called absorption by the doctors of 7 1 CM)</page><page sequence="22">212 SUDAN NOTES AND RECORDS. mystical lore, when a man is so utterly absorbed that he perceives nothing of his bodily members, nothing of what is passing without, nothing of what occurs to his mind - yea, when he is, as it were, absent from all these things whatsoever, journeying first to his Lord, then in his Lord. But if the thought occurs to him that he is totally absorbed, that is a blot; for only that absorption is worthy of the name which is unconscious of absorption/ (*) The spiritual experiences recorded in the Tabaqàt resemble those with which we are familiar in other parts of the Muslim world, anď the same vocabulary is in use. The ecstatic state is referred to as lidia or (gazb, &lt;¿adhb - rapture) whence a person subject to this condition is called magzilb (maghdhub). It is compared to fainting or sleep, and the return to normal consciousness is called awakening ( fäq ). During, such states of rapture the mystic may give utterance to sayings or verses which are unintelligible to those present ; or he may display knowledge or learning which he does not possess in his normal consciousness. This language of ecstasy is called shatah. An example of such shatah is preserved in the notice of Muhammad al- Hamlm b. 'Abd al Sâdiq, a notable representative of the extravagant type of magziib , to whom we already had occasion to refer above. This man was a disciple of that Tâg al Din al Behârî, who is regarded as the fountain head of sufi teaching in the Sudan, and it is related that Tag al Din said of him: ordinarly it is the disciple who goes forth to seek his shaykh, not the sliaykh who goes to seek the disciple, but I have come from Baghdad for the sake of this boy. Al Hamïm, though a saint and the spiritual successor of Tag at din, was illiterate and knew the Koran only as far as the ¡Zilzila , yet he gave utterance to this shatah which, in the opinion of our author, is equal to the sayings of such men as 'Abd al Qãdir al Gílãní, Ahmad al Bedawřand al Rifá'i :</page><page sequence="23">TABAQÀT WAD DAYF ALLAH. 21 3 Though you have read, oh Qâdï, 4*) the laws of all thé rites, yet are you ignorant, oh Qãdi, of the laws of our rite.

We alighted on the Throne and the exalted Footstool and its Tablet, By the beauty of our splendour we were clothed in garments of light. 16. A type of spiritual experience which Wad Dayf Allah delights in relating, is the initiation of an aspirant into sainthood i.e. the first occasion when enlightenment came to him, and he found himself accepted amongst the holy men of God. It will be noticed that the ecstasies related in these initiation stories bear little resemblanee to the annihilation of the Neo Platonists : it is not absorption in the Absolute, beyond -time and space and attributes, which is experienced, but an introduction to a mythological world of Prophets, angels and saints, full of anthropomorphic details. We select the following two amongst these stories: Shaykli Hasan b. Hassvma (died 1664) related as follows to his disciple al KufI : I well tell you, oh -Kûfî, of my initiation (lit. the reason for my beginning and iny first stage - sabah bidãyatl wa axvwal antri).

I made my way to al Matrafïya, where I found an old man, called Fakî Abokr (variant reading: Abu Bakr), and with him many people, assembled for a feast. Abokr said to one of those present : is there any meat ? He replied : yes. Is there any seasoning (ntulfih) ? He replied : yes. Then he turned to me, saying: ho you f agir, take the leavings of the bread, season it with water (mallUihtl bil mil), and eat. Thereupon I said to myself: this one who does not honour me is my shaykh, After ä while he ordered me to fill his water bottle (rakwa) from the river, and when I went down to the bank, the bottle filled itself of its own accord, and came back to me without any human assistance. When I returned to the shaykh I found that he had assumed the shape of a young man, and thus he made his ablution and prayed, then he flew in the air until he reached the roof of the khalwa, and changèd back into his former body of an old men. I said to myself: this is my shaykh, but he said: I am not your shaykh, go dwell in retreat at Ba'uda ; there your shaykh will come to you, and you will rise to great things ; be a friend to my descendants after me. (And in aftertimes, says the relator, whenever one of the sons of Abokr visited Hasan, he used to embrace him and say : his father was a saint.) Thus I proceeded to Ba'uda and went into retreat devoting myself to the dhikr and the worship of God. There the Prophet upon whom blessing and peace, came to me accompanied by 'All (or, it is said, Abu Bakr) and „instructed me in the dhikr.

So he went following my tracks, and I -with him, until we came to the boatman, and he asked him who had crossed with him that day. He replied : a faglr came and I took him across ; then he looked at me as if he wanted to say : this is the man, but he kept silence. My father said : Hasan, the saints come to you, and direct you." Our second initiation story is that of Sâlïh b. Ban al Naqä (died 1753) who, incidentally, is the authority for the preceding story, having received it from the lips of al Küfi. His own tale is related by Wad Dayf Allah on the authority of a manuscript in Shaykh SãlihVown writing, and runs as follows : When I was still quite young I saw my father initiating people into the path, sitting on an 'angarëb with me beside him. I prayed him to initiate me, but he replied that my uncles, Abu Náib and al Zayn, would initiate me, hinting as it were at his death. After my father's death seven years passed, before I reached the age of puberty, then I was initiated by my uncle Sãllh Abu Nãib, and received the awrãd fťóm my uncle al Zayn, the two being brothers, sons of Shaykh 'Abd al Râziq. After this Hamad al Samïh raided Shendi with an army, killing the king of the Gamù'iya and upwards of a hundred men ; he ravaged the country, and carried off our slaves, our cattle and our sheep, amongst them two excellent camels belonging to me. I and my cousins went after him to recover our gear, and found him at al Bargõba : he restored to us some of it, and bade us meet him again at al Khashshãb, where hé would restore the rest. In this very night I (had a vision and) saw Shaykh 'Abd al Qãdir (al Gllãnl) sitting on an 'angarêb facing the Qibla. By each leg of the 'angarêb a man wearing a white turban was sitting. They put a white turban on my head, and adorned me with a necklace of ancient agate beads, of white and black colour, very bright. I made my complaint to 'Abd al Qàdir saying that Hamad had carried off my camels, but he pressed his face against me and said to the men who were sitting by his side : I want to speak to hint of the world to cóme, but he talks of this world. Go forth, light the fire. When I was awake I heard the beating of a drum above my head, and told my uncle Abü Nãib of it. He laughed and replied : revelations begin with the beating of drunis (axvwal al futlifj utrqifqTr). Then certain men came to me saying that they had been sent by the Prophet and Shaykh 'Abd al Qâdir and they said to mé: we have accepted you (as one of us) and we impose upon you 1 7*</page><page sequence="26">216 SUDAM NOTES AND RECORDS. the recitation of the words 'yd hayy y it qayyitnt * a thousand times at the passing of the days and nights. When I. informed my uncle Abö Nãib of this, he replied : as you serve God so will He aid you. Then the messenger of the Prophet took me to Shaykh Bedawï, and when I had given him the salutation, he lifted up his hands saying : may God increase your efforts towards Paradise (Alláh yukattir iitasrilfak HI gamia), amen. And an angel above him repeated : amen. After this, while I was in the khahva, my soul left my body and went forth penetrating the heavens, and it heard the speech of God Almighty, òr may be of an angel, saying to it : repent. And my soul replied : I repent in thy presence, Thou noble one. Then He said: will you mention me each day 100,000 times by the majestic name? My soul replied I will, my master, my lord. He said: will you mention me (again) 50,000 times. My soul replied : I will, my master, my lord. He said: will you mention my name 6000 times? My soul replied: I will, my master, my lord. And when I was in the khalwa I saw the Prophet, blessings on him and peace, and he turned to his left saying : Shamharusii and Maymün, arise with him. But I did not see them. Now this Shamharush is one of the companions (of the Prophet) and he is the Qfidi of the Ginn.. And he commanded me to read the Dalä'il eight times every day, and I replied that I would do more than that. But they (i.e. Shamharüsh and Maymun) said: nay, more you are not able. Then they said that if ever the temptation of the devil ( waswasat Iblls) were to assail my heart, they would tap mě above the liver. Then once again, while I was between sleeping and waking, the Prophet. came to my khahva with Gabriel behind him. And Gabriel said: dost thou give this exalted rank to this sinner ? but the Prophet turned towards him and said : it is I that brought him (to this stated And the Prophet, peace and blessing upon him, commanded Gabriel, on whom be peace, to carry me up and he penetrated the heavens with me, until I came to a heaven where I was constrained to ask that he should take me back. But he replied : nay, the Prophet has given you (this privilege)* and he took me even to the Well built Rouse (al bayt al m a'miir). Then he took me to Mecca and gave me access to the House, then to the City of the Prophet, on whom be peace, but the gatekeeper would prevent me from entering. But Gabriel said r hast thou not seen höw lie lias filled the heaven^ and the earth with prayer ? So I . was given permission to enter, and found him (the Prophet) seated, facing the Oibla, and with him Shaykh 'Abd al Qãdir and Shaykh Idrïs and Shaykh Hasan and Shaykh 'Abd ill Rãziq and my father Shaykh Ban al Naqâ and al Khaďir, on whom be peaec, and 'Ali and Biläl, God's grace.be with them.</page><page sequence="27">TABAQAT WAD DAYF ALLAH 217 And the Prophet commanded me to press the right side of his body, and I said: oli my lord, Apostle of God, how dare I press thy body? You have attained (to this privilege), said he, by your invocation of blessings upon me. Then the Prophet commanded Gabriel to cover my head with a white turban, and brought a thread wherewith to bind the turban. Said I : oh my lord, Apostle of God, how dure I use thy thread ? And he : if you wear not my thread, who will fear you, who show you reverence ? Then the. Prophet commanded the men (who were present) to endow me with gifts. Sliaykh Idris, ~a dark man, big, but with little flesh, arose first and made obeisance, saying ; I endow him with l lì ci sword of my power and the sword of my sainthood. Then came Shaykh Ilasan, a thin yellow man with a bald head, .saying the same words. Now the sword of his power had a silver handle, and the sword of his sainthood a handle of gold, and they placed them in front of the Prophet. Then came Sliaykh 'Abd al Ràziq, a thin dark man, verging on black, saying : I give him the sword of my power, but the sword of my sainthood is in the keeping of my son Sàlih. Then the Prophet commanded Shaykh 'Abd al- Qàdir to bring the fire from Shaykh Bedawi, and Sliaykh 'Abd al Qádir sent for it, and they brought it from Baghdad; it was a darwïsh cloak twisted as a wick ( ? khirqa fatila) with fire burning on it ; they brought it in a red ruby resembling a copper war drum. Shaykh Bedawî came behind 'Abd al Qãdir and said: I want the fire for my son, but 'Abd al Qádir replied: your son is not sitting amongst us .... . (Six lines which are unintelligible and appear to be an interpolation, omitted). When the People of God had endowed me with their gifts they put some thing on my foot, which made a clanking noise, and said: we have made you to appear like the sun and the moon: we have made your exterior to be the Law, and your inner self the Truth, we have raised your head even unto Fez and unto Cairo.' The author of the Tabaqãt informs us that the claims put forward by Shaykh Sãlih in the preceding narrative are repugnant neither to the Law, nor to the human intelligence, and quotes a number of parallels from süfí literature. 17. The saint is called siti ih - righteous - or walî, a friend (of God). The dignity of sainthood is not acquired by study, or by ascetic exercises, or by purity of life, but b&gt;' the action of the divine grace which is conferred regardiess of what mortals regard as merit or its opposite. For the ignorant and illiterate may be chosen as often as the learned, and . the conduct of , the saint may be such as to challenge the condemnation of those who judge by earthly standards. A glance at the pedigrees drawn up by Mr&gt; MacMichaeL</page><page sequence="28">218 SÜDAN NOTES AND RECORDÓ. will suffice to show that a predisposition to thè saintly office may run in faimilies, but it would be a mistake to regard sainthood itself as hereditary.. The khallfat or earthly representative of a holy man, is not himself a saint by virtue of his office or his descent, but only the carrier of a tradition, and the virtue and power inherent in him are not his own, but those of the dead saint. It would be difficult to define sainthood in precise terms, but a sketch may be attemped • of the most characteristic attributes by which saints are distinguished. There is first of all the enjoyment of spiritual experiences and ecstatic states such as have just been described, ^and by means of which the saint possesses esoteric knowledge concerning divine mysteries. He holds intercourse with the Prophet and the great Sufi hierarchs, and he meets that mysterious personage al Khadir, a prophet sometimes identified with Elijah, who lives for ever in this world wandering from place to place. In the second place the wàlï possesses control over nature, whereby he is able to work miracles or rather, as Islamic orthodoxy will have it, miracles are performed by nature in his honour whence they are called karämat - honours ; they are also designated as khawüriq al 'äda, which literally means acts or events contrary to the normal behaviour of things ; or again the saint may be described as mugfib (or mnstagäb) al dn'ä i.e. one whose prayers are answered. Accounts of miracles occupy much space in the Tabaqât, and afford tempting material for quotation, but we may dispense with the relation of examples in this place, partly because they differ little from the wonder tales of other hagiologies, and partly because characteristic instances may be found in Mr. MacMichael's extracts. It is sufficient to state that the miraculous powers of the saints have an exceedingly wide range, including as they do a knowledge of the hidden thoughts of men and of future events, power over animals and inanimate objects, ability to fly in the air and walk on the surface of the waters, the art of healing by prayer or incantation {'a za in) and even of restoring the dead to life. These powers are usually exercised for purposes benefiting mankind, but may be used toT punish the wicked who are overtaken by sickness or sudden death in answer to the wall's prayer. In this character of avenger the holy' man is called 'attčfb lil çalatna, from the verb* 'at tab to destroy. The most important earthly office of the saint is to confer spiritual benefit on tiiose who come in contact, with him, a result not achieved by preaching or teaching, or by the example of a holy life, but through the virtue (baraka) inherent in him, which acts as an influence on his surroundings. He is visited</page><page sequence="29">TÀBÀQÁT WAĎ DAYF ALLA tí. 219 by the faithful with the object of partaking of this influence (lil iabarrtik ), and though he may give material assistance as a healer and a worker of miracles, it is the spiritual comfort of his presence which is most eagerly sought by disciples and pilgrims. This baraka survives after the holy man's death in his descendants and in places and objects associated with him, more especially his grave which thus becomes an object of pilgrimage. Visitors to a grave are conscious of the feelings of awe and spiritual comfort (sakina wa ivaqär). The doctrine that the intercession of a saint may benefit the believer in the next life does not appear to be strongly held in Islam, but something of the sort is hinted at in the saying ascribed to Bedaw! Abu Dilayq : be of good cheer, ye women of the Kawahla, I will be your (strong) rock on the day of resurrection, a saying also recorded of Daf' Allah b. Muhammad. . According to theory the saints on earth form a hierarchy presided over by a Qutb, or Pole, below whom there are various ranks such as the Awtäd, and Nngabä and Bud al a, who according to a saying of 'Shaykh Hasan walad Hassunã are the troops of the Qutb. It does not appear however that these distinctions are observed with any attempt at . consistency, and the title of Qutb is freely bestowed on numbers of men who are known to have been contemporaries: it is stated for instance that forty disciples of Ibrahim b. Gãbir attained to this exalte^ rank ; and it is probably with a view to account- ing for such inconsistency that we are told, in another place, that the term Qutb may be used in a general way, and not only to designate the 'Qutb known to the sufis'. A saying of Idrïs b* Arbäb distinguishes three degrees of sáints, high, middle and low: 'The lowest degree is this that the saint is able to fly in the air, and to walk on the water and to talk of hidden things. The middle degree is this that God grants him the creative power (al daraga al- kaurilya) whereby he says to a thing 'be' and it is. The high degree is that of the Qutb.' This saying well illustrates the boundless extravagance which prevails in the claims made by enthusiastic disciples and by the saints themselves, and it is not surprising that Muslim orthodoxy was occasionally shocked. It should be noted, however, that such language is not peculiar to the Sudan, for parallels abound in the hagiologies of other Muslim countries. (*) From the ascription of such attributes it is but a step to the assertion that the saint by virtue of his mystical absorption in the divine nature,. is identical (*) Cp. the saying of Ibrâhim al Dasûqî, Ahmad al Bedawî, and 'Abd al Qâdir al Gîlânl quoted in Goldziher's Muhammedanische Stadien, vol. 2. p. 289, (W</page><page sequence="30">22Ô SUĎAŇ ŇOTĚS AND RĚČOfcDS. with God, and it is well known that there have been mystics who did riot shrink from this last consequence. In the Tabaqät we read the following curious statement, which occurs in the life of Daf Allah b. Muqbil al 'Arakï: 'Shaykh Balai al Shayb said : the name of my father Daf Allah is the Great Name of God. When writing amulets DaP Allah used but to write his own name, repeating it a number of times.' 18. The esoteric knowledge of the saints is regarded as infinitely superior to the formal learning of the schools, and lawyers and grammarians who deride the holy men for their apparent ignorance, are sadly discomfited. Thus Hasan b. Balil, a magdhüb öf Dongola, used to perform the miracle of walking ori the water by virtue of the formula ya Itayy ya qayyilm, but in his foreign way (min al ' agUtmya ) he pronounced the latter word with kãf instead of a qäf. A forward disciple presumed to correct his pronunciation, but he sank in the water, and was only able to perform the feat when he imitated his master's mistake. Similarly in the anecdote of Hasan walad Hassüna quoted below a presumptuous disciple is taught that the saint's 'broken recitation' of the Koran is more acceptable to God than his own observance of all the rules of Tagwïd. The same point is brought out forcibly in the story of Abö 1 Qásim al Gunayd, a grandson of that Muhammad al Hamîm, who is perhaps the most typical example of the antinomian type of saint : 'Like his grandfather Muhammad al Hamim, this Abû 1 Qãsim was ignorant of reading and writing, yet when his father 'Ali al Nil was about to die and they asked "him who was to be his successor, he replied : the herdsman, meaning Abu 1 Qãsim who was herding the cattle in a shirt black with dirt and stained with the dung of his animals. And though the dying man's brothers, al Süfí and Mustafâ both sons of Muhammad al Hamim, were learned men knowing the Koran, as was also his son Sharif, yet he pointed to none of these, and they said : Shaykh 'Ali is greater than we are and more advanced in divine knowledge; if he did not see good in him he would not appoint him. Shaykh 'All said : the true function of the saiiit is to guide aright in his coming and in his going ; then he called Abü 1 Qãsim and embraced him exclaiming : what is mine is his, and whoever disobeys him disobeys me in my grave. Shaykh 'Abd al Râziq Abu Qurün was present when 'All al Nil died, and al Gunayd entered òn his succèssion. Said lie : oh my uncle, I have no learning and ' Abd al Râziq' replied : be of good cheer, you have spiritual comfort and power, (abshir bil khayr sakanta wa makanta). Then al Gunayd took his father's place and initiated disciples and taught, and was acknowledged both</page><page sequence="31">TABAQAT WAD DAYF ALLAH. 221 by the elect and by the commonalty. Shaykh Daf Allâh b. Zayn al 'Abidïn relates : when my grandfather 'Abd al Rahmân was dying at a place called Bayla during the dispersion which followed the Hunger Year Umtn Lahm , he enjoined upon my father that he should go to pay his respects to Abü 1 Qäshn al Gunayd. When the dispersion was over Zayn al 'Abidïn accordingly visited al Gunayd who welcomed him and said : your father's injunction was not in vain, Then (says Zayn al 'Abidïn) there came the call to prayer, and al Gunayd prayed perfunctorily so that I doubted about him in my heart. He turned towards me and said : Zayn al 'Abidïn, when you sit with people guard your thoughts, and do not imitate the Lawyers {al fuqahtt) whose hearts are veiled from (the vision of) God. 19. The claim to freedom from the restrictions by which ordinary humanity is bound, was extended to the sphere of the moral and ritual law, and there arose a class of antinomian saints designated as Malãmatiya - the bearers of blame, whose standpoint is described by our author as follows : 'The Malámatls are a class of sûfïs who do things that are blameworthy and contravene the sacred law, wherefore they are repudiated and rejected by the people ; now some' of them bring destruction on those who reject them, but others seek such repudiation in order to mortify their souls, and from fear of gaining fame.' (*) In this as in other things the saints of the Sudan did. no more than follow a tradition which had arisen in other Muslim countries where antinomianism and süfism had been associated since an early period. . Wad Dayf Allah relates examples of lawm from the Sufi Lives of al Sha'rânï, such as the case of Ibrahim b. al Khawwãs, who stole the clothes of people in the bath and walked about ostentatiously with the stolen goods under his gibba till he was set upon and beaten ; and a learned man of Nishapur in the terçth century discussed the tenets of these people in a special treatise, which has recently been studied by a German- scholar, (t) A number of different ideas and tendencies are mingled in the teaching ascribed to this sect. There is first of all the protest against the hypocrisy of those who pray and do good works in public in order that they might gain the fame and praise of holiness : the Malâmatï argues that there is greater merit in leading the holy life under O ¡y* 4¿?t£ oLoM Inktir is the technical term for doubting or repudiating a holy man's claim. (t) As- Sulami's Risàlat al - Malâmatîja by Richard Hartmann, Der Islam, vol. 8fp. 1 57.</page><page sequence="32">222 SUDAN KOTES AND RECORDS. the cloak of profanity and even of evil fame. There is next the ascetic motive which causes the indignities and the persecution provoked by such a reputation to be welcomed as a form of spiritual discipline, and from this it is but a step to the deliberate provocation of blame and punishment by acts of immorality and crime. Professor Hartmann has pointed out contacts between these ideas and certain tendencies in Cynicism and in Early Christianity, and al Sulamï interprets the Malãmat! movement in terms of Islamic orthodoxy, as a form of supreme self-abnegatioň which makes the Ego an object of blame and detesta- tion. Regarded 'in this light the Malâmatï teaching should be distinguished from the tenets of the Ibâhïs or antinomians proper, who set the moral law at naught from motives of libertinism or through disbelief in its sanctions; but it is easy to see how the pursuit of 'blame* could be made to serve as a cloak for unblushing immorality, or how thè shocking behaviour bf mentally deranged saints could be excused, and even glorified, as an expression of the Malâmatï spirit. With regard to the saints of the Tabaqât, to whom the term Malãmat! is applied, it may be said that the motive of 'blame' is not very conspicuous in their' acts. There is Muhammad al Naqar, a son of 'Abd al Râziq Abu Qurõn, who may more properly be described ás a type of the 'attãb : he let his cattle graze in the cultivation of other folk, and brought sickness and death on those who objected. His victims were many, and his father said of him that if he did iiot tie his hands to his neck, he would leave no one unharmed: hence people callëd him al Náqar after the poisonous herb which kills the cattle that graze on it. In another famous case the violation of the moral law is represented as authorised by esoteric revelations from the Prophet : "the tale is related by our author in two places, and we follow the fuller version given in thé life of the protagonist, Muhammad al Hamlm : 'Now these are the acts of 'blame' committed by this shaykh : the number of Iiis wives reached ninety, and he carried off a slave girl called Zurrayqa from her owners at ArbagI, and kept her as his concubine. He married the iwo daughters of : Bân al Naqâ Abu Ya'qüb, whose names were Um Kultüm and Khãdim Alláh, concerning whom he said, that a master could not be prevented from taking his slaves. . He also married another pair of sisters, the daughters of Abõ Andõda at Rufa'a. And it is related that he married a beautiful womán, called Halïma, at Atbara and as he travelled from al Mandara to the wedding feast, there went with him twelve led horses without riders, and his concubines mouutçd on others, and large crowds. (When they arrived)</page><page sequence="33">TABAQAT WAD DAYF ALLAH. 223 the people were kept at a distance and a rope was tied and people said to one another; now the shaykh is going into his house. When he went inside he put his foot on the bed and pressed his breast against it, saying : now have I become the guest of God, my dwelling place is in the grave, it is incumbent 0:1 a host to show hospitality. This he kept repeating from evening until the break of clay. Then the rriu'adhdhin came to call him to the morning prayer, saying : Remember the right of God, my lord, the dáy has dawned. But he replied : why do they talk to me of prayer ? am I not in the next world ? did you not say, the shaykh has gone into his house ? I have nó house but the grave. And one day the slave girls sang songs praising themselves and jeering at the Arab women, and the bride wept. The shaykh asked what they liad sung, and they repeated to him the verse : He curses the Devil and worships the Lord, and is swayed by Halïma's lightest word. (*) To which he replied : aye, even thus. Now it must be known that many opposed him strongly, and amongst them Dushayn the Qâdï of Arbagi. One day Muhammad al Hamim came to Arbagi to attend the Friday prayer, and as he left the mosque and mounted his horse, Dushayn seized the bridle exclaiming: you have married five and six and seven, and you take two sisters to wife, defying the book of God and the Sunna of the Prophet. Al Hamîm replied, that he had received permission from the Prophet, and that Idrfô (b. Arbãb) knew of this permission. Turning to Idris the judge asked, whether this was true, but Idris replied: leave. him alone, this is a matter between him and his Lord. Said Dushayn : I asked for your testimony and not for your advice. Ànd Idris : if one manumits a slave does he go back on the manumission ? God has granted manumission to this man. Thereupon Dushayn pronounced the annulment of all those marriages, and al Hamîm cursed him saying : may God split your skin. Arid Dushayn was struck by sore illness which caused his skin to split like the skin of a serpent. Yet he did not change his mind concerning Muhammad al Hamîm, but on the contrary was but confirmed in his certitude, wherefore he was called the Just Judge.' Thus far our author ; but a sequel not related in the Tabaqãt is known to oral tradition ; it is stated that the Prophet appeared to Dushayn in a dream, and revealed to him a fact which exonerated al Hamîm in the matter of the*</page><page sequence="34">224 SUDAN. NOTES AND RECORDS. two sisters : for the two women were (laughters of different mothers, and the secret revealed by the Prophet was this that one of them had been conceived in -adultery, wherefore the two wives were not sisters at all. Dushavn therefore let'the matter drop, and was cured of his skin disease. 20, The border line between gad hb and mental disorder is exceedingly thinly drawn, whence the phenomenon of the mad saint is familiar all over the East. The reader of the preceding* pages will have become aware of the psychopathic plement in many of the incidents related, and our account of this side of the subject may be supplemented by reference to some of the eccentric saints tp whom the term magdhüb is applied par excellence : Salman al Tiwâlï before his conversion was a sinner and acted as attendant on drinking parties, for whom he -prepared" their marîsa. He lived at al- Labaytor, a day's journey from Rufa'a, and his conversion came to pass through 'Muhammad al Hamîm, who met him when travelling from Rufa'a lo al Mandara, and asked him to give water to his thirsty disciples. Salmân readily complied, and al Hamlm praved that he might be filled with faith, whereupon he repented of his ways and attached himself to the shaykh to be instructed in the süfí path. Enlightenment came to him, and he became lost in divine mysteries {iugadhab iva sakar wa gharaq ). It was his custom to wear above ~his gibba a woman's waist fringe {rah at) and he fixed a t&gt;èll to his right and one to his left, and thus he uttered zagharlt . His former boon companions at Rufâ'a called him madrbut he exclaimed : (' ) They, call'rne mad - I am not mad - there met me the people of .hidden treasures - and gave me pure honey to drink. He abducted á slave girl, called Manniuia who was skilled in all drum rhythms, to beat the drum for him, and he used to call to her thus : Oh Mannàna, beat the drum - thou hand maiden of God, not a slave of man. ( I ) He performed many miracles and instructed many disciples in the path. When Muhammad al Hamîm married the two daughters of Abu Andõda, -as related above, one of the brides wept, because she would not be her sister's co-wife, and refused to let herself be combed for the wedding*. The shaykh called on Salmân who said : oh my lord, and lord of Salman s mother, what troubles the bride that she refuses ? Then he went up to the girl clapping his hands and dancing, and sang to her : (*) Gâlô lai mag mi il -ana mini magnûiv-lâgônî nâs nâs al mikuûn- isgônî 'asalan mashnûn (t) YiU Mannâna cl uggì 1 dallûka- khâdim Allâli al mâki mainltìka.</page><page sequence="35">ŤAfcAQAT WAD DAYF ALLAH 225 Oh you weeping bride- the people of knowledge have rushed upon yoii - they have carried you off and made you my mistress. (*) During the dance he bent over her, as girls do in dancing when they shake their hair over the man of their choice, until she burst out laughing and became reconciled to the marriage. One day his sla' e girl Mannãna, the drummer, addressed him saying ; Master, you have initiated and instructed disciples, and your disciples have initiated and instructed others ; will you not now give up this dancing ? He gave her his promise, but when the 'state* came over him, he called on her to beat the drum as before. Said she : my beloved, my darling, what of the promise you made ? And he replied : you lie, vou traitress, I promised nothing. He died at the age of Í20 and is buriéd at al Labaytor, where his* grave is visited by pilgrims. Similar stories are related of IsiruVîl surnamed the Lute Player, a son of Shaykh Makkî al Daglâshî ; though unlike Salmân he was a man of learning who had gone through the usual course of studies and lectured on the Risàia, on Dogmatic Theology, and the Koran. He was the author of a book on the Sufi Path and on the ceremonies of the Dhikr, and composed odes in praise of the Propliet. He also composed verses (in the colloquial) in which he sang of women called Tahug and Hayba, using these names as the ancients did when singing of Layla and Su'da. (+) Butr relates óne of his disciples, when the mystic state befell him, he would collect wedding parties in the enclosure of his house, and plav the lute for them while they danced : for every drum beat lie had a tune, and his tunes would restore the mad to health and bewilder sane minds, and even move «ini mais and inanimate objects. If his lute was placed in the sun it would play accompaniments to his times, at the mere- sound of his voice without being touched by any one. He had a mare called Bint Bikr which they decked out in silk trappings with bells hanging from her: thus a man would lead her while the shaykh sang martial strains to her, to words such as tliese : Bint Bikr al ut a rd ã 'va aywiï iva aywi 7 (¡) sal a ti y at al * arda xca ayxcã 'ca ayxciT. (*} Ya dá 1 'íirús al bakkai- tfhârô alcki alil al rai g,i'a1ôki ghasîba wa dittai. (f) Tlic lext of the specimens quoted is unfortunately, too corrupt to admit of quotation. (!) Which perhaps, may be translated: Bint Rikr the smooth haired, the broad spear of troops in ranks.</page><page sequence="36">226 SUĎAN NOtfeS AND ŘfeCÓŘĎŠ. And the mare would dance to the sound of his voice, bobbing up and down, and playing with her fore feet and nodding her head, while the bells were tinkling on her neck. On account of his amatory verses our author includes this man amongst . the Malâmatîs. He was killed by Shilluks near Alays together with more than forty disciples. 21. To conclude our survey a sketch may be attempted of the position occupied by the saints in the social order and of the part they played in the general life of the country, subjects on which the Tabaqât provides many interesting sidelights. The ascetic ideal counselled aloofness from worldly affairs, and it was held by the men of religion that the powers of this world belonged to an order of things which had no relation to their own aspirations and pursuits. As it appeared hopeless to convert kings and rulers, it was best to pass them by and men are commended for not seeking the courts of kings, or for meeting the representatives of earthly power with indifference or haughty superiority. Yet there were those whom such aloofness did nor drive into the seclusion of the hermit, for a man might without inconsistency live amongst the splendours of this world and yet despise them. To Jive in the world and yet to be above it requires a higher degree of spiritual perfection than mere flight from temptation a point which is well brought out in the following anecdote culled from the notice of 'Ammãr b. 'Abd al Hafîz (ca. 1770 A.D.): This man was married to Fátima bint Sâlim, a lady of vast wealth whose slaves traded to Egypt and India, yet during the twenty seven years of their married life lie never ate any food provided by her, and never used a lamp, saying that her wealth had come to her by right of inheritance whereas he had but married her person. Once when Fak! Muhammad walad 'Uwayda was visiting Shaykh 'Izz al din b. Nafť al Monagil they discoursed concerning the merit of different shaykhs. Said 'Izz al din : Fakî Muhammad, you visit many shaykhs, now tell me, how does our shaykh Daf Alláh compare with your shaykh, Qaddàl b. al Fardi, and with our brother 'Ammâr b. 'Abd al Hafiz ? Muhammad replied : When I visited Daf Alláh I found his disciples by the river, some of them revising their lessons {yusaxvwirü ), others telling their beads, and others again engaged in the dhikr. The shaykh himself during the forenoon {bďd al näfila) would lecture on Khalîl, the Risàia, 'Aqâ'id, Tagwîd, Tafsïr and books of sufism, and during the days I stayed with them I heard no reference to the things of this world' except where it entered appropriately into the subject of the lectures. As for our shaykh al Qaddâl, his village has</page><page sequence="37">TA&amp;AQAT WAĎ DÁYF ALLAH. 227 grown so much that it is now continuous with the villages of Ghashaynãb and Faragáb. His disciples are Takruris and Arabs, and there is constànt trouble : the Takruris muster to the number of 1700. He holds five courses of lectures : Khali], the Risala, 'Aqâ'id, al Gãmi* al saghir (a work on Fiqh by the Imam Abû Hanïfa), and Ibn 'Atã Alláh (a mystic, died A.D. 1389); by his side there lay seven pebbles for the purpose of keeping count of any worldly talk which might be uttered : whenever this occurred he put a pebble in his mouth. 'Well done', said 'Izz al din, 'he saves himself from worldly temptation'. As for Hägg 'Ammär, continued Muhammad, when I visited him I found crowds of horses, mules and asses at his door, and rows of shoes of the different kinds called sartnüga , Fung shoes and Arab sandals. Inside there were people sitting around in many circles, some discussing the trade of the Higãz, others conversing about the west country or the south, and others again of the king's court. The shaykh was right in their midst, with a rosary in his hand telling his beads, and when the visitors had risen he began his lectures of which he held twelve courses. And if one asked him concerning the conversation of the people he replied : I take no interest in a single word of it. Said #Izz al dïn : 'All this worldliness does not tempt him ; he has attained to greater perfection than the other two.' There were in fact many ways in which the world obtruded itself on those who impressed their contemporaries with their spiritual power. Wealth would be showered upon them in the form of lands granted by kings and rulers, or of piöus gifts brought by the faithful. Though the sterner sort might refuse ail offerings others did not disdain to make regulàr charges for cures and amulets. The crowds of disciples surrounding the holy man had to be maintained at the expensé of their shaykh, and though visitors might bring gifts, their entertain- ment was apt to prove costly. In an âge of feudalism the holy man's village, inhabited by his fuqarä and his slaves, would form a small independent state, and we have already seen how El Damer in thé eighteenth century was actually ruled by a dynasty of saints. The kings of Sennar and Halfãya, and the numerous small dynasts of the country fully shared the superstitious fears of the commonalty, and we hear much of the respect they showed to the saints and the gifts with which they endowed them. The holy men were thus a power in the land, and Mr. MacMichael quotes several anecdotes which show them as intervening, with their influence or their miraculous powers, in the affairs of state (Cp. the notices of Khalil b. al Rümí Khôgall, and Mukhtâr b. Muhammad). Their way with kings and rulers may ' * (O)</page><page sequence="38">228 SUDAN KÒTKS AND RECORDS. aptly he likened to that of the prophets of Israel, and just as the latter sometimes met with persecution at the hands oř the wicked, we read of troublesome fakls who were slain and despoiled by the rulers of the land. Those who slew them came to a had end, but supernatural powers and threats did not always afford protection against the ambition and the covetousness of tyrants. Three forms of action, pertaining to the affairs of this world, are much lauded in the saints : to offer lavish hospitality to travellers and pilgrims, to intercede with kings on behalf of the oppressed {al shifaa Ind al m til ilk), and to give asylum to fugitives whose blood is sought (al warqfìb). The times were such a's to provide ample opportunities for the exercise of the last two, and we gather that the influence of the saints did something to alleviate the horrors of which the land was full. We read of cases where even the grave or sacred place of a dead saint afforded sanctuary to those in danger. (*) With regard to political conditions it should be noted that the modern centralised organisation of the Dervish Fraternities had not vet come into existence during our period. Readers of Mr. Willis's paper on the religious confraternities of the Sudan (S.N.R., vol. IV, 4) will remember that the Tariqas which are of most note at the present day hardly date back further than the Turkish em, and their centralised government is of comparatively recent origin. The holy men of the Tabaqât derived their initiation into the Path either from 'Abd al Qádir al Gîlânï, or from al Shâdhilï, and in this sense they and their disciples were members of the Tariqas instituted by those two saints. But the followers of the Tiirlqas were not organised under a common head, as they are at the present dav, and each holy man of repute formed an autonomous body of adherents, which continued after his death undef the rule of his khitlafif. The office of khalifa was hereditary, though it did not necessarily descend to the eldest son. In many cases the appointment was made by testamentary disposition, failing which the succession might be disputed amongst several rival claimants. It was a favourite device on such occasions to appeal to the tomb of the dead man for a decision. The khalifa inherited his predecessor's teaching office, and the right to initiate disciples into the Path ; he was the guardian of the tomb, and administered the revenues deri ved from lands and slaves, and from the pious gifts of pilgrims.

Concerning such relics we read as follows in the life of.Daf Allah b. Muhammad Abu Idiis (died 1683): 'After leaving Shaykh SaghïiTm, Daf Allah lodged with his uncle Menôfalï b. *Abd Allah al Wrakl at Um Shãniq in the up country (falira) of Klran, and he married his cousin Nur al Iluda, who was his principal wife and the mother of his son Muhammad and of his daughter Sittenã. At this time Muhammad b. Da'üd al Agharr came to him from 'Agïb and brought him the stools (kakffm) and flags and the gibba and kuflya of Habib Alláh al- 'Againï, likewise the spear of 'Abd Allah al 'Arakî, called Uni m Km y sha, on which were engraved the Names, and he said to him : these are the imple- ments (tflfit) which your fathers deposited with me charging me to deliver them to Daf* Allah, when he was grown up; now také your "trust/ It was in keeping with the wealth and influence enjoyed by many of the lioly men that they surrounded themselves with the outward semblance of royal state, even áping the ceremonies and pomp of the court. A graphic description of such "magnificence, taken from the life of Hasan walad Hassuna, is worth quoting on account of the vivid touches which it contains : 'The tradition amongst the people is that he had 500 slaves, each of whom bore a sword with scabbard tip and plate and pin of silver, and their com- manders bore the titles of Sïd Qawm and Gundi, (*) and they also carricd clubs. They used to trade in their well groomed horses to Taqalî and 1 &gt;ãr Borqü and Darfur and Sennar and to the Awlâd 'Agïb. His slaves lucani e whole villages ; and so many were the visits paid to him that they made two large zaribas for the flocks, from which all through the day animals were led forth for slaughter or as gifts, while others took their place In his enclosure there were many straw huts {balawät gatilfj) equalling in number the huts in the king's enclosure at Sennar, each hut being reserved for a special class of people, and there was a reception daïs ( dikkat al dlwän) in front of the enclosure. Fakï 'Abd al Sãdiq walad Haslb, the famous scholar relates : Shaykh Hasan sent for me in order to consult me about certain matters. On my arrival I found that he was absent, and they told me that he had gone into the desert for devotional exercises. We lodged with the Makãdf, (0 and after some days I heard a commotion in the village and the nòise of zagharlt , and they told me the shaykh and arrived. We went forth to see the spectacle, and there came a short bakl man wearing a horned cap (quriiii) and dressed in a farda of d.unmur ; in his hand he carried a staff {? tuitshkitr) wherewith he dispersed the people, and thus he went inside the enclosure. When the sun was down drums were beaten, and as the day grew cool, a big European bed (f arsila rtlmJya) was set on the reception daïs, and the shaykh came dressed (*) These are titles borne by functionaries of the Fung sultanate.

The slaves then paraded before him. to salute their master : they were carrying clubs, and each stopped in front of him saying:. I am so and so. After them came the fuqarä to give the salute. Then came litigants and petitioners to give the salute and talk (of their affairs). After them came the Makãdl sayfng that there was a woman with a sick daughter who was asking for a cure. Said the sliaykh : let her bring an ounce of gold, otherwise I will not cure her. 'She has brought an ounce'. 'Then test it and weigh it'. After a while he came back to report that he had found the weight correct. Now there was a faqlr amongst those sitting there, who murmured in his heart saying : he makes us write copies of the Koran, but does not pay lis any ounces of gold. Also hé mispronounces his words in the koranic passages recited in prayer, and all the gifts of God he retains in his own hands. The shaykh ordered the sick girl to be brought in and to be placed on thè ground by the dais : there he told her mother to clothe her in her waist fringe, and when this was done he addressed her saying : arise, and she got up as if there was nothing the matter with her. Then at the shaykh's order the mother clapped lier hands, and the girl began to dance, and in her dance she bent over the aforesaid faqïr and shook her hair in his face. The shaykh turned to this faqir and said : my broken recitation was acceptable to the Lord, but your recitation, though correct according to the rules of Tagwïd, was not acceptable. The Lord has seasoned my food with milk, and yours with water; what have you to say ? The man replied : pardon, my master, in sooth you are a servant whom his master loves. Andjpardon was granted. And the shaykh said to the shepherds : do not let my lambs perish but let them loose amongst their mothers, and milk their leavings. And later when he asked concerning the leavings, the milking was found to be 18. xvaybas 'Abd al Sãdiq next describes a Ramadan breakfast to which Hasan entertained his guests. It was served by 120 gorgeously dressed slave girls, adorned with precious jewels, carrying dishes of kisra. Each of these was followed by another, still more gorgeously dressed, who carried a plate, and after each of these followed another with a gourd. The food served to the narrator consisted of two cocks, and inside each cock there were two pigeons and two small birds. But Shaykh Hasan's own breakfast was that of an ascetic : to him the gate keeper brought a basin of water in which qarad pods were soaked, and a tray of muttäla cooked in ashes. 'The shaykh drank the qarad water, and dipped his bread in the qarad before he ate. Then he rinsed out his mouth and arose to pray.' With this we take leave of the Tabaqãt. The interest of the book is not exhausted in the extracts presented in this paper, for the writer s difficulty has not been to find passages of interest, but rather to decide reluctantly on the omission of many that could not be included. It is hoped that the reader has gained a not inadequate impression of that remarkable world which is so effectively presented in the pages of the Tabaqãt. Note: - It is regretted that owing to typographical difficulties the translituation of Arabic words and names is not free from inconsistency.</page></plain_text>
