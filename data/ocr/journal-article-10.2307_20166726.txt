The first and the third are characterized by forms of barbarisms: the first is the stage of the "barbarism of the senses" (la barbarie del senso), the third is that of the "barbarism of intellect" (la barbarie dell'intelletto) or of "reflection." The products of this latter stage are marked by a "reflective malice" (Vico 1744: #1106) that constructs the environment as "a Cartesian world, a world of scientific research, technology, and gadgets, which invades and conditions our lives."1 Cartesian technology provides a set of prescriptions and specifications for transforming the man-made environment ? originally fashioned by poetic images ? into prosaic visualizations. In this Cartesian world, architecture is a monistic art, based on analytical procedure, and cannot produce tangible knowledge. Furthermore, because of this limitation, architects are bound to borrow procedures from other disciplines to help solve the various epistemological problems of architectural production. Architecture is an art "that reveals the workings of its own becoming" (Vico 1710: iv, ii). In the architectural act the process of knowing is in the "making" as well as in the "doing," that is, discovering the right scale through a productive act, an act in which measure is inherent. This process of knowing is based on the resolution of the duality existing between theory and practice. Aristotle points this out in a recurring aphorism in the Metaphysics: "the art (techne) indeed is in the form itself." The techne has the same structure as the cognitive process, which itself is based on a dual procedure: first, the abstraction of a form from matter to mind, and second, the realization of this form outside of the mind through materials that can receive it (Isnardi Parente 1966: 129-131). In this sense there is a common root to techne and physics ? an analogy based not on the product but on the method of production. Aristotle sees in the work of the physician and the architect an instance of this analogy of procedures: both produce something necessary in accordance with the required techne: the processes of designing and constructing a building are similar to the processes of medical theory and healing. In his analysis of the bodily structure of animals, Aristotle indicates that there are three stages in the process of "composition." The first stage, synthesis, deals with the elements (stoicheia); the second deals with the homogeneous parts; and the third deals with the nonhomogeneous parts. From Aristotle's language in this passage, the metaphor is clear: stoicheion signifies the letter of the alphabet. The metaphor invoked is that of "writing"; the body of the animal is a text, in which the letters come together to generate the synthesis ? the body. This is then constructed through the rules for homogeneous and nonhomogeneous parts. Anatomy is the discipline that, by the knife, can cut into the body and understand the order (taxis) of the parts. The anatomical knife organizes knowledge and is an analog for the grapheion, the pen ? the tool of both the writer and the architect. Homo sapiens is the other pole of Homo necans (Vegetti 1979). The identification of medicine and architecture in a charismatic relationship is an ancient one. Imhotep, the architect-builder of the Zoser Pyramid in Saqquara, was venerated after his death as a thaumaturgie God (Lise n.d.) In his Ars (Techne) Medica, Galen ? whose father was a well-known architect ? insisted that the physician should learn from the architect (Corner 1930: 5). Galenic medicine sees itself as a techne, whereas architecture is seen as a union of archeos and techne. In their philosophical inquiry, the Stoics developed a doctrine of signs as a way of inferring what is hidden (unperceivable) from the perceptible. This doctrine was called semeiotike (sema = sign) and the semeiotica medica is one of the six Galenic categories of materia medica. In the Stoic doctrine, a sign is a Januslike entity composed of a signifier and signified. This Stoic, and also Galenic, interpretation of the dual nature of signs is This study has been made possible thanks to a grant by the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation, New York. 1. E. Gianturco, "Introduction" (in Vico 1708: English translation 1968).</page><page sequence="3">82 RES 9 SPRING 85 in fact the source of one famous passage in Vitruvius's De Architectural Both in general and especially in architecture are these two things found; that which signifies and that which is signified. That thing which is signified (quod significat) is the proposed thing about which we speak; that which signifies (quod significatur) is the interpretation unfolded in a doctrine (demonstrate ration i bus doctrinarium explicata). (De Architecture /. /. 3) During the Renaissance the relationship between the two disciplines focused again on a common procedure of knowledge ? anatomical studies. Architects looked to anatomy to develop better architecture. Michelangelo states in a letter to an unknown prelate, "It is a certain ... the members of architecture derive from the members of man" (Summers 1981: 418). This is not just indulgence in morbid taste for anatomy, as Filarete makes explicit: "I will show you that the edifice is exactly like a live man" (p. 29). Anatomy, as a techne, ars anat?mica, is a sensory motor "procedure for learning" (Vico 1744: #404). Vico regards the anatomical procedure as the only possible way of learning. In the Antiquissima Italiorum Sapientia, Vico identifies knowledge of man with "composition" ? a synthetic process. The process of composition, however, results from the decomposition or dividing of things ? an anatomical procedure. This anatomical procedure is not based on a system of classification and singling out of similarities, but rather on "imaginative knowledge." Thus, anatomical studies result in general concepts, summing up all the differences, particulars, or details. The origin of science is in anatomy, and imaginative knowledge is its "nature" ? Vico's natura. By abstraction and analogy, the dissecting of the human body has been the origin of all the other human sciences. In the "Scienza Nuova," Vico further stressed the idea that the origin of human knowledge is in the human body. The likeness, the ?conic metaphors taken from bodies, are used in "refined arts and recondite sciences" to signify "the operation of abstract minds" (1744: #404). As proof, Vico presented the fact that all languages have a great number of words for artificial and natural objects based on metaphors derived from the human body. Thus, the foot is used as a metaphor for end-piece, base, or foundation; the heart for center, core; the hands, a clock; an arm, the sea; teeth a rake, a saw, a comb; mouth for many different kinds of openings; eye for other kinds of openings; shoulder for hill or side of road; head for top or beginning. Vico made use of this observation to support one of the axioms of his "Scienza Nuova": "man makes himself measure of all things" (#120). Rational metaphysics teaches that a man becomes all things by understanding them (homo intelligendo fit omnia); our imaginative metaphysics shows that man becomes all things by not understanding them (homo non intelligendo fit omnia); and perhaps the latter proposition is truer than the former, for when man understands, he extends his mind and takes in the objects, but when he does not understand, he makes the objects out of himself and becomes them by transforming himself into them. (#405) Leon Battista Alberti even more specifically points to a metamorphosis of body into building. "The building is a body" (Alberti 1966: VI 3v-3) and "as in an animal every limb (membro) agrees with the other limbs, in a building every part (membra) should agree with the other parts (membri)" (Alberti 1966: III 14-14). In making buildings, man transforms himself into them, as the naming of the parts of buildings shows. In his constant search for a clear architectural terminology, Alberti selected many terms from the language of masons and carpenters, refining them in proper Latin usage while incorporating them in his treatise. Often these architectural terms are based on anatomical references: for instance, domes have nerves and ligaments; the pier of vaults is called "hip" or "thigh." According to Alberti, architecture ? like medicine ? developed in three stages of knowledge, through very small additions and refinements of information (Alberti 1966: VI). He advised the architect to proceed in his inquiry as a physician does, that is, without denying what he does not yet understand (Alberti 1966: X, I, 1 -15). He saw this procedure as the basis for the proper development of both disciplines. Alberti indicates, furthermore, that both professions have to deal with defects (vizii). These defects are of three different kinds: those originated by mistakes in theory, by mistakes in practice, and by external causes. Following a similar line of thought and the same tripartite structure, Te?filo Gallacini (a seventeenth century Sienese physician) developed a careful iatromechanical analysis of architectural defects. In a book titled Trattato sopra gli Architetti he presented an anatomical selection of architectural details bringing into evidence, by comparison, "abnormal" parts of the architectural body. According to Gallacini, the aim of</page><page sequence="4">Frascari: A "measure" in architecture 83 the Aristotelic-Galenic architect is to single out the errors usual in the building production of his time, and remedy them by the same procedure by which medicine observes and identifies "mistakes" in its own therapeutic procedures. Galenic medicine depends on the Aristotelian concepts of form and matter. Forms, which Galenic writers called "parts," are the element of control over the whole. Thus, in the body, bones, skin, nerves, and cartilages are similar (homogeneous) parts. The correlative structure with bodily parts is "matter," the material out of which something is formed. Bodily parts impose an articulation to the material; for instance, wood is material that can be fashioned into a table leg, a homogeneous part, but the material also divides into its "parts." Wood exists as planks, and as logs, and those parts too enter into the hierarchy of parts. Consequently, the table leg as part of the table is also the result of being part of the wood. Just as physicians who do not comply with the hierarchy of parts make mistakes in prescribing therapies, so for Gallacini this Galenic rule was also true for architects. In his treatise, Gallacini criticized a "Roman architect" (perhaps Maderno) who ? having learned his profession using wood and stucco in making designs for theatrical architecture ? applied to the "parts in stone" of his buildings the "parts of wood and stucco" (Gallacini 1763: 27). Gallacini's writings were not published in his own time, but in Venice a century later they were taken up by Giovanni Pasquali, a publisher under the influence of Carlo Lodoli. Lodoli, a friar, was a revolutionary "philosopher" of architecture who had a special interest in the study of structure. In Lodolian architecture, analogy as morphology becomes the "logos" generated within technai, such as: xilology (the logos of wood) and lithology (the logos of stone). In presenting his architectural theory Lodoli revived the use of "analogy," an obsolete Greek term for "proportion." For him, analogy is the second essential property in architecture, as the two surviving outlines of a lost Lodolian work show. Knowing both Greek and Latin, and having been trained in the Ars Rhetorica, Lodoli skillfully manipulated language; his usage of the term "analogy" (analog?a) is related to the origin and the use of the word "technology" (tecnolog?a) in Italian. In his historical study of the Italian language, Bruno Migliorini (1960: 572-573) indicates that the first use of the word tecnolog?a occurred in the writings of Algarotti. While he presented Lodoli's theory in his writings, Algarotti produced many words ending with the suffix logia, apparently following Lodoli's usage of the suffix. Lodoli used it in such words as the already mentioned lithology and xilology ? two technai in which an understanding of the physical property of materials dictated the ratio for architectural forms. For Lodoli, composition, by analogy to the dialectical argument, proceeds from one part to another, providing the norms for the proportioning and shaping of structures. This procedure is similar to the second kind of composition presented by Aristotle in his On the Parts of Animals ? a composition resulting from the contiguity of similar parts, such as bones and flesh. Indeed, Memmo metaphorically named this procedure of Lodoli's "osteology" (Memmo 1833-1834, II: 60), indicating that to develop an understanding of the Lodolian design procedure one had to have a grasp of anatomy (Memmo 1833-1834: 123-124). Lodoli's anatomical procedure for interpreting the constructed environment is similar to Vico's anatomical knowledge as presented in the "Scienza Nuova." Because of problems in the publishing of Vico's work in Venice, Lodoli and Vico had a complicated relationship. The Venetian friar derived many of his ideas from Vico's philosophical concepts, which at this time were critically discussed and appreciated in both Venice and Padua. In the pages of the Giornale die Letterati d'ltalia ? the most widely read scholarly journal printed in the V?neto ? an important debate took place discussing Vico's criterion of the union of verum and factum, a duality that was also at the basis of Lodoli's inquiry into the union of function and representation in architectural artifacts (Frascari 1981). Giuseppe Morgagni (d. 1771), a Padua professor of anatomy, developed a parallel model. In his major work, De Sedibus et Causis Morbarum Indagati, Morgagni combines clinical observations (the Vichian verum) with pathological findings (the factum). Using techniques that had been available for years, Morgagni was able to synthesize the clinical observation of organs with the anatomical representation of their pathology. At the beginning of the eighteenth century, the iatromechanists (or medical mechanists) were cele brating their greatest triumphs, with Padua University as their center. In a book published in Venice in 1727, Giorgio Baglivi states: Since doctors have begun to examine the structure and action (efectus) of the animate body on the basis of geometrical and mechanical principles as well as of</page><page sequence="5">84 RES 9 SPRING 85 physical, mechanical and chemical experiments, they have not only discovered innumerable phenomena unknown to preceding centuries, but have also realized that as far as its natural action is concerned the human body is nothing more than a complex system of mechanical and chemical movements that obey mathematical laws. (Baglivi 1727: 78) The iatromechanical hypothesis was developed by analogical procedures. The principle held that life is movement and that living bodies are, by analogy, machines: "Whoever examines the bodily organism with attention will certainly not fail to discern pincers in the jaws and teeth; a container in the stomach; water mains in the veins . . ." (Baglivi 1727: 79) ? an analogy derived from the mechanical principles presented by Descartes in De Homine. The iatromechanical view, therefore, reversed Vico's understanding of the human acquisition of knowledge. Anatomy is no longer the base for taxis; the principles for generating order come from outside of the human body. In the empirical work of Morgagni, however, Vico's criterion is still valid. Morgagni demonstrates clearly an understanding of the procedure of anatomical investigation in his collaborative works with Giuseppe Poleni (d. 1761), where they examined the structure of the human heart? in particular, developing a functional and analytical description of the left ventricle. Poleni published the results of this study in a small printed collection of letters (Poleni 1729: 35). In a letter addressed to Guido Grandi, describing the flexing action generated by the pulsing of the heart on a section of the left ventricle, Poleni presented the cross-section of the heart as two arcs made of chains anchored at their ends to the same points and diverging with uniformly applied tractors located perpendicularly to the tangent. The two chains are also strained tangentially by a force ? called by Poleni "resistance" ? equal to one sixth of the radial force. Poleni's stated aim was to show that analogical procedures are as valid as analytical ones; he demonstrated that the curves produced by his analogical device ? the Machinula ? and the curves calculated analytically by Bernoulli in his De Musculorum Motu Dissertatio differ in magnitude by only a few hundredths of an inch. Poleni also used the Machinula ? a special table with pulleys all around it ? to study the tension in the iron chain encircling the Dome of St. Peter's in Rome. At that time Poleni was in charge of developing a "diagnosis" and "therapy" for a "great patient," the Michelangelo Dome. Poleni published his study and the method of analysis for its restoration and consolidation in the Memorie Istoriche del I a Gran Cupola del Tempio Vaticano (Poleni 1748). His study of the dome followed the same procedure as Morgagni's in De Sedibus, relating anatomical findings to clinical "histories." Poleni's anatomical inquiry of the Dome began with an "architectural anamnesis," a survey of hard and soft data. Then, at the end of the study, Poleni proposed an architectural diagnosis and a prognosis; he also proposed preventive therapy and prescribed a placebo ? an unnecessary iron ring.2 Exercitationes Vitruvianae is Poleni's major theoretical work in the field of architecture. Its content was further developed by his pupil Simone Stratico, a physician who proceeded from the study of animate bodies to the "inanimate bodies" of buildings. Member of a Venetian noble family that moved to Zara from Candia (Crete) after Venice lost the island, Stratico studied in Padua, graduating in medicine under the guidance of Morgagni in 1753. Four years later, he was appointed professor of medicina theorica. For ethical reasons involving his brother's death, Stratico never practiced medicine, as he says repeatedly in his memoirs (Stratico, ms. 5637). In 1764, he was removed from that chair by the Riformatori dello Studio ? the Trustees of Padua University ? and was appointed to the prestigious chair of architettura civile e militare, vacant since Poleni's death in 1 761. This transfer of Stratico from one chair to another usually is explained by the close work relationship that existed between Morgagni and Poleni, and by the fact that Stratico was an active member in the group working in the Theatrum Philosophia Experimentalis, an experimental laboratory founded by Poleni in 1 740 (Brunetta 1976). It was in this laboratory that many of the experiments devised in common by Morgagni and Poleni took place. Although Stratico did indeed participate in these researches, his interest in the discipline of architecture and the development of his own inquiry into the procedures of architectural knowledge originated in the teachings of Lodoli. Stratico knew Lodoli, and may have heard this influential teacher in Venice at his peripatetic school for young patricians (Torcellan 1963). Furthermore, Stratico had a very personal reason for being grateful to the friar. In his book on Lodolian architecture, Memmo describes how Lodoli had saved the life of the young Stratico by discovering that the soup prepared for a dinner to which 2.

Stratico was also familiar with several of Lodoli's disciples; his first experience in architectural practice was with Filippo Farsetti, an art patron educated by Lodoli (Stratico, ms. 5637: 183, 290). Stratico worked on the design of the garden of Villa Farsetti in S. Maria di Sala, a project based on the Lodolian principle of substitution and on the use of architectural fragments. The layout for the design of the Villa grounds, as well as many of the details, were the work of Charles-Louis Clerisseau (Rykwert 1980: 290), but the realization was carried out by Stratico under the direct supervision of Farsetti. He also designed the botanical section of the garden, a well-known scientific curiosity. By the end of this work Stratico was ready to undertake more advanced studies in architecture. He ended up following Farsetti's advice not to continue studying architecture at the university, however, and to direct his attention toward medicine instead. As one of the provveditori at the University in Padua, Farsetti offered Stratico easy access to the famous medical school (Stratico, ms. 5637). In time, Farsetti also arranged his appointment to the chair of medicina theorica, which he occupied for ten years, until he succeeded, as already mentioned, to the prestigious chair of architettura civile e militare ? Poleni's chair, once occupied by Galileo Galilei himself (Favaro 1917: 157). Stratico had a long, varied, and productive career. After Padua he became professor at the University of Pavia. He was nominated senator in the government of the Regno It?lico, and then of the Regno Lombardo V?neto, even though he had been an active Jacobin in his early life. When he died in 1824, he was the president of the Accademia di Belle Arti in Milan and president of the Istituto Lombardo V?neto (Rossetti 1924). During his stay in Padua, Stratico was very active in the local architectural Sunday school. For many years he was the only juror for the final presentations of the students' work at the Scuola Pratica d'Architettura, a school for carpenters, masons, and stonecutters, which was sponsored by the Venetian Republic and approved by the Riformatori dello Studio in 1771 (Brunetta 1976). This school had been created by Memmo, and grew out of some of the ideas of Lodoli on the education of craftsmen. Stratico's best-known work, published posthumously by his nephew Giulio Pontedera, is his contribution to Exercitationes Vitruvianae, the most comprehensive existing edition of the writings of Vitruvius. Started by Poleni, who wrote the first three Exercitationes and the commentary on the first five books, it consisted of a bibliographical and critical compilation of all preexisting readings and commentaries on the Roman architect. Stratico completed the commentary on the Vitruvian text, wrote five more Exercitationes, compiled the indexes, and selected the illustrations. In addition to his philological study of the text of the theories and commentaries, he included a careful analysis of their graphic illustrations (Vitruvius 1825-1830). Of these last, those that he included in Exercitationes were derived from many architectural treatises ? more than any other, from Giovanni Antonio Maria Rusconi's relatively little known Dell'Architettura Libri Died. Rusconi worked as a proto in the Ducal Palace in Venice with Palladio. His ten books, the work of a lifetime, were published posthumously in 1590. In them, he replaced the traditional generic treatment of technology of the preceding Vitruvian editions and studies with an analysis of that actually employed in contemporary V?neto and central Europe. In his woodcuts, Rusconi collected and illustrated fragments of buildings, explaining their origin by their anatomy. Accordingly, he removed "plaster skin" to show the "bones" of studs or the "ligaments" of reed mats; he anatomically cut through every possible building element in order to make visible what is usually unseen. The ?conographical references for these drawings are not from preexisting treatises of architecture but from Vesalius's revolutionary graphic representation of the human body in his De Fabrica De Corpore Humano, published in Venice in 1534. Pontedera was to have printed another major work by Stratico ? a new translation of Alberti's De Re Aedificatoria, with a history of previous translations and a critical appraisal, but it was never published. The manuscript is at the Marciana, not in the Fondo Stratico, having been purchased privately by the library from Vincenzo Puppi (Stratico, ms. 6295: 1-2, back of the cover; Alberti 1485). It is dedicated to Ottone Calderai, a Vicentine architect who was called Palladio Redivivo by his contemporaries. Bound together with the manuscript is a letter from Calderai thanking Stratico and endorsing the architectural values represented by the new translation. Bound together with this are two other architectural manuscripts ? a copy of the treatise of Filarete and a version of the one by Alvise Cornaro. In the latter, written in 1550, Cornaro, who was also well known as the author of Vita Sobria, a manual of</page><page sequence="7">86 RES 9 SPRING 85 preventive medicine, advocated a "sober architecture" that would result in an appropriate technology for lengthening the life of buildings. Stratico's original theoretical work is "Saggio dei Principii dai quali dipende il giudizio delle opere di architettura civile" (Stratico I, 1819: 103-118). In this work he insists that "measure" is the core of architectural theory: "Measure, number, and outline of what may be added or modified constitute the principles on which the judgment of art and taste are established." Measure, number, and outline are three stages of composition analogous to the three systems of composition advocated by Aristotle. Measure is synthesis, the composition of elements, and is the tool for producing symmetry, in the Vitruvian sense of harmony of measure. The sense of "measure" is the knowledge of "type." Type is not imitation, but "penetration of the object," that is, an understanding of its measure. To explain his concept of measure Stratico makes an analogy between "good design" and "good writing," in the sense of calligraphic representation. A good copyist must know the measure of the words he is copying ? that is, their types ? "to transcribe them correctly" (Stratico, ms. 5340, 5.5) In the process of recognition of the measure ? type ? a copyist, like an architect, is engaged in an anatomical procedure. Stratico's metaphor echoes Aristotle's alphabet metaphor in On the Parts of Animals. Stratico compares the representation of types in architecture to characters of the alphabet. He expressed this concept indirectly in a letter sent to Calderai, presenting him with the translation of De Re Aedificatoria. In it, Stratico discussed Alberti's idea of an unillustrated architectural treatise. Stratico approved of the idea, although he saw a few drawbacks, especially in the exposition of mechanical principles. In discussing this proposal of Alberti's, Stratico pointed out that the Florentine architect had used certain kinds of elementary figures, namely some letters of the Greek and Latin alphabets: the II to indicate the trabeate structure (Alberti 1966, III: 37), the letter O to signify city walls, and the letters L, G, and S combined in different ways to show the profiles of the bases of columns (Alberti 1966, V: 16). In this conceptual use of letter-forms, Stratico saw "the real teaching of the logic of an art," that is, a way of analyzing and individuating the elements on which reasoning itself must be based.3 Stratico saw the human body as the "type" of architecture. This, he explained, was not in order to suggest the proportion of the human body as model, but rather the use of an appropriate modular methodology for the interpretation of the constructed world through design. Stratico goes on to say, however, that it is not even possible to reduce this analogy to abstract modular and proportional systems only, since the human body must primarily be considered as a shape, a unique datum for the interpretations at the origin of the creative process in architecture. The use of the body analogy implies a relationship between two different worlds of discourse: the explicandum and the explicans in medicine, and quod significat and quod significatur in architecture (Vitruvius, I. i 3). The human body is the theorica, whereas the building is the practica of architecture, the Vichian verum and factum. For Stratico, the human body is the "supreme" signifier. In one of his lessons of medicina theorica, which he translated into English, Stratico indicated that an inquiry into the structure of the body is the basic procedure: We know that the human body is the very instrument we mechanically apply and work with in the formation and organization of every species of artificial mechanism ... it is the instrument which shapes the variety of machines and forms. (Stratico, ms. 5628) Stratico bases this inquiry on anatomy: "The human body being the most complex elegant specimen of her [nature's] workmanship . . . [it] serves as a guide to the philosopher to assist him in the unveiling of every other piece of natural mechanism." The human body is a "standard" and every natural species is modeled after it, "even vegetables," and consequently "the finer arts of imitation can never be brought to any degree of perfection without it" (Stratico, ms. 5628). An understanding of the processes of "construing" (theorica) and "constructing" (practica) is the principal aim of the parallel he draws between physician and architect. Labore et Tempore, the motto used on the frontispiece of Exercitaciones, indicates the dominant components of this interpretation of architecture: labore, the scientific research done throughout the constructing, and tempore, the critical evaluation generated by the passing of time. Scientific testing of materials and drawing of static configurations provide a new understanding. In Stratico's Exercitaciones, the exegesis of Vitruvius and his commentators was related to the current practice of building, in order to arrive at 3.

Museo Civico di Padova.</page><page sequence="8">Frasean: A "measure in architecture 87 construing: both physical and mental labor are required to form the idea of a building, which in turn is basic to a critical understanding of architecture. In this process, criticism and self-criticism are related; one cannot be exerted without some practice of the other. The architect [and] the critic cannot leave out of consideration the object of the arrangements and disposition of each member of the building, the checking of their placing and spacing in relationship to others, and disapproving bad selection and disposition. Because anyone who judges a building must be learned in the principles of the art, not content with a visual impression, he must be able to exert suitable observation not only in drawings (desegni), but also in the construction (fabbrica). (Vitruvius 1825-1830, Exerc. V) In other words, the processes of producing as well as of learning are based on the acquisition of theoretical and practical knowledge. In this way, "firmness" can be understood as depending on two concomitant points of view. On the one hand, there is "real firmness," which is understood through the testing of materials and static configurations; on the other hand, there is "apparent firmness," which is understood through historical criticism. He developed the Lodolian idea of the union of function and representation, taking into account another Lodolian idea, that of apparenza. A beam, a column, and a cantilever are understood through a new system of references. At Padua University these geometric and anthropomorphic diagrams of traditional architecture were replaced by structural diagrams and the analysis of materials. The norms generated by this vision of technology produce "real firmness." A successful architecture must fulfill all three traditional categories, however. Consequently, technological norms for "apparent firmness" developed. They were derived from the historical apparatus and constitute the rules for a design method conceived as the inner structural force generating architectural forms. Stratico clarified this procedure in an explanation of representation that uses numbers and lines, that is, drawings. Architectural drawings are understood as graphic representation of the interweaving of theorica and practica in the making of a design. Thus, he reformed the three traditional Vitruvian graphic devices: iconography, orthography, and scenography are presented not as plan, elevation, and perspective, but as highly sophisticated tools for analyzing the relationships among the parts. Iconography is not a fully developed plan, but a rough outline of overlapping plans that attempt to show and analyze the relationships among the base structure and the parts required by the plan from foundation to roof. Orthography is the representation of the fa?ade (imago fronds), complete with structural and formal detailing and presented in layers of the construction, crossing from outside to inside, to outside again (opera futuri figura). The effect of concealed details, the invisible on the visible, is represented in one drawing. Scenography is a kind of parallel vision in sequence, a reconnoitering of the body of the building through a sequence of mental views. These modes of drawing are not specification drawings, but are used, as Stratico claims Vitruvius intended, "to think and invent" (Vitruvius 1825-1830, Exerc. VII). They are the architect's tools, his regular exercise in architectural thinking. Concluding this consideration of the sense of measure and the relationship existing between architecture and medicine, one might note that Stratico's method singles out the intersection between Homo sapiens and Homo faber ? that is, the union of the knowing of the making with the inverse and reciprocal proposition that making is knowing. In Greek usage, the art of architecture might be considered the principal techne. Techne is an activity that proceeds by rational methods toward a specific productive end, a practica. The polar opposite is episteme, a theoretical knowledge, a theorica. Both have a common origin, however. For instance, in the fifth century b.c. and during the age of Sophist culture, techne was used interchangeably with episteme. In the field of fine arts of that time, as in Egypt and elsewhere well before (see Davis 1982), the knowledge of the canon (episteme) was inseparable from productive procedures. It was the disciples of Plato who, following clues given by their master, began the process of separating the two by relegating the technai within the realm of doxa (Isnardi Parente 1966). This Platonic procedure resulted in a separation between epistemology and ontology, that is, between the origin and the nature of knowledge. In both architecture and medicine, that there is a division between knowledge and production has been claimed and disclaimed many times. There have always been two chairs in Italian universities: medicina practica and medicina theorica. In architecture the same division exists. For instance, Vincenzo Scamozzi, in his Idea dell'Architettura Universale, states: Architecture can be considered in two ways, as can all the sciences, and all the liberal arts; one way is in relation to the perfection of knowledge, the other in relation to the end</page><page sequence="9">88 RES 9 SPRING 85 and accomplishment of the work. That is, by Theoretica and by Practica. (Scamozzi 1615: VII: 1-3) Vincenzo's father, or perhaps Vincenzo himself, using his father's name, made the following entry in the index to Sebastiano Serlio's Books of Architecture: "Practica is in the hand and Theorica is in the mind and it is recognized that the former is inferior to the latter" (Serlio 1619: 5). The division of architecture and medicine into practica and theorica was felt so strongly that it generated an iconographical representation, a locus classicus. Practica and Theorica, as female figures, had become twin emblems in every architectural treatise. Daniele B?rbaro used them in the frontispiece to his translation and commentary on the Vitruvian text. Palladio, Barbaro's "beloved architect," used them in his frontispiece. Serlio and Scamozzi used the two female figures in the richly decorated proscenium arch designed by Inigo Jones for the Masque Albion's Triumph. Cesare Ripa gave a full verbal and visual description of these two female figures in his Iconolog?a. He is quite explicit in relating expressions and contents: Theorica is concerned with reason and operation of intellect; Practica with operations and movements of the senses... the former contemplates highest causes, the latter investigates lowest effects, so that one is the summit and the other is the foundation of the whole fabric of human discourse. (Ripa 1645:217) In Italian the terms practica and theorica are feminine singular adjectives. When used substantively, they have two references. In the first sense the noun implied is conoscienza (science, knowledge); in the second sense, the noun is parte (part). The English translation of these two terms is not "practice" and "theory," but two obsolete terms, "practic" and "th?orie." Thus, it is correct to say that the practic and th?orie science of architecture is part practic and part th?orie. To investigate architecture as a productive mode in the construction of critical knowledge, one must analyze its original articulation into these two parts. Technology is the common term in this complex interaction; at one time understood to mean the art of discourse (techne of the logos), its present meaning is that of discourse on the arts (logos on the techne). A transformation occurred in the eighteenth century when techne was changed from a subject into an object. The need to investigate the mode selected for a discourse is then understandable. This selection is not only methodological, but ontological, since it concerns man's being as the basis of knowledge. In architecture as well as in medicine the human body, as both subject and object of knowledge, allows for and implies a unity of origins and ends. In this sense, both disciplines lose their present dimension of "absolute planning," becoming once again hermeneutical activities based on a conception of measure. The measure for us is traditionally human, as first voiced in Protagoras's dictum: "Man is the measure of all things." BIBLIOGRAPHY Alberti, Leon Battista 1966 De Re Aedificatoria (1485). Orlandi ed.
