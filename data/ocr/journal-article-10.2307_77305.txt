Department of Human Anatomy, South Parks Road, Oxford, OX1 3QX Scientific investigation of the behaviour of animals in relation to environ- mental goals, and of the performance of the stabilizing systems which regulate the internal environment of their cells, was for many years frus- trated by a kind of vitalism which effectively excluded such investigation from the proper province of natural science. Many modern biologists regard the definition of biological goals and the study of the means by which they are attained as the essential stuff of physiology in general and of neurophysiology in particular. My task is to trace in outline the changing attitudes which have been taken up by natural scientists towards the essential characters of 'higher' animals including man. These include the obvious solidarity and 'wholeness' of the individual; the orderly differentiation of structure as the embryo develops from the fertilized egg; the adult's 'active maintenance of normal and specific structure' (Haldane I930); and its 'purposeful' reaction to, and probing of, its environment - behaviour which determines its ability to survive and reproduce. 'The abstraction of structure and function is at bottom merely a question of what changes slower or faster' (Ritchie 1936). The earliest attitude was that all these phenomena were mani- festations of the workings within the animal of a creative and unifying super- natural force. This attitude led to much fascinating but inconclusive discussion, but was sterile in helping man to greater mastery of nature - for example, of his own health, and of the health and fertility of his crops and animals. When the application of physics and chemistry to biology led to an impressive increase in control, the earlier attitude changed to a lack of interest in, or rejection of, teleology, which had contributed little or nothing to this improved control. Medical and agricultural progress has continued, with still-gathering pace. Latterly, however, a fresh change of attitude has recognized that the formulation of problems in terms of 'control systems' within the body, and of 'goal-seeking' behaviour in animals, has positive heuristic value. It need not invoke the supernatural. Adap- tation to environment is an essential fact of evolution. 'The engineering physicist in building end-seeking automata has sanctified the use of teleological jargon. It seems unfortunate that the term "teleology" should be resurrected and, as I think, abused in this way. The biologist's long-standing confusion would be more fully removed if all end-directed systems were described by some other term, like "teleonomic", in order to emphasize that the recognition and description of end- directedness does not carry a commitment to Aristotelian teleology as an efficient 79</page><page sequence="2">C. G. Phillips (Discussion Meeting) causal principle... The study of adaptation is not an optional preoccupation with fascinating fragments of natural history, it is the core of biological study' (Pitten- drigh I958). Monod (I970) uses 'teleonomie' throughout his book. When the Zoological Society was founded, doctors and naturalists believed that the structures and functions of living animals were directed and integrated by vital forces. Xavier Bichat, who had died a quarter of a century earlier at the age of 31, had been, during his brief career, the most popular teacher of anatomy in France. In Paris 'students flocked to his lectures, which were a stimulating rapid- fire of question and comment, an interchange of ideas between professor and student, rather than a set exposition of established facts' (Olmsted I945). So his teaching remained influential for a generation after his death. 'Bichat had laid hold of a great idea, one which rapidly spread from the land in which it was first expounded to other lands, and has in a most marked way helped to make phys- iology an exact science, the idea that the life of the body is the outcome of the combined and adjusted lives of the constituent tissues. By his brilliant exposition of this fruitful idea, he had opened up new ways for an exact experimental analysis of physiological phenomena' (Foster I899). He taught that the 'vital properties' of the tissues were in conflict, and not in harmony, with the physical forces which held sway in the world outside the animal, and that the vital forces, unlike the physical forces, were labile and unpredictable in their action. After death, the unopposed action of the physical forces was the cause of the body's decay. All this led him, in all seriousness, to define Life as 'the sum total of functions which resist death'. Vitalism, meaning the pushing-around of matter by occult forces, goes back to Aristotle's 'entelechy'. Jean Fernel's writings on physiology, which were much read throughout Europe from the mid-sixteenth to the mid-seventeenth centuries, taught that the soul entered the human foetus from beyond the stars, on or about the 40th day: until that moment, the foetus was part of the mother. 'No problem of the integration of the body would exist for Fernel, or if it did would be already answered. The integration of the body would be by means of the soul' (Sherrington I940). For Bichat there was a problem, since he believed that the different tissues had different 'vital properties'. But belief in vital forces, whether single or multiple, denied any possibility of scientific investigation of living bodies by physical and chemical measurements - whether of separable processes or of the integration of separate processes into a harmonious whole. Cuvier, who was still alive in the year of the Zoological Society's foundation, actually asserted that the experimental method was not applicable to living animals. He thought that physiology could only be deduced from anatomy, since all parts of the body are interlinked, and cannot function at all if they do not all act together; and that any attempt to isolate any part or process from the whole simply transfers that part to the category of inanimate matter and completely alters its nature. Claude Bernard (i865), more than anyone else, was responsible for stemming and turning this tide of experimental nihilism. How, he asked, could physiology be [ 80 ] 416</page><page sequence="3">On integration and teleonomy deduced from anatomy? Anatomy includes two orders of description: first, of mechanical function, as in Harvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood; secondly, the structure of the tissues and organs which cause the parts to move. Only the mechanical functions can be deduced from gross anatomy. Harvey saw that the systoles of the heart muscle pump the blood and that the valves allow it to be pumped in one direction only. From the points of attachment of skeletal muscles, we can see the ways in which their shortening must act on the joints. But no gross inspection, even of living muscle, can tell us the secrets of how it is excited and how it contracts. Bernard held that such secrets are amenable to investigation by the methods of chemistry and physics; that, given identical conditions, the phenomena will invariably occur; and that they can be predictably prevented from appearing by removing, one at a time, some of the physical or chemical conditions which are necessary for their occurrence. These postulates he called Determinism. Absolute determinism, whether in physical or biological science, means simply the ability to reproduce a given phenomenon at will. If an experiment is not repeatable, the conclusion should be that one or more of the necessary conditions are unfulfilled, not that the phenomenon is essentially capri- cious and has no respect for natural law. All this was obvious to physical scientists, but not to naturalists and, above all, not to doctors. At a meeting of the Philo- mathic Society in 1845, Gerdy, a surgeon who was also a physiologist, challenged Bernard's belief in physiological determinism. He asserted that in patients with identical illnesses, the same drugs could give different results, and the same operation could lead to cure in one case and to death in another. Such caprice was unknown in the physical world. The consensus of the meeting was against the surgeon. Those who took part in the discussion told him that the supposed identity of the conditions in his patients was illusory, and that on this false basis he was denying the possibility of a scientific biology. Bernard was concerned only with the immediate determinants of biological phenomena, not with their ultimate causes. The scientist can manipulate the immediate determinants in order to gain control of the phenomena. He is not after Absolute Truth; provided that he knows the precise interrelations of the phenom- ena and has thereby brought them under control, his purpose is achieved. He aims where possible to establish numerical relations between causes and effects. But in comparison with the physical sciences, 'les difficultes se multiplient a raison de la delicatesse des conditions des phenomenes vitaux, de la complexite et de la solidarit6 de toutes les parties qui se groupent pour constituer un etre organise' (Bernard 1865). In Man's intellectual warfare against indeterminism, success is measured by the ground gained for determinism by the experimental method. For not answering his questions about ultimate reality, Science compen- sates him by increasing his power over Nature. Bernard's view of scientific procedure remains interesting. He valued philoso- phical argument as a mental exercise but not as a means to discovery. He admired Bacon's genius, but followed De Maistre in thinking that those who have made [ 81 ] 417</page><page sequence="4">C. G. Phillips (Discussion Meeting) the most discoveries have not read Bacon, and that Bacon himself discovered nothing by his method. Intuition comes naturally and universally to the human mind, and leads equally naturally to the building up of scholastic and theological systems. What does not come naturally is to put one's intuitions to the test of experiment. The systematic observer of natural phenomena, or the experimentalist who 'provokes' an observation, may discover a new fact; but the essence of the discovery is an idea which relates the fact to other facts already framed in a hypo- thesis. The hypothesis suggests a fresh experiment, or the need to keep an eye open for a significant observation which may present itself by chance. The new phenomenon accords with the hypothesis ? All the more reason for not accepting it as verification. Some necessary condition, required by the hypothesis, must be removed in a further experiment and the phenomenon must be shown not to occur. Facts which are unattached to ideas, or hypotheses which are untestable by experiment or observation, lead nowhere, No rules can be given to teach people to get ideas by brooding on collections of data. Bernard (1865) writes of 'une sorte d'anticipation intuitive de l'esprit vers une recherche heureuse. . C'est un sentiment particulier, un quid proprium qui constitue l'originalite, l'invention ou le genie de chacun.' After a period of stagnation, there may come a sudden intuition, 'une sorte de pressentiment de l'esprit qui juge que les choses doivent se passer d'une certaine maniere'. Then the experimenting and observing can begin. Bernard regarded scientific theories as relative and provisional. No one should be paralysed by childish fears of having his theories proved wrong. To some unnamed forerunner he ascribes the dictum that science is better served by error than by confusion. Bernard never minimized the complexity and 'wholeness' of living organisms. 'Le physiologiste et le m6decin ne doivent done jamais oublier que l'etre vivant forme un organisme et une individualite.' He was concerned only that it should not be allowed to forbid as useless their dismantling by experimentation. But to do physiology without keeping in mind the essential unity and harmony of the organism would be to ignore the essential character of biological science. The activities going on in the living body are all harmonized reciprocally in such a way that it might seem impossible, as indeed it had seemed to Cuvier, to isolate any part without thereby disorganizing the whole. Needham (I936) calls this 'the thanatological difficulty in biology'. So, in dismantling the living organism and working on its separated parts and processes, we must never forget that we do this simply to facilitate their experimental analysis and not at all because their bio- logical significance can be understood in isolation. It is always necessary to re- assemble, conceptually, physiological processes thus artifically isolated ('synthese physiologique') and to interpret their biological significance as parts of the whole. 'Ces elements, quoique distincts et autonomes, ne jouent pas pour cela le role de simples associes...leur union exprime plus que l'addition de leurs proprietes s6parees.' Determinism is harmonized hierarchically: complex physiological phenomena are determined by simpler phenomena. Thus, the 'simpler' primary [ 82 ] 418</page><page sequence="5">On integration and teleonomy action of curare poisoning in blocking motor nerve endings causes paralysis of the respiratory movements whose secondary 'complex' actions result in death of the organism and of all its tissues. Bernard defined General Physiology as the essential biological science on which all the other biological sciences are founded. Its task is to discover the elemental phenomena of plant and animal life. These he thought could occur only within intact histological structures, capable of responding to stimuli. They could not be further reduced even to the most complex chemical compounds which are syn- thesized within the organism from simpler compounds and which can be extracted from it ('produits organiques, mais non organises'). He wrote of anatomical and histological 'elements' but not, as far as I have discovered, of the cell. General Physiology could not yet include embryology. For there remained for Bernard a residue of physiological properties which could not be described in terms of physical and chemical processes, 'vital properties' which had not yet been reduced to phys- icochemical processes, though 'il n'est pas douteux qu'on y arrivera un jour'. Experimental interference with an embryo can make it develop abnormally, but cannot produce a dog from a rabbit's embryo. 'Une idee cr6atrice', 'l'idee direc- trice': these he had to invoke, provisionally, when thinking about the development of structure and organization in the embryo and its maintenance in the adult. By i940, Sherrington could write confidently of embryology, 'Chemistry holds the key'. We can agree with Jacob (I970) that Bernard's essential difficulty has been removed by the discovery that development and maintenance is 'directed' by a programme coded as a sequence of chemical radicals (ranging in length from about 1.0 mm in bacteria to 2 m in man) whose exact replication at every cell-division, and whose immunity from environmental intervention, we now understand almost completely; though we still have much to learn about the details whereby the programme produces its effects in the higher animals. Bernard's greatest generalization was that the obvious integrity of the higher animal in its complex traffic with its cosmic environment, exchanging molecules and heat, maintaining its structure, and reacting to stimuli as a unit, depends not on any single mysterious force which contravenes the physico-chemical laws of the cosmos, but on the maintenance of a whole complex of organized and stabilized physico-chemical conditions within its body. The higher animal maintains within its body a constant internal environment whose stability contrasts with the fluctu- ations of its cosmic environment. The internal environment is 'a true product of the organism'. Bernard believed himself to have been one of the first to carry experimentation into the internal environment, to try to follow step by step the chemical processes which the chemists were explaining theoretically. 'A Dutch chemist' had compared the drawing up of a balance sheet of substances absorbed and substances excreted with trying to find out what was going on inside a house by noting what went in at the door and what came out of the chimney. Bernard broke into the house. His brilliant discoveries of the glycogenic function of the liver and the rest, important as they were in themselves, were important also in [ 83 ] 419</page><page sequence="6">C. G. Phillips (Discussion Meeting) that they led to his general conception of the internal environment, which still occupies a central position in modern integrative physiology. The conception was developed further in Cannon's book, The wisdom of the body (1932). Cannon introduced the word 'homeostasis', updated the details of regu- lation of water, salts, glucose, acid-base balance, oxygen, body temperature, etc., and presented evidence of the role of the autonomic nervous system in integrating the regulatory processes. In J. S. Haldane's classic studies of the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between man and his external environment, of the reg- ulation of the acid-base equilibria of the internal environment, and of the responses of the respiratory movements to chemical stimuli at rest and in exercise, the techniques were physical and chemical, but the whole fruitful research was conceived on teleonomic lines. 'The account I have given of the phenomena of breathing is based on the conception that breathing is a manifestation of the coordinated maintenance which is denoted by the life of an organism. Apart from this conception it does not seem to me to be possible to give any useful scientific account of breathing' (Haldane I930). Haldane &amp; Priestley (i935) wrote of the waxing and waning amplitude of the respiratory movements when the balance of stimulation by CO2 and O2 was disturbed experimentally or in disease: 'The res- piratory governor is "hunting" just as the governor of a steam engine or turbine hunts if there is no heavy flywheel or other steadying influence.' At that time everyone had heard of thermostats and governors. Many new control systems, and much sophisticated control theory, have since been introduced into engineering practice, with plenty of suggestive implications for biological research (Bayliss I966). Barcroft (i934) took as text for the first three chapters of his classic Architecture of physiological function another mot of Bernard's: 'La fixite du milieu interieur est la condition de la vie libre.' What impressed Barcroft was the nature of the symptoms experienced by people in whom the levels of oxygen, glucose, temper- ature, etc. of the internal environment had been pushed beyond the very narrow limits within which they are normally regulated. Inertia, delirium, incoordination, convulsions, coma - all signs of dysfunction of the brain. 'La vie libre' goes beyond the freedom to tolerate a wide range of climatic and other conditions in the external environment; it includes the ability to explore, to manipulate, to understand and to control it. Evidently the brain, on which these abilities depend, could not have evolved to this high pitch except within a rigorously-stabilized internal environ- ment. Barcroft headed three further chapters 'Every Adaptation is an Integration'. The first of these was about how the mother adapts herself to the demands of the foetus for oxygen. The uterine circulation increases before the foetus is large enough to make any significant demands. Changes of pH of the maternal blood cause a shift in the dissociation curve of the maternal haemoglobin; the dissociation curve of foetal haemoglobin is different from that of the adult. These separable adaptations are integrated to achieve the physiological goal. The other two [ 84 ] 420</page><page sequence="7">On integration and teleonomy chapters illustrate the principle in the cases of adaptation of the circulation and respiration to exercise and to the anoxia of high altitudes. The integrative action of the nervous system (Sherrington 9o06) was a landmark in thinking about the nervous system and behaviour, in the twin contexts of evolution and the cell doctrine. These doctrines were first founded on morpho- logical studies, but biology later moved beyond static form to 'energetics'. Nerve- cells are not only, like all other cells, nutritional units; they are also excitable and conducting units and, above all, integrative units. In the multicellular animal, 'especially for those higher reactions which constitute its behaviour as a social unit in the natural economy, it is nervous reaction which par excellence integrates it, welds it together from its components, and constitutes it from a mere collection of organs an animal individual'. Chemical integration was already well known, for example, in the onset of lactation after denervation of the mammary glands; and the first of the gastrointestinal hormones had just been discovered by Bayliss and Starling. These integrations involve 'no living channel of communication' except the bloodstream. Nervous integration by contrast 'works through living lines of stationary cells along which it dispatches waves of physico-chemical disturbance, and these act as releasing forces in distant organs where they finally impinge'. There are receptors, conductors and effectors. 'The reflex arc is the unit mechanism of the nervous system when that system is regarded in its integrative function.' Reflex actions are elemental items of behaviour which can be studied to advantage in the spinal cord after it has been separated by transection from the brain. In the early nineteenth century there had been controversy about whether the apparently purposive reflex activities of the spinal cord were directed by an occult force, the 'spinal cord soul' (Liddell I960). Sherrington pointed out that this controversy occurred, significantly, before the publication of the Darwinian theory of evolution. 'The latter suggests how purposive neural mechanisms may arise. It furnishes a key to the genesis and development of adapted reactions and, among these latter, reflexes.' 'That a reflex action should exhibit purpose is no longer considered evidence that a psychical process attaches to it; let alone that it represents any dictate of "choice" or "will". In the light of the Darwinian theory every reflex must be purposive. We here trench upon a kind of teleology... Older writings on reflex action concerned themselves boldly with the purpose of the reflexes they described. The language in which they are couched shows that for them the interest of the phenomena centred in their being regarded as manifestations of an informing spirit resident in the organism, lowly or mutilated though that might be. Progress of knowledge has tended more and more to unseat this anthropomorphic image of the observer himself which he projected into the object of his observations. The teleological speculations accompanying such observations have become propor- tionately discredited. 'Self-wounded in this way, physiology became for a time extremely reticent about purpose, remaining simply objectively descriptive. [ 85 ] 421</page><page sequence="8">422 C. G. Phillips (Discussion Meeting) 'The impetus given to biology by the doctrine of adaptation under natural selection, felt so strongly by morphological studies, seems hardly as yet to have begun its course as a motive force in physiology. But signs begin to be numerous that such an era is at hand. The infinite fertility of the organism as a field for adapted reactions has become more apparent. The purpose of a reflex seems as legitimate and urgent an object for natural inquiry as the purpose of the colouring of an insect or a blossom. And the importance to physiology is, that the reflex reaction cannot be really intelligible to the physiologist until he knows its aim.' (Sherrington 1906) The simpler reflexes, for example those local reflexes which withdraw a cat's limb from a potentially injurious stimulus, are compounded into larger, coordinated reflex patterns, for example those which support the body by reflex extension of the remaining three limbs and which adjust the muscles of the trunk when the threatened limb is lifted off the ground. 'Hence it is that we see eminently what Herbert Spencer has insisted on, namely, that integration keeps pace with differentiation.' In the working of the brain, Sherrington saw that the connections between input and output were much less direct, and that behaviour was less stimulus-bound than in the case of the spinal reflexes. It is dominated by the distance-receptors, 'the great inaugurators of reaction'. This sort of behaviour involves elaborate sequences of action 'focussed upon a final consummatory event'. During the time needed to complete the sequence, there would be scope for 'memory and anti- cipatory forecast; and nothing, it would seem, could tend to select more potently the individuals taking the right course than the success which crowns that course, since the consummatory acts led up to are such - e.g. the seizure of prey, escape from enemies, attainment of sexual conjugation, etc. - as involve the very existence of the individual and the species'. In the primates, the special developments of binocular stereoscopic vision, eye-hand coordination, and, in man, speech, 'have, with the developments of central nervous function which they connote and pro- mote, been probably the chief factors in man's outstripping other competitors in progress toward that aim which seems the universal goal of animal behaviour, namely to dominate more completely the environment'. Sherrington's greatest achievement was, however, in the area of 'physiological production and execution' rather than in that of biological significance. His experiments were brilliant and clear-cut. His conclusion that the essential proper- ties of reflex action, and by extension, of all central nervous action, are ultimately dependent on the synapse, and his other major generalizations, which include the principle of convergence, the competition of reflexes for the final common path, and the supreme integrative role of synaptic inhibition, are the foundations of modern neurophysiology. In the planning of modern experiments, especially on the control of movement by feedback from the muscles (the stretch reflex), teleonomic thinking has often been found useful (Granit I972, I975). Integrative thinking has been applied for more than 40 years by R. A. Peters [ 86 ]</page><page sequence="9">On integration and teleonomy (I963) to the problem of the coordination of biochemical activities within the cell, which A. V. Hill once described as 'a complex organized system of enzymes, interfaces, potential and osmotic differences, chemical substances; infinitely im- probable in the thermodynamic sense, and yet existing in a steady state so long as free energy is available to maintain the organization'. Surface effects, occurring within minute compartments, would be more important than the ordinary stat- istical mass action effects in solutions of infinite volume. Integration of activities would be brought about by an organized mosaic of protein molecules extending in three dimensions throughout the cell. Of this network the enzymes would form part. 'Independent chemical reactions could proceed simultaneously in various parts of the cell, but at the same time the mosaic could react as a whole to stimuli transmitted from the cell surface.' Since 1929, when these ideas were first published, much has been learned of cell ultrastructure and of conformational changes in enzymes, of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, and of the actions of transmitters and hormones on cells. Every mitochondrion has about 1.7 x104 'repeating enzyme units'. Between nucleus, mitochondria and membranes, are we dealing with 'just a loose bag of enzymes and other constituents such as proteins, which orient themselves by simple equilibrium alone ? - or have we to consider something more organized ?' There are the ribosomes and the rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, the former increased by feeding cysteine. The need is for 'techniques which will enable us to integrate our present knowledge of enzymes with the action of these remarkable interfacial structures'. Reflection for many years prior to 1929 convinced Peters of the need to borrow 'conceptions from physiology, and especially from neurology'. Descriptive biochemistry and dynamic biochemistry must be complemented by 'coordinative biochemistry'. 'The cell must be con- sidered as a reflex entity, structurally organized so far as even its chemistry is concerned, with chains of chemical substances acting as it were as reflex arcs. The surfaces presented by the more highly organized molecules and particularly the proteins I regard as a kind of central nervous system' (Peters 1963). The concept of hierarchical levels of organization of the central nervous system, representing successive stages in its evolution, was taken from Herbert Spencer by Hughlings Jackson in the nineteenth century. The same general concept is still being exploited with profit in biology (Jacob 1970). Jacob has minted the useful word 'Integron'. 'Un integron se forme par l'assemblage d'int6grons de niveau inferieur; il participe a la construction d'un int6gron de niveau superieur.' Evo- lution has depended on 'la relation 6tablie entre la structure de l'organisme dans l'espace et la s6quence lineaire du message genetique. Car la complexite d'un integration se traduit alors par la simplicite d'une addition.' What has evolved is not matter but organization. 'C'est par l'integration que change la qualite des choses. Car une organisation possede souvent des propri6t6s qui n'existent pas au niveau inf6rieur. Ces propriet6s peuvent 8tre expliquees par celles des constituents, mais non pas en etre deduites.' Polanyi (1968) has expressed the same idea in terms of 'a hierarchy of boundary conditions'. Natural selection operates on the [ 87 ] 423</page><page sequence="10">C. G.
