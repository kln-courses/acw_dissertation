<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRINS, A. H. J. Sailing from Lamu: a study of maritime culture in Islamic east Africa. xii, 320 pp., front., illus., plates, map, bibliogr. Assen: van Gorcum, 1965. Fl. 25 Dr Prins's intention is to present a full-scale analysis of the' maritime culture' of the island of Lamu and the East African coast, which is part of a broader one embracing the 'Arabo- Persian' and Asian maritime cultures. But it is distinct because of its Bantu links and its Swahili linguistic base, a culture at once 'Islamic, African and maritime'. After Dr Prins's earlier writings on the people of Lamu and the coast, one approaches this book with pleasurable anticipation. The publisher's blurb raises one's interest further, stating that the author deals with the prob- lems, among others, of 'language in culture' and 'nature and culture', some of these in 'mathematical fashion'. But the book turns out to be oddly disappointing. True, these problems are discussed, but at such a low level of analysis that no new theoretical formula- tions or insights emerge. Indeed, at the end of the book Dr Prins himself disarms us by quoting Hoyer (1963): 'only after having gone through "a great deal of laborious work on things we really see or can find out immediately can we arrive at higher levels of abstraction".' He adds,' the main value of this book should be in "the laborious work on things we really see".' There is a great deal of valuable ethno- graphic detail in this study, most of which has not been described before. There are also a number of deep insights. But these lie buried in a discursive narrative which is a curious amalgam of an evocative style on the one hand and extraordinarily disconcerting verbal inaccuracies on the other (pp. 32 and 33 provide a random example). Intriguing details of ritual and cosmology, such as appear at launchings (pp. 96 sqq.), on the catching of an nguva (dugong,' a rather anthropomorphic fish', p. 146), in sailing competitions (pp. 254-7), and many more, are scattered erratically through the text with no integrative analysis. The relation between calendrical events and the notion of baraka, 'blessing', is described in some detail, if not clarity (pp. 160-1); but the analysis is taken no further. Chapter 9 is probably the most interesting. Dr Prins explains the distinction between indebted and non-indebted sailors (bahariya na deni and bahariya hana deni), and how indebtedness increases the stability and availability of crew members. But hopes of a future detailed sociological analysis of Lamu are dashed when Dr Prins maintains that the very fluidity and adaptability of the culture precludes any such analysis. This is in spite of the fact that he mentions in passing some really deep and important problems</page><page sequence="2">SOCIAL ANTHROPOLOGY I47 which he himself has elsewhere considered in outline. The richness of Lamu and east African coastal culture is admirably presented, especially with regard to the economics of fishing, sailing, and boat ownership, the technicalities of boat building and handling, and some excellent quotations from Swahili poetry and aphorisms. The photographs are very good and there is a valuable 'nautical glossary'. However, apart from the looseness of expression which makes it difficult to read, this book is marred by an astonishing number of misprints and editorial laxities. Both the translation and rendering of some Swahili passages are severely affected by this. PETER RIGBY</page></plain_text>
