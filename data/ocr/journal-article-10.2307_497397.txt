BATES, Editor ?P0, St. Mark's Square, Philadelphia, Pa. GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS The Protohistoric Ages in Barbarian Europe.-In R. Arch., fifth series, I, 1915, pp. 47-70 (map), LioN JOULN continues his treatise on the protohistoric ages in barbarian Europe (ibid., fourth series, XXIV, 1914, pp. 59-98, A.J.A. XVIII, 1914, p. 499) with a discussion of the fourth and third centuries B.C. A summary is given of the migrations, political changes, and archaeological evidence relating to Scythia, Italy, the countries north and east of the Alps, Gaul, and the Hispanic peninsula. Ibid. pp. 259-282, the second and first centuries B.C. are treated in a similar manner. The treatise closes with a statement of general conclusions. Art and Reality.-In R. Arch. XXIV, 1914, pp. 231-265, W. DEONNA dis- cusses the relations of art and reality, enumerating some of the material and spiritual factors which make up a work of art and showing how various are the reasons for the differences which exist between works of art and the realities represented by them. The Rectangular in Art.-In 'Apx. 'E4. 1914, pp. 25-49 (33 figs.), F. VER- SAKES discusses the origin, development, and influence of the working in paral- lel and perpendicular planes which characterized the early stages of Greek sculpture, and from which Lacedaemonian sculpture never entirely freed itself. Most attempts to explain the flatness and angularity of the early work do the artists an injustice, interpreting their inability to execute as an inability to see and comprehend form. Neither Brunn's theory, which explains these characteristics as derived from the shape of the plank, beam, or log used by wood-carvers, nor that of Hildebrand and of Loewy, which derives them from a flat, geometric conception of objects seen from a distance, hits the mark. The explanation is to be found rather in the transfer to stone of the artistic 1 The departments of Archaeological News and Discussions and of Bibliography of Archaeo- logical Books are conducted by Professor BATES, Editor-in-charge, assisted by Professor C.

XIX, 1915 traditions, the technique, and especially the tools of the carver of wood and bone. This theory is supported by a study of the bone and poros sculptures of the sanctuary of Artemis Ortheia at Sparta (cf. B.S.A. 1905-6, pp. 320 ff., and 1906-7, pp. 60 ff.) and of the newly discovered archaic sculptures of Corcyra (cf. Versakes, IIpaKTrLK&amp; 1911, pp. 164 ff.). Since this technique persists in Doric work long after Ionic and Attic imitations have progressed beyond it, it is doubtless a Doric invention, originating at Corinth, where carving in wood and bone reached its climax in the production of the Chest of Cypselus. Methods in Archaeology.-In L' Homme prdhistorique, II, 1914, pp. 167-183, 213-220, W. DEONNA points out that caution must be observed in drawing inferences in regard to prehistoric antiquities. The finer finish of a bronze axe does not necessarily mean a later date; nor do resemblances in technique or in shape of primitive vases necessarily prove connection. Such inferences are only justifiable when supported by other evidence. This is a principle which holds true in the whole field of prehistoric archaeology. The Horses of Death and the Under World.-In an article of seventy-seven pages with forty illustrations (Jb. Arch. I. XXIX, 1914, pp. 179 ff.), L. MALTEN has collected and analyzed the ancient beliefs and superstitions which connect the horse and other animals with the idea of death, and inquires into their origin and development. Behind and co-existent with the association of horses with chthonic and other anthropomorphic divinities, as in the chariots of Poseidon, Hades and Helios, is a theriomorphic stage in which these powers are embodied in the animals themselves. In the sophisticated atmosphere of the epic, such ideas survived only as figures of speech, but the primitive beliefs are occasion- ally revealed in tragedy and in later writers, and are abundantly illustrated in the superstitions of northern and central Europe. So, too, in the arts of design, while the horse, like many other objects associated with religion, became a mere attribute and symbol traditionally used, its original significance is illus- trated in the human-headed beasts and beast-headed human forms of Medusa, the sirens, sphinxes, harpies, etc. The double aspect of the horse or other demonic form as representing either the power that brings death or the dead themselves, sometimes both at once, goes back to a time when death was thought of as a summons to follow a superhuman being, to join his band, and take on his form. So Hecuba, dead, becomes a dog attending the dog-demon Hecate. Not only the gods, but many of the human and half-human heroes of Greek mythology, with their wonderful horses, as Adrastus (unescapable) Admetus (untamable), Neleus (pitiless), Laomedon (ruler of the people of the dead), Erechtheus-Erichthonius (lord of the earth beneath), and the non- Greek Bellerophon, were originally chthonic divinities and agents of death. To the Arcadians and to the inland ancestors of the Greeks, Poseidon was a fresh-water divinity, dwelling in the ground, shaking the earth, calling forth springs, making the land fruitful. Only with later oversea migrations did he become a sea-god and drive his horses over the waves. That the horse espe- cially was chosen for identification with these superhuman powers was, per- haps, due as much to his highly nervous temperament, the uncanny sounds that he utters, and his extra-human powers of perception (probably through hearing) as to his trampling hoofs, his swiftness, and his service as a steed. In like manner the vivid imagination of primitive folk felt a demonic character</page><page sequence="3">MISCELLANEOUS] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1915 457 in the dog (Hecate, Cerberus, etc.), in snakes, and in certain birds. As the horse itself was introduced comparatively late into Egypt and Mesopotamia, it plays but a small part in the religion of those lands and of Crete. Animal-shaped Vases and the Drink of Immortality.-In Mitt. Anth. Ges. XLIV, 1914, pp. 17-43 (39 figs.), K. v. SPIESS argues that the prehistoric vases in the shape of animals, the horned birds of bronze, the bronze figures on wheels from Southern Italy, the hanging dove of early Christian times, the birds on Christian monuments, the vessels in the shape of birds, fish- shaped vessels, etc., have to do with the belief in a magic drink which bestows the gift of immortality. The Breasts of the Ephesian Artemis.-In Rim. Mitt. XXIX, 1914, pp. 200-219, M. MEURER argues that the breasts of the Ephesian Artemis were not meant to be parts of the body of the goddess, but represented merely an external ornament derived from a row, or rows, of pendants attached to a crescent-shaped shield. These were naturalized somewhat in later (especially in Roman) times in order to symbolize the character of the goddess. In them and in other adornments of the Ephesian Artemis Egyptian, Carian, and Greek motifs are combined. The Ancient Plough.-The various forms of the ancient, one-handled plough and the meanings of the words used to designate its parts are discussed by A. S. F. Gow (J. H. S. XXXIV, 1914, pp. 249-275; 4 pls.; 14 figs.). The monumental and literary evidence (the latter centering about Hesiod and Virgil) is given in full. The three essential parts are the stock or beam which cuts the earth, the tail by which the ploughman guides the implement, and the pole by which the draught animals draw it. It is conceivable that all three could be combined in their proper relations in a single piece of wood as it grew, and two of them apparently sometimes were so grown. In the more developed forms each of these elements was itself made up of more than one piece or part, and there was even a Gallic (Rhaetian) form with wheels sup- porting the pole. In Greek ploughs the stock seems to have been always horizontal; in Italy it sometimes slanted downward or was nearly vertical. In these same lands the one-handled plough is still in common use. Palaeolithic Masks.-In R. Arch. XXIV, 1914, pp. 300-301, H. BREUIL maintains (against Waldemar Deonna, 'Les masques quaternaires,' L'Anthro- pologie, 1914, p. 107) that in a considerable number of cases the animal heads of human figures in palaeolithic art must be explained as masks. The bison with human head does not exist in palaeolithic art; in Babylonian art it is not a primitive development. Ibid., fifth series, I, 1915, pp. 172-176, W. DEONNA replies, maintaining that, although such masks may have existed, the monu- ments do not as yet prove their existence. Thracian Archaeology.-In R. Arch., fifth series, I, 1915, pp. 71-93 (2 figs.), GEORGES SEURE continues his reports on Thracian archaeology (see R. Arch. XXIV, 1914, pp 54-66, A.J.A. XIX, 1915, p. 180) with discussion of inscrip- tions. No. 129 is a Latin dedication by a veteranus, on an altar from Riben, No. 130 a Greek dedication to Lord Apollo on a pillar from Skolochtitza, No. 131 a Latin dedication Sancto Apollini, on a stele from Mikhiltzi, near Pav- likeni, in the district of Tirnovo. Apollo is identified with the Thracian Horse- man. A temple of Apollo probably existed in Roman times near Mikhiltzi, at a place called Dikili Tach. Remains of two pillars, various columns,</page><page sequence="4">458 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIX, 1915 ruined walls, and fragmentary sculptures at this place are described, on the basis of earlier descriptions. They seem to be among the most important Roman remains in Bulgaria. The discussion of these ruins figures as No. 132. No. 133 is a Latin dedication on a bronze base for the support of a statuette. It comes from Karlovo. Early Sculptures in China.-In C. R. Acad. Inse. 1914, pp. 670-682, H. CORDIER gives an account of the early sculptures examined by him in China in recent years. The oldest piece is a stone horse in front of a general's tomb dating from 117 B.C. Other early pieces date from the first century A.D. An in- teresting group is that of Wou Leang t'seu, in the western part of the province of Chan Toung, dating from the early centuries of the Christian era. These sculptures have been studied by Chinese archaeologists since the eleventh century. The scenes have to do with the legendary history of China, with the emperors Fou Hi and Niu Kua, whose bodies ended in serpents, the visit of Confucius to Lao Tse, etc. A tomb chamber at Hiao t'ang chan, 25 km. northwest of Fei-tch'eng, has scenes representing a royal procession, the god of thunder, domestic scenes, etc. These date from the Han period. These sculptures are to be connected with the art of Gandhara, which flourished from the second century to about 600 A.D. Other interesting examples of early Chinese art are the Buddhistic sculptures of Yun Kang dating from the fifth century; and the horses adorning the tomb of the emperor T'ai Tsoung (627-649 A.D.) at Li-ts'iuan hien. Arabic Numerals.-The paper by G. F. Hill published in Archaeologia, Vol. LXII, has been enlarged and improved and now appears as a book. The chronological and local distribution of the forms of Arabic numerals after they were established in the West is made clear by a large collection of grouped facsimiles. The attempt is made to include everything earlier than 1500, but after that date the examples are selected. Nothing later than the six- teenth century is included. The classification is by country, kind of monu- ment (e.g., manuscripts, seals, monumental), and date. The introduction contains an explanation of the system adopted, statements concerning sources, various explanatory remarks, and an annotated list of some erroneous or doubtful dates.

Arch., fifth series, I, 1915, pp. 13-19, S. REINACH discusses the tale told by Jordanes (De rebus gothicis, X) that Alaric was buried in the bed of the Busento river which was temporarily turned aside by the Goths for the purpose. He finds that the tale has no basis in fact. EGYPT Egyptian Royal Accessions during the Old Kingdom.-In S. Bibl. Arch. XXXVI, 1914, pp. 282-288; XXXVII, 1915, pp. 34-41, F. W. READ seeks to establish that there are no dates indicated on the Palermo Stone; what have been regarded as such are in all cases statements of periods of time, from which, of course, dates can be calculated. The year-spaces on the stone denote regnal years assimilated to civil years; that is to say, every space is equivalent to a civil year except at a change of reign. On such an occasion, the first set of</page><page sequence="5">EGYPT] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1915 459 figures in each pair denotes the portion of the civil year during which the pre- decessor ruled, and the second set the portion of the year during which the successor ruled; the sum of these two deducted from the full year gives the length of the interregnum. When a co-regent died leaving a surviving co- regent, the year in which the death occurred was denoted by one year-space, which was divided to indicate the end of the reign of the deceased co-regent, and in the first portion of which was inserted the length of time in that year reigned by the latter. New Fragments of the Palermo Stone.-In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1914, pp. 489- 496 (pl.), H. GAUTHIER calls attention to four new fragments of the historical inscription known as the "Palermo Stone" acquired by the Cairo museum in 1910. The position of the first of these, which is about the same size as the fragment in Palermo, can be determined with certainty. On one side it has the record of the fourth and part of the third year of Ousirkaf of the fifth dynasty, and the third and part of the second year of his successor, Sahoure. On the other side of the stone is a list of the kings of Upper Egypt. A Will from the Old Empire.-In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1914, pp. 538-546, A. MORET publishes a will from a mastaba at Gizeh dating from the Old Empire which throws light on the rights of the eldest son and on the con- ditions of property at that time. The Nomes of Upper Egypt in the Eighth Dynasty.-In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1914, pp. 565-574 (3 figs.), A. MORET publishes a list of the nomes of Upper Egypt in the eighth dynasty. The stele on which it is engraved was found by Reinach and Weill at Coptos in 1911. The Historical Scarab of King Shabako.-In Or. Lit. XVIII, 1915, cols. 43-45, A. ALT criticizes the report on the scarab of Shabako published by W. M. Miiller, ibid. XVII, 1914, cols. 49-52, and claims that this scarab has already been published by Maspero and that it is of doubtful genuineness. The Names Didas and Dizazelmis.-In R. tt. Anc. XVI, 1914, pp. 399-404 (3 figs.), P. PERDRIZET points out that the name Didas found by A. Reinach near Coptos is not Thracian but Egyptian, and has no connection with Atlas and other similar names. He also shows that the name on a unique coin of Thrace preserved in the British Museum reads At'aShXyews pacrkcw not Atar~E~eEW as published by Head (Historia Numorum, p. 243). The name ALr63X~ur is well attested. Constantinian Coins from Egypt.-In J. Int. Arch. Num. XVI, 1914, pp. 1-27, J. G. MILNE publishes a hoard of Constantinian bronze coins, 6,476 in number, purchased in the Fayim in 1905. They were probably hidden in the ground between 343 and 345 A.D. Three hundred and thirty-five cannot be as- signed to any mint, but the others are distributed as follows: Alexandria, 1,592, Antioch, 1,611, Cyzicus, 845, Nicomedia, 539, Constantinople, 698, Heraclea, 220, Thessalonica, 196, Siscia, 42, Aquileia, 23, Rome, 285, Arelate, 56, Lugdunum, 13, Treviri, 19, Tarraco, 2. The foreign coins probably reached Egypt in the course of trade.</page><page sequence="6">460 AMERICAN JO.URNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XIX, 1915 BABYLONIA, ASSYRIA, AND PERSIA Striking Phenomena of Sumerian.-In J.A.O.S. XXXIV, 1914, pp. 321-328, J. D. PRINCE calls attention to the fact that one of the most striking charac- teristics of the Sumerian syllabary is the existence of a great number of words, apparently identical in sound, yet differing widely in signification. The follow- ing six principles must be understood in order to untangle the Sumerian syl- labary. 1. Roots are often shortened from longer roots, as du, worn down from dul, dug, tug. 2. There was occasionally a distinction by means of tones as in Chinese. 3. There must also have been vowel shading as du, di du 'go' and its probable derivatives: du 'push; spread bricks' and 'raise' ('move'). This may well have been a simultaneous phenomenon with tone variation. 4. Often there may have been no distinction in sound at all, as in the similar sounding words in English. 5. Paronomasia, based on erroneous association of signs, played a great part. 6. Distinctions must have been made, as in Chinese, by means of combinations which fixed the meaning of the ambiguous syllable. Chinese and Sumerian.-Under the title Chinese and Sumerian, C. J. BALL has published from the Oxford University Press, an elaborate volume on the common origin, which he believes to be demonstrable, of these two languages and systems of writing. In S. Bibl. Arch. XXXVI, 1914, pp. 269-273, XXXVII, 1915, pp. 24-33 (3 pis.), 50-59 (3 pls.), 75-86 (3 pls.), L. C. HoP- KINS criticizes the book from the point of view of a Chinese scholar object- ing that some of the Chinese signs chosen for comparison are not the earliest forms, and that the modern pronunciation can be no guide to the pronuncia- tion of 4000 B.c. when the Sumerian signs were in use. Two New Sumerian Vocabularies.-In R. Assyr. XI, 1914, pp. 119-129 (4 figs.), F. WEIDNER publishes two new Sumerian vocabularies with Assyrian translation. The first is in the possession of Pastor A. Jeremias of Leipzig and contains a list of insects. The second, in the possession of Professor F. E. Peiser of K6nigsberg, is a sort of commentary which gives a number of new meanings for the sign NI, ZAL. Religious Conceptions Underlying Sumerian Proper Names.--In J.A.O.S. XXXIV, 1914, pp. 315-320, G. A. BARTON gives a study based on names in the Haverford collection. These tablets, though but four hundred in number, contain so many pay-rolls that they are particularly rich in proper names. Nearly 3,300 individuals are mentioned in them. Among the Sumerians the most common way of showing devotion by means of a proper name was to call the boy or girl a "servant" of some deity. Thus 85 different men men- tioned in this collection bore the name Ur-Bau. Ur not only means "servant" but the "consecrated servant." Another form of name almost as popular was to call a boy the gal or gdlu, i.e., the "man" of such and such a god. Thus we have Gal-Bau as the name of 28 individuals in these texts. Sometimes, apparently, it was the intention of the parent to place the child under the pro- tection of any or every deity. In that case the infant was called Ur-dingirra, Gdl-dingirra, or Gim-dingirra, "servant of god," "man of god," or "maid-ser- vant of god." There are also many names which ascribe attributes of various kinds to the gods. Another series of names explains the attitude of the gods towards worshippers. Several names are formed on the analogy of the Biblical</page><page sequence="7">BABYLONIA, ETC.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1915 461 Micah, "who is like Yahu?" and Michael. Sometimes the name is a prayer. Sometimes a name expresses the intercession of one god with another. Some- times it expresses the aid which one god gives another. Another series of names indicates a tendency to fuse deities together. The deification of the Kings Dungi and Bur-Sin left its traces in the proper names of the period. Two Chronological Tablets of the Reign of Hammurabi.-In R. Assyr. XI, 1914, pp. 161-164, A. BOISSrER publishes two new tablets containing the Sumerian names of the years of the reign of Hammurabi. These supplement the lists previously published by Scheil and King. Foundation-Inscriptions from the Royal Palace at Erech.-In S. Bibl. Arch. XXXVII, 1915, pp. 22-23 (pl.), L. W. KING describes two clay tablets found at Warka, the ancient Erech, probably during the extensive native dig- ging which followed the German expedition under Dr. J. Jordan. Both the inscriptions relate to the same event, the building of his royal palace by Sin- gashid, king of Erech, the longer text giving the additional information that the work was undertaken after the rebuilding of E-anna, the great temple of Ishtar at Erech, had been completed. Fresh Light on the History of Esarhaddon.--In S. Bibl. Arch. XXXVII, 1915, pp. 47--49, C. H. W. JOHNs discusses two new prisms of Esarhaddon recently discovered at Susa. The explorations carried on by the French at Susa, under the direction of J. de Morgan, have not only made known to us endless monuments of the ancient monarchs of Elam, but added invaluable sources of history for Babylonia. To them we owe the celebrated Code of Hammurabi; and recently several fragments of two prisms of Esarhaddon have come to light. They have been published with the utmost skill and care by V. Scheil, in Tome XIV of the Mdmoires de la dNligation en Perse. The same scholar has since obtained accurate copies of another prism, which he calls "S," of Esarhaddon. This is a duplicate, so far as we can judge from the fragments known, of the same text as that given by the first of the Susa prisms, and of the broken prism in the British Museum. The latter had hitherto been the only Assyrian authority for the events which immediately followed on the murder of Sennacherib. The Wife of Ashurbanipal.-In Or. Lit. XVIII, 1915, cols. 37-38, B. MEISS- NER states that a relief was discovered in the city of Asshur depicting the queen of Ashurbanipal, who bears a close resemblance to the queen in the famous "garden relief." The name on this relief is broken, but begins with the ideo- gram for the city of Asshur. This name can be restored from a letter in the Harper collection written to Asshur-sharrat, mistress of the house of the crown-prince Ashurbanipal. The Daughter of Nabonidus.--In R. Assyr. XI, 1914, pp. 105-117, P. DHORME publishes a new inscription that mentions the daughter of Nabonidus. From this it appears that she was consecrated to the service of the temple of the god Sin at Ur. Nabonidus, himself, was the son of a priestess of the god Sin at Harran. The Temple of Marduk at Babylon.--In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1914, pp. 437-444 (plan), M. DIEULAFOY discusses the reports of the excavations on the acropolis at Babylon published by Koldewey, and compares the results attained with the data in regard to the temple of B61 Marduk found on the tablet of Anu B61lchunu.</page><page sequence="8">462 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIX, 1915 The Assumption of Ishtar.-In R. Assyr. XI, 1914, pp. 141-158, F. THUREAU- DANGIN publishes a newtablet acquired bythe Louvre which describes how the goddess Ishtar aspires to be queen of Heaven. The other gods and heavenly courtesans favor her desire and Anu consents. Accordingly "Ishtar with Anu, the king, occupies a brilliant dwelling and is exalted to be queen of heaven." The Malediction in Cuneiform Inscriptions.-In J.A.O.S. XXXIV, 1914, pp. 282-309, S. A. B. MERCER gives a history of the use of the curse in cuneiform literature from the earliest times down to the Persian period. The maledic- tion as found in cuneiform inscriptions seems to have been employed as a means of praying down evil upon a person. There were two main classes, direct and conditional. A direct malediction was pronounced after the forbidden deed had been done. A conditional malediction is one which is invoked and will take effect if the forbidden deed be done. The most frequent source or cause of maledictions is found in the endeavor of kings to have their name and fame well preserved throughout the ages, and whoever failed to do whatever was calculated to bring that about was made the object of a malediction. Whoever seized the property of another, and tried to claim ownership; or whoever dis- turbed the grave of a king; or removed a boundary-stone was cursed. A male- diction may come upon a man not only because of his own sins, but also because of those of his parents. In short, the smallest offence could cause a malediction, e.g. offence against the protective god of the family; against honor, the city, etc. A Babylonian Tablet with Aramaean Docket.-In R. Assyr. XI, 1914, pp. 183-187 (fig.), V. SCHEIL publishes a contract-tablet from Erech containing a contract dating from the second year of Cyrus. Around the edge is an Aramaic docket giving a summary of its contents. Nurses in Ancient Babylonia.-In R. Assyr. XI, 1914, pp. 175-182, V. SCHEIL shows how the provisions of the Code of Hammurabi, section 194, con- cerning nurses who have charge of infants are illustrated by allusions in the contract and juridical literature. The Origin of the Semitic Name for Iron.-In Or. Lit. XVIII, 1915, cols. 6-7, F. E. PEISER shows that in Assyrian and the other Semitic languages the name for iron is parzillu. In the Hittite group of languages the ending illu seems to form adjectives, and to be equivalent to the English ending ish or like. Parz- illu, accordingly, would mean the Parz-ish metal. Parz would seem to be connected with the geographical name Parzuas or even with Parsu, "Persia." The Assyrian texts speak of Kizwadna as the land from which iron came. This is to be identified with Pontos on the shore of the Black Sea. The Hittite Name for Silver.-In Or. Lit. XVIII, 1915, cols. 5-6, O. SCHROE- DER shows that the name of the Hittite kingdom which commonly is written phonetically Ha-at-ti is occasionally written ideographically AZAG-UD-ti, which is the sign for "silver" with phonetic complement, and from this he infers that the name for silver in the Hittite language was hat. Ibid. cols. 78-79, G. M6LLER shows that in old Egyptian hd and in late Egyptian Ad (h.t) is the word for silver. From this he infers that the Hittite word for silver is borrowed from the Egyptian. Ibid. cols. 79-80, O. SCHROEDER replies that gold is always the specific Egyptian metal in the Amarna letters, and that the word for silver in Egyptian was probably borrowed from the Hittites. Gobryas and Xenophon's Cyropaedia.-In R. Assyr. XI, 1914, pp. 165-174, V. SCHEIL gathers up the cuneiform evidence concerning Gobryas and publishes</page><page sequence="9">SYRIA] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1915 463 a new letter in which he is mentioned. He comes to the conclusion that the modern distrust of Xenophon's statement in regard to Gobryas is not justi- fied. From the Babylonian texts it appears that Gobryas was a Babylonian chief of advanced age, experienced in war, governor of a province of Babylonia, that he surrendered to Cyrus without conflict together with the other Baby- lonians, that by his prestige and his knowledge of men and affairs he facilitated for Cyrus the conquest of Babylonia, and that he was the first to enter Babylon. Persian Domes.--In Burl. Mag. XXVI, 1915, pp. 146-155; 208-213 (2 pls.; 15 figs.), K. A. C. CRESWELL traces the history and evolution of the dome in Persia. Domes are built by the most primitive peoples as a result of the lack of timber. They were older than the pyramids in Egypt and appeared very early in the East also, as is shown by a bas-relief representing domed peasants' huts found by Layard in the palace of Sennacherib at Nineveh (705-681 B.C.). In the West the dome was used in baths long before our era. All these early examples, however, are small and confined to buildings or parts of buildings of a secondary importance. The dome was either set over a circular space or else supported over a square space by a makeshift corner construction which could not be trusted on a large scale. Even in later highly developed buildings, like the Pantheon, Roman architects consistently kept to the cir- cular plan for large domed buildings, though sometimes making them octagonal externally. The thing needed to make the dome practicable for important complex buildings was some method of fitting it over large square spaces, for round rooms, while admirable singly, would not combine in groups. The Persians, who met this need, played, therefore, a vital part in the evolution of dome architecture. In the palace of Firuzabad we have the earliest example, presumably, of the Persian solution of the problem. By means of the squinch, consisting here of a series of concentric arches thrown across the angle, the square is reduced to an octagon upon which it is easy to set the large dome, 45 feet in diameter. This palace is late Achaemenian, after 340 .c., or early Sassanian, before 240 A.D.; it is hard to determine its date within much nar- rower limits. A later example is the palace at Sarvistan, dating 300-380 A.D. The development of the dome in Persia from the advent of Islam to the fifteenth century was toward a pointed shape of the maximum strength corre- sponding to the scientific results of the integral and differential calculus as applied to the problem of the mathematical theory of domes. This correct shape was only reached by experiment and not by calculation, since Newton did not invent the calculus, without which the problem is insoluble, until 1665; but many of the proportions, especially of the decoration, were undoubt- edly worked out on a mathematical basis. SYRIA AND PALESTINE A Moabite Seal.-In Pal. Ex. Fund, XLVII, 1915, p. 42, E. J. PILCHER describes a signet recently discovered at Kerak in Moab. The material is hematite; the face is convex; and a hole is drilled from end to end of the stone. Although this object was found in Moab, it is in the usual style of Jewish seals, and the lettering is of the Old Hebrew type. The inscription reads: "of Nazarel, the goldsmith." The Divine Names Ya-u and Yahu.-In Z. Alttest. Wiss. XXXV, 1915, pp. 8</page><page sequence="10">464 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XIX, 1915 45-52, E. K6NIG discusses the relation between the Old Babylonian divine name Ya-u and Yahweh of the Old Testament. He maintains that the original meaning of Ya-u in Babylonian was "someone," and that it was an indefinite designation of deity that was widely used in Western Asia. The original Hebrew form Yahweh was shortened in proper names into Yahu, and in the period of the later monarchy this abbreviation began to be used as an inde- pendent divine name. This, accordingly, has nothing to do with the old Babylonian Ya-u. The Inscriptions of Carchemish.--In S. Bibl. Arch. XXXVII, 1915, pp. 8-21, A. H. SAYCE discusses the principal inscriptions recently discovered at Carchemish and published by the Trustees of the British Museum. This publication is a very important accession to the progress of Hittite decipher- ment. For the first time we have a number of inscriptions which are complete and legible throughout; they were, moreover, executed under royal orders by skilled artisans, and the forms of the characters are therefore delineated with care and accuracy. They frequently enable us to restore the semi-legible or misformed characters of the inscriptions previously known to us, and thus to correct a number of errors due to the imperfection of our materials. As the inscriptions are not only numerous, but also belong to different periods, the variants occurring in them are frequent and helpful. At Carchemish, further- more, where the native population was Aramaic, the Moschian-Hittite scribes did all in their power to enable their hieroglyphic script to be easily read, and, accordingly, reduced the hieroglyphic element in it to a minimum. ASIA MINOR Caves in Asia Minor.-In Mitt. Vorderas. Ges. XIX, 1914, 2, pp. 1-96, E. BRANDENBURG gives the outline of a systematic account of caves and their architecture in Asia Minor and in countries influenced by Asia Minor (Greece, Etruria, etc.). Silver Coinage of Smyrna.--In Num. Chron. 1914, pp. 273-298 (3 pls.), J. G. MILNE describes and arranges chronologically under the names of the magistrates "the main silver series struck at Smyrna-the tetradrachms and drachms of Attic weight issued during the second and first centuries n.c." The basis for the study is the comparison of dies, and sometimes also of the bronze coinage, which is itself, however, with the other issues of silver and the solitary issue of gold, reserved for another article. This paper furnishes a valuable example of method. An interesting item is the exceptional strength of one obverse die, which is found in conjunction with twelve reverse dies. (See Num. Chron. 1910, p. 338, for similar statistics of relative durability.) Hoard of Coins of Cnidos.-The hoard found at Dadia in the Cnidian Chersonese, mentioned by J. G. MILNE in Num. Chron. 1911, p. 197, of which some coins were also published by Dr. Imhoof-Blumer in Num. Z. XLV, 1912, pp. 193 ff., has been irrecoverably dispersed. But some more coins of the same provenance are described in a supplementary note by Mr. MILNE in Num. Chron. 1914, pp. 379-381. Coinage of Pisidian Antioch.-A selection of the coins of Pisidian Antioch of the imperial period is described by G. F. HILL in Num. Chron. 1914, pp. 299-313 (pl.). By the examination of other coins found associated with those</page><page sequence="11">GREEK ARCH.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1915 465 described "provenance is shown, as always in the case of bronze coins, to be good evidence for attribution." GREECE ARCHITECTURE A Plan of the Palace of Phaestus.--In Ann. Scuol. It. I, 1914, pp. 357- 364 (plan), L. PERNIER presents a new plan of the palace at Phaestus which is more complete than any hitherto published. The dates of the different walls are indicated by the shading as being earlier than the first palace, contem- poraneous with the first palace, contemporaneous with the second palace, and of later construction. A discussion accompanies the plan. Prehistoric Bridge of Eleutherne.--In 'Apr. 'E4. 1914, pp. 230-232 (7 figs.), E. N. PETROULAKIS publishes photographs and drawings of a unique prehis- toric bridge at Eleutherne, Crete. It has a triangular corbel arch of the Mycenaean type, which was repaired and strengthened under his direction. It was described, with a drawing, by Spratt, Travels and Researches in Crete, Vol. II, pp. 94 f. The Interior Column-Capitals of the Temple at Bassae.--In 'ApX. 'E?. 1914, pp. 57-70 (12 figs.), K. A. RHOMAIOS discusses the forms and arrange- ment of the interior column-capitals of the temple of Apollo at Bassae. Re- cently discovered fragments of the Corinthian capital and of the Ionic capitals corroborate in general the accuracy of the descriptions and drawings of Stackel- berg, Donaldson, Blouet, and especially of Cockerell. Haller's journal, used by Cockerell, is also put in evidence. All this testimony, combined with the dimensions of the top courses of the engaged columns, shows that the Ionic capitals had abaci of the same width and thickness as those of the Corinthian capital, and in general had unusual proportions, e.g., less breadth and greater height, especially designed to harmonize with it. To the same end the corner capitals had anthemia between their volutes, and their abaci were 0.025 m. thicker than the others. The sides of these corner capitals, being more exposed to view, were exactly like the front face, while those of the others reproduced but half of the front face, i.e., one volute and a half echinus. An Ionic capital of limestone, fragments of which have been found on the site, was evidently made to replace a damaged marble capital. Its design, differing in many details from that of the original capitals, testifies to an artist's independent attempt to solve the problem of harmony. Mr. Rhomaios' study shows that Durm and others have erred in calling peculiarities of this temple "irregulari- ties" or "infelicities," or in suspecting inaccuracies in the reports of earlier investigators. The Greek architect, here as elsewhere, was creating an or- ganic whole the parts of which could not be made from any set of stock patterns. The Entablature of the Temple of Athena at Priene.-In Ath. Mitt. XXXIX, 1914, pp. 72-82 (1 Beilage; 5 figs.), W. WILBERG proves that the accepted restoration of the temple of Athena at Priene without a frieze is erroneous. If the cornice were placed directly on the architrave the blocks of the coffered ceiling would reach so high as to conflict with the rafters. By the introduction of a frieze this difficulty is overcome. A comparison of drawings of the fagade with and without a frieze shows that the former arrangement is aesthetically more satisfactory.</page><page sequence="12">466 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIX, 1915 The Archaic Temples of Prinias.-In Ann. Scuol. It. I, 1914, pp. 18-111 (3 pls.; 64 figs.), L. PERNIER discusses the archaic temples on the plateau at Prinias, Crete, excavated in 1907 and subsequent years. There were two temples side by side. Temple A consisted of a chamber with pronaos, the exact depth of which is uncertain; Temple B, which lay to the south and had a slightly different orientation, had a pronaos, cella and opisthodomos. It was also built on a level 0.45 m. higher. The relative dates of the two build- ings has not been determined. Beneath Temple A are some pieces of wall dating from the end of the Minoan period. The most important sculptures were a series of slabs representing mounted warriors (see A.J.A. XIII, 1909, p. 504, Fig. 5), five of which are preserved at least in part. The men are very diminutive in size as compared with the horses. The height of the frieze is 0.84 m. Parts of two archaic female figures seated on thrones above a relief representing panthers and deer were also found (see A.J.A. XIII, p. 505, Fig. 6). These figures were probably placed at the top of the doorway leading into Temple A; while the relief of the horsemen probably ran across the front of the temple above the pronaos. The most important of the objects of terra- cotta unearthed was a large "proto-Hellenic" pithos with decoration in relief. On the neck, twice repeated, a goodess with recurved wings is holding with either hand a horse by the fore-leg. Below are various bands of spirals, zig- zags, etc., and in one band a chariot race. Some fragments of painted vases date from the latest Minoan times. The Metopes from Thermus.-The metopes from Thermus are discussed by H. Kocii in Ath. Mitt. XXXIX, 1914, pp. 237-255 (3 pls.; 11 figs.). He divides the terra-cottas which decorated the roof of the temple of Apollo into two series. The later series is to be dated about 540/530 B.c. The metopes, which are distinctly earlier, are to be brought into connection with the first series of roof terra-cottas, with which they correspond technically and sty- listically, and are to be assigned to the latter part of the seventh century. Whether the later series of terra-cottas replaced the earlier on the same build- ing, or belong to a second building, is uncertain. SCULPTURE Two Mycenaean Fragments.-Two carved fragments discovered at My- cenae and now in the National Museum at Athens are published by G. KIAo, Ath. Mith. XXXIX, 1914, p. 256 (4 figs.). One is the left hind leg from a stat- uette of a bull in dark green steatite; the other a female head in profile of lapis lazuli, and probably intended to be set in gold. The former is the first piece of Minoan sculpture in the round in stone to be found; the latter is in the style of the Cretan stone reliefs and frescoes of the best period (sixteenth to fifteenth century B.C.) and unequalled in delicacy of execution. An Unknown Group of Statues from Sicyon.-In J. Int. Arch. Num. XVI, 1914, pp. 71-80 (3 figs.), I. N. SVoRoNos publishes a bronze coin of Sicyon recently acquired by the National Museum at Athens. On the obverse is the head of Julia Domna, and on the reverse a group of three statues. In the middle is Hermes bearing a ram on his shoulders; at the right is a fully draped female figure carrying a flat basket; and at the left another draped female figure. The writer identifies the group as Hermes, Opora or Carpo, and Chtho-</page><page sequence="13">GREEK SCULPTURE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1915 467 nophyle. The last named was a local nymph, daughter of Sicyon and mother of Polybus. Nothing is known of this group; but the Hermes is to be identi- fied with the Hermes Criophoros of Wilton House, a type which differs from the Hermes Criophoros of Onatas and that of Calamis. A Discus-Thrower on a Greek Scarab.-In 'Apx. 'Ek. 1914, pp. 241-244 (fig.), D. EVANGELIDES publishes a fine intaglio representing a discus-thrower, cut on the under side of a scarab of sardonyx(?). It is said to have come from Apollonia in Northern Epirus. The attitude of the figure is much like that of a discus-thrower on coins of Cos of about 479 B.C., representing a momentary pose just preceding that chosen by Myron for his Discobolus. Though some- what archaic, it is of high artistic merit in its harmonious composition, vigor- ous action, and skilfully rendered detail. It may, perhaps, be a copy of a mas- terpiece by Pythagoras, whose rival Myron then produced his famous Dis- cobolus to prove his superiority. The West Pediment Sculptures of the Parthenon.-As a supplement and critique of the recent works by Smith and Collignon on the Parthenon sculptures, W. R. LETHABY (Burl. Mag. XXVII, 1915, pp. 14-21 and 66-72; 9 figs.) discusses the west pediment of the Parthenon. The close resemblance between the Athena of this gable and the Athena type which Furtwingler identified as the Lemnian favor Furtwingler's attribution of the latter to Phidias. The Athena and Poseidon in the middle of the gable must have been influenced in design by Myron's group of Athena and Marsyas. The two figures attending Athena's chariot can be identified as Hermes and Nike, Poseidon's retainers as Amphitrite and Iris. To the left, beyond the half- man half-serpent Cecrops and his daughters, the two figures in the angle were Cranaus and Amphictyon. To the right, beyond Erechtheus and his daugh- ters, including Creusa with her son Ion, were Cephalus and Procris. The time represented was dawn. The Holkham Head-A Reply.-In J. H. S. XXXIV, 1914, pp. 312-320 (2 figs.), C. WALDSTEIN makes a drastic criticism of the strictures of G. Dickins on his earlier article identifying a colossal head at Holkham Hall with the Aphrodite of the east pediment of the Parthenon (see ibid. 1913, pp. 276 ff.; 1914, pp. 122 ff.). Particularly the colossal mask at Turin which Dickins sug- gests for comparison is shown to present the utmost possible contrast, with its post-Scopadian, even late Roman, exaggerated sensationalism, against the calm, regular-featured, somewhat cold fifth-century type of the Aphrodite. The Sorrento Base.--In J. Int. Arch. Num. XVI, 1914, pp. 153-210 (2 pls.; fig.), I. N. SVORONOS argues that the "Sorrento base," of which two pieces are preserved in the museum at Sorrento, was a copy dating from the first century B.C. of the base of the statue of Demeter Agelastos of Praxiteles at Megara. He interprets the reliefs on the four sides thus: A. Demeter seated on the Agelastos Petra while Hecate and two of the daughters of Celeus stand before her; B. Rhea in the presence of Demeter and Persephone at Eleusis; C. the Anthesteria before the temple of Demeter at Eleusis; D. Demeter, seated on a throne with Persephone and Iambe standing on either side, re- ceives five women, i. e., Metaneira and her four daughters. A Draped Statue from Epidaurus.--In R. Arch., fifth series, I, 1915, pp. 40-46 (3 figs.), M. COLLIGNON publishes a well preserved statue of a youth in</page><page sequence="14">468 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XIX, 1915 the possession of Mr. Yanakopoulos at Athens. It is said to be from Epidaurus. The type is that of the Aeschines in the museum at Naples, but the head is that of a youth. The hair is cut nearly straight across the forehead, in the style introduced in the Augustan period. The head recalls Argive types of the fifth century B.c. Probably the statue was honorary. The date is proba- bly the end of the first century or the second century A.D. The continuance of classical traditions is an interesting feature of Graeco-Roman art. Reliefs from Tegea.-In Ath. Mitt. XXXIX, 1914, pp. 189-235 (2 pls.; 9 figs.), K. A. RHOMAIOS publishes a series of reliefs from Tegea representing banquet scenes, and discusses at length the problems raised by the whole class of banquet reliefs. The Tegean examples seem to be votive reliefs to heroes or heroized dead, not grave monuments, and the term "funerary banquet" does not apply. The same is true of numerous reliefs in which the banqueters are characterized by symbols (snake, horse's head, dog) as divinities or heroes. Gods and protecting spirits are often represented on grave reliefs with or with- out the deceased, but representations of heroized dead are comparatively rare. The archaic Spartan reliefs are votive, not funerary. A Votive Relief to Asclepius.-In 'ApX. 'E4. 1914, pp. 136-138 (fig.), P. KASTRIOTES publishes a fragmentary votive relief to Asclepius, found by him in excavations on the southeast slope of the Acropolis. A woman, kneeling by the bedside of a patient, touches in supplication the robe of Asclepius. Such scenes of kneeling in prayer are very rare in Greek art. The Greeks regularly stood to pray, as they do even to the present day, regarding kneeling as servile or womanish. Men never knelt, women rarely. The Laocoon Group.-In Jb. Kl. Alt. XXXIII, 1914, pp. 686-697 (2 pls.; fig.), R. FOERSTER disputes some of the conclusions of Klein (Geschichte der griech. Kunst, III, pp. 311 ff.) in regard to the Laocoon group. Neither the Pompeian wall-painting nor the description in Virgil have anything to do with the famous group from Rhodes. Filippino Lippi's drawing is based upon Virgil. Laocoon appears in art as early as the fifth century, as an Etrus- can gem in the British Museum proves; but the Apulian vase fragment pub- lished in Mon. Ant. IX, pl. 15, where the serpents are seen devouring the sons, illustrates a version of the story attributed to Lesches by Apollodorus (V, 17), and has nothing to do with the Rhodian group. Foerster believes that the Laocoon of the Vatican dates from about 50 B.c., that it was brought to Rome by Titus who was in Rhodes in 69 A.D., and that some time after the death of Titus it was put in the underground chamber where it remained until its dis- covery in 1506. A Relief from Hypata.-In 'Apx. 'E4. 1914, pp. 89-90 (fig.), N. I. GIAN- NOPOULos publishes a rough low relief from Hypata, Aeniania, representing the back view of a marching soldier who is shouldering his javelin. The figure resembles closely the reverse of coins of Aeniania dated about 150 B.c. Hermes with the Lotus Leaf.-In REim. Mitt. XXIX, 1914, pp. 168-185, R. FOERSTER discusses a series of statuettes of Hellenistic type representing Hermes with a head ornament which he identifies as a lotus leaf. The god, therefore, is depicted as the giver of wealth, the lotus being the symbol of the Nile, whose rise was the cause of Egyptian prosperity. Furtwangler had thought the ornament the pen of Thoth, which would represent Hermes as the god of learning.</page><page sequence="15">GREEK VASES] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1915 469 Alexander Helios.-In R. Arch. XXIV, 1914, pp. 94-101 (3 figs.), GUSTAVE BLUM publishes a head of Alexander-Helios in Bologna and discusses similar heads, portraits of Alexander, and figures of Helios and a related divinity who appears in Mithraic monuments. The Azara head is asserted to be the most faithful portrait of Alexander. The "colossus of Rhodes," by Chares (or Chareas), probably had features resembling those of Alexander. The "Capito- line Alexander" may be derived from it. A Bronze Statuette of Athena Nike.-In R. Arch., fifth series, I, 1915, pp. 20-25 (fig.), B. FILOW publishes a new photograph of a bronze statuette from Kirilovo and maintains his opinion that it represents Athena Nike, not (as G. Seure, R. Et. Gr. XXV, 1912, pp. 24-39; R. Arch. 1913, i, pp. 45 ff. has declared), an armed Artemis. The probable date of the bronze is the third century A.D. VASES AND PAINTING The Master of the Achilles Amphora in the Vatican.-Another nameless Attic vase painter has been reconstructed with infinite patience by J. D. BEAZLEY (J.H.S. XXXIV, 1914, pp. 179-226; 4 pls.; 45 figs.) out of the minute details of figures, draperies and patterns on a large number of red-figured vases of the early free period. The two finest are an amphora in the Vatican with a standing figure of Achilles [AXIAAEV4] and a neck-amphora with twisted handles in the Cabinet des Mddailles at Paris, which shows Euphorbus carrying the infant Oedipus [EVOPBOM, OIA I OAA4]. The others in- clude some rare shapes, as a pointed amphora, and a few large vases (stamnus, amphoras), but the greater number are lecythi, both red-figured and with white-ground, "Nolan" amphoras, and other small vases. The designs, which are chiefly of quiet subjects with no fighting, most frequently consist of single figures and rarely more than three figures are shown together. Of the large number of vases which display his distinct style, some are undoubt- edly the work of pupils or imitators, but all are from the workshop or the school of a single master. An Attic Cylix Signed by Anacles.--In R. Arch., fifth series, I, 1915, pp. 4-12 (6 figs.), MORIN-JEAN publishes and discusses a cylix signed 'AVdKXE; hroleoty in the collection of M. Farochon (Morin-Jean, Le dessin des animaux en Grkce d'aprBs les vases peints, p. 171, figs. 195, 196; Perrot and Chipiez, Hist. de l'art, X, p. 235, fig. 152), which has been cleansed and re- stored. The form, with high foot and deep bowl, is characteristic of Anacles and some of the other "little masters." The colors used are black, the orange yellow of the clay, and a violet red. The figured decoration consists of two animals of the deer species, very delicately drawn. Under the handles are palmette scrolls. Only one other vase certainly signed by Anacles is known, and that one (in Berlin; Bull. dell' Instituto, 1879, p. 4; Wiener Vorlegebldtter, 1889, pl. VII, No. 3) may be signed by him as a painter working for Nicosthenes (Pottier, Catalogue, p. 701). The vase of M. Farochon is, therefore, the only sure testimony to Anacles as an independent potter. A Boeotian Relief Bowl.--In 'Apx. 'Eq. 1914, pp. 50-57 (pl.; 6 figs.), F. VERSAKES publishes a "Boeotian" bowl of terra-cotta (Athens, National Museum, No. 11,797) with a band of reliefs representing four milling scenes,</page><page sequence="16">470 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIX, 1915 and one labelled Kiva&amp;8o0. The grain is being ground at a "power-mill" by an ass and at two simpler hand mills by women, and is being sifted by a woman with a hand sieve. The Kzva&amp;8o0 scene, perhaps, represents the execution of two reprobate vaudeville actors, or possibly a burlesque, by such actors, of such an execution. The bowl dates from the early years of the Roman empire. Cleagoras of Phlius.-Cleagoras of Phlius, a painter of the fifth century, is rescued from oblivion by W. LEONHARD in Ath. Mitt. XXXIX, 1914, pp. 144- 147. He is referred to by Xenophon, Anabasis VII, 8, 1, as follows: 'Evre 0e &amp;kwXrevuav ets Ad~aKOv, KaL h7raVTr TO4 !

Megalographia.-In Rom. Mitt. XXIX, 1914, pp. 194-199, G. RODEN- WALDT defines megalographia (Vitruvius, VII, 5) as the depicting of noble subjects. Such paintings were usually also of greater size than those with a less noble theme. INSCRIPTIONS The Building Accounts of the Parthenon.-In 'ApX. 'E4. 1914, pp. 197-206 and p. 272 (3 figs.), A. D. KERAMOPOULLOS supplements the article of Dins- moor, A.J.A. XVII, 1913, pp. 53-80, by a description of four new fragments of the text of the inscription, discovered by himself and others, viz. R, RR, S, and T, and publishes a revised text of the parts affected. R and S join, continu- ing the lines of the front face of F. T joins the left edge of I, containing parts of lines 96-99. RR, on the back of fragment R, joins C and Q, nearly filling the gap between them and the back face of F. Dinsmoor's line 57 of the second column of the reverse side of the stele should be numbered 45; his line 34 of the first column of the front side should be numbered 37. Upon R, which seems to belong to the third year of the building (445/4), the clerk and some of the epistatai seem to be identical with those of another building account, I.G. 296. It seems probable that there was a central controlling board for regulating the disbursements for all state buildings at this time, and that later, with the increase in building activities, separate committees were ap- pointed for specific pieces of work. A fund of at least 200,000 drachmae, on hand as early as the third year and still intact in the eighth, but spent by the fourteenth, was probably a big loan negotiated at the start to ensure the com- pletion of the building in case other sources of revenue failed. A List of Athenian Magistrates.-A list of Athenian magistrates in 14-13 B.c. inscribed on a stele in the museum at Athens is published by D. FIMMEN, Ath. Mitt. XXXIX, 1914, pp. 130-137 (fig.). He cites eleven similar inscrip- tions, each on a separate stele, and concludes that it was the custom to set up such slabs in chronological order on the Acropolis. The Granting of Athenian Citizenship.-In Ath. Mitt. XXXIX, 1914, pp. 257-315 (7 figs.), A. WILHELM publishes a detailed commentary on a long series of decrees of the late fourth and the third centuries recording the bestowal of citizenship on foreigners. The Words for Tomb in Archaic Inscriptions.-The words a a and ijva, explained as synonyms by the lexicographers, are used with different mean-</page><page sequence="17">GREEK INSCRIPTIONS] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1915 471 ings in archaic inscriptions. The former is the sign or mark by which the tomb is recognized. In Homer, and occasionally in the Anthology, it is used of the burial mound, and in most cases includes the monument erected on the mound, though occasionally it refers only to the latter. Mv pa is always used with reference to the person buried in the tomb, and designates his monument or memorial; it is not used of the grave as such. Later the distinc- tion disappeared. (F. EICHLER, Ath. Mitt. XXXIX, 1914, pp. 138-143.) Corrections.--Corrections of minutiae in the published tests and commen- taries of a number of Greek inscriptions are presented by A. WILHELM in Ath. Mitt. XXXIX, 1914, pp. 177-188. TH. SAUCIuc, ibid. p. 236, announces that the first line of the inscription published by him, ibid. XXXVIII, 1913, p. 285, is to be restored Xa]jr[c8a. The epigram refers to the victory of an ephebus in a torch race. An Inscription from Aegina.-In 'Apx. 'E4. 1914, pp. 92-94 (2 figs.), P. N. HEREIOTES argues that the rough, bar-shaped stone inscribed M KlVE 7r~86 (I. G. IV, 176) was a weight for a well-sweep, the groove in the centre having been made for the noose of rope on which the stone was hung. A Mantinean Inscription.-In Ann. Scuol. It. I, 1914, pp. 1-17 (3 pls.), D. COMPARETrI presents a new study of the early inscription from Mantinea first published by Foug~res in B.C.H. XVI, 1892, pp. 568 ff. It has to do with a judgment against persons guilty of sacrilege towards Athena Alea. Inscriptions of Hypata.,-In 'APX. 'E4. 1914, p. 88 (fig.), N. I. GIANNOPOULOS publishes two inscriptions of Hypata in Aeniania, one of which is a fragment of a decree, of the third century B.c., apparently a treaty between the Hypa- taeans (or Aenianes) and the Pharsalians. Ibid. 1914, p. 89, the same writer publishes supplementary readings and notes on I.G. IX2, 29, 36, and 45. The Temple Chronicle of Lindus.-Messrs. Marcus and Weber have pub- lished as No. 131 in their series of Kleine Texte a revised edition by CHR. BLINKENBERG of the great inscription of the temple of Athena found at Lindus in 1904 and first published by him in 1912 in the Bulletin of the Royal Academy of Denmark. A new study of the stone has made it possible to correct and supplement the reading in several places, although there are still gaps. A brief commentary accompanies the text. The inscription was written in 99 B.c. In mediaeval times the stone was used in a pavement. [Die Lindische Tempelchronik, neu bearbeitet von CHR. BLINKENBERG. Bonn, 1915, A. Marcus und E.

Inscriptions of Rhodes, Thera, Naxos, and Arcadia.-In 'Apx. 'E4. 1914, pp. 130-135 (2 figs.), F. HILLER publishes several new inscriptions, and notes and corrections on a few already published.

DIAMANTARAS publishes a dedicatory inscription, found at Nisyros, in honor of Caesar Bri- tannicus. As it is dedicated by the 'Io-OcLoraL, it is likely that it was originally set up at the Isthmus of Cnidos. The Molpoi Inscription.-In Eranos, XIV, 1914, pp. 1-20, O. A. DANIELSSON discusses certain readings of the Molpoi inscription from Miletus. An Inscribed Silver Plate from Aidone.-In Ann. Scuol. It. I, 1914, pp. 113-118 (pl.; fig.) D. COMPARETTI discusses an inscribed silver plate found near Aidone in Sicily. It is a mortgage in the form of a sale subject to redemption (2rpats &amp;rr ,i~io), and was probably preserved in some private building. It is in Greek and dates from the first century B.C. A Christian Inscription from Cyrene.-In Ann. Scuol. It. I, 1914, pp. 161-167 (3 figs.), D. COMPARETTI publishes a Christian inscription in red paint on the wall of a tomb at Cyrene. It was incorrectly copied by the artist Pacho and published in his Relation d'un voyage dans la Marmarique, la Cyrdnaique (Paris, 1827-29), and reproduced in C.I.G. IV, No. 9136. It concerns several people who were killed in an earthquake, and buried in this tomb. It probably dates from the last decade of the fourth century when Cyrenaica is known to have been devastated by a terrible earthquake. Recent Work in Greek Epigraphy.-The annual review by M. N. TOD of the progress of Greek epigraphy in the year 1913-1914, which is crowded out of the 'Year's Work in Classical Studies' by pressure of material, finds a place in J.H.S. XXXIV, 1914, pp. 321-331. Under the headings General, Attica, Peloponnesus, Central and Northern Greece, Islands of the Aegean, Asia Minor, Outlying Regions (Sicily, Sardinia, Italy, Thrace, Macedonia, Russia, Syria, Egypt, Cyrenaica), he records with brief comments 168 books, articles, and new editions, dealing with Greek inscriptions both technically and in their applica- tion to larger interests. Of especial importance are the following: a new edition of Larfeld's Griechische Epigraphilk; various articles on the origin of the classical alphabets; the beginning of a smaller reissue of I.G. II and III (Attic</page><page sequence="19">GREEK COINS] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1915 473 inscriptions after 403); a volume of Delphian inscriptions by G. Colin; the fourth section of the inscriptions of Delos, edited by P. Roussel; various arti- cles on new inscriptions from Ionia, and a volume on the Delphinium at Miletus by G. Kawerau and A. Rehm; and a volume on Scythians and Greeks by E. H. Minns. A Bulletin of Greek Epigraphy.--In R. Rt. Gr. XXVII, 1914, pp. 441-477, P. ROUSSEL gives a summary of the Greek inscriptions from all parts of the ancient Greek world published during the last few years. COINS Epigraphical Notes on Athenian Coinage.-On several points connected with Athenian public money matters suggested by Professor Percy Gardner's article on the 'Coinage of the Athenian Empire' (J.H.S. 1913, pp. 147 ff.) a fuller use of the evidence of inscriptions is enlightening. The treasure lists and the building inscriptions of the Parthenon with their records of payments, show the presence of foreign coins in circulation or hoarded in Athens and give some limits for their values in Attic drachmas. Thus it can be shown that electrum staters of Lampsacus were in Athens at least as early as 447 and that Cyzicene staters were used on several occasions between 418 and 414 to supple- ment Attic currency in payments to strategi, while the ratio of these coins to Attic drachmas as 24:1 is sustained, though not proved, by possible restora- tions. An Olbian inscription shows the multiplicity of coin standards in use in the fourth century, when the value of the staters of Cyzicus was fixed by law as 21 or,23 local silver drachmas, and other coins were left to the mercies of the market. An unpublished fragment of the records of the chryselephan- tine statue in the Parthenon mentions the purchase of some gold staters of Croesus at a surprisingly high price, apparently about three times their intrinsic value. The inference from certain inscriptions, of a second issue of gold coins at Athens in 393 B.c. is found to be untenable, and Gardner's sup- posed discovery that, contrary to the testimony of Thucydides, Melos was a part of the Athenian empire in 425 is also a misunderstanding, the record on which it is based being one of assessments, not of payments. A list of the entries of non-Attic coins in the Athenian treasure records of the first half of the fourth century includes Cyzicene gold staters, Phocaean gold staters and hectae, Persian gold darics and silver shekels, and some miscellaneous foreign silver. (A. M. WOODWARD, J.H.S. XXXIV, 1914, pp. 276-292.) Some Hellenistic Portraits.--In a study of some Hellenistic portraits on coins and in sculpture of the first four Ptolemies, of Philetaerus, Attalus I, and Euergetes II of Pergamon, Antiochus II of Syria, Agathocles of Bactria, and Thucydides and Aristotle, G. DICKINS makes some new attributions and suggests the principles on which such portraits should be studied. Heads on coins made for the home city of a prince were less likely to be accurate portraits than those made for places where he was less well known; and in general the most individual features of a head were more likely to be accurately and hence uniformly reproduced, while considerable variation was allowed in the less marked traits. An interesting head of Thucydides at Corfu represents the disillusioned, returned exile, a man considerably older than the type known in the Naples herm and a head at Holkham Hall. A bronze bust from Herculan-</page><page sequence="20">474 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL.

GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Minoan Tombs and the Little Palace at Cnossus.-In Archaeologia, LXV, 1914, pp. 1-94 (7 pls.; 97 figs.), Sir ARTHUR EVANS describes a series of tombs found on the edge of the plateau overlooking the harbor of Cnossus in 1909. A deposit of stone vases and bronze weapons dating from the third Middle Minoan and first Late Minoan periods led to the discovery. In Tomb 1 there were found fragments of vases of the "Palace" style, a chalced- ony seal with figures of two men and a mastiff carved upon it, and a ring with a cult scene (see A.J.A. XVIII, p. 290). The ring was too small for an adult and the writer suggests that such rings were made for the dead and fitted to the fingers after the flesh had decayed. At a later date a secondary tomb (Tomb 1 A) was built, opening at right angles upon the dromos. In Tomb 3 were found the head of a mace of breccia, two gems, two knives, a razor, a bronze mirror, a paste gem, and some vases of Late Minoan III date. In Tomb 4, which is of the same date, that is the first half of the fourteenth cen- tury, there were found some vases and a gold ring. Tomb 5 (Tomb of the Polychrome Vases) was one of the largest yet found. Towards the middle was a stone bench with parts of a skeleton near it. In the tomb were a spiral silver ring, and some remarkable high, two-handled goblets with designs in red and blue. They preserve the Middle Minoan polychrome tradition, and were evidently made for the use of the dead. The tomb dates from the first Late Minoan period. Tomb 6, which dates from the period of Late Minoan III, contained among other things a gold ring with two figures grasping hands cut on the bezel, two rude clay figurines, a curious double vase, a bronze mirror, etc. Tomb 2 (Tomb of the Double Axes) was the most important excavated. From its rear wall there projects a buttress upon which is carved a half column slightly greater at the base than at the top. There is a bench on three sides of the room which Evans thinks was intended to represent a Minoan living room. The tomb resembles some Etruscan tombs in plan. At the right of the entrance was a cist 1.26 m. deep. Two gold beads, two gold-plated studs for a sword, two bronze knives, about twenty thin bronze arrow-heads, a car- nelian gem with the figure of a lion upon it, two flat beads and a disk of amber, and some fine painted vases of the "Palace" style were found in it. The vases show the influence of the painted stucco of the palace in their decoration. A broken ritual vase with high handles and a cover were found near the column; also some pieces of a bull's head rhyton, and two votive double axes. The tomb dates from the period of Late Minoan II. Dr. Evans also describes the building west of the palace at Cnossus to which he has given the name of "Little Palace." It seems to have been used largely for cult purposes. In the northwest corner was a shrine, the wooden columns of which had fifteen flutings in relief, as impressions on the later plaster blocking show. In some of the basement rooms the ceiling was supported by stone pillars as in the great palace. Square pits in the floor near the pillars in the southeastern room may have been used for libations, and the stone bases near</page><page sequence="21">GREEK MISC.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1915 475 by were probably for ritual purposes. Ritual vases were found in an adjoining room. The pillars also served as supports for the columns of the floor above. In the southwest angle of the building were found an inlaid bull's head rhyton of steatite, another of painted terra-cotta, two alabaster sockets and one of steatite, evidently ritual objects. In this vicinity a crude lead statuette of a woman in an attitude of adoration came to light. It dates from the third Late Mihoan period. A peculiar ritual vase has a high, recurved spout and decora- tion of papyrus stalks, etc., in relief. The bull's head rhyton of steatite was the most interesting single object found in the building. The horns were separate pieces and probably of wood covered with gold foil. The ears were also at- tached. One eye is preserved. The lens is of rock crystal with pupil and iris painted on the under surface. The pupil is scarlet, the iris black, and the rest of the cornea white. Sur- rounding this is a border of red stone. This eye gives a very life- like appearance to the head. Vases in the shape of a bull's head are known at Cnossus as early as the second Middle Minoan period. A Cyzicene School of Art.-The new influence, neither Attic nor Peloponnesian, which appeared in Greek art about the middle of the fifth century and which is most conspicuously characterized by clinging, transparent, and wind- blown draperies, is discussed at some length by B. SCHROEDER in Jb. Arch. I. XXIX, 1914, pp. 123- 168 (5 pls.; 29 figs.). This art as a whole is Ionian, and its peculiar- ities belong essentially in their origin to the technique of drawing on a large scale as for wall paint- ings. These compositions were copied by vase painters, and by sculptors, first in relief and then in the round in life-size marble and smaller bronze. The art can be traced back through all these channels to Micon, the foreign artist who painted battles with Amazons and Persians and perhaps other subjects in the Stoa Poikile and the Theseum at Athens, about 470-460 B.c. and was the teacher of Paeonius and Polygnotus. Geographical clues point to the district of Cyzicus as the centreof the influence and this view is confirmed by the especial feature'of the draperies. Real life would present such effects to the artist's eye only in a region swept by strong sea-winds, especially the north wind. Among the works standing in more or less close relation to this school are the following: a group of Attic red-figured Amazon vases dated about 460-450 B.c., of which the Penthesilea vase at Munich is the finest; some early Melian reliefs; the friezes and statues FIGURE 1.-TORSO OF POSEIDON FROM CYzIcus</page><page sequence="22">476 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIX, 1915 of the Nereid Monument at Xanthus in Lycia, before 450; the Nike of Paeonius at Olympia, before 423; the Ficorini cista and the Talos vase; coins of Cyzicus and of Mallus in Cilicia; the friezes at Phigalia and at Trysa; the Boreas acroterium at Delos; the sculptures of the Argive Heraeum, the Erechtheum, and the temple of Nike Apteros, including the balustrade; some metopes of Temple E at Selinus; the Tyrannicides at Naples; the Dexileos monument; the Venus Genetrix; the Ares Borghese; the Artemis Colonna; some small bronze statuettes at Berlin and Paris; a torso of Poseidon from Cyzicus, now in the British Museum (Fig. 1), and many other well-known works. Some of these are doubtless of the marble of Proconnesus, which would be used at Cyzicus. The Site of the Odeum of Pericles.-In 'Apx. 'E4~. 1914, pp. 23-25, G. MISTRIOTES lays emphasis on the evidence justifying his belief that Kastriotes' recent excavations on the east slope of the Acropolis have uncovered the site of the Odeum of Pericles (cf. ibid., pp., 141 and 143-166, A.J.A. XIX, p. 344). The Odeum at Gortyna.--In Ann. Scuol. It. I, 1914, pp. 373-376 (4 figs.), L. PERNIER gives a brief account of the excavation of the odeum at Gortyna, where the great inscription was found by Halbherr in 1884. The building was completely cleared in 1913. Greek Art in Soldiers' Graves.-Under the title Die Griechische Kunst an Kriegergrcibern (Leipzig, 1915, Teubner. 31 pp.; 24 pls.; 9 figs. M. 2), Professor FRANZ STUDNICZKA has reprinted as a monograph his article published in Jb. Kl. Alt. XXXV, pp. 285 ff. The grave monuments of warriors from Mycenaean times onward are collected and discussed. The writer's object is to call attention to what Greek art did for Greeks who fell in battle. The Long Walls of Athens.--In J.H.S. XXXIV, 1914, pp. 242-248, M. O. B. CASPARI examines briefly the evidence for the generally accepted view that there were in the fifth century three walls connecting Athens with the coast,-a north and a south or middle wall, running to the Piraeus, and a third or Phaleric wall, running further to the east and taking in Phalerum, at the east end of the bay of that name. He concludes that there never was a third wall; that Phalerum was at the west end of the bay, close to Piraeus and included by the eastern (southern) of the two parallel walls; and that for a time, in the days of Pericles, a single wall, the northern, perhaps with double face, may have answered the purpose of preserving a connection between the city and the port. The Trireme.-In the ninth volume of the new series of the Annual published by the University of Lund, A. M. ALEXANDERSON publishes a monograph on the Greek trireme. He discusses at length the positions of the rowers, the size of the trireme, its oars, rigging, anchors, and other equipment, its seaworthiness, its capacity for carrying sail, its crew, its use for special services, etc. [Den Grekiska Trieren.

The earliest example of the -rvXl, which was in use throughout the historic period, is found on a prehistoric terra-cotta from Syros probably dating from about 3000 B.c. The monuments, especially coins, show that it had nearly one hundred different forms, but the type adopted by</page><page sequence="23">GREEK MISC.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1915 477 Alexander after the congress at Corinth had made him hytcht acToKpdrwp in the campaign against Persia, was an upright staff with a cross-bar near the top. This is the form shown on the coins of Alexander and his successors and carried by the Victory of Samothrace. Sometimes a banner was attached to the cross-bar, which might also have an inscription upon it such as Zebs ZwT?~p. This implies that the arvXl was a sacred symbol. The shape in the form of a modern flag is known, but is rare. 2. The 4igacarov found on the stern of ships of war and other important vessels, but not on merchant ships or fishing boats was a semaphore, or signal post, i.e., it served as the support for FIGURE 2.-INNER DESIGN IN PHIALE AT ATHENS shields, streamers or lanterns used for signals. The admiral had his seat near it, so that his orders could immediately be signalled to the fleet. It was made of several narrow strips of wood fastened together by one or two cross-pieces and curving inward. The crvXls rested against or upon one of these cross- pieces. 3. The or6Xos was an ornament in the shape of a horn which pro- jected outward above the prow. Below it was the IrVx4 on which were painted the ship's eyes and the name. At the end of it was a figure such as an Athena, or the fore part of a lion, a bull, a rooster, etc. This was the</page><page sequence="24">478 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL.

The writer suggests that many of the monsters of Greek mythology owe their origin to these figures. An Emblema from a Phiale in Athens.--An emblema from a Phiale in Athens is published by G. MATTHIES in Ath. Mitt. XXXIX, 1914, pp. 104-129 (2 pls.; 9 figs.). It is made in three pieces: (1) a silver ring 13 cm. in diameter, with traces on its lower surface of the large bronze phiale in which the emblema was set. Its upper surface was covered by (2) a second ring decorated with representations of the labors of Heracles and a Dionysiac thiasus. The space within the ring was occupied by a bronze boss with a very elaborate geometric design made up of nine circular fields (Fig. 2). The figure designs on the ring were of gold and electrum set into the silver ground, with details of niello. The decoration on the boss consisted of thin threads and plates of gold, silver, and electrum pressed into the bronze after it had been softened by being heated. The emblema is a master-piece of antique goldsmith's work. The representations of Heracles recall types of the second century B.c., and the ornaments of the boss are related to floor and ceiling decorations of the same period. A Bronze Helmet from Domokos.-A bronze helmet from Domokos is pub- lished by N.I. GIANNOPOUTJLOS in Ath. Mitt. XXXIX, 1914, pp.316-319 (2 figs.). It is of characteristic Thessalian form, and is to be dated in the fifth century on the evidence of the inscription, IInbXos G eoaX&amp;'. Popilus was prob- ably a Thessalian general. The Tragic Stage.-Under the title ZKflV 7pa'yKu. Eine Studie iiber die scenischen Anlagen auf der Orchestra des Aischylos und der anderen Tragiker (Tiibingen, 1915, Mohr. 62 pp.; 4 figs. M. 2), F. NOACK publishes a study of the orchestra in the early Greek theatre, particularly in the time of Aeschylus. He discusses the period before the erection of stage buildings; their erection and development; the back scene; the entrances and exits in Aeschylus; scenery; the rapaoiKvla and I-pooK vLov; the front of the Telesterion; the Megaron of Lycosura; partitions between the columns in the Telesterion; and concludes with a sketch of the historical development of the stage buildings before the Hellenistic theatre. The Prothuron of the Ancient Theatre.-In Cl. Phil. X, 1915, pp. 117-138, K. REEs discusses, partly o1 the basis of the amphora of Ruvo, but chiefly by means of literary evidence, the use, in Greek and Roman plays, of the -rpLOvpov, for the purpose of presenting to the spectators events occurring indoors. The Boundaries of Meliteia, Pereia, Peumata and Chalae.-The boundaries of Meliteia, Pereia, Peumata and Chalae are discussed by F. STXHLIN in Ath. Mitt. XXXIX, 1914, pp. 83-103 (pl.; 6 figs.), on the basis of the inscriptions and the existing streams and ruins. Supplementary Chronological Studies.-In 'ApX. 'E4. 1914, pp. 185-192, K(. MALTEZOS revises his articles on the Attic calendar (ibid. 1913, pp. 109- 124) with the help of Vol. I of the new Editio Minor of I. G., without, however, affecting his results, except that the year 327/6 B.c., not discussed before, appears from I.G., Ed. Min. 356 and 357, to have been "ordinary." Leucas or Ithaca.-A contribution to the long-lived Leucas-Ithaca con- troversy, by A. SHEWIN, treats the question only as it is involved in the pass- ages about the return voyage of Telemachus from Pylos to Ithaca, in which</page><page sequence="25">ITAL. ARCH.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1915 479 he has to take a different route from that used in going out, in order to avoid the ambush laid for him by the suitors. On the whole, this portion of the evidence appears to be less in favor of the Leucadists than of the Ithacans. (J.H.S. XXXIV, 1914, pp. 227-241; map.) Pagasae-Demetrias.-In 'Apr. 'E4~. 1914, pp. 90-92, N. I. GIANNOPOULOS criticizes the views of Arvanitopoullos as to the location of Pagasae and of Demetrias published in IIpaKruKc, 1912, maintaining, with Beloch (Klio, 1911, pp. 142 ff.), that Pagasae was merely enlarged and renamed Demetrias by Demetrius Poliorcetes. A vigorous reply is made by ARVANITOPOULLOS, ibid. pp. 264-272, who quotes at length from his earlier article: Demetrius built a new city Demetrias, whose ruins, among which were found the painted grave- stelae, have been until recently called Pagasae; walls of an older city of con- siderable strength and extent, to the south of Demetrias and joining the walls of the latter, are to be identified as the walls of Pagasae. Yanetsa.---In 'ApX. 'E4. i914, pP. 184 f. G. MISTRIOTES upholds his view of the etymology of the name Yanetsa propounded ibid. 1913, pp. 20 and 230 (viz. from rLowavr&amp;ad, "the city of the lounan," the Turks having recognized in Pella a typically Greek city) against the view of HATZEDAKES, Annual of the University (Athens), 1913-14, p. 71, who derives it from rl4dv-s=Johannes. In 'Apx. 'E4. 1914, pp. 138 f. G. P. OrIKNoMos contests both of these views, holding that the name should be spelled reva&amp;d, a purely Turkish word, Yenidj= "New City," the older and larger town, about three miles away, being called Eskidj4= "Old City." The Old Iphigenia.-In R. Arch. XXIV, 1914, pp. 200-204, S. REINACH discusses the lines of Lycophron's Alexandra (193-196): 'Epylpos Cv Kp6KatL' vvjv4ov pSppos, ZTrEOVToS aras Kal K~V7) vavKXflplav, Kal ruv &amp;4avrov eito; 2oXXol/hvryv Fpatav o'ayehyw '8~ XepvtlPwv ir Xas... He concludes that Iphigenia was not transformed into an old woman to deliver her from sacrifice at Aulis (as has been stated by many compilers in ancient and modern times), but that the metamorphosis took place later, to fit her for her office of priestess. ITALY ARCHITECTURE Tombs of Canosa.-In Rem. Mitt. XXIX, 1914, pp. 260-296, H. NACHOD describes five tombs at Canosa (Canusium), one not yet published, the others inadequately, though all have been known for a long time. The older ones date from about 300 B.c., the others from 250 B.c. These tombs preserve the shape of a house that preceded the atrium house, i. e., short entrance, main room, small rear chamber, all lying in one axis. The older structures show architectural details going back to very old Greek models; the later ones indi- cate a more recent Greek influence, though not of the contemporary style of Greece proper. 9</page><page sequence="26">480 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XIX, 1915 SCULPTURE The Bronze Head of Augustus in the Vatican Library.-In Rim. Mitt. XXIX, 1914, pp. 186-193 (3 pls.), B. NOGARA discusses the bronze head of Augustus in the Vatican library. It is of unknown provenance, was first published by Pistolesi in 1829, and has been in its present position at least since 1845. It probably belonged to a body clothed in a tunic or a cuirass. It represents Augustus at the age of 35 or 40, and, next to the one from Meroe, is the best bronze portrait of the emperor extant. VASES AND PAINTING Tragic Scenes on Italo-Greek Vases.-In connection with the explanation of three Apulian vases, commonly interpreted as showing the killing of Anti- gone and Ismene by Laodamas, V. MACCoIORO (Neapolis, II, 1915, pp. 254- 282) defends the view that the tragic scenes upon Italo-Greek vases are de- rived, not directly from the stage, but from Greek tragic paintings of the fifth and fourth centuries. A valuable list (pp. 272-276) is given of paintings rep- resenting scenes from Greek tragedy. Chrysippus and Antigone on Apulian Vases.--The full-sized drawings by Liibke of scenes from Theban mythology on three Apulian amphoras, are pub- lished with comments by C. ROBERT (Jb. Arch I. XXIX, 1914, pp. 168-173; 3 pls., 2 figs.). One in Naples and one in Berlin give the rape of Chrysippus by Laius, with his father Pelops in one, his pedagogue in the other, trying to rescue him; the third, also in Berlin, represents a version of the story of Anti- gone in which, instead of being put to death at the bidding of Creon, she has remained hidden in the country with her husband Haemon, and is brought before the king when the identity of their son is discovered. All three compo- sitions show the attempt to combine distinct and inconsistent versions of the myths, but the exact poetical or traditional sources are not clear. The Paintings in Etruscan Tombs.-In Atene e Roma, XVII, 1914, cols. 129-164 (6 figs.), P. DUCATI gives a general account of the paintings in the tombs of Etruria, describing some of the more important examples. He divides them into two general classes: 1, those dating from the end of the seventh to the end of the fifth century B.c., in which Greek influence was very strong; and 2, those dating from the fourth to the beginning of the second century, in which the influence of Greek art becomes weaker and weaker and the Etruscan character of the paintings marked. The second class is far infe- rior to the first. Fabius Pictor and the Origin of Painting at Rome.-In Studi Romani, II, 1914, pp. 243-256, A. REINACH discusses Fabius PIictor, the frescoes of the tem- ple of Salus, and the origin of painting at Rome. He concludes that the temple in question might have been decorated at the date assigned by tradition, and that some idea of the character of the decoration may be derived from the frescoes found in a tomb on the Esquiline discovered in 1875 near the church of S. Eusebio. The paintings, however, were not the work of a Fabius Pictor; their assignment to a man of that name is due in part to the relation of the Fabii to the decoration of the temple and in part to a misunderstanding of the surname. The latter is interpreted by Reinach as "the Tatooer," rather than "the Painter."</page><page sequence="27">ITAL. INSCRIPTIONS] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1915 481 The Sources of Pompeian Wall Paintings.-G. LIPPOLD uses the painting of the Punishment of Dirce in the House of the Vettii in refuting Klein's theory that the Pompeian fresco painters followed plastic originals in their composi- tions rather than earlier paintings. This and other scenes he finds more closely allied to Etruscan urn reliefs, which are themselves allied to other flat compositions, whether Pergamene reliefs or fifth-century paintings, than to such groups as the Farnese Bull. The problem of the Laocoon group is anal- ogous. (Jb. Arch. I. XXIX, 1914, pp. 174-177; 2 figs.) The Telephus Fresco from Pompeii.-It has been recognized that the Telephus fresco from Pompeii is derived from Pergamene art, but whether it is a combination of several types, or a copy of a single famous Pergamene work has remained uncertain. F. MATZ, Ath. Mitt. XXXIX, 1914, pp. 65-71 (fig.), decides in favor of the second alternative. The Aldobrandini Marriage Scene.-In Arch. Anz. 1914, cols. 447-453, G. RODENWALDT discusses the architectural background or framing of the Aldobrandini marriage scene and its relation to scenes from the theatre and to the first period of Pompeian wall painting. He finds no reason for thinking the border is an addition of the Roman copyist. INSCRIPTIONS A Military Diploma.-In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1914, pp. 505-519, J.-B. MISPOULET discusses a military diploma found at Krnjesevci in Lower Pan- nonia in 1898 and published as No. CII in the Corpus. It is probably to be dated between 74 and 78 A.D., and belonged to a soldier of the legio II adjutrix. An Oscan Defixio.-An Oscan defixio, found at Cumae and probably dating from not later than 100 B.c., is published with full notes by F. RIBEZZO in Neapolis, II, 1915, pp. 293-300. Inscriptions from Tauriana.-Eight inscriptions from Tauriana secured by Professor Orsi for the Museo Civico at Reggio, are described by N. PUTOaRTI in Neapolis, II, 1915, pp. 342-344. None is earlier than the third century after Christ. The most interesting is one put up by a bishop in memory of his son. Sepulchral Inscriptions from Sorrento.-In Studi Romani, II, 1914, pp. 346- 347, L. CORRERA publishes nineteen sepulchral inscriptions of the classical period from Sorrento, one of which mentions a structor and another a mirmillo.. The latter suggests the presence of an amphitheatre at Sorrento, according to Correra. Latin Inscriptions in Philadelphia.-In Old Penn, April 10, 1915, pp. 873- 877 (fig.), J. C. ROLFE publishes nineteen short Latin inscriptions at the Uni- versity of Pennsylvania. The most important are No. 3, D. M. Nemoniae Crustinae; and No. 8, C. Pompeius 3. L. Ga. Pompeia C. L. Lais. patro suo. The name Crustina does not appear elsewhere; and the abbreviation Ga. for Gaia is apparently unique. Epigraphic Bulletin.-In their 'Revue des Publications relatives a l'Antiquit6 romaine' for July-December, 1914 (R. Arch. XXIV, 1914, pp. 361-383), R. CAGNAT and M. BESNIER give the text of 83 inscriptions (8 in Greek and the rest in Latin) and notes on epigraphic publications. An index is appended (pp. 384-400).</page><page sequence="28">482 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XIX, 1915 COINS Coinage of Umbria and Picenum.-The influence of the Siculo-Illyrican colonization upon the heavy coinage of Umbria and Picenum, as shown in the choice of coin-types, is discussed by G. PANSA (R. Ital. Num. XXVII, 1914, pp. 329-348; fig.). Coins found near Verona.-A rich find of imperial aurei and denarii made at MenA, in the province of Verona, as far back as Feb. 4, 1903, is now described by LUIGI RIZZOLI, Jr. (R. Ital. Num. XXVII, 1914, pp. 349-364). The hoard consisted of 1,227 pieces, of which 1,129 (20 aurei and 1,109 denarii) are now traceable. Dates range from Nero to Hadrian. The editor lists the more common coins according to Cohen, reserving the rarer pieces for later treatment. Hoard of Coins in Sardinia.-At Villaurbana (Cagliari) has been discovered a group of imperial large bronzes, 286 in number, with one middle bronze of Ihe elder Philip. The coins are for the most part in a remarkably good state of preservation, and are of fin3 patina. They range in date from Trajan to Trebonianus Gallus. AroNIO TARAMELLI has bestowed them in the National Museum at Cagliari, and describes them at length in R. Ital. Num. XXVIII, 1915, pp. 73-84. Halved Coins and a Find of Denarii at Terni.-LORENZINA CESANO describes a recent find of coins near Terni. The hoard consisted of 35 denarii dating between 129 and 36 B.c., one anonymous denarius of much earlier date, three asses and half of a fourth. Signorina Cesano takes occasion to revise, with these coins as a text, some of the dates assigned to the issues by Babelon, and then proceeds to treat of the question of halved coins. These she concludes to be due to a rough-and-ready device of the people to supply themselves with smaller denominations for purposes of change. It is impossible to tell whether the Roman government permitted, tolerated, or combated the custom; but the last is unlikely in consideration of the fact that the fashion of thus dividing coins lasted, especially in Gaul, down into the Middle Ages. It appears to have originated in Greece. (R. Ital. Num. XXVIII, 1915, pp. 11-38; pl.) Roman Coins and Historical Reliefs.-In B. Soc. Ant. Fr. 1914, pp. 245- 252, V. CHAPOT calls attention to the importance of Roman coins with repre- sentations of sculptured reliefs. They are valuable for the history of Roman art, and suggest that the origin of historical Roman reliefs should not be sought at Pergamon, but at Rome. Coinage of Augustus.-L. LAFFRANCHI publishes the third part of his treat- ise on the coinage of Augustus, discussing the issues from the mint of Rome. (R. Ital. Num. XXVII, 1914, pp. 307-328; 2 pls.) The Coins of Antinous.-In J. Int. Arch. Num. XVI, 1914, pp. 33-70 (5 pls.; 3 figs.), G. BLUM publishes an elaborate study of the coins which bear the por- trait of Antinous. Most of them were issued between 134, when Antinous died, and 138, the date of Hadrian's death; although at Bithynium his por- trait without the legend continued to be used under Commodus and Caracalla. The issue of these coins was widespread. In Egypt Antinous came to be identified with Osiris. Helena, Wife of Crispus.-As already noted in this JOURNAL (XVII, p. 559; XVIII, p. 237), Percy Webb, in Num. Chron. 1912, pp. 352-360; 1913, pp.</page><page sequence="29">ITAL. MISC.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1915 483 377-379, challenged the very existence of Helena, wife of Crispus, admitted by Jules Maurice in his Numismatique constantinienne. His arguments for a time upset the confidence of M. MAURICE, who now (Num. Chron. 1914, pp. 314-329; pl.; 3 figs.) returns with certainty to his former faith, supporting it by a study of the coiffures of Roman empresses of the Constantinian period. GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS The Prehistoric Settlement at Castel Manduca.-In B. Pal. It. XL, 1914, pp. 164-174, R. ZANOcco describes a prehistoric settlement at Castel Manduca near Vicenza, dating from the end of the Stone and the beginning of the Bronze Age. The Stone Age on the Maiella Range.-In B. Pal. It. XL, 1914, pp. 30-42, 95-121, U. RELLINI discusses the Stone Age on the Maiella range (near Sul- mona). Axes of Stone and Copper at Syracuse.-In B. Pal. It. XL, 1914, pp. 43-52, P. ORSI describes some stone and copper axes of the Basile collection now in the museum at Syracuse. Antiquities of the Early Iron Age.-In B. Pal. It. XL, 1914, pp. 73-83, L. PIGORINI discusses various objects dating from the beginning of the Iron Age, found in the excavations at Veio and Bologna. The Necropolis at Pianello.-In B. Pal. It. XL, 1914, pp. 121-163, G. A. COLINI continues his article on the necropolis of Pianello near Genga (Ancona). The Nuraghe Temple at Vittoria di Serri.-In Mon. Ant. XXIII, 1915, cols. 313-439 (8 pls.; 119 figs.), A. TARAMELLI discusses the nuraghe temple and other primitive remains at Vittoria di Serri, and describes in detail the metal objects (figures, etc.) and terra-cottas discovered on the site. Bronze Arrow-Heads.-In B. Pal. It. XL, 1914, pp. 56-71, G. BELLUCI dis- cusses some bronze arrow-heads, and argues that bronze-tipped arrows were not employed as weapons but only as votive offerings. The Cave of La Buca Tana.-In B. Pal. It. XL, 1914, pp. 1-29, A. MINTO and N. PuccIONI publish the results of the latter's renewed examination of the cave called La Buca Tana near Lucca. It contained fragments of human skeletons, animal bones, stone arrow-heads, bits of pottery, and other objects dating from the end of the neolithic and the beginning of the bronze eras. The Walls of Croton and of Hipponion.-In Ram. Mitt. XXIX, 1914, pp. 143-169, A. W. BYVANCK traces the course of the walls of Croton built in the fifth century and of Hipponion (Vibo, Monteleone) restored by the Cartha- ginians 379 B.c. He also discusses the topography and the extant remains of these cities. Appearance of the Ancient City of Rome.-In Cl. Jour. X, 1915, pp. 312- 322, F. S. DUNN calls attention to the effect which new constructions, repairs, and ruins must have had upon the appearance of the city of Rome, in contrast to the neat and orderly look of most modern restorations. The Porticus Europae.-A. REINACH (Neapolis, II, 1915, pp. 231-253) attempts to show that the work of art which gave its name to the Porticus Europae at Rome was not a painting but a sculptured group by Pythagoras, brought from Tarentum. The Residents of Pompeii.-In Neapolis, II, 1915, pp. 305-341, M. DELLA</page><page sequence="30">484 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XIX, 1915 CORTE continues from an earlier number his detailed identification of the resi- dents of the different houses at Pompeii. Glass Disks with Portraits in Gold Leaf.--In R m. Mitt. XXIX, 1914, pp. 240-259, (pl.), CARLO ALBIZATTI discusses three glass disks, two in the Vatican, and one at Brescia, with portraits in gold leaf. They date from the middle of the third century A.D., and are among the finest examples of the portraiture of the time. The Mosaic Portrait of Virgil.--In Mdl. Arch. Hist. XXXIV, 1914, pp. 287-304, JEAN MARTIN defends his belief in the authenticity of the portrait of Virgil on the mosaic of Sousse (cf. Gauckler, Mon. Piot, IV, pp. 232-244), the very early date of its original, and the consequent non-Virgilian authorship of the first seven lines of the Aeneid. This defense is called forth by the criti- cisms of Pascal (Athenaeum, Pavia, II, 1, pp. 29 ff.) and Comparetti (Atene e Roma, 1914, pp. 1 ff.) directed against Martin's first paper on the subject (M61. Arch. Hist. XXXII, 1912, pp. 385-395). Roman Paints.--In R6m. Mitt. XXIX, 1914, p. 220-239 (colored plate), E. RAEHLMANN gives the results of a miscroscopic and chemical examination of specimens of Roman paints found at Herne St. Hubert, Belgium, in a fourth century tumulus. A large number of them are water colors, containing min- eral, vegetable, and animal matter held together by gum arabic. India ink also occurs. Many of them are identical with the pigments used in the wall paintings at Rome and Pompeii. Ancient Inkstands.-In B. Soc. Ant. Fr. 1914, pp. 128-132 (3 figs.), L. DE- MAISON publishes three Roman inkstands in the museum at Reims; a fourth also from Reims is in his own possession. They are of terra-cotta, circular in shape, and vary from 5 to 7 cm. in height. The writer also calls attention to six vases of peculiar shape at Reims. They have a high foot supporting a shallow bowl in the rim of which at equal intervals are four sockets. The purpose for which they were intended is not clear. A Will in Latin.--In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1914, pp. 524-533, SEYMOUR DE RICCI discusses a papyrus copy of a will in Latin per aes et libram as set forth in Gaius II, 102-103. The document was acquired in Egypt in 1911 and is now in Berlin. Clearing the Roman Imperial Fora.-In Mh. f. Kunstw. VII, 1914, pp. 390- 392 (8 figs.), W. BOMBE gives a brief account of the plan to clear off the Roman imperial fora. A Bulletin on Excavations and Discoveries.-In Studi Romani, II, 1914, pp. 343-345, an official bulletin of the minister of public instruction, relating to the conducting of excavations and the publication of the finds, is reprinted with comments. Children of Divorced Parents.--In Studi Romani, II, 1914, pp. 257-260, E. COSTA discusses the status of the children of divorced parents, as shown by Graeco-Egyptian documents of the Roman period. FRANCE Prehistoric Remains in Gatinais.-In L' Homme prdhistorique, II, 1914, pp. 193-212 (14 figs.), P. BOUEX describes the prehistoric remains in the southern part of Gatinais.

The Dolmen-like Structure of Alise.-In R. Et. Anc. XVII, 1915, pp. 43-62 (3 figs.), J. TOUTAIN calls attention to the dolmen-like temple of Bellona at Sigus and argues that this is evidence that the structure at Alise was also a temple, and not a baker's oven. In Bulletin des fouilles d'Alise, I, 1915, pp. 70-74 (3 figs.), e. ESPARANDIEU points out that the bronze heads and coins found near the building by the Soci6t6 des Sciences de Semur in 1912 show that it dates from the third century A.D. The God Lug, Mother Earth, and the Lugoves.-In R. Arch. XXIV, 1914, pp. 205-230, J. LOTH discusses the etymology of the Celtic name Lug, the leg- ends connected with the god, his connection with Maia (Rosmerta), who is a goddess of the Earth, and the nature of the Lugoves. Lug, a sun-god, was identified by the Romans with Mercury, as Rosmerta, the earth-goddess, was identified with Maia. The Lugoves are a kind of Matres connected with Lug. The Goddess Maia.-In R. Arch. XXIV, 1914, pp. 182-190 (4 figs.), E. BABELON discusses a silver bust belonging to the "Treasure of Berthouville" (or of Bernay, as it is sometimes called) in the Cabinet des M6dailles. This bust was for many years separated from the rest of the treasure. It has been interpreted in various ways. Comparison with other monuments, which, like this bust, exhibit a female figure with wings in the hair, shows that the person represented is Maia, who appears as the associate of Mercury and en- dowed with his attributes, whether under the name of Maia or that of Ros- merta. The God with the Mallet.-In R. Arch., fifth series, I, 1915, pp. 26-39 (3 figs.), H. HUBERT publishes a bronze statuette found at Orpierre, Hautes- Alpes, now at St. Germain-en-Laye. It is poor work, but based on good models. In the right hand the figure holds a drinking vessel, and the left hand rests on a staff to which a cylindrical object probably belongs, forming, with the staff, a mallet. The head of the figure is crowned with leaves and the body is draped with a hide. The type is that of Silvanus, who is often identified with the God with the Mallet (Sucellus). The identification rests not merely upon identity of plastic types. Sucellus was a rural deity, god of fertility, god of beer, hence of the grain from which beer is made. Silvanus was also a god of fertility. Two figures in the museum at St. Germain (Nos. 3 and 127 in Rei- nach's catalogue) are not Jupiter and Hercules respectively, but Sucellus- Silvanus. Two Gallo-Roman Monuments.-In R. Arch., fifth series, I, 1915, pp. 1-3, J. D?CHELETTE explains the disk on the relief in Beauvais (Esp6randieu, Bas- reliefs de la Gaule, p. 157, No. 3923) as a hurling disk, used as a weapon. The relief formerly at Luxembourg, now lost (Esp6randieu, op. cit., p. 258, No. 4081) he interprets as Heracles leading Cerberus. Several reliefs relating to Heracles are at Arlon. The Excavations of La Cheppe, in 1857.-In R. Arch. XXIV, 1914, pp. 191- 199 (3 figs.), E. ESP1RANDIEU publishes an account by the Lieutenant Colonel Dogny, and his replies to questions asked by Commandant Aubry de la Noa, relating to the excavations carried on in 1857 at La Cheppe, called the Camp of Attila, not far from Chilons.

LAFAYE gives a brief account of a Roman building at Aix-en. Provence destroyed in 1760. It was known as "la Bastide forte," and was evidently a well-house. The Louvre has a drawing of it made by Peiresc in 1672. Painted Glass Vases.-In B. Soc. Ant. Fr. 1914, pp. 256-269 (3 figs.), A. HIRON DE VILLEFOSSE discusses several painted glass vases until recently pre- served in France. They fall into two classes, one decorated with vines, fruit, flowers, etc. (four vases), and the other with scenes of combat (two vases). Two vases of the first type, one complete and the other fragmentary, were found at Fraillicourt (Ardennes) in 1907 and were unpublished. They were in the museum at Reims which was completely destroyed by the Germans. Latin Inscriptions at Limoges.-In B: Soc. Ant. Fr. 1914, pp. 172-178, A. BLANCHET calls attention to five Latin grave inscriptions found at Limoges in the eighteenth century. SWITZERLAND The Dispater of Vibge.-In R. At. Anc. XVII, 1915, pp. 63-67 (5 figs.), C. JULLIAN suggests that the peculiar object on the front of the bronze Dispater of Viige (Reinach, Bronzes, p. 139) is a pot-hanger. Ibid. pp. 145-147 (fig.), W. DEONNA suggests that it is a solar symbol. Ibid. pp. 209-210 (9 figs.), L. DE VESLY argues that it is a key. GERMANY Palaeolithic Remains in Southwestern Germany.-In Mitt. Anth. Ges. XLIV, 1914, pp. 44-62 (2 pls.; 28 figs.), H. OBERMAIER and P. WERNERT discuss the finds of palaeolithic implements in southwestern Germany during the last ten years, particularly at Lichtenfels, Neu-Essig, and Happurg. They also publish a revised list of the placks in Gerinany where Acheulian remains have been discovered. SWEDEN Archaeology in Sweden.-In Fornvdnnen for 1913, pp. 1-27 and 61-91 (35 figs.), 0. MONTELIUS discusses the date at which the use of iron became general in Europe; pp. 28-60 and 91-124 (26 figs.), E.

Soc. Ant. XXVI, 1914, pp. 128-133 (6 figs.), R. A. SMITH discusses two cinerary urns of the early Iron Age of which fragments were found at Deal. They are of a thin, dark brown ware, slightly burnished and decorated with an incised step pattern which was derived originally from the Greek fret. They probably date from the fifth century B.c., and are an important addition to the antiquities of the earli- est Iron Age in Britain. Flint Implements from near Avebury.-In Proc. Soc. Ant. XXVI, 1914, pp. 73-85 (13 figs.), H. G. O. KENDALL discusses the types of flint implements found on the surface near Avebury. Romano-British Potteries near Glastonbury.-In Proc. Soc. Ant. XXVI, 1914, pp. 137-143 (5 figs.), A. BULLEID discusses the Romano-British potteries located about eight miles west-north-west of Glastonbury. They extend for three miles along what was once a swamp, and must have flourished during the latter part of the Roman occupation of Britain, especially about 230 A.D. The different types of vessels found are described. AFRICA Inscriptions from Gigthis.-In Mdl. Arch. Hist. XXXIV, 1914, pp. 267- 286, L. A. CONSTANS discusses nineteen inscriptions from Gigthis in Tunis, which had been published incorrectly or not at all. Gigthis was discovered in 1860 and is one of the best known of the ancient harbors on the Lesser Syrtis. Inscriptions from Djemila.-In R. Et. Anc. XVII, 1915, pp. 34-36, R. CAGNAT publishes two Latin inscriptions from Djemila (Algeria), the ancient Cuicul. One is a dedication to Mars Augustus and the Genius of the Colony, made by a certain T. Flavius Brencus. The second concerns a veteranus who is designated as acceptarius, a word not found elsewhere, which must mean a veteran who at the end of his term of service has received a lot of land instead of money. The Barbarian Jewelry of La Calle.-In B. Soc. Ant. Fr. 1914, pp. 212-216 (fig.), Baron J. DE BAYE points out that the "barbarian" jewelry found at La Calle in Algeria in 1894 and now in the Mus6e de Saint-Germain-en-Laye has pieces of malachite inlaid in it, and that malachite comes from the Ural Moun- tains. Similar jewelry was found at B6ne in 1888. The Vandals of Africa are thus seen to have had jewelry resembling that of the Goths, Franks, BUr- gundians, etc. UNITED STATES A Catalogue of the Cesnola Collection of Cypriote Antiquities.-The Metro- politan Museum of New York has recently issued a catalogue of the Cesnola collection of Cypriote antiquities by Professor John L. Myres of the Univer- sity of Oxford. The whole collection was thoroughly cleaned and studied and many discoveries were made, such as that Minoan numerals and a measure of value are found in inscription No. 1868; that, a portrait statue (No. 1363) probably represents Amasis, king of Egypt, etc. The pottery is classified in nine divisions of which three are devoted to the Bronze Age and three to the Iron Age.

These are classified as (1) statues, statuettes, and reliefs, and (2) implements and utensi's. The statues, etc., are arranged chronologi- cally, with a separate division for Italiote and Etruscan works, and the imple- ments and utensils are grouped under thirteen subdivisions. The arrange- ment is clear and practical. The descriptions, some of which are very brief, whereas others reach the proportions of real essays, are accompanied by numerous bibliographical references, and the illustrations greatly increase the value of the book.

RICHTER gives a brief account of the classical bronzes in the Metropolitan Museum of New York with illustrations of ten specimens. EARLY CHRISTIAN, BYZANTINE, AND MEDIAEVAL ART GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS The Golden Gate in Constantinople.-The Golden Gate in Constantinople is discussed by E. WEIGAND in Ath. Mitt. XXXIX, 1914, pp. 1-64 (6 pls.; 9 figs.). It was built by Theodosius the Younger between 425 and 430 A.D. as an organic part of his new city wall. The acanthus leaf of the capital used on the main gate is the first developed example of the canonical Byzantine type which goes back to a late Hellenistic type of acanthus. The fore-gate, more unusual in its architecture, shows in its details the same development of early Byzantine forms. The acanthus type of the capital, which has been thought to be isolated, has its roots far back in antiquity, and its development can be traced step by step. In the early Roman imperial age a unified style of architecture was formed, and spread through the empire. But East and West soon separated, and developed in parallel lines, borrowing traits from one another. Byzantine art inherited not only what was common to both, but also what was best in the artistic and technical achievements of each component. The fourth century marks the end of the antique world, in the fifth there was a sort of renaissance in which the separate provinces of the Roman empire became strongly differentiated. The age of Justinian could bring about only an external union in the Mediterranean world; it could not exercise a controlling influence on the separate stocks that had branched off.</page><page sequence="35">CHRISTIAN ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1915 489 A Sculptured Table-Top of Christian Times.--In 'ApX. 'E4. 1914, pp. 70- 84 (24 figs.) and pp. 260-264 (2 figs.), A. XYNGOPOULOS publishes a circular slab of marble, probably a table-top, found in Thera in 1866, and now in the National Museum at Athens (No. 2893, diameter 1.14 m.). It is decorated by a sculptured frieze which forms a raised border. This frieze represents wild beasts attacking their prey, with four human heads spaced at equal inter- vals. This is the best preserved of eight similarly decorated table-tops known to the writer. Another group is decorated with scenes from the Bible. The style shows greater affinity with classical and Alexandrian work than with Byzantine, and is probably a product of Egypt. The heads are probably reproductions of contemporary coin types, and those of the Thera table may with some degree of certainty be identified as portraits of Saint Helena, Crispus, Fausta and the young Constantine, fixing the date of the work in the first quarter of the fourth century after Christ. Whether the table is a product of Christian, or of pagan art cannot be determined. The Seal of John Doukas Batatzes.--In J. Int. Arch. Num. XVI, 1914, pp. 28-31 (3 figs.), K. M. KONSTANTOPOULOS points out that the seal published by G. Schlumberger in R. Et. Gr. 1900, pp. 479 ff., cannot be assigned to Michael VII Doukas (emperor 1071-1078 A.D.), but rather to John Doukas Batatzes (emperor 1222-1254 A.D.) as the style and method of lettering proves. The Seal of Nicetas, Metropolitan of Athens.-In J. Int. A rch. Num. XVI, 1914, p. 32, K. M. KONSTANTOPOULOS publishes a lead seal acquired by the National Museum at Athens in 1913. He identifies it as the seal of Nicetas, Metropolitan of Athens, who died in 1103. Saint Thecla.-The actual existence of Thecla, the martyr, is corroborated by an inscription (irpr7vpoF O6KXl7 u n~[Or&amp;) of the latter half of the first century of our era, found at the church of St. Menas, near Lapethus in northern Cyprus.

This scene is also repeated on a Sidamara sarcophagus fragment in the British Museum. The well known picture of the author with a female personification of Invention, EVPEZ2I2I, in the Vienna Dioscurides and the evangelist Mark with a female figure in the Rossano codex are to be inter- preted as readapted survivals. In later Gospels of east Christian type, prob- ably under Syrian influence, the composition shows many forms, the most important and frequent of which represents John dictating to Prochoros, a favorite Armenian subject. The other evangelists are also represented in similar compositions, receiving dictation from Peter, Paul, or an angel, accom- panied by the Virgin, or presenting their book to Christ, etc. An Ancient Origin for Mediaeval Grotesque Figures.-In R. Hist. Rel. LXIX, 1914, pp. 193-206 (10 figs.), W. DEONNA points out that the grotesque figures carved on cathedrals and elsewhere during the Middle Ages were not mere fantasies of the artist, but were intended to frighten away evil demons. Such monsters may be traced back to Baubo and other headless figures of antiquity. Birth in the Middle Ages.-In R. Arch. XXIV, 1914, pp. 266-295, A.</page><page sequence="36">490 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XIX, 1915 GASCARD collects and discusses the mediaeval miniatures and texts which throw light on the various medical, social, and superstitious practices in con- nection with childbirth during the Middle Ages, especially in France. ITALY Sibyls in Italian Art.-In L'Arte, XVIII, 1915, pp. 207-221 (3 figs.), A. RossI commences her study of the iconography of the sibyl in Italian art with a first installment, beginning with classic times and dealing with the earlier monuments. Lost Mosaics and Frescoes of Rome.-The fourth of the Princeton mono- graphs in Art and Archaeology is a publication by Professor Morey of drawings contained in the collection of Cassiano dal Pozzo, now in the Royal Library, Windsor Castle. The drawings are by Antonio Eclissi (about 1640). Those selected for publication represent the fresco in the apse of S. Lorenzo in Lucina, the tribune mosaics of Sta. Maria Nuova, the apsidal mosaic of S.Teodoro, the apsidal mosaic of SS. Cosma e Damiano, the frescoes of the oratory of Sta. Pudenziana, the mosaic in Sta. Maria in Trastevere with the fragmentary signature of Pietro Cavallini (restored [hoc op ml]us[iv fec]it Petrus [pictor]), the frescoes in the tribune of Sta. Passera, and five frescoes in the chapel of S. Nicholas in the Lateran. The originals are, with two exceptions (the apse of S. Teodoro and that of SS. Cosma e Damiano), works of the twelfth and thir- teenth centuries. The book, therefore, gives valuable information concerning the early part of the "classic renaissance" which preceded (and helped to form) the art of Giotto.

The Gemmed Cross of the Sancta Sanctorum Treasure.-In Rom. Quart. XXVIII, 1914, pp. 222-224, A. MACIEJCZYK identifies the gemmed cross in the Capella Sancta Sanctorum with the cross of the same description made under Leo IV to replace the one which Charlemagne had presented to Leo III on Christmas 800 and which had been stolen in the time of Paschal I. The Blue Bowl in the Treasury of St. Mark's.-In Burl. Mag. XXVI, 1915, pp. 140-145 (pl.), M. CONWAY reproduces the famous blue bowl in the treasury of St. Mark's, Venice, which was brought by the legate Agi Mohammed from the Shah Uzun-Hassan and presented to the Signoria of Venice. On the basis of the decoration with hares it can be assigned to the thirteenth century. The Statuette of Christ in the Museo delle Terme.-In Rom. Quart. XXIX, 1915, pp. 26-28 (2 pls.), P. STYGER publishes the newly acquired statuette of Christ of the Terme Museum, Rome (Fig. 3), and shows its similarity to the early sarcophagus type of seated Christ. Roman and Byzantine Sculpture at Ravenna.-In L'Arte XVIII, 1915, pp. 29-57 (26 figs.), G. GALASSI argues for the Roman origin and execution and character of most of the early Christian sarcophagi and other sculptures at Ravenna. An Early Christian Baptistery of the First Half of the Second Century in the Catacombs of Priscilla.-In R5m. Quart. XXVIII, 1914, pp. 217-221, P. STYGER summarizes the researches of A. Profumo (published in Studi Romani, 1913), which show that the room next to the Capella Greca formerly called a piscina stood originally in connection with that chapel and was used as a bap-</page><page sequence="37">CHRISTIAN ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1915 491 tistery. The rite of Infusio was the one practised here in the Roman church of the early second century. The Twisted Columns of S. Pietro in Vaticano.--In Studi Romani, II, 1914, pp. 347-354, M. CERRATI discusses the twisted columns decorated with vines (columnas intortas et vitibus puldhro opere insculptas) in the basilica of S. Pietro in Vaticano. He concludes that six of the columns go backto the earliest basilica in the latter part of the fourth or the beginning of the fifth century, while six others were added in the eighth century. The col- umns were all in their orig- inal positions at the end of March, 1544, but in sub- sequent changes of loca- tion three were lost or destroyed. The New Jewish Room in the Christian Museum of the Lateran.-In N. Bull. Arch. Crist. XXI, 1915, pp. 13-56 (pl.), G. S. GRAZIOSI publishes the inscriptions, mostly from the Jewish cemetery on the Via Portuense, which are now exhibited on the walls of the new Sala Giudiaca of the Lateran Museum. Oriental Art on the Early Christian Sarcophagi of Rome.-In Riom. Quart. XXVIII, 1914, pp. 207- 216, A. D. WAAL combats Baumstark's view that the sarcophagus of Junius Bassus and the related one in the Lateran, No. 174, are articles imported from the East. He argues that it would be a more reasonable hypothesis that the two sarcophagi, if eastern, were the work of oriental carvers settled in Rome. But the unity of the catacomb decoration tells against the supposition of an eastern school running parallel to the native school at Rome and, as to sarcophagi with sculptured biblical scenes, the results of our finds so far show that the whole Christian Orient practised that form FIGURE 3.-STATUETTE OF CHRIST IN ROME</page><page sequence="38">492 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XIX, 1915 of interment less than the West and hence would be unlikely to develop the dominating types. The Cost of San Vitale at Ravenna.-In Felix Ravenna, Fasc. 17, pp. 758- 760, C. RiccI reduces the cost of San Vitale, as reported in Agnelli, Liber Pon- tificalis, etc., into terms of modern money and finds that the original outlay was about 400,000 francs, making no allowance for the great change in the value of gold. Frescoes in the Church of S. Giovanni ante Portam Latinam.-In Studi Romani, II, 1914, pp. 261-328, P. STYGER describes the twelfth century frescoes of the church of S. Giovanni ante Portam Latinam, with nine plates and various smaller illustrations. The Excavations in the Church of Santa Sabina.-In Studi Romani, II, 1914, pp. 329-342, A. Murroz gives a preliminary report of excavations con- ducted in the church of Santa Sabina on the Aventine, and publishes two inscriptions. The Church of S. Angelo at Perugia.--In Arte e Storia, XXXIV, 1915, pp. 129-140 (6 figs.), S. M. MAZZORA reviews the involved problem of the origin of S. Angelo, Perugia. The Cross of Rovenna.-In Arte e Storia, XXXIV, 1915, pp. 56-58 (fig.), G. GEROLA writes a note on the bronze crucifix of Rovenna on Lake Como, dating it in the eleventh century and attributing it and the crucifix of Scaria to the same hand. The Facade of S. Mercuriale at Forli.-In Felix Ravenna, Fasc. 17, pp. 735- 757 (4 pls.), G. GEROLA discusses the facade of the church of S. Mercuriale at Forli and its restoration, of which he has charge. The edifice dates about 1200 with later alterations and additions. The Palazzo Fieramosca at Capua.--In Arte e Storia, XXXIV, 1915, pp. 2-8 (5 figs.), P. PARENTE writes on the history and present condition of the Palazzo Fieramosca of Capua, built about 1300 and recently saved from ruin by the Italian government. SPAIN The Portals of the Cathedral of Le6n.-In the Boletin de la Sociedad Espa- fiola de Excursiones XXII, 1914, pp. 255-261, A. D. PIRbN Y D. Cossfo describes the sculptured Gothic portals of the cathedral of Le6n. Most of the sculpture dates from the thirteenth century with some additions in later centuries. FRANCE Some Treasures of the Time of Charles the Bald.-In Burl. Mag. XXVI, 1915, pp. 236-241 (2 pls.), M. CONWAY discusses the golden altar-frontal which Charles the Bald presented to the abbey church of St. Denis. The frontal was melted down at the time of the French revolution, so that a representation of it in the picture of the Mass of St. Giles belonging to Mrs. Stuart Mackenzie and the lengthy description in the manuscript inventory of the treasures of St. Denis are our only records. They suffice, however, to show its points of contact with the Odiot ivory in Berlin (Goldschmidt's Corpus No. 23), a Caro- lingian South Kensington ivory (Graeven, No. 63), and the gold plaques of the cover of the codex aureus of St. Emmeran's. The Early Chapel of Sainte Reine at Alise.-In 1913 the Socidt6 des Sciences</page><page sequence="39">CHRISTIAN ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1915 493 de Semur excavated a number of tombs at Alise and near them remains of a building dating from the early Middle Ages. In R. Hist. Rel. LXIX, 1914, pp, 207-227, J. TOUTAIN identifies one sarcophagus as that of Regina, daughter of Clemens, who was martyred at Alesia and for whom the modern town was named Alise-Sainte-Reine. The building was the primitive basilica of Sainte Reine whose cult goes back as far as the sixth or fifth century A.D. GERMANY The Wooden Doors of St. Mary in the Capitol, Cologne.--In Burl. Mag. XXVI, 1915, pp. 202-208 (2 pls.), J. T. PERRY dates the wooden doors of St. Mary in the Capitol at Cologne in the early eleventh century and shows that they were carefully carved to imitate bronze casting. GREAT BRITAIN Sculptures of the Viking Period.-In Proc. Soc. Ant. XXVI, 1914, pp. 60- 72 (13 figs.), R. A. SMUITH calls attention to four carved slabs of the Viking period found a few years ago at Bibury (Gloucestershire) and now in the British Museum. Statues of Saxon Bishops at Wells.-In the choir aisles of the Cathedral Church at Wells is a series of recumbent figures of Saxon bishops which are interesting for the development of English carving in the west. In Archae- ologia, LXV, 1914, pp. 95-112 (6 pls.), J. A. ROBINSON discusses and identifies them. Five of the figures date from the first or second decade of the thirteenth century; the two others from about 1230. Brooches of an Irish Type.-In Archaeologia, LXV, 1914, pp. 223-250 (4 pls.; 14 figs.), R. A. SMITH makes a study of the so-called "penangular" brooches, which he shows are of an Irish type dating from about 500 to 1000 A.D. The Clephane Horn.-In Archaeologia, LXV, 1914, pp. 213-222 (2 pls.), O. M. DALTON describes the Clephane horn, long preserved in Carslogie Castle, near Cupar in Fife. It is of ivory, 22) inches long, with a diameter of 5 inches at the mouth. It is elaborately carved with four zones of figures, charioteers, men hunting rabbits with dogs, men engaged in a contest, and wild animals and animal trainers. The carving is Byzantine in character and may be as early as the tenth century. It is not later than 1204. The Wheel of the Ten Ages of Life in Leominster Church.-In Proc. Soc. Ant. XXVI, 1914, pp. 47-60 (5 figs.), G. M. RUSHFORTH, with the help of the Arundel Psalter in the British Museum (Arundel 83), identifies a painting in Leominster church as the wheel of the ten ages of life. It consists of a central disk from which radiate ten spokes each ending in a disk. Each disk con- tained figures representing the different ages of man. The painting dates from the thirteenth century. Another copy, poorly preserved, exists in Kempley church, Gloucestershire. The Tomb and Chantry Chapel of Henry V.-In Archaeologia, LXV, 1914, pp. 129-186 (7 pls.; 12 figs.), W. H. ST. JOHN HOPE discusses the funeral of Henry V, and his tomb and chantry chapel in Westminster Abbey.</page><page sequence="40">494 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XIX, 1915 RENAISSANCE ART GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS The Hieroglyphic Lore of Humanism in the Allegory of the Renaissance.- In Jb. Kunsth. Samm. XXXII, 1915, pp. 1-232 (3 pls.; 124 figs.), an extensive study by K. GIEHLOW on the hieroglyphic lore of humanism in the allegory of the Renaissance and especially in the Triumphal Arch of Emperor Maxi- milian I is published posthumously by A. Weixlgiirtner; the monograph offers a wealth of new and unique material concerning the humanistic move- ment of the Renaissance and its relation to the contemporary art, particularly Diirer's. Germanic Wafering-Irons.-In Proc.. Soc. Ant. XXVI, 1914, pp. 144-151 (13 figs.), W. L. HILDBURGH publishes a collection of Germanic wafering-irons of the sixteenth century. The designs upon them consist of the arms of pri- vate families, the arms of great reigning families, sacred subjects such as the crucifixion, fanciful designs, inscriptions, and secular subjects such as hunting scenes. ITALY Mythology and Ancient History in Italian Paintings of the Renaissance.- In R. Arch., fifth series, I, 1915, pp. 94-171 (8 figs.), S. REINACH gives a classi- fied list of representations of scenes from mythology and ancient history in Italian paintings on walls, wood, canvas, and paper earlier than 1580. The form is that of a lexicon. An index of names is appended. The Imitation of Nature in the Italian Renaissance.-In Z. Bild. K. XXVI, 1915, pp. 163-167, F. LANDSBERGER shows that while all Renaissance Italian writers on the theory of art clung to the doctrine that art is imitation of nature, they actually understood under "imitation" only rarely an illusionistic repro- duction, but generally a selective imitation of the beautiful in nature or even a pursuance of those laws which produce the beautiful in nature. The Meaning of the Camaieus under Raphael's Parnassus.-In Mh. f. Kunstw. VIII, 1915, pp. 10-16 (5 figs.), G. J. HOOGEWERFF reviews the question of the interpretation of the two paintings en grisaille under the Parnassus of Raphael (Figs. 4 and 5) and concludes that the view of Bartsch, repeated by Wlfflin, is the only tenable one. The left camaieu represents Alexander having his copy of the Iliad deposited in the coffer of Darius; the right, Augus- tus preventing the burning of the Aeneid. These frescoes date shortly before 1534. Masterpieces of the Czartoryski Collection, Cracow.-On account of the war a number of the principal treasures of the Czartoryski collection which have been removed from Cracow are now exhibited in the Dresden Gallery. In Z. Bild. K. XXVI, 1915, pp. 145-150 (2 figs.), G. GRONAU discusses the Portrait of a Young Man attributed to Raphael and the Leonardesque Girl with a Weasel. The former he sets early in Raphael's Roman period and suggests Johann Ruysch as the sitter. The latter is tentatively attributed to Boltraffio. A Picture in the Fogg Museum by the "Master of the Innocenti Corona- tion."-In Art in America, III, 1915, pp. 36-40 (3 figs.), O.

Correggio's Madonna d'Albinea.--In Pagine d'Arte, III, 1915, pp. 23-24 (2 figs.), A. BALLETTI proves that neither of the two versions of Correggio's Madonna d'Albinea now in the church of Albinea can be the original, as was recently claimed in several writings of O. Siliprandi. Botticelli's Paintings of the Miracles of Saint Zenobius.-In Art in America, III, 1915, pp. 192-195, J. P. RICHTER shows that the four well known Botticelli panels of the life of Saint Zenobius (for illustrations see A.J.A. XVII, 1913, p. 573), one of which is in the Metropolitan Museum, originally belonged to the Compagnia di San Zenobio at Florence, and apparently a fifth panel representing the burial of the saint has disappeared. Venetian Paintings in the United States.-In Art in America, III, 1915, pp. 43-55; 104-119; 141-173 (27 figs.), B. BERENSON surveys from a historical viewpoint the pictures of the Venetian school in our home collections with important new attributions and criticisms. Works by Caterino, Semitecolo, Michele Giambono, the Vivarini and their school, Carlo Crivelli and his fol- lowers are taken up in chronological order and a special chapter is devoted to Antonello da Messina and the numerous minor men who underwent his influence. Sculptures from Verrocchio's Workshop.--In Art in America, III, 1915, pp. 56-65 (8 figs.), O. SIREN writes on four pieces of sculpture in the United States from Verrocchio's workshop. They are a Madonna in marble relief and a terra-cotta bust formerly called Lorenzo de' Medici in the collection of Quincy Adams Shaw at Boston, a painted terra-cotta Madonna relief in the Metro- politan Museum, and another in the Widener collectibn. The writer dis- cusses also the Verrocchian terra-,cotta Madonna in the round in the Victoria and Albert Museum, calling it a Leonardo. Faentine Majolica in the Museum of Arezzo.-In Faenza, III, 1915, pp. 1-8 (3 pls.), A. DEL VITA writes on the Faentine majolica in the Museo della Fraternith dei Laici at Arezzo. The most important piece is a plate made by the CA Pirota and having a representation within of the School of Athens. Del Vita reads the mark on the back as the initials of Cristofano Scaletti, but the editor in a note shows that they are merely the Pirota mark plus the date 1524 or 1542. The Pavement of the Chapel of Ser Gianni Caracciolo in S. Giovanni a Carbonara, Naples.-In Faenza, III, 1915, pp. 33-45 (4. pls.), A. FILANGIERI DI CANDIDA pleads for the preservation of the ceramic pavement of the chapel of Ser Gianni Caracciolo in the church of S. Giovanni a Carbonara, Naples. It dates ca. 1427 and is Florentine with a strong admixture of oriental motive. Drawings by Cesare da Sesto in Relation to his Pictures.-In Burl. Mag. XXVI, 1915, pp. 187-194 (3 pls.), G. FRIZZONI studies the album of drawings by Cesare da Sesto (1477-1523), which passed from the hands of Mr. Fairfax Murray into the Morgan collection. Among the forty leaves of pen-drawings there are some related to the following pictures of Cesare: the Madonna of the Brera and the one of the Cook collection, the Budapest Holy Family, the Scotti Baptism, the Adoration of the Magi at Naples, and the Cook St. Jerome. Other drawings may be connected with the Leonardesque Youthful Bacchus</page><page sequence="43">RENAISSANCE ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1915 497 of the Louvre, and with the Berlin Resurrection which came from the church of S. Liberta at Milan and which Cesare might have studied there, though neither he nor any other Italian produced it. Raphael's influence is percep- tible in sketches for Saint Michael and for the Temptation in the Garden. A New Chapter in the History of Italian Majolica.-In Burl. Mag. XXVII, 1915, pp. 28-35; 49-55 (4 pls.), B. RACKRHAM discusses the majolica of Dureta and Siena. Dureta was under strong Sienese influence and a so-called "petal- back" group can be attributed to Dureta almost as well as to Siena, though the greater importance of Siena makes it the probable source, Dureta the derivative. But Siena in turn drew upon Faenza for types and the group of drug-pots with the inscription "Bo" seem Faentine rather than Sienese. Further Light on Baldassare d'Este.-In Burl. Mag. XXVII, 1915, pp. 98-104 (2 pls.), H. COOK repeats former attributions to Baldassare d'Este and makes the following new ones: A Concert from the Salting collection now in the National Gallery under the name of Ercole de' Roberti, an unknown portrait sold in the Abdy sale at Christie's, and the portraits of Giovanni Bentivoglio and his wife in the Dreyfus collection at Paris. Battistello.-In L'Arte, XVIII, 1915, pp. 58-75; 120-137 (18 figs.), R. LONGHI studies the art of the seventeenth century Neapolitan painter, Giovanni Battista Caracciolo, and appends a catalogue of his works. Raphael's First Master.-In Arte e Storia, XXXIV, 1915, pp. 111-115, L. FIOCCA denies that Evangelista da Pian di Meleto could ever have been the teacher of Raphael because there is no sign of his influence in Raphael's early works. The Youth of Giulio Campagnola.--In L'Arte, XVIII, 1915, pp. 138-156 (18 figs.), G. FIocco discusses as early works of Giulio Campagnola the series of frescoes of the Life of the Virgin in the Scuola del Carmine at Padua, the Lovers in the Benson collection, two engravings signed I. I. CA., and various small studies; to Campagnola also is ascribed some share in the two Uffizi panels attributed to Giorgione. The Aspertini.-In L'Arte, XVIII, pp. 81-119 (22 figs.), C. RIccI writes on the Aspertini and summarizes in convenient tables all that is known of their family, chronology, and works; documents are appended. Paintings Attributed to Lorenzo Monaco in the Vatican Gallery.--In L'Arte, XVIII, 1915, pp. 228-231 (2 figs.), L. BIAGI offers his solution of the Lorenzo Monaco problem in the Vatican Gallery. Nos. 78 and 82 show the forms of Lorenzo Monaco badly imitated. In Nos. 75, 76, and 77 the colors are not his. The quality of Nos. 69-74 is far below him. Only two pictures, one representing the Miracles of St. Benedict, the other, St. Anthony Abbot and St. Paul Hermit, are of the master. S. Anastasia, Verona.-In L'Arte, XVIII, 1915, pp. 157-171 (2 figs.), C. CIPOLLA continues the publication of his researches concerning the history of the church of S. Anastasia in Verona. An Attribution to Luca della Robbia.-In Mh. f. Kunstw. VIII, 1915, pp. 147-149 (11 figs.), W. BIEHL attributes the female bust, No. 177 of the Museo Nazionale, Florence, to Luca della Robbia, dating it 1440-1450. The Foundation of Pienza.-In Mh. f. Kunstw.

KERN contributes to Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. XXXVI, 1915, pp. 13-38 (18 figs.), a complete analysis of the prob- lems of perspective involved in Uccello's "mazzocchio" drawings and finds that they already imply the geometrical knowledge, probably based on Bru- nelleschi's researches, which first took systematic form in later treatises such as those of Leon Battista Alberti, Piero della Francesca, etc. Veronese and Zelotti.-In Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. XXXVI, 1915, pp. 97-128 (28 figs.), D. v. HIADELN continues his monograph on Veronese and Zelotti (cf. ibid. XXXV; 1914, pp. 168-220) and discusses the Montagnana Trans- figuration, the ceiling decoration and wall frescoes in S. Sebastiano at Venice, the Wives of Darius before Alexander in the National Gallery, the portrait of Pase Guarienti, and other single paintings by Veronese; the ceiling of St. Mark's Library by Veronese and Zelotti, and the decoration of the Palazzo Trevisan at Murano; and the works at Praglia and some minor pictures by Zelotti. SPAIN Christian Sculpture in Spain.-In Z. Bild. K. XXVI, 1915, pp. 129-144 (14 figs.), A. L. MAYER gives a general characterization of Spanish sculpture. The art of sculpture in Spain was at all times under strong influence from with- out; there were employed even more foreign sculptors than foreign painters. Decorative sculpture plays a leading r61e in the history of Spanish architecture and the relations of architect and sculptor were always the closest. The sculp- ture does not break through the architectural surface but tends to emphasize it or even give the effect of a fretwork spread over it. On the other hand, the polychromy in Spanish sculpture shows how close were the relations of sculp- tor and painter. Polychromy seems to have been due to Spain's connection with the Orient and to a special development of highly naturalistic sculpture by the church to offset the Mohammedan hostility to images. Religious sin- cerity and purpose is a specific trait of native sculptors as opposed to foreign sculptors working in Spain. The Castillo de la Calahorra.-In Boletin de la Sociedad EspaAola de Excur- siones, XXII, 1914, pp. 1-28, V. LAMP]REZ contributes a monograph on the origin and architecture of the Castillo de la Calahorra (Granada), which Rod- rigo de Mendoza, the first Marqu6s del Zenete built 1509-1512 as his palatial residence. Painters to the Kings of Spain.-In Boletin de la Sociedad Espaiola de Excur- siones, XXII, 1914, pp. 62-80, 133-160, 219-240, 296-306, and XXIII, 1915, pp. 51-64 (to be continued), F. J. S. CANT6N gathers material from Spanish archives and other literary sources and lists and discusses in chronological order each of the court painters of Spain from the thirteenth century, studying the works produced by them in their official capacity. Felipe Vigarni.-In Boletin de la Sociedad Espaiola de Excursiones, XXII, 1914, pp. 262-274, J. D. BORDONA publishes some new documentary notes from an inventory in the Cartuja of Miraflores concerning the sculptor Felipe de Vigarni or de Borgofla and gives a r6sum6 of what has previously been known of this artist. The first notice of Vigarni's activity in Spain is of his employ- ment on the sculptures of the cathedral of Burgos, July, 1498. Later he worked</page><page sequence="45">RENAISSANCE ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1915 499 at Granada, Toledo, Salamanca, Palencia, Valladolid, etc. He died in 1543. Ibid. pp. 275-295, E. TORMO continues the discussion of Vigarni with notes on his choir stalls at Burgos and at Toledo, attributing also to him the recum- bent figure of Archbishop Diego de Deza, now in the chapel of the Marqu6s de Malag6n in the cathedral of Seville and the figure of Isabella the Catholic in the Capilla de los Reyes Cat6licos in the cathedral of Granada. Velazquez Studies.-In Boletin de la Sociedad EspaAola de Excursiones, XXII, 1914, pp. 241-254, V. v. LOGA tabulates the results of his studies, most of which have previously been published, on the chronological arrangement of paintings by Velazquez. The Immaculate Conception.-In Boletin de la Sociedad Espa~ola de Excur- siones, XXII, 1914, pp. 108-132; 176-219, E. TORMO analyses the dogma of the Immaculate Conception and traces the iconography of this favorite subject through Spanish art. The Man with the Wineglass by Velazquez.-In Art in America, III, 1915, pp. 183-187 (fig.), A. L. MAYER attributes to Velazquez and dates about 1623 the painting of the Man with the Wineglass from the collection of Sir Prior Goldney, Bart., Derriads, Chippenham, at present the property of Duveen Brothers. Pictures of Still-Life and Genre Falsely Attributed to Velazquez.-In Mh. f. Kunstw. VIII, 1915, pp. 124-127 (7 figs.), A. L. MAYER shows that two whole classes of " bodegones" are wrongly attributed to Velazquez. The first group belong to Fray Juan Sanchez Cotan (1561-1627); the second group is not Spanish at all, but Neapolitan and can be attributed in part to Mariano Nani. Portraits by Sofonisba Anguissola.-The largest of the Tudor portraits in the National Portrait Gallery is the full-length of Philip II, which since its purchase in 1872 has borne the name of Alonzo Sanchez Coello. C. J. HOLMES in Burl. Mag. XXVI, 1915, pp. 181-187 (pl.), points out that the picture is not Spanish but Italian and assigns it to Sofonisba Anguissola, the famous woman painter in favor at the Spanish court at the time this portrait was painted, about 1570. The pedigree of the picture before 1872 is unknown. In a later article, ibid. pp. 228-236 (3 pls.), H. COOK determines the vital dates of Sofonisba Anguissola 1528-1625, and besides illustrating her por- traits of herself in the possession of the Earl of Ashburnham and of the Earl Spencer and her family portrait from the Raczynski collection, lists as hitherto unrecognized examples of her art a portrait of herself at Nuneham Park, one at Goodwood, one owned by Conte Mayno at Milan, and another, which is a replica of Lord Spencer's picture, in a private gallery at Bologna; a portrait of her father in the Volpe sale, Milan 1910; Nos. 74 and 140 in the Spanish exhibition at the Grafton galleries in 1913; a reduced copy of a Spanish Princess by her in an unnamed English collection and a full-length Philip II in a Scotch collection. A family group in the collection of Lord Methuen at Corsham Court is by Sofonisba or, more probably, by her sister Lucia. The Widower and his Children seem wrongly ascribed to Moroni in the National Gallery at Dublin when compared with the similar picture by Sofonisba in the Hage collection, Nivagaard, Denmark. The Evolution of Spanish Architecture.-In Boletin de la Sociedad Espasiola de Excursiones, XXIII, 1915, pp. 1-9, V. LAMPEREZ discusses the rapid evo- lution of Spanish architecture from 1480 to 1520.</page><page sequence="46">500 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XIX, 1915 Sixteenth Century Art in Huesca.--In Boletin de la Sociedad EspaFiola de Excursiones, XXIII, 1915, pp. 10-21, R. DEL ARCO publishes new documents for Dami~n Forment's retable for the high altar of the cathedral at Huesca and for the retable of the church of San Jorge by the sculptor Juan Miguel de Urliens. Ucl6s.--In Uclds. Documentos iniditos y algunas noticias tomadas de sus Archivos, Part III (Cadiz, 1915, Manuel Alvarez. 221 pp.; 11 pls.; 14 figs.), PELAYO QUINTERO ATAURI continues his publication of the documents in the archives of Ucl6s, Spain (see A.J.A. XVIII, p. 532). They have to do chiefly with the fourteenth, fifteenth, sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and are largely historical in character. FRANCE The Collection of Baron de Schlichting.-In R. Arch. XXIV, 1914, pp. 338-340, SEYMOUR DE RICCI gives a brief description of the collection of the late Baron Basile de Schlichting (died August 8, 1914), which is inherited by the Louvre. The collection consists of more than one hundred paintings of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, besides a number of fine works of the Italian Renaissance. The French school of the eighteenth century, the Flemish and Dutch schools of the seventeenth century, and Murillo are admi- rably represented. There are also admirable sculptures of the Renaissance and the eighteenth century. Note on the Trbs Riches Heures of Duc Jean de Berry.-In the Tr~s Riches Heures of Duc Jean de Berry in an ellipse having the signs of the zodiac and the months are two human figures back to back in such a way that the face of one shows and the back of the other. In R. Hist. Rel. LXIX, 1914, pp. 183- 193, M. DEONNA argues that they represent the East and the West, or Day and Night. They may be traced back to ancient prototypes. BELGIUM AND HOLLAND A Picture by Pieter Candid in the Haarlem Museum.-A painting in the city museum of Haarlem representing King David and Saint Cecilia has long been ascribed to Jan Scorel because of the mention of a Saint Cecilia by Scorel in a source of 1573. In Mh. f. Kunstw. VIII, 1915, pp. 81-83 (fig.), O. HIRSCHMANN publishes a contemporary engraving of the picture by Jan Sa- deler, who labels it as a work of his companion, Pieter Candid, otherwise known as Pieter de Witte. On the basis of the engraving the picture may also be dated about 1590. Jan van Rillaer, the Town-Painter of Louvain.-Apropos of the report of the destruction of Louvain, A. KUHN contributes an article in Z. Bild. K. XXVI, 1915, pp. 81-89 (18 figs.), on the town-painter of the city, Jan van Rillaer (d. 1568). His painting, the Judgment of Solomon, in Berlin, dated 1528, is a slavish imitation of Lucas van Leyden. The engraving of the Madonna by the Wall is a reversed, feeble copy after Diirer; other engravings, too, show Diirer's influence. Further works discussed are four wings of an altarpiece in the Louvain museum and four panels in St. Pierre. A Behead- ing of St. Catherine in the Golenistceff-Contouzoff collection, Petrograd, may be assigned to the master, while four other altar wings in the Louvain museum belong to his school.</page><page sequence="47">RENAISSANCE ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1915 501 Jan van der Heyden.-In Z. Bild. K. XXVI, 1915, pp. 181-187 (2 pls.; 6 figs.), W. v. BODE writes a short criticism of Jan van der Heyden (1637- 1712). This artist occupies a place analogous to that of Canaletto. The "Master of the Mansi Magdalene."-In Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. XXXVI, 1915, pp. 6-12 (pl.; 4 figs.), M. J. FRIEDLANDER, taking as his point of depar- ture the Mansi Magdalene in Berlin (No. 574D), reconstructs a master who is dependent on Quentin Metsys for his figures and borrows much of his land- scape from Diirer. A dozen paintings are connected with him, including the Saviour (No..90) of the Johnson collection. Antwerp Mannerists of I52o.-In a study of the Antwerp Mannerists who were active about 1520 (Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. XXXVI, 1915, pp. 65-91; 3 pls.; 8 figs.), M. J. FRIEDLiNDER groups the numerous pictures, many of which have been wrongly labeled, "Herri Met de Bles," into five groups: (1) the group of the Munich Adoration, Pinakothek, No. 146; (2) the group of the Milan Adoration, Birera, No. 620; (3) the group of the Groote Adoration, Kitzburg; (4) the group of the Antwerp Adoration, Ertborn collection, Nos. 208-210; (5) the group of the Liibeck Altar. The second of these groups and possibly also the first can be connected with Jan de Beer, but the studios which pro- duced the others remain for the present undetermined. Joost and Cornelis van Cleve.-In the thirtieth installment of his notes on pictures in the royal collections in Burl. Mag. XXVI, 1915, pp. 169-172 (2 pls.), L. CUST is aided by F. J. VAN DEN BRANDEN, archivist of Antwerp, who furnishes a brief biography of Joost and Cornelis van Cleve. Joost van Cleve (ca. 1490-1540) is now generally identified with the "Master of the Death of Mary." His son, Cornelis van Cleve (1520-1567) is the same as "van Cleve the Mad." Of the latter Cust publishes from Windsor Castle a portrait of the painter and one of his wife, as well as a Parmesque Adoration of the Shep- herds formerly attributed to Joost van Cleve but resembling more closely the works of Cornelis. Carel van der Pluijm.-A little known follower of Rembrandt, Carel van der Pluijm (d. 1672) is discussed by J. O. KaoNIG in Burl. Mag. XXVI, 1915, pp. 172-177 (pl.). The Parable of the Labourers in the Vineyard in the Cook collection had already been attributed to this master and happily a recent restoration has revealed his signature. Other known works by him are a Philosopher in the museum at Leyden, an Oriental Clothed in Red in the col- lection of Mr. L. Bourgeois in New York, an Old Man Reading in the collec- tion of Dr. Stillwell in New York, and a Money Changer, signed and dated 1659, sold at Christie's, July, 1912. The So-Called "Young Samson by Rembrandt."-In American Art News, for January 9, 1915, is published a portrait called "Young Samson by Rem- brandt" which was recently purchased by Mrs. Robert D. Evans, Boston. L. CUst in Burl. Mag. XXVI, 1915, p. 256 (pl.) questions the attribution and would prefer to call it a portrait of Ferdinand Bol by himself, pointing out at the same time that the picture is not from the Hope collection as alleged but belonged originally to the Metcalfe family, Suffolk. GERMANY Two Illustrations of a German Proverb.-In Burl. Mag. XXVI, 1915, pp. 145-146 (pl.), C. DODGSON illustrates the German proverb, "Der Hoffart sitz7</page><page sequence="48">502 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XIX, 1915 der Bettel auf der Schleppe," with the familiar painting by Altdorfer in the Kaiser-Friedrich Museum and a small, similarly composed pen and ink draw- ing by Hans Sebald Beham in the British Museum. The picture is dated 1531 and the drawing is of approximately the same date, but their resemblance is more probably due to some common literary source which inspired them than to the influence of Altdorfer on Beham noticeable elsewhere. The Ancestry of Albrecht Diirer.--In Burl. Mag. XXVII, 1915, p. 78, F. HAVERFIELD calls attention to a number of considerations which point to the Magyar blood of the Dfrer family. In the Hungarian neighborhood from which Albrecht's ancestors came, no German settlements at that date are recorded in the exhaustive compilation of Kaindl. The pastoral occupation of the family was that of Magyars rather than Germans. DiXrer cannot be shown to be a German name. None of the Christian names of the family are specifically German; rather they con- sistently reflecdt the names of the royal house of Hungary and one, Ladislaus, is distinctly not German but Magyar or Polish. As a matter of fact, Dtirer's own cousin was known in Cologne as Niklas the Hungarian. Konrad Meit of Worms.-In Mh. f. Kunstw. VIII, 1915, pp. 37-45 (14 figs.), W. VOGE revises, mainly in view of numerous publications of V. Nodet, his article, 'Konrad Meit und die Grab- denkm~iler von Brou' in Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. XXIX. V6ge repeats his attri- bution of the Fortitudo with the Column in the Cluny Museum to Meit and points out also that it is reproduced in an engraving of Nicolaes de Bruyn, which attests the high esteem in which the piece was then held. Nodet has greatly increased our knowledge concerning Meit's tombs at Brou, especially by pub- lishing a compilation made by Pater Raphael at the beginning of the eighteenth century from archives now lost. Of the monument to Margaret of Bourbon, besides the figure of the dead, which is in each case by Meit himself, the two putti at the foot and the left one at the headare by the master's hand and only the right one at the head a product of his workshop. These putti date about 1526-1528. The date of the figure of Margaret of Austria (Fig. 6) is given on the border of her robe, 1531, and that must date approximately the two pairs of putti at her tomb. They are the work of pupils, though in the pair at the foot, which Pater Raphael as- FIGURE 6.-MARGARET OF AUSTRIA BY KONRAD MEIT</page><page sequence="49">RENAISSANCE ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCUSSIONS, 1915 503 cribes to a brother Thomas Meit, one would like to see the hand of the master, Konrad, himself. The putti at Philibert's tomb are by Benoit de Serins and Onofrio Campitoglio, but here, too, the one with the glove approaches the master's style. Probably he furnished models to all these pupils except Benoit de Serins. Other than these tombs only one large work by Konrad Melt is now preserved, the incomplete Pieta in the cathedral of Besancon. Drawing with Colored Inks.-In Mh. f. Kunstw. VIII, 1915, pp. 166-169 (fig.), E. PANOFSKY discusses the colored ink drawings of Virgilius Solis and those of Diirer. The former by attempting to introduce numerous colors in a line drawing destroyed the formal and spatial effects and conventions peculiar to linear work without producing the surfaces and lights belonging to true color work. On the other hand, Ditrer, in the designs in various colors of the prayer-book of Maximilian I, by executing each in a single ink retained the abstract character appropriate to the line while enhancing the decorative effect of the pages. The Wood-Cuts of the Genealogy of Maximilian I by Hans Burgkmair the Elder.-In Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. XXXVI, 1915, pp. 39-64 (16 figs.), H. ZIMMER- MANN contributes a study of Hans Burgkmair the Elder's series of wood-cuts of the Genealogy of Maximilian I. The series of seventy-seven cuts in the Vienna Hofbibliothek which was struck off in a single copy for the Emperor himself can be dated with high probability in 1512, but before that date Burgk- mair printed numerous artist's proofs of single wood-cuts of the series, which contained in 1510 at least fifteen numbers more than are found in the Emperor's copy. Thirteen of these additional subjects and some early proofs of the seventy-seven in the Hofbibliothek came to the Vienna Hofmuseum from the Ambraser collection. In the royal cabinet of engravings at Stuttgart are four more unique examples, but they illustrate the artist's return to the never fully completed task and date about 1519. Of the stray proofs of the genealogy series in various museums and cabinets there are a dozen (eleven at Wolfen- bittel, one at Berlin) which, without adding any new subjects, have, never- theless, a peculiar interest because of the rhymes below, which the artist has written concerning the figures represented; the rhyme on the Berlin example could not have been composed previous to 1516. The series of genealogical wood-cuts was copied and imitated in other works of Burgkmair and his followers, so that copies may even be detected in certain cases where the original cuts are lost. Martin Schongauer's Engravings.--In Z. Bild. K. XXVI, 1915, pp. 105- 112 (pl.; 5 figs.), M. J. FRIEDLANDER makes a general chronological arrange- ment of the engravings of Schongauer. The first group consists of three obvi- ously less skillful and feebler examples, B. 31, B. 69, and B. 8. The influence of Roger van der Weyden is particularly marked in B. 69. The second group comprises the remaining engravings which bear the vertical M; the third group, signed with the pyramidal M, contains his mature works. The Danzig Painter Daniel Schultz.-In Mh. f. Kunstw. VIII, 1915, pp. 1-9 (14 figs.), G. CUNY gives a brief of the life and works of Daniel Schultz (d. 1683), who is with Andreas Stech one of the most interesting figures of the Danzig school. Stech had a local style influenced by Thomas de Keyser and Pierre Mignard. Schultz is cosmopolitan, taking something from Hals and Rembrandt for his portraits, which were very popular at the Polish court and</page><page sequence="50">504 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XIX, 1915 in Danzig, and suggesting Snyders and Hondekoeter in his animal painting. He was an accomplished etcher, as is shown by the three sole known examples of this side of his activity in the Dresden cabinet. GREAT BRITAIN Two Well Known English Private Collections.-In Burl. Mag. XXVI, 1915, pp. 241-243, R. C. WrrITT characterizes and contrasts, apropos of the recent appearance of catalogues, the collection of Sir Frederick Cook and that of Mr. R. H. Benson. The former is a catholic encyclopaedic collection representa- tive of the various schools, periods, and subjects; the latter is a very personal one, practically limited to the Italian quattrocento and cinquecento. A Flemish Chest in New College, Oxford.-In Archaeologia, LXV, 1914, pp. 113-128 (2 pls.; 5 figs.), CHARLES FFOULKES discusses a carved Flemish chest, dating from the early part of the fourteenth century, in New College, Oxford. The scenes upon it represent incidents in the battle of Courtrai fought between the French and Flemings, July 11, 1302.</page></plain_text>
