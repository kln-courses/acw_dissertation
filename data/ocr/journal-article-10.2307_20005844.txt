<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sarasvati Chennakesavan. A Critical Study of Hinduism. Pp. xiv + I 59. (Delhi, Motilal Banarsidass, 2nd edition, I980.) Rs. 40. In his foreword to this book the retired vice-chancellor of Mysore University, Professor Nikam, described it (I 97 ) as 'a rapid survey' and that is precisely what it is. The author, herself retired from a chair in philosophy (Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh), discloses that it sprang from a series of lectures she gave to a group of students training for missionary work in India. In preparing the text for publication she made it into neither a systematic textbook for students nor a popular book for the layman. Least of all could it be regarded as a scholarly work. It is rather a personal study of some aspects of Hinduism which, the author admits, she made for the first time when asked to prepare the lectures. The book starts with a short chapter 'The Climate of Indian Thought' explaining basic notions such as the word Hinduism, samatana dharma, sruti and smrti. The bulk of the material is presented in three chapters. 'The Religion of the Vedas and the Upaniaads' is heavily dependent on nineteenth century European scholarship supplemented by Radhakrishnan's views and two references to Hiriyana. She seems never to have come across the works of Renou, Dumezil or Thieme, let alone the important researches ofJ. Gomda. Consequently the Vedic religion starts for her with nature worship with 'anthropomorphic overtones' which 'slowly drifted towards a monotheistic conception of godhead ', especially in relation to the question of creation of the world. The passages on the Upanisads are the best ones in the book giving a quite adequate summary of their teachings with the exception of transmigration which she completely neglects, although it is in the early, pre-Buddhist Upanisads that it receives its first clear formulation and the later ones elaborate it substantially. The chapter 'Aspects of Hindu Theism' traces the theme from the Svetas'vatara Upanisads through the epics to the Puranas, touching briefly on the problem of the Hindu Trinity and turning then to sectarian teachings. In dealing with the doctrine of divine incarnations the author quotes Max Muller's view of Buddhist influence on its formation, but suggests that it might be just the reassertion of the Upanisadic teaching of God being the 'indweller' in all beings. Krishna receives lengthy treatment as the most influential avatara as does the Bhagavad Gitd as 'the most universally</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 251 accepted scripture'. Sankara's view of theism as 'only contingently useful' is mentioned before Ramanuja's and Madhva's theistic tenets are dealt with. When describing Sivaism the author plays down the phallic basis of the liniga worship and similarly gives only subdued attention to Tantric practices. In the chapter on 'Ethics of Hinduism' the author finds two sources of morality in Hindusim: (i) the universal law (rta of the Vedas) incorporating both the cosmic and moral order which is reflected also in ritual and operates as karma or the law of retribution in man's successive lives in the round of rebirths; (2) 'the mentality of the ordinary Hindu' who 'becomes satisfied where the origin of the rules of conduct is traced to some scriptures or other'. Basically, the moral ideals derived from the scriptures and described in the kalpa sutra manuals took the form of four aims to be realised by a Hindu: the first three, viz. dharma or fulfilling one's duty, artha or achieving material prosperity to be able to fulfil one's duties and kama or pleasure 'channelled into proper paths', acknowledge the need of man to lead a composite life. The fourth one, mokya or 'release from the bondage of the life of this world', the final goal of religious life usually achieved only after many lives, demands the adoption of a path of renunciation as a saninyasi or of renunciation in action (by giving up the fruits of it - selfless action) in the sense of the karma marga of the Bhagavad Gita. In the last chapter called 'A Retrospect' the author highlights the lofty ideals of Hinduism based on Vedic and Upanisadic achievements as represented in modern times by outstanding individuals such as Ramakrishna, Vivekananda and Gandhi. She points out that while the scientific spirit of Western civilisation is compatible with them, the Western materialism which goes with it is not. She regards Hinduism as 'one of the noblest religions', but complains that this 'is lost in the trappings of mumbo-jumbo practised by the priests'. Nevertheless she ends with an optimistic note that Hinduism 'will once again attain its pristine glory'. On the whole the book makes the impression of having been written hastily. Its style suffers from frequent cliches such as 'It is an accepted fact that. .. ', 'It is believed that. . . ', 'It is interesting to note that. . . ' and so on. The bibliographical data in footnotes are often incomplete and there is no bibliography at the end of the book. The index is far from complete, for example although a number of Western scholars are mentioned throughout, only Zaehner got an entry. Max Muller, several times referred to in the text, and others also mentioned were denied this honour. Subject entries are also incomplete, for example rebirth and transmigration are not entered although they occur several times in the text and reincarnation refers to a page where there is only a passing reference to it while the whole theory is discussed on several pages elsewhere. The book is hardly a contribution to our knowledge of Hinduism and its critical evaluation and it is not a useful introduction to Hinduism, at least</page><page sequence="3">252 RELIGIOUS STUDIES for a Western newcomer to the subject. Maybe its first edition (I974) threw up a few useful questions for the Indian reader, but the usefulness of a second edition is doubtful even for him. KAREL WERNER</page></plain_text>
