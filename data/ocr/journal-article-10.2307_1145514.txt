<plain_text><page sequence="1">Since 1971 the main focus of our research has been the elements of Voltaic art which are the most significant from both a sociological and an esthetic point of view. This homogeneous group of original masks is characteristic of the Voltaic populations. They play an important part in the socio-religious organization of the community, whereas other objects (statues, amulets, etc.), belong mainly to private, familial or individual cults, to parareligious activities (magic), or even to anti-religious practices (witchcraft). A study of the forms and functions of this group of masks has demonstrated the similarity of their origins and their unique distinction from the masks of neighboring communities (Bambara, Senoufo, Baoule). The most remarkable masks are used by the Kurumba, the Nyonyose, the Dogons, the Gurunsi, the Bwa, and the Bobo. Our approach to the art object is neither esthetic nor ethnological. It belongs in the new field of sociology of art in societies without written language. The mask is studied neither as a loaded esthetic object nor as an annex to support some more or less related ethnological paper. It is analyzed as a sign-in the linguistic sense of the word-through which a culture controls and organizes its environment. The mask is constituted by a number of coded elements (shapes and designs) which must be analyzed before its socio- cultural function can be understood. The study of form shows that there are two distinct types of masks: simple masks made of one element and complex masks. Among the simple masks only a few represent humans. They are found in specific locations (Bobo, Nyonyose) and are generally related to the cult of the ancestors. There are many more zoomorphic masks, representing a wide variety of both wild and domestic animals. The most usual are antelopes, caymans, buffalos, hornbills, monkeys, hyenas, lions, rams, and cocks. The masks are covered with geometric designs in very bright colors (white, black, red-hardly any other colors are used), and their shapes are geometrically stylized. They are completed by a costume THE DRAMA REVIEW, Volume 26, Number 4, Winter 1982 (T96) 0012-5962/82/040038-08 $4.00/0 ? 1982 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Reprinted by permission of Cherif Khaznadar from Les Masques et leurs Fonctions, edited by Cherif Khaznadar, published by Maison de la Culture de Rennes, France.</page><page sequence="2">AFRICA 39 made of dyed plant fibers which completely cover the dancer's body, creating spectacular effects when the mask is worn. As an inheritance from the distant past, zoomorphic masks support the evidence that man's first artistic works were created by hunters. In Voltaic societies today, hunters have a cultural importance which no longer has a relationship to their role in the economy. Zoomorphic masks signify the special attachment and the essential symbiosis which, in the animistic universe, unites the realm of people with the realm of animals. In the complex masks, the basic anthropomorphic or zoomorphic element which forms the face is surmounted by a non-realistic attachment made of a thin piece of wood that is generally long and rectangular. It is notched, pierced, and carved with multicolored geometric patterns. To this abstract base a variety of figurative elements may be added, including male or female statues, dolls, phalli, moon crescents, sun disks, cayman beaks, antelope heads, snakes, or chameleons. The general effect is often quite complex. Through its mythological meanings, the mask attempts to integrate the structures particular to a given collectivity. All the Voltaic peoples use the same basic mask forms but each com- munity modifies them according to its own socio-cultural needs and creates works which reflect their own unique characteristics. Although rich in symbolic meaning, mask designs are always restrained and moderate due to the stylization and the judicious arrangement of the various decorative elements. The correlation of Voltaic masks is evident in the formal similarities and, even more importantly, in the types of decorative designs. These designs consist of about a dozen geometric motifs: dot, circle, semicircle, crescent; straight, curved, interupted, winding Bobo masks from Upper Volta.</page><page sequence="3">40 THE DRAMA REVIEW/T96 Great yearly dance of the "King." The great masked dance of Chief Nkanga and his ministers takes place each year in the market place of Banjoun (one of the most important chiefdoms in the Bamileke Territory). lines; triangle, diamond, square, and rectangle. Sometimes highly stylized figurative motifs are incorporated into the geometrical designs: bows, spears, hoes, spoons, anvils, cha- meleons, and serpents. These designs, both geometric and figurative, are not only used on masks but also on most ritualistic objects (stakes, statues, holy stones, stools, staffs) and in many other circumstances (body and facial markings, fabrics, architectural struc- tures). In these instances, however, the designs are employed less systematically and less elaborately than on masks, where their primary function is essentially that of language. In effect, the mask's designs are coded, and apart from a few local variations, their signification is firmly established. Decoding the language of the mask is an extremely delicate undertaking as it concerns secret significations and requires knowledge forbidden to the uninitiated-women, children, foreigners, and a whole variety of outsiders who are no longer integrated into a given community as a result of the breakdown of many traditional cultural structures. The dis- closure of secret information to someone who is not an initiate threatens the harmony and the prosperity of the collectivity and makes it susceptible to very serious consequences. Religious leaders politely discourage outside curiosity concerning the masks and they usually become quite impenetrable when interest is shown in the mask designs. If nec- essary, they would take their secrets with them to the grave rather than consign them to irreverent heirs, and would choose cultural death for the collectivity rather than the des- ecration of the masks. Many traditions are lost in communities weakened by generational conflicts and the intermixing of ethnic groups, by modern ideas and urban development, and above all, by conversion to different religions. In Say, in the Yatenga region, for example, the priest of the Wogodo Sawodogo territory is the final inheritor of a tradition</page><page sequence="4">AFRICA 41 that has endured for more than a thousand years. He is now isolated in a village which has completely converted to Islam; he is subject to constant intimidation, and his own sons threaten to throw his body to the vultures unless he destroys his masks. When he dies, the Say masks and the secrets of their meaning will die with him. Even in areas where masks are disappearing more gradually, they are often no more than empty signs, a silent language. When masks are used without a full knowledge of the code, their articulative power is reduced to a confused stammer. The main obstacle to reading masks is the complexity of their multidimensional language. The same design may have several meanings which correspond to several different levels of knowledge- a superficial level accessible to all initiates, an intermediate level for those who are more In Tanzania, masks can be divided into two groups: face masks called Midimu (plural) and N'dimu (singular), and body masks which are the only ones of their kind found in this region of Africa. The Makua people call these masks Isinyago and the Yao people use the name Inyage. The woman's mask is made of a face mask and a body mask that indicates she is pregnant. This mask is worn in the Makonde dances that take place traditionally to celebrate the end of the young boys' initiation period.</page><page sequence="5">42 THE DRAMA REVIEW/T96 advanced and a deep level attained only by a few of the elders who carry out the highest religious functions. The triangle is one of the most commonly seen geometric motifs. It can have the following meanings: 1) in superficial knowledge, it is usually called the "footprint of the Koba" or the "trail of the Koba (hippotrague or antelope-horse)"; 2) in intermediate knowl- edge, it symbolizes "male sex," "male element"; triangular objects are masculine, as is the number "three"; 3) in deep knowledge, it is the "rhombus," "the civilizing demiurge" (the Bwa refer to it as Do, the Dogons as Nommo, the Kurumba as Yirige). The rhombus, sent to man by the sky god, is the most sacred hierophant of the civilizing spirit. It is a piece of sheet iron, triangular or slightly ovoid, which is made to twirl and vibrate by turning it rapidly on the end of a rope. This produces a humming sound which represents the word of the Demiurge transmitted through the voice of the mask. On masks, the basic geometric signs are used to create signifying combinations of which the variety and complexity are enriched by the use of color and number. Geometric signs are used in series according to a fixed code which regulates the order and the colors. Meaning of Numbers Three: 1) Number related to men 2) Male sex 3) Life-giving power Four: 1) Number related to women 2) Female sex 3) Fertilized element Simple numbers are combined to create more complex figures: Seven (3 + 4): 1) Union of male and female elements 2) The fecundity of man, the fertility of fields, the harmony of the cosmos 3) Taboo number of the civilizing demiurge believed to be bisexual, androgynous Nine (3 x 3): 1) Abundance of masculine strength 2) Supreme religious power 3) Taboo number of the sky god believed to be the creator and ruler of all things An example of meanings associated with the color red: 1) Blood, strength, life 2) Vital forces which animate the cosmos 3) Taboo color of the civilizing demiurge; the use of red, particularly in clothing, is very strictly controlled It should be noted that the different levels of meaning of one sign are complementary, not exclusive. For the color red, for instance, blood is the best conveyor of vital forces which the demiurge possesses in the highest degree. In addition, close correspondences exist between the three categories of signs-geometric shapes, colors, and numbers.

The masks are carved out of wood and the artists vie with each other to create the most beautiful designs. Some designs are kept secret by specific tribes. This mask is that of Mwamapwebo, a spirited young woman who symbolizes the feminine powers of resistance and survival. example, the number seven and the color red have the same value; they are symbols of fertility/fecundity, vital forces, and the civilizing demiurge. Vertical and horizontal cor- respondences between these signs creates a multidimensional language which is both complex and harmonious. The designs are the most secret part of the masks as they lend the masks their power. By imposing this strict code of geometric shapes on cosmic and everyday reality, the masks establish themselves as an organizing force. They emulate the deeds of the demiurge who brought civilization to men and taught them how to control nature through cultivation. The masks examine daily reality and in recreating it, they gain control of life-giving cosmic forces. To study masks as fixed signs composed of a number of codified elements, however, does not do justice to their deep significance. This store of shapes and designs is common to the many different ethnic populations who live in the higher Voltaic valleys. Each community uses and interprets the signs in accordance with its own needs and its own conditions. The sign retains its mystery; a complete understanding of it depends upon an intimate, initiatory knowledge of the people using it. Although they draw from the same foundation, all masks are completely original. Dudulsi, a small Gurunsi village in Lela, offers one example of how different groups incorporate the masks into the life of their community. The village was first settled by the Bazie family. The patriarch of this group now heads the cult of the earth and also functions</page><page sequence="7">44 THE DRAMA REVIEW/T96 as the leading costume-maker. His authority, however, is only nominal, as the three family groups which make up the village community lead relatively autonomous lives. Each family inhabits its respective territory under the direction of an elder who is responsible for the family's ancestral cult. Only the mask society is able to integrate and harmonize the centrifugal forces at the heart of this village community. The nine members of the mask society are elected from the elders of the three families. The masks are simple in form, zoomorphic, covered in multicolored geometric designs and completed by a black costume made of baobab fibers. They appear in the following order: antelope, cayman, snake, lion, hornbill, cock, ram, buffalo, and hyena. The zoomorphic masks are widely used and not exceptional, but their choice is not arbitrary; it stems from a desire to integrate past experience and present problems into a reassuring, harmonious system. The first three masks relate to the founding of the village, the crucial circumstances on which the community's continued prosperity depends. The people relate, "Because of drought and famine our founding forefather was forced to leave his native land to find a more favorable place. A mysterious antelope led him to the top of a hill. From there, he saw a fertile valley situated between the hill and a flowing river where there were many, many caymans. The ancestor built his abode near a great baobab tree where a good spirit lived, who sometimes showed himself in the form of a serpent. This spirit presented the ancestor with three masks (antelope, cayman, serpent) and attached to them black fibers from the bark of the protective baobab-'the baobab of fecundity.' The spirit promised Initiation ceremony in Kuba, Zaire.</page><page sequence="8">AFRICA 45 that for as long as the village honored and respected the masks, the land would provide abundant grain and the women would bear many children." Related to the three masks-antelope, cayman, serpent-are three natural areas important in the village economy which justify its installation on this site: the hill, covered by an extensive holy forest, source of plants and game; the earth, fertile and cultivated; and the marigot, source of water and fish. There is an altar at each of these three places: on the hill, an altar of green bushes; an altar of fertile earth under the baobab of fecundity; and an altar of life-giving water on the banks of the marigot. These three sites have played an important part in the survival of the village, which is situated near a frontier and continually threatened by marauding border troops. In the past, the river-cayman consti- tuted a natural defense against incursions, and watchmen were always on alert. In case of danger the villagers fled to the hill-antelope; those who were unable to run away hid in the baobab-serpent tree which had a hollow trunk large and comfortable enough to shelter twenty people. All the village activities, cultural and economic, follow this ternary movement which, since the community's foundation, has guaranteed prosperity and pro- vided a continually reassuring structure. The village, then, is made of three clans; any stranger who comes to live there has to become part of one of them. In reference to this threefold structure, six more masks were created and added to the three principal masks to make a group of nine (3 x 3). In actuality, these six masks are three pairs with com- plementary elements. The lion is a totemic mask which inspires great fear. When hunting, the lion kills any animal that crosses its path. It plays an important part in the initiation ceremonies. The young initiate must fight with the lion and, as a reward for his victory over himself and over the animal, he is told the true nature of the masks. In contrast to the lion, the hyena's pranks accentuate and humanize the religious aspect of the ceremony. In the second pair of masks, the hornbill functions as guardian of the secrets of prediction and the buffalo reveals the mysteries of making magic. The final pair is the cock and the ram, prized as intermediaries between man and cosmic forces, and generally preferred as sacrificial victims. In the village of Dudulsi all the rituals have this ternary movement. The masks intervene in a man's life three times: during initiation when the adolescent enters the adult community; during the funeral ceremonies of those who, after a long and fruitful life, have been called to rejoin the ancestral spirits (here, at the great festivities which take place at the end of the mourning period, the masks dance for three days for a man and four days for a woman); and finally, at the important yearly purification which takes place just before planting at the beginning of the rainy season (April-May). This is the most important mask ceremony-"the time of the masks." For nine days (3 x 3) the masks take over, and carry out their mission to chase away evil spirits and to purify the hearts of men. Once regen- erated, the community draws god's blessings upon itself as promised by the spirit-snake and as symbolized by abundant rains, the source of fertility for the land and for the women. By their continual reference to a rigid and coherent code, the masks coordinate human activities into a reassuring and balanced whole. The language of the shapes, the designs, the rhythms, and the colors, confirm the community's sense of reality and give it control over its own time and its own space. -</page></plain_text>
