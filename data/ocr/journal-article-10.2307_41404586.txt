<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK reMARKS A Personal View of I Current Juvenile Literature I I Ruth M. Stein I It may well be, as Graham Green said, that ". . . it is only in childhood that books have any deep influence on our lives." We certainly turn children into readers more easily during those "unreluctant years" than at any other period. The difficulty is not the lack of material, but the inability to exercise one's options intelligently, given the abundance of available choices. Books reviewed below should help those responsible for such selection. A plus (+) accompanies highly recom- mended books, while a minus (-) marks those to be avoided. Happy reading! 42</page><page sequence="2">Picture Story Books While I agree with Van Gogh's opinion that books, like art, should be beautiful, I feel that the ideas expressed are more important for young readers than the vis- ual manner such expression may take, even in books such as these, where graphics is at least as important as textual material. The Big Orange Splot by Daniel Manus Pinkwater. Hastings House, 1977. 32 pp. $5.95. When a seagull drops a can of orange paint on his neat house which looks like the other houses on the neat street, Mr. Plumbeam gets an idea that changes the entire neat neighborhood. Jaunty poster- paint drawings match the author's theme - "Our street is us and we are it" - in an unusual pitch for nonconformity. Young readers may marvel at some of the architectural wonders dreamed up in this humorous realistic fantasy. The Big Orange Splot - photo courtesy of Hastings House Everett Anderson's 1-2-3 by Lucille Clif- ton, ill. by Ann Grifalconi. Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1977. 32 pp. Reinforced binding, $5.50. In a continuing juvenile soap opera series, our young hero ponders the advan- tages and disadvantages of his mother's pending remarriage. "One can be lonely and One can be fun, and/Two can be awful or perfect for some, and/Three can be crowded or can be just right or/even too many, you have to decide." While the problem is real and the book "useful," the verses are not up to Clifton's standards. Expressive line drawings on either yellow or green wash enrich the story. For Everett Anderson's fans only. -i-The Happy Dromedary by Berniece Freschet, ill. by Glen Rounds. Chas. Scribner's Sons, 1977. 32 pp. Reinforced binding, $5.95. In the Kipling tradition Freschet spins a modern "pourquoi" tale. Millions of years ago when the camel first chose to live in the desert, her appearance was different. A Bert Lahrish-looking King of the Animals helped her change to meet the exigencies of desert living. When the other animals laughed at the camel's looks, the King found a remedy for that, too. Rounds' spir- ited purple and tan crayon drawings enli- ven a first-rate story for young readers. I Used To by Sonia O. Lisker. Four Winds Press, 1977. 32 pp. Reinforced binding, $5.95. Inspired by Milne's ". . . But now I am six, I'm as clever as clever./So I think I'll be six now for ever and ever," Lisker rem- inisces with a group of six-year-olds about what they "used to" do. Youngsters will recognize themselves among the children and animals who share their fears, thoughts, and misconceptions. "I used to say eyeblouse for eyebrows . . . Piz- zagettil" The story is told from the child's viewpoint, in dialogue and in the first per- son. The three-colored jacket with sleep- ing children and a kitten portend the book's delightful contents. Book reMarks 43</page><page sequence="3">Ivan, Divan, and Zariman by Marta Кос i. Parents' Magazine, 1977. 28 pp. $5.50. Ivan is a little boy from whose perspec- tive the story is told and illustrated. Divan, a couch that has seen better days, and Zariman the mouse live in the attic and play with Ivan, until his mother decides to clean out the house. Children will respond to this low-keyed story of friendship, told realistically in the present tense with much conversation. Rich watercolors re- flect the dark comfortable attic, especially the divan, against which Ivan and his bright tiny toys lean and play. +Jane, Wishing by Tobi Tobias, ill. by Trina Schart Hyman. Viking, 1977. 48 pp. Reinforced binding, $6.95. The same combination that gave us The Quitting Deal gives us another contem- porary situation about a dreamy young lady who wishes she looked different, had another name, and were endowed with some special talent. All of Jane's day- dreams are expressed in warm flower- bedecked pages in shades of rose, cop- per, and gold. Her interchanges with a loving, irritating, and practical family are illustrated by down-to-earth black/white drawings. Even the print differs in Jane's two worlds. In a satisfactory, honest end- ing, a basically happy child comes to terms with life, as her dream world and her real world merge. Middle-grade girls will smile ruefully at the dialogue. Jane, Wishing- photo courtesy of Viking Lester's Overnight by Kay Chorao. Dut- ton, 1977. 32 pp. Reinforced binding, $5.95. In her typical style, Chorao explores an important childhood incident - the first night away from home. She creates sym- pathy for Lester on two levels. First, Lester misses his home and parents while sleep- ing at Aunt Belle's. Secondly, he interprets his aunt's remarks literally, causing him temporary mental anguish. Soft pencil black/white illustrations lend a reassuring tone to a common experience. Perhaps a little more contrast is needed to dif- ferentiate the boy's real world from his im- aginary one. Look for the details in Aunt Belle's Victorian old-fashioned house. Lester's Overnight- photo courtesy of Dutton -Looking at Children by June Behren, ill. with art reproductions selected by Ber- nard Shapiro. Golden Gate Junior Books, Children's Press, 1977. 40 pp. Reinforced binding, $4.95. The second volume in the Adventure in Art series offers a gallery of children as depicted in thirteen full-size color repro- ductions spanning the centuries from the early bronze Thorn Puller in the fifth cen- tury B.C. to such modern examples as 44 Language Arts</page><page sequence="4">Picasso's Circus Family and John S. Cur- ry's Tornado. Clear prose conveys the creator's intent and the idea behind the picture. Still, some terms could have been explained, as "cast in bronze." A table of contents would be appropriate, as would a comment explaining the selection and arrangement of the pictures. An inconsis- tent style stresses media in some places and the story behind the picture in others. Not up to the artistic quality of the first volume in the series. Patch and the Strings by Karen B. Win- nick. Lippincott, 1977. 40 pp. Reinforced binding, $6.95. Patch the puppet wonders, " 'Where do my strings go?' " in a philosophical book for the primary grades applicable to a comparable human dilemma. Patch's in- vestigation leaves him confused and alienated from his friends, until a dream offers a solution. A graphically well- designed first book sets the story on a black/white stage, with the puppets in clear four colors. The puppet's dream and questionable final decision need more discussion than offered here. Patch and the Strings- photo courtesy of Lippincott +Simple Pictures Are Best by Nancy Willard, ill. by Tomie de Paola. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1977. 32 pp. $7.95. A poetic shoemaker and his artistic wife are being photographed for their wedding anniversary. With one thing and another, the couple keep adding items, despite the desperate photographer's admonition that "Simple pictures are best." James, the photographer's assistant, also plays an important role in a witty cumulative tale splendidly illustrated. Olive frames unite text and drawings, picking up the rich greens and roses of the illustrations. Easy-to-read Books Easiest to read books are usually those which are the best written. Current offer- ings don't always reach the standards set by Minarik's Little Bear. Neither do they plummet to the depths of the notorious Dick-and-Jane series. Detective Mole and the Secret Clues by Robert Quackenbush. Lothrop, Lee &amp; Shepard, 1977. 64 pp. $4.95. The bumbling detective is back in a "Fun-to-read" book, this time helping the Chicken family decipher secret clues that will permit it to inherit a rich uncle's es- tate. In trying to solve the mystery, middle grade readers can explore an old Victo- rian mansion whose rooms are detailed in blue and black/white cartoon-type draw- ings. "The Princess and the Pea" is one of the clues in the seven chapters of this most "fowl" case. A funny story. Monster Night at Grandma's House by Richard Peck, ill. by Don Freeman. Viking, 1977. 32 pp. Reinforced binding, $6.95. This time a spooky Victorian dwelling shows up in Peck's first book for younger readers, and the first to be illustrated. Daytime at Grandma's is fine for Toby, but bedtime is terrifying when a monster seems to be about. Toby pulls a switch on Book reMarks 45</page><page sequence="5">this universal experience when he de- cides to track down the monster. Written in narrative style with minimum conversation, the amusing tale reads well silently or aloud. Short words and sentences build suspense. Blue and black predominate in India ink scratchboard drawings done on a watercolor overlay. Illustrations really go along with Toby's nighttime fears. Monster Night at Grandma's House- photo courtesy of Viking +Mouse Soup by Arnold Lobel. Harper &amp; Row, 1977. 64 pp. $4.95. To keep from being made into soup for a weasel's meal, a mouse emulates Scherezade and convinces the weasel that " 'Mouse soup must be mixed with stories to make it taste really good.' " Four tales-within-a-tale make for a lively "I Can Read" book, a worthy companion to the author's Mouse Tales. Lobel proves sim- ple stories are not necessarily shallow, as he turns euphonious phrases and exhibits other literary skills easily overlooked. Soft-colored precise illustrations are framed into a unit with the large-size printed text. Mouse Soup - photo courtesy of Harper and Row The Sick Story by Linda Hirsch, ill. by John Wallner. Hastings House, 1977. 36 pp. $5.95. Although not strictly of the genre, Hirsch's first book for children will find a ready audience among inexperienced readers who have faced a return to school with mixed feelings. Miranda believes the only way to get over a cold is to be waited on hand and foot. She discovers "Being sick is very tiring." Her parents are wryly amusing, though a bit too indulgent. Miranda looks the same, well or sick, in framed black/white drawings. Teach Us, Amelia Bedelía by Peggy Parish, pictures by Lynn Sweat. Greenwil- low, 1977. 56 pp. $5.95. The popular heroine of six "Read-alone" books delights readers in her new role as a literal-minded substitute teacher for a day. Our wacky character calls the roll by opening up each lunch box and calling the rolls. For science each student is to plant a bulb, so guess what Amelia Be- delía has the class plant! We believe her when she says, "I do love children." And in return, they love her. Sweat's cartoon drawings animate a spirited text and per- petuate a well-known figure in her black pokebonnet and uniform, with its white apron, white collar, and white starched cuffs. 46 Language Arts</page><page sequence="6">Waza Wins at Windy Gulch by Eleanor Coerr, ¡II. by Janet McCaffery. G. P. Put- nam's Sons, 1977. 48 pp. Reinforced bind- ing, $4.99. Coerr based her story of Waza, the pure white camel in the Army's Camel Brigade, on contemporary newspaper reports from the 1850s, when two shiploads of camels were brought to Texas. The plot mainly concerns the ongoing feud between Waza and Dirtyshirt Dan, the chief mule driver. The minimum text is effective. Orange, brown, and white doublespread drawings picture the western locale. Knowing that Waza really lived adds zest to a funny in- cident. A "See and Read Storybook." Winter's Coming by Eve Bunting, ill. by Howard Knotts. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1977. unpaged. $1.65 (paper). A young brother and sister prepare for the coming winter, as three generations share in the pleasures and tasks of the changing seasons. Practically a picture book, evident care has been taken with text that verges on the poetic. " 'Four black crows mean four white snows!' Grandma says./Grandma knows." The au- thor drew on memories of cold Irish win- ters to write her cadenced tale. Full-page pen-and-ink doubl.espreads extend this "Let Me Read" book. Realistic Animals in Fact and Fiction Children probably read animal stories not only with a sense of sympathy, but also with an intuition that the fate of all animals - including human beings - are intertwined. As in other types of literature, the demarcation between fact and fiction in animal tales blurs in many cases. I have used anthropomorphism as my measure, labeling as fiction those stories which tend to humanize animals, even where in- formation reported is ostensibly objective. . . . fiction Dragon Defiant by Lynn Hall, ill. by Joseph Cellini. Follett, 1977. 96 pp. $4.95. The self-contained story brings to a close the true-life account of a famous mustang pony whose earlier travels were retold in A Horse Called Dragon and New Day for Dragon. Here, Dragon serves as a stud on a Michigan breeding farm belong- ing to crusty, middle-aged Wilda Ware, a character as unique as her name. Interest shifts gradually from the aging horse to the colts he sires. Strong portrayals of the indomitable Mrs. Ware, and Dragon's special friends - a dying blind horse and twelve-year-old Abby - make this more than a mere animal story. Hall pinpoints characters through their relationships with each other. A much-read author is sure to please with this, even propelling middle- grade readers to the first two books, which they may have missed. Dragon Defiant - photo courtesy of Follett The Fox at Drummers' Darkness by Joyce Stranger, ill. by William Geldart. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1977. 108 pp. $5.95. Drummers' Darkness, a desolate area, shelters a red fox as he lives out a stormy life. Four-years-old, ". . . long-legged, lean-flanked . . . underbelly flecked with cream and the long fur . . . arrogant cop- Book reMarks 47</page><page sequence="7">per red . . the animal ravages town and farm during a drought-ridden summer. A senile huntsman plans to hunt the fox in autumn, while the farmer sets his traps now, seeing the fox as a diabolical sym- bol. Tension mounts with temperature and thirst and explodes in an electrical storm, when animals and humans come together in a common peril. The author maintains a steady rhythm with short d words- drums, danger, drought, dust, and death. But an unsuccessful attempt to fuse many stories into one obscures the theme and conclu- sion. The artist uses white effectively in eight black/white cross-hatched drawings which clarify scenes and characters. Jeremy and the Gorillas by Lillian Gould, ill. by Joseph Cellini. Lothrop, Lee &amp; Shepard, 1977. 181 pp. $5.95. After fleeing his farm in Southwest Kenya during a Mau Mau uprising in which his father is killed, Jeremy Jenkins experiences many adventures, finally making his way to the Virunga Volcanoes in Uganda, where he is accepted by a troop of gorillas. Set in the turbulent days of colonial Africa, a gripping story of sur- vival and rite of passage staggers under the load of the author's concerns. "Origin of instinct and behavior, the causes of vio- lence, the process of learning, the signifi- cance of sexual differences, and much more . . ." slow down the action and create too many incidents which dilute the main stream - the relationship of J.J. to the gorillas and the role he undertakes in their defense. With a credibility quotient somewhere between Tarzan and Mowgli, J.J. absents himself long enough ". . . for his wrists to grow out of his jacket sleeves, his boots to pinch his feet, his hair to reach down his back . . . (and) to be cured of the sickness he had contracted from civilization." Six compelling pencil draw- ings show what can be done in black- and-white to convey emotion. +Mattie, The Story of a Hedgehog by G. D. Griffiths, ill. by Norman Adams. De- lacorte, 1977. 91 pp. $5.95. A reputable British author follows the long, full life of one hedgehog who re- sided in his English garden and became a family pet. Set in Devon, this Junior Liter- ary Guild selection evokes the lushness of the Dartmoor hills, where Mattie and her ilk struggle against human ignorance and pitiless natural forces. Without a trace of didacticism, youngsters get the feel for the natural history of a place through a poignant look at a hedgehog and her "owners." -The Mystery of Lincoln Detweiler and the Dog Who Barked Spanish by Jean Robinson, ill. by Gioia Giammenghi. Fol- lett, 1977. 123 pp. $5.95. Since the death of his parents, Line has been plagued by nightmares, turning him into a night person, resulting in poor rela- tions with school and family. Line recalls his twelfth birthday, when his uncle sur- prised him with a big, bumbling mutt smuggled into the country from Mexico. A self-styled kook, ". . . the only kid with enough problems to fill a Dear Abby col- umn," Line finds training the dog causes major changes in his life. The author's in- tended message has to do with the plight of nonconformists, but the real lesson is, "Never talk to strangers!" While amusing, the story falls short on plot, characteriza- tions, and credibility. Line's teaching the dog English commands, based on authen- tic techniques, holds the attention. Full- page black/white illustrations enhance a thin story. The Rain-Cloud Pony by Anne Eliot Crompton, ill. by Paul Frame. Holiday House, 1977. 127 pp. $5.95. Young Patty Dunfield narrates her own story about her life-long passion for horses. She is an easy mark for thirteen- 48 Language Arts</page><page sequence="8">year-old Angel Jason, who practically blackmails Patty into fooling Angel's par- ents by caring for Angel's rain-cloud pony, Bonny. The story ends realistically, as Patty learns, "It isn't what you have, it's what you love." Scenes of Bonny's foaling in a storm achieve dramatic heights through metaphoric, rather than explicit, description. Pen-and-ink drawings by a noted illustrator fit right in. +Summer of the White Goat by Paige Dixon, ill. by Grambs Miller. Atheneum, 1977. 105 pp. $5.95. For one summer a twelfth-grader ob- serves a mountain goat living within the boundaries of Glacier Park in Montana as his field work for an advanced biology class. Gordon Mohlen, all boy and embryo scientist, copes with his own survival and that of the nanny goat and kid to whom he has become attached. Tempos in writing vary, as the story switches between first and third person, contrasting Gordon's precise edited report on the tape recorder with his initial outpourings in sentence fragments and staccato phrases. The kid's maturation reflects that of the boy. Gordon fights illness, a storm, and non-working traps, ". . . all to get some information about a few crazy goats." The author adds a two-page summary of data on mountain goats and a bibliography of twelve items dating from 1904 to the seventies. . . . non-fiction Animal Travelers by David Swift. Green- willow, 1977. 56 pp. $5.95. One of the "Read-alone" series, the book describes the migrations of the caribou, barn swallow, painted lady but- terfly, and the gray whale. The story re- counts the journeys which are essential to the animals in their search for food. Al- though intriguing and informative, the simply written concepts may be too dif- ficult for the young reader attracted by the book's format. Three-colored drawings clarify some ideas. Repeating the same colors in the maps achieves an unclut- tered look and reduces confusion. + Biography of a Whooping Crane by Lorie Harris, ill. by Kazue Mizumura. G. B. Putnam's Sons, 1977. 64 pp. Reinforced binding, $4.97. The second "Nature Biography" on which author and artist have collaborated follows a year in the life of a family of whooping cranes from their summer home in Canada to their winter place in Texas. Drama is inherent in the protection of the eggs, the hatching of chicks, preparation for flight, and the 2500-mile journey. With the female's remating, the young crane is thrust out. ". . . Again and again her mother chased her away. At last the young crane understood. She would have to find her own food now." We leave her at the onset of a new year. Fine black/white il- lustrations complement a vivid picture of a nearly extinct North American bird. An "Author's Note" describes more fully sci- entists' experiments to preserve the wild flock of whooping cranes. The Hidden World: Life Under a Rock by Laurence Pringle. Macmillan, 1977. 64 pp. $6.95. The author of more than two-hundred children's books on biological and en- vironmental subjects provides a unique guide to the most common kinds of plants and animals in a hidden world that is so easy to explore. By writing in the present tense and using the second person, Pringle draws middle and upper-grade readers into a teeming cosmos under the rocks. "On land or underwater, the hidden world is an extraordinary place." Fine close-up photos alternating with black/ white drawings, a two page index, a bibli- ography for "Further Reading," and, most Book reMarks 4g</page><page sequence="9">of all, lucid writing spur readers to find and create their own special places. Owls. Newly revised edition by Herbert S. Zim, ill. by James G. Irving and Rene Mar- tin. Wm. Morrow, 1977. 64 pp. Reinforced binding, $4.59. Zim, one of the outstanding teachers and writers in the fields of science and science education, completely rewrote the book which first was published in 1950. His compendium of orderly writing follows the pattern of his other books, this time using metric measures, expanding the coverage to include owls found in other parts of the world, and adding recent data. Valuable as a reference tool, Owls can make more comprehensible myths found in such fiction as Garner's Owl Serv- ice and Yep's Child of the Owl. Diagrams, maps, and an index help in assimilating much fascinating information. Orangutan - Endangered Ape. Text and drawings by Aline Amon. Atheneum, 1977. 162 pp. $7.95. An account of one orangutan's life in the rain forest alternates with chapters con- taining factual and mythical information about these great apes. In the end, both streams converge to end on a dramatic note, as the author quotes, " 'What is man without the beasts? ... For whatever hap- pens to the beasts soon happens to man. All things are connected. . . ."' While the source material is formidable, one loses the link with the newborn orangutan and her mother amidst the free-flowing infor- mation which weaves in and out of the narrative. A list of experts in the field, the index, bibliography, and "Suggestions for Further Reading" increase the book's worth. +Sand Tiger Shark by Carol Carrick, ill. by Donald Carrick. A Clarion Book. Sea- bury, 1977. 32 pp. Reinforced binding, $6.95. The Carricks' treatment of the life cycle of a single tiger shark not only provides accurate biological information, it also gives a picture of what goes on under- neath the surface of a seemingly serene sea. One chilling description of an attack of "feeding frenzy," as sharks attack each other, depicts nature at its rawest. Pro- fusely illustrated with sea-green washes, the story shows both respect and under- standing for the inevitable demise of the old sea fish. Sounds of Animals at Night by Edward R. Ricciuti, ill. with photographs. Harper &amp; Row, 1977. 56 pp. $5.95. The former Curator of Publications of the New York Zoological Society writes au- thoritatively and with ease as he dis- cusses night birds, frogs and toads, in- sects, and mammals, and the sounds they make. He describes the urban and rural noises so that the reader can recognize them, telling what they mean and how they are produced. The book should inspire us to really listen and discover another world around us. A small, but meaty volume to keep on hand under the covers - with a flashlight, of course!
