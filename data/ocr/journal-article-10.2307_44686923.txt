Nowak and J. Ng Ford Motor Co. Copyright © 2000 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT While testing vehicles for crash, particularly the offset frontal crash mode, new devices and techniques are needed to enhance the ability to measure rotations of certain vehicle components and dummy parts (or joints). The reason for this new demand is that the capabilities of existing techniques or devices in measuring rotations of small masses in confined areas are limited. Examples of the desired measurements are the rotations of dummy's feet and tibias as well as the rotations of the vehicle's toe- board during intrusion. These measurements help to understand dummy's ankle loads as a result of different intrusion rates. Furthermore, having these measure- ments is very beneficial to the validation of the computer models used in simulating the behavior of dummy's lower extremities in high intrusion crashes. Recent research demonstrated the use of an angular rate sensor, based on magnetohydrodynamic principles, on Hybrid-Ill dummies and cadavers. Because of the sen- sor's compactness in size and light weight, it can be used in vehicle crash tests in areas where conventional mea- suring techniques such as high speed films is impractical. This report describes an experimental investigation of the capability of Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) Angular Rate Sensor (ARS) in measuring the ankle rotations during vehicle crash tests. It explains how the sensors were added to the dummy's feet and tibias and how they were used to identify the responses' characteristics of these segments during vehicle crashes. In addition, it dis- cusses an experimental approach of setting up simplified laboratory impact tests to assess the sensors capabili- ties. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to assess the capability of magnetohydrodynamic sensors in measuring ankle rota- tions of Hybrid-Ill dummy during vehicle crash tests. BACKGROUND ANKLE ROTATIONS AND MOMENTS - In offset barrier impact testing, relatively high dummy's ankle moments were observed in some vehicles (Zuby, 1995). Some researchers (Hobbs, 1991 and 1995) viewed this type of vehicle impact mode as representative of many real world accidents, where car occupants suffered injuries at feet and ankles. In some research papers (Frampton, Thomas, 1995), authors attributed the injuries to exces- sive toe-board intrusion, and one (Morgan, 1991) specu- lated different mechanisms as to how the injury occurred. Other research data, however, showed that injuries also occurred in vehicle crashes that had a negligible amount of intrusion (Thomas, 1995). A situation that is not consis- tent with previous explanations. The time-history of toe-board dynamic deformation (intru- sion), pedal movements, and kinematics of dummy's feet &amp; tibias during offset barrier crashes are important infor- mation for better understanding the inconsistency of cor- relation between ankle moments and intrusion. But means of measuring dynamic intrusions of the toe board are not available because of the lack of an appropriate device to measure rotations. Similarly, Hybrid-Ill lower extremities lack instrumentation to measure rotational movements because no measurement device was identi- fied as suitable. In fact, the only existing instrument near the foot- ankle area is a load cell at the lower end of the tibia as shown in Figure 1 . Yet the need of acquiring infor- mation is illustrated in the published paper by Sakurai (1996) where doors were removed to allow for camera installation and viewing the behavior of the dummy feet/ legs and the foot-well. Of course, only qualitative and subjective analysis of the motion of the toe-board relative to the feet were made by such arrangement. In addition, Sakurai resorted to the use of a three-axis linear acceler- ometers to get a qualitative behavior of the toe-board. He can only have the resultant value, since the instanta- neous directions were unknown when using this tech- nique. Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) adds 813</page><page sequence="2">triaxial accelerometers on dummy's feet during their crash testing as a way to learn more about the perfor- mance while evaluating intrusion effects. Other research- ers (Matsumoto, 1990) added accelerometers to Hybrid- Ill dummy (Figure 2) to help understand the behavior dur- ing crash testing. A more serious consequence of the lack of having mea- surements of the feet kinematics during offset high intru- sion crashes, is the current practice of using speculative information or assumptions regarding intrusion rates and their effect on the foot rotations. These assumptions, while in some cases violating laws of mechanics of the problem at hand, are used in validating models to repli- cate test results of ankle moments and forces. Thus, before investigating new methods of measuring rotations of dummy's feet and tibias, and also the vehi- cle's toe-board as it impacts the feet, limitations of exist- ing methods are reviewed. Figure 1 . Hybrid-Ill dummy only instrument near ankle joint, a transducer at the lower part of tibia Figure 2. Added accelerometers to Hybrid-Ill dummy to understand behavior (Matsumoto) METHODS OF MEASURING DYNAMIC ROTATIONS OF OBJECTS - It has been widely accepted to use acceler- ometer arrays and high speed cameras to measure rota- tions of objects during vehicle crash tests. Dummy's head is one example, and the vehicle powertrain is another example. Yet to measure the dynamic rotations of dummy's ankles during crash tests, these techniques are no longer applicable because the feet are positioned deep inside the foot-well. An array of accelerometers is not suitable for the feet because it requires a large mounting structure and adds mass to the foot. Both of these shortcomings can change the property of the foot. The high speed cameras are also difficult to use for the purpose of film analysis because they can not be posi- tioned at the right angles without major tear of the pri- mary body structural members. Rotational Potentiometer is another type of device which has been used to measure rotations of objects. However, it can only be used for planner rotations, i.e. where motion is fairly controlled. The set-up is difficult to connect the device to the dummy's ankle since the motion is in 3- dimensional space. Thus, to specifically measure the dummy's ankle rota- tions, different devices were used. For example, a goni- ometers (Figure 3) has been tried by Crandall (1994) for impact testing, although it is commonly used on volun- teers while walking. But published research on this device showed limitations and tendency to have errone- ous measurements when applied to the Hybrid-Ill dummy during vehicle crash tests, although it works well at low rates. However, Crandall (1994) disclosed the use of a new device which measured angular rates of ankle rotations in dummies and cadavers. The device is based on the magnetohydrodynamic principle and has the advantage of being small in size and weight, thus making it possible to easily package inside the dummy's feet or tibias with minimum change to the mass and inertial properties of these parts.

The device operation is based on the magnetohydrodynamic ( MHD) principle, and it is calibrated to measure the angular velocity of the rotating object in space. It is packaged in cube called "dynacube" as shown in Figure 4. Information about theory and operation of the MHD is briefly pre- sented by Biskamp (1997). Figure 4. MHD Angular rate sensor - the triaxial dynacube from Applied Technology Associates. The evaluation of this sensor has been the subject of sev- eral research studies, and most of them rated the device positively. Many of the evaluation tests were conducted to measure the rotations of Hybrid-Ill dummy's head during a controlled impact event and compare the results with those from other techniques. For example Willems and Knouse (1991) of the Naval Biodynamics Lab, showed very well agreement between the MHD and the results of an accelerometer array used inside the head. Similarly, Baughn et al. (1996) claimed that the MHD angular rate sensor was superior to other techniques, such as rota- tional potentiometers, accelerometer arrays methods and high speed films analyses, when measuring the angular velocity of a rigid body in three-dimensions. A third report published by Martin et al. (1997), where the MHD was evaluated in measuring rotation of dummy's head, indi- cating the advantage of the sensor as requiring only three channels to measure the rotational about the three axes. This is significantly less than requirements of the accelerometer array technique. A fourth study that also used a dummy's head in a pendu- lum impact test set up was conducted by Marshall and Guenther (1997). In this study, the head hit different objects such as honeycomb and steering wheel rim. The head rotations were measured by five different angular displacement measurement techniques, including two angular rate sensors. The study showed situations where the dynacubes can be inaccurate. As for specific publications which involved the feet and tibias, Klopp et al. (1995) claimed success in measuring ankle motion while testing the Advanced Lower Extremity (ALEX) dummy, developed by NHTSA. He used two dynacubes in his study. In addition, Crandall (1994) used two dynacubes to measure the rotations of ankle in human cadavers' legs. The measurements from the dynacube were confirmed with high speed video for a series of tests. APPROACH In this investigation, an experimental approach was used to check the function and capability of the MHD's in mea- suring the dummy's ankle rotations about three axes. However, since MHD sensors only measures angular velocities, a software package was needed to process the data and compute the rotations about global fixed axes.The package described by Klisch (1994) was selected for this study, since it was primarily developed for dummy's lower extremities research. In addition to having the software, two feet and tibias were modified to have MHD's installed for the experi- ments. The modified feet and tibias were incorporated to a standard instrumented dummy and run in a series of vehicle's offset barrier crash tests, and other simplified laboratory tests which will be described later in this report. Following the above preparations, three types of experi- ments were conducted: 1) Offset barrier crashes of vehi- cles with a driver's dummy that has MHD's at feet and tibias, 2) Simplified experiment of the MHD"s alone, 3) Simplified laboratory experiment in which an assembled one foot and one tibia was impacted by a simulated intru- sion pulse. Before presenting these tests, a complete base package used in a preliminary methodology devel- opment for application of MHD sensors in vehicle crash testing will be briefly reviewed. These include information about the selected configuration of the angular rate sen- sors, how they were packaged into the feet and tibias of Hybrid-Ill dummy, and the computer software used to determine rotations time-histories. PRELIMINARY METHODOLOGY OF ACQUIRING ROTAIONAL HISTORY OF DUMMY'S ANKLE USING THE ANGULAR RATE SENSORS Since different types and models of sensors produced by ATA, the specific one used in this study will be described. In addition, the data analysis package acquired from Uni- versity of Virginia (Klisch, 1994) that was initially used in developing this capability is reviewed. This review will be 815</page><page sequence="4">very useful in understanding the assumptions and limita- tions of the method. SENSOR CONFIGURATIONS AND DUMMY MODIFICATIONS - To check the function and capability of the MHD angular rate sensors to measure ankle rota- tions during vehicle crash tests, the dynacube shown in Figure 1 was selected. The device consists of three mag- netohydrodynamic angular rate sensors (model ARS-04) orthogonally packaged in a small cube. Electronics are fully encapsulated within a durable external aluminum cube, 1.25" on its side with a mounting base that is 1.6" long. Cable comes out of one of the faces and bends sharply. The dynacube weighs approximately 35 grams (1.2 oz.). In addition to measuring the angular velocities, the dynacube provides excellent base for bolting three linear accelerometers to three of its sides. This arrangement allows simultaneous measurement of accelerations in and the rotations in/along three directions. A very useful set of data that enables computing the position time-his- tory of any point on the foot or the tibia. To package the dynacubes in the Hybrid-Ill dummy's feet and tibias, these parts were modified as shown in Figure 5. The feet were the 45° ankle design with a soft stop, while the tibias were of the aluminum tubes design. An alternative packaging of the dynacube was designed as shown in Figure 6 to have the C.G and moment of iner- tias approximately the same as the feet without a dynacube. Figure 5. Packaging of Dynacubes inside Hybrid-Ill dummy's foot and tibia Prior to running any tests with these devices, the orienta- tion of the instrumented part (foot or tibia) was measured by the aid of an index plate (Figure 5) attached to the part and a special apparatus (Figure 7) designed by Univer- sity of Virginia. The orientation is measured in terms of the Euler angles '|/0, 90, &lt;Po associated with body axes which will be described in the computation section. Figure 6. Alternative package of a Dynacube inside Hybrid-Ill dummy's Foot Figure 7. Direct Eularian angle measurement apparatus - developed by University of Virginia Emotive Safety Laboratory. COMPUTATION PACKAGE - As mentioned earlier, the dynacubes measure the angular rates (angular veloci- ties) about three axes x, y, and z moving with the body (which can be either the foot or tibia in this paper). These are the components (to,,, a&gt;y, a^), shown in Figure 8 for the dummy foot, of the resultant angular velocity vector The angular velocity can be written in terms of three unit vectors êi, Sg, ěq along the x, y, z axes as: = C0X + (Oy ê2 + ®z Ê3 0) To determine the orientation of the dummy segments in space, the Euler angles method (Greenwood, 1965, p. 332-336) was used because of its simplicity over the direction cosine approach. By this method a rotating angular velocity vector (&amp;) in the rotating x,y,z coordi- nates can be expressed in terms of the time derivatives of the Euler angles vj/ , 0 and &lt;¡&gt; , the velocity vectors 816</page><page sequence="5">(Figure 9) associated with changes in corresponding Euler angles (Greenwood, 1965, p. 381): co = vj/ + 0 + &lt;j&gt; , From the above equations of the angular velocity vector (co), the components (cox, coy, coz) can be written in terms of Euler angles and their rates (See Greenwood, p. 381 ) as follows: cox = (1) - 'j/ sinö ©y = 6 cos cp + vj/ cos 0 sin &lt;p &lt;ùz= Yj/ cos 0 cos &lt;p - g sin &lt;p Figure 8. Axes and directions of angular velocities measured by the foot dynacube ¿,s Figure 9. Euler angle components of the angular velocity of the x,y,z axes (Greenwood, p. 381 ) Integration of the above equations of angular velocity components is performed by taking a very small incre- ment of time in each step, resulting in a very small incre- mental angles. This small increment is a result of a large sampling rate used in collecting data during impact and vehicle crash testing. With this small change in angle assumption, the integration is simplified. Assuming '|/0, 0O, cpo are the initial Euler angles of a body segment, then: J &lt;ox dt = J &lt;|&gt; at - J ( vj/ sin 0) dt = J &lt;f&gt; dt = 9o+(P 0) Similarly J coy = J 0 dt = 00 + 0 (t) and J = J vj/ dt = 90 +V(t) The above equations give a solution for the Euler angles of the body at each increment of time At. These angles are then used to compute a transformation matrix that is needed to determine the global components of angular velocity or position vectors. Expression for this matrix can be reviewed in Klish (1994) and Greenwood (1965, p. 335). Review of the above theory and other details in the men- tioned reference on computation package, it was appar- ent that some assumptions that were used and some steps that were eliminated may have some effect on the accuracy of the procedure. These assumptions raise some concerns as listed below: a. small angles assumption for simplicity of integration b. neglected the importance of sequence of rotation in space while constructing the transformation matrix. c. no steps were taken to regularly check and correct for accumulation of error at the elements of the trans- formation matrix and its orthogonality. d. technique of introducing an offset in the magnitude of the angles to avoid singularity near 90 degrees Although there were questions on the accuracy of the computation package, decision was made to continue using it without any change and assess its accuracy through this study. 817</page><page sequence="6">EXPERIMENTAL METHODS AND PROCEDURES Three types of tests were used in this study. The first was an offset barrier test of a vehicle that had a driver dummy with dynacubes on feet and tibias. One of the objectives of these tests was to collect characteristic information about the response of the feet and tibias from an actual vehicle test that has a relatively large toe-board intru- sion. The second test was performed to check the accu- racy of the dynacube in a simplified pendulum impact test that was easily controlled to move in a planar circular arc. Finally, to have foot and tibia kinematics that is represen- tative of that occurred in the vehicle, a simplified labora- tory test was conducted to impact a dummy's foot and leg assembly with a simulated vehicle intrusion pulse. Description of test set up and test results are discussed in this report. INSTRUMENTED LOWER EXTREMITIES IN VEHICLE OFFSET BARRIER CRASH TESTS - The response of the dummy's feet and ankle rotation time-histories from the time of vehicle impact with barrier to the time the tibia moment begins to rise is needed to understand the way the foot moves and the amount of energy that goes into it at the onset of the toeboard deformation (intrusion). So far the characteristic behavior of feet and tibias in actual barrier tests have not been published. Perhaps a reason for that is the inability to measure this response. There- fore, before conducting any experiments to evaluate the sensor, it was necessary to identify the characteristics of the response, particularly in tests with relatively high toe- board intrusion. Experimental Set-up - A Hybrid-Ill dummy that was instrumented with dynacubes at the feet and tibias (shown in Figure 5) was positioned in the driver's front occupant seat of a compact car. The car was prepared according to standard test procedure for 40% offset impact with a deformable barrier. Prior to testing, initial orientation of each tibia and foot was measured in terms of Euler angles using the apparatus developed by Univer- sity of Virginia (Hall, 1996) as shown in Figure 7. The angles are shown in Table 1 . Table 1 . Euler angles of the dummy's Feet and Tibias Dynacubes before offset barrier crash test of a compact vehicle Angles at Left Right Left Right initial position Tibia Tibia Foot Foot A- degrees 308 236 314 235 B - degrees 007 004 002 009 D - degrees 182 004 180 002 Offset Barrier Tests &amp; Results - Five crash tests were performed at 35 mph. The toe-board intrusions during these tests were between 8 inches to 1 0 inches, and the lower tibia indices were between 0.7 to 1 .36. The angular velocity data recorded by the dynacubes at the feet and tibias during these tests are shown in Figures 10 and 1 1 . Review of these figures shows that the foot angular rates were of combined motions about two and three axes, and with a component peaks up to 22007sec. On the other hand the tibia behavior was dominantly about y-axis with a peak of 1000 7sec. in one case to combined rotations in three directions at rates of 600-800° /sec. in another case. Analysis of the frequency content of these signals using power spectral density, showed the foot dominant frequencies were 2-10 Hz and the tibia frequency was less than 3 Hz. Figure 1 0. Angular velocity-time history of dummy's feet during a vehicle's offset impact test 818</page><page sequence="7">Figure 1 1 . Angular velocity-time history of dummy's tibias during a vehicle's offset impact test Using the computation package described earlier, the time-history of ankle rotations corresponding to the angu- lar velocities presented above were computed and shown in Figure 12. The figure shows clearly the com- bined three-axis rotations of the joint. In addition to this computation many other kinematic information about the foot or tibia can be provided for further analysis. This data would be very valuable in understanding the mechanics of ankle joint loads due to intrusion. Unfortunately, in vehicle crash testing as the one described above, it was not possible to acquire these measurements by another method for comparison. How- ever, with the aid of dynacubes, enough data were col- lected to assess their capability in a simplified experiment. Figure 12. Right and left ankle rotations during a vehicle offset barrier crash test PENDULUM TEST OF THE MHD ANGULAR RATE SENSOR - In this test the accuracy and function of dynacube is investigated using a controlled rotation of 45 to 50 degrees through a circular arc in one plane. Experimental Set-up &amp; Equipments - The Monterey impacting test machine (Figure 13) was used for testing the dynacubes. The machine has a piston that can be calibrated to impact an object at a desired initial speed. In this case the piston (Figure 15) hits one end of an arm that is made of aluminum and has a large cross-section for light weight while resisting deformation. At the lower end, the arm has a pin that can rotate freely into a bear- ing attached to the machine fixture. This allows the arm to move in a circular arc about the pin. 819</page><page sequence="8">Figure 1 3. The Monterey impact test machine with MHD's at the upper end of the arm Figure 14. Closer view of the MHD's on a base plate At the upper end of the arm a thick plate was bolted to serve as a base for mounting the dynacubes. Two dynacubes were bolted (Figure 14) to this base plate: one aligned to be in the same plane of rotation, and the other was positioned to have an inclination of 45 degrees with the global planes. The arm's angle of travel was controlled through crushing a block of honeycomb which was securely attached to the arm (Figure 16). The honeycomb was oriented to hit a surface of a steel block thus stopping the arm's motion. The honeycomb acts as an energy absorber to reduce ringing and vibration of the pendulum while rebounding after impact. Figure 1 5. The arm resting against the hitting piston during test Figure 1 6. The arm final position after impact In addition to measuring the angular rates of the pendu- lum arm by the dynacube, provisions were made to mea- sure rotation angles by high speed camera and a rotational potentiometer. For this purpose many tracking targets were placed on the system for film analysis: a) both dynacubes - at seismic mass of 3 accels, side &amp; top, b) near both dynacubes, c) pendulum pivot point, d) 3 tar- gets on the base of the mounting fixture, and e) target on head. As for the potentiometer, it was installed at the pivot point between the pin and the rotating arm. The initial position and coordinates of different points on this set-up were measured with respect to structural axes with the origin located at the midpoint of the pendulum pivot axis. The y-direction was established as the pivot axis positive to the right; z-plane was established as the 820</page><page sequence="9">facility fixture base surface positive upward; and x-direc- tion is defined as the cross product of the other two direc- tions in sequence. All coordinates of the entire experimental set-up were recorded. Dynamic Tests &amp; Results - Four pendulum impact tests were performed at an impact velocity of 12 mph at a total free travel angle of 45 degrees. However, the actual rota- tion of the arm was greater that 45 degrees because of the amount of the compression of the honeycomb while stopping the arm's movement. The four tests were identi- cal to ensure the repeatability of the collected data. Figure 1 7. Angular velocities about three-orthognal axes recoreded by a planer oriented dynacube Figure 18. Angular velocity about y-axis measured during four identical test The response of the dynacube about the three local and rotating axes x,y,z is shown in Figure 17 for one of the tests. From photos in this figure, it is seen that coy was the dominant response while the others are near zero, which confirms the plainer rotation of the arm. The angular velocity response (©y) from these four tests were well repeated as shown in Figure 18. It shows that the angular velocity (coy) peaked at 350 7sec. and then started to drift down at 40 milliseconds to 260 °/sec. at 145 millisec- onds. Also, results from film analysis and potentiometer methods are shown in Figure 19 and Figure 20. The results from both methods are in agreement. They are in terms of angles of rotations and show a maximum angle of 48 degrees which is consistent with the experimental set-up of a total angle of 45 degrees plus a 3 degrees accounted for the deformation of the impacted aluminum honeycomb block.

Angular displacement measured by film anlysis during four identical tests 821</page><page sequence="10">Figure 21 . Computed angular velocity from the rotational potentiometer results of tests Figure 22. Computed angular velocity from the film analysis results of tests To compare the angular velocity measured by the dynacube with that by other methods, the time histories of rotation angle measured by the rotational potentiome- ter and the film analysis were differentiated. The results are compared from the data in Figure 21 and Figure 22. Unlike the dynacube response, the other two methods show constant angular velocity after the initial rise. A plot showing the angular velocity results by dynacube and rotational potentiometer are given in Figure 23. This com- parison reveals the extent of drifting as an error in the dynacube response. Obviously, the error in angular velocity would cause an error in the angle of rotation. Thus, the rotation angles were compared, by Integrating the angular velocity his- tory from the Dynacube, with the rotations from the potentiometer method as shown in Figure 24. The figure shows that the integrated angular displacements from MHD only reach a maximum of 41 degrees while both film and potentiometer measured a maximum rotation of 48 degrees. Figure 23.

Comparison between angular displacement results by dynacube results and rotational potentiometer methods. 822</page><page sequence="11">Figure 25. The frequency content of the angular velocity response during the Monterey impact test Angular Sensor Problem &amp; Solution - ATA explained that the drift in the angular velocity response is due to the low frequency (&lt;100 HZ) content of the signal. A solution to this problem was to use a digital recursive filter, provided by ATA, to compensate the dynacube output (Laughlin, 1998). The frequency content of the signal was confirmed by using Fast Fourier Transfer "fft" (MATLAB, 199x). The Power Spectral Density (PSD) results are given in Figure 25, and show that all the data possess only low fre- quency components, lower than 3 HZ. These low fre- quencies verify the need to use of Frequency Response Function (FRF) filter to compensate the dynacube out- puts. Consequently, the raw dynacube data were pro- cessed through the digital filter with proper dynacube characteristic parameter with the results shown in Figure 26. This process corrected the angular velocity response of the dynacube and eliminated the drifting deficiency in the data. Furthermore, the corrected dynacube response was integrated to compute the rot ation angles. The results were in excellent agreement with the rotations measured by the potentiometer method as shown in Figure 27. To quantify the correctness of the dynacube measure- ments, differences in its angular displacement results were calculated relative to the rotational potentiometer results and shown in Figure 28. It indicates that compen- sated angular displacement results from MHD measure- ment agree with the potentiometer results within 4% for a duration of 180 milliseconds. Figure 26.

SIMPLIFIED IMPACT TEST OF MODIFIED DUMMY'S LEG AND FOOT -Another test method was developed to check the function and capability of the MHD's when they are attached to dummy's foot and leg. Also, when they are subjected to a vehicle's simulated toe-board intrusion environment. Thus, the test hardware was designed to combine translation and rotation of a foot plate (sometimes it would be referred to as pedestal) at a sufficient rate to produce foot/leg loads close to loads recorded during offset barrier tests of a compact car. With this set-up, it was possible to use film analysis method to measure the foot and leg rotations as an alter- native way to check the accuracy of the MHD methodol- ogy. In addition, tibia rotations were computed using accelerometer technique. Experimental Set-up &amp; Equipments - The test set-up was nearly similar to the concept described by Crandall (1994), except for actuation of the motion and method of rotating the foot pedestal. The Bendix impact machine at Ford's Safety Components Laboratory was used for this test. The machine has a piston that is driven by a hydrau- lic system accumulator which is calibrated to give a desired speed and energy of impact. As the piston accel- erates and travels in the longitudinal direction, it impacts a sliding carriage that is attached to a toe-board like structure (Figure 29, Figure 30). The acceleration- time history (i.e. intrusion pulse) of this sliding carriage was adjusted to produce a pulse similar to that occurs in the vehicle. This adjustment was easily made by inserting a honeycomb block of a certain density, size, and shape between the piston and the sliding carriage. During the test the piston crushes the honeycomb and thus gives the desired history of motion at the carriage. An example of the block before and after crush is shown in Figure 31 , and the corresponding acceleration, velocity and dis- placement time-histories are given in Figure 32. The toe-board like structure was designed (Figure 30, Figure 33) from plates with pivots and links in order to simulate the vehicle's intrusion. It consisted of a foot plate that was translated through the pivot (C1) by the sliding carriage of the machine. The foot-plate also rotated about pivot (C2) as it translated because of the tie rod connect- ing the hinges at points (C2)and (C3.) Angle of rotation caused by the translation at point (C1) is given in Figure 34. Figure 29.

Set up before and after impact To measure the loads transferred to the foot-plate during impact, a six-elements load cell was attached to the machine sliding rod to measure forces and moments in the three directions. As for the translation input to the foot plate a tri-axial accelerometer was placed at point(G) in Figure 30. Other load cells (four triaxial) were placed under the foot plate to measure the normal and tangential loads on the plate as it rotates. These load cells mea- sured the direct input loads to the foot and tibia during the test. The reaction load at the pelvis was also monitored through another load cell shown at point (A) in Figure 36. In addition to load cells and accelerometers, many tar- gets were placed on the intrusion simulation fixture to capture the displacement of many points through film analysis (Figure 37). 827</page><page sequence="16">Figure 35. Positioning the dummy's lower extremities on foot plate with pinned joint at H-point A Hybrid-Ill dummy foot with a shoe, leg (with a 45 degrees ankle movement, but without any modification for a soft stop) was used for this experiment. The leg has the knee and part of the femur connected to it (Figure 36, left). But to bring the configuration to H-point, a tubular extension (Figure 36, right) was designed with a pin joint attached to a fixed fixture. Both the foot and tibia seg- ments were equipped with MHD's as shown in Figure 30. The set-up was designed such that the foot rests on the foot plate on an angle similar to the foot position in the car and the pin at end of pelvis will be representative of the H- point position. The initial orientations in terms of Euler angles of the foot and tibia were measured before each test using the instrument described earlier. The angles are given in Table 2. Figure 36.

Through these tests, the foot and tibia trans- lated and rotated with the foot plate until a time where the foot separated from the pedestal. After reaching a certain travel, they rebounded downward and hit a catching plate. The rebound motion was severe and it is unlikely that similar movement would occur during actual vehicle tests. Therefore, the response during this phase will be neglected in this study, and analysis of the data will be limited to only the period from zero to 75 msec. A typical foot and tibia responses from these tests are shown in Figure 38 and Figure 39. Review of these responses showed that the rotations of the foot was primarily a combined rotation about the three moving axes of the foot (Figure 8). In addition, the foot rotations reached a maximum of 1400 deg./sec. in dorsiflexion mode (as will be identified later). In contrast, the tibia movement was dominantly in one plane with rotations were about the lateral axis (y-axis in Figure 5). The maximum angular velocity about that axis was 1 500 deg./sec. This data shows that the test was short in pro- ducing combined rotations recorded during the vehicle crash tests. Also, the ankle moments were not as high as the vehicle test because the foot separated from the ped- estal during the test. The lower tibia moments recorded in these tests were (0.56) of the maximum allowed moment of 225 Nm compared with average ratio of 1.14 for the right tibia and 0.75 for the left tibia occurred during the vehicle crash tests. Nevertheless, there was enough information from these tests to check the capability and function of the MHD's in measuring ankle rotations. Therefore, the dynacubes angular velocity data were pro- cessed through the computation package and the rota- tions at the ankles as well as the rotations of the foot and tibia were printed and given in Figures 40, 41 , and 42. The results show a dorsiflexion angle of 53° reached in these tests combined with some inversion that was as high as 23° at some point in time. This compared with ankle rotation in the vehicle crash test of 51° of dorsiflex- ion combined with as much as 25° of inversion. 828</page><page sequence="17">Figure 37.

There- fore, these results on leg and foot rotations were com- pared with the angles computed by film analysis method. The results were also compared with computed rotation about a lateral axis using different integration package (GPP). These are shown in Figure 43 and Figure 44, and some observations can be made from these figures as follows: 1. The maximum angle of foot rotation from film analy- sis was 26° as compared with 23° computed from ay In addition, The leg maximum angle of rotation from film analysis was 66° as compared with 61° com- puted from c0y taken at 70 msec. 2. Comparing the computed change of angle by direct integration of a&gt;y with results of computation package described earlier in this report indicates that both methods give the same answer 23° for the foot and 61° for the tibia. These angles were easily calculated using data in Table 2 and Figure 41 for the foot (74- 51= 23), and Table 2 with Figure 42 for the leg (50+1 1 = 61 @ 70 msec) The above observations raise some issues regarding the correctness of getting rotations by the dynacube method. These issues may be due to the device, or computation. Figure 43. Foot rotation about y-axis computed by integration of coy and by film analysis methods Figure 44. Tibia rotation about y-axis computed by integration of a&gt;y and by film analysis methods Analysis &amp; Discussion - To determine the source of the discrepancy between film analysis and dynacube meth- ods, the effect of the digital filter, discovered during the Monterey pendulum test discussed before, was investi- gated. For this purpose, the dynacube (oy signal was pro- cessed through the digital filter then integrated to compute the change in angle. The results are given in Figure 45 and in Figure 46 for the foot and leg respec- tively. Review of these figures and focusing only on the data between 0 - 70 msec, shows that filtering the foot response (Figure 45) caused a negligible effect on the rotation. This is because unfiltered and the filtered (com- pensated) curves are coincident, and the results are the same as those in Figure 43. However, the effect of the compensation filter caused substantial improvement of tibia rotations (Figure 46). Here, the compensation filter had the effect of shifting the angles to be approximately the same as the angles computed by the film analysis method. The successful application of the dynacube to the leg, in the Bendix tests, while similar success can't be claimed for the foot rotation can be explained by reviewing the angular velocities changes. Figures 47 and 48 show the angular velocity responses before and after running the data through the compensation filter for the leg and foot. The figures also show the computed angular velocity from the film analysis results. The frequency contents of 831</page><page sequence="20">these signals were also analyzed and shown in Figures 49 and 50. By close examination of these figures, the tibia response is shown to be dominantly about one axis, the lateral, and frequency is very low. This contrasts the foot response which is shown to have dominant frequen- cies in all three direction, although the lateral remained to have the largest power spectral density. This suggests that for complex combined rotations about three axes there may be a flaw in the methodology at either the com- pensation filter or the computational package, as mani- fested in the discrepancy between dynacube lateral angular velocity and computed angular velocity by film analysis (Figure 48).

Low frequency of the foot angular velocity response, dominant in all three directions SUMMARY A package was put together to utilize the Triaxial dynacubes for measuring the angular velocity and com- pute rotations of dummy's feet and legs. Three experi- mental procedures were used to asses the capability and function of this package. Findings from these experi- ments are summarized as follows: 1 . The response of the dummy's feet, legs, and ankles during offset barrier crash of a compact vehicle is characterized to be of low frequency that is less than 10HZ. The feet angular rates were as high as 2200 deg/sec, and the motion was dominantly about the three axes. The angular rates for the tibia were less than that for the feet. 2. The dynacube has a flaw of drifting when encounter- ing a direct current type signal as was observed in simple one axis rotation experiment (Monterey pen- dulum tests). This flaw was remedied by using a digi- tal frequency compensation filter. In rotations about one axis, as was the case in the Monterey experi- ment, the dynacube can be within 4% accuracy rela- tive to potentiometer technique. 3. The response of the foot and leg in a simulated intru- sion in a laboratory test confirmed the adequacy and capability of the dynacube when the motion is mainly about one axis. However, for combined three-axis rotations, the results are not satisfactory. CONCLUSIONS The dynacube provides improved methodology when the rotations are mainly about one axis and processing the data through a digital compensation filter. However for combined rotations which are significant in three direc- tions, further development is desired.
