<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some Neglected Aspects of Medieval Muslim Polemics against Christianity* Hava Lazarus-Yafeh The Hebrew University of Jerusalem M /uslim medieval authors were fascinated with religious issues, as the corpus of Arabic literature clearly shows. They were extremely curi- ous about other religions and made intense efforts to describe and under- stand them. A special brand of Arabic literature-the Milal wa-Nihal ("Religions and Sects") heresiographies-dealt extensively with different sects and theological groups within Islam as well as with other religions and denominations: pagan, Zoroastrian, Jewish, Christian, Hindu, and oth- ers. Of course, most of the heresiographies were written in a polemical tone (sometimes a harsh one, like that of the eleventh-century Spaniard Ibn Hazm's: Al-Fasl fi-l-Milal wa-l-Ahwa wa-l-Nihal ["Discerning between Religions, Ideologies, and Sects"]),' but some come close to being objec- tive, scholarly descriptions of other religions (for example, Al-Shahrastani's Milal wa-Nihal book from the twelfth century).2 *An earlier version of this article was presented at a colloquium on "Jews, Muslims, and Christians in the Middle Ages" held at Princeton University in April 1994 and in a lecture at Harvard University in May 1994.

The adherents of these two religions (called People of the Book in Islamic sources), along with some other smaller monotheistic or pseudo-monotheistic groups, like the Samaritans and Sabians, were considered protected people, and were granted personal safety and the freedom to practice their respective reli- gions (albeit not too conspicuously) in return for their adherence to a long list of restrictive and humiliating laws, termed the "Pact of 'Umar." In spite of this pact, Islam was a tolerant civilization, especially during its first five centuries; like other people, Jews and Christians could live where they chose, practice any occupation (unlike Jews in Christian medieval Europe), and have daily contact with their Muslim and other neighbors.3 In fact, the pluralistic nature of medieval Muslim society created a measure of open- mindedness among Muslims and provided a convenient setting for personal encounters and theological discussions between followers of different reli- gions and sects. Some of these discussions are described in detail in liter- ary compilations and seem to echo actual encounters, the like of which are mentioned by Muslim historiographers as well as in Jewish Geniza mate- rial.4 In spite of the evolving orthodoxy of Sunni Islam after the tenth century, religious curiosity did not wane. Muslim authors asked non-Mus- lims for information about their beliefs and scriptures, and Qur'anic verses were often compared to alleged or actual biblical verses with the similari- ties being pointed out-not always in a polemic manner. Members of dif- ferent sects and religions participated in discussions where tenets of belief were analyzed rationally in a relatively free intellectual atmosphere. Islam, of course, always had the last word, and it was always dangerous, indeed strictly forbidden, to express any criticism of Muhammad and the Qur'an; yet these discussions were different from the later court-enforced disputa- tions between Jews and Christians in medieval Europe.s B Muslim Polemical Arguments against Both Judaism and Christianity Arguments about Judaism and Christianity in such discussions and in Arabic medieval literature in general may be divided into two groups: one 3For a detailed discussion of the medieval history of Jews under Islamic rule and a com- parison with their history in Europe, see Marc R.

There are no separate arguments against the Jewish religion as such, although one does find many derogatory remarks about the stubbornness and untrustworthiness of Jews, as well as about such topics as Jewish prayer and dietary laws.6 The affin- ity between Judaism and Islam as the two strictly monotheistic religions of halakhic law, however, left little space for specific theological disagree- ment between the two religions, except for the Jewish rejection of Muhammad as a prophet, which Muslim authors connected with the Jews' earlier rejection of Jesus. In contrast, Muslim authors could neither accept nor understand the dogmas of Christianity, which they viewed with greater suspicion than those of Judaism. Muslim authors sometimes even depicted Christianity as being a false, concocted opposite of Judaism: And they [the Christians] saw that the Jews believed Jesus was a mad magician [sahir, madjnun] and a bastard, so they said: "He is God perfect and the son of God"; and they saw that all the Jews were being circumcised so they dropped circumcision completely; and they noted that the Jews exaggerated the laws of purification, so they abandoned them altogether; and they saw the Jews refraining from eating or touch- ing and sleeping with a menstruating woman-so they permitted to sleep with her; and they took notice of their prohibition of [the meat of] swines, so they made it lawful food and even started to regard it as the symbol [shi'Pr] of their religion; and they saw them refraining from much of slaughtered meat and [many] animals, so they made it lawful [to eat] everything that is smaller than an elephant even unto a mosquito [ma duna-l-fil ild-l-ba'uda] and said: "just eat what you wish and leave what you wish-no objection"; and they saw the Jews facing Jerusalem in their prayer, so they started facing the east. .. and they saw them keep the Sabbath, so they chose Sunday, and desecrated the Sabbath, although they admitted that the Messiah [al-masih] glorified the Sabbath and kept [its laws].7 The central argument of Muslim medieval polemicists targeted both Jews and Christians. Thus, for example, the argument of naskh, abrogation or supersession of earlier religions, is repeatedly found in Muslim sources aimed at both Judaism and Christianity. This well-known motif stems from 6See George Vajda, "Juifs et Musulmans selon le Hadit," JA 229 (1937) 57-137; and compare, as an example of later literature, Samau'al Al-Maghribi, If. am al-Yahud ("Silencing the Jews") (ed. and trans.

This is part of the Muslim argument of tahrif-falsification of the scriptures-with which Muslim authors re- peatedly charged both Jews and Christians. During and after the Crusades it seems to have been directed especially against Christians, as in this quotation.</page><page sequence="4">64 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW late antiquity and also appears in Christian polemical writing against Juda- ism. Muslim authors accepted the Christian argument that Christianity ab- rogated Judaism through God's preordained decree, but argued that Islam, containing God's final dispensation for mankind, later abrogated both Juda- ism and Christianity.8 More central was the Muslim argument of tahrif: the accusation that both Jews and Christians had falsified their respective divine scriptures and traditions. This motif was commonly used in pre-Islamic times by pagan, Samaritan, and Christian authors in order to discredit their opponents and their scriptures, especially the Hebrew Bible.9 In the Qur'an it becomes a central theme, used mainly to explain away contradictions between the Bible and the Qur'an and establish that the coming of Muhammad and the rise of Islam had indeed been predicted in the lost, uncorrupted, "true" Bible: And some truly are there among them who twist the scriptures with their tongues in order that you may suppose it to be from scripture, yet it is not from the scriptures and they say, "This is from God" yet it is not from God and they utter a lie against God and know that they do so. [3:78] Therefore woe be unto those who write the scripture with their hands and then say, "This is from Allah," that they may purchase a small gain therewith. Woe unto them for that their hands have written and woe unto them for that they earn thereby. [2:79]10 Jews and Christians were accused of having concealed, deleted, dis- torted, or rewritten verses from their scriptures. Jewish oral tradition, seen as an unauthorized addition to scripture, was also considered to be part of this falsification, as were the Gospels, which Muslim authors took to be later Greek inexact "translation" of the "original" Hebrew Gospels. Following the Qur'an (for example 5:75), Muslim authors believed both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament to be divine revelations, but never considered the actual texts of both sacred. This ambiguity created a 8See a detailed discussion of naskh in Camilla Adang, Muslim Writers on Judaism and the Bible from Ibn Rabban to Ibn Hazm (Nijmegen: Proefschrift Katholieke Universiteit, 1993) 141-65; compare also Lazarus-Yafeh, Intertwined Worlds, 35-41. 9See ibid., 19-35.

While Chris- tians usually accepted the holiness of the Old Testament but accused Jews of misunderstanding and misinterpreting it, reading it in too literal a way (the "letter" as against the "spirit"), Muslim authors subjected the biblical text itself to polemical scrutiny. In the first case, a commonly shared divine text is differently expounded; in the second, the text itself and its transmis- sion are studied and refuted. Some Muslim authors set out to prove the falsification of the biblical text and its unreliable transmission in an almost scientific manner, using both higher and textual criticism. They utilized pre-Islamic, rabbinic, Christian, anti-Christian, Gnostic, and other material. They pointed out chronological and geographical inaccuracies in the He- brew Bible, contradictions between the four Gospels, and seeming theologi- cal impossibilities, such as the anthropomorphic language of the Bible or the attribution of sins to the Patriarchs (who are considered to be prophets in Islam and thus immune to sin) and other prophets. In this context, a special recurring Marcionite-like theme the Muslim authors employed against the Pentateuch is doubt about stories of fornication and whoredom inserted into the most important genealogies of the Bible, for example, Lot and his daughters, Yehuda and Tamar, and David and Bat-Sheva. Muslim authors denied the divine origin of such stories and accused Ezra ('Uzayr) the "Scribe" of interpolating them into the divine text.11 This kind of polemical literature in Arabic flourished especially between the eleventh century (starting with Ibn Hazm in Spain) and the fourteenth century (particularly with Ibn Taymiyya and Ibn Qayyim Al-Djawziyya in Syria).12 Muslim authors to this very day repeat the same arguments against both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament. In this way they not only maintained and thoroughly developed ancient pre-Islamic, antibiblical tra- ditions, but also transmitted them to Europe, where they may have helped to foster early modern biblical criticism.13 The motif of the biblical Ezra, whom some Muslim authors believed to have falsified and forged the Torah, when restoring the lost text, provides a good example of this phenom- enon.14 Ezra appears in this context in Justin Martyr's second-century (imagi- 'lSee Lazarus-Yafeh, Intertwined Worlds, 50-74 ("Ezra-Uzayr: The Metamorphosis of a Polemical Motif"). 12Ibn Taymiyya (d. 1328) was a Hanabalite doctor of Islamic law and a prolific author. His main work against Christianity is Al-Djawab al-Sahih li-man Baddala Din al-Masih ("The True Answer to those who Falsified the Religion of Jesus"). Ibn Qayyim al-Djawziyya (d. 1350) was his disciple and also wrote several books against Judaism and Christianity, among them Hidayat al-Haydra fi-l-Radd 'ala-l-Yahud wa-l-Nasara mentioned above in n. 7.

The heretical hero of this book, Menoccio (his real name was Domenico Scandella), says in one of his interrogations in 1583: "I believe that scripture was given by God, but was afterwards added to by men. . . parts of the Gospel are true and parts were made up by the Evangelists out of their heads, as we see in the passages that one tells in one way and one in another way."18 Menoccio was supposed to have possessed "an unidentified book that a witness sup- posed was the Koran,"19 translated in 1547 into Italian; several of his other heretical arguments could have been drawn indirectly from Muslim ("Turk- ish") sources. Such ideas may have helped to pave the way for early Eu- ropean biblical criticism. Oddly enough, the reverse is true for the Muslim world. Muslim schol- arly criticism of the Hebrew Bible and New Testament never brought about a corresponding study of the Qur'an. When European biblical criticism was brought to the Muslim East in the nineteenth century, it served only as additional corroberation of traditional polemical arguments about the falsi- fication and unreliability of the Hebrew Bible and New Testament.20 15Justinus Martyr: The Dialogue with Trypho (ed. and trans.

According to Ginzberg (ibid., 42), the Travels of Manderville (a spurious compilation probably composed in French in the fourteenth century, attributed to Sir John Manderville) and the Qur'an itself could have been the miller's sources of anti-Christian arguments. 19Ginzberg, The Cheese and the Worms, 30. 20See Christine Schirrmacher, Mit den Waffen des Gegners: Christlich-muslimische Kontroversen im 19. und 20.

In the Middle Ages, however, the greater bulk of interfaith polemic activity took place between Islam and Christianity, and a vast Muslim polemical literature exists in Arabic, with its counterparts in Ara- bic, Greek, Syriac, and Latin. This literature arose, of course, out of the political and military rivalry between Christianity and Islam, but it does deal specifically with their different concepts of monotheism, prophecy, and scripture. Each religion claimed to possess a universal truth and each attempted to convert the entire world, as it were, to its truth.2' Christians and Muslims were deeply convinced that they alone possessed the one and only true version of monotheism to the exclusion of all others, and they set out to prove it-mainly to their own believers-in tens, perhaps hundreds of books. Many Muslim medieval authors felt that they share nothing with Chris- tianity, not even the basic belief in one God. Some (like the Egyptian author Shihab al-Din al-Qarafi, d. 1285) saw Christianity's dogmas as un- belief (kufr); others (like the above-mentioned Ibn Hazm and Ibn Taymiyya) viewed it as paganism and polytheism (shirk).22 It was not lack of infor- mation that brought about these attitudes, nor misunderstanding. Muslim authors knew much more about Christianity than did their medieval Chris- tian counterparts in Europe about Islam.23 They possessed good knowledge of the three Eastern denominations (Jacobites, Nestorians, and Melkites) and understood the hairsplitting theological debates of the first ecumenical councils.24 Apparently they also had before them Arabic translations of the 2ISee Bernard Lewis, "The Other and the Enemy: Perception of Identity and Difference in Islam," in Bernard Lewis and Friedrich Niewohner, eds., Religionsgesprdche im Mittelalter (Wolfenbutteler Mittelalterstudien 4; Wiesbaden: Harassowitz, 1922) 371-82, esp. 375-76. I cannot, however, accept Lewis's remark about "the paucity of Islamic religious polemics against either Christians or Jews" (p. 375) and about "the lack of (Muslim) curiosity about Christianity" (p. 278). 22Muslim medieval authors usually designated both Jews and Christians as infidels (kafirun) although they were considered to be the People of the Book (Ahl al-Kitab) or the Protected People (Ahl al-Dhimma), unlike the pagan idolaters (mushrikan). See, for example, Abu Hamid Al-Ghazali (d. 1111), Faisal al-Tafriqa, baina-l-lsldm wa-l-Zandaqa ("How to Distinguish Clearly between Islam and Heresy") (ed. Muhammad M. Aba-l-'Ala; Cairo: Maktabat al- Djundi, n.d.) 128. Later Ottoman legal texts, however, often distinguish between the Jews and other infidels, including Christians. I am grateful to Prof. Bernard Lewis for this information. For details about Al-Qarafi's book see below n. 47. 23For knowledge of Islam in medieval Europe, see Norman Daniel, Islam and the West: The Making of an Image (1960; rev. ed.; Oxford: Oneworld, 1993). 24Muslim authors in general felt Arius and the Nestorians to be closest to the monotheism of Islam.</page><page sequence="8">68 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Gospels, although not of the Hebrew Bible.25 Much of their information came from Christian converts to Islam, some of whom were learned priests, physicians, and perhaps also high-ranking officials in the church (like the ninth-century Syrian cAll b. Rabban, the twelfth-century Egyptian [Coptic?] Pseudo Al-Ghazzali, and others).26 Of course, Muslim authors also misun- derstood many details, sometimes perhaps purposefully, equating, for ex- ample, the Trinity with tritheism-the belief in three Gods-or enumerating Mary (instead of the Holy Ghost) among the three.27 On the whole, how- ever, Christianity was viewed as a serious theological challenge, and Mus- lim authors wrestled for generations with concepts like the Trinity, incarnation, the crucifixion, and redemption. They rejected all out of a deep commitment to the idea of a totally transcendent, one-and-only God, as they understood it. Some may have felt there to be a basic dichotomy: while Christianity based itself on a clergy, monasticism, liturgy, music, icons, festivals and processions, symbols, and emotions, Islam was rational and equalitarian (with no clergy and everyone being equal before God). It was also puritan or spartan, avoiding festivals,28 music, icons, liturgy, and even visual symbols, dedicating itself to the endless pursuit of tawhid-the unity and transcendence of God. If we were we to find a place for Judaism in this bipolar model, it would be somewhere in between Christianity and Islam, although much closer to 25See Sidney H. Griffith, "The Monks of Palestine and the Growth of Christian Literature in Arabic," The Muslim World 78 (1988) 1-78; idem, "The Gospel in Arabic: An Inquiry into Its Appearance in the First Abbasid Century," OrChr 69 (1985) 126-67.

See, for example, Ibn Qayyim Al-Djawziyya, Hidayat Al-Haydrd, 191-92. 28See Hava Lazarus-Yafeh, Some Religious Aspects of Islam (Leiden: Brill, 1981) 38-47.</page><page sequence="9">HAVA LAZARUS-YAFEH 69 the latter, but perhaps less extreme in its monotheistic belief, allowing some festivals and religious symbols. It will come as no surprise, therefore, to find that Jewish authors from the ninth century on used Muslim argu- ments in their polemics against Christianity and even disseminated such arguments during the twelfth century from the world of Islam, especially Spain, to Europe (for example, Rabbi Ya'akov b. Reuben's Sefer Milhamot ha-Shem ["The Book of Wars of the Lord"] and Rabbi Joseph Kimhi's Sefer ha-Brit ["The Book of the Covenant"], both composed around 1170).29 If we consider that some motifs of Muslim anti-Christian polemics origi- nated in anti-Christian polemics of pre-Islamic Jewish origins (for example, the polemic against the cross), we have the chain of influences, coming full circle, as it were. Interestingly, anti-Christian arguments are very consistent in different kinds of Arabic literature.30 They are based on Qur'anic anti-Christian verses such as: "They surely disbelieve who say: 'Lo! Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary. . .' They surely disbelieve who say: 'Lo! Allah is the third of three,' when there is no God save the one God. . . The Messiah son of Mary, was no more than a messenger, messengers [the like of whom] had passed away before him" (5:72-75).31 The earliest Qur'anic anti-Christian quotations are to be found in the inscriptions of the Dome of the Rock, built in 691 in Jerusalem. For example: "In the name of Allah, the Benefi- cent, the Merciful. Say: 'He is Allah, the One. Allah the eternally Besought of all. He begetteth not nor was begotten. And there is none comparable to Him"' (112:1-3).32 These and other Qur'anic verses are quoted in Muslim polemical anti- Christian literature through the ages (up to contemporary times). The po- lemical arguments based upon them show few traces of actual historical events, or even differentiation by the geographical diversity of their authors 29This trend becomes clear in Daniel J. Lasker's work, although he does not explicitly point out the Muslim origins of the Jewish arguments against Christianity. See, for example, his The Jewish Critique of Christianity under Islam in the Middle Ages (PAAJR 57; New York: American Academy for Jewish Research, 1991) 121-52; and idem, "The Influence of Jewish-Christian Polemics under Islam on Jewish-Christian Polemics under Christianity" Pecamim 57 (1994) 4-16 [Hebrew].

The Crusades, for example, are seldom mentioned in this literature.33 Nev- ertheless, there can be little doubt that historical events influenced Muslim polemical literature. There is, for example, a rise in anti-Christian literature from the late twelfth century onward, reaching a peak in the late thirteenth century. This must have been caused by the Crusades, which-after some time34-awakened and intensified both Muslim religious self-awareness and anti-Christian feelings. The Mongol conquest of Baghdad in 1258 may have intensified this trend. For the next four decades, until some Mongol rulers accepted Islam in 1298, Christians in Syria and Iraq felt freer than even under Muslim rule to provoke Muslim feelings in various ways.35 The literature itself, however, includes few references to these events. r Some Lesser Known Arguments against Christianity Let us now turn to some other examples of Muslim arguments against Christianity only. Rather than discussing the more complicated arguments against the Trinity, incarnation, sonship, and other christological concepts, which were widely discussed in the Middle Ages,36 we shall focus on some 33There are a few Muslim polemicists who mention the Crusades; one is Abu-l-Baqa Salih b.

Muhammad Hasanayn; Cairo: Muktabat Wahba, 1988] 56), states that the Cru- saders "sent questions to the Muslims in order to test them."

One of the most interesting arguments against Christianity put forward by Muslim doctors of law stated that Christian law, "Christian halakha," as it were, is a later invention of priests and monks and not a God-ordained law given by a prophet, that is, Jesus. This argument is based upon the concept that every religion (like Judaism and Islam) has a law regulating people's lives in this world and preparing them for the world to come. There are no morality and values outside divine law, and laws created by people are no better-in some respects even worse-than having no law at all. Jesus,37 according to Muslim authors who follow pre-Islamic, Jewish- Christian arguments, did not annul Jewish law (he was circumcised, kept the Sabbath except when in danger, and so on) and even stated explicitly that he had not come to change it. According to them, however, Paul,38 the Gospel writers, and later corrupted priests changed Jesus' text, and "added and detracted, falsified, and forged" (zadu wa-naqqasu harrafa wa-baddali) not only the text of the Gospels but the very nature of Christianity itself, thus turning it into a totally different religion. They (the priests, qaslsun, which was perhaps meant to include also the church fathers) invented the sacraments (only some of which are mentioned in the Gospels), Christian ways of prayer, festivals, and so on. Muslim authors consider these inven- tions to be a grave sin, because through them humans put themselves in the place of God, the only true lawgiver. Written in the thirteenth or early fourteenth-century Spain, Al-Qurtubi's Information about the Corruption of and the Fantasies in the Christian Religion and a Clear Description of the Virtues of the Religion of Islam, with the Proof of the (True) Prophethood of our Prophet Muhammed (God's) Peace and Prayer upon Him is a case in point.39 In this book Al-Qurtubl 37According to the Qur'an, Jesus was a prophet and the uncorrupted Gospel was a divine revelation, like the true Torah and the Qur'an itself. 38As in early Jewish-Christian circles, Paul is for the Muslims the main suspect. (Muslims also tended to vilify Emperor Constantine, who is supposed to have introduced the cross.) According to Shlomo Pines, Muslim authors not only retained Jewish-Christian traditions, but preserved in Arabic translations of authentic early Jewish-Christian writings and incorpo- rated them into writings against Christianity. See, for example, Shlomo Pines, "The Jewish- Christians of the Early Centuries of Christianity According to a New Source," Proceedings of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities 2 (1966); idem, "Gospel Quotations and Cognate Topics in Abd al-Jabbar's Tathbit in Relation to Early Christian and Judeo-Christian Readings and Traditions," Jerusalem Studies in Arabic and Islam 9 (1987) 195-278; and idem, "Judeo-Christian Materials in an Arabic Jewish Treatise," PAAJR 35 (1967) 187-217, esp. 213. 39AI-l'lam bimd fi Din al-Nasdra min al-Fasdd wa-l-Awhdm wa-lzhdr Mahdsin Din al- Islam wa-lthbat Nubuwwat Nabiyyina Muhammad 'alayhi al-Saldt wal-Salam (ed.

He takes umbrage at the Eucharist, confes- sion, and priestly absolvence in the name of God: "We say unto them: 'Oh, you ignorant group of bishops, you priests who will have it their own way (mutahakkimun), are you lawgivers? are you the punishment of God? have you yourselves achieved his satisfaction?'"40 And: "We criticize them for making themselves into lawgivers and putting themselves in the place of God, to whom alone belongs authority and the constituting of a law. God does whatsoever he wishes and he decrees for humans as he sees fit. Even prophets do not make laws of themselves, but only deliver the law of God."41 In Islam, even prophets are only messengers to whom God revealed his will. They decree nothing and cannot constitute laws; this is all the more true of priests or laity. Islam does not grant human arbitration any weight. (Jewish and Muslim law, however, were not felt to be human inventions, as was canon law, because the rabbis and culama [Muslim doctors of law] based their deliberations on scripture and presented their halakhic decisions as being mere interpretations of scripture and divinely ordained law.) God's unlimited and unintelligible will decrees everything, and the complete sur- render to this will and law is Islam's dominant message. In fact, one may state that Islam is the most truly monotheistic of the three religions, perhaps trying to achieve the unattainable in this respect. This unbending monotheism, however, has complicated Islam's adjustment to modernity, as the writings of some contemporary fundamentalists show. Some still repeat the argument against Christian "law," applying it to Western democracy: "Islam limits [the right of] legislation to God alone according to what has [been revealed] in the Qur'an and the Sunna [prophetic tradi- tion], but democracy puts the right of legislation [in the hands of] the people and they can permit what they wish according to what the majority decides. . . and if the majority decide that sodomy [and wine] are permit- Geschichte der arabischen Literatur [2 vols. and 3 suppl. vols.; Leiden: Brill, 19371 suppl. 1. 737 n. 7 and Pines, "Gospel Quotation and Cognate Topics," 265 n. 42) identified this author with the Qur'anic exegete Shams Al-Din al-Qurtubi (d.1273). It is more plausible, however, to follow Al-Saqqa's suggestion (pp. 5-6) that the author (whose first name we do not know) died later, because he finished his book only in 1325, apparently answering a now lost Chris- tian polemic composed in 1280.

The Lord alone shall rule over you") or 1 Sam 8:7 ("For it is not you that they have rejected; it is Me that they have rejected as King").

And thou will find the nearest of them in affection to those who believe [to be] those who say: "Lo! We are Christians." That is because there are among them priests and monks (qaslsin wa-ruhban) and because they are not proud. (5:82) Muslim authors who grew up on equalitarian Islam, which like Judaism knows of no clergy, could understand neither the elevated status granted to senior clergy nor the monks' total withdrawal from everyday life. Whether they drew general conclusions from specific cases of corruption they wit- nessed is unclear. The clergy was most commonly denounced for selling absolutions, transgressing the laws they impose on others,45 ignorance, and self-serving use of excommunication. Sexual transgressions of both priests and monks was mentioned along with statements that sexual abstinence (and even monogamy) is indeed an impossible demand.46 Priests who trick their parishioners into believing in fraudulent miracles are most frequently mentioned.47 In his introduction to his comprehensive book about and against 42See Rifat Sayyid Ahmad, ed., Al-Nabi al-Musallah ("The Armed Prophet") (2 vols.; London: Riad El-Rayyes, 1991) 1. 40 [Arabic] (the book includes material from documents issued by the Egyptian militant group Al-Djihad Al-Islami).

The miracles' ubiq- uity is related to the wisdespread belief in Christianity in the efficacy of images and icons, which, of course, predates Islam and iconoclasm. See Ernst Kitzinger, "The Cult of Images in the Age before Iconoclasm," DOP 8 (1954) 83-150.</page><page sequence="14">74 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW Christianity, Al-Qarafi enumerates some examples.48 After denouncing the bishops' belief that they are divine and control people's eternal happiness or doom, he accuses them of engaging in promiscuity, accepting bribes, and inventing miracles in order to strengthen people's belief in their so obviously weak religion.49 According to Al-Qarafi, Christian priests created the illusion that icons cry by using thin inner channels filled with water; in Sicily, they caused icons of Mary to lactate upon hearing the Gospel; in Constantinople, they levitated huge crosses, while in reality these crosses (and even icons) were held by six "magnetic stones" around them (hadjara min maghndfis); a doubtful Muslim there caused the crosses to fall. In the Chruch of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem they presented a yearly show of fire descending from the heavens, as it were. (This festival, which continues still is known as "Sabbath of Fire-Light" [Sabt al-Nuir].) According to Al-Qarafi, the fire is chanelled through a thin rope immersed in kerosene (naft). Further de- scriptions of fraudulent miracles abound.50 These stories present Al-Qarafi with the opportunity to stress the irrational side of Christianity as against rational Islam, which is built on logic and proof.51 The challenge to faith presented by the phenomenon of true miracles was a widespread topic in Islam, Christianity, and Judaism in the Middle Ages and some medieval authors-of all three religions-tried to set limits or define criteria to evaluate miracles. This was especially true in Islam, where a tension exists between the Qur'anic refusal that Muhammad per- formed miracles (3:183-84) and the late attribution of such miracles to him, probably under the influence of early Christian polemics.52 Muslim 48Al-Qarafi, Al-Adjwiba al-Fdkhira, 61-65. 49Ibid. 50A later Christian convert to Islam revealed that the holy water in the churches never becomes putrid, not because of the priests' blessing, but because they put salt and balms in it.

On this author see Mikel de Epalza, La-Tuhfa (Rome: n.p., 1971). 51Al-Qarafi attacked the irrationality of Christian dogmas and supported his views with allegedly historical anecdotes. See, for example, his story (Al-Adjwiba al-Fakhira, 56) about European Christian communities in France, Italy, and Spain who each year, for three consecu- tive days, robbed and killed Jews for having "stolen their religion," but stopped when the priest told them that their religion had been refound. Al-Qarafi also ridicules the European custom of duels.

Thus, for example, a twelfth-century physician, Yahya b. Yahya (or possibly Nasr b. Yahya), also a Christian convert to Islam, devoted a whole chapter (following earlier authors) in his Faithful Advice How to Put the Christian Religion to Shame to the problem of miracles.53 He describes Elijah, Elisha, and Ezekiel (!) performing miracles such as raising people from the dead, Elisha curing the nobleman Na'aman from leprosy, turning water into olive oil, and feeding multitudes for several years with a small amount of flour.54 Despite these miracles, none of the prophets was considered divine. God gave them as well as Jesus the power to perform these miracles.55 Even the miracle of Jesus' conception (which the Qur'an and Muslim authors ac- cept56) came under attack, since Adam was born not only without a father, but without a mother as well.57 If miracles were hotly debated, the cross and its meaning were even more so. The adoration of the cross is also a pre-Islamic polemical motif, but it played no important role in Jewish-Christian polemics up to the ment of a Theme in Arabic Theological Literature," HTR 78 (1985) 101-40. Later Muslim authors dealt with this topic frequently, especially when engaged in anti-Christian polemics. See, for example, W. Montgomery Watt's translation of Abui Hamid Al-Ghazzali's (d. 1111) much-printed autobiography, The Faith and Practice ofAl-Ghazzali (London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1953) 67-68. Compare also Muhammad b.

There is some confusion about the identity of this author; see Moritz Steinschneider, Polemische und apologetische Literatur in arabicher Sprache (Leipzig: Brockhaus, 1877) 57-58 and Al-Sharqawi's introduction to the Cairo edition of the book. 54Most of these stories appear in 2 Kings 4, 5 and in Ezekiel's vision (here taken as an actual event) in Ezekiel 37-38. From the ninth century on, other Muslim authors compared the miracles of Jesus unfavorably with those of Moses, arguing that feeding the people of Israel with manna and quails is more miraculous than feeding the five thousand with five loaves of bread, and that splitting the sea is more miraculous than walking on water. See, for example, the anonymous text published in Sourdel, "Un Pamphlet musulman anonyme," 27-28. Such arguments seem to be a direct answer to earlier pre-Islamic Christian claims that the miracles of Jesus were greater than those of Moses. See also Daniel J. Lasker, "Against Whom Did Saadia Polemicize Concerning Abrogation of the Torah?" Da'at 32-33 (1994) 8. 55This is how Jesus' miracles are described in the Qur'an (3:45-49), with the recurring stress on the fact that Jesus performed his miracles "with the permission of God" (bi-idhn Allah). 56See Qur'an 3:47 (as against Jewish doubts cast on the chastity of Mary): "She said: My Lord! How can I have a child when no mortal has touched me? He [the angel] said: So [it will be]. Allah createth what He will.

You kiss them and you prostrate yourselves to them, even though they are what people have made with their own hands. They neither hear, nor see, nor do harm, nor bring any advantage. The most estimable of them are made of gold and silver. Such is what Abraham's people did with their images and idols.60 Some Muslim authors explicitly deny the ideas of primordial sin and Jesus' atonement for the sins of humans through his death on the cross.61 They also emphasized that Jesus himself never mentioned the cross as a Chris- tian sign; according to Christian sources themselves, it was introduced only by the Emperor Constantine and his mother, Helen, who set out to find the original cross in Jerusalem.62 Thus, for example, asks the above mentioned thirteenth-century author Al-Qurtubi: 58See, for example, Sargis Istunaya de Gusit, The Disputation of Sergius the Stylite against a Jew (2 vols.; ed. and trans.

If they answer: "the prayer in which one crosses oneself is better," they must conclude that their own prayer is better than that of the Messiah63-and this is enough foolishness and ugliness. But if prayer without making the sign of the cross is better-why do you still do what has no merit?! This shows that these people do not rely on their prophets in their laws and do not go back to their legal sources (qawanin), but rely only on their desires and passions.64 Muslim negative attitudes toward the cross may, however, have deeper origins. Little attention has so far been paid to Islam's ignorance of visual symbols,65 perhaps because symbols like icons, music, and festivals impair, as it were, the absolute monotheistic belief in a totally transcendent God. As creatures of the imagination, planned to arouse emotion, symbols were unacceptable, perhaps even unintelligible, to the mainstream of orthodox medieval rationalistic Islam, whose representatives felt strong reservations even about allegorical interpretation of scripture, in contrast to the Shi'ites and Isma'ilites66 or to the Sufi mystics. Orthodox Islam had no counter symbol, no answer to the symbolism of the cross, and could not or would not understand Christian explanations of it. Thus, for example, in an early Christian-Muslim dialogue (written in Syriac and translated into Arabic), which may actually have taken place between the Nestorian Patriarch, Timo- thy I, and the Caliph Al-Mahdi, at the end of the eighth century CE,67 the Caliph asks Timothy: "Why do you bow (tasdjuduna) before the cross?" Timothy answers, "because it is the cause of life." The Muslim further inquires, "yet it was the cause of death!" When Timothy explained to his Muslim partner "that death was the cause of resurrection and resurrection is the cause of life," the Muslim, at least, according to this Christian source, seemed to be at a loss and had no answer. Like Christian authors long before Islam, Timothy added that the cross has unique powers and there- fore resembles the rod with which Moses miraculously turned bitter water 63This title (Al-Masih) is considered to be one of the names of Jesus (derived from the Qur'an), but has no eschatological meaning in Arabic. It is supposed to stem from Arabic roots that denote touching or wandering. See Georges C.

Yahya (mentioned above) says: You worship a cross of metal or wood like you worship the Messiah; you put it on an elevated stand (minbar) in the direction of your prayer (qibla), on fine cloth, and have a group of priests serve it, their heads uncovered,70 dressed in a long mantle with a hood (tailasan), the Zunnar-girdle71 bound around their waist, and in their hands incense and lit candles, singing at the top of their voice. The whole community is thus brought to serve [the cross] in the same manner, and they kiss it and the ground before it.72 This author (a former Christian) and earlier Muslim authors also de- scribed the Eucharist in much the same way and polemicized against it, but without reference to any possible symbolic meaning.73 Some quoted Matt 26:26-29, but ridiculed the verses using such arguments as: if every piece 68See Robert Caspar, "Les Versions arabes du Dialogue entre le Catholicos Timothee I et le calif Al-Mahdi (II/VIII siecle)," Islamochristiana 3 (1977) 140.

According to Muslim authors, Christians wrongly view the sonship of Jesus literally (while erroneously interpreting the commandments metaphori- cally). Muslim polemicists repeatedly attempted to convince Christians in a rationalistic way76 that this Jesus' sonship is a metaphor, to be understood like other biblical verses such as "Israel, my firstborn" (Exod 4:22).77 Jesus was merely a human prophet, completely distinct from God to whom Jesus too prayed and submitted himself.78 The absolute uniqueness of God, the humanity of Jesus, and the metaphorical sense of the titles "father" and "son" could all be proved using Qur'anic verses, logic, and semantics. 'All b. Rabban al-Tabari (d. ca. 865) asks about Jesus: Was he ever in one of the cities and did he [live] at a certain time or not? If they [the Christians] answer: "he was not in place and time," 74See, for example, cAbdallah Al-Mayurqi, Tuhfat al-Arib, 32. 75See above n. 37. 76Muslim orthodox authors used Muctazilite arguments in this context, although in general they rejected the allegorical interpretation of the Qur'an that proponents of the early rational- istic Muctazilite movement (as well as of Shi'ites and mystics) employed. The Mu'tazila flourished from the eighth to the tenth centuries and propogated the belief in the free will of humans and Reason as a means to understand scripture and religion. They employed allegori- cal interpretation to explain away anthropomorphic descriptions of God in the Qur'an. They usually limited allegorical interpretation to cases where no other rational reading of the scrip- ture was possible. 77These claims were widespread among medieval Muslim authors.

Pseudo Al-Ghazzal says: As for the word rabb ("master"), it is used both for God exalted be he, and for the owner of something; and one can say [for example]: "the owner (rabb) of a house" and "the owner of a utensil." As for the word ilah ("God") it is used by them [Christians] for everyone who is powerful.... And in the Psalms it says: "Gods, I said to you, sons of the exalted, all of you,"81 and in the Torah [God] said to Moses: "I have made you a god to Pharaoh and made your brother Aaron your messenger."82 [So] the word ilah ("god") can be used for everyone worshipped, whether the worship [itself] is [based on] truth or a false one. But if the wan- derer finds a way out of the strait, his perseverance in his error is [sheer] blindness.83 Pseudo Al-Ghazzall then quotes 1 Cor 8:4-6 to prove that even if Jesus were called rabb, this must be understood as "owner," not as "god." He uses the same method to deal with the problem of fatherhood and sonship, hoping to prove that these attributes cannot be considered unique to God's relationship with Jesus: This is made clear by the fact that in the Torah, the texts of which they accept as true, [it is said] with regard to Jacob, peace and prayer upon him: "My firstborn son Israel"; and it says also in the Torah: "Go tell Pharaoh: 'if you do not let my first-born son worship me in the desert, I shall kill your first-born son."'84 And he meant by "my son" the children of Israel, the number of which was then six hundred thousand without women and children.85 79Here the author quotes to prove that Jesus lived in certain places at a certain time. 80See Ar-Radd 'Ala-n-Nasdra de 'All At-Tabari (eds.

Muslim authors also struggled to understand and refused to accept Chris- tian accounts of Jesus' birth, life, and death86; (this was one of the main themes Jewish authors adopted as early as the ninth century87 and later transmitted to Jewish medieval authors in Europe88). Here is a late, detailed Muslim account of this story by Ibn Qayyim al-Djawziyya (d. 1350). And when one of those who blame the Muslims [for their religion] is [a Christian] from those who go astray [unmat al-dalal] and worship the cross and the painted images on the walls and roofs, one should say to him that he should be ashamed of his basic belief, in that God of heaven and earth, blessed and exalted be he, left his throne of glory and entered the womb of a woman, who eats, drinks, urinates, relieves her bowels, and menstruates, and became one with her (iltahama) in her belly. According to them, he stayed there for nine months in filth, urine, and polluted blood, then came out to a bed and diapers, and whenever he cried his mother would feed him her breast. Then he went to school (maktab) with other boys, until finally the Jews slapped him in the face and hit his neck, spit into his face and put a crown of thorns on his head and a cane in his hand, humiliating him and violat- ing his honor. Then they put him on a wooden structure, fastened him with ropes and nailed his hands and feet to it, and he cried out for help because of the hot nails and the pain of the cross.89 And he is sup- posed to be the one who created heaven and earth, and granted suste- nance, and fixed the lifespan [for everyone]. But his wisdom and compassion demanded that he let his enemies do with him whatever they did, so that they inherit punishment and be jailed in hell, and that he redeem his prophets, messengers and saints through this [his death] and bring them out of Satan's jail; because they [the Christians] be- lieve that the spirits of Adam, Noah and Abraham and the other proph- ets were in Satan's jail (sidjn iblis) in hell,90 until he redeemed them 86Muslim arguments mocking Christian descriptions of Jesus (the son of God, as it were) being born and growing up like every other person circulated as early as the ninth century; see, for example, Sourdel, "Un Pamphlet musulman anonyme," 27. 87The opposite possibility, that Muslim authors used earlier Jewish anti-Christian argu- ments, also exists, of course. 88See n. 29 above. 89This motif is stressed in detail by Muslim authors from the ninth century on, in particular Jesus' prayer to God to take the cup away from him and his cry on the cross, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (Matt 27:46 and Mark 15:34). 90This detail is especially repellent to Muslim authors who from the tenth century on considered all prophets (including the biblical patriarchs) to be infallible.</page><page sequence="22">82 HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW from there by letting his enemies crucify him.91 Muslim authors considered the entire story to be a myth, an attempt to place human limitations upon God and make him succumb to fate and nature, contrary to true monotheistic belief in his absolute power and tran- scendence. * SUfi Authors on Christianity Only the Shi'ites92 Sufi mystics showed some understanding of Christian symbolism and nonrational doctrines,93 although their knowledge of Chris- tianity seems to have been considerably less than that of the polemicists. Yet Jesus in Sufi writings is not only a prophet but the archetypical Sufi ascetic pilgrim and the mystic sufferer seeking God's proximity. The fa- mous mystic Al-Halladj (d. 922) may even have modelled his martyrium upon that of Jesus.94 Even among Sfi mystics, however, there often pre- vailed strong reservations about Christian symbolism and doctrines. They could, however, comprehend them better than did mainstream Muslims, because of their own inclination toward religious symbolism and allegori- zation. A case in point is the great orthodox-mystical author, already mentioned above, Al-Ghazzali, who linked the Christian notion of incarnation (hulil) with an extremist Sufi concept of mystical union (ittihad) and rejected both 91Ibn Qayyim al-Djawziyya, Hiddyat al-Hayara, 191. Compare The Book of Covenant of Joseph Kimhi (trans. Frank Ephraim Talmage; Toronto: Pontificial Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 1972) 36: "The great and mighty God Whom no eye has seen, Who has neither form nor image, Who said, For man may not see Me and live (Exod 33:20)-how shall I believe that this great inaccessible Deus absconditus needlessly entered the womb of a woman, the filthy, foul bowels of a female, compelling the living God to be born of a woman, a child without knowledge or understanding, senseless, unable to distinguish between his right hand and his left, defecating and urinating, sucking his mother's breasts from hunger and thirst, crying when he is thirsty so that his mother will have compassion on him. Indeed, if she had not suckled him, he would have died of hunger like other people." There are also other "Muslim" arguments in his book. See Hava Lazarus-Yafeh, "More on the Judeo-Christian Polemic," 53- 55. 92It is impossible in this essay to provide details about the Shi'a-the only important schismatic sect in Islam. Suffice it to say that there are many similarities between the Shi'ite religion and Christianity, and there may have been Christian influences on its development. Shi'ites also employed symbolic and allegorical interpretations of the Qur'an and could there- fore better understand Christian approaches. They rarely polemicized against them. 93According to Miguel Asin Palacios (Le Expiritualidad de AlGazel Yu Sentido Christiano [Publicationes de las Escuelas de estudios arabes de Madrid y Granada, first series, A, 2; Madrid: 1934-1941]), Sufi thought in general and Al-Ghazzali (d. 1111) in particular ac- cepted many Christian notions, and Jesus figured predominantly in Sufi writings.

'Abbad (d. 995): The glass is thin, the wine is clear The twain are alike, the matter is perplexed 'tis as though there were wine and no wine glass there Or as though there were wine glass and nought of wine.96 Al-Ghazzali also quotes Al-Halladj's saying: "I am whom I love and He whom I love is I" as a poetic, but erroneous metaphor.97 In some places Al-Ghazzali adds that this statement is similar to the "error of the Chris- tians (ghalat al-Nasaira) about Jesus, peace be on him, who said that he is God,"98 or maintained that the divine (ildhat) incarnated into Jesus' human nature (nasut), and that "therefore Jesus is either God, the son of God or half of God,"99 which according to Al-Ghazzali is, of course, impossible- even absurd. Al-Ghazzal's reproach of these Christian notions, however, is rather mild and Jesus figures prominently in his authentic writings as a venerable Sufi who has much in common with the Jesus of the Gospels.'00 * Conclusions In this article, I have tried to draw attention to some of the lesser known Muslim arguments against Christianity. The oversimplification and occa- sional ridicule Muslim authors employed may, of course, be part of their polemical tactics. I have, however, attempted to demonstrate that most of their arguments stem from an entirely different concept of God, the manner in which he should be worshiped, and their religious thought and practice. 95See Al-Ghazzali, Al-Maqsad al-Asnd, fi Sharh Asmd Alldh al-Husna (ed.

Gairdner, Al-Ghazzdl 's Niche of Light (London: RAS, 1924) 61. It is unclear to me whether Al-Ghazzali, whose knowledge of Christianity in his authentic writings is rather meager, knew anything about the Jacobite concept of incarnation as wine and water mixed. Some Muslim polemicists knew. See, for example, Abu 'Isa Al-Warraq's views in Thomas, Anti-Christian Polemic in Early Islam, 69 and especially Ibn Hazm, Al-Fasl fi-Milal wa-l-Ahwd wa-l-Nihal (2 vols.; n.p.: n.p., 1321 [=1903]) 1. 53, where he also provides the Nestorian (water and oil) and Melkite (fire and metal) explanation of the incarnation. 97Al-Ghazzall, Al-Maqsad al-Asra, 167. 98Ibid., 166. 99A1-Ghazzali, Ihyd CUlum al-Din (Cairo: Ladjnat Nashr al-Thaqafa al-Islamiyya, 1956- 57) 4. 2602.

Muslim authors apparently borrowed earlier Jewish polemical attitudes toward Christianity, but gave them a more elaborate, comprehensive ex- pression, which in its turn reinfluenced medieval Jewish authors, who shared many basic values and concepts with Islam. When dealing with the medi- eval triangle of the three monotheistic religions, we must remember that they can be regrouped differently when looked upon from a variant histori- cal angle: In addition to the traditional model of the usual two dhimmi ("protected") religions (Judaism and Christianity) under the rule of Islam, we should also view Judaism and Islam as the two halakhic, rationalistic, religions, less inclined to symbolism-in contrast to Christianity.</page></plain_text>
