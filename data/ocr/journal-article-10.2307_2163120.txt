Do not be deterred by the thin appearance of this book- 176 pages of text. The print is small, the pages are fairly large, and every word counts. This thor- oughly researched, well-written history of the move- ment to save wild animals fills a vacuum. It is an excellent example of our discipline's value to other areas of endeavor. Thomas R. Dunlap divides his study into three parts. Part 1, "Foundations for a Wildlife Policy," begins with generalizations about the pioneers' approach to wildlife "as objects to be used and used up" (p. 5). In the mid-nineteenth century, hunting became a gentleman's sport. Simultaneously the concepts grew that some animals, usually ungulates that were prime hunting prey, were "good" animals and that the beasts that killed them were "bad" animals to be mercilessly de- stroyed; so, too, with birds of prey. Those ideas softened somewhat in the public mind with the animal stories of Ernest Seton Thompson, Charles G. D. Roberts, and others. Their characters were anthropomorphic: the animals acted and thought like humans. An example of such "nature faker" writ- ing was the story of the woodcock that made a cast of mud and straw for its broken leg. The naturalist John Burroughs and Theodore Roosevelt chided the au- thors for presenting such nonsense as truth. Finally came government involvement with the cre- ation of the United States Biological Survey. Soon the survey was involved in predator control. It, or the same agency with a succession of names, cooperated with ranchers to eliminate predators as well as ground squirrels and prairie dogs. People who questioned those policies founded their own organizations. In 1915 the Ecological Society of America was organized, and in 1919 the Society of American Mammalogists came into being. But, as Dunlap points out, they possessed "a set of ideas in search of an organizing</page><page sequence="2">United States 245 principle" (p. 45). Other groups advocated an end to feathered hats or the outlawing of leg-hold traps. In part 2, "A Time of Transition," Dunlap traces side by side the progress of wildlife protection and the bureaucratic defense of predator policy into the 1960s. It is difficult for our generation to believe that intelli- gent, educated wildlife authorities could have failed to realize that the killing of predators would create many new problems. Partly as a result of the proliferation of the Kaibab deer, bureaucrats began to have second thoughts about the destruction of predators. But deer hunters have always resented cougars "killing our deer," and ranchers, especially sheepmen, have contin- ued to advocate vigorous coyote control programs. Nor are those groups enthusiastic about the reintroduction of wolves. The public, however, educated by such books as Rachel Carson's Silent Spring (1962), Fairfield Osborn's Our Plundered Planet (1948), and Farley Mo- wat's Never Cry Wolf (1963), became insistent that changes favoring the predators be made. Part 3, "New Ideas, New Action," takes the reader through the last quarter century. Chapter titles indicate the subject matter: "Ending the Poisoning," "Saving Species," and "Finding Equilibrium." The last chapter, in which Dunlap shows how the Ronald Reagan admin- istration backtracked from much of the progress made just decades before, acquaints the reader with the situation as it exists today. Dunlap states that his story is told "with emphasis on wolves and coyotes" (p. xi). The emphasis is hardly discernible. Discussion also includes prairie dogs, the black-footed ferret, and, to a lesser degree, bobcats, cougars (or mountain lions), and predatory birds; the saving of the whooping crane is also mentioned, as is the crusade for ducks and geese. This book is a major contribution to conservation and wildlife-management literature. It is based on extensive use of primary sources and is essential back- ground material for anyone involved in any way in the history of predator control and wildlife management. RICHARD A.
