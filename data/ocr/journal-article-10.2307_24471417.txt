The collection of pictures themselves, present a sixth classification he did not name. In the "Lyrical &amp; Ac curate" exhibition, at George Eastman House some years ago, I called the quality 'the innocent eye.' Szarkowski combed the major society and private historical collec tions of photographs in this country. The result is too innocent to be an accurate reflection of the whole body of photography. (By comparison Newhall's History leans towards the aristocratic, while "Lyrical &amp; Accurate" was over-poetic.) At the level of the untrained photographer who has no art background to either burden him or help him innocence of eye is often unbelievably stupid. Szar kowsky omitted the stupid. Innocence of eye by Edward Weston is an earned, that is, a coming full circle, and hence no longer naive. Eugène Atget had this kind of innocence, so does Henri Cartier-Bresson. To help my own understanding of the definitions of the various sections I have paraphrased them. The Thing Itself seems to mean a direct confrontation with the ob ject in front of the camera as an isolated event. Vantage Point refers to the photographer's confrontation with the relationships of togetherness and backgrounds that ap pear in front of the camera. These two concepts are uncontestably basic to the medium, and the order of pres entation is in keeping with the practice of beginning pho tographers. The beginning photographer rarely sees rela tionships. It is the single object that holds his attention, the rest escapes him, while photographing, and when looking at the print later the rest still escapes him! Rela tionships, Vantage Point come later, much later. The illustrations for The Thing Itself are arranged in such a way that the concept is muddied rather than clarified. For example, the opening photograph, Bedroom Interior (by an unknown photographer, circa 1910) is ac tually a photograph of relationships not a photograph of a thing. His text explains that the thing means subject as well as object which is a confusion. The first three photo graphs suggest that The Thing Itself is to be a bedroom. Obviously this is not what was intended, yet this is where the reader is started on a journey into The Photographer's Eye. Not one photograph in the entire section confronts the viewer of the image with a single object which is im plied in the word Thing. The closest to this requirement is Wright Morris' photograph of a Model T Ford, 1947. Yet this photograph is really a detail, a part standing for the whole. In my own terminology it could illustrate the "anthropomorphic" photograph. The Photographer's Eye, full of stimulating images, is the most recent visual and verbal definition of pure, nat ural, or straight photography in a series that includes Beaumont Newhall's first edition of the History of Photog raphy, 1937, and this reviewer's exhibition, "Lyrical &amp; Accurate," a résumé of which was published in Image, October, 1956. Regardless of the decade, for anyone to look at the whole corpus of photography, from top to bottom, is a fascinating experience. This experience can be somewhat objective. Trying, however, to find fundamental words or basic concepts by which this whole body of photography can be examined is always a subjective affair. Each of us hopes that our names for concepts will become a part of the vocabulary of criticism and that our selection of il lustrations will become part of the visual vocabulary of image making. Photography, like the phenomenon of life itself presents different facets constantly. Consequently if our word structures crumble, the image material itself does not. The photographs remain in spite of intellectual structuring. John Szarkowski structured his book into five cate gories: and gave them titles as direct and simple (anti intellectual) as most of the photographs themselves: The</page><page sequence="2">The book, as was the earlier exhibition, is some- interesting observations.

He uses Time also to include point. One of the photographs by Robert Frank illustrates those brief moments when the flux of relationships falls unmistakably how vantage point can be used to make a into a specific fix which, from our long relationship to art, biting, sarcastic statement. we are glad to call "a picture." Part of the text from this The text for The Detail section seems to boil down to section reads, "Photographs stand in a special relation to the observation that once the photographer left his studio time, for they describe only the present." At a naive level he could not "stage-manage the battle" intuitively, and this is true. His illustrations verify this particular truth. Be so he sought and found significant detail.
