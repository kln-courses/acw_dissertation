<plain_text><page sequence="1">A "New" Hieroglyphic Text at Chichen Itza, Yucatan. Mexico Rijswijk (Erik Boot). Graffiti in the Maya area show a large variety in subject matter, from abstract signs and patterns to complex narratives involving multiple figures (zoomorphic and anthropomorphic) to single and compounded hieroglyph- ic signs (rare) (compare Mayer 2009: 21-24). With exam- ples now known from the whole of the Maya area (see Vidal Lorenzo and Muñoz Cosme 2009) and covering the Preclas- sic to Postclassic periods, research of these graffiti can lead to intriguing surprises. A recent overview of graffiti at Chichen Itza, Yucatan, Mexico (Martín Diaz and Schmidt 2009) led me to re-investigate a particular graffito at the southeast An- nex at the Las Monjas complex (Fig. 1). The graffito on the stuccoed interior jamb at this building was described as follows: [...] que la jamba interior del Anexo Sureste nos muestra lo que parecen ser diversos motivos geométricos y algunos glifos trazados burdamente. (Martín Díaz and Schmidt 2009: 83) The authors unfortunately made a mistake here. Their de- scription trazados burdamente ("coarsely, roughly designed or laid-out") cannot be further from the truth in this particular case. The drawing of the graffito on the interior jamb at the southeast Annex of Las Monjas can be found in Figure 2.1 132 mexicon • Vol. XXXV • Dezember 2013</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1. Las Monjas complex, Chichen Itza, Yucatan (plan after An- drews 1991: 50, based on several plans in Bolles 1977) Fig. 2. Drawing of the graffito on the interior jamb of the southeast Annex, Las Monjas (after Bolles 1977: 132). Arrangement and rota- tion by the author. The graffito at the southeast Annex is a (partial) re-ar- rangement of the hieroglyphic text as found on the front of the lintel at the Las Monjas East Wing (Fig. 3). The part that, in my opinion, justifies this comparison can be found in the southeast Annex jamb text at pEl-pFl (Fig. 2). This part can be compared with the section Cl-Dl on the Las Monjas East Wing lintel (Fig. 3). As can be observed, the two colloca- tions have switched places, but both the "crossed-bars" signs (pEl compared to D2) and the "anthropomorphic head with cross-hatching" (pFl compared to C2) can be easily identi- fied (Fig. 4). The remainder of the graffito text on the interior jamb at the southeast Annex is much more difficult to identify. The part that is clearly copied may inform us about the scribal perception of the Las Monjas East Wing lintel at the time the graffito was produced. The future scribe of the graffito text would have stood in front of the Las Monjas East Wing building and read its hieroglyphic text. Instead of reading the texts as arranged in Figure 2 and following the order Al -B1-A2-B2-&amp;C and Cl- D1-C2-D2-&amp;C he read the text in a single columnar fashion as upper-lower collocations, probably from left to right. This means that he read the "crossed-bars" sign first (upper col- location) and the "anthropomorphic head with cross-hatching" second (lower collocation). When he composed the incised Fig. 3. Drawings of the lintel text from the Las Monjas Annex (after Maudslay 1889-1902, Volume III, Plate 13c &amp; sketch drawing of the front by the author). Zig-zag lines give the reading order of the two texts, thus starting at the center and going outwards in opposite directions. Fig. 4. Comparison of the southeast Annex jamb text (text after Bolles 1977) and Las Monjas East Wing lintel text (preliminary drawing by the author) graffito version of the text, nota bene in the length of the jamb (thus incised at a nearly 90 degree angle), he applied a standard Maya scribal principle. The first collocation of this pair was written on the left and the second collocation was written on the right (thus in double columns); as such the order he wrote was pEl-pFl, a re-interpretation of a text he read upper-lower (D2-C2), which unfortunately was in error. The scribe apparently did not fully understand this part of the hieroglyphic text,2 as he changed the intended order. Also note that the scribe rotated the anthropomorphic head accord- ingly (front of face directed to the start of the text). It must be noted that the single columnar reading order upper-lower (or top-bottom) can be found at other buildings at Chichen Itza, most directly south of Las Monjas (e.g., Temple of the Three Lintels, Lintel 3; reading order Al -B1-A2-B2-C1 -C2-D1 - D2-E 1 -E2-F 1 -F2-G 1 -G2-H 1 -H2-1 1 -12). Perhaps this scribe was familiar with those texts and applied this knowledge to the Las Monjas East Wing lintel text as well. The East Wing lintel text composition is (at present) unique in the Maya area and may thus have confused the reader and future scribe of the incised graffito text on the interior jamb of the southeast 133 mexicon • Vol. XXXV • Dezember 2013</page><page sequence="3">Annex at the Las Monjas complex. But, as noted before, the scribe was familiar with the most common Maya scribal prin- ciples in text arrangement and composition when he incised the graffito text. I express the hope that good photographs of the graffito text, possibly made during the Carnegie project at Chichen Itza in the 1930s, will surface. Perhaps then, more of the in- cised graffito text can be analyzed and compared to the Las Monjas East Wing lintel text.3 It is at this moment not known to the author if the graffito still exists. Notes 1 ) The coordinates of the glyph blocks have been added by the author. The "p" in pA, &amp;c, stands for "provisional," as the full extend of the text is not yet completely known. 2) A preliminary transcription, transliteration, and translation of the Las Monjas Annex lintel text: [Al-Bl] 'a-'ALAY?-la?-ya K'AL-ja alay k'a[h]laj "here is presented" [A2-B2] yu??-xu?? y-uxu[l]{ ?) "the carving(?)" [A3-B3] yo TOT y-otot "of the house of' [A3-D5] "name and titles of a single (or multiple) individual(s)," identifying the prob- able owner(s) of the building or home {otot). Many of the hieroglyphic signs in this part of the text are unique in the Chichen Itza (and thus Maya) corpus and have not yet been deciphered. Note the paired colloca- tions at C4-D4, STAR-SKULL(?), 'EK'-[JOLOM??]. This combination also appears, but fully conflated, in the Sky Band (position 8) directly above the Las Monjas Annex lintel (see Maudslay 1889-1902, Vol. Ill: Plate 13b; Seler 1915: 229, Abb. 42), providing the name of a possible constellation (compare Bricker and Bricker 1998). Elite personal names were drawn from a variety of sources, including the names of gods and natural phenomena. 3) Future research will include alternative reading orders, but I consider these less likely. Resumen: Los grafitos ya descubiertos en el area maya muestran una gran variedad en los sujetos que presentan cómo diseños abstractos o geométricos, interacciones complejos entre varias figuras y signos o colocaciones jeroglí- ficas. El autor analiza un grafito que se encuentra esgrafiado en la jamba in- terior del Anexo Sureste del complejo arquitectónico nombrado Las Monjas en Chichen Itza, Yucatán, México. El autor propone que el grafito del Anexo Sureste no consta de "algunos glifos trazados burdamente" (Martín Díaz y Schmidt 2009: 83), pero contiene una copia parcial del texto jeroglífico en el dintel del 'East Wing' de Las Monjas.
