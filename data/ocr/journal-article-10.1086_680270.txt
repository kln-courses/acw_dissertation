      <p>At the American Museum of Natural History, the windowed displays of the Hall of African Mammals glow in the relative darkness of the room. The painstakingly preserved animals they contain sit frozen in a single moment of action. Created almost a century ago, these displays continue to entrance visitors, who gaze at sparse deserts and peer into dense jungles, hoping to catch a glimpse of nature at her most intimate and most exposed. Looking longer, however, visitors also begin to see smaller details, such as a nonchalant porcupine in the corner, the curved walls of the display room that create an illusion of infinite space, and perhaps the reflection of strangers in the glass. Positioned at the intersection of museum studies and the history of science, the carefully curated essays in <italic>Animals on Display</italic> explore the processes by which museum patrons, zoo visitors, and other consumers of natural history have created meaning out of experiences like these.</p>
      <p>If historians of science have had a tendency to examine scientific animals as mirrors of human cultural norms or windows through which to glimpse our own natures, then scholars of animal studies have been equally entranced by subaltern readings of animal agency. This volume steers a middle path. Representations of animals, the editors argue, are both flexible and simultaneously constrained by the materiality of the books, specimens, or animals themselves.</p>
      <p>The first three essays in the collection ask why and how we have sought to preserve animals. Lise Camilla Ruud illustrates how monstrous piglets were used as barometers of influence in eighteenth-century Spanish natural history. Brita Brenna analyzes the ways in which the creation of glass cabinets in the nineteenth century altered the practices of museum patrons by rendering the objects contained within the cabinets highly visible and yet permanently inaccessible. Nigel Rothfels redefines the legacy of Carl Akeley as a man eager to preserve animals, capturing them in lifelike dioramas before they had vanished entirely from the world. Together these pieces demonstrate the social and political aspirations invested in collecting and displaying animals as symbols of desire, objects of commodification, and signs of the fragility of nature.</p>
      <p>The next three essays investigate the difficulties of authenticating particular animal specimens. Brian Ogilvie, for example, points to the continuity of early modern scientific and artistic modes of knowing in visual and textual descriptions of insect life, which drove natural historians to acquire ever more rare specimens. Henry McGhie grapples with the difficulties posed to collectors by rare animals, like Ross's Gull, and suggests that the very lack of material subjects in cases like these provides historians with an excellent opportunity to describe the social and moral valences that nevertheless emerge. Liv Emma Thorsen explores the mythic legacy made possible by a taxidermied St. Bernard and the subsequent construction of “Barrylore” pertaining to his heroic past. The codification of particular modes of preservation, we learn, constrains the diversity of available meanings observers can instill in particular displays.</p>
      <p>The final essays of the collection ask how interacting with live animals might change the processes of representation. Adam Dodd's paper on anthropomorphism and insects illustrates an extreme example of the volume's more general point—that our capacity to imprint meaning onto animals as individuals, specimens, or species can be more than a mere act of ventriloquism; it can make visible the agency of material nature. Karen Rader examines how visitors to the <italic>Watchful Grasshopper</italic> empathized readily with grasshopper subjects, even if the intent of the display was to get viewers to think about the process of science rather than the animals themselves. Guro Flinterud recounts a tale of Knut, a polar bear denizen of the Berlin Zoological Garden turned into a blogger by a local newspaper, whose authenticity in the eyes of his fans depended on a careful negotiation of his identity as a specific zoo animal and a charismatic icon in the fight against anthropogenic climate change. These essays expose the mechanisms by which representational practices have been established, propagated, and diversified in the twentieth century.</p>
      <p>As a whole, the volume demonstrates how our cultural imaginations are tethered to the material reality of animals, insisting that such representations can never fully escape the social and cultural contexts in which they were originally created and are now viewed. It also shows how powerful connections with animals on display, like those at the American Museum of Natural History, allow visitors an intimate, if fleeting, glimpse of previously living, breathing organisms.</p>
