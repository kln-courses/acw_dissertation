<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE AGE OF FRONTIER TERRA-COTTAS A reply by LIEUT.-COLONEL D. H. GORDON W x roRK on the material available from sites in the Charsadda Subdivision 'AV and the Mardan District is constantly producing new facts and new evidence, and so, although I have up to a point stated my case quite clearly in a previous article,I I feel that there is a considerable amount of unpublished material which will go a long way towards presenting a very different view of these finds from that put forward bv Mlle Corbiau in Iraq.2 As a beginning I should like to put forward a suggestion about the meaning of certain expressions, or at any rate what they mean to me. (a) 'Hellenistic figures', by which I mean figures of a pure Greek style, such as might have been produced in Greece itself from 250 B.C. onwards. These date roughly from I80 B.C. to 50 B.C. and are, in my opinion, together with their coins, some of the relatively few relics of the Indo-Greeks. They have nothing to do with the later Graeco- Roman art of Gandhara. (b) 'Archaic figures', by which I mean those figures of primitive stylized type having Syrian affinities introduced through Syro-Parthian in- fluence, which date from 200 B.C. onwards to the third century A.D. (Fig. i). (c) 'Indo-Scythian', by which I mean those figures which, whether show- ing Hellenistic influence or not, are in style and subject essentially Scythic, and date from 80 B.C. to A.D. IOO. (d). And lastly 'Gandharan', by which is meant that provincial Graeco- Roman art, displaying varying degrees of Indianization, which at its best is in many ways comparable to that of Pergamon, and flourished under the Kushan rulers from A.D. i00 to A.D. 350. Having cleared the ground with these definitions I will take the points raised by Mlle Corbiau's article and deal with them in the same order as they have been introduced by. her, beginning at page 3. The Channavira, as has been pointed out by Mr. K. de B. Codrington,3 is Indian and iconographical and is a most unsuitable object to utilize as one of comparison to suggest great antiquity. Actually there is a great variety of painted, incised, and applied decoration, but they all appear to indicate some form of crossed ornament and a girdle. As Mlle Corbiau admits, etched camelian beads and lids with central knob handles are still made, the latter in thousands. To say that they have been taken into consideration for the dating of the 'Harappa culture' at Mohenjo- daro is a just comment on the way in which the material from that site has been handled. Their dating value is nil.

H</page><page sequence="2">86 D. H. GORDON I have many times gone into the question of the eye-form in which the applied and incised technique is used. I am told, however, that I must com- pare examples in which this form of eye is used with others of 'Graeco- Buddhist times', which I am now quite prepared to do. I produce, first, a series of male figures having a head-dress knotted up on the left side. This form of head-dress is common at Sanchi (middle ist cent. B.c.) and in many terra-cottas from Mathura1 and elsewhere, all datable from the first century B.c. to the second century A.D. The series does not necessarily imply a de- velopment, though the knot in the example of the two archaic figures with incised eyes is shown as a mere bump on the left-hand figure, and as a twist of clay in that next to it. The real purpose of the series is to show the same head-dress in the archaic as in the moulded figures, and to suggest that they are nearly, if not quite, contemporary (Figs. 2 and 3). Next are figures with the conical Parthian cap. One has incised eyes and the other is of Indo-Scythian style (Fig. 4), and, to be classed with these, are the objects shown in Fig. 5, of which both are moustached, have a similar head- dress, and are used as grotesques applied to jars; one has incised eyes, and the other is obviously Indo-Scythian, to be dated to the late first century B.c. Finally a female figure with incised eyes has a pig-tail hanging from a plate- like head ornament, and both of these features, as is mentioned in my first article on terra-cottas from Sari Dheri,2 are characteristic of the most perfectly finished Hellenistic figures; and the round fronted head-dress, with small rosettes, of such a Hellenistic figure is present in two archaic figures with true and modified incised eye technique (Figs. 6, 7, and 8). In addition to these points I should like also to illustrate two moulded figures, which can be dated with comparative safety to early in the third century a.D. (Fig. 9). The incised eye technique has been faithfully copied in the mould, and it is impossible to classify them stylistically as anything but archaic. Attention may here be drawn with advantage to the naked female figure in bone from Sirkap (ist cent, b.c.), illustrated by Coomara- swami, which copies the incised eyes and is also stylistically archaic. So much then for the incised eyes so common in Gandhara, and so scarce elsewhere. The spade-shaped cult figures are a puzzle, but I feel that they are derived, and are possibly the very last derivatives, from a long tradition of employing this particular stylized triangular form to indicate the reproductive powers of the Great Mother Goddess. The fan-shaped head-dress is admittedly present in figures of great antiquity; nearer home, however, it is present in an archaic style of figure which has already been compared with that shown in A.S.I. Annual Report, 1911-12, pi. xxiii, fig. 35, and there dated as Kushan, such figures being quite commonly found at Sahri Bahlol (Fig. 10). More to the point still, it is also very definitely present in a superb Hellenistic head from Sirkap (Fig. 11). 1 This is, of course, Muttra, but those who term themselves Indologists always spell it in this way to confuse it with Madura. 2 Some Terra-cottas from Sari Dheri, N.W.F.P.

I have already indicated above that anthro- pomorphic pots are to be found in late styles. In the Peshawar Museum side by side with the pot illustrated by Mile Corbiau is a female figure of purely Indian type of roughly first to second century a.D., it being part of a pot spout. The other object shown by Mile Corbiau, pi. v, fig. 5, is I think an elephant's head, and I possess a very similar fragment. The studded pottery shown in Fig. 6 of the same plate does not reproduce the technique employed at Eshnunna. The Peshawar piece, which is the fragment of a small thick-sectioned object, possibly a lamp, has round blobs of clay applied after the surface of the pottery had dried. The Eshnunna studded effect is produced, as can be seen by studying a photograph, by points of clay being worked on or up from the surface of the vessel while that surface was still plastic. When we come to the double-spouted vase,1 which appears to be a piece of evidence of some considerable weight, I must confess that the situation is a difficult and delicate one, for this apparently important piece of evidence is simply not fact. This puts any one who urges a contrary opinion in rather an invidious position. I examined the vase in question on December 14th, 1937, in company with Khan Sahib Dilawar Khan, the Curator. There can be no doubt that the vase we examined is the vase in question, as it is readily recognizable, it being the only one of its kind, and the Curator who was with me had himself supplied the photograph reproduced in Iraq. The facts are as follows : the vase shows signs of three handles placed equidistantly round the rim, the remains of two being present and the third one indicated by a clear mark where it was detached. The handle fragments are hollow, but there is no aperture or passage of any kind connecting them with the vase, so that they are definitely not spouts, nor has the vase any spout. In all probability the three handles curved upwards and met at a point above the centre of the vase. In support of my statement I append a note by the Curator.2 A further piece of evidence has recently come to hand in the shape of a superb terra-cotta face from Sahri Bahlol (Fig. 12). It is oriental but not Indian; I should class it as Hellenistic Syrian, and I feel that there should be many parallels. A number of heads also from Sahri Bahlol show the pseudo-archaic types to which this style of face deteriorated, most of them having the same uncommon hollow-backed technique as Fig. 12. There are a number of examples from Sahri Bahlol in the Peshawar Museum where the sequence of decadence is quite apparent. A similar sequence, closely of this type, may be observed in the oval terra-cottas from Akra in the Bannu district. I am certain that a possible solution lies in a consideration of the probabili- ties of a popular art and an art for the rich. Even the very poor would wish to deposit votive figures at a notable shrine, especially if it was the shrine of 1 In Taxila Museum there is one double- spouted vase, but as this was found at Sirkap at a depth of 2 ft., it does not support a date of great antiquity. 2 'I examined the pot, illustrated by Mile Cor- biau, in company with Lieut.-Colonel D. H. Gordon, D.S.O., ?.?.?., and can vouch that it has no spout of any kind. The objects which appear to be spouts in the photograph are remains of handles.'? Dilawar Khan (Curator Peshawar Museum).</page><page sequence="4">88 D. H. GORDON the Great Goddess, giver of children. The terra-cottas are of many shapes and sizes, but examples of good Hellenistic style are scarce, and their standard of excellence suffers a ready deterioration ; I have one with the characteristic wreath fully displayed, but having no features. On the other hand, the more primitive 'Archaic figures' are in relative abundance. In this connexion I should like to quote from a letter from Dr. F?bri: 'One more thing (which supports your dating of the terra-cottas) ; terra-cottas, with few exceptions, are 'the poor man's sculpture', often made by village potters and not artists. Hence they (i) reflect popular beliefs, (2) look more primitive than contem- porary grand sculpture, (3) preserve old features with the conservatism of primitives.' There is the psychological background of the case in a nutshell. In conclusion I should like to raise a few additional points with reference to the Great Goddess. I have already claimed that the particular manifesta- tion of this deity worshipped in north-western India from 200 b.c. to a*d. 300 was the goddess Anaitis, Anahid, or Nanaia. This goddess was, with Mithra, the chief deity of the Iranians. Rostovtzeff says: 'This Iranian world is the pre-Zoroastrian one which disseminated the cults of Mithra and Anaitis, the two Iranian divinities who exerted a potent influence on the classical civiliza- tion of Hellenistic and Roman times.'1 From the fourth century b.c. onwards these two were the chief deities of the Scythians. Anaitis was also the goddess of the Parthians, and a bronze naked statuette representing her, shown by Friedrich Sarre2 as being of the Parthian period, is in line with the Archaic figures in its general style and ideology. Finally from Rawlinson: 'Bactra was famous in Persian literature as the centre of the worship of Anahid, probably a Skythian goddess originally' ; he elsewhere cites coins of Demetrios the Bactrian and Kanishka the Kushan as both bearing figures of Anaitis.3 From these quotations it will be seen that the Graeco-Bactrians, the Scythians (Sakas), the Parthians and the Kushans, the successive rulers of north-west India for more than five hundred years, all subscribed to the worship of Anaitis. Furthermore, I claim that it is the starry crown of Anaitis, mentioned in the Zend-avesta, which is depicted in the rosetted head-dress of the Archaic figures, fig. 5, pi. in, of Mile Cor- biau 's article which particularly bears out this point.4 In view of the fresh evidence I have brought forward and the new points I have raised, I consider that there is a firmly established case for Anaitis as the goddess represented in these terra-cotta figurines of all styles, which will be very difficult to shake. 1 Iranians and Greeks in South Russia, n and 104 f. * Die Kunst des Alten Persien: Parthische Klein- kunst, 29. 3 Intercourse between India and the Western World, 70, 72, and 164. 4 The Aban Yast is entirely devoted to Aidvi Sura Anahita, and verses 126-9 giye a detailed de- scription of her. Verses 2 and 5 show her as a fertility goddess, but nearly all the prayers made to her are for victory in battle.. It is possible that winged figures such as the * Angel* of Khan Mahi (Man. 70, 1934, fig. 2) represent this goddess in her manifestation as the angel Anahid.
