<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HOMERIC HYMN TO APHRODITE: EROTIC ANANKE HUGH PARRY RECENT CRITICS WHO HAVE EXAMINED the Fifth Homeric Hymn as myth, as hymnal celebration, or as considered art have consolidated Hermann's judgement long ago that it is carmen Homeri nomine dignissimum.' Most notably Peter Smith, in his detailed study of the hymn's mythic function, to express and mediate between man's desire to escape death and his knowledge that he must die, and of the narrative art serving that function, has con- firmed the artistry and power of the hymn beyond reasonable doubt.2 A number of critics have also argued the importance of the hymn as a docu- ment in the history of love literature, particularly Bickerman, who finds in it the first European expression of the romantic lover, the femme fatale, and the deification of the beloved.3 The present paper examines the hymn's representation of a subject of some significance in Greek thought, that of erotic "necessity," especially in the male lover's ambivalent experience of heterosexual eros. Lyric and tragic contexts tend to dwell exclusively on the irresistible element in sexual passion. The Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite goes farther, tracing in the sexual encounter a sequence of emotions (including humour), choices, actions, and reactions that both builds toward the climax of erotic ananke and extends beyond it to the aftermath of a more sober, postcoital state of mind. In that sense the hymn offers a more balanced account of eros than do the selective flights of the lyric and tragic imagina- tions.

On the level of narrative motivation, we can summarily dismiss the claim that the poet makes the goddess submit to necessity out of scruple for her sexual "purity." Purity is not an issue in this hymn.4 Shame, Aphrodite's oneidos (247), most certainly is. But it has nothing to do with Aphrodite's submission to eros as such, as if this involved some form of besmirched purity. Archaic shame is always loss of standing in a culture that measures worth hierarchically.5 In the Iliad Aphrodite proves to be an ineffective fighter, and so is considered by Diomedes as "weak" herself (5.331) and advised to limit her activities to those appropriate to "weak women" (5.349). That the goddess embodies eros is relevant in this passage. Diomedes' disparaging remarks, echoed later by Zeus himself, confirm the subordinate place of eros within the heroic code. The Homeric Hymn, on the other hand, does not belittle erotic values; Athena's preference for the "works of Ares" is not commended as some ideal standard. Aphrodite's shame here is not her embodiment of eros and certainly not her submission to eros. It is, rather, her passion for the wrong thing, imposed on her by a vengeful Zeus. The god, tired of being himself tamed by eros, turns the tables on the goddess of eros by making her a victim of her own power. At this level, her shame is "among the immortals" (247), a matter of power politics in the Olympian hierarchy. Second, she loses face by conceiving a passion for a mortal man. It is a standard complaint among female deities that dalliance with men is frowned upon by their male coun- terparts, that it is therefore shameful; the double standard operated in heaven no less than on earth. And for all her awful power, for a goddess to mate with a mortal is to lower herself and so risk losing face with mortals too. The equivalent on earth would be a noble woman bestowing her favours on a slave. So Aphrodite enjoins Anchises not to tell anyone that they slept together (281-288). It is not sex itself that is shameful. At the same time the poet transforms her humiliation into an extended and subtle encounter between maid and man that invites us to see in the hymn a psychological as well as political concatenation of forces. Among these is the energy of the appetitive instincts. Aphrodite's own reference to KptTEpq Lfvci'yKT (130) and the words OEOv LOT6rTL KOMai aO (166) at the moment of sexual consummation seem to echo the state of unmitigated compulsion so familiar to us in lyric and tragic accounts of eros. But other factors are at 4There have been some curious attempts to defend Aphrodite's purity in this hymn: "Gemoll [against Baumeister] rightly points out that Aphrodite shews shame and modesty. Her passion for Anchises is no wantonness, but has been forced upon her by Zeus" (Allen and Sikes, above, n. 2, [1904] 196; in the 1934 edition the argument is reworded slightly but its substance remains the same.)

The poet of the Hymn to Aphrodite employs a tradi- tional phraseology of sexual impulse, including metaphors of aggressive interference. The verbs 8GaltiELv/8~vv (3, 17) and such expressions as "putting [REpov in the heart" (45, 53) and "UiEpos seizes .. ." (57) suggest external agency. AuXF.t?ELV and cognate terms compare the effect of sexual drives to the external force that tames wild animals, rendering them helpless. The implied metaphor is essentially that of enslavement. At~s means "slave" and 8aLc?SELv can mean to "make [a virgin] subject to a male" (to a husband, II. 18.432; to a rapist or seducer, II. 3.301; Od. 3.269). a8.Trros means "unbroken" of cattle, horses, and mules (II. 23.266, 655), sometimes of maids (so here, 133), &amp;8turjs "unwedded" of maids (Od. 6.109, 228), some- times "unbroken" of mules (Od. 4.637). In our hymn (3; cf. 251) Aphrodite as eros "overpowers" (8tcR0taTo, gnomic aorist) the tribes of men, birds, and beasts, in making them submit to the enslaving force of a natural law. However, where animals have no choices, human beings (and anthropo- morphic gods) do. Even the attempt to 8~&amp;ciELv another by eros may fail, since in human experience attempts to "tame" by eros may be almost syn- onymous with attempts to "persuade" and to "deceive" by eros: so in our hymn oi ... 8cGvTOLL (16 f.) is glossed by o06 &amp;1vcLT OTrETLe r v 4pEvcs o068' dMrrcTractL (7, 33). Each verb expresses a failed attempt to impose eros. Such failure is an account of what the world simply is in certain of its aspects. Aphrodite cannot aoxv&amp;craeot Athena who represents the "male" virtue of intelligence, free of erotic distraction, applied to the shaping and ordering of the world; nor Hestia, the essential rroapkivos Cdiryq by nature; nor what is wild, untameable, namely Artemis, the virgin huntress. However, these goddesses are described as anthropomorphic beings and the poet interprets their states in the language and so on the level of human experience not as determined by necessity but as the choice of a certain kind of pleasure. 6Apollodorus' allusion to this myth is very brief: he is perhaps recalling Theog. 1008 ff., or summarizing either a lost version of the myth or, possibly, the Homeric Hymn's version understood to be about erotike epithymia. 7Cited by S. Chatman, in Story and Discourse (Ithaca, N.Y. 1978) 124. Chatman cites Ludwig Klages on the same point: "Language excels in unconscious insight the acumen of the most talented thinker, and we contend that whoever, having the right talent, should do nothing but examine the words and phrases which deal with the human soul, would know more about it than all the sages who omitted to do so."</page><page sequence="4">256 PHOENIX The archaic poet knows that "persuasion" and "deception" and even divine magic are not necessarily irresistible forces, since they may fail: so Odysseus enters the bed of bewitching Circe only on his own conditions (Od. 10.342- 348). And so in the Homeric Hymn Hestia, courted by Poseidon and Apollo, "was unwilling," ... "refused" (01K OEXE~v ... . r.WEELTEv), "swore an oath" (dWlooUE... .Iyav 6pKov, 26) to remain a virgin. Even if archaic man finally describes choice as illusory, he can up to a point, like ourselves, think, talk, and act as though it were not. When eros does prove to be irresistible, whether as inner experience or as outer force, the attitude of the human actor determines accountability, as it does more formally later in Athenian law and in Aristotelian ethics. Calypso forced Odysseus to sleep with her, she willing, he unwilling (rrap' o01K OEX0wv &amp;00[XO -, Od. 5.155). And whatever "fate of the gods" (Oipct OECOv) bound (irTirEqE) Clytem- nestra that she should be "tamed" (&amp;8oivaL), Aegistheus led her to his house, both of them "willing" (Tiv&amp;' iehXwv ieiXovUrv, [Od. 3.269-272]) The story of these goddesses, then, has at least three functions that help illuminate the hymn's "celebration" of eros:8 it represents the trio as the exceptions that test the rule of the universality of the sexual instinct; it pointedly contrasts Aphrodite with exempla of committed virginity ("nor to aitiq9 Hestia were the works of Aphrodite pleasing"); and it introduces the language of "choice" and "pleasure" into the realm of preferred behaviour.'? These functions establish a context for what follows. Anchises and Aphro- dite fall in love with each other's godlike beauty, but that act of submission does not exhaust the meaning of eros nor even of erotic ananke. The affair can be said to begin with the long passage in which Aphrodite goes off to Cyprus to array herself in her finest attire and then completes her journey. The episode introduces and guides our responses to the erotic encounter. It 8Smith also shows how the three goddesses, even Artemis, exemplify the "social and institu- tional side of our experience" over against the world of natural and personal eros (32-37). 9Even if the author of the Fifth Hymn had called her ouo?ql, which she is called in the Sixth Hymn (1), the effect might have been less to defend her against a charge of wanton behaviour than to focus attention on the possible echo of TrL aix680i: cf. the pun between (?LXoREi6L-s and Xoto-iGr ls in Hes. Theog. 180, 194 (but see too M. L. West's rejection of a possible reference to ai8oiot at Theog. 194 in Hesiod: Theogony [Oxford 1966] 223). In fact, our poet wants oxmo-lq to focus the awe resident in virginity (Hestia, 21) and in the institution of marriage (Hera, 44), and so to bring out the contrast, "nor to arsoil Hestia were the works of Aphrodite pleasing (21)." That contrast contextually is between complementary realities and is not judgmental; Aphrodite is what she is, a universal force that requires no apologist. On aiLoo; see W. J. Verdenius, "Hesiod, Theogony 507-616," Mnemosyne4 24 (1971) 1-10, at 5. 'oThere are other indications in Greek literature that explicit sexual orientation (which the divine mirrors) is a matter not of genetics or environment or other kinds of constraint but of choice. In the Hippolytus, for example, Aphrodite accuses the frigid prince of deliberately rejecting her and so meriting his punishment (Hipp. 6, 14, 21, etc.). The meaning works on two levels: Hippolytus chooses not to perform ritual worship, but the ritual actions are in this instance acts of eros.</page><page sequence="5">THE HOMERIC HYMN TO APHRODITE 257 represents the goddess as beauty and grace, the embodiment of good and pleasurable sexuality symbolized by the Graces, the sanctuary, and the fra- grant altar, and, on her reaching Ida, draws attention not only to her power manifested in the mating of animals but also to the pleasure she takes in their sport. The seduction scene itself ironically matches goddess and mortal. It is also a variation on the traditional scene of nature fertility ritual. At the level of E4pWTLKJ iTTLOVupi, however, it is played out in terms of plausible human psychology." It includes elements of persuasive deception and self- deception. And it is notable how welcome both lovers find their condition. During the entire affair Aphrodite herself makes no mention of Zeus' com- pulsion, apart from her single and indirect allusion to KpOtTEp-' d&amp;1vyK-, and throughout expresses no unwillingness. What, then, of her appeal to KpotTEp XIvayKqi (130) and the editorial refer- ence to 0E(?v L'OrTTL KCi aOUt (166)? The hymn belongs to an era only a little later than that of Homer and Hesiod'2 so that the earlier meanings of vc~VcyKqi, OTTls, and atua establish controls for their meanings in the hymn. Several centuries ago Chapman translated line 130: "Necessity / With her steel strings, compelling me t' apply / To her high pow'r my will. "" But that lofty personification is not an archaic notion. Ananke in Homer means essentially "force," as applied by someone or something in the position of master over slave. Submission to such force is implicitly an unpleasant con- dition. That sense of ananke as "hateful constraint" is primary, for example, when Odysseus, in disguise, bids Eumaeus give him a guide into the city and there "I myself will wander cvaiyK-" (Od. 15.311 f.). The force in question is poverty, and the emphasis is on the beggar's state of dependency."14 i"On the sophisticated naturalism of the seduction scene, see Bickerman 237-241; Frankel 248; Smith 41: "psychologically natural . . . culturally expected." On the scene as a type of seduction, a variation of fertility ritual, see Sowa 68-82. 120n the dating of the hymn see K. Reinhardt, "Zum homerischen Aphroditehymnus," Festschrift Bruno Snell (Munich 1956), 385-393, passim, who argues for Homeric authorship, and the convincing counterarguments of Kamerbeek passim, Lenz passim, Smith 2-5. A Hesiodic or slightly post-Hesiodic date for the hymn seems most defensible (see especially Richard Janko, Homer, Hesiod and the Hymns [Cambridge 1982] ch. 8), although Van Eck would tentatively place the composition of the hymn in "the hey-day of Greek lyric poetry," 24. Cf. F. Solmsen, "Zur Theologie im grossen Aphroditehymnus," Hermes 88 (1960) 1-14. On Homeric parallels see P. G. Preziosi, "The Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite: An Oral Analysis," HSCP (1966) 171-204. Frinkel is no doubt right to argue (250) that "None of the hymns is tied to a ceremonial or harnessed to a cult;" they probably served as prooimia to the rhapsodic contests of epic song at a variety of divine festivals; cf. H. Hymn 6.19 f. (see Lenz 270). 13George Chapman, tr., Homeric Hymns and Epigrams (London 1616; reprinted 1888) 86. 14Occasionally ananke in Homer with the infinitive approaches the more generalized sense of "must" (equivalent to 8et or Xpri), as in the question T- TO-L CovdLyK-q / TrTWOrOrELv; (II. 5.634 f.) but even here the military context implies "what threat (of force) constrains you to cower?"

To one who accepts Milman Parry's theory of Homeric formulae without reservation, KpatTEp1 avryK-q is a metrically convenient alternative to civiyKiq, not a refinement. To one who does not, it is legitimate at least to make the case that the epithet accentuates the unpleasantness of the victim's bondage. KpaorTp6 means "powerful," "able to master" in a good or bad sense: of heroic qualities (e.g., II. 14.324), of strong feelings (Tp6opos, Xuiaaca, ios), of "tight" bonds (II. 5.386; Od. 8.336-the net Hephaestus throws over Ares and Aphrodite; cf. 360), of fire (Od. 11.220). In the Iliad, Hector predicts the day when Andromache will be led away to slavery, to work another's loom or bear water-w~ro iX' OiEKUO[OEVq, KpaTEP1i ' i~TTKEL'UET' v-yK q (II. 6.458), a phrase that combines the idea of subjection to another's power and deep resentment of that ignominious condition. In Hesiod Atlas holds up the broad heaven KpaTEPq &amp;Usr' &amp;vayKq4S (Theog. 517): Zeus is the master in this case, meting out painful punishment in a series of humiliations he inflicts on Menoetius, Atlas, and Prometheus. In the Cypria (fr. 7, Allen), KpaUEPq 1TrrO' &amp;vayKq expresses the revulsion with which Nemesis submitted to the embraces of the supreme god: so unwilling and ashamed was she, she fled over land and sea, changing her shape, doing everything possible to avoid the inevitable (412). The point of the formula in the tenth book of the Odyssey is the least clear. Odysseus tells Eurylochus that he must go to Circe's house despite the danger: Wairrp iy'v ELELL, KpaOTEP' 8E ot ITXETr' daVayKYq (Od. 10.273). It is a strange assertion, for which neither Odysseus nor the context offers a direct explanation. To what does he submit? The will of the gods, presumably, though we cannot read Vergilian fatum or Chapmanesque Necessity into the passage. Perhaps the very obliqueness here of the notion of "masterful necessity" as the will of the gods makes possible a complementary reading of the passage. As the exchange between Odysseus and Athena (Od. 13.296- 301) seems to imply, the will of the gods and the heroic will may at times be two sides of the same truth. The context of Odysseus' painful submission to force is one that also accentuates the hero's sterling qualities, the distance that separates the leader from his cowardly crew, men like Eurylochos whose "spirits were broken" when they recalled the deeds of Laestrygonians and Cyclops (10.198-200); Odysseus finally rejects Eurylochus' cowardly advice that they both flee now. Here is a disagreeable situation where divine force and heroic purpose seek the same goal. When Aphrodite admits the force of KpaTEp* i avyK-q in the Homeric Hymn, there is no doubt what that force is.

The larger audience will also remember that it was Zeus who forced her into her painful situation (Aphrodite ironically invokes the name of Zeus immediately after her reference to ananke!). But her complaint also expands our understanding of the works of eros embodied in the person and the acts of the goddess. She concocts the false tale of Hermes' KpOtTEPi &amp;vayK-K as a weapon of wilful erotic deceit. And at the same time she alludes to the kind of painful pressure that underlies all forms of submission, from the beggar's constrained circumstances (similarly fictitious, Od. 15.311), to the hero's resolve (Od. 10.273), to affairs of the heart, without in any instance elimin- ating the role played by choice, action, and attitude. Later in the poem, as the couple proceed irreversibly toward the consum- mation of their union, the poet refers to OEwv LOT-qTL KOM OtLU- (166). For Homer o6Td7s means "desire" or "will," usually, though not exclusively, of the gods. When attributed to mortals and to gods conceived "comically," that is, in their most human representation, it implies the unwelcome, even unnatural application of willpower: of Hera as a shameful mother (II. 18.396); of a bad woman (Od. 11.384), of the suitors (Od. 18.234). The will of the gods, on the other hand, however unpleasant for mortals, is beyond good and evil. A'Lc means "measure," especially as decreed by the gods (cf. AoS akra, II. 9.608, 17.321), and so shares much of the meaning of [oopa as "portion, " "due lot," "constraining limits," "cosmic necessity." The poet of the Homeric Hymn joins together, as Homer never does, OEiv 6Tos and (OECv) a t"a, a doubling up that (again, pace Milman Parry, where does the freedom to reshape traditional elements, the secret of the superior epic poet's craft, necessarily end?) creates a notable emphasis. We might compare Hesiod's 1v' 8aVUyK V / dLOV1TiTV OUv Xo Lv (WD 15-16). The phrases are roughly equivalent, divine 6oTrls and povX-i being particularly close in mean- ing. Furthermore, Hesiod's ananke is perhaps a little nearer to aEc than it ever is in Homer though it still carries the implication of painful submission to superior force, appropriate to the context of men who must wage evil war or suffer the consequences, for that is the way the world is. Hesiod seems to resort to the double-barrelled phrase-KpatTEp-pi aVayKq might have served the same end here-to emphasise and give authority to his impassioned claim 5 that mortals must favour Eris, strife, not only in the form of noble emulation but in the form also of "evil war and struggle: the latter no man loves, but he honours strife rIT' (av0tyK s / xv/ 0t0ot v ovX- Uauv." "1E. A.

At the level of narrative, the poet recalls Zeus' intention to humiliate Aphrodite, but the role and significance of Zeus range, as in Homeric epic, from "comic" idiosyncratic actor, affronted and vengeful, to the "cosmic" collective power and omniscience of the OEOi.16 Zeus' wilful trick becomes the expression of some cosmic plan, culminating in the moment when that most extraordinary of men, the hero, is conceived. And necessity not only bears on Aphrodite's situation as victim of Zeus' plan and on the larger intentions of that plan, it also informs the erotic experience of Anchises and so reflects an aspect of male psychology in the archaic age. For Anchises otla is the "necessary" moment of erotic consummation where all uncer- tainties end; where, in mythic terms, immortal and mortal" and all the states of body and mind they imply come together. It is a transfiguration, how- ever, that cannot last. Whatever else it does at this point, the hymn also finds in this moment of "compelled" climax the pivot between the male's precoital and postcoital experience of eros. Sexual submission, the finale to a sequence of largely joyous alternations of choice and reaction, proves finally to be the tragic prelude to a rude awakening and a painful reassessment. There are other, cogent explanations for the sense of loss that runs through the hymn after the sexual encounter of goddess and man; the sug- gestion, therefore, that postcoital disillusionment might be added to them is one to be advanced cautiously. But myths have many functions. It is not unreasonable to find that descriptions in myth of intercourse between un- usual partners are able to reflect deep-rooted human concerns of various kinds. Acts between divine males and human females are least complex. In all cases the "lover" takes the initiative and will prevail, whether seduction suffices or force becomes necessary. The sexually masterful god behaves as social norms expect all males to. On the other hand, a more complex psychology is likely to inform inter- course between female god and mortal man and between god and goddess. In the latter instance human fears can be projected onto others who are utterly different, in the former rationalized (who can be blamed for what a goddess may do to one?), and so in each case accommodated. What fears, and why such indirection? Fears, surely, of female erotic aggression and 16Cf. in the Iliad the shift from the deceived husband who hurls angry threats at Hera when he learns how she tricked him (II. 15.13-33) to the god of fate who weighs in golden scales the life and death of Hector and Achilles (22.209-212). On the Zeus motif in the Homeric Hymns see Lenz 31 f., 270. In the Hymn to Aphrodite the role of Zeus, offended and vengeful male in an erotic episode, may have been influenced by the role of Hephaestus in the lay of Demo- docus. The terms "cosmic" and "comic" were coined by G. M. Calhoun, in "Homer's Gods: Prolegomena," TAPA 68 (1937) 11-25, at 21. 17Among discussions of the theme of mortality and immortality, see Segal; Smith; Sowa 49 f., 80.</page><page sequence="9">THE HOMERIC HYMN TO APHRODITE 261 with it the loss of [ivos, of vital force, in all intercourse-fears that may have conflicted with archaic notions of virility and the honourable standing which virile confidence helped sustain. After they have made love, Anchises pleads with Aphrodite that he not be left ci.[vLqv6v for the rest of his life (188). Anne Giacomelli has most skilfully confirmed that the epithet must mean "sexually impotent," dried out with the loss of pivos, the vital fluid of procreation. She emphasizes that the danger is sex with a goddess, of the kind that threatens to render Odysseus civivopa (Od. 10.301). The threat is the confounding of mortal and immortal spheres.'8 But all acts of love result in loss of Livos; cf. Archilochus, [XEV]K6v c4tlKoa UEvos (Cologne Epode 52). And some are so described as to empha- sise the theme of delight changing, after intercourse, to darker moods. We turn to the evidence of Homer. Aphrodite awakens Anchises to impart information. This is a familiar motif (see Smith 64), but a special kind of sleep can invest a passage with special significance. There are passages in Homer which refer in sequence to night, bedlove, and dawn (cf. Od. 5.225 ff.). In a few passages postcoital sleep plays a role. Most pertinent for our present purpose are episodes involving gods in their more "comic" guise: Zeus and Hera in the Iliad and Poseidon and the mortal nymph Tyro in the Odyssey. Both episodes seem to have influenced the poet of the Homeric Hymn.19 In the Odyssey (11.241- 252) the god Poseidon lies with Tyro, seals her eyes in sleep, then announces the coming birth of their child. However useful this pattern was for the poet of the Fifth Hymn, it suggested to him no aspects of male sexual experience itself. In the Iliad the god Sleep, approached a second time by Hera to help her deceive Zeus, recalls the earlier occasion when Zeus awoke from his slumber to discover how Hera had tricked him, taking advantage of his somnolent condition to slip away and attack Heracles (Iliad 14.242-261). On the second occasion, Zeus' "submission to sleep and sex" (353) improves Poseidon's chance to help the Trojans and so to further Hera's own inter- ests. In the earlier passage "Zeus awoke, angry . . " and Sleep was saved from Zeus' wrath only by the intervention of Night "whom Zeus feared to offend" (261). The passage underlines the perils of sex-sleep-night for a male seduced into submission by an erotic female. But also of importance is the change in the awakening male's state of mind, in these passages a change 18A. Giacomelli, "Aphrodite and After," Phoenix 34 (1980) 2-19. The fear of castration might be relevant here. Giacomelli (13) notes Ares' fear that a wound to "the lowest part of the belly" (II. 5.885-887) might result in loss of menos. Hesiod links Aphrodite directly to cas- trated genitals in the account of her birth (Theog. 200); he also presents her as a more general- ised, mystified image of sex as the human game of smiles, whispers, and deceit (Theog. 205). 19On these passages see Podbielski 50-58; Van Eck 55.

In the later episode, Zeus says with a scowl: "Unmanageable one, your ill-contriving deception [has caused these evils]" (15.14-16). He will make her give up her deceptions by reminding her of his power to punish: "see if lovemaking will aid you then, how you slept with me and deceived me" (15.31-33). Each passage in fact depicts a male's progress from precoital illusion, manufactured by an erotically deceptive female, to postcoital sleep, finally to an awakening to rude reality and a sense of loss. The Homeric Hymn too shifts through its centre from a dreamlike experience of anticipated bliss to a harsh reckoning with reality. But where the supreme god awakes on his own and responds with outbursts of anger, Anchises, a mere mortal deceived by the divine, is roused by a god and resorts to fearful lament when confronted with the reality of his situation. Affairs between female gods and mortal men are potentially richer ground for psychological insight. During the seduction scene Anchises indulges in hopes of a favorable future for himself-for prosperity (Ei 6yELv, 105) and for a pleasant old age, and he also indulges in the almost romantic fancy that death would be an acceptable barter for a moment's joy with his beautiful consort. The passage combines, with psy- chological plausibility, a willingness to be so deceived on the one hand and on the other imagery of a mind-clouding sexual passion so strong he would willingly die to consummate it. Awakening to somber truth, he now must accept as certain what previously he had refused to admit, namely that the beautiful girl is in fact an Olympian who could unman him (an appalling threat to a Greek male) and also that he faces a bleak future culminating in a painful old age. "I knew you were a goddess," he laments, "but you deceived me" (186).20 Joyful trust yields once again to the realization that the male has been deceived in sex; but the accompanying emotion now is not anger but fear, together with a sense of irremediable loss. Not that Aphrodite "triumphs" here as Hera does in the Iliad; she is eros, and as such her own anthropomorphic experience extends the meaning of human experience, including the postcoital sense of loss.21 Part of what distinguishes this scene of divinity revealed from other examples of the type is precisely the goddess' mortification, her ambivalence in both wanting Anchises (241 f.) and yet feeling that she herself, used to compelling, deceiv- ing, and humiliating, has herself been compelled, deceived, and humiliated in the strange process of erotic conquest. Her epiphany as true prophet is in marked contrast with her disguise as false prophet; not only does fiction yield to truth, but pleasure yields to pain. Only during her true prophecy does she refer to the unpleasant consequences of her affair with Anchises, 20Sowa points out that Anchises asks only for mortal goods and gets exactly what he asked for (51). What changes is his perception of their worth. 21Sowa sees reflected in Aphrodite's shame and humiliation the condition of the woman after marriage, her "death" and emergence as a different person (42).</page><page sequence="11">THE HOMERIC HYMN TO APHRODITE 263 the point of her lament here being, at least on one level, to reflect human experience by emphasising the gulf between the hope of extended, even timeless joy glimpsed briefly in sexual congress, and the painful accommod- ation that must follow to such timebound realities as aging and dying (cf. 241-246). According to Herodotus (2.53), Homer and Hesiod played a large part in the formulation of the Greek pantheon. They were "teachers," who both transmitted and developed the traditional myths as sources of "informa- tion," including the gods as embodiments of the world as human beings experience it and invest it with meaning and value.22 No other Greek god, with the possible exceptions of Dionysus and Ares, represents so sharply focussed an experience as Aphrodite, goddess of eros. Her erga, therefore, mean both the "deeds of the goddess," the famous episodes in which she is leading actress, but also the "works of eros," erotic experience in the lives of human actors.23 Appropriate epithets help focus these different works, but in the last analysis the entire narrative of the Homeric Hymn constitutes her erga. On one level the hymn "celebrates" the erga of Aphrodite by narrating her adventures, involving her submission to the vengeance of a jealous Zeus, her mating with a mortal, and her conception of a hero. On another, it "celebrates" her by unifying discrete but not anomalous levels of the archaic vision of love. Especially noteworthy among studies of love in the Hymn to Aphrodite is Bickerman's demonstration of the extent to which the hymn both reflects contemporary courting practices and turns them into the stuff of romantic idealization. The present paper has focussed on the complemen- tary roles of choice, action, attitude, and compulsion as they give shape to the pattern of precoital passion, consummation, conception, and postcoital awakening in the archaic erotic experience. The heart of the pattern is the still centre, the moment of consummation represented as the perceived absorption of the timebound mortal into the timeless immortal. The aftermath of that union makes it increasingly clear that, to his sorrow, the only form of immortality mortal man can truly know is perpetuation of the species. And so not least for this reason the final mood of the celebration of Aphrodite is somber. The hymn has its moments of charming humour in its reduction of the goddess to victim of her own eros24 and in the masking of her as rrc~pOEvos 8i86rlq.

At the end of the goddess' journey from Cyprus to Ida she observes and "rejoices in" the coupling of wild animals (69-74). Ida, of course, is "mother of beasts," and the passage reminds us of Aphrodite's cosmic power as a goddess of fertility (Sowa 82). It also emphasises the joyfulness of sexual union and reflects seductive Aphrodite's own feelings at this moment. Final- ly, its account of beasts mating serves implicitly as a contrastive prelude to the human experience that follows immediately. For these beasts erotic ananke is simple and merely joyful; they have no choices to make, no experience of past and future, no knowledge of mortality, no balance sheet of illusion and reality. Not true for them that post coitum omne animal triste. The human male, on the other hand, once willingly or unwillingly seduced, proceeds fitfully through the hopes, doubts, fears, and joys of the ritual of courtship until he is irreversibly sunk in the delights of erotic ananke. Thereafter he must turn to thoughts of endangered manhood and the claims of his mortal destiny.26 311 FOUNDERS COLLEGE, YORK UNIVERSITY, TORONTO M3J 1P3. 25The tone of the hymn becomes increasingly solemn. Among the touches that help deepen the hymn's theme of mortality are Hermes' funereal associations. He appears first as the fictitious sender of Aphrodite to Anchises, prompting Anchises to comment, "If you came through Hermes, immortal guide (8LtKT6pov), I would go to Hades if I could sleep with you" (147-154). Later, Hermes turns up as the messenger of the bitter-sweet fortunes of Tithonus, who will be deathless but age forever (220--224). 26See J. Fontenrose on the motif of women who bring disaster to males (Python [Berkeley, Calif. 1959] 107 f., 169 f., 406); also P.
