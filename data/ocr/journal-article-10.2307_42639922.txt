Despite this pivotal position, archaeological information for the region is scarce due to limited investigations, limited publication and the multilingual nature of publications. Consequently, little archaeological information about western New Guinea has percolated into the mainstream literature. This paper aims to fill this gap and provides a detailed review of archaeological research, including rock art, published in Dutch, English, French, German and Indonesian. The resultant findings are discussed in terms of continuities and discontinuities with Papua New Guinea and Island Southeast Asia.

In this review of the fragmentary archaeological evidence, we demonstrate that wNG has long been the frontier between Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) and Melanesia (Fig. 1). Interactions between wNG and islands further west are not only documented histori- cally, they extend backwards over thousands of years into the Holocene (up to 1 1 ,500 years ago) and potentially into the Pleistocene (over 11,500 years ago). Evidence of these interactions includes the westward transport from New Guinea of marsupials to Wallacea (a term used to describe a group of Indonesian islands separated by deep water from the Asian and Australian continents) during the Terminal Pleistocene and early Holocene (White 2004; O'Connor 2007), and of bananas and other plants to ISEA during the early- to-mid Holocene (Denham 2010, 2011; Denham and Donohue 2009; Donohue and Den- ham 2009, 2010; Perrier et al. 2011). Additionally, cultural interaction between wNG and Wallacea dating to at least the mid-Holocene has been demonstrated through elements of shared material culture (Bulbeck 2008) and rock art motifs (Ballard 1992; Specht 1979); and inferred through linguistic trails of Papuan languages into Wallacea (Wurm et al. 1975; Wurm and Hattori 1981; Mahdi 1994a, 1994b; Donohue and Denham 2010) and genetic traces from ISEA to Melanesia (Soares et al. 2011). All these interactions pre-date the putative arrival of Austronesian language speakers in the region (e.g. Spriggs 2011). This review is deliberately restricted to the archaeological record, and largely excludes genetic, linguistic and palaeoecological data, except to augment discussion. Due to the paucity and multilingual nature of the published archaeological record, wNG is often overlooked in macroscale interpretations of long-term history. Consequently, the primary aim of this review is to clarify the archaeological record for wNG, using sources in Dutch, English, French, German and Indonesian. By drawing together disparate archaeo- logical data, it is possible to consider the long-term history of wNG with respect to ISEA Fig. 1 West Papua's place in Island South East Asia â Springer</page><page sequence="3">J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 27 (looking westward) and Melanesia (looking eastward), thereby showing the liminal status of wNG over the long term as the land in-between. It remains to be seen whether wNG's long-term history is similar to that of the eastern half of the island (Papua New Guinea), or to the regions it abuts, namely, Island Melanesia or ISEA. For example, Lapita pottery in the Bismarck Archipelago is generally considered to be a local, dentate- stamped innovation, derived from red-slipped pottery in ISEA (Bellwood 2009), although more direct antecedents in ISEA may now have been identified (Spriggs 201 1). The earliest Lapita pottery is limited to the Bismarck Archipelago and does not occur on mainland New Guinea until after its dispersal to Remote Oceania (McNiven et al. 2011; Denham et al. 2012). It is anticipated that Lapita pottery or a red-slipped antecedent may well be found in wNG given its proximity to and hypothesised interaction with Wallacea during the mid-Holocene. Following short sections introducing the geography and palaeogeography of wNG, the history of the region is briefly reviewed. This historical context precedes a detailed pre- sentation of archaeological investigations and finds in wNG. The last part of the paper discusses the archaeological finds within their regional contexts, with specific reference to long-term interactions of wNG, ISEA and Papua New Guinea. Geography and Palaeogeography Western New Guinea can be divided geographically into the north and south lowlands, the central highlands and the Bird's Head Peninsula (Fig. 2). The central highlands dominate Fig. 2 Surveyed and excavated sites discussed in this paper â Springer</page><page sequence="4">28 J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 the geography of New Guinea, extending more than 1600 km from east to west and frequently exceeding 4000 m in height (Sutton et al. 2009); they include the highest peak on the island, Mt. Jaya, and its glaciers (Hope 1976). The northern lowlands include lower- altitude mountain ranges, not exceeding 2000 m (Muller 2006). The Bird's Head Peninsula (named after its shape) is attached to the main body of the island at its western extreme by a narrow strip of land (Tan 2008). Climates and biogeography reflect New Guinea's equatorial position, as well as its topography and its tectonic connection with Australia rather than ISEA. The central mountain range acts as a barrier to prevailing winds, ensures a steady supply of orographic rainfall, and provides a rare example of equatorial snow and glaciers (Muller 2006, p. 6). Glacial environments are restricted to the highest altitudes, above c. 4600 m. These mountains are divided by fast flowing rivers, deep gorges and valleys (e.g. the Baliem Valley at c. 1600 m), with extensive areas of bog and swamp (Fairbairn et al. 2006). Mountains on the north and west sides of the central ranges are covered by thick rainforest with warm and humid climates year-round. The southern and northern lowlands contain extensive wetlands, rainforests, grasslands and coastal mangroves. The lowlands are generally hot and humid; the south coast has strong winds and heavy rain from April to October, while the rest of the island experiences these conditions from November to March. In these latter regions, the dry season typically runs from May to October. Micro-climates exist throughout the region, orographic effects dominate in some montane valleys, and rainfall can persist throughout the year (Me Al pine et al. 1983; Mitton 1983). Large tracts of New Guinea are susceptible to droughts, with resultant food shortages and landscapes susceptible to burning, during El Niño years (Grove and Chappell 2000). The biogeography and physical geography of wNG have undergone significant changes during the Quaternary. Prior to 12,000 years ago wNG was connected to the Aru Islands and Australian continent, while the Moluccan Islands of Halmahera and Seram were separated from Papua by a deep strait (O'Connor and Aplin 2007, p. 86). This divide is reflected in the distribution of fauna and flora and has major archaeological implications for human dispersal in the region (e.g. Bone 1958; Morwood and Jüngers 2009). During the subsequent period of inundation, around 12,000-10,000 years ago, the Aru Islands became separate from wNG. After 8500 years ago the shallow Berau Gulf and Bintuni Bay flooded (Geyh et al. 1979; Fairbanks 1989). Marine inundation of the western part of the Fly-Digul Platform occurred around 6000 years ago, with subsequent fluvial deposition to form the present-day broad and swampy lowlands (Chappell 2005). Two aspects of palaeogeography are particularly relevant to an understanding of regional archaeology: vegetation history with interlinked fire records; and megafaunal extinctions. Palaeoecological investigations have been conducted at multiple locations in the lowlands and highlands of wNG (Haberle et al. 2001; Hope 2007). Of greatest sig- nificance have been: the existence of burning, interpreted as representing the presence of people, in the highlands from at least 32,500 years ago (Hope 1998); intensified burning patterns during the Holocene, representative of the formation of an agricultural landscape during the early Holocene in the Baliem Valley (Haberle et al. 1991; Haberle 2003); and intensified burning and vegetation change from the mid-to-late Holocene in most lowland and upland locales (Haberle et al. 2001). In many respects, the patterns of vegetation history, landscape change and land use are similar to those in Papua New Guinea (Hope and Haberle 2005). Extinct megafaunal finds have been reported from caves and river terraces in the highlands of wNG (Hope 1998; Hope and Aplin 2007; Hope et al. 1993; Flannery 1992; â Springer</page><page sequence="5">J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 29 1999). The extinct taxa include two previously unreported large marsupials, Maokopia ronaldi and Protemnodon hopei (Hope et al. 1993). Although the contexts of the megafaunal finds were not systematically excavated and are poorly dated, Hope et al. (1993) speculated that they post-date 40,000 years ago and correspond to the earliest human presence in the highlands. Historical Overview The long-term history of wNG, especially the region's place in ISEA and Melanesia, is best evaluated through a consideration of its recent history. Western New Guinea's history has been described as 'a subtle blending of every culture that ever invaded it - Chinese, Indian, Melanesian, Portuguese, Polynesian, Arabian, English and Dutch' (Galis 1953; see also Kamma 1947-1948; and Timmer and Ballard 2002). In line with Galis (1953), the period of written history can be divided into three broad phases: 1) The pre-colonial period (before 1500 AD) 2) Trade, expansion and increased European involvement (1500 to 1880 AD) 3) Period of colonial settlement (1880 AD to present) The Pre-colonial Period (before 1500 AD) Trade in bird-of-paradise plumes, spices, betel nut, metal, glass beads and pottery has linked wNG to ISEA for at least 2000 years (Spriggs 1998; Spriggs et al. 2005; Swadling 1996). After AD 300, a decrease in demand for plumes led to a shift towards spices and aromatic woods, with Timor and the Banda Islands becoming important centres (Swadling 1996, p. 273). By the 12th century, commerce involving spices and bird-of-paradise plumes had escalated between wNG and ISEA, ultimately stimulated by increased demand from Eurasia (Andaya 2001; Ellen and Glover 1974; Galis 1953). One of the first historical records about New Guinea was written by an Arab called Mas'udi (cited by Galis 1953, p. 7) who mentions the 'sea of China or Sandji which is at the edge of the world'. This was later identified by G.P. Rouffaer as the Djenggi or Papuan Sea (Wichmann 1917). Chinese sources (Krom 1926, p. 306, cited in Galis 1953, p. 11) from about 1200 AD identify two states in the Indonesian archipelago, Srivijaya and East Java (which contained New Guinea). The first direct reference to wNG occurs in The Nãgara-krtãgama', a Javanese poem by Prapañca dating to 1365. In Song 14, Verse 4, the poet records an area including Onin, Sergile (possibly Sekar on the north coast of Onin Peninsula) and Seram, ruled by the monarch of East Java (Rouffaer 1915, p. 643, cited in Galis 1953, p. 7). By the 13th and 14th centuries Buddhist and Hindu missionaries were visiting wNG in search of converts (Suter 1997, p. 7). By the 14th century, Islam had entered the Moluccas and the western edge of New Guinea (Lape 2000; Suter 1997, p. 7). Trade Expansion and Increased European Involvement (1500-1880 AD) In the 16th century, trading attracted the Molluccan sultan of Ternate (in the Maluku islands) to wNG with rajas ('princes' in the Indonesian language) and kapitans (military/ political appointments) established on New Guinea (Miedema 1994). The sultan of Bacan Springer</page><page sequence="6">30 J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 (aligned with Ternate) reigned over northern Seram, the Raja Ampat group (Misool, Salawati, Waigeo, Batanta) and Onin (Galis 1953, p. 11; Swadling 1996, p. 33). Jesuit priests in the area recorded in 1565 that the sultan of Bacan (south of Tidore) had appointed Indonesian and wNG representatives as rajas and kapitans on the islands of Misool, Salawati and Waigeo in wNG (Swadling 1996, p. 33). Rajas were established on the Onin Peninsula at Rumbati, Patipi (5 km from Rumbati), Kokas, Ogar, Sekar, Ati-Ati (uncertain provenance) and Goras (Miedema 1994). The rajas ensured regular production and collection of plumes, slaves, scented masoi bark, trepang (sea cucumber) and other valuable products demanded by the sultans. These were exchanged for ceremonial cloths (kain timur), beads ( manik-manik), batiks and small coins (Swadling 1996). Regionally distinct trade items were Chinese and Indian silks and cottons; Chinese porcelain; Javanese sugar, sago and rice; ironware from Billiton (in Bungku), Karimata and Tobungku (in eastern Sulawesi); iron axes, swords and knives from the Banggai Archipelago and eastern Sulawesi, and gold and silver jewelry from north Sulawesi (Miedema and Reesink 2004, p. 177; Swadling 1996, p. 31). In 1606, Captain Don Diego de Prado y Tovar observed the use of a bellows to work harpoons in Triton Bay (Stevens and Barwick 1930) with smiths located at Dorei in Cenderawasih Bay and probably Berau Gulf (Swadling 1996, p. 282). By the 17th century the power of Ternate had declined as Tidore (also in the Maluku islands) ascended. Bintuni Bay (an inner bay of Berau Gulf) was recorded as a region of intensive, internal trade connections between the Berau area to the west and the Cenderawasih Bay area to the east (Miedema 1994, p. 123; Miedema and Reesink 2004, p. 182). The Berau region 'served as a storehouse for the south coast peoples who sailed in their outrigger canoes to the north coast where they obtained sago for their own wrought-iron and textile products' (Kooijman 1962, p. 77). In the 17th and 18th centuries rajas from Onin traded with and plundered the Bird's Head, central Mimika (Pouwer 1999, p. 160), Bedidi, Bomberai and Kasuri (Sollewijn-Gelpke 1994; Timmer and Ballard 2002). Kooijman (1962, p. 77) suggests that a 'colonial relationship' developed between the Onin 'states' and their trade partners. As demand for spices, especially, increased in the 16th century, European traders began to negotiate with the sultans of Tidore and Ternate. Portuguese captains, Antonio ď Abreu and Francesco Serrano, were supposedly the first Europeans to sight New Guinea's shores in 1511 (Pouwer 1999, p. 159). In 1526 Don Jorge De Menezes was wrecked near the Bird's Head, possibly near Warsai (Galis 1953, p. 8) or on the island of Waigeo (Whittaker et al. 1975, p. 182). By this time the name Papua was already in use (Whittaker et al. 1975, p. 183). In 1528 Alvaro de Saavedra Ceron stayed a month on Ambai (part of Yapen) island in Papua New Guinea with 'naked blacks' who already knew iron implements (Galis 1953, p. 10). In 1545 a Spanish sailor Ortiz De Retez sailed the north coast of New Guinea claiming lands for the Spanish Crown. He named the mainland Neuva Guinea , due to his perception of the inhabitants as resembling Africans from Guinea (Pouwer 1999, p. 159). In approximately 1582, Miguel Roxo de Brito (cited in Sollewijn-Gelpke 1994) sailed in search of gold from the Raja Ampat islands to the Bird's Head Peninsula. On Misool, Miguel Roxo de Brito described 'four thousand people living under a King whom they have elected ... I did not see a single person among all of them, unless it was a slave, who was not wearing gold ear-pieces' (Sollewijn-Gelpke 1994, p. 130). In the Berau gulf, Roxo de Brito encountered 'a hundred and sixty ships' (presumably outrigger trading canoes) Ô Springer</page><page sequence="7">J World Prehist (20 1 3) 26:25-73 3 1 whose occupants (people from 'Rumberpon Island' in Cenderawasih Bay) were returning from a raid on Gébé Island to obtain iron gongs. These people had no use for gold but relied instead on iron, [coconut] palms, rice, chickens and pigs (Sollewijn-Gelpke 1994, p. 136). Firepower and prisoners were used by Roxo de Brito and most likely other 'traders' to obtain Papuan 'gold and gongs and cloth' (1581-1582, cited in Sollewijn- Gelpke 1994, p. 136). The first Dutch ship visited New Guinea in 1602 (Whittaker et al. 1975, p. 183). The Dutch intended to use the island, particularly wNG, for docking ships from the Dutch East India Company ( Vereenigde Oost Indische Compagnie , VOC). They viewed the location as strategic in protecting their trade from pirating and for resisting British and Spanish influence. Limited efforts were made by Dutch missions to document and record the land and people, few incursions were made into the interior. Notable Dutch explorations included Jansz in 1605, Carstenz in 1623, Pool in 1636 and Keyts in 1678 (Whittaker et al. 1975, pp. 196-202). Increased British presence in New Guinea and Australia in the later 18th century encouraged renewed Dutch interest. In 1780 the British established a fort in Dorch Bay, near present Manokwari, in an effort to secure a firm hold in the Moluccas. In 1 828, the Dutch claimed the south coast west of the 141 st meridian, constructing their first fort, Fort de Bus , near present day Lobo village at Triton Bay (Arifin and Delanghe 2004, p. 98). In 1848 they also claimed the north coast, east up to Humboldt Bay. Amid rumours of the construction of a new British fort on the south coast, the Dutch claimed sovereignty of the western half of the island as Dutch New Guinea in 1875 (Pouwer 1999). In the late 19th century European activity in Dutch New Guinea was limited to missionary stations, the first of these erected by Ottouw and Geissler of the German Grossner Society at Dorch Bay on Mansinam Island, near Manokwari, in 1855 (van Baal et al. 1984; Pouwer 1999, p. 161). Period of Colonial Settlement (1880 AD - present) Britain and Germany recognized Dutch claims to wNG in treaties of 1885 and 1895. As violence escalated (primarily through raiding parties of Marind-anim, known as Togeri, in the south) and European trade interests increased in wNG, the Dutch government erected permanent trading posts at Manokwari (on the north coast of wNG) in 1 898, and Fakfak (on the Onin peninsula) in 1902 (Galis 1953, p. 38; Pouwer 1999, p. 161). A government patrol post was also opened in February 1902 at Merauke in southern New Guinea (Galis 1953, p. 38). After 1890, scientific interest increased, with expeditions from government posts to Lake Sentani (Doherty in 1 892), Humboldt and Cenderawasih Bays (Professor A. Wichmann in 1903) and the southwest coast (the Lorentz expedition in 1907; Galis 1953, p. 59). Mission activities intensified after 1905, with Christianity effectively imposed on communities in wNG (Galis 1953, p. 59; Pouwer 1999, p. 161). Administrative works by the Dutch were interrupted by World War I and the Great Depression of thel930s. From the 1930s new administrative posts were established and new surveys initiated, including aerial mapping of wNG. The outbreak of World War II saw a decline in Dutch interests in their colony, which ended in 1942 following Japanese occupation of New Guinea from the north coast as far south as Agats. The Japanese were expelled by Allied forces in 1944, and headquarters were established near Hollandia (now Jayapura) for operations against the Japanese in the Philippines. The Dutch regained possession of wNG in 1945 and granted Papua self-determination in 1952. Western New Guinea was annexed by Indonesia under the controversial 'Act of Free Choice' in 1969. The Indonesian government implemented a resettlement policy from Springer</page><page sequence="8">32 J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 other areas in Indonesia to this province, often referred to as a transmigration policy. By 1985 an estimated 300,000 to 400,000 Javanese migrants had entered the country, leading to concerns from nationalist Papuans that their culture was being diluted (Pouwer 1999, p. 174). In 2001 the western portion of this province (including the Bird's Head Peninsula and offshore islands) was designated semi-autonomous by the Indonesian government (King 2004). The provincial government adopted the name West Irian Jaya in 2002, which changed in 2007 to West Papua (Papua Barat). This paper uses the geographically-derived and politically neutral term 'western New Guinea' (wNG). History of Archaeological Research Until 1980, archaeological research in wNG was restricted to surveys of rock art (Galis 1950, 1954, 1956, 1957a, 1957b, 1957c, 1957d, 1960, 1961, 1964; Röder 1938a, 1938b; 1939a, 1940a, 1940b, 1956, 1959); stone monuments (Galis 1957d; Riesenfeld 1950; Sœjono 1963, p. 4); stone forts (Galis 1964; Röder 1940b, 1959); and burial sites (Galis 1964; Röder 1940a, 1959) (Fig. 2). Further incidental finds included ceramic scatters, stone flake scatters, axes, mortars, pestles, bronze objects and Dong Son drums (discussed below; De Bruyn 1959, 1962; Elmberg 1959; Galis 1964; van der Sande 1907; Soejono 1963). Published excavations occurred in the Berau Gulf (Röder 1940a, 1959 - summarised in Ellen and Glover 1974, Fig. 3); Bird's Head Peninsula (Solheim 1978); Lake Sentani (De Bruyn 1959, 1962); and Humboldt Bay (Miller 1950). Less well-documented excavations were recorded at Kaboei Bay, Padwa and Lake Sentani (Solheim 1979), and at an Fig. 3 Western New Guinea including major survey areas discussed in the text Ô Springer</page><page sequence="9">J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 33 undisclosed location in the central highlands (Galis 1964, p. 2). Exposed soil profiles containing archaeological material were recorded and sampled at Mapala and Hamid rockshelters on Mount Jaya (Hope and Hope 1976). From 1980 to 2010 archaeological research remained sporadic, concentrating on the Bird's Head Peninsula (Pasveer 1998, p. 70, 2004; Pasveer et al. 2002; Solheim 1998) and Jayapura district (Simunjuntak 1996, 1998; Soejono 1963; Fig. 3). Surveys in the Tutari hills (near Sentani/Jayapura) were instigated by the Pusat Penelitian Arkeologi Nasional office in 1997 (Simunjuntak 1998, p. 943). A comprehensive survey of rock art in wNG was undertaken and published by Karina Arifin and Philippe Delanghe (2004). Archaeo- logical excavations were conducted near Makbon in September 1990 (Solheim 1998) and the Ayamaru Lakes in 1995 (Aplin 1998; Jelsma 1998; Pasveer 1998, p. 70, 2004; Pasveer and Aplin 1998; Pasveer et al. 2002). Review articles about wNG include Galis (1964); Pasveer (2010); Soejono (1963) and Spriggs (1998). Systematic archaeological research is rare in wNG. Archaeological excavations fre- quently lack section drawings, radiocarbon dates or detailed description of materials (Miller 1950; Solheim 1998). In at least two instances excavated materials and field notes have been lost in transit or destroyed prior to analysis (Miller 1950; Röder 1959). In other instances the analysis of materials is incomplete or largely unpublished (Simunjuntak 1998; Solheim 1998). Systematic excavations were undertaken at Dudumunir Cave on Arguni, however, no cultural materials, site plans or stratigraphie drawings survive because they were destroyed by Allied bombing of Germany during World War II (Röder 1940a, 1959). Only two sites (Tóe and Kria Caves) in the whole of wNG provide robust chrono- stratigraphic data, although unsystematic methods were employed during excavation (see below; Pasveer 2004). The archaeological record of wNG is too fragmented to be presented chronologically or thematically. Consequently, it is presented according to coarse methodological groupings: archaeological surveys, excavations, incidental finds, rock art, and ethno-archaeology. Onin and Berau Gulf In February 1937, a group of researchers from the Forschungsinstitut für Kulturmor- phologie (now the Frobenius-Institut) of the University of Frankfurt was sent to Seram, in the Malluca islands, before relocating in August to the southern shoreline of the Berau Gulf. The Frobenius expedition was headed by Dr. A. E. Jensen and it included Dr. H. Niggemeyer, A. Hahn (artist and painter) and Dr. J. Röder. Röder (1939a, 1940a, 1959) surveyed burial caves, settlement sites (including fortified settlements) and rock art sites in the Berau Gulf (Fig. 4). Röder (1959, pp. 39, 46) believed that a settlement shift occurred from caves to fortified villages ( kotas ) due to the increased pressure/influence of Seramese migrants from the west. This transition occurred at Bisu- rikatak on Ogar and at Arguni, Fior, Furir, Darembang and Goras (Röder 1959, p. 46). Röder (1959, pp. 80-82) noted two types of burial in the region: under simple stone cairns, with stones marking the head and feet (e.g. Sosorra cave in Furir village); and interment of individuals in caves (frequently adorned with rock art and containing grave goods). Cairn burial was expected to have arrived with Islam several centuries ago, while cave burial may be of greater antiquity, and continued until the 19th century (Röder 1959, p. 56). Cave burials were observed at Mampogo and Risatot on Arguni Island, Bisurikatak cave on Ogar Island and Capes Tapore, Damir, Taba, Duri, Sorraa and Abba on the north coast of Onin (Röder 1959, p. 56). Pottery and rock art were frequently associated with burial places on the north coast of Berau (Röder 1959, p. 59). At Mapoga (Mampoga) a ^ Springer</page><page sequence="10">34 J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 Fig. 4 North coast of Onin Peninsula (Berau Gulf) including Arguni Island. Illustration developed after Arifin and Delanghe (2004, p. 54) large earthenware pot was observed to contain the bones of a child and a hornbill turtle (Röder 1959, p. 59). Burial shelters were occasionally associated with wooden carvings of ancestor figures, called Korwar, Korvar, or Maro , which were 'present at each of the life transition ceremonies such as birth or marriage' (van Baaren 1968, p. 22, cited in Ballard et al. 2003, p. 392). Burials were also associated with stone adzes, boat building tools, raised burial platforms, burial canoes and imported materials (e.g. Chinese ceramics and beads, and an Indonesian bronze plate) (Kooijman 1962; Röder 1959, pp. 64-66). Röder (1959, p. 65) was informed by Dr Liau of the Chinese institute in Frankfurt that Chinese ceramics from Risatot dated from the first half of the 15th century to the beginning of the 18th century. At Dudumunir, Chinese ceramics date to the 19th century, supporting continued use of cave burials into the recent period (Röder 1959, p. 65). The presence of boat-shaped coffins and boat-shaped stone enclosures, as well as boat motifs in rock art, has elsewhere been interpreted as evidence for the ritualization of ships in wNG (Ballard et al. 2003; Röder 1956, 1959, pp. 68-69). Boat shaped coffins are recorded throughout mainland and ISEA, often in metal age sites attributed to the East Asian Dong Son culture (Ballard et al. 2003; van Liem 2005, p. 1 17). Similar ship motifs (especially prow and stern finials) have been recorded in Flores and East Timor (Lape et. al. 2007; O'Connor 2003). Previously, rajas and kapitans built defensive settlements with limestone rampart or walls on the southern shore of the Berau Gulf. Sisir village, close to Kokas, contained deserted houses and 'two stone fortifications' (van der Crab 1864, p. 52). At Sisir, Strauch (1877, p. 18) observed 'a smooth and perpendicular wall made by human hands', mea- suring approximately 8 m high and 10 m long. Fortifications were also observed at Fuum, Ota, Furir and the Ogar Islands (Galis 1964, p. 261; Pou wer 1999, p. 160; Röder 1939c, 1959, pp. 47-55). These sites, referred to as kota by the 'Malays' or otem by the 'Papuans' consisted of stone (often semi-circular) walls and towers, intended as a defense against firing weapons (Röder 1959, p. 51). These villages were abandoned because of 'the more peaceful atmosphere created during the Dutch colonial period' (Arifin and Delanghe 2004, p. 60). Similar forts have been recorded in East Timor (Lape and Chin- Yung 2008) and the Aru Islands (Veth et al. 2000).

W. van Eek made a tour of the Karon region of northern Bird's Head. He identified 'small flat stones planted upright in the ground' to the south of Pef village, on Tembe Mounain (Galis 1964, p. 7). The same officer later reached Jabou village (provenance uncertain) and noted two stone arrangements: 'the first consists of a collection of stones with strange shapes (some are round, others are oblong, and a few have numerous holes)' (Galis 1964, p. 7). No mention was made of the function, names or origins of these monuments. In 1975-1976 surveys of the far western region revealed archaeological sites on the mainland and adjacent Gag and Mé Islands (Solheim 1978, 1979, 1985, 1998; Solheim and Arnold 1977). Mé Island, previously a leper colony run by the Indonesian Government, contained a shrine at the base of a limestone cliff with a carved wooden korwar image, large triton shell, human skull fragment and an old bronze gong (Solheim 1998, p. 38). A second site was visited on a small (unnamed) island at the northeast end of Kaboei Bay. This burial cave contained individuals on 'bed-like platforms', wooden chests, coffins, porcelain, stoneware and other artefacts. An important site is Jembekaki fort on the north coast of Batanta Island (Galis 1964, p. 24; Soejono 1963, p. 8). At Jembekaki there were two parallel walls, approximately 900 pot sherds, 'pestles, hammer-stones, stone ornaments, the fragment of a bronze spear point mould, small cooking pots, fragments of big urns, slates and other remnants of bronze raw materials, etc' (Soejono 1963, p. 8; also Galis 1964, pp. 24, 30). Vessel shapes noted were: 'large shallow bowls, crude small sago ovens, thin-sided pitchers, oblong, angular casks etc' (Galis 1964, p. 24). Ceramics were dominated by 'rough red, yellow and grey unglazed' ware, including some sherds decorated with motifs that are unusual for con- temporary Papuan pottery (Galis 1964, p. 24). Soejono (1963, p. 8) suggests incised and impressed pottery decoration resembles sherds at Kalumpung in central Sulawesi. Small terracotta heads, believed to be ornate bowl handles, were found along with Chinese porcelain (Galis 1958). Fig. 5 Dore Hum Bay (west Birdshead Peninsula).

Surveys in 1990 concentrated on six sites on and around Silisimiklage Hill, 3.5 km southwest of Makbon (Fig. 5; Table 1). The surface collections near Makbon included ceramics decorated with 'incising with interlocking scrolls', which were considered similar (though not identical) to Lapita designs and the Sa-Huynh-Kalanay pottery of Southeast Asia (Solheim 1998, pp. 30, 39). A surface collection in Silisimiklage obtained further decorated - incised and paddle- impressed - sherds. Pottery was associated with shellfish middens at 'site 3' and a burnt area or hearth at 'site 5' (Solheim 1998, pp. 35-38; Fig. 6). Ayamaru Lakes In 1953, small, flat, irregular pieces of metal were observed wrapped in bark or cotton and worn as amulets at Doreri in the Ayamaru district (Elmberg 1959, pp. 70, 81). Chemical analysis identified the metal as lead-copper alloy, typical of Dong Son kettle drums. These items had been broken from three flat, metal objects kept in different parts of the clan territory and locally named bo ri (powerful material) and bo so napi (old thing mother; Elmberg 1959). Surface diameters measured 55-60 cm, with a thickness of 2 mm; each object was decorated with a twelve-pointed star (Elmberg 1959; also Galis 1964, p. 15; Soejono 1963, p. 7). The drums were considered perfect examples of the Heger I type of Dong Son drum found throughout Indonesia (Elmberg 1959, p. 70). In 1993 a project was initiated in the limestone karst region around the Ayamaru Lakes in central Bird's Head (Pasveer 1998; 2004; Pasveer et al. 2002; Fig. 7). Pasveer (2004, p. 20) recorded 15 cave systems or rockshelters and considered the area to be of 'high archaeological potential'. Two sites were recorded on the southern margin of the western lake, three on a peninsula, and two on islands on the westernmost basin (Pasveer 2004, p. 20). Three further sites were recorded within 2-3 km of the lake complex. Tóe and Kria Table 1 Amalgamated summary of the site surveys at Sisimiklage (information from Solheim 1 998, pp. 33-37). Site.

Illustration developed after Pasveer (2004, p. 14) Caves were located 300-400 metres above sea level, 3 km east of the village of Suvviam/ Mapura and 30 km from the peninsula's southwest coastline (Pasveer 1998, p. 70). Kria and Tóe Cave were chosen for archaeological excavation due to the depth and richness of archaeological deposits (Pasveer 2004, p. 20). Cenderawasih Bay Solheim (1979) conducted surveys in the Cenderawasih Bay region (formerly Geelvink) on the northern coast of wNG. Pottery scatters were common in both open sites and rock- shelters, although detailed information on provenance was not provided. Biak and the Padaido Islands (in Cenderawasih Bay) were identified as important settlement areas containing numerous burial caves (Solheim 1979, pp. 324-325; 1978, 1998). Ô Springer</page><page sequence="14">38 J World Prehist (20 1 3) 26:25-73 On the south coast of Biak a small village called Padwa was selected for study (Solheim 1979, p. 325). To the east of Padwa were two 60 m high limestone pinnacles or towers (Solheim 1979, p. 325; 1998, p. 65). The larger, inner tower had numerous wave-cut fissures, many of which contained skeletal remains (Solheim 1979, p. 325). One fissure contained a single outrigger canoe and the remains of two men identified by locals as the founders of Padwa. Above this fissure was a second, smaller cave, which contained the interred remains of two adults and an infant. Both caves contained pottery sherds, beads and 'other small artefacts' (Solheim 1979, p. 325). The top of the towers contained burials, 19th century pottery, a polished stone axe, fish spears and iron artefacts. Limited exca- vations were conducted on top of the towers (see section below). Oral histories indicated continued use of the smaller tower until 1934. A second burial ground was observed on cliff ledges on the west coast of Padwa (Solheim 1979). Human remains were occasionally associated with korwar ancestor fig- ures. In total, 29 korwar and three coffins, including two heavily decorated examples, were collected for exhibition at the Institute of Anthropology in the Cenderawasih University Museum (Solheim 1998). Artefact collector John Friede (2005, p. 86, cited in Torrence et al. 2009, p. 123), obtained an obsidian stemmed tool and 'Japanese war relics' from surface deposits on Biak Island. This artefact came from a cave in limestone cliffs overlooking an airstrip operated by the Japanese during World War II (Torrence et al. 2009). It seems likely that in building defensive walls the Japanese had disturbed the Biak stemmed tool from prehistoric deposits (Torrence and Swadling 2008; Torrence et al. 2009, p. 124; Torrence 201 1). This artefact was sourced to Lou in the Manus (Admiralty) group, rather than Willaumez Peninsula in West New Britain (the origin for all other examples of stemmed tools) (Torrence et al. 2009, p. 142). Stemmed tools have been found in early Holocene deposits; however the Biak example fits with the mid-Holocene 'type 2' artefacts prominent in New Britain (Torrence et al. 2009, pp. 122, 124). The distribution of stemmed tools (on Biak, Lou and Garua Islands) suggested large-scale interaction between New Guinea and Island Melanesia from at least the mid-Holocene (Torrence et al. 2009, p. 143). Further burial caves with pottery were reported on the west coast of Supiori Island at Napido and Maundori (an inlet on the north coast of Supiori; Galis 1964, p. 1). De Bruyn (1920, p. 18) recorded a rocksheiter to the east of Maundori with cultural materials sug- gestive (to him) of Palauan origins. De Bruyn (1920, p. 18) writes: 'In many caves there are still signs that they were once inhabited. At Kiamdori, under an overhanging chalk rock, I found a number of stone axes, a stone club and some broken stone implements, as well as human, possum and pig teeth.' Jayapura District In 1952, Galis (1964, p. 23; later Solheim 1985, p. 156) recorded large quantities of unglazed, sand-tempered pottery from a peninsula near Jayapura. Pottery belonged to a round-shaped vessel with decoration including lines and relief figures and 'stylized rope design', interpreted as similar to pottery from Fiji and elsewhere in Melanesia (Galis 1964, p. 23). In 1 995 archaeological surveys were conducted near the border with Papua New Guinea by archaeologists from the National Research Centre of Archaeology (Jayapura) and ORSTOM, France (Simunjuntak 1998, p. 944). Simanjuntak (1998, p. 946) noted a number of burial caves in Abepura district, especially in the vicinity of Skou Yambe village. Skou Mabo cave is located near the main road between Abepura and Papua New Guinea (Simunjuntak 1996, Ö Springer</page><page sequence="15">J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 39 1998, p. 944). This was a long cave with a small entrance approximately 6.5 m by 2 m. A small chamber, c. 8 m long and 1 .6 m high, was located at the entrance of the cave. The cave surface contained 'abundant potsherds, mollusk shells and animal bones' (Simunjuntak 1998, p. 944; Fig. 8). According to Simanjuntak (1998, p. 944) pottery was thick and worn, incorporating shellfish as temper and decorated with 'zigzag, parallel lines and round knobs' (Simunjuntak 1998, p. 944). Unfortunately, no further information has been provided. Lake Sentani Large numbers of bronze artefacts have been discovered in the Lake Sentani region (near Jayapura; see also Swadling 1996, pp. 205-208; Fig. 9; Fig. 10). These were either recovered from sacred places (e.g. Kwadeware on Jonokom Island, southwest Lake Sen- tani) or kept as heirlooms by villagers (cf Swadling 1996, pp. 205-208). In 1903, van der Sande (1907) found two socketed bronze axe heads and a globular ceremonial object (probably from a bell) hanging from a roof beam in the 'community house' at Ase (Asei) village (Fig. 10). The small axes were originally unearthed on the northern shore of Lake Sentani when the father of the old chief was still a boy, circa 1830 (Galis 1964, p. 13; cf. Soejono 1963, p. 6). According to Galis (1964, p. 13) these now reside in the Rijksmuseum for Anthropology in Leiden. A second discovery (three bronze axes) was made at Kwadeware (Tichelman 1953: Fig. 8). One of these was presented by the village teacher to the District Officer, Mr N. Halie, in 1930 and was donated to the Royal Institute for the Tropics at Amsterdam (De Bruyn 1962, p. 61; Galis 1964, p. 14). Villagers recalled donating two other axes to the local Protestant missionary, G. Schneider (De Bruyn 1959, p. 1). The first (a round axe with a short shaft) was apparently lost by the Rev. I.S. Kijne during World War II. The second was similar to axes from Asei and Roti and is similar to an axe discovered by Galis (1964) in Jakarta museum. This exhibited 'a mask in relief ... with its crown facing the cutting edge' and a 'small open-worked wheel with four spokes and a little round hole in the middle' (van der Hoop 1941, pp. 200-201, cited in Galis 1964; also Tichelman 1953, p. 146). Subsequently, in 1958, De Bruyn circulated photographs of bronze artefacts at Kwadeware. A bronze spear tip (dug up by pigs at Kwadeware) was donated by the community. Excavations were subsequently undertaken outside Kwadeware at a sacred burial mound, Marweri Urang (De Bruyn 1959, pp. 1-2). A few days later, school children unearthed a brass dagger hilt, a bronze spearhead and bronze axe from the same location (De Bruyn 1959, pp. 1-2; cf. Galis 1964, p. 14). With the exception of the dagger hilt (which is similar to those found at Pradjekan in east Java), 'these artefacts are unique, they have no real parallels elsewhere in Indonesia' (Soejono 1963, p. 6). In 1959, an additional bronze ceremonial axe fragment was discovered during leveling of a football field at Abar, on the south coast of Lake Sentani (Galis 1960, pp. 270-278; Fig. 10). This axe had spirals radiating from an upraised centre and two more close to the handle hole (Soejono 1963, p. 7). Another artefact considered unique to wNG was a Marweri Urang type axe found at Ifar Kecil on Adjouw Island in Lake Sentani (Galis 1960, pp. 270-278). This was called daimeholo (a bird's name) in the local language and was brought by ancestors of people living in this area (Soejono 1963, p. 7). Wirz (cited in Riesenfeld 1950, p. 386) observed seven big stone slabs on Ifar Island, which according to local people 'either fell from the sky or came out of the ground'.

The small 'shoe axe' was different from the previous finds as it had a long shaft (Galis 1964, p. 14). A steel axe and steel Springer</page><page sequence="18">42 J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 chopper were exposed during heavy rains in Kwadeware (De Bruyn 1962, p. 62). These were reputed to be sacred, having arrived prior to European arrival in the area in 1892 (De Bruyn 1962, p. 62). A frequent correlation has been noted between bronze finds and pottery at Lake Sentani (De Bruyn 1959, p. 8; Solheim 1979, p. 327). De Bruyn (1959, p. 8) recorded an origin myth whereby pottery and bronzes were brought from the west to the Sepik region of New Guinea by an ancestor, Marweri. His son, also called Marweri, settled on Jonokom Island and brought pottery and bronze artefacts. At Abar and Kwadewari bronze artefacts were associated with megaliths, which were considered to belong to a 'stone cult' (Wirz cited in De Bruyn 1959, p. 8). Agogino (1979, p. 756) noted a similar association between 'copper bronze adzes' and glass beads during surveys north of Lake Sentani during the 1940s. Simunjuntak (1998, p. 937) recorded 1 10 upright stones (15-88 cm high) on the top of Tutari hill, near Lake Sentani. This 'Tutari complex' included large stones supported by smaller stones and 'stone arrangements, consisting of rows of stones and circular and rectangular stone enclosures' (unpublished conference paper by Bagyo Prasetyo 1996, cited in Simunjuntak 1998, p. 947). These represent men, women and children who were killed (Galis 1964, p. 8). Galis (1964, p. 8) records a similar site in the upper reaches of the Baliem River, where 130 stones were placed 'in memory of clan members who had been killed in 1954'. Five megaliths were found in a cave (Mur) close to Pim Village in Abepura district. These 'statues' were carved out of flat limestone slabs (&lt;120 cm in height). One slab depicted a face with eyes, eyebrows, nose and mouth (Simunjuntak 1998, p. 937). Long hairs were inscribed on the back of the statue and the top of the head was shaped like a crown. Hands pressed into the body and an object resembling a hand drum, tifa, had been carved on the figure's waist. Archaeological Excavations/Soil Sections Arguni Island, South Berau Gulf Josef Röder (1940a; 1959) excavated Dudumunir (translated as 'place of thunder'), a south-facing cave on the south coast of Arguni Island. Oral histories identified Dudumunir as an ancestral settlement to Arguni village (Röder 1959, p. 39), and settlement of 'Araguni village' is mentioned in documents dating before 1686 (Röder 1940a, pp. 6, 9). Unfor- tunately, most of the artefacts and field-notes collected from this excavation were destroyed during the Allied bombing of Frankfurt in World War II. Dudumunir consists of an entrance chamber (or 'ante-room', 10-12 m high), then a main chamber ('dimensions of a small hall') and another smaller chamber ('the dimensions of a living room': Röder 1959, p. 39). Two passages or 'tunnels' lead in a westerly direction (at right angles to the main chambers) through the cave (Röder 1940a, p. 5; 1959, p. 39). Three alcoves were observed in the cave roof. The first (a) was not described. The second (b) contained undecorated ceramics and shellfish, including a shellfish bowl stained with red ochre (Röder 1940a, p. 8; 1959, p. 46). Sample analysis by Dr Alois Stois of Munich in 1938 revealed no organic binder (Röder 1959, p. 46). A third (c), deeper alcove was partially enclosed by a dry-stone wall and contained human bone and ceramics (Röder 1940a, p. 8). The ante-room contained a large central 'dam', or raised midden, of cultural materials, including pottery fragments, Chinese porcelain, animal and human bones (Röder 1940a, Ö Springer</page><page sequence="19">J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 43 p. 5; 1959, p. 39). A wooden pole observed in this chamber was reported to have been obtained from an old mosque at Arguni. A test excavation in the ante-chamber was dug to ascertain the depth of cultural deposit and record stratigraphy. Results for this excavation were not published. A second trench measuring 'a few square metres' was dug in the centre of the main hall, adjacent to a painted dripstone pillar on which an anthropomorphic figure ( matutuo ) was painted in red (Röder 1939b, p. 178; 1940a, p. 6; 1959, pp. 42-46). Detailed analysis revealed four cultural horizons (Table 2). Röder (1940a, p. 8 A; 1959, p. 64) observed a shift from aceramic (layer C) to ceramic (layers B and A) deposits at layer B2 (Röder 1940a, p. 8; 1959, p. 45). Layer B1 contained a stone slab (54 cm in diameter) with traces of red paint similar to the red pigment used to paint the matutuo figure on the adjacent pillar (Röder 1939a, p. 178; 1940a, pp. 7-8; 1959, p. 43). Pottery from layers A, B1 and B2 was dominated by round pots manufactured by the paddle-and-anvil method, often with back-curving rims. Fragments of a different vessel (vertical necked, wide lipped jar with a serrated lip) were also observed (Röder 1959, p. 42). The necks of pottery vessels in Layers A and Bl, and to a lesser extent B2, were frequently decorated with finger impressions and embossed, incised and serrated designs including X-shaped symbols, rows of circles and face motifs. Comparisons were drawn between subsurface pottery in layer Bl at Dudumunir, contemporary Arguni ceramics (Röder 1959, p. 42) and sherds from Manokwari and Lake Sentani (Röder 1940a, pp. 7-8 Table 2 Amalgamated summary of the cultural horizons from Dudumunir trench 1 (reconstructed after Berger-Kirchner 1970, Röder 1939a, 1940a &amp; 1959 &amp; Ellen and Glover 1974) No. Max.

Sherds from layer B2 were described as 'a coarse type of pottery' (Röder 1959, p. 44). Röder (1940a, p. 8; 1959, pp. 130-134) suggested that the age of strata ranged from Palaeolithic or Mesolithic (layer C), to Neolithic (Layers B1 and B2), to historic (Layer A). Layer A was interpreted as non-intensive settlement by people using the cave as an occasional shelter, hiding place and burial area. The large quantities of pottery were interpreted as evidence for dumping of village waste in the cave (Röder 1959, p. 40). Based on superimposition, Röder (1940a, 1959, p. 134) suggested that black paintings at Du- dumunir were most likely associated with Layer A. Layers B1 and B2 (with the red painted stone slab and rich ceramic assemblages) represented a period of sustained settlement, contemporaneous with the red 'Arguni' style of rock art. No connection was made between aceramic Layer C and cave paintings. Bird's Head/Western District In the 1970s, a survey of the Bird's Head revealed a burial cave on a small island to the northeast of Kaboei Bay (Solheim 1979). A 'small test pit' was excavated (depth uncertain) and a range of 19th century pottery recovered. The pottery and a carved wooden platform were lodged with the Cenderawasih University Museum (Solheim 1979, p. 326). Detailed excavation results have not been published. Another site on the northwest coast, in the vicinity of the village of Makbon, was selected by Solheim in the 1970s for additional survey and subsequently revisited in 1990 (Solheim 1998). Brief descriptions were provided on surface collections and test exca- vation of Makbon village and around a small hill, Silisimiklage (Solheim 1998). In Makbon, a 1 m2 test pit was opened at the rear of a house. This revealed shallow deposits containing numerous pottery sherds similar to those collected from the surface collection at Sismiklage. Pottery was restricted to the uppermost 5-10 cm of black topsoil and no stone artefacts were recovered (Solheim 1998, p. 38). Solheim (1998, p. 35) surveyed six sites in the vicinity of Silisimiklage (see previous section on survey results), and dug test pits at Sites 5 and 6. Site 5 was situated on an old hearth with the upper deposits (depth uncertain) containing fired clay and charcoal, but devoid of pottery. Site 6 was divided into a 5 x 4 m grid of 1 m2 units. Excavation of one of these units (B2) revealed 15 cm of charcoal, very hard clay and a few pottery sherds (Solheim 1998, p. 35). Three adjacent squares contained few pottery sherds and ceased at approximately 20 cm below surface (henceforth cmbs) due to the 'extremely hard clay' (Solheim 1998, p. 36). A few rich pockets of pottery were excavated to the north, east and south margins of the grid (Solheim 1998, p. 37). Solheim (1998, p. 35) observed a con- centration of ceramics on surrounding slopes, interpreted to represent the sweeping of rubbish away from adjacent, flat living areas. In the southeast corner of the excavated grid, a second burnt area with red soil was identified (Solheim 1998, p. 36). No further infor- mation has been published for this excavation. Kria and Toé Caves, Ayamaru Lakes Test excavations (amounting to three weeks digging) were conducted at the entrance to both caves (Pasveer 2004, p. 21 ). Excavation was conducted in 5 cm vertical units; deposits were sorted by hand due to the lack of suitable wet sieving facilities and clay rich sediment (Pasveer 2004, p. 21). Significant cultural deposits were recovered during excavations at both rockshelters, although no archaeological features were recorded. â Springer</page><page sequence="21">J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 45 Kria cave is located on a low hill, 3 km east of Suwiam/Mapura village (Pasveer 1998, p. 70). Pasveer (1998, p. 70) dug two adjoining 1 x 1 m squares (1N1E and 0N0E) in the central recesses of the northeast facing entrance. Neither unit was excavated to culturally sterile deposits or bedrock; Square 0N0E was discontinued at 195 cmbs and Square INI E at 1 70 cmbs (Pasveer 2004, p. 3 1 ). 'Coring and probing' at the bottom of Square 0N0E indicated at least 40 cm thickness of unexcavated cultural deposit (containing burnt bone and stone flakes), while 1N1E continued for another 20 cm (Pasveer 2004, p. 31 ; Fig. 1 1 ; Table 3). No stratigraphy or cultural features were observed during the excavation and so Pasveer (2004, p. 23) obtained a 30 cm wide latex peel (north wall of 0N0E) for later interpretation of stratigraphy. This provided 'a rough indication of major boundaries', with a change from grey - dark grey, granular sediment (above 80 cmbs) to dark greyish brown - brown, silty sediment (below 80 cmbs; Fig. 11). Ten samples of bone, cassowary eggshell and charcoal were submitted for AMS dating. Seven samples were considered stratigraphically secure, while two small charcoal samples Fig. 11 Kria Cave stratigraphy with uncalibrated radiocarbon ages.

Core revealed no change in sediment colour (GrA 6312 and GrA 6313) yielded dates considered anomalous (Pasveer 2004, Table 3.2). A fragment of charcoal was dated to 7930-7590 cal BP (OxA6043) in Square IN IE (Pasveer 2004, p. 53). The alkaline fraction of a bulk bone sample of animal bone from 170-175 cmbs (Square 0N0E) provided a similar (if less secure) date of 7680-7510 cal BP (GrA9103). A minimum age of 1840±40 uncal. BP (OZE542) was obtained from pig bone (Sus scrofa) found 10 cm above the top of Unit II in Square 1N1E. Pasveer (2004, p. 54) believed the site was first occupied approximately 8000 years ago. The faunal assemblage at Kria was dominated by a single species of forest wallaby, the brown Dorcopsis ( Dorcopsis muelleri ) known locally as the djief (Aplin et al. 1999; Pasveer 2004, p. 34). Other species included tree kangaroo ( Dendrolagus spp.), cuscuses (Spilocuscus spp. and Phalanger spp.), echidna ( Zaglossus bruijnii ), ringtail possums (Pseudochirulus spp. and Pseudochirops spp.), bandicoots ( Echymipera spp.), pig ( Sus scrofa) and rat ( Rattus praetor) (Pasveer 2004, p. 34; Pasveer and Aplin 1998, p. 896). In 0N0E the frequency of bone peaked at 60-80 cmbs and again below 120 cmbs. In Square INI E bone frequencies peaked at 30-55 cmbs, 105-125 cmbs and 135-160 cmbs (Pasveer 2004, p. 36). Avian eggshell (mainly cassowary ( Casuarius sp.) was prominent at 35-40 cmbs (0N0E) and 65-70 cmbs (1N1E). A transition was noted between lowland fauna (dominated by Dorcopsis muelleri) to montane fauna (e.g. Phalanger vestitus, Pseudo- chirulus schlegelii) below 80 cmbs. Shellfish (primarily freshwater species of Melanoides) was excavated from both squares, with quantities decreasing substantially below 35 cmbs (IN IE) and 55 cmbs (0N0E). In total, 1528 stone artefacts (amounting to 7.5 kg) were recovered from Kria Cave, with the majority made from 'a relatively light, brittle chert'; the remainder were 'lime- stone, silicified tuff, quartzite (including a pebble which was used as a hammerstone) and ^ Springer</page><page sequence="23">J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 47 metamorphic material' (Pasveer 2004, p. 38). Most chert artefacts were excavated below 110 cmbs in Square 0N0E, while the distribution was more constant in Square IN IE. In addition, 92 bone artefacts were excavated (Pasveer 2004, p. 38); these artefacts were restricted to the upper 45 cm in Square 0N0E and upper 35 cm in Square 1N1E. Three pottery sherds were recovered from the top 10 cmbs of 0N0E, and a fourth at a depth of 20-25 cmbs (Pasveer 2004, p. 57; Pasveer and Aplin 1998, p. 902). The pottery was tempered by 'quartz grains and a feldspar-like mineral', believed to be derived from the Arfak mountains to the north and east of the lakes and on Waigeo, Batanta and Salawati islands to the north and west of the Bird's Head Peninsula (Pasveer 2004, p. 39). One sherd was decorated with incised cross lines (Pasveer 2004, p. 39). Human skeletal remains were excavated from the upper levels of Square 0N0E, with small quantities recorded in 1N1E. Toé cave is located on a small peninsula in a western basin of the Ayamaru Lakes near the villages of Men (or Semoe) and Kartapura (Pasveer 2004, p. 59). The cave has two main entrances and three additional side corridors. Pasveer (2004, p. 59) strung up an excavation grid across the southeastern entrance of the main corridor (two 1 x 1 m excavations - 1N1E and 0N0E - and two 50 x 50 cm excavations - 1S0E and 2N1E). The same excavation techniques used for Kria Cave were adopted for Toé cave. The natural strata were not visible during excavation and thus another latex peel was used to profile the central section of the southern wall of Square 1N1E. This revealed a change in colour from grey to orange-brown mottled sediment below 70 cmbs (Jelsma 1998, p. 46; Fig. 12; Table 4). The texture also changed from granular to smooth, 'blocky' sediment below 70 cmbs (Pasveer 2004, p. 61). Significant inversions were observed in radiocarbon dates from charcoal and bone fragments in Square 1S0E (Jelsma 1998). An ESR date from Square 0N0E from tooth enamel returned a further anomalous date (Pasveer 2004: Table 4.2; Pasveer and Aplin 1998; Fig. 12). Casuarius eggshell fragments from Square 2N1E were dated using AMS and amino acid racemisation (AAR) ratios. These provided a good age-depth sequence indicating site use back to 26,000 cal BP (Pasveer 2004, p. 76). Some problems of site formation were identified, with mean dates from three eggshell fragments (95-100 cmbs in 2N1E) differing by c. 7000 years. This was attributed to low sedimentation rates or minor disturbance (Pasveer 2004, p. 75). Fig. 12 Toé Cave stratigraphy with uncalibrated radiocarbon ages.

The composition of the faunal assemblage was similar to that from Kria Cave, with the forest wallaby dominating. Other species represented were brown tree kangaroo ( Dendrolagus goodfellowi ), cuscuses ( Spilocuscus rufoniger and Phalanger sppj, long-beaked echidna ( Zaglossus bruijnii), striped possums (Dactylopsila spp.), ringtail possums ( Pseudochirulus spp.), bandicoots, rodents, birds (including Casuarius ), snakes, lizards and bats (Pasveer 2004, p. 63). In Square 2N1E, the volume of faunal material peaked from bedrock to 80 cmbs and in a minor way between 45 and 10 cmbs (Pasveer 2004, p. 63). In Square 1N1E bone density was low until 95-100 cmbs, with a similar pattern in Square 0N0E. A few fragments of pig bone were excavated close to the surface in 1N1E alongside small quantities (286 g) of mainly freshwater shellfish. In total, 26.3 kg (1775 fragments) of stone artefacts were excavated from Toé Cave (Pasveer 2004, p. 65). Chert dominated the assemblage (n=1698) and most artefacts were recorded in the upper half of the deposit. In Square 2N1E two peaks in the frequency of stone artefacts were noted, at 60-75 cmbs and 40-55 cmbs (Pasveer 2004, p. 65). Similar peaks were noted in Squares IN IE and 1S0E at 65-75 cmbs and 40-45 cmbs. Three bone artefacts were recovered: two 'bipoints' between 50 and 60 cmbs in Squares 0N0E and 1S0E and an 'unfinished fragment' between 30 and 35 cmbs in 0N0E. Three undecorated pottery sherds were recorded between 5 and 15 cmbs. Pasveer (2004, p. 66) observed similar pottery temper (quartz and feldspar-like inclusions) to sherds excavated from Kria Cave. Overview Pasveer inferred three phases of human settlement based on ages provided by different dating techniques for the two rockshelters: glacial (26,000-13,000 cal. BP); transition (7000-6000 cal. BP); and modern (&lt;6000 cal. BP) (Pasveer 2004; Pasveer and Aplin 1998). The glacial phase (at Toé cave) was dominated by montane and closed forest taxa, as well as disturbance-intolerant species ( Spilocuscus rufoniger , Dendrolagus inustus , Zag- lossus bruijnii ; Pasveer and Aplin 1998, p. 918). The lack of grassland/savanna species suggested the continued presence of rainforest in the vicinity of both sites, while open forest taxa (e.g. Dorcopsis muelleri) suggested wide-ranging gathering strategies (Pasveer and Aplin 1998, p. 916). A transition phase dating to between 7000 and 6000 cal. BP (Layer 5 of Kria cave and base of Toe Cave) was dominated by Dorcopsis muelleri , suggesting replacement of â Springer</page><page sequence="25">J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 49 glacial, montane/closed forest taxa by lowland/open forest fauna (Pasveer and Aplin 1998, p. 918). Direct evidence for human impact through prédation or habitat destruction is provided by the local extirpation of black spotted cuscus ( Spilocuscus rufoniger) and brown tree kangaroo (Dendrolagus goodfellowi ), as well as a decline in the long-beaked echidna (Zaglossus bruijnii) (Pasveer and Aplin 1998, p. 918; see also Sutton et al. 2009, p. 48). A 'modern phase' (Units IV-I of Kria cave and the upper portion of Tóe Cave), associated with lowland fauna (dominated by Dorcopsis muelleri ), was expected to be younger than 6000 cal. BP. Rattus praetor found in the upper levels of Kria Cave and Square IN IE at Tóe Cave was interpreted as evidence for forest disturbance and increased gardening activities around the site (Pasveer and Aplin 1998, p. 918). Pig bone and pottery were introduced to both sites during this phase (Pasveer and Aplin 1998, p. 918). Cenderawasih Bay: Padwa Excavations Solheim (1998) records limited excavations at Padwa, a village on the south coast of Biak Island. A test pit was dug on a limestone tower, known to local villagers as the Padwa Mnu burial ground (Solheim 1979, p. 324). The excavation produced evidence of Japanese visitation during World War II, including live ammunition, hand grenades and substantial disturbance. No further excavation results are reported. Lake Sentani In September 1958, following the discovery of a bronze spear head by villagers, a day excavation was conducted at the sacred site of Marweri Urang near Kwadeware village on Jonokom Island (De Bruyn 1959, pp. 1-2). The 1 m x 1 m excavation was positioned on a 'grave mound', 1 m above the water-line in an area rich in surface pottery (De Bruyn 1959, pp. 1-2; 1962, p. 61). This area was associated with a giant mango tree where sacred objects such as bronzes, pottery and stone axes were originally stored (De Bruyn 1959, 1962). Pottery vessels were frequently 'split in half', and contained human bone, sug- gesting the use of ceramics during burial (De Bruyn 1959, p. 7; Soejono 1963, p. 7). Subsurface deposits to 40 cmbs included fragments of earthenware pottery. A broken stone axe, a small shell ear decoration, pottery and a bronze socketed axe were recorded in the top 14 cm. After the initial discovery of bronze artefacts at Kwadeware, Solheim (1978, 1979, 1985) returned to the site to carry out further archaeological excavations (Solheim 1979, p. 327). Small shovel pits revealed pottery but no further bronze artefacts. Excavation results are largely unpublished. Cape Kassoe, Humboldt Bay Two earth mounds (averaging 6.5 m in length, 4 m in width and 1.5 m in height) were recorded at Cape Kassoe on the southern side of Humboldt Bay. The first mound was located 'about two hundred yards from the present beach [adjoining] a thirty-foot cliff and 15 yards away from a second mound, which was surrounded by swamp (Miller 195Ò, p. 278). In 1944, the drier of the two mounds was excavated. A small excavation (c. 90 cm2 or 3 ft2) was undertaken to a depth of c. 90 cm in 15 cm spits. No stratigraphy was observed and â Springer</page><page sequence="26">50 J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 the excavation did not reach either the base of the mound or culturally sterile deposits (Miller 1950, p. 278). Excavation revealed large quantities of 'shells, ashes, potsherds, broken stones, bones and earth', including 1050 pottery sherds (Miller 1950, p. 278). At unspecified depths Miller (1950, p. 285) records 'doughnut-shaped, perforated and pol- ished' stone objects and red-slipped, burnished, polished, incised, pierced, stamped and painted pottery. Unfortunately, only one out of ten packages of excavated material reached the labo- ratory, providing a sample size of only 124 sherds for analysis. Miller (1950, p. 280) grouped these according to vessel type and recognised five basic groups (Table 5), with another three potential groups represented by single sherds. The majority (87 sherds) belonged to oval/round, wide-mouthed bowls and 'practically all sherds' were tempered with 'either a lot or a little' fine beach sand and were brick red in colour (Miller 1950, pp. 280, 284).

Plain ware dominated 'the next several layers' although incised sherds became increasingly common. Towards the base of the excavation (depth unreported) 'punctate decoration made its appearance'. Based on the consistent use of sand for pottery temper, Miller (1950, p. 280) hypothesized that 'the entire collection comes from a single component or cultural horizon which evidently persisted for quite some time.' Highlands In 1971-1973, the Australian Research Grants Committee and the University of Melbourne funded a multidisciplinary study of the glaciers of wNG. As part of the Australian- Indonesian Carstenz Glaciers Expedition, five months were spent on Mt. Jaya, where a series of rockshelters were recorded (Hope and Hope 1976). However, without permission from the Lembaga Purbakala dan Peninggalan (LPPN) (Institute of Archaeology and National Heritage), and in the absence of an archaeologist, no systematic excavations were completed. Two 'exposed sections' in different rockshelters were sampled and documented (Hope and Hope 1976). Mapala Rocksheiter This is located c. 1.2 km north of Nggapulu, near the southwestern limit of Lake Pulu at approximately 3996 m. The rocksheiter is formed by a large limestone block approximately 1 5 m X 15m and 8 m high, sitting atop two small glacial moraine ridges, and is known to have been used on an occasional basis into the modern period. The field team camped in the rocksheiter and recorded archaeological deposits in the interior when they leveled the ground surface to provide themselves with more head room (Hope and Hope 1976, p. 233). A soil section (42 cm in depth) revealed three layers: 'fine red-grey ash' at 0-5 cmbs; a 'very black deposit' at 5-32 cmbs; and 'grey clayey silts' with pebbles interpreted as basal limestone at 32-42 cmbs (Hope and Hope 1976, p. 233). Charcoal fragments were dated to 5440 ± 130 uncal. BP from a 10 x 10 cm area 2-5 cm into Layer 2 (ANU 1015; Hope 1976, p. 211; Hope and Hope 1976, p. 234). These provide a maximum age for a sub- surface deposit containing a rich faunal assemblage. Large quantities of mammal bone (MNI = 73), charcoal and carbonised twigs were recorded in Layer 2, with a few bone fragments percolating into Layer 3 (Hope 1976, p. 211). The assemblage was dominated by copper ringtail possum ( Pseudocherius cup- re us), bandicoot ( Peroryctes longicauda ) and locally extirpated or extinct species of wallaby, originally cited as T. brunii and T. christenseni (Hope 1976, p. 211; Hope and Hope 1976, p. 234; cf. Sutton et al. 2009: Table 2). These appear to have become rare or even extinct within the past 5000 years (Hope and Hope 1976, p. 235).The deposit included native cat ( Satanellus albopunctatus ), tree kangaroo ( Dendrolagus dorianus ), possum ( Phalanger sp.) and the disturbance- intolerant long-beaked echidna (Hope 1976, p. 212). The mandible of a juvenile dog (Canis familiarisé postdates a radiocarbon age of 5440=bl30BP (4551-3963 cal. BP) (Hope 1976, p. 222; Hope and Hope 1976, p. 235). The antiquity of dog on New Guinea is uncertain, although it was present by at least 1500 years ago (Sutton et al. 2009). Most of the mammals from Mapala shelter are common at high altitudes in New Guinea (e.g. bandicoot, ringtail possum), suggesting local hunting (Hope 1976, pp. 208, 222). Tree kangaroo, echidna and possum are ordinarily sub-alpine taxa, suggesting transportation from montane, forest environments (Hope 1976, pp. 214, 222). &lt;0 Springer</page><page sequence="28">52 J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 Two lithics, a small chert scraper and a small piece of granodiorite were recorded in the same context as the bulk of mammal bones (Hope and Hope 1976, p. 234). The scraper was described as typical for the east central highlands of Papua New Guinea (White 1972). Three mollusc shells were also recovered. One shell was identified as Geloninidae , which lives in brackish coastal waters and was used in the New Guinea Highlands for orna- mentation (White 1972). Hamid Rocksheiter Hamid rocksheiter (named after Let. Kol. Hajo As war Hamid from the 1964 Cenderawasih Expedition) is located 15 km northeast of the Mt Jaya massif north wall at 3450 m. Hope and Hope ( 1 976, p. 235) observed a number of tracks in the vicinity, suggesting more frequent use than Mapala. The upper levels of the shelter were too steep for occupation, while the lower levels had been terraced into 2 m wide strips by the 1964 Cenderawasih Expedition (Hope and Hope 1976, p. 235). A 50 cm section was examined on the middle terrace with cultural materials noted within the top 27 cm (Table 6). Large fragments of charcoal were used to obtain a radiocarbon date (820±65 uncal. BP; ANU 1014) for the basal cultural layer (Layer 4; Hope and Hope 1976, p. 235). Faunal remains were rare at Hamid rocksheiter. They consisted of long-beaked echidna (Zaglossus bruijni) above the dated cultural horizon. The 1970s expedition to Mount Jaya provided the first radiocarbon dates for excavated deposits in wNG. Hope and Hope (1976, pp. 336-337) concluded that humans used high altitudes from at least 5500 years ago. The exotic fauna, flora and artefacts suggested lowland-highland trade during the late Holocene (Hope and Hope 1976, pp. 336-337). The disappearance of Thylogale spp. (and possibly Phalanger sp. and Dendrolagus dorianus) from these sites indicates disturbance of sub-alpine areas by wild dogs and/or humans within the past 5000 years (Hope 1976, p. 223). Timijapa Cave, Central Highands (near Dedoute and Timijapa) was excavated by Mr. J. Haring, Sub-district officer of Tigi in 1960 and revealed human bones. Haring (cited in Galis 1964, p. 2) writes: These human skeletal remains, as far as I could determine, belong to three people. I found them in Timijapa cave after first removing 25 cm of stalagmite. At a depth of 70 cm I stopped on limestone.' Incidental Finds Numerous isolated finds and artefact scatters have been reported from across wNG.

Ceramic scatters have been observed at Dudumunir cave on Arguni Island; Jembekaki on the north coast of Batanta Island; Gag and Me islands; Sisimiklage; Makbon; Ajambori east of Manokwari; Pasih Putih, near Manokwari; Tiachnuch peninsula in Jautefa Bay near Jayapura; Cape Kassoe, near Jayapura; Sabron village on the northwest bank of Lake Sentani; Kwadeware on Jonokom Island; and Ajapo village near Sentani (Galis 1956, 1964, p. 2; Miller 1950; Röder 1959; Soejono 1963; Solheim 1978, 1979, 1985; Solheim and Aplin 1977; Solheim and Mansoben 1977). A probable pot burial was identified at Bakaro Cave near Pasir Putih, Manokwari (Galis 1964, p. 25). Ceramic sherds were associated with bones which were reputed to date between 1825 and 1855 (Galis 1964, p. 18). In 1935 a small bronze axe head was recovered in non-excavated deposits at Sorong (Galis 1956). A spear tip or small axe with two handles was found in 1938, northeast of Sorong at Hufmare (Hopmanje?) at the headwaters of the Koor River (Galis 1964, p. 15; Soejono 1963, p. 6). Galis (1964, p. 15) believed that this was similar to axes recorded near Lake Sentani in 1961, suggesting widespread trade in the region. Stone mortars and/or pestles, which are often considered to be more common in Papua New Guinea, were found in 1935 in subsurface deposits at Sorong at a depth of c. 2 m, and at Netar in Sentani district in 1921 (Galis 1964, p. 1 1; Soejono 1963), although no further information is available for these discoveries. In 1957, one stone mortar was found at an agricultural experimental station at Wousi, and in 1959 a small stone mortar was found at Fig. 14 Rock art sites in West Papua.

A stone mortar and pestle were found at a depth of approximately 1 m during the construction of an airstrip at Moanamani in the Kamu valley (Baliem valley) of the central highlands, together with the remains of a fireplace (Galis 1964, p. 11). In 1959, a stone pestle was found by American ethnologist Dr L. Pospisil at Itoreda on the other side of Kamu valley (Galis 1964, p. 11). Stone axes have been recorded in northern Supiori and Biak Islands (De Bruyn 1959) and Kajob village on Roon Island in Cenderawasih Bay. Further surface discoveries of stone axes were made at Manokwari and Kaimana (Galis 1964, p. 4) and Darembang Lama on the south coast of Berau Gulf (Röder 1959, pp. 65-66). Rock Art Surveys The earliest record of rock art occurs in 1678, when merchant Johannes Keyts described red paintings covering a cliff in Spellman Gulf, south of Fakfak (Galis 1964, p. 16; Arifin and Delanghe 2004, p. 49). There were further descriptions of rock art during the 19th century (e.g. T. B. Leon and D. F. Ban Braam Morris); Morris suggested an association between rock art and human burials (Arifin and Delanghe 2004, p. 51). The first detailed study of rock art was conducted in 1937 by J. Röder in the Berau Gulf. Although there have since been multiple commentators on new rock art sites and discussions of Röder' s original work, it is not until the 1990s that a comprehensive survey was commissioned as part of a UNESCO funded project (Arifin and Delanghe 2004). The UNESCO project primarily revisited regions of known rock art, namely those recorded by Röder (1959) in Berau; by Souza and Solheim (1976) in Kaimana; and by Heider (1970) in the Baliem Valley (Fig. 14). The Berau Gulf The foremost survey of rock art in wNG was undertaken as part of the Frobenius Expe- dition. J. Röder and artist A. Hahn documented and illustrated 40 locations between August Fig. 15 Rock art sites along the north Onin coast. Illustration developed after Arifin and Delanghe (2004, p. 54) â Springer</page><page sequence="31">J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 55 and October 1937 (Röder 1938b, 1939a, 1939b, 1940a, 1940b, 1959; Fig. 15). These consisted of small sites and larger galleries, some exceeding 10 m in length, located along a 30 km stretch between Kokas and Goras and on islands adjacent to the Onin coast. Typically the art was completed in wave-cut grooves and caves up to 4 m above the current high tide level, although it was also recorded at heights of up to 30 m on inaccessible cliff faces (Arifin and Delanghe 2004; Röder 1940a). Rock art was differentiated by colour: red was the oldest, then white, and black the youngest; and by style (Tabulinetin, Manga, Arguni and Ota). Tabulinetin was concen- trated in the Gulfs far west, with notable sites at Tapuraramu, Sorraa and Afofo. This style consisted of stencils, most commonly hand motifs and other body parts, although human figures, matutuo , animals, combs, fish, lizards, boomerangs, 'Dong Son axes', celestial symbols, geometric designs and spirals are also depicted (Röder 1956, p. 396; Fig. 16). The galleries are usually large, crowded with motifs, and always completed in red ochre, occasionally with a purple or yellow hue. It was inferred from superposition of rock art, the weathered aspect of rock art, and the presence of boomerang and probable Dong Son axe stencils, that the Tabulinetin style was oldest (Röder 1956, p. 395). The Manga style (named after the Manggo site) was a more organised and geometric style, with drawings clearly arranged and rarely overlapping one another, unlike previous art. Motifs were described as 'abstract' and 'unemotional', and depicted humans, animals, and fish (Röder 1956, p. 494; 1959, p. 69). Manga was succeeded by the Arguni style, named after Arguni Island but recorded at other sites including Mampago and Risatot. This style utilised red and black paint and, according to Röder (1956, p. 394), exhibited more creative influences than Manga. Fig. 16 Photograph of painted rock art at Afofo, Berau Gulf (photograph taken by Mark Donohue) ^ Springer</page><page sequence="32">56 J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 Ota 1 (recorded at Ota and Safar) was considered contemporary with the Manga and Arguni styles and consisted of large, simple motifs including swastikas (Röder 1959, p. 68). Ota 2 (recorded at 'Ota', Oya and 'Sosorraweru' [Sosorrawera]) was similar to the Tabulinetin and Arguni styles and consisted of lines and simple figures (Röder 1959, p. 70). A final typological subclass, called Sosorraweru, contained many black drawings of large sea vessels (Röder 1959, pp. 71, 92). This style was expected to represent the arrival of 'Indonesian' immigrants during the 17th to 19th centuries (Berger- Kirchner 1970; Röder 1956, p. 399), a time of fortified village settlements, boat burials and the development of a 'ship cult' manifest in the large numbers of boat motifs in this style (Röder 1959, pp. 33-34). A pottery sherd with similar black drawings was considered to belong to this period (Röder 1956, p. 399). Arifin and Delanghe (2004) reassessed 30 of the 40 sites (ten could not be located) originally recorded by Josef Röder and discovered a further 16 sites. While agreeing with many of Röder' s classifications, Arifin and Delanghe (2004, pp. 24-75) questioned his chronology based on motifs (e.g. matutuo figures), because many motifs were replicated in many of Röder' s (1959) style types. Complexity was also difficult to use as a criterion with the key Tabulinetin' site observed to contain both simple and complex designs (Arifin and Delanghe 2004, p. 88). Arifin and Delanghe (2004, pp. 74-75, 91) believed that boo- merangs, matutuo figures and possible Dong Son axe motifs offered a method for ascer- taining site antiquity. Arifin and Delanghe (2004, pp. 68-71) point to missing digits in hand motifs as potentially related to self-mutilation as part of a mourning process known ethnographically in the highlands of New Guinea (Arifin and Delanghe 2004, pp. 68-71), but unattested in the local area in modern times. The rock art of the Berau Gulf continued to occupy an important place in the traditions of the area into the 20th century (Berger- Kirchner 1970; Röder 1959). Oral traditions record the passage of blind ancestors who came from the sun, feeling their way along the rock faces using their hands (Berger- Kirchner 1970, p. 238). The Tabulinetin hand motifs are thought to trace this migration. The ancestors were followed by the ancestress Ominin who drew, in the Tabuletin and Manga styles, animals which she consumed on her journey (Arifin and Delanghe 2004, p. 57; Berger-Kirchner 1970, p. 239), Alternative accounts speak of the loss at sea of a boat containing people and animals; the rock art is the traces of their attempts to escape drowning (Mark Donohue pers. com. June 2011). Depictions of ancestor figures ( matutuo ) are frequently found near fishing grounds and were ethno- graphically connected with fishing ceremonies (Berger-Kirchner 1970, p. 237). Offerings continued to be made at matutuo sites into the 20th century at Bisiuri Katak and Owi Cave at Goras (Berger-Kirchner 1970, p. 237). The Kaimana (Namatote) Area Kaimana is a small town southeast of the Bomberai Peninsula (Arifin and Delanghe 2004, p. 95). The coastal topography is a mixture of limestone cliffs and mangrove forest. Rock art is typically recorded from galleries on limestone cliffs a few metres above the current high tide level, but art can be located at heights of 30-40 m in hard to access locations on cliff faces (Arifin and Delanghe 2004, p. 95). The rock art of the Kaimana region was first documented by W.J. Cator (1939), who inspected both the Fakfak and Kaiman regions (Galis 1964). Subsequent surveys of the Kaimana region occurred in 1975 and 1976 (Souza and Solheim 1976). Paintings were observed in wave cut notches on cliffs along the coast Ô Springer</page><page sequence="33">J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 57 around Mai Mai, southeast of Kaimana, with red and yellow ochres underlying black paintings suggesting a temporally discrete shift in pigment use (Solheim 1979, p. 326). A stylistic change occurs from stencilling and hand motifs to a more linear style, before terminating in a less skilful, thick lined black class. Solheim (1979) identified matutuo figures similar to those in the Berau Gulf, although he stated no local traditions are associated with them in Kaimana. Chaloupka (1983: cited in Arifin and Delanghe 2004, p. 46) identified 24 sites around Kaimana conservatively estimated to contain 2512 images. These included large galleries as well as single marks including circles, mazes and geometric structures. He did not identify matutuo figures in the art of this region. Arifin and Delange (2004, p. 223) recorded 25 sites in total at Bitsyari Bay, most of which had been previously recorded, and two new sites in Triton Bay. Motifs in Bitsyari and Triton Bays were dominated by abstract figures in red and yellow ochre (Arifin and Delanghe 2004, p. 100). Other motifs included anthropomorphic figures (many with headwear), celestial figures, lizards, turtles, fish, possible dolphins and hammerhead sharks, birds, crosses and matutuo figures (Arifin and Delanghe 2004, pp. 1 10-121). Sites such as Tumberawasi (southeast Bitsyari Bay) contained rock art that integrated abstract and realistic motifs including lizards, faces, matutuo and anthropomorphic figures (Arifin and Delanghe 2004, p. 104). The matutuo figures, as well as x's and celestial beings, are common in the rock art of both Kaimana and the Berau Gulf, possibly indicating shared artistic traditions and coastal contact. Motifs in the Kaimana region are considered more abstract in style than those from the Berau Gulf (Arifin and Delanghe 2004, p. 115). Northeast Irian Jaya: Lake Sentani In 1903 engravings of various kinds were observed by L. F. de Beaufort and P. E. Moo- lenburgh on a flat stone on Sosena (or Hosena) islet, eastern bay of Lake Sentani (Galis 1964, pp. 264-265). Galis (1964, p. 265) was informed that these engraved figures were locally known as talipo , but had disappeared. Engraved figures were observed in 1961 on boulders in Doyo Lama village on the western shore of Lake Sentani (Galis 1961, pp. 464-475; 1964, p. 20; also Bintarti 1982, 1985). On Tutari Hill (closely linked to Kwadeware in oral histories) engravings of fish, lizards and tortoises were observed (Galis 1964, p. 20). Highland Western New Guinea In 1960, a police patrol observed paintings in a cave between Bukisi (near Iris Bay) and Warombain to the south; unfortunately no additional information was collected except that the Bukisi people used the cave for funerals (Arifin and Delanghe 2004, p. 55; Galis 1964). Black paintings (motifs uncertain) were found by G. Oosterwal in the van Rees Range (Foja Mountains), east of Mamberamo River in 1963 (Galis 1964). These were associated with ancestor and cargo cults (Galis 1964). Specht (1979, p. 76) recorded over 30 sites in the Baliem valley (central western New Guinea). In 1962 A. Blokdijk and W. Westernink found red rock art on a protruding wall above an old trading pass at a height of 3850 metres, south of Wamena in the Baliem valley (Galis 1964, p. 264). These red paintings depicted animals and it was recorded that they were in good condition. Matthiessen (1963) records two rock art sites in the Baliem Valley, one in a limestone sinkhole near Abulopak village and the other near Lokoparek village. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="34">58 J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 The former consisted of charcoal drawings of humans, a rock crab and several lizards. The latter was more complex and the degree of superimposition rendered the art unrecognizable (Matthiessen 1963). Heider (1970, pp. 184, 188) observed red and black painting on Dutabut Hill and Sabulah Hill in the Baliem valley; it consisted of red hand stencils, celestial figures and black lizards. Due to logistical issues Arifin and Delanghe (2004, p. 133) were unable to visit this site, although photographs were taken for them. Arifin and Delanghe (2004, p. 136) identified four sites in this locality with motifs including anthropomorphic figures, lizards, snake-like figures and stylized paintings. Mitton (1972) recorded red marks situated on an overhanging cliff at c. 3500 m altitude on Mandala Mountain in the Digul Range, east of the Baliem valley. Engraving of a 'crude face' and 'pecked holes' was observed on a large boulder near Nabunage village, close to Karubaga, in the central highlands, west of the Baliem valley (Mitton 1972, p. 11). Arifin and Delanghe (2004, p. 56) suggested that these engravings were less polished than those observed at Doy o Lama on the banks of Lake Sentani (Arifin and Delanghe 2004, p. 56). Rock engravings were observed by the government doctor A. H. Meijer during a tour of the Arso district (southeast of Jayapura) in 1959 (Galis 1964, p. 20). These were located by the River Uyapi (Yuapi?), a side river of the Sekato, between the villages of Girwage and Sawia (Arifin and Delanghe 2004, p. 56; Galis 1964, p. 20; Mitton 1972). A steep over- grown wall was decorated with a number of engraved snakes (or penises) and vulvas (Galis 1964, p. 20). Other Sites Rock art has been recorded incidentally from other locations across wNG (Arifin and Delanghe 2004, pp. 50-55). Examples include Galis' s (1964, pp. 14-18) descriptions of animal figures painted on Mumamuran island in Cenderawasih Bay. On the adjacent island of Rumberpon five drawings in black, white and blue include a turtle and crocodile (Galis 1964, p. 16). Galis (1964, p. 16) also recorded: a motif of a lizard on Cape Suadja and Jafi village in Humboldt Bay near Jayapura; red and white drawings of a lizard, turtle and snake near Kajob village on Roon Island; and three human figures near Kaimana. A summary of incidental discoveries of rock art is given by Arifin and Delanghe (2004, pp. 50-55). Ethno-archaeology There have been large numbers of ethnographic/ethno-historical studies in wNG (cf van Baal et al. 1984; Miedema and Reesink 2004; Pétrequin and Pétrequin 2006). This section restricts itself to studies directly relating to parallels drawn with archaeological materials, in particular artefact production and distribution. Two ethno-archaeologists, Anne-Marie and Pierre Pétrequin, have maintained a long- term interest in the people and material culture of wNG (Pétrequin and Pétrequin 1993a, 1993b, 2006). Between 1984 and 1987, Pétrequin and Pétrequin (1993a, 1993b) targeted areas in the central highlands where stone axe manufacture still continued (1984: Yeleme/ Wang-kob-me and Ibele; 1985: Langda, Mulia, Yobolo, Kembe and Darai; 1987: Tagi, Ilu, Awigobi, Biganma and Gelo). Axes/adzes were viewed by farming communities as multi- functional tools (principally wood working and land clearance) but also ritual objects (war trophies, sacred axes, stones for barter) (Pétrequin and Pétrequin 1993a, pp. 361, 371). Axe ^ Springer</page><page sequence="35">J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 59 manufacture was principally the job of males, who travelled up to 180 km from their home communities to obtain stone (Pétrequin and Pétrequin 1993a, pp. 366). Three methods of production were observed: polishing siliceous pebbles to create symmetrical axe blades (e.g. Tagi, Ilu); knapping and grinding basalt river blocks (e.g. Langda); and knapping then polishing glaucophanous rock from large river blocks and cave bedrock (e.g. Kembe, Yeleme, Wang-kob-me). Circulation of axes depended on quality of material, with blades from the Yeleme-Kembe quarry (near the van Daalen River) transported throughout central Baliem in contrast to Larye-Langda basalt pebbles which were limited to the linguistic communities of Mek and their nearest neighbours (Pétrequin and Pétrequin 1993a, p. 367). 'Ritual immobilization' of axes occurred among the Dani, who stored war trophies (known as 'dead birds') in the men's meetinghouse (Pétrequin and Pétrequin 1993a, p. 371). Green schist axes, from the Swigobi and Gelo quarries in Wano country, and stone artefacts representing male, female and/or ancestors (Je) were used for ceremonial exchange at weddings and funerals (Pétrequin and Pétrequin 1993a, p. 375). 'Bud' Hampton (1999) studied horticultural practices, including the construction and maintenance of garden ditches, and axe manufacture in the Baliem gorge area (southeast of the Grand Valley). Hampton (1999, p. 26) recorded ditches lined with stones and stone walls which he expected to provide highly visible archaeological markers. The more populated Grand Valley region to the northwest was characterised by ditches of mud and fences of wood (Hampton 1999, p. 26). Hampton (1999, p. 55) concentrated on stone tool manufacture, use and symbolism. Axes and adze blades were recorded as the most prominent tool types. Four quarry areas - Yeineri, Tagime, Landgda and Sela - were identified, each of which had been targeted for the production of specific artefact types: for example, axes were made at the Yeineri and Tagime quarries (Hampton 1999, p. 59). Chert flakes were known in the Grand Valley region as moli and were used for multiple tasks, including cutting, shaping, smoothing, incising and boring (Hampton 1999, p. 78). Highlanders frequently possessed tool kits including multiple, small flakes and occasionally ceremonial objects (Hampton 1999, p. 297). No pottery or basketry was observed in the highlands, which Hampton (1999, p. 307) believed was due to the absence of a storage economy (i.e. domesticated seed plants) in the region. Hampton (1999, pp. 115-180) recorded both sacred and profane transfer, adornment and display of stone artefacts. Further information was provided on the ceremonial empowerment of specific stone axes, adzes and chisels (Hampton 1999, p. 205). Along with pig, the display-exchanges of stone artefacts were considered 'economic and social binders of the cultural systems, without which the systems would cease to exist in their present form' (Hampton 1999, p. 293). Two studies have restricted themselves to the Langda who occupy the mountainous central highlands, approximately 100 km southeast of Wamena in the Baliem Valley (Stout 2002; Toth et al. 1992). In 1990, the Langda 'axe' makers (or Kim-Yal) occupied a village consisting of 10-15 huts and a men's house (Toth et al. 1992, p. 88). Villagers raised pigs and chickens and cultivated sweet potato and taro using the terraced slopes of river valleys (Toth et al. 1992, p. 88). Men from the village manufactured fine-grained, asymmetric axes using andesite river cobbles. Axe blanks were quarried in situ , before secondary working (involving much smaller debris) took place on the periphery and inside the camp (Toth et al. 1992, p. 90). Finally, the craftsman would grind the axe against a wetted slab of sandstone (obtained from a river bed six hours' walk away), haft the axe and occasionally dab it with red ochre (Toth et al. 1992, p. 92). Grinding was required to keep the edge sharp for longer during woodworking and to assist Springer</page><page sequence="36">60 J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 re-sharpening (Toth et al. 1992, p. 92). It was observed that axes were sharpened until they either broke or could no longer function and the broken axes were brought back to the village. Hafted axes were used to clear slopes for planting, but were also an important trade item. Lukan village on the edge of the highlands was a meeting point for Langda and Kopkaka people from the lowlands 4 who pay for the axes with bowstaves, vine, fibers for mats, bird-of-paradise feathers or animal pelts' (Toth et al. 1992, p. 92). Stone axes were reputed to have travelled as far as the southern coast where they were exchanged for shells (Toth et al. 1992, p. 92). Stout (2002) observed the Langda adze makers in the Ey River valley, south of the Mek region. The Langda 'chief adze maker had ultimate control over stone resources and manufacture, therefore limiting production and ensuring the continued value of these artefacts (Stout 2002, p. 702). Manufacture in Langda involved a complicated system of apprenticeship, traditionally restricted to 12-16 year old males who were trained by a skilled adze maker (Stout 2002, p. 702). Apprentices started on small, functionally useless stone, while skilled craftsmen were given the best quarried material to produce finer adzes. A study of adze mid sections revealed a marked difference in striking angles, indicating better control by trained craftsmen. Knapping was the primary manufacturing technique, followed by grinding and polishing. The high investment of labour (both in quarrying and manufacture) in these adzes was reflected in the social importance of the finished product. The Langda named each adze after the ancestors and place of production. This extended to broken or unfinished articles which were transported home for 'proper' discard (Stout 2002). Another ethnographic study relevant to archaeology is the analysis of pottery making in the Sentani region (van der Sande 1907, cited in Solheim and Mansoben 1977; Solheim and Mansoben 1977). At Abar village van der Sande (1907, p. 10 cited in Solheim and Mansoben 1977) describes contemporary pots 'shaped like basins, as a half globe, sometimes with a rim somewhat bent outwards or broadened.' Red-brown pottery exca- vated from Marweri Urang, Kadaware was considered 'not of the same type' as pottery manufactured at Abar in Sentani or Kayu Batu in Humboldt Bay (De Bruyn 1959, pp. 5-6). Informants confirmed that the red-brown pottery was no longer manufactured. This pottery had formerly been used in burial customs where the vessel was broken and placed with the dead (De Bruyn 1959, pp. 6-7). Solheim and Mansoben (1977, p. 56) revisited Sentani in 1976 and recorded Abar as 'the only source on Lake Sentani for earthenware pottery'. Pottery manufacture was primarily a female activity, although males might collect black and brown-red clays from the lake shores a few hundred metres west of Abar (Solheim and Mansoben 1977, p. 56). Coarser material was removed from the clay and no temper added. Bowls were made by forming a cylinder out of clay, which was then left to dry for one to two weeks (Solheim and Mansoben 1977, p. 57). Coils of clay were added to the top of the vessel and pressed into shape. The pot was moulded with a paddle and the potter's hand used as an anvil (Solheim and Mansoben 1977, p. 58). The lip was smoothed, appliqué and incised designs applied, and then the opening at the base of the bowl was closed using a dampened paddle. Finally, the pot was dried and fired for approximately 30 minutes in an open fire. Solheim and Mansoben (1977, p. 61) were informed that the lack of fighting between villages allowed the wider distribution of pots than had previously been the case. Pots were exchanged for money rather than stone axes and beads (Solheim and Mansoben 1977, p. 61). No direct comparisons were made with archaeological assemblages. â Springer</page><page sequence="37">J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 61 Discussion A principal aim of this paper was to rectify a gap in knowledge by reporting existing archaeological studies from wNG. The archaeological record of wNG provides only highly fragmented glimpses of the material culture, lifeways and practices of people before the recent ethnographic and historical past. Despite these major shortcomings, archaeological investigations do provide, particularly when taken in conjunction with other lines of evi- dence (e.g. historical linguistics, palaeoecology, phylogeography), some new information on human activity in wNG and general indications of differences and similarities with more robust records from Papua New Guinea and ISEA. Arguably, these comparisons reinforce the idea of wNG as 4 a land in-between', albeit one largely unexplored archaeologically. Historical sources and archaeological materials (such as 15th century Chinese ceramics) suggest west Papuans are experienced participants in long-distance trade. The Berau Gulf appears to have been a vibrant area of internal and external exchange, a 'storehouse for the south coast peoples' and one end of a route connecting Onin (providers of sago) and Cenderawasih Bay (providers of iron) (cf Kooijman 1962, p. 77; Roxo de Brito 1582 cited in Solle wijn-Gelpke 1994). The importance of Berau Gulf during the recent period is archaeologically visible through an unusual density of rock art (including motifs depicting trade canoes and large ships), substantial ceramic middens, and the presence of large fortified settlements and cave burials. Excavations of Dudumunir suggest that the impor- tance of Berau Gulf significantly pre-dates the advent of historical records, with aceramic deposits likely to date back to the early-mid Holocene. The Lake Sentani/Jayapura region would also benefit from further research. Oral his- tories have identified important sites near Sentani. These include sacred areas with sub- surface deposits containing artefacts attributed to Dong Son cultures, originating in what is now Vietnam, and human bones interred within ceramic vessels (Figs. 17, 18). Archaeo- logical surveys identify large ceramic middens (e.g. Cape Kassoe) which have received only cursory study to date. The Sentani region is further individualised by large stone arrangements and megaliths reminiscent of the Palauan 'Great Faces' (discussion to fol- low). The majority of bronze, brass and steel artefacts have been found in the vicinity of Lake Sentani along with tantalizing reference to trade beads. A review of wNG archaeology suggests regional variation exists in rock art and material remains. For example, ceramic scatters, cave burials and painted rock art are most fre- quently found on the coast (or offshore islets) in wNG. Matutuo figures (both as wooden statues and rock art motifs) also cluster in coastal areas. In part, this is likely to reflect a sampling bias connected with the paucity of systematic archaeological research. The fol- lowing section is therefore based on existing research collated in this review article. Continuities and Discontinuities with Papua New Guinea The archaeological record of wNG can be compared with better-resolved chronologies for key aspects of material culture elements from Papua New Guinea, including: the chro- nology of early settlement; changing patterns of faunal and plant exploitation; agricultural emergence and transformation; the stone mortar, pestle and figurine complex; and rock art traditions and cultural associations (Denham in press). Several clear commonalities emerge, as we would expect given that the archaeological records pertain to one island. At the time of colonization by modern humans, Australia and New Guinea formed a contiguous land mass, called 'Sahul'. Conservative estimates place the arrival of people on â Springer</page><page sequence="38">62 J World Prehist (20 1 3) 26:25-73 Fig. 17 Map showing the location of bronze artefacts, of likely Dong Son association, found across West Papua the continent of Sahul at c. 50,000 years ago, and people rapidly inhabited most elimo- biological zones (O'Connell and Allen 2007; Denham et al. 2009; Summerhayes et al. 2010). Currently, there are no sites of comparable antiquity in wNG, although Birdsell (1977) suggested the Bird's Head Peninsula as the landing place for Pleistocene colonists on Sahul. Pas veer' s (2004) excavations indicate human activity from 26,000-24,000 years ago in wNG, with evidence of burning interpreted as anthropogenic in the interior from over 30,000 years ago (Hope and Haberle 2005). Evidence of faunal and plant exploitation associated with early colonization is scant; few sites shed light on people's practices before 30,000 years ago (Denham et al. 2009; Sutton et al. 2009; Summerhayes et al. 2010). In wNG, only four radiocarbon dated sites provide relevant data for the Pleistocene or Holocene, primarily on faunal exploitation: Mapala and Hamid rockshelters in high altitude grasslands (Hope and Hope 1976), and Kria and Toé rockshelters in lowland rainforest (Pasveer 2004). The high altitude sites indicate hunting across altitudinal zones during mid-late Holocene periods. In contrast, the lowland rainforest sites reflect consistent and major exploitation of the djief ( Dorcopsis muelleri ), with changes in faunal resource procurement through time. Although there are no comparable, published investigations of high altitude or lowland rainforest sites in the interior of Papua New Guinea, the wNG results complement and are broadly consistent with the better-dated and more systematic faunal records from excavated cave and rock- shelter sites in the mid-altitude zone (1200-2000 m) of the highlands there (Sutton et al. 2009). ^ Springer</page><page sequence="39">J World Prehist (20 1 3) 26:25-73 63 Fig. 18 Map showing location of pottery found in archaeological contexts across West Papua The agricultural history of wNG has not been investigated archaeologically; however, there are ethnographic and palaeoecological reasons to believe that early agricultural development and subsequent transformation reconstructed for the Upper Wahgi valley also occurred in the Baliem Valley and potentially elsewhere (Denham et al. 2003; Haberle 2003; Denham and Haberle 2008). Ethnographically, a range of dryland and wetland agricultural practices are recorded for upland and lowland regions of wNG (Serpenti 1965; Heider 1979), just as in Papua New Guinea (Bourke and Harwood 2009). Although the timing and nature of agricultural practices is likely to vary between valleys, as witnessed in Papua New Guinea (Denham 2007), the vegetation history of the Upper Baliem seems to indicate agriculture-related clearance and disturbance of forest from at least 7800 years ago (Haberle et al. 1991; Haberle 2003). Archaeological investigation of the wetlands in the Baliem valley and elsewhere is essential to determine the chronology of agricultural emergence and development. The stone mortar, pestle and figurine complex recorded in Papua New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago is thought to date to the mid-Holocene (Pretty 1965; Golson 2000; Swadling and Hide 2005). These stone objects include relatively simple and ornate examples, the functions of which are unclear. Multiple lines of evidence suggest the manufacture of most forms occurred before 3000 years ago: well-provenanced, radiocar- bon dated examples are mid-Holocene in age (Golson 2000; Tworek-Matuszkiewicz 2001); finds are abundant around the former Sepik-Ramu sea, but almost absent from areas within it, suggesting the distribution of artefacts stopped before its infilling ceased at c. 4000 years ago (Swadling and Hide 2005); and no examples are found in original contexts at Lapita or post-Lapita sites in the Bismarck Archipelago (Torrence and Swadling 2008). â Springer</page><page sequence="40">64 J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 Stone mortars, pestles and figurines extend across the whole island, concentrated in Papua New Guinea (Pretty 1965). Mortars and pestles have been documented from the Bird's Head to central highlands and excavated from depths of up to 2 m, suggesting considerable antiquity. The distributions of different styles of stone mortar and pestle, as well as of obsidian stemmed tools, have been used to reconstruct interaction spheres within and along the north coast of New Guinea and offshore islands, extending from Biak in the west to the Bismarck Archipelago in the east (Torrence and Swadling 2008; Torrence et al. 2009). Multiple commentators have sought to indicate correspondences between rock art tra- ditions and other cultural associations for New Guinea and adjacent regions (Specht 1979; Ballard 1992; Wilson 2004). Röder (1938a onwards) sought to show linkages between rock art styles and other material cultural traits, including pottery and megaliths. Others have sought to identify 'Austronesian' rock art styles, as opposed to indigenous and earlier styles (Ballard 1992). Although such comparisons are fraught, due to limited understanding of the chronology of different rock art techniques and motifs (Arifin and Delanghe 2004), they serve to stimulate debate in the absence of hard data. The rock art of wNG sheds critical light on a perplexing pattern inferred by previous commentators, notably that engraved rock art was a coastal phenomenon (Specht 1979). Finds from the highlands and Sentani region of wNG, as well as at Ambra Crater and other locations in Papua New Guinea, indicate that engraved forms of rock art are more wide- spread in the interior. Consequently, engraved forms of rock art are not readily associated with any period or culture. Engraved styles of rock art include anthropomorphic megaliths that are found in the Sentani region and in the Sepik region, suggesting porous cultural boundaries between wNG and eNG. The cultural associations of most forms of rock art in New Guinea are currently poorly known and await more systematic, scientific investigation. Archaeological finds of pottery in wNG have a strong coastal and lowland distribution (Fig. 17), just as in Papua New Guinea. Pottery is largely absent from the highlands, although it has been documented in archaeological and ethnographic contexts in parts of the Eastern Highlands (e.g. Arona Valley; Swadling 1973) and other locations (e.g. Wañelek; Bulmer 1991) in Papua New Guinea. The antiquity of pottery on the island of New Guinea is undergoing revision following the discovery of c. 3000 year-old Lapita pottery on the south coast in the Gulf of Papua (McNiven et al. 201 1), and this is likely to continue once further archaeological excavations are undertaken. In sum, multiple lines of archaeological evidence demonstrate clear commonalities between wNG and Papua New Guinea. The absence of well-dated and systematically excavated sites in wNG prevents detailed comparison; however, these deficiencies are partially alleviated through comparison of poorly provenanced finds in wNG with better- resolved chronologies from eNG. The resultant impression is one of continuity rather than discontinuity up to the late Holocene. Rock art and artefact distributions suggest that the inferred spheres of interaction in Papua New Guinea are likely to have incorporated parts of wNG. However, several elements of potential discontinuity, or least uncertainty, emerge in relation to understanding ISEA influences on wNG during the late Holocene (i.e. after 4000 years ago). Western New Guinea and Island Southeast Asia During the early and mid Holocene, interactions between wNG and Wallacea are witnessed by the westward movement of marsupials (Heinsohn 2010), as well as the inferred movements of bananas and other plants (e.g. Denham 2010, 20 11; Donohue and Denham Ô Springer</page><page sequence="41">J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 65 2010; Perrier et al. 201 1). Just as maritime movement and exchange occurred within Papua New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago at points during the Pleistocene and Holocene, similar types of maritime interaction were almost certainly occurring in areas further west. As yet, the evidence for these interactions is scant (Bulbeck 2008), reflecting largely the absence of appropriate archaeological investigations. The connection between Asia and wNG is easier to trace in the late Holocene, at which point ceramic technology, bronze axes, some painted rock art styles and (presumably) domesticated chickens ( Gallus gallus ), dogs and pigs were all introduced from the west. Although domesticated animals are not considered in detail here, largely due to the very limited archaeological record in wNG, all three originated in Southeast Asia (Donohue and Denham 2010). Bronze objects are found at multiple locations near lake Sentani and the Bird's Head (see Fig. 17). Dong Son artefacts are expected to have originated in Vietnam and China after 3000 BP. The presence of bronzes, especially of Dong Son drums and other bronze artefacts, after 2300 BP in east Asia, the Moluccas, wNG and the Admiralty Islands provides 'a moment of archaeological visibility' for expansive trade networks involving Asia and Melanesia (Golson 1972, p. 582; Kempers 1988; Spriggs and Miller 1988). Certainly, the occurrence of megaliths and bronze artefacts in wNG has stimulated the archaeological imagination for over 70 years. The 'megalithic culture' evident in Sentani is considered to have temporally overlapped and to have assimilated Dong Son cultural elements with sites such as Marweri Urang containing evidence for megaliths and bronze artefacts (De Bruyn 1959, p. 8; see also Soejono 1963, p. 8; Solheim 1979, p. 327). It is worth noting that many of the Sentani artefacts have been described as unique within Indonesia (Soejono 1963, p. 6). Historical sources identify local manufacture of metal artefacts in Triton and Cenderawasih Bay. A fragment of bronze spear mould from Jembekaki suggests that exotic artefacts may have been re-moulded from the Bird's Head Peninsula to Jayapura. Significantly, similar bronze artefacts have not been found in Papua New Guinea, although stone artefacts do occur that some have argued were based on bronze artefact forms (Bulmer and Clarke 1970). Röder (1938b; also Tichelman 1953) suggested that localised developments in the Sentani region during the Neolithic encompassed restricted distributions of megaliths (as well as the system of bride-price and convex roof house styles). Riesenfeld (1950, p. 520) believed this represented two Neolithic migrations from ISEA to New Guinea: the earlier, from southern Indonesian islands via the Moluccas to the Bird's Head region, was largely restricted to wNG; and the later, from Palau via the Philippines and northern Sulawesi to the Sepik region, was largely restricted to Papua New Guinea. Riesenfeld (1950, p. 387; also Soejono 1963, p. 9) speculated that the earlier migration was marked by painted rock art while the later included engraved art, megaliths, mortars and pestles, the coiling method of pottery, square axes, coconut palms, pigs, the custom of head-hunting, funeral cere- monies and stories about cultural origins in the east. Similar megalith sites have been recorded in Papua New Guinea in the Jimi and Waghi valleys and at Goodenough Bay (Rosenfeld 1988). Although the specifics of Röder' s, Riesenfeld' s and Rosenfeld' s interpretations are all questionable, the occurrence of Dong Son-style bronzes in wNG is puzzling. Do they represent direct trade by mariners from the Asian mainland, or were they passed along networks of more localised exchange? Roxo de Brito (cited in Solle wijn-Gelpke 1994, pp. 137-138) confirms that iron gongs (as opposed to gold, common on Bird's Head and Onin Peninsulas) were highly valued in Cenderawasih Bay, raided from Gébé during the 16th century. If the claimed associations between bronze artefacts and other material Springer</page><page sequence="42">66 J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 cultural traits, such as pottery or megaliths, could be ascertained through archaeological excavation, then the former interpretation would seem valid. Certainly the Sentani region seems key to unravelling this mystery. Several pottery styles have been documented in archaeological contexts across wNG (cf. May and Tuckson 2000 for Papua New Guinea), but most are poorly described and only a handful are associated with radiocarbon dated contexts (Pasveer 2004). Compari- sons have been noted between ceramics in wNG and ISEA. Bell wood (1997, p. 219) identified the 'continual presence of incised, stamped circle, and punctuate decoration' in both areas. Specific comparisons were drawn between the impressed and red slipped pottery in the Bird's Head and ceramics from Sulawesi (Soejono 1963). Solheim (1998, p. 30) believed that 'incising with interlocking scrolls' from ceramics in Makbon resem- bled Sa-Huynh-Kalanay pottery from Southeast Asia, while terracotta heads from Je- mbekaki were linked to bowl handles from ISEA (Galis 1958). Ellen and Glover (1974) suggested that Dudumunir 'parallels in almost every respect' ceramic assemblages from caves in Timor. Chinese ceramics (dating from the early 1 5th century) have been observed in caves around wNG (Röder 1959). As ceramics are poorly described, and only a handful associated with radiocarbon dated contexts, it is currently uncertain how the various styles compare to the more established pottery chronologies from ISEA, Papua New Guinea and the Bismarck Archipelago, including Lapita. Pottery technology (cord/paddle impressed/red slip) is likely to derive from ISEA, and became variably adopted in the New Guinea region (Solheim and Mansoben 1977; Röder 1959). Similarities have been observed between sub-surface ceramics from Dudumunir and pottery belonging to the Early Pottery Period (EPP), dating to after 2000 years ago, on the south coast of Papua New Guinea (Spriggs 1998). Again, Sentani stands out with 'stylized rope design' similar to motifs from Melanesia and Western Polynesia rather than Asia (Galis 1964, p. 23). The custom of putting human bones in pottery vessels is common in eNG, wNG and east Indonesia (Bedford and Spriggs 2007; Swadling 1996, p. 274); Bedford and Spriggs (2007) suggest that this practice originated in ISEA but was rein- vented in New Guinea within the past 1000 years. Describing, disentangling and dating the pottery styles of wNG could greatly increase our understanding of the late Holocene history of all these neighbouring regions, potentially including the origins of Lapita (Kirch 1997). Rock art raises significant issues concerning the settlement history of wNG. Direct comparisons exist between paintings in wNG and Timor Leste, with social/cultural links expected between the two regions (Arifin and Delanghe 2004, p. 144; Ballard 1992, p. 95; O'Connor 2003). Similar art is observed in the Moluccas, Kai Islands and Bougainville Islands, and has been referred to as Western Pacific rock art (e.g. Wilson 2004). Ballard (1992, p. 98; also Röder 1959) attributed this artistic tradition to Austronesian migrations within the past 4000 years, due to similarities between rock art motifs, bronze artefacts and painted pottery. Röder (1959, p. 82) pointed out parallel representation of ships in wNG, the Molluccas and Sulawesi, and the possibility that these were related to canoe burials observed in the Berau Gulf and elsewhere. For example, ship burials are common in Dong Son sites in ISEA (van Liem 2005; see Ballard et al. 2003, p. 391 for further details). The association of rock art with Austronesian speaking areas (Ballard 1992, p. 98; O'Connor 2003, p. 12) has recently been questioned based on examples from Timor Leste (Arifin and Delanghe 2004, p. 144; Wilson 2004). Tenuous comparisons exist between wNG and Australia through the 'boomerang' motif (Chaloupka 1993, p. 123). Chaloupka (1993, p. 246) suggested rock art in the Bitsyari Bay region 'shares several basic features with the MacCluer [Berau] Gulf corpus situated some â Springer</page><page sequence="43">J World Prehist (2013) 26:25-73 67 170 km to the north, it is also considerably different, and in its complexity more akin to the art of the Arnhem Land Plateau'. In Arnhem Land, similar motifs occurred during the pre- estuarine period (before 7000 BP), suggesting interaction may have occurred prior to the flooding of Sahul. Based on megaliths and engraved faces in the Sentani district, Rie- senfeld (1950) suggested influences from Micronesia. Links were further drawn between materials from a rock shelter to the east of Maundori and Palau. In the absence of detailed analysis, description and chronology these models remain unresolved. Conclusion: Western New Guinea as a Land In-Between In this review, literature in several different languages has been collated to present a comprehensive archaeological overview for wNG. The assessment of existing knowledge provides a foundation for future archaeological research in the region. The review has been written in order to evaluate the position of wNG with respect to ISEA (to the west) and Papua New Guinea (to the east), by eliciting points of continuity and discontinuity with those regions through time. Although the archaeological record for wNG is highly fragmentary, it is clear that there are considerable similarities with Papua New Guinea. Such continuities are to be expected given spatial contiguity. However, several important points of uncertainty and potential variability emerge during the late Holocene with respect to contacts with ISEA. Principal among these are Dong Son influences in wNG that are not clearly visible in the archae- ological record of Papua New Guinea. Fundamentally, the nature of the in-between status of wNG with respect to Indo-Pacific prehistory will await systematic archaeological investigations in the region. Only then can wNG shed light on several highly significant questions in Indo-Pacific prehistory, ranging from the emergence of agriculture to the origins of Lapita.
