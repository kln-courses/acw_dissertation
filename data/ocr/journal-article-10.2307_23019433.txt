Many of these are rather small, easily corrected items when they occur in isolation, but when numerous problems accumulate in one manuscript, they distract the reader from the ideas and contents being conveyed and become a cause for concern. There is evi dence that musicians' appearance may affect their performance evaluations (see Ryan &amp; Costa-Giomi, 2004, for example) and that "handwriting legibility systematically biases evaluations of author abilities and grades assigned to the respective essays" (Greifeneder et al., 2010, p. 235). To make the transfers explicit: If an author submits a manuscript in which the writing is sloppy or poor, the reviewers may assume that the author was equally sloppy in carrying out his or her research, whether or not such a judgment is justified. Although it should be clear that manuscripts rife with distracting, careless writing problems would not make a good impression on editorial committee members or editors (or doctoral committees), I have found that authors submit such manuscripts surprisingly often. In an effort to assist authors, and less altruistically, to make my work and the job of the reviewers easier, I have compiled a "Top Ten List" of common "technical" writing issues and ways to resolve them. This list is presented roughly in order from most to least important or egregious: 1. The most successful literature reviews are organized around ideas and are not merely compendia of studies presented one at a time. Paragraphs should begin with clear topic sentences and rarely with "So and So (19XX) did this . . followed by a paragraph beginning with "Thus and So (20XX) did that " Starting a paragraph with a citation should be a rare occurrence. 2. Be parsimonious with the use of tables and figures. Journals have a limited page allocation, so every bit of saved space is precious. Theories with com plex relationships, data with large sets of numbers, or analyses with compli cated interactions may indeed require the clarity of a figure or table or graph, but readers should be able to compare four means and standard devi ations, for instance, without the assistance of a visual representation. 3. Use past or past perfect tense to discuss anything that happened at a definite point in time; for example, results of a research project that has been</page><page sequence="2">4 Journal of Research in Music Education 59(1) completed, and authors' written opinions, ideas, and thoughts. What Author A wrote is not still being written, what Author B believed she may or may not still believe, and what "numerous authors have described" they are not still describing. Past tense usually should be used when discussing the results of a study (i.e., "results indicated that tigers sang more songs than lions"), because present tense typically implies generalization (i.e., "results indicate that tigers sing more songs than lions"), which likely is beyond the scope of the data collected. 4. When discussing results of cross-sectional research, be careful to use lan guage that makes it clear that the research was not longitudinal. The longi tudinal implication of "as tigers grew heavier, they sang for significantly more minutes per day" is different from the cross-sectional finding that "tigers in each successive weight category sang for significantly more min utes per day than did tigers in lower weight categories." 5. Use active voice to the extent possible. This includes using first person to identify the author(s), when such use will improve clarity. "I selected the pieces" is preferable to "the pieces were selected." (The manuscript's abstract is an exception, however, and should be written in third person, if pronouns are necessary.) 6. Be sure that there are human subjects for human actions—in other words, avoid anthropomorphism. "Studies" do not "examine" or "draw conclusions"; authors do. 7. When making a comparative statement, be sure that the comparison is clear and specific. The conclusion that "the authors concluded that tigers living in the zoo sang more songs" is neither clear nor specific. ("More" than what? Tigers living in the wild? Lions living in the zoo?) 8. Consider word choices carefully, and err on the side of formal language, as opposed to colloquial. Avoid contractions. Write "although" instead of "though," and do not substitute "while" if the meaning is not "contiguous with." Likewise, do not use "as" or "since" to substitute for "because." Can data really "show" or do they perhaps "indicate" instead? Use abbreviations spar ingly (use "and so forth" instead of "etc.," for example). And so forth! 9. Be careful to avoid common basic grammatical errors. Read for singular plural agreement (and remember that "data" is a plural word). Use "that" in a sentence without a comma, and "which" in a clause after a comma. Try not to split infinitives, with "also" or any other adverb, unless absolutely necessary for clarity. Let no clauses/modifiers dangle or be misplaced (e.g., "While recording with a video camera, each tiger sang a favorite song" would only be accurate if these talented singing felines also were operating the video camera!). 10. Edit and proofread with a critical eye for detail. What is the difference between an "en" dash and an "em" dash (- or —)? How are results of cor relations summarized numerically in the body of the paper? When should</page><page sequence="3">Forum 5 italics be used instead of underlines? Does the comma go inside or outside of the quotation marks? What is the correct punctuation for footnotes? Most authors cannot answer all of these questions off the top of their heads and should not be expected to—that is what the style manuals should be used for! Many K-12 schools, colleges, and universities have implemented extensive "writing across the curriculum" programs, based on the assumption that clear writing is an indi cation of clear thinking. Although elegant writing may be a worthy goal for authors, clear and precise writing should be sufficient. It is interesting that the bias for good versus poor legibility found by Greifeneder et al. (2010) did not extend to "differences in handwriting beauty"—writing that was legible was good enough. The authors did conclude, however, that the legibility variable seemed to reflect the evaluators' under lying assumptions about the writers' fluency. If the legibility of handwriting can infl uence evaluators' judgments in such a systematic way, it does not seem like a large leap of logic to assume that poor writing style might have a similar effect on assumptions made by journal reviewers. I hope that my "Top Ten List" will assist authors with thinking about the clarity, precision, and details of their writing and help them present their work to its best advantage, so that their readers and reviewers may focus on what is most important, the substance of the research and the quality of the thinking that went into it.
