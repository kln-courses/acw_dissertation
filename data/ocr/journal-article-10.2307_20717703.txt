<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nietzsche and Freud: Questions of Life and Death Ullrich Michael Haase Let us beware of saying that death is opposed to life. The living is merely a type of what is dead, and a very rare type. ?Nietzsche, The Gay Science ? 109 Introduction In the passage from which the above quotation is drawn, Nietzsche out lines what we have to do in order to remain victorious in the face of the shadows of the decomposing God. All the shadows of God, which still darken our lives, can be characterised under the heading of an anthropomorphic interpretation of the universe. In other words, we suffer from modern man, from him who, to quote the Anti-Christ, is "everything that knows not which way to turn" (? 1); we suffer from humanism, and we hence suffer from the idea of individuality based on the subjectivity of the subject. This Nietzschean analysis is well known, and yet its consequences of ten remain obscure, while Nietzsche himself is understood according to the very same shadows of God which he describes in The Gay Science. That is to say, to use one of the more famous examples, Nietzsche's dictum that there are only interpretations, that the whole of language is nothing more than a movable host of metaphors, is understood as meaning that language has finally denied us any access to the real. It does not even matter whether this "perspectivism" is understood, in its turn, as meaning something vaguely positive?following the insight that "if God is dead, then everything is al lowed"?or whether this belief in the exclusive existence of interpretations is understood as being negative, insofar as it no longer matters if something is allowed or not, since it will happen anyway. As Nietzsche makes clear, the point is that the desired, without having changed its place, is now un veiled as impossible, rather than as forbidden. Journal of Nietzsche Studies, Issue 17, 1999. Copyright ? 1999 The Friedrich Nietzsche Society. 33</page><page sequence="2">34 Ullrich Michael Haase What does matter is that, on the ground of this interpretation (following Kant's exposition of transcendental philosophy as the Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics; absolutised in Hegel's realisation that the world, en gendered in this way by the human soul, is by no means finite, or rather, is not limited through anything of its kind; developed in Schopenhauer as the world understood as the manifestation of a will itself beyond the grasp of consciousness), we have reached an extreme standpoint, namely, that a cri tique of the human situation has become impossible, the more so because a discrimination between the human and its other has been declared impos sible. Transcendental philosophy becomes absolute already in the philosophi cal argument against the Kantian system of negative, albeit regulative, ideas, which presumably separate the human from the non-human, and in the his torical argument against Hegel, namely, that this discrimination will not lose its necessity through a becoming absolute of human life.1 Instead any relation of the human being to a beyond of its transcendental horizon (even one negatively conceived) is, in a movement reminiscent of the discoveries of psychoanalysis, interiorized as a suspicion against the self and its inter nal divisions. What does matter, in other words, is the realisation that both these in terpretations, the positive as well as the negative evaluation of a relativism presumably arising from Nietzsche's work, must be wrong?insofar as they are in any case meaningless, and insofar as they both remain within a hu manistic framework and do so precisely insofar as they understand an inter pretation to be the effect of a more or less conscious mind. Thus, to say that there are only interpretations has repeatedly been un derstood as the antiphilosophical stance perse: if philosophy is, since Plato, determined as the politically motivated attempt to turn opinions or beliefs into knowledge, then Nietzsche's individualism must mean that we have finally realised that there are only beliefs, that there is nothing left besides that divine faculty, called the will, of whose boundless but divine nature Descartes has already warned us in his forth Meditation. The problem with this interpretation of transcendental philosophy can be shown by way of its metaphor arising in psychoanalysis, namely, in the figure of projection, which recuperates the Hegelian notion of dialectics. If I can attribute a defence strategy to the warlike ego by means of which it can overcome its internal enemy despite the lack of inwardly effective defence systems, then the sus picion will immediately arise that, in the outward enemy, I am but facing myself. The credibility of this argument even depends on the fact that it seems to be critical, that it appears as if the ego concedes one of its secrets, while still being able to hide that the secret rather consists in the desirability of this effect of projection. The result of uncovering this notion of rejection</page><page sequence="3">Nietzsche and Freud 35 can then be described as follows: it renders the suspicion against the ap pearing world again possible?that is, it makes it possible to suspect, be hind the world of appearances, the eternal war between two principles which themselves are undetectable by the system perception-consciousness, al though they can be unearthed by the effort of the analyst?and this suspi cion, in turn, allows for the phantasm that the ego can remain victorious through self-control or self-discovery. In other words, what hides behind the radical intervention of Freudian psychoanalysis is Christian morality based on an equally Christian conception of the human being. After the death of God, we too easily understand Nietzsche as an indi vidualist, who, precisely for that reason, would no longer be a philosopher, insofar as, to quote Bataille, "a basic problem is linked to the very idea of philosophy: how to get out of the human situation" (1992,13). And yet, as we know all too well, the absolute subjectivity of a will having become absolute and boundless cannot be the meaning of Nietzsche's perspectivism either. It suffices to quote at random a note from 1886: "Es giebt gar keinen Willen [there is no such thing as a will]" (Nietzsche, Nachla? vol. 12, p. 187). As Georg Picht has rightly outlined in his book on Nietzsche, the thesis that Nietzsche exceeds metaphysics depends on the demonstration that he "blows up the subjectivity of the subject" (1988,17). And Kcht goes on to say that this accomplishment had already but unwit tingly been achieved in the step from finite to absolute spirit in which sub jectivity is, "as it were behind Hegel's back," blown up. Nietzsche's deed could thus be described as having drawn our attention to the fact that Hegel's attempt to recapture absolute spirit in the reflexive structure of finite con sciousness has failed.2 Instead of withdrawing on a reinstatement of Nietzsche's paradoxical way of writing, which would disturb any attempt at a coherent reading, we could first of all draw out an answer that Nietzsche gives himself as to the dilemma between these old dichotomies of the spontaneous will battling against the mechanistic nature of the material world. Far from implying that the realisation of life as a very rare form of death would signify the victory of materialism over idealism, this answer is given in terms reminiscent of the age of Hegel and Schelling, and it follows the enumeration of the diverse shadows of God in ? 109 of The Gay Science: "When may we," Nietzsche asks, "begin to naturalise us humans in terms of the pure, newly discovered, newly redeemed nature?" (p. 169; trans. Modified). In a similar mood to Schelling, who had searched for the core of philosophy, that is, for the unity of freedom and necessity, in a philosophy of nature, Nietzsche asks us to overcome the predicament of the human condition ensuing from Christianity through a re-naturalisation of the human being. The philosophy of nature is</page><page sequence="4">36 Ullrich Michael Haase hence for Nietzsche nothing else than the attempt to find a way out of the horizon of transcendental philosophy, and it is this attempt that places him in the line from Schelling, via Nietzsche, to Heidegger. It is for the very same reason that the Overman, in his positive relation to the Eternal Return of the Same, is conceived of as a return to animal life as well as through its separation from it.3 Yet again: the re-naturalisation of the human being ne cessitates an overcoming of transcendental philosophy. The question I will try to address through Nietzsche's contention about the essence of life hence is, speaking from within a Nietzschean register, the following: "On which side of the decision effected by the Eternal Return of the Same will we find psychoanalysis?" This question is neither supposed to grant us a final judgement on psychoanalysis nor supposed to claim that psychoanalysis is one single entity, which could be enacted in different forms of practises, which, in turn, could be determined as being closer or further away from the true idea of psychoanalysis. Rather, I would like to redraw the outlines of another match between a purportedly dualistic philosophy and a monism, which, since Spinoza, has found its terminus ad quern in a philosophy of nature. For the sake of being able to approach this philosophy of nature, I will follow Derrida's ambiguous lead, by positioning psycho analysis as the hinge between a before and an after the end of metaphysics. To be more precise, I will try to position Freud's psychoanalysis in that juncture. In doing so, I run the risk of dating the "end of metaphysics" through the writings of Husserl, Saussure, and Freud, through these famous attempts at a rejuvenation of modern, rationalist philosophy, that is to say, through a couple of decades whose limitation can be described through its agitated defence of scientific rationality against the spirit of relativism. This fight against its ghost has triggered its flight into a positivistic understanding of science, moderated by a humanistic understanding of the central role the concept of intuition is to play in the scientific enterprise, so as to rescue it from progressive technicisation. The ambiguity of this stance has in turn led to the paradoxical unity of a veracity turned into self-suspicion and a dog matic blindness turned into trust. Let me legitimate this starting point. Derrida says about Foucault that he "does and does not wish to situate Freud in an historically stabilised and identifiable place, which would be open to a univocal apprehension" (1992, 149). And yet, Derrida is quick to assert that he himself does not wish to criticise this placement of the Freudian moment as such, but that he rather aims at distancing himself from the age whose vantage point is implied in</page><page sequence="5">Nietzsche and Freud 37 Foucault's critique. This age, described by Foucault as that space inside of which we still think, is no other than the transcendental philosophy manifest in the tradition of Kant's critical enterprise. And, through this move, we have returned to Picht's description of Nietzsche's thought as aiming to wards the very moment at which we can locate Nietzsche, himself, at the juncture of the end of metaphysics. I quote the same sentence of Picht again, this time in its entirety: If we remain adamant in claiming that Nietzsche's philosophy has to be understood as transcendental philosophy, while at the same time insisting that this philosophy is no longer metaphysical, then we will have to prove that transcendental thought, by making history its sole content, transforms itself in such a way that it explodes the subjectivity of the subject. (1988, 19) The real qu?stion, looming behind this essay, is consequently a question concerning the ability to think and experience the end of metaphysics in and through an age which determines the place according to which, as Foucault has said,'we still speak. This location of Nietzsche and Freud around the problem of an overcoming of transcendental philosophy is hence not unmo tivated. In other words, it does exceed the horizon of a history of philosophy and is hence not directly concerned with the philological myth of the posi tivity of a text giving rise to a claim of "doing justice to Nietzsche and Freud" while still following a moral demand, which Heidegger has expressed in his Grundbegriffe der Metaphysik, where he says, unambiguously: "Tran scendental philosophy has to fall as well" (1983, p. 522).4 It's a Dog's Life; or: je sens un chien sur-moi How to get the complex into sight? Facing two claims of a liberation of mankind, having intimated the complex from which liberation is sought, and finding ourselves in a situation where we are resolved to locate an answer by questioning the vicinity of Nietzsche's and Freud's thinking, we might begin by a short reconsideration of that which Foucault calls the irony of the dispositive called psychoanalysis, that lies "in having us believe that our 'liberation' is in the balance" (1987, p. 159). The first sign that we are dealing with irony is given through a reflection on the history of philosophy, which can be described as a rhythm of dualisms followed by monistic struc tures, in which the latter substantiate their claim to liberation from the im passe of a position that, from its point of inception, sacrifices any attempt at redemption. Hence Heraclitus's attempt to redeem the eternal opposition of being and non-being in Parmenides' Lehrgedicht', hence Aristotle's criti cism of Plato's philosophy as imperfect metaphor; hence Leibniz's and</page><page sequence="6">38 Ullrich Michael Haase Spinoza's rejection of Descartes' separation of from a ; hence Schilling's and Hegel's exposure of the Kantian stalemate, expressed by an imperative that will not make us good, at least not during this life. What we meet in Freud is a renewed attempt at a liberation which pre sents itself, from the outset, as without any hope. The liberation we are talking about is not at all the liberation towards an endless fulfilment of the pleasure principle; that is to say, it is not first and foremost that we can hope properly to regulate the ego 's path to happiness, even if the analyst promises to be of help, once one has strayed from that path. Rather, what is at stake is a liberation from hope itself, as hope cannot be but disappointed in the real economy of life. Freud's discourse proceeds with the impetus of a ruthless and proud attack of the will to truth against any attempt to falsify this very economy. If it is that we shall be liberated from the lies that are told about the nature of human life, then this liberation issues, not into an enjoyment of freedom, but into the realisation of the impossibility of freedom generally. It is the highest crime of culture, as Freud says, that we are not prepared for the importance of the sexual drives and hence lack a premonition of the violence whose victims we will of necessity become. And this warning is, first of all, not intended to guard the individual against the other human being, but rather directed at the unveiling of the brute forces inhabiting and ruling over our own being. In other words, this crime of education consists in the child not being prepared for the rule of the eternal battle between the two heavenly powers, that is, between Eros and Thanatos (see Freud 1972,129)?a battle that determines human life as ruled by violence and war on many fronts: against the overpowering force of nature (82), against all other human beings (homo est homini lupus [102]), and against itself, insofar as the ego is engaged in constant war with an id that tries to win back territory lost to the ego, and with an over ego, constituted by the invasion of the other into the sphere of the ego. These wars are unavoidable, and the liberation at stake aims at the ability of the individual to fight this war, not to its advantage, but for its survival in this "game of selection and adaptation" (82). The liberation of the human being can thus only be achieved by a scepticism that seeks its welfare in science as methodological analysis. If the nineteenth century can be described as that age which fought ide alism for idealistic reasons (see Mann 1972,137), then Freud does consti tute a definite break with that spirit on the grounds of an unavowed system of values, including a value of (human) life, which from the basis of his</page><page sequence="7">Nietzsche and Freud 39 critique remains unintelligible. At the same stroke, Freud's text marks the twentieth-century break from the great discourses on nature characterising the nineteenth century. While Schelling sought after the system of freedom in the unity of spirit and nature; while Nietzsche hoped for a supersession of nihilism through the naturalisation of man, and while, later, Heidegger would attempt to experience "if from a distance, the proximity of decisions lying in the future" (1967, 240) by means of a reconsideration of the concept of nature, Freud instinctively distrusts nature. It is one of the most remarkable facts, although often ignored, that we are today highly embarrassed by the mere use of the word nature. Hence, against all those "friends" that profess to an "oceanic feeling," in other words, against all religion and art, and against any discourse on nature led outside the realm of modern, natural sciences, all of which he understands as an attempt to divert from the real nature of human suffering, Freud unleashes a discourse determined to un mask their suppressive character: "Their technique consists," as he says in Das Unbehagen in der Kultur, "in devaluing life and in distorting the im age of the real world in a manic fashion. This technique implies the suppres sion and intimidation of the intellect" (1972, 82). It should be clear that we can here expose the most explicit contrast between Nietzsche's and Freud's thought, and that this contrast consists not only in their absolutely contrary understandings of nature, art, and the na ture of the intellect, but, more to the point, in a misrecognition of philosophy on Freud's part. As far as the latter is concerned, philosophy cannot be of any help in establishing the justification of such a claim to an "oceanic feel ing." Rather, it is from the outset decided that the plane inside of which this question has to be settled is that of the natural sciences, which, of course, means that the question is decided before it is even taken up. Freud, the master of suspicion, is, as soon as it comes to his method, in the same posi tion as Galilei, as described by Husserl. He is to such a degree habituated to the modes of scientific investigation that the possibility of any reflection on their veracity is quite out of the question. It is in this sense that Nietzsche surpasses Freud's limitations, and, following Husserl's investigation into the mathematisation of nature, it is precisely through this blindness that the sense of scientific rationality is lost (Husserl 1982,50). This misrecognition consists, on the one hand, in Freud's explicit denial of philosophy for the sake of science and, on the other, in his unconscious philosophy.5 The cri tique of Freud on the part of Thomas Mann in Freud und die Zukunft, is hence announced from the perspective of Freud's "friends" referred to in Das Unbehagen in der Kultur, that is, from the perspective of that very "oceanic feeling" of which Freud cannot find any instance in himself, and whose content is the "mystery of the unity of man and world":</page><page sequence="8">40 Ullr?ch Michael Haase I believe that philosophy is indeed placed above and prior to the natural sciences, and that all methodology and exactitude stands in the service of its will conceived through the history of Spirit [im Dienst ihres geistesgeschichtlichen Willens], Finally it is always a question of the Quod erat demonstrandum. The presuppositionlessness of science is or at least should be a moral fact. Considered from the vantage point of spirit, the natural sciences are probably that which Freud calls an illusion. To bring this matter more to the point, one could say that the natural sciences have never made any discovery to which they had not beforehand been authorised and instructed by philosophy. (Mann 1972,141) That Freudian psychoanalysis is, as Foucault stipulates, the logical con clusion of Christianity can already be seen in the conjunction of two mo tives of Nietzsche's thought: first, that of describing the Christian economy of hope, namely as a hope that in principle cannot be fulfilled by any actual ity, so that it cannot be contradicted by it either (cf. Nietzsche, Der Anti christ), and, second, that of determining the task of science after the will to truth has turned against itself, namely, to conduct the experiment as to how far truth allows for incorporation. These topics run through Freud's work at both the explicit level and perceptibly behind that limitation given by an intimation of relativism and his defence against it. Freud's shortcomings can thus be described in terms of the same horizon, namely, in relation to the reduction of his philosophical stance to a scientificity, which, again, instead of realising its origin in Christianity and hence its complicity with Chris tianity, withdraws on the purportedly exclusive disjunction of religion and science. The cost of this exercise consists in a dependence on the "natural attitude" and the restriction of its methodology to "half the task at hand"; that is to say, its misrecognition of analysis. It is hence not by chance that the task and the position of the psychoanalyst can be understood in analogy to the malin g?nie of Descartes, insofar as his apparition is as necessary to his existence as is his disappearance. And yet, it should not come as a sur prise that the victory over the malin g?nie is a phantasmagoric victory hid ing the suppression or even the loss of an other. Freud's method is through and through analytic. That is to say, it is indebted to the enlightenment in that it understands its task as turning with the highest vigilance against appearances of reality in order to expose them in their illusionary character. But that is as well the reason for which the psychoanalyst has to disappear, insofar as she is, by virtue of her method, restricted to half the task at hand: her task consists of the dis-investment of all values by means of a relentless sobriety, while she is absolutely helpless as regards a re-valuation of life. Indeed, the question even arises, following the above quote from Das Unbehagen in der Kultur, how Freud could ac</page><page sequence="9">Nietzsche and Freud 41 cuse Christianity for "devaluing life," considering that it is difficult to find a basis in Freud's text which would allow for any values whatever, without that these would immediately turn into illusions (Freud 1972,82). This is already the reason for which Thomas Mann posits himself, the poet, against the scientist, the analyst Freud. The problem is not, in its es sence, that Freud restricts himself to analysis, but that the essence of analy sis?and hence equally the essence of that which can be "found" and "ex posed" by means of analysis?depends on this very restriction. If we deal with a decision as to the validity of a philosophy of nature, then, first of all, we have to understand how the phenomenon of nature can and does appear at all. Insofar as this phenomenon is supposed to allow us access to a reality that extends further than the reality of scientific inquiry?taken that Nietzsche here seeks a phenomenon that grounds the will to truth, of which the sci ences as we know them are but a part?it is clear that a scientific investiga tion into nature as one of its objects does not bring us any further, but re mains a mere tautology (cf. Heidegger 1979,2ff.). In other words, the prob lem with the quod erat demonstrandum lies not only with the form of de mand, but also, already, with the "demonstration" itself. The object of "that which was to be demonstrated" just cannot be nature, and somebody who tries to demonstrate that there is, or rather that there is not, something like nature, that is, something that has the principle of its beginning in itself, shows through this very undertaking that she is talking about nothing but mere denominations. We are thinking of the famous passage from Aristotle's Physics: It would be a perfectly silly attempt to demonstrate that there are natural things. Is it not self-evident that many of the existing things are of this category? But to demonstrate something self-evident with something not self-evident, is the deed of somebody who cannot distinguish between those things that can be known through themselves and those things that cannot be known through themselves?it is well-known that this can happen to people: it is equally possible that somebody who has been bom blind, wit tily talks about colours?,so that such people, by necessity, only talk about the denominations of things, without comprehending them. (2.1.193a3-9; trans, modified) Who attempts in this way to prove scientifically that there cannot be any thing natural reminds of somebody who recently wanted to prove the reality of the object of modern physics to us by asking us to jump out of his window on the twenty-third floor, or of somebody who tries to prove the existence of freedom by lifting her arm without any purpose. Yet, taken Freud's pride concerning the fact that the topology of con sciousness has allowed psychoanalysis to develop into a proper science, it</page><page sequence="10">42 Ullrich Michael Haase seems that his method is, from the very beginning, stuck within the "natural attitude." And considering further Freud's contentions as to "the natural state," including the comprehension of culture as an antidote to that very suffering inflicted by the overwhelming power of nature, it seems that Freud, himself, has neither the means nor the will to reflect on the "natural atti tude," but that he is committed, to use Nietzsche's words, to "build his death bed on a certain nothing rather than on an uncertain something" (Jenseits von Gut und B?se 1, ? 10, p. 23).6 Yet the most important point as to an understanding of a philosophy of nature beyond transcendental philosophy is the ground on which the scientific nature of psychoanalysis is established, namely, on the reduction of its phenomena to the objective existence of space. Concluding these arguments, it is not surprising that psychoanalysis has no less difficulty speaking about female sexuality than it has using the word nature, although a somewhat banal idea of a natural state does lie behind its assumptions. This unease professes not only to a problem in the structure of psychoanalysis, but also bears witness to the break of Freud with the nineteenth century generally. Sketching a Philosophy of Nature We have tried to come closer to the possible sense of a philosophy of nature, by positioning it historically as an answer to the necessity of overcoming transcendental philosophy, by way of its ability to overcome the century-old stalemate that locates the human being in the midst of necessity and free dom, of form and matter, of culture and nature, and so on. The prolegomena to such a philosophy consists of a description of both the essence of con sciousness ?nd the essence of nature itself, in contradistinction to which we understand consciousness. Such a prolegomena is the more difficult? Merleau-Ponty has shown this point quite convincingly?as our attempt at an understanding of nature issues immediately into its reversion in the "natural attitude," which is itself merely the product of the self-negation of conscious ness. This misrecognition was at issue when Nietzsche called on us to avoid the understanding of death as the opposite of life (cf. Gay Science ? 109). It is in the end not by coincidence that he turns the predication around, so that life has to be understood through death. As a result, it is the negation of the opposition between life and death that opens the possibility of a re naturalisation of the human being. We are now in a position to reproach Freud for his explicit re-instantiation of the antagonism of life and death in what Laplanche and Pontalis call his great schema of dualisms (1967, entry: pulsions de vie). His philosophy is anti-idealistic in precisely the sense that its essence is idealistic despite the</page><page sequence="11">Nietzsche and Freud 43 fact that its doxa is directed against idealism.7 The fundamental difference between Nietzsche and Freud can be addressed by the impossibility for Freud ian psychoanalysis to exist without the exclusive disjunction of nature and spirit. To avoid "calling death the opposite of life"?that is, to oppose (1) the opposition of life and nature, which issues into (2) the interpretation of na ture as the opposite to human life (cf. Nietzsche, Jenseits von Gut und B?se ? 3, p. 18)?we must contest the position of man as the measure of all things as it has been brought to its fulfilment in transcendental philosophy, and hence to put into question that locus of thought "according to which we still think." This locus of thought has determined nature as the negation of the human being. The first step in the overcoming of transcendental philosophy is hence simply expressed and much more difficult to fulfil. Nietzsche says, in a note from 1881, "In former times people and the philosophers have poeticised man into nature?let us de-humanise nature" (Nietzsche, Nachla? V 11 [238], p.532). If we understand transcendental philosophy in the most general sense as a philosophy that, in the constitution of its object, places its own possibility at stake, then Nietzsche's philosophy certainly is transcendental, not only through the understanding of the historicality of its object, but by positing its own historial status. But that is to say that we have to understand tran scendental philosophy in its turn as a historical figure of thought, so that while being the source of the understanding of the finitude of philosophical inquiry, what is to be overcome together with transcendental philosophy is its idea of the finitude of human being as grounded on the exclusivity of its own domain. In other words, while the propensity of transcendental philoso phy clearly is idealistic in its greatest moments of the nineteenth century, in Schelling and in Nietzsche, it has been understood as a necessary but insuf ficient moment. In Schelling's terms, while the concept of freedom would be impossible without German Idealism, its concr?tisation demands the latter's end. Accordingly, the demand to avoid "calling death the opposite of life" necessitates us to face that paradox given in the notion of Beschreibung (description) as it lies at the heart of phenomenology. While it is intended to dispense with philosophical construction generally, in favour of a return to the things themselves, it is quite clear that from this deconstruction of phi losophy follows that the description is neither active nor passive in the nar row sense, or, that its method cannot be objective. If the abolition of tran scendental philosophy is to issue into a collapse of the opposition of form and matter, of ego cogito and res extensa, of human freedom and the mecha</page><page sequence="12">44 Ullrich Michael Haase nistic essence of nature, then the question of human agency will have to be posed in a new light. To make this point clearer, let us take a look at a recent essay by Daniel Conway, "Returning to Nature: Nietzsche's G?tterd?mmerung" (1995). Here, as in many essays on Nietzsche's conception of nature, we can find the presupposition that either life is a dream, in which case the philosopher herself becomes a legislative and consequently supernatural power, thus fal sifying nature, or that one follows nature precisely insofar as one excepts that the truth is merely given by it, without any part played by the human being itself. The presupposition remains, first, that it is already known what nature is, insofar as it is understood from the stance of the natural attitude and, second, that there hence is, indisputably, an opposition of the "nature nurture" kind. From here follows the argument against nature. Yet this pre conception concerns a misinterpretation of the understanding itself, without the correction of which there is not even a possibility to misunderstand Nietzsche's conception of nature. I quote a short passage from Human, All Too Human, in which Nietzsche makes quite clear why philosophy has to be deconstructed: When Kant says that "the understanding does not draw its laws from na ture, rather it prescribes them to it," then this is absolutely correct in re spect to the concept of nature, which we are forced to combine with it (nature = the world as representation, that is to say, as error); yet this con cept is but a sum of quite a lot of errors of the understanding. (Nietzsche, Menschliches, Allzumenschliches 1, ? 19, p. 41) We will return briefly to the limitations of Thomas Mann's criticism of Freud. While it is adequate to say that Freud's rejection of philosophy as a source of information about that "oceanic feeling" attests to the idealistic inkling of psychoanalysis, while it is as well clear how one can argue that Nietzsche's appeal to that "oceanic feeling"?towards the feeling that one might well disperse the most valuable ointments and wines in the sea, with out having to fear that they will be lost?is in essence not idealistic, Thomas Mann does rephrase the mystery of the unity of man and world in idealistic and Schopenhauerian terms, capturing the ideal of transcendental philoso phy: The mysterious thought that Schopenhauer ... develops is, in short, the following: as our own Will, without knowing of its transformation, ap pears as an unrelenting and objective fate in our dreams; in that here every thing derives from ourselves, in that everybody is his own unsuspecting director of the theatre of his dreams; exactly thus as it is in dreaming, it is in reality, in this grand dream, which a single being, the will itself, dreams with us all, namely that our destinies want to exist as the product of our</page><page sequence="13">Nietzsche and Freud 45 own interiority, i.e. of our will, so that what appears to happen to us, shows itself as something which we are withholding from ourselves. (1972,140) Breaking with Schopenhauer, Nietzsche has to break with this determina tion of philosophy as well, yet without losing the moment at which the real ity beyond the dream does indeed appear. But this is an ambiguous task, insofar as it seems that its area of decision is already determined by two responses, which only pretend to be diametrically opposed to each other: On the one hand, as in the concept of projection, here again we see a resentment at work, whose aim consists in uprooting the cause of the appearance of its spiritual weakness. As it preferred a hope which cannot be fulfilled in place of one which could be negated by its fulfilment, it prefers not to perceive a phenomenon in the face of which its helplessness could be exposed. Here we have what Aristotle calls &lt;?&gt;OOi?*-blindness, or what Husserl calls the eradication of intuition from the technicised modern sciences, and what Heidegger finally calls a "blindness toward Being." On the other hand stands the misappropriation of that phenomenon as idealism. It would not be diffi cult to show that both responses, while opposed in their essence, are very close as to their outcome. * * * In order to be able to enjoy a healthier dream, Nietzsche says that we phi losophers have to attend to our essential task, to being awake {Beyond Good and Evil, preface, p. 12). The philosopher, on the search for a hole in the borderline of transcendental philosophy, looks for reality neither in the dream itself, nor quite in the phantasm of an unrestricted presence of truth in wak ing life, but in the moment of awakening. This is, as we will see, the moment that Lacan calls our "appointment to which we are always called with a real that eludes us" (1979, 53). To avoid "calling death the opposite of life," and, consequently, to avoid the misconception of nature as the anti-thesis of the subject, means, first of all, to orient the experience of nature in terms of writing itself; and that is precisely what Lacan has done with respect to Freud's text. Lacan high lights this ambiguity in the text of psychoanalysis in the following lines of The Four Fundamental Concepts of Psychoanalysis: "At first sight, psycho analysis seems to lead in the direction of idealism", while, looked at more closely, "no praxis is more oriented towards that which, at the heart of expe rience, is the kernel of the real than psycho-analysis" (53). To put this into Nietzsche's words, to avoid "calling death the opposite of life," it is of paramount importance to counter the mechanistic clumsiness</page><page sequence="14">46 Ullrich Michael Haase of contemporary science, in order to reorient the science of nature towards philology and medicine. Following this way, one might find a solution to Husserl's Crisis of the European Sciences in a direction unsuspected by Husserl himself. The unity of the procedures mentioned above would then be deemed to bring the phenomenon of nature, that which we otherwise call the real into sight. And such an attempt at a philosophy of nature would destroy tran scendental philosophy precisely in that it properly dehumanises nature in stead of shifting the interpretation from a humanistic one to the idea of the inhuman, the machine, or whatever all these fantasies are called. That is to say that the philosophy of nature would supersede nihilism, not in that it naively tries to pick the fruits of metaphysics through an unreflected empiri cism, but in that it attempts to avoid the beginning of metaphysics as a turn ing away from nature towards "that which really is." and a a I will try to give a first indication of this possibility to speak again about nature without being embarrassed either for having to repeat the commonplaces of the natural attitude or for being reduced to sheer speech lessness. The places inside the texts of psychoanalysis propose themselves, namely, the famous essay Beyond the Pleasure Principle, which could as easily be translated as Beyond the Lifedrives or Beyond the Economy of the Self and Lacan's seminar and a a . In respect to the first, it is clear that Freud seems to bear Nietzsche's warning in mind. Indeed, the whole of Beyond the Pleasure Principle seems to be oriented towards an understanding of life as a form of death. It is an odd text, insofar as Freud, before and after, reinstates the dominance of the pleasure principle, even at those moments when he later refers back to this very text. If I said above that psychoanalysis does suffer an embarrassment as to the use of language in respect to nature, so this text professes to it, insofar as Freud repeatedly apologises for the insecurity of the ground on which he is moving. There are two important points to mention from this text in reference to the aim I am following here: First, it is as if against a certain reluctance that Freud acknowl edges the impossibility to confine psychical reality to the economy of the pleasure principle, which sees itself opposed by a new power. This taciturn power, introduced through the repetition compulsion,</page><page sequence="15">Nietzsche and Freud 47 is itself hidden. Furthermore, it is in this text that the true world of the eternal battle of the two heavenly powers appears to Freud. Second, the speculation of Beyond the Pleasure Principle has not come to an end with the discovery or even unmasking of the death drive. Rather, the conception of the death drive is not fulfilled by its opposition to the pleasure principle in the sense of an outside threat to the economy of pleasure exclusively characterising the psychic apparatus. Instead, insofar as the individual is concerned, Freud can only see death. The power opposing Thanatos is Eros, yet, while all the clamour of the everyday proceeds from Eros, there are dif ferent ways of dissimulation, and, indeed, Eros is not a glorified name for the pleasure principle, but its proper counterpart. What happens in this dynamic process of investigation is that the Plea sure Principle is stripped from all its significance. But while the problem now appears to be solved through the unmasking of the real encounter between Eros and Thanatos, the argument has led us astray in two ways: first of all, there is a fundamental dissymmetry between these two powers, which appears to ruin all hope that they could be under stood as counterparts; second, this Urstreit not only is hidden from the hu man eye, but cannot even be experienced, which makes its status highly problematic (cf. Ricoeur 1965, 289). To begin with, this problem reflects back onto the scientific status of Freud's psychoanalysis: the latter becomes a science precisely in that it constitutes its field of enquiry as a reality that cannot itself be experienced, although it is possible to record its laws. He * * I will end with a reconfirmation on the part of Nietzsche, not a reconfirma tion that would explicitly bind the philosophy of nature to any attempt to overcome nihilism, but one that makes clear that all of Nietzsche's endeavours are oriented towards that overcoming of transcendental philosophy. In a let ter to Erwin Rohde in Heidelberg, on a Monday afternoon in Chur, on 23 May 1887, Nietzsche writes about Burkhard, Taine, and himself: Wir sind in der That gr?ndlich aufeinander angewiesen, als drei gr?ndliche Nihilisten: obschon ich selbst, wie du vielleicht sp?rst, immer noch nicht daran verzweifle, den Ausweg und das Loch zu finden, durch das man in's "Etwas" kommt. We are indeed and essentially dependent on each other, we three nihilists: although, I myself, as you might have felt, have not yet despaired of find</page><page sequence="16">48 Ullrich Michael Haase ing the exit and the hole through which one might be able to get to "some thing." (Briefe vol. 8, p. 81) Department of Politics and Philosophy The Manchester Metropolitan University Notes 1. Although Freud seems to have believed in this possibility, as it is expressed in his remarks about bees, termites, and other insects who have already reached the ideal of an absolute state. 2. "Tats?chlich aber stellt sich?gleichsam hinter Hegels R?cken?heraus, da? mit dem ?bergang vom endlichen zum absoluten Geist die Subjektivit?t gesprengt ist; sein Versuch, den absoluten Geist in die reflexive Struktur des endlichen Bewu?tseins einzufangen, ist gescheitert" (Picht 1988, 17). 3. Cf. Also sprach Zarathustra. Cf. "The Convalecent" in Also sprach Zarathustra (KSA 10/479f.): "Zarathustras Consequenz ist da? der Mensch, um den Gedanken nicht zu f?hlen, zum Thier zur?ck sich bilden mu?. Oder zum ?bermenschen. " One will have to decide if this is an antecedent moment or a parody of Heidegger's 'Step back'. Compare KSA 5/24: "Etwas Mut um nicht zur?ck zu wollen." 4. "Auch die Transzendentalphilosophie mu? fallen" (Heidegger 1983, p. 522). 5. The reason for which I am dealing here with science should be equally obvious, considering that the sciences at stake call themselves natural sciences, or sciences of nature. Yet the whole debate between Nietzsche and Freud here comes down to the question for the essence of nature as well as the privileged access to it. 6. One need only to contrast Freud's notion of psychoanalysis with the Heideggerian analytic of Dasein to clarify that point. And one can then see the true impact of Sartre's critique of Freud, not so much based on his short critique of Freudian psychoanalysis, which quite rightly has been shown as being compatible with Freud's thinking, but in relation to his methodology, which posits the analytico-regressive method precisely as prolegomena to psy chology. 7. That it is possible to read Freud otherwise can be seen in the text of Jacques Lacan. Works Cited Aristotle. Physics. In vol. 1 of The Complete Works of Aristotle. Princeton: Princeton UP, 1984.
