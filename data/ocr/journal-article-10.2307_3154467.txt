<plain_text><page sequence="1">RECENT BOOKS ON THE SPIRIT 555 RECENT BOOKS ON THE SPIRIT Mr. Schoemaker's work' is a careful lexicographical study of the uses of 1_.'1 and 7rvei),ua in the canonical Scriptures, classical writings, Septu- agint, Apocrypha, Philo, and Josephus. He has arranged the Old Testa- ment sources in chronological order and takes up the use of 1i1'n under four periods: the oldest documents, the deuteronomic, the exilic and early Persian, the late Persian and Greek. In the New Testament he has made a topical classification and treats the material in four divisions: the teach- ing of Jesus; the four evangelists; Acts, Catholic epistles, and the Apoca7 lypse; and the Pauline epistles. It would have been better had he treated the Johannine writings after Paul. His work will be useful to all who wish to have the material before them in convenient form for their own study of the field, although Mr. Schoemaker's work makes no addition to our knowledge of the subject. Dr. Johnson's book2 is an attempt to set forth certain doctrinal positions regarding the Spirit upon the basis of the New Testament material. It contains much that is spiritually suggestive and stimulating, but it is of little value to the scientific theologian because of his failure to use the his- torical method in his treatment of Scripture and his habit of reading sub- sequent speculation into the New Testament. At some points he shows himself sympathetic with modern thought, but at many others he is plainly in the bondage of an antiquated theological system. Professor Wood has given us a book3 for which we have long been waiting-a study of the biblical conceptions of the Spirit based upon historical criticism. His book is delightfully written. It is clear, concise, and conveniently arranged. It is divided into three parts: "The Spirit of God in Hebrew Thought," "The Spirit of God in New Testament Thought," and "Conclusion." It is preceded by an introduction by Professor Porter, of Yale, which adds to its value. Professor Wood's method is to collect and classify the uses of the word "Spirit" in a given period, as Mr. Schoemaker has done, and then to draw from them his conclusions as to the doctrine held by the writers. Under each period he discusses related questions which his conclusions naturally raise.

The two elements which the phenomena ascribed to the Spirit always possess are their unusual and extraordinary character, and their national significance. Individual religion had not yet sufficiently developed to let the private Israelite ascribe his own exalted emotions to the Spirit. But the prophets, whose work was always regarded as national, and certain great heroes were the men of the Spirit. The divine, as in all early religions, was seen in the startling, and the "Spirit" was the term used to account for certain surprising, superhuman phenomena in which God was felt to be acting through them for the advancement of his chosen people. Professor Wood takes up the question whether the charisma was thought of as an increase of already existing powers or as an altogether new gift-a question probably too modern to be answered from the data at hand. His answer, however, is that powers which were in themselves abnormal were regarded as caused by new endowments, while powers which were normal, but developed to an extraordinary degree, were ascribed to the Spirit, in so far as they exceeded the usual and normal condition. Again: Had the activites of the Spirit always a religious value ? Yes. Did the Hebrews make a clear distinction between God and the Spirit of God ? All the phenomena ascribed to the Spirit are also accredited directly to God, and "the distinction between the operation of God and of the Spirit of God was completely obscured." Still he has reminded us previously that the Spirit was not a simple equivalent for God. "Had the Hebrew no independent idea to convey by the phrase, he would not have used it." He finds the origin of the conception in the idea of "the breath of God" as an explanation for the peculiar psychical phenomena in prophecy. "At the same time this psychical conception, with its roots in anthropomor- phism, was strengthened by a religious conception, with its roots in poly- demonism." Jehovah was surrounded by subordinate divine beings, and as his personality became clearer, theirs grew more shadowy, until they disappeared and their functions were merged in this expression for God in action. In the post-exilic period he finds four modifications in the use of the term: there is an approach in one instance to a static conception where "Spirit" is used for the divine omniscience; God's action in creation and in the ordinary processes of nature is assigned to the Spirit; the charismatic</page><page sequence="3">RECENT BOOKS ON THE SPIRIT 557 emphasis no longer predominates, but the Spirit is thought of as the first cause and controlling power in the external world, and as the guide -of Israel's past and the director of its future; and the Spirit is frequently spoken of as the basis of rational and physical life in man. But of far more importance than all these modifications is the use of the Spirit as the basis of personal ethical life. The instances of this use are few, but they are harbingers of the full development of the doctrine to be reached in Paul. Professor Wood points out a distinction between the method in which the Spirit is connected with nature and with man. It is thought of as operating "upon nature, but both in and upon man." "The tendency was toward the position that the Spirit is God immanent in man, as dis- tinguished from God transcendent over- the world, including man." The term was of great value in helping Hebrew thought to avoid pantheism, as it became more speculative. In the Palestinian-Jewish writings he finds a reversion in some respects to the conception held before the Exile. The "Spirit" is no longer used of God acting upon nature apart from man. The charismatic conception again becomes dominant, but now it is the ethical element in the charisma, rather than its merely spectacular aspect, which is emphasized. The "Spirit", however, is no longer a description for a living experience. It is not once spoken of as the possession of a contemporary. It is a memory of the past and a hope for the future messianic age. This is not due to the fact that vital religion was dead, as the Maccabean period is enough to refute, but to the theological tendency to put God far away and to avoid any phrase which had an anthropomorphic relation. In the Alexandrian-Jewish writings the rarity of the expression "Spirit," which one might have expected to be a fruitful term with Philo, is explained by the fact that "Wisdom" and "Word" were more useful because of their affinity with Greek philosophy, and "Spirit" had already acquired so definite a content and was so fixed in Hebrew usage that it did not as readily lend itself to Philo's system. When the word "Spirit" is used, it is essentially identical with the "Logos." There are no contributions from this literature to the biblical development of the idea, but Philo's thought profoundly influenced early ecclesiastical ideas of inspiration. The two main factors in the formation of the New Testament doctrine were the Hebrew tradition and the new religious experience of the followers of Jesus of Nazareth. The peculiarly Christian contribution to the ter- minology is the expression "the Spirit of Christ." The use or omission of the adjective "holy" is merely incidental and does not alter the meaning. In the teaching of Jesus in the Synoptists we find the Spirit rarely</page><page sequence="4">558 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY mentioned. He taught a complete harmony of life with God. He wished his disciples to be in direct communication with God himself, their Father. "Even so thin a veil as the idea of the Holy Spirit might tend to obscure the relation." When he does employ the word, it is in a Palestinian- Jewish sense. The Spirit is a manifestation of God's special activity in guiding and energizing the work of the Messiah. It is also promised as the source of special divine powers in the members of the messianic kingdom when the Christ is no longer at hand. It is not a new life, but the source of special gifts superadded to the ordinary life of the Christian. In their description of the life of the Messiah it is surprising that the syn- optists refer so infrequently to his endowment with the Spirit. Professor Wood suggests two explanations of this fact: Jesus' own meager use of the term, and "the feeling that he stood so close to God that there was no need for the intervention of the Spirit." In the conception in vogue in the primitive church before Paul there was practically nothing that was new. What was new was the wealth of emotional experiences which brought the old term so often to men's thoughts. "The Spirit now means not something different from what it did formerly, but means, in the large, the same things, not now as matters of memory or of hope, but of a vital, vivid experience in actual life." In all the phenomena ascribed to the Spirit there is an emotional intensity which seemed to a religious mind to demand the explanation of a divine origin. The discrepancy between the account of the glossolalia given in the story of Pentecost and that found in the epistles is due probably to an interpolation by the editor of Acts into an earlier narrative. He sums up the idea of the Spirit held by the primitive church in the following sentence: The Spirit was used as the name for the divine cause which the early church assumed to lie beneath those experiences, whose strong emotional element seemed to mark their extra-human origin, and whose providential end was the advance- ment of the messianic kingdom. The Spirit is never employed to express God's relation to nature, nor in the pre-Pauline period is it thought of as an essential part of the ordinary Christian life, but as a donum superadditum. As for the relation of the Spirit to God, Professor Wood says: They drew no fine-spun distinctions between God acting and the activity of God . . . . The Spirit was both. They unified or separated the Spirit and God in a way that is very puzzling to a logical theologian, but very reasonable when we take our stand in experience rather than in dogma. Paul's great contribution is his assignment to the Spirit of "the internal</page><page sequence="5">RECENT BOOKS ON THE SPIRIT 559 development of the kingdom in the individual life." The early church had seen the Spirit only in the unusual, and had tested its presence not so much by the ethical quality as by the extraordinary character of its effects. Paul accredited to the Spirit all experiences, however common, that served to further the messianic kingdom. With keen religious insight he saw that what was of highest value was not external gifts, but the life within, which issued in ethical conduct. Love was for him the fruit of the Spirit par excellence. His teaching is a development from the earlier view. He did not give up the charismatic idea, but held it along with this more comprehensive conception. The advance he made probably did not seem as radical to him as it does to us. With regard to the relation of the Spirit to God, "Paul makes a difference, not ab intra, but ex officio." They are not, however, mutually exclusive in their work. The inclusive term was "God." The Spirit might be used for a special way of divine energizing or it might not. That was immaterial. The essential thing was the realization that the Spirit's working was the actual moving of God upon the heart. God, not the Spirit, was the ultimate thought. It is not so easy to describe the relation of the Spirit to Christ. Christ is the objective exhibition of the love and purpose of God. The Spirit is the sum of all divine influences acting upon man to make effective this revelation in the life of man. .... The Spirit is wider than the influence of the personal Jesus Christ . . . . It is not simply the risen Christ, but it includes the sum- total of influences which come from him and from the historic purpose of God which prepared for him. Paul does not raise the metaphysical problem of the Trinity. He ascribes similar experiences now to God, now to the indwelling Christ, now to the Spirit. He does not seem to have faced the question of the ultimate relation of these three to one another. The Johannine writings show this difference from the conception held in the primitive period that the gift of the Spirit is not special and temporary, but normal to every Christian and permanent. This is an advance on Paul, not in the addition of a new conception, but in the disappearance of the charismatic idea altogether. The great question is how much of this teaching we can ascribe to Jesus himself. Professor Wood does not think that we can confidently deny it to him, but regards the probabilities as against his responsibility for this view. This, however, is not to discard all the references to the Spirit in the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth chapters of the fourth gospel. Very likely the original form referred to a temporary gift for special ends. "A penumbra of early Christian thought</page><page sequence="6">560 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OL THEOLOGY and interpretation" has gathered around it. There is no trace of Alex- andrian influence in the Johannine conception. There is a Pauline factor to be accounted for, and a mystic strain due to the author's own tem- perament. Professor Wood closes his book with an excellent summary. With the theological doctrine he, of course, as a biblical theologian, has nothing to do. One might be inclined to differ with Professor Wood at several points, but such differences are minor. Our main criticism of his work is that, while starting from the data of religious experience, he confines himself to those which are explicitly referred to the Spirit of God. One should examine all the phenomena and ask the question why some are ascribed to the Spirit and others to the Angel of Jehovah or Satan; why certain emotions are spiritual and others demonic. Identical data of religious experience are at one period of Israel's history assigned to the Spirit, at another to some other agency. Why the difference of explanation ? The problem emerges plainly in the discussion whether Christ's exorcisms were due to Beelzebub or the messianic Spirit. Similar phenomena were capable of various interpretations. The starting-point should be to gather all the phenomena, whether ascribed to the Spirit, or angels, or demons, or any other divine or Satanic agent. It is at this point that Professor Wood's book is inferior to those of Gunkel and Weinel. We cannot, however, be too grateful to him for giving us what is plainly the best book in English on this important subject. HENRY SLOANE COFFIN. UNION THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY. The second part of Dr. Lechler's4 work on the Holy Spirit deals with the biblical teachings. In the first part he had dealt almost exclusively with the exegesis of the scriptural material. In this second part, on the other hand, he is concerned only with the philosophic and dogmatic task of integrating this material into a theological system. The method which he pursues in this part is to set forth, in an abbrevi- ated form, an outline of dogmatic theology into which is fitted, at the proper places, the doctrine of the Spirit previously obtained from the exegetical study. One recognizes from the outset that both in his exegesis and in his constructive work the author is dominated by a strong ecclesiastical bias. 4 Die biblische Lehre vom heiligen Geiste. II. Teil: " Philosophisch-dogmatische Begriindung." Von Karl von Lechler. Giitersloh: Bertelsmann, 1902. xvi + 390 pages. III Teil: "Praktische Verwertung." Giitersloh: Bertelsman, 1904. viii + 290 pages.</page><page sequence="7">RECENT BOOKS ON THE SPIRIT 561 He avowedly ignores almost all of the accredited results of modern his- torical criticism as they relate to the Bible, and usually insists on a literal interpretation of a passage, if that is at all admissible. He treats the first chapter of Genesis as though that were necessarily the first portion of the book to have been written, and, what is more significant still, as a revelation of God which is not to be set aside or modified by any future revelations. A revelation of God in the Bible, since it is infallible, may be clarified by future revelations, but never annulled by them. It will thus be seen that from a strictly scientific point of view the results of the volume are of little value to the student of the Holy Spirit. In the historical question of the Hebrew conception of the Spirit of God the author has little interest. His theory of Scripture in fact excludes all ideas of religious development in Israel. Though he would probably not admit it, he is in reality seeking a tenable theory of the nature and function of the Spirit which will satisfy the present needs of the thought of his particular church. Such a theory he presents and, as far as possible, justifies with proof-texts from the Scriptures. Though, as a usual thing, he seeks to bring everything before the bar of reason, he yet in difficult places some- times voluntarily seeks refuge in mystery. In fact, he says it is God's nature to live in the dark, and man's wisdom is often foolishness with God. The author also takes special delight in a paradox, and maintains that all leading and fundamental truths appear in that form. One of the most striking (though not one of the most convincing) of these is when he claims that the image of God in man is primarily that of body, not of spirit. Then, too, he often fails to make any real distinction between two quite indepen- dent meanings of the Hebrew term )l.l.' Thus, for example, he identifies the breath of God, breathed into man at his creation, with the Spirit of God, the ground of prophetic inspiration. As to the functions of the Spirit the author sets forth little that is new or startling. But as to the nature of the Spirit his statements are often ultra- orthodox. For example, he starts out with the assertion that all the attri- butes of God must be attributes of the Spirit as well; that the Spirit of God is present in all creation as well as outside of it. It is in all spirit as well as in all matter. The existence of all things is conditioned by it. He admits that there are no direct Scripture passages to prove these statements, but says they are confirmed by the total conceptions and implications of the multitude of expressions concerning the Spirit found in both Old and New Testaments. Furthermore, God and the Spirit, he says, have an essential unity. For God is life, and life is unitary. But life is also manifold. Hence between God and the Spirit there is also an essential duality. In</page><page sequence="8">562 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY this duality the Spirit has no self-existence such as God has, though it possesses self-activity. The Spirit of God is from God just as the Son of God also is. He is another from God, or, better said, God in his "other- ness." From these extracts it is readily seen that the volume has little that the critical student can use to further his investigation of the subject. The book, however, will find its way into the hands of a class of people who are averse to all critical problems, and in such hands it will without doubt aid in stimulating thought and clarifying certain ideas. The method of presentation is logical, and the spirit in which the work is done, earnest and devout. The third part of Lechler's work, issued after his death, is concerned only with the practical application of the doctrine of the Spirit to church life and work. Its usefulness is thus, to a great extent, limited to workers in the field of applied Christianity. The volume contains little that the author has not in some form stated in his previous volumes on the subject, but the material is given a different turn or application. The author tries to show the intimate relation which exists between the Holy Spirit and the church. The latter possesses in itself neither self-existence nor self-activity. The Spirit is the constant and active force in the church. It uses as instru- ments both persons and things for the advancement of the kingdom of God. In this book the author shows a strong tendency (not wholly absent from the volumes which have preceded it) to over-elaborateness. The German passion for orderliness and completeness has often led him to repeat what he has said in some other connection, a reference to which would serve his purpose as well. In conclusion, we may say of the three volumes, taken together, that they form one of the most elaborate treatments of the biblical doctrine of the Holy Spirit found in recent literature. VWILLIAM R.
