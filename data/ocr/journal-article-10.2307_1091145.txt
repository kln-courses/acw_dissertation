<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MODERN LAW REVIEW FRUSTRATION-DECLINE OF THE IMPLIED TERM THEORY THE House of Lords, in Davis Contractors, Ltd. v. Fareham U. D. C.1 reconsidered the theoretical basis of the doctrine of frustration. In 1946, building contractors agreed with a local authority to build seventy-eight houses in eight months for a certain price. The contract contained escalator clauses with regard to prices of certain materials and rates of wages, and a liquidated damages clause to deal with delay in completion of the work, subject to the surveyor being required in certain events to allow such addi- tional time as he might deem fair and reasonable. Both parties, on the evidence, contemplated the possibility of some delay due to labour shortage, but no provision was made by contract to deal with this contingency or expressly to impose on the local authority any additional cost arising from a delay so caused. As it turned out, owing to an unexpected lag in the demobilisa- tion of building labour after the war, adequate supplies especially of skilled men were not immediately available to the contractors, so that the total duration of the job was in fact twenty-two and not eight months. Consequently, the contractors incurred an additional cost of around ?20,000, which they sought by legal action to recover from their client. The main basis of their claim was that the unexpectedly long delay, due to neither party's fault, frustrated the contract in law, and that the ultimate com- pletion of the work took place under the terms of an implied contract containing an implied promise by the local authority to make the building contractors reasonable recompense for the additional expenditure involved. The builders' claim was unsuccessful. The House of Lords held that the contract had not been frustrated in law, and in coming to this conclusion the juridical basis of the doctrine of frustration was submitted to a most important re-examination. Of the three law Lords who considered this theoretical question, two (Lords Reid and Radcliffe) expressly rejected the implied term theory, while Viscount Simonds expressed his indifference whether or not that theory was to be preferred to the theory of positive judicial intervention. In the light of these judgments, it is plain that the tide is now set in favour of explaining the discharge by the courts of contractual obligations under the doctrine of frustration as the exercise of an essential " qualifying power-a power to qualify the absolute, literal or wide terms of the contract-in order to do what is just and reasonable in the new situation," 2 and not in the terms of 1 [1956] 3 W.L.R. 37. 2 [1951] 1 K.B. 190, 200 (per Denning L.J. in the Movietonews case in the C.A.). 696 VOL. 19</page><page sequence="2">NOTES OF CASES the implied term explanation of merely carrying out the implicit will of (both) the parties. But, this conceded, there remains still the vital technical problem of defining the circumstances in which the courts will exercise their power of exonerating a party from obligations solemnly undertaken. In this respect the sharp rebuttal by Viscount Simon in the British Movietonews case 3 of Denning L.J.'s views in the Court of Appeal may now be seen not as any desire to obscure the realities of the judicial process but as deriving from an apprehension-quite misconceived in my respectful opinion-lest the realistic version of the doctrine of frustration might undermine the cardinal policy of sanctity of contracts, by suggesting to parties that the plea of frustration had become a "soft option" among available defences. Nothing could be further from the truth-as their Lordships made clear in Davis's case. As an exercise of the " qualifying power," "the doctrine has been, and must be, kept within very narrow limits." 4 " Frustra- tion is not to be lightly invoked as the dissolvent of a contract." 5 It is "a rule which the courts will apply in certain limited circumstances." Subject, however, to this necessary note of caution, what are the legal criteria that determine the doctrine's positive operation? Lord Radcliffe rejected the implied term theory and explained the circumstances in which the doctrine of frustration operates to terminate a contract in words that already have a classical ring and though lengthy merit quotation in full: "Lord Loreburn ascribes the dissolution to an implied term of the contract that was actually made. This approach is in line with the tendency of English courts to refer all the consequences of a contract to the will of those who made it. But there is something of a logical difficulty in seeing how the parties could even impliedly have provided for something which ex hypothesi they neither expected nor foresaw; and the ascription of frustration to an implied term of the contract has been criticised as obscuring the true action of the court which consists in applying an objective rule of the law of contract to the contractual obligations that the parties have imposed upon themselves. So long as each theory produces the same result as the other, as normally it does, it matters little which theory is avowed.7 But it may still be of some importance to recall that, if the matter is to be approached by way of implied term, the solution of any particular case is not to be found by inquiring what the parties themselves would have agreed on had they been, as they 3 [1952] A.C. 166, 181 et seq. 4 Viscount Simonds, 49. 5 Lord Radcliffe, 61. 6 Ibid. 7 See British Movietonews, Ltd. v.

It is not merely that no one can answer that hypothetical question: it is also that the decision must be given 'irrespective of the individuals concerned, their temperaments and failings, their interest and circumstances.' 8 The legal effect of frustration 'does not depend on their intention or their opinions, or even knowledge, as to the event.'9 On the contrary, it seems that when the event occurs 'the meaning of the contract must be taken to be, not what the parties did intend (for they had neither thought nor intention regarding it), but that which the parties, as fair and reasonable men, would presumably have agreed upon if, having such possibility in view, they had made express provision as to their several rights and liabilities in the event of its occurrence.' 10 "By this time it might seem that the parties themselves have become so far disembodied spirits that their actual persons should be allowed to rest in peace. In their place there rises the figure of the fair and reasonable man. And the spokesman of the fair and reasonable man, who represents after all no more than the anthropomorphic conception of justice, is and must be the court itself. So perhaps it would be simpler to say at the outset that frustration occurs when- ever the law recognises that without default of either party a contractual obligation has become incapable of being per- formed because the circumstances in which performance is called for would render it a thing radically different from that which was undertaken by the contract. Non haoc in foedera veni. It was not this that I promised to do. " There is, however, no uncertainty as to the materials upon which the court must proceed. 'The data for decision are, on the one hand, the terms and construction of the contract, read in the light of the then existing circumstances, and on the other hand the events which have occurred.' " In the nature of things there is often no room for any elaborate inquiry. The court must act upon a general impression of what its rule requires. It is for that reason that special importance is necessarily attached to the occurrence of any unexpected event that, as it were, changes the face of things. But, even so, it is not hardship or inconvenience or material loss itself which calls the principle of frustration into play. There must be as well such a change in the significance of the obligation that the thing undertaken would, if performed, be a different thing from that contracted for." 12 In sum, then, whether an appeal to the doctrine of frustration is successful depends on the proper construction of the contract, by which is meant, deciding whether the new situation that s Hirji Mulji v.

Generally speaking, in business trans- actions, this abstract test will come down to the concrete issue of whether, in the light of the contractual terms and particular type of transaction in question, the defendant might reasonably be said to have undertaken the business risk of pecuniary loss resulting from the turn that events took. In Davis's case, the House of Lords decided that the builders had assumed the business risk of bearing the additional cost due to delay, even serious delay, in completion."s If building contractors wish to mitigate such risks, "their safety lies in the insertion of explicit conditions in any fixed price contracts they may undertake." 14 But conditions of this kind may of course render the contractor's offer insufficiently attractive to the prospective client. It depends on the state of the market; and the decision to take such risk or not is strictly a business decision. If, to obtain business, express contractual coverage is omitted, it would be wrong for the businessman to be able to rely on the courts to shelter him afterwards from the accepted business hazard. On the other hand, the position is different if events impose a loss which could not be said to follow from the normal business hazards of the type of transaction in question, such as where a "fundamentally different situation " ls arose from that contemplated by the contract. What is a "fundamentally different situation" is a matter of delicate judicial appraisal in each case of alleged frustration.s6 For building contractors, the meaning of the conception probably begins with the situation in Metropolitan Water Board v. Dick, Kerr 8 Co., Ltd.17 C. GRBUNFED. FUNDAMENTAL BREACH OF CONTRACT THE facts in Karsales (Harrow) Ltd. v. Wallis' are classic, and it is a pity that the judgments do not quite reach the potential heights that were attainable. But it is a useful case nevertheless, and likely to be fruitful in stimulating others to seek justice under its branches. If it cannot claim to be a new sapling, it gives great viability to one that had made little headway. A man named Stinton offered a Buick car, KKC 822, to Wallis, the defendant. Wallis inspected the car and found it excellent. 13 See especially at 56, 64 and 67. 14 At 66. 15 British Movietonews, supra, 185 (per Viscount Simon). 16 Used in its narrower sense.
