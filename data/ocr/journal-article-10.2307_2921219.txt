<plain_text><page sequence="1">WILLA CATHER'S NOVELS OF THE FRONTIER: A STUDY IN THEMATIC SYMBOLISM, EDWARD A. BLOOM AND LILLIAN D. BLOOM Brown University Rhode Island State College I T HERE IS LITTLE critical dispute today over Willa Cather's position as a first-rate American novelist. Despite this agree- ment, few other contemporary novelists have been so consistently damned by faint praise; nor have many other novelists been so consistently evaluated by means of a single fixed interpretation of the author's purpose. Because of at least two important factors, a novel may convey and absorb a variety of meanings: the most essential quotient is the author's skill in the manipulation of his creative framework; another is the reader's experience, for each brings to the work he is reading his own power of intellect, intensity of feeling, and weight of experience. Miss Cather's specialized readers have been many, among them Clifton Fadiman, Lionel Trilling, Louis Kronenberger, Alfred Kazin, Maxwell Geismar, Percy H. Boynton, and E. K. Brown.2 With the exception of the last two critics, each of the others has for the most part tended to evaluate her work primarily by the standards-complex though they may be-of a social historian. Consequently, Miss Cather 1 Each of the novels examined in this study is in whole or in part directly related to Miss Cather's idea of the frontier.

Such evaluations may or may not be justi- fied; but certainly they are limited. The critical weakness of Miss Cather's interpreters stems from their divorce of the content and form of the novels. The critic must be concerned not only with what is being said, but with the how and why of its saying. The divorce is a dangerous short cut, and its weakening effects have been written large over Willa Cather's reputation. Very few of Miss Cather's critics have attempted to see the over-all pattern of her novels, their profound basis of moral values which gives them uni- versality of theme, their classical unity and selectivity of details which enable the writer to co-ordinate structure and moral mean- ing. For Miss Cather, "the design is the story and the story is the design. The timeless frontiers of the American continent have given Miss Cather her most significant creative materials. In her novels which are concerned with the frontier, the clue to both "design" and "story" is the seeming simplicity which characterizes them. This is a deceptive simplicity since it emerges not from naivete but from her deliberate and conscious theory of art. According to Miss Cather, "The higher processes of art are all processes of simplifica- tion. The novelist must learn to write, and then he must unlearn it; just as the modern painter learns to draw, and then learns when utterly to disregard his accomplishment. . . ."4 In short, Willa Cather derives her simplicity from the effort to subordinate all de- tails and all subsidiary meanings to what she terms a "higher and truer effect."5 While she frequently-particularly in her descrip- tions-appears unnecessarily rhetorical, she presents a general im- pression of casual unaffectedness in her writing. Nevertheless, Willa Cather writes purposefully in all her novels of the frontier, directing her talents in each to the exposition of one lofty theme and always arriving, with varying success, at her ultimate moralistic goal. In the fulfilment of her aim, Miss Cather is singularly impressed by the 3"Miss Jewett," Not Under Forty, pp. 77-78. "The Novel Demeuble," Not 'Under Forty, pp. 48-49. I Ibid.</page><page sequence="3">Willa Cather's Novels of the Frontier 73 artistic principle enunciated by the elder Dumas, who said that "to make a drama, a man needed one passion, and four walls."6 By evidence of her own often-repeated statements, Willa Cather centers her frontier novels about a single "passion" or theme, char- acterized by "persistence, survival, recurrence in the author's mind." That this single theme should "have 'teased' the mind for years"7 is no psychological or intellectual aberration. Indeed, according to I. A. Richards, "when a writer has found a theme or image which fixes a point of relative stability in the drift of experience, it is not to be expected that he will avoid it. Such themes are a means of orientation."8 Thus, Miss Cather found the "point of relative stability" in the universal theme of man's perpetual pilgrimage and struggle to find an ethical ideal, or in that of the barriers that cir- cumvent his attainment of that end. Part of the novelist's art, Miss Cather well realized, is to associate and to make clear a moral purpose with each tale that is related. She therefore presents characters and situations that do more than form the framework of a story; they represent large and broad issues that she has observed in her experiences and readings and that she believes to be true. Each of her novels to be considered in this discussion, then, becomes in whole or in part an allegory built upon the one dominating theme mentioned above. By allegory we do not mean an arbitrary, static diagram of point-to-point equations; rather we wish merely to make clear that the surface narrative in Miss Cather's novels is connected with a background meaning. Since allegories, with some remarkable exceptions like those of Franz Kafka, are essentially simple in treatment, Miss Cather's avowed aim of simplicity is decidedly to the point. Far from pre- senting depths of personality, her characters offer a flat surface; her situations, in so far as they are counterparts of specific occurrences, are for the most part devoid of psychological complexity. In this respect Willa Cather may be compared with two notable allegorical 'Ibid., p. 5I. Earlier, Miss Cather had cited this same dictum in The Song of the Lark, p. I40. 7 "Miss Jewett," Not Under Forty, p. 77. It is interesting to note that E. K. Brown (op. cit.) hints at a continuity of thematic characterization; that is, he suggests a few resemblances between the pioneers of the early Western novels and those of Death Comes for the Archbishop and Shadows on the Rock. 8 As cited by Robert Penn Warren in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner-A Poem of Pure Imagination: An Experiment in Reading (New York, I946), p. 87.</page><page sequence="4">74 American Literature writers, Hawthorne and Melville, who likewise presented few ani- mated characters. Their symbolic figures are vague when compared with the realistic people drawn by Fielding, Austen, Thackeray, or Dickens. Like Hawthorne and Melville, Miss Cather is interested primarily in the broad outline of human destiny, not in the motiva- tion of individual quirks and foibles. Her people and places are mainly convenient vehicles for ideas, presented in conventional novel form. The idea is the thing, and once the reader has grasped the intellectual motif, all the other elements fall into readily perceivable patterns. Examined in the aggregate, Miss Cather's novels of the frontier reveal an allegory of the individual's quest-his seeking and finding a direction of life.9 Born of the spirit, the quest is barren of all external and materialistic prompting. The pioneer's yearning is, indeed, so basic to the inner spirit that it becomes a creative power, rich in imagination and spiritual values. "Desire is creation," Miss Cather iterates, "is the magical element in that process."'0 Because the search for an ideal is synonymous with an innate groping for perfectibility, it has great moral value. And because, in Miss Cather's philosophy, the mere desire for the ideal is in itself an act of creation, the creative instinct has aesthetic significance. That is to say, there is an indivisible union of the moral and the aesthetic, for, as Miss Cather writes, "artistic growth is, more than it is anything else, a refining of the sense of truthfulness."" Hence Miss Cather's char- acters, visionaries and mystics, heed only that something within themselves which they divine instinctively to be their real lives and consciousness. They choose as a result to forsake the fixed conven- 'In an early critical work dealing necessarily with incomplete materials, Percy H. Boynton (op. cit.) concluded that Miss Cather's artistic theme is the portrayal of self- fulfilment. The focus is not on the individual as such, we believe, but upon the individual in his relationship to a higher order. 10 The Professor's House, p. 29. In The Song of the Lark, pp. 75-76, the idea is repeated: "Nothing is far and nothing is near, if one desires. . . . There is only one big thing-desire.'" Translated into the doctrine of Catholicism, desire becomes synonymous with the miracle. "The people have loved miracles for so many hundred years, not as proof or evidence, but because they are the actual flowering of desire. In them the vague worship and devotion of the simple-hearted assumes a form. From being a shapeless longing, it becomes a beautiful image; a dumb rapture becomes a melody that can be remembered and repeated; and the experience of a moment, which might have been a lost ecstasy, is made an actual possession and can be bequeathed to another" (Shadows on the Rock, p. 137). " The Song of the Lark, P. 477.</page><page sequence="5">Willa Cather's Novels of the Frontier 75 tions of civilized society. They wander forth, instead, orphan souls, searching for an ideal-a divine presence in the early novels, or a Christian God in the later novels. Whether this ineffable being is a divine presence, pagan or Christian, He is endowed with certain immutable qualities. He is not a form but a power, a palpable presence but never imprisoned in matter.'2 This spiritual odyssey drawn by Miss Cather is an eternal one, transcending both time and place. When she began her series of frontier novels, the West of America was her logical setting. She, like the Burdens of My Antonia, had left the fixed conventions of Virginia for a crude and rigorous Nebraska. Like the Burdens, she came to know the simple joys of a new land and the admirable qualities of an emigrant folk, Bohemians, Swedes, and the like. So at first she tapped her own limited experiences to present the pioneer spirit in a locale she came to know well. And always in the frontier novels, in the early as well as in the later ones, she underscores the yearning, the emotional grasping which give shape and substance to the spirit itself. When the road began to climb the first long swells of the Divide, Alexandra hummed an old Swedish hymn, and Emil wondered why his sister looked so happy. Her face was so radiant that he felt shy about asking her. For the first time, perhaps, since that land emerged from the waters of the geologic ages, a human face was set toward it with love and yearning. It seemed beautiful to her, rich and strong and glorious. Her eyes drank in the breadth of it, until her tears blinded her. Then the Genius of the Divide, the great, free spirit which breathes across it, must have bent lower than it ever bent to a human will before. The history of every country begins in the heart of a man or a woman.'3 But the prairie of the Middle West, Miss Cather came to realize, was only one frontier, and the pioneer immigrants were only a 12$ uch a concept is typical of Miss Cather's fusion of Roman Stoicism and basic Christianity. In the early novels she speaks of divinity in philosophical terminology; in the later novels she translates her ideas of divinity into purely Christian terms. But whether Stoic or Christian her conception of the godhead is always the same: ". . . in his essence a living all-wise Being; in his attributes immortal, immutable, active and benevolent; in his disposition occupied in contemplating and controlling his great work the universe, and in his relation to his creatures constantly concerned for their comfort and happiness." (Such is the Stoic definition of the first-moving principle as stated by E. Vernon Arnold, Roman Stoicism, Cambridge, 1911, p. 229.)

Her expanded interests, for example, revealed to her the possibilities of establishing the same spiritual motivation among the cliff dwellers and the fulfilment of their primitive culture. In their houses of hewn rock, Miss Cather said, "a dream had been dreamed ... long ago, in the night of ages, and the wind had whis- pered some promise to the sadness of the savage."'4 The rock of Acoma had never been taken by a foe but once,-by Spaniards in armour. It was very different from a mountain fastness; more lonely, more stark and grim, more appealing to the imagination. The rock, when one came to think of it, was the utmost expression of human need; even mere feeling yearned for it; it was the highest com- parison of loyalty in love and friendship. Christ Himself had used that comparison for the disciple to whom He gave the keys of His Church. And the Hebrews of the Old Testament, always being carried captive into foreign lands,-their rock was an idea of God, the only thing their conquerors could not take from them.'5 In Shadows on the Rock the spiritual seeking, again, was the chief stimulus for the pioneer French in seventeenth-century Canada. And on the strength of this seeking, they, like the cliff dwellers, found their rock and built a civilized island in the midst of barbarism. Why, the priest wondered, were these fellows always glad to get back to Kebec? Why did they come at all? Why should this particular cliff in the wilderness be echoing tonight with French songs, answering to the French tongue? He recalled certain naked islands in the Gulf of the St. Lawrence; mere ledges of rock standing up a little out of the sea, where the sea birds came every year to lay their eggs and rear their young in the caves and hollows; where they screamed and flocked to- gether and made a clamour, while the winds howled around them, and the spray beat over them. This headland was scarcely more than that; a crag where for some reason human beings built themselves nests in the rock, and held fast.16 And finally, it brought the Catholic missionaries of Death Comes for the Archbishop to the great Southwest. In this unbounded area of the Ur-Americas the reverend fathers finally approach their goal -primitive Christianity untainted by materialism. It is this kind 4 The Song of the Lark, p. 306. 1 Death Comes for the Archbishop, p. 98. 1 Shadows on the Rock, pp. 225-226.</page><page sequence="7">Willa Cather's Novels of the Frontier 77 of setting that can make altogether credible the parable of the Holy Mexican Family.'7 And from such a setting the French fathers drew the full force of their religion. Beautiful surroundings, the society of learned men, the charm of noble women, the graces of art, could not make up to him for the loss of those light-hearted mornings of the desert, for that wind that made one a boy again. He had noticed that this particular quality in the air of new countries vanished after they were tamed by man and made to bear harvests. Parts of Texas and Kansas that he had first known as open range had since been made into rich farming districts, and the air had quite lost that lightness, that dry aromatic odour. The moisture of plowed land, the heaviness of labour and growth and grain-bearing, utterly destroyed it; one could breathe that only on the bright edges of the world, on the great grass plains or the sage-brush desert. That air would disappear from the whole earth in time, perhaps; but long after his day. He did not know just when it had become so neces- sary to him, but he had come back to die in exile for the sake of it. Some- thing soft and wild and free, something that whispered to the ear on the pillow, lightened the heart, softly, softly picked the lock, slid the bolts, and released the prisoned spirit of man into the wind, into the blue and gold, into the morning, into the morning!'8 Thus, Miss Cather's conception of spiritual desire and yearning is for the most part associated with the frontier. But the frontier is not the scene of melodramatic adventure and outlawry; it is not an economic, sociological force. It is the locale of idealistic quests, spiritual struggles, and religious awareness. Her frontier is as much a philosophical concept as it is a physical actuality. Just as Miss Cather's idea of the frontier was one of subtle fusion of the real and the ideal, so her handling of the spiritual quest is a similar blend of the intangible and the material. The quest was always against the odds of monumental, physical struggle, being "7The entire atmosphere of Death Comes for the Archbishop is one of a primitive Christianity. It is an atmosphere which draws its "greatness" from its "simplicity." For Miss Cather "there is always something charming in the idea of greatness returning to simplicity-the queen making hay among the country girls-but how much more endearing was the belief that They, after so many centuries of history and glory, should return to play Their first parts, in the persons of a humble Mexican family, the lowliest of the lowly, the poorest of the poor,-in a wilderness at the end of the world, where the angels could scarcely find Them!" (Death Comes for the Archbishop, p. 284).

It is this aspect of the seeking that Willa Cather treats most capably. With artistic insight she saw and portrayed the paradox involved in the struggle itself. Her characters, whether immigrant pioneers or erudite Frenchmen, are long sheltered by fixed social traditions. Suddenly they find themselves engaged in conflict with a primeval force that is infinitely older than the traditions themselves. The irony implicit in the paradox is further enforced by the realism with which the struggle is described. Indeed, Miss Cather, who was so skeptical of the validity of physical concreteness,'9 limits her use of realistic details largely to the description of this struggle. Actually, the realism was implicit in the situation itself. Her pioneers were a people fighting to master a language, to conquer the soil, to hold their land, and to establish for themselves a set of working ethical doctrines. Abandoning their earlier unsatisfactory environment with its decadent mores, they bring only their yearning, their religion, and the best of their culture into the wilderness to prepare them- selves for a newly purposeful life. Inferretque deos Latio. When an adventurer carries his gods with him into a remote and savage country, the colony he founds will, from the beginning, have graces, traditions, riches of the mind and spirit.20 Obviously, there is no despair in Miss Cather's philosophy of an absolute idealism. Accordingly, the pioneer spirit was innately vic- torious because-and only because-it was an ideal, a dream of youth; and "to fulfill the dreams of one's youth," argued the mis- sionary priests in Death Comes for the Archbishop, "that is the best that can happen to man."121 Indeed, to Captain Forrester of A Lost Lady, the dream, the idea was at its very inception "an accomplished fact."22 Thus, for the pioneer the hardships which he endures and 19 See below, pp. 79-80. 20Shadows on the Rock, p. 98.

See also The Professor's House, p. 29: "A man can do anything if he wishes to enough, St. Peter believed. . . . If there were an instrument by which to measure desire, one could foretell achievement." In 0 Pioneers!, p. 48, Miss Cather says that "a pioneer should have imagination, should be able to enjoy the idea of things more than the things themselves." And in One of Ours, the idea appears in the following form: "Ideals were not archaic things, beautiful and impotent; they were the real sources of power among men." (p. 420).</page><page sequence="9">Willa Cather's Novels of the Frontier 79 the struggles which he undergoes are merely a test. For after long strife he seems to advance in his spiritual quest, arriving at a tri- umph that for him is ultimate proof that his way is the only right way. Human experience is a graph of rising and falling events, cor- responding to man's fortunes and misfortunes. And man, Miss Cather believed, is responsible for his periods of rise and of decline. Once he begins to lose sight of spiritual ideals and to give precedence to material gains, he negates his spiritual advance. The frontiers- man or pioneer-the term is of little consequence-represents for Willa Cather the creature of his own desires, for good or evil. In recording his adventures she constantly emphasizes his inner strength and weakness and the decay that results once he permits himself the luxury of material desire. The wish for good demands particular strength if the pioneer is to withstand the debilitating force of a materialistic society. Good intentions alone are in- sufficient; the man of true spirit must supplement purpose with active striving. This recognition leads Miss Cather to her philo- sophical interpretation of life as a kind of gigantic tug-of-war, with idealism tugging against materialism. The theme that de- velops throughout her novels is devastatingly plausible, for mate- rialism inevitably seems to exhibit the superior strength. But the essentially optimistic Willa Cather searches beyond contemporary society. Instead she examines man's trials in other eras. Always the conclusion is the same and implacable. Cyclically, even as mate- rial progress and evil flower from yearning and desire, good must ultimately come from the temporary condition of evil. Unlike many of the other novelists of her generation who set themselves up as dispassionate or satirical observers of mankind, Willa Cather records her theme with delicate, subjective adumbra- tions. In so doing she follows an anti-realistic tradition already established in the nineteenth century by Hawthorne and James, and by E. M. Forster in the twentieth. Turning away from a tendency current in her generation toward muscular realism, Miss Cather says: There is a popular superstition that "realism" asserts itself in the cata- loguing of a great number of material objects, in explaining mechanical</page><page sequence="10">80 American Literature processes, the methods of operating manufactories and trades, and in minutely and unsparingly describing physical sensations. But is not realism, more than it is anything else, an attitude of mind on the part of the writer toward his material, a vague indication of the sympathy and candour with which he accepts, rather than chooses, his theme?23 She objects, then, to the merciless uninterpretative reports on the condition of mankind-mere photographic observations. She strives, instead, to modify physical probability with moral necessity. Miss Cather arrives at an artistic theory that is much akin to Haw- thorne's when he proposed the distinction between Romance and Novel.24 But even closer is she to Henry James's opinion of the realistic and the romantic. . .. the real represents to my perception the things we cannot possibly not know, sooner or later, in one way or another. . . . The romantic stands, on the other hand, for the things that, with all the facilities in the world, all the wealth and all the courage and all the wit and all the adventure, we never can directly know; the things that can reach us only through the beautiful circuit and subterfuge of our thought and desire.25 And Willa Cather is undeniably motivated throughout her works by the twin ideas, beauty and desire. Although there is danger of conventional tags and diversity of terms, it is apparent that all three novelists-Hawthorne, James, and Cather-were defending roman- ticism and in particular that aspect of romanticism commonly called moral realism, "which is not the awareness of morality itself but of the contradictions, paradoxes and dangers of living the moral .on26 life."2 II For the enunciation of her theme Miss Cather turns inevitably to the use of symbols. The moral idea for her is always an empirical one. As a novelist she faces the necessity of making clear and cred- ible her underlying theme. This she discovers she can do most readily with symbols which illustrate and magnify her ideas in con- crete terms. To understand Willa Cather, therefore, is to under- 23 "The Novel Demeuble," Not Under Forty, p. 45. 24 Preface to The House of the Seven Gables. 22 As cited by F. 0.

Forster (Norfolk, Conn., I943), pp. II-I2.</page><page sequence="11">Willa Cather's Novels of the Frontier 8i stand her meaningful employment of a system of symbols, all of which are segments of the whole theme. Each symbol is a part of but inseparable from the whole. For a better understanding of Miss Cather as a symbolist, we may refer to Coleridge on this particular aspect of symbolism. . . . a Symbol ... is characterized by a translucence of the Special in the Individual or of the General in the Especial or of the Universal in the General. Above all by the translucence of the Eternal through and in the Temporal. It always partakes of the Reality which it renders intelligible; and while it enunciates the whole, abides itself as a living part in that Unity; of which it is the representative.27 In Miss Cather's work, by this criterion, the symbol concretely represents the idea, giving it strength, magnitude, and reality. So tightly co-ordinated are her symbols with the ideas they project that no one may be divorced or altered without inestimable damage to the whole. This becomes particularly apparent from the sys- tematic, chronological examination of her writings. The idea is the reality, the reality is the idea. Although Willa Cather built up a careful scheme of symbols, she was in no sense a formal devotee of any of the "schools" that followed the European symbolistes of the late nineteenth century. Never does she indulge in the private, excessively subjective sym- bolism that began with Mallarme and Baudelaire and culminated with Yeats. Hers is not an imagination that can work with the obscure and the esoteric. She does not say with Verlaine, "Pas de couleur, rien que la nuance." To the contrary, the aesthetic is for her never an isolated measure of artistic skill, art for art's sake. The aesthetic she always associates with her moral purpose, and this she must exemplify through the use of crystalline, objective symbols. Her symbols are not like Yeats's, tests of private ingenuity and nebulosity. They are symbols of necessity;28 that is, they have their origins in the meaningful pattern of universal human experience. For her principal symbol Miss Cather takes the vast panorama of an untamed land. Now any symbol. be it the remotely subjective, aesthetic tool of Yeats or the relatively objective device of Miss Cather, may have a complexity of meanings. No symbol can sub- 27 The Statesman's Manual (London, i8i6), p. 37. 28 For this term we are indebted to Robert Penn Warren, op. cit., p. 75.</page><page sequence="12">82 American Literature mit to arbitrary definition, although it must of course have a funda- mental meaning in the author's intention. The meaning must be interpreted, rather than defined, in the light of the experience brought to the work by each reader. Since, as we have already sug- gested, no two sets of experience are identical, there must be con- siderable diversity of exact interpretation. The writer, likewise, may frequently emboss levels and degrees of meaning on each symbol. This becomes the case with Miss Cather. Thus in her work we must recognize the complex function of her symbols. For example, the symbol of the land has several thematic levels, all essentially and inevitably integrated. Note, for instance, that she sees in the land a common and spiritual meeting ground for her idealistic pioneers. Then she links to this idea the importance of the land as a place of spiritual sanctuary. Yet she is impressed that the land, or nature, is an overwhelming force often capable of rigorous subjection even while it may offer protection. But, above all, she will never have us forget that the land is the manifestation of a divine, supersensible force. As a place of communion for idealistic pioneers, Miss Cather exalts the land. It is the consecrated, tangible evidence of a superior authority and is imbued with the might of that force. The irresist- ible sense of a God-inspiring unity is intuitive for Miss Cather's pioneers; such a recognition of the divine workings of creation is the root of her theosophic implications. For to obey authority man must in some way identify authority. The pioneer's chief aware- ness is based on the original unity of the earth. He sees the earth, the spirit of a stern but not necessarily orthodox deity, jealously protecting its harmony which he must associate with his own well- being. Jealously, as Miss Cather describes it, and at any cost, the dominance of the deity with its fierce and overwhelming strength must be retained. The little town behind them had vanished as if it had never been, had fallen behind the swell of the prairie, and the stern frozen country received them into its bosom. The homesteads were few and far apart; here and there a windmill gaunt against the sky, a sod house crouching in a hollow. But the great fact was the land itself, which seemed to over- whelm the little beginnings of human society that struggled in its sombre wastes. It was from facing this vast hardness that the boy's mouth had</page><page sequence="13">Willa Cather's Novels of the Frontier 83 become so bitter; because he felt that men were too weak to make any mark here, that the land wanted to be let alone, to preserve its own fierce strength, its peculiar, savage kind of beauty, its uninterrupted mournfulness.29 In all of the frontier novels is a pervasive religious spirit of the land that is Miss Cather's deliberate attempt to arrive at a tone parallel with that of the introspective searching of the Old Testa- ment. The entire frontier tradition with which she deals is molded in the cast of a stern element; simplicity and goodness are derived from harsh nature through an awareness of, and an acquiescence in, some divine supervision. Miss Cather's pioneers, like the ancient wandering tribes of Israel, have gone into the wilderness, at once searching for an ideal and seeking a sanctuary from a troubled existence. And there, in the wilderness, they often find their sanctu- ary. In an example already cited from Deacth Comes for the Arch- bishop, we see the summation of everything that Miss Cather means by sanctuary.30 For pagan and Christian, for skeptic and believer, there was always a refuge. The symbol was simple and elemental. In 0 Pioneers! and My A[ntonia it was the land itself. But frequently the symbol was narrowed and made more specific. In The Song of the Lark, The Professor's House, Death Comes for the Arch- bishop, and Shadows on the Rock, the concentrated symbol becomes a rock rising out of the land. The rock is at once accessible to the comfort of a primitive devotion, and a warning to materialistic desire. At the same time it is in a profoundly mysterious way the end of the quest. This is the lesson that makes itself clear through the Catholic eyes of a Bishop Latour or of the people of seventeenth- century Canada. And again it is the lesson to be sought by those people who seek a spiritual belief in an absolute unimpaired by creed. This is the revelation that comes to a Thea Kronborg and a Tom Outland. Man stands in an enigmatic relationship to nature, in Miss Cather's world of the frontiersman. His world, in juxtaposition to the universal scheme of creation, is microcosmic. The larger macrocosm, the essence of an omnipresent divinity, looms as a pro- 29 0 Pioneers!, p. I5. See also pp. I9 f. and II8 in the same work.

Shelter, not harm, will be the reward of those who have learned the lesson of a supernal order and are sincerely reverent in their acknowledgment. The reader of Miss Cather must be aware that nature, as she depicts it, is capable of objective beneficence but has no anthropomorphic properties to link it directly with man. Nature is at once a barrier and a refuge. But always nature is the ide'e fixe in the pioneer's life. The laws of nature are immutable. They are the eternal verities with which man must comply; they never bend to man's will. In an attempt to crystallize this relationship, Miss Cather uses a constantly recurring artistic device. She always portrays man on a reduced scale, and at the same time she projects the phenomena of nature in heroic pro- portions. Presently we saw a curious thing: There were no clouds, the sun was going down in a limpid, gold-washed sky. Just as the lower edge of the red disc rested on the high fields against the horizon, a great black figure suddenly appeared on the face of the sun.... On some upland farm, a plough had been left standing in the field. The sun was sinking just behind it. Magnified across the distance by the horizontal light, it stood out against the sun, was exactly contained within the circle of the disc; the handles, the tongue, the share-black against the molten red. There it was, heroic in size, a picture writing on the sun. Even while we whispered about it, our vision disappeared; the ball dropped and dropped until the red tip went beneath the earth. The fields below us were dark, the sky was growing pale, and that forgotten plow had sunk back to its own littleness somewhere on the prairie.3' Miss Cather depicts the pioneer in an ironic; uneven fight against the inflexible force of the land. This is a conflict that he may win only by spiritual submission, not by physical strength. By his act of submission the pioneer is in effect helping the fulfilment of his own destiny.32 The idea becomes paradoxical because the very land 81 My Afntonia, p. 279. 32 Miss Cather draws two portraits of individuals submerged and destroyed by the land. These are the portraits of Bergson in 0 Pioneers! and Shimerda in My Intonia. Both men were already old when they came to the prairie of the Middle West. They clung tenaciously to the habits, traditions, and motivations of their European environments. They were either unwilling or unable to modify their earlier belief or to adjust it to a locale which left no room for the softness and sentimental overtones of European culture. 'For example, "John Bergson had the Old-World belief that land, in itself, is desirable,</page><page sequence="15">Willa Cather's Novels of the Frontier 85 that harbors him is set forth as cruel and elemental. For her prin- ciple she cogitates a scheme of existence hypothesized long before by the Roman Stoics.33 They too promulgated the need for obeisance to a superior force. With the Stoics Willa Cather adopts the posi- tion that man cannot reject destiny.34 His success lies in submission to the demiurge that controls his fate, his failure in rebellion against that same spirit. Like the Stoics, Miss Cather finds submission a virtue, restlessness and indecision its opposite. Nature for all its apparent cruelty, consequently, is the force that will temper the pioneer and bring him to his peace-his ultimate goal-as a result of his acquiescence. Only by an ethical courage can he withstand the land. The warm, pleasant summers lull him into a false sense of security. But in winter the land is another matter. "It is like an iron country, and the spirit is oppressed by its rigor and melan- choly. One could easily believe that in that dead landscape the germs of life and fruitfulness were extinct forever."35 Man is but a But this land was an enigma. It was like a horse that no one knows how to break to harness, that runs wild and kicks things to pieces" (O Pioneers!, pp. 21-22). With such an attitude, John Bergson's desire for the land turns to hatred and rebellion. And so he dies, destroyed by the land which he once so desired. His daughter, however, by her own admission looks to the land only with "love and understanding." And she waits passively and submissively for the land to redeem her faith (ibid., pp. 307 ff.). " For the parallel, cf. E. Vernon Arnold, op. cit., pp. I99-200. "This idea is so implicit in Miss Cather's theme that it is difficult to find an overt statement. Alexandra in 0 Pioneers! and Antonia in My intonia are both called fatalists, both maintaining an impervious calm and both subordinating their own personalities to that of the land itself. Claude Wheeler in One of Ours indulges in a sentimental and quasi- philosophical fatalism and attributes all the events in his life to a destiny which he simul- taneously condemns and exalts. Monsieur Auclair in Shadows on the Rock, Miss Cather's closest approximation to the Roman Stoic, sees all of human life governed by a philosophical principle over which one has no control and which he identifies with "fate" or "destiny." The most clear-cut statement of fatalistic submission occurs in My Antonia. "I tried to go to sleep, but the jolting made me bite my tongue, and I soon began to ache all over. When the straw settled down I had a hard bed. Cautiously I slipped from under the buffalo hide, got up on my knees and peered over the side of the wagon. There seemed to be nothing to see; no fences, no creeks or trees, no hills or fields. If there was a road, I could not make it out in the faint starlight. There was nothing but land: not a country at all, but the material out of which countries are made. No, there was nothing but land. . . . I had the feeling that the world was left behind, that we had got over the edge of it, and were outside man's jurisdiction. . . . But this was the complete dome of heaven, all there was of it. . . . Between that earth and that sky I felt erased, blotted out. I did not say my prayers that night: here, I felt, what would be would be" (My Jntonia, pP. 7-8). At the same time that the over-all pattern of one's life is shaped by an uncontrollable destiny, one has the power to work within the limits of that destiny; one has the power to shape the single day, the single event. See Shadows on the Rock, p. I98.

The seasons are merely tests of determination.37 "And yet," she writes, "down under the frozen crusts, at the roots of the trees, the secret of life was still safe, warm as the blood in one's heart; and the spring would come again! Oh, it would come again."38 Again drawing inspiration from a source common to both Stoicism and biblical Christianity, Willa Cather sees conclusive and definite proof of a supernal will in the natural order and harmony everywhere about the pioneer. Whether in the orderly arrange- ment of forests, prairies, and mountains, or of the constellations overhead, the regularity that betokens the perfection of the works of a divine power is ever apparent. To Miss Cather, as to Cicero and Seneca and the Psalmist,39 the contemplation of the celestial bodies leads to the full perception of a divine spirit and the mag- nificence of its work. Alexandra drew her shawl closer about her and stood leaning against the frame of the mill, looking at the stars which glittered so keenly through the frosty autumn air. She always loved to watch them, to think of their vastness and distance, and of their ordered march. It fortified her to reflect upon the great operations of nature, and when she thought of the law that lay behind them, she felt a sense of personal security.40 36Ibid., p. I87. "3The hardships which the pioneer must sustain are not in themselves evil. Actually, they are tests imposed by a divine power upon man so that man himself can prove his worth. In setting forth this thesis, Miss Cather follows in part the Stoic conception of the origin of evil. According to Seneca, "'No man . . . seems to me more unhappy than one who has never met with adversity.' For such a man has never had an opportuni- ty to test himself. Though all things have flowed to him according to his prayer, though even before his prayer, nevertheless the gods have passed an adverse judgment upon him. He was deemed unworthy ever to gain the victory over Fortune. . ." ("On Providence," Moral Essays, ed. John W. Basore, Loeb Classical Library, I928, p.

The idea appears constantly in Seneca's essays and epistles. See particularly, Of Benefits, Epistle XC, and The Natural Questions, passim. At least two notable expressions of this idea are to be found in the Old Testa- ment: Psalm i9; Daniel 5. 40 0 Pioneers!, pp. 70-71. The idea is repeated in One of Ours, p. 229: ". . . Claude walked . . . under the frosty brilliance of the winter stars. As he looked up at them,</page><page sequence="17">Willa Cather's Novels of the Frontier 87 It is not enough for the successful pioneer merely to recognize this natural order as the law of a superior force. He must seek to reaffirm it in his own everyday life. Thus Alexandra in her farm, which is the test of her personality and the expression of her being, seeks to imitate the order of a form which she vaguely and un- consciously recognizes as divine. When you go out of the house into the flower garden, there you feel again the order and fine arrangement manifest all over the great farm; in the fencing and hedging, in the windbreaks and sheds, in the sym- metrical pasture ponds, planted with scrub willow to give shade to the cattle in fly-time. There is even a white row of bee-hives in the orchard, under the walnut trees. You feel that, properly, Alexandra's house is the big out-of-doors, and that it is in the soil that she expresses herself best.4' For the pioneer, success and failure alike, the land is every- where and inescapable. Ultimately all distinction vanishes between the pioneer spirit and the land. One merges into the other, and each is an extension of the other. By this measure, to cite an instance, Alexandra, the essence of the pioneer spirit, and the land, the sym- bol of the conclusive goal of the pioneer quest, coalesce their identi- ties. There were certain days in her life, outwardly uneventful, which Alexandra remembered as peculiarly happy; days when she was close to the flat, fallow world about her, and felt, as it were, in her own body the joyous germination in the soil.42 III The land is, indeed, Miss Cather's chief symbol through which she may interpret a spiritual striving in realistic detail. The land is he felt more than ever that they must have something to do with the fate of nations, and with the incomprehensible things that were happening in the world. In the ordered universe there must be some mind that read the riddle of this one unhappy planet, that knew what was forming in the dark eclipse of this hour." 410 Pioneers!, p. 84. For the translation of this idea into Catholic terms, see Miss Cather's description of the nuns in Quebec, their recognition of the "well-ordered universe about them" and their subsequent devotion to order in their own daily lives (Shadows on the Rock, pp. 97-98). 42 0 Pioneers!, pp. 203-204. The idea is repeated again in this same work (p. 309): "Fortunate country, that is one day to receive hearts like Alexandra's into its bosom, to give them out again in the yellow wheat, in the rustling corn, in the shining eyes of youth!" And in My Antonia the identification continues. "More than any other person we remembered, [Antonia] seemed to mean to us the country, the conditions, the whole adventure of our childhood" (My Antonia, p. x).</page><page sequence="18">88 American Literature tangible evidence of man's ability to thrust himself into an alien wilderness, to abandon his old modes of living and thinking, and to seek a course of moral good. The land with its paradoxical union of violent force and fruitful beneficence symbolizes the final and absolute peace which satisfies and concludes man's spiritual quest. As such, it is part of an experience that at some time has been common to all peoples. Yet as a symbol, it does not com- pletely satisfy Miss Cather; she gropes for new devices to express this same idea and finds that the pioneer spirit of the ancient past correspondingly leads to an answer. Hence she lessens her emphasis on the ideal nature of the land in novels other than 0 Pioneers! and My Antonia, and focuses on the image of the historical absolute (or ideal, since the two terms are synonymous in Miss Cather's ethic). Although Miss Cather chooses to minimize the symbol of the land or reduce it to relative obscurity in her later novels, she never allows it to vanish completely. Even if often only by sug- gestion, the magnetic attraction of the land draws her people in The Song of the Lark, One of Ours, A Lost Lady, Death Comes for the Archbishop, and Shadows on the Rock. Actually, we must rec- ognize that the land and the historical absolute are parallel for her in symbolic meaning; both become the manageable representation of the ideal of the primal quest. This is best exemplified in the ancient struggle of the cliff dwellers treated in The Song of the Lark, where Miss Cather first initiates the idea, and in The Pro- fessor's House and Death Comes for the Archbishop, where she further expands the idea. The symbol of the historical ideal is more complex than the symbol of the land. The historical ideal is an abstraction which Miss Cather employs to modify another abstraction-man's spiritual quest. Her use of an abstract symbol is a seeming contradiction in terms, but any misinterpretation is readily clarified by analysis of her second major symbol. The logical point of departure is the question: Precisely what is Miss Cather's symbol of the historical ideal? The symbol is the novelist's subjective interpretation of a primitive people whose culture survives only as meager archeological remains on the mesas of the Southwest. The symbol is effective because of its complexity. It is not merely a sign or "picture writing"; nor is it only an idea. Actually, the symbol is an indi-</page><page sequence="19">Willa Cather's Novels of the Frontier 89 visible combination of both and draws its strength from the special complex of emotional attitudes with which Miss, Cather handles it. A casual analysis would suggest an apparent paradox in the symbol itself because Miss Cather turns to an elemental society for the lesson that she would teach to her contemporaries. In all actuality this is no paradox. The cliff dwellers are primitive but not in degree of culture or civilization. Indeed, their culture is comparable, in her eyes, with the best in all cultures. Timeless in spirit, the cliff- dwellers are yet primitive only in point of time of historical exist- ence. The idea becomes clearer upon comparison with Miss Cather's earlier symbol of the land. In her use of this symbol she arrived at the ultimate conclusion that the ethically best man is he who lives closest to nature. She turns then to the cliff dwellers and finds that their ethical goodness stems, in accentuated significance, from spirit- ual proximity to nature. Miss Cather's perception of the historical ideal as a dual device for coupling man's perpetual quest and the eternal victory of good is most effective in The Song of the Lark, The Professor's House and Death Comes for the Archbishop; for in them she adapts the culture of the cliff dwellers to her theory of the ideal and finds it propitious. Like the tales of the pioneers in the novels of the West, the legends of the cliff dwellers typify man's struggle for an absolute. During their searching for this same absolute, the cliff dwellers were con- fronted by the grim necessity of fighting for existence, harried as they were by the rigors of nature and the persecutions of their Spanish or Indian inquisitors. Actually theirs too was the eternal struggle of idealism against materialism. I see them here, isolated, cut off from other tribes, working out their destiny, making their mesa more and more worthy to be a home for man, purifying life by religious ceremonies and observances, caring respectfully for their dead, protecting the children, doubtless entertaining some feelings of affection and sentiment for this stronghold where they were at once so safe and so comfortable, where they had practically overcome the worst hardships that primitive man had to fear. They were, per- haps, too far advanced for their time and environment. They were probably wiped out, utterly exterminated, by some roving Indian tribe without culture or domestic virtues, some horde that fell upon them in their summer camp and destroyed them for their hides and</page><page sequence="20">go American Literature clothing and weapons, or from mere love of slaughter. I feel sure that these brutal invaders never even learned of the existence of this mesa, honeycombed with habitations. If they had come here, they would have destroyed. They killed and went their way.43 For Miss Cather, then, the cliff dwellers symbolize the victory of good through the perpetuation of their cultural remains and the condemnation by history of their oppressors. The philosophical truths of the past as they offer a solution to existence in the present are understood by people with transcendent imaginations and deep-rooted spiritual values.44 As the land offers a way of ethical life to those with the genuine humility that stems from a sympathetic understanding of a superior force, so a knowl- edge of the historical ideal offers strength to those who can convert their knowledge to true understanding. Miss Cather, as a result of this consistent thesis, selects visionaries or people with acute inward perception to motivate her symbolism of the historical ideal and to give it immediate application. Thea Kronborg, Ray Kennedy, and Tom Outland are all spiritual introverts able to profit from the lesson of the past. Father Latour, likewise, is introspective and capable of deep understanding, though he already has the strength of a dogmatic, yet nonetheless intensely emotional and introverted, religious experience. He, in short, discovered the goal of his quest in Catholicism; but he can understand the inspiration of a com- parable if pagan philosophy. All these dreamers are admirable 43 The Professor's House, pp. 220-22I. 4The reaction of Thea Kronborg and Tom Outland to the remains of the cliff dwellers takes the form of a vague mystic experience. Thus Tom, speaking of the mesa, says: "This was the first time I ever saw it as a whole. It all came together in my under- standing, as a series of experiments do when you begin to see where they are leading. Something had happened in me that made it possible for me to co-ordinate and simplify, and that process, going on in my mind, brought with it great happiness. It was possession. The excitement of my first discovery was a very pale feeling compared to this one. For me the mesa was no longer an adventure, but a religious emotion. I had read of filial piety in the Latin poets, and I knew that was what I felt for this place. It had formerly been mixed up with other motives; but now that they were gone, I had my happiness unalloyed. . . I can scarcely hope that life will give me another summer like that one. It was my high tide. Every morning, when the sun's rays first hit the mesa top, while the rest of the world was in shadow, I wakened with the feeling that I had found everything, instead of having lost everything. Nothing tired me. Up there alone, a close neighbour to the sun, I seemed to get the solar energy in some direct way. And at night, when I watched it drop down behind the edge of the plain below me, I used to feel that I couldn't have borne another hour of that consuming light, that I was full to the brim, and needed dark and sleep" (Thle Professor's House, pp. 250-252). For a like statement of Thea's reaction, see The Song of the Lark, pp. 302-303.</page><page sequence="21">Willa Cather's Novels of the Frontier 9I tools for the development of Miss Cather's symbolism because they are responsive to the mystic associations of a buried past that would find a realist impervious. For those near-mystics who, unlike Father Latour, are still groping for philosophical values, the lesson of the cliff dwellers be- comes a rock as steadfast as the biblical conception of God. The visionary, in Miss Cather's sense, has not successfully come to grips with life. He needs a sanctuary that will give him respite from the present, even as the pioneers of the West require an inward haven. But Miss Cather's dreamers are not escapists in the aesthetic sense of the term. Each, for some reason, needs a justification for being, and symbolically, the recaptured culture of the cliff dwellers pro- vides that justification.45 Thea Kronborg is an artist who chafes against material restraints. For this struggle she needs the strength which she finds among the ghosts of a spiritual ideal, a triumphant ideal which has fought against materialistic standards even at the cost of its own existence. Once understanding that, she dedicates herself in action to the same ideal. O eagle of eagles! Endeavor, achievement, desire, glorious striving of human art! From a cleft in the heart of the world she saluted it.... It had come all the way; when men lived in caves, it was there. A vanished race; but along the trails, in the stream, under the spreading cactus, there still glittered in the sun the bits of their frail clay vessels, fragments of their desire.46 Similarly, Tom Outland, himself tortured by the conflict between the acceptance or renunciation of material values, adheres finally to the modus vivendi of the cliff dwellers, as he translates their stand- ards and course of action into his own. The relationship of Tom and Thea to the cliff dwellers and their mesa is not to be confused with pure artistic escape from the moil of an ugly society. Indeed, there is strength in this temporary retreat even as there is weakness in the romantic, indeterminate longings of Professor St. Peter's interest in the historical past for its own sake. The vestiges of the ancient cliff dwellers combine for Thea and Tom spiritual and physical certainty. From antiquity "5E. K. Brown (Op. cit., p. 56I) has made an inconclusive allusion to this same idea, limiting his interpretation to the regenerative function of the cliff remains. This is only partially true since the association not only "invigorates and enriches" but also provides a way of life. '" The Song of the Lark, P. 321.</page><page sequence="22">92 American Literature they extract the will to take their place in the present, not the long- ing to seal themselves hermetically in the void of the past. This active, essential, intelligent reaction to the idealism of the past must be remembered as the extreme pole to the Professor's inactive, illusory immersion in the verbal past of history books.47 Miss Cather is not reluctant to point out the lesson to be learned from an examination of the lives of the cliff dwellers. For them, she reasoned, existence was a primal struggle against barbarism and irreverence. They sought such spiritual goods as would bring them to their final goal of an untroubled peace. This was their ideal quest, and as Miss Cather frequently points out, one that moderns might well imitate. Like you, I feel a reverence for this place. Wherever humanity has made that hardest of all starts and lifted itself out of mere brutality, is a sacred spot. Your people were cut off here without the influence of example or emulation, with no incentive but some natural yearning for order and security. They built themselves into this mesa and humanized it.48 It is at this point that Miss Cather's homiletic leanings become most pronounced. So intent does she become at teaching her lesson, that she forgets the outward trappings of her story and presents instead bald statements which have no other purpose than the justification of her particular moral belief. 7 The symbol of the historical ideal should not be identified with a vague and romantic interest in the past for its own sake. Miss Cather's historical sense was largely directed toward the study of early struggles of idealism against materialism. There is, however, a single occasion in which she develops a theory of the historical past as an avenue of aesthetic escape for one who finds active reality unsatisfactory. For this purpose she develops the character of Godfrey St. Peter in The Professor's House. Addicted to what he called "the pomp and circumstance" of a vague historical past, St. Peter lives vicariously in the pages of his history books, for through them he becomes "a principal in a gorgeous drama with God, glittering angels on one side and the shadows of evil coming and going on the other." And according to St. Peter, "that's what makes men happy, believing in the mystery and importance of their own little individual lives" (pp. 67 ff.). This particular attitude towards the historical past which Miss Cather projects through St. Peter is untypical and results in a twisted, enervated character. The explanation is simple. Miss Cather, consciously or unconsciously, is out of sympathy with an inactive or dead devotion to history. For her the successful test of history is its association with contemporary experience. St. Peter's ostrich-like renunciation of life is Miss Cather's unsuccessful experiment with. history as pure escape. She does not repeat it. Her belief in history in action is verified by her success with the constantly recurring symbol of the cliff dwellers. 4 The Professor's House, p. 221. See also The Song of the Lark, p. 306.</page><page sequence="23">Willa Cather's Novels of the Frontier 93 IV While Miss Cather was symbolizing the positive qualities of the frontier spirit, she became increasingly conscious of the negative force of materialism upon that spirit. This awareness is fore- shadowed in all of the early novels until it culminates in her attack upon the exploitation of the West in A Lost Lady, her definitive ex- position of anti-progress.49 The West of A Lost Lady is a narrower embodiment of all Miss Cather's frontiers, whether those of Colo- rado and Nebraska, or of the great Southwest and Canada. Geo- graphic location and historic time are less important to her than the spiritual quests of the pioneers with whom she deals, and she con- demns exploitation in any frontier as an irritant to the moral pur- pose of the pioneers. Through her focus on the historical ideal Miss Cather discovers comparable corrosive forces at work through- out the entire record of mankind. And always her conclusion is that good must triumph over evil, and that the morality of the spirit must defeat opportunism. Because she is a philosopher of hope, she tells us that the degeneracy of a single frontier such as that of the West is not defeat. This particular degeneracy appears to her but an instance of man's immediate failure to adjust to a purer spirit. Miss Cather's inference is that if, ironically, some men have failed because of their civilized progress, which to her is synonymous with exploitation, others will always seek and find other frontiers. The West of A Lost Lady, then, is but the essence of an unrealized ideal. The conclusion to be drawn is inevitable upon recognition that the novelist's concept of the land-whether harsh and cruel or orderly and tranquil-is always that of the constructive expression of divine order. As she represents it, the historical ideal is the record of man's reconciliation with and subordination to the divine will. In effect, therefore, the ideals of both the past and nature are good. Destruc- tive exploitation and materialism, being contrary to the laws of nature and spiritual order, are therefore evil. That is the moral and aesthetic belief of Willa Cather. "Because Willa Cather's doctrine of the true frontier is essentially positive, and because space limitations obviate complete analysis, we have reduced her third major symbol-the negative one of anti-progress-to summary. Early intimations of her dis- pleasure with exploitation may be found in 0 Pioneers!, p. ii 8; and especially in My Antonia, pp. 249 f., 225-226; and One of Ours, pp. IOI-I02. Excellent examples of fulmination are everywhere in A Lost Lady, especially pp. 22-25, io6. The attack on ex- ploitation, however, does not end with A Lost Lady. There are anti-progress allusions and situations in Death Comes for the Archbishop, pp. 124-125, I42 f.; and in Shadows on the Rock, pp. I I9, 269 ff., 280.</page></plain_text>
