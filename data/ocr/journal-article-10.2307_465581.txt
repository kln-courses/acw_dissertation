<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOB J. FRYE Texas Christian University A Habit of Being: Some Uses of Personal Letters in Freshman Composition The immediate occasion for this essay was a letter describing Rhetoric Review, and when I completed the essay I sent it to the editor with a cover letter including some information she had requested in yet another letter. As writing teachers, as English teachers more often than not educated in belles-lettres, we are encompassed about with a multitude of letters. We likely have read and studied famous letters--those of the Pastons and of Pascal, Montesquieu's Persian Letters and Beethoven's Heiligenstadt Testament, the private correspondence of Byron and Keats and Carlyle, the thoughtful Letters to a Young Poet by Ranier Maria Rilke, the extraordinary letters of D. H. Lawrence, and the delightful personal letters of E. B. White. Those of us who study and teach eighteenth-century British literature may not have finished reading the correspondence of Horace Walpole--the fortieth volume appeared in 1980--but in this "century of the letter" we see epistolary art everywhere evident in the works of Swift, Defoe, Montagu, Richardson, and Goldsmith, for example, and we find the personal letters of Thomas Gray and Samuel Johnson illuminating.' Although we may not write fif- ty letters before breakfast as Frederic Harrison reportedly did, or com- pose annually 1,267 letters as Thomas Jefferson did when he was seventy-eight, as teachers we spend considerable time writing recommen- dation letters, reading form letters, yearning for acceptance letters, reading NCTE counciletters, and supporting "open letters" such as that one recently appearing in The Students' Right to Read.2 We may applaud the NCTE for deciding to publish jointly with the U. S. Postal Service the revised All About Letters (1982), we may believe that Roger Rosenblatt's essay "Don't Write Any Letters" in Time (June 22, 1981) is wrong in its advice though thoughtful in its examination of the peculiar nature of the personal letter, and we may read with uncommon joy Flan- nery O'Connor's recently published letters, The Habit of Being. In fact, Rhetoric Review, Vol. 1, No. 2, January 1983</page><page sequence="2">90 Rhetoric Review her letters in the midst of our world of letters, along with the encourage- ment of colleagues and students, may help us to appropriate this form of existence, this habit of being--the personal letter--to enable ourselves and those studying with us to seek and find our voices. In what follows I want to attempt a definition of the personal letter, point out the general neglect of the personal letter in recent rhetoric text- books, succinctly suggest why this neglect may be, remind you briefly of the significant role of letter writing in traditional rhetoric, and then pro- vide, more particularly, some illustrations of my use of the personal let- ter in teaching freshman English composition. Defining the personal or familiar letter may seem easier than it is. Perhaps I can try first to show what a familiar letter is not. Recently I received a communication from a Vice Chancellor for Finance and Plan- ning. It was dated, addressed to "All Faculty and University Staff," focused on the subject of "Computer Selection," began by informing, and ended by requesting: "I am writing on behalf of the Computer Selec- tion Task Force. The vendor presentations of last week portrayed accurately the range of mainframe possibilities still under considera- tion.... Please send your comments in writing to Mr. Forney by Thurs- day, October 7th. He will insure that your letter reaches the group prior to our final selection." Now .1 know the sender of this piece of writing to be a person. A brilliant Ph.D. from MIT and an experienced administrator, he has been known on the square dance floor to allemande left with the old left hand when he should have do sa doed, and I have sat with him in his office, drinking his coffee, and visited with him about the need to raise faculty salaries. He is real; he lives and moves and has being. Yet while his communication begins with "I" and while I know that Walker Gibson says that "there is always an 'I ,' whether he is expressed or not," this piece of writing is not a personal, familiar letter--and understandably so.) Task forces do not exude per- sonal warmth. It is, rather, a FYI-send-feedback-ASAP memorandum. Personal letters are not like that. And neither are they like the form let- ters with "personalized" addresses and salutations cranked out by the hundreds, as W. M. Hagen's "A 'Found' Form Letter" pointedly reveals.4 Accurately if somewhat formally, George Saintsbury defines a letter as "that kind of communication of thought or fact to another person which most immediately succeeds the oral, and supplies the claims of absence." Henri Peyre terms it "a written message intended for the perusal only of the person or organization to whom it is addressed." More explicitly, Herbert Davis points out that a letter says "things . . . in a certain way for a particular person at a particular moment. It is this which gives its</page><page sequence="3">A Habit of Being 91 unique character to the personal letter, and distinguishes it from other forms of familiar writing. A letter has an address and a date; it is written for a certain recipient, and may often be concerned with matters of a par- ticular time."5 Davis is focusing on the British writers of the Augustan Period, one of whom, Alexander Pope, emphasizes a quality peculiar, I think, to personal letters--their conversational nature. They should be, Pope suggests, "talking on paper" and be "a natural image of the mind of the writer." In her Introduction to the personal Letters of E. B. White, Dorothy Guth says that reading White's letters "is like hearing him talk to you.... They're good company."6 Personal letters may be self-expressive, referential, persuasive, or a combination of these kinds of writing as well as of many others; they may, in fact, transact business. But the sense of one person writing to another person is always evident. This personal quality is emphasized by the sender's customarily address- ing the recipient by name and closing by signing her or his name so as to guarantee and authenticate the correspondence. A clear sense of humanity informs and shapes the personal letter.7 It is worth noting that according to the NCTE Catalog 1982-1983, the newly revised All About Letters is specifically designed "for students in grades 6 through 12," not for college composition students. And in their excellent College English essay in 1979 reviewing the treatment of inven- tion in writing textbooks of the last decade, David Harrington and others note a variety of techniques suggested for a systematic approach to invention--topics, tagmemic invention, journal, free questioning, the Burke Pentad, categorical list, existential sentence, meditation, analogy, free-writing, and others--but not personal letters.8 In fact, recent college- level rhetorics and handbooks tend to ignore personal letters altogether, treat them briefly, or, most often, focus instead on the "business letter." An entry for "letters" or even "business letters" does not appear, for ex- ample, in the index of Maxine Hairston's A Contemporary Rhetoric although she does make effective use of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s "Let- ter from Birmingham Jail." Jim Corder devotes an entire chapter in his Contemporary Writing to "Letters" and makes some helpful distinc- tions between private and public letters, but most of his twenty pages focus on public letters. Corder does remark in his Handbook of Current English that "although letter-writing is not ordinarily taught in composi- tion courses, it is one of the most important forms of written expression." He then keenly adds that "a human being ought to show up even in the most public letters. Impersonal language is not more accurate or official than natural, human language." Edward Corbett briefly discusses the "familiar letter," providing "a list of the conven- tions for the familiar letter" while William Irmscher remarks in The Holt</page><page sequence="4">92 Rhetoric Review Guide to English that "we are all familiar with the style of personal let- ters we ourselves write. There are no conventions to follow." Irmscher's short last chapter concentrates on "Writing Business Letters." In his Preface to The Contemporary Writer, Ross Winterowd notes that "a new chapter has been added that may prove of great practical interest. Betty P. Pytlik, an instructor of business and technical communication, has prepared a chapter on business writing. . . ." Similarly James Mc- Crimmon's Writing with a Purpose has a "new chapter on business let- ters," the last chapter in the book, focusing not on conventional forms but on ways to write for "a situation that the writer recognizes as real and important." And James Hefferman and John Lincoln's recent Writing: A College Handbook includes a final chapter entitled "Beyond Freshman English: Writing Examinations, Applications, and Letters" with suggestions for a cover letter accompanying a job application, a short section on business letter format, and two pages on "The Letter of Protest"--how to overcome "the computerized explanation" or "the words of a machine."9 This fairly representative sampling of recent rhetorics and handbooks suggests that the personal or familiar letter receives little attention as a kind of writing. Why? Two reasons come to mind, though you may think of others. First, personal letters may seem, on the one hand, to be too protean in nature, too far-ranging in possibilities for convenient classification and categorizing or, on the other hand, they may be viewed too simply as autobiographical, as self-expressive, and hence assumed to be adequately treated elsewhere in discussions of "personal writing." If Margaret Boegeman is right that "English instructors are turning away from personal writing and reverting to rhetorical approaches to writing," it is little wonder that personal letters are mostly ignored, though the distinction she makes here merits scrutiny.' But I think there is a second main reason for the focus on business letters almost to the exclusion of personal letters, and that is our profession's present em- phasis, an understandable one, on trying to assist students in obtaining employment. The location of the chapters on business letters in recent writing textbooks--at the end, "beyond English"--and the constant stress on the pragmatic cause me to think of Richard Lloyd-Jones's pertinent observation in his recent article "What We May Become": "One masters languages to master the self and the world, but we haven't made much of that point. We are so pragmatic, so narrowly instrumental, that we justify our courses in terms of filling out job applications and passing other 'serious' courses with prescribed content. The arts, including the art of rhetoric, are frills. "" I Of course, I disagree with Margaret Boegeman when she suggests that</page><page sequence="5">A Habit of Being 93 personal writing is somehow distinct from rhetoric. Even granting the traditional public character of classical rhetoric, students of rhetoric know that "rhetorical approaches to composition" are fundamental to personal writing, including the letter. Edward Corbett points out in his "Survey of Rhetoric" that during the Middle Ages "the province of rhetoric became principally a study of the art of letter writing (ars dic- taminis) and of preparing and delivering sermons (artes praedicandi)." In his Introduction to Seventeenth-Century English Prose David Novarr observes that "formularies which treated letter writing as a legitimate branch of the study of rhetoric were, of course, popular in the Renaissance (they were used in seventeenth-century schools), and the first manual of letter writing in England, William Fulwood's The Enimie of Idleness (1586), thoroughly derivative though it was, had gone through nine editions by 1621." W. S. Howell calls attention to for- mularies focusing on letter writing. He notes that John Clarke's For- mulae Oratoriae (3rd ed., 1629) and Thomas Blount's Academie of Elo- quence (1654) contain sections on letter writing and that Angel Day's The English Secretorie, reprinted eleven times up to 1635, "contained direc- tions to be heeded and models to be followed in letter writing.... It is a formulary rhetoric because it contains models of descriptive, laudatory, vituperative, deliberative, dehortatory, conciliatory, consolatory, amatory, judicial, and familiar letters, as well as many other kinds." Donald Clark has shown Milton's likely use of similar formularies to learn letter writing at St. Paul's School, and John Robert Moore includes the following passage from Daniel Defoe's The Complete English Gentleman to show how The Rev. Charles Morton taught composition to Defoe and other dissenters in Morton's academy in Newington Green just north of London: He had a class for eloquence, and his pupils declaimed weekly in the English tongue, made orations, wrote epistles twice every week upon such subjects as he prescribed to them or upon such as they themselves chose to write upon. Sometimes they were ambassadors and agents abroad. . . . Sometimes they were Ministers of State, Secretaries and Commissioners at home, and wrote orders and instructions abroad.... Thus he taught his pupils to write a masculine and manly style, to write the most polite English, and at the same time to know how to suit their manner as well to the subject they were to write upon as to the persons they were to write to. . .. In short, letter writing, including the composition of familiar, personal</page><page sequence="6">94 Rhetoric Review letters, has traditionally been a part of the teaching of writing. Roger Whitlock's essay "The Monday Letter Writing Assignment" reveals the value of the weekly personal letter in teaching literature.'3 In the remainder of this essay I propose to demonstrate that the personal letter can be of particular value in teaching freshman English composi- tion. I shall briefly describe my procedure for employing this kind of writing, name textbooks and five particular writing assignments I have used so as to help you understand allusions made to them in the illustra- tions I cite from letters, share a variety of examples with you of my use of this weekly letter assignment, and conclude by focusing on the principal uses I have discovered for the personal letter in the composition classroom. For the past eight semesters I have written a personal letter to the twenty members of the honors composition class each week and they, in turn, have written me a personal letter weekly. Although we do not grade each other, we do pay mind to each other's words. I make clear that while individual letters are not graded, the weekly writing of them is expected and considered part of class participation which figures into their final grade. No subjects for the letters are assigned, no length is specified; but I pose this question for myself and the other students: how can we as writers say something worth each other's time and energy? I ditto my letter to them each week, but I typically focus in my salutation on a specific student in the class. Initially this focus is somewhat artificial, but before long--through an information sheet completed the first class meeting, early conferences, and their weekly letters--I learn the students' special interests. Consequently, I try to direct particular letters to particular students yet make each letter's contents of interest to the other students as well. The textbooks I have used over the past four years include Ross Winterowd's The Contemporary Writer, Jim Corder's Contemporary Writing, John Trimble's Writing with Style, and Winston Weathers and Otis Winchester's The New Strategy of Style. For readers I have utilized John Wasson's Subject and Structure, Thomas Cooley's The Norton Sampler, Loren Eiseley's The Immense Journey and The Unexpected Universe, Lewis Thomas's The Lives of a Cell, and Annie Dillard's Pilgrim at Tinker Creek. Among the writing assignments I employ to help emphasize invention and arrangement during the first semester and style during the second, I want to mention succinctly five. For the first assignment, based on the BBC-4 radio program Desert Island Discs, I ask the students to write essays on the seven musical compositions they would want to have with them if they were stranded on a deserted island. The second assignment, based on a suggestion I read by Ezra Pound, re-</page><page sequence="7">A Habit of Being 95 quests the student writers each to describe a campus tree so clearly and vividly that the reader can guess the kind of tree without the author's having named it. The other three assignments I call to your attention all stress study of style. The first asks the class members to copy patterned sentences and paragraphs from The New Strategy of Style and compose their own in imitation of them. The second requests the students to read Mark Twain's "Uncle John's Farm" and each to write about a personal experience utilizing Twain's style. The final assignment of the second term is what Frederick von Ende calls "the autobiographical essay with a twist" and has two parts: the student writes a character sketch for one essay and then, for the final essay in the term, becomes that person earlier sketched and composes an essay, from that character's point of view, about the student. To select the illustrations from the personal letters which follow, I reread almost all the 2,080 weekly student letters--they weigh sixteen pounds on our old bathroom scales--composed over the past four years, and I re-examined the 104 personal letters I had written during that time. Please understand that I am quoting our letters without emendations or revisions so that it will not be hard to find some faults in them. But I believe it important for you to see them as we wrote them in order that you may judge the value of such an undertaking in a composition class. Since some students may not have previously written personal letters to their teachers, I usually spend some time early in the term reading to them some examples of letters written me in the past, suggesting a wide range of possible subjects and encouraging them to keep carbon copies of their letters to me. Then, throughout the term, I use some time in class to read aloud from those letters received the preceding class period. I work hard to exercise careful judgment, keeping authorship anonymous when that is appropriate and, of course, never reading any letter written to me in confidence. The letters read aloud often provoke class discussion of writing and serve as well to stimulate our thinking about ideas for future letters. The student's first letter to me typically is autobiographical, a letter of introduction. One term when our class was reading Eiseley's The Immense Journey, a student not only introduced herself but also helpfully informed me of her religious views in her first personal letter: "Hi. Allow me to introduce myself.... I'm a freshman at TCU studying Modern Dance. . . Most importantly, I'm a born- again, spirit-filled Christian. Jesus is the thrusting, saving, life-giving feature in my life. I'm not afraid to stand up for Him and do not believe in the theory of evolution." Although I try early on to let the students know that I take our writing of these letters seriously, I am not always solemn in my weekly letters. I</page><page sequence="8">96 Rhetoric Review wrote of meeting Cullen Davis while I was ushering at Octoberfest ("I tried to treat him like any other millionaire accused of conspiracy to murder fifteen people"), I described the personal but not quite private letters I have placed in my school office window which faces my daughter's dormitory room ("Dear Cynthia: Bring back the toothpaste, Campbell's soup, hair dryer. Destitutely yours, Dad"), and I have writ- ten the students about the joy I always feel when hearing my 78-year-old neighbor, Mrs. Bennett, quote Emily Dickinson over our hedge. Yet I attempt to focus as much as possible in my letters on the process of writing itself. For example, in the following letter composed in the fall of 1978 when I was writing the assignments along with the other students, I am attempting to help the class members see me as a genuine student, not as a Comma Splice Detective or Paragraph Policeman, and, at the same time, suggesting that invention has to do with our habit of being in the world: Dear Lance and all, I suppose you may find this hard to believe, but I think that I may be learning more than anyone in this Honors English class. The "deserted island seven songs" assignment just goes coursing on, teaching me in ways I had never an- ticipated. Last Sunday I stood up to sing the processional hymn and discovered it to be Beethoven's "Hymn to Joy"--one of the songs mentioned in Sherrie Hamilton's essay. Last evening I was reading in a textbook by my friend and colleague, Jim Corder, when I came across the words of Paul Simon's "The 59th Street Bridge Song (Feelin' Groovy)"--a song listed by Kit Klein and, you won't believe this, a song which has connections with our tree assignment (but that's another letter). Last Friday evening while sitting at the "Friday Night Frog Fever" doings, a sportswriter friend of mine asked me if I had ever heard a song by Tom Lehrer--a song, it turns out, listed by one of you in your "songs" assignment. Even now, Dr. Neil Daniel, Director of the Honors Program this semester, is working on a second essay generated by his conversation with me on this writing assignment; he has already given me his list. Professor David Graham [of the Music Department] has agreed to provide me his list of seven musical compositions for such an island time, Mark Scott, director of music at St. Stephen Presbyterian Church is working on his list, and I am preparing to write Robert Douglas, music critic for the Star-Telegram, about</page><page sequence="9">A Habit of Being 97 this assignment. I have learned that giving such assignments is risky, for the inventive process keeps opening us up to possibilities. I learned a good deal from writing a description of my favorite tree. I wound up going to the library and becoming fascinated by tree books--books on trees of the South, the ancestors of trees, tree worship in India, the tree of imagina- tion in art, A Tree Is Nice in the juvenile collection of the TCU Library, and still other technical books on trees. I learned about apices, bases, margins, venation, fruits, barks, and how hard it is to get a specimen of a leaf from a tree when you are not fourteen feet tall. I wound up collecting magnolia leaves, sycamore leaves, oak leaves, and mimosa leaves. I learned, about the last-named, that mimosa leaves curl up at night to go to sleep. I became more keenly aware, I believe, of the copiousness of creation after I learned something of the myriad ways of distinguishing among kinds of trees and wound up, I must confess, being blessed by an English assign- ment, the darnedest thing you could ever imagine. Just last night I came across this statement by Richard Lar- son quoted in a book by Forest Burt, a friend of mine at Texas A &amp; M, and I guess it connects up with the experiences with invention I have just related: Teachers should, I believe, encourage students to think of invention as much more than finding something to write or talk about; they should help students to see that to engage in "invention" is to learn about the writer's world, and even about himself. It is an act of perceiving and interpreting, an act of noticing features of an object or experience that went previously un- noticed, an act of observing what before had only been seen. Nor is invention only a heightening of observa- tion; it can also be a way of using the intellect and ima- gination to heighten one's understanding--a way of recognizing, through ordered reflection, the full extent of what might be said about an event or experience. Out of paper and time. P.S. My fourteen-year-old daughter went on her first date Saturday. I am learning about more than just English. This letter, in conjunction with study of systematic discovery pro-</page><page sequence="10">98 Rhetoric Review cedures explained in Corder or Winterowd and encouraged in, for exam- ple, Annie Dillard's chapter entitled "Seeing," may enable the students to begin thinking about the writer's world and themselves in it. And soon their own weekly letters reveal this thinking. Mariana writes that "I often find myself dictating to myself letters to be written to you." Terry observes that "after seeing you at the Wilma Rudolph presentation, I thought to myself, 'Dr. Frye's going to write a paper about this.' Are you? or have you?" Sherrie relates, "I enjoyed our brainstorming ses- sion Friday. It really did help me think of new ways to look at things.... The Pentad is helpful too. I think I do this almost all the time--I just never thought of writing it all down." Remembering our class discussion of varying perspectives, Kit writes with some exaggera- tion: "The English class Wednesday helped me obtain a new outlook on life. The particle/wave/field analogy, I found, holds true for all my science coarses. For example, in metamorphic rocks, a rock itself is an entity, but from that entity we can determine the process of change, sug- gest by the name metamorphic, and its part in the system, in the earth itself." Ann explains her inventive process: "As I was playing my Chopin Nocturne this evening, I began to file through my mind for possi- ble letter topics. When practicing the piano I usually have to concentrate on the piece, but I know that Nocturne well enough that my mind is able to wander. Somehow my thoughts shifted to a phone conversation I had last night." In Ann's observation we can see evidence of what Donald Murray calls the "rehearsal process" (especially apt here), the way writers proceed before they actually write.'6 As the students become more sharply aware of the process of inven- tion, I ask them, for one assignment, to describe the way they proceeded through their stages of composing their tree description paper. Then to illustrate how I follow a similar discovery process, I sometimes share with them my way of inventing. Here, for example, is the major part of a letter that began on what it is that professors do: Now in the cold morning light--well, it's not light yet--I am still thinking about that question: what is it that professors do? One answer comes immediately--they believe in students. And another answer follows: they express this belief by writing letters of recommendation for students--for jobs, for scholarships, for memberships, for honors and recognition. And since I had asked you to focus on your process of writing your tree paper, I decided to attempt to describe my process in writing a letter of recommendation for a student. The following specific example came to mind.</page><page sequence="11">A Habit of Being 99 "Dr. Frye, I'm applying for a Fulbright Fellowship and I wonder if you would write a letter of recommendation for me." "Sure, Mary, I'd be happy to," I replied. Then I almost immediately asked Mary some questions: when was the deadline, what was the nature of her project, what country did she plan to study in if awarded a Fulbright, and some ad- ditional questions which I now misremember. My composi- tion had begun. I already had a need to write--one of Jim Corder's chief concerns in his essay "What I learned at School"--and my inventive processes were underway. Mary agreed to bring me the next day a list of her school activities-- honors received, clubs belonged to, grades earned, employ- ment experience gained--as well as a description of her proj- ect. As usual, I placed a note about her request on my not neat desk and turned to other tasks. The next day Mary brought me her project description along with the official application form. On it there was a place to put "x's" in boxes to "indicate the applicant's ability and professional competence in comparison with other in- dividuals whom you have known at similar stages in their career." I completed this section and then moved on to the part requesting me to "add remarks that would help in the evaluation of this candidate." I read the directions: "Com- ment specifically on the feasibility of the applicant's project in terms of resources available abroad, ability of the applicant to carry out the project and in the allotted time, linguistic preparation for the proposed plan, the candidate's ability to adapt to a different cultural environment, and any other fac- tors which you believe may have a bearing on the candidate's successful experience overseas." The instructions added: "An extra sheet may be attached, if necessary." It was clear to me that some of what I must say was already dictated by the directions. How could I use these directions to generate subject matter? Now that I look back on my inventive procedures, I can see that I quickly focused on the particular means I had for knowing the Fulbright candidate and the kinds of informa- tion required: my knowledge of her family and their rich cultural interests (books, paintings, music, travel); my con- versations with Mary; my experience with Mary as her teacher (classroom behavior, grades, kinds of papers, performance</page><page sequence="12">100 Rhetoric Review on examinations, abilities as reader and talker and writer, her use of the English language, her double major in English and German); my file of recommendations written for previous applicants for fellowships and awards; my own experience as a seeker of fellowships and as a member of a committee evaluating applications from students. Based on previous experience writing recommendations, I knew that my job was twofold: first, to convey clearly in my letter the excellent character of the applicant (personal traits such as curiosity, sense of humor, ability to articulate orally and in writing, sense of modesty and humility yoked with intellectual acuity) as well as her chiefly academic qualifications; and second, to make myself believable by the care and particularity and sense of genuine interest and concern in my letter. Thinking about all these matters and imagining how my audience would likely receive my remarks, I began by trying to create a sense of the rich cultural background of this stu- dent and, more importantly, explaining lucidly how she had taken advantage of the cultural opportunities. I decided to create a scene set in her home, for I have often been there, focusing on the books and records and paintings which have surrounded her. I then tried to recollect where I had actually seen Mary and remembered lectures, concerts, receptions for famous writers, and my classroom. I decided to stress this firsthand observation and to emphasize last in my paragraph, in order to drive the point home, how exceptional a student in the classroom this student had been. I got out my old grade book and noted her grades as well as her paper topics, for I knew that referring to particular writing she had done would help create belief in my audience. In writing about her han- dling of the English language, I remembered her facility in French and German and decided to work that material in. I remembered her bringing her cello to class, and decided to work that information in to reveal her interest in music. I remarked on her intellectual curiosity and her almost inor- dinate conscientiousness. At some point in my thinking about this student I decided to comment briefly on the thorough education of her parents as well as on my having seen, firsthand, Mary serve refreshments during a reception for a Nobel Prize-winning writer in her home; the first would suggest the cultural richness of her background and the second would permit me to comment on her sense of decorum</page><page sequence="13">A Habit of Being 101 and propriety. Having given thought to all these possibilities, I decided to devote only one paragraph, the penultimate one, to answering the specific questions raised in the application's directions about her linguistic preparation, adapting to a foreign culture, and so on. I spoke directly to these matters, and then, in the final paragraph, yoked together the chief characteristics of Mary relating to her personal character and her academic abilities. Finally, I suggested that she merited more than routine praise and recommended her without any reservations whatsoever. What is it that professors do? Clearly one activity is the writing of letters of recommendation. Clearly, too, that writing takes consideration, takes reflection, takes thought, takes research, takes remembering, takes time. In fact, it may well be that this writing is not altogether unlike most good writing; the author must go to considerable trouble to do a good job. But for a student like Mary, going to considerable trouble is a privilege; indeed, for almost every single student for whom I write a recommendation, trouble it really isn't. At least, so it seems to me on this dark, now rainy morning. I profess it to be so. After all, I am a professor, and part of what I do is to believe in students. I hope that you stay dry and warm today. What this personal letter may help the students see is not only how one writer may go about finding material for a recommendation letter but also how the process of invention seems to blend almost indistinguishably into the process of arrangement. Seeing this, the students may be encouraged toward a habit of being: "Invention and structure, then, represent a way of being in the world.... You are asked to be open and always closing."' Two consequences of this focus on invention and the need to find a subject for each week's letter are a heightened awareness, a keenly improved sense of copious life all around, and also an emphasis on writing as process. Cathy recognizes the need for such attention, noting in one of her letters: "You said that you were continually finding topics on which you wished you could write. I don't think the problem lies in our having few experiences and your having many. I think the problem lies in our inability to see those things which are going on around us." But the students soon begin to see more effectively. Karen remarks: "Today on my way to your class, I saw a squirrel run under a tree. He</page><page sequence="14">102 Rhetoric Review stopped suddenly as he saw me, flicked his tail, and set up quizzically on his hind feet. While I watched him, I thought back to Annie Dillard's essay on 'Seeing.' It does make a difference to notice insignificant things going on around you, I learned." Steve made a discovery: "I felt separate when I was [back] in Marlin. The same people were there, but something was different. It was like the [Brueghel] Icarus picture and Annie Dillard's pennies. I noticed things I had taken for granted while living in Marlin. I never realized how many people I could see just walk- ing down the four block main street." Janet from Missouri reports: "Since reading 'The Eagle' and 'The Turtle,' I do seem to be more aware of the power of active verbs. Even Annie Dillard has had an affect on me. I was walking back to the dorm by way of the fountain one day late last week when I noticed at least a dozen (I stopped and counted) Monarch butterflies flitting around and landing on the grass near the fountain. Could it be I was actually 'seeing' in the way she wrote about 'seeing'? Perhaps your persistence is finally paying off.... Through their letters, Janet and Steve and Karen reveal a keener con- sciousness of the world they inhabit and hold their experiences in words, thereby illustrating a point made by Dorothy Guth in her Introduction to the Letters of E. B. White: "Letters show the direction of a person's life. They capture, in an informal but immediate way, many of its episodes."18 Weekly personal letters, like journals and commonplace books, provide students a place to store up significant episodes and in- cidents and, in addition, offer the advantage of an opportunity to share these experiences with a trusted audience beyond themselves. In my weekly letter to the students I often try to capture an episode or event out of my own life so as to hold and keep the experience and, simulta- neously, illustrate how important and useful and valuable writing may be. Here is my letter from September 30, 1980: Dear Daphne and all, You may recall that in my last letter to you, we were visiting, you and I, about my partiality for letters. They pro- vide, among other pleasures (I almost wrote things), a means for me to go fishing in my sea of memory, for, having cap- tured out of time a special experience in a letter, I can, whenever I please, call that experience back and make it as real as it ever was. I am a different person now than I was when first I used loops and curves and squiggles on a page to hold that event, that incident, and I find it fun and educa- tional to mingle my present self with my earlier self speaking in a letter. There is a kind of community in this experience of</page><page sequence="15">A Habit of Being 103 selves, and there is joy in it. Perhaps this communion is what John Donne had in mind when he wrote that "letters mingle souls. " Perhaps I can illustrate what I mean. On October 23, 1978--close to two years ago now--I composed the following letter. Through it I can, for a little while, defeat Time and renew my joy all over again. For me, learning is exciting, and because my ignorance is great, I have ample opportunity to keep on learning, sometimes in unexpected places. Last week, for instance, I was lessoned by events surrounding my daughter Cynthia's eighteenth birthday, by activities I participated in while on a trip from Carswell Air Force Base to Barksdale AFB in Shreveport, and by paying attention to my hymn book in church. In this note to you I shall focus on the first of these learning experiences, saving the others for later. I shall only add here that Annie Dillard is right: there are coppers to be found if we learn to see. Sunday a week ago was Cynthia's eighteenth birthday, and I learned how important some events can be in a young person's life and, more importantly, how thoughtful young folks can be. Of course, when I awoke Sunday morning, I was not immediately impressed by the youthful thoughtfulness as I peered out my bedroom window and saw that the mimosa and elm in our front yard had been transmogrified overnight. I have learned recently not only that a mimosa is a Texas drink (champagne and orange juice) only slightly inferior to Ovaltine, but also that a mimosa closes up its leaves for sleep at night. Yet I did not know until last Sunday that mimosas sometimes put out long, white fruits which wind and circle and dip and curve and blow in the wind. In one night our ordinary mimosa had become arbor Aurora. The mimosa's leaves may have been asleep, but Cyn- thia's friends were not. Indeed, our old elm, so valiant in fighting against the elm leaf beetle, was simply no match for Northern Tissue. And as I pulled and tugged gently on the elusive, soft, double-strength fruit of these changed trees while thousands upon thousands of peering and pointing and laughing motorists drove by on their way to study about the Tree of Life, I learned, too, another reason why fathers exist-- to unwrap trees.</page><page sequence="16">104 Rhetoric Review But my unwrapping was nothing compared to the joy opened up for Cynthia by her thoughtful and considerate friends. Several of them kidnapped her, friendly style, early Sunday morning to whisk her away to the Old South Pancake House where she got special pancakes, a birthday song, and much attention. Then, on the pretense of going out to DFW Regional Airport to pick up a friend, Cynthia's generous acquaintances instead picked up a gift they had prearranged-- a black-with-red-interior 1978 Camaro which they had rented for her to drive for two whole days. Shortly thereafter, when Cynthia wheeled smoothly into our mortgaged driveway and eased up behind our 1967 Mustang, 1956 Ford, and 1938 Chevrolet and exclaimed, "Hey, Dad, look what I've got--my own Camaro," I learned another reason that fathers exist--to faint dead away at the sudden announcements of daughters. Steadied by my wife and wiping my forehead with some excess Northern Tissue which was handy, I composed myself slowly as Cynthia explained. And then I learned the best lesson of all--how daughters look when they are ecstatic, how daughters sound when they giggle uncontrollably, how daughters' eyes look when they know that they are loved. And I was lessoned and blessed thereby and gained a slight advance in my immense journey toward understanding children. See what I mean, Daphne? Of course, it may readily be objected that students may be willing to let me write about my family if that makes me happy, may be willing in their weekly letters to mention Dillard and Eiseley and "heuristics" and other English stuff to make me salivate. These honors students, it may be argued, know about Pavlov. Being a skeptical sort, I would perhaps agree with this objection except that there is too much evidence in their letters to the contrary. I have other means of knowing them, please remember--conferences, exercises, eight essays, classroom discussion-- but the letters themselves suggest that they are not merely playing games with me. In fact, the rapport achieved through our semester-long weekly exchange effectively gains trust and creates that fiduciary relationship which Walter J. Ong argues is fundamental to genuine teaching--and to language itself.19 The way we employ our language in our weekly letters creates confidence in one another and the students soon feel comfortable</page><page sequence="17">A Habit of Being 105 enough to respond critically to assignments and to the way class is con- ducted. After some mention of computer forms for use in student evaluation of classes, Steve writes: "What is this class evaluation? I've heard alot about it, but no one has explained it. I think these letters we've been writing could be used as a class evaluating guide." And he is right. Janet tactfully but forcefully makes her point: "Before I end this letter, I thought I'd take a minute or two and comment on class discussions. I'm paying attention; I think most of us are. But sometimes I feel like I'm two steps behind you; your mind works more quickly than mine works. I try to expect the unexpected because the discussion often seems to take off in what I consider unusual directions. Sometimes it seems safer not to say anything. I'm not always willing to lay my life on the line for something I say, and frankly, there are times when you remind me of a firing squad." Bryan is more direct in his first letter of his second semester with me: "Good luck in starting out the new semester! I can see your trying to be more prompt and less wandering in teaching the class. . . ." When I assigned the students to write eight paragraphs in imitation of patterned paragraphs in The New Strategy of Style, Jane wrote: "Now, just when the end is in sight, you say in class that we have eight paragraphs due next Wednesday. My God, I'll never get out of this." Lisa adds, "Gee, what came over you? 8 paragraphs? Are you trying to make us martyrs or something?" The students' thoughtful criticisms, as distinct from mere thoughtless complaints, often cause me to reconsider assignments and modify them whenever appropriate. After drawing on some helpful ideas in Walker Gibson's Persona: A Style Study for Readers and Writers and asking the students to write an account of a neighborhood knockdown-dragout-fight from the points of view of a neighbor, a policeman, and a journalist, I received this thoughtful criticism in a weekly letter: "I've been thinking about this last assignment and its purpose. If we were supposed to be writing police and newspaper reports that were somewhat authentic, I think we could have some more coaching in those areas. I know I could have. Did you ever think of inviting some people who are familiar with these types of writing to talk to our class about the basics of such writing? I'm sure that something like this would have helped me." As a consequence of this letter I have subsequently invited my colleagues from the Depart- ment of Journalism, for example, to speak to the class about how they would approach this writing assignment, and I have encouraged students to talk with police officers about writing up such incidents. John writes: "I enjoyed our second assignment. I went down to the police station to pick up a couple of incident forms and the officer toured me around the</page><page sequence="18">106 Rhetoric Review police house and even showed me the jail cells." When I assigned the students and myself to copy from The New Strategy of Style fifteen stylistic sentences and then compose original ones in those styles, Jim wrote that "it is difficult to remain so thoughtful and insightful through so many sentences," Cara said "after the first 10 I was really sick of writing sentences," and Sharon used the weekly letter as an occasion to satirize the assignment: "Shhh! Can't you see she's busy?" Mrs. Ramsey told Mr. Carter. "You'll have to wait in the parlor until Sharon will see you. She's BUILDING SENTENCES, you know." "Oh, yes. I see," the President murmured. "That's why I came to visit. I was hoping she would donate an inversion or positive-negative sequence for my State of the Union Ad- dress. Wording is so important for these things. Do you think she could help?" He pleadingly asked, waiting impa- tiently for an answer. "I suppose . . ." Mrs. Ramsey began, interrupted by Sharon's sudden entrance into the parlor. "Mother! You'll never believe it--I've created a new sentence type! I call it Episplolepdytonphora. Marvellous! It is a complex, repetitive sentence of precisely 49 syllables read in an iambic pentameter sort of rhythm, and with a comma after every third word and every 5th word the same! Isn't it terrific? I must telephone Winchester and Weathers immediately to tell them--why, hello, Jimmy! How are you today? What brings you here?" "I was ... uh . . ." Mr. Carter stammered in the presence of such a great and prolific mind. "Help with the Union Address for tomorrow?" Sharon psychically guessed.... "Earth to Sharon, Earth to Sharon! Sharon! Hey!" her roommate gently shook Sharon's shoulder. "Huh?" "You've been staring again. You'd better finish that English for tomorrow before you fall asleep!" the roommate warned. The message is clear, and in an ungraded piece of weekly writing Sharon has skillfully practiced her rhetoric. The weekly personal letter has its uses. As a writing teacher you cannot read a set of student letters every week</page><page sequence="19">A Habit of Being 107 without realizing anew what it means to be a student. The letters convey a sharp sense of immediacy. You learn where letters get written: "I'm writing this letter on board a 727. . . . It is 3:00 a. m." "Sorry if my writing is pretty bad right now but I'm on a bus ... somewhere between San Antonio and Austin." Or "I am writing you from the Tarrant County Convention Center Theatre because I am here to see the Royal Winnipeg Ballet perform. I guess I must look pretty professional sitting here writing in my little blue notebook (Maybe someone will think I'm a critic)." The writing materials the students sometimes use are revealing-- drawing paper, computer paper--and one student composed her entire letter about the possible causes for a single, odd-shaped page in her chemistry notebook. Especially after following a classroom session on John Trimble's "openers" and "closers," you may share the exhilara- tion, the relaxation of tension, in Sherrie's letter opening, "My computer programs worked! Both of them!" And you may experience, too, the chilling starkness of a student's closing her letter with a single sentence paragraph, "My dad has a tumor and I can't bear to think about it." The personal letters provide glimpses of joys and of despair. For a teacher there is particular joy in learning of the students' discoveries about writing. Jane from Minnesota writes in an informal letter: "I was just reading The New Strategy of Style tonight.... The book empha- sized the fact that formal is not necessarily better than informal, as many teachers seem to think. All through school I had 'formal is right, infor- mal is wrong' drilled into my head. What a nice surprise to see a book that realized that both are right or wrong in different situations." And Linda from Toronto remarks: "After reading the assignment for today, 'The Paragraph and You,' pp. 125-132, the whole business of the per- sonal versus the impersonal style became much clearer. Winterowd's examples of the two styles drove the point home." You soon learn that most students come to value the weekly letter and that they take the teacher seriously as a true audience. John notes that "at times this has been the only outlet for thoughts I needed to express," and an irate Elizabeth begins, "Many people contend that writing serves as a form of catharsis. As anger and frustration spew from my pen, I am quickly becoming a firm believer in that contention."20 Christa ends her speculations on a career, "I write this to you because it's one of the few lights in my pre-midterm world of darkness. Just writing about something good that is possible makes me feel better about going back to reading my psychology. Thank you for lending your eyes &amp; ears"--her words recalling an image Pablo Neruda uses to describe his feeling upon receiving a personal letter from the Uruguayan poet Sabat Ercasty: "It was a flash of light in the darkness, of clarity, and I am still grateful for</page><page sequence="20">108 Rhetoric Review it. The letter spent a good many days in my pocket, wrinkling until it fell apart."2' Implicit in these weekly letters is the students' genuine interest in con- veying important personal experiences and accomplishments to the teacher as person, not teacher as The Writing Authority. Jenni reports, "Sunday I auditioned to take master classes with Erik Bruhun and I made it," and in a postscript Alison gladly shares her joy, "I made a 'B' on the Descartes paper." Ann inquires, misspelling and all, "Have you had a chance to listen to Pachabel's Cannon yet?" Karen writes, "You've appeared a little fatigued lately. Don't over-do it." And Diane unabashedly offers encouragement: "When I get my graded papers back from you, somewhere in the paper I'll read, '. . . good job--this is excellent' scrawled in your red ink. Reading this always encourages me and makes me feel like I ought to keep on going. Well, I think teachers need this kind of encouragement too. That's why I wrote you this little section--to say, i. . . I've learned a lot,' and GOOD JOB DR. FRYE...." Of course, such encouragement, always needed, always welcome, is yet put into perspective when you read another letter in the same set that begins, "It was lucky that my mom and I saw you today. You always put her in such a good mood and I had to talk to her about 'money matters,' namely borrowing some. It worked, too! Thanks for your unconscious assistance." It is helpful to know what teachers are for. I want to conclude this overview of the variety of uses for weekly per- sonal letters in the composition classroom by noting their value to the writing teacher, their worth to students in helping them pay mind to language, and, finally, their use in dramatizing how invention and struc- ture, in particular, complement one another. The value of weekly letters to the teacher's own writing should not be overlooked. They provide me, for example, a convenient means for sav- ing up ideas. I often use letters as I otherwise would use a commonplace book but with the advantage that they enable me to share my finds with students who themselves are seeking Annie Dillard's "coppers."22 I may come across a keen paragraph on listening by William Stringfellow in the Friends Journal ("Listening is a primitive act of love in which a person gives himself to another's word, making himself accessible and vulnerable to that word"), I may learn from a graduate student about Neruda's remarkable paragraph on "The Word" in his Memoirs ("But words fell like pebbles out of the boots of the barbarians, out of their beards, their helmets, their horseshoes, luminous words that were left glittering here ... our language.... They carried off the gold and left us the gold"), and I may discover a passage in Rilke's letters reminding me</page><page sequence="21">A Habit of Being 109 of Annie Dillard (QC]1ing ... to the little things that hardly anyone sees. . . . [Cultivate] this love of inconsiderable things and seek quite simply ... to win the confidence of what seems poor"). I may locate in Eiseley's autobiography a provocative paragraph on writing ("In all the question- ing about what makes a writer, and especially perhaps the personal essayist, I have seen little reference to this fact; namely, that the brain has become a kind of unseen artist's loft"), I may copy out Will Durant's paragraph on the civilizing effect of the common noun ("The beginning of humanity came when some freak or crank, half animal and half man, squatted in a cave or in a tree, cracking his brain to invent the first com- mon noun, the first sound-sign that would signify a group of like objects"), and a colleague may lead me to a short passage in the Chroni- cle of Higher Education defining genuine teaching ("Teaching, as op- posed to instruction, is the process of bringing a person, insofar as possi- ble, to see"). I copy these passages down on whatever is handy, but I make a point of including them in my letters so as to hold onto them myself and to share them with those studying writing with me. Conse- quently, the other students observe the older one making discoveries and thinking about what he has found. The weekly letters thereby help me to pursue that goal Alfred North Whitehead set for teachers: "It should be the chief aim of a university professor to exhibit himself in his own true character--that is, as an ignorant man thinking, actively utilising his small share of knowledge."23 In "English: An Enabling Discipline" Richard Larson has suggested that "the study of English in the first two [college] years should, if it does nothing else, make a student sensitive to the workings of language...." W. E. Coles, Jr. adds that "a writer can be led to understand he cannot live anywhere but in the languages he knows. .9924 Classroom discus- sions of the nature of language--its capacity for freeing us, its limita- tions, its varieties, its constant changes--generate an awareness of language which is reflected in the students' weekly letters. Wendi asks, "Can you explain how a semester that is winding-down can wind-up at the same time?" Holly gently reprimands me for making her so con- scious of etymologies that when she was studying the Counter Reforma- tion, suddenly "on my paper those words decided to give me . .. a new interpretation. I honestly saw men in white work clothes in my kitchen, peeling off formica, remodeling the counter top.... I think you're 'get- ting to me'.... " Troy observes, "Our latest reading in Corder got me started . . . wondering if there were any bad words. By bad words, I don't mean dirty words that little kids write on walls; I mean words that really do harm and make the world a little more difficult to live in." He then cites communist, American, Christian, Iranian, and Cosell as words</page><page sequence="22">110 Rhetoric Review which seem to create division instead of community. Janet thinks about selecting appropriate language for writing her essay in imitation of Mark Twain's style in "Uncle John's Farm" and then conveys a revealing observation: "By the way, I can relate to the way you go about writing papers. I started getting down to serious business on this one while I was ironing clothes." Janet's attention to language as well as to her process for preparing to write language reminded me to follow Donald Murray's advice "to give careful attention to what happens between the moment the writer receives an idea or an assignment and the moment the first completed draft is begun. We need to understand, as well as we can, the complicated and intertwining processes of perception and conception through language."25 Finally, the students and I have learned that the ideas captured in the structure of one letter may provide an opening into another letter. We have discovered together that invention and arrangement are not mu- tually exclusive but may nurture and sustain one another. Ann remarks, "Your last letter, concerning your family's patience with you, really reminded me of my dad. The similarity between things you postpone and those my dad puts off is amazing." And her letter on her father begins. Jane's discovery that informal writing is not always wrong, that her literature background is not as strong as that of her classmates, may generate another composition: "Maybe I'll write a letter to the head of our [high school] English department. . . ." But it was Cecilia Berber who provided me the most interesting lesson about how invention and structure and style all may combine effectively in a thoughtful personal letter. After two semesters of writing a letter to me every week, Cecilia discovered an occasion when the letter form itself became an especially useful device to employ. For the "autobiographical essay with a twist" assignment, she wrote a character sketch of her father, director of the Coro de la Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico in Mexico City. Then for her final essay, she put on the mask of her father, she became him, and she imagined, not unlike Defoe in Morton's dissenting academy in seventeenth-century England, that she was her father writing a per- sonal letter to his wife about Cecilia--in Spanish. This piece of writing was a natural outgrowth of our use of the weekly personal letter in class, although it did take me longer than usual to grade. What uses have I learned for the personal letter in the composition classroom? I think I have not yet discovered all the uses, but eight prin- cipal ones appear to be these: 1. The informal nature of the personal letter helps to build confidence and create a positive situation in which to express ourselves into being. We have already had experience with the convention of the personal let-</page><page sequence="23">A Habit of Being 111 ter. It offers, as Demetrius noted centuries ago, a "degree of freedom" and hence elicits from us thoughts and feelings without that too often in- 26 hibiting quality which attends some other writing forms. W. S. Lewis, describing why Horace Walpole chose the personal letter form, notes: "He chose his correspondents with care, each was the channel through which one particular interest chiefly flowed. The cardinal point with each was that he could be written to rapidly and easily, as if he were be- ing talked to by the fireside in the evening at Strawberry Hill. . . . This gave a sharpness and an excitement to what he was saying, but in that room talking, as it were, to his carefully chosen friend, he was without fear."27 2. The weekly letter assignment provides a real audience, a true au- dience. In a note "To the Student with a Word or Two for the Teacher" Gary Tate has written: "One of the major difficulties of writing papers in school, especially in English classes, is that you have no audience to address. The teacher is always present, of course, but cannot really serve as a true audience. . . The teacher comes [to a piece of writing] to evaluate, to judge, to praise, to condemn, not to learn or to be amused." 28 But if the teacher's weekly personal letters make clear that "a teacher is always a student, pleased to learn from those who limp as well as leap through their lessons"; if the teacher's weekly letters make clear that the freshman English class "is a course the students and [teacher] take together"; if the teacher's letters afford opportunity to learn about writing as Elmer Suderman and Ken Macrorie and Jim Cor- der have learned about it by responding to their own assignments, then surely the weekly personal letters, by placing the teacher regularly in the same predicament as the students, may habitually, routinely create the ethos of the teacher-as-learner, making her or him believable, real, a true audience. And, of course, the weekly exchange of letters familiarizes the teacher with the students' ways of being and helps to make each of them a real audience as well. 3. Over the course of an entire term the weekly letter assignment may create a genuine need to write and may manifest an immediacy not always evident in other writing assignments. Many of the students may feel the need to vent their critical responses to classroom assignments and behaviors, to report their observations, to share their frustrations and joys with a sympathetic reader, to think and explore and talk in good company, to see connections among disciplines and thus begin to appre- ciate writing as a "central academic process." The personal letter may enable the students to "bring the reality of their own lives, their own language, into the classroom."30 4. The weekly letter focuses attention on the process of invention itself</page><page sequence="24">112 Rhetoric Review and demonstrates how letters as structures may themselves "provide another entry in the inventive world" in which the student lives. 5. The personal nature of the weekly letters provides a ready means for encouraging one another--teacher encouraging student, student en- couraging teacher. It is pertinent to remember here, I believe, that Loren Eiseley's first college English teacher accused him of plagiarism--"You didn't compose this; it is too well written"--and thereby so discouraged him that he turned away from literary studies into science. Yet en- couragement earlier in his life had come to him in the words of a letter-- his father's--being burned in a pile of letters by Eiseley's aunt: As I stood beside her a charred sheet turned over. Written across it in the fine bold penmanship of my father was a sentence rapidly being obliterated in the flames. I saw it curl and crumble as I read. "Remember, the boy is a genius, but moody." Whatever reservations the letter contained would never be read by me. There was only the little licking flame and the words curling up and going black. I could never reread them. Of course I was no genius, of course I was moody, as anyone young would have been under the restraints of that household. Nevertheless, the words were proudly comforting. My father 32 had recognized me after all. We all need recognition, we all need encouragement. 6. The weekly letter assignment may enable us as writing teachers to respond to the thoughtful criticism of Richard Lloyd-Jones who suggests that many of us "haven't really bothered to make use of what's been known for centuries...." I need, for example, to learn more about how letter writing has been taught, and I find Edward Corbett's words en- couraging: "Today we cannot afford to neglect formal training in this form of discourse. Letters--friendly letters, business letters, promotional letters, letters to the editor--are the major form of written discourse that many of us will be called upon to produce after we leave school. There is as much rhetoric involved in some kinds of letters (the 'begging letter,' for instance) as there is in the most elaborate campaign oratory."33 7. As teachers writing letters to students every week, we may show, not merely tell, we may practice, not merely profess, Our letters may complement our journals and commonplace books with the added ad- vantage of sharing our own writing-in-process with an audience who themselves are engaged in the same activity, practicing their rhetoric. A real consequence of this shared activity is that value which Dr. Johnson found in quotations--"a community of mind."34</page><page sequence="25">A Habit of Being 113 8. Perhaps most importantly, writing weekly letters encourages a habit of mind, a habit of being. In her Introduction to Flannery O'Con- nor's letters, Sally Fitzgerald alludes to a phrase in Jacques Maritain's Art and Scholasticism, "the habit of art," with habit being defined "not as mere mechanical routine, but as an attitude or quality of mind...." She then goes on to describe in O'Connor "a second distinguished habit, which I have called 'the habit of being': an excellence not only of action but of interior disposition and activity that increasingly reflected the ob- ject, the being, which specified it, and was itself reflected in what she did and said."35 Although we know that thoughtless routine may trivialize us, that careless habit may demean us, William Gruber has shown that by "ritualizing our lives, we impose a saving human form on an otherwise shapeless and meaningless universe. That is what we strive to teach students when we teach composition: to impose some saving organization--a form--on the chaos of experience."36 The personal letter is one means of giving shape and form to ourselves. It may help us speak ourselves into being. These, then, are the principal uses I have found for the personal letter in the composition classroom. Of course, the ritual of writing a letter every week, the habit of continually looking for Annie Dillard's "cop- pers," occasionally may extend well beyond the immediate composition classroom. Two Christmases ago I received a card from a young lady in Kansas who had transferred back there. It began: "I'm writing you a note, and it's not even Thursday, but I guess Christmas is a worthy enough occasion." And a student now teaching Spanish to second graders in Austin who, as a freshman four years ago, wrote me a letter weekly, included the following in a personal letter she sent shortly after she graduated: "Thank you for awakening me to everyday wonders by having me read 'Seeing' by Annie Dillard. I hope I will always be alert to coppers strewn along my path." These two students are, I suspect, atypical. Sometimes the weekly let- ter assignment may not work, and there are risks for the teacher who engages in this exchange, a certain vulnerability being one. Like Murray's teaching by conferences, it is an "exposed kind of teaching."37 There is also always the temptation for the teacher to show off--witness my use of penultimate in the letter about writing a Fulbright recommendation--and sometimes students, especially shy, reticent ones, may feel threatened by such personal writing, preferring the comparative safety of more customary theme assignments. As a writing teacher who has tried discovery procedures ranging from Ann Berthoff's dialectical HDWDWW (How Did, Who Did, Where, When) to Jim Corder's mysterious TUTU rhythmic method, I know that personal letters provide</page><page sequence="26">114 Rhetoric Review no final answers any more than sentence combining or use of sequences of assignments. All may be helpful, all may be useful, but no single method is ever enough. Moreover, a teacher who uses personal letters as part of a composition program may be dismissed as a member of the "True-Confessions-Let-It-All-Hang-Out School."38 The best corrective to this extreme view is, I believe, William E. Coles, Jr.'s excellent article "An Unpetty Pace" in which he, clearly a caring teacher, argues co- gently that a teacher ought to be more than "a Human Bean" for students and adds that "I may be most a human being in refusing to trifle with my students' humanity, in working to create a role which acknowledges the specialness of our relationship, its limitations, its op- portunities, its risks."39 To provide a cautionary example of the inadequacy of my use of per- sonal letters in the composition classroom, I want to close by sharing with you a letter that didn't work, a letter that failed. Along with some other colleagues I was asked--in a letter--to compose a paragraph on wisdom. Right away I knew that I needed help, so I requested the assistance of the students in composition class with me. We went through several systematic discovery procedures, noting, among other things, that owls and wisdom are frequently related. When we came to our assignment to imitate Weathers and Winchester's "The Patterned Paragraph (Decreasing Length)," I did the assignment along with the other students. I wrote: I searched my mind, looking into every nook and niche of it, turning over first this idea and then that one, cogitating, meditating, contemplating, ruminating, tumbling notions over and over, seeking information which would help me write a paragraph on wisdom by Tuesday. I thought of wise men's sayings, I thought of the Bible, I thought of my father, I thought of books I had read, and I thought of all those associations which the word wisdom resurrects. And then, like a dim memory swimming slowly, laboriously, inexorably from the recesses of my mind, I saw an owl. Then I knew that this wisely foolish, foolishly wise bird was my donnee. The owl's mythic qualities would help me write. My paragraph took shape. The next week I shared the following piece of writing with the class as my letter: The owl, of course, is the symbol of wisdom. We all know</page><page sequence="27">A Habit of Being 115 that; we are quite certain of that. From the Greeks' Pallas Athene to A. A. Milne's lovable "Wol," owls have been associated with wisdom. We know that. The owl, with a broad head like ours, with a beak just where our nose is, with a vertical body like ours--the anthropomorphic owl is wise. It has uncommon vision and its stony silence in the daytime sug- gests human contemplation, human rumination. The owl, we know, is wise; it is like us. And if certainty of knowledge is wisdom, then wisdom is all about us. We know things with certainty; just ask us. We know how the Administration should run the University; we know what high standards are; we know how classes should be taught; we know how cafeterias should be run, infirmaries administered, football teams coached, buildings maintained, curricula revised, traf- fic regulations enforced, funds raised, air conditioning con- trolled, scholarship defined. We blink our big horn-rimmed eyes impatiently, wondering why all do not see the truth as we see it, why all do not define excellence as we define it, why all do not perceive the right as we perceive it. And, I suggest, by such continual professing of our certainty, we confirm our lack of wisdom. For, as it turns out, the owl symbolizes foolishness, folly, evil, and death as well. It depicts stupidity (fables from Aesop to Fontaine to Thurber), represents uncleanliness (Leviticus and Deuteronomy), presages death (Shakespeare), pictures grotesque evil (Hieronymus Bosch), names a whore (19th-C. British slang), cures whooping cough (Yorkshire), and foretells loss of virginity (Wales). A demonic owl joins a ludricous ape and lecherous goat on a ceiling panel of the Peterborough Cathedral in central England, provides a disguise for an evil magician in Tchaikovsky's Swan Lake, contributes to the three witches' brew in Macbeth, and (according to Pennant) saved the life of that great exemplar of academic freedom, Genghis Khan. The owl, we now know for certain, is the symbol of foolishness, of error. And we are as unwise as before. For wisdom becomes, in part, a matter of acknowledging our own ignorance, doubting our own certainty, tolerating other ver- sions of truth than our own. If as the Psalmist contends, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom," surely another useful beginning is to admit our uncertainty. The owl, we discover, is us but not as we had expected; for as Alexander Pope reminds us, man is "the glory, jest, and</page><page sequence="28">116 Rhetoric Review riddle of the world" all at once--wise and foolish, certain and ignorant, owl-like, ever failing, ever aspiring. Wisdom, like happiness, is not to be found, possessed, boxed up, but must be sought--continually, incessantly, tolerantly, humbly. And even--a sobering thought--if we begin to approach wisdom, we, like glorious Solomon, the archetype of wisdom, can only hope to finish second to the lilies of the field. In their letters Larry said that my piece on wisdom was too long for one paragraph, Vicki asked me if I had ever considered being a minister, and Lori, who had recently pledged Chi Omega and signed her letter "The Owl Gal," said she would really like to talk some more about owls but needed to study for a calculus test.40 Well, I've got to go. I have a set of compositions to mark, the students' weekly personal letters to read, a letter of recommendation to compose for a student applying for a Fulbright, and a personal letter to write to a man who has somehow lost part of his humanity to a task force. Write when you can--to your students, for your students, with your students. Give them my best--and yours. Please write. Notes 1.

There are few publications which specifically treat the use of the personal letter in teaching composition. A brief but helpful one is Albert C. Yoder, "Dear Ann: I Have a Problem," in Writing Exercises from Exercise Exchange, ed. Littleton Long (Urbana, Ill.: National Council of Teachers of English, 1976, pp. 97-98. All About Letters, rev. ed. (Ur- bana, Ill.: National Council of Teachers of English, 1982), though not prepared for college students, nevertheless has some helpful information, including "Letters to Sample," a list "of the many books of and about letters" (pp. 59-64). In his Introductin to Familiar Let- ters on Important Occasions by Samuel Richardson, Brian W. Downs provides a seventeen- page overview of "the epistolary art" (New York: Dodd, Mead, 1928). I have not yet seen Janet Gurkin Altman's Epistolarity: Approaches to a Form (Columbus: Ohio State University Press, 1982). Susan Greenstein, "Dear Reader, Dear Friend: Richardson's Readers and the Social Response to Character," College English, 41 (1980), 524-34; E. Michael Walsh, "Teaching the Letter of Application," College Composition and Com- munication, 28 (1977), 374-76; and Mia Klein, "The Other Beauty of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s 'Letter from Birmingham Jail,"' College Composition and Communication, 32 (1981), 30-37, all provide some ideas pertinent for using personal letters in the classroom. Two recent texts which make brief but effective use of personal letter writing are Linda Woodson, From Cases to Composition (Glenview, Ill.: Scott, Foresman, 1982), pp.</page><page sequence="30">118 Rhetoric Review 239-42; and Erika Lindemann, A Rhetoric for Writing Teachers (New York: Oxford University Press, 1982), pp. 6-7. 15.

Larry's criticism is sound and Lori's words reflect good judgment, but Vicki's response to my letter is particularly helpful in demonstrating what is learnable from study- ing letter writing in ancient rhetoric. For centuries ago Demetrius accurately observed that "the man who utters sententious maxims and exhortations seems to be no longer talking familiarly in a letter but to be speaking from a pulpit"; cited in Clark, Rhetoric in Greco- Roman Education, p. 106. Bob Frye's special teaching interests are 18th-Century British Literature, Satire, and Rhetoric. He has edited the John Dryden MacFlecknoe in the Charles E. Merrill Literary Casebook Series. Most recently, he has read "The Satiric Angle of Vision: Art Buchwald's Tolerant Maledictions" at the Western Social Science Association Conference and in October 1982 taught at the Annual Conference of the National Collegiate Honors Council at the Univer- sity of New Mexico. Professor Frye has received several teaching awards, including the 1981 TCU AddRan College of Arts and Science Faculty Award for Excellence in Teaching and the 1981 TCU Honors Program Professor of the Year.
