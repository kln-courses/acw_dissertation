<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hic Jacet Robert Pogue Harrison In an interview with the German magazine Der Spiegel in 1966, Martin Heidegger declared that "only a god can save us," but I live in a part of the country where new houses and buildings are cropping up every- where-expensive ones at that-and hardly a day goes by that I don't think to myself, "only an architect can save us."' As a layperson I get the impression that a discrete catastrophe is taking place in America these days, the loss of the basic art of building. It seems that we can no longer design a simple, inoffensive home that does not somehow appear false, or erect a public edifice in which "truth of feature [is] related to truth of being," as Frank Lloyd Wright once expressed his wish for American architecture.2 The fracture between truth of feature and truth of being grows ever wider, for reasons that we can speculate about endlessly and probably not very fruitfully. Manfredo Tafuri believed that any substantial reforms in architecture would have to wait until after the existing social and economic structures of society have been overturned. Heidegger be- lieved that only a new epochal revelation of the sacred could alter the This essay originated as a talk delivered at the University of Virginia in October 1999.

Must we change our way of existing before we can change our way of building? Or would changing the way we build change the way we exist? Frankly it's undecidable. Yet if human being is a "being in the world," as Heidegger maintained, then nothing is more essential to our being than our building practices, given that the world into which we are thrown is always a built world. We take our measure of being from what surrounds us, and what surrounds us is always, to some extent, of our own making. Building, which starts from the ground up, is where the fundamental ontology of our mundane lives both begins and ends. The following essay engages one of the basic questions around which such an ontology inevitably revolves, that of place. What is a place? How does it get established? How does building define or articulate its where- withal? In what does its placehood consist? Much has been written about place of late, both by philosophers and historians of architecture, and while the literature is extremely good, some of it suffers from a lack of anthropological insight when it comes to identifying the ground on which places have traditionally been founded.3 I intend the term ground both literally and nonliterally. It is because places come into being through acts of human grounding that the term possesses its literal and nonliteral senses. The wherewithal of place does not preexist the act of building but is created by humanity's mark-its edified sign or signature-on the landscape. It is the substance of such marking that interests me here, for I believe it is impossible to understand the nature of place without taking into account the origin and founding power of that marking. Let me begin with an unproblematic proposition: A place is defined by its boundaries, its intrinsic limits, its distinctly local "here" that re- mains fixed in space even as it perdures in time. I follow with a slightly 3.

A wil- derness in itself is placeless, for it has no human center or point of conver- gence around which nature can gather and become bounded. Wallace Stevens's poem "Anecdote of the Jar" describes the minimal conditions of this sort of place-making: I placed ajar in Tennessee, And round it was, upon a hill. It made the slovenly wilderness Surround that hill. The wilderness rose up to it, And sprawled around, no longer wild. The jar was round upon the ground And tall and of a port in air. It took dominion everywhere. The jar was gray and bare. It did not give of bird or bush, Like nothing else in Tennessee.4 I would draw attention first of all to the way in which "a hill" in the second verse becomes "that hill" in the fourth, suggesting that the placement of the jar has established a horizon of reference for the demonstrative pronoun's deictic gesture. The jar is not a piece of architecture, properly speaking, yet it brings about the domestication of space that we associate with architecture's place-creating functions. Tamed by the object's pres- ence, the "slovenly wilderness" now "rises up to" and "surrounds" this center of orientation. The jar provides the surrounding nature with a measure of containment, of human containment, I would insist, by virtue of the fact that the object is man-made and has been placed there by a human being. It lies there as a kind of urn in the midst of the wilder- ness. The entire transfiguration of the scene of nature-its topical conver- gence in one place-is due to the introduction of this sign of human worldhood. That worldhood is defined above all by time. In The Ethical Function of Architecture Karsten Harries writes that "any view that understands ar- chitecture as the art of establishing place by the construction of bound- aries in space is inevitably one-sided. While dwelling requires the establishment of place, place must also be understood temporally."5 I would go even further and say that a place is where time, in its human 4.

A place cannot come into being without human time's intervention in nature's eternally self-renewing cycles-the cycles of "bird and bush," as it were. What intervenes in natural time is human finitude, which is unlike other finite things in that death claims our awareness before it claims our lives. We dwell in space, to be sure, but we dwell first and foremost within the limits of our mortality. When we build something in nature, be it a dwelling, a monument, or even a fire, we leave a sign there of our being mortal sojourners on the earth. The aboriginal sign of this mortality, of which Stevens's jar is a kind of everyday correlate, is the grave marker. It is not for nothing that the Greek word for sign, sema, is also the word for grave. For the Greeks the grave marker was not just one sign among others. It was a sign that signi- fied the source of signification itself, since it stood for what it stood in- the ground of burial as such. In its pointing to itself, or to its own mark in the ground, the sema effectively opened up the place of the "here," giving it that human foundation without which there would be no places in nature. In his book Statues: Le Second Livre des foundations, Michel Serres re- minds us that the archaic statue came into being as an anthropomorphic stele or the lapidary representative of the person who lay buried at the site of its erection. Indeed, in its earliest instantiations there was no such "representation" involved, since the first statue, according to Serres, was the mummified corpse itself. If "the cadaver and the mummy lie where their statue is raised," and if the latter bodies forth the figure of the for- mer, then the statue is indeed a sema in the full, multivalent Greek sense.6 Earlier I suggested that Stevens's jar lies in the Tennessee landscape like a kind of urn, to which I would now add that it stands there like a kind of primitive statue, not because it represents a deceased person or marks a grave in any explicit sense, but because in its createdness and deliberate placement on the hill it embodies the mortality of whoever forged it, placed it there, or recognizes it as the object it is, either in itself or in the poem that names it.7 I agree with Harries, David Kolb, Edward Casey, and others who have meditated in depth on this topic and concluded that no one has thought more radically and originally about the nature of place than Hei- degger, yet I believe that Heidegger's ontology is in need of some anthro- pology. This is especially true when it comes to his thinking about the conditions under which places come into being. For example, Heidegger speaks abstractly about the disclosure of the world in and through the Da 6. Michel Serres, Statues: Le Second Livre desfondations (Paris, 1987), p. 281. 7. I use the word embodies by way of allusion to Heidegger's short essay "Art and Space," Man and World 6 (1973): 3-8, in which he claims that sculpture, even more primordially than architecture, "embodies" (verkirpert) places by localizing space and figuring the site of human habitation.</page><page sequence="5">Critical Inquiry Spring 2001 397 of Dasein, but surely the Da is first opened, and subsequently kept open, by the institutional order, about which Heidegger has next to nothing to say.8 And surely Giambattista Vico (a true anthropological philosopher or philosophical anthropologist) was right to consider burial of the dead one of the three "universal institutions" of humanity, along with religion and matrimony.9 What does burial have to do with Dasein's place? In what way does the enclosure of the tomb open its Da? Serres remarks that the term etre-la could be said to transcribe in another idiom the phrase ci-git, or "here lies," which one finds on old French tombstones.'0 The Italian for "here lies"-qui giace-is even closer to the Latin matrix of this tombstone deixis: hicjacet. If one wanted to speak Heideggerese, one could say that the hic of hic jacet is the aboriginal Da that grounds Dasein's situatedness and historicizes its being in the world, especially since jacet alludes to the finite temporality that Dasein makes its own in its so-called being-unto- death. In any case the hic of hicjacet is no ordinary locative adverb. It is an indicator that appropriates the ground of indication, drawing a boundary of belonging around it. It is a shifter that refuses to shift. In its always pointing to the same place, it marks that persistent finitude that underlies the placehood of place and pervades the Da of Dasein. No hu- man words need be inscribed on the tombstone. A crude gravepost is sufficient to indicate this mortal hic or "here." In his 1939 essay on the meaning of physis in Aristotle's Physics, Hei- degger talks about the deeper commonality that underlies the difference between the two terms by which the Greeks thought and named the be- ingness of being: hypokeimenon and hypostasis. The former means literally that which lies under. Its Latin equivalent is subjectum, literally that which is thrown under. The latter term-hypostasis-means that which stands on its own. Its Latin equivalent is substantia. Heidegger claims that while to lie and to stand are quite opposite, "only what stands can fall and thus lie; and only what lies can be put upright and thus stand.""I I would insist that there is at least one case in which this dialectic fails, namely, in the case of the dead. The dead cannot "be put upright and thus stand," ex- cept vicariously, as when their statues, for example, are erected on the ground under which they lie. Be that as it may, if Heidegger can get away with saying that "both [hypokeimenon and hypostasis] have equal weight, for in both cases the Greeks have one and the same thing in view: being- present of and by itself, presencing," then perhaps I can get away with 8.

To speak once again in Heideggerese, Dasein can inhabit its Da only because the Da is preinhabited by those who came before. The essence of human "subjec- tivity" may well consist in such preinhabitation. And perhaps even human "understanding," in its analytic and synthetic modes, derives from the same underlying source. It is, I believe, impossible to understand the institution of places on the earth independently of the institution of burial. For what is a place if not its memory of itself-a place where time reflects back upon itself? The grave marks a site in the landscape where time cannot merely pass through, or pass over. Time must now gather around the sema and mor- talize itself. It is this mortalization of time that gives place its articulated boundaries, distinguishing it from the infinity of homogeneous space. As the sign of human mortality, the grave domesticates the inhuman tran- scendence of space and marks human time off from the timelessness of the gods and the eternal returns of nature. That is why gods are not the original founders of place. Mortals are. An immortal god may bless a place that has already been founded, but such a god cannot introduce the mark of finite time necessary to ground it. Let us listen to what the historian Walter Burkert has to say about the difference between the cult of heroes and the cult of gods in ancient Greece: An important difference between the hero cult and the cult of the gods is that a hero is always confined to a specific locality: he acts in the vicinity of his grave for his family, group or city. The bond with a hero is dissolved by distance... .In the newly established colonial cities, the founder generally becomes the Hero Ktistes who is often buried in the market place. In this way the new land is immediately given a centre which, even if not from a greater past, nevertheless symbolizes the good fortune and obligations that flow from the new beginning. 13 The hero's burial here performs the function of Stevens's jar in that it provides the newly inhabited land with a center, makes of it a proper place. A god cannot do this. The city of Athens had in Athena its protec- tive goddess, but even Athens needed the presence of Oedipus's grave in its vicinity to assure its founding and good fortune into the future. The cult of heroes to which Burkert refers in this passage is more ancient in 12. Ibid. 13. Walter Burkert, Greek Religion, trans. John Raffan (Cambridge, 1988), pp. 206-7.</page><page sequence="7">Critical Inquiry Spring 2001 399 origin than the cult of the gods. It goes back to the very earliest worship of the Indo-Europeans, to a time when people venerated their own ances- tors and when the only gods who existed were domestic, mortal gods.14 Let me put forward another proposition here, to the effect that places are not only founded but are also appropriated by burial of the dead. The Sicilian Baron in one of Luigi Pirandello's stories is no doubt a savvy realist when he stubbornly refuses to allow his peasants to bury their dead on his land, fearing they would promptly come to believe that the land belonged to them by natural right.'5 The surest way to take pos- session of a place and secure it as one's own is to bury one's dead in it. Consider in this regard the controversy that erupted in Israel a few years ago between religious leaders and Jewish archaeologists who were disin- terring ancient Hebrew graves. Jewish religious law holds the profanation of graves a sacrilege; hence the rabbis were demanding an end to the excavations. The archaeologists, in turn, argued that the more evidence they could uncover confirming that Jews had been buried there in an- cient times, the more it would legitimate Israel's claim to its territories. The rabbis responded with a devastating logic: by attempting to legiti- mate the claim, the diggers were violating its basis. The establishment of belonging through burial has origins that go back into the night of time. Vico-the Neapolitan to whom my work is most indebted-speaks of homo humandi and holds that our early an- cestors first humanized themselves through burial of their dead. In his New Science he declares that these primitive "giants" would point to the wooden graveposts of their forefathers to indicate their ground of be- longing, hence their ownership of the land: "Thus by the graves of their buried dead the giants showed dominion over their lands, and Roman law called for burial of the dead in a proper place to make it religious. With truth they could pronounce these heroic phrases: we are sons of this earth, we are born from these oaks."'6 The pronouns-"this earth," "these oaks"--demonstrate possession of the hic in and through their ges- ture of pointing. Such was the giants' natural language. Vico calls them giants in the sense that they were "sons of this earth" who descended from buried ancestors whose place in the ground they could point to as their own. Vico is probing the earliest origins of the ancient house, which was not merely a place of residence but an institution that linked the living to the dead, the dead to the unborn, and the family to its native ground. 14.

The crux of this masterpiece of classical philology is the claim (abun- dantly substantiated) that the ancient city was built on the foundations of the ancient house, and that the ancient house was built in turn upon the ancestor's grave. Fustel de Coulanges, who boasted of having read every word in Greek and Latin that had come down to his age from antiquity, claimed that every Greek and Roman house featured an altar on which burned a sacred fire that was to remain perpetually lit and that the occu- pants identified with their domestic gods, that is to say, their buried fore- bears. Indeed, there is even evidence suggesting that the dead were sometimes placed inside these altars, hence that the house was literally and figuratively erected upon their tombs, forming a sort of mausoleum around them. We will never know to what extent Fustel de Coulanges's specific claims are historically exact, yet there is little doubt that the an- cient house, and in its turn the ancient city, were founded upon such sep- ulchers.'7 Unless we understand the binding terms of this genealogical contract between the living and the dead, we will never understand the heavy burden of Aeneas, leader of the Trojan refugees and mythical founder of Rome. After the destruction of Troy, Aeneas was entrusted with the re- sponsibility of transporting the House of Troy from one land to another so as to save the house itself. More exactly, he was charged with carrying the ancestral gods of his family to a new home. In a dramatic passage of The Aeneid, the ghost of the dead Hector appears to Aeneas in a vision to give him instruction: 'Ah, goddess-born, take flight [cries Hector] and snatch yourself out of these flames. The enemy has gained the walls; Troy falls from her high peak. Our home, our Priam-these have had their due: could Pergamus be saved by any prowess, then my hand would have served. But Troy entrusts her holy things and household gods to you; take them away as comrades of your fortunes, seek out for them the great walls that at last, once you have crossed the sea, you will establish.' So Hector speaks; then from the inner altars he carries out the garlands and great Vesta and, in his hands, the fire that never dies.'8 17.

Allen Mandelbaum (New York, 1972), 2.285-95, p. 39.</page><page sequence="9">Critical Inquiry Spring 2001 401 The household gods, or Penates, live on in that fire that never dies, except once a year, when it is ceremoniously extinguished and rekindled. To save the House of Troy and preserve its continuity in time, Aeneas must not only relocate the Penates to a new land, he must also domesticate the terra nova by interring his people there. The Aeneid is punctuated by such ritual burials. Aeneas buries his father Anchises in Sicily; Palinurus he buries at the bottom of the mainland; Misenus he buries near Cumae; his nursemaid Gaeta he buries at Gaeta, a hundred miles south of the future imperial city. Each one of those sites becomes in its turn a place in Rome's future history. In this retrospective epic of Rome's founding-all the more revealing insofar as its mythic burials are retrospective-Virgil makes of Aeneas a tamer of the Italian peninsula, a hero who founds places in its wilderness by giving them the names of those whom he buries there. It is as if, by planting his dead at various sites as he makes his way up the coast, he lays the ground for Rome's future claims on those terri- tories. It is not only places, then, but also nations and empires that repose on such human-call them humic-foundations. And lest we think that this claim relies on ancient myth and outdated French philology, we have only to look at the founding of a modern, "enlightened" nation like the United States of America. The American republic, we're told, is founded upon its Constitution. But how does or how must the Constitution ground itself upon that continent where its otherwise abstract, universal- izing laws are supposed to apply? For it is one thing to frame a Constitu- tion. It is quite another to give it a grounding that will secure the place of its authority. At a critical moment in American history, when the nation was divided over the issue of slavery, Abraham Lincoln realized that the Constitution needed to be rescued by those who, in coming to the rescue, would decide the fate of its authority. He realized, in other words, that the nation's founding scripture was in need of a refounding that the scrip- ture itself could not provide: Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long en- dure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate-we can not conse- crate-we can not hallow-this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remem-</page><page sequence="10">402 Robert Pogue Harrison Hic Jacet ber what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining be- fore us-that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave their last full measure of devotion- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain-that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of free- dom-and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth. Emerson's "Experience" opens with a question to his countrymen: "Where do we find ourselves?"'9 To this haunting, deeply American query, Lincoln at Gettysburg replies: hic. The word "here" occurs a full eight times in his brief address. In each case it points to the ground-"this ground"-to which the matryrs and victims of the nation's contradiction, its civil war, have been consigned. A discrete grammatical break- through-from "that nation" at the beginning of the address to "this na- tion" at the end-indicates that the securement of the nation's hic has taken place, precisely through the sepulchering act of the address itself. The Latin word sepulcrum comes from sepelire, which means to bury but which has an Indo-European root that means "to render honor." The historical irony of Lincoln's speech is that, had it not been for its honoring gesture, the world would not much have noted what happened at Gettys- burg. In other words, it does not suffice to bury the dead. As I stressed earlier, it is also necessary to mark that burial. In this case Lincoln's ad- dress is the sema, or grave marker. Its speech act makes of that ground a place or the place where the nation finds itself, on which it must found, or refound, its republic. Not only in their sacrificial deaths, but above all in their ritual sepulture, the remembered dead enable the nation to make its own the continent on which it first came forth. The "here" in Lincoln's speech is where nation and continent come together on that plot of "earth" from which "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish." Henceforth the continent becomes a veritable place, a place where the idea of America can take root geographically. Yet the most important place secured in Lincoln's address is perhaps that of the nation's time. Its hic does not only mark a geographical "here" but also a historical "now": "Four score and seven years ago.... Now we are engaged in a great civil war. .. ." The speech locates the nation's place in time, in an ongoing, critical history, at a moment of decision about whether such a nation can temporally perdure. America, in short, needs a place to take place historically. That place is not only upon the earth of "this continent" but also in the hearts of those who would assure, through 19.

Edward Waldo Emerson (Boston, 1903), p. 45.</page><page sequence="11">Critical Inquiry Spring 2001 403 their rededication to the cause for which the dead here have died, that the idea of America shall endure, that this hic shall henceforth be the place where history, geography, and the Constitution intersect.20 To these reflections I would add the following reminder: such foun- dational acts are never completely primordial. Latium was not an inhu- man wilderness when Aeneas arrived there. Far from it. The second half of The Aeneid tells of the Trojans' wars with and against the indigenous inhabitants of the new land. Likewise with the American continent. Ste- vens's poem about the jar may seem like an allegory of place-founding in the midst of a wilderness-I even read it as such-but we can't overlook the fact that the speaker "placed a jar in Tennessee," that there was al- ready a place there in which to place the jar. The place name itself, Ten- nessee, speaks of this indigenous prehabitation. As Thoreau wanders through the so-called wilds of New England, he finds arrowheads every- where in the soil. We are all latecomers, even those of us who believe we are firstcomers. The ground in which we lay the dead to rest has always already received the bones of others-"others" in the most radical sense of the term, including those of other species, many of whom who have died on our behalf and at our hand. So far my claims about the foundation of place have drawn mostly on the archives of our cultural past. I now turn my attention to the pres- ent and then, by way of conclusion, consider how all this might relate to the concerns and vocation of architecture. If cultural memory has a future, which at present seems doubtful, the twentieth century will one day be remembered as the fitful and prolonged continuation of a process that began in earnest a century earlier: the end- ing of the neolithic era. Throughout this era, which got underway with the domestication of animals and discovery of agriculture, the great ma- jority of human beings lived and toiled on the land where their ancestors were interred, where they and their children and their children's children would also be interred. This is no longer the case in Western societies. For the first time in millennia, most of us don't know where we will be buried, assuming we will be buried at all. The likelihood that it will be alongside any of our progenitors becomes increasingly remote. From a historical or sociological point of view, this is astounding. Uncertainty as 20. For a directly relevant discussion of how the intersections of geography, ideology, and history give rise to what he calls "holy landscapes," see W. J. T. Mitchell, "Holy Land- scape: Israel, Palestine, and the American Wilderness," Critical Inquiry 26 (Winter 2000): 193-223. At the end of his essay Mitchell refers to "the fantasies of the destiny of Judaism as the possession of a physical place, rather than as an ideal of universal human value. This fantasy has now been realized in an idolatry of place, a territorial mysticism enforced by bullets and bulldozers. The challenge is to sound out this idolatry, to unbind its fascination" (p. 223). From the point of view of my essay, the challenge is to avoid the idolatry of place while holding on to the placehood of place.</page><page sequence="12">404 Robert Pogue Harrison Hic Jacet to one's posthumous abode would have been unthinkable to the vast ma- jority of people a few generations ago. Nothing speaks quite so eloquently of the loss of place in the postneolithic era as this uncertainty. It goes hand in hand with another indeterminacy that until recently would have been equally unthinkable for the majority. Most of us have no idea where the food we eat comes from. We are oblivious of the fields that yield our grain, the gardens our vegetables sprout in, the orchards where our fruits are gathered. We are not familiar with the individual animals we eat: we do not tend to them, we do not watch them grow, we don't know what flock they came from or on which pastures they grazed, and above all we have no hand in their sacrifice. The daily holocausts that supply the world markets' demands for meat, fish, and poultry take place in another world than the one most of us inhabit. And yet we live off such holocausts, inevitably. The fact that so many of today's children have never seen a cow is not necessarily a problem for the cows, but some of us would say it's a problem nonetheless. Milk remains more or less the same substance whether we know where it comes from or not, but when a staggering proportion of first-world children respond to the question, "Where does milk come from?" with answers to the effect that "It comes from the car- ton," or, in the case of meat, "It comes from the supermarket," there is reason to believe that more is at stake here than urban distantiation from the conditions of food production. Origins are in some ultimate sense unknowable, yet there is a difference between not knowing where life in its original impulse comes from and not knowing where milk comes from. When the "from" of the things we consume becomes not only remote but essentially unreal, the world we live in draws a veil over the earth we live on-a veil that obscures not only the source of our foodstuffs but also of our relation to the earth, namely our death, insofar as the earth is both our unde, or "from," as well as our quo, or "whereto." Uncertainty about the provenance of one's food and the destination of one's corpse relate to one another not accidentally but essentially. Both are the consequence of a singleminded effort undertaken by the West in the last few centuries to emancipate ourselves, by whatever means neces- sary, from our millennial bondage to the land and our servitude to the dead. Who can blame us for striving for this emancipation? The sweat and tears of untold generations-an ocean of them-have gone into our labors. We have worked the earth to death and borne the curse of our earthbound race in every way imaginable. We have suffered endless hard- ships and indignities in the name of our obligations to the dead and the land. Haven't we paid our dues several times over? Don't we have the right to settle, once and for all, our debts with the dead, with the earth, even with God, if it comes to that? This remains to be seen. A genuine modernity or postneolithic free- dom would consist in a genuine settlement of this sort, but we are not</page><page sequence="13">Critical Inquiry Spring 2001 405 genuinely modern, and for the most part we have presumed to settle our debts merely by disowning them. Certainly no amount of emancipation, be it through mechanized food production, technological innovation, or genetic engineering, can absolve us from the "substance" of our human- ity, regardless of whether biomedical science succeeds in finding ways to prolong human life indefinitely. Endless prolongation of life does not amount to absolution. Mortality is absolved only by the lucid reappropria- tion of its condition. The destruction of place that is occuring almost ev- erywhere at present, and that has been occuring for some time now, is linked, at least in part, to an anxious and even frenzied flight from death. We are running away from ourselves, not so much in the sense that we are forsaking or destroying our traditional homelands but in the sense that we are forsaking or destroying the places where our dying is at home. In his interview with Der Spiegel, during which he asserted that "only a god can save us" from the nihilism that is uprooting us from the earth, Heidegger declared: "We do not need atomic bombs at all [to uproot us]-the uprooting of man is already here. All our relationships have be- come merely technical ones. It is no longer upon an earth that man lives today" ("0," p. 56). These are the kind of solemn pronouncements that render Heidegger so irksome to many people. Certainly he managed to annoy his urbanite interviewers over the course of their long interview. Well-prepared and in no way intimidated by the philosopher's lofty stat- ure, they responded to Heidegger's lament with the following challenge: Spiegel: Well, we have to say that indeed we prefer to be here [on the earth], and in our age we surely will not have to leave for elsewhere. But who knows if man is determined to be upon this earth? It is thinkable that man has absolutely no determination at all. After all, one might see it to be one of man's possibilities that he reach out from this earth toward other planets. We have by no means come that far, of course-but where is it written that he has his place here? ["0," p. 57] This is the most crucial "philosophical" question posed by the interview- ers during the entire interview, for it goes to the heart of Heidegger's faith in the ontological relationality between "man" and the earth, indeed, his faith that Being, in the final analysis, is nothing other than this relational- ity. Heidegger answered awkwardly enough: "As far as my own orienta- tion goes, in any case, I know that, according to our human experience and history, everything essential and of great magnitude has arisen only out of the fact that man had a home and was rooted in a tradition" ("O0," p. 57). There is something feeble about the response, not only because the talk of "home" and "tradition" smacks of Swabian provincialism, but also because Heidegger, who had nothing but contempt for all forms of empiricism throughout his career, invokes his personal "orientation" and</page><page sequence="14">406 Robert Pogue Harrison Hic Jacet appeals, very uncharacteristically, to the authority of "experience and history," as if avowing that the faith that underlies his philosophy cannot be justified on philosophical grounds. If it is indeed the case that no such justification is possible, then the statement that effectively culminates the interview-"only a god can save us"-appears, if not inevitable, then at least coherent. Such a god would presumably save our connection to the earth and thus save "man" from the homelessness, or indetermination of nature, posited by the interviewers' question. I would have answered the interviewers somewhat differently or, in any case, more anthropologically. To begin with, I would have pointed out that it is in the earth itself that it is "written" that we have our "place here." Dig up its fossils, unearth its graves, excavate its cities, and read the scripts for yourselves. They all say the same thing: hicjacet. To this I would have added that it may well be the case that man, in his species be- ing, is not determined to be upon the earth, but that the same cannot be said for humanity. Humanity is not a species. As Vico reminds us, and as the word's etymon itself indicates, it is a connection with the humus. The Neanderthals belonged to a different species than us, yet the fact that they buried their dead is evidence enough that their mode of being was human. If one day we colonize other worlds then we might be able to say, empirically and definitively, that man was not determined to be upon this earth after all. But such a man, when and if he comes to exist, will no longer be human, at least not in the sense in which Vico talked of homo humandi, or in which his giants pointed to "this earth" and "these oaks" as their place of belonging. If Heidegger is right that "philosophy will be unable to effect any immediate change in the current state of the world" or offset in any way the "world movement ... that is bringing about an absolutely technical state"-a state divorced but not free from the earth-the same cannot or need not be said for architecture, which determines the concrete config- uration of our life worlds ("O," p. 57). When I declared at the outset that only an architect can save us, I was being only half-facetious, for architecture has it within its power to house our mortality, and, in so doing, to re-place the jar in our postneolithic habitat. Architecture not only reflects but pragmatically shapes our modes of being in the world. We build who we are. We edify ourselves. I would hope that we need not wait for a global revolution or the advent of a god before we can rehu- manize the fundamental ontology of our building practices. I would like to believe that our dying is accessible to us at any moment and that we can build or rebuild upon that basis here and now. For as long as we think of our houses, cities, and nations as merely places to live, and not as places to die, those houses, cities, and nations can never become homes or reside within the containing limits of mortality from which all shelter and placehood ultimately derive. I see no reason why architecture, for all its past deliquencies, could</page><page sequence="15">Critical Inquiry Spring 2001 407 not lead the way to a fully modern redemption of our debt to the earth and hence to a new economy of habitation. Such an architecture would take its measure from our humic natures rather than from the empty expanse of a false transcendence-false in the sense in which earlier I wrote of our false modernity. We do not need an architecture of the milk carton that poses as the origin of its contents but an architecture of the cow, as it were, which brings to bear in its lineaments and materials the unde and the quo of life itself. Its buildings must not only rise from but also redescend into the ground of their edification. They must not only stand there but also lie there. In short, we need an architecture not so much of the humanistic (in the grand modernist sense) as of the humic. I would expect a humic architecture of this sort to be palpably haunted by the earth in which the existential and historical past ulti- mately come to rest. By that I do not mean that it should be funereal, commemorative, or self-consciously pious toward the has-been, but that its buildings should sink into and emerge out of the recesses of mortal time, especially the underworld of the dead, in which the spirit of place ultimately resides. If a house, a building, or a city is not in some sense haunted in its architectural features-if the earth's placed historicity and containment of the dead do not visibly pervade its articulated forms and constitutive matter-then that house, building, or city is dead to the world. Dead to the world means cut off from from the earth and closed off from the dead. For that is one of the ironies of our life worlds: they receive their animation from the ones that underlie them.</page></plain_text>
