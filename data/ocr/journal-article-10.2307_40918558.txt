<plain_text><page sequence="1">Per Thomas Andersen. Stein Mehren- en logos-dikter . Aschenhoug, Oslo, 1982. Pp. 282. Those who have tried to read Stein Mehren's poetry know that it is difficult and at times obscure; they also recognize the presence of a meditative temperament at home with philosophical ideas. Sometimes reviewers and critics are turned off by Mehren for these reasons, or because of his frequently deplored symbolistic diction. To the extent that this negative response to Mehren's work is rooted in ignorance of his poetic intentions, Per Thomas Andersen's book should serve to change the reader's and critic's preconceptions and to facilitate a less superficial reaction to the work of this important Norwegian poet. Andersen's central argument is that Mehren's entire oeuvre is the vehicle of a philosophical-religious quest. This quest begins in the early 1960s, at which time Mehren's poetry exhibits a skeptical mood that verges on solipsism: the conviction that, in trying to express reality through language, "we merely grasp the duplication of our own conscious- ness" (p. 43). This predicament results in a sense of estrangement from nature and the world. Significantly, the first part of Andersen's book, dealing with Mehren's struggle to overcome this untenable position, is titled "A Stranger" ("En fremmed," pp. 3 1- 125). The second part, titled "The Shepherd" ("Hyrden," pp. 127-261), expounds the book's thesis: namely, that from the 1970s on Mehren is a "poet of logos" whose cognitive concept of the imagination makes possible a new sense of unity between man and nature. The problem confronted by Mehren can be traced back to the inception of modern philosophy, Specifically to the Cartesian dualism of res extensa and res cogitans, along with the distinction between primary and secondary qualities, objective and "real" and subjective and "unreal," respectively. This distinction destroyed the classical-mediaeval concept of a cosmos in which man, the microcosm, mirrored the macrocosm in the realm of both types of qualities. Once the unity was broken, the function of the imagination became a purely subjective one: either of beautifying some piece of practical wisdom or of creating realms of pure fancy. The Romantic philosophers, especially Schelling, tried to break down the presumed wall between our consciousness and reality, a barrier that had been reinforced through Kant's Critique of Pure Reason. After the breakdown of philo- sophical idealism by the middle of the nineteenth century and the triumph of positivism, empirical science moves into the position formerly held by philosophy in our culture, and with psychology now claiming to be a scientific discipline, psychologism becomes a dominant trend in philosophical thinking: cognition is reduced to a function of sense data and is studied like "psychological reactions in the human apparatus of perception" (p. 75). Naturally, under such circumstances, the real nature of the object of perception becomes inaccessible. Psychologism of this kind was still an influential philosophical trend at the time when Mehren (b. 1935) was coming to maturity. Andersen shows how he gradually overcame his estrangement and solipsism through acquaintance with the thinking of the phenomenolo- gists and existentialists, such as Husserl and Buber. He stresses in particular the importance</page><page sequence="2">348 Scandinavian Studies of Husserl's notion of intentionality. But he also points out the independent operation of a mystical component in Mehren's creative disposition and uses a chapter in Evelyn Under- bill's work Mysticism ("Mysticism and Symbolism**) as a means of understanding some of the themes in Mehren's collection Aurora det niende merke (1969). Interestingly, Andersen believes that the German mystic Jacob BÃ¶hme significantly influenced Mehren's work at this juncture, though he admits that the existing similarities are largely due to "spiritual and intellectual affinity" (p. 1 15). Mehren's new world is a "living cosmos," an "animated" (besjelet) world, not only in the sense of a "literary trope but as a direct perception of the essence of nature Nature is qualitatively not totally different from man." It only lacks one thing, "namely a voice, a language, knowledge." It is in man, and chiefly through "the human voice, the word," that nature "comes to consciousness of itself. In this way man [mennesket] is the shepherd of nature" (pp. 123-24). Andersen emphasizes how important it is to be aware of Mehren's transcendental esthetic, with its close resemblance to Schelling's philosophy of identity. Only through such awareness will the critic be able to avoid the mistake of automatically perceiving Mehren's "animations" and "personifications" as "anthropomorphic projec- tions"; in actuality, they spring from the postulated reciprocal relationship between subject and object in the act of cognition (p. 123). Mehren's "use of metaphor, the wealth of images, and the elaboration of poetic myths in his art are not merely fortuitous features of his usage of literary effects" (p. 249). Mehren's mystical concept of the imagination envisages the latter as a "power of redemption" that belongs to nature "in the form of human consciousness" (p. 249). The implied notion of the poet, as elucidated by Andersen, is an awesome one. His artistic task is a "project of redemption" (p. 246) through the word, logos in the Johannine sense of the word. This redemption has two aspects. On the one hand, the "poet's song ... redeems the mute longing of nature and leads "nature out of the darkness' It also redeems man in his relationship to nature," to which he returns "as a shepherd in a transcendental perspective" (p. 258). To what extent Mehren's poetry accomplishes what it allegedly sets out to do is another question, one that Anderson does not try to answer. Andersen's approach is purely analytical; he does not appraise the quality of the poetry he cites to illustrate and support his argument. Such an evaluation was no part of his intention. But there is no doubt that Andersen's lucid, informed, and sympathetic exploration of Mehren's philo- sophical struggle, and of his attempt to shape a new Weltanschauung more congenial to humanistic and artistic concerns, will be indispensable to any future critic endeavoring to assess Mehren's achievement as a poet.
