<plain_text><page sequence="1">Foreign Policy in a Presidential Democracy THEODORE C. SORENSEN In view of the very different kinds of democracy, very different levels of presidential authority, and very different kinds of foreign policy decision making in this world, it would be presumptuous to attempt to generalize about foreign policy making in any and all presidential democracies. Instead I am speaking here exclusively about making foreign policy in America's presidential democracy. "Presidential and parliamentary democracies - which work best?" To me the parliamentary system appears to work best in smaller, less diverse countries than the United States - countries where both the public and the politicians are familiar with the history and practice of parliamentary rule, where the states are creatures of the national government, where centralized national parties can discipline errant legislators, and where senior civil servants can largely govern the minis- tries. None of these conditions is likely to prevail in the United States. I have no confidence that the power to bring the executive branch down with a legislative vote of "no confidence" would produce any- thing but utter confusion in this country. I have no question that requiring the president to appear before a televised session of the House for questioning on, for example, his tax proposal would be far less valuable than the Ways and Means Committee grilling the secretary THEODORE C. SORENSEN is an attorney, an author, and was special counsel to President John F. Kennedy. Political Science Quarterly Volume 109 Number 3 Special Issue 1994 515</page><page sequence="2">516 | POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY of the Treasury on that proposal. I have no evidence that merging the legislative and executive branches in this country, requiring all members of both branches to stand for office simultaneously, would raise the level of integrity or efficiency in either branch. But I have no doubt that the separation of legislative and executive powers in this particular presidential democracy imposes additional, though not insuperable, obstacles to our president's effective foreign policy leadership, obstacles that may not confront the prime minister in a parliamentary democracy. In theory and appearance, the president under our system of separa- tion of powers has almost unlimited initiative and influence in foreign affairs. * President Harry Truman sent troops to Korea, President Dwight Eisenhower sent troops to Lebanon, President John F. Kennedy dis- patched a naval blockade around Cuba, President Lyndon B. Johnson dispatched combat troop divisions to Vietnam, President Ronald Reagan invaded Grenada, President George Bush sent troops to Panama and Saudi Arabia, all without specific authorization - much less a declara- tion of war-from Congress. The president alone is commander in chief of our armed forces. His finger alone is on the nuclear button. * The president appoints the secretary of State, secretary of Defense, and director of Central Intelligence, all of their subordinates, and ambassadors around the world; he receives secret briefings and cables from them, meets in private with foreign ambassadors, ministers, and heads of state. Thus he is the only officer in government who can act quickly, decisively, unilaterally, and if necessary secretly. * To be sure, on the margins, and after long delays, Congress can deter and delay and retard a president's actions, amend them, dilute them, and eventually financially restrict or starve them; but little more. In virtually every judicial test of their competing influence in foreign affairs, the courts have held that it is the president, not the Congress (and not the court itself), who holds most of the cards. But, in fact, presidential power in foreign affairs is far from absolute. Every modem president must contend with three rival sources of power: the power of the Congress; the power of public opinion; and the power of the press, particularly television. How each president handles each of those three rivals for influence will largely determine the success or failure of his foreign policy.</page><page sequence="3">MAKING FOREIGN POLICY | 517 THE POWER OF CONGRESS It is real power - including the power to establish new foreign policy agencies and abolish old ones, to withhold confirmation from the president's foreign policy appointees, to confer additional powers on those appointees or remove existing power from them, to investigate every agency, action, and crisis, subpoena State Department officials, and cite them for contempt if they refuse to testify. Congress can reject, ignore, or amend the president's request for funds and au- thority, impose conditions he does not like, withhold funds he needs, prevent ratification of his treaties, hamstring his use of the armed forces, and in short, over time and with difficulty, halt virtually any presidential activity it wishes to halt. A generation ago and earlier, congressional leaders largely deferred to or worked harmoniously with the president and secretary of State to advance America's role in the world, even during those periods under Truman and Eisenhower when one or both Houses of Congress were controlled by the opposition party. Even in my days in the White House, Kennedy was able simply to inform congressional leaders about his responses to the Berlin and Cuban crises. But each of his successors too often found his foreign policy initiatives blocked, undermined, or substantially altered by Congress, even during periods when one or both Houses of Congress were controlled by the president's party. For almost three decades, our presidents and secretaries of State have carefully negotiated commitments to other countries - arms control initiatives, military assistance, economic assistance, trade and tax agree- ments - commitments that they believed the national interest required, only to see Congress water them down or wash them out. You might think that a great power unable to fulfill its commitments would not long be respected or trusted by other nations. But, as presidential counsel Lloyd Cutler said: We are the only major nation whose head of government cannot commit the government he heads. Remember how the government of Panama was required in effect to renegotiate the canal treaties with the United States Senate? How the government of Saudi Arabia, to obtain AWAC aircraft, had to provide separate assurances not to the Defense Department but to the Senate? Forty years ago, Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson and House Speaker Sam Rayburn could bargain with Eisenhower on Lebanon or Formosa and deliver majorities in Congress to uphold their side of the bargain. But the greater distrust of presidential discretion and</page><page sequence="4">518 | POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY secrecy that grew out of our plunge into Vietnam and Watergate, combined with the steadily declining hold of our political parties on their congressional members, has substantially changed that picture. George Mitchell and Thomas Foley cannot deliver much of anyone on foreign policy issues today. As one member of Congress said, "Ev- erybody's a Secretary of State around here. . . . You get a kick out of meddling in foreign policy."' A prime example of this legislative micromanagement is the now customary addition of more than a hundred individual exceptions and restrictions on each president's foreign assistance program. Microman- agement, it's called. And yet it is clear that Congress itself cannot manage foreign policy. 535 members of the House and Senate, each representing a different local constituency, cannot - however wise and experienced -match the presidency in exercising foreign policy initia- tive, discretion, direction, and implementation. We cannot have, as one U.S. diplomat believes we now have, "535 ants sitting on a log floating down a turbulent river, each one thinking he's steering."2 That number may be exaggerated, but at least seventy-five separately motivated legislators today do exercise substantial influence over for- eign policy decisions. As a result, special interest groups, ethnic lobbyists, and ideological organizations, often backed by political campaign contributions, now exercise great influence on issues of trade, military assistance, and economic development. Congress now sends its own observers to inter- national negotiations. Individual members meet not only with heads of state but also with leaders of the political opposition and even rebel movements as well. Responsibility has spread from the once all-powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee to a dozen or more other committees. Twenty years ago, a Middle East oil embargo pro- duced separate legislative hearings in forty separate congressional sub- committees, most of them producing their own inconsistent "emer- gency" proposals to cope with the embargo long after the emergency had ended. Even within these committees, seniority counts for less. Chairpersons have less power. Congressional party leaders have less influence. Congressional staffs are large and more assertive. The result is confusion, equivocation, inconsistency, and delay. I Quoted in Theodore C. Sorensen, A Different Kind of Presidency (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1984), 22. 2 Margot Hornblower, "Hill Activism in Foreign Policy Process Continuing, Reagan Finds," Washington Post, 2 April 1983.</page><page sequence="5">MAKING FOREIGN POLICY | 519 But in truth, Congress was designed to bring about delay, not dis- patch; to operate with maximum publicity, not secrecy; to respond to local interests, not national ones. Congress can deliberate, investi- gate, and educate - but it is ill-suited to initiative, much less effectuate. What, then, can a president do successfully to preserve leadership in foreign policy? Certainly it is clear what the president cannot do successfully. First, every president, and Bill Clinton is no exception, tries to appeal over the heads of Congress, hoping their constituents will apply the necessary pressure. These efforts rarely succeed. Most members of Congress feel they were elected regardless of the presiden- tial ticket, and they feel relatively immune to pressures and indifferent to commitments. Most of them had very little to do with his nomination or campaign, and in fact hardly know him. Unlike prime ministers who come from the ranks of parliament, only one sitting member of Congress (JFK) has been elected president during the last seventy years, and only two others (Barry Goldwater and George McGovern) were even nominated by major parties. Second, some presidents try to get their way in foreign policy by excluding Congress, utilizing covert operations, secret diplomatic mis- sions, the over-classification of documents, and the concentration of foreign policy decision making not in the State Department, whose leaders are subject to Senate confirmation and congressional testi- mony, but in the White House national security adviser's office, which is subject to neither. But that approach excludes not only the Congress but also the press, the public, the democratic principle of public con- sent, and ultimately the indispensable ingredient known as public con- fidence. Members of Congress resented it when, in his role as national security adviser, Henry Kissinger had all the authority but they were confined to taking testimnony from Secretary of State William Rogers. As one senator put it: "They've given Rogers Norway and Malagasy, and Kissinger is in charge of Russia, China and anything else he wants."3 Third, each of our last several presidents has attempted to win con- gressional support by invoking the spirit of a bipartisan foreign policy, eloquent appeals to national unity that basically call for supporting the president. We had a bipartisan foreign policy in the 1940s, but for the last three decades it has largely been a myth - an abstract concept selectively invoked by each president in need of support and conve- niently forgotten by his party once it returned to the opposition role, I Quoted in Theodore C. Sorensen, Watchmen in the Night (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1975), 97.</page><page sequence="6">520 | POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY a game in which each party hopes to pin responsibility on the other for some future disaster or current impasse, an artifice by which con- troversial decisions can be avoided or obscured. As president, Gerald Ford once told Congress, in urging their sup- port with a somewhat inaccurate recollection of his own record: "I have [as a Congressman] upheld all our presidents when they spoke for my country to the world. I believe the Constitution commands this."4 No, the Constitution commands no such thing. It contemplates debate and dissent on all issues, including foreign affairs. It envisions power as the rival of power, whatever friction and inefficiency resulted, to preclude, as Justice Louis Brandeis wrote, the "exercise of arbitrary power" and "to save the people from autocracy."5 It does not envision the executive branch making commitments in advance of congressional approval. In short, the president has little choice other than to woo and win over the members as well as the leaders of Congress, invite them more often to the White House, offer them favors and jobs and grants and contracts and speeches and photo opportunities. More substantively, the president must be willing to consult with them in advance on all major decisions and negotiations, to accept suggestions for change, to share any acclaim. One small symbolic move is to include key members from both Houses and both parties on negotiating teams at inter- national conferences, not as executive branch officials, which the Con- stitution forbids, but as something more than token observers - for example, as delegation advisers representing Congress or informal mem- bers of the delegation. Truman appointed Senators Tom Connally and Arthur H. Vandenberg as delegates to selected peace conferences. Kennedy sent members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to the Moscow negotiations on the Limited Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. In this and many other ways, Congress must be explicitly brought into the formulation, evaluation, and even the implementation as well as the ratification of U.S. foreign policy -because it has power. THE POWER OF PUBLIC OPINION In the U.S. government, foreign policy decision making was once largely the preserve of the president and his secretary of State. No 4 Ibid., 88. 5 Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 293 (1926) (Brandeis J., dissenting).</page><page sequence="7">MAKING FOREIGN POLICY | 521 longer. Outside the federal government, foreign policy influence was once largely the preserve of a small elite "establishment" and a handful of internationalist newspapers. No more. For more than two decades following the close of World War II, the power structure of American foreign policy was a steep pyramid. At the top was the president and just beneath him his secretaries of State and Defense. Beneath them was a tiny handful of other key executive branch appointees, then a larger group from State and other departments, followed by key congressional leaders. Not far from the top was a small, largely homogeneous establishment elite of private opinion leaders, wise men and women, lawyers, bankers, and others, who moved in and out of government councils and official positions. Joining them were columnists and editorial writers for The New York Times and The Washington Post. The wider and deeper layers below were occupied by a larger number of congressmen, journalists, and citizens who were knowledgeable about foreign affairs but whose influ- ence was limited. At the bottom of the pyramid was the general public, empowered every four years to vote for a president but largely inatten- tive to and uninformed about most foreign policy issues except in times of crisis. But over these last two and a half decades, both power and informa- tion in that pyramid have seeped downward. The pyramid remains. The president still has ultimate authority. Members of the-expert for- eign policy establishment, now far more open, diverse, divided, and broad-based, still have more influence than uninterested members of the general public. But the role and influence of each layer of that pyramid have been dramatically altered. The increasing number of executive branch agencies involved in foreign affairs is well known. The expanded role of Congress I have just discussed. Outside of government, the foreign policy elite or establishment, once numbering at most in the hundreds -"the closest thing to a gov- erning aristocracy that has survived in American democracy," in the words of one observer -now consists of thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands. Once largely confined to the Washington-New York- Boston corridor, it is now found in all parts of the country. Once led mostly by Protestant white male graduates of Ivy League universities with close family and business ties to each other, the private foreign policy community is now (like the U.S. Foreign Service, the Council on Foreign Relations, and the Ivy League itself) more representative of all citizens - regardless of race, gender, and social position - who</page><page sequence="8">522 | POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY know and care about foreign affairs. Once focused primarily on rela- tions with Western Europe and Moscow, it now includes specialists on Latin America, the Middle East, East Asia, Africa, and other parts of the globe. Once the elite shared a bipartisan, cold war consensus, based on the undisputed need to contain Stalinist expansion, on the memory of pre-World War II appeasement and lack of preparedness, and on the deep conviction that America had a special moral responsi- bility of worldwide dimensions. Now a new and expanded elite, too large to be called a true elite, which includes representatives of the "neo-conservative" Republican right and the "new politics" Demo- cratic left, agrees on very little and shares no consensus. It is not surprising that greater influence over U.S. foreign policy was once exercised by those who were particularly interested inmit over a sustained period because of their long study and experience. But neither is it surprising that the elite's inflated share of influence on the pyramid could not be maintained, once several separate trends took hold: the sharp increase in this country's level of education, inter- national tourism, and foreign business; the increasing sophistication, and increasing use by politicians of published and private surveys of American public opinion on all issues, including foreign policy; the influence of television; the dramatic increase in the number of presi- dential nominating primaries in which foreign policy issues are often debated at the grassroots; and the intense public feelings about these issues aroused by the war in Vietnam, by Watergate's spotlight on the Imperial Presidency, and by the post-Watergate investigation of intelligence agency abuses. The American public is now heard as never before on foreign policy- through political action committees, opinion polls, call-in shows, peti- tions, letters to the editor and members of Congress, editorial and Op-Ed essays, pressure groups, protest demonstrations, and other- wise. Presidents have learned that their decisions on war and peace no longer enjoy the automatic passive support of a citizen majority and are not long sustainable without that majority support. Is this a healthy trend? It is not elitism to note that American public opinion on world affairs is too often political, emotional, forgetful, inflexible, inconsistent, erratic, arbitrary, unreasonable, and unpre- dictable. Its demands or restraints are likely to be less professional than those of the experts, less well informed, less likely to take the long view. It rarely considers the needs of the next generation or the history of the last. It is frequently hampered by myths and misinforma-</page><page sequence="9">MAKING FOREIGN POLICY | 523 tion, by stereotypes and shibboleths, by an innate resistance to innova- tion. It is usually slow to form, difficult to distinguish, promiscuous, often volatile or even sentimental in its affection, endowing foreign nations with the anthropomorphic characteristics of a particular leader whom people like or dislike from his photographs and headlines. We assume that Iraq is Saddam Hussein, that Russia is Boris Yeltsin, and, that England is Margaret Thatcher, who isn't even there anymore. In this age of instant gratification, the American public usually wants immediate or dramatic solutions, not long-drawn-out wars or negotia- tions, not pressure through sanctions or evolutionary developments. Lyndon Johnson once said during the Vietnam War: "What the Amer- ican people like is action . .. if I went to Hanoi to make peace, my popularity polls would immediately go up 10 percent - and they would be exactly the same if I bombed Peking. . . . They don't like anything measured."6 That is a harsh indictment. What should the leader of a presidential democracy do? Long ago Lord James Bryce expressed his concern that too many a politician in this country was "always listening for the popular voice, always afraid to commit himself to a view which may turn out to be unpopular"7 and thus unable to penetrate beneath the superficialities of the newspaper and the platform. Today a presi- dential candidate appeasing public opinion on foreign policy reaches for unwise or impracticable campaign promises, oversimplified to win the applause of each immediate audience. The demand for maintaining an outmoded military base or local weapons factory, or favoring in negotiations a particular commodity or ancestral homeland, is difficult to resist. But there are rarely demands to help a developing nation or to back the World Bank or to strengthen the United Nations. Similarly, incumbent presidents seeking reelection will be tempted to postpone difficult questions (as Ford did on the Panama Canal in 1976, Carter did on the SALT II Treaty in 1980, and Bush did on Yugoslavia in 1992). There is the temptation to reach for a quick fix (like Johnson's 1964 Gulf of Tonkin response and Carter's 1980 Iranian hostage rescue mission); the temptation to make ethnic appeals even though they antagonize our allies (as Woodrow Wilson in 1916 antagonized the British in order to please the American Irish), the temptation to dazzle 6 Quoted in Theodore C. Sorensen, A Different Kind of Presidency (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1984), 49. 7 James Bryce, The American Commonwealth (New York: Macmillan, 1899).</page><page sequence="10">524 | POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY the voters with world travel or emotional speeches or new foreign policy gimmicks. "Nothing is more dangerous," Winston Churchill once wrote regarding a leader's responsibility, "than to live in the temperamental atmosphere of a Gallup Poll, always feeling one's pulse and taking one's political temperature."8 And yet the influence of domestic public opinion in politics in our foreign policy decisions is consistent with both our Constitution and our concept of government. To say that we should remove such issues as bombing in Bosnia or human rights in China from politics is to say that they should be removed from public accountability and scru- tiny. To charge that a president is politically motivated when he sends troops to repel Iraqis or to feed Somalis is simply to charge that he is doing what every elected official is elected to do. But democratic government need not be a mere popularity contest; and no president is obliged to abide by the dictates of public opinion. The president's duty is to shape that opinion, inform it, woo it, win it, enlist it to his purposes. The conscientious president will be able to separate in his mind and speeches the long-range public interest from short-term public opinion - to realize that the value to this nation of economic assistance to Russia, for example, is not determined by its popularity; or that the North American Free Trade Agreement, to cite another example, cannot await grassroots approval. The wise president, while not committing political suicide on behalf of hopeless causes, will not yield to every popular passion and prejudice of the passing moment. He knows he must offend some of the people in order to serve all of the people, to spend some of his popularity in order to preserve the rest. "I value solid popularity," said Senator Thomas Hart Benton almost a century and a half ago, after he lost his seat over the slavery issue: "I value solid popularity -the esteem of good men for good action. I despise the bubble popularity that is won without merit and lost without crime. . . ."9 On occasion, the president must defy public opinion, reject its demands, assert his own priorities. The relationship between strong leadership and popular de- mocracy is in fact one of tension and reconciliation (much like the famous reform university president who asked in all sincerity: "How can I democratize this university . .. if the faculty won't do as I say?") 8 Report on the War, House of Commons, 30 September 1941, quoted in John Bartlett, Familiar Quotations (Boston: Little Brown, 1980), 745. 9 Quoted in John F. Kennedy, Profiles in Courage (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1957), 120.</page><page sequence="11">MAKING FOREIGN POLICY | 525 I will revert to this matter of leadership in a moment. But I want to conclude my observations on the power of public opinion by noting that underneath all the clamor it has often been wiser than many of the so-called experts -not as ideological and not as weighted down with excessive jargon and inapt historical analogies. Since World War II, American public opinion has been remarkably consistent in its adherence to most basic long-range foreign policy objectives and re- markably supportive of our unprecedented commitment to our allies. Neither unilateralist nor isolationist, preferring neither a weak nor a belligerent America, it has been selective in its endorsement of armed intervention and steadfast in its support of human rights and prefer- ence for negotiated solutions. Most presidents who achieve reasonably prompt and painless results within those boundaries (not easy!) can still draw upon a large reservoir of public confidence, enlisting the power of public opinion behind their policies. If adequately informed about an issue over a prolonged period, the American people are likely to support a presidential decision that is reasonable and realistic. THE POWER OF THE PRESS, PARTICULARLY TELEVISION "If adequately informed. . . ." That is where the power of the press, and particularly television, comes into play in the modern era. In 1950, when the international institutions and U.S. consensus policies that prevailed for forty years of cold war were established primarily by those at the top of the pyramid, 9 percent of American homes had a television set; today over 98 percent do. Television became the primary provider of news for most Americans in 1963, and its lead has con- tinued to increase ever since. Television news is the principal source of information for most people on presidential and congressional elec- tions, on foreign policy, international conflicts, and other national and international events. Evening news shows in particular - including the news telecast on local stations, many of which have extensive for- eign coverage and even their own foreign correspondents - are watched by more than seven of every ten American adults in the course of a week. The advent of CNN, satellite broadcasting, electronic hand-held cameras, videotape, and other technological advances have steadily increased live television news coverage of overseas events, particularly in Western Europe, where more television bureaus are stationed than in any other foreign region. Three important differences make television's impact on American</page><page sequence="12">526 | POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY attitudes toward foreign policy much greater than print journalism ever had. First, a far higher proportion of Americans watch television news than ever read newspapers or news magazines. Second, live action pictures on television -of starving children in Somalia or protesting students in China or ravaged villages in Bosnia - give it a credibility and impact, according to surveys, that override any conflicting information received from newspapers or from the president, the State Department, congressional leaders, or anyone else. Third, and most significant, television reaches a huge "inadvertent" audience, those at the bottom of that foreign policy power pyramid who are normally uninterested in world events. Newspaper surveys find very few consumers read very few foreign news stories for more than a very few minutes. Most of those who do read foreign news read only headlines and an occasional half of a story, and make clear that they do not want more foreign news coverage. The average news- paper reader reads even less. But the average television viewer, who spends one-third of his day watching the screen by the hour instead of by program, is exposed involuntarily to international news that he or she would not have chosen to learn. The members of this vast inadvertent audience, many of whom have little or no information on the world beyond our borders other than that conveyed to them by television, often find their attention unintentionally engaged by the picture unfolding before them, their interest inadvertently aroused, their opinions almost involuntarily formed, and their actions as well as reactions as voters and citizens spontaneously motivated. The result of this extension of foreign policy decision making to those at the bottom of the pyramid is undoubtedly democratic; but whether it produces wise and constructive decisions and not simply emotional reactions and ill-considered interventions or changes of course depends in large part on the adequacy and accuracy of the information people receive. If the limitations of a 100-second news story require oversimplified presentations of multifaceted problems and the total omis- sion of less dramatic events, if the limitations of the camera require the slighting of key institutional and evolutionary developments that are better analyzed in print, if for the sake of a good picture a negative emphasis on colorful violence or dramatic conflict exaggerates the role of force in the world, then those television viewers with few or no other sources of information may urge unreservedly hasty or deceptively painless decisions upon their government.</page><page sequence="13">MAKING FOREIGN POLICY | 527 I am not optimistic on that score. Objective surveys show that much of the American television public is still ill informed, still handicapped by stereotypes and slogans, still uninterested in seeking more informa- tion, and still unconcerned about most foreign policy issues. One anal- ysis comparing postelection surveys in 1948 (when print media domi- nated the news) and 1976 (when television news was dominant and public affairs programming had doubled) found that public under- standing of the issues had not noticeably improved. Television, moreover, lends itself even less than newspapers to the encouragement of secret or even quiet diplomacy, the kind in which compromises are painstakingly negotiated to completion before second- guessing criticism can undermine them. Television helps to publicize plans or intentions that might better have been left unknown, to spread words of anger or commitment that might better have been left un- heard. "I doubt," said Abba Eban, the former foreign minister of Israel, "whether . . . Moses on Mount Sinai would have been... [successful] if, after every one of the Ten Commandments, he had to come down . . . and be interviewed by Walter Cronkite or Barbara Walters." But, for better or worse, television has certainly increased the democ- ratization of American foreign policy. It has reduced the influence of The New York Times and The Washington Post, the daily journals of the old foreign policy establishment. It has communicated many a breaking international event to the entire nation at virtually the identical moment that the president and director of the CIA learn about it. Its public affairs programs have sought to inform more people about more foreign problems than any other medium in history. It has brought to millions the expert foreign policy views of public offi- cials and private scholars, including many who would never have been invited to join the old elite. It has required the U.S. government to present appealing reasons for any course of action abroad that will cause public alarm. It has given all U.S. citizens, regardless of the regional influences to which they are subject or the newspaper markets in which they live, the same information on foreign affairs at the same time. And it has made the Oval Office a bully pulpit far beyond anything Theodore Roosevelt could have imagined, giving the presi- dent not so much unlimited power as unequalled opportunity -the opportunity to inform and persuade and cajole, the opportunity to mobilize support, to take the initiative, to set the agenda, and to keep the nation focused on his proposals and his solutions.</page><page sequence="14">528 | POLITICAL SCIENCE QUARTERLY CONCLUSION I do not advocate that the president be a mere seismograph, utilizing television as the great electronic town hall of Ross Perot's description in which television viewers vote by push-button or otherwise on whether he should arm the Bosnian Muslims or bomb the Bosnian Serbs. But I do believe the television audience can be a strong president's sword in foreign affairs, as well as his compass, to arouse that majority of Americans who are indifferent to most foreign policy issues. As one observer recently described the American public's attitude toward the former Yugoslavia, the former Soviet Union, and most other parts of the world: "Apathy is rampant here; but who cares?" The president cares, because he needs public support and enthusiasm; and television can enable him to lead and inform public opinion, if he uses it effec- tively and selectively. In short, the rival sources of power can be strengths instead of obsta- cles to an effective president. He can not only consult with but enlist the Congress, not only inform but mobilize public opinion, and not only recognize but utilize the power of national television. That is the kind of leadership our country urgently needs. That is the kind of leadership I am hoping history will find to have occupied the White House today. I do not share the concerns of those who criticize this president or any president for advancing his own objectives and priorities. Better that he be a John Adams, writing in his White House diary: "I desire no inscription on my gravestone other than this: 'Here lies John Adams who took it upon himself to avoid war with France,"' than to be a Warren G. Harding, complaining to a White House crony: "I listen to one side and they seem right, and then . . . I talk to the other side and they seem just as right, and then I am back to where I started. ... God, what a job!"10 What a job it is indeed. But what a vast need exists on this planet for real leaders, under either parliamentary or presidential systems. I do not share the view of Marx or Hegel or Spencer that the great tides of history and economics determine our fate, rather than indi- vidual leaders and heroes. I believe with Carlyle that the right indi- vidual in the right place at the right time- can alter history and human events; and I have seen it happen. 10 Remarks of Warren G. Harding, 1922, reported in Joseph R. Conlin, The Morrow Book of Quotations in American History (New York: Morrow, 1984), 135.</page></plain_text>
