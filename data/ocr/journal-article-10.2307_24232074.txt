Introduction Thorstein Veblen's contribution to institutional economics opened up the possibility of a new type of social analysis that promised to use historical data whilst allowing the possibility of theoretical generalisation. Veblen outlined a metaphysical research programme:1 he sketched a cosmology, identified relevant problems and outlined an evolutionary style of analysis that was appropriate to them. An important dynamic element of this research programme (which I call Veblen's Evolutionary Theory or VET) is the adaptation of social institutions to a changing technological environment (Veblen, 1899A, 1904, 1914). Yet VET has had negligible impact on the modern study of Manuscript received 29 November 2007; final version received 1 May 2009.

Latsis technological change; very little applied technology research draws on Veblenian insights.1 Instead, Veblen's successors have tended to focus on the historical and philosophical exegesis of his work. Whilst sociological factors and political trends have played their part in this retreat from constructive theorising, some historians of economic thought have sought to explain it by reference to Veblen's ideas. They have argued that subsequent generations of institutionalist economists were unable to operationalise his insights due to seemingly intractable methodological, empirical and normative challenges. This paper explores the latter diagnosis and suggests that Veblen's writings—particularly his analysis of technological change in the USA at the turn of the twentieth century— contain ample resources to respond to all three challenges. Rather than succumbing to the traditional criticisms, his approach founders due to his failure to articulate a social ontology. Whilst Veblen's analysis of his own time remains in many ways compelling, this failure creates a gap between meta-theoretical promise and current theoretical results. In the latter part of the paper, I show how work in technology studies has begun to address some of the problems associated with Veblenian economics. This success is tempered by the fact that the field has not yet provided an appropriate framework to systematise the ways in which technical innovations transform social relations in ways that are beyond our conscious control and manipulation. A theoretical account of this type of 'technological drift' is central to Veblen's project and largely absent from recent contributions to the sociological study of technology. 2. Veblen's evolutionary theory: instincts, institutions and technology At the base of VET is a relatively static view of human nature. Humans (with minor differentiation accorded to different racial groupings) have a stable set of 'instincts'2 that were developed in the last Ice Age. This period of significant adaptation and change coincided with the longest historical period in Veblen's evolutionary model, the period of savagery. He did not believe that significant changes had affected human instincts since this period. Thus, instincts were 'best suited' to the rigours of life in 'savage' society.3 Veblen proposes an analysis of what he regards to be the three most important instincts. The parental bent is the human instinct that underlies all altruistic feelings for the community and, more specifically, caring for the material aspects of the welfare of others (Veblen, 1914, pp. 25-7). The instinct of idle curiosity underpins all apprehension of causal sequence and is the ultimate source of scientific endeavour (Veblen, 1914, pp. 85-9). And perhaps the most important instinct is the instinct of workmanship. This instinct encompasses the human proclivities that promote efficiency in the pursuit of some end. 1 Another economist who wrote about technological change, Joseph Schumpeter, has received increased attention in modern economics. There is now an entire research programme of evolutionary economics based on his ideas (Nelson and Winter, 1982; Freeman and Soete, 1997). The Schumpeterian evolutionary economists have been quick to delve into theoretical and empirical problems relating to the development, exploitation and transfer of technology. 2 Instincts are best seen as basic drives, impulses towards immediate ends that are inherited from the evolutionary past. Veblen's usage of the term is confusing and imprecise and has led to some criticism from commentators (Schneider, 1948). However, there is evidence that he was aware of the vagueness of the concept and attempted to use it with caution, so that his own contribution might be sensitive to subsequent developments in anthropology, biology and psychology (Diggins, 1977, pp. 123-7). 3 A similar view has received renewed interest in recent years and has common currency amongst modern evolutionary psychologists (see, e.g., Barkow et al., 1992).</page><page sequence="3">Veblen on the machine process and technological change 603 It is at the basis of human ingenuity in the creation of tools and artefacts and is the driving force behind technological innovation.1 Veblen did not believe that all things social flow directly from a detailed account of human nature. Hence, instincts did not have a direct role in determining social structures in his framework. The countless ways in which instincts combine with each other and are shaped by the cultural environment mean that almost any pattern of behaviour could be sanctioned by them.2 Unlike his relatively static view of human nature, Veblen held an adaptive view of social institutions. He often defined institutions as the prevalent habits of thought and action of human collectives under the direction of cumulative causal processes stretching back into history. Change at the institutional level could be affected with greater speed than was the case in biological evolution. Thus, the institutional environment did not correspond in any simple or direct way to the instincts of a given population. Veblen regarded institutions as fundamental to social life and its explanation in the social sciences and referred to them regularly. Nevertheless, which definition of institutions he actually accepted is a matter of debate in the history of economic thought and methodology literatures.3 One interpretation receives the bulk of the textual support and has traditionally been the dominant point of view. According to this view, institutions are, in Veblen's words: . . . principles of action which underlie the current, business-like scheme of economic life, and as such, as practical grounds of conduct, they are not to be called in question without questioning the existing law and order. As a matter of course, men order their lives by these principles and, practically, entertain no question of their stability and finality. That is what is meant by calling them institutions; they are settled habits of thought common to the generality of men. (Veblen, 1909, p. 239) Institutionalists generally understand habits as repeated patterns of action. Extending this notion, one could understand habits of thought as patterns of mental association that arise from habitual action. According to Veblen, we become embedded in networks of habitual actions through education and custom and it is from these actions that habits of thought are generated.4 This perspective implicitly rejects a strong distinction between 1 It is important to see instincts as having a teleological character, yet not to equate them directly with the conscious beliefs and desires of individual agents. For Veblen, instincts were general tendencies, emergent out of the complex of psychological and physiological elements that constitute human organisms (Veblen, 1914, pp. 27-8). Thus, Veblen could maintain the view that different individuals may diverge very significantly from the overall tendency represented by a specific instinct. 2 See Veblen's discussion of the limitations of marginal utility economics for his clearest disavowal of the reductionist project in economics (Veblen, 1909, pp. 242-3). 3 The dominant interpretation of institutions-as-habits-of-thought is not universally accepted. Some economic methodologists interested in the developmental consistency of Veblen's ideas have suggested that the institutions-as-habits-of-thought view is too simplistic to account for his theoretical contributions (O'Hara, 2002; Lawson, 2003A). Lawson has gone on to propose an alternative reading that emphasises Veblen's later writings on institutions, suggesting that it is implicit in many subsequent institutionalist accounts (Lawson, 2003A, pp. 212-17, 28n). He demonstrates that the passages usually interpreted as definitions by commentators are, in fact, examples or illustrations of specific institutions. This becomes clearer in Veblen's later works such as The Instinct of Workmanship which—according to Lawson—shows his advocacy of a more general conception of institutions that encompasses structured processes of interactions including habits, but also including rules, relations, positions and other practices. The alternative account of institutions is particularly attractive when one takes into account Veblen's imprecise usage of the term: he uses 'institution' to denote a wide range of non-individual, non-reflective elements of social organisation (e.g. Veblen, 1914, p. 7). Amongst institutionalists the difference between these two conceptions may turn out to be purely semantic, but, as an anonymous referee of this journal helpfully pointed out, Veblen's definition of institutions may be more important for modern interpreters from a new institutionalist background who are seeking to appropriate elements of VET for their own purposes. 4 See Waller (1988) for a discussion of habit in Veblen, and Camic (1986) for a further analysis of habit in the broader context of social theory.</page><page sequence="4">604 J. Latsis rational calculation and purposeful action. In contrast, action and thought are collapsed into one another so that repetitive patterns of thought, sensations and physical motions are continuously influencing and contaminating each other.1 The view of institutions as-habits-of-thought is held by authors such as Rutherford (1984, p. 333), Murphey (1990, p. xxxiii) and Hodgson (1998, p. 179), who otherwise disagree on important interpretative issues. What of change in this theoretical framework? For Veblen the two biggest failings of the classical and neoclassical schools were their advocacy of static analysis and their failure to adopt evolutionary approaches to the social sciences (Veblen, 1898, 1899B). His own theoretical contributions were designed to redress this problem and provide dynamic accounts of how societies and economies changed. But in the above picture of institutions there is no mention of change. In two of his major books (Veblen, 1904, 1914), Veblen introduced the idea that the motor of social change is technology. He asserted that the primary concern of any community was to ensure its survival and reproduction through provision for the basic physiological and material needs of its members. This meant that the modes of production and distribution of material goods were central to the process of social change, but they were (in turn) dependent on the development of the industrial arts—the embodiment of human expertise and knowledge in technological artefacts. Veblen's aforementioned porous distinction between action and thought gives us a clue to why interaction with technical artefacts appeared so crucial to him. As these artefacts change (sometimes through unintentional or accidental events and processes) so the practical requirements of everyday action and thought change. Veblen's main examples were drawn from the rampant mechanisation of the workplace that was occurring during his time. The introduction of machine tools and production lines at the turn of the twentieth century radically changed the physical and psychological environment of the workplace, the organisation of labour and the political landscape. This is what Veblen described as machine discipline. Veblen fully expected resistance to the influence of technological innovations: he saw no transcendental compulsion for institutions to come to reflect the extant material needs of the community.2 Indeed, according to VET, many institutions are by their nature vestigial. Institutions are not rationally designed in order to meet the actual needs of human beings; rather, they are the outgrowth of a set of beliefs and cultural practices that are attuned to a prior period of technological development and different material needs. Consequently, reconciling the mundane activities of everyday productive activity with the legal and economic institutions that govern it creates friction.3 Veblen's important theoretical works are littered with historical and anthropological evidence to illustrate this point. His numerous examples include: unmasking the predatory underpinnings of property ownership (Veblen, 1899A, pp. 15-22); denouncing the 'pecuniary emulation' associated with consumption (Veblen, 1899A, pp. 43-62); dismiss ing the economic importance of loan credit and financial instruments (Veblen, 1904, pp. 49-54); and deriding the business management of production as the 'conscientious 1 Hodgson (2004, pp. 171-5) offers a similar interpretation of this aspect of Veblen's thought, though his argument focuses on Veblen's links to the pragmatists and strongly asserts the primacy of habit over rational deliberation. 2 The role of machine discipline in VET has nevertheless been taken as evidence of Veblen's utopianism by some authors (Edgell, 2001, pp. 137-59). 3 Commentators have long taken this friction to be a distinguishing characteristic of VET (Edgell, 1975; Samuels, 1977).</page><page sequence="5">Veblen on the machine process and technological change 605 withdrawal of efficiency' (Veblen, 1921, pp. 5-13). His radical tone and rhetorical flourishes in many of these passages have not always served him well, leading some to dismiss his constructive theoretical contributions and relegate him to the role of a social critic (Coats, 1954). 3. Three challenges to VET Institutionalist historians of thought have tended to reject the interpretation of Veblen as social commentator and critic. They have accepted both the cogency and explanatory potential of VET, but many have emphasised the 'unfulfilled promise' of the research programme (Rutherford, 1998). Veblen's intellectual successors are pivotal in this assessment of VET since it is claimed that these second-generation institutionalists ran up against the limitations of his framework once they attempted to implement it. Commentators have tended to emphasise three distinct types of challenge faced by VET. The first of these is methodological and is exemplified by the work of Wesley Clare Mitchell. Mitchell was a both a student and an admirer of Veblen's work, but after the failure of his own large-scale 'money economy' project he concluded that VET did not provide adequate tools to allow subsequent institutionalists to model social evolution (Rutherford, 1998, pp. 472-4). During this period, economics was developing a growing array of statistical resources and techniques whose compatibility with Veblenian analysis was, at best, highly questionable (Mitchell, 1950, pp. 20-36). Modern quantitative analysis reduced the study of institutions to static snapshots of social relations and causality to constant conjunction. Veblen's emphasis on the study of processes and the production of detailed genetic accounts of institutional transformation represented a clear methodolog ical mismatch. The second challenge to VET was exemplified by the work of a colleague, Robert Hoxie. Convinced by Veblen's methodological writings, Hoxie embarked on a long-term study of American trade unions that was motivated by Veblen's predictions. His case studies of the structure, motives and habits of thought of American trade unions yielded results that contradicted Veblen's predictions (Hoxie, 1914A). In particular, they undermined the idea that interaction with machine technology would challenge the received doctrines of natural rights, freedom of contract and private property (Hoxie, 1914B). Thus, VET was faced with a quite separate empirical challenge to its applicability. Social evolution was supposed to occur primarily through the mechanism of technological innovation and the ensuing adaptation of working populations to new technical infrastructures but, according to Hoxie, this was not happening in the way Veblen described (Rutherford, 1998, pp. 474-5). The third challenge emerged from Clarence Ayres's interpretation of Veblen and has arguably become the touchstone of subsequent institutionalist theory. This normative challenge to VET has been dubbed the Veblenian Dichotomy.1 Ayres attempted to synthesise Veblen's evolutionary theory and John Dewey's instrumentalism by re-interpreting Veblen's distinction between the industrial and the pecuniary as a dichotomy between 'ceremonial' institutions and 'instrumental' technology (Ayres, 1978). On this interpre tation, VET turns on a fundamental opposition between technology, which is seen as good, socially useful and moral, and institutions, which are bad, inefficient and immoral (Mayhew, 1998, pp. 456-60). In the hands of Ayres and his followers, the normative 1 The Journal of Economic Issues contains an enormous critical literature on the definition, use and consequences of the dichotomy (Samuels, 1977). There also have been widely cited restatements (Munkirs, 1988) and suggested amendments (Dugger, 1995).</page><page sequence="6">606 J. Latsis character of the dichotomy has raised controversy as critics have claimed that it has become an empty classificatory scheme that simply redefines anything hindering economic development as an institution and anything that advances it as technology (Walker, 1979; Hodgson, 2004, pp. 359-61). It is my contention that Veblen's writings on the influence of the machine process contain a response to the challenges that has subsequently been hampered by his conceptual framework. In his account of machine discipline, Veblen provides an outline of how his evolutionary theory could respond to the methodological challenge. The mechanism of institutional change is quite clear in this case: changes in the technology of the workplace shape and condition perceptions, habits and practices that go well beyond it.1 Unlike Mitchell, Veblen does not resort to static descriptions of rigid institutions in order to explore their unchanging effects. Instead he provides a descriptively rich account of how interaction with new tools transforms the perceptions of workers bringing new contradictions to light and stimulating changing habits. The blurring of thought and action is crucial to this move. Veblen's workers do not possess well thought out theories that are applied then refuted and revised when environmental conditions change. If action and thought are conceived as continuous, then changes in the practical requirements of simple everyday behaviours have far-reaching consequences. Veblen discussed the ways in which changing patterns of tool-use contribute to the transformation of wider social practices and institutions (Veblen, 1904, pp. 5-20). He observed that as the scale and interconnections linking various parts of the industrial system increased, so standard forms of measurement would become requirements for anyone involved in the day-to-day management of production. This pattern would be mirrored in the standardisation of manufactured inputs to the production process such as tools, gauges and other mechanical instruments. These everyday objects would re-shape the actions of industrial workers as older artisanal processes of adaptation and adjustment began to disappear. The speed and efficiency of work would increase dramatically whilst the sources and complexity of potential breakdowns would change. Veblen's originality lay in drawing systematic connections between these newly quantified, timed and truncated behaviours and broader cultural change. He conjectured that the introduction of precise quantitative methods of production and control developed through Taylorian management techniques would change workers' perceptions of the world (Veblen, 1904, pp. 146-9). Under the influence of the machine process, workers would begin to apprehend their environment in terms of cumulative processes. This shift requires the abandonment of the 'workmanlike' view of causation that casts the first event in a sequence as the 'originator' or 'producer' of the next and would signal a corresponding decline in the anthropomorphic perception of the production process. As we have already seen, Veblen also made speculative predictions about the impact of industrial production and Taylorian management on union membership, organisation and behaviour (Veblen, 1904, 1914). The empirical challenge is based on Hoxie's discovery that the predictions were not borne out: unions and union officials were as rapacious and self-serving as the industrialists. If we were to read Veblen's contribution as a simple deductive model, this disconfirming evidence would be damaging. But few if any social theories have been submitted to such a stern test and subsequently rejected: it would be 1 This view should not be read as a form of crude determinism where behaviour is entirely determined by the productive forces. Rather, it seems that the emphasis on machine discipline is specific to the period when Veblen was writing. The prevalence of salaried work in large unionised businesses explains his interest in this aspect of society at the expense of others.</page><page sequence="7">Veblen on the machine process and technological change 607 highly uncharitable to interpret VET in this way. We know from his methodological writings that Veblen was not a positivist and his theory did not hinge on the production of testable hypotheses. Pre-dating Popper by decades, he certainly would not have put any faith in falsificationism either. So, from Veblen's perspective, Hoxie's discoveries about the nature of American unions were not a genuine threat to VET. The evidence for this response is readily available in Veblen's own writings. Veblen actually took many of Hoxie's insights into account in subsequent discussions of unionisation and the future of the US economy (Rutherford, 1998, p. 475). He re assessed the role of the working classes in triggering large-scale institutional change. He even suggested an alternative possible future in his short book The Engineers and the Price System (Veblen, 1921), in which he claimed that the opportunity for instigating radical institutional change lay with the engineers rather than ordinary workers whose habits were too strongly conditioned by prevalent social institutions and conventions.1 If Veblen was capable of producing two different (perhaps even contradictory) future scenarios from the operation of one process (machine discipline), then the impact of technology on institutions could not be simple, predictable or deterministic. Which brings us to the normative challenge. The Ayresian interpretation of the dichotomy between institutions and technology has exercised the fascination of in stitutionalist economists for decades without producing a definitive formulation or decisive theoretical results.2 The original version of the dichotomy was softened by Foster's (1981) redefinition of institutions, which emptied the concept of its a priori normative content. This move permitted talk of the ceremonial and instrumental aspects or functions of institutions instead of insisting that they were all, by their nature, regressive and past binding (Tool, 1979; Dugger, 1995). In the latter part of the twentieth century, the broadening of the concept of institution was strategically beneficial to institutionalists as Ayres's technophilia began to look outdated in a world with nuclear power plants and weapons of mass destruction (Mayhew, 1981). Students of the dichotomy went on to propose theoretical tools that could account for the regressive nature of some technological innovations through the process of'ceremonial encapsulation' (Bush, 1987). This process confines instrumental knowledge to problem solving areas that are warranted by the extant 'ceremonial' institutions and their associated value systems. The institutionalist reassess ment of technology has been viewed by many as a move away from the older Veblenian emphasis on machines towards a 'new dichotomy' that opposes ceremonial to instrumental behaviour and does away with all reference to technology (Waller, 1982). Thus, we can see the recent evolution of the dichotomy principally as a reaction to Ayres and his interpretation of Veblen. Perhaps unsurprisingly, commentators have been more circumspect in their assessment of how the dichotomy relates directly to Veblen. The critique has centred on the normative nature of the dichotomy and its connection to VET It is striking that, under the influence of Dewey, Ayres set out an explicit theory of value against Veblen's avowed intent to present his work as the historical consequence of a cumulative causal process. Furthermore, the opposition between institutions and 1 The place of The Engineers and Price System in Veblen's corpus is somewhat contested. Some interpreters have claimed that his apparent technocratic elitism in this book is atypical and unrepresentative (see Edgell, 2001, pp. 147-51). 2 Two books by influential institutionalists have highlighted this recently. Hodgson is critical of Ayres's definition of the Veblenian dichotomy and stresses that subsequent institutionalist analysis has been a 'long retreat' (Hodgson, 2004, p. 353) from this early mistake. Tilman is more sanguine about the value of the dichotomy but nevertheless admits that it remains 'inadequately developed' (Tilman, 2004, p. 102).</page><page sequence="8">608 J. Latsis technology does not appear to reflect the conditional and historically sensitive nature of Veblen's empirical claims about social evolution; it is even contradicted by his analysis of imperial Japan.1 The reification of the dichotomy and the desire to justify and pursue 'progressive' policies has, according to one commentator, trumped Veblen's analytical goals and led to a new, institutionalist taxonomy: Only if some proportion of the economic system is held to be immutable to change can unequivocal policy prescriptions be made. For many modern institutionalists, the appeal of unequivocal policy recommendations has outweighed commitment to evolutionary analysis. (Mayhew, 1998, p. 259) So it seems that the three challenges miss their target. The methodological, empirical and normative problems unearthed by Veblen's successors arise from misunderstandings of the nature of his project and what it can achieve. Yet concrete theoretical advances inspired by his analysis of the machine process have not been developed within institutionalism. Indeed one influential commentator, Geoffrey Hodgson, has gone as far as describing Veblen's account of machine discipline as a 'wrong turning' that deflected Veblen's energies away from the more promising study of business of cycles and aligned him with misguided radicals and reformers (Hodgson, 2004, pp. 206-24). My contention, presented in Section 4, is that the failure to develop Veblen's discussion of the machine process can be explained on ontological grounds and that this weakness has been partially addressed by recent contributions to technology studies. 4. Veblenian social ontology and technology studies Up to this point, my discussion has skirted over the question of what Veblen counts as technology. My strategy is deliberate and is motivated by the fact that he appears to vacillate between two positions in his writings: one that emphasises interaction, and another that emphasises fluidity.2 Veblen's more concrete description of the influence of the machine process clearly emphasises the role that technical artefacts play in shaping human action and thought. This, in turn, encouraged Ayres's definition of technology as the tools-skills nexus, where the recombination of existing artefacts to create new tools plays a crucial role in the theory of economic progress.3 When systematised as part of Veblen's evolutionary theory, the latter interpretation leads naturally to the supposition that there are two distinct categories, 'institutions' and 'technology', which interact with each other. Needless to say, this ontological picture is implicit in many of the contributions of second-generation institutionalists and some of the followers of Ayres.4 1 In 1915, Veblen attributed the economic strength of Japan to its unusual combination of feudal institutions and modern technology (Hodgson, 2004, p. 366-70). 2 Waller has similarly drawn attention to the dual usage of 'technology' and has claimed that confusion surrounding the term is at the base of the 'technology controversy' in institutionalist economics (Waller, 1982, pp. 165-6). However there are important distinctions between his position and mine. His target is 'the Veblen- Ayres tradition' rather than the work of Veblen, and, more importantly, he does not question the analytical importance of the dichotomy. 3 See Lawson (2008) for a recent, in-depth and philosophically informed discussion of Ayres' theory of technology. 4 The interactive view does not imply that Veblen, Ayres or the Ayresians lacked a dynamic view of technology. Instead, it asserts a difference between two types of entities or processes: the technological and the institutional. Whether technology is part of an unfolding, evolutionary process or not is (at least in principle) a separate issue.</page><page sequence="9">Veblen on the machine process and technological change 609 Nevertheless, in his methodological moments, Veblen has something different to say about technology. This view is captured in the following well-known quotation: The technological system is an organisation of intelligence, a structure of intangibles and imponderables, in the nature of habits of thought. It resides in the habits of thoughts of the community and comes to a head in the habits of thought of the technicians. (Veblen, 1923, p. 280) Here he defines 'the technological system' in much the same way that he defines institutions, that is to say, as 'habits of thought'. It should be obvious that the categorical distinction between technology and institutions cannot be sustained if both are subsumed under this broader category. Whatever the merits of the 'fluid' view that I have just described as an interpretation of Veblen,1 it has played an important role in the subsequent institutionalist literature. At least one early commentator identified the central dynamic of VET as 'a conflict of institutions' (Anderson, 1933, p. 616) and, as we have already seen, Waller's 'new dichotomy' describes an equivalent conflict between ceremonial and instrumental forms of behaviour (Waller, 1982, p. 765). At this stage we should note that both interpretations have had important consequences for the subsequent direction VET has taken. The interactive interpretation is at the heart of the Ayresian dichotomy. If technology is strictly defined as tool-use then it can be seen as an independent force, driven by the problem-solving activities of science and hence external to the existing moral and political infrastructure.2 This has the consequence of shifting the focus away from the constitution of technical artefacts (a matter for engineers and designers, not social scientists) and abandoning the empirical study of the machine process first outlined by Veblen. The fluid interpretation originally had a similar effect. Since institutions were traditionally defined as habits of thought, technology could be subsumed under the wider category of institutions and institutionalist economists could concentrate exclusively on the study of different types of behaviour.3 Without the separate analytical categories of 'technology' and 'institutions' that older institutionalists like Veblen and Ayres had employed, the project risked losing its evolutionary character. Instead of describing the adaptation of human populations to changing material circumstances, institutionalists turned to the assessment of extant social institutions—the aim being to figure out if and why these institutions were 'ceremonial' or 'instrumental'. Recently, the fluid interpretation has led to some more promising developments. Brinkman's suggestion that a 'culture-conception' of technology is implicit in Veblen's writings and should be developed within modern institutionalism is a significant internal critique of the development of the dichotomy. Towards the end of his paper, Brinkman suggests that one avenue for constructive theoretical work within the Veblenian tradition 1 It might be objected that the passage I have cited to substantiate the fluid interpretation refers to Veblen's views on 'the technological system', and that this is somehow different from 'technology' tout court. But his writings do not present any systematic theoretical distinction between the idea of technology and that of technological system. In any case, he also describes technology in terms of habits of thought, as the very next sentence from the same page of Absentee Ownership demonstrates: 'This technology of physics and chemistry that goes to make the mechanical system of industry is an organisation of habits of thought which run on the ground of mechanistic logic . . (Veblen, 1923, p. 280). 2 Brinkman has drawn attention to the fact that whilst Veblen (in line with modern social scientists) viewed science as a social institution, Ayres did not (Brinkman, 1997, p. 1032). 3 The fact that many institutionalists have persisted with Ayres' initial emphasis on overt behaviour is a further and related problem. For a more detailed account of the problems that this implicit behaviourism poses for Veblenian institutionalism see Lawson (2003B).</page><page sequence="10">610 J. Latsis lies in the analysis and development of new social technologies (Brinkman, 1997, pp. 1035-6). The idea seems to be that, under the influence of the Ayresian dichotomy, institutionalists have paid insufficient attention to the innovative capacity of different organisational forms. Brinkman's advocacy of social technology challenges the traditional ontological and normative boundaries of recent institutionalism and merits further development. Whatever one's assessment of modern institutionalism as a current within economics, it has obviously moved on from Veblen's central interest in the analysis of the machine process.1 It is also clear that Veblen's ontological confusion regarding the distinction between technology and institutions has contributed to perpetuating the inconclusive excavation of the dichotomy. Consequently, whilst he bequeathed the foundations of a potentially powerful explanatory project within the social sciences, Veblen's followers were hamstrung by his conceptual framework. Modern sociological work on technology offers a potential way out of the current impasse because it addresses the ontological and normative problems raised by later institutionalists. Starting in the mid-1980s, the sub-discipline of technology studies has grown significantly and fractured into a number of competing research programmes. My reading of the literature is necessarily partial, since I will be concerned here with those parts that are most compatible with and useful for Veblen's project. In the broadest terms, sociological approaches to technology have been principally concerned with revealing the political and social aspects of technological change and challenging naive technological determinism. Social scientists have stressed the contingency of technical artefacts and systems (the fact that they could have been otherwise). They also have sought to demonstrate how artefacts are the result of, and incorporate, social relations. Some parts of this literature are particularly relevant to VET because they invoke both a renewed understanding of the ontology of technology and a rejection of the a priori normative elements of the dichotomy. The rejection of the normative aspects of the dichotomy is manifest in one of the earliest and most influential contributions to the field. Langdon Winner, a political theorist interested in the impact of technology, provided a now famous example of the invisible politics 'behind' technological systems. Winner described the work of Robert Moses, a senior civil engineer and planner in New York during the middle part of the twentieth century. Moses' design of the state's transport infrastructure incorporated his racial prejudices and class bias in a way that continued to influence local populations long after he retired from service. Under Moses' tenure, motorway overpasses to local beaches and beauty spots were built deliberately low so that: Automobile-owning whites of'upper' and 'comfortable middle' classes, as he called them, would be free to use the parkways for recreation and commuting. Poor people and blacks, who normally used public transit, were kept off the roads because the twelve-foot tall buses could not handle the overpasses. (Winner, 1986, p. 23) Such structures have a significant impact on prevailing social arrangements by their mere physical presence and inflexibility. The literature yields numerous other examples of the normative frames of designers, producers and distributors of technology creeping into the artefacts that they produce. The lesson is clear: technological artefacts embody people's values and as such they can be as diverse as those values. 1 This might be viewed as a positive development if one were to share Hodgson's negative assessment of Veblen's foray into the analysis of technology.</page><page sequence="11">Veblen on the machine process and technological change 611 The rejection of the normative content of the dichotomy is also reinforced in recent empiricial work. The Social Construction of Technology (SCOT) approach associated with the writings of Wiebe Bijker (Bijker et al., 1987; Bijker, 1990) provides a good example of this. SCOT revolves around a number of case studies of technical innovations (examples include Bakelite plastics, the bicycle, fluorescent lamps), inspired by the questions and methods of science studies. Studying specific episodes of technological change through detailed historical and sociological research has revealed the unacknowledged influence that humans have over the innovation process. A central task of the approach is to undermine the idea of linear or rational progress that dominates our folk understanding of technical development. Empirical studies have shown that the constitution and stabilisation of technical innovations is a complex process. ... I showed how the actual designers of the intensity fluorescent lamp were managers at a business meeting rather than engineers at their drawing boards; how the 'stuff' of this invention was economics and politics, as much as electricity and fluorescence. (Bijker, 1990, p. 186) Considerations of cost, marketability, corporate strategy and the internal politics of the firm combine with concerns about mechanical efficiency in determining design. The idea that any artefact can be produced with purely 'instrumental' considerations in mind is thus entirely rejected. Both the form and the subsequent trajectory of technical innovations are up for grabs in the SCOT framework; they cannot simply be read off from engineering problems and their solutions. An implication of this openness is that technological innovations—insofar as they reach consumers through the mediation of some form of social agency or organisation—are always dependent on the institutional framework that produces them.1 At the same time, empirical studies of technological systems have quietly abandoned the demarcation between the technical and the social. There has been a transition towards understanding both social institutions and technical artefacts as 'socio-technical ensem bles' (Bijker, 1990, pp. 186-9; Bijker &amp; Law, 1992, p. 4), that is as networks of relations between artefacts and people that are relatively stable over time. Unfortunately, this point is rarely emphasised within technology studies. Socio-technical ensembles have been invoked as a methodological necessity (for the study of artefacts), rather than as an ontological proposal. However, whatever the rhetoric, the point forcefully made by SCOT is that the study of technical artefacts and systems in the real world cannot be sustained using simplified interactive categories. We cannot separate the (human) social world from the world of artefacts to investigate their relations with each other. The latter point is the central element of a competing research programme within technology studies: actor-network theory (ANT). In a paper co-authored with a biological anthropologist (Strum and Latour, 1987), Bruno Latour has argued for the inseparability of stable human social arrangements from artefacts. Their analysis is essentially a comparative exercise; an attempt to understand human sociality through the study of primates. One of the central claims is that a lack of extra-somatic technical resources in the form of symbols and artefacts precludes the establishment of stable baboon institutions despite the existence of social processes of negotiation, alliance and conflict amongst these animals that are very similar to those of humans (Strum and Latour, 1987, pp. 790-1). 1 Within institutionalism the idea of ceremonial encapsulation emphasises this dependency, but not through the same mechanism. Instead, ceremonial institutions block or retard the production and dissemination of instrumentally desirable technologies.</page><page sequence="12">612 J. Latsis Thus, for Strum and Latour, the existence of human institutions is necessarily bound up with technical artefacts and systems: ... we encounter a situation where individuals employ more and more material and extra-social means to simplify social negotiations. This gives them the ability to organise others on a large scale, even when those others are not physically present. (Strum and Latour, 1987, p. 793) Only by creating socio-technical ensembles can humans transcend 'weak and renegotiable' alliances of the sort formed by male baboons. The existence of some form of technical apparatus is a necessary component of the institutions that so fascinated Veblen: Through extra somatic resources employed in the process of social complication, units like multinational corporations, states and nations can be constituted. (Strum and Latour, 1987, p. 793) This ontological argument can be used to support the introduction of socio-technical ensembles into the empirical literature. There is also ethnographic evidence for the idea that extra-somatic resources are key to the stabilisation of many social processes. Anthropologists studying 'distributed cognition' claim that cognitive processes such as calculation and navigation—traditionally concep tualised as occurring within the confines of individual minds—cannot be isolated from the human or material environment (Hutchins, 1995). In Hutchins' studies, artefacts are no longer treated as the facilitators or amplifiers of individual cognitive activity; rather, they are understood to be fundamental to the organisation of human skills into 'cognitive functional systems' that are distributed across space and time. Systems such as these display characteristics that their individual elements do not, making them the essential unit of analysis for ethnographers. Anthropological research describes functioning socio technical ensembles in the field and substantiates Latour's claim that extra-somatic resources are central to the stabilisation of at least some typically human activities. This foray into recent work in technology studies demonstrates its potential for addressing the problems faced by VET. First, the normative chasm between institutions and technology has been decisively rejected. Second, the ontological distinction between technology and institutions is superseded in favour of new hybrid concepts with broader empirical applicability. Socio-technical ensembles are imbued with the political and economic values of their designers, manufacturers and users. Their future trajectories are indeterminate and open. In the cases of plastics, bicycles and lamps cited by Bijker, innovations are studied as processes of stabilisation rather than fixed events (inventions) producing settled entities. This point of view does not, however, lead to a blanket denial of the transformative power of innovations. The introduction of new artefacts can produce quasi-irreversible 'closure' as both users and producers find it hard to imagine (let alone live in) a world in which different artefacts fulfil the same functions (Hutchins, 1995, p. 174). Nevertheless, approaches such as SCOT and ANT tend to rely on case studies that end with the stabilisation of a particular product or socio-technical ensemble. In light of this, they have tended to underplay the deterministic effects of settled artefacts on behaviour and the concrete consequences of innovations have often disappeared from view.1 There are obvious reasons for caution. Experience and historical research suggests that it is impossible to systematically predict the 'impacts' of any given innovation, and the new 1 Recently, metaphysical insights from the philosophy of technology have drawn attention to the deterministic effects of artefacts without denying their social constitution (see Kroes &amp; Meijers, 2006).</page><page sequence="13">Veblen on the machine process and technological change 613 focus on socio-technical ensembles means that it is hard to speak of a broad-based category called 'technology' influencing another called 'society', or the reverse.1 But even within a revised framework, the account of technological change appears radically incomplete to a Veblenian. After all, for Veblen the main purpose of studying the machine process was to investigate the mechanism by which individuals and collectives adapt to a changing material environment and how this contributes to broader cultural change. Veblen was committed to developing an evolutionary theory that did not rely on some 'benevolent work of guidance' that would establish 'an ingenious mechanism of forces and motives capable of accomplishing an ordained result' (Veblen, 1899B, p. 115). His discussion of the machine process, with its macroscopic focus and long-term vision, is fundamentally concerned with the consequences of innovation, including those that are outside our conscious control and manipulation. Moreover, historical research on the period supports his claims that interaction with machines had widespread consequences that transcended the workplace.2 Approaches such as SCOT and ANT have not provided a theoretical framework within which to develop these insights. Winner is one of few commentators from within modern technology studies who recognises the Veblenian concern with our inability to fully manipulate and control socio technical ensembles. He labels it 'technological drift' and describes it in the following way: A multiplicity of technologies, developed and applied under a very narrow range of considerations, act and interact in countless ways beyond the anticipations of any person or institution. Except in case of extreme danger or disaster, there are almost no means for controlling or regulating the products of this chain of events. People still retain their logical position as users and controllers of technology. But in the broader context which transcends both 'use' and 'control', this logic of is of little consolation. (Winner, 1977, p. 89) But this is merely a redescription of Veblen's target and important questions about how new socio-technical ensembles affect broader cultural transformation remain unasked. 5. Conclusion I have argued that the three challenges that emerged from the work of Veblen's students and collaborators do not genuinely threaten the cogency of VET as a constructive theory or limit it to the exegetical and philosophical exercises that dominate the current literature. Seen as a metaphysical research programme, VET remains a promising avenue for future research into technological change in spite of the ontological confusion surrounding Veblen's main categories of analysis. Some recent contributions to technology studies suggest a way to reframe Veblen's project, providing rich empirical resources and an 1 There are, of course, methodological reasons for this strategy since almost all the authors in the field see themselves as engaged in a sustained attack on technological determinism. 2 The discipline of the machine process was not confined to the requirements of mundane action in the workplace as demonstrated by studies of the influence of the machine process on early twentieth century culture (Banta, 1993). For example, the truncated and quantified methods of the factory entered family life directly through the home-making manual Helpful Hints and Advice to Employees, which was distributed to the wives of workers at the Ford Motor Company in the Midwest in 1915, one year after the publication of The Instinct of Workmanship. Quantification and an obsession with order and sequence were central to these manuals. They contained specific instructions on standards of cleanliness, ventilation, nutrition and even included advice on how and where the family should be accommodated (Banta, 1993, pp. 212-45). All of this was authoritatively recounted by the 'Ford Sociological Department', and backed up by rafts of statistics and diagrams; it was even addressed to 'The Ford Family Man'. Though few became socialists, the unionised workers of early twentieth century America did see their lives transformed by the formation and stabilisation of new socio-technical systems of production.</page><page sequence="14">614 J. Latsis alternative social ontology. But further theoretical work is necessary in order to bridge the gap between Veblen's meta-theoretical ambition to conceptualise technological change in evolutionary terms and the case-by-case method advocated by sociologists.
