<plain_text><page sequence="1">WHY HEGEL NOW? RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN -Louring the past decade there has been an explosion of interest in Hegel. One can barely keep up with the new editions, translations, commentaries, and articles that have been appearing throughout the world. The reasons for this burst of scholarly activity vary in differ ent cultural milieus, but the question is especially perplexing in the context of Anglo-American philosophy. If there is one philosopher who had been thought to be dead and buried, who embodied all the vices of the wrong way of philosophizing, who seemed to have been killed off by abuse and ridicule, it was Hegel. In order to begin to answer the question of why so many Anglo-American thinkers are finding Hegel so fascinating and worthy of careful study, it is necessary to review briefly the history of the influence of, and the fight against, Hegel in the English-speaking world. I It is frequently forgotten just how important Hegel was on the American scene during the post-Civil War period when American philosophy was in its formative stages. Stimulated initially by the immigration of German intellectuals, there were informal "Hegel Clubs" and groups such as the St. Louis and Ohio Hegelians. The first professional philosophic journal in the United States, The Journal of Speculative Philosophy, was founded by the Hegelian W. T. Harris, who later became U. S. Commissioner of Education. Although the journal published articles by Dewey, Peirce, and James, one of its primary purposes was to encourage the exploration of Hegelian themes. Even more important was the influence (positive and negative) of Hegel on the "classic" American philosophers, especially Dewey, Peirce, James, and Royce. Dewey discovered Hegel when he was a graduate student at Johns Hopkins. In his autobiographical sketch published in 1930, Dewey tells us what Hegel meant to him at the time.</page><page sequence="2">30 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN There were . . . "subjective" reasons for the appeal that Hegel's thought made to me; it supplied a demand for unification that was doubtless an intense emotional craving, and yet was a hunger that only an intellectualized subject matter could satisfy. It is more than difficult, it is impossible, to recover that early mood. But the sense of divisions and separations that were, I suppose, borne in upon me as a consequence of a heritage of New England culture, divisions by way of isolation of self from the world, of soul from body, of nature from God, brought a painful oppression?or, rather, they were an inward laceration. My earlier philosophic study had been an in tellectual gymnastic. Hegel's synthesis of subject and object, matter and spirit, the divine and the human, was however no mere intellectual formula; it operated as an immense release, a liberation. Hegel's treatment of institutions and the arts, involved the same dissolution of hard-and-fast dividing walls, and had a special attraction for me.1 Gradually, Dewey "drifted away" (to use his own expression) from Hegel. Darwin was soon to replace Hegel as a source of in spiration, although the mark of Hegel is evident throughout Dewey's intellectual career.2 It is as if Dewey sought to domesticate Hegel, to incorporate what he took to be sound in Hegel and show how it was compatible with a robust naturalism. The story of Peirce is more complicated. His primary philo sophic interests and, even more important, his philosophic tempera ment were poles apart from Hegel. Peirce was contemptuous of what Hegel and the Hegelians called "logic." He forcefully fought what he took to be its pernicious influence. But increasingly Peirce came to recognize the affinities between his own pragmaticism and Hegelianism (although he always emphasized what he took to be sharp differences). Commenting on the relation between his own categories of Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness and Hegel's philosophy, he wrote: "The truth is that pragmaticism is closely allied to the Hegelian absolute idealism, from which, however, it is sundered by its vigorous denial that the third category (which Hegel degrades to a mere stage of thinking) suffices to make the world, or is even so much as self-sufficient. Had Hegel, instead of regarding the first two stages with his smile of contempt, held on to them as inde 1 John Dewey, "From Absolutism to Experimentalism," in John Dewey, On Experience, Nature, and Freedom, (ed.)

Provoked by his junior colleague at Harvard, Josiah Royce, and his formidable adversary across the Atlantic, F. C. Bradley, James "took on" Hegel and the absolute idealists. At the age of sixty-five, despite his failing health, he could not resist the "professional challenge" of entering enemy territory and delivering a series of lectures at Oxford on "The Present Situation in Philosophy." Oxford had been the center of Absolute Idealism in the Anglo-Saxon world. In these lectures, published in 1908 as A Pluralistic Universe, James announced, "Oxford, long the seedbed, for the English world, of the idealism inspired by Kant and Hegel, has recently become the nursery of a very different way of thinking. ... It looks a little as if the ancient English empiricism, so long put out of fashion here by nobler sounding germanic formulas, might be repluming itself and getting ready for a stronger flight than ever."4 With all his grace, wit, and philosophic charm, James ridiculed and exposed what he took to be the excesses and absurdities of the infatuation with the Absolute. But a close reading of these lectures reveals just how complex his attitude was. There is a marked difference between his treatment of Hegel and some of Hegel's followers, who lost them selves in "bloodless abstractions." Despite Hegel's "abominable habits of speech," James claims that he was "a naively observant man" who "plants himself in the empirical flux of things and gets the impression of what happens."5 He extols Hegel for his keen awareness of the quality of the world as alive, and involving a di alectic movement in things. "Concepts were not in his eyes the static self-contained things that previous logicians had supposed, but 3 Charles Sanders Peirce, Collected Papers, (eds.)

BERNSTEIN were germinative, and passed beyond themselves into each other by what he called their immanent dialectic."6 "Merely as a reporter of certain empirical aspects of the actual, Hegel, then is great and true."7 But, according to James, Hegel was not content to be an "empirical reporter," he was "dominated by a notion of a truth that should prove incontrovertible, binding on everyone, and certain, which should be the truth, one, indivisible, eternal, objective and neces sary, to which all our particular thinking must lead as to its con summation."8 Hegel then sowed the seeds for, and himself suc cumbed to, the "vicious intellectualism" that dominates the absolute idealism of his British disciples. But despite James' capacity to be sympathetic with what he took to be "great and true" in Hegel, the primary effect of A Plural istic Universe was to help kill off philosophic interest in Hegel. After James' apparently devastating attack, it was difficult for any Ameri can philosopher to take Hegel seriously. Josiah Royce was the American philosopher who was most deeply affected by Hegel. He was a sensitive interpreter of German ideal ism, and one of the first major American thinkers to appreciate the importance of Hegel's Phenomenology. His translations, lectures, and own creative philosophic work might have opened Hegel to others and shown what was "living" in him. But unlike Dewey, James, and Peirce, who did exercise a great influence on the course of Ameri can philosophy, Royce unfortunately has always been a much more marginal figure who exerted almost no direct influence on subsequent philosophic discussion. The characteristic feature of this first flowering of Hegel in America was the shared sense that Hegel was, at the very least, a worthy opponent. Dewey, James, Peirce, and Royce?for all their differences?sought to state and clarify their own philosophic positions over and against Hegel. A philosopher "lives" as long as such an attitude prevails. He dies when it is no longer thought necessary to argue with him. One of the reasons why the classic American philosophers took Hegel so seriously?if only to "refute" him?was because of the 6 Ibid., p. 165. 7 Ibid., p. 169. 8 Ibid.

As Dewey reports, "The 'eighties and 'nineties were a time of new ferment in English thought; the reaction against atomic individualism and sensationalistic empiri cism was in full swing."9 The dominating figure of the British Ideal ists was F. C. Bradley, who forcefully argued in support of the Abso lute. But the relation between the British Idealists and Hegel is a complex and curious one. The version of Absolute Idealism pro duced in England was quite unHegelian and even anti-Hegelian. Hegel's vivid sense of history, and of the dialectical struggle by which Geist realizes itself, played almost no role for the British Idealists. Hegel's Logic was considered to be the primary text, not his Phe nomenology or his writings about Objective Spirit. The theme that fascinated the Absolute Idealists was the way in which Hegel pre sumably had shown that everything is internally related into a single absolute whole. Like so much of British philosophy before and after this brief flourishing of Absolute Idealism, it was decidedly ahistorical. When James went to Oxford in 1907, Absolute Idealism was al ready on the wane, although McTaggart was yet to publish his com mentary on Hegel's Logic. But the demise of Idealism was due primarily to the growing influence of two "young Turks": Bertrand Russell and G. E. Moore. Both had breathed the heady atmosphere of Idealism and both, after a brief infatuation, were repelled by it. When read against the background of Bradley, we can see how Russell's epistemological use of his theory of descriptions, his in sistence on knowledge by acquaintance, and his ontological claims about particulars were motivated by the desire to refute and answer Idealism.10 Moore's paper, "The Refutation of Idealism," became something of a minor classic.11 Moore attacked all forms of Idealism. Russell?and in a very different way, Moore too?set out to show that what the Idealists claimed to be absurd and contradictory was actually sound and true. 9 "From Absolutism to Experimentalism," p. 9. 10 See, for example, Chapter IV of Russell's The Problems of Phi losophy (London: Home University Library, 1912). 11 G. E. Moore, "The Refutation of Idealism," Mind, N. S., XII (1903), pp. 433-453. For a lucid account of the rise and fall of Absolute Idealism in British Philosophy, see A. M. Quinton, "Absolute Idealism," Dawes Hicks Lecture on Philosophy: British Academy, 1971. From the Proceedings of the British Academy, Vol. LVII (London: Oxford University Press).</page><page sequence="6">34 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN The British form of Absolute Idealism passed away from its dominant position almost as quickly as it had arisen. It was soon looked upon as a temporary aberration in long tradition of British empiricism. Within a few short years after the early attacks by Russell and Moore, young English philosophers were no longer "refuting" Absolute Idealists, they simply didn't read them. To complete this sketch of the demise of Hegel among Anglo American philosophers, two other events must be mentioned: the impact of logical positivism and the enormous influence of Karl Popper's The Open Society and Its Enemies. Although the mem bers of the original Vienna Circle were not directly reacting against Hegel, nevertheless the type of philosophizing represented by Hegel is what they so deeply opposed and sought to eliminate. They claimed that it was little more than high sounding verbiage which when unmasked turns out to be empty and cognitively meaningless. So Hegel was not simply mistaken, advocating a false position which had to be refuted. Rather, his pseudo-propositions were the epitome of metaphysical nonsense. One needed to start afresh, to set the standards of meaning, clarity, and argumentation so rigorously that one could rule out from the beginning the Hegelian mode of pseudo philosophizing. As the doctrines of the positivists?and more gen erally the positivist spirit?moved across England and the United States, the verdict was reinforced which had been reached inde pendently by James, Russell, and Moore. None of these attacks on Hegel were directed primarily at his social and political philosophy. It was his metaphysics, the holistic thrust of his thinking, and his philosophic method (or lack of it) that were taken to be so objectionable. But with the appearance of Karl Popper's The Open Society and Its Enemies in 1946, the prejudices of liberal Anglo-American thinkers were confirmed. Even if they had not read Hegel, Popper presumably had, and he had shown once and for all that Hegel's doctrines led directly to the closed totali tarian society which was the very antithesis of what was best and most cherished in the liberal tradition. These several vehement reactions to Hegel?the triumph of pragmatism, the new forms of analysis practiced by Russell and Moore, the growing influence of the positivist movement, and the at tack by Popper?complemented and reinforced each other. A genera tion of American and British philosophers were taught that Hegel represented the excesses and emptiness of speculative philosophy.</page><page sequence="7">WHY HEGEL NOW? 35 He was now thoroughly discredited in favor of new demands for unpretentious meticulous analysis. I recall vividly that when I first studied Hegel in the early 1950's, the prevailing professional opinion in America was that one was either a fool or a madman (or both) to think that Hegel was an important philosopher. It would be naive to suggest that all this has changed. Old entrenched attitudes die hard, and the mention of Hegel can still evoke abuse and snickers in many professional philosophic circles. II How then are we to account for the revival of interest in Hegel? What, if anything, does it tell us about our present situation in philosophy? What is there that is still "alive" in Hegel and relevant to contemporary philosophic discussions? Walter Kaufmann (whose own translations and writings on Hegel have helped to combat prevalent myths about Hegel and to make his work more accessible) has recently offered the following explanation: First, Hegel is immensely interesting. Once that was shown, many academics with widely different interests found it worth their while to study him and write on him. Secondly, he provides a striking alternative to all kinds of positivism and to the mainstream of Anglo American philosophy. Thirdly, the immense growth of interest in Hegel reflects student interests. All three factors also help to account for the extraordinary growth of interest in Nietzsche. But in Hegel's case we must add a fourth point: the explosion of interest in Marx.12 The trouble with this "explanation" is that it doesn't really explain, or at best merely scratches the surface. Hegel is "immensely interesting" and there have always been some thinkers who have recognized this. But the quality of being "interesting" is not simply an intrinsic property of a philosopher's work, but reflects the interests of those who study and write about him. What then are these new interests? And why Hegel, rather than some other thinker, like Plotinus, who is also "immensely interesting?" True enough, Hegel is a striking alternative to all kinds of positivism, but what accounts for the growing intellectual need for such an alternative, and why this one? No doubt students in many places have organized their own study groups and demanded that Hegel be taught, but why? Many 12 Walter Kaufmann, "Coming to Terms with Hegel," Times Literary Supplement, January 2, 1976, p. 13.</page><page sequence="8">36 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN have been led to Hegel through the fascination with Marx, but this only pushes the issue back one step further. Why the explosion of interest in Marx? I think we can penetrate more deeply than Kaufmann does. Consider Kaufmann's last two points: student interest and the re vival of Marx. There have been many attempts to account for the international student activism and protest during the nineteen sixties ?ranging from those who see it as a result of permissive child train ing to those who want to classify it as one of those periodic outbursts of energy of the young against the old. But if we focus on the self-understanding that some of the more articulate members of the New Left had of themselves, they were protesting against the cool inhumanity, the latent violence, the systematic insensitivity to the plight of the poor and oppressed, the disparity between the American dream and the underlying social reality, and the self-destructive artificiality of so much of contemporary life in advanced technological societies. There was a strong moral and even moralistic tone to their protest. There was a deep sense of revulsion against mainstream intellectual orientations which had become so entrenched in academic institutions. For these orientations did not provide an adequate basis for understanding what was going on in society, or offer any guidance for changing it. The "official" liberalism of so many academics seemed to be perfectly compatible with a "do nothing" policy about the roots of social injustice. It seemed to many that the sacred cows of aca demic life?"objectivity," "impartiality," and "value-neutrality"? were in fact value-saturated and vehicles for an ideology that failed to recognize itself as an ideology. And finally, in the name of increas ing "rationality," society seemed to be heading in a direction that was hopelessly irrational. It is in this context that Marx was redis covered by young radicals. But the Marx who was rediscovered and spoke directly to contemporary concerns was not the Marx whose views had become dogmatized by communist ideologists. Rather it was the humanistic strain in Marx, which emphasized that bourgeois society is based upon and furthers alienation and exploitation, that struck such a resonant chord. It was Marx who spoke of revolu tionary praxis and demanded human emancipation that was found so appealing. To the extent that Marx himself was actually read and studied, it was the twenty-six-year-old Marx who had written the 1844 Paris manuscripts, who became the new cultural hero. Marx ap peared to provide what tired liberal formulas failed to provide?an</page><page sequence="9">WHY HEGEL NOW? 37 orientation, a set of categories for coming to grips with the deep internal conflicts and contradictions of advanced capitalist societies, and?many believed?a basis for changing the world through revolu tionary praxis. Against their professors who confidently reassured them that Marx was dead and had been empirically refuted, many students saw Marx as more alive and relevant than ever. Gradually, it was not just Marx who was being rediscovered and reinterpreted, but also a tradition of Western Marxism that had been scarcely known in the Anglo-American world. One of the keys for understanding the im mense popularity of Marcuse at the height of student activism was the way in which he became an entr?e into Marx. With the translations of Luk?cs, Korsch, the Frankfurt School, Gramsci, and others, it was increasingly appreciated that there had been a long and vital tradition of Marxism which had stressed the same themes that cap tured the imagination of so many young radicals. There was a com mon theme running through many of these variants of Marxism? the emphasis placed on the Hegelian origins of Marxism. After reading Luk?cs, Marcuse, Adorno, Horkheimer, no one could think of Hegel as a simpleminded idealist who had everything upside down. To gain a deep understanding of Marx, one had to "take on" Hegel. This is true even of the countermovement to the so-called Hegel ianized reading of Marx most forcefully represented by Althusser and his associates. Getting clear about the relation of Hegel and Marx is much more than an interesting scholarly exercise. It has political and practical consequences. It has become a means for clari fying what one takes to be essential and still alive in Marxism. Gradually, then, as in the title of George Lichtheim's last collec tion of articles, there has been a movement of thought, From Marx to Hegel. This movement itself reflects?as Lichtheim perceptively observed?how after an initial frustration about "changing the world" there has been a growing need for a deeper and more penetrating interpretation of the world. These factors?the cultural source of student interest, the revival of Marxism as a live option, and the study of Hegel in order to deepen and clarify one's grasp of Marx?were all external to mainstream currents in analytic Anglo-American philosophy. Up until the early nineteen sixties, there were scarcely any philosophy departments in the Anglo-American world dealing with Hegel and Marx. There is still a prevailing cynical attitude that it is permis</page><page sequence="10">38 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN sible to teach Marx and Hegel to attract undergraduate students, but not quite respectable for serious graduate study. But there are also internal factors in the development of analytic philosophy that are creating a more favorable climate for the study of Hegel. One of the primary reasons for the revival of any philosopher is the realization that there is a basic affinity between the prob lems that are in the foreground of current philosophic discussion and those with which the relevant philosopher was struggling. Thus, in the early days of logical positivism, the one philosopher singled out as worthy of study was Hume. Hume was read (or more often misread) as a proto-positivist?as seeing through a glass darkly what logical positivists saw so clearly. Or, to put the issue from their own perspective, logical positivists claimed that the dramatic ad vances in logic now enabled them to carry out a program that Hume and other empiricists had struggled to articulate. When conceptual analysis replaced the dominance of the reductive analysis of earlier logical positivists and logical atomists, Kant replaced Hume as a source of inspiration. Strawson's commentary, for example, has the clear intention of salvaging what he takes to be worthwhile in Kant and showing its affinity with the "newer" form of conceptual analysis. Wilfrid Sellars, who has presented his philosophic position by com menting on Kantian themes, remarked a few years ago "... now that philosophy has gone 'back to Kant' for the second time, can a Hegelian 'trip' be far behind?"13 There is something much more serious at stake than the faddish revival of past philosophers. I can show this by turning to a field of inquiry that initially might seem to be quite remote from Hegel: contemporary philosophy of science. The philosophy of science in our time is more than a subspeciality of philosophy. It has become the locus of some of the most exciting and controversial epistemological and metaphysical disputes. The field is alive with controversy and strident polemics but, in this con text, I want to stress a number of common themes in what Mary Hesse has called the postempiricist philosophy and history of science.14 13 Wilfrid Sellars, "The Double-Knowledge Approach to the Mind Body Problem," The New Scholasticism, 45 (1971), p. 270. 14 Mary Hesse, "In Defence of Objectivity," Proceedings of the British Academy, Vol. 58 (London: Oxford University Press, 1972).</page><page sequence="11">WHY HEGEL NOW? 39 First, there is common agreement that the "image of science" projected and endorsed by early logical positivists and empiricists is not only simplistic but distortive of the nature of science. The facile distinctions between observation and theory, the context of discovery and the context of justification; between historical issues and philosophic issues about science; between science as activity and science as knowledge break down under close scrutiny. Whatever value these distinctions have in illuminating science, they cannot be taken as hard and fast dichotomies. Secondly, there has been a much greater emphasis on the need to "look and see" how science actually works. This means studying case histories and classic instances of scientific change in order to clarify philosophic issues about science. One reason why the history of science has become so important for philosophers of science is because of the realization that all attempts to specify the criteria for scientific verification, falsification, or confirmation, which are ab stracted from historical context, have ended in failure. Thirdly, the motor force of scientific change?anomalies; con flict; the clash of one paradigm, theory, or research program over against another?has come to play a prominant role in understand ing science. Fourthly, (although this is one of the most hotly debated issues) there is a growing consensus that many of our traditional concep tions of rationality are simply inadequate to illuminate the sense in which scientific activity is (or is not) a rational activity, and there are gropings toward developing a more adequate theory of rationality. Fifthly, until recently, philosophers have paid little or no atten tion to the social context in which science takes place and the social consequences of science, but this is becoming an issue of much greater concern. Here, too, it was once thought that epistemological issues concerning the nature of science and empirical issues concerning the sociology of science could be neatly separated and assigned to different disciplines, but the distinction has become increasingly criticized and blurred. Every one of these themes and new emphases has a parallel with Hegel. I do not think this can be explained by any sort of direct influence. Rather, I am claiming that there has been an internal dialectic within the philosophy of science which has brought us to a point where we can recognize the deep affinities with Hegel's orientation toward the growth and development of knowledge. There</page><page sequence="12">40 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN are even some philosophers, like Paul Feyerabend, who have shocked their colleagues by emphasizing this affinity.15 If I am right that the philosophy of science is representative of much more general and pervasive epistemological and metaphysi cal themes, then we ought to find the same type of turning in these areas of philosophic inquiry. A sympathetic reader of the first part of Hegel5s Phenomenology, viz., Consciousness (Beumsstsein), who makes the appropriate translations, discovers a remarkable parallel between the stages of development that Hegel portrays and the actual historical development of analytic epistemology in the twen tieth century. Hegel begins the Phenomenology with the portrayal of sense certainty. This corresponds to attempts by early phe nomenalists to ground all empirical knowledge in discrete sense data which we presumably know by direct acquaintance. Many of the reasons advanced for exposing the defects of phenomenalism and for showing the failures of reductive analysis correspond to the reasons that Hegel gives for the necessity to pass beyond this stage of sense certainty. There is even a correspondence between the way in which the appeal to material objects or the "thing language" superseded phenomenalism, and Hegel's analysis of how the stage of perception supersedes sense certainty. This stage in the develop ment of analytic epistemology also led to internal conflicts and prob lems. Transcending the split that took place among analytic philoso phers between those who favored the techniques of ordinary or con ceptual analysis and those who favored the construction and recon struction of artificial languages and formal systems, there was a shared agreement that to focus on the single term or even the iso lated sentence as the basic epistemological unit or building block was inadequate. One needed to take a more holistic approach in which the "language game" or the "conceptual framework" was treated as primary and fundamental. This third stage corresponds to what Hegel calls "Understanding." A close reading of this chapter reveals how many of the arguments that have been developed to show how and in what sense language games and conceptual schemes must be taken as primary were anticipated by Hegel. Even this stage of philosophic inquiry is unstable. The very talk of alternative con ceptual schemes or frameworks seems to make sense only if we pre suppose that there is a "world" or a "given" which can be under 15 Paul Feyerabend, Against Method (London: NLB, 1975).</page><page sequence="13">WHY HEGEL NOW? 41 stood or known in alternative ways. As some philosophers, such as Rorty, have shrewedly argued, the very distinction between a "something" that is known and the various ways of knowing it? which has its roots in the Kantian problematic?is incompatible with the devastating attacks on the "myth of the given."16 As long as we stay within a quasi-Kantian framework, there seems to be no satisfactory way of dealing with the question: what is the "it" or the "world" that is known via alternative conceptual schemes? What sense can even be given to the notion of an "alternative" conceptual scheme? Rorty himself, who focuses on this difficulty, recognizes that what he is claiming sounds very much like Hegel. Hegel, of course, was not struggling with the problems of alternative con ceptual schemes as they have been treated by contemporary analytic philosophers, but he was perhaps the most brilliant and ruthless critic of the latent ambiguity in Kant which is the origin of this contemporary dilemma. Hegel argued?rightly, I believe?that Kant cannot have his cake and eat it too, that one cannot at once insist that there is a given or an unsynthesized manifold that grounds all phenomenal knowledge and insist that what plays this vital episte mological role is intrinsically nonconceptual and unknowable in itself (because all knowledge involves synthesis). This is closely related to the instability of claiming that there must be a Ding-an-sich that grounds all phenomenal knowledge, but that we cannot know anything about this Ding-an-sich. I do not think that these parallels between Hegel and the devel opment of analytic epistemology are happy coincidences?or moves in the tiresome game of showing how between any two thinkers or philosophic movements there are always some points of similarity. Rather, I believe that Hegel had a profound insight into the dialecti cal movement of thought, and an uncanny ability to show how various positions or "shapes of consciousness" harbor internal conflicts which require us to pass beyond them. The actual historical development of analytic philosophy exhibits this dialectical movement.17 Further more, while analytic philosophers have not been (in the main) directly influenced by Hegel, over and over again one discovers that the 16 Richard Rorty, "The World Well Lost," Journal of Philosophy, 69 (1972), pp. 649-665. 17 See also Charles Taylor, "The Opening Arguments of the Phe nomenology," in Hegel, (ed.) Alasdair Maclntyre (New York: Doubleday Anchor, 1972).</page><page sequence="14">42 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN arguments and strategies employed to show why some earlier posi tion is unsatisfactory are similar to those employed by Hegel. In addition to the philosophy of science, and analytic episte mology, there is another central area of analytic philosophy in which we have begun to see the relevance of Hegel. This is the theory of action. By the theory of action, I do not mean anything so neat as a hypothetical-deductive system that purports to explain human action, but the philosophic reflection on the description and explana tion of action, how action is to be distinguished from physical move ment, the relation of the concept of action to meaning, purpose, intention, motive, reason, and cause. In another context, I have attempted to give an account of how and why the theory of action has become so important in analytic philosophy and to indicate how the changing views on action reflect and are intimately tied up with the development of analytic philosophy.18 But here, I want to men tion two major contributions to this discussion: Charles Taylor's The Explanation of Behaviour, and George H. Von Wright's Explana tion and Understanding. Both of these studies have sought to defend the autonomy and nonreducibility of the teleological explanation of human action. Both have been concerned to show the implications of the analysis of action for clarifying the nature and function of the social disciplines. Both have emphasized the similarities between post-Wittgensteinian discussions of action and the tradition of her meneutics in continental philosophy. Although Taylor argues his case employing the analytic idiom, Hegel hovers in the background of his work. Von Wright, who is among the most respected and eminent analytic philosophers of our time, introduces his study of explanation and understanding with a review of the two main com peting traditions concerned with the "conditions an explanation has to satisfy in order to be scientifically respectable": the Aristotelian and the Galilean. Von Wright says the following about Hegel: ... it seems to me true to say that Hegel is the great renewer? after the Middle Ages and therefore in opposition to the platonizing spirit of Renaissance and Baroque science?of an aristotelian tradition in the philosophy of method. For Hegel, as for Aristotle, the idea of law is primarily that of an intrinsic connection to be grasped through reflective understanding, not that of an inductive generalization es tablished by experiment. . . . For both philosophers, explanation 18 See Part IV, "The Concept of Action," in Praxis and Action (Phila delphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1971).</page><page sequence="15">WHY HEGEL NOW? 43 consists in making phenomena teleologically intelligible rather than predictable from knowledge of their efficient causes.19 The importance and relevance of Hegel for the theory of action is not that he obscurely said something that vaguely resembles what is now being said by some analytic philosophers. Rather, con temporary philosophers have come to appreciate the difficulties and distortions that result from the attempt to impose a Galilean model of the explanation of action (a model which in our time has taken the canonical form of a deductive-nomological schema). In attempt ing to account for what is distinctive about human action (or at least some types of human action), it is necessary to examine the ways in which actions themselves are constituted by rules, practices, and institutions. Understanding rules and practices is itself essential for the description and explanation of (human) actions. Few philoso phers have equaled Hegel in the passion with which he argued that the character and dynamics of human action must be understood within the context of intersubjective interactions. Furthermore, Hegel focuses on issues which have only begun to be asked by analytic philosophers, although these issues are highlighted by their own analyses. For if there are inter subjective rules and practices that are constitutive of human actions, then it becomes essential to gain some understanding of how such practices emerge, what sus tains them, and how they pass away. These are the very issues that are in the foreground of Hegel's philosophy. While contemporary analytic philosophy was originally based on a total rejection and repudiation of Hegel, the internal development of the closely knit dialectic in the philosophy of science, analytic epistemology, and the theory of action has brought us to a stage in which we can recognize more than superficial resemblances with Hegel?the very issues that are now at the center of discussion are those with which Hegel was struggling. Furthermore, in each of these three areas, the types of difficulties that have brought us closer to the Hegelian problematic are similar. For in each area it is problems dealing with process and change?whether scientific change or conceptual change, or changes in the practices that are constitutive of actions?that have required philosophers to ask in a new way the very questions that Hegel poses. 19 Georg H. von Wright, Explanation and Understanding (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1971), p. 8.</page><page sequence="16">44 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN Thus far I have dealt with some of the external and internal reasons for the renaissance of Hegel. But there are two other fac tors?which, although difficult to pin down, are no less important. One of the deep convictions of many analytic philosophers has been that the proper way to do philosophy is by piecemeal analysis. If we are serious about clarifying, solving, and dissolving problems, then this can only be accomplished if we are modest in our ambi tions and careful about details. The motto has virtually been: In order to conquer we must divide and subdivide. Such an attitude is based upon the presupposition that we can isolate discrete phil osophic problems and make progress in solving them. Indeed, part of the rhetorical force of the term "analysis" has been to insist on this new way of philosophizing. But the consequence of the serious attempt to carry out such a project has frequently been the very opposite of what was intended. This is not to say that analytic philosophy is based on a mistake or has ended in failure. But in the relentless pursuit of what might initially seem to be a single and discrete issue, our analyses spill over to other issues and other domains. We cannot make much progress on epistemological issues unless we squarely confront metaphysical issues; if we want to get clear about reference and denotation, we must also deal with ontol ogy; whether we start with problems in the theory of knowledge or the theory of value, we discover how we are forced to get clear about problems in what might initially seem to be remote domains. It is commonly thought?this is one of the myths about Hegel ?that his primary concern was with a global approach to philosophy. But the truth is that he always demanded specificity or what he called concreteness (this is not to say that he always practiced what he preached). Only when we attempt to be absolutely specific and deal with what is determinate do we come to the realization that carrying out such a project necessitates a movement to a more gen eral or synoptic perspective. The actual development of analytic philosophy bears out one of Hegel's most important and central claims. Some contemporary philosophers, such as Wilfrid Sellars, have self-consciously made this very same point?that there is a per fectly legitimate sense in which clarifying or solving a single problem in philosophy demands that progress be made on all relevant phil osophic issues. Philosophers are learning or relearning a lesson that Hegel taught so brilliantly. Few philosophers have been so critical of the type of abstract general claims that lack determinateness and</page><page sequence="17">WHY HEGEL NOW? 45 specificity. This is the primary defect of knowledge that Hegel called Understanding (Verstand), which is to be contrasted with the con crete, determinate knowledge of Reason (Vernunft). If something is true, then it must be shown to be true in detail, it must be pursued in all its determinateness and specificity. It is only by attempting to carry out such a project that one comes to grasp what is genuinely universal. Hegel, then, would not have opposed the spirit that animates so much of analytic philosophy; he would have endorsed it. The growing realization, which is now being experienced by many analytic philosophers, of the defects of piecemeal analysis and the necessity to explore the dialectical web of interrelations among what initially appear to be discrete and separable issues is precisely what is to be expected. The final consideration that I want to discuss in answering the question, "Why Hegel Now?" has to do with our present cultural experience. Philosophers?especially analytic philosophers?are resistant to, and suspicious of, any attempt to approach philo sophic activity from the perspective of the cultural context within which it is practiced. To do so seems to raise the muddy issues of the sociology of knowledge and to confuse historical and philo sophic issues. But it is more than an empty truism that in addi tion to being professional philosophers, we are also living in and influenced by our historical situation. Enlightenment ideals about the efficacy of reason in clarifying and helping us to solve social and political problems?ideals which have shaped so much of modern thought?are becoming increas ingly thin and unconvincing. Hegel wrote at a time when many of the tendencies that have shaped the contemporary world were be ginning to become manifest. He was perhaps unduly optimistic about the power of reason and Spirit to resolve the latent contradic tions that characterized social, political, and cultural life. But Hegel did provide us with an incisive, penetrating analysis of the conflicts, dilemmas, and tensions that became manifest in the post-French revolutionary period. Although many of his claims about civil society and the state are outdated, nevertheless contemporary societies have not resolved the conflicts and crises that he detected. These have become at once sharper and more confused. Hegel, in his pen etrating description of the dynamics of modern society, was one of the first to describe the inherent conflicts and instability of the forces, institutions, and practices that have shaped modern society. So,</page><page sequence="18">46 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN even if we reject Hegel's "solutions," there is still much to be learned from him in our own attempts to comprehend the cultural conflicts and crises of our own time.20 Ill Charles Taylor has written the most ambitious book on Hegel which has yet appeared in English.21 In its 580 pages, he seeks to explore the aims of Hegel's epoch; to sketch his intellectual de velopment; to provide an overview of Hegel's most central concept ?self-positing Spirit; to explicate and evaluate the Phenomenology, Logic, and Hegel's contributions to the study of objective and abso lute spirit, including history, politics, art, religion, and philosophy; and to conclude with a discussion of the relevance of Hegel today. There are few philosophers who are as qualified to write a definitive study of Hegel which will speak to the concerns of contemporary Anglo-American philosophers. Taylor was trained at Oxford during the period of post-Wittgenstein philosophy when the theory of action was becoming a dominant concern. He has a fine grasp of contem porary continental philosophy. His own contributions to social and political thought have focused on Hegelian themes that have become central as a result of the internal dialectic of contempory discussions. Yet the total effect of this book is confusing. Despite its length, one frequently has the sense of being rushed through com plex issues. At times the style is frenetic. The major source of these difficulties is not only Taylor's attempt to cover so much ground but also his combining of so many different types of scholarly ap 20 See Shlomo Avineri, Hegel's Theory of the Modern State (Cam bridge: Cambridge University Press, 1972). Avineri concludes his study by declaring: "Nothing in what has been said until now should be con strued to imply that the answers Hegel gave to the other questions raised by him should always be regarded as satisfactory or adequate. But the ability to ask the right kind of questions about the nature of post-1789 society and to incorporate them into a general philosophical system, as well as the realization that consequently classical political theory stands in need of rectification and renaissance?all this makes Hegel into more than a mere chapter in the history of ideas. His questions?if not always his answers?point to the direction of understanding that which is, today as much as in his own time" (p. 241). 21 Charles Taylor, Hegel (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975).</page><page sequence="19">WHY HEGEL NOW? 47 proaches in a single volume?ranging from essays in the history of ideas to detailed commentaries on obscure passages. It is not a book that will satisfy scholars of Hegel, because Taylor glosses over knotty issues. But contrary to Taylor's primary intention of making Hegel accessible and intelligible to those who have not studied Hegel care fully, his study may have the effect of confirming the biases of those who think that Hegel is sloppy, careless, and arbitrary. Yet there is a great deal here that is fresh, original, and sound. It would be a great pity if the virtues of Taylor's interpretation were ignored because of some of the defects of this book. Although there are unifying themes that run through this study, I suggest that it can be more profitably read as a series of loosely related essays or lec tures on Hegel. Indeed, I do not think we are confronted with a single book, but with the material that might have served as a basis for half a dozen books on Hegel. In my critical discussion, I want first to consider some of the perplexities raised by Taylor's analysis, and then turn to its major contributions. The first part of this book, "The Claims of Speculative Reason," is divided into three chapters: "Aims of a New Epoch," "Hegel's Itinerary," and "Self-positing Spirit. " To understand the unity of this part, we must appreciate how Taylor structures his analysis. He seeks to delineate "a central problem, which insistently demanded solution of the thinkers of this time" (p. 3) to explore why it became so urgent, how some of Hegel's contemporaries struggled with and failed to solve it, how this problem itself underwent transformation in the course of Hegel's intellectual development ("Hegel's Itiner ary"), and finally how Hegel's concept of self-positing Spirit was intended to provide a comprehensive and adequate solution to it. The problem "concerned the nature of human subjectivity and its relation to the world. It was a problem of uniting two seemingly indispensable images of man, which on the one level had deep affini ties with each other, and yet could not but appear utterly incom patible" (p. 3). Taylor organizes his discussion in a typically Hegelian fashion; he locates a deep tension, a basic incompatibility or contradiction that Hegel's own philosophy?in particular, the idea of self-positing Spirit?was intended to resolve. Taylor does what Hegel himself tells us must be done if we are genuinely to comprehend a philosophic position?to explore how it grows out of, reflects, and seeks to re solve the deepest cultural conflicts and aspirations of its own time.</page><page sequence="20">48 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN Performing this task for Hegel is especially important because Anglo-American philosophers are almost totally ignorant of the cultural and intellectual context in which Hegel's thought was formed ?that post-Kantian period in German thought that was shaped by Herder, Goethe, Lessing, Fichte, and Schelling. In order to specify the problem and the source of the incom patibility of the competing images of man, Taylor presents a broad sketch of a three-stage model of changing conceptions of human subjectivity?of changes in the basic categories by which we under stand the self. The first stage has its roots in classical thought and persists through the Middle Ages. The central theme of this classical understanding of the self is that the entire universe, includ ing the individual self, expresses or reflects a cosmic order of Ideas. The subject is defined in relation to this cosmic order, and conse quently self-knowledge or self-presence is identified with attaining a rational vision of the cosmic order. The world itself is understood to be intrinsically meaningful (for it expresses this cosmic order), and it can be approached as a text in which the philosophic task is to decipher and comprehend this cosmic order. According to Taylor, although the modern conception of the self was already foreshadowed by the Epicureans and the Skeptics, it really came into its own in the seventeenth century. What seemed so plausible and rational from a classical point of view was now seen as a form of indulgence and distortive anthropomorphism?a pro jection of human teleological meanings onto a world which is essen tially non-teleological and devoid of any intrinsic meaning. This is the age of the great dualisms where, in one form or another, the human subject is contrasted with an "objective" order that is devoid of meaning and purpose, and which can best be understood as func tioning according to mechanistic laws. Taylor characterizes this modern conception of the subject as "self-defining." Corresponding to this view of the self is the conception of the world as "objectified," or "disenchanted." This modern philosophical anthropology which culminates in the Enlightenment was the point of attack "of the two major tendencies in German thought whose reconciliation was the key problem of Hegel's generation" (p. 11). On the one hand, there was the groping toward a new conception of the self which would overcome the onto logical and epistemological dichotomies that plagued so much of modern thought?a new anthropology that Taylor labels "expr?s</page><page sequence="21">WHY HEGEL NOW? 49 sivism." There is a danger of misreading this movement of thought as a return to a classical position, but Taylor argues that to do so is to miss its distinctiveness and power. Using Herder as an ex emplar of expressivism, Taylor claims that not only was a new con ception of the self being developed, but a new sense of "expression" which is closely related to the "sense in which we speak of expres sion as giving vent to, a realizing in external reality of something we feel or desire" (p. 14). Expression here is not something that is accidentally or incidentally related to what is being expressed. It is the embodiment of what is expressed; it at once determines and clarifies what is expressed. Taylor argues that this new orienta tion leads to a new theory of language and art, and a new apprecia tion of the centrality of language and art for understanding the human subject. Neither language nor art are to be interpreted from the point of view of how they represent or refer to the world, but rather from the perspective of how they express and realize human life. The thrust of this expressivist orientation is of primary importance for understanding Hegel for three reasons: it is strongly anti-dualist, it makes freedom as authentic self-expression a central value of human life, and it contains an inspiration toward a union and harmony with nature that was jeopardized by the Enlightenment. On the other hand, there was another powerful reaction against the modern dichotomy of a "self-defining" subject confronting an "objective" world. Originally, the self was conceived of (in Descartes, for example) as standing over and against an objective physical world; it was categorically distinct from such a world. But the tendency toward objectification threatened the autonomy of the self. What grounds, if any, are there for thinking that the human subject is not just another part of an objective world?a complex physical system differing in degree and not in kind from other physical sys tems? It is this threat to the autonomy of the self that Kant so brilliantly detected, and one can read much of his philosophy as a serious attempt to meet the challenge posed by the forms of mate rialism and naturalism in order to defend the autonomy and freedom of the moral self. But the price paid by Kant's apologia of moral freedom was a severe one! For Kant's "solution" to the problem of the autonomy of the moral self did not overcome the dualisms of modern philosophy, it required the acceptance of a set of even more rigid dualisms between the theoretical and the practical, between man as moral agent and man as natural being. In short, Kant's under</page><page sequence="22">50 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN Standing of the human subject was in direct contradiction to the expressivist aspirations of the time. The central problem of the epoch became one of finding some successful solution or synthesis of conflicting demands between "radical freedom and integral expression" (p. 43). Hegel differs from his contemporaries because "he pushed to the end in a uniquely consistent way" (p. 43) such a synthesis?a synthesis that demanded postulating a cosmic spirit, who lives as spirit only through indi viduals who express this spirit in their thoughts and deeds. Through this self-expression, individuals realize their own authentic radical freedom. This portrait of changing conceptions of human subjectivity and of the problem that became so pressing in Hegel's time is sug gestive and helpful for gaining a purchase on what Hegel is "up to." Taylor's description of expressivism can serve as a heuristic device for making that leap into Hegel's world. Using Taylor's schema, we may say that much of analytic philosophy operates in a framework that shows far more affinity with Taylor's second stage of understanding human subjectivity than with expressivism. In deed, while expressivism affected the literary movement of Romanti cism, it has had only a marginal influence on mainstream currents in Anglo-American philosophy. But Taylor's sketch of changing conceptions of human subjec tivity is also quite elusive and raises a number of troubling issues. It would be ungenerous to demand more precision of Taylor's intro ductory sketch than is warranted. But even with this proviso, it does not seem quite right. For example, to characterize the modern understanding of the subject as "self-defining" is not only mislead ing, but appears to be mistaken. For all their differences, Descartes, Locke, Hume, and indeed most seventeenth and eighteenth century thinkers did not think of the human subject as seZf-defining. The self or subject has a nature, structure, or at least a set of fixed mental capacities. The philosophic task became one of stating what these faculties or capacities are, and how they could enable us to understand the nature and limits of human knowledge. It is not apre-Hegelian, but a posi-Hegelian theme that questions this frame work assumption, and raises the possibility that the self creates or defines what it is. It is only with Nietzsche, Kierkegaard, and later with Sartre, that such a conception of the self is fully articulated. Or, even more important, consider what Taylor has to say about</page><page sequence="23">WHY HEGEL NOW? 51 expressivism. He seeks to distinguish it from classical conception of the human subject, but I do not think he is always successful in pinning down just what is the central difference. He says, for example: To talk about the realization of a self here is to say that the adequate human life would not just be a fulfillment of an idea or plan which is fixed independently of the subject who realizes it, as is the Aris totelian form of a man. Rather this life must have the added dimen sion that the subject can recognize it as his own, as having unfolded from within him. This self-related dimension is entirely missing from the Aristotelian tradition (p. 15). Not only does this seem to be a caricature of Aristotle, but it reveals that when Taylor contrasts expressivism with the classical conception of the self he is thinking primarily of the tradition of theoria and the self engaging in the journey of attaining theoretical knowledge. Much of what Taylor says about expressivism can be used to illumi nate what Aristotle meant by praxis, the form of activity involved in leading a virtuous life. Taylor ignores or slights the tradition that Aristotle himself initiated in his characterization of phronesis and practical wisdom, a tradition reflected in Cicero, the great period of classical rhetoric, and in Vico (who has been read as a progenitor of "modern expressivism"). Consider how Taylor's claims about ex pressivism can be used to clarify what Aristotle means by virtuous activity. Thus the notion of human life as expression sees this not only as the realization of purposes but also as the clarification of these purposes. It is not only the fulfillment of life but also the clarification of mean ing. In the course of living adequately, I not only fulfil my humanity but clarify what my humanity is about (p. 17). My intention is not to argue that there are some notable ex ceptions to Taylor's three-stage model, or to suggest that one can tell a very different story about changing conceptions of human sub jectivity. Rather, my primary point is that I do not think that Taylor has succeeded in doing what he has set out to do, viz., to clarify precisely what is distinctive about these different conceptions of human subjectivity. It is to Taylor's credit that he does not flinch from taking the notion of "self-positing Spirit" as Hegel's most central theme. He boldly attempts to show that we can make sense of what Hegel is saying without succumbing to the temptation of thinking that Spirit is some non-substantial mystical force, or simply a mystified way of</page><page sequence="24">52 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN speaking about species being or humanity. In explicating what Hegel means by Spirit and the role that it plays, it is absolutely essential to clarify what Hegel means by necessity. As Taylor properly emphasizes, Hegel consistently claims that Spirit must necessarily embody itself, and that the dialectical process by which Spirit realizes itself involves necessity. But what precisely does Hegel mean by necessity? Here, one might think there would be an excellent opportunity to show how Hegel's understanding of necessity is related to the current interest in necessity by analytic philosophers. But although Taylor has a great deal to say about necessity, and returns to the theme over and over again, we do not find a clear analysis of the meaning (or meanings) of necessity in Hegel. Taylor's most focused discussion of necessity as it pertains to Geist occurs in his chapter of "Self-positing Spirit." He tells us that "starting from finite reality, Hegel claims to be able to demon strate the existence of a cosmic spirit who posits the world accord ing to rational necessity" (p. 97). But this is not Hegel's ultimate starting point, for "the existence of this finite reality can itself be demonstrated" (p. 98). So we are led to speak of the "Hegelian circle of necessity" which, according to Taylor, has nothing to do with circular argument. There is an "ascending dialectic from a finite reality" (p. 98), and the circle is closed "by showing that this finite reality neces sarily exists. 'Necessity' has a different meaning in the two phases" (p. 99). In the ascending dialectic, the necessity is one of the "neces sity of inference" but in the descending dialectic the notion of neces sity is changed: "It is ontological necessity" (p. 99). Summing up, Taylor writes: Our ascending movement thus starts with a postulate and pro ceeds by necessary inference. But what it infers to is ontological necessity, the proposition that everything which exists is posited by Geist according to a formula of rational necessity. The circle is thus not a single stream of inferences. Rather it involves a reversal of starting point. We begin with the ascending movement which is the movement of discovery. Our starting point is finite existence which is first in the order of discovery. But what we reveal is a perva sive ontological necessity, and this shows that our original starting point is really secondary. Finite reality is itself posited by Geist, God, the Absolute. This is the real starting point in the order of being (p. 99). Taylor is raising some of the most controversial issues in philos ophy. For when he speaks of the "necessity of inference" in the</page><page sequence="25">WHY HEGEL NOW? 53 ascending dialectic, he is alluding to a type of transcendental argu ment. Characterizing precisely what is involved in transcendental arguments and determining whether there can be legitimate philo sophic arguments that take this form has proven to be one of the most intractable problems in contemporary philosophy. Further more, for many philosophers, the very notion of ontological necessity seems to be a category mistake or absurdity. But what is most disturbing in Taylor's presentation is that he fails to clarify or analyze what is meant by "necessity" when we speak of the necessity of inference or ontological necessity. When Taylor discusses necessity in the context of the Logic, he effectively criticizes some of the stand ard misinterpretations of what Hegel means. But a positive elucida tion of this central and slippery concept still eludes us. Through out the book we are confronted with a bewildering variety of the uses of this slippery concept. Taylor speaks of "real necessity," "absolute necessity," "unconditioned necessity," necessity which is "self-conditioned," "external necessity," the "truth of necessity," "free necessity," etc. The lack of clarity about the meaning (meanings) of necessity is not a localized difficulty. It affects Taylor's analysis of the Phenome nology and the Logic. After Taylor concludes his outline of what Hegel means by self-positing Spirit, he tells us that it is not suffi cient to present Hegel's system; it must be demonstrated, for "its only adequate presentation is a demonstration" (p. 122). "A demon stration must be able to take us from our ordinary understanding of things, and show that this is untenable, that it must give way to Hegel's vision of things" (p. 122, italics added). Taylor then turns to exploring the three primary routes or demonstrations that we find in Hegel: the Phenomenology, the Logic, and that which "occupies the philosophy of nature and the philosophy of spirit" (p. 122). In speaking of these demonstrations, Taylor is clearly employ ing the notion of necessity. Yet when we turn to what he actually does, he seems virtually to abandon any claim to necessity. Thus in the Phenomenology, as we follow what Hegel called the highway of despair, we presumably follow the stages or the forms of conscious ness which begins with natural consciousness and culminates in abso lute knowledge. Although almost one hundred pages of Taylor's book deal with the Phenomenology, one is left with a confusing impression of what he seeks to show. He begins by presenting an overview and then proceeds to what may appear to be an explication of the major sec</page><page sequence="26">54 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN tions of the Phenomenology. But not only is his analysis highly selective, he rapidly skips over large sections o? the Phenomenology. He advances a theory about two different types of dialectic in the Phenomenology: "strict dialectics, whose starting point is or can reasonably claim to be undeniable" (p. 218), and "interpretative or hermeneutical dialectics, which convince us by the overall plausibility of the interpretation they give" (p. 218). It is difficult to discern what principles guide what Taylor does and does not discuss. Taylor does say that the Phenomenology is too rich to go through sys tematically, and tells us "What I should like to do is examine certain sections only which throw light on his position, and simply give the general direction of argument in the others in order to show the movement of the whole work" (p. 140). But then it would seem that Taylor is not seriously interested in explaining and evaluating in what sense the Phenomenology is (or is not) a demonstration. I certainly do not think that a commentator must uncritically accept or identify himself with the position of the philosopher he is explicating. One wants to see what are the crucial strengths and weaknesses. Taylor is frequently acute in both defending and criticizing Hegel. It is clear that he thinks that as a demonstration the Phenomenology fails, although this does not detract from its importance and power. But one would expect that there would be some clear indication of what precisely Hegel thought he was doing in the Phenomenology, and an assessment of the ways in which he fails to fulfill this intention. Taylor does speak to all these issues, but he does so in a way that can be very confusing. It is not always clear whether he is explicating what Hegel said, what Hegel should have said, or what Taylor thinks about a particular issue. While there are a number of brilliant insights about themes and specific discussions in the Phenomenology, Taylor's mode of analysis has the consequence of making the Phenomenology seem like much more of a hodgepodge than it really is. A reader who is unfamiliar with the original would gather the impression that it is a rather disjointed mixture of loosely related discussions that pretend to be connected by a necessary dialectic. What one misses then is a sense of the power, coherence, and thematic consistency of the work. Taylor's almost informal approach to texts, picking up what he thinks is worthy of discussion and playing down or skipping over other sections, is even more disturbing when he turns to his analysis of the Logic. In his preface, Taylor tells us that for "... anyone</page><page sequence="27">WHY HEGEL NOW? 55 who wants to understand how Hegel's philosophy was authenticated in his own eyes and, indeed, how this philosophy and its authentica tion are inseparable for Hegel, the Logic remains indispensible" (p. vii). In the first two hundred pages of this book, Taylor frequently creates the impression that the Logic is the only real candidate for the role of strict dialectical proof. "The Logic is in fact . . . the only strict, self-authenticating dialectic of Hegel's system" (p. 221). But as soon as Taylor begins his analysis?which again is ex tremely perceptive in some of its explications?he doesn't take his own claims seriously. Or rather, it is clear that whatever Hegel thought he was doing, Taylor thinks there are many gaps, unex plained transitions, unwarranted claims about what has been shown. Taylor says, "The Logic thus presents the chain of necessarily con nected concepts which give the conceptual structure of reality" (p. 231). But in commenting on the very first transition in the Logic, Taylor says: But the derivation of Becoming here is not as solid as Dasein. This is the first, but not the last place in the Logic where Hegel will go beyond what is strictly established by his argument because he sees in the relation of concepts a suggestion of his ontology: here the uni versality of movement and becoming in the relation of Being and Non-Being. But of course as probative arguments these passages are unconvincing. They fail, as strict conceptual proof, however persuasive they are as interpretations for those who hold Hegel's view of things on other grounds (p. 233). Taylor does not accept Hegel's own self-understanding of what he was doing, or Hegel's conception of philosophy as system. This is perhaps the clue to why Taylor has so much difficulty in explain ing what Hegel means by necessity. Rather than demonstrations, we find in Hegel an ontological vision which can be supported only with suggestions, indications, and arguments that are best persuasive rather than demonstrable. Many passages in this book indicate that this is Taylor's own understanding of the philosophical enterprise, that philosophy is essentially a hermeneutical discipline which cannot achieve the type of closure that Hegel thought he achieved. Taylor's book would have been far more persuasive if he had clearly stated and defended this view from the very beginning. Then instead of being seduced into thinking that we will find logically tight demon strations, and judging Hegel a miserable failure, we would read Taylor as a guide to what he takes to be powerful interpretative dialectics.</page><page sequence="28">56 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN I essentially agree with Taylor that?despite some of Hegel's manifest claims to the contrary?many of Hegel's arguments are unconvincing, his transitions forced, and perhaps most important a number of his central concepts such as necessity are not clearly articulated and defended. Taylor?unlike some other commentators ?does not gloss over these difficulties. He writes both sympa thetically and critically about Hegel. Nevertheless, I do think that if Taylor had clarified his own point of view from the very beginning, specified his principles of interpretation, and clearly indicated when he is explicating Hegel and when he is criticizing Hegel, then the entire study would have been more forceful and focused. I can approach this difficulty from a slightly different perspective. Taylor's conception of philosophy which emerges from this book and from his other writings is not Hegel's conception of philosophy. Indeed there is a fundamental clash. If we change our own orienta tion, if we reject Hegel's self-understanding of what he is doing, if we make less stringent demands on Hegel's mode of argumentation ?if, in short, we see that Hegel's strength lies in his "interpreta tive dialectics," then a rich terrain opens up to us. Given this in terpretative model of philosophy, we can then turn our attention to assessing the strengths and weaknesses of competing interpretations. While Taylor does not think there can ever be final closure to the hermeneutic process, there can be a rational assessment of con flicting interpretations. Taylor does think this is the most illuminating way of approach ing the Phenomenology. He says that the Phenomenology "is more impressive and persuasive as interpretation of certain passages of political and religious history than it is as argument" (p. 216). Fur thermore, Taylor also thinks this is the proper way to approach the Logic. He sees its force as an "interpretation for those who hold Hegel's view of things." Commenting on what Hegel says about finitude, Taylor writes: We have here a second and much more important case in which Hegel forces his argument beyond what it can strictly yield, and ends up with what is really an interpretation of things powerfully suggestive of his ontology, rather than a strict demonstration of it (p. 23). Once we realize that Taylor himself is engaging in "interpretative or hermeneutical dialectics, which convince us by the overall plaus ibility of the interpretation they give" rather than "strict dialectics, whose starting point is or can reasonably claim to be undeniable,"</page><page sequence="29">WHY HEGEL NOW? 57 then we may read his study in a very different light. We may focus on those themes that Taylor takes to be among Hegel's most im portant and lasting contributions to philosophy. The most pervasive theme, one to which Taylor returns again and again, is that of em bodiment. Consider some of Taylor's representative claims about the meaning and centrality of embodiment. Thus man does more than reflect a nature complete in itself, rather he is the vehicle whereby the cosmic spirit brings to completion a self-expression the first attempts at which lie before us in nature. Just as on the expressivist view man achieves his fulfillment in a form of life which is also an expression of self-awareness. But this is not achieved in some transcendent realm beyond man. If it were, then union with the cosmic spirit would require that man subordinate his will to a higher being, that he accept heteronomy. Rather spirit reaches this self-awareness in man (p. 44). It was a basic principle of Hegel's thought that the subject, and all his functions, however spiritual were inescapably embodied; and this in two related dimensions: as a rational animal that is a living being who thinks; and as an expressive being, that is, a being whose think ing always and necessarily expresses itself in a medium. This principle of necessary embodiment, as we may call it, is central to Hegel's conception of Geist, or cosmic spirit (p. 83). . . . once we see the world as posited by Geist, a spirit whose life is thought, then we see the categories of thought as necessarily em bodied, as 'going over', as it were, into their embodiment (p. 226). To be embodied means to be a particular time and place, and hence to be finite. But finite spirit must go beyond an identification of him self as particular, and this is why the existence of many men and their life together in society plays an essential part. Man is raised to the universal because he already lives beyond himself in a society, whose greater life incorporates his (p. 336). In the Phenomenology, the Logic, and the realms of objective and absolute spirit, Taylor pursues and explores variations on the theme of embodiment. This is the movement from the abstract to the concrete. Embodiment is not a mere filling out of what already exists. It is the process of determination and clarification itself. Not only does Hegel see this process of embodiment working itself out in both history and logic, it is the key to the master strategy which Hegel employs to show how the fundamental dichotomies that have plagued so much of philosophy are to be overcome (aufgehoben). Whether we focus on mind and body, thought and action, form and matter, Hegel in each case seeks to show that these dichotomies are abstract "moments" when they are taken to be separate and distinct. This even applies to the dichotomy of idealism and mate</page><page sequence="30">58 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN rialism. Rather than classifying Hegel as an "idealist," Taylor wants us to see how Hegel overcomes the traditional problematic in which we distinguish idealism from materialism. If idealism is thought of as claiming an ontological primacy for what is spiritual or mental as over against what is physical or material, then Hegel is not an idealist. Spirit or mind is a barren abstraction unless it is concretely em bodied. For Hegel, Spirit must be materialized, and what is taken to stand in opposition to Spirit, whether nature or matter, must itself be permeated by Spirit. By focusing on this theme of embodiment, Taylor suggests a way of seeing the relevance of Hegel to recent developments in analytic philosophy of mind and phenomenology. Both of these movements have attacked the Cartesian framework that has shaped so much of modern philosophy. Both movements, in different ways, stress how language and subjectivity are concretely embodied in the activities that constitute human life. One of the most effective contexts in which Taylor follows out the consequences of the theme of embodiment is in coming to grips with Hegel's social and political philosophy. Some of the best pages in this study deal with the elucidation and significance of what Hegel means by "objective spirit." To grasp what Hegel means by "objective spirit," we must over come the "atomistic prejudices" which have such a powerful hold on us: ". . . when we think of a human being, we do not simply mean a living organism, but a being who can think, feel, decide, be moved, respond, enter into relations with others; and all this implies a lan guage, a related set of ways of experiencing the world, of interpreting his feelings, understanding his relation to others, to the past, the future, the absolute, and so on. It is the particular way he situates himself within this cultural world that we call his identity" (p. 380). Consequently, it is "no extravagant proposition to say that we are what we are in virtue of participating in the larger life of our society" (p. 381). The institutions and practices which make up the public life of a community are not merely external constraints on what we are. For they themselves are expressions of what we are. This, according to Taylor, is the basis for understanding "alienation." Alienation occurs when the norms, as expressed in public practices, cease to hold our allegiance, when there is a growing sense of the disparity of what we take ourselves to be and forms of public life in which we find ourselves. This recurring experience of loss of a</page><page sequence="31">WHY HEGEL NOW? 59 sense of identity and the attempts to find a new form of cultural identity in the community is the story of objective spirit?a story which promises a possibility of a successful identification between the individual and the community. Hegel's "thesis of the primacy of Sittlichkeit, and the related notion of the community as 'ethical sub stance,' " can be expressed "in three propositions, put in ascending order of contestability" (p. 386). "First, that what is most important for man can only be attained in relation to the public life of a community, not in private self-definition of the alienated individual. Second, this community must not be merely a partial one. ... It must be co-terminous with the minimum self-sufficient human reality, the state" (p. 386). And thirdly, "the public life of the state has this crucial importance for man because the norms and ideas it ex presses are not just human inventions. On the contrary, the state expresses the Idea, the ontological structure of things" (p. 386). Taylor finds this last claim to be the most dubious, viz., that man in his political life is "the vehicle of cosmic spirit, and the corol lary, that the state expresses the underlying formula of necessity by which spirit posits the world" (p. 387). Nevertheless, while skeptical of Hegel's "solution," Taylor does think that Hegel has incisively posed a dilemma that still lies at the heart of modern socie ties, especially modern democracies. Thus Hegel's dilemma for modern democracy, put at its simplest, is this: The modern ideology of equality and of total participation leads to a homogenization of society. This shakes men loose from their traditional communities, but cannot replace them as a focus of identity. Or rather, it can only replace them as such a focus under the impetus of militant nationalism or some totalitarian ideology which would depreciate or even crush diversity and individuality (p. 414). . . . one of the great needs of the modern democratic polity is to recover a sense of significant differentiation, so that its partial com munities, be they geographical, or cultural, or occupational, can become again important centres of concern and activity for their members in a way which connects them to the whole (p. 416). It certainly would be a distortion to suggest that Hegel was primarily concerned with the fate of modern democracies. And this is not Taylor's primary point. But the mode of interpretation that he adopts in dealing with Hegel's understanding of social and politi cal reality is one where Taylor is clearly interested in showing how Hegel still "speaks to us," that there is a way of understanding what he has to say about "objective spirit" and Sittlichkeit that</page><page sequence="32">60 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN provides a richer orientation and set of categories for coming to grips with our own attempts to understand and interpret present social and political reality. Hegel scholars may feel uncomfortable with the way in which Taylor departs from Hegel's text, or by the way in which he attempts to "translate" Hegel into a contemporary idiom. But I believe that herein lies Taylor's distinctive strength as an interpreter. For in dealing with Hegel's social and political philos ophy, Taylor approaches Hegel not primarily as a self-effacing com mentator, but rather as a philosopher engaged in dialogue with another philosopher?seeking to show what we may learn from him in our attempts to understand the world. It is at such moments that Taylor's interpretation becomes vibrant and "powerfully sugges tive"?opening up new possibilities for answering the question, Why Hegel Now?
