<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lagomorph Remains at Prehistoric Sites in Israel and Southern Sinai T. BAR-EL and E. TCHERNOV Abstract : This paper presents a study of lagomorph (Lepus capensis) bone assemblages from nine southern Levantine prehistoric sites, namely Hayonim Terrace, Hayonim Cave, Kebara Cave, Nahal Hemar Cave, Netiv Hagdud and Ohalo II and southern Sinai (Abu Madi I, Ujrat-el-Mehed and Wadi Tbeiq), over a period spanning the Middle Palaeolithic to the pre-pottery Neolithic B. Since the Middle Pleistocene the cape hare (Lepus capensis) has been the only species of lagomorph known from this region . A taphonomic analysis is given for the various sites. The density of bones identified as from Lepus capensis, taken as the ratio of either the NISP or the MNI to the excavation volume, was greatest at Hayonim Terrace and layer В of Hayonim Cave, of the Natufian period, for both measures. These results confirm previous work which showed a modest increase in the proportion of lagomorph remains relative to rodents from certain pre-Natufian sites, but a quantum increase during the Natufian period. As the hare is highly agile, trapping and/or netting techniques may have been in use from the Natufian period onwards, and cordage remains found in the early Upper Epipalaeolithic site of Ohalo II indicate that this would have been possible. In this paper we argue that a widening in the spectrum of food consumption is one ultimate consequence of sedentism, an event which took place in the southern Levant at the dawn of the Natufian. The shift from ephemeral and/or seasonal occupation to a prolonged habitation of relatively large communities in the earliest Natufian had a far reaching impact on the proximate environment, leading people to exploit new resources that included smaller-sized mammals (mainly hares), birds (among which partridges are dominant), reptiles and land snails, as well as to practice cultural control on gazelles. Résumé : Cet article présente une étude d* os de lagomorphes (Lepus capensis) provenant de neuf sites préhistoriques du Levant Sud : Hayonim Terrace, Hayonim Cave, Kebara Cave, Nahal Hemar Cave, Netiv Hagdud et Ohalo II ainsi que du Sinai (Abu Madi I, Ujrat-el-Mehed and Wadi Tbeiq), couvrant une période allant du Paléolithique moyen au PPNB. Depuis le Pléistocène Moyen le Lièvre du Cap (Lepus Capensis) est la seule espèce de lagomorphe connue dans cette région. Une analyse taphonomique est donnée pour les différents sites. La densité des os identifiés comme ceux de Lepus capensis, calculée d'après le ratio du NISP ou du MNI au volume fouillé, est la plus élevée à Hayonim Terrace et dans le niveau В de la grotte ď Hayonim du Natoufien pour les deux mesures. Ces résultats confirment des travaux antérieurs qui montraient d'une part une faible augmentation de la proportion des restes de lagomorphes par rapport aux rongeurs de certains sites pré-natoufiens, d'autre part une augmentation quantitative pendant le Natoufien. Comme le Lièvre est très agile, des pièges et/ou des filets ont peut-être été utilisés à partir du Natoufien. Les restes de cordage trouvés sur le site ď Ohalo II (début de l'épipaléolithique récent) indiquent cette possibilité. Ici nous proposons l'hypothèse que l'élargissement du spectre des espèces consommées est une des dernières conséquences de la sédentarisation, événement qui prit place au Levant Sud au début du Natoufien. Le passage de l'occupation éphémère et/ou saisonnière à un séjour prolongé de communautés assez importantes au début du Natoufien a eu une répercussion durable sur l'environnement proche. Cette situation a amené les populations à exploiter de nouvelles ressources incluant des petits mammifires (lièvres principalement), des oiseaux (parmi lesquels dominent les perdrix), des reptiles et des escargots mollusques terrestres, ainsi qu'à effectuer un contrôle des mouvements des gazelles.

Tchernov INTRODUCTION What stands out most in the species abundance data for the southern Levantine late Middle Pleistocene to early Ho- locene is the shift in the nature of food consumption of humans from large to small game. The increase in emphasis on smaller game with time, and the reliance on a larger variety of animal species (the shift to "broad spectrum" economy, in the sense first proposed by Flannery1), has often been dis- cussed in connection with the socio-economic evolution of southern Levantine societies2, with the initiation of domesti- cation, and lately in association with a quantum shift to sedentism and food production3. Changes in human economy, particularly in hunting preferences and with the transition from opportunistic scavenging to the selective and planned hunting of game have often been attributed to changes in climate or human behavior, or to conflicts (competition) between different kinds of humans, such as Neanderthals versus modern humans4. Another explanation argues that the transition to a new economic strategy could have resulted from a shift to a less seasonably mobile way of life, i.e. a more permanent habitation5. None of the above are necessa- rily contradictory and could be included one within the other. Obviously we have to take into consideration the existing connection between the size and mobility of an animal and the hunting strategy of humans. Smaller but less mobile animals like tortoises ( Testudo graeca ), or the legless lizard (e.g. Ophisaurus apodus ), are the most common species in the southern Levantine prehistoric sites, together with land snails (e.g. Helix spp. and Levantina spp.). These animals, being easily caught, were readily available to Palaeolithic hunters6. Highly mobile and agile animals (like partridges or hares) are extremely rare in the fossil record of the Levant until the Natufian period. The ability to more effectively exploit small agile game could have resulted from the inven- tion of efficient technology like traps and/or nets. The hunting of large mammals may have required the cooperation of several hunters and division of the carcass, while small mammals, whether hunted communally or indi- vidually, could have been carried back whole from the kill site, by a single person7. Speth and Tchernov give examples of the former8. An example of the small mammal category is presented here with the cape hare (Lepus capensis ), which is the only endemic species of lagomorph known from the Middle East since the Middle Pleistocene. Assemblages of hare bones dating from the early Middle Palaeolithic (exposed in Hayonim cave, beginning more than 200 ka9 BP to the late Pre-Pottery Neolithic В (8.2 ka BP) are discussed below. These come from nine sites - six in Israel and three in the Sinai Peninsula of Egypt. The question of whether birds of prey or other non-human predators were involved in accumulating the hare assemblages in cave sites, or whether these may be considered anthropogenic deposits, is an important issue recently raised by Cruz-Uribe and Klein10. Until the Epipalaeolithic the relative frequency of hares was very low in all the above mentioned cave sites, as well as in all other Middle and Upper Palaeolithic sites in the Levant, like Sephunim and Rakefet caves (Mt. Carmel) and Amud and Qafzeh caves (Galilee). Much like the sites of Kebara and Hayonim, they were only ephemerally inha- bited by humans, and hence could have been occupied by carnivores and birds of prey only intermittently. The paucity of hare remains during periods when humans were not there, indicates that in all those cave sites - even if used as roosting sites - the deposition of regurgitated hare remains was rare. In fact it is only from the Natufian onward that hare bones became common in sites that were heavily occupied by people for long periods, and hence less frequently occupied by birds of prey and other carnivores. MATERIALS AND METHODS The source of the lagomorph assemblages are given in table 1, together with the abbreviations used in the text, the archaeological periods, their time spans and references. The locations of the sites are given in figure 1. Three of the nine sites examined are cave sites : Hayonim Cave, Kebara Cave and Nahal Hemar Cave. At Hayonim Cave in northern Israel, the remains from four different periods were analyzed : Layer E (Middle Palaeolithic-later Mousterian), Layer D (Upper Palaeolithic- Aurignacian), Layer С (early Epipalaeolithic- Kebaran) and Layer В (late Epipalaeolithic-early Natufian). 1.

At Kebara Cave in Mount Carmel two assemblages were studied : one from the lower layers (Middle Palaeolithic-later Mousterian) and the other from the upper (earliest Upper Palaeolithic-Ahmarian). Nahal Hemar Cave of the Dead Sea area seems to have served as a storage facility during the pre-pottery Neolithic В and intermittently as a hyena den11. The remaining are open sites and from various periods and locations. Ohalo II and Netiv Hagdud are in the central Jordan Valley, the former being from the early Epipalaeolithic and the latter from the pre-pottery Neolithic A. Hayonim Terrace, a Natufian site, is adjacent to Hayonim Cave and its inhabi- tants most probably made use of the cave itself next to them 12. The sites of Wadi Tbeiq and Ujrat-el-Mehed are from the pre-pottery Neolithic В and Abu Madi I from the pre-pottery Neolithic A, all in the southern Sinai. Neve-David, referred to in table 3, was not studied by us and not shown in figure 1 ; it is located on the western slopes of Mount Carmel. Recovery methods varied slightly for the different si- tes/layers. The excavated sediments from layer E of Hayonim Cave and the lower layer (Mousterian) of Kebara Cave were dry-sieved, whereas those from the upper (Upper Palaeolithic) layer of Kebara Cave, Hayonim Terrace and layers В, С and D of Hayonim Cave were wet-sieved, with a 3 mm mesh13. Ohalo II was wet-sieved with a mesh of 2 mm during the first two seasons and of 1-1,5 mm during the third season14. At Netiv Hagdud 15 and Nahal Hemar Cave 16, all the deposits had been dry-sieved, using a 2 mm mesh at the former and a 1-1.5 mm mesh at the latter. At Wadi Tbeiq, Ujrat-el-Mehed and Abu Madi I a 3 mm mesh had been used and at Abu Madi I, additionally, a 1 mm mesh was used for parts of the deposit 17 . For identification and taphonomic appraisal, bone frag- ments were compared with those of Lepus capensis from the Comparative Collection of Mammals at the Hebrew Univer- sity of Jerusalem. Schmid' s Atlas of Animal Bones18 was also referred to. Measurements were recorded for charac- terizing environmental conditions 19 . Archaeological informa- tion accompanying the material, such as site, grid location, depths and/or loci, was noted. In addition, comments were registered regarding articulated elements, unfused or fused epiphyses and indications of gnawing, digestion and cut marks. The minimum number of individuals (MNI) is the most prevalent element of a certain side (left or right). The number of identified specimens (NISP) is the sum of the specimens given in the "list of skeletal elements used for NISP" (see appendix). The relative frequencies, as presented in figure 2, were calculated as a percentage of the total NISP, after grouping elements together. These groups, together with their anatomical proportions, are given as follows : lower incisor, premolars, molars were grouped under "lower teeth" (12%); the upper incisors, premolars, molars - under "upper teeth" (16%); the frontal, palatine, premaxilla, maxilla, and squa- mosal bones - under "cranial elements" (10%); mandibles with or without the alveolar row - under "mandible" (2%) ; both distal and proximal elements - under "radius" (2%); "humerus" (2%), "ulna" (2%), metacarpals II- V, having at 11.

The "sacrum", exceptionally, had an ana- tomical representation of 1%. The "femur" and "tibiotarsus" were 2% each, and the metatarsals II-V having at least the proximal epiphysis were represented as "metatarsals", by 8% and the "terminal phalanx" by 18%. The tarsal bones other than the astragalus (2%) and calcaneum (2%) were labeled "other tarsals" (6%) and the innominate bones both with and without the acetabulum - "innominate" (2%). For the four sites with the largest NISP and MNI, two analyses were made : the ranking of bone elements relative to the MNI, and the frequency of bone elements as a per- centage of the MNE. Both of the latter are based on the same skeletal elements (see Appendix) but use different counting and calculation techniques. The "ranking of bone elements relative to MNI" gives the larger of the sided elements (left or right) in proportion to the most prevalent sided element. The "% MNE" gives the frequency of these elements as a percentage of the total, without regard to side. For greater clarity, a hypothetical example is given, using only two elements : 3 left, 4 right proximal femora and 6 left, 5 right distal humeri. The most prevalent sided element would be the left distal humerus, and the frequency of the right proximal femur relative to the MNI would be 66% (4/6). The MNE would be 18 (the total of these elements, without regard for side); the frequency of the proximal femur as a percentage of the MNE would be 39% (7/18) and the frequency of the distal humerus would be 61% (11/18). Since the distal humeri are the most frequent post-cranial element in most of the sites, and since it is a relatively dense bone in many mammals20, we use the proportion of fragmen- ted to non-fragmented bone as an indicator of fragmentation frequency21 for the entire assemblage. "Fragmented bones" are the distal humeri with the shaft attached having a quarter of the length or less. "Non-fragmented bones" consists of the distal humeri with a greater length of the shaft attached, as well as whole humeri. The degree of fragmentation was considered as the proportion of "fragmented bones" to "non- fragmented bones". Distal epiphyses without shafts were re- gistered separately. Shaft segments were not used. A significance level of 5% was used for statistical tests. The binomial distribution, the chi-square tests for one sample and for two independent samples, and the Fisher exact prob- ability test for two independent samples, were applied accor- ding to Siegel22. The proportion of humeri out of the total number of limb elements in the intact skeleton does not differ from 20%, according to the null hypothesis used here. The 20.

At Hayonim Terrace, also, the distal humerus is the most prevalent element and is a little more than 30% of the MNE (fig. 4a) ; the humerus is 26% of the NISP (see fig. 2b). At Hayonim Cave, layer B, the mandible ranks a close second place (96%) to the most prevalent element (fig. 3b); the MNE frequency of the mandible is close to 15% (see fig. 4b) and its frequency relative to the NISP is 10% (see fig. 2c). Table 3 presents the densities of the MNI and the NISP, calculated from the excavation volumes given in table 2. Additionally, figures calculated for Neve David from data given by Bar-Oz are included. The highest densities are found for the two Natufian sites : layer В of Hayonim Cave, with 10 MNI and 219 NISP per cubic meter, and Hayonim Terrace with 3 MNI and 29 NISP per cubic meter. Three of the pre-Natufian periods, represented by Neve David and layers С (Kebaran) and D (Aurignacian) of Hayonim Cave have less than one-tenth the density of layer В of Hayonim Cave, by both measures of density. The fourth pre-Natufian site, Ohalo II, has less than one-tenth the density of layer В of Hayonim Cave by the NISP measure, but close to one-fifth (18,5%) by the MNI measure. The four post-Natufian periods, represented by Netiv Hagdud (PPNA) and Nahal Hemar Cave, Wadi Tbeiq and Ujrat-el-Mehed of the PPNB, also have densities less than one-tenth those of layer В of Hayonim Cave, by both density measures. A fifth post-Natufian site, that of Abu Madi I, has less than one-tenth the bone density of Hayonim Cave according to the NISP measure and slightly more than one-tenth (11,5%) by the MNI measure. The total number of limb elements (the sum of the hume- rus, radius, ulna, femur, tibiofibula) are given in table 4, together with the proportion of the NISP (Table 4). At Hayo- nim Terrace the limb elements constitute the greatest propor- tion of the NISP (36%). The frequency of post-cranial elements (starting from the distal humerus - see Appendix) varies for the different sites. At HT the post-cranials add up to 420, which is 87% of a total MNE of 484. At HB, the sum of the post-cranial elements is 170, or 47% of a total MNE of 360. At WT, 574 post-cranials make up 70% of an MNE of 821 and at AMI 115 post-cranials make up 71% of the MNE of 161. HB differs significantly from each of the other sites in the pro- portion of post-cranial elements. In figure 5 the limb composition is presented (humerus, radius, ulna, femur, tibiofibula) for various sites/layers, with the exception of Hayonim Cave-Layers С and E, and the Mousterian Layer of Kebara Cave, where the limb number was fewer than 10. At all sites but Ujrat-el-Mehed, the humerus constituted more than 20% of the limbs, with a maximum of 65% at Hayonim Terrace. The composition of femurs, on the other hand, was low : less than 20% at all sites but Nahal Hemar, with a low of 1% at Hayonim Terrace. The actual proportion of the humerus was found to be signi- ficantly different from its expected anatomical proportion of 20% for HC, HB, HT and WT. The frequency of articulated elements is given in table 2. At Nahal Hemar there were four sets : an ulna connected with a radius, a complex of ulna, radius and humerus, a lower forelimb skeleton intact from the ulna-radius down through the distal end of the phalanges and a tibiofibula articulated with the astragalus. At Ujrat-el-Mehed there were two sets : an ulna-radius and two metatarsals (mt4-mt5). At Wadi Tbeiq there was an astragalus articulated with a calcaneum and at Hayonim Terrace, two adjacent metatarsals. Evidence of immature individuals was sparse and table 2 gives the frequency of unfused or fusing elements. At Nahal Hemar, there was an unfused femur, a fusing tibia, and a fusing distal humerus. At Wadi Tbeiq, also, there were three immature bones : a tibia and two proximal ulnas. At Netiv Hagdud, there was an unfused proximal epiphysis of a fifth Paléorient, vol. 26/1, p. 93-109 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2001</page><page sequence="8">100 T. Bar-El and E.

A single instance of a cut mark was found on a proximal radius from Netiv Hagdud and elements having a gnawed appearance (4 femora, 2 pelvi and one scapula) were recorded at Nahal Hemar. No digestion marks were found at any of the sites. The proportion of "fragmented bone" of the total of "frag- mented" and "non-fragmented" bones was greatest at Ohalo II and this was significantly different from Nahal Hemar, where intact limb bones were found. Netiv Hagdud, Hayonim Terrace and Hayonim Cave were similar to Ohalo II in having more "fragmented bones" than "non-fragmented bones". Lone epiphyses were found at Hayonim Terrace and Cave. No sign of a fusion border would indicate that these were unfused epiphyses of juveniles. Table 5 gives the total number of metatarsals and of metacarpals, together with the ratio of metatarsals to meta- carpals for the various sites. Note that at HB, HT, AM and NG this ratio was one or close to one, indicating equal or nearly equal proportions of metatarsals to metacarpals. At HC, NH, WT, HD and UM the ratios were greater, indicating a larger proportion of metatarsals than metacarpals. At OH and KBUP no metacarpals were found, while at HE and KBMS, there were no metapodials. WT differed significantly from each of the Natufian sites (HB and HT) in the proportion of metatarsals to metacarpals. If the smaller metacarpals were less frequently recovered due to loss through the sieve, this would introduce bias in this proportion.

Therefore, the contribution of recovery bias in favor of metatarsals would seem to be minor. DISCUSSION Articulated elements could give indications of natural death in situ and good preservation. However, articulated elements were very rare. At Nahal Hemar Cave, there was one articu- lated radius. - ulna. At Ujrat-el-Mehed there were three articulated elements (radius, ulna, astragalus, and metatarsals), and at Hayonim Terrace one set of metatarsals. Since this species of hare lives in open areas, natural death could have been the source at the open sites of Ujrat-el-Mehed and Hayonim Terrace. However, at Nahal Hemar (a cave site), another source of the hare remains should be sought (see below). Bones from young animals are rare. One explanation is that the less ossified bones were more poorly preserved. However, in most of the sites studied juveniles of other medium to small size animals were recovered, as well as a plethora of remains of microvertebrates. Another explanation for the rarity of juvenile hares in the fossil record is the Table 5 : The ratio of metatarsals to metacarpals from various sites.

Alternati- vely, the low utility to humans as food may have made the juveniles undesirable. The degree of fragmentation of bones could be an indica- tion of attrition due to biological sources, whether human or others. In case of anthropogenic intervention the causative factors could have been butchery or trampling. As there was a cut mark in only one instance (Netiv Hagdud), trampling seems to have been more probable as an explanation23. Table 2 shows that the number of "fragmented bones" is greater than the number of "non-fragmented bones" at most of the sites, Nahal Hemar being one of the exceptions. The anatomical proportions of the five limb bones are identical (20% each) in the living animal. The difference from this expected proportion for the humerus was significant at HT, HB and HC (Table 2). The humerus constitutes greater than 20% at all of the sites/layers except UM, and at Nahal Hemar the proportion was only slightly greater (21,4%). This could be due to the greater robustness of the distal humerus. Also, the method of butchery could háve been similar, invol- ving breaking/cutting the humerus and removing the entire skin and meat above this point. The proportion of femora is less than 20% (fig. 5) in all of the sites but Nahal Hemar. Possibly hares were hunted by humans away from the sites, 23. Gifford-Gonzalez et al., 1985.

Humans, dogs or other carnivores could have chewed off, at the site, the ends of bones with the greater marrow content, such as the proximal end of the humerus and femur.

Differences in butchery patterns would seem to be indica- ted by significant variations in the proportions of metatarsals to metacarpals and post-cranial to cranial elements from site to site. At WT the proportion of metatarsals to metacarpals was greater than for HB and HT (Table 5), possibly indicating a cut above the metatarsals at the former site, or differences in recovery (as explained above, the contribution of the latter should be small). The proportion of post-cranial elements at HB was significantly smaller than at HT, WT and AM. Hyenas, especially in the context of denning often built up accumulations of bones in Levantine caves24. At Hayonim Cave there is no evidence of coprolites of hyenas25 as have been found at other sites26, nor of juvenile hyenas27, so that concentration of lagomorph remains by hyenas in or out of the context of denning is unlikely at this site. At Nahal Hemar, however, the presence of gnawed bones indicates that carni- vores may have brought some of the hares there. At this same site the nearly anatomical limb proportions (approximately 20% each - see fig. 5), as well as the presence of some articulated elements (Table 2) and whole limb bones may indicate that other hare carcasses were buried intact. Accor- ding to several researchers the cave served as a storage site 24. Kerbis-Peterhans and Horwitz, 1992. 25. Stiner, pers. comm. 26. Horwitz, 1990; Horwitz and Goldberg, 1989. 27.

Tchernov for cultic artifacts such as masks, beads and fragments of anthropomorphic plaster statues28, but intermittently also as a hyena den29. While carnivores may have brought some of the cape hares, humans may have brought the others and buried them whole, perhaps as ritual offerings. Assemblages of skeletal remains of mammals the size of hares, and larger, are generally assumed to be the dietary remains of prehistoric humans unless there are indications of non-human predators30. The Lepus capensis assemblages could therefore be taken to reflect the dietary habits of pre- historic humans at different periods, with the above-mentio- ned exception of the cave site of Nahal Hemar. The frequency of Lepus capensis remains, as measured by MNI and NISP per cubic meter of excavation volume (Table 3), was greatest at Hayonim Terrace and layer В of Hayonim Cave. As described above, this was greater than the frequency at the four pre-Natufian sites of Ohalo II, Neve David and layers D and С of Hayonim Cave (Table 3), and the five post-Na- tufian sites, represented by Netiv Hagdud and Abu Madi I of the PPNA and Nahal Hemar Cave, Wadi Tbeiq and Ujrat- el-Mehed of the PPNB. Note that at the Geometric Kebaran site of Neve David the frequencies calculated by us from data presented by Bar-Oz et al.31 and given here in table 3, are greater than for two of the pre-Natufian layers of Hayonim Cave (HC and HD) but less when compared with the Natufian site of Hayo- nim Terrace (HT) and the Natufian layer of Hayonim Cave (HB). The same relationship exists for the raw data : Bar-Oz et al. 32 report a NISP of 39 and MNI of 7 for Lepus capensis (see Table 2 for comparison). Of particular significance is the comparison between the frequency of lagomorph remains from the Natufian layer В and the pre-Natufian layers С and D of Hayonim Cave. Since these layers are from the same site, the differences should be viewed as an increase in frequency from the earlier to the later periods. Other methods have been used for comparing frequencies, such as relating the skeletal remains to other mammalian fauna of the same site/layer. When calculated in relation to rodents in a previous work, there is a significant increase of hares from certain pre-Natufian to Natufian sites, and some decrease at the PPNA site of Netiv Hagdud33. When the concentration of hares was calculated in relation to ungulates, the increase continued at Netiv Hagdud. Thus, the trend of increase obtained previously by using bone frequency relative to other mammalian fauna corroborates the trend in the frequency calculated here by excavation volume, up to and including the Natufian. For the post-Natufian sites, where there is a lower frequency by volume than for the Natufian sites, this agreement does not apply (with the partial exception of Netiv Hagdud, as mentioned above). However, at the PPNB site of Wadi Tbeiq the cape hare took first place in the faunal assemblage34 and at Ujrat-el-Mehed35 third place after Bos primigenius and Capra ibex. An explanation for the discrepancy may be found in the nature of the sites : four of the five post-Natufian sites were open sites, which were spread out over a broader area relative to cave sites. The essential strategy of large carnivores is to maximize their prey size and minimize the amount of energy invested in high frequency prédation36. This is obvious, as the act of prédation, or "a kill", is a highly energy-consuming event, and hence should be efficient and seldom. Indeed, large predators have developed an astonishing efficiency in preying on large animals. On the other hand, in order to detect large prey they have to be able to cover large foraging areas, and therefore they become essentially nomadic, or vagile, animals. The only way to decrease mobility, to reduce the foraging area, and to establish a more sedentary behavioral pattern is to shift to prédation of smaller animals, and to become less specialized or more omnivorous. Therefore, by analogy, we may expect that sedentism in man should have changed his exploitation behavior to include a broader spectrum of food resources, incorporating vegetarian sources as well, and thus to become more omnivorous. Indeed, widening the spectral array of food resources is one of the ultimate consequences of sedentism37. The shift from ephemeral and/or seasonal occupation to prolonged habitation of relatively large communities at the dawn of the Natufian period had a far-reaching and profound impact on the proximate biotic environment. The necessity of a sedentary community to exploit its resources within an increasingly limited area forced the inhabitants to utilize a broad spectral array of animals and to operate cultural control of wild populations of gazelles or ibexes38. The appearance of commensal animals around and within Natufian habitations and consequently the emergence of domesticated dogs are the ultimate outcome of such long-term habitation. 28.

Proportionally fewer reptiles are present in the Kebaran, and they are much less common in the Natufian. By contrast, birds (thrush-sized and larger) are rare in the Mousterian; less so in the Kebaran and prevalent in the Natufian. Indeed, the few bird remains present in the Mousterian layers are mainly from owls and probably were not food to these early humans. Hares were an outstan- ding feature of the diet of Natufian times. Bar-Oz et al.40 stated that statistical analysis of most of the Epipalaeolithic faunal assemblages from Israel "revealed no significant difference between pre-Natufian and Natufian fossil assemblages" (p. 67). Yet, their statistics are partly based on the sites of Mallaha (=Eynan) and Hatoula. The faunal remains that were published from Eynan by Bouchud41 represent a very small and selective portion and from a limited number of loci from this site. Only a few groups of the microfaunal remains was analyzed and published. The faunal list published from Hatoula by Davis et al. 42 is based on less than 100 square meters. The detailed stratigraphy on the site is published in a separate chapter and Davis on the advice of the excavators studied the material phase by phase i.e. Natufian, Khiamian, Sultanian and not by soil or geological strata. If all bones and teeth were examined S. Davis explains the reasons why not all of them but only selected ones. The micromammals have not been fully published. So for these reasons the data published from both sites cannot, in our opinion, represent the quantitative frequencies of animals. As discussed previously43, specialization in hunting small animals such as Lepus capensis 44 , Alectoris chukar and water birds45 was part of the general broadening of the diversity of animal species exploited, mainly during the Natufian and PPN periods. The behavior of prehistoric humans with respect to food procurement may also be inferred from knowledge of the natural history of Lepus capensis . As the cape hare can develop speeds of up to 70 km per hour46 it is a very difficult animal to hunt, and therefore the setting of traps and/or nets would seem to have been the principal means of procurement. The !Kung San of Africa cooperate in foraging the springhare (Rodentia) in its burrow and using specialized 39. Stiner and Tchernov, 1998 ; Stiner et al., 1999. 40. Bar-Oz et al ., 1999. 41.

The springhare, as an evolutionarily convergent animal, is similar in its size, body proportions and nocturnal activity to the cape hare. It stays during the day in self-made burrows, while the cape hare uses pre-existing depressions for resting, concealed under vegetation. The latter would have to be surprised during the day in order to be caught before escaping. Netting areas of vegetation could have been used as a method of procurement, as might have been done for partridges, and possibly as a cooperative activity. At Ohalo II, fragments of twisted fibers were found which are thought to be the remains of cordage48. The large number of remains of small fish at this site suggests the use of fine-mesh net- ting49. Netting could also have made possible the more ef- fective procurement of hares. The increase in the concentration of lagomorph remains during the pre-Natufian, but especially during the Natufian and (somewhat less) the PPN, is based on the bone frequencies measured in relation to rodents and/or ungulate skeletal remains described in a previous work. This trend is corroborated in part by the frequencies based on excavation volume used in the present work. This could indicate that traps or nets were used for extremely vagile small terrestrial animals at least from the Natufian period. The significant differences in the proportion of metatarsals to metacarpals between the PPNB site of Wadi Tbeiq and each of the Natufian sites could indicate differences in pat- terns of butchery, although both consumption and/or weathe- ring could have been responsible for the differences. These same causes could apply to the significant differences in the proportion of post-cranial elements at the Natufian site of Hayonim Cave from the other Natufian site of Hayonim Terrace, and the PPN site of Wadi Tbeiq and of Abu Madi I. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS Lagomorph remains from nine prehistoric sites were stu- died : Nahal Hemar Cave, Ujrat-el-Mehed, Wadi Tbeiq, Abu Madi I, Netiv Hagdud, Hayonim Cave, Hayonim Terrace, Ohalo II, Kebara Cave. At Hayonim Cave four periods were studied (Layers B, C, D and E). At Kebara Cave the Upper Palaeolithic and the later Mousterian layers were studied. On the basis of limb bone frequency, skeletal part frequencies, 47. Yellen, 1991. 48. Nadel et al., 1994. 49. Nadel, 1994.

Tchernov and/or bone breakage patterns, the accumulation of bones appears to have been of anthropogenic origin at Hayonim Cave, Hayonim Terrace, Abu Madi, Kebara Cave and Ohalo II. The remains, at prehistoric sites, of animals the size of hares and larger are usually considered to be the dietary remains of ancient man. At Nahal Hemar Cave it would seem that while some of the hares may have been brought there by carnivores, others may have been brought there by humans not for food, but possibly for cult or other purposes. The frequency of bone elements at those sites, for which the excavation volumes are known, calculated in relation to the number of identified specimens (NISP) and the minimum number of individuals (MNI), was greatest at Hayonim Cave and Terrace during the Natufian period. The densities were lower at the three pre-Natufían sites (Ohalo II, layers D and С of Hayonim Cave) and the five post-Natufian sites (Netiv Hagdud, and Abu Madi I of the PPNA and Nahal Hemar, Ujrat-el-Mehed and Wadi Tbeiq of the PPNB). The same trends were obtained whether the density calculations were made with the NISP or MNI. The results presented in this paper support previous fin- dings based on the proportion of lagomorph remains relative to rodents, from pre-Natufian up to and including sites from the Natufian and PPN periods. Based on knowledge of the natural history of the hare it can be inferred that trapping and/or netting techniques must have been in use from the Natufian period onwards, and the evidence of cordage from the very early Epipalaeolithic site of Ohalo II lends support to this interpretation.
