The article first provides an overview of the ten most important interpretations of the talio formula (in singular) in the current scientific research and shows why each interpretation is problematic. Then the author tries to demonstrate that the character and meaning of the formula changes in different contexts in the Bible. The differences are so deep, that it is better not to speak of one formula but to differentiate between five talio formulas. In the context of physical damage it means an adequate reparation (1compensation-talio); in connection with a murder it intends the death penalty (life-protection-talio)■, in the context the Trial it designates the demand of absolute truthfulness (false-witness-talio); in the context of education it serves to strengthen the responsibility of young human beings (education-talio), in the context of philosophical reflection it is a sapiential principal of the world order as the "doing-receiving correlation" (lex-generalis-talio). In the first three cases (compensation, life protection, faithfulness) the formula is more secular-juridical; in the נ*5]</page><page sequence="2">Abstracts two last cases (education, world order) it is more theological; the idea is that god himself is highly active in conducting the world. Stability and Surprise in the Book of Ruth's Exposition Jonathan Grossman 'Expositions are typically short and to the point; even "dynamic expositions" do not usually advance the plot, to the extent that stability is considered a central criterion for the definition of "exposition"' (Sternberg). Nonetheless, the book of Ruth's exposition contains various elements of surprise. After discussing theoretical methods of employing the element of surprise in a narrative, this article traces the tension embedded within the book of Ruth's exposition's design: a jarring fusion of banal description and intensive employment of surprise. This ambivalence touches upon conventions in tension with the narrative content, but it also serves the author's broader theological perception of reward and punishment. Is Laban the "Wandering Aramean"? A Biblical Foundation for a Homiletic Identification Adiel Cohen The words "arami oved avi" ("a wandering Aramean was my father") (Deuteronomy 26:5) have traditionally been interpreted in reference to one of two separate characters. According to the literal interpretation both "arami" and "avi" are understood as referring to Jacob - "My father [Jacob] was a wandering Aramean". In contrast, according to the homiletic interpretation, the Aramean is Laban who sought to destroy נ*6]</page><page sequence="3">Abstracts Jacob - "An Aramean [Laban] sought to destroy my father [Jacob]". The homiletic interpretation is fraught with difficulty: Laban is a marginal character in the biblical narrative, and it is difficult to maintain a position that would grant him the status of an enemy so crucial to Jewish history that he is immortalized in the credo of Jewish pilgrimage. In this paper I will argue that Jacob is clearly perceived as the "Aramean" in the Proclamation of the First Fruits, reflecting the plain meaning of the text; nonetheless, the interpretation that views Laban as the "Aramean" should be viewed and verified as the plain meaning of the biblical text as well. This interpretation can be established by examining the connection between the Proclamation of the First Fruits and other biblical passages. An intertextual study within the biblical corpus enables an understanding of the development of homiletic interpretation. The Throne Vision in the Book of Daniel 7,9-10 as a Case Study Towards Anthropomorphism in the Second Temple Literature Rivka Raviv The prophetic vision of the throne in Daniel (7, 9-10) is probably the most daring description of God found in the Bible, containing unparalleled anthropomorphic revelations within the Bible. The biblical passage depicts God sitting on His throne in judgment, surrounded by tens of thousands of angels, with the color of His clothing as well as the hair on His head also described. This article examines the various methods that the writers of Second Temple Literature employed to contend with this singular portrayal as well as their relationship to the various anthropomorphic [7*]</page><page sequence="4">Abstracts revelations in it. It commences with an examination of this prophetic vision within the background of the bible itself, especially to its parallels in: I Kgs 22; Isa 7, and Ezek 1. The conclusion drawn in the article is that in general the writers opposed anthropomorphisms found in this description - they usually toned it down with the aid of reasonable exegesis. In one case the writer even ignored all the problematic elements. Only in the Septuagint we found acceptable of the description without any transformations. This conclusion strengthens the common notion that the creators of this Literature were anti-anthropomorphism in this period. Repetition and Reiteration According to Ramban (Nachmanides) Malkah Shenvald The phenomenon of repetition in the Bible is discussed from various perspectives in the classic commentaries. Ramban adopted fundamental axioms of his predecessors and formulated an organized and updated doctrine. This article examines four methodological axioms, which exemplify the basics of Ramban,s approach to repetition. The first axiom - "The text does not generally repeat itself, only... for such things as are always thus" (Ramban, Exodus 30:34) - relates to parallelism in poetry, as is common in a "play on words". In this regard, Ramban followed the path of his predecessors, with one caveat: the repetition, as voiced by Moshe, was a Heavenly revelation (and not Moshe,s own formulation). The second axiom - "it is common for many Biblical texts to repeat phrases - to intensify and enhance their significance" (Ramban, Exodus 4:9) - Ramban taught that words are repeated for emphasis. Ramban [8*]</page><page sequence="5">Abstracts adopted his predecessors words (Ibn Janah and Radak), but here too he delimited this explanation of repetitionin the case of revelation verses, which open with the familiar formula: "And the Lord said... saying...י' The third axiom, Ramban addresses repetition "for the sake of a lengthy passage" and explains that such duality is intended to link sentences that are separated, so as to create a single flowing syntax. Upon this claim he added a very weighty declaration against excessive emphasis on homiletic meanings. Ramban was consistent in this, even when it required distancing himself from conclusions reached by the sages in the Gemara (Babylonian Talmud 18a). The fourth and final axiom addresses the reiteration of lengthy passages. A detailed list of examples demonstrates that Ramban's approach to reiteration intended to preserve the unified flow of a story; especially after the order of events was complicated (in order to complete a parenthetical passage, important in its own right). This chapter complements Y. Gottlieb's research, as it appears in his book Order in the Bible (2009), and expands the understanding of Biblical chronology according to the Ramban.
