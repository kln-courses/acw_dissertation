The new worlds are Renaissance and Reformation; the lost worlds are old certainties, shared beliefs, and traditional values. This is Susan Brigden's interpretive key to the period - not the only one, as she admits, but undoubtedly one that allows her to blend high politics, popular religion, the nature of society, and literature. New worlds, lost worlds is an elegant and stylish account of a century of continuity and profound change. It may perhaps be fairly easy to state in prologue or epilogue form how the England of I485 was a different place in I603, it is a rather more difficult task to understand and explain the forces and principles of change over nearly twelve decades. Susan Brigden does this in a book that is as challenging as it sophisticated. KING'S COLLEGE, CAMBRIDGE STEPHEN ALFORD The Historical Journal, 45 (2002).

A rather tired historiography has been revived lately by a handful of historians examining the state as a manifestation of social needs and cultural norms. Michael Braddick, in this ambitious historiographic essay, draws together the threads of old analyses and new ones while adding some of his own. In doing so, he considers the state not as an autonomous collection of central institutions created by self-conscious bureaucrats (such as Elton's Cromwell) but as a network of local officeholders who helped to create, and who sometimes ignored, the resources and demands of central agencies. Braddick examines four state forms: patriarchal, fiscal-military, confessional, and dynastic. Given this variety, no one theory, Weberian, Eltonian, or otherwise, could explain the state's development. By appreciating the complexity of state 'formation' rather than 'making', and by crossing the boundaries separating periods and those dividing different fields of historical analysis, Braddick has provided the best guide we have to the early modern state. Braddick's most original insights arise from his attention to state formation as a social process. The state was a constantly changing sum of ever shifting needs as people made and used its resources to solve problems close to home. Nowhere was this more clear than in the patriarchal state, characterized by a concern for ameliorating the dearth and disorder besetting England in the generations before I640. The historiography of this period, often focused on the causes of the Civil War, tends to emphasize the state's failures. Braddick emphasizes its successes. Like Steve Hindle (The state and social change in early modern England, c. 550--1640 (London, 2000)), Braddick contends that the state 'was useful to all sorts of people ... and far from having to penetrate the localities was frequently invited in' (p. 93). Discretion, not resistance, characterized the parochial experience of authority, as was so apparent in the creative deployment or neglect of the poor law or plague regulations. Greater local discretion also brought more policing of this discretion by the courts. One ofBraddick's most successful chapters explores the now rich scholarship concerning popular uses of the law and fluctuations in rates of litigation to show how people used 690</page><page sequence="2">law to control the state's workings. Contrary to older arguments, 'law was not simply an instrument used to discipline and regulate social life from outside. Government provided a resource, and a tool that could be manipulated, even for those of fairly humble status' (p. 164). Conciliar courts and local ones offered relatively cheap process in civil disputes. And when a person felt wronged by the decisions of ever more numerous and powerful statutory commissioners or justices of the peace, King's Bench could provide relief using writs of certiorari and mandamus. The patriarchal state before 1640 not only arose to dampen the impact of social crisis in response to local needs; it also managed, through the courts, to do so in a way that gave government better legal definition and more regularity. Braddick's patriarchal state was not the anthropomorphic state of an older historiography, a state that built itself and intended to do certain things. But this turns out to have been less true in the fiscal-military and confessional states. The confessional state was often out of step with provincial expectations as it attempted to impose varying ideas of spiritual propriety on a populace that often rejected overly precise definitions. Conflicts among the church hierarchy and royal officers about these definitions only made matters worse. Likewise, rather than providing resources, the fiscal-military state demanded them. The commands of muster masters and the exactions of purveyors met grumbling compliance. The pre-Civil War fiscal-military state showed its weakness as such demands, even when answered, failed to produce the effective fighting force it desired. Civil war brought a military revolution and thus more demands. After I640, novel forms of state revenue, especially the excise, provoked resistance. Legitimating such demands proved much more difficult than legitimating a patriarchal state that gave people tools to address the social problems they faced. Thus the fiscal-military interests of the state, like its religious interests, point less to the kind of popular participatory model of the patriarchal state and more to an older model of an autonomous state at a 'centre' making objectionable demands on the 'localities'. But after i689, resistance declined as the fiscal-military state developed new forms of debt to make its work possible and as the confessional state slowly retreated from efforts to impose its will. While Braddick's accounts of the fiscal-military and confessional states are not new, discussing them alongside the patriarchal state provides an important contrast, highlighting what early modern government could and could not do. Providing this contrast makes clear that the state's possibilities and limits were determined by the degree of popular initiative involved in these various aspects of governance. State 'formation' was not the 'making' of Leviathan. More interesting, and perhaps more controversial, is Braddick's analysis of the dynastic state that ultimately absorbed Wales, Scotland, Ireland, and, finally, a North American empire. Braddick makes thorough use of recent developments in both 'three kingdoms' and transatlantic scholarship. Dynastic state growth resulted from shared norms among the elites of these different areas who wanted to promote civility: 'The expansion of the Tudor and Stuart states was partly a cultural project, and one that found local support among the inhabitants of the Scottish and Irish "pales"' (p. 346). Extending civility required institutions and regular processes - a state - to encourage local peace. As with the patriarchal state in England, Braddick suggests that a nascent British and imperial dynastic state was formed largely in response to provincial interests; unlike in England, these were the interests of socially and politically more prominent groups rather than those beneath them. While Braddick admits that this process entailed a good deal of violence, especially in Ireland, many scholars concerned 69I OTHER REVIEWS</page><page sequence="3">HISTORICAL JOURNAL with the national histories of these places may well reject his vision of a unifying elite project that de-emphasizes the use of compulsion of various kinds. Braddick has accomplished two crucial things. First, he has provided a useful survey of a vast and varied scholarly literature. Second, he has done so by tying together aspects of state formation that have been treated separately when they have been treated at all. Braddick's story of the fiscal-military state is familiar, but his accounts of the church, of Britain, and of empire as aspects of state development are less so. More novel is the argument concerning the social origins and responsiveness of the patriarchal state. If there is no one neat model to encompass all four state forms, that is the point. For instead of a unifying theory, Braddick has offered an exploration of the state's many manifestations which, owing to its attention to complexity, provides a firm foundation on which future work can build.

Oxford: Oxford University Press, 200I. Pp. xv+633. ISBN o-19-820091-9. ?55.oo. It is a commonplace of modern history that civilizing missions are doomed to fail. As the pursuits of zealots rather than pragmatists whose contradictions and hypocrisy are easily exposed, such enterprises lend themselves to retelling as tragedy (as in Inga Clendinnen's Ambivalent conquests: Maya and Spaniard in Yucatan, I5I7-I570 (i987), for example), but less often as irony. Not the least of the achievements of Nicholas Canny's Making Ireland British is to have rendered one such mission comprehensible without making its consequences seem foreordained. In eight chapters, of formidable empirical density and subtly combative argument, Canny depicts the unfolding English mission to 'make Ireland British' from Edmund Spenser to Oliver Cromwell. He argues that Spenser's glorification of salutary violence in The faerie queene and The view of the present state of Ireland set the agenda for the next seventy years of English policy. Contra Brendan Bradshaw, he stresses the unity of the English ruling elite in Ireland and attributes the common purpose of English churchmen, soldiers, and lay officials to their shared attachment to advanced Protestantism. When offered as a solution to the apparent retreat of English Protestant 'civility' in the face of Irish 'degeneracy', the potent combination of magistracy and ministry that characterized English Protestantism in the first Elizabethan generation became a ferocious weapon of acculturation in Ireland. The growing sense of crisis in the 159os, and the increasing militarization of the English presence in Ireland, rendered plausible Spenser's call for civilization at the point of a sword. His vision stood ready to be reactivated whenever the promoters of English civility felt Irish savagery pressing upon them. Spenser excluded the Scots from his civilizing mission but after the crisis of the I59os, the accession of James VI to the English throne and the 'Flight of the Earls' in 1607, Scottish settlers became nominally equal partners in the effort to make Ireland 'British'. Canny calculates that before I622 'the total annual human flow from Britain to Ireland falls within the range of that from Spain to the New World which averaged 2,583 a year 692</page></plain_text>
