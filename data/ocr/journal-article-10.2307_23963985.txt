The concern of this book is restricted, as Professor Swinburne tells us at the outset, to 'revelation in the secondary sense of revelation of propositional truth' (pp. 2-3), which he regards as an essential element in, but not the whole of Christian revelation. The issue is pursued with the clarity and philosophical precision for which Swinburne's work is rightly renowned. He devotes the</page><page sequence="2">778 REVIEWS first part of the book to a careful discussion of such basic terms as meaning, proposition, analogy, and metaphor (a term which he uses more widely than some other authors), in the course of which a number of useful distinctions are made. The concentration is on smaller units of meaning; myth, for example, does not figure in the index, but there is a welcome stress on the importance of context and of genre of writing for the determination of meaning. In the second part Swinburne sets out to answer the question: what kind of revelation is to be expected, if there is a God (the case for which he has, of course, argued at length in earlier writings), and how might one expect it to be tested? His conclusion is that 'there is good a priori reason for expecting a propositional revelation, in connection with an atoning incarnation; and for expecting some means to be provided for preserving and rightly interpreting that revelation for new centuries and cultures' (p. 83); moreover, the best evidence in support of such a purported revela tion would be the occurrence of a predicted miracle involving a violation of a law of nature. Not surprisingly on that basis he claims the Christian revelation to be the one serious candidate for consideration (p. 95). Swinburne regards his account of the kind of revelation to be expected as derived from purely 'general consid erations' (p. 210), constituting what 'humans have reason for expecting' (p. 210). To me, on the other hand, it seems clear that his account is radically influenced by the traditional Christian understanding of revelation. That does not rule out the possibility of a significant argument being developed on the basis of the points that he develops, but, if I am right, it would have to be a very different argument from the one that is actually presented. In the final and longest part of the book, Swinburne reviews a traditional account of Christian revelation to see how it fares against the expected form of revelation and the hoped for criteria for its validation. The resulting picture goes something like this. The 'original revelation' is the fundamental content of the teaching of Jesus, which included the founding of the Church to carry on his teaching, and is authenticated by the miracle of the resurrec tion, for which (in view of the claimed prior probability of some such event, if there is to be a revelation at all) 'we do not need too much in the way of historical evidence to make it on balance probable that the Resurrection took place' (p. 112). The teaching of the Church is the divinely given guarantee of a continuing true interpretation of that revelation in differing future contexts; from this it follows that even if historical enquiry can come only to 'vague conclusions' about the teaching of Jesus, we can be confid ent that 'he taught what the Church said he taught' (p. 113). The</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 779 creeds embody the essence of the revelation and are the agreed key to its interpretation, specifically to the interpretation of Scrip ture which is its paramount vehicle. There is not space to discuss all these aspects of revelation, and I will confine myself to what Swinburne has to say about the Bible. The traditional claim is that God is the author of the Bible—either its sole author, ensuring that 'the message of each of its sentences is as it was' (p. 175), with the human authors contributing only to style and expression, or by way of inspiration of not always fully responsive human authors, thus allowing 'some small amount of falsity on important matters to affect Scripture' (p. 198). The concept of God as author is treated in a very straightforward, anthropomorphic manner. Following up the insights of the first part of the book, Swinburne seeks the key to interpretation in the shared context of author and intended audi ence. For Christian interpreters of Scripture, that is not the human author and his contemporary audience but God and the Church down the ages. It is 'the beliefs shared by God and the Church of many centuries' (p. 185) (i.e. central Christian doctrines and all known truths of history and science) that tell us where texts are to be understood literally and where metaphorically. On that basis a passage such as the final verse of Ps. 137 ('Happy shall he be that taketh and dasheth thy little ones against the Rock') must be taken metaphorically, and 'there is a very natural interpretation of the verse as a command to humans to destroy their evil inclina tions' (p. 189). Again, if in Rom. 1: 4 Paul is giving voice (as many scholars suggest) to a lower Christology than the true Christology of the later creeds, he must none the less, while expressing his own inadequate view, have been 'inspired by God to write things whose meaning was a little different from what he supposed' (p. 193)—i.e. ορισθέντος can be taken in a fully orthodox sense, even though Paul may not so have intended it, and should be taken in that way by us when reading it as Scripture. This way of reading Scripture is, Swinburne claims with some justice, pretty close to that of Origen, Augustine, and Gregory—as well as conforming to the basic philosophical principle of seeking a consistent reading of the text of a single author. The role of these reflections (which inevitably I have only been able to outline very briefly) is for Swinburne the testing of a hypothesis. If there is a God, we should expect a revelation of a certain general kind; Christian revelation is on the face of it a good fit, but we have to face the question whether, in the light of all our modern historical knowledge etc., it can be read in a way which makes it plausible to claim that it does contain a 'revelation</page><page sequence="4">780 · REVIEWS of propositional truth'. Swinburne believes his arguments show that it can. But it seems to me that what is designed as a careful defence of Christian orthodoxy ends up as part of the case for the prosecution. If it is really the case that for there to be a revelation, it has to involve communicating propositional truth in this artifi cial way, then the case against divine revelation is strong indeed. Does God set crossword puzzles? The case that Swinburne argues is a careful, logical one. That is both its strength and its weakness. Any ancient theory under pressure can be sustained if enough epicycles are added. If any text can, when the context of new knowledge requires it, be given a metaphorical interpretation in the style of the 'very natural' interpretation of Ps. 137: 7, then the 'truth' of the text can always be maintained. But there is a point at which the process, however logically watertight, ceases to have credibility. Swinburne is well informed about the history of exegesis and doctrine. But his con centration on propositional truth means that the living character of that history is lost to view. It may not be so easy to bring philosophical reflection to bear on that fuller, messier historical process, but it is only if it is so directed that it can constructively serve the cause of religious and theological understanding.
