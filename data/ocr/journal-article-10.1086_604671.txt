KORNIENKO, Voronezh State Pedagogical University, Voronezh, Russia I. Introduction Before the series of  discoveries of  monumental Upper Mesopotamian communal ritual structures, the question of  the construction of  cult buildings during the Aceramic Neolithic period remained unresolved. The research conducted at the existing Aceramic Neolithic sites in Northern Syria, Iraq, and especially Southeastern Turkey dating to the tenth through the eighth millennia b.c. (fig. 1) provides evidence for the existence of  pub- lic cult buildings during the period under discussion. The reports and publications on ex- cavations at Hallan Çemi, Jerf  el-Ahmar, Tell ‘Abr 3, Dja‘de el-Mughara, Nevali Çori, Çayönü Tepesi, and Göbekli Tepe are extremely informative.1 Analysis of  the reports and other publications provides an opportunity to trace the development of  the general principles of  the erection of  cult structures in early Neolithic settlements in Northern Mesopotamia. II. A Review of the Evidence for the Construction of Cult Buildings in Northern Mesopotamia Hallan Çemi, in Southeastern Turkey, is a small permanent village dating to the be- ginning of  the PPNA period, that is, the last few centuries of  the ninth millennium b.c. (uncalibrated). This is one of  the oldest settlements in Northern Mesopotamia known today. The discovery of  various materials indicates the existence of  a complex, nonegalitarian form of  social and economic structure there2 and thus contributes to the evidence for the possibility of  public structures having existed in the settlement. Structures A and B in the uppermost building level differ from others excavated at the site in that they appear to have been differently planned, significantly larger in size, and * Research for this article was supported in part by In the footnotes works are cited by the author’s the Carnegie Research Fellowship Program, which is name with the year of  publication in brackets.

Unlike what is found in domestic structures, the floors in the public buildings of  the first level at Hallan Çemi were deliberately leveled down to the ground. There are traces of  spe- cific decoration and internal structures within the buildings that appear to have been carefully planned. For example, there is a stone semicircular bench set against the walls of  each structure along the entire perimeter. Evidence of  rare imported materials, such as obsidian and copper ore, is found exclusively in and around these buildings. Moreover, one of  the structures (fig. 2: A) contained the skull of  a Bos primigenius (the now-extinct aurochs) that appears to have once decorated the wall facing the entrance. The second structure (fig. 2: B) contained a few partially preserved sheep skulls and deer antlers, whose original location is difficult to determine. There were no other animal or plant remains found.4 The most recent findings conform to other cult evidence found at the site and confirm the idea that the structures had a specific function and that they were protected by symbols of  divine power.5 There was no evidence of  any domestic activities found in the unusual structures at Hallan Çemi other than specially marked fireplaces (plaster hearths on the floor). As already mentioned, valuable imported materials, in this case, obsidian and copper ore, as well as evidence of  traces of  their use, were found in the area of  the first building-level structures. Archaeologists point out that the presence of  these materials demonstrates the existence of  long-distance trade networks, even at that early time and, furthermore, that these large, unusual semisubterranean structures were somehow connected with this trade. They may have played a certain role in establishing and maintaining intersettlement con- tacts.6 Such links could have been cemented during the exchange of  goods, the signifi- cance of  which in ancient communities is well known. I propose that at Hallan Çemi the public structures of  the uppermost building level could have also functioned as production centers for the settlement and/or were the communal storage-and-distribution centers for imported raw materials. In any case, activities significant for the well-being of  the com- munity taking place within a sacred space was not unusual in ancient societies. Excavations at Hallan Çemi have also shown that the center of  the settlement was an open area about 15 m in diameter and in use throughout all three periods under analysis. Large numbers of  animal bones and river pebbles that had been cracked in fire were found on the square’s surface. Among the remains were large, well-preserved parts of  animal 3 The uppermost building level has thus far yielded ca. 1 cm thick, and several resurfacings were evident the remains of  four structures: two large, round semi- in each.

This discovery, along with the large number of  bones and evidence of  the continuous use of  the central square throughout several generations, are indications of  the symbolic rituals once performed here. Archaeologists suggest that the area was the community’s general meeting place and also the location of  ritual feasts, occasions that must have played an important role in uniting the members of  the community. Other discoveries at the site were numerous skillfully made stone bowls decorated with finely incised designs in geometric and naturalistic motifs and a number of  stone pestles with stylized handles sculpted in a variety of  zoomorphic forms. Both the bowls and the pestles are likely to have been used in the ceremonial acts of  cooking and eating during the feasts that took place in the central square, thereby playing an important role in the local ritual.7 Recent reports on Jerf  el-Ahmar and Tell ‘Abr 3 (Syria, Middle Euphrates) reveal that the public structures at these sites (EA 7 and EA 30 at Jerf  el-Ahmar during the PPNA period; EA 53 and EA 100 at Jerf  el-Ahmar and B2 at Tell ‘Abr 3 during the PPNA/PPNB transition period) in many ways develop the Hallan Çemi tradition of  public multifunc- tional structures that also served as sacred places in the settlements. In these cases, it is important to note the finds of  deposits of  aurochs bucrania inside benches lying against the walls of  the communal structures at Jerf  el-Ahmar (EA 53) and Tell ‘Abr 3 (B2) as well as inside EA 30 at Jerf  el-Ahmar and “Building 47” at Mureybet. The data connected with the finds at “Building 47” at Mureybet, located 40 km to the south of  Jerf  el-Ahmar, correspond to the many materials in EA 7 and EA 30 at Jerf  el-Ahmar during the PPNA period.8 The later EA 53 and EA 100 structures at Jerf  el-Ahmar and B2 at Tell ‘Abr 3 are comparable to Cult Buildings II and III at Nevali Çori as well as to the now well-known unique structures at Çayönü Tepesi: the Skull Building, the Terrazzo Floor Building, and the Flagstone Building (figs. 3 and 4) and, to all appearances, the “Communal Building” at Dja‘de el-Mughara, from the PPNB period;9 they have the following general characteristics: — a special location in the settlement area; — renewed structures at the same location; — the special preparation of  the location; — semisubterranean construction and large-room planning; — the architectural and sculptural elements of  the most ancient structures were included in subsequent ones; — the presence of  massive stone benches set against the walls of  each structure; — labor-intensive floor-paving (terrazzo-mosaic or tile-paved floor in Çayönü and Nevali Çori); — traces of  colored plaster, engraved pictures, and reliefs on the inner walls and/or the benches; 7 Ibid., pp. 26 and 28.

Archaeologists excavating at Tell ‘Abr 3 came across two similar structures: two hollows were found on the floor of  public building B2 near a bench decorated with massive plaques. They formed two channels leading towards the center of  the building. According to T. Yartah, these channels were paved with pebbles in white, black, and green. It looked as if  the pebbles had been picked according to their color.12 The layout of  these Çayönü Tepesi structures, which were renewed a number of  times and were in use throughout the entire PPNA/PPNB transition period and the PPNB period, is of  great interest. The structures were erected in the eastern part of  the settlement around a large, open area about 1,000 m2 in size. This part of  the site was clearly meant to be public from the start, and so it was arranged accordingly. There were about forty-six fire pits of  different sizes found at its lowest level, which dates back to the beginning of  the settlement. Apparently later, the large area was covered with cobbles and then leveled, and this resulted in the creation of  a large, open pebble-covered area, namely, the first “Pebbled Plaza” of  the site. This pebbled plaza also served as the foundation for the “Earth Plaza” that followed. Moreover, a large part of  the eastern section of  the site was prepared as a new square, 60 x 20 m in size, during the Cell Building Subphase. Its floor was neatly laid with the remains of  burnt brick (kerpiç) and/or the remains of  dung-burning in situ. Archaeologists have come to the conclusion that the reddish floor of  the square was renewed at least three times and was carefully cleaned before each renewal. The earliest square had two rows of  standing stones (uncarved stelae) that were set into it, and two large, grooved limestone slabs lay close to each other at the southeast corner.13 The objects were different in size, shape, and decoration, the largest stela exceeding 2 m in height and the smallest about 1 m in height. According to the archaeologists’ reports, at least one of  the stelae showed traces of  red paint, and another had some indications of  modeling.14 During the second renewal of  the square, the stelae had intentionally been broken and were buried under the layer of  burnt bricks, together with the grooved stone slabs.15 10 Most interestingly, traces of  human, sheep, and nature of  the building”; see A. R. Wood [1998], pp. 763– aurochs blood were observed on the large stone “table” 64, and see also M. Verhoeven [2002], p. 239. in the Çayönü Tepesi Skull Building. Moreover, both 11 Hauptmann [1993], p. 45; Schirmer [1983], p. 466 aurochs- and human-blood residue was present on a and [1990], p. 384. 20-cm-long black flint knife found in this structure. 12 At the same time, we know that the floor of  the The researchers who dealt with the blood-residue building had a brown mud coating on top of  a layer of investigations at Çayönü note that the “presence of chalk reduced to fine particles.

According to H. Çambel, the square could have been used for the ritual carving of  animal carcasses during collective feasts, since there were many animal bones and fragments of  specialized tools found here.16 As A. Özdogan mentions, a number of  factors indicate that the “Earth Plaza” was an open-air equivalent of  the “unique buildings” of  Çayönü Tepesi, albeit on a grander scale.17 All the evidence available today on Göbekli Tepe, another early Neolithic site in South- eastern Turkey (EPPNA-MPPNB), which is still being excavated, suggests that the site cannot be considered an ordinary settlement of  the Aceramic Neolithic period. This is due not only to the tell’s size (up to 20 m high with a diameter of  300 m) and topographical setting but also because it occupied the dominant position in the area within a radius of 20 km, clearly indicating that this was an important center. Huge limestone slabs, pillar fragments, and large sculptures were found over the entire mound. These discoveries, as well as the information from excavations carried out since 1995, indicate that the entire mound and not just part of  it had been used for megalithic architectural construction (figs. 5 and 6). The buildings must have been used for ritual purposes, since there are no indications of  any domestic activities. In this connection, Klaus Schmidt, Director of  Ex- cavations at Göbekli Tepe, notes that the tell was not just a typical early Neolithic village with a few cult buildings but that the entire area served a ritual purpose exclusively and was a mountain sanctuary (fig. 7). There is little doubt that the great building projects that took place over a long period of  time demanded enormous effort on the part of  many people, presumably the representatives of  generations of  tribes inhabiting the vicinity.18 The research started at Göbekli Tepe significantly broadens our knowledge of  the con- struction of  religious buildings in Northern Mesopotamia during the Aceramic Neolithic period; it allows us to arrive at some preliminary conclusions about the specifics of  the architectural and sculptural decoration of  sacred places in settlements during the period and in the region under discussion. There are good reasons to believe that the structures at Göbekli Tepe make up a long-term, sizable, and possibly intertribal ritual complex set up in the mountains and separated from the ordinary settlements. The structures at Göbekli Tepe are larger, more complex, and more varied in planning compared to public buildings in other Aceramic Neolithic sites. The great length (6 to 9 m) and weight (up to 50 tons) of  some of  the stelae and their fragments demonstrate the possibility that not all the build- ings housing them had roofs or, perhaps, that not all the stelae were initially kept inside the buildings. Finally, a number of  zoomorphic symbols and figures were found at Göbekli Tepe in addition to anthropomorphic ones, which predominate at Çayönü Tepesi and Nevali Çori. Furthermore, on part of  Göbekli Tepe there are combinations of  special signs de- picted (“hieroglyphs” or pictograms) whose meaning, at present, is difficult to define.19 The world of  sculptures and reliefs at Göbekli Tepe is diverse and unusual. In a way, however, it repeats and adds to the representative picture already known from Nemrik IX, Bouqraz, Hallan Çemi, Körtik Tepe, Jerf  el-Ahmar, Tell ‘Abr 3, Nevali Çori, Çayönü Tepesi, and other early Neolithic settlements. The most popular images found at the sites—the objects of  worship—are anthropomorphic and mixed-type creatures; female and male 16 Çambel [1984], p. 187. This can be compared, 17 A.

In Göbekli Tepe’s iconography there are also images of  a wild boar, a lion, a spider, and a fox. These motifs are characteristic for sites dating to the PPN period in general; however, in Upper Mesopotamia they are similar in meaning, style, and manner and are clearly concentrated in buildings having a special purpose. III. Discussion There are other very special finds that have been discovered in cult buildings in the settlements of  Northern Mesopotamia. These are vertical, rectangular stone stelae (fig. 8).20 Schmidt has suggested considering them receptacles of  deities or totem spirits, by analogy with European menhirs and Semitic massebs. The Slavic idols initially kept at the center of  sacred spaces or special cult structures are believed to have had a similar meaning.21 Some of  the carved columns at Nevali Çori, Jerf  el-Ahmar, and Göbekli Tepe clearly represent massive figures of  creatures exceeding the height of  a human being. At the same time, other slabs at Göbekli Tepe and Çayönü Tepesi indicate the presence of  deities in a building, albeit less clearly.22 The zoomorphic images and other signs on the Göbekli Tepe stelae undoubtedly conveyed certain meanings, as did the coloring and indications of modeling of  the objects discovered at Çayönü Tepesi. I would like to point out that one characteristic feature of  the stelae at Nevali Çori and Göbekli Tepe is their T-shaped tops, symbolizing a head and thereby personalizing the stone slabs. The fact that most stelae and pilasters, which must have had similar significance, were set up in pairs is of  great importance. The worship of  pairs of  central objects in ancient sanctuaries or temples is a characteristic feature of  a number of  early Near Eastern cul- tures. Such symbolism represents the binary basis and dualism of  people’s mythological perception of  natural phenomena. For a long period of  time, two-headed and/or paired characters were among the worshiped images in the Near East. Similar objects in Anatolia (Çatal Höyük, Hacılar, Kültepe), Syria (Tell Brak), and Jordan (‘Ayn Ghazal) date back to the prehistoric period. The divine couples who protected the first cities were well known 20 In the Levant there is very little evidence of  such 21 For more on Slavic idols and cult structures, see stelae. Similar objects, dating to the PPNB period, were I. P. Rusanova and B. A. Timoschuk [1993], pp. 12–15 found in excavations at Jericho (see Kenyon [1957]), and 25. ‘Ayn Ghazal (Rollefson [1998] and [2000]), and 22 It is noteworthy that the EA 53 and EA 100 col- Shaqarat Mazyad (B.

Understanding the purpose of  the vertical slabs that were the central objects in these impressive Aceramic Neolithic public structures should become clearer once the func- tion of  the structures themselves is identified. Some scholars suggested considering them temples,23 others strongly objected to this idea,24 and still others suggested waiting for further discoveries, since preliminary conclusions may not be accurate.25 I believe the exis- tence of  temples during the PPNB period is debatable and that in assuming this existence researchers are making attempts to modernize or adapt ancient reality to present-day ter- minology. Even in civilizations from much later periods, for example, the Sumerian and Akkadian—the former with the first written language in Mesopotamia—there was no special term corresponding to what is now meant by the word “temple.” The words “e2” (Sumerian) and “bitum” (Akkadian), which initially meant “house,” were also used for Mesopotamian cult buildings. The definition of  cult buildings as “houses” obviously originates in earlier cultures and, taking into consideration the archaeological evidence, corresponds to the interpretation of some public buildings from the PPN period. The creators of  the structures under discus- sion literally took them for “houses of  deities,” which, as I see it, corresponds to the evi- dence from Hallan Çemi, Jerf  el-Ahmar, Dja‘de el-Mughara, Tell ‘Abr 3, Çayönü Tepesi, Nevali Çori, and Göbekli Tepe. The horned skulls of  aurochs, the magnificent stelae, and the large-scale sculptures found in the area of  the unusual structures at these sites must have manifested the presence of  the “masters” of  the house, who would have been the patron deities of  the community. In this respect, it is quite natural that the layout (or some- times other building elements) of  the most ancient public cult structures demonstrates their “genetic” affinity to dwellings and, in all cases, to the ancient dwellings of  the EPPNA period, that is, structures of  a circular and semisubterranean type. It is well known that guarding tradition has always been a prerogative of  the sacred sphere and that it is still one of  the ways of  marking sacred space. IV. Conclusion Differences in the construction and decoration of  cult buildings in Hallan Çemi, Jerf  el- Ahmar, Dja‘de el-Mughara, Tell ‘Abr 3, Çayönü Tepesi, Nevali Çori, and Göbekli Tepe are due to the natural manifestation of  local sacred and architectural peculiarities and to the differences within the period when a complex was in use. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that, on the whole, the Göbekli Tepe materials illustrate the construction scenario of  the monumental cult structures in Jerf  el-Ahmar, Çayönü, and Nevali Çori,26 representing their most characteristic features: 23 Schmidt [1998] and [2006]; Bavgelen [1999], p. 8. formed in a rush within the very tight schedule of 24 J.-D.

A small groove runs from the outside diagonally into the bowl. Similar objects were found in other parts of  the site. Excavators have preliminarily called them “sacrificial bowls.”27 — the presence of  a stone bench against the walls around the stelae; — the erection of  monolithic stelae, pilasters, decorated pillars, and sculpted objects inside the structures; — the absence of  any trace of  domestic activities; — evidence of  various ritual ceremonies performed in the structures. The discovery of  a channel leading to a depression in the floor of  structure B (it is circular and belongs to the oldest PPNA/EPPNB layers of  the site) probably indicates that offer- ings(?) were presented here as in the cult structures with similar elements at Tell ‘Abr 3, Çayönü, and Nevali Çori. Similar stone slabs were used in cult structures having elements like those found at Çayönü Tepesi and Nevali Çori. Some of  the features listed above were determined on the basis of  the evidence obtained from public buildings at Hallan Çemi. This suggests that the formation of  the architectural tradition of  erecting such buildings in Upper Mesopotamia began during the earliest phase of  the Neolithic period. Accordingly, this architectural tradition originated in Northern Mesopotamia during the earliest Neolithic period, and it is possible that the tradition was adapted to new circumstances during the continuation of  a more ancient sacred-building construction dating to the Mesolithic period.28 On the whole, there are still few, but impressive, examples from Northern Mesopotamia that show that religious architecture was already considered a separate part of  the con- struction process during the early Neolithic stage of  Upper Mesopotamian community de- velopment and, furthermore, that this architecture had its own specific standards. But the analysis of  existing reports allows one to conclude that during the early Neolithic period a few types of  sacred places and structures existed across Upper Mesopotamia and contig- uous regions. My preliminary classification is based on the level of  the social importance of  cult centers and their decoration and location. The first group includes family sanctuaries, which existed in the Near East as early as the proto-Neolithic period. These structures were not yet clearly detached from dwell- 27 Schmidt [2001] (2) and [2006], pp. 133–34, analysis of  the animal bones revealed a rich fauna of fig. 51. wild species . . . , but no domesticated species have 28 One should note here that the lifetime of  the been identified.” And further, “Göbekli Tepe, at least oldest layer (III) of  Göbekli Tepe with its impressive in the lower layers with the megalithic pillars, was rounded megalithic architecture, including its mighty not really Neolithic, but Proto-Neolithic or Meso- T-pillars (more than 3 m high), is apparently even lithic. . . .

Schmidt reports: “The on certain sound reasons. </page> <page sequence="17"> Cult Buildings of Northern Mesopotamia 97 ings in settlements but were usually combined with them (for example, in Nemrik IX and Qermes Dere). Evidence obtained from Hallan Çemi and Çayönü Tepesi has revealed that among the most ancient decorated public structures there were public “squares” that functioned per- manently in the first long-term settlements as places for meeting and performing rituals that were important for the entire community. The combination of  symbolically protected (i.e., sacred) areas and those significant for production activities (production, product-exchange, and storage-and-distribution areas) is characteristic of  the communal structures at Hallan Çemi, Mureybet, and Jerf  el-Ahmar (EA 7 and EA 30). Archaeological data also indicate that special public cult buildings already existed during the Aceramic Neolithic period. Thus the Skull Building at Çayönü Tepesi functioned as the community’s burial place and was also used for performing special collective rituals, presumably aimed at helping the relatives of  those who had died and also at keeping the links and sacred unity between the living and dead members of  the community. The Terrazzo Floor Building and Flagstone Building at Çayönü Tepesi, EA 53 and EA 100 at Jerf  el-Ahmar, B2 at Tell ‘Abr 3, as well as Buildings II and III at Nevali Çori show the existence of  public cult buildings that were not directly linked to any burial rituals or domestic or production activities.29 I would like to emphasize that the structures at the sites mentioned above30 were erected on the border of  the settlements, that is, between the “dwelling” and “nonreclaimed” spaces, at the point where they “touched.” Supposedly such locations indicate that zones acted as links connecting the community of the settlement with the outside world. On the basis of  archaeological evidence and with the help of  general historical and ethnographical knowledge, it is possible to assume that the “masters” of  those prototemples had a special “genetic” connection both with the area of  the settlement and with the generations of  people who inhabited the land over a long period.31 The ancestor cult was combined with the worship of  natural forces and local spirits and was thus well developed. Finally, a large number of  outstanding works of  ancient art reflecting the complex ritual systems of  typical rites have been found at Göbekli Tepe. These examples allow us to con- clude that this settlement was of  great importance to the population as a religious center during the early Neolithic epoch. This supposition appears to be quite defensible in light of  the latest data on the PPN period. It needs to be confirmed, however, by further archae- ological research on comparable sites, ones chronologically close to Göbekli Tepe. In conclusion, I would like to point out that the definition of  types of  cult structures in early Neolithic Upper Mesopotamia is quite relative, and it is still difficult to establish certain distinctions between them due to the limited number of  data available. Another reason for the impossibility of  articulating a profound classification is that at some point there must have been some intermediate forms of  cult structures (which gradually evolved in their public significance and decorative design) and interim forms of  the rituals that were performed in them. 29 They bear a certain similarity to the unusual has not yet been discussed in enough detail. structures at ‘Ayn Ghazal and Beidha in the Southern 31 For more on this, see Kornienko [2006], pp. Levant; see Rollefson [1998] and D. Kirkbride [1966]. 82–83. 30 The context of  the B2 settlement in Tell ‘Abr 3 </page> <page sequence="18"> 98 Journal of Near Eastern Studies Despite the limited data, analysis shows to some extent the possibilities that were avail- able to the people (single families or tribes, the entire community, and probably even larger groups of  people) who erected the buildings and worshiped the deities living in them. I share the view that during the Aceramic Neolithic period the land within the borders of  the Levant, Upper Mesopotamia, and Iran was a single area in terms of  informational links. Moreover, there are signs of  probable standardization in PPN Northern Mesopota- mian architecture, including the construction of  religious buildings and the development in the tradition of  symbolic decoration of  these types of  structures since the earliest period of  settlement in Upper Mesopotamia. The evidence indicates that there were even closer links among settlements at the regional level, which may have been the result of  coopera- tion and mutual influence among the dwellers of  rural settlements in Aceramic Neolithic Northern Mesopotamia. As a result, a certain cultural unity emerged between separate, local centers, which seem to have played a leading role not only in the manufacturing and ex- change of  goods but also in the sphere of  ideology.
