Written from i943-47, her investigation was made independently of Manfred Bukofzer's important work on the same period.1 She received a copy of the latter while her book was in the print- er's hands in time to append a footnote to her bibliography: Bien que nous ayons envisage ici meme le Baroque musical sous un angle particulier, nous nous plaisons a souligner l'interet de ce bel ouvrage et nous nous rejouissons de nous trouver souvent en concordance avec son auteur [p. 240].

Attention is justly called, in the introduc- tion, to the semantic vicissitudes undergone in the course of three centuries by this in- nocent Portuguese word barroco, meaning "a pearl of irregular form." The bewilder- ing variety of definitions and usages is enough to create a challenge to the most indifferent of scholars. In its widespread pejorative sense the term is synonymous with bad taste, corruption, degeneration, disorder, decadence, ugliness, and full of excess. In a more neutral vein it signifies the bizarre, grotesque, irregular, odd, ex- travagant, strange, fantastic, high-flown, bombastic, and is used to denote an ex- uberance of forms growing out of the human desire to astonish and rouse the passions. Aesthetically it has been referred to as an art of movement, dynamism, varia- tion, abundance, contrast, mannerism, and the monumental. In a religious sense it re- fers to the Jesuit style, the rebirth of the church triumphant, an aspect of the Coun- ter Reformation, and a movement to ascend toward the absolute and infinite. Histori- cally it has been applied to the degenera- tion of Renaissance forms; more widely as a degenerative phase of all art styles, such as the flamboyant Gothic, and fin-de-sikcle Romanticism; and in general as an abuse of certain valid tendencies within the ex- pression of each period. In this latter sense it has found wide currency among French cultural historians, who see classicism as a norm and any departure therefrom as an aberration. A case in point is Focillon's theory of the evolution of the arts embrac- ing four successive stages: (r) an experi- mental age; (2) a classical age; (3) an age of refinement; and (4) a Baroque age. E. d'Ors goes even farther in pointing out a Baroque phase of every art period, thus dis- tinguishing; a Prehistoric Baroque; Primi- tive, Oriental (Buddhistic), Far Western (Incan), Alexandrian or Hellenistic, Roman (Pompeiian), Flamboyant Gothic, Tren- tan (Jesuit), Rococo, Romantic, and 19th- century fin-de-sidcle Baroques; and even a Post-World War I Baroque! In addition, nationalistic Baroques, such as Portuguese (Manuelian), Spanish, and Nordic, are found. In this sense it amounts to a dualism opposed to classicism, and this has influ- enced Mlle. Clercx in her conclusions. Actually it is an application of the gen- eral historical pendulum theory to aesthe- tics. It will readily be seen that this does not get us much beyond the 19th-century Classic-Romantic, or Apollonian-Dionysian dualisms, or Hegel's triple classifications of Primitive, Classic, and Romantic art. After W61fflin's studies the term "ba- roque" gained a certain aura of respectabil- ity, and into the bewildering maze con- temporary musical historians have bravely rushed where angels fear to tread, apply- ing this term to one of the most luminous periods in the evolution of the tonal art. It will thus be readily admitted that the author imposes on herself no small task when she sets out to reconcile these con- tradictory theories and to lead us out of the verbal wilderness into the promised land of aesthetic clarity. To accomplish this purpose the author, in a chapter entitled, "La Musique de l'6poque baroque," reviews the principal musical developments of the period begin- ning circa i550, without pretense of mak- ing original contributions to musical re- search as such. She touches briefly on such musical tendencies as: the isolation of the soprano and the taking over of the lower voices by instrumental groups, leading to the emergence of monodic writing with basso continuo accompaniment; the new language of the representative madrigal with the musical rendering of minute de- tails of the text; the new dramatic ele- ments in music; the effects of polychoral writing on the liturgical style; the new counterpoint; the opera, oratorio, and can- 2The Musical Quarterly, XXXV (1949), p. 654.</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 49 tata; the distinction of two types of mu- sical activity in the da chiesa and da camera styles; the emergence of particular mu- sical forms, i.e., the sonata, instrumental suite, concerto, trio sonata, keyboard forms; and comments on various national differences. A valuable section of the book, entitled "A la recherche d'un Baroque musical," is ably documented with well-chosen mu- sical examples. Of particular interest are the comments on the essential oppositions inherent in the Baroque style which some- how paradoxically and miraculously pro- duce a certain unity. Such dualities are: the opposition of soprano and bass; the spatial opposition of two or more choirs; opposition of various sonorous instrumen- tal masses; the antithesis of solo voice and instrumental ensemble; the alternation of homophonic and polyphonic textures; the contrast of the ideal of continuous prog- ress and the retrogressive tendency inher- ent in the da capo form; the alternation of sacred and profane elements; the expres- sively agitated recitative moving over a tranquil bass, and conversely, the serene melodic aria moving over a rhythmically agitated broken-chord accompaniment; regular versus irregular meters; juxtaposi- tion of slow and fast tempi; regular alter- nation of dissonance and consonance; and dynamic alternation between piano and forte. All of these, taken as a whole, emerge into a veritable law of antithesis, the resolu- tion of which into significant unity is cer- tainly one of the major distinguishing fea- tures of the Baroque style. In the process of induction from her musical material, the author distinguishes three distinct phases of the Baroque: (i) the Baroque primitif covering the transi- tional period from 1550 to i6oo, which is characterized by the breakdown of poly- phonic unity, the growth of the new homo- phony, the new treatment of the madrigal, and the growth of the new chromatic har- mony. This is a phase which emerges from a spirit of reaction and academicism to ex- press a new human orientation not so much concerned with universals and collective types as with the uniquely individual, and which gives birth to the newer art forms. (2) The plein Baroque running approxi- mately the entire course of the I7th cen- tury. This is marked by the emergence of new genres; the clarification of the church- and chamber-sonata types; the fusion of vocal and instrumental forms in the opera, and the toleration of the church for the opera style in the oratorio and cantata; distinctive melodic types; a harmony ex- ploiting the manifold possibilities of dis- sonance, surprise effects, and other new expressive devices; and a new concept of rhythm which finds means of expressing agitation, restlessness, acceleration and re- tardation of movement, creating an elan irrestible. (3) The Baroque tardif from 1700 to roughly 1740-65 where it reached its end in Mannheim, Paris, and Vienna. This phase is marked by the fusion of sa- cred and secular elements, and the confu- sion of the church and chamber sonatas and concertos; the abandonment of the four-movement sonata, marked by the for- mal symmetry of slow-fast-slow-fast, for the three movement fast-slow-fast organ- ization; the departure from the strophic form for the aria da capo; and the opera and oratorio becoming vast frescoes with regular successions of recitative, aria, chorus, and dramatic action, instead of juxtaposed madrigals. The clear codifica- tion of the grand law of the Baroque per- meates these forms-that of antithesis, the principle of multipolarity, the continuous interplay of opposites, paradoxically insur- ing unity and resulting in a unique gran- deur of expression. It is in this style classification within the historical period, accurate in most respects, that the author is on the firmest ground. Her subdivisions are essentially the same as Bukofzer's early, middle, and late Baroque. However, they are arrived at more from an intuitive point of view than on the basis of the musical evidence produced in this volume. Such statements as the above, that the I8th century first marked the abandon- ment of the strophic aria form and the choral procedure of juxtaposing of madri- gals in opera, are far too general and can- not be supported by the facts. There are other occasional inaccuracies. Even though the Ballo delle ingrate is found in a book of madrigals, it can hardly be referred to as Monteverdi's "madrigal cdldbre." Prof.</page><page sequence="4">50 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN MUSICOLOGICAL SOCIETY Bukofzer in his review has already called attention to some occasional slips in the names of composers. The lack of an index is to be considered a limitation on the book's general usefulness. The only "Amer- ican" publication included in the bibliog- raphy is a volume by Henri Peyre entitled Le Classicism franfais (New York, 1942), which is not listed in the Cumulative In- dex. However, in the bibliography's 67 entries some recent Continental contribu- tions to Baroque studies are included. From this point onward, in her final section, "Limites et propositions du Ba- roque musical," the author explores more purely speculative ground, going into the problems of the synchronization of the arts, the relative musical developments vis- d-vis other Baroque manifestations, and the possible meaning of the Baroque in a suprahistorical sense. All general aesthetic thought and theory concerned with the visual arts up to W61fflin's time had either ignored music or made but passing or cursory mention of it. At the same time, the various branches of the visual arts from architecture and sculpture to paint- ing, tended more and more to be treated as a unit. While this treatment has now been taken almost for granted, music criti- cism has lagged far behind. The value of opening this question, of course, is counter- balanced by the hazards of its extreme con- troversiality. The author begins by making a critical study of the critical theories of E. d'Ors, De Bruyne, Focillon, and Pannain; Croce and Della Corte; R. Engel, Haas, R. Her- bertz, Kroyer, Sachs (only the writings of 1919 are mentioned), Schenck, W61fflin, and Zenck. In comparing her findings to those of Focillon, she is led to the opposite conclusion. For the visual arts, Focillon has held that the historical process is from the archaic or experimental through classi- cal equilibrium to Baroque exuberance. With only a slight change of terminology these stages are, of course, Hegel's Primi- tive, Classical, and Romantic classifications. Mlle. Clercx's contrary conclusion is that musical developments proceed from the Baroque or experimental phase to Classi- cal poise and stability. Her justification lies principally in the fact that the "Vien- nese Classical Period" succeeds the Baroque period in time, and she adduces certain gratuitous parallels in preceding periods, such as a 15th-century "Baroque" leading to an early i6th-century polyphonic "Clas- sicism"; and earlier, a "Classicism" of the School of Notre Dame in Paris preceded by an experimental phase. This then leads her to the conclusion that the Baroque is not so much a historical style period as a human element, and as such transferable to all phases of historical evolution. In her enthusiasm to establish this Baroque-Classic dualism she goes to considerable length to explain away Romanticism. As an argu- ment she states: Nous pouvons affirmer que dans ce do- maine, il y a un style baroque, mais il n'y a pas de style romantique. Toute l'archi- tecture du XIXe siecle a vecu de neo- gothique, de n60-roman, de nbo-classique, de neo-baroque, etc. [p. 225]. Then in a corroborating footnote she quotes W. Weidle's remarkable conclusion that "Le romantisme n'est pas un style ... Le romantisme est la perte du style" [p. 225]. Having disposed of the inconvenience of Romanticism she reaches her ultimate conclusion that there is no absolute syn- chronization between the arts, but rather a synchronization between two poles of human sensibility, the Baroque and the Classic. Victoire de la vie, mais aussi image d'un conflit multiple, l'art de l'epoque baroque s'exprime a travers divers langages et nous avons d6fini les deux p6les entre lesquels viennent s'inscrire ses manifestations infini- ment variees et souvent contradictoires. De cette lutte, le Classique et le Baroque sont, tour a tour, vainqueurs [p. 234]. In the Preface E. De Bruyne had already stated the concurrence of these findings with those in his monumental three-volume study, Etudes d'esthitique medijvale,3 and he says: "I1 nous semble &amp;tabli desormais que l'attitude baroque correspond ' un type humain nettement d6fini" [p. 61. In both historical and aesthetic thought new ideas, new theories, and new classifica- tions are always welcome, and a reshuffling at times is a good antidote to the academic 3Bruges, I946.</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS 51 disease of "hardening of the categories" from which both professors and theore- ticians occasionally suffer. However, this seems to be going too far. When one be- gins to talk of Romanticism being Baroque in certain of its manifestations, or to dis- cuss Baroque phases of the high Roman- esque, only hopeless confusion can result. At best these terms are conveniences and each historical period contains within it- self many diverse tendencies. Indeed it is completely uncritical to continue to call the Viennese Period "Classical" when it is made up of such diverse tendencies, among others, as the gallant style, Rousseatuian naturalism, French sensibilite, German Sturm und Drang, Winckelmannian Neo- classicism, and I8th-century revolutionary thought, not to mention numerous survivals of Renaissance and Baroque musical and artistic devices. All these elements can even be found in the operas of one composer, Mozart. In what sense, then, are we to consider this period classical, and what, if anything, has a term referring, as it does in the visual arts, to the use of Greco- Roman forms to do with an I8th-century musical style-period? Since all periods are eclectic to some extent, why condemn just the 19th century? The fault lies in accept- ing classical phenomena at face value, whenever they appear, as being truly Greek or Roman. Greek columns and tetrachords, like nature, are part of the common heri- tage of mankind, and it is just as foolish to consider an age classical because it uses them, as it would be to attribute the dis- covery of nature to Rousseau. All are historical phenomena common to each age, and the distinctive feature of each period is how it handles its columns and what its particular conception of nature is. The Florentine Renaissance, for all its theories of Greek humanism, is still inescapably Florentine; in architecture there is surely as much difference between 19th-century cast-irori Gothic construction and the Ca- thedral of Chartres, as there is between the Dies irae in Liszt's Totentanz and the original Gregorian setting; or between an early Ioth-century GOthic novel and an example of I3th-century literature. Hence it is in the manner of handling, not in the material used, that the significance lies. The panorama of history is far too vast for any such ready-made and simple du- ality. If we are to assume that the Baroque spirit is timeless and can appear anywhere at any time, then why not the Hellenistic spirit and the Byzantine spirit? Then what are we going to do with them as style- periods? Spengler's anthropomorphic cul- tural evolutions from the atavistic crudities of childhood through classic maturity, mel- lowing Romanticism, and the final deca- dence of old age, are now considered only fictional analogies. One might as well postulate a human Romanticism of the late teens and twenties, a Classicism of the thirties and forties, and a portly Baroque of the fifties and sixties. This is not to speak against poetic fancy, but to advise extreme caution in its application to his- tory. The convenient designations of Gothic, Renaissance, and Baroque, as con- veniences, are useful up to a point. But the complex aeschetic and ideational nexus that underlies each period cries out for more investigation. Here in the history of ideas can be found the common bases underlying the bewildering diversity of the manifold expressions in the visual arts, literature, and music; not in the surface manifestations, the techniques, the mate- rials used in the realizations of the ideas. Only when we have clearly defined our terms can we begin to talk of the Baroque with some precision, and it will serve far better as a term for a historical style-period with definite temporal limitations than for a human attitude discernible throughout all human development. However, we can be grateful to the author for reopening a fascinating, if elusive, problem. WILLIAM FLEMING Syracuse University</page></plain_text>
