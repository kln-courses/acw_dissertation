<plain_text><page sequence="1">Fink, Hach, and Dwight's Beethoven in 1843-44 Ora Frishberg Saloman The response of John Sullivan Dwight to Ludwig van Beethoven's symphonies is central to his pioneering contribution to public under- standing of the symphonic genre in America. Dwight (1813-93),1 widely regarded as the first American music critic, was stimulated to write his initial essay considering instrumental music after hearing three of Beethoven's large-scale works, including the Symphony no. 5 in C Minor, op. 67, in orchestral performance. The document is noteworthy in the history of Beethoven's reception in America as a symphonic composer and transitional in Dwight's incipient musical aesthetics and critical discourse. Both aspects can be clarified by dis- covering and identifying varied European sources with which Dwight was directly familiar in the process of acquiring his independent musi- cal learning.2 Little is known, and least of all from a musicological perspective, about Dwight's early musical thought in the years before he gained a formidable reputation as founder and editor of the influential Dwight's Journal of Music (1852-81).3 Clues to the formation of his musical views can be found in scattered and relatively inaccessible materials from the era coinciding with the first clearly identified public orches- tral performances of Beethoven's complete symphonies sponsored by the Boston Academy of Music beginning in 1841; before that year, except for isolated and occasional instances, Beethoven's symphonies, as full orchestral compositions, were largely unknown by the Ameri- can public.4 This paper traces the hitherto unrecognized connection between the symphonic thought of (Christian) Gottfried Wilhelm Fink, the Leipzig music editor and critic--with his unavowed references to ideas introduced by E. T. A. Hoffmann, the eminent German critic who had earlier contributed to the Leipzig Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung- and essays written in America by the German-born Boston editor and musician H. Theodor Hach as well as by Dwight. 488</page><page sequence="2">Beethoven in America 489 John S. Dwight (1813-1893)</page><page sequence="3">490 The Musical Quarterly Among the leading critical documents of the early nineteenth century is the epochal review of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony pub- lished anonymously by Hoffmann in 1810 in the Leipzig Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung. In it, Hoffmann heralded instrumental music as separate by its nature from the sensory world of the actual: "Music unlocks for man an unfamiliar world having nothing in common with the external material world which surrounds him. It is a world where he forgets all feelings which he could define for another in order to surrender himself to the inexpressible."5 This world of thought found striking resonance in Dwight's 1843 essay "Academy of Music- Beethoven's Symphonies,"6 in which he, like Hoffmann, prefaced extended comments about the Fifth Symphony with an aesthetic credo that accorded to instrumental music his highest recognition as a spe- cial world beyond the linguistic realm. Of music Dwight wrote: "It begins where speech leaves off. When we have fairly entered its ele- ment, it alone is all-sufficing; it explains itself, but it transcends speech and all this defining whim of the understanding.'"7 Although Hoffmann and Dwight attached preeminent value to instrumental art music for its qualities beyond the definable, signifi- cant differences between their positions can also be discerned. Both associated sublimity and yearning with Beethoven's Fifth Symphony, but for Hoffmann, it opened an imaginary realm clouded by "terror, 44. pain .. and endless longing," which he overtly connected to Romanticism;8 for Dwight, these emotions and premonitions neither prevailed nor led to a use of the term, Romantic. Hoffmann's anxiety- filled vision of the spirit realm and insistence on "endless longing" through a fascination with unity dominated his experience of this work.9 Dwight believed that Beethoven was the "most spiritual" com- poser, bringing humanity into higher unity with the Infinite; he and his German-born predecessor, Hach, shared instead a later dynamic perspective based on Fink's ideas, in which the finale of the Sym- phony in C Minor was a joyous zenith overcoming uncertainty and struggle. This framework for a study of the European contexts of Dwight's Beethoven includes other writers linking Hoffmann to Dwight. The Boston critic read the writings of G. W. Fink, editor of the Leipzig Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung from 1828 to 1841, and H. Theodor Hach, a cellist and music teacher who left Germany for Boston in the late 1830s where he and T. B. Hayward founded The Musical Magazine; or, Repository of Musical Science, Literature, and Intelligence (1839-42). These German connections in Boston aided Dwight's active efforts to learn about symphonic music at a time when very few</page><page sequence="4">Beethoven in America 491 educational or concert institutions existed in America; until then, a representative work such as William S. Porter's The Musical Cyclope- dia, published in 1834 in Boston, carried only a short reference to the genre of the symphony as a three-movement work with a middle min- uet and trio.o10 One source to which Dwight had access as early as 1838 was the Encyclopidie der gesammten musikalischen Wissenschaften, oder Universal- Lexicon der Tonkunst, edited by Gustav Schilling and published in Stuttgart between 1835 and 1838. That Dwight had the opportunity to use this six-volume work at that early date can be attested conclu- sively by a citation with a footnote giving only the short title, Univer- sal Lexicon der Tonkunst, found in the manuscript of his volume of translations with notes, Select Minor Poems, Translated from the Ger- man of Goethe and Schiller, 11 which he completed by the end of 1838. Dwight's notes to Friedrich Schiller's "An die Freude" ("To Joy") refer to Beethoven's use of it in his Ninth Symphony.12 It is likely that he might have turned for further insight at that time to the lengthy and authoritative entry on symphony by Gottfried Wilhelm Fink. In any case, Dwight would have been apprised or reminded of it when Hach translated sections of Fink's article in his 1842 essay. When the Boston Academy of Music presented early complete orchestral performances in 1842 of Beethoven's Sixth and Fifth Sym- phonies, respectively (January 15, February 5, and February 26, March 26), Dwight was able to attend; by then, he had left the ministry and returned to the Boston area from Northampton to serve as teacher of music and Latin at the utopian community, Brook Farm, in West Roxbury. These performances galvanized Hach and Dwight to respond swiftly; each was a champion of orchestral music and of the Acade- my's leadership in sponsoring these concerts. Dwight gave an unpub- lished lecture on 10 March 1842 devoted to "Beethoven's The Pastoral Symphony and the Symphony in C Minor"'3 while Hach reacted with an essay devoted to the same two works entitled "Bee- thoven's Symphonies," whose publication he delayed until it could appear on 24 April 1842 in the final issue of his Musical Magazine. 14 For the symphonic framework, Hach, an important intermediary of Continental and English musical thought to American readers, trans- lated substantial excerpts from Fink's essay--comprising about three and one half of his own fourteen pages-before introducing commen- tary about the music. Hach mentioned only Fink's name without sup- plying the title of the article or its source, but I have identified it as Fink's entry "Symphonie oder Sinfonie" in the Universal-Lexicon. 15</page><page sequence="5">492 The Musical Quarterly Despite Fink's conservatism, his writings provide a valuable per- spective on contemporaneous musical thought.16 One of these was a rich source of musical information for the youthful American who was then dedicating himself to the field as author and teacher. In the autumn of 1842, James Russell Lowell invited Dwight to contribute an article to the inaugural issue of his periodical, The Pioneer. "Academy of Music--Beethoven's Symphonies" appeared in January and February 1843 in a forum celebrating the new and universal in literature and the arts and intended for the "intelligent and reflecting portion of the Reading Public."'17 It provides evidence that Dwight was very familiar with Hach's discussion of the Fifth Symphony, which he lauded as "ingenious and satisfactory,"'is and was also conversant with Fink's ideas. Besides a discussion of varying descriptions of the symphony and its impact on the listener, Fink's entry also included commentary on its general structure, character, texture, and compositional goals. He insisted on Franz Joseph Haydn's being the creator of a new type of instrumental music, which he called die grosse Symphonie, "the grand symphony." Emphasizing the German origins of this genre, while rejecting claims for its French or Italian roots, he referred to Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven as "our three heroes in this German-created kind of music,"'19 a formulation that Hach transmitted to American readers and Dwight reiterated in establishing the symphonic canon. The "grand symphony," according to Fink's nineteenth-century concept, was a lively work representing some general feeling, per- formed by a mass of instruments, and enjoyed by a vast number of listeners. An original and striking subject of inherent individual char- acter was to be the idea, capable of evolving organically by means of a broad "unity of design together with the greatest variety." Decades earlier, in his review of 1810, E. T. A. Hoffmann had stressed the organic structural unity of design in Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. Although Fink had quoted from Hoffmann's review (without referring to the author) in a previous essay on the symphony appearing in the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung in August 1835, he did not acknowl- edge his earlier source in the influential essay in the Lexicon. 20 In developing his theory of the symphony, Fink considered it from several perspectives. It had been called previously "the opera of the instruments,"'21 although Fink did not identify the author of that statement, and it was like a musical drama. Again, Hoffmann said this first in a review in 1809,22 praising the new heights to which Haydn and Mozart had brought instrumental music through the symphony and declaring it the highest in its realm analogous to the position of</page><page sequence="6">Beethoven in America 493 opera in the vocal sphere. Fink retained this conclusion. Hoffmann had further asserted that, as in a drama, the symphonic genre stimu- lated the new characteristic activity of all the individual instruments in the symphonic whole in contrast to their old-fashioned and limited use in the concerto grosso.23 Fink omitted this thought entirely. Fink then introduced his own preferred comparison of the sym- phony to a dramatically imbued sentimental novel [einer dramatisirt gehaltenen Geftihls-Novelle]. According to him, a grand symphony must possess some psychological development of feelings expressed in tones and articulated through the instruments, which were to be care- fully grouped to represent the desired feeling.24 When Fink accounted for the extraordinary impact of Beetho- ven's symphonies, he again drew on the characterization of 1810 by Hoffmann, who had by then placed the younger composer on the same level with Haydn and Mozart.25 Hoffmann's supernatural realm of "gigantic shadows" in Beethoven became transmuted into Fink's more explicit images of "magicians and fairies intermingling with our human doings" through Beethoven's instrumental music, which Fink did not connect to Romanticism.26 H. Theodor Hach transmitted not only Fink's description, but also his principle of "unity combined with the greatest variety"; the grand symphony was regarded as the highest, most weighty and richly sonorous type of instrumental music. He conveyed Fink's idea of the symphonic genre as one in which different characters act in diverse situations "round [sic] a principal character and a principal view of life, for one definite purpose."27 Hach also noted Fink's view that if an external model had stimulated the composer's imagination, it must be brought before the "internal eye" of the listener through tones. Asserting that the keys and character of individual symphonic move- ments were strongly related to each other, Hach questioned if their connection to the initial musical subject of a grand symphony justified imagining in it "a certain story, a certain poem, a distinct course of ideas." He decided in the affirmative, reinforcing Fink's assertion that the symphony must have "some sentiment, some psychological devel- opment of a train of feelings not altogether foreign to the mass; other- wise it would contain but unmeaning tones."28 Maintaining that in the Fifth Symphony Beethoven's unity of design and its mounting interest from beginning to end argued for the composer's intention to represent one object, Hach applied to each of the movements the image of "The Skeptic; honestly searching after truth, and on whom it flashes at last";29 thus, after the strife and doubt of the first movement, the Andante variations represented a</page><page sequence="7">494 The Musical Quarterly prayer for truth, the Scherzo an active striving toward it, and the finale a triumphal hymn joyous in its ultimate rediscovery.30 This professional musician supported that idea, however, through a musical description of the psychological nature and structural relationships of keys, including the employment of strategically placed dissonant chords and their resolution, and instrumental activity. Dwight's approach to the Fifth Symphony centrally considered the listener's response. To him, the very act of listening with others to a Beethoven symphony constituted a high social pleasure and a manifestation of how an audience could be uplifted through music: "Rarely is there an assembly, where all are so lifted above themselves, and made to forget their selfish partialities . . . as an assembly on whom Beethoven and the orchestra have begun to work."31 Dwight was genuinely committed to the notion of enlightenment through collective association. He placed central emphasis on the orchestral music of Beethoven as the essential key in promoting a beneficial moral impact on listeners as a group, an idea he reiterated frequently thereafter. Dwight diverged fundamentally from Fink and from Hach on the application of defined images to symphonic music, leading him to originate his own theory of criticism applicable to it. For this reason, the writing of 1843 is significant in Dwight's intellectual development. It represents a tentative first effort to confront this genre and does not yet attempt a symphonic theory, as would his essays of 1845; however, it enabled him to consider the problem of "meaning" in symphonic music posed by Fink and by Hach and others. Dwight branded as "quackery" any pretense of associating a defi- nite story with a symphony because that approach led to hearing only with the limited power of the "understanding" without engaging the higher poetic and intuitive faculties. He believed that instrumental music was music proper and that it transported the listener beyond specific thoughts or visual imagery to change his or her state. Dwight encouraged the listener to add a technical knowledge of musical principles to the internal spiritual essence of the musical expe- rience. Tempting as it might be to trace a connected story through emotions aroused by the principal subject in the unfolding of a sym- phony, whose musical characteristics Dwight considered to be unity and logical consecutiveness, he cautioned that a story could never be an interpretation of the music, but only an "allegorical illustration" in the spirit of the music. On this basis, he moved easily in and out of the imaginative sections of his critical discourse. Dwight's theory of criticism created a mechanism that permitted the use of allegorical illustration without challenging the capacity of</page><page sequence="8">Beethoven in America 495 instrumental music itself to evoke the ineffable. Music, being infinite in its meaning, could impart personal revelations to every hearer, who would be free to imagine a "fancied resemblance" that would be "entirely in the spirit of the music" and who could share with the music its original conception based on "genuine poetic creation." "What moved the composer to make a symphony, moves the inter- preter to make a poem; out of one and the same spirit, they create in their several ways, and there will be a spiritual correspondence between the two products, so that the impression of the one will not disturb, but only illustrate that of the other."32 Dwight sought to resolve the apparent contradiction posed by others, including Hach, who had advanced various but definite literary interpretations of the Fifth Symphony. They had been shaped funda- mentally, Dwight suggested, by universally shared experience in "the great life-struggle, the contradiction between the Ideal and the Actual." But Dwight, unlike Hach, did not apply specific imagery to each movement. He perceived in the first Allegro a human conflict with necessity; the Andante was lyric, grave, tender; the Scherzo proposed action as ideal in its impetuous restlessness; and the finale was a "glorious Triumphal March." However, he used anthropomorphic language to ascribe dramatic human characteristics to the instruments, as had E. T. A. Hoffmann:33 the cellos "discourse," the earnest sounds of the bassoon "take up and vary" the theme, and in the third move- ment, "How the basses labor and tug in broken efforts; though baffled oft, they carry the point at last."34 Among the important sources of Dwight's biographical references are Anton Schindler's life of Beethoven and Bettina Brentano von Amim's ostensible remembrances of conversations with Beethoven. Ignaz Moscheles, editor of Schindler's biography in the 1841 English edition, had added in a supplement three letters supposedly written by Beethoven to Amim, of which only one is now considered genuine,35 and Amim's communication (dated 28 May 1810) to Goethe taken from her controversial Goethe's Correspondence with a Child. From these materials, Dwight extracted sections that reinforced his belief in Beethoven's spiritual faith in an "infinite, to be attained" and the composer's conviction of a unity in his symphonies.36 When con- fronted with Schindler's skepticism concerning the reliability of Amim, and Moscheles's belief in the authenticity of the correspon- dence, Dwight cited statements reinforcing his view that if Beethoven had not pronounced these words, he had expressed their spirit in his music. 37 Dwight's approach to the structure of the first movement of the C Minor Symphony acknowledged two main divisions within which</page><page sequence="9">496 The Musical Quarterly he described themes, main keys, character, and rhythmic and instru- mental features; at this time, he did not use the terms exposition, development, recapitulation, or so-called "sonata form," although a writer in Philadelphia referred briefly to the first two as early as 1845.38 The following excerpt from Dwight's essay of 1843 shows his treatment of the symphony's first and second subjects. He goes from description of the initial motive and its treatment to fanciful allegori- cal illustration of its impact, by means of the transitional phrase "It is as if," before reconsidering musical materials. He emphasizes the open- ing motive's inherent flexible design capable of providing unity together with the variety introduced by the "distant mellow horns," which anthropomorphically "take up the three notes in a higher strain, and fall into another key." Here, Dwight combines basic musi- cal description and subjective poetic material corresponding to an auditor's impression of the spirit of the work, an approach intended to assist readers and listeners in a milieu in which the "science of music" was just beginning to be acknowledged: The subject is announced with startling distinctness at the outset, in three short emphatic repetitions of one note falling upon the third below, which is held out some time; and then the same phrase echoed, only one degree lower. This grotesque and almost absurd passage, com- ing in so abruptly, like a mere freak or idle dallying with sounds, fills the mind with a strange uncertainty, as it does the ear; for as yet the note is wanting, which determines the key of the piece. Still more is this vague apprehension increased, when on the ground-tone of C minor this little phrase, once boldly struck, as if by chance, multiplies itself in rapid, soft reiterations, which chase each other round from voice to voice throughout the whole band, first climbing the heights of the trebles, then again down darting through the unfathomable abyss of bass. It is as if a fearful secret, some truth of mightiest moment, startled the stillness where we were securely walking, and the heavens and the earth and hell were sending back the sound thereof from all quarters, "deep calling unto deep," and yet no word of explanation. What is it? What can all this mean? What a world of earnest, strange, portentous voices we set ringing round our heads, when we chanced to stumble upon that seemingly unmeaning phrase of the three notes! Strange and unendurable suspense, dreading we know not what! Comes there no sign of hope? Yes--when the burst of mingling echoes has once spent itself, there is a moment's pause, and then the distant mellow horns take up the three notes in a higher strain, and fall into another key, the warm and confident E flat major-and on this basis the counter- theme is introduced, a strain of sweetest love and promise, an unlocking</page><page sequence="10">Beethoven in America 497 of the springs of good affection in the soul, as if to drown all doubt. How vain! for still the ground trembles; and even now those three dread notes are never silenced; they only sink down into the bass, and there, all too audible, though deep and muffled, shake away at the foundations, and contradict the upper melodies. These are the themes.39 As we have seen, Dwight's response to the symphonic Beethoven was shaped by widely diverse sources spanning the late eighteenth to the early and mid-nineteenth centuries. If he did not call Beethoven's music "Romantic," he sought and found in it that idealized striving "to embrace the infinite" conveyed in Schiller's works, that communi- cation "from the heart to the heart" and exaltation of instrumental music imparted in Hoffmann's critical views and discussed by subse- quent authors. Dwight's Beethoven was the artist as composer through whose boundless musical yearning "to embrace the whole" human beings could be ennobled and enlightened according to an ideal of binding universal harmony. That conviction sustained Dwight as he learned from Fink, among others, about compositional aspects of the symphonic genre, and from Hach,40 whom he respected, about the shaping of critical discourse applicable to Beethoven's symphonies. The findings concern- ing Dwight's knowledge of Fink's essay are supported and enhanced by statements from another of his writings published in January 1844. Explaining the importance of Haydn who, together with Beethoven, had introduced the new "boundless world, it may be called, of Instru- mental Music, " Dwight described the challenge of symphonic music according to principles enunciated by Fink and, earlier, Hoffmann. Retaining Fink's evolutionary stance in referring to the increasing independence of instruments in eighteenth-century music, Dwight asserted that the problem of the new symphony was "to combine the greatest variety into a perfect unity; and, as in nature, to give every part its individuality and separate life, while they so blend and work together, either by harmony or contrast, that one thought shall make itself felt as the soul of the whole." 41Contrasting Haydn's "perfection of style" and cheerful, "easily understood" music to the "yearnings and uncontainable rhapsodies" of Beethoven, Dwight stressed two features of the symphonic genre--unity achieved from the greatest variety and the characteristic activity of all the instruments as one unit; this emphasis confirms his serious study of Fink's essay, in particular. In the writings of 1843-44, Dwight set the foundation for his lifelong interest in the instruments of the symphonic orchestra as</page><page sequence="11">498 The Musical Quarterly agents whose independent character and will must be blended to cre- ate a unified entity, just as, he believed, people must be free to express their individuality while working to create a unified commu- nity. In his first statement on Beethoven's symphonies appearing in The Pioneer, he combined with his critical theory of "allegorical illus- tration" autobiographical, biographical, and emotive description;42 expansion of these ideas and devices in his major essays on the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Symphonies in 1845 would show his increased awareness of the musical connection between basic syntactical events within large-scale structures. Dwight's essays of the 1840s attest to the central significance of Beethoven's symphonies in his musical thought and in his leadership toward the building of an American critical tradition in music.

According to Fink, Beethoven's music made "heroes, spirits, magicians, and fairies intermingle with our human doings, and lightnings from the dark night above strike over the mountain peaks into the fertile valley" (my translation).

Hach, 393-94, based on Fink, "Symphonie oder Sinfonie," 547: "aus welcher ein Spiel vielfacher Charaktere, um einen Hauptcharakter und eine Haupt-Lebensan- sicht in gar mannigfachen Situationen sich drehend, zu einem einzigen bestimmten Zwecke sich ergiebt." 28. Hach, 396, based on Fink, "Symphonie oder Sinfonie," 550: "Irgend einen Empfindungsinhalt, irgend eine psychologische Entwickelung eines der Masse nicht wildfremden oder ganz unzuginglichen Geffihlsganges, der zu einer Tendenz fihrt, muss sie haben; ohne dies wiren es ja nur nichtssagende T6ne." 29.

After contributing generously to American musical life as editor, writer, and cellist (in solo and chamber music performances), as well as principal teacher of music and general assistant at the Perkins Institution and Massachusetts Asylum For the Blind, Hach returned with his family to Germany in 1846. The Institution warmly thanked him for his "valuable services" and expressed its "high regard for him as a man and a teacher" in its Fourteenth Annual Report of The Trustees of the Perkins Insti- tution and Massachusetts Asylum For the Blind, to the Corporation (Cambridge, 1846), 22. My thanks to Kenneth Stuckey, Research Librarian of the Perkins School For The Blind in Watertown, for his informative assistance in this regard. 41. J. S.
