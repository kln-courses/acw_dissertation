<plain_text><page sequence="1">joint Meeting of the Aristotelian Society with the Oxford Philosophical Society in Keble College, Oxford, on Sunday, January 26th, at 8.15 p.m. I.-WHAT IS A METAPHYSICAL STATEMENT? By D. M. MACKINNON. IN recent years, philosophers have concerned themselves with the perfection of various types of analytic method, whereby they have sought to eliminate from every kind of factual utterance the remotest suggestion of that which lay beyond the limits of a possible sensuous or introspective experience. For instance, in the discussion of the nature of material things, or to be more precise, of the meaning of material-thing sentences, we have seen various highly ingenious attempts to make plausible some form of pheno- menalism. Such attempts have met with varying success, but underlying them lies the conviction that however much our common sense beliefs about the substantial or quasi- substantial character of material objects may make us unwilling to admit the claims of phenomenalism, none the less reflection on the actual procedures whereby we deter- mine whether or not a given proposition about the material world is true or false, should suffice to convince us that in the constitution of the material world there can be nothing which is not revealed to us by sense experience. If there is any such thing, it can never be for us the subject of significant assertion. Other methods too have been pursued by philosophers which have had for their goal an even more thorough- going dissolution of our various bewilderments, and the removal of the remotest suspicions from our minds that there is anything in the world of every-day life which should occasion theoretical perplexity, always granting (in Berkeley's words) that we do not ourselves make a dust and then complain that we cannot see. For instance we are A</page><page sequence="2">2 D. M. MACKINNON. reminded how often the supposition that all terms what- soever are capable of ostensive definition may plunge us head-first into the most appalling perplexities. Thus there have been persons who have contended (apparently ignor- ing the presence of a clock on their mantelpiece) that we cannot measure time. When they are pressed to elucidate their perplexity they argue that in so far as in the measure- ment of spatial magnitudes all the parts of the magnitude in question must be simultaneously co-present, and in so far as temporal magnitudes are constituted by a series of successive events, the extent of the latter cannot be the subject of measurement. Their error is of course obvious. It derives from the artificial restriction of the use of the term measurement to refer to operations performed on magnitudes of a certain determinate kind. It ignores the possibility that, for magnitudes of a certain other deter- minate kind, an analogous function may be performed by operations of another determinate kind. The term measure- ment does not mean any one thing. To borrow a con- temporary word, its "grammar " is much more subtle than that, and it is only when one lacks adequate insight into the relations obtaining within the family of more or less resemblant operations the term is used to signify, that one makes the puzzling and paradoxical statement we have noted. The task of the philosopher finds itself ful- filled in the bestowal of sufficient insight to make the generation of such pseudo-problems impossible. It will be obvious that there are some considerable differences between the presuppositions of the programme of the phenomenalist, and of those of this latter conception of the method and scope of philosophy. There is little doubt that certain phenomenalists have tended to assume that all terms are capable of ostensive definition. It would be rash to suppose that the two doctrines were not closely linked together, but it would be equally rash to assume that they can either of them be reduced to terms of the other. None the less, it is with their agreement that we are concerned in the first part of this paper. They agree most strikingly in the underlying assumption that the task</page><page sequence="3">WHAT IS A METAPHYSICAL STATEMENT ? 3 of the philosopher is eliminative or to put it crudely, that he is trying to get rid of something. One may define this something by a reference either to that which lies " behind " phenomena, or to the headaches that ensue upon imperfect insight into the elasticity of our language, varying the sense of " get rid of " accordingly. One of the questions with which we shall be most concerned in this paper is the nature of what for want of a better term may be called the background of these eliminative operations. But first one must attend to another question-namely, what it is that is being eliminated. Now it is common to refer to all such philosophical eliminanda by the term metaphysical. Whether one is concerned with the more ambitious pursuit of a thorough-going phenomenalist programme, or with the less ambitious dissolution of individual philosophical perplexities, what one is concerned to clear away is always dubbed metaphysical, and sometimes, in more optimistic mood, metaphysical lumber. Now the scheme of this paper is as follows firstly, to determine the precise senses which the term metaphysical bears when it is predicated of these eliminanda, secondly, to determine how this sense of the term metaphysical is related to the sense in which philosophical systems of the past have been called metaphysical, and thirdly, to make some general remarks concerning what has been called the background of the process of elimination. This programme may seem comparatively unambitious and indeed more like philosophical exegesis than analysis proper. But, as we are constantly informed that inadequate insight into the logic of our language is the most fruitful source of error in philosophy, it may perhaps be not unprofitable to scrutinize here and now the use of a certain technical term in the writings of some of the more interesting contemporary philosophers. It sometimes appears that some of these philosophers, at any rate, regard the term as capable of definition. It is a simple abstractible character of a finite class of errors, those errors be it said in which philo- sophers are most interested. Now what is surely worth investigating is the relationship between this sense of the A2</page><page sequence="4">4 D. M. MACKINNON. term metaphysical and the sense in which the term is con- ventionally attached to the writings of various classical philosophers; e.g., Plato, Aristotle, St. Thomas, Leibniz, Bradley. It seems to me at least arguable that the assertion that the sense which the term bears when it is predicated of various types of confusion and error is the same as that which it bears when asserted of the writings of systematic philosophers is due to the assumption as self-evident of certain propositions concerning what I have called the background of analytic procedures which seem to me very far from possessing the evidence which is claimed for them. I would like at the outset to apologize for certain of the terms that I have used in this introductory section of my paper. I am aware that they are somewhat vague in content and metaphorical in form. But I wanted at this stage in my argument deliberately to refrain from com- mitting myself to too definite a view of their significance. It seems to me clear that their import differs in the writings of some of the philosophers we shall be considering and as a carefully guarded vagueness seems to me a virtue as well as a vice in philosophy, I have deliberately have contented myself with the relatively indeterminate. At a later stage in my paper I shall endeavour to achieve a greater pre- cision. I. What does the term metaphysical mean when it is used to eliminanda of the kind I have specified ? Now, it seems to me to be much clearer what the term means when it is used of eliminanda by those we conventionally call phenomenalists than when it is used by analysts who pursue a different method. In the case of the phenomenal- ist one can perhaps best describe the eliminanda by the metaphorical expression the " things behind the curtain." We have all of us read detective stories in which the presence of an unknown somewhat behind the curtain has occasioned terror in the occupants of a room. The curtain bulges inwards slightly and assumes the shape of a revolver. Similarly on other occasions we believe in the reality of</page><page sequence="5">WHAT IS A METAPHYSICAL STATEMENT? 5 some cause of the disturbances of which we are immediately aware, that is not itself at first evident to us. Now phe- nomenalists seem to believe that all metaphysical philoso- phizing is reducible to terms of an illicit generalization of this perfectly familiar process of referring sensible effects to not immediately sensible causes. We are, they argue, at the mercy of our tendency to extend beyond the limits of possible experiential confirmation a process that is valid only when such confirmation is possible. The process of causal inference can only be employed validly when the cause or the effect that is inferred is of such a kind as to be the object of possible sensuous experi- ence, however remote and difficult the achievement of that experience may be. We cannot employ in the determina- tion of a metempirical cause of our experience methods that are valid only within the context of that experience. The sensible world impresses us by its stability, by the regularity and order which it manifests, by the fact indeed that this order is of a sufficient degree of simplicity and determinateness to admit its description by means of scientific laws. We are therefore tempted to assume that it is grounded in something other than itself. We come to talk of a material world as if it were something over and above the sensible world. Sometimes, as was the case with those metaphysicians with whom Berkeley was prin- cipally concerned, we tend to assume that this metaphysical material world is revealed to us by means of those formulx whereby we seek to;predict and to control the order and behaviour of the sensible world. We detect in ourselves a whole multiplicity of urges prompting us to " break through " the sensible, to treat it as a kind of veil or as a set of signposts pointing to the " real " material reality behind it. It may be that the not inconsiderable intel- lectual cramps imposed upon us by the effort to interpret the sentences we assert in everyday life phenomenalistically inhibits us from identifying the material with the sensible world. But, whatever the source of our confusion, its issue for the phenomenalist is always the same-the sup- position of the relative irreality of the sensible world and</page><page sequence="6">6 D. M. MACKINNON. the affirmation that the material world which it manifests to us and on which its stands in some relation of causal or quasi-causal dependence is alone properly to be called real. Of course one may deprecate the implied suggestion that the relation between the material world that is in some sense over and above the sensible world and that sensible world must always be represented in causal or quasi-causal terms. The phenomenalist will, however, have some justification for pointing out that the very notion of dependence itself entails that of causality and that however much one may seek to disguise the true character of the relation from oneself it is ultimately of a causal relation that one is speaking. One is faced with the alterna- tive of supposing that the sensible world in some sense " stands on its own feet," or of supposing that it is in some sense "supported " by something other than itself. For the thoroughgoing phenomenalist to affirm that there are sights, resistances, tastes, smells and sounds, and material things is to be guilty of a redundancy that may have the most serious consequences. One might define the tech- nique of philosophy -on the phenomenalist view as exhaust- ing itself in the inducement of a recognition of the ultimacy of the sensible, that it is only within the bounds of sensible experience that significant assertion can be made. I am aware that some readers will think that by re- stricting discussion in this part of my paper to the doctrines of phenomenalism I am doing an injustice to those positivists who seek to extend a verifiability criterion to all significant factual assertion. But this restriction is deliberate in so far as it seems to me that the implications of the positivist doctrine are best seen if we confine ourselves to that aspect of it which possesses the greatest plausibility and which is, moreover, the point of departure of their entire method, to which indeed it owes its peculiar form. For the positivist method consists in the elimination of unintelligible super- fluities. Of course to speak of a superfluity as unintelligible is to presuppose a clearly articulate conception of intelli- gibility. But a little reflection on what has preceded will suffice to make clear the kind of conception of intelligibility</page><page sequence="7">WHAT IS A METAPHYSICAL STATEMENT ? 7 in virtue of which the notion of an external world standing in some kind of relation to the sensible world, which depends upon it, has been dismissed as unintelligible. Briefly we may say that it is a notion of intelligibility which sees what is intelligible as capable of confirmation by some specifiable method. That there is or is not a material world on which the sensible world depends is capable of determination by no method whatsoever. Moreover, the supposition that its existence or non-existence is so determinable flatly contradicts much that underlies the actual character of those procedures whereby we determine individual facts or laws within the sensible world. The notion, therefore, of a material world is as it were relegated to the status of a kind of elliptical formulation of the regularity, order, simplicity, etc., of the sensible world, and our assumption that there is such a world to the status of a self-imposed prescription to approach the sensible world in a certain way.* It is, of course, manifestly obvious that, when positivists eliminate the unintelligible, it is because they are con- vinced that it is not merely unintelligible, but also super- fluous. The function in the elaboration of our knowledge of the external world that is performed by the concept of a material world on which our sensible world is dependent can equally well be fulfilled by the prescription that data should be co-ordinated in certain ways. Of course it will be seen that the notion of superfluity is defined by reference to a peculiar conception of the aim and scope of human knowledge, which, though as yet imperfectly specified, nevertheless forms that background of the positivist's argument with which we shall be concerned in the last part of the paper. One would, however, add in conclusion that the method which informs the positivist's elimination of the notion of the material world, is less successful in respect of the notion of the self. Kant, whose doctrines in certain respects resemble those of the positivists was, however, wise enough to see that the notion of a " pure * Cf. Price. Hume's Theory of the External World. (Oxford). Chapter VI.</page><page sequence="8">8 D. M. MACKINNON. Ego " was demanded, if a doctrine of this kind was to be regarded as an exhaustive account of experience. The Kantian " pure Ego " was not of course a substance; it was rather to be conceived as a kind of " egoity principle,"* which is a pervasive character of experience, as we enjoy it. The notion of experience, Kant wisely recognized, de- manded reference to an individual subject of which we could say nothing except in so far as it was involved in the concept of an experience in general. However difficult such a notion, it would seem to me to be necessarily in- volved in the exposition of a phenomenalist doctrine of the character of external reality. Though the notion is in one sense unintelligible (and in so far as Kant refused to allow his categories to apply to it, one may presume that it was admitted by him to be in some sense so) yet one can hardly suppose it to be superfluous in the sense in which a real material world which is the cause of the sensible world must be so regarded. The programme of consistent phenomenalism has in no material respect altered since Kant. The critique of metaphysics implicit in the Analytict as distinct from the Dialectic of the first Critique is surely directed against, by implication if not by intention, just such a doctrine as I have contended that phenomenalists are chiefly concerned to indict. The conformity of the external world to certain necessary structural principles is not to be regarded as a basis for speculation in the way in which it undoubtedly was so regarded by certain of the greatest scientists of the post-Renaissance period.+ In so far as the principles possess objective import, that import is exhaustively cha- racterizable in terms of sensible patterns or schemata (to use Kant's term). The exemplification of such patterns is perhaps a necessary condition of such experience as we * I owe this useful phrase to Mr. Gilbert Ryle. t In this section of the paper I am greatly indebted to Mr. W. H. Walsh's valuable article on Kant's Criticism of Metaphysics in Philosophy forJuly and October, 1939. It should be added, however, that I do not claim Mr. Walsh's authority for the deductions I have drawn from his contentions. I On this point compare the valuable material collected in Professor E. A. Burtts' Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science (Kegan Paul).</page><page sequence="9">WHAT IS A METAPHYSICAL STATEMENT? 9 enjoy. Kant may be right in attributing to the concepts of the co-ordinating processes the exemplification of such order makes possible the peculiar character of transcendental a priority. * But whether or no they possess this character, for the phenomenalist they possess no ontological import whatsoever. It was the aim of the Kantian Critique to exhibit the limits within which alone the notion of objec- tive necessity was intelligible. As employed without the limits of a possible experience the notion was empty of significant content. t What I want to suggest is that phenomenalism properly regarded constitutes a definite philosophical programme which seeks deliberately to defend the thesis that what is objective in experience is sensible. The metaphysical is frankly identified with the supersensible. Fundamentally knowledge consists in the description of the sensible and the stability and order which make such description possible exhausts the content of what we mean by the physical world.+ We will now leave the discussion of the phenomenalist critique of metaphysical assertion? to return to it at the * ln a letter read during the Joint Session at St. Andrews in 1936 Professor C. D. Broad pointed out that the kind of a priority claimed by Kant for his synthetic a priori principles was hypothetical only. Their universality and necessity was as it were conditional on their character as the condition with- out which peisons who got all their sensible and introspective data piecemeal would cease to regard themselves as individual subjects in a world of bodies interacting with one another in accordance with fixed laws in such a manner as to form a single spatio-temporal and causal system. t Kant's doctrine seems to me substantially similar in this respect to that developed by Professor Moritz Schlick in lectures delivered at London Uni- versity in 1934 and published in his Gesammelte Aufsdtze (Wien, 1937) under the title-" Form and Content." + This is explicitly admitted by Mr. A. J. Ayer n the conclusion of his Foundations of Empirical Knowledge (Macmillan, 1940)-" The most that we can do is to elaborate a technique for predicting the course of our sensory experience, and to adhere to it so long as it is found to be reliable. And this is all that is essentially involved in our belief in the reality of the physical world." ? I would apologize for the frequent use of " -ism words " in this paper. I agree with Mr. Ryle's polemic against their use in Philosophy for July, 1937 (Art.-" On Taking Sides in Philosophy "). But I would plead that in a paper of this character which is partly expository their employment is in a measure pardonable.</page><page sequence="10">10 D. M. MACKINNON. conclusion of this section. The doctrines which I now wish to consider are much more subtle and difficult of exposition in so far as the background which furnishes the context of their employment is much less clearly defined than that of the phenomenalist. In fact one is sometimes tempted to believe that their exponents aim deliberately at " stand- pointlessness." Now though I believe this goal to be in point of fact unattainable, its pursuit has been the occasion of some extraordinarily illuminating observation on the character of the metaphysical thinking.* When it is said (in the language of Wittgenstein) that the business of philosophy is to make propositions clear, and that therefore the utterances of philosophers do not constitute propositions at all, room is left for an emphasis on the importance of the context of philosophic assertion that is altogether refreshing. We do not, I think, realize fully what is involved in the denial that there is such a thing as " a philosophy." It is a suggestion frankly more revolutionary in its import than phenomenalism; for there is a sense in which phenomenalism does constitute a philo- sophy. Though phenomenalists do make play with the view that philosophy is to be regarded as an activity and not as a body of doctrine, they seem in practice to base their actual philosophic activity on a very clearly defined and rigidly held doctrine. When, however, it is argued that philosophy is to be regarded exhaustively as an activity of clarification then to understand the utterances of a philo- sopher one must be quite clear concerning the perplexities which he is desirous of elucidating. If one fails to remember what these perplexities are, immediately one's constructive zeal gets the better of one and one substitutes for analysis the construction of a philo- sophy. I want to illustrate this by some remarks on what I will call the generation of the metaphysical theory of " facts." Every first-year student of philosophy knows * I am much indebted to Mr. Wisdom's paper-" Philosophical Per- plexity " (Proc. Ar. Soc., 1936-7). But I would not claim altogether to have understood him.</page><page sequence="11">WHAT IS A METAPHYSICAL STATEMENT? 11 that it was Hume's achievement to show that whereas one proposition can imply another proposition one fact cannot imply another fact.* Now I think it might be suggested that when we first hear this said we are in the mood to welcome it with that " Of course" with which Mr. Ryle has said we always greet a considerable philosophical discovery. We do this without question because in our study of Hume we have familiarized ourselves with the kind of difficulties he is endeavouring to explore. Put it crudely-we know what he is talking about. So far so good, but then there comes a moment when we ask our- selves what it is that he is talking about. We prize the elucidatory remark from its context and seek to deduce from it propositions concerning the nature of the world. Now it may be argued that it is impossible to refrain from doing this, that we cannot regard philosophical discoveries as partaking of this character of quasi-mystical insights. But the consequences of our failure- so to regard them are, as we shall see, fraught with paradox. When we ask the question " What is a fact ? " we are often quite innocent of metaphysical intent. Hume has enlightened us in respect of what one might call the loose- ness or atomicity of the items of which our world is composed. He has shown us that the kind of relation obtaining between them is quite different from that obtaining between the premises and conclusion of a syllogism in Barbara. We are naturally curious concerning the character of these items of which the world is composed and soon we find ourselves *supposing that we can answer the frankly metaphysical question " What are the ultimate constituents of the world ? " by prolonging Hume's procedure ad indefinitum. Hume's procedure is, of course, a reduction of the complex to the simple. If I may speak in a highly metaphorical manner, he shows us that there are gaps where we thought there was what Mr. Ayer has called a " glue-and-grappling " * This description of one important aspect of Hume's work is borrowed from R. E. Hobart's articles " Hume without Scepticism " in Mind, 1930.</page><page sequence="12">12 D. M. MACKINNON. relation.* We are naturally tempted to suppose that this reduction of the complex to a simple is the key " which will unlock the whole mystery of reality." Our enthusiasm is enhanced when we remember other cases in which the reduction of the complex to the simple has been a means of escape from grievous perplexity or of altogether satis- fying philosophic insight. For instance, even the most dispassionate philosophers have been known to welcome with quite unphilosophic joy the recognition that the state is a logical construction out of its members, thereby finding a means of exactly exhibiting the errors of Hegelian philo- sophers. Again, the recognition of the comparative sim- plicity in that to which the sentences in question refer, has been of inestimable value in elucidating the puzzles gene- rated by the symbolism of generality. But that certain cardinal philosophic insights depend upon the recognition that the complex may sometimes be analysable as a function of the simple should not lead us to suppose that the whole task of philosophy consists in the reduction of the complex to the simple, or that reality is composed of an aggregate of simple facts in external relation one to another. Russell, in his rather unsatis- factory introduction to Wittgenstein's Tractatus,t points out quite unequivocally that such a conception of the simple transcends the limits of experience " It is not contended by Wittgenstein," says Russell, " that we can actually isolate the simple or have empirical knowledge of it. It is a logical necessity demanded by theory, like an electron. His ground for maintaining that there must be simples is that every complex presupposes a fact. It is not necessarily assumed that the complexity of facts is finite ; even if every fact consisted of an infinite number of objects there would still be objects and atomic facts (4*2211). The assertion that there is a certain complex reduces to the * It is, of course, true to say that Hume is a phenomenalist, but I have thought it legitimate for the purpose of my argument to isolate his most important discovery in the philosophy of logic. t Op. cit., p. 12.</page><page sequence="13">WHAT IS A METAPHYSICAL STATEMENT? 13 assertion that its constituents are related in a certain way, which is the assertion of afact: thus if we give a name to the complex the name only has meaning in virtue of the truth of a certain proposition, namely the proposition asserting the relatedness of the constituents of the complex. Thus the naming of complexes presupposes propositions, while propositions presuppose the naming of simples. In this way the naming of simples is shown to be what is logically first in logic." In detail this statement is profoundly unsatisfactory but at least it points to the character of logical atomism as metaphysical in the sense of transcending the limits of experience. What we have added to this characterization is the recognition that its source resides in the misinter- pretation and generalization of certain remarks elucidating the import of various types of more or less elliptical asser- tions. These remarks do in certain respects resemble typical factual assertions; for instance, " the world is composed of atomic facts" resembles " water is composed of hydrogen and oxygen." But the similarity masks the important dissimilarity, that whereas the latter records a fact established by chemical experiment, the former is unin- telligible apart from the discourse in which it falls. An account of its reference would involve mention of the whole elucidatory activity which furnish the context of its asser- tion. This is only one example of the process which might be described as the generation of metaphysical theory. Of this process phenomenalists give little account, for they are perhaps, as we have seen, more concerned in particularizing the character of that empirical knowledge which meta- physics as an inquiry seeks to outdistance. Phenomenalists have a doctrine. It is clearly defined and it furnishes a standard of the legitimate which must be rigidly adhered to. But the whole background presupposed by the philo- sophers who in the latter stage of this section I have striven to illustrate is much vaguer. Their distaste for dogma would put the phenomenalist to shame, their standard is furnished one might almost say by a kind of vague intellectual</page><page sequence="14">14 D. M. MACKINNON. contentment, coupled with a profound and healthy respect for the particularity of the individual, which continually militates against that besetting philosophical sin of reducing types of entity to terms of one another. In conclusion, therefore, of this section of my paper I would like to point to two slightly divergent senses in which the term metaphysics is used in contemporary philo- sophy. (1) The term is used to refer to factual assertions which suggest the reality (and perhaps the greater dignity) of entities which lie beyond the limits of sensible experience and are regarded as in some sense conditioning the cha- racter of that experience. (2) It is also used to refer to certain types of speculation to which philosophers, including some who would be called empiricists, are prone, when they misconceive the character of those discoveries which they have in point of fact made and neglect Butler's warning to remember " that every- thing is what it is and not another thing." Of the precise relation between these two judgments on the content of metaphysical thinking we will return in the third and concluding section of this paper. But first we must offer some account of the classical conceptions of metaphysical thought. IL. One has become so familiar, with the slogan " Meta- physics is impossible " that any attempt to offer a positive exposition of metaphysical thinking might be thought to be self-stultifying. Clearly on either of the two views which we have been considering metaphysical assertions will inevitably be regarded as in some sense nonsensical, though this dismissal may be qualified in the case of the latter by the affirmation that the nonsense they express is important. The philosopher, therefore, who would attempt to make sense of the ancient debates between monism and pluralism, between idealism and realism, and the like labours under</page><page sequence="15">WHAT IS A METAPHYSICAL STATEMENT? 15 a grave disadvantage. None the less it seems to me in- creasingly plausible that the debates of traditional meta- physicians do concern genuine questions. One would not claim this for all their debates, but at least in respect of some of the assertions made by metaphysicians one would make bold to claim the character of falsehood as distinct from that of nonsensicality. May I illustrate ? Certain idealists have claimed that time is unreal. Now if this proposition be true, it pre- sumably entails, if it is not logically equivalent to, the proposition-There are no temporal facts. If this latter proposition is true, then it is clearly not the case that any one entity is posterior or anterior to any other. In other words, when one says that the death of Queen Anne was anterior to the great Reform Bill, one is saying nothing at all. For whatever one may mean by the death of the Queen, or by the Reform Bill, it is clearly not anything that possesses any temporal characteristics whatsoever. It is tempting at this point to call a halt with " Nonsense " ! But what exactly does one mean by nonsense in this context ? Does one mean that in some sense it is necessary that entities should possess temporal characteristics ? If one does, then one is either saying that it is self-contradictory for entities to possess no temporal characteristics, which is somewhat bold or that there is some kind of synthetic necessity in virtue of which all entities are so characterized. This latter in some respects recalls Kant's doctrine in that part of the Aesthetic which deals with time, but it is surely open to serious difficulties. One can only say, in fact, that the proposition-Time is unreal-is nonsense (except in the sense in which simple-minded persons might be tempted to dismiss as nonsense many of the more pontifical utter- ances of absolute idealists) if one is prepared to take the highly bold step of affirming that one knows a priori that facts must be temporal; otherwise one must be content with some kind of empirical refutation of the idealist pretension to deny the reality of time. Of course Kant, with sure insight, saw that temporal successiveness was so pervasive a character of the world of our experience, that it was</page><page sequence="16">16 D. M. MACKINNON. almost (for him entirely) impossible to think of a non- temporary ordered world. But from pervasiveness to a priori!y (in any save perhaps a Kantian sense) there is no direct way, and I would therefore suggest to you that the debate with idealists concerning the reality or irreality of time is a debate which in point of fact can be settled by appeal to facts. Of course, as we all know, idealists disallow this appeal on the ground that the notion of a fact is in their sense nonsensical. Of this appeal more will be said later; at the moment one should be content with saying that it is this kind of refusal to admit the reality of the factual which more than anything else has cast dis- credit upon metaphysical speculation. It is true to say as a matter of empirical fact that one's conception of the metaphysician is to some extent supplied by one's knowledge of the work of monistic idealists. Now monistic idealists in their philosophizing suffer from two preconceptions: (1) they suppose that the goal of speculative thought is the achievement of complete theoretical satisfaction (2) they affirm that such theoretical satisfaction is in point of fact obtainable. At the outset of any speculative thinking reason makes an " act of faith in itself" but what it seeks it will obtain. For the universe is such as will in the last resort reveal itself to be the fulfilment of the aspira- tions of the rational understanding.* Now neither of, these propositions seem to me to be plausible, let alone true. But when I ask whether the grounds on which I would thus be inclined to dismiss them would satisfy one who believed them to be true I am honestly very doubtful. In illustration one might refer to the refusal of various eminent idealists to allow the validity of Professor G. E. Moore's criticism of the thesis of the * Certain idealists (e.g., Mr. E. E. Harris in Mind for October, 1936, art. -" Mr. Ryle and the Ontological Argument ") have identified this act of faith with the acceptance of the ontological proof. This seems rather unfair on St. Anselm and Descartes.</page><page sequence="17">WHAT IS A METAPHYSICAL STATEMENT ? 17 internality of relations to their terms. * The fact that metaphysical debates seem incapable of settlement in this way, and that apparently there is no court of appeal to which metaphysicians of different schools are prepared to go for a final verdict on the pretensions of their systems has further discredited their achievement. What seems self-evident to the idealist possesses no claim for credence on the part of the pluralist, and it is therefore tempting for those who would rid philosophy of the necessity for striving to answer unanswerable questions to dismiss the whole debate as fantastical. But surely enough has been said to make it plain that there is a sense in which the pluralist is prepared to admit an appeal to fact, and that therefore those who would dismiss metaphysics on the ground of the futility and empti- ness of its debates must be prepared to discriminate between individual schools of metaphysicians. As I understand it the aim of a pluralistic metaphysics differs so radically from that of a monistic that it might almost be accounted misleading to refer to both undertakings by the same name. The suggestion that the metaphysician is concerned in some sense to determine a priori the nature of the real is plausible only so long as one entertains a monistic conception of his undertaking. One may allow with Bradley that the theoretical understanding will only be satisfied with a com- pletely comprehensive system of internally related parts such that parts determine whole and whole parts. But to take the wholly inadmissible step of supposing that the world must be such as to satisfy this theoretical demand of the understanding remains in spite of all the elaborate arguments offered to justify it a piece of unwarranted intel- lectual impertinence. From this kind of insolence the pluralist is refreshingly free. He is prepared to be content with a catalogue of mutually irreducible types of fact. Between these types of fact there may or may not be ana- logies. But it is surely significant that because the pluralist * Cf. Professor C. A. Campbell's Scepticism and Construction, pp. 23 ff.

MACKINNON. is thus prepared to be content with individual atomic certainties there are those who would deny him the title of metaphysician at all. Yet I would contend that in certain very important senses he is a metaphysician. Thus he is prepared to treat as of equal importance the fact that human behaviour is subject to empirically established psychological law, and the fact that if we are to trust " the immediate affirmation of consciousness in the moment of deliberate action "* we are morally free. He recognizes that in point of fact if one attempts to include within one's view the tension that manifestly exists between man as investigator and man as active moral agent one must be prepared to affirm in some sense quite impossible to an idealist the reality of the individual. t It is only when one ignores the problems generated by this apparent opposition and demands their resolution in some higher synthesis that one endeavours to prescribe a priori its character to reality. The pluralist is a metaphysician precisely in so far as the same grounds, which make him impatient of the pretensions of the idealists, contribute to compel him to reject phenomenalism. His defence of the individual in the sphere of being furnishes an interesting analogue to the defence of the individual in the sphere of discourse under- taken by the second type of analyst mentioned in the first part of this paper. Now all this may seem exceedingly vague and unsatis- factory regarded as a piece of philosophical exposition. But I would plead that we are not going to begin to under- stand the classical metaphysicians unless we are clear as to a fundamental cleavage that is discernible among them. Very tentatively I would suggest that this line of cleavage falls between those who are content with admitting that in the last resort the mind must conform with the nature of what is and those who contend that the nature of the under- standing can determine a priori the nature of what is. It was with quite deliberate intent that in the earlier part of * Sidgwick, Methods of Ethics (6th ed.), p. 65. t Cf. the criticisms of Bradley's metaphysics by the late ProfessorJames Ward.</page><page sequence="19">WHAT IS A METAPHYSICAL STATEMENT? 19 this exposition I confused, by using them interchangeably, the terms monist and idealist. For although some idealists (e.g., Berkeley)* have admitted real plurality, yet the out- come of that idealism which would make of thought's immanent laws the basis of our surest insight into the character of reality as a whole is inevitably monistic. For thought qua thought inevitably seeks unity. Whereas the pluralist equally tends to be a realist in so far as for him truth is attained not by thought's fulfilment of its own law, but by rigid refusal to find in reality what is not there. The debates of metaphysicians are, we may admit, often singularly fatuous. But we ought, I am sure, to allow that metaphysicians give an account of what they claim to be doing. Accordingly let us ask the two types we have dis- criminated for the answer that they would give to the question which forms the title of this paper. (1) For the idealist the question is a nonsense question That may sound paradoxical but from what has been said it will be clear that for him individual metaphysical asser- tions are simply moments in that prolonged process of intellectual activity whereby the sole ultimate reality constitutes itself by revealing itself within the life of finite centres of intellectual experience. (2) The pluralist would affirm that a metaphysical statement was in the first instance one which called atten- tion to the irreducibility of different types of fact. Its metaphysical character is determined by the ultimacy of the distinction to which it would call attention. More- over, I would suggest that it is only within the context of such a scheme that one can hope to distinguish adequately between metaphysical and non-metaphysical assertions. For the idealist every assertion partakes at once of a meta- * Berkeley's idealism is, of course, fundamentally theistic. Indeed it is arguable that there is nothing incompatible with a common sense realism in his developed position. The problem of the relation of the finite with the infinite spirit remains one of the unsolved problems of his philosophy.</page><page sequence="20">20 D. M. MACKINNON. physical and a non-metaphysical character. For the pluralist only those assertions which are concerned to call attention to ultimate and irreducible types of fact are properly denominated metaphysical. For the pluralist philosophical reflection does not constitute a moment in the constitution of what is reflected upon. It is not, as certain idealists have supposed, the moment in which an omnipresent intellectual activity achieves self-consciousness. It is rather that moment when however inchoately we endeavour to form our concept of substance or the self-subsistent. Fundamentally as Ward saw the problem of the self constitutes the crux of philosophical reflection. It is through the perplexity which the peculiar character of the self-conscious active individual thrusts upon us that we are first (if we ever have been tempted in this way) inspired with mistrust of that Whole of which on a monistic view we are moments. We realize that however much our theo- retical understanding may covet the satisfaction of an all- inclusive self-explanatory system, such satisfaction can only be achieved, if that discontinuity, necessitated by the recog- nition of the character of the self as agent, is ignored. To put it bluntly we cannot have it both ways-Either we must ignore what seems to us in our reflection upon our selves most eminently true or else we must forfeit the pattern of completely satisfying theoretical achievement that the idealists propose to us. When I say that the problem of the self is the crux of metaphysical reflection, what I am seeking to convey is that reflection upon the awkwardness occasioned by the evident existence of selves for any doctrine, which would seek to disallow the reality of discontinuity in the world, is often the antecedent of a drastic revision of the docirine in question. When I said above that in metaphysical thinking on the pluralist view, one was engaged in the attempt to form a concept of the self-subsistent, it was to the fruit of reflection on the problem of the self that I was thinking. It is surely arguable that our concept of sub- stance, which we so tend to apply to the objects of which</page><page sequence="21">WHAT IS A METAPHYSICAL STATEMENT? 21 the external world is composed,* is primarily formed as the result of reflection on that degree of self-subsistence which we find in ourselves. Certainly we must allow, with Berkely, that such anthropomorphism is hazardous, and that our selfhood is but an inexact analogue of that mode of self-subsistence enjoyed by material things. But I do not think that philosophers can ignore as readily as some tend to do our aptitude for applying analogically concepts formed in the first instance by reflection on our selves to other entities which manifest in some degree that character of self-subsistence which is the most manifest aspect of our selfhood. Metaphysical thinking is always analogical thinking, except for the idealist metaphysician for whom one might say its character resides in the unfettered pursuit and willing acceptance of the goal which thought qua-thought proposes to itself. It consists in the clarification by means of ana- logies borrowed from reflection upon that type of self- subsistent whose mode of being is most evident to us, of the nature of those various types of entity to which we find ourselves constrained to attribute an analogous self-sub- sistence. What I have outlined is, of course, a programme rather than a positive achievement. But I would suggest to you that the point of departure of metaphysical thinking is and must be the apprehension of the self-subsistent. It seems to me arguable that in reflection upon that highly complex unity which we name the self we do achieve such a concept. We may argue, of course, that we must stop there. As we all know, some Berkeleians try to do so and then find them- selves impelled to introduce the notion of an infinite spiritual substance to give at least a quaxsi-substantial character to the entities of which the physical world is composed. What * Berkeley, of course, while admitting in some sense analogous to my own the reality of an indefinite plurality of selves, denied that the extension of the concept so formed to the material world was in any sense valid (cf. the unequivocal statement of Princ, 142). One might do worse than reflect on the consideration which drove Berkeley to so radical a dichotomy of the notional and the ideal.</page><page sequence="22">22 D. M. MACKINNON. I would like to suggest to you in conclusion of this section is that our unwillingness to employ the concept of substance in the sense of self-subsistence to the individual self is due to our failure to remember the dual nature of that self as including both understanding and will. It seems at least worth asking ourselves whether this failure has not like- wise infected our approach to that most fundamental and perplexing of philosophical problems-the nature of mate- rial things.* III. We now return to contrast the conception of the meta- physical statement we have outlined with the use of the term metaphysical in the writings of those philosophers we discussed in the first section of the paper. From what has been said of idealist metaphysical views it will be obvious that we need spend little time contrasting their view of metaphysical statement with those of the former types of philosophy. It is with the latter conception which we call pluralist that we will be concerned, for it is in the contrast that its method affords with the nature of that which is nowadays called metaphysical that we shall be primarily concerned. You will perhaps remember how often I used the term " programme " with reference to the undertakings of phenomenalists. I did so with malice aforethought, for it seems at least arguable that, as is the case with the theoretical philosophy of Kant, so with modern positivism. We are concerned with what might be irreverently called a philosophy of the " charmed circle." By this I mean that a certain determinate type of inquiry is selected and made as it were determinative of those a priori or quasi- a priori assumptions that may legitimately be made. One might say that the whole end and method of descriptive * I owe a great deal in this section to what I have learnt from discussion with the Rev. A. M. Farrer, but he must not be supposed to agree with what I have said.</page><page sequence="23">WHAT IS A METAPHYSICAL STATEMENT? 23 science is regarded by positivists as a kind of absolute. Within the framework of this activity one can make those assumptions that are necessary as preconditions of its possibility. * One can assume, for instance, that the physical world is causally ordered, but one must not suppose that that assumption fulfils any other function than making possible the more effective co-ordination of sensible data in accordance with the general programme of descriptive science. Metaphysical error, for the phenomenalist, consisted as we saw primarily in the bestowal of some kind of onto- logical status on the presupposition required for the pursuit of this kind of inquiry.t But it was argued implicity if not explicitly that any attempt to " get outside " the process was doomed from the outset to failure. It was to this that I was referring when I denominated the process and absolute. Now not the least claim of Kant to philosophical greatness is to be found in the fact that he recognized the essentially abstract character of this procedure. The mani- fest resemblance between Kant and contemporary positiv- ists stops with the conclusion of the first Critique. Though the precise relation between man as object of scientific investigation and man as moral agent remains a mystery to all save a privileged few, we ought to realize the depth of insight which compelled Kant, even at the cost of intelli- gibility, to leave room for the latter in his system. He refused to allow even so manifestly successful an under- taking as empirical science to exhaust the content of reality. Now though a phenomenalist interpretation of science may be possible (and, of course, graver difficulties must be anticipated in respect to its achievement in biology and psychology than in physics) one ought, I am certain, to ask oneself whether in point of fact we are right to treat science so interpreted as an absolute. We are too ready to believe that the whole business of philosophy is exhausted * On this cf. Professor H. Feigl in Philosophy of Science, Vol. I, No. 1, art.- " The Logical Problem of Induction." t Cf. the programme of analysis prescribed and carried out on basic scientific concepts by Professor P. W. Bridgman in his Logic of Modern Physics.</page><page sequence="24">24 D. M. MACKINNON. in the keeping of science loyal to its phenomenalist assump- tions. We refuse to allow that it is even a theoretical possibility that our procedure is abstract, until the kind of method of metaphysical reflection that I have outlined thrusts itself upon us in that moment, when we are com- pelled to ask ourselves questions concerning the character of the self that inquires. The range of problems that we are then prepared to admit as philosophical suddenly expands, for we have broken out of the " charmed circle." To revert to our earlier metaphor the background has shifted. We no longer use the term metaphysical in a pejorative sense of that which violates the programme of physics, we use it rather of that attempt to present some kind of schema of that greater whole of which the inquiry called physical science is a part. Consider for a moment how the content of such concepts as substance and causality is transmogrified. Within the scheme of phenomenalist physics they are only intelligible when analysed as concepts of processes of co-ordination. Their content is prescribed by their use. But once one has asked the crucial question concerning the nature of the inquirer with the presupposition of whose inquiry one has hitherto been concerned one is compelled to use the term substance to refer to the objectively self-subsistent. There is, of course, a directly corresponding transmogrification in the content of the causal concept. (The close connexion of these two notions has always been recognized by philo- sophers.) When one comes to consider the relation of the use of the term metaphysical by the second group of philosophers with which we were first concerned our problem is rather more difficult. It will be remembered that by them the term metaphysics was used primarily of a tendency on the part of the philosophers to misconceive the character of their discoveries. The contrast between the tendency of phe- nomenalists by their inadequate concept of human know- ledge to misconceive the character of metaphysics is intelli- gible precisely in so far as that inadequate concept is deter- minate. But when one is concerned with the conception</page><page sequence="25">WHAT IS A METAPHYSICAL STATEMENT ? 25 of analysis that refuses to make its concept of human know- ledge determinate (for excellent reasons, be it said) one's problem is much harder. What is manifestly clear is that the pluralist metaphysician cannot be content with a final " Standpointlessness." Such an attitude is an -in- valuable corrective against the pernicious tendency to restrict knowledge to some one pattern. The protest against the assumption that ostensive definition is uni- versally possible is most salutary. But when this protest is erected into a principle and the actual rules of discourse regarded as in some sense beyond criticism (what if a world peopled exclusively by Nazis, Stalinists and madmen ?), one is bound to ask whether one has achieved a position that can be regarded as ultimately tenable. That philo- sophers irresistibly tend to generalize their discoveries in manners that are illegitimate is undeniable and important. But the suggestion that the fatal consequence of such an illegitimate extension is to be found more in the violation of linguistic usage than in positive falsehood it seems very hard to believe. One cannot seriously allow one's back- ground to be supplied by the conventions of discourse. What one can allow is the immense importance that philo- sophers must attach to their context in inquiry in deter- mining the sense of those sentences in which they formulate their discoveries. There is an abstraction which is funda- mentally vicious and this abstraction is often generated by a failure to attend to the precise significance of the words one is using. To bring this already over-long yet highly incomplete and inadequate paper to a conclusion I would suggest the following four points for consideration: (1) Is the employment of metaphysics in a pejorative sense altogether detachable from certain by no means self- eminent conceptions of the scope and limitations of philo- sophy ? (2) Does not an honest reflection on the concept of selfhood suggest as possible the elaboration of what for want of a better term I would call a pluralist metaphysic of the self-subsistent ?</page><page sequence="26">26 D. M. MACKINNON. (3) Is it not arguable that within the context of such a scheme room may be found for the valuable insistence of the positivist that science must remain in its assumptions and procedures strictly empirical, and for the recognition of other philosophers that the more exciting forms of speculation are often due to a wholly vicious ignoring of the precise significance of the terms we are using ? (4) One must not suppose that the positive conclusions of such a process of metaphysical thinking as I have out- lined would be either satisfying or exciting. But if we adhere to such a programme, we will at least escape from that most subtle snare in which philosophers are so often entrapped, of ignoring the evident in the interests of a theory.</page></plain_text>
