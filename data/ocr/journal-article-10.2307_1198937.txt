<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOME METAPHYSICAL GLEANINGS FROM PRAYER JULIAN N. HARTT* T Ir.E principal question asked in this paper is: What can be inferred from prayer as cognitional rapport with God, concerning the nature of God and of the world? It seems to me that to get at this question properly it is neces- sary to consider first whether prayer is cognitive rapport at all. Otherwise an answer to the main question will neces- sarily be hypothetical: if prayer is such rapport, then certain things follow. In the first part of the paper, accordingly, I am concerned to show that a denial of unique cognitive content-a denial in the Christian context, that is-is unin- telligible, quite in addition to the havoc wreaked among the concrete testimonies of piety and devotion. I say "quite in addition to" such damage, but perhaps I should have said "quite apart from," because the aim of these notes is really very limited and does not embrace the task of certifying or of disqualifying such testimony. To the man of deep piety such certification of his witness as meta- physics may yield must frequently seem dispensable; and, so far as the metaphy- sician is concerned, the testimony of piety can hardly seem decisive in itself for the resolution of the deepest problems * Mr. Julian Hartt has been a member of the fac- ulty of the Divinity School at Yale University since 1943. Prior to assuming this present post, he taught in the department of philosophy and religion in Berea College, Berea, Kentucky. He is a graduate of Garrett Biblical Institute (B.D.), Northwestern Uni- versity (M.A.), and Yale University, having re- ceived the degree of Doctor of Philosophy from the latter institution in I940. His article entitled "Hu- man Freedom and Divine Transcendence" appeared in this Journal in January, 1951. of his science. But even where meta- physical corroboration seems unneces- sary, on the one hand, and where, on the other hand, the corroboration of piety seems hardly decisive, the hope of mu- tual fertilization of the one by the other does not seem to me forlorn. So far as this paper is concerned, the metaphysi- cian will not presume to tell the man at his prayers what he has or has not expe- rienced and known therein or thereby. He will say, rather: "Be it thus and so, as you declare it, what may we conclude further concerning God and his world?" It is assumed throughout this particu- lar venture that prayer is rapport, what- ever more it may also be.' This assump- tion does not seem to me to be an un- reasonable one, and its truth is suggested by the concrete life of prayer. It is a kind of minimal translation of the testimony of devotion. And whatever more may be asserted or claimed for prayer, less is not claimed for it in a specifically Christian context. He who prays is aware of a di- rect relationship with God; or, perhaps in fuller justice to the claim, he judges that he has to do with God directly.2 This judgment may of course be mis- taken, and the "awareness" may turn out to be nothing but "heightened affec- tivity"; but this sense of direct relation- ship, of immediacy of confrontation, is what is intended by the term "rapport." The sense of directness of relationship supposes or presupposes the reality of the Other. Therefore, whether or not prayer itself has unique cognitive quality and content, its significant and productive 254</page><page sequence="2">SOME METAPHYSICAL GLEANINGS FROM PRAYER pursuit requires a "funded" knowledge of God.3 "Whosoever would find God must first believe that He is," is an older and better way of making the same point. The truth of this can be seen easily in the case of petitionary prayer. One does not ask God for what God cannot give or do. What those things are that God cannot give or do may be debatable, but every Christian community supposes that prayer for cer- tain things is either futile or sinful or both. The properly informed believer governs himself accordingly. He believes that "with God all things are possible"- except the intrinsically impossible. This is, again, but to say that he brings to the act and life of prayer certain prejudg- ments about God and about God's will. A striking and formidable exception to this conclusion looms in the prayer of the Anguished Agnostic: "0 God, if you really exist, reveal thyself to me!" In fact, this seems to be an exception to the assumption that prayer is rapport with God because the desideratum of this pe- tition is presumed to be the presupposi- tion of all significant prayer! There is enough in this to give us pause, because the prayer for divine illumination is cer- tainly close to the very heart of the whole enterprise of prayer, and the resolution of the foregoing exceptions should not obscure that fact. Granted this, however, that resolution seems plain: the prayer is nothing but release or expression of feel- ing and desire unless the "0 God" be seri- ously intended; and it cannot be serious- ly intended save on the presumption that God exists. This presumptive knowledge of God may indeed be meager, else the Anguished Agnostic would have surren- dered his creed before ever he prayed, but it must be real. Again, the foundation of rapport is there, so far as the prayer is seriously and transcendentally intended, however keen the hunger for a "closer walk with God," for the petitioner either supposes that he is in the line of direct dealings with God or his intention is really that of self- expression. We seem already to be herded by the force of these initial observations to an early conclusion that prayer has no unique cognitive content, but to embrace that conclusion at this point would be premature. There can be little doubt that the life of prayer draws heavily upon a funded knowledge of God; but it does not follow from the fact that a person takes much to prayer that he brings nothing away from it but what he took to it. Whether or not he does bring away something new is a question to which we must return, but first it is important to note what the claim of unique cognitive content is. In brief, it is the claim that prayer is, or may be, a "revelatory me- dium." ("May be" has some importance because what we are saying here could hardly be expected to apply without qualification to every alleged instance of prayer.) How is this claim to be supported? It may be argued that without such Self- disclosure directly to the individual, God would not be known as fully and truly personal. If, that is, all knowledge of him were mediated through the created order or through an authoritative church, the individual might suppose that God was personal (in some significant sense of that maltreated term), but he would not know him as personal. He might feel justified in looking upon this or that aspect of the world or of human history as an expres- sion of a personal God, but he would not, from the scrutiny of such effects, be able to say that he had directly encountered the Divine Person. Accordingly, if all knowledge of the Divine Person were 255</page><page sequence="3">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION mediate, roundabout, so to speak, would this not dilute the prime conviction that God is in fact personal? A personal God must surely deal personally with other persons, no matter how inferior the grades of "personhood" may be among the creatures. Deus absconditus may be granted where absconditus "conceals" a nonpersonal world ground, an ineffable Absolute or One; but it cannot be granted where Deus is truly personal. It cannot be granted, for no adequate reason can be specified for his opacity. To this it may be rejoined that for God to deal with persons personally it is enough for him to respect persons and to provide a cosmic environment hospitable to their develop- ment and fulfilment. But this remote ad- mirer of and provider for persons cannot be conceived of as personal so long as he abstains from direct dealings with them. Or, again, it may be contended that the plain matter of fact is that God has re- vealed himself as Deus absconditus, and that is that. But this is very far from being a plain matter of fact-all that is plain matter of fact here is that someone has alleged that this has happened--and, moreover, God who so "reveals" himself has at least for that purpose dealt di- rectly with some persons, though not with all. The argument may be restated in terms of the relation of the will of the Infinite to the will of the finite. To know only that the will of the Infinite is the ultimate cause of all things and all events is so far to know God only as world ground, as a metaphysical principle. If God is will or concrete creative agency how should he fail to register himself as such directly upon finite wills? Why should not his willing, his actual deter- mining of certain things be directly ap- prehended? It is claimed that prayer is just this apprehension of God-willing, standing over against the will of the finite.4 Rightly or wrongly many persons believe fervently that through prayer their wills have been guided to decisions pleasing to God and that they have be- held God directly at work in this. These decisions are not just known to follow (e.g., as an inference) from God's will; in prayer they have apprehended divine agency doing thus and so. Again, this is not simply a matter of an ethical prin- ciple suddenly becoming luminous and fertile; it is a matter of having communed with the Lord and of having "heard" from him what he would have us do. One of the weightier counters to these claims is that the cognitive character and transmissible impact of such allegedly di- rect encounters do not seem on the whole to bear out the claims. Very little seems to be added to the funded knowledge of God against which the pray-er has drawn for the initial plausibility of the whole enterprise of prayer. The person who prays seems to find God pretty much as he was led by the community to expect and rarely, if ever, imports novelty drawn from prayer into the conception of God. The community may be astonished by some of the projects that God has ap- parently authorized, but on the whole they are projects within his sovereignty and, for aught the community knows, within his design. This counterclaim is not quite so dev- astating as it is reputed to be. It might be that the funded and communally ap- proved knowledge of God was simply an outline of knowledge, an abstract con- ceptual framework, true so far as it went but in the nature of the case stopping far short of life-giving adequacy. I say "in the nature of the case" on the presump- tion that "life-giving adequacy" could not be deposited in a conceptual frame- work, although it might be ordered for 256</page><page sequence="4">SOME METAPHYSICAL GLEANINGS FROM PRAYER certain limited purposes by such frame- work, e.g., Systematic Theology. Now if this were the case, then "encounter" (ex- istential) knowledge of God would not be false or trivial, because it did not sig- nificantly modify that framework or out- line. It is another question whether that deposit of (abstract) knowledge is itself to be understood wholly as an abstrac- tion from existential encounter. I do not see how an affirmative answer to this question can be made without in the end embracing absurdities of a fairly prickly kind, if it has already been assumed that existential knowledge cannot really be validated except by its interpretation by or translation into a relatively stable conceptual system. On the other hand, if it is asserted that the conceptual frame- work or system of knowledge of God is independent of and not reducible to ex- istential knowledge, then some account of its source and authentication may be demanded, and one may wonder why ex- istential knowledge is denied independ- ence vis-a-vis conceptual knowledge. It would seem that the relationship be- tween the two "modes" of knowing God should be construed dialectically, for thereby the way is left open for what has actually happened, i.e., the modification of the one by the other. A significant gain in knowledge of the widest significance can, I believe, hardly be accounted for otherwise. Speculative novelty can, of course, be injected into a system of knowledge at any point, that is, arbitrary modifications in either the extension or intension of cardinal terms, or the specu- lative reorganization of terms with stable meanings, or both. But this yields no net gain until or unless the world as con- cretely apprehended can be shown to contain that novelty or to be better un- derstood on the supposition of its ac- tuality. I conclude at this point, therefore, that the counterclaim noted above rests upon two inadmissible assumptions: (i) it seems to suppose that the funded knowl- edge of God is what it is independently of the deposits of individuals, (2) it seems to suppose that this "knowledge by de- scription" is intelligible and concretely significant apart from some "knowledge by acquaintance." The question should perhaps be raised whether these claims and counterclaims have equal bearing upon all the varieties of prayer. Abstractly it seems possible that the noetic character might vary from one kind or level of prayer to an- other. Petitionary prayer, for example, in some circumstances seems to exhibit a minimum of cognitive rapport, namely, where so to pray and what to pray for are believed to be the fulfilment of a divine command. Faithfully to discharge this command may entail rapport, but no di- rect apprehension of God's will at work in and through rapport seems to be in- volved. As the Lord's Prayer is habitu- ally used in public and private worship an absolute minimum of noesis and rap- port seems to be involved.5 In the prayer of communion (or of union), on the other hand, the noetic factor seems very large and very strong-the soul is enraptured by awareness of the Infinite as immedi- ately present to it. Even where subse- quent interpretation of this experience insists upon the obliteration of the sub- ject-object duality in it, a most rare and rich experimental knowledge is claimed as a derivative, at least, from the union with God. Yet, when all has been granted that needs to be granted concerning the de- grees and kinds of prayer, we should still have to remark that presence or absence of unique cognitive character and con- tent cannot be determined by reference 257</page><page sequence="5">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION to a typology of prayer. There is no clear indication that God makes himself more or less available as the type of prayer changes. And if all prayer is rapport with God, there is no self-evident reason why any given prayer at any given moment might not be invested with unique cog- nitive content. We ought now to try to state what the "unique cognitive content" or quality is presumed to be. Prayer so described is presumed to convey or contain knowl- edge of God not otherwise forthcoming. I take this to mean, at the outset: not otherwise forthcoming for the individual involved. He who prays discovers some- thing of God, and of himself in relation to God, that he could not have inferred or otherwise gathered from the funded knowledge of God at his disposal. He may have known that God is good; in and through prayer he "tastes" God's goodness; and he therefore now says, "I know him in whom I have believed." (And thus the knowledge of description and the knowledge of acquaintance fer- tilize each other.) This is not simply a matter of saying that the personal apprehension of the goodness of God is unique knowledge subjectively regarded (i.e., something he never knew before, or never knew prop- erly, but nevertheless something already known to others). This personal appre- hension is unique knowledge objectively regarded, that is, it "lays hold" of hither- to unapprehended aspects of actuality. Taken one way, this latter suggestion must surely seem very dubious, that is, if taken to mean that a hitherto unappre- hended aspect of God is now disclosed through prayer. Taken in another way, absurdity is not so obviously at hand, that is, if prayer is not the laying-hold of a "hitherto unapprehended aspect of God," but the laying-hold of a hitherto undisclosed, if not nondeterminate, "ele- ment" of the Divine Will, viz., the Di- vine Will relative to my present situa- tion. This could not have been disclosed before because this present situation is unique; and knowledge of God's will rela- tive to this present situation could not, in any case, be part of the funded knowl- edge of God or be implied (in the strict sense) by any part of that funded knowl- edge. There are other objections to be pressed against the view that prayer is a noncognitive rapport. For one, immedi- acy of relationship devoid of unique cog- nitional content would seem to imply Deus absconditus on the other end of the relationship, as has been suggested above, unless one supposes that the sub- jective situation was uncongenial to sig- nificant cognitive activity. The latter supposition is ruled out for the time being in order to consider the former. That inference appears to be incom- patible with the Christian conception of God, because it suggests a God who now makes himself known and who later con- ceals himself and who now operates in relation to finite will as more than a causal X and who later operates in a very similar context as only a causal X. The notion of one who thus makes him- self rich and who then makes himself lean, of one who moves from mode of availability to mode of unavailability, is a gross anthropomorphism, bearing alto- gether too strong a scent of human ar- bitrariness and moody caprice. The idea of the free grace of God must surely be freed so far as possible from such infec- tion. The other alternative, that subjective conditions in prayer are uncongenial for significant cognition, requires the admis- sion of one or the other of the following views: (a) though God is in fact so near 258</page><page sequence="6">SOME METAPHYSICAL GLEANINGS FROM PRAYER at hand that one is aware of rapport with him, he fails to register distinctly and distinctively because of deficiencies in the receiving apparatus; (b) the shifting pat- terns of divine cognoscibility are entirely the effect of God's manipulation of the interior conditions of finite spirits. The first view (a) cannot be seriously and consistently entertained. The assertion that he was at hand in a given situation means that he was known as directly present in or to awareness, unless one is talking in general terms about God's ubiquity; but then the acknowledgment of the truth of a metaphysical principle and the awareness of real presence are hardly identifiable with each other. If the deficiencies of the receiving apparatus were not sufficient to obliterate the awareness that God was nigh, it is absurd to suppose that revelation of who he is was in fact so obliterated. The same-or a very similar-objection can be ex- pressed as follows: Rapport is a transi- tive (and transcendental) relation, unit- ing two terms. To be so related to an- other is to be aware, in the first instance, of the other; and awareness of the rela- tionship itself follows thereafter. This is to say that rapport is denominated by its terms; it does not determine its terms. I conclude that a noncognitive rapport in general is a contradiction in terms, and so far there is no evidence forthcoming that the theory of a noncognitive rapport with God in prayer should be excepted from this judgment. If a is unsatisfactory, b remains. But this view has its own embarrassments, of which perhaps the most notable is that God is "unknown" in certain contexts of prayer because he has placed crippling restrictions upon the faculties of the soul. Again this walks the edge of the grossly anthropomorphic, on the one hand, and of irresponsible arbitrariness, on the other.6 On the whole, then, I find it very hard to see how the two things can be asserted together: (i) prayer is genuine rapport; (2) it has no unique cognitive content. If prayer lacks unique cognitive content, the temptation is very strong to write prayer as genuine rapport off as "height- ened affectivity." For aught we know God may be the cause of such elevation and intensity of feeling, which he may produce to give mediate knowledge of himself a cutting edge; but then he would be using an illusion (the awareness of im- mediate Presence) to give striking power to a skeletal knowledge of himself, mirac- ulously derived, in its validity, from sys- tematic illusion or injected equally mi- raculously into the mind whole. To do this might occur to a philosophical the- ologian; is there any reason for believing that it has also occurred to God? We are left, then, with the original and primary conviction: that God is uniquely known in prayer. To see now what this implies concerning God, let us begin with a familiar testimony: "In prayer God made known his will for me." This implies the belief that God has a "particular" will for some persons, if not for all persons (and if not for all crea- tures). Some motion or motions of his will have me and only me as their direct object.7 But the foregoing claim implies also that this particular willing is dis- covered simultaneously with its occur- rence. The notion of a volition that has occurred and is then registered or depos- ited for future reference is without mean- ing in reference to God.8 What the pray-er has come upon in prayer, he says in effect, is not something that indicates unmistakably that God has acted thus and so in relation to himself but that he 259</page><page sequence="7">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION has beheld God acting then and there upon or in relation to himself. The belief in the particular will of God that is apprehended in prayer also im- plies the "personality" of God. He who is encountered in prayer is encountered as One who addresses himself to me, who does not propose to dispose of me as a thing but who would have dealings with me person to person. Even in the higher stages of interior prayer, the personal character of rapport is not canceled. The mystic declares that he was immersed in the Divine Love and was swept out be- yond all identifiable landmarks. Yet this was Love that bore him thither and withal sustained and enraptured him; and it was Love that returned him to his appointed tasks and gave him power to endure all things. He was not carried out- ward into the acosmical night in which all distinctions are aufgehoben; he was laid hold by him who creates all things and who loves all that he has created. Thus prayer emerges as personal en- counter of finite and Infinite wills. The finite apprehends and responds to the will of the Infinite; the Infinite appre- hends and responds to the will of the finite. Nothing that can properly be said concerning the infinite "distance," onto- logical and ethical, that separates the Creator from the creature is a serious em- barrassment to this claim. God's being there in relation to him who prays may be explained as his condescension, but, so far as he is there, so far he participates in a genuine give-and-take. And, so far as he participates in this give-and-take, he acknowledges the creative potentiality resident in the will of the finite. Though this creativity be delegated to the finite, it is nonetheless there, and in acknowl- edging it and responding to it God is not acknowledging himself-he is not natura naturans nodding amiably to himself as natura naturata. It may be contended that God has complete knowledge of all possible effects of this creaturely crea- tivity, but it is notoriously difficult to state this contention in a way that leaves the actual creativity of the creature in- tact. Or, again, it may be that creaturely creativity finds adequate and ultimate expression only in rapport with God; but again the point is that the creature does bring something to this relationship and it is acknowledged by God. In prayer God and man directly en- counter each other, and this encounter is an infinitely pregnant one. The precise issue of it is unknown in advance to both the finite and the Infinite. That is to say, prayer as rapport of Infinite and finite creative wills implies a genuinely open universe, a really indeterminate future. I shall attempt now to indicate very briefly certain reasons in support of this last inference. I. Since God acknowledges the soul as will, he acknowledges that which pos- sesses on any recognizable level of its ap- pearance, freedom and spontaneity. Spe- cifically, God acknowledges the existence of an indefinitely plastic agent, a sub- stance that really acts in being acted upon, a "moved mover." This "sub- stance" has an indeterminate potential- ity, both in respect to its agency and in respect to its plasticity (or passivity), even though it has determinate powers and is in every respect a creature. Now it has indeterminate potentiality in part because of its capacity for rapport with God: its line of response or reaction to God depends upon God's disposal of him- self relative to that individual (and in this sense God "determines" the finite will). God's disposal of himself is in turn "determined" not merely by that indi- 260</page><page sequence="8">SOME METAPHYSICAL GLEANINGS FROM PRAYER vidual's particular situation but also by the particular situation of all other crea- tive agents. Thus what is relevant to the interests of a future will is a function, in part, of the "reflection" of all wills in God. What God acknowledges therefore in the finite will is an infinite capacity for "reacknowledging" or responding to him- self (and in this sense alone can it be said theistically that God acknowledges him- self and relates himself to himself, in acknowledging creaturely creativity). An advance determination of the pattern of the finite acknowledgment and reac- knowledgment of himself would entail a correlative (though prior) determination and delimitation of himself, i.e., would be a denial of God's freedom by himself. This, ex hypothesi, is impossible. 2. A determinate pattern of such give- and-take projected bindingly upon the future, even if it were possible, would deny the freedom and creativity original- ly bestowed upon the soul. From such an abrogation of the integrity and creativity of the creaturely will it would follow that in acknowledging the creature God was literally acknowledging and encountering nothing but himself, so far as real agency is concerned. And this is to fall off the precipice into acosmical pantheism. 3. The kind of projection envisaged under 2 presumes that the "future" is available to divine inspection and deter- mination. This is an extraordinarily dif- ficult notion, and I can see no clear or compelling reason for being hospitable to it any longer, and I believe such reasons can be marshaled against it. To deter- mine the future is to determine the agents that function within it. This must be done in either one of two ways: (a) by "contemporaneous" impingement upon them, by direct and instantaneous pres- sure upon them to do thus and so and not otherwise; or (b) by so bending and shap- ing the present activity of creaturely agents as to determine the future, i.e., their subsequent activity. The first way (a) has no real meaning as a mode of de- termination of the future, for it is pre- cisely not a projection of a pattern upon the future, and it looks in the direction of the disintegration of time into an infinite series of instantaneous present points having no thickness. Moreover, though God may behold all time as in the twin- kling of an eye, there is yet an earlier and a later if he reserves something of himself for application at a "later" point; and so far as he really makes such a reservation, then the future is not predetermined at all. The second way (b) either leads us straight back to 2, above, or it runs afoul of other obstacles, viz., if the future is di- vinely determined only at second hand, or at one remove. This argues the infinite receptivity or plasticity of finite agents, that the whole pattern of the future could be carried in them, but it leaves un- touched the question of possibly Infinite actual agency in the finite, so that the way is left open to saying that "the Father worketh up till now"-but the creature hereafter, though the momen- tum and direction of the creatures derive from God. Prayer as cognitive rapport directly challenges a as well as b. In prayer one discovers that the projective pattern, the pattern for the future, is not a deter- minate one. The creaturely agent is "shaped" by God, but the response of the finite will is solicited, not necessitated. Only under the latter condition could the response be "foreknown," i.e., be part of a determinate pattern that at one time was future. As it is, the encounter of God and man is truly momentous: the world will be different because of it. That 26I</page><page sequence="9">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION means not merely different from what it is now but different also from what it would otherwise have been. Several implications of these assertions may seem intolerable. For one thing, the notion of God's perfect control of affairs seems to collapse if he must contemplate an "open" universe. This is not the case. There is, in the first place, no reason for imputing to God knowledge in respect to things where no knowledge can be con- ceived of, and therefore the denial of such knowledge is no deprivation. More- over, "limitation"-- if such it is-of knowledge does not argue limitation of control. If things can be known ade- quately only as they arise or emerge into actuality, God's competence in dealing with them may yet be complete. Whether it is or not is a question for theodicy. It may be objected, further, that to allow prayer to play so immense a role is for God to rest a great deal upon a very little. Imagine God's banking so much upon so brief and fleeting an encounter as prayer! Or, to look at it more ob- viously from the finite end, the elevation of the efficacy of prayer to so lofty a pitch would seem to make megalomania a metaphysical virtue. But this objection is almost wholly emotional and rhetori- cal. It overlooks the fact that the Chris- tian claims at least that it is God's will that is apprehended and responded to in prayer, and while this claim has undoubt- edly been filed many times by fanatics of demonic intensity, it may yet be a true claim in some instances, though false in many others. Again, the objection in- volves an all too common assumption, that prayer is inherently episodic and transitory. In its lower stages this is very likely the case, but the higher the level the more continuous the rapport between God and the soul; and on the highest level (the Grund-Motiv, suggested so fruitfully by Hocking) the alternation of prayer and work must be systematically reinterpreted, because it is at least the mystic's end and goal to bring all that relates the creature to the Creator into the dazzling radiance of the uniquely cognitive rapport with God that is prayer. It seems reasonable to conclude that in and through prayer much of the deci- sive work of the Kingdom is projected and is consummated. But does this not tend to make of prayer a mere instru- mentality for the shaping of the future, and for the hewing-out of significant pat- terns in an open universe? Well, prayer is such an instrumentality, but it is not simply that. At its highest pitch, but, as well, throughout its height and depth and breadth, it is also the end and con- summation of all aspiring, this rapport of God and the soul, this union of Uncre- ated Creativity and of creaturely crea- tivity, this direct encounter of the Most High with him who is created lower than the angels. A supernal clarification of the "glass of vision" so that we may behold him face to face, a fuller disclosure of what we shall be by the grace of God and in the love of his Son, these throng the future: with all their wonder and their joy they complete and perfect what is here appre- hended in the life of prayer.

Over the long haul I should not want to see these notions dismissed without even the semblance of a fair hearing. In this context-a decidedly short haul-a wider conception of "sig- nificant and productive pursuit" is involved than the "psychologically satisfying" or the "ethically stimulating"! 4. "Standing over against" does not necessarily mean "standing in contradiction to," "standing in judgment upon." As a minimum it means appearing as other than the finite will and yet bearing in upon the finite. In certain of the higher degrees of "in- terior prayer" God is known as pervading and com- manding from within the citadel of the finite will, but that does not mean that God and the mystic have become substantially one. God still stands over against the finite will as its absolute and absolutely gracious Lord. Lord and servant have not been con- fused with each other in this mystic marriage. 5. An unfriendly critic of the faith might well judge that the Lord's Prayer was simply a ritualistic verbal stereotype. And so it is, frequently, no doubt; but the possibility is always at hand that the verbal gesture will become, unpredictably, a fecund com- munication between God and the soul. 6. Ultimately the imputation of arbitrariness to God is hardly distinguishable from gross anthropo- morphism. If God "wants what he wants when he wants it and because he wants it" and if he insists upon making his wants known but insists also on the suppression of adequate information concerning the reasons for same, he is clearly capricious, what- ever metaphysical compliments are paid him under the ascriptions of omnipotence, etc. For such a being, could he make his wants known, could also disclose adequately his reasons for his wants. And if it is good for man, the rational creature, to know what God expects, it is also good for this same creature to know that God expects the good. If the creature can understand what God wills, he can understand some- thing of the divine reason for wanting it. A dis- tinction of "ability" between these two understand- ings is particularly unintelligible on the theory of the divine manipulation of the inner states of souls, for if God ekpands the finite mind to the place where it can grasp the content of the divine will, he also can expand the finite mind to the point where it can embrace something of the workings of the divine intellect. 7. Why not an exclusively or predominantly col- lective intentionality in God's will relative to per- sons, such as species? Because if God's will for per- sons is efficacious in part through the efficacy of the wills of particular persons, each must be personally addressed. God intends the good for all, but there is no substantially identical will in all which in being moved would move all. 8. The registration and deposit of incipient phases of willing in finite agents, e.g., intending to do something when the time is propitious, is cer- tainly a real possibility. But this is not available for purposes of analogy in traditional theism, be- cause a temporal distinction between phases of willing in God is ruled out. Whatever else the notion of the eternity of God may mean, it cannot include, therefore, the notion of a willing that has occurred once and for all and that somehow or other registers itself thereafter not as occurring but simply as having occurred. 263</page></plain_text>
