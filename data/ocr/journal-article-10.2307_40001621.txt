Its inspiration seems to have been the coincidence of the Queen's Jubi- lee and widespread rioting in the same year. Moving as he was between England and Ireland, Hopkins must have felt that the Commonwealth was falling apart to the sound of jubilant huzzahing at its stability. In spite of an apparent optimism the poem is pessi- mistic, and in spite of an apparent simplicity of thought the poem depends on a singularly complex allusiveness, especially to Shake- speare's Coriolanus. { f HpOM'S GARLAND: Upon the Unemployed" is Hopkins' single A poem on public affairs. It reminds us of what is easy to forget and sometimes held to be irrelevant1- that he inhabited the England of Morris and Shaw. Not that he shares many political opinions with these contemporaries, but for once the poet seems, incontestably, to be in the same age as the priest. Recorded by the poet as being written in 1887 (September), "Tom's Garland" reflects on the two great and suggestively opposite events of that year, the riots which shook England and Ireland, and Queen Victoria's Jubilee in June. From this historical irony it moves out to a largely metaphysical dis- cussion of cosmos and chaos. Itself an uncompromisingly loyal poem, it diagnoses the current troubles as a failure of loyalty or, in the older-fashioned political terminology which Hopkins preferred, alle- giance. Carlyle, who was similarly backward-looking in such matters, would have called it servantship. In the ideal of the corporate state which is glorified the sovereign is "the lordly head," Tom and his fellows "the mighty foot," both sharing a "common honour"2 and 1See, for example, John Wain, "Gerard Manley Hopkins: an Idiom of Des- peration," in Essays on Literature and Ideas (London, 1963). 2This is from Hopkins explanatory letter to Bridges of February 10, 1888. Bridges, W. H. Gardner, and Gardner and MacKenzie quote it in their notes to the poem where it is most conveniently to be found. Cf. The Poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins, ed. W. H. Gardner and N. H.

Thus, by resolute anachronism, Hopkins simply annuls the "problem" of the unemployed: food, work, and a proper sense of station are what is needed, not social reorganization. The "fools of Radical Levellers" who give the working classes ideas above themselves (i.e., a destiny of gold crowns rather than hobnails) are simply "pests." One of these pests was William Morris. Morris as editor of The Commonweal was a direct instigator of the climax of this year of convulsion and jubilation, "Bloody Sunday," and the Trafalgar Square riots by the unemployed in November. As well as our normal alert- ness to semantic duplicity in Hopkins' poetry we should, I feel, bring an awareness of the immediate social context. So when Tom declares "Commonweal / Little I reck ho!" Hopkins, I am sure, is merging the senses of (1) Commonwealth little I wreck; (2) The Common- weal (i.e., inflammatory journalism) little I reck (i.e., in the sense of heed or care about); (3) Political theory doesn't concern me. The urgency of the poem, too, can only be appreciated by also appreciating the hysteria which seems to have possessed the country that autumn at the prospect of the red flag unfurling in the heart of London- an emergency which engaged even Hopkins' apolitical muse.3 The unemployed, however, were only half of England's problem. 1887 was a year of unprecedented upheaval in Ireland with Home- Rule and eviction riots. And Hopkins, moving as he was between the two countries, must have known that the jubilated crown was also the symbol of imperial dominion. Loyalty to Victoria's "lordly head" meant not only subservience in the theocratic state but also in the Colonial Empire. When therefore Tom, who is presumably in one of his guises an Irishman nawying in England, bellows "What! Country is honour enough in all us," he disowns Home-Rule. Despite the apparent naivete of the thinking of "Tom's Garland," its John Bullish patriotism and medievalism, it is, in the actual historical situation, cleverly comprehensive. By its very lack of specification it manages to cover the simultaneous crises of emergent socialist movements in England (the I.L.P., for example, was formed in this year; Hopkins may not have known this but he certainly sensed it) and Parnellism in Ireland, and to blot them out with a timely hurrah 3I am aware of Hopkins' confession that he was a Communist at the time of the Paris Commune. One assumes that his views had become more con- servative in the following sixteen years, or that he was able to view a revolution across the English Channel with more complacency than one across the Irish.</page><page sequence="3">JOHN SUTHERLAND / 113 for the crown. It is in this respect a misleadingly confident poem. The poet's letters show him to have been privately more fearful of the future and the wrecking capacity of the lower classes than at any time since the Paris Commune of 1871. To Bridges in February he writes: You will see, it is the beginning of the end: Home Rule or separation is near. Let them come: anything is better than the attempt to rule a people who own no principle of civil obedience at all, not only to the existing government but to none at all. I should be glad to see Ireland happy, even though it involved the fall of England, if that could come about without shame and guilt. But Ireland will not be happy: a people without a principle of allegiance cannot be; moreover this movement has throughout been promoted by crime.4 The "principle of allegiance" which the poem celebrates was, Hopkins realized in one part of his mind, forever lost. So for all its forced virility of tone and certitude of opinion "Tom's Garland" was written in a defeated spirit. And this, I suggest, accounts for that feature which all commentators have noted, the almost wanton complexity of the expression, a complexity which implies that the poet was in- different, or felt it was of no importance whether he was understood or not, even by his restricted readership. Hence the paradox that the unique poem of public affairs is uttered in a uniquely private lan- guage. "Tom's Garland" is, arguably, the most unattractively diffi- cult poem in the Hopkins canon, so thickly enfolded in its own technique as to be almost strangled by it. Certainly the poet seems to have seen in it a boundary beyond which he would lose himself. To a bewildered Bridges he confides: "It is plain I can go no further on this road: if you . . . cannot understand me who will?" In expression the poem is ultra-Hopkinsian, a prime example of the "mannerism," the deliberate "oddity and obscurity" against which Bridges felt he had to warn the Edwardian reader. But although the syntactic gaps are even wider than usual, and the lexical units even more compressed, the poem is not absolutely obscure; at least not so if one pays full attention to the given sub-title, "upon the Unemployed." It is, however, undeniably odd. The hearty mimicry of the navvy's roaring voice and the poem's subtle, reactionary argu- ment do not mix well. In the uncomfortable falsetto which results there is a more than passing resemblance to the self-conscious con- trivances of Meredith's prose- in this extract from The Ordeal of Richard Fever el, for example: February 17, 1887.

Press, 1935), p. 252.</page><page sequence="4">114 / VICTORIAN POETRY There lay Tom; hobnail Tom! a bacon-munching, reckless, beer-swilling animal! and yet a man; a dear brave human heart notwithstanding; capable of devotion and unselfishness. The boy's better spirit was touched, and it kindled his imagination to realize the abject figure of poor clodpole Tom, and surround it with a halo of mournful light.5 The resemblance between this and "Tom's Garland" may not be entirely accidental. Meredith's Tom Bakewell is under arrest for rick-burning, the standard symptom of industrial unrest. But more probably Hopkins is drawing on an extraliterary tradition of social discussion in which "Tom" is the paternalistic eponym for working class man, or as the OED puts it, "a generic name for any male representative of the common people." As with Uncle Tom it is a consoling image because it suggests that there is an instinctive docility in him, if only one is kind to the animal. In the political huckster Johnson, in Felix Holt, George Eliot gives us an example which places another of the spurious simplifications which the argument by reference to Tom is liable to: I should like to ask them, "What colliers?" There are colliers up at Newcastle, and there are colliers down in Wales. Will it do any good to honest Tom, who is hungry in Sproxton, to hear that Jack at Newcastle has his bellyful of beef and pudding?8 Felix recognizes the divisive tendency of this and answers, unexpect- edly, "yes." Hopkins was not the first to celebrate this generalized Tom in verse. Almost a century before, Hannah More had written The Riot, or, Half a Loaf is better than no Bread, In a dialogue between Jack Anvil and Tom Hod. Written in '95, a Year of Scarcity and Alarm.7 This doggerel propaganda begins: Tom. Come Neighbours, no longer be patient and quiet, Come let us go kick up a bit of a riot; I'm hungry, my lads, but I've little to eat, So we'll pull down the mills, and we'll seize all the meat. Tom, however, is talked out of his anarchic courses by Jack, who urges that king and parliament should be trusted to arrange a remedy and clinches his remarks with the (unironic) consolation: "The gentlefolks too will afford us supplies; / They'll subscribe- and they'll give up their puddings and pies." Finally persuaded, Tom throws down his pitchfork and returns to his work. As a poem The Riot has 5The Works of George Meredith (London, 1896), I, 61. 6Felix Holt, Blackwoods Cheap Edition (London, 1896), p. 125.

So far I have mentioned some of the contemporary background of 'Tom's Garland," outlined a little of Tom's literary genealogy, and touched on the overwrought nature of the poem's language. Any of these could provide the basis for extended discussion. But I want instead to concentrate my remarks on the poem's remarkably sustained and homogeneous "underthought," as W. H. Gardner would call it. As he wrote "Tom's Garland" Shakespeare's Coriolanus seems to have been constantly in the poet's mind, and its presence is interfused with the finished work. Whether it is there as influence, allusion, or analogue is hard to say and probably pointless to investigate. But it is, indisputably, there. The relationship has yet to be shown but some advance reasons may be given for the evocation. Coriolanus is a play angry in tone and conservative in attitude; it shows the destructive nature of an insubordinate plebeian class and returns time and again to the reference point of the body-politic. On a casual reading the link between Coriolanus and "Tom's Garland" is suggested by one word- "mammock." The word occurs but once in all Shakespeare's plays and once in all Hopkins' extant poetry. Both poets employ it as a verb while its most common usage is as a noun; it is thus, the OED tells us, that "mammock" is first re- corded in Skelton's Colin Clout with the meaning "scrap of food." Shakespeare is apparently the first to have used it as a verb denoting a violent tearing into pieces. The context of this rare verb in poem and play attaches it to an implied violation of maternal tenderness. Young Marcius, his "father's son," is described to his mother (the only gentle character in a very rugged play) and to his grandmother smashing the gilded butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go again; and after it again; and over and over he comes, and up again; catched it again; or whether his fall enraged him or how 'twas, he did so set his teeth and tear it; O, I warrant, how he mammocked it! (I, iii, 61-66 )8 This crude destructive response to situations requiring delicacy is one of the key motifs of the play. There is a similar blind violence in the poem's version of the word, and a similar emotive heightening 8Line references are to the Arden edition. They may vary slightly from other standard texts.</page><page sequence="6">116 / VICTORIAN POETRY aroused by associating it with motherhood: "or mother-ground / That mammocks, mighty foot." An intensification of effect is gained here not so much by narrative circumstance as by alliteration, rhythm, and animation of language ("mighty foot" is both subject and object of "mammock"; "mammock" itself evokes the gigantism of "mammoth"). The appearance of "mammock" and its parallel usage establishes a coincidental identification which one can support by further com- parison of the texts. "Garland" is a peculiar term with which to approach the labor problems of the nineteenth century. Superficially it seems to be a rather fanciful combination of a spontaneous visual impression: "Tom- garlanded with squat and surly steel" (i.e. with his pick over his shoulder thus forming a metal collar) and the more reflective metaphysical idea of a badge of station- "gold go garlanded / With, perilous, O, no"- and of a mark of socially awarded merit. This is quite different from the way in which garlands are brought in as vaguely classical and picturesque furniture in much Romantic poetry. It is possible that Hopkins was thinking of Arnold's Friend- ship's Garland, which dealt with social problems, or Ruskin's Crown of Wild Olive, which the worker could win by the sweat of his brow.9 There is, however, a strong concurrence between the nature of Tom's garland and those we find in Coriolanus. Coriolanus' garlands are all won in his rightful occupation, war; as Tom earns his with the pick Coriolanus earns his by the sword: Caius Marcius wears this war's garland (I, ix, 60) He comes the third time home with the oaken garland (II, i, 122) He lurch'd all swords of the garland (II, ii, 101) "Garland" signifying preeminence and duty well done occurs four times in Coriolanus. In no other play of Shakespeare, the Concordance tells us, is the term found more than twice, and then often with vari- ant meanings. More interesting than this statistical evidence, though, is the invariable association of the idea of the garland with the un- fortunate hero (there is a similar juxtaposition of reward and exile in the poem); The Soldier's Garland would be an ironically effective subtitle to the play. 9More remotely the image of the garland is rich in allusion. Hopkins' reference to thorns in the poem reinforces an association with Christ's crown of thorns and crown of glory. Donne similarly confuses these with the classical laurel crown in "La Corona." It is also possible that Hopkins was thinking of Pliny's famous description of still garlanded generals returning to the plough in Rome's Golden Age.</page><page sequence="7">JOHN SUTHERLAND / 117 In his gloss of the sonnet for Bridges, Hopkins explains "iron" garland as "the nails they wear" (i.e. in the soles of their boots) and from the poem itself we can infer the addition of the "surly steel" pick. "Steel" and "iron" in Coriolanus have a very different but in some ways an analogous meaning; they are the metonymic emblems of war. "This peace is nothing but to rust iron" (IV, v, 225), com- plains a disgusted Volsce. For steel picks we can read "steel pikes" (V, vi, 151). To the military Roman state, war is what work is to industrial England, an honorable employment of the nation's man- power*. War and work respectively are the antidotes to the inertia and internal dissension paralyzing a society where there is "No way sped, / Nor mind nor mainstrength" and "steel grown soft as is the parasite's silk" (I, ix, 45). It is perhaps apposite to refer here to the attraction the military life seems to have held for Hopkins, an attraction we can infer from the subjects and imagery of many of the poems, and also his frequent blending of military terminology in his poetic diction: Of a fresh and following folded rank Not spared, not one ( "Binsey Poplars" ) Sometimes a lantern moves along the night, That interests our eyes. And who goes there? ( "The Lantern out of Doors" ) Though as a beechbole firm, finds his, as at a roll-call, rank And features, in flesh, what deed he each must do- His sinew- service where do ( "Harry Ploughman" ) And in "Tom's Garland" "bold steel" has an overtone of the more familiar "cold steel." Coriolanus opens not merely with restless "musty" peace but with bread riots; the first citizen voices the general grievance: "Let us revenge this with our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge" (I, i, 21-24). This too finds an echo in "Tom's Garland": "Commonweal / Little I reck ho! lacklevel in, if all had bread." Both works maintain that hunger causes dissidence, and, more importantly, that lack of employment (war/work) causes hunger. Rebellion motivated by privation finds its cause, and its refuta- tion, in the ideal of the Commonweal. This is a concept structural to both Coriolanus and "Tom's Garland." Its allegorical model, the body- politic, is by no means original. In his letter to Bridges explaining the poem Hopkins writes: "As St. Paul and Plato and Hobbes and everybody says, the commonwealth or well ordered human society is</page><page sequence="8">118 / VICTORIAN POETRY like one man; a body with many members and each its function." The body-politic is also, according to Caroline Spurgeon, the "central im- age"10 of Coriolanus: "It obtrudes," she says, "throughout the play; any- one on a first reading will notice and remember it" (p. 349). It is out- lined explicitly very early in the action by Menenius' "pretty tale" of the time "when all the body's members rebelled against the belly" (I, i, 94). Society, according to this anthropomorphic fable, has its "kingly-crowned head" (I, i, 114) and at its base the foremost of the mob "you, the great toe of this assembly" (I, i, 154). In "Tom's Garland" we have the "lordly head" (the sovereign as Hopkins tells us in his note ) and "the foot is the day-labourer." In both works the hierarchy is justified by parity of function, and in both the demand for equality of privilege is radically antisocial Partnering this view of the serving member of society as humble but necessary limb is that of him as predatory animal when he ceases to be corporate and turns rebel. Coriolanus is exiled from Rome as a gangrenous foot (III, i, 303); he returns as the "osprey" who will take the city "by sovereignty of nature" (IV, vii, 35). Similarly the ranks of the people are transformed by disaffection into a "cry of curs" (III, iii, 120). The last couplet of the sonnet could well be an example of Coriolanus' own numerous invectives against the "beast with many heads" ( IV, i, 2 ) : "This by Despair, bred Hangdog dull; by Rage, / Manwolf, worse; and their packs infest the age." Hopkins' mention of "infest" also recalls one of the major thematic strains of imagery in Coriolanus, that of disease, contagion, and epidemic: you herd of- Boils and Plagues Plaster you over, that you may be abhorr'd Further than seen and one infect another Against the wind a mile! (I, iv, 31-34) In his letter on the poem Hopkins refers contemptuously to "Loafers, Tramps, Cornerboys, Roughs, Socialists and other pests of society." The organizers of the equivalent pests in Coriolanus are the crafty tribunes of the people, Brutus and Sicinius. The Commonweal is always in their mouths: they talk of "the body o' the weal" (II, iii, 179 ) and proclaim Coriolanus "A foe to the public weal" ( III, i, 173 ) and assert: "The commonwealth doth stand and so would do / Were he more angry at it" (IV, vi, 14-15). As Menenius employs the argu- ment of the Commonweal to pacify the mob, using a parable made up of their own political notions, so with the same ideas the tribunes 10Shakespeare's Imagery (Cambridge Univ. Press, 1935) p. 347.</page><page sequence="9">JOHN SUTHERLAND / 119 (like the "fools of Radical Levellers" Hopkins accuses) stir up in- surrection. In the poem too there is a certain ambivalence of mean- ing: "Commonweal," the order of society, is contrasted with "world's weal," the order of nature. As Coriolanus shows, the concept is sufficiently adaptable to be used polemically by either of the con- flicting parties. Against this too flexible theory Hopkins and Shake- speare introduce the too simple emotional appeal to nationalism: "What! Country is honour enough in all us," cries Tom. In the play the patricians are as constantly invoking "country" as the tribunes do the commonweal: If any think that brave death outweighs bad life / And that his country's dearer than himself (I, vi, 72, Coriolanus) induced / As you have been; that's for my country (I, ix, 17, Coriolanus) The blood that he hath lost ... he dropped it for his country (III, i, 296-298, Menenius ) I do love My country's good with a respect more tender, More holy and profound, than mine own life (III, iii, 111-113, Cominius ) So far the analogies observed have been direct or parallel. To whatever degree derivative Hopkins' poem contains imagery, diction, progress of thought, and attitudes similar to those contained in the larger work. The next stage of the comparison becomes more specu- lative, however. It will be suggested that, consciously or uncon- sciously, Hopkins transferred certain of the characteristics of Corio- lanus to his own less individual Tom. Thus the image of power in "Tom's Garland" is not the patrician warrior but the manual worker. Both these "garlanded" heroes embody an irresistible and primitive massiveness, both are portrayed with heroic exaggeration: when he walks, he moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before his treading (V, iv, 18-20) piles pick By him and rips out rockfire homeforth. In the sonnet it is Tom who is "undenizened," in the play Coriolanus who is "hooted" out of Rome into banishment. Exile turns "Tom Heart-at-ease" to "Hangdog" and "Manwolf." Coriolanus disgar- landed goes "alone / Like to a lonely dragon" (IV, i, 30). The clause in the poem, "mother-ground / That mammocks, mighty foot," in addition to its primary affinity through "mammock," has another in its echo of Volumnia arguing her son out of sacking Rome:</page><page sequence="10">120 / VICTORIAN POETRY thou shalt no sooner March to assault thy country than to tread- Trust to 't, thou shalt not- on thy mother's womb That brought thee to this world (V, iii, 121-124) At their best Tom and Coriolanus evince a noble disinterestedness: What! Country is honour enough in all us. Our spoils he kicked at, rewards His deeds with doing them, and is content To spend the time to end it (II, ii, 124-129) In their proper element both are invulnerable: Tom seldom sick, Seldomer heartsore; that treads through, prickproof, thick Thousands of thorns, thoughts. Coriolanus similarly belittles his multitudinous wounds as "Scratches with briers, / Scars to move laughter only" (III, iii, 52-53). Both Tom and Coriolanus are sublimely unthinking and unpolitical crea- tures whose lives should ideally be those of natural reflective activity, "making no hardship of hardness, taking all easy" (Hopkins to Bridges). One could conceivably justify this transfer of attributes from patrician to plebeian as attendant on the change from oligarchic to semidemocratic in the social schemes of the two worlds. But it would probably be casuistic to rationalize it other than as a process of very unsystematic association of ideas. On a purely fortuitous level, however, the resemblances are many. Both works are untypical of their authors and have been somewhat neglected, perhaps on account of a joint complexity of expression and austerity of mood. Nowhere is Hopkins less the nature poet (or indeed the priest); nowhere is Shakespeare less lyrical. "Tom's Garland" conspicuously lacks "the roll, the rise, the carol, the creation" of the poet's other works. It is almost unique, for example, in having no color references (except for the neutral "fallow" which has a complex of meanings- the earth which Tom and Dick tread, the suggestion of rest after work or "lying fallow"). The language of both play and sonnet is elliptic, violent, and tending to hyperbole. It is unlikely that having come this far the reader will echo Hopkins' "O, once explained, how clear it all is!" Apart from the word "mammock" and the idea of the body politic, Coriolanus permeates the poem as a miasma which defies complete distillation. One's conclusion about "Tom's Garland" is probably the same as one's</page><page sequence="11">JOHN SUTHERLAND / 121 first impression- that it is very odd: a social-problem poem by a poet of whom John Wain has said that his only connection with the nineteenth century was that for forty-five years he drew breath in it, a poem whose closeness to contemporary events is contradic- ted by an exceptionally remote language and allusive infrastructure.</page></plain_text>
