<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Fronting the Dreadful Mysteries of Time": Durer's Melencolia in Thomson's City of Dreadful Night PETER C. NOEL-BENTLEY Abstract. The image of Durer's Melencolia I at the end of James Thomson's The City of Dreadful Night resolves every major theme and image of the poem. And though the canto in which she appears (XXI, the last in the poem) was also the last to be written, the conception of a statue or statue-like personage overlooking a demonic City dates back to The Doom of a City (1857), where the personage is male. The development of the image from the male personage of 1857 through the female statue of "A Lady of Sorrow" and Melencolia herself in "The 'Melencolia' of Albrecht Durer" in the 1860's, to the final manifestation of Melencolia in The City of Dreadful Night parallels Thomson's development from orthodox Calvinist to despairing atheist. Thomson's religious views at the times of writing are reflected in his narrators' attitudes toward the statue-like images. STUMBLING across a print of Durer's engraving of Melen- colia I in the early 1860's is one ofthose happy literary accidents which lend themselves to great art.1 Not that Melencolia I transformed Thomson's way of thinking nor even that it gave Thomson sudden inspiration, for it was a decade before his conception of Melencolia I ripened to its final statement in canto XXI of The City of Dreadful Night. In that final canto the figure of Melencolia resolves every major theme and image of The, City of Dreadful Night-she is in every way the summation of the poem. Indeed, the very topography of Thomson's City can be seen behind Melencolia in Durer's 1 Delivered at the second annual conference of the \fictorian Studies Association of Western Canada, at the University of Victoria, Victoria, B.C., October 6, 1973. 193</page><page sequence="2">194/ VICTORIAN POETRY engraving. Looking from the north, as Thomson's City is described to us in canto I, a visitor to the City would see the harbor (shipless) before him, houses to the right, sea to the east and south and, because the City is on a bay, west. The scene in Diirer's Melencolia I contains that identical view. We can see how The City of Dreadful Night has been built around and has been building towards the image of Melencolia overlooking the City, "that grand and awful Melancholy of Albert Diirer which dominates the City of my poem," as Thomson wrote George Eliot.2 The final conception of Melencolia took sixteen years to come to fruition in a process that mirrors Thomson's development from orthodox Calvinist to despairing atheist. Thomson learned a dogmatic religion, and the implications of a dogmatic definition of religion did not escape him. He was too much bound by his training ever to reject the determinism which both Irvingism and Calvinism include. He transferred his dogmatic approach to belief onto science and by doing so transferred the locus of determinism from an essentially benevolent, anthropomorphic, teleological God to an uncaring, non-human, volitionless, and purposeless mechanism. The determinism had become biological and environmental. Thomson's religious assumptions never changed: without personal immortality life can have no meaning; the proper condition of man is Biblical; guilt sets a man apart from his God and from his fellows. Evolutionary science allowed no personal immortality, so life for Thomson came to have no meaning. He came to believe that man wanders through a Biblical desert which has no Promised Land; and he came to feel reprobate, paradoxically, from the God in whom he could not believe and, hence, to feel isolated from humankind. The process begins in The Doom of a City (1857). The main features of the Melencolia figure are present in this early poem: a personage, frozen as a statue, overlooks a City, a personage who symbolizes the state of religious existence in that City. But the figure in 1857 is male and arrogantly self-assured of the power of the human mind to read all theological mysteries. For a Calvinist such a figure symbolizes folly in its most extreme form. The male personage of 1857 is not, then, in any sense a figure of comfort for the hopeless. Written under the philosophic influence of Calvin, The Doom of a City is imbued with that fear and trembling-"that dreadful sentence of eternal death"3- which Calvin so joyfully promises devout Christians. The male personage thus contains in symbolic form the implications of being reprobate in the eyes of God. The implications are defined by the fact that the personage was once a human being who has been frozen into stone-he 2 Anne Ridler, "Introduction," Poems and Some Letters of James Thomson (London, 1963), p. xxii. 3John Calvin, Calvin: Institutes of the Christian Religion, ed.

To the horrified first-person narrator of the poem, the stone statues of this frozen City exist as testaments to the victory of the inorganic world over the organic. The inhabitants' being "Frozen into a nightmare's ghastly death"4 implies lack of an afterlife, the fear of ultimate nothingness. In the midst of this frozen City, the narrator stumbles across a "lofty turret" (II, 348). In it, overlooking the City, in a scene prophetic of the view from the throne of Melencolia in The City of Dreadful Night , sits the frozen figure of a personage: He sits, the full-length statue of a Sage, Amid the busts of those of every age Who handed on the torch of Wisdom, bright With growing splendour, 'thwart the billowy night Of shoreless Ignorance. Before him lies The roll which telleth on what mysteries He shed its lustre till they shone out clear: I trace its periods by the moonlight here. (II, 366-373) Follow the problems which he hath resolved Though heretofore in clouds of doubt involved: "Shall this fair World consume in course of time? Our Earth is young? or old? or in her prime?" (II, 394-397) The torch of Wisdom throws light, the Sage believes, on the mysteries of time. The Sage confronts the dreadful mysteries of time through a kind of positivist naturalism, "cosmic Life" (II, 410) being the Sage's term for it. Thomson's narrator is horrified at the Sage's answer: I trace not further in the tingling scroll The steps by which he reached this glorious goal. It is too horrible: -alone, alone I make mad dalliance with the empty flesh, Whose form is whole, whose ghastly bloom is fresh; And by my side, that hater of the soul- The grinning, the accursed Skeleton ! It is too horrible- (II, 426-433) The Sage has substituted, in his intellectual presumption, the organic world of nature for the divine world of God. For his presumption the Sage has been turned to stone, a transformation that leads the narrator to the despairing conclusion in the lines above that the inorganic world is the only existence which is possible in a world stripped of its divinity. The Sage has attempted to measure the universe and thereby to explain and conquer it; his actions have been the futile attempts of a materialist to make sense out of human life. For the narrator, the image of the Sage implies only that 4James Thomson, Poems and Some Letters of James Thomson (London, 1963), p. 25. Quotation is from Part II, line 213.

(II, 507-5 10) Although The Doom of a City is a perfectly orthodox religious poem, Thomson did suffer throughout the 1850's from grave religious doubts. The fears expressed by the narrator in The Doom of a City in his journey through the frozen City are a testament to the strength of these doubts even when they were answered. Thomson's reading of Darwin's Origin of Species confirmed his religious fears. The victory of the inorganic and timeless world over the organic and finite, the extreme implications of what the narrator sees in The Doom of a City, seemed verified. Thomson's major creative response in the period immediately following his confrontation with the Darwinian hypothesis in 1863 was the prose phantasy, "A Lady of Sorrow" (1864). The image of Melencolia here reflects the second stage of Thomson's development from Calvinist to atheist. In "A Lady of Sorrow," a gigantic statue overlooks a City identified by the narrator as London. In the midst of this London is a Biblical desert of desolation: "With awe and secret shuddering terror, I felt crushing me down the omnipotence of Fate; Fate the Sphynx in the desert of life. . . ; Fate which weaves lives only too real in the loom of destiny so mysterious, uncompassionate of their agonies in the process; Fate, God petrified; the dumb, blind, soulless deification of Matter."5 The last phrase reveals the secret of the narrator's terror: science has made Matter supreme and eternal and the soul is the thing that dies. A colossal image of the demonic deity of this terrifying world sits in the desert. The image is now female and rules, much as the Sage gave direction to, the petrified material world described above: Right opposite to where I stood, a league beyond the farther bank of the silent everflowing river of the peoples, towered a vast black shape dwarfing the Cyclopean rock- wall behind it; an image colossal, like to that which the king of Babylon set up in the plain of Dura, that all men might bow down and worship it; a colossal image of black marble, the Image and the concentration of the whole blackness of Night, as of a Woman seated, veiled from head to foot; and the ranks as they pass it bow down all with one impulse, like ranks of corn before a steady blowing wind. (p. 317) The statue rises above the river of people as a kind of Scylla or destructive Cyclops; but nothing escapes her- no hero, no savior, no Jason, no Odysseus. She rules the inhabitants of the city with all the arbitrariness of sea- destruction. The golden image which Nebuchadnezzar sets up in the plain of Dura has in the Book of Daniel no power over the believers, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; the Hebrew God makes a proper intrusion into the natural world (the fire in the furnace) to negate the golden idol. But this 5 James Thomson, The Speedy Extinction of Evil and Misery: Selected Prose of James Thomson (B.V.), ed. William David Schaefer (Univ. of California Press, 1967), p. 314.

She chants over and over in perpetuity, "All Life's continual moving / Moveth only for Death" (p. 318). As Queen or Patroness or Goddess of Despair she takes on in physical form the sorrows of humankind. Melencolia here combines for the first time in Thomson's work the maternal principle with "the concentration of the whole blackness of Night." The Sage was viewed in The Doom of a City with certain moral condemnation; and the colossal image of "A Lady of Sorrow" verges on the satanic. The development of the figure into Diirer's Melencolia I reflects the development of Thomson's conception of the universe from divinely ordered, organic cosmos to demonic, petrified chaos. Thus, in his "The 'Melencolia' of Albrecht Durer," written circa 1862-1865, the image which embodies all human desolation is not itself demonic. The image, in Melencolia, has become witness to the petrified materialist universe and offers strength, even comfort, to those who gaze on her. In this poem the shift from Calvin's iron law and the commandments of an anthropomorphic Deity to the laws of scientific determinism has been completed. Like the Babylonian image of "A Lady of Sorrow," Melencolia is a giantess: She sits, a Woman like a Titaness: Her clench't left hand, the elbow on its knee, Supports her cheek with concentrative stress; The unremembered right unconsciously Still holds the sphere-describing compasses; And strown about the narrow floor we see The instruments with which she lately wrought To carve material symbols of her thought. (11. 1-8) Around Melencolia are scientific, specifically geometric instruments. She has measured time and space and has detected evidence in her measurements of a cosmic law (Fate) which cares nothing for men, evidence of an expanse of time which negates humankind's puny little expanse of existence, and evidence of the knowledge that "the desert's gloomy mysteries" (1. 14), which hide the meaning of life (if any), never can be pierced. The despair is captured for her in the "material symbols of her thought" which her instruments have also carved. In setting herself scientifically and rationally "To clutch the inmost mysteries that hide / In Nature's being and God's government" (11. 28-29), Thomson's Melencolia has discovered a cosmic nihilism: And she has found but Fate -God petrified- And not a single word or sign can wring From the tremendous, dumb, blind, crushing Thing. (11. 30-32) The phrasing of her conclusion reminds us of the identification of "Fate, God petrified" with "the dumb, blind, soulless deification of Matter" in "A Lady</page><page sequence="6">198 / VICTORIAN POETRY of Sorrow." The "Thing," that is, must be read as the replacement of the traditional anthropomorphic God, the replacement enthroned by science. Thus, with "hopeless consciousness of Fate" (1. 37), Thomson's Melencolia makes the final extension of her discoveries to time, which science, represented by her instruments, has opened up endlessly for man: "Time's progress on the world's broad dial-face / With grand unlingering, unhurrying pace" (11. 4748). The attitude toward philosophical measurement of time and space by the human intellect has clearly changed from 1857. The response of the Sage which in 1857 seemed foolish is by the mid-1 860's the legitimate response. By the time of The City of Dreadful Night the numinous world has been stripped entirely of its divinity and the religious response of Thomson the Calvinist to such a world is to see the state of man as lost in a desert of exile without hope ever of attaining the Promised Land. The world turns totally demonic in the full sense of that term, where everything that exists is a parody of the divine state. In the City of Dreadful Night itself appear cathedrals which symbolize the futility of the attempt to embody God, deserts which contain Apocalyptic wild beasts, and streets like circular labyrinths that lead nowhere except to a monstrous sphinx in the City's northern suburbs. In such a world Melencolia symbolizes the only existence that is possible. She sits, a parody of the divine female figure (Beatrice or Mary), high over the City on a plateau (itself a parody of the Biblical mountain) surrounded by symbols of isolation, her instruments. As God gathers everything up to Him in the divine Apocalypse, so Melencolia, by measuring time and space, sees everything in terms of their unique and isolated qualities. Further, as man is created in God's image, so every inhabitant described in The City of Dreadful Night is created in Melencolia's image: she is a bronze statue (the inhabitants wear masks of stone and seem at times made of stone) and therefore cannot act, but she has eternal consciousness nonetheless. The state of existence which so horrified the narrator of The Doom of a City has become an undeniable reality. The City of Dreadful Night develops from this consciousness that brings despair. It is communicated through the figure of the first-person narrator of the poem who journeys through the City over the space of one night. He begins at the center of the City by the river running through it eastwards to the sea, moves northwards to the suburbs, and ends by the plateau overlooking the City on which rests the image of Diirer's Melencolia I. In his nocturnal trek the narrator meets various inhabitants whose stories and conversations form the basis of the ten even-numbered cantos of The City of Dreadful Night (II-XX). His journey is a voyage of discovery that consists of a series of symbolic adventures that illustrate the demonic isolation of human existence in the City. Because it is a voyage of discovery, this narrator does not know what to make of his encounters. The Proem and eleven</page><page sequence="7">PETER C NOEL-BENTLEY I 199 odd-numbered cantos (I-XXI) supply the description and philosophy that make sense of these symbolic adventures. The Proem is written by the first-person narrator after his quest is over; in it he tells us why and to whom he is communicating the story of his quest. The odd-numbered cantos, which are in the third person (except for the plural "our" in canto IX and "we" in XIII), are the narrator's own later interspersed commentary. Through this method of narration the mind or consciousness of the narrator is shown us at different levels of awareness. He begins his quest by observing, grows more involved in what he sees as he journeys through the City, and ends at the center of action and experience. By canto XX, the great sphinx scene, he is in fact the sole inhabitant present. After his experiences he writes of them, as he tells us in the Proem, and thus moves through the quest again-or watches himself as he has moved through the quest- commenting in the odd-numbered cantos as he progresses through this second journey. We remember that the City is a labyrinth from which there is no escape, except by cessation of consciousness in death; thus the narrator, like the inhabitants he meets in the symbolic adventures or parables, can be seen to be retracing the circle of his experiences in the writing of the poem as, by implication, he must retrace them in his consciousness during the length of his life. The end of his quest is the statue of Melencolia in canto XXI, though the narrator-pilgrim does not know this until he reaches it. C. S. Lewis describes the quest of Spenser's Arthur as the "embodiment of. . .'Eros religion', the thirst of the soul for the Perfection beyond the created universe. ... It is in the very nature of the Platonic quest and the Eros religion that the soul cannot know her true aim till she has achieved it."6 The embodiment of Perfection in the demonic world of the City of Dreadful Night is the mechanistic inevitability immanent in the universe, symbolized, as the Apocalyptic Perfection is symbolized by God, by Melencolia's state of being. And, as Melencolia is the true aim of the quest, she is also the true aim of the narrator's later commentary, for canto XXI, though recording the last symbolic adventure of the narrator-pilgrim, is properly a descriptive canto. The poem's diverse methods of narration resolve themselves in this canto. Melencolia expresses both the essentially emotional reactions of the narrator- as-pilgrim and his later intellectual or philosophical resignation. Melencolia's brooding inactivity, as she sits with the tools of action around her, is a perfect emblem for the two positions. At the end of his journey through the City, described in the highly complex images of the even-numbered cantos, the narrator-pilgrim has only one stance left to him with which to affirm life, and that is an affirmation of despair. This final position allows him to attain the stoical endurance of ^English Literature in the Sixteenth Century, Excluding Drama (Oxford Univ. Press, 1954, p. 383.</page><page sequence="8">200 / VICTORIAN POETR Y intellectual and philosophical detachment. Melencolia provides the image of such endurance and detachment and the image of affirmation. In the reworking of Melencolia in The City of Dreadful Night from "The Melencolia' of Albrecht Diirer," she is thus made into a figure of strength and especially of comfort. She offers, as far as it is possible to do so in the reality of life in a demonic universe, an answer for time- consciousness. The later Melencolia succeeds much better than the early one in symbolizing the endurance of an existence governed by Fate. "The 'Melencolia' of Albrecht Diirer" relies more on a statement of the philosophy of Fate than on its images. Here, for example, is the bat-like thing that holds the scroll of Melencolia I in the earlier poem: A bat is floating in the waste of air, Its uncouth wings outspread to spread the scroll Whereon-perchance imprinted by the glare Of those fierce eyes instinct with fiery soul- One word is legible; one word, yet ne'er In volume heaped on volume was the whole Of any nature more completely writ: This "Melencolia" comprehends all wit. (11. 1 7-24) Words like "uncouth" and "fierce" are non-descriptive-affirmative rather than demonstrative. In general in the stanza and throughout the poem statement replaces the metaphorical representation of statement. The stanza becomes in canto XXI of The City of Dreadful Night: The comet hanging o'er the waste dark seas, The massy rainbow curved in front of it Beyond the village with the masts and trees; The snaky imp, dog-headed, from the Pit, Bearing upon its batlike leathern pinions Her name unfolded in the sun's dominions, The 'MELENCOLIA' that transcends all wit. (XXI, 36-42) The visual description is much more concentrated: the "bat" has become a "snaky imp, dog-headed, from the Pit," an extremely graphic account, and the sun that "is drowning from the skies" in the early attempt (1. 12) is now a comet of the night. The rainbow, being of night, is thus more effectively obtrusive, a more forceful parody of the circle of perfection. In the same way, the instruments with which Melencolia in the early poems "lately wrought / To carve material symbols of her thought" (11. 7-8) are identified in The City of Dreadful Night by name in a list that is like a chant. The details of Diirer's engraving are closely delineated and include descriptions of the wolf-hound and the winged babe: Words cannot picture her; but all men know That solemn sketch the pure sad artist wrought Three centuries and threescore years ago, With phantasies of his peculiar thought: The instruments of carpentry and science</page><page sequence="9">PETER C NOEL-BENTLEY I 201 Scattered about her feet, in strange alliance With the keen wolf-hound sleeping un distraught; Scales, hour-glass, bell, and magic-square above; The grave and solid infant perched beside, With open winglets that might bear a dove, Intent upon its tablets, heavy-eyed; Her folded wings as of a mighty eagle, But all too impotent to lift the regal Robustness of her earth-born strength and pride. (XXI, 15-28) Thomson's interpretation of the infant has it a younger Melencolia. A modern study interprets the infant (and the dog) somewhat differently: The dozing of the tired and hungry dog. . .signifies the dull sadness of a creature entirely given over to its unconscious comfort or discomfort; while the industry of the writing putto signifies the careless equanimity of a being that has only just learnt the contentment of activity, even when unproductive, and does not yet know the torment of thought, even when productive; it is not yet capable of sadness, because it has not yet attained human stature. The conscious sorrow of a human being wrestling with problems is enhanced both by the unconscious suffering of the sleeping dog and by the happy unselfconsciousness of the busy child. Thomson's dog, because it has no consciousness and no thinking powers is un distraught; it lives a mechanical life happily because it is a mechanical creature. But the putto is a conscious thinking creature and has already been burdened with awareness of time and the geometric law which, when applied to the cosmos, chains his spirit to the mechanical existence of the dog. The instruments that lie around Melencolia and her infant apprentice have measured the time and space of human life; in their results lies the despair shared by Melencolia and the inhabitants of the City. "Thus has the artist copied her" (1. 43), writes Thomson: Unvanquished in defeat and desolation, Undaunted in the hopeless conflagration Of the day setting on her baffled prime. (XXI, 47-49) Despite being defeated and "sick of soul" (1. 51), she works on "Sustained by her indomitable will" (1. 52). To endure is the only affirmation a creature of dreadful night can feel, despite The sense that every struggle brings defeat Because Fate holds no prize to crown success; That all the oracles are dumb or cheat Because they have no secret to express; That none can pierce the vast black veil uncertain Because there is no light beyond the curtain; That all is vanity and nothingness. (XXI, 64-70) Various themes of the poem are summarized in these lines. First, life is a cheat because there is no reward in an afterlife. Second, the mystic oracles seem to yield messages that are ambiguous only because they have nothing to 7Raymond Klibansky, Erwin Panofsky, &amp; Fritz Saxl, Saturn and Melancholy (New York, 1964), p. 321.</page><page sequence="10">202 / VICTORIAN POETRY say. Third, Corinthians' veil of shadows is black (not multicolored as for Shelley) with unmeaning. And finally, Ecclesiastes' exhortation about vanity does not imply the necessity for otherworldliness;it denies the otherworld. In the face of these demonic realities Melencolia sits like a Titaness, "That City's sombre Patroness and Queen" (1. 72), and meanwhile, in the concluding stanza and one of its most famous: The moving moon and stars from east to west Circle before her in the sea of air; Shadows and gleams glide round her solemn rest. Her subjects often gaze up to her there: The strong to drink new strength of iron endurance, The weak new terrors; all, renewed assurance And confirmation of the old despair. (XXI, 78-84) The stars that provide Dante with hope at the end of each book of The Divine Comedy and the cosmic patterning of the heavens yield, in Thomson's final irony, its final paradox, only despair, the final image of the uncaring and mechanistic universe. Melencolia represents for the narrator at the end of his pilgrimage the only way to endure a universe which, though indifferent, nonetheless binds existence with the chains of time. She is herself, in all her strength, too weary to move; but she is sustained by an indomitable will, and it is this which she provides for her subjects. In his trek through the City of Dreadful Night the narrator-pilgrim has come across image after image of eternal, circular motion, from the watch and mill and sphinx of cantos II, VIII, and XX to the circular journeys of the inhabitants in cantos II and XVIII; the narrator has, in addition, presented during his own retracing of his journey in the odd-numbered cantos the mechanistic, non-human "lawless law" of canto III, the cycle of escape and recapture in V, the trudge of the hearse in IX, the circle of Time in XIII, and the nihilistic stars in XVII. So now Melencolia gathers these various images unto herself and gives them definition with her geometric instruments. In that sense she has measured and therefore contains eternity. She and the sphinx of canto XX must face each other for the time of her life, and she must of course then lose; but for the period of her existence she provides partial comfort by providing understanding and definition for the narrator-pilgrim and for Thomson. In reaching Melencolia the narrator has learned to live with the consciousness of death ever on his mind. The process of the pilgrimage has consisted of facing the very worst that can be imagined, not as the nameless fears that create anxiety but as concrete images that can be grasped and possessed. The principle of development of the pilgrimage is the narrator's gradual acceptance of himself as an inhabitant of the City of Dreadful Night. In his reaction to the figure of the Sage, the narrator of The Doom of a City showed himself and hence one part of Thomson in total, shocked recoil to the demonism of the frozen City</page><page sequence="11">PETER C NOEL-BENTLEY 1 203 portrayed in that poem. The translation of the Sage into a female, maternal figure in "A Lady of Sorrow" and finally into Melencolia in "The 'Melencolia' of Albrecht Diirer" indicates Thomson's development towards accepting the demonic world as the ultimate reality of existence. The last appearance of the figure in Thomson's poetry assumes the acceptance of an existential nihilism and addresses itself to the only affirmation possible for Thomson in 1873, the affirmation of endurance. Melencolia, by "Fronting the dreadful mysteries of Time" (XXI, 46), remains unvanquished and undaunted, and thus provides a measure of peace for humankind in a non-moral and nonhuman universe.</page></plain_text>
