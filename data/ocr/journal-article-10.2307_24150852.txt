<plain_text><page sequence="1">RESOURCES / REVIEWS Prepared by The NSTA Teaching Materials Review Committee Chairman, Marjorie H. Gardner The University of Maryland, College Park # Book Reviews Reproduction: An Important Life Function. Harold R. Hungerford. 140pp. $2.25. J. Weston Walch, Box 1075, Portland, Maine 04101. 1966. Although written for general science stu dents in junior high school, this textbook unit could be used both on lower and higher grade levels. There are some excel lent black and white photographs (some of which are not too relevant to the text) and some good line drawings. The two major themes are asexual and sexual reproduction. Parthenogenesis, her maphroditism, alternation of generations in ferns, mutualism, and mutations are briefly discussed. In the appendices are sugges tions for demonstration-type experiments, a discussion of life functions, and a glossary. For the most part, the book is accurate. There are some examples of teleology and anthropomorphism. In places the author seems to be writing for a college-level audi ence, elsewhere for the primary grades; but most of the book is within the reading level of the average junior high school student. A separate 36-page booklet for the teacher is given free with each order of the textbook. This contains notes on each chapter, sug gestions for teaching the material, and other information of value to the teacher.
