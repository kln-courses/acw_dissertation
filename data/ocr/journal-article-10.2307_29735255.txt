Whether pusillanimously, or with courageous discretion, or a bit of both, Paul Muldoon has backed off from an introduction to his anthology often contemporary Irish poets. Instead, he offers a Prologue in the form of a radio debate between F.R. Hig gins and Louis MacNeice, broadcast as long ago as 27 July 1939. Higgins's possibly boastful conviction that there is CA sort of dream that produces a sense of magic5 in Irish poetry conflicts with MacNeice's more modern, rational and in? clusive approach. At times, the conversation verges on the hilarious. Higgins ? T claim that pure poetry comes from Ireland5 ? blows his trumpet like a fairy publicist. The wonder of the incident is that MacNeice kept his patience. It is easy enough, though, to sense the drama that it might be the purpose of the anthology to unfold: I am afraid, Mr MacNeice, you, as an Irishman, cannot escape from your blood, nor from our blood-music that brings the racial character to mind. Irish poetry remains a creation happily, fundamentally rooted in rural civilization, yet aware of and in touch with the element?is of the future. We have seen the drift of English poetry during the past few centuries ? the retreat from the field to the park, from the pavement to the macadamed street, from the human zoological garden to the cinder heap where English verse so pathetically droops today. Aggressively smug as Higgins's ticking-off sounds, MacNeice succeeded in with? standing it, his mind reeling ? it may be imagined ? before the moral, social, and political assumptions in which Higgins's peroration is steeped. CI think one may have such a thing as one's racial blood-music, but that, like one's unconscious, it may be left to take care of itself MacNeice's final answer is, of course, his poetry. Allied to extraordinary psychological insights and effortless, athletic cadences, his plain diction creates an eloquence astonishing in its inventiveness. Northern Irish poets have rescued MacNeice from the torpor of England's modern pantheon, and it seems equally appropriate to claim that John Montague and Seamus Heaney, in different ways, might have revalued Patrick Kavanagh with similar results, that is, restored his poetry when, perhaps, it was in danger of being taken as a standard of ruralism and a source of peasant pastoral. Kavanagh and MacNeice exercise an interesting contrast of influences on recent Irish poetry, although not by any means the only ones. In the different directions they offer, MacNeice and Kavanagh open Irish poetry to a more subtle and intelligent dialogue than 84</page><page sequence="2">Beviews 85 Higgins's carefree insistences. At a time, too, when Irish poets have been more hospitable to influences from abroad, MacNeice, Kavanagh, and the presence of Yeats, Joyce and Beckett in literary awareness, might have had the beneficial effect of creating a post-Modern climate of writing, achieved, as it were, without really trying. Thomas Kinsella, however, is a poet who seems to have felt obliged to make the effort, as if out of sorts with the artistry of his splendid earlier work, and compelled to look for a style more 'contemporary', less identifiably Irish in mind and craft. 'Tao and Unfitness at Inistiogue on the River Nore', for example, strikes me as a poem that has, so to speak, attempted a sort of vanishing trick: it tries, that is, to be a poem about Irish feeling by an imaginary non-Irish writer, or an Irish poet choosing to work without the restraints and formal skills of Irish poetry, for the sake of expansiveness. Sympathy for a poet, anxious to extend his perception and manner of disclosing it, is easily enough mustered. But the writing in 'Tao and Unfitness' is often bad: Inistiogue itself is perfectly lovely, like a typical English villge, but a bit sullen. Our voices echoed in sunny corners among the old houses; we admired the stonework and gateways, the interplay of roofs and angled streets. Admittedly, it is the worst passage in the poem, the writing so slack that it insinuates the possibility that Kinsella is enjoying himself with a parody of summer postcard-ese. But he isn't. This prosaic writing is not rescued for poetry by the obscure spiritual presence of Tao, and its advices, such as ? 'Move, if you move, like water'; 'Respond. Do not interfere. Echo'; 'Be still, as though pure'; 'Be subtle, as though not there'. Lyrical as these directives are, their effect in the poem is less poetic than preposterous. Among trees that are a flitting-place for ragged feeling, old angers and rumours Kinsella detects 'Black and Tan ghosts'. Local people disappear 'into a fifty-year-old night'. Historical pain, turbulence, revenges, and the dispossessed, are sensed and mixed up with soothes from an imported mysticism. Whether this demeans history is up to Irish readers to decide; but, in any case, the poem depends on a conflation of two kinds of seriousness, the life of history and the life of the spirit: in this poem the latter does nothing to illuminate the former, other than tell us that the poet had some kind of 'experience'. If Kinsella's attempt at an exotic or 'modern' Irishism leads to heavy-handed self consciousness, then, in his forced lyricism, John Montague can be seen trying the same thing by different, traditional means. 'The Water Carrier', for example, maunders with an almost banal lack of distinction as it narrates a childhood memory. The polite 'one', where 'you' would do, and T would be better, indicates the dullness of Montague's ear and his carelessness with register, all the more disturbing in that Montague goes out of his way to tell us how peasant-like his beginnings were. Bad writing here is at the service</page><page sequence="3">86 Reviews of proving Montague's authenticity as a rural Irish poet. Nearing its close, the poem tenses itself in readiness to rise above its plain narrative: One stood until the bucket brimmed Inhaling the musty smell of unpicked berries, That heavy greenness fostered by water. Recovering the scene, I had hoped to stylize it, Like the portrait of an Egyptian water-carrier: Yet halt, entranced by slight but memoried life. 'Yet halt' has the ring of the very bad, even if what Montague is recommending to himself is a withdrawal from imagery alien to the honesty of his admission of'slight but memoried life'. In Montague's hesitation, I sense something of the struggles and in? hibitions of recent Irish poetry; for raising the poem into its true significance is what Montague fails to achieve, although 'Yet halt, entranced . . . ' is his statement of inten? ding just that. Instead, he intrudes with the Wordsworthian 'some'. In that little word and its effects, there is a measure of posturing, not j ust the fatigue of an old idiom but the effort to say, the need, somehow, to be imprecise: Not as return or refuge, but some pure thing, Some living source, half-imagined and half-real Pulses in the fictive water that I feel. Not only does the rhyme draw attention to itself in a way that is hardly to its advantage, it exaggerates the feeling, while 'pulses' and 'fictive' inflate the poem, seem willed, or im? ported, the equivalent in language ofthat Egyptian water-carrier in imagery or narrative, or of Kinsella's oriental helpmates. National consciousness in poetry is a controversial topic in Ireland, and in Scotland, too. Muldoon's selection does not include poetry in Irish, or a poet like Michael Hart nett (whose work participates in the controversy, being in both English and Irish), an omission impossible here, if only through the excellence of Sorley Maclean and the Gaelic revival encouraged by his poetry. On this subject, then, the status which Muldoon's book seems to court, that of the-anthology-as-open-debate, is hardly con? clusive. What is it, though, that leads a poet like John Montague to rehash his native creden? tials again and again? To an outsider it looks like insecurity, matched with pride taken to the point of sin: Ancient Ireland, indeed! I was reared by her bedside, The rune and the chant, evil eye and averted head, Fomorian fierceness of family and local feud. It seems to me a fault in a poet capable of the tact of 'A Drink of Milk', 'Tim', the ex? cellent 'A Bright Day', or 'Clear the Way'. In 'A Welcoming Party', he finds it necessary or worthwhile to say, in a poem that evokes a childhood experience of newsreeled hor? rors of war:</page><page sequence="4">Beviews 87 To be always at the periphery of incident Gave my childhood its Irish dimension; Yet doves of mercy, as doves of air, Can falter here as anywhere. It is frankly worrying that a poet should highlight a statement ofthat sort in a poem that encounters a more harrowing and agonizing reality than Ireland's. Pride has got out of hand. Anecdotal parish-poetry (for which, otherwise, there is much good to be said) has triumphed over the modern and post-Modern manners employed in the hope of exten? ding it into and beyond national concerns. An essentially retrospective imagination is seen opting for the past as a preferred present, while at the same time the technique of writing disguises the endeavour as contemporary, critical and forward-looking. These are faults which Irish poets from Michael Longley onwards seem to me, by and large, to avoid, although the exotic plays an important part in Derek Mahon's, Paul Durcan's, and, certainly, in Paul Muldoon's poetry. In some poems, Seamus Heaney's subjects are almost replicas of John Montague's, in that the poem's hero is the poet remembering himself at less than twelve years old. Heaney, though, avoids the modest sensationalism of creating his right to speak as he writes, art assertion of credentials. In 'The Water Carrier', after several readings, you realize that the poetry is in the place. The best line in the poem tells you this ? 'That heavy greenness fostered by water', where the verb has a touch of genius. That is what Heaney concentrates on eliciting, although, in 'Personal Helicon', Heaney, the prober of pools and wells, fails to resist the blan? dishments of self-importance ? Now, to pry into roots, to finger slime, To stare, big-eyed Narcissus, into some spring Is beneath all adult dignity. I rhyme To see myself, to set the darkness echoing. Here, though, the drama of the lyric T is agreeable, if only just. Although influenced by the gentle poetry of Edward Thomas and other English poetry, Michael Longley shows signs everywhere in his work of an Irishness of self as well as of reading and interests, of fact and identity as well as inclination. So far as I can see, he neither goes out of his way to emphasize an Irish sensibility, nor to deny it with a wilfully cosmopolitan range. He is more a poet of The mystical point at which I tire Of Calor gas and a turf fire than he is of 'the sick counties', although his complicated affection for Belfast is a mainstay in his work. Creatures, love, plants, mortality, places, people, are Longley's subjects. His music sounds as natural as it is scrupulous: Straitjacketed by cold and numbskulled Now sleep the welladjusted and the skilled ? The bat folds its wing like a winter leaf, The squirrel in its hollow holds aloof.</page><page sequence="5">88 Reviews More 'clay-sensuous' than Longley, or any other poet of his generation, Heaney ex? emplifies in the one life of writing exactly that dilemma exposed by Muldoon's sly use of his Prologue. Themes that appeal to 'racial blood-music' ? topography, rural detail, childhood, ancestors, ancient history and its violent, topical episodes ? vie with the preferences of an imagination which might be better off were the more formidable dimensions of Irishness to take care of themselves. Only two of the twenty-nine poems by which Heaney is represented come from North, his most accessibly political collection, its sentiments perhaps overtaken in complexity by the elegies in Field Work and Station Island. Yet in Field Work, as well as 'A Postcard from North Antrim' ? affecting in its clashes of the stark with the affectionate, the elegiac with the weirdly ebullient ? there is that suave, guilty poem 'A Dream of Jealousy', and the beautiful 'The Harvest Bow'. It is unsettling to read of the murder that caused 'A Postcard from North Antrim' to be written, and follow it with the cadences and responsive, sensorial phrase-making of'The Harvest Bow': As you plaited the harvest bow You implicated the mellow silence in you In wheat that does not rust But brightens as it tightens twist by twist Into a knowable corona, A throwaway love-knot of straw. Even here, though, strife enters the picture: The end of art is peace Could be the motto of this frail device An object from Ireland's agrarian treasure-house is suggested as an indigenous olive branch, but it is worth noting how often Heaney succeeds elsewhere in creating positive imagery. Early poems like 'The Diviner', 'The Forge', 'Thatcher', and 'The Peninsula' exert their feelings through celebratory impulses. In 'Mossbawn: Two Poems in Dedi? cation', or 'A Drink of Water', the generosity and endearments of feeling seem to come from a different world than the unattractive narrative of Part VII of'Station Island', in which the sectarian shooting of a shopkeeper is described, the victim's story forcing Heaney to say, Forgive the way I have lived indifferent ? forgive my timid circumspect involvement Involved in Heaney's poetry is the rueful conclusion that it is wishful thinking to believe that a poet can live any other way than 'indifferent' or 'circumspect', and wishful thinking for a poet to assume he can get away with it whatever a poet does when he finds himself at what was once described as 'the dark crossroads where literature and politics meet'. Yet that is where Heaney, and Tom Paulin, find themselves, by whatever road they take to get there; and, by means entirely those of intuition, I suspect that it proves Heaney's authenticity as a major poet, Irish or otherwise, and it suggests to me that Tom Paulin is headed towards the same curse or blessing of in tro verted spokesmanship. Their</page><page sequence="6">Beviews 89 sensibilities are such that their times possess them whether they want it or not. Derek Mahon's Parnassian urbanity, mixed with Ulster cheek and poetic rebelliousness, lead him to take a more panoptic view of Ireland, or to be irascible and fiery when up close against some Irish subjects. Much of his work seems almost calculated to provoke the exasperation of patriotic interpreters of poetry. If anything, he has found himself taking MacNeice's themes of individuality and freedom-from-history further than MacNeice. Mahon 's is a poetry of aggravated dreaming, touched by lucidity and by rare, inventive powers, unafraid of imaginative and rhetorical flights. At times its idiom is demotic, but it is as likely to be elegant, or courageous in its anti-materialist perceptions of poetry, and perhaps even the potential of life itself, as above the double crosses and mendacity of the history that poetry cannot help but reflect as the negative side of its euphoria. Paul Durcan's work sometimes suggests the proximity of its concerns to Mahon's: So, in history, the ridge becomes deserted now and then : Right now, just you and me, Ben, and the species. Like Mahon's work, Durcan's is densely populated with the objects and debris of modern life, although when objects are named in Mahon's poetry, such is the im? aginative climate of his writing that they tend to take on lives of their own without the cute processes of anthropomorphism being necessary. The excitable directness of Durcan's poetry is his own style entirely, powerful, eccentric, commanding attention. Classic European history and politics in Tom Paulin 's poetry look like the last refuge of a poet at the end of his tether, tempting fate by looking for real and imaginative solutions in the elements of politics itself. In his earlier work, he observed the society of home, producing lines like 'A silent water beyond society', almost Mahonesque in its depopulation, and ticking off images of spiritual bankruptcy and complacent unyieldingness. This was followed by a more energetic diction, avigpurthat, in 'Songfor February', comes close to a controlled tantrum. It is hard on the ear, and meant to be, a kind of counter-austerity, as in 'Still Century': The hard captains of industry Hold the province in a firm control. Judges, your pious tyranny Is baked bone-dry in the old Bricks of a hundred linen mills, The shadows of black tabernacles. Paulin is the most overtly political poet in the book; but his is a poetry of politics making. Whatever else it is doing, it is not preaching to the converted, who must be few in number, given that the politics he seeks to retrieve are the convictions of the Protes? tant Republicans of the 1790s. In Ireland, as in Scotland, the enterprise is probably too true ever to be much of a vote-catcher. Lyricism is the relief and release of poetry; almost anything can be sung, if the con? ditions are right, given a relative absence of ironies and a degree of certainty in the poet's</page><page sequence="7">90 Reviews mind. Medbh McGuckian is singleminded in her working out of melodic disclosures, although her poems are stronger pictorially than in rhythm. In spite of her disconcerting portrayals of femininity and personal life, in the context of what most Irish poetry invites us to consider, it is tempting to think of her work as pretty pictures. Yet in a world without large-scale affronts and widespread political disorder, this is what more poetry would be like: The studied poverty of a moon roof, The earthenware of dairies cooled by apple trees, The apple tree that makes the whitest wash . . . Coming at the end of the anthology, McGuckian's mysterious phrasings, her poetry's easy imaginativeness, emphasize that other responsibility of poetry, which is towards the beauty of what deserves to be made permanent in verses, given the beauty of the natural world and the designs made by human life. All the poets in this book obey that respon? sibility, and, at times ? with the exception of McGuckian ? they put it to one side to listen to the demands of nationality. It seems to me that Irish poetry has set a competition with itself to discover if both these responsibilities can be obeyed and uttered in the one poem. Or that is what it looks like, for I dare say that the challenge has been posed unconsciously, perhaps even by the sly manoeuvres of history itself. DOUGLAS DUNN</page></plain_text>
