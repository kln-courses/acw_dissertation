The work towards publication has been carried out by a large number of researchers, especially the core staff, which since Shiloh's death has been headed by Alon De Groot. The publication strategy noted in the first volume of the final report (Ariel 1990), which entails publication of units of material as they are completed, has been maintained. Two chapters which were not completed in time to be included in the Environmental Reports part of the second final report (De Groot and Ariel 1992) are now published, completing the reports of that unit. Other elements now included in this volume (for example, the geological report) were originally planned for the last in the series (Volume VII). That volume was expected to contain units unable to fit into the larger volumes which were tó precede it. In the meantime, it was found that these elements conformed to the desired volume size of the series. Moreover, some of the stratigraphical units originally designated for Volume VII were prepared, and found to be too large to be published in what has evolved into this volume. They will now be published as the fourth volume of the final report ( Excavations at the City of David 1978-1985 Directed by Yigal Shiloh , V), which is now planned to include the unit comprising the inscriptions from the City of David (originally Volume VI). By the same strategy, any materials originally designated for Volumes VI and VII and not published in this and the subsequent volume will have to be added to a future volume. In the years following the excavation's last season in 1985 the focus of the City of David project's work has been geared towards the preservation and restoration of the architectural remains at the site and publication of the finds of the excavations. While work towards publication has continued, the preservation and restoration work at the site was ultimately superseded by nationally funded activ- ities, beginning in 1995 and carried out by the Israel Antiquities Authority. Nevertheless, the financial burden of the Society's publication efforts has been maintained through the support of the Kaplan Kushlick Foundation, founded by Mr. Mendel Kaplan of Johannesburg, South Africa. The Jer- usalem Foundation administers the project. Research toward publication has been supervised by the Institute of Archaeology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, which is the trustee of Shiloh's academic estate. Thanks are due to the Institute, now headed by Amihai Mazar, who himself has overseen the publication efforts. The tireless work of the Institute's Qedem monograph series' editorial assistant, Sue Gorodetsky, has been invaluable. Mention should be made here of those who directly contributed to the processing of finds published in this volume, and who are not otherwise thanked in the text. Photographs of the finds were made by Zev Radovan and Ilan Sztulman. The reconstruction of the warp-weighted looms was photographed by Yochai Rosen. The small finds were drawn by Sara Halbreich and Shifra Eisen- stein, except for one item drawn by Ada Yardeni. The plates were prepared by Shifra Eisenstein and J Rosenberg. It should be recalled that a number of conventions - especially with regard to the strati- graphical framework - were detailed in Ariel 1990 (pp. XI-XII). The Preliminary Scheme of Strata established by Shiloh in 1984 was adapted to facilitate the independent publication of volumes of the fiňal report. The numerical scheme of strata based upon periods was maintained, while the meaning of the letters accompanying the stratum numerals in the Preliminary Scheme was modified. Rather than referring to the entire excavation, they have been used in the final reports to refer to area- specific phasing. Correlation between excavation areas is accomplished only within the framework of the ceramic analysis, or in summary chapters. In the first two volumes of the final report we employed the conventions summarized above. The use of a Roman numeral in place of an Arabic numeral indicated that reference is to the correlated phase given in the relevant ceramic report or VI</page><page sequence="4">summary chapter. As of this volume, only the Byzantine (Stratum 3) phases have been correlated. This volume continues those conventions. In the previous volume (De Groot and Ariel 1992) most of the reports focused on finds from the later periods represented in the City of David. In this volume most of the reports concentrate on the major strata from the City of David, those of the Iron Age. Part One contains a report resulting from a thorough geological analysis of the City of David hill, with particular reference to the evolution of the ancient water systems found there. Part Two comprises various reports on the finds of the City of David excavations, reflecting the large range and quantities of finds, particularly from the Israelite period. The core staff is proud that the sheer quantities of certain categories of finds uncovered at the City of David was so great that - coupled with unfailing efforts by excellent specialists - compre- hensive reports are now available for groups of artifacts, some of which are not commonly ad- dressed: ceramic figurines, loomweights and spindle whorls, the groundstone industry, scale weights, flint implements, gems, beads and pendants, and 'Horus Eye' amulets. Included also are two chapters on the faunai remains. D.T. Ariel, A. De Groot VII</page><page sequence="5">LIST OF FIGURES 1 . Map of the City of David and its waterworks (p. 2). 2.

INTRODUCTION The early city of Jerusalem, Canaanite 'Shalem' or 'Yevus' ('Jebus') and later the early Israelite 'City of David,' was built on a narrow, southward-sloping spur of the Temple Mount, flanked on the west by the valley that was later called 'Tyropoeon' and on the east by the Kidron Valley (Fig. 1). The only perennial water source nearby is the Gihon Spring, which issues in a cave on the right bank of the Kidron Valley, at the foot of the eastern slope of the spur. For efficient utilization of the Gihon's waters the ancient inhabitants constructed at various times three water supply systems, today known as the Warren's Shaft Installation, the Siloam Channel and Hezekiah's Tunnel. The Siloam Channel carried artificially raised spring water southward alongside the right bank of the Kidron Valley; the other two systems are entirely subterranean. Detailed descrip- tions of the waterworks can be found in Conder (1882), Vincent (1911), Simons (1952), Kenyon (1967) and Shiloh (1981; 1984). The subterranean water supply systems of the City of David are among the most impressive engineering accomplishments of the biblical period. Nevertheless, they display many seemingly trivial planning mistakes and numerous apparent blunders in construction. These imperfections have puzzled scholars ever since the waterworks were rediscov- ered in the mid- 19th century, and many attempts have been made to account for them (e.g. Conder 1882; Clermont-Ganneau 1897; Vincent 1911; Sul- ley 1929; Simons 1952; Hecker 1956; Amiran 1968; 1976; Issar 1976). Recently (Gill 1991; 1994a), I have presented evidence to show that the water- works were fashioned along the pre-existing tracks of a natural karst system of shafts and conduits which were formed by dissolution of the limestones and dolomites upon which Jerusalem is built. In those articles the geology of the site was described only briefly. This study presents a fuller account of various geological aspects which are important for understanding the design and construction of the waterworks. In order to evaluate the relationship between the water supply systems and the geology, the latter must be known and documented in sufficient detail, on a scale which is compatible with the size of the waterworks. The geological information about the area provided by earlier studies is not detailed enough for this purpose (see below). Thus, for this evaluation the vertical rock succession was divided into mappable rock units in the most detailed way possible, and a new geological map of the area was prepared, depicting the distribution of these units and the position of faults. The new map, together with the columnar stratigraphie section, provide a definitive three-dimensional picture of the surface and subsurface geology of southeastern Jerusalem. They document the geological setting of the water- works and thus enable the examination of any hypothesis about the relations between the water- 1</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 1. Map of the City of David and its waterworks. works and the underlying geology. In addition, the local geology and the geology of correlative rock units in the vicinity were studied in order to collect additional pertinent geological information that may shed light on the design and construction of the waterworks. PREVIOUS GEOLOGICAL STUDIES A chronological review of geological investigations of Jerusalem and its environs reflects the beginning and development of the geological profession in Israel. The earliest studies were conducted by Fraas (1867) and Blanckenhorn (1905). They were fol- lowed by Shalem (1925; 1927; 1928), Blake (1936), Picard (1938a; 1956), Bentor (1945) and Avnimelech (1951; 1968). These authors studied the stratigra- phy, lithology and paleontology of Jerusalem and its vicinity and laid the foundations for more detailed later investigations. Several geological maps of Jerusalem have been published in the past, though none are sufficiently fine-scaled for the study of the waterworks. The maps by Blancken- horn (1905; also presented in Vincent 1912) and Picard (1956) do not portray the local geology of the City of David adequately (see below). Israeli's (1977) map does not cover the City of David, and the map by Arkin et al. (1976) lacks the strati- graphic resolution that is needed in order to portray the lithological differences which exist in the area of interest. Therefore, a more detailed geological map of the City of David area had to be prepared. STRATIGRAPHY AND STRATIGRAPHIC NOMENCLATURE The bedrock exposed in Jerusalem and its vicinity consists of limestone, dolomite and chalk strata of Late Cretaceous age. Two stratigraphie groups are distinguished, the Judea Group, of Albian to Turonian age, and the Mount Scopus Group, of Senonian age. Fig. 2 shows a representative columnar section of the rock sequence and its formal subdivision into finer rock units. The subdivision into the Weradim, Bina and Menuha Formations follows the formal regional strati- graphic nomenclature proposed by Arkin et al. (1965). To provide a faithful reflection of the lithological variations which are of interest to the present study, the rock column has been further subdivided, applying the local rock unit names that were used by Picard (1938a; 1956). The Mizzi Yahudi is equivalent to the Weradim Formation. The Mizzi Ahmar, Meleke and Mizzi Hilu are the three subunits of the Bina Formation. The Ka'akuhle forms the lower part of the Menuha Formation. The Arabic names applied to these units are adaptations of stonemasons' terms, which did not originally signify any stratigraphie position or status (for further details, see Blake 1936; Picard 1938b; Bentor 1960; Perath 1984). 'Mizzi' denotes a hard rock; 'yahudi' means Jewish; 'ahmar' means red; 2</page><page sequence="10">Fig. 2. Stratigraphie column of the Cenomanian to Senonian strata exposed in Jerusalem and surroundings, and their subdivision into lithostratigraphic units. 'meleke' means rayai; 'hilu' means sweet, meant in a complimentary sense; and 'Ka'akuhle' is a general term for dressable hard chalk or chalky limestone. Mizzi Yahudi ('Jewish hard stone') was presumably so named because the Jewish builders of the turn of the century, who introduced modern quarrying techniques, were the first to utilize this rather hard stone for masonry and concrete. Another version relates the name to the hardness of the rock, which is likened in uncomplimentary fashion to Jewish stubbornness and tenacity. Mizzi Ahmar designates a hard reddish rock. Mizzi Hilu, meaning 'sweet (beautiful) hard stone' is, presumably, a compli- mentary term, probably referring to its pleasing appearance and frequent decorative role in build- ings. To stonemasons, the term Meleke designates a hard white stone. This rock type is quite abundant in the middle parts of the Judea Group, below the Weradim Formation. Curiously, the Turonian Meleke in Jerusalem does not meet these specifica- tions, being a rather soft and porous rock. It was used extensively throughout history for large foundations and fortifications. Huge ashlar blocks, some weighing two to three hundred tons, used by King Herod in the 1st century BCE to build the retaining walls of the Temple Mount (see Ritmeyer and Ritmeyer 1989 and Warszawski and Peretz 1992 for recent discussions) were quarried from this formation, as were many of the stones used by the 16th century Ottoman emperor Suleiman the Magnificent to build the walls of Jerusalem. As such, it served royal structures, and this may explain the origin of the name. In many instances, the walls of the ancient stone quarries were subsequently plastered and the hollowed-out spaces were used as 3 S CO o "J &gt;- S C/D O S &gt;- CD £ C/D O SS S CD o a 2 *£ o DESCRIPTION LU O OC - CD - 7e CS CC o 31 oZ £z &lt;£ CD u_ h- -i ID _i - ã. «[ white chalk, biomicrite, planktonic foraminifera .1 J ■§ 1Q0 j-' and coccolith ooze, soft I = 1 s 1Q0 «s ! s s s Ka'akuhle « [ white indurated chalk with red hematitic stains S? ¡'J yellowish-white biomicritic limestone, abundant 1 J 1 y1 c benthonic foraminifera (Milliolidea), dense, hard, = 60- Mizzi Hilu i «il] well-bedded, 20-70 cm. beds i 90 'i ? i w 10- Meleke mil I ' -4 white (grey weathering) biosparitic limestone with a 94 10- mil Meleke ^ rudistids and bivalves, high moldic porosity, thick m i.i c' massive bedding, cliff-forming, cavernous n 03 &lt;3 - n 7 - hb / / hb ' /, / / / ?' ¿n. /o J , yellowish-cream and light grey dolomite with red stains, = 0Q Mizzi Ahmar / ļļ/T fine crystalline, rare pellets and bivalves, dense, hard, ■| ~7/uT impervious, thick beds, cliff-forming, karst features I (-r-L / «»/' O 7 (-r-L 1 " s = E ' 7 / / ' / " = E / / U / - L ) '■% 25- ... . u . .. / v, A grey dolomite, coarse crystalline, dense, hard, '■% J 1Q0 ...

Furthermore, because of its softness and massive bedding, the Meleke strata were sought after in ancient times as a preferred formation for the hewing of monumental tombs (see below). This may be another reason for naming the unit 'royal.' Blanckenhorn (1905: 87), who was aware of this characteristic of the Meleke, aptly proposed that the unit be named 'Graberfels' (in German) or 'sepulchral rock.' In Jerusalem and its vicinity, these different types of building stones are found in different strati- graphic horizons, and they coincide with a natural subdivision of the sedimentary sequence into well- defined rock units. These units have very distinctive lithologies and a characteristic appearance in the landscape. Therefore, this division and nomencla- ture is also well suited for lithostratigraphic classification and mapping purposes; this is the division used here. Thus, the units shown in the geological map (Fig. 3) are the three subunits of the Bina Formation (marked MA, M and MH), the Menuha Formation (marked Me) and an additional unit, the Mishash Formation (marked Mi), consist- ing of bedded chert, which overlies the Menuha Formation in the Mount of Offense above the village of Silwan. The Weradim Formation (Mizzi Yahudi) crops out in the western parts of Jerusalem, west of the area included in the geological map. The Menuha Formation is exposed in the southern and eastern parts of the mapped area, and is widespread further to the east throughout the Judean Desert. The unit which is of principal interest to the present study is the Bina Formation, which underlies the Old City of Jerusalem and its immediate surround- ings. We shall be concerned in particular with its two lower members, the Mizzi Ahmar and the Meleke, since they are the formations that form the bedrock and the shallow underground in the City of David. The Mizzi Hilu is exposed along the western slope of the Mount of Olives, south of the cliffs of the Ben Hinnom Valley, and it caps the Temple Mount. GEOLOGICAL SETTING The Judea and Samaria Mountains are a prominent mountain chain which extend from north to south along the central part of Israel. Their crestline is the principal water divide between the Mediterranean and the Jordan Rift Valley. Structurally, the range is an anticlinorium consisting of a number of indivi- dual structures. The city of Jerusalem, at an elevation of about 750 m, is located in a structural saddle at the center of the range, between the southern plunge of the Ramallah anticline and the northern plunge of the Hebron anticline, which is offset to the east of the former by some 10 km (Rot 1972; Shaliv 1980: Fig. 4). Structurally, the spur of the City of David is situated on the eastern flank of the Ramallah anticline. The geological makeup of the area is shown in the geological outcrop map (Fig. 3) and the E-W geological cross-section (Fig. 4). Structurally, the spur of the City of David is a step-faulted block in which the strata dip to the southeast (azimuth N140E) with inclinations of 10-15°. The surface consists of Mizzi Ahmar, exposed along the lower eastern slope of the spur, and of Meleke, exposed on the upper slopes and the crest. The boundary between these rock units is visible, running N-S along the center of the eastern slope. Two groups of small faults, with vertical displacements of 20-30 meters, pass through the area: one strikes about N15E and the other about N105E. In the first group downfaulting is to the east, while in the second it is to the south. Both the Kidron and the Tyropoeon Valleys are superimposed on north-trending faults. Of the west-trending faults, two cross the Mount of Offense east of the Kidron Valley in the center of the village of Silwan. A third fault passes south of the spur, along the lower bend of the Ben Hinnom Valley. Joints and fractures are common, showing two dominant orientations, roughly N-S and approximately E-W. Both systems are essentially vertical. GEOLOGICAL SETTING OF THE ANCIENT WATERWORKS The location of the waterworks relative to the bedrock units is shown in the geological cross- section (Fig. 4), and in greater detail in Fig. 5. The steep tunnel and the upper part of the dead-end shaft are within the Meleke. The boundary between the Meleke and the Mizzi Ahmar is at the bottom of the scarp. This boundary is marked clearly all along the walls of the inclined tunnel (Photo 1), visible as an abrupt change in both color and surface texture. The Meleke, which forms the ceiling and upper part of the walls, has a lighter hue and an irregular surface, indented by irregular cavities. In contrast, the Mizzi Ahmar, in the floor and lower part of the 4</page><page sequence="12">Fig. 3. Geological map of southeastern Jerusalem. 1. Old City of Jerusalem; 2. Temple Mount; 3.

The passage, today blocked, that leads out to the eastern slope was created by the coalescence of natural caves in the bottom part of the Meleke, along its contact with the underlying Mizzi Ahmar, which forms their floor. The inclined tunnel cuts progressively deeper into the Mizzi Ahmar as it descends eastward. The top of Warren's Shaft is 4.25 m below the top of the Mizzi Ahmar (Photo 2).

Photos 1 and 2 also demonstrate that the dimensions of the tunnel, which reaches a height of 6.3 m and is 4 to 6 m wide, are much too large for the minimum needed for carrying water, even in vessels on the head. If the tunnel was deliberately planned in this way, it would have involved an immense amount of superfluous hewing for no practical reason and no obvious benefit. Photo 1. Looking north along the inclined tunnel in the upper level of the Warren's Shaft Installation. The horizontal line in the middle of the side walls marks the contact between the dark-colored, hard Mizzi Ahmar below the line, and the white cavernous Meleke above the line. Note the excessive spaciousness of the tunnel (AF). All the remaining elements of the waterworks are within the Mizzi Ahmar. This includes the bottom half of the dead-end shaft and the entire length of Warren's Shaft. Likewise, the Gihon Spring and the entire length of Hezekiah's Tunnel are within the Mizzi Ahmar. Photo 2. The upper opening of Warren's Shaft. The approach to the shaft is extremely inconvenient and dangerous. Water can be drawn only while standing on a platform above the center of the shaft. It is unlikely that a well would be so crude in construction.

The rock is very dense and hard, pinkish-gray to yellowish-cream on fresh fractures. Irregular reddish-brown patches and thin red streaks are abundant and conspicuous, hence the name 'ahmar' (Arabic for red). Microscopically the rock consists of a homogeneous, dense mosaic of subhedral to euhedral dolomite crystals, about 40 microns in size (Photo 3). The rock is devoid of any remains of fossil fragments. Ghosts of well-rounded micritic pellets are occasionally abundant. The rock appears to be impervious, without any visible porosity of any kind. Petrophysical analyses of six samples from the eastern slope of the spur measured porosities of 1.36% to 4.54%, with an average of 2.64%, and permeabilities of 0.04 to 0.49 milli- darcies, with a mean of 0.13 md. Photo 3. Micro texture of the Mizzi Ahmar: a dense mosaic of euhedral to subhedral dolomite crystals, about 40 microns in size. The rock lacks porosity and is practically impervious (DG). Meleke The Meleke is a fossiliferous limestone that has undergone diagenetic alterations. In pétrographie terms it is a biosparite or skeletal grainstone (Photo 4). Fossil fragments comprise about 30% of the rock. The skeletal grains, poorly sorted and angular, range in size from 0.1 mm to 1 mm. The fossil assemblage includes several species of rudistids, bivalves and some corals (Blanckenhorn 1905: 90; Picard 1938a). The original matrix consisted of very fine-grained and dense lime-mud (micrite), parts of Photo 4. Micro texture of the Meleke: abundant fossil fragments (white grains) in a microcrystalline matrix (dark grey material). The rock is very porous (black voids) due to the dissolution of fossil fragments (DG). which have recrystallized into a dense mosaic of anhedral calcite crystals, mostly less than 10 microns in size. The degree of matrix recrystalliza- tion determines the hardness of the rock, its resistance to weathering and its overall appearance in the field. Where the recrystallization is more pervasive, the matrix consists of a mosaic of closely interlocking, large subhedral crystals. Average crystal size is about 50 microns, reaching up to 0.2 mm. Rock of this texture is cliff-forming. The Meleke is very porous and permeable. Its vugular nature is conspicuous both in hand speci- mens and thin sections. The porosity was created by the dissolution and leaching of fossil fragments, most likely by fresh groundwater. Petrophysical analyses of the more porous variety (four samples taken in tombs within the City of David) measured porosities of 28.6% to 33.1%, with an average of 30.2%, and permeabilities of 50 to 319 md, with an average of 135 md. Mizzi Hilu The Mizzi Hilu is a fine crystalline limestone with abundant remains of foraminifera (mostly Milioli- dea) and other microfossils (foraminiferal biomi- crite). It is even-textured, with a uniform creamy- white color that hardly weathers. The rock is very dense, often almost lithographic, and contains abundant stylolites. In every aspect - field appear- ance, as well as in hand specimens and microfacies - it is very different from the other two members of the Bina Formation (Photo 5). 8</page><page sequence="16">Photo 5. Micro texture of the Mizzi Hilu: abundant foraminifera (miliolidea) cemented by very fine crystalline calcite (DG). MORPHOLOGY AND KARST FEATURES OF THE BINA FORMATION Mizzi Ahmar The Mizzi Ahmar is the lowermost unit exposed in the map area. Its more conspicuous exposures are the vertical cliffs of the Ben Hinnom Valley and the bowl of Birket es-Sultan further upstream. To the north and west it underlies much of modern Jerusalem (see geological maps in Picard 1956 and particularly Israeli 1977). The unit is thickly stratified with marly interlayers that weather to terra rossa soil. Karst features are common throughout the unit. A small cave is found on the left bank of the Ben Hinnom Valley, opposite the Cinematheque Thea- ter. Jerusalem water well No. 4, located in the Ben Hinnom Valley, encountered loss of circulation in the Mizzi Ahmar section, indicating a cavernous zone in the subsurface. In the built-up area of modern Jerusalem natural exposures of the Mizzi Ahmar have become rather scarce. However, in the process of excavating and ground leveling for new building, quite extensive temporary exposures be- come available for study. These, to mention only the larger ones, include the Wolfson-Megiddo Towers complex on President Ben Zvi Boulevard, the Ministry of Education and Culture building in Debora Street, the Zion Square office building, the underground car park at the southern end of Yoel Salomon Street, a large pit at the corner of Yaffo and Sarei Yisrael Streets, the new Jerusalem Municipality near the Russian Compound, a build- ing project in the Schneller Compound, and the Supreme Court building on Giv'at Ram. All these sites display abundant karstie dissolution and weathering features in the Mizzi Ahmar. The Mizzi Ahmar does not contain large caves. The main karstie features are irregular dissolution cavities which are filled with dark brown terra rossa. In several sites, well-defined vertical dissolution shafts have been observed, which are filled with terra rossa and unsorted, angular rock debris. The rock surface cleared by Shiloh's excavation in Area E (in the lower part of the eastern slope of the spur) displays many small-scale dissolution marks. In one place a small irregular sinkhole, about one meter in diameter and four meters deep, was exposed. Meleke The Meleke is widespread throughout the mapped area. It occurs as thick, massively bedded strata, forming high ledges and vertical cliffs that are sometimes prominent in the landscape. When freshly cut the rock is stark white, darkening slightly upon weathering. The unit varies in thickness from 10 m in the southern part of the mapped area to 24 m in its center. For the most part, its contacts with the Mizzi Ahmar and the Mizzi Hilu are abrupt and conformable. Along the Kidron Valley and on the western slope of Mount Zion, the transition from the Mizzi Ahmar to the Meleke is gradual over a vertical interval of 1-2 m, which is composed of dolomitic limestone. Most notable among the Meleke outcrops is the vertical cliff on the left bank of the Kidron Valley, partly within the village of Silwan and further to the north. The famous sepulchral monuments of the Second Temple period (the so-called cenotaph of Absalom and the tombs of Benei Hezir, Zachariah and Yehoshafat) are all hewn in this cliff, as are also smaller burial caves from the First Temple period found in Silwan village (see Ussishkin 1993). Meleke is also exposed along the right bank of the Ben Hinnom Valley. Here it is only about 10 m thick and contains numerous natural caves, some of which served as tombs. Particularly large caves are found near and in the monastery of Haqal Dama (Aceldama), near the confluence of the Ben Hinnom and Kidron Valleys. In some areas, the contact between the Meleke and the overlying Mizzi Hilu is very irregular. At these localities, large detached blocks of thinly- 9</page><page sequence="17">bedded Mizzi Hilu appear to have slid into pits and irregular depressions within the Meleke. These features mark post-depositional events in which blocks of already consolidated and lithified Mizzi Hilu collapsed into sinkholes formed by dissolution in the upper part of the Meleke. This phenomenon is well developed in the sunken courtyard of the Tomb of the Kings and at the base of the Herodian staircase which leads to the Double Gate in the southern wall of the Temple Mount. Other historical monuments where the Meleke is well exposed include: 1. Burial caves of the First Temple period at Ketef Hinnom, adjacent to St. Andrew's Presbyter- ian Church (near the Khan Theater). 2. The foundation of the Turkish city wall, between Jaffa Gate and Mt. Zion. 3. Tombs on Mt. Zion. 4. Cisterns and ancient cellars at St. Peter in Gallicantu, on the eastern slope of Mt. Zion. 5. Rock-hewn galleries in the southeastern part of the City of David (at one time thought to be the tombs of the Davidic Dynasty or the Royal Necropolis of the Kings of Judah). 6. Cisterns on the slope south of the Double Gate in the Ophel Archaeological Park. 7. The Church and Tomb of the Virgin Mary and the Grotto of Gethsemane in the Kidron Valley. 8. The Pool of Bethesda (Piscina Probatica) at St. Anna's Church in the Muslim Quarter. 9. The roofed cisterns (Struthion) under the convent of the Sisters of Zion, originally the north moat of the Antonia Fortress. 10. The lower part of the Hasmonean (?) water conduit that runs from the Struthion cisterns to the Temple Mount. This conduit was excavated from the surface down, mostly through Mizzi Hilu. 1 1 . The underground northwestern corner of the retaining walls of the Herodian Temple Mount platform. This is an artificial scarp, lately excavated (the 'Kotel tunnel'). It is hewn in the same ashlar pattern as the entire western wall that stands on it. Adjacent to it lies an ancient stone quarry of Meleke building stones. 12. The scarp on which the Omaria School is built, north of the Haram al-Sharif. 13. Zedekiah's Cave (or Solomon's Quarries) east of the Damascus Gate, which is an ancient quarry. Its proximal part is in Mizzi Hilu, and in its distal parts one can see some of the best non-weathered exposures of Meleke in Jerusalem. 14. Bedrock exposures along the western side of the Byzantine Cardo of Jerusalem are mostly in the uppermost part of the Meleke. 15. The foundations of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre are in the Turonian Bina Formation. The formation that forms the ground surface of the church compound is the Mizzi Hilu. Excellent Meleke exposures, 13 m high, are found in the rear parts of the church, in the Chapel of St. Vartan and the Chapel of the Cross. The chapels are within a stone quarry, thought to have been excavated at the time of the First Temple (Broshi and Barkay 1985; Barkay 1985). Here the contact between the Mizzi Hilu and the Meleke is unconformable. In the southeastern corner of St. Vartan's Chapel there is a dissolution shaft in the Mizzi Hilu. The cisterns under the 'Convent of Abraham,' in the southern part of the church compound, are hewn in Meleke. 16. The 'Garden Tomb' and the First Temple period tombs in the grounds of the nearby Ecole Biblique on Nablus Road; Father L.H. Vincent (1872-1960) was buried in the adjoining chapel. 17. The 'Tombs of the Sanhédrin' in the Ramat Eshkol suburb. 18. The 1st century mausoleum of Queen Helena of Adiabene in Salah ed-Din Street north of the Old City (commonly referred to as the 'Tombs of the Kings'). Mizzi Hilu Unlike the Mizzi Ahmar and the Meleke, the Mizzi Hilu is a well-bedded unit with beds 30-70 cm thick. Typical outcrops run along Sultan Suleiman Road, east of the Damascus Gate, where this unit forms the foundation of the northern part of the Ottoman city wall. Well-exposed sections of the unit are found along the southern segment of the Herodian Temple Mount platform. The monumental staircase that led into the Double and Triple Hulda Gates in the southern wall was built on this unit. As mentioned above, the Hasmonean water conduit that runs from the Struthion pools to the Temple Mount was dug mostly in Mizzi Hilu. This unit has a very special distinction in that it forms the bedrock where some of the most venerated shrines to both Christianity and Islam are located. It crops out at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre as the rock of Calvary (Golgotha, the traditional site of the Crucifixion). Although the bedrock at the tomb of Jesus cannot be observed, it appears that this shrine, 10</page><page sequence="18">which is situated nearby, is also founded in the Mizzi Hilu. The bedrock on top of Mount Moriah, the Temple Mount compound, also consists of this unit. Hence, the rocky floor of natural bedrock, the centerpiece of the Dome of the Rock, known to Jews as the Foundation Stone, consists of Mizzi Hilu. Natural caves or other large-scale karst features are not typical of this unit, although dissolution pipes (as in the Chapel of St. Vartan) are occasionally found. The Mizzi Hilu contains in places intra-formational karstie dissolution cavities which were filled by fluvial sands (Weiler 1966; Weiler and Sass 1972; Sandler and Zilberman 1985). GEOLOGICAL HISTORY OF KARST DEVELOPMENT IN ISRAEL Carbonate minerals (calcite and dolomite) are susceptible to chemical dissolution by circulating groundwater. With sufficient rainfall and a suitable hydrogeological setup, carbonate formations are prone to the development of cavernous karstie dissolution networks and their attendant reprecipi- tation products (for recent comprehensive treat- ments of this broad subject see, for example, Burger and Dubertret 1975; Bogli 1980; Jennings 1985; Dreybrodt 1988; Ford and Williams 1989). All the ingredients for the evolution of mature karst systems are present in Israel. The mountai- nous parts of Israel are built of carbonate forma- tions (the Judea Group of Cretaceous age). The country was affected by several phases of tectonic stress that fractured and jointed the rocks (e.g., Eyal and Reches 1983), setting up the pattern for dissolution by groundwater. The calcareous forma- tions have repeatedly been subjected to dissolution by groundwater for geologically long periods since the end of the Turonian (e.g., Buchbinder et al. 1983). The intensity of these processes, and the depth to which they reached, have been increased by the morphotectonic changes that have affected the region since the Neogene, and especially the Pliocene, which shaped the present physiography and landscape of the terrain. The main changes entailed the upwarping of the central parts of the country into mountain ranges, the formation of the Jordan Rift Valley in the east, and the frequent sea level changes of the Paratethys Ocean (the precursor of the Mediterranean) in the west, culminating in the Messinian 'salinity crisis' and desiccation of the Mediterranean Sea. The newly elevated highlands, coupled with a lowering of the erosion base levels on either side of the water divide, created steep hydraulic gradients and induced the development of a new hydrodynamic regime that exposed deep- lying strata to the effects of groundwater flow, rejuvenating old subsurface drainage systems and creating new ones (e.g., Kafri and Arad 1978). Karst formation was further enhanced by higher rainfall during the pluvial interludes of the Pleisto- cene (Horowitz 1979). Thus, the carbonate formations in Israel, and the Judea Group in particular, were affected by karst- forming processes during at least three periods: Late Turonian (90 my), Late Miocene (6.5 my) and Pliocene to Pleistocene (5.0 to 0.01 my). In the northern part of Israel, where precipitation exceeds 750 mm per year, karst processes are still active today (e.g., Horowitz 1979: 161-66). It should, therefore, come as no surprise that certain forma- tions of the Judea Group are intensely karstifled both in outcrops and especially in the subsurface. In fact, karst is a second nature to most formations in the Judea Group. KARST IN JUDEA AND SAMARIA Karst in the Judea Group west of the water divide in the central part of the Judea Mountains has been described by Arkin (1980) and by Michaelson and Movshovitz (1980). The outcrops that are affected by karst belong to the Aminadav, Weradim and Bina Formations. The largest caves in the area are in the Weradim Formation: these includes the picturesque Avshalom Cave in Nahal Soreq (Bar- Matthews et al. 1991), and the Cave of the Twins and Shimshon Cave near the town of Beth Shemesh. East of thie water divide the karst features are even more pronounced. Here, especially in the southern parts of Samaria and the northern parts of Judea, are found some of the largest caves in the country. In southern Samaria, a concentration of large caves is found in Nahal Daliya (Frumkin 1981a; 1981b) and in Wadi Makkuk (Tsuk 1983; Frumkin 1988a; 1988b; Begin 1988). All the caves in these two ephemeral streams are in the Shivta Formation, which is stratigraphically equivalent to the Meleke unit in Jerusalem. In northern Judea, large caves are found in Nahal Teqo'a near Herodion (Frumkin 1986a; 1986b). Among them is the Hareitun Cave, one of the longest caves in the 11</page><page sequence="19">country. This cave has 55 large galleries; it spreads vertically over four distinct levels, and the total length of its labyrinthine passageways and corridors is about four kilometers (Strobel 1967; Mann 1976). The different levels are interconnected by dissolu- tion shafts which in origin, and often also in their shape and dimensions, are very similar to Warren's Shaft in Jerusalem. All the aforementioned caves are in the Shivta Formation which, as mentioned above, is equivalent to the Meleke unit in Jerusalem. Numerous caves in the Shivta Formation are found in the ephemeral stream gorges of the Judean Desert. In Samaria, large vertical dissolution shafts are also well developed in the Aminadav Formation, below the Shivta Formation, which overlies the Motsa Marl aquiclude (Frumkin 1984). The intense karstification of the formations is manifested by their hydraulic characteristics and by the overall hydrology of the carbonate aquifers of the Judea Group. Water from karst aquifers accounts for about 70% of the total water supply of Israel (Mandel 1961; Gvirtzman 1994; Schwarz 1994; Weinberger et al. 1994). The regional hydro- geological situation of the eastern watershed drai- nage system has been described in several studies (e.g., Rofe and Raffety 1963; 1965; Shaliv 1980; Gvirtzman 1994; Scarpa 1994). Recent studies utilizing modern isotopie age determination and geochemical water-type fingerprinting methods have made it possible to identify water bodies and trace their movement in space and time (Rosenthal 1978; Rosenthal and Kronfeld 1982; Kroitoru et al. 1985; Kroitoru 1987; Kroitoru et al. 1992). Data are available for the uppermost aquifer of the Judea Group, which consists of the Weradim, Shivta and Netzer Formations (equivalent to the Weradim, Meleke and Mizzi Hilu in Jerusalem). This aquifer is characterized by high hydraulic conductivities and consequent high flow velocities, on the order of 1.2- 1.5 km per year (Kroitoru et al. 1985). The aquifer carries contemporary water, as determined by the presence of 'post-bomb' tritium, which indicates that at least part of the water entered the system after 1953. The residence time of the waters in the aquifer is very short and their chemical interaction with the host rock is negligible. As a result, the water is almost fresh, with only about 10 meq/1 total dissolved ions and less than 1 meq/1 (about 25 mg/1) of chloride (Kroitoru et al. 1985; Kroitoru 1987). These findings point to a well-developed network of interconnected conduits, which characterize mature karst systems. STYLES OF KARST DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIZZI AHMAR AND THE MELEKE The pétrographie and petrophysical properties of the Meleke and the Mizzi Ahmar determine their permeability to water and, consequently, the style of karst that will develop in each unit. The fact that the two units possess very different petrophysical properties and that they are juxtaposed vertically determines the style of the karst that will develop in the combined sequence. The carbonate skeletal grains of the Meleke dissolve more readily than the fine-grained (micritic) matrix, leaving a network of partly connected voids. Water moves easily in all directions within this porous and permeable unit. In contrast, the under- lying Mizzi Ahmar is impervious, obstructing the downward percolation of water. Consequently, water that reaches the base of the Meleke cannot move further down, and is forced to continue its flow along the boundary between the two forma- tions. This enhances dissolution in the lower part of the already porous Meleke, leading to the develop- ment of caves above the contact between the two units. A change in the overall hydraulic regime, such as a lowering of the regional drainage base level or tectonic tilting, sets up new steep hydraulic gradi- ents and lowers the regional water table, thereby exposing previous water-saturated phreatic strata to the enhanced dissolution processes of the vadose zone environment. Upon encountering impervious strata in the vadose zone the water creates new passageways by dissolving the rock. Preferred sites for initial dissolution are surfaces and partings of sedimentary and tectonic origin, such as bedding planes, faults and joints. Such natural partings, especially if caused by tectonic shear, often become filled with crushed material that is much more permeable than the enclosing bedrock. Once an initial passageway has been dissolved, it will attract more water and be continuously enlarged. Thus, in an impervious carbonate unit like the Mizzi Ahmar, the karst features that are more likely to develop are vertical dissolution shafts ('domepits'), which may form along faults and joint systems, and narrow, well-defined irregular conduits along anastomosing joints and fissure systems. 12</page><page sequence="20">KARST PHENOMENA IN THE JERUSALEM WATERWORKS Karstie dissolution features on various scales are ubiquitous and pervasive throughout the water- works. The more conspicuous ones were already very lucidly described by Vincent (1911). Terms like caves, cavities, fissures, cavernous limestone, calcar- eous accretions, concretions a$d encrustations, with or without the adjective 'natural,' are common throughout his narrative. In the following para- graphs only the most conspicuous larger features are described, often making use of Vincent's impeccable account, which can hardly be improved upon. In addition, attention is drawn in passing to seemingly anomalous features and other enigmatic questions concerning the construction of the water- works which are also adequately accounted for by the karst thesis.

The natural cave that forms the water chamber at the bottom of Warren's Shaft. Note the fissure across the floor. The scale bar is graduated at 10 cm intervals (IH). Warren's Shaft Installation Warren's Shaft is a natural dissolution shaft, as is evident from its irregular shape (Fig. 6; Photo 6), the absence of hewing marks on its walls and the antiquity of the calcareous crusts lining its walls. The shaft is 'an oval cylinder... it is crooked, between its two extremes it is very uneven, and some of the sections are yet even more irregular... the oval is rectilinear in no place... it narrows down and expands, now on one side, now on the other, it is adorned with protuberances or cavities... The incrustation on the sides here is exactly the same as in shaft B [the dead-end shaft - D.G.]' (Vincent 1911: 13). The shaft developed along a natural joint striking N70E, which is visible along its entire length and especially on the floor of the water chamber, at the base of the shaft (Photo 7). The water chamber at the base of the shaft is described 13</page><page sequence="21">Fig. 6. Profiles of Warren's Shaft. Scale bar at right marks absolute elevation in meters above se| level.

C: NW-SE profile. Note the very irregular shape of the shaft's walls. The height of the shaft above the floor of the passage that leads to the Gihon is 12.3 m. The natural end of the shaft is 2.8 m below the floor level of Hezekiah's Tunnel. by Vincent as 'a rather roomy natural cave' (Vincent 1911: 10, 14). Removal of accumulated mud by Shiloh's expedition revealed that the shaft extends for an additional 2.80 m below the floor of Hezekiah's Tunnel, ending in a blind funnel (Fig. 6; Photo 8). The extension is offset some 3 m to the east of the bottom of Warren's Shaft. Its walls are irregular and rough without any signs of hewing, and it looks in every respect like a natural feature. As in the case of all the many other apparent design anomalies, here too it is unlikely that this unneces- sary prolongation of the shaft was constructed by design. A characteristic feature of natural caves is the calcareous crusts on their walls. These crusts are referred to variously as travertine, cave deposits, 14</page><page sequence="22">dripstone or speleothems. The formation of the crusts is due to a reversal of the chemical reaction which causes carbonate dissolution. Water percolat- ing through organic-rich soils becomes enriched in carbonic acid and has the power to dissolve calcium carbonate. When such carbonate-saturated water enters an open cave environment where the con- centration (partial pressure) of gaseous C02 is lower than in the solution, a solid mineral phase of calcium carbonate (calcite) will precipitate out of the solution and crystallize as a thin crust. The solution can also become supersaturated through loss of water by evaporation. If the water flows along a stalactite or along the cave walls, the latter will be encrusted. Crusts appear in different shapes and forms. Microscopically, they display a char- acteristic crystal structure and mode of growth. Calcitic crusts typical of limestone caves are found along the entire length of Warren's Shaft. The commonest form is an undulating layer some 1-3 cm thick (Photo 9). Microscopically examined Photo 8. The natural termination of Warren's Shaft 2.8 m below the floor level of Hezekiah's tunnel. Note the calcareous crusts on the walls (IH). Photo 9. Calcareous crusts and cave deposits in Warren s Shaft (DG). in thin section, it appears to consist of very coarse crystals of calcite growing perpendicular to the walls (Photo 10) - the usual mode of crystal growth into unconfined open space. More ornate deposits, including small stalactites, develop in small niches (Photo 11). The absolute age of calcareous speleothems can (sometimes) be determined by radiocarbon dating (e.g. Libby 1955; Hendy 1970; Ralph 1971; Mook 1980; Faure 1986). Due to analytical limits of detection, the age determinations of most labora- tories are limited to approximately 40,000 years. A fragment of crust from the walls of Warren's Shaft was dated by the radiocarbon method (A. Kauf- man, Weizmann Institute of Science: written com- munication, December 12th, 1981). The sample contained no carbon- 14; in other words, all the original carbon- 14 had decayed, indicating that the crust is older than 40,000 years. Since the shaft must be older than the crusts on its wall, it may be established conclusively that it could not have been made by man (see Gill 1994b). 15</page><page sequence="23">Photo 10. Micro texture of dolomitic wall and calcareous crust from Warren's Shaft. The dark-colored dotted mosaic is the dense Mizzi Ahmar dolomite which forms the walls of the shaft. The calcareous crust consists of large calcite crystals, some up to 0.2 mm long, growing perpendicular to the wall, into the open space of the cavern (DG). By morphological and stratigraphie comparison, the dead-end shaft (Fig. 5) is obviously another dissolution shaft. This shaft has been filled in after Parker's excavations, but not before it was de- scribed in meticulous detail by Vincent (1911: 13, PI. IIIc). In the following quotations, Vincent's re- marks are distinguished from his descriptions by round parentheses and my own comments are enclosed in square parentheses. 'Towards the base of the soft mezzy strata [i.e., at the base of the Meleke] a cavern at the side causes a deformation in the plan. (Owing to a tendency entirely spontaneous in a mining work of this kind,) the excavation gets narrower and narrower as it descends (and difficul- ties increase...). This huge pit finishes in the shape of a funnel, the sides badly tapered off and in the bottom rough and scanty' (Vincent 1911: 13). 'The shaft itself does not progress in anything like a straight line downwards; its axis continually shifts to and fro instead of going on perpendicularly, and finally the hole becomes an inverted cone, with its apex downward, slanting hopelessly towards a fissure' (Vincent 1911: 38). In the section describing Warren's Shaft, Vincent (1911: 13) states: 'The incrustation on the sides here [i.e., in Warren's Shaft] is exactly the same as in shaft B [i.e., in the dead-end shaft].' Clearly, the features which Vincent describes are characteristic of a natural dissolution shaft, including rough walls, gradual narrowing towards the bottom, natural incrustations and, significantly, a natural cave, recognized as such already by him, exactly above the boundary between the Meleke and the Mizzi Ahmar. The passage above Warren's Shaft that leads out to the eastern slope (Fig. 5) is another large karst feature in the Meleke, formed by the coalescence of natural caves in the bottom part of the unit, above its contact with the Mizzi Ahmar. It is noteworthy that Vincent (1911: 38) already recognized this passage as a natural feature. Photo 1 1 .

'Gihon' is most aptly translated as 'gusher,' describing the pulsating regime of a water source that gushes intermittently. Today the spring flows sparingly, but its pulsating nature is mentioned in sources as late as the end of the 19th century (Warren and Conder 1884; Ben-Arieh 1977: 78-83) and the beginning of the 20th century (Vincent 1911). A pulsating flow, caused by the perpetual gradual filling and sudden emptying of a subterranean siphon, is unique to karst terrains and is also known in other karst springs in the Judea Group, such as Ein Fawar and Ein Samia. Records suggest that the periodicity of the gushes was quite erratic, varying with the seasons. According to Vincent (1911: 37), before Hezekiah's Tunnel was cleared out by the Parker's expedition, the spring flowed for 40 minutes every 9 to 10 hours. For a month following the clearing, it flowed for 12-15 minutes every 2-3 hours, but later the flow diminished to 4 to 5 times between 5 a.m. and 8 p.m. According to Simons (1952: 163) the rhythm of flow varies with the seasons, from four to five times a day and lasting about 40 minutes in the rainy period, to once or twice a day towards the end of the rainless summer. Vincent (1911) gives a detailed description of the Gihon and its adjacent tunnels, with accurate plans and sections. He considered the cave with the concave ceiling in which the spring issues (Photo 12) to be man-made, but wondered about 'the curious and even violent contrast between the irregularity of its plan and the elegant correctness of its vaulting, which rises like a cupola above the spring' (Vincent 1911: 3). Were it man-made, one would have to explain its overall irregular plan, its irregular floor and its excessive spaciousness (Vin- cent 1911: PI. I; see Figs. 5, 7). It should be added that smooth, and even polished-seeming, vaulted ceilings and walls are not at all unusual in natural caves. On the contrary, they are often the rule in caves that formed in the phreatic zone, and where, subsequent to the formation of the caves, the deposition of cave deposits was hindered by meager groundwater flow (cf. Ford 1988). Similar smoothly vaulted galleries can be seen in the above-mentioned Hareitun Cave, and in numerous Judea Group caves in eastern Samaria (Frumkin 1991). Another Photo 12. The cave of the Gihon Spring (IH). similar cave, which Vincent also mistakenly believed to be artificial, is found nearby (see below). Several other features associated with the spring make no sense if they have to be explained by human design. Among them is the channel that leads from the spring cave down and eastward to the Kidron Valley (conduit L in Vincent 1911: Pl. I; see Fig. 5). This channel, which is inaccessible today, was described by Vincent (1911: 4) as follows: '... we came upon a new conduit (L), deeply cut into the living rock to a depth of 1 metre 80. This conduit penetrates beneath the modern stairway, and disappears in a fairly small cavern (M), in which the rocky roof and fissured eastern wall show indubitable traces of the passage of water during a very long time... Its walls have all the aspects we should expect of a natural cavity.' Most likely, the conduit sketched by Vincent is the natural channel that originally drained the waters of the Gihon into the Kidron Valley. Supportive evidence is brought by Schick (1902), who reports that in the summer of 1901 very little water flowed through 17</page><page sequence="25">Hezekiah's Tunnel. Upon investigation, he found that much of the Gihon's water was escaping eastward. The escape route could have been by way of Vincent's conduit L, or his tunnel I, or both. To remedy the situation, 'a substantial wall was built under the lower steps, and the [Gihon's] basin was filled up with good masonry to the desired level. All was then properly paved and cemented, and the water has since kept up to the level of the second step from the bottom, and now runs through the aqueduct to the pool of Siloam' (Schick 1902). In 1909, when Parker's expedition investigated the waterworks, the 1901 constructions were removed and subsequently reconstructed and 'made thor- oughly waterproof with a layer of the best cement' (Vincent 1911: 5). The end of another dissolution shaft, which curiously was not described by Vincent, opens into the Mizzi Ahmar ceiling above the lower flight of steps leading to the cave of Gihon (see Gill 1994a: 25). It does not rise far, and its upper end is lost in the much-disturbed slope above the entrance to the stairway. Tunnels and Cavities near the Gihon Spring Parker's expedition (for a lucid account of which see Silberman 1980) discovered several tunnels near the Gihon (Fig. 7). Today most of these tunnels (except for the passage from the Gihon cave to Warren's Shaft, Vincent's tunnel VI) are obstructed by masonry and therefore not accessible to investiga- tion. During Shiloh's excavations we were able to enter tunnel II, which is the northern entrance to the Siloam Channel, and through it to enter tunnel III, the Round Chamber, and tunnel IV, as far as its blocked intersection with tunnel V. The most conspicuous karst feature in this network is the Round Chamber, between tunnels III and IV, which is a natural cave '... splendidly hollowed out from a layer of rock at least 4 to 5 metres high' (Vincent 1911: 8). Another natural cave was described by Vincent inside tunnel I (Fig. 7). In describing tunnel V, Vincent remarks that '... the bank of rock is full of cracks and hollows filled with limestone concre- tions or adorned with small stalactites' (Vincent 1911: 9). The date and function of these tunnels is still a mystery. Recently, Reich (1987) suggested that the tunnels may have been dug during the Second Temple period in order to enhance the flow of water in Hezekiah's Tunnel. If this is indeed the correct explanation, the effort must have been in vain, since the Mizzi Ahmar in these tunnels does not yield any groundwater. In describing this complex, Vincent also mentions the difficulties of underground work without ventilation. While inside tunnel II, 'thirty metres from the fountain the candles would not burn any longer, and we had to fall back on portable electric lanterns. In spite of the ventilator and oxygen capsules, the gangs had to be relieved every hour' (Vincent 1911: 7). Needless to say, the miners of Hezekiah's Tunnel did not have such facilities, and there, because of the length of the tunnel, the problem must have been much more acute. If the natural conduits which the miners followed did not furnish a flow of fresh air, it is unlikely that the underground tunneling could have been carried out at all. Hezekiah's Tunnel The most conspicuous karst feature in Hezekiah's Tunnel is the overhead opening of a dissolution shaft, located 142 m from the southern exit (herein referred to as the 'Southern Shaft'; see Figs. 8, 9). The shaft is blocked by debris and only its lower- most two meters or so are still open, forming a cone-like hollow in the ceiling of the tunnel (see Gill 1994a: 30). This shaft was already noticed by the earliest explorers of the tunnel (e.g. Wilson and Warren 1871: 239; Schick 1886: 88). Conder (1882: 126) states that it extends upwards through 10 feet of rock all the way to the rock surface and is then covered by 20 feet of unconsolidated debris. Vincent (1911: 42) states that its open part extends for 5.2 m above the tunnel's ceiling, which, according to his drawing (1911: Pl. V) is still about 4 m below the bedrock surface. However, it appears that the main karstie feature in Hezekiah's Tunnel is the tunnel itself, which, as already argued elsewhere (Gill 1991; 1994a), was dug by enlarging a natural karst conduit. To support this postulate I would like to highlight apparent design mistakes and other peculiar fea- tures and questions which provide clues to the method of its construction and which, moreover, are impossible to explain otherwise. If the route of the tunnel was deliberately planned in its present form, the most obvious apparent design anomaly in the tunnel is its winding route, which increases the distance between its end points 18</page><page sequence="26">Fig. 7. Plan of the tunnels near the Gihon Spring (from Vincent 191 1). The Roman numbering of the tunnels is Vincent's. The two walls in the eastern part of the plan were constructed in the 19th century. from a rectilinear 320 m to a flow distance of 533 m. The sinuous route raises the question of how the two teams, working from opposite ends towards each other as related in the Siloam Inscription (see, e.g., Sayce 1881), managed to meet. Another intriguing question, already mentioned above, is how the miners contrived a supply of fresh air for breathing and lighting in such a long tunnel. The configuration of the ceiling of the tunnel is another feature which requires an explanation. It is depicted in Fig. 8a, which was drawn on the basis of Vincent's measurements (1911: 42). Along most of its length the height of the ceiling varies between 1.7 m and 2.0 m. The height is seldom uniform for more than a few meters. Along a number of stretches the ceiling is too low for passage without bending: in a few spots it drops to about 1.5 m (the lowest is 1.45 m near point p in Fig. 8b). This cannot be considered anomalous in itself, since providing convenient passage was not necessarily one of the objectives of the planners. However, along the southernmost 70 m of the tunnel the ceiling rises gradually from 2.05 m to 5.08 m before it drops slightly to 4.58 m at the southern exit (Fig. 8; see Gill 1994b: 31). This would represent unnecessary hewing which needs to be explained. Moreover, throughout this part of the tunnel the texture of the surface of the ceiling is very rough and irregular, and there are no hewing marks on the ceiling. This is also the case for many other sectors of the tunnel in which the ceiling is higher than 2 m. Another remarkable feature which deserves at- tention is the phenomenal accuracy of the leveling of the floor of the tunnel. According to the latest measurements by Shiloh's expedition (W. Schlei- cher: personal communication, August 31st, 1983), the point of issue of the Gihon spring is at an elevation of 635.26 m, the top of the retaining step which bars the spring basin on the west side (see Vincent 1911: Pl. I) is at 635.87 m, the elevation of the bottom of this step is at 635.26 m, and the elevation of the southern exit is 634.94 m. Thus, the difference in elevation between the beginning of the tunnel (the bottom of the bar) and its southern exit is only 32 cm ('about 30 cm' in Shiloh 1984: 23). Interestingly enough, this is also precisely the difference that was measured by Conder (1882: 129). Vincent (1911: 19) measured a difference of 19 WARREN'S ' H SHAFT ■ I ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ ^ " ^ ^ r " i j.

The Gihon Spring. 2.18 m, which is apparently erroneous, but he makes a point of mentioning that Wilson (in his topo- graphical survey of 1864-65) found the Gihon and the southern end of the tunnel to be at one and the same elevation (of 2087 ft, or 636.08 m), which remarkably, at least with respect to the Gihon, varies by only 72 cm from the correct figure. Thus, over the length of the tunnel, its average slope is 0.6 mm to the meter (or 0.6 per mill). The average slope between the top of the bar and the southern exit is 1.8 per mill. Vincent's detailed measurements (1911: 19, 42) reveal that the slope is not uniform and that there are sectors in which the slope is actually in the wrong direction (from south to north, against the flow). These observations demonstrate that the exactness of the leveling of the floor itself was not crucial to the proper functioning of the tunnel. Rather, to maintain a constant flow of water, it was sufficient to bring the exit to an elevation that was just a few tens of centimeters below the level of the bar (i.e. slightly below 635.87 m high). At any rate, the precision of the leveling is indeed remarkable, even by modern-day standards. It indicates that the constructors were very able engineers and that they did their utmost to limit the hewing to the absolute minimum. With these observations and enigmatic aspects in mind, it is possible to propose the following explanation of how Hezekiah's Tunnel may have been dug. The proposed scenario is illustrated schematically in Fig. 9. The drawing shows only the northeastern and southwestern ends of the spur of the City of David (with the central part of the spur cut out), and it depicts the underground situation after the Warren Shaft Installation was already in operation. My principal postulate is that a natural karstie conduit, with a winding course, originally ran under the spur of the City of David, from its southern end in the Tyropoeon Valley to the southern end of the lower tunnel of the Warren's Shaft Installation. The trace of the original passage is shown in Fig. 9 as a narrow gap, colored white, positioned between the ceiling of Hezekiah's Tunnel (the black-colored area) and the gray-colored area below it. Note that this passage sloped towards the Gihon Spring: in its southern part the bottom of this conduit was about 5 m higher than the Gihon Spring. The passage may have been large enough for a man to crawl through, or alternatively it was first enlarged sufficiently to enable passage from end to end in order to ascertain that it did indeed connect with the Gihon. Once the connection was established, massive tunneling could be launched with assurance of success. The artificially dug tunnel traced this original conduit. Initially, a rough tunnel without precise leveling was prepared. To expedite the operation, this was done by two teams working from opposite ends towards one another. However, the final 'fine tuning' of the level of the floor must have been done by progressing in one direction, from the Gihon southwards. The material that was hollowed out in order to direct the Gihon's water to flow by gravity to the Siloam Pool in the south is the gray-colored section below the original passage. The tunnel must have a minimal height to provide convenient passage for cleaning and other maintenance opera- tions. Thus, where the height of the original conduit was too low the tunnelers raised it, as is evident from the exact rectangular finishing of the ceiling, the pick marks and the smoothly hewn rock plane. On the other hand, where it was high enough to begin with, it was left untouched; the ceiling in these high sections consists of rough rock with no hewing marks. In these sections the ceiling is a relic of the roof of the original dissolution channel. The construction of the tunnel was most probably carried out in dry conditions. This could have been 20 2 0 I i I i I i 1 1 1 i 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 L 0 100 200 300 400 500 m 01 Vertical exaggeration x20 fiļL jx 5* || ' ^ /////řQ 50 100 m m</page><page sequence="28">T3 S a g 2 -tí Ö T3 §165 S a g 0^1 2 -tí Ö c S a.S ~ S 60«^ 03 c S o T3 ~ S 1^3 S 03 -v t-i d) -H T3 1^3 r-! t-i "Srt tí (D Cd 52 JS tí 5 ^ (D &gt; *sï ïfc eöö ü u ^ 2 g cd ö -tí ü ^ u ^ ^ 'S 2 Ö -a "3 e s g Ö " * 3 % £j «g -2 S Ö 3 £j Q ^ U « S^í m o •&lt;-* ^5 e« ti 3 .G ti 3 . o u, 'ö _g ö &lt;r&gt; B § § 'ö l-sļsf _g ö B ï iS4 g o d u sj* ^JS ó l| oüS öp tí t! ó tí ®2(N.Ü tí }p5 C4-I O ļ? ri •?SŪ§S-S0 }p5 C4-I O ļ? ri g cd j£ ¡£ T3 "-» Ì3 h tí tií +-» O u ^ Tí h tí ï-*' +-» g O W o ï-*' U (m hh J5 t3 W y 'Ö u O SP hh Ü ij £ r 3Î3 s -tí u tí •§ ^ Ü ij ° r 3Î3 -tí tí m h . .ti c^h O fa cd -tí tí . 1/3 O S P - „ W) •2 -ö 'S «-&lt; *° 8 ^ ^ „ .S -ö tí tí *° 5/3 s I i tí &amp;i tí s£t i(§! 5/3 s -a&amp;jž Ö « £ s£t ^ * Ö « S o o ^ »'S fe o. &amp; &gt;&gt;T3 3 § « 2 S"'3 I '3 1 « tí I -g -o Õ á ^ s ü « tí -g Õ ^ g *-i ^ ü &lt;» (j ¿ Ui 1-1 *-i *.S *"„8 &amp;.S s * &amp; 8 .3 g."3 * &lt;2 g 5 « cl, J «1 ü cd 8 öß d tí J' S s cd ü cd öß d tí J' cd tí O tí .2 « J2 O s § 1 1 ! ®j Ü tí cd tí 2 - '-tí § tí -a .« cd ~ tí S 2 - 2 '-tí £ ^ 3 CL 1 ^ *a .tí :| &gt;" -a fa -a Cd CL ^ .tí &gt;" fa Cd 5 »"S £ CL 2á .tí 1/3 2 CL *-* 0S Cd »"S 2á ^-» 1/3 CL *-* «* |-S'3ö ^-» « CL S £ «* «'s 'S " « &lt;o « o Ss g -o K«^-So§ •s^a^ssl a 2;a~ j g v •S g § © I ň g § g eO » líl§8sí § g S^B-aíh S "3 3 fe c S - S 2'§~ "3 3 fe Igjb c S - 5Q-3-2 . e«», T3 &lt;D &lt;u ä O g . e«», o ö-Sä ~ &lt;u S ü c2 !r o ~ E ~ o.^oiS2fi ■g S u I -s « s H jž ^ :s&gt; *c S « g -s « H ^ *c g 5 ä 2 ^ &lt;ö o »? o •* ü £ ë 2 JŠ 'S ^ o ^ ü tí o 'S fa fa 'S 5 o I gg ° - »SS.SS3 ö iž f&gt; J ãi ^2 ** ^ 'S 'B 00 ^ ^ J n O ^ Û D T3 -, O tí J n O cd .tí Û D G -, T3 O ü-, tí cd filiali? g « Id öpS g « u Id - öpS O tí S CL&gt; îd ¿2 S ci O tí S o ^ tí ¿2 o *ts§Sī#J * S &gt;* o *2 g -tí * S &gt;* o *2 ^ g -tí &lt;^ * jí Oh tí ^ P ^ rh ü ļ cd O O ü ^ ü bb tí g fa rS tí -g ^ E Srthô-d cd S 21 _S2 .E c = .E c cu 5 =.i e "° 13 oj' e s «£ ^ § ^ ji "«5 t ^ A) "«5 gao t A) S « S &gt; s t| S -S ■§ ã JI &amp; i/i 5 &amp; -g/É Ji fl "ë "p41H|Blflflmr^aHHH " lo I / "'::^^^^| CQ / (U o -*= Ë 5 g</page><page sequence="29">accomplished by reopening the original outlet of the Gihon to the east, thereby directing its flow to the Kidron Valley (see Fig. 9). This scenario explains all the apparent design anomalies and the other outstanding questions of construction, namely: the winding course, the extra length, the irregular height and texture of the ceiling, the accuracy of the leveling, the fact that two teams could work towards each other from opposite ends without going astray and meet in the middle, and the availability of a constant supply of fresh air for the underground operations. Moreover, as will be shown below, this mode of construction is actually hinted at in the Bible. It is important to note that geology may also provide a clue to when the tunnel was dug. A few small (2-2.5 cm long) stalactites grow from the ceiling of Hezekiah's Tunnel. One of these gave a radiocarbon age of 1380 ± 160 y r (A. Kaufman, Weizmann Institute of Science: written communica- tion, December 12th, 1981). Since in the process of analyzing the sample the whole stalactite was ground up, the age obtained is an average which equals half of the stalactite's age (i.e., the average of the time that elapsed since it started to grow and the time since it was collected, which is zero). The result indicates that the stalactite started to grow about 2760 years ago, or in approximately 779 BCE. The exact date of the tunnel's construction is not known, but it was probably completed some time before Sennacherib's campaign against Judea in 701 BCE (see, e.g., Na'aman 1994). Thus, the radiometric date obtained from the stalactite is within 78 years of the correct date. The accuracy of the radiometric dating could most probably be improved upon by analyzing additional samples. TECTONIC CONTROL OF THE KARST DEVELOPMENT The tunnels in the vicinity of the Gihon (Fig. 7) roughly follow two directions, one trending ap- proximately N-S (generally within N10E to N10W) and the other E-W (within N70E to N100W). Likewise, when the winding courses of Hezekiah's Tunnel and the upper tunnel in the Warren's Shaft Installation are approximated by straight-line seg- ments, these are found to fall within the above two main directions. Some small parts of the more rounded sections can also be aligned with these major directions when they are subdivided into very small segments. As described previously, the or- ientation of the joint in Warren's Shaft is also N70E, and the faults and the joints in the area also trend roughly N-S and E-W. This parallelism between two sets of linear features is not incidental. It reflects the existence of two predominant sets of natural tectonic joints and faults in the area. As elsewhere, also in the present case it is only natural that the development of karstie dissolution conduits followed the lines of weakness created by tectonic strains. PREVIOUS GEOLOGICAL EXPLANATIONS The idea that at least some of the anomalies may be due to natural causes was contemplated by several researchers. These can be divided into two groups: those that tried to account for specific anomalies by local changes in lithology and those that offered a general conceptual explanation. Prior to Shiloh's excavations, the only geological description of the spur underlying the City of David was Blanckenhorn's (1905) map of Jerusalem. Blanckenhorn mapped the Mizzi Ahmar and the Mizzi Yahudi as one unit. He did not map any faults, and his map is inaccurate in the City of David area. Picard (1956) elaborated Blancken- horn's map of western Jerusalem by distinguishing the Mizzi Ahmar and the Mizzi Yahudi as two separate units, but otherwise the maps are the same. In his geological cross-section of southern Jerusa- lem, Blanckenhorn (1905: Table III, Fig. 3) simply connected the Meleke exposures on Mount Zion with those in the Kidron Valley at an even dip, disregarding faults, and thus arrived at an incorrect interpretation of the stratigraphie situation under the City of David. Specifically, he inferred that the upper part of the spur of the City of David consists of Mizzi Hilu, that Hezekiah's Tunnel is hewn in the Meleke (Blanckenhorn 1905: 89), and that the 'Mizzi Yahudi' (actually the Mizzi Ahmar) is reached only at the very foot of the eastern slope. Needless to say, this error has misled all those who relied on Blanckenhorn's geology. Vincent was a keen observer of Jerusalem's geology as he encountered it in Parker's excavations (Vincent 1911: 12-14, 36-37). He summarized his understanding of the local scene in a comprehensive monograph on the topography, archaeology and history of Jerusalem (Vincent 1912), which however relied on Blanckenhorn (1905) for geology. Vincent 22</page><page sequence="30">noticed most of the anomalies in the waterworks and attempted to explain some of them on the basis of what he knew about the local geology. Faithful to Blanckenhorn's tripartite scheme, he divided the strata underlying the City of David into three units. From top down these are the 'soft mezzy limestone' (a name coined by him in preference to Blanck- enhorn's Mizzi Hilu; however, since 'mezzy' means 'hard,' 'soft mezzy' is a poor choice), the 'malaky' and the 'Jewish mezzy.' From Vincent's descrip- tions, however, it is clear that the upper unit is the Meleke, and the lower two are both Mizzi Ahmar. The division into three units, instead of the two that are actually present, and particularly the confusion between the Meleke and the Mizzi Ahmar, led Vincent to erroneous interpretations and conclu- sions. According to Vincent, the dead-end shaft begins in the 'soft mezzy.' At the boundary between the 'soft mezzy' and the 'malaky' (actually the boundary between the Meleke and Mizzi Ahmar) he reports the presence of a natural cave (see above). According to him, the diggers sunk the shaft down the (supposedly soft) 'malaky,' and when they encountered the very hard 'Jewish mezzy', they could not continue. In his words: 'As soon as one reaches lower down than the malaky you get the formidable strata of red rock, so hard it is enough to dishearten the strongest arms, which the Palestine quarrymen have baptized by the picturesque name of 'Jewish mezzy' [i.e., Mizzi Yahudi]... Eventually the tenacity of the rock defeats the tenacity of the miner... the fight is given up and the place abandoned' (Vincent 1912: 13). Vincent appears to be completely caught up in the preconceptions of Blanckenhorn's stratigraphy, applying attributes of the Meleke outcrops to the subterranean Mizzi Ahmar. Only thus can we explain why he describes the very hard Mizzi Ahmar of the lower half of the walls of the curved tunnel as being 'homogeneous and soft' (Vincent 1912: 13), or Warren's Shaft as piercing the 'royal white stone, so easy to work' (Vincent 1912: 14). Nor did he realize that the dead-end shaft (shaft B in his terminology) was already deep within the Mizzi Ahmar (or, in his terminology, the 'Jewish mezzy') before it was (supposedly) abandoned. Vincent regarded the joint along which Warren's Shaft developed as a natural feature and recognized the chamber at its bottom as a natural cave (Vincent 1912: 10). He refers to the joint as a 'fault,' not implying any vertical displacement, but rather a large fissure which guided the workmen hewing the shaft. 'They broadened this fissure out, but allowed themselves to be entirely guided by it' (Vincent 1912: 14). Here too he feels obliged to recognize Blanckenhorn's strata, and he decides to place the boundary between the 'malaky' and the 'Jewish mezzy' (actually the Mizzi Ahmar) at a ledge about 7 m below the top of the shaft. In other words, he realized that here the miners had to hew through the hard rocks which defeated them in the dead-end shaft. To account for this, he concludes: 'Here the miners and engineers have proved the victors, and triumphed against the resistance of the rock' (Vincent 1912: 14). However, despite this correct observation, he still believed (probably following Blanckenhorn) that Hezekiah's Tunnel is situated in the Meleke (Vincent 1912: 23). As indicated above, there are many instances where Vincent refers explicitly to natural caves and other weathering features (although he does not use the term 'karst'). Therefore, I suspect that he must have contemplated the proposition that the entire layout of the waterworks was karst-controlled, but eventually decided against it because of his pre- conceived conviction that they were essentially man- made and his desire to prove it. Another attempt to invoke geological explana- tions was made by Hecker (1956). However, Hecker made no field investigations, and shared the mistaken views of Blanckenhorn and Vincent about the local stratigraphy (Hecker 1956: Fig. 2). With reference to the Warren's Shaft Installation he simply reiterated Vincent's arguments. As to the tortuous course of Hezekiah's Tunnel, his main thesis is that a straight line would have taken the tunnel through both the hard 'Mizzi Yahudi' {sensu Blanckenhorn) and the unstable Mizzi Hilu. He suggests that the winding was planned in order to confine the tunnel to the softer Meleke bedrock. This is erroneous on both factual and spatial grounds. First, the entire tunnel is hewn in what Hecker calls 'Mizzi Yahudi' (i.e. Mizzi Ahmar) and not in the Meleke. Secondly, no natural spatial arrangement of layered strata exists that is compa- tible with Hecker's model. In other words, no amount of winding could have shifted the tunnel from one rock unit to another. The first departure from the traditional (unsatis- factory) explanations was proposed by Sulley (1929). H. Sulley, an architect from Nottingham, England, took an early interest in Hezekiah's 23</page><page sequence="31">Tunnel (Sulley 1881), although he apparently never visited it. In response to an article in the Daily Telegraph which discussed the sinuous course of Hezekiah's Tunnel, he wrote a short note to the Palestine Exploration Fund Quarterly Statement which reads as follows (Sulley 1929): '... Since those who inspected the tunnel mention a cleft in the rock at the point where the excavators met, it seems to me that this cleft is the explanation to the course taken by the excavators in forming this tunnel. Probably the cleft extended from the Virgin Fountain [i.e., the Gihon] to the pool of Siloam, and a small quantity of water would at times trickle through; if so, Hezekiah's workmen commencing at each end, would enlarge this channel to its present dimensions for the purpose he had in view in cutting off the water from the use of an enemy. Hence its erratic course.' Thus, the correct explanation, although without substantiation, was in essence already offered some time ago. Sulley' s interpreta- tion was recalled by Amiran (1968; 1976), who noted that such a fissure could furnish a constant flow of fresh air. However, the anomalies in the Warren's Shaft Installation still remained unex- plained. Issar (1976) was, hitherto, the only geologist to address these problems. However, his insight was hindered by his being unable to visit the Warren's Shaft Installation, which was not accessible before Shiloh's expedition cleared it in 1980. His remarks were made in the context of proposing a general model for the historical development of ancient water supply systems, and his emphasis was on hydrogeological, rather than site-specific geological and stratigraphie, observations. He suggested that the Warren's Shaft Installation was man-made and that it was constructed in three stages: (1) A horizontal tunnel (Fig. 5) was dug in order to reach a spring - proposed by him - on the eastern slope. (2) When the spring dried up the dead-end shaft was dug as a well that was planned to reach the groundwater table, but it had to be abandoned because it did not yield enough water. (3) Upon this failure Warren's Shaft had to be constructed in order to reach the Gihon. This hypothesis appears untenable because there is no sign of a spring at the exit of the upper tunnel on the eastern slope. Moreover, the dead-end shaft is highly slanted and could hardly have served as a well. Otherwise, Issar concurred with Sulley and Amiran regarding the strong likelihood that the construction of Heze- kiah's Tunnel was guided by a natural karstie dissolution channel. Thus, of the geological explanations offered previously, only Sulley's educated guess agrees with the conclusions of the present study. But without a convincing substantiation, it remained as a very plausible, but nevertheless speculative, postulate. Furthermore, the enigmatic questions concerning the Warren's Shaft Installation remained unsolved. For these reasons uncertainties and doubts still remained, and a comprehensive solution that would account simultaneously for all the unanswered problems was still very much needed. CONCLUDING REMARKS The present study presents geological evidence which substantiates the contention that the water- works of the City of David were constructed by following a pre-existing system of natural dissolu- tion conduits of karstie origin. These features were formed in the distant geological past, long before man settled on the spur. The courses of the conduits dictated the plans of the waterworks, and their connection to the surface provided a natural supply of air for breathing and lighting without which the underground tunneling operations could have not been carried out. The natural passages were skillfully adapted and integrated into hydraulically functional systems which ensured a dependable water supply for the city during both peace and war. The information assembled herein highlights the fact that the carbonate rocks which underlie the City of David, and their equivalent formations in Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria, were affected by karstie dissolution processes, and that karst features are ubiquitous in them. It was also shown that karst features abound in the waterworks themselves, the more conspicuous ones being four vertical dissolu- tion shafts, several caves and a siphon-draining gushing spring. In addition, radiometric dating of calcareous crust from Warren's Shaft indicates that it is older than 40,000 years, proving that the shaft could have not been made by man. The new interpretation has important bearings on two related issues. (1) After Warren's Shaft was discovered, Birch (1878; 1885), followed by Vincent (1911: 33-35) and many others, suggested that Warren's Shaft might be the 'tsinnor,' traditionally interpreted as 'pipe' or 'gutter' and recently shown to be most aptly 24</page><page sequence="32">translated as 'waterspout' (Kleven 1994), through which Yo'av (Joab) ben Tseruya entered the city and captured it by surprise (2 Sam. 5:7-8; 1 Chron. 11:5-6). These authors regarded the Warren's Shaft Installation as man-made and their interpretation implied that it was constructed by the Canaanites. This interpretation was rejected by many eminent scholars (including Dalman, Albright, Mazar, Ya- din, Aharoni, Braslavi and Shiloh) on the grounds that all the waterworks discovered in biblical towns date from the Israelite period and that the Canaanites presumably did not have the capability to build subterranean waterworks (see Shiloh 1984: 23, n. Ill; Shiloh 1987). This view refuted Amiran's (1951) earlier proposal that the waterworks may have been constructed by the Canaanites. Since the shaft and the passages are now known to predate both the Canaanites and the Israelites, the question of capability has become entirely irrelevant to the issue. These natural passages existed at the time of David's conquest, whether or not the Jebusites adapted them into a usable water supply system, and they could have been used by Joab and his men to conquer the city by surprise. (2) 2 Chron. 32:30 reads, 'And he, Hezekiah, stoppered the upper outlet of Gihon's waters and straightened them down westward to the City of David' (translation by D.G.). The structure of the Hebrew sentence permits the reading 'upper Gihon' instead of 'upper outlet of Gihon,' an ambiguity that has led several scholars to infer the presence of two springs, an 'upper Gihon,' which was thought to be the 'genuine' Gihon, and a 'lower Gihon,' situated at the southern exit of Hezekiah's Tunnel (cf. Smith 1907: 107; Simons 1952: 163; Amiran 1968; Issar 1976). The 'upper outlet of Gihon' was its outlet into the Siloam Channel, which is about 2.5 m higher than the level of issue of the spring, marked as 'head of Siloam Channel' in Figs. 5 and 9. Schick (1891: 17) writes that the difference is 5 feet; according to Vincent (1911: Pl. I) it is about 2.5 m; and Weill (1947: 73) reports it as 2.38 m. In order to enter the Siloam Channel the water must have been raised to this level by a small dam. Note that, given that 'straightened' is the term used for 'guided along a precise slope,' which is too technical for archaic Hebrew, the corrected reading admirably fits the scenario for the construction of the tunnel described above. It also comes as a sensible sequel to the foregoing verse: 'And a host of people gathered and they stopped all the springs, and the brook that ran in the midst of the land' (2 Chron. 32:4; translation by D.G.), describing the sealing of the Gihon's inlet into the Siloam Channel and the channel's outlets onto the right slope of the Kidron Valley (as already argued by Simons 1952: 177). TRIBUTE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I would like to end this report with a tribute to Father L.H. Vincent. Vincent was an all-round scholar, in the best intellectual tradition of the late 19th century. In his study of the Jerusalem water- works he delved into his broad knowledge of such diverse disciplines as archaeology, geography, geol- ogy, history and biblical studies. His survey of the waterworks was done single-handed, with rather primitive instruments. One can only express praise and admiration for his laborious and brilliant scientific work. I am most thankful to my late friend and colleague, Yigal Shiloh, for the opportunity he gave me to make a contribution toward the solution of problems which have puzzled scholars for decades. I would also like to thank the Geological Survey of Israel for supporting the study, and I. Perath for his excellent editorial assistance. The figures were prepared by J Rosenberg, with the exception of Fig. 6, which was prepared by G. Solar and W. Schleicher. BIBLIOGRAPHY Amiran, R. 1951. Water Supply by Tunnels.

These figurines were discovered in all excavation areas, in both Iron Age II strata and later contexts. Most of the figurines belong to the Iron Age II in Palestine (Plan 1), and particularly to Judah. The City of David corpus is unique in its quantity, in the variety of subjects that it incorpo- rates and in the types included therein. The figurines may be divided typologically into two main categories, each of which may be further broken down into sub-types: anthropomorphic figurines and animal figurines. The latter category is the larger of the two, comprising a rich variety of animal types. However, it should be noted that horses constitute 82% of this group. The represen- tations of horses assume various forms, but most are extremely schematic and stereotypical. The former category suggests a preference for female representations displaying or clutching their breasts; male figurines generally depict a horse and rider. There appears to be an artistic tendency to schematize and stereotype the objects under discus- sion, whose roots should be sought in contemporary social and religious contexts. METHODOLOGY The system of classification employed in this study (Table 1) is based principally on that of Holland (1975; 1977). It categorizes the various types on the basis of their form, any variation in form constitut- ing a new class. Holland's classification system is more generalized than the author's, which is more flexible. After the method of classification had been determined and each figurine and fragment had been ascribed to its category, a statistical analysis (see Appendix E) was performed in order to ascertain the following: 1) The proportions of animal vs. human repre- sentations among the figurines. 2) The proportions of each sub-type within the main types. 3) Whether or not these proportions changed between the 8th and the 6th centuries BCE. HISTORY OF RESEARCH The objects under discussion have generally been noted in excavation reports without any reference to their intrinsic significance, and few attempts have been made to classify them typologically. Only a few studies have endeavored to analyze the sig- nificance of the figurines. One such pioneering study (Pilz 1924) dealt only with anthropomorphic figur- ines, classifying them into types and sub-types and concluding that 'pillar figurines' (Type C of Pilz's typology) were typical of Palestine (Pilz 1924: 161). Pritchard (1943) and Albright (1953) also carried out typological classifications of the anthropo- morphic figurines. For his 'Qadesh' (plaque) type, Pritchard (1943: 32, 41-42) attempted to determine whether there was any relationship between the literary descriptions of the various divinities and their depiction in the plastic arts. However, he merely related the pillar figurines to the process of childbirth. In Albright's view, the pillar figurine represented the 'goddess mother,' 'the goddess of fertility.' Albright and Pritchard initiated a new approach to the study of figurines, asserting that anthropomorphic types were related in one way or 29</page><page sequence="37">Table 1.

At the same time Albright regarded all non-anthropomorphic figurines as toys (Albright 1943: 142). The same view was adopted by Heaton (1956), who, however, considered only clay models of furniture and animals as toys. Burrows (1941) took a more flexible view, suggesting that some of the objects served as either votive offerings or toys. Another interesting study, though concerned with pillar figurines alone, was carried out by Engle (1979). Approaching the subject from a historical and theological perspective, he attempted to identify the goddess represented by the pillar figurine, in addition to studying its geographical distribution. He concluded that this type was restricted to Judah (Engle 1979: Fig. 12). 31</page><page sequence="39">Fowler (1985), in his survey of previous studies, concluded that figurines had a variety of uses, serving as ritual objects, votive offerings, toys, or other possible purposes. Dornemann's study of Iron Age Transjordan included a chapter on small finds, in which Transjordanian figurines were classified into three main types: women, men and horses. His conclusion was somewhat superficial, being merely a categorization of the objects (Dornemann 1985). The most comprehensive studies to date were carried out by Holland (1975; 1977). He classified Palestinian figurines (humans, animals, and objects such as furniture and temple models) according to form and technique of manufacture and attempted to determine the significance and function of the figurines. His main conclusions were based primar- ily on one assemblage, that discovered in Kenyon's excavation of Cave I in her Area A in Jerusalem. It should be noted that, unlike his predecessors, Holland treated the figurines as a single group comprising human and animal figurines as well as various objects such as furniture. The importance of Holland's study was his underlying assumption that figurines in general, and anthropomorphic ones in particular, were not necessarily related to ritual. 'Amr (1980), following Holland, published an assemblage of figurines recovered from Transjorda- nian sites. He classified them into types and sub- types and speculated on their significance. 'Amr did not differentiate between anthropomorphic and animal figurines, but treated them as one group. His main conclusion was that they were indeed expressions of religious beliefs ('Amr 1980: 130). Finally, Holladay's recently-published article in- vestigates the extent to which artifacts are related to ritual places at different sites within Judah and Israel (Holladay 1987). PARALLEL FINDINGS FROM OTHER SITES The parallels for the City of David figurines are presented in Table 2 according to the typology used in this study. In cases where there is some doubt concerning the parallel, a question mark appears after the reference. While all the figurines consid- ered in this study may be generally dated to the Iron Age II (1000-586 BCE), questions regarding the chronology of each particular type within the period have been deliberately omitted from this section; hence, no stratigraphical information is presented for the parallels. Furthermore, since the corpus of comparable material is based only on published figurines and thus may reflect a bias in favor of the most complete or attractive items, the list of parallels reflects only the presence of types found both in the City of David excavations and at other sites. Obviously, the circumstances of their publica- tion preclude a complete statistical analysis of the figurines from other sites. Nevertheless, after analysis of the complete City of David assemblage, similar patterns in the proportions of the various types may be observed in the corpus of published figurines from other Iron Age II Judahite sites; these will be discussed below. RESULTS OF THE ANALYSIS Quantity In terms of quantity, the assemblage is the largest found in Palestine (1,309 figurines). Moreover, the large number of figurines discovered at other sites in Jerusalem should be added to this figure. If Holland is correct in claiming that 597 figurines were found in Jerusalem up to 1975 (Holland 1975: chart 1: 37; 1977), and if to that number are added the few figurines published subsequently (Broshi and Barkai 1985: 13), a sub-total of 601 figurines is obtained. With the figurines discovered in the City of David excavations directed by Shiloh, nearly 2,000 figur- ines have been found thus far in Jerusalem. It should be stressed that the very large number of figurines from Jerusalem is disproportionate to the area excavated in comparison to those published from other Palestinian sites. No site has yielded even a quarter of the finds recovered from Jerusalem (e.g., only 200 figurines were published from Megiddo). Because the number of figurines recovered from Jerusalem is so large, it allows a more detailed, and therefore perhaps more reliable, statistical analysis to be conducted (see Appendix E). Distribution The list of parallels for the City of David figurines clearly shows that, with very few exceptions, these types are not found outside Judah (see Plan 1). Furthermore, future finds from sites outside Judah are unlikely to affect this distribution. Other scholars, such as Holland and Engle, have drawn similar conclusions. In summarizing the finds from Cave I in Jerusalem, Holland stated that similar 32</page><page sequence="40">Plan 1.

For the City of David figurines, it should be noted that if the wigs that extend to the sides originally contained any curls, they have not survived, and curls are discernible only on the forehead.

While he asserted that a number of examples were found at Megiddo, Beth She'an and Hazor, closer scrutiny suggests that some of these parallels are inaccurate. Engle claimed that the geographical distribution of the 'genuine moulded woman's head' type is restricted to Judah (only two examples appear outside this region; Engle 1979: Fig. 12). The present study has shown that not only do parallels for the individual types of City of David figurines occur at other Judahite sites, but that the assemblages are extremely similar. When assem- blages are compared, the Jerusalem and Judahite figurine corpus differs greatly from those belonging to areas outside Judah. Technique Examination of the techniques employed in the manufacture of the figurines under discussion has shown that all the figurines were handmade, except for Type A2, in which the figurine head was moldmade, and that apparently all the figurines were at one time white-slipped and painted: 85% of the figurines still retained their white slip. The large number of figurines and their homogeneity raise the question of whether they were manufac- tured in one center for mass consumption, or whether cottage, or extended family, industries manufactured them for private consumption only. Figurine samples were therefore subjected to both pétrographie and neutron activation (NAA) ana- lyses in order to determine the provenience of the figurines and whether the figurines were produced in one specific area by a single individual or group, or in several different areas by non-related indivi- duals or groups. The results of the pétrographie analysis are presented in Appendix C and of NAA in Appendix D. Individual Types In the author's opinion, it is necessary to reassess certain aspects of some figurine types, the previous consensus notwithstanding. 1. Anthropomorphic Figurines These are built on a clay pillar whose base is generally wide and concave. The upper part of the pillar is considered to represent the torso of a woman, who either clutches her breasts or holds an object to her breasts. Her head is either molded or handmade (i.e., pinched). The City of David figurines clearly indicate that the pillar alone may represent the torsos of either female or male figurines (see Figs. 10:3, 13:1,2; Pis. 1:3, 4:1), or the bases of bird figurines (see Fig. 15:5; PL 6:1). Thus, in the author's opinion, they cannot be included in a statistical analysis, since they cannot be attributed to a specific type. Another interesting fact is that the pillar figurine is the sole form employed in Judah for anthro- pomorphic representations. This characteristic is particularly evident when comparing the City of David figurines to those from sites outside of Judah, where the figurines possess two different forms: three-dimensional, either hollow or solid, and relief in the earlier 'plaque' tradition. The plaque type was deeply rooted in Canaanite culture, particularly in the Late Bronze Age. It continued to appear during the Iron Age I and, in some parts of the country, even into the Iron Age II (Albright 1943; Tadmor 1982). The lower part of one such figurine constitutes the only example of this type (A7) found in the City of David excavations (Fig. 19:1; PL 9:10); it was discovered in a Stratum 16 fill of the Late Bronze Age II. The figurines from Judah and Jerusalem underscore the fact that, beginning in the 8th century BCE, completely new and different techniques and traditions were employed in the plastic depiction of the human form. In contrast, relief techniques continued in use alongside three-dimensional ones outside Judah. 2. Animal Figurines In the case of animal figurines, it was generally believed that the majority of these represented horses. In this study, an examination of the proportion of horses among animal figurines leads to the same conclusion. On the other hand, the proportion of other animals is not negligible (out of 211 animal heads, 18% belong to species other than horses). The typological subdivision of Type B1 (animals other than horses) indicates that most of the animals depicted belong to the faunai life of that period. Moreover, the animal representations in- dicate a profound acquaintance with the faunai world; the traits of each species are reflected in the figurines (see Appendix B). Horse figurines were rendered in various ways. The simplest representation, highly schematized 37</page><page sequence="45">and stereotyped, was the most common; no facial details are present, except for the mouth and ears. A minority are more detailed, plastic representa- tions. As noted above, parallels for the City of David horse type figurines are restricted to Judahite sites. Horse figurines outside Judah differed from the Judahite type both in the technique of their manufacture and in the degree of plastic detail with which they were rendered. The equine theme appears in two variations: as part of the faunai life of Palestine and as part of the theme of horse and rider. Since the horse and rider figurines have no other attributes, it is difficult to imbue them with any religious connota- tion. Excavation reports of Near Eastern sites reveal the frequent occurrence of the horse and rider motif, which may thus have constituted a universal theme. Dating Problems A detailed statistical analysis of the figurines was performed in order to address the problem of their date. The methodology and results of this analysis are presented in Appendix E. The analysis was based on all the figurines recovered during the City of David excavations directed by Shiloh, both those found in Iron Age II contexts and those found in unstratified loci. A number of factors must be taken into consideration when attempting to interpret the results. Firstly, almost half of the figurines derive from loci which are not dated to the Iron Age II, though the figurines themselves date from this period. Secondly, the large quantity of animal limbs and horns (Type B3h) probably distorts the mean- ing of the data given in Tables 2.1 and 2.2. This is primarily because it is impossible to determine the exact number of figurines represented by these fragments. For this reason, the type was omitted from the more detailed typological tables (Tables 4.2 and 4.3). Thirdly, Type A (anthropomorphic figurines) includes a large number of pillar bases (Types A3 and A5) which cannot be attributed to a specific sub-type (see the foregoing discussion). The observed stratigraphical distribution of Type A3 (less frequent in Stratum 12), for example, is of limited relevance, as these are fragments of poorly preserved figurines of either Type Al or Type A2. Hence, only the data presented in the more detailed tables according to sub-types (Tables 3.1 and 3.2) may be considered to represent the stratigraphical distribution of anthropomorphic figurines. Human figurines of Types Al and A2 are frequent from Strata 12-11 (8th-7th centuries BCE) to Stratum 10 (6th century BCE). In sum, Type A appears in the 8th century BCE, and its chronological span extends to the 6th century BCE, i.e. until the destruction of Jerusalem in 586. The frequency of Type B animals is uniform in Strata 12, 11 and 10. An exception to the rule is Type B3, which constitutes 100% of Type B appearing in Stratum 13 (Table 4.1); there are only five Type B figurines in Stratum 13, and they are all Type B3. In the author's opinion, this exception should be disregarded. If one considers only the clearly defined sub- types of Types A and B, it is apparent that fauna are represented twice as often as anthropomorphic figurines, despite Holladay's claim (1987: 276-77) that pillar figurines are dominant. It should be borne in mind that publications often present only the most attractive or striking figurines, and that these are generally anthropomorphic representa- tions. Type C, comprising bed-shaped figurines and possibly chair fragments, does not appear in very large numbers but is nonetheless well known from many sites, mainly in Judah. The 'Ashdoda' type, familiar from Philistine sites, is shaped like a bed, but with a distinctive anthropoid figure rising from one end. Though no intact 'bed figurines' were discovered in the City of David excavations, none of the fragments bear any resemblance to the 'Ashdo- da' type. In most other Judahite sites, the 'Ashdoda' type is similarly absent, though figurines represent- ing items of furniture, such as beds or chairs, do appear. It is reasonable to assume, therefore, that the Type C fragments from the City of David parallel the intact figurines found at other Judahite sites rather than the 'Ashdoda' type characteristic of Philistia. Consequently, while Type C does not have a particularly large distribution at the City of David, it does constitute a distinct component within the corpus of Judahite figurines from the 8th-6th centuries BCE. By definition, Type D does not constitute a well- defined type. What is more, this type consists of fragments so small that they could not be attributed with any certainty to Types A, B or C. However, 38</page><page sequence="46">morphologically they clearly belong to the figurines under discussion. Exceptional Figurines Each Type E figurine is discussed separately, as each has a different date and provenience. 1. Figurine Dl/13251 (Fig. 18:11; PL 9:8-9) recalls the 'Ashdoda' figurine in form, though the City of David head is larger, coarser and formed slightly differently. A very similar head to that from the City of David was found at Ashdod (Dothan and Freedman 1967: PL 17:12, Fig. 35:3; it dates from no later than the 11th or early 10th century BCE. The City of David figurine was discovered in a Stratum 15 fill (Iron Age I), and it obviously does not belong to the groups discussed above. 2. Figurine G 11434 (Fig. 18:6; PL 9:4) was found in a Stratum 14 fill (10th century BCE). It is similar in form to anthropomorphic vessels from Ashdod (Dothan and Freedman 1967: PL 27:5) and Dan (Biran 1982: PL 16:B). 3. Figurine G 11138 (Fig. 18:10; PL 9:5) was found in a Stratum 8 fill (early Hellenistic period). A parallel was found at the Transjordanian site of Tell Deir Alia (Ibrahim and van der Kooij 1983: 1, 125:1; 580, Fig. 1:1) in a late 5th or 4th century BCE context. While the upper part of the head is rendered identically in both figurines, the worn condition of the City of David figurine, particularly the lower part of the head, precludes the identifica- tion of parallels with any certainty. 4. Figurine El/10256 (Fig. 16:1; PL 6:8) is a very detailed horse's head. This hollow head was classified as Type B2bl. Stylistically, it is almost identical to the solid head of figurine El /16001 (Type B2b2; Fig. 16:2; PL 6:9). Although stratigra- phically El/ 10256 is firmly attributed to Stratum 14, it belongs to a group whose distribution clearly falls within Strata 12-10. This figurine should perhaps be viewed as an early forerunner of a type which was to flourish only in the 8th century BCE. 5. In addition, several other figurines that ostensibly belong to 8th-6th century BCE types have been attributed to pre-8th century contexts. These derive from the following loci: 962, 1128, 1139, 1141, 1623, 1651, 2123, 2171. These loci were attributed to Strata 14 and 13 (10th-9th centuries BCE); the figurines in question should be viewed as forerunners of types which flourished from the 8th century BCE onwards. CONCLUSIONS Taking into account a number of factors, the author has drawn the following conclusions on the basis of the City of David figurines: 1 . The Iron Age figurines should be viewed as one corpus composed of a number of different types. Discussing selected types alone obscures the fact that they constitute one general group. 2. The corpus of the City of David and Judah comprises 19% anthropomorphic figurines, 73% animal representations and 2% furniture, such as beds, chairs, etc. Consequently, the corpus as a whole constitutes an 'identity tag' for the cultural entity of Judah. 3. Chronologically, Types A, B and C definitely flourished from the 8th to the 6th centuries BCE, and not, as Holladay asserts, from the end of the 8th or the middle of the 7th century (Holladay 1987: 280). However, they clearly began developing ear- lier, from the 10th-9th centuries. The continuous appearance of Types A, B and C up to the 6th century appears to conflict with the biblical refer- ences to cultic reforms in the time of King Josiah. 4. The City of David excavations have made it clear that, quantitatively, Jerusalem was a promi- nent center as far as figurines are concerned. This conforms to the fact that Jerusalem was the preeminent city in Judah during the Iron Age II, with the greatest population and, most likely, population density. 5. The City of David corpus clearly indicates that distribution of figurines within the site was uniform. Moreover, such a uniform distribution pattern has been found at other excavated sites in Judah. Thus, attempts to relate them to specific ritual places are unfounded. Holladay's assertions notwithstanding (1987: 281), figurines have appeared in similar concentrations in both residential buildings and locations considered to be ritual sites, such as Kenyon's Cave I in Jerusalem. 6. In the author's opinion, the Iron Age II figurines in Judah and Jerusalem should be under- stood as an expression of popular beliefs whose traditions were rooted in the political and cultural development of Judah. 7. Because of the typological and technological homogeneity of the City of David figurines, the author tends to believe that they were produced in the vicinity of Jerusalem, perhaps by a group of workshops that adopted the same tradition. 39</page><page sequence="47">BIBLIOGRAPHY Aharoni, Y. 1962.

For each figurine, the following information is given: 1) excavation area, registration number, locus number and figure and/or plate reference where relevant; 2) descriptions of the form of the figurine and its state of preservation, color, clay composition and details such as painting, decoration and slip; 3) dimensions. Within each typological group, the figurines appear in alphabetical order of area and numerical order of registration number. The clay color is defined according to the Munsell Soil Color Charts (1975). The core color is defined as black, gray, clay-colored or light-colored. The number in parentheses after the core color defines the relationship between the thickness of the core and the surface: (1) thick core and thin surface and (2) thin core and thick surface. A thick surface is one of more than 0.5 cm. The grit size is given in millimeters. Where the grit density is exceptionally high or low, this is noted; otherwise the density is not noted. Details of decoration are given, e.g. plastic decoration, slip and color of slip, painting and color of painting. Dimensions are given in centimeters. Abbreviations used for dimensions are as follows: Bse. (base), Dia. (diameter), Ht. (height), Lth. (length), Plr. (pillar), Th. (thickness) and Wth. (width).

Tchernov Department of Evolution, Systematics and Ecology The Hebrew University of Jerusalem Over 1300 clay figurines were found during eight excavation seasons at the City of David between 1978 and 1985. Most of these figurines are attributed to the Iron Age II (10th-6th centuries BCE). The most common type discovered is of figurines depicting animals (N = 926); in this cate- gory 211 items depict animals' heads. This assem- blage, the largest found at Judean and Israelite sites, differentiates between the various species and illustrates the fauna of the period. Animal figurines are generally simple representa- tions, emphasizing only the features characteristic of the species. However, there are some more complex and impressive depictions, with greater emphasis on identifying features. Most figurines included an element of color in addition to their plastic design. It is likely that all figurines were originally painted, though traces of paint did not survive in every one. Their condition makes it impossible to identify any clear pattern. Among the 211 figurines depicting animals' heads, 174 were defined as horses' heads and 37 as heads of other animals. The identification of horses is based on a number of components: 1) the location of the ears; 2) the shape of the mouth; 3) the depiction of the mane; and 4) the depiction of trappings. In those figurines that were discovered intact (with both head and body), it was possible to identify traces of a rider's body applied to the body of the animal. The richness of the variety of other animal representations is exceptional. They include cattle, sheep, horned animals (a deer, an ibex and a gazelle), a hyena, an elephant, a bear (?), hippopo- tami, a camel, and an ostrich. The identification of the types was based on the morphological traits characteristic of each animal species. The following list of figurines details the identifying elements. CATTLE 1. El/16498; L. 2015 (Type Bla; Fig. 14:2; PL 5:1). The head of an animal with an elongated, thin mouth. The mouth is slightly open. The character- istic feature is the pair of horns pointing to the sides. The head has been identified as that of a bull. 2. E3/13031; L. 1584 (Type Bla; Fig. 14:3; PL 5:2). Elongated, broad head of an animal. The mouth is open with a protruding tongue. A pair of horns extends to the sides. The head has been identified as that of a bull. 3. G 5517; L. 850 (Type Bla; Fig. 14:4). Very defective head. The horns or ears extend to the sides, and the depiction of the eyes suggest that this is a bull. 4. Dl/6980; L. 422 (Type Bla; Fig. 14:5; PL 5:3). The head of an animal, part of a zoomorphic vessel. The head is thickened, the eyes and nostrils are indicated by holes and the mouth is slightly open. A pair of horns extends to the sides. This head has also been identified as that of a bull. SHEEP 5. El/7806; L. 1285 (Type Bib; Fig. 14:6; PL 5:4). Hollow head of animal, presumably part of a zoomorphic vessel. The back of the head is small and the mouth is thin and short. A pair of horns protrudes from the sides of the head, extending backwards, with the tips bending forward. Another pair of horns extends backwards from the top of the head. The eyes are engraved on either side of the head, and the horns circle around them. The head has been identified as that of a ram. 6. G 5568; L. 850 (Type Bib; Fig. 14:7; PL 5:5). Head of small animal, the back of the skull somewhat rounded. The mouth is thin and short. There are two brackets at the sides of the head. No 85</page><page sequence="93">further details are indicated. The head has been identified as that of a sheep. 7. El/10025; L. 1604 (Type Blj; Fig. 15:2; PL 5:16,21). Rounded head with extremely short mouth. Ears protrude from either side of the head. There are no applied details, but some details may originally have been painted. The shape of the head suggests that this is a lamb. 8. El/10790; L. 1619 (Type Blj; Fig. 15:3; PL 5:20). Animal's head and the beginning of its body. The head is somewhat rounded; ears protrude from either side of it. The eyes are represented by holes, and the mouth is open. As in the previous example, the general shape and the various details indicate that this is a lamb. HORNED ANIMALS 9. El/8620; L. 1334 (Type Blh; Fig. 14:8; PL 5:6). Elongated head of animal, with mouth and long neck. Horns with a rectangular cross-section extend above the head. The horn's tips are slightly rounded. Two circles protrude on either side of the head. The eyes are not indicated. This animal was identified as a deer {Dama mesopotamica or Cer vus elaphus). 10. El/6223; W. 265 (Type Bli; Fig. 14:16; PL 5:15). Elongated head of animal. The long mouth is prominent, as is the pair of large and wide horns, with a rectangular cross-section. The neck is broad. Two brackets, perhaps representing ears, project from either side of the head. This figurine has been identified as the head of an En Gedi ibex ( Capra ibex nubiana). 11. El/10073; L. 1604 (Type Blk; Fig. 14:17; Pl. 5:7). Elongated head of animal, with long and prominent mouth and horns with a round cross- section rising above the head. No other facial features are indicated. This figurine has been identified as a Gazella sp*. OTHER ANIMALS 12. E2/12141; L. 1706 (Type Blc; Fig. 14:9). Animal's head, neck and frontal part of body, strongly suggesting that this is a figurine of a striped hyena. The head and mouth are flat and wide. The large nostrils are clearly shown, and the typical short ears of the hyena are represented here by short triangles. The extremely wide and heavy neck continues to the frontal part of the body. Under the neck the large fold of skin typical of the hyena is represented by a downward protrusion. 13. El/16286; L. 2028 (Type Bid; Fig. 14:10; PL 5:8). Very defective head of animal. The most prominent feature is the mouth, or long trunk with two holes at its tip (nostrils?). Two eyes indicated by holes are discernible. The head has been identified as that of an elephant. 14. G 15348; L. 1107 (Type Ble; Fig. 14:11; PL 5:9). Extremely thick head of animal, with broken mouth and holes denoting the eyes. The figurine has a morphological resemblance to a bear. 15. E3/15721; L. 1933 (Type Big; Fig. 14:14; PL 5:12,17). Flat head with a wide, elongated mouth, broadening slightly at its tip. The eyes are indicated by a clay application, and they are particularly prominent. The head has been identified as that of a hippopotamus. 16. G 11968; L. 999 (Type Big; Fig. 14:15; PL 5:13,18). Flat head with a wide, elongated mouth. The mouth is open and nostrils are indicated. Stumps of horns or ears pointing upwards, with oval cross-section, are preserved. The head has been identified as that of a hippopotamus. 17. H 5105; L. 1012 (Type Big; PL 5:14). Very defective head. Comparison with the two preceding examples leads to the conclusion that this too is the head of a hippopotamus. 18. E3/19275; Surf. (Type Bll; Fig. 14:12; PL 5:10). Animal's head with a long, crooked mouth, extending downward. The ears are pricked. No further details are indicated. This head has been identified as that of a camel. 19. El/5827; L. 680A (Type Blm; Fig. 14:13; PL 5:11). Hollow head of animal. Presumably part of a zoomorphic vessel. The prominent feature is the eyes, formed by the application of clay circles within a recess, with a circle of white paint around them. Red dots painted within the circle represent eye- lashes. The large eyes and emphasized eyelashes suggest that this is the head of an ostrich. The rich variety of animal species represented by the figurines points to the Jerusalemites' great famil- iarity with the faunai life of Palestine of that period. The artist who created the figurines indicated few features; however, these were sufficiently character- istic to define the species. The assemblage of figurines also points to the diversity of the wildlife of Palestine in biblical times. 86</page><page sequence="94">APPENDIX C: THE TECHNOLOGY AND PROVENIENCE OF THE FIGURINES FROM THE CITY OF DAVID: PETROGRAPHIC ANALYSIS Yuval Goren Institute of Archaeology, Tel Aviv University Elisheva Kamaiski Israel Antiquities Authority Raz Kletter Israel Antiquities Authority An assemblage of figurines from the City of David was examined petrographically. The assemblage is the largest collection of such artifacts ever to be discovered in a single site in Israel. The uniformity of their material, as well as their typology, raised some questions about the methods and location of their production. The pétrographie study of these figurines was therefore oriented towards these problems. METHOD The technological examination of the figurines consisted of three stages: 1. The whole assemblage was rudimentarily examined with the aid of a xlO magnifying glass, in order to obtain a preliminary classification of the different raw materials. 2. Representative samples from each of the above-mentioned preliminary classes were examined under a stereoscopic microscope, at magnifications ranging from xlO to x40, in order to define the degree of variability within each technological group. At this stage, samples were chosen for pétrographie examination. 3. Fifteen thin sections were prepared from samples which were chosen at stage 2. The thin sections were examined under a polarizing pétro- graphie microscope, at magnifications ranging from x40 to x400. A detailed list of the thin sections inventory is presented in Table 1. Following the pétrographie study, an attempt was made to reconstruct the production methods of the Iron Age figurines, using similar materials and methods as those observed through the thin section study. The clay and temper types defined by petrography as characterizing the major group of the figurines, were collected, mixed and used for the production of modern replicas that were examined by similar methods. This study supplied additional information as to the production methods of the original specimens. RESULTS A. Petrography Even at the preliminary stage of examination it became clear that technologically the assemblage of figurines from the City of David is very uniform. In most cases silty loam was used as clay, with the addition of sand and/or vegetal material ('straw') as a tempering component. A dark core, indicating in this case a relatively low firing temperature, is very common in this dominant technological group. Nevertheless, in some instances other raw materials occurred, providing evidence for different locations or methods of production. The detailed results of the microscopic examinations are described in Table 1. The following discussion summarizes the princi- pal conclusions. The plastic component of the dominant group, consisting of silty clay, rich in iron minerals, is similar in composition and appearance to the terra rossa soil which is com- monly exposed in Judah, Samaria and the Galilee. This soil, together with wadi sand, crushed calcite crystals or grog, was frequently used by Iron Agë potters in Judah as a céramic raw material, especially for the production of cooking pots. On the other hand, since terra rossa soils are very abundant in these regions, no specific archaeologi- cal site can be suggested as their source. Further- more, at the present stage of our knowledge, we may define the Iron Age ceramic production as a 87</page><page sequence="95">Table 1. Inventory of the thin sections. Reg.

Dark (reduced) core. well-established and uniform tradition, as may also be seen from the typological affinities of this pottery. In this case, the technological similarity between the individual items of this assemblage does not necessarily point to a single center of produc- tion, though this possibility is reasonable. Besides this dominant pétrographie group, other raw materials were identified in the figurine assemblage from the City of David. These groups appear as a minor component in the complex. In one instance (G 4860), fine well-levigated clay occurred, together with brown and light shales. This clay resembles the gray member of the Motsa formation, but a definite identification cannot be achieved in this case due to the high firing temperature, which caused a partial vitrification of the matrix. The absence of any other identifiable components, such as rock fragments or larger mineral crystals, prevent any attempt at further interpretation. Another pétrographie group is represented by Dl/1140, in which both clay and temper point to the use of hamra soil as a raw material. Since hamra is typical mainly of the inner coastal plain of Israel, the provenance of this figurine is probably one of the sites located in this region. B. Comparative Study of Modern Replicas In light of the pétrographie data, an attempt was made to reconstruct the ancient production techni- ques by using similar raw materials and methods. Terra rossa soil was collected from two locations: A) an in situ exposure of this soil which has developed on a dolomitic outcrop of the Bina Formation near Har Hotzvim, Jerusalem (Israel grid ref. 169.134); and B) a deposit of translocated soil from near the channel of the nearby Soreq Valley. The clay samples were sieved in order to extract the coarse non-plastic components and immersed in water for several days. Salt was added 88</page><page sequence="96">to the water in order to obtain the whitish coating which appears in many of the ancient specimens. Chopped straw, which forms the common non- plastic component of the original figurines, was added in various proportions. These mixtures were left under a wet towel in order to obtain the desired mixing. The preliminary pétrographie examination of the mixed raw materials indicated that only the translocated terra rossa soil corresponded with the ancient raw materials. This was due to the fact that the in situ soil was devoid of any silt characteristic of the original materials. Therefore, only the mixture of the Soreq River soil was used for the creation of the figurine replicas. These were made by one of the authors (E.K.), a potter, by attaching a clay cylinder to a molded head and two coils representing the hands. The replicas were left in shade for slow drying and then fired in an electric kiln at a temperature of 7000°C for several hours. Pétrographie analysis of the modern replicas indicated that generally they accorded well with the original artifacts. However, some differences were observed: A. The modern replicas exhibited darker shades than the original objects. This may be explained by post-depositional processes, such as carbonate diffusion and re-crystallization, which commonly occur in pottery deposited in the relatively calcar- eous soils of the Judean Mountains. B. There was an almost complete lack of dark cores in the modern replicas, as compared to the common cores in the ancient figurines. This is probably due to the use of the electric kiln, in which the firing process was gradual and took place for a longer time than that of the original objects. This caused the almost complete disappearance of organic matter, leaving only traces of charred material to form a very faint core. CONCLUSIONS According to the pétrographie data, the figurine assemblage from the City of David is technologi- cally homogeneous in both the choice of raw materials and their treatment. Apart from a few items, all are characterized by the mixture of terra rossa soils with sand, straw and/or calcite crystals, and a low firing temperature. On the basis of the pétrographie data and the comparative study of modern replicas, it is impossible to suggest a specific site as their sole manufacturing center, but the uniformity in production methods raises the possi- bility that such a center existed, perhaps in the region of Judah. 89</page><page sequence="97">APPENDIX D: CHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THE CITY OF DAVID FIGURINES AND INFERENCES ABOUT THEIR ORIGIN Joseph Yellin Institute of Archaeology The Hebrew University of Jerusalem INTRODUCTION Eighteen figurines from the City of David repre- senting 14 different types were examined by neutron activation analysis (NAA). The object of this examination was to shed some light on the origin of the figurines. This report deals with the chemical composition and probable origin of the figurines. A large number of anthropomorphic and animal figurines was recovered in the City of David excavations in 1978-1985; no other site has yielded so many figurines. Their typology and distribution, and pétrographie thin section analysis bearing on the origin of the figurines and the technology of their production, are reported on above. The question of the origin of the figurines may shed light on their function, and this was the main reason for characterizing the figurines chemically. Table 1 summarizes the details of the 18 specimens ana- lyzed. METHOD The method employed has been described elsewhere (Perlman and Asaro 1969; Yellin et al. 1978; Yellin 1984) and will not be presented here. For further details on how the method has been applied in conjunction with pétrographie analysis to other City of David finds, see Maeir et al. 1992. ANALYTICAL RESULTS Table 2 gives the analytical results for each figurine sampled. Table 3 gives the summary statistics for the 18 samples, from which it may be seen that the composition is not uniform. As the number of samples is small, it may be seen by inspection that there are two groups and seven loner compositions, two of which may be related. This is verified in Tables 4 and 5, in which summary statistics are given for the two proposed chemical groups, gl (six figurines) and g2 (five figurines). A summary of the statistics for the seven remaining compositions is given in Table 6; what this shows is that they do not constitute a chemical group, as the dispersion in composition is too large. Graph la, a bar graph that shows the dissimilarity in the compositions of groups gl and g2, also shows the composition of a chemical group of pottery from Jerusalem and the vicinity. Graph lb shows the compositional pattern of the three groups of pottery shown in Graph la. The units for Graphs la and lb of the vertical (concentration) axis are parts per million (PPM), except for Ca, Fe, K and Na, which are percen- tages (%). Graph 2 is a bivariate plot of Sm vs. Fe for the two groups gl and g2 and remaining samples, from which it may be seen that the 18 compositions may be deconvoluted into two small fairly homogeneous groups plus a number of outliers. The ellipses shown represent 68% con- fidence intervals, i.e., an object whose composition falls within one of the ellipses has a 0.68 probability of belonging to the group encircled by the ellipse (though it should be borne in mind that two elements alone are not sufficient to define a chemical group). Those figurines that are assigned to group gl are shown as solid circles, while those assigned to group g2 are shown as solid squares. Other analyses, e.g. other elements plotted against Fe, support the conclusion that two groups and seven other compositions are represented in the 18 figurines sampled. 90</page><page sequence="98">Graph la.

Note, for example, in Graphs la and lb that for most trace elements the concentration of group gl is greater than that of group g2. This is seen most clearly in Graph 3, where Eu is plotted as a function of Ca for all 18 samples, and in other similar bivariate plots (not shown). With the exception of the sample CDF8, the Eu concentra- tion is seen to be a linear function of the Ca concentration, exactly what is expected if Ca (i.e. calcite) is a dilutant. Indeed, if we dilute the concentration of chemical group gl by 20% we obtain the composition of chemical group g2. The varied compositions of all the samples are due to dilution. When all elements are taken into account, the composition of CDF8 exhibits a concentration pattern similar to that of all other figurines, as may be seen in Graphs 4a and 4b. In fact, the element concentrations of CDF8 are depressed by 60% relative to group gl, and may be brought into agreement with group gl by a factor of 2.54. It would be interesting to examine CDF8 petrogra- phically to see what is causing the 60% depression in element concentration. The composition of a reference group character- izing Jerusalem shown in Graphs la and lb has also been shown to match the composition of samples from the Motsa Clay formation. The Jerusalem reference group is seen to parallel the composition of groups gl and g2. However, there are notable differences that cannot be reconciled on the basis of dilution: Cr, Hf, Na, Ni and U are greatly depressed in the Jerusalem group, while Cs, Rb and Se are greatly enhanced. Nevertheless, simila- rities in composition are striking, suggesting that there is a close relationship between the figurine compositions and the Motsa clay formation. Those differences that do exist between the Jerusalem reference group and the figurines may be the consequence of additives employed in manufacture, e.g. temper that has trace impurities. The composi- tions of the Jerusalem group along with groups gl and g2 are given in Table 7. The pattern of the Jerusalem group also parallels the composition of the outliers. Thus a single geological region is indicated, and that region is Jerusalem and the vicinity. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS We are dealing here with a variety of compositions related by dilution which reflect either a clay source of variable Ca composition or different techniques of pottery manufacture, e.g. variation in the amount of temper used by the potters. Silica (sand) also acts as a dilutant, but we do not see Si in NAA. The conclusion based on pétrographie analysis (Appendix C) that the figurines are homogeneous is not necessarily at odds with the opposite conclusion that is based on NAA, since different criteria of homogeneity are employed in the two methods. Homogeneity in petrography is based on visual observation and involves such parameters as grain size, types of inclusions and types of minerals. Chemical homogeneity is precisely defined in terms of the root-mean-square deviation (St. Dev. in Tables 3-7) exhibited by the composition of a group of pottery. Given the composition of a ceramic artifact, it is possible to calculate the probability that it came or did not come from a given place. Furthermore, regrettably the figurines analyzed by NAA were not those analyzed petrographically. When different methods of analysis are employed in order to maximize knowledge about artifacts, the same artifacts should be analyzed by the different methods (Goldberg et al. 1986; Porat et al. 1991; Maeir et al. 1992). Unfortunately, the analysts are all too often unaware of each other and hence different objects are often analyzed by the different analysts, leading to inconclusive or confusing results. The interpretation of the figurine compositions in terms of origin was based on univariate and bivariate analysis. In the former element concentra- tions are regarded as independent variables, while in the latter some inter-element correlation is recog- nized. For example, there are strong correspon- dences among the rare earth elements, and consequently regarding such elements as indepen- dent variables leads to redundancies. One way to get around such correlations is to make a coordinate transformation from n element concentrations to n linear combinations of element concentrations, with the constraint that the combinations must be mutually orthogonal in the mathematical sense. The new variables thus obtained are independent. One procedure for carrying out such a transforma- tion of coordinates is known as principal compo- nent analysis.

Principal component analysis of City of David figurines based on rare earths measured. carried out, it is found that most of the statistical information is contained in the first few new variables. Graph 5 shows the first two principal components (PCs) for groups gl and g2, in which the PCs are based only on the rare earths measured. The ellipses shown represent 68% confidence intervals. The two groups are seen to be well separated in PC space, thus lending weight to the more elementary analysis presented above.

The excavation areas do not constitute a random sample of the site of Jerusalem, and consequently the figurines re- trieved from them cannot strictly speaking form a random sample of the entire population of figurines in Jerusalem in the relevant periods. Nevertheless, we assume that this sample is representative of the site as a whole. This assumption is supported by the broad homogeneity of the distribution of the figurines across the different excavation areas (see below). The size of the sample from each stratum is largely influenced by the area of exposure and the state of preservation, both of which factors greatly vary between strata in the City of David. Thus differences in the total number of figurines in each stratum in no way represent actual differences in the volume of figurine production between periods. For example, the fact that there are very few figurines in Stratum 13 may indeed be due to a low rate of figurine production, but may equally well be attributed to smaller exposure or a general lower density of artifacts in deposits of this stratum, or a combination of any of the above. The tests used here are designed to detect differences in the distribution of types within strata, taking into account the given sample size from each stratum. The data were analyzed independently of either stratigraphical or typological analysis. For the definition of what constitutes a given stratum and which period it represents, or the argumentation for grouping a certain set of figurines under a given 'type' label, the reader is referred to the relevant chapters. For the purpose of the statistical analysis, we grouped together all sub-strata of 10 (10, 10B, 10C, 10B/C) in order to ensure chronological ordinality between the stratigraphical categories. We also grouped together in one category ('Unstratified') all of the figurines which did not come from Strata 10, 11, 12 or 13. Note that this category includes figurines that do belong in the Strata 13-10 horizon, but do not have an exact stratigraphical proveni- ence (e.g. 'Strata 107/11?' or '9-10') as well as figurines from non-stratigraphical contexts ('Stra- tum' '-' or '0') and ones which are obviously out of context (e.g. Stratum 4). The number of figurines from Stratum 13 is too small for meaningful statistics to be calculated and consequently this stratum was excluded from the analysis, though it will be briefly commented on below. Some of the types (or sub-types within the main categories) are present only in small numbers in the sample. This might not only disqualify the quanti- tative estimates for these categories, but impair the validity of the analysis as a whole, as will be explained below. Such categories were therefore dropped from the analysis altogether (e.g. sub-type A4 of Type A, of which only two examples exist) or combined with other small categories (e.g. Types D, E, F and M, comprising together 50 pieces, or less than 3% of the total sample, which were combined under the 'Others' heading in the analysis of major types). Some of the category designations in the typology do not refer to determinable morphological var- iants, but merely to missing classification criteria (usually in the case of figurine fragments). Cases in point are 'Type' D (unidentified pieces) or 'sub- type' A3, which consists of torsos belonging to figurines of sub-types Al or A2 (which can only be 100</page><page sequence="108">differentiated by the treatment of the head). Such designations also necessitated special treatment, which will be referred to below. All analyses were performed four times. First we analyzed the general typological categories (A, B, C and 'Others') (Graph 1 and Tables 2.1-4). Within the group of human figurines (Type A) two different questions were explored. The two most numerous forms are pillar figurines and depiction of horse- riders. Each of these forms can appear with one of two different treatments of the head - moldmade or handmade ('pinched'). Accordingly, Table 3.1 was split two ways and analyzed twice - once for moldmade heads vs. 'pinched' heads (Graph 2 and Tables 3.2-3) and once for pillar figurines (of all kinds) vs. horse-riders (Graph 3 and Tables 3.4-5. Within Type B we compared the amount of horses (B2) to all other animals (Bl). The third category (B3) comprised mostly indeterminable animal pieces and was ignored (Graph 4 and Tables 4.1-3). The rest of the types do not have sub-type categories. No analysis of sub-sub-types was attempted because the number of cases within each sub-category is too small for any meaningful quantitative analysis. The raw data, as presented in Tables 2.1, 3.1 and 4.1, were thus transformed, by a combination of combining and dropping categories as needed, into the concatenated tables (2.2, 3.2, 3.4 and 4.2), upon which statistical analysis was performed. Note that as a result of this process the total number of figurines participating in each analysis varies slightly in different analyses, as well as between this appendix and the catalogue. PROCEDURE The data analysis method used here is residual analysis. Its purpose is to test homogeneity or heterogeneity in the relative frequency of types within the different strata. The homogeneity hy- pothesis (H0) is that the shape of the frequency curve for the types under analysis is the same in all strata, and hence also the same as the shape of the general distribution over all strata combined. These general distributions for all strata combined (usual- ly referred to as 'marginal distributions') are given in Tables 1.1-2 as well as the total column in Tables 2.1-2, 3.1-2, 3.4 and 4.1-2. The purpose of the analysis is to assess the likelihood of the assertion that the deviations from this hypothesis are entirely random. The first step is the calculation of expected values for each of the contingency tables being analyzed. The expected value, given within square brackets in each cell of Tables 2.2, 3.2 3.4 and 4.2, is what we would expect to find there if the assumption of complete homogeneity were true. For example: we know (Table 1.2) that 19% of all figurines in the City of David are of Type A. We also know that the total number of figurines in Stratum 11 is 132 (Table 1.1). Under conditions of complete homo- geneity, i.e., if the distribution in each of the strata is exactly the same as the general (marginal) distribu- tion for the site, we would expect to find approxi- mately 25 Type A figurines in Stratum 11 (19% of 132). This is the meaning of the number 25.4 which appears in brackets at the top of the second column in Table 2.2, next to the number of figurines of that type actually found in the stratum (23). The question at this point becomes one of evaluating whether the difference between the expected value (25) and the observed one (23) is due to some inherent heterogeneity among the strata. Naturally, even if our zero hypothesis were true, we would not expect every reading in the observed table to be exactly the same as the expected value, because of stochastic variation. However, the greater the homogeneity between the strata, the closer the observed values to the expected value. In the second step we calculate the deviation between the observed values and the expected values under the homogeneity hypothesis, stated in ap- proximate standard deviation units. The standardi- zation is done by the standardized residual method (Upton 1978: 23-26, 90-91), and hence the name residual analysis for this statistical technique. To calculate the standardized residual for each cell in the table we figure out the difference between the actual (observed) number of figurines in this cell and the expected value, and then divide it by the square root of the expected value. This standardization is based on a statistical theorem which states that in a multinomially distributed population the distribution of the standardized residual is approximately standard normal. In mathematical formulation the above two paragraphs may be expressed as: O i ; - E ¡ j Si J = i Jr-r^'J ; ¡ j * N(0,1) V 'J where Oļ j is the observed value in row i of column j and Eļj is the corresponding expected value. Note 101</page><page sequence="109">that this is the only use of a statistical theorem in this discussion, and this is the only time that any assumption is made as to the shape or nature of the distribution of the population, in contrast with much heavier use of such in parametric statistics. The use of the term 'approximately normal' needs further explanation. What the above theorem actually shows is that the distribution of the standardized residual rapidly approaches a standard normal distribution as the total sample size is increased. The answer to when is 'approximate' close enough depends, of course, on individual taste. However, most statisticians agree that if the expected value is less than 5, this approximation is insufficient. In a case where the observed number of figurines in a table cell is exactly as expected under the homogeneity hypothesis, the standard residual will be 0. A standard residual of more than 2.0 means that the probability that the deviation is merely stochastic is less than 5%. In other words, if we were to build a random simulation model in which the numbers in each cell vary normally around the expected value, we would obtain a residual of 2.0 or more in only one out of twenty cases. The probability of a chance residual of over 2.6 is only 1%, etc. The translation of standard residuals into probability percentages may be carried out by using a 'z' table for standard normal distribution. When a statistical test yields an alpha value (probability of obtaining the test statistic under the null hypothesis H0) of less than 5%, it is customary to call the result significant (i.e., it is unlikely that such a deviation is merely random, and the null hypothesis - in our case the homogeneity hypothesis - should be rejected). A value of less than 1 % is called highly significant. In the example we have been pursuing, we may look at Table 2.3 and see at the top of the second column the value -0.5. This means that the deviation between the observed number of Type A figurines in Stratum 1 1 (23 figurines) and the value expected in the case of complete homogeneity (25.4) is half of a standard deviation. The minus sign denotes that the observed value is less than expected. These figures mean that if in reality Type A figurines constitute 19% of the assemblage in the period represented by Stratum 1 1 (i.e. the same percentage as the marginal distribution), there is a 60% likelihood that a random sample of 132 figurines will deviate by at least 2 figurines from the expected value of 25. An alpha value of 60% is far from significant, and one would not be justified in saying that this result proves that there is a real difference in the frequency of Type A figurines between strata. The third step of the analysis is to check whether the whole table deviates significantly from the homogeneity hypothesis. This is done by Pearson's chi-square test. The Pearson test statistic is: X2 = a *2([r-l]*[c-l]) ¿=1 j= 1 where Sitj are all the standardized residuals in the table. It can be shown as a corollary to the above- mentioned theorem that the distribution of X2 is approximately the chi-squared distribution with [r- 1] x [c-1] degrees of freedom (r and c are the number of rows and columns in the table). The larger the value of X2 for a given table, the smaller the chance that the difference between the observed table and the expected table is merely stochastic. For the translation of X2 values to probabilities (alpha values) use a chi-square table with the appropriate degrees of freedom. Under Tables 2.3, 3.3, 3.5 and 4.3 are the Pearson X2 values for each table and the corresponding alpha values. Example: in Table 2.3 we obtained an X2 value of 19.48, which gives (for a 4 x 4 table) an alpha value of 2.1%. This means that there is a probability of approximately 2% (1 case out of 50) that all the deviations from the homogeneity hypothesis (as noted in Table 2.2) are purely random. This probability is significant, though not highly so. Thus there is some justification for the assertion that, on the whole, there are some non- random differences in the distribution of major types among the different strata, and that our initial hypothesis of homogeneity is not likely. Note that whereas we saw in Table 2.3 that the deviation of Type A figurines in Stratum 11 from the expected value is not significant, there are some highly significant categories in that table: i.e., there are significantly less Type A figurines in Stratum 12 than one would expect, and significantly more Type C figurines in Stratum 10. An apparent contradiction between the second and third step of the analysis merits an additional comment. Is it possible that one or more categories in a given table can be significantly deviant from the expected cell value, and yet the table as a whole be homogeneous? The answer is yes. To explain this, let us look at an analogy. Any gambler knows that 102</page><page sequence="110">the chance of getting three aces in a poker hand are pretty slim. However, there is a good chance that in a game of, say, 100 hands, a hand containing three aces will appear at least once. By analogy, in a table with 4x4=16 cells the chances that there will be at least one significantly deviant cell (at the 5% level) are actually much higher than 1 in 20. The opposite (a table in which no single residual exceeds 2.0, but which is nevertheless heterogeneous) is also possi- ble. Let us again consider the poker analogy: it is perfectly probable, in any five-card deal, to obtain at least a pair. Yet if your opponent has never dealt himself a zilch in a 100-hand game, then you might be justified in suspecting some non-random shuffle. The correct procedure for the analysis is as follows. First, calculate the X2 for the table as a whole. Only if that is significant (i.e., there is a high likelihood of non-random deviation in the table as a whole) should one look at the individual cell residuals to see in which categories this deviation is concen- trated. In the case in point (Table 2.3), the X2 value indicates a significant deviation from homogeneity. In the fourth and last step of the analysis we shall try to locate the source of this heterogeneity. Examination of Table 2.3 shows that high residuals occur in Types C and A. Type C is a rather esoteric category (numerically and theologically) and one would be hard pressed to argue some religious reform between Strata 12-11 and Stratum 10 on the basis only of an increase in furniture figurines. Is there, then, a significant difference between Strata 12-11 and 10 if only the major categories (anthropomorphic vs. zoo- morphic) are considered and the furniture category is excluded from the analysis? Examination of Types A and B from stratified contexts only (Table 2.4) reveals a potentially more consequential deviation from our original assump- tion of homogeneity: there is a systematic increase in the proportion of Type A (human) figurines from Stratum 12 to Stratum 10, accompanied by a corresponding decrease in Type B (animals). This pattern can clearly be seen in the residual table (2.3) in that there is a significant negative residual (-2.3) for Type A in Stratum 12 - i.e., the observed number (45) is considerably lower than that expected by the assumption of homogeneity (63.2); the amount in Stratum 11 is about as expected (residual of -0.5); while that of Stratum 10 is higher than expected (residual of +1.4). The opposite pattern is evident when examining the residuals for Type B. The X2 values attached to Table 2.4 should be used with some caution. A table which on the whole displays only random variations may nevertheless have some sub-table which appears to deviate significantly from the zero (homogeneity) hypoth- esis. The argumentation for this assertion is exactly the same as used above to explain why the deviation of a complete table cannot be assessed merely on the basis of its most deviant category. Several procedures exist for the simultaneous testing of sub-tables within a given table (e.g. Gabriel 1966). This test, which is based on the likelihood-ratio statistic and will not be discussed here in detail, was used on Table 2.2 to determine whether its heterogeneity resulted only from Type C, from the systematic increase in Type A, or from both. It was found that both effects contribute to the heterogeneity in the table, and that the change in the ratio of anthropomorphic vs. zoomorphic figurines, while not as high as the X2 value in Table 2.4, is nevertheless significant (i.e., is not likely to be a random effect). We have discussed above the problem of non- applicability of this test to cells with low frequen- cies. The same problem exists with Pearson's X2 statistic. It is usually considered that if the table contains expected values of less than 1.0, or the expected values for more than 20% of the cells in a given table are below 5, then the test is inapplicable. For this reason, we have had to delete, or agglomerate together, categories for which the sample is small. RESULTS With the exception of Table 2, which was analyzed in detail above, there is an uncanny resemblance between the observed distribution of figurines (Graphs 1-4) and the distribution as predicted by the homogeneous model (Tables 3.2, 3.4, 4.2), which is visible at a glance. The X2 test shows that none of the four tables significantly contradicts the homo- geneity hypothesis. The residual analysis shows that no cell in any of the other tables contains any significant deviations, and that the alpha values for Tables 3.3, 3.5 and 4.3 are, as a matter of fact, surprisingly high. We discussed above the problems caused by low expected values in many categories. Note that in 103</page><page sequence="111">Tables 3.2 and 3.4 more than 20% of the categories have expected values of less than 5. This is due to the low number of figurines of the relevant types in Stratum 11. This problem might be rectified by dropping Stratum 1 1 from these analyses altogether, or by agglomerating it with Stratum 10 or 12. In our case, the underlying research question is to test for a radical change in figurine production and use which purportedly happened between Stratum 11 and 10, and so the latter course would be sensible. This analysis did not display any significant difference either, and consequently it will not be shown here in detail. The apparent anomaly in Stratum 11 in Graph 2 is merely the result of small sample size. There are only four human figurines with heads intact in Stratum 1 1, of which two are 'pinched' and two are moldmade, whereas the expected values in the case of complete homogeneity would have been three and one respectively. The figurines from Stratum 13 were not included in the quantitative analysis due to small sample size. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to ask whether the figurine distribution in Stratum 13 is similar to those of Strata 12-10. As mentioned above, the reason for the small absolute number of figurines in Stratum 13 is outside the scope of this analysis. Taking this total sample size into consideration, however, we can see that the distribution of figurines in Stratum 13 fits the homogeneous model quite well. Perusal of Table 5 will show that in a total sample of 5, the 'ideal' distribution would have been 4 of Type B and 1 of Type A. Although one should not use the standardized residuals in this case as accurate measures of deviation (because the expected values are less than 5), the differences between the observed distribution and the expected theoretical one are minimal. It certainly would not be likely in a sample of this size for any of the types but A and B to be represented at all. Similarly, one might ask whether the agglomera- tion of Types E, F and M into a single catchall category has not masked any significant deviation in the distribution of these types. Table 6 shows that there no marked deviations from homogeneity among Types E, F and M, though the statistical significance of this is impossible to assess, due to small sample size. 'Type' D was not included in this analysis, for it is merely a collection of unidentifi- able pieces. An unstated assumption of ours has been that all of the unstratified figurines are originally from Strata 13-10 and have been shifted as a result of redeposition processes. The results of this analysis confirm this assumption. Specifically, the fact that no figurine of Type A4 or A6 was found in situ may well be a coincidence. Since processes of construc- tion and destruction at the site have shifted potsherds (and figurines) in a stochastic fashion, the distribution of unstratified figurines should reflect the combined distribution of their parent populations. A significant deviation between the distribution of unstratified figurines and the dis- tribution of Strata 13-10 figurines would have indicated the existence of an additional source 'donating' figurines to the 'pool' of unstratified figurines. It is possible of course that such a source outside Strata 13-10 does exist, and that the distribution of its figurines is homogeneous with that of Strata 13-10. Such a source would be invisible as far as this analysis is concerned. CONCLUSIONS This analysis points to the existence of homogeneity in the distribution of figurine types between Strata 10 and 13, with a single notable exception - a marked increase in the production of human (vs. animal) figurines in the later strata. What are the possible explanations for this homogeneity? First of all we must consider the possibility that the lack of apparent differences between strata is a result of a high rate of redeposition. One of the prominent findings is the large number of figurines (about half the sample) found out of context. A large number of these were found in definitely non- Iron Age strata, and are certainly the result of redeposition. This being so, we have to assume that at least some of the figurines which were found in Stratum 40, for instance, are redeposi ted pieces which originated in, say, Stratum 11. A high proportion of redeposition will tend to blur real differences between strata. This might best be explained in an example. Let us assume that in Period X the distribution of thingamajig types is: Type A - 40%; Type B - 60%. In Period Y Type A accounts for 70% of the assemblage and Type B for 30%. However, if half the thingamajigs in Stratum X are redeposited Stratum Y pieces, then the observed distribution for Stratum X will be 55% for Type A and 45% for Type B. The apparent difference between Stratum X and Stratum Y will be much smaller than the actual one. 104</page><page sequence="112">To discount redeposition effects, we might con- sider only complete figurines which came from floors or other primary contexts. Of course, there are not enough of these to merit a statistical study, and so such an analysis is outside the domain of the present appendix. Against the above, we must state that redeposi- tion may blur, but will never completely blot out, real differences between strata. Also, in very large samples such as that from the City of David, even small differences between strata should give sig- nificant results. We must conclude, therefore, that the evidence from the City of David lends no support to a postulation of an iconoclastic reform between the 8th and 6th centuries BCE.

Ariel Israel Antiquities Authority The figurine (K 18330; Fig. 18:9; Fig. 20; PI. 9:6-7) is apparently an almost complete crude container. It derives from L. 2200B of Stratum 2 which, though designated as Islamic- Ayyubid (7th-13th centuries CE), is restricted in Square K1 of Area K to the 7th and 8th centuries CE (Magness 1992: 161). It was inadvertently omitted from the Index of Loci in Ariel and Magness 1992. The ware of the fragment is a uniform pale buff (Munsell 2.5 YR 8/3) without visible inclusions. It is hollow and could have contained a very small amount of liquid, poured through the hole at its top (8 mm wide in its present state of preservation). The walls are very thick, as if the inner space was crudely hollowed out through the original opening higher up, or was first hollowed out and the neck and rim attached afterwards. Another alternative is that it was made around a core which was incinerated during firing; because of the vessel's crude manu- facture, we have no evidence for this last alternative. The body of the fragment is decorated with two diametrically opposed depictions of faces. Though worn and poorly preserved, they were apparently mold-pressed onto the body, either with two separate molds applied simultaneously or possibly with the same mold. The preserved details of the faces make it certain that if different molds were used, then the intention was to depict the same face. Our description of the faces therefore com- bines information from better preserved features of both. A stylized 'headdress' surrounds the face and is depicted by one row of connected beads, continuing down to the top of the jaws and hiding the ears. The 'headdress' and the absence of any beard suggest that these are female faces. Eyelids, eyes and lips are crudely indicated. The expression of the poorly preserved lips may be interpreted in the range between a grimace and a smile. The faces surmount a splaying base, which is the neck for both faces. The base is crudely concave, and as such is not at all stable in its current state of preservation. No attempt was made to connect the 'headdress' of both faces or to connect between the two opposing faces in the areas of the neck or top of the head. On one side, at the level of where the ear would have been, the beginning of what appears to have been a ribbon handle is found. Above the 'headdress' the forehead tapers up to the break at the preserved opening. There is no indication of where the apparent ribbon handle was attached at the top. Ceramic figurines of this size depicting, among other things, female faces are common not only in the Israelite but also in the Greco-Roman worlds. However, the details of our faces do not resemble closely any of these ubiquitous figurines. Moreover, the use of a two-faced decoration is extremely rare. Fig. 20. K 18330. Ceramic figurine from L. 2200B: view of opposing face to Fig. 18:9 (left) and P1.9:6. 109</page><page sequence="117">The only two-faced female figurines from the 1st millennium BCE known to us are from the 8th-6th centuries from Amman (Amr 1988). They are made of stone and bear little resemblance to this ceramic fragment. In the Greco-Roman world, the closest ceramic parallel to this fragment is a well-defined group of small vessels, dated to the 2nd-3rd centuries or the first half of the 3rd century CE. The vessels depict different faces on the same vessel. These are variously identified as males (sometimes mustached or bearded), females, mythical figures or gods. In cases where the provenance is known, all but one (from Cyprus - Parasolia?) derive from Egypt (Ohnefalsch-Richter 1893: PL 93:3; Pagenstecher 1913: 211-12, PL 37:2a-2b; Breccia 1934: Vol. 2, Nos. 623?, 626; Bayer-Niemeier 1988: 284, Nos. 762-63; Schürmann 1989: 279, No. 1056; Dunand 1990: 325-27, Nos. 982-89; my thanks to Adi Erlich for bringing my attention to these vessels). The predominant sub-group comprises open vessels with crude 'basket' handles and depicts two male figures, one possibly Dionysus and the other a mustached male. A smaller group (Dunand 1990: 326-27, Nos. 987-89) are also open vessels, but have no handles. They bear the same face on either side, described as feminine or Dionysiac. These parallels, though more similar to the Area K fragment in material, stratigraphie date and function than the Amman figurines, are still quite different, especially since they are open vessels. In fact, the fragment from Area K is closest in form, style, provenance and date to a well-documented group of glass flasks. This group (sometimes referred to as 'Janiform' flasks) has recently been summarized by Barag (1988: 93, No. 118; see also Smith 1957: 110, 14M7, Nos. 279-94). The flasks probably functioned as unguentaria containing small quantities of valuable liquids (de Ridder 1909: 157, No. 279). Barag believes that production of glass flasks with two faces, or masks, began in the last third of the 1st century CE. Other flasks have been dated as late as the late 4th to early 5th centuries CE (Harden 1936: 214, No. 169, and n. 1), on the basis of the appearance of Christian monograms molded on their bases. One unpublished example is on exhibit at the Rockefeller Museum (P. A.M. 42.11). A flask of this type (without monogram) was found in what was described as a clear Byzantine context at Tell Malhata (Eldar and Nahlieli 1982: 41). The first discussion of the two-faced glass flasks appears in Kisa 1908: 753-55. Kisa explained that they were mold-blown, generally 8-10 cm high, and very rare, being made by Sidonian, Syrian, Alexan- drian and Italian artists. There were a variety of depictions on the flasks and an even greater variety of identifications of the faces depicted (Hadrian and Antonous; two Medusas; smiling and crying faces; woman and child). Two details link our ceramic fragment to these glass flasks. First, the distinctive 'headdress' is characteristic of some of the female faces (see Kisa 1908: 730-31, Figs. 293-94; Saldern et al. 1974: 170, Nos. 464-66 - all one-faced flasks). This 'headdress' is probably the remnant of the grape cluster decoration found on some flasks surrounding the faces. Second, the ribbon handle stemming from the area where the ear would have been is also found in glass flasks (see Kisa 1908: 740, Fig. 297; Saldern et al. 1974: 170, No. 462 - also one-faced flasks). Both features are common in glass media. The ceramic fragment from Area K is thus in all likelihood an imitation of the more valuable and rare two-faced glass flasks. Although the closest parallels noted begin in the 2nd century and extend to the late 4th-early 5th centuries CE, the date of this probable ceramic imitation cannot be deter- mined with any degree of certainty.

Loomweights and whorls were dis- covered in all of the 16 strata ranging from the Early Bronze Age (Stratum 20) to the 1st century CE (Stratum 5). However, most of them were found in strata dated to the Iron Age. The material is presented in typological order. In the typological system adopted here, an upper-case letter designates the use of the item. A numeral follows, indicating the material of which the item is made. Finally, a lower-case letter indicates the shape. Use A. Loomweight B. Whorl Material 1 . Unfired clay 2. Poorly fired clay 3. Well-fired clay (ceramic) 4. Limestone or dolomite 5. Chalk 6. Basalt Shape a. Spherical with vertical perforation b. Doughnut-shaped with vertical perforation c. Biconical or near-biconical with vertical perfora- tion d. Pyramidal with horizontal perforation e. Ovoid, elongated oval or fiat-based oval with horizontal perforation f. Flat ellipse with two vertical perforations g. Flat rectangle with two vertical perforations h. Disc or discoid with vertical perforation i. Disc or discoid with unfinished perforation (drilled from both sides) j. Lentil-shaped k. Dome-shaped, hemispherical or near-hemi- spherical 1. Conical or near-conical m. Cylindrical or near-cylindrical n. Ring o. Amorphic p. Varia (shapes undefined by other categories) q. Poor state of preservation prevents categorization In the catalogue weight is given in grams. Maximum height and diameter measurements are given in centimeters. The perforation diameter was mea- sured by a digital caliper and the minimal size is given in centimeters. This diameter determines the amount and thickness of threads that could pass through the loomweight (see, however, below), as well as limiting the diameter of the spindle that could enter the whorl. Dimensions are noted only for loomweights or whorls whose state of preserva- tion was adequate for measurement. The clay color was determined according to the Munsell Color Chart (1975). Grit density was estimated as F (few), B (medium) or M (many); color of grits is defined as W (white), Br (brown) and Gr (gray); the size of the grits is given in millimeters. A. LOOMWEIGHTS Perforated clay balls are termed loomweights. They were used to stretch the warp threads in the warp- weighted loom (see, however, the discussion below). The use of the warp-weighted loom has been 135</page><page sequence="143">described by Hoffmann (1974), Broudy (1979), Sheffer (1981) and Shamir (1994b). 1. Unfired Clay Loomweights: Type Al The City of David yielded 135 unfired clay loom- weights from the Iron Age II. These have been divided into the following types: Ala. Spherical or near-spherical (Fig. 21:3). This definition pertains to those loomweights with a ratio of 1:1 between height and diameter (a deviation of up to 1 cm was allowed for in this category). These loomweights all have vertical perforations. Four spherical unfired clay loomweights were found, comprising 3% of the unfired clay loomweights. These were larger than the other unfired clay loomweights, their diameter and height being over 7 cm. Two of the spherical loomweights were found intact. Their weights are: G 17546, 377.8 g; G 15381, 805 g. Alb. Doughnut-shaped (Fig. 21:2,4-13,15-16; Pis. 11:2-5, 12:8-10,12). The City of David yielded 80 doughnut-shaped unfired clay loomweights, com- prising 59.3% of the total. Their diameter is larger than their height and the perforation is vertical. The weights of 32 intact examples of this type ranged from 45.6 to 724.9 g (average 161.9 ± 180.8 g). The higher numbers of Type Alb than Type Ala may be explained by the greater propensity of Type Ala to break due to its spherical shape. Ale. Biconical or near-biconical with a truncated top (Fig. 21:14,17). Five unfired clay loomweights of this type were found at the City of David, comprising 3.7% of the unfired loomweights. The type has a horizontal perforation. The weight range is between 22.8 and 82.9 g (average 57 ± 20.3 g), which is generally lower than the other types. Ale. Ovoid (Fig. 21:1; PI. 11:1). Only two samples of this type were discovered, making up 1.5% of the total unfired loomweights. They are egg-shaped, with a horizontal perforation located in the upper third of the object. One (D 1/1 328 1/2) was found intact; it weighed 468 g. Alo. Amorphic (PI. 12:11; Photo 13). Ten such loomweights were found, comprising 7.4% of the total sample of unfired clay loomweights. Nine were found in L. 1110, while the tenth, G 11996, comes from L. 997; both loci are in Area G. Several of them bear the beginnings of a horizontal perfora- tion. The loomweights from L. 1110 range in weight from 53 to 115 g (average 84.2 ± 19.7 g). Sixteen additional loomweights of other types were found in this locus, all of approximately the same weight. One possible explanation for the shape of this type is that their manufacture was not completed. Alq. Undefined. All the unfired clay loomweights whose poor state of preservation prevented their attribution to any of the above categories are included here; they numbered 34. Material The clay color of the unfired clay loomweights is brown and shades of brown. The material, local terra rossa, includes a large quantity of grits, ranging in size from 1 to 6 mm. In an experiment performed by the author, 35 loomweights were made from terra rossa clay. These loomweights dried quite rapidly in the sun: an average temperature of 25-30°C was sufficient to dry loomweights of adequate quality for weaving. An additional experiment proved that exposure to heavy rain caused these clay balls to disintegrate. This method of manufacture requires no special knowledge. It would have been easy enough to make a new loomweight if one broke or disinte- grated, so that there was no need to invest effort into making them durable. The unfired clay loom- weights found in archaeological excavations thus probably represent only a small percentage of the original quantity, a point discussed, for example, by Elgavish (1968: 33), Curai (1986) and Hoffmann (1974: 314). Shape, Size and Manufacture of Perforation Most of the unfired clay loomweights have a vertical perforation, except for Type Ale, which has a horizontal hole. The perforation diameter varies from 0.5 to 2.1 cm. The larger the hole, the more numerous or thicker were the threads which could be passed through it, unless a loop was used as an intermediary device between the warp threads and the loomweights (see below). The perforations of the unfired clay loomweights from the City of David differ in shape. In our opinion, these variations reflect different manufac- turing techniques. The relationship between the shape of the perforation and its manufacture was examined by the author. The shape definitions in Table 1 are based on those of Beck (1928: 51). Clear proof that the hole was occasionally made from opposite sides comes from Tell Qasile (Shamir 1994b): one of the unfired clay loomweights of Type 136</page><page sequence="144">Table 1. Shape definitions of perforations. Perforation shape Manufacturing technique Examples 1. Plain: equal diameter throughout Stick (or other tool) pushed into one side G 15333 (Fig. 21:2) and removed through the other G 15441 (Fig. 21:15) G 17546 (Fig. 21:3) 2.

Chamfered: both openings are Hole made from both sides G 4867 (Fig. 21:6) conical while in center sides are straight Alb had two perforations on opposite sides that did not meet in the center. Among the City of David loomweights, the perforation is often somewhat off-center. There was no need to be exact, as the placement of the hole has no bearing on the tension of the weave. It is assumed (see also Barber 1991: 92, 104; Shamir 1994a) that in the Iron Age, as in the Hellenistic and Roman periods (see below), a loop was used to connect the warp threads to the loomweights. Stripes of blue color, 2-3 mm wide, were discerned on the sides of the perforation and on the face of loomweights from Tell Qasile (Shamir 1991a; 1994b). They were not painted deliberately and are probably evidence of the dyed loops that passed through the loomweights. Location The following are the main assemblages of unfired clay loomweights found at the City of David. The numbers of loomweights in each locus are given in Table 2. Area Dl, L. 456 (Fig. 21:1,4; PL 11:1). Ten unfired clay loomweights were found in this locus, which is defined as fallen rock debris from W. 535 (or W. 526) and attributed to Stratum 12. Two of these loomweights are ovoid (Type Ale), four are Type Alb, while the rest are undefinable (Alq). Two loomweights were found intact; their weights are Dl/13281/1 (Alb): 160.5 g; Dl/13281/2 (Ale): 468 g. Table 2. Number of loomweights per locus. Area Locus Str.

Five loomweights of Type Alb were found on this floor, belonging to Stratum 12. Two loomweights were found intact; their weights are Dl/13308/1: 111.8 g; Dl/13308/4: 98.8 g (average 105.4 ± 6.5 g). Area G, L . 997 (The ' Burnt Room ') (Fig. 21:7-8; PL 12:8-12). Six burnt loomweights were found in this locus. Four of them are doughnut-shaped (Alb), of which one (G 11948; Fig. 21:7; PL 12:9), weighing 93.7 g, was found intact. The loomweights were found lying on the plaster floor, within the thick ash layer attributed to the destruction dated to 586 BCE (Stratum 10B). Area G, L. 1108 (Fig. 21:2,9-14,17; Photo 13). This locus is an earth and stone fill placed under the stones of W. 753. This wall served as a support for the structures of the upper terrace and was part of the 'House of the Bullae'. In L. 1108, a level of patchy beaten earth with pottery and unfired clay loomweights on it was discerned. L. 1110, 1108 and 986 (where one loomweight was found) are thought to be a fill laid down in Stratum 10C, when the 'House of the Bullae' and W. 753 were constructed. Seventy-three loomweights were found in L. 1108. Three of them are Type Ala; 44 are Type Alb, comprising 59.4% of all the unfired clay loom- weights from this locus. The size range is very large - the heights vary between 2.1 and 7.1 cm, while the diameters range from 3.8 to 9.4 cm. Twenty loomweights of Type Alb were intact and thus weighable; their weights range from 45.6 to 724.9 g (average 200 ± 218.3 g). Four of the loomweights are Type Ale (Fig. 21:14,17). Their heights are between 2.0 and 4.1 cm, their diameter ranges from 3.2 to 5.3 cm, and their weights vary from 22.8 to Photo 13. Area G, loomweights from L. 1110 (YS). 82.9 g (average 53 ± 22.2 g). Twenty-two loom- weights are Type Alq. Eighteen intact loomweights weigh 22.8-99.4 g, and seven loomweights weigh 366.4-805 g. The weight average of these groups found together in this locus is 210.8 ± 236.7 g (Graph 1). Graph 1. Weight range of intact loomweights from L. 1108. Area G, L. 1110 (Fig. 21:3,15,16; Photo 14). This locus consists of plaster from the floor of the 'House of the Bullae' (L. 967) and the earth fill beneath it, which was placed on a layer of crushed lime. The excavators attribute L. 1110 to Stratum 10C, parallel to L. 986 and L. 1108. Twenty-four unfired clay loomweights were found both in the plaster layer of the L. 967 floor (Photo 15) and in the earth fill underneath it (Photo 16). Several of the loom- weights bore traces of the floor plaster. One .loomweight is spherical (Ala): G 17546 (Fig. 21:3), 377.8 g. One loomweight is conical (Ale): G 15442, 48.8 g.

The five intact examples have a weight range of 56 to 107.5 g (average 70.1 ± 19.4 g). Nine of the loomweights are amorphic (Alo), making up 36% of the unfired clay loomweights found in this locus; they have a weight range of 53 to 115 g (average 84.2 ± 19.7). The weight range of all the intact loomweights from this locus is 44.8-115 g, apart from one loomweight weighing 377.8 g. The average weight is 77.1 ± 21.4 g, excluding the loomweight weighing 377.8 g (Graph 2). Graph 2. Weight range of intact loomweights from L. 1110. Weight The average weight of all the unfired clay loom- weights of the Iron Age II from the City of David is 160.7 ± 187.1 g (Graph 2). The standard deviation is higher than the average and shows a very high range for the weight, 22.8 to 805 g. The highest weight is in L. 456, 314.3 ± 153.8 g, but represents an average of only two loomweights. After this comes L. 1108, with an average of 201.8 ± 236.7 g. In the other loci (except for L. 792) the weight is around 100 g. The weight of the clay loomweights from the City of David is very low compared to other sites from the Iron Age in Israel (Table 3). However, the average weight for the Iron Age is higher than the average for the Persian period: 1 19.2 ± 91.4 g at H. Nimra and 36.2 ± 8.6 g at H. Rogem. Dating All of the unfired clay loomweights found in the City of David belong to the Iron Age II, dating from the 8th to the 6th centuries BCE (Strata 12-10). In the Land of Israel, loomweights first occur in the Middle Bronze Age II (Plan 2). Some of them were mentioned by Barber (1991: 300-301). They are known from Tell el-Ajjul (Petrie 1934: Pl. XLI), Bethel (Kelso 1963: 68-69, 84, 112, 118-19), Tell Beit Mirsim, Stratum D (Albright 1938: 54, 56), Beth She'an (A.

Nahal Te'enim (N. Scheftelo- witz, personal communication) and Tel Yoqne'am (A. Zarzecki-Peleg, personal communication). Their shape is oval, egg-shaped or conical with round base (Barber 1991: 300) and they are fired. In Anatolia, such loomweights belonging to the Early Bronze Age were found at Alaça Hüyük, Alishar, Aphrodisias, Mersin, Tarsus and Troy II. Their shape is similar to those from the Middle Bronze Age II in Israel. Barber (1991: 300-301) assumes that Anatolian families moved to Palestine in the Middle Bronze Age II and continued to use the warp-weighted loom. The warp-weighted loom was apparently invented in Europe or Anatolia in the Neolithic period (Barber 1991: 91-113). Only a few loomweights were discovered in the Late Bronze Age in Israel: at Tell Abu Hawam (Hamilton 1935: Pl. XXXI), Gezer (S. Gitin, personal communication), Hazor (D. Ben Ami, personal communication), Megiddo (Loud 1948: PL 169) and Tel Ta'anakh (Lapp 1969: 47). In the Iron Age I (Plan 2) loomweights are associated with pottery of Myc. 3Clb type at Philistine sites such as Ashdod (Dothan and Porath 1993: 64, 68, Figs. 24:3-5, 25:8, PL 39:4), Ashqelon (Lass 1994), Tel Miqne (Dothan and Gitin 1990: 31; Shamir 1991b) and Megiddo (Loud 1948: PL 170:26). The loomweights are unfired and of cylindrical shape with a narrower center, and are not perforated. They show strong connections with loomweights of the Mycenaean world (Lass 1994: 33) discovered at Mycenae and Tiryns (Schliemann 1886: 146), Kition (Karageorghis and Demas 1985: 113, 153, Pis. 201, 229), Pylos and Troy (Biegen 1958: 152, Fig. 256). At Tell Qasile in the Iron Age I they are perforated and doughnut-shaped or cylind- rical (Shamir 1994b) and display close connections with the Late Bronze Age tradition. Loomweights are very common in the Iron Age II in Israel and have been found at many sites (see below). No loomweights have been found in Syria before the Iron Age (Barber 1991: 300-302; Wakita et al. 1994: 29-30, Fig. 7) or in Egypt. Distribution in the Iron Age II The following is a list of sites in Israel where loomweights belonging to the Iron Age II have been found (Plan 2). Several sites were already mentioned by Sheffer (1981) and Browning (1988). The aim of the list is to examine to what extent is there a regional concentration of sites: such concentrations may point to major textile production centers.

The Beth She'an valley and central Jordan valley region: Tell el-Hammah, Vered Jericho (Shamir in press), Beth She'an, Tel Amai, Pella, Tell es-Sa'idiyeh, Tell Deir Alia. The Beth She'an region is known from various sources to have been a center for linen production during the time of the Mishnah and the Talmud, the 3rd and 4th centuries CE (Midrash Genesis Rabbah 20; Mishnah Kelim 9:42; Felix 1968: 284). Recent archaeological discoveries have yielded further evidence of linen production in the region. A spindle with linen threads still wrapped around it was found in the 10th century BCE stratum at Tell el-Hammah (Cahill et al. 1989: 36). Linen seeds were discovered at Tell Deir Alia (Vogelsang-Eastwood 1989: 58). 2. The Shephelah region: Gezer, Tel Batash, Tell Beit Mirsim, Beth Shemesh, Tell Judeideh, Tell el- Hesi, Lachish, Tel Miqne, Tel Maresha, Tell Zakariya, Tel Erani, Tell es-Safi. Wool was probably produced in the Shephelah region. Discussion Summaries of the possible use of the unfired clay balls are presented by Davidson and Thompson (1943: 65-75) and by Sheffer (1981). B. Mazar (1950-51: 197) views the function of the clay balls as 'clay heaters for keeping food warm.' Yeivin (1961: 93-94), in his discussion of the finds from Tel Erani, claims that they were used to preserve heat during the Sabbath. The excavations at Tel Ta'anakh (Lapp 1964: 26-28; 1967: 25) yielded 58 doughnut- shaped loomweights (Alb). They were found inside a krater in an Iron Age structure interpreted by the excavator as cultic. In Lapp's opinion, the clay balls served to absorb heat during the burning of sacrificial offerings. At En Gedi (Mazar 1966: 35, Pl. 22:5) loomweights with charred marks were found adjacent to an oven in Locus 70 of Stratum 5. The above constitute specific cases, which must be tested in order to determine whether these clay balls could indeed conduct heat sufficiently for use in cooking. B. Mazar (1964: 25) has suggested an additional use for clay balls found at Tel En Gev: as fish-net weights. However, these particular clay balls were unfired and thus could not have served this purpose. In those instances where similar objects were thought to be fish-net weights, such as at Khafaje in Mesopotamia (Frankfort 1932: 91-93), they were made of fired clay, were ring-shaped, and bore traces of the nets' strands. Recently, objections have been raised to the interpretation of 'clay balls' as loomweights. The main proponent of this opinion is Castro Curai (1985; 1986; 1988). She maintains that the occur- rence of these clay balls in storerooms rules out their use as loomweights, as it is unlikely that storerooms housed looms. However, ethnographic parallels indicate the existence of seasonal weaving. In Yugoslav village communities weaving is practiced during the winter and the loom is stored away when 142</page><page sequence="150">not in use (Eckhel 1988: 63). Ethnographic evidence suggests that warp-weighted looms were generally dismantled by their owners and stored away when not actually in use (Barber 1991: 101-102 after Hoffmann 1974: 31, etc.). Loomweights were discovered at Tel Beer Sheba in a structure of Stratum II dated to the Iron Age. This building served as a storehouse, at least during its final stage. Eleven loomweights were found in L. 222 and 40 in L. 282. Tel Beer Sheba also yielded loomweights found inside a krater, in L. 362 of the Hellenistic period (Sheffer 1981: PL 12:2). At Tel Ta'anakh as well, loomweights were found inside a krater dating from the Iron Age (Lapp 1964: 28, Fig. 13). Castro Curai (1985) and Gal (1989: 283) claim that the lack of grooves around the perforation, which would have been caused by the friction of the threads, proves that these objects were not used for weaving. However, there are several instances in which such signs of wear have been found; for example at Jericho in a Middle Bronze Age II level (Wheeler 1982: 623) and at Kadesh Barnea (Shamir 1995) and Vered Jericho from the Iron Age II (Shamir, in preparation). At Wusturg Dalem, an early medieval site in Germany, loomweights bear- ing such thread marks were found (Zimmermann 1982: 132). We maintain that such grooves do not always form. If the threads were firmly tied to the loom- weight preventing their movement, no such grooves would be created. In an experiment carried out by the author, woolen threads were tied to three clay loomweights in such a manner as to prevent thread movement. The loomweights were then moved, simulating the actual use of a loom. This was repeated constantly for several hours. The loom- weights were then examined under a magnifying glass, and no signs of friction were detected. Similar experiments were carried out by Schierer (1987: 65). We reconstructed a warp-weighted loom and used the clay loomweights from Tel Batash and Tel Miqne; no grooves were created. In Castro Cural's opinion (1986; 1988), the heterogeneity of shape, size and particularly weight of 'clay weights' prohibits their interpretation as loomweights. She claims that the heterogeneity of their weight would not permit the maintenance of equal thread tension. However, the position of the loomweight assem- blages when found provides evidence of their belonging to the same loom. Despite their common provenience, there were varying weights within the same assemblage. Other assemblages of loom- weights were found to vary in weight despite their belonging to the same loom, as evidenced by their position when found. At Tel Amai the weights ranged between 90 and 420 g (Gal 1988: 283). At Tell es-Sa'idiyeh (Pritchard 1985: 36-38), no data pertaining to weight were published; however, the published information on diameter and height allows us to infer that the weights varied here too. For additional examples of differing weights be- longing to the same loom, see Hoffmann 1974: 311- 12; Schierer 1987; Zimmermann 1982. Possibly, the number of threads tied through each loomweight (or tied to the loop) was not always the same and it was thus not necessary to make every loomweight identical in weight. More numerous warp threads could have been tied through a heavier loomweight, while a lighter one would bear fewer threads (Broudy 1979: 26; Hoffmann 1974: 314). Weight variation among loomweights from the same assemblage is a common phenomenon. At the City of David, in L. 1 108 of Stratum 10C the weight range is from 22.8 to 805 g. At Shiqmona, in Rooms PG-2 and PG-3 dated to the Persian period the loomweights vary from 30 to 380 g (Elgavish 1968: 33). At Tell Keisan, in L. 310 of Stratum 4B, dated to the end of the 7th century BCE, loomweights were found in two weight groups: three weighing 450 g each and 36 weighing 700 g apiece (Nodet 1980: 318-20). However, in the above-mentioned examples, none of the loomweights were found in a position that would conclusively prove their belong- ing to the same loom. This great variety of weights indicates one of the following possibilities: a) loomweights found in the same assemblage were used for weaving on different looms; or b) the loomweights belong to the same loom, but were not used at the same time. In weaving experiments with the warp-weighted loom we found that a difference of more than 200 g created a distortion in the textile. In Yugoslavia the loomweights were weighed before being hung on the loom (Hoffmann 1974: 42). Alternative explanations of this phenomenon have been offered. Nodet has suggested that the heavy loomweights were used in the center of the loom while two lighter ones were placed at the margins of the warp in order to pull groups of strings of different color, thickness and solidity. 143</page><page sequence="151">We carried out experiments with loomweights from various sites, with the following results. First, heavy weights ranging from 300 to 400 g were used. We found that when too many threads (more than ten) were tied to each loomweight the warp was uneven in tension; on the other hand, when one or two threads were tied they tended to break. A variation of about 200 g between the loomweights caused deformation of the cloth. Increasing the weight of the loomweight (up to a certain limit) resulted in stretching of the warp threads, enabling a larger number of weft threads to be packed in and resulting in a denser weave. Uneven spacing of the warp threads caused tightening in areas where the warp threads were more widely spaced. In a second experiment, loomweights from the Persian period which are no heavier than 30-50 g were used. First, seven warp threads were tied to each of twelve loomweights; the tension of the threads was inadequate for operation of the loom. Next, the number of threads was reduced to four to each loomweight, and the number of loomweights was increased to 22, with slightly heavier ones at each end to ensure straight selvedges. With this arrangement it was possible to weave, but the tension was still poor and resulted in a loose weave. The solution was to tie an even smaller number of warp threads (three or two) to each loomweight. One of the problems facing researchers is to reconstruct the amount of loomweights used simul- taneously on one loom. Davidson, in her report on the excavations at Corinth (Hellenistic period), claims that a loom 1.75 m wide had 60-70 loom- weights. This is the estimated width for making a peplos. She based this estimate on an attempt to reconstruct the scale of looms depicted on con- temporary painted vessels. This was then correlated with the quantities of loomweights found in various assemblages at Olynthos (Davidson 1952: 147). Nodet (1980: 318-21) based his reconstruction on the assemblages at Tell Keisan in Stratum 4b, dated to the 7th century BCE: 26 loomweights were found in L. 414 and 42 in L. 310. He concluded that the warp width ranged from two to three meters. However, if twelve threads were tied to each loomweight (Sheffer and Tidhar 1991), there would be a total of 312-504 warp threads on one loom. Calculating a density of five threads per centimeter (Sheffer 1981), a cloth width of 0.62-1.01 m could be obtained. Textiles from the Iron Age II, e.g. from Kuntillat Ajrud (Sheffer and Tidhar 1991) and Kadesh Barnea (Shamir 1995) display 10-20 threads in the warp. Elgavish (1968: 33) claims that the assemblages discovered at Shiqmona, in Rooms PG-2 and PG-3 of the Persian period, constitute a number of 30 loomweights per loom. The possibility that a small loomweight served to tighten each warp thread, as suggested by Nodet, seems unreasonable. Such an arrangement for a loom 2-3 m wide would require about 1000-1500 loomweights per loom, making the operation of the loom very cumbersome. The claim that each thread was tied to a loomweight is based on vessel paintings, such as the 5th-century BCE skyphos from Chiusi, showing such a configuration. In this case, Hoffmann's objection (1974: 306, Fig. 129) that loom drawings on vessels have been overused is valid: the artists were, at best, imprecise. The rows of loomweights found at certain sites, such as those mentioned above and by Barber (1991: 93-103), enable us to reconstruct the width of the loom, and hence the maximum width of the cloth that could be woven on it (Barber 1991: 103). The table presented by Barber (1991: 387-89), which gives the various widths of warp-weighted looms and the number of loomweights from those looms, demonstrates that there is no correlation between these two parameters. The distribution pattern of loomweights found at sites such as Tel Amai, Tell es-Sa'idiyeh and Tell Deir Alia undoubtedly points to their belonging to looms. At Tel Amai, two meter-long parallel rows of loomweights were found in situ (Levy and Edelstein 1972: 331-35, 342). A meter-long row of 62 loomweights was found in situ at Tell es- Sa'idiyeh, in House 6 of Stratum 5 (Pritchard 1985: 17-19, Fig. 3:2). Phase IX at Tell Deir Alia yielded three parallel rows of loomweights, dated to the 9th century BCE (Vogelsang-Eastwood 1989: 60). At Troy (Biegen et al. 1950: 350), a row of loomweights 1.1 m long was found in situ. At Gordion in Anatolia, 21 loomweights, some still bearing threads, were found lying in three rows (Brown 1980: 62, 86). Remains of wool fibers found at Ashqelon led Lass (1994: 33) to the assumption that the loom was 3 m wide. These data enable us to reconstruct the width of the cloth. Looms using loomweights have been successfully reconstructed by A. Sheffer (1980), by V. Idelin at the Kibbutz Revadim Museum following the discovery of loomweights at nearby Tel Miqne, and by O. Levy at En Yael (Photos 17-19). 144</page><page sequence="152">Photo 17. Reconstruction of warp-weighted loom, En Yael, Jerusalem (YR). Reconstructions were carried out by the author with the loomweights of Tel Dor at the 'Glass Factory' at Nahsholim, with the loomweights of Tel Batash (Keim and Mazar 1995: 163), and with the loom- weights of Masada (Shamir 1994b: 282). The finding of two loomweights resting in the mouths of storage jars at Tell el-Hammah, as well as the correlation between the size of the loomweights and the storage jar rim diameters at H. Rosh Zayit, led Gal (1989) to suggest that clay balls served as stoppers. However, Tell el-Hammah is an isolated case in which the loomweights were in secondary use. One of the loomweights was broken and only half of it was used as a stopper. Spindles (one with threads still wrapped around it), whorls and 161 loomweights found at Tell el-Hammah are evidence of extensive spinning and weaving activity at the site. Gal believes that the weight of these clay balls (420-650 g) is too high for use in weaving. However, weaving experiments with loomweights of this weight have proved that it is possible to weave even with loomweights of 800 g. In general the weight of loomweights diminishes from several hundred grams in the Iron Age to a weight of tens to two hundred grams in the Persian and Hellenistic periods, and consequently the comparison with Olynthos of the 5th century BCE is not relevant here. Gal does not relate to those sites in which these weights were found in rows. Moreover, the suggestion that they were used as stoppers does not explain why they do not occur in the Land of Israel before the Middle Bronze Age II or after the 1st century CE, and are entirely absent in Syria and Egypt.

Fired Loomweights: Types A2, A3 Forty-three fired loomweights were discovered at the City of David. Two states of firing can be differentiated: A2, poorly fired at low temperatures; and A3, well fired at high temperatures. A. Doughnut-shaped : Types A2b , A3b (Fig. 21:20- 21,24; PI. 12:6) Fourteen fired doughnut-shaped loomweights were found at the City of David in fills containing material no later than Stratum 7, the Hellenistic period. According to their typology and parallels from other sites, they belong to the Iron Age or Persian period. Those of the Persian period are very light and usually weigh less than 100 g. Ten of the loomweights are well fired (A3b). In two cases the firing is uneven (A2b): in both these loomweights, the color on one side is gray (7.5YR 5/0), while the other side of G 11319 is pink (5YR 7/4) and that of G 11388 is red (2.5YR 5/6). The maker's fingerprints are visible on loomweight El/10101 (A2b). All of the loomweights of this type at the City of David have a vertical cylindrical perforation made before firing. D2/20038 (A3b; Fig. 21:24) has two perforations stemming from the same opening. This may be understood to mean that one of the perforations was unsuitable and thus was canceled. It shows that importance was attached to the position of the perforation. The fired doughnut-shaped loomweights range in diameter from 5.8 to 10.6 cm. Their height is between 3.1 and 5.5 cm. The weights of the four intact examples range between 127.3 and 406.5 g and average 222.4 ± 108.7 g. Two examples vary in weight from the others of this type: Dl/883/1 (A3b) weighs 25.4 g and G 4326 (A2b) weighs 26.4 g. Some other examples were damaged and thus were not weighed, but from their dimensions appear to be similar in weight to the intact loomweights. These low weights are more suitable to whorls than to loomweights, and indeed several similar items have been termed whorls (Stern and Magen 1982: 194, Fig. 6:9-12). However, the off-center position of the perforation in these two examples shows that they could not have been whorls. Moreover, the size of the perforation is too small to have allowed a spindle to pass through. The two light loomweights (Dl/883/1 and G 4326/8) are rare in the Iron Age but typical of the Persian period; similar examples have been discovered at H. Nimra (Shamir 1992), H. Rogem, Nahal Haro'a and H. Masora in the Negev (Cohen 1986; Shamir, in preparation). B. Biconical: Types A2c, A3c (Fig. 21:19,22-23; PI. 11:6-7; PI. 12:5) Fourteen loomweights of this type were found. Their appearance is of two cones joined at their wide base; they are vertically perforated. They may be subdivided into A2c, fired at low temperatures, and A3c, well fired at high temperatures. All are relatively light, with a weight range of 18.8-68 g and an average weight of 35.3 ± 18 g. El/16802 (A3c) was found on a floor of Stratum 12, but because of its shape (see Fig. 21:22) there is considerable doubt about its function. El /16729 and El/16913 were found in L. 2092, a pit dated to the Persian period Stratum 9. The others were found 146</page><page sequence="154">in fills containing material dated no later than Stratum 9, apart from three from fills containing material dated no later than Stratum 7. According to their typology and parallels from other sites, they all, except for El/ 16802, belong to the Persian period. Light biconical (and sometimes doughnut- shaped) loomweights are typical of sites of the Persian period: H. Nimra (Shamir 1992), H. Rogem, Nahal Haro'a and H. Masora in the Negev (Cohen 1986; Shamir, in preparation), Shiqmona (Elgavish 1968), Tel Michal (Singer- Avitz 1989), Kh. Abu et-Twein (Mazar 1981: 23), Qadum (Stern and Magen 1982), Tel Tanim and Tel Maresha (Shamir, in preparation). C. Pyramidal : Types A2d, A3d, A5d (Fig. 21:26-30; PL 11:9-10,14,17; PL 12:3) Fifteen fired pyramidal loomweights, as well as one made of limestone (A5d; Fig. 21:26), were found at the City of David. Only one, El/3425 (A3d; Fig. 21:30; PL 11:9), was found in a secure context: L. 606. This locus is a floor belonging to Stratum 8, dated to the early Hellenistic period. Three spatulas were found in this locus (Ariel 1990: 134, BI 130- 132); it is suggested that these spatulas were used in the weaving process (Ariel 1990: 129-30). The remaining loomweights of this type come from fills containing material that is no later than Stratum 5, the 1st century CE. Twelve of the pyramidal loomweights are well fired (A3d), usually with well-levigated clay. In isolated instances, such as El/17351 (A2d; Fig. 21:27) and El/1643 (A2d), the clay is coarse and poorly fired. Most of the pyramidal loomweights are red. E 1/6 142 (A3d) is partly light reddish brown (5YR 6/4) and partly black (5Y 2.5/1), evidence of uneven firing conditions in the kiln. G 4323 (A3d; PL 11:14) bears the maker's fingerprints. Loom- weight D2/20910 (A5d) from L. 2745 is made of limestone. No special effort was made to ensure that the four sides of the pyramid were equal in size. The perforation is horizontal, located in the top third of the pyramid. The hole was made before firing and is not necessarily centered. Several perforation types were distinguished: 1. Single cone perforation, as in El/6159 (A3d); 2. Plain perforation, as in El/3425 (A3d; Fig. 21:30; PL 11:9); 3. Double cone perforation, as in D2/20083 (A3d); 4. Perforation drilled from one side, as in lime- stone loomweight D2/20910 (A5d; Fig. 21:26). Rutschman (1988) suggests that the holes were created by pushing a wooden stick, which later burnt away during firing, through the soft clay. On several loomweights from the City of David, e.g. D2/20083, G 4323 (PL 11:14), G 11545 (Fig. 21:29; PL 11:17), El/9391, G 2478 (all types A3d), clay residues were found around the outer perforation. This residue was caused when the stick entered the clay and was then pulled out, smearing the clay. The perforation diameter ranges from 0.3 to 0.8 cm and is thus too small to draw a group of warp threads through. Some kind of intermediary be- tween the warp threads and the loomweight would have been necessary, possibly in one of the two following manners: 1. A ring connecting the warp threads and the loomweight. A similar type of connection is depicted on a painted lekythos exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (Hoffmann 1974: 307). A pyramidal loomweight of uncertain origin (perhaps from Italy) in the British Museum has an elliptical bronze ring attached to it (Davidson and Thompson 1943: 68, Fig. 30). A similar type of attachment could be achieved by use of a loop made from organic material. At Masada, thanks to the dry climate, some of the loops made of linen, goat hair or date-palm fibers were preserved around the loomweights (Shamir 1994a). 2. A wooden or metal rod drawn through the perforation, with the string tied around it (McLau- chlin 1981; Davidson 1952: 147). At Nemea in the Peloponnese, conical loomweights were found in which such wooden rods were preserved, some up to 4 cm long (McLauchlin 1981: 74). These were found in a 2nd century BCE to 3rd century CE context. Depictions "of similar rods appear on stamp impressions stamped onto four loomweights from Corinth, dating from the 4th to the beginning of the 3rd century BCE (Davidson 1952: Figs. 25:1145; 27:1153,1164-65). Similar stamps were found on two loomweights from the Pnyx in Athens (David- son and Thompson 1943: Fig. 39:139). Metal rods were discovered inside the perforation of a loom- weight from Myrna (Davidson 1952: 148, n. 4). Pyramidal loomweights E 1/6 159, E 1/6 142, G 2478, El/3896 (PL 11:10), all Type A3d, and perhaps D2/20083 (A3d) and E2/1643 (A2d), have a partial perforation on one side. Similar holes were found on loomweights from the Pnyx, both 147</page><page sequence="155">pyramidal and cylindrical (Davidson and Thomp- son 1943: 72). Davidson views the function of these perforations as aiding the firing process by prevent- ing cracking. This opinion is shared by D. Castel and O. Mazar, ceramicists consulted by the author. Such a block of clay would crack during firing if no holes were made in it. An additional explanation (Davidson and Thompson 1943: 72) is that these holes were used by the ceramicist when placing the loomweights on the firing board in the kiln. The weights of the pyramidal loomweights from the City of David range from 35.9 to 144 g. One of the finds from the City of David, identified as a weight by Eran (this volume, Chapter V, W 161), is similar in shape to the fired pyramidal loomweights. The base of this object is incised. In our opinion as well this is not a loomweight, as its weight is only 3.65 g, too low to allow it to give any tension to a group of warp threads. Pyramidal loomweights, mostly fired, have been found as early as the 3rd millennium BCE in Early Bronze Age levels (Strata 1-7) at Troy (Biegen et al. 1950: 104, 338, 344, Figs. 221, 369; Biegen 1953: 232, 272, 315, Fig. 305; Biegen 1958: 57, 67, 199, Figs. 221, 256). Numerous pyramidal loomweights were found in Strata 2A-3C at Enkomi, dated to 1425- 1100/1075 BCE (Dikaios 1971: 445-74, Pis. 127:19, 134:35,37-38, 154:9, 155:2,46). This type of loom- weight apparently does not occur in Greece before the 7th century BCE (Davidson and Thompson 1943: 73). Pyramidal loomweights are pictured in vessel paintings showing the warp-weighted loom, an example of which is a lekythos exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, dated to the 6th century BCE. A similar depiction is found on a 5th- century BCE skyphos discovered at Chiusi (Hoff- mann 1974: 306-307). In Israel they appear in the Persian period (5th-4th centuries BCE) only at H. Nimra (Shamir 1992). The use of pyramidal loomweights was common throughout the Hellenistic and Early Roman periods (Reisner 1924: 343). Davidson (1952: 147) mentions numerous sites where such loomweights belonging to these periods were found: in Asia Minor at Ephesus, Pergamon and Tarsus; and in Greece at Dodona, Olympia, Delphi, Corinth, the Argive Heroeum, Aegina, Athens (Pnyx), Olynthos, Myrna, Lindos, Elatea. Israel has also yielded many pyramidal loom- weights from the Hellenistic and Early Roman periods, such as Tel Anafa, Phase 1 (Herbert 1979: 67-80, Fig. 17), Ashdod, Stratum 3a (Dothan and Freedman 1967: Fig. 17), Tel Maresha (Shamir, in preparation), Masada (Shamir 1994a), Mazor (Sha- mir, in preparation), Tel Michal (Singer-Avitz 1989: 359, Fig. 31.7:22), Samaria (Reisner 1924: 343), Shiqmona, Stratum H, Room HD (Elgavish 1974: 35-36, PL xxv:255), Yodfat (M. Aviam, personal communication); and, in Transjordan, Pella (McNi- coll 1982: 75, PL 156). The use of warp-weighted looms ceased almost entirely at the end of the 1st century CE, when the horizontal loom became common; the latter did not require loomweights. This phenomenon is known from both literary sources and archaeological evidence (Broudy 1979: 27; Davidson 1952: 147; Shamir 1991c). The pyramidal loomweights from the City of David date from no later than Stratum 5 and thus serve to verify the accepted dating. The warp-weighted loom had several disadvan- tages which led to its eventual disuse. The weaver had to weave while standing or walking back and forth (Crowfoot 1937: 47). Moreover, the weft threads had to be beaten upwards, against the force of gravity. These two factors greatly complicated the task of the weaver. In Iceland and Scandinavian countries, however, the use of the warp-weighted loom continued with some changes into the present century (Hoffmann 1974). 3. Tablets with Two Holes: Types A3g, A5f (Fig. 22:1-3; PL 11:13) Four elliptical limestone tablets (A5f) and one rectangular fired clay tablet (A3g) were found at the City of David. Two of these tablets are from the Iron Age: D2/20366 (A5f; Fig. 22:3) from L. 2337, Stratum Ì2; and E3/15952 (A3g; Fig. 22:1) from L. 1930A, Stratum 10. El/17108 (A5f) is from L. 2092, a pit dated to the Persian period, Stratum 9. Tablet E3/7471 (PL 11:13) was made out of a broken piece of a chalk vessel of the 'measuring cup' type in secondary use (Cahill 1992: 210). Vessels of this type were in common use during the 1st century CE up to the destruction in 70 CE. Tablets E3/7471 (PL 11:13) and G 4585 (Fig. 22:2) have holes drilled from the interior of the original vessel. This can be inferred from the fact that the perforations are wider on the inner side and are conical. El /17 108 (A5f) has cylindrical perfora- tions. E3/15952 (A3g; Fig. 22:1) is made of fired 148</page><page sequence="156">clay; the perforations were made before firing and are cylindrical. This type was used in 'tablet weaving,' in which narrow strips of cloth, such as belts or narrow ribbons meant to adorn clothing, are woven (Schierer 1987: 77). In this method, the greater the number of holes in a tablet, the more intricate the design which can be created. The more numerous are the tablets used to weave one strip of cloth, the wider will be the strip. Weaving experiments were carried out: the end result of weaving with tablets having two perforations was a woven strip of the plain weave technique. Despite the success of this experiment, we could also accept the proposal that these slabs were used as 'bull roarers' (Van Beek 1989). B. WHORLS Whorls are used as weights for spinning. They are hung on the spindle and weigh it down (Yisraeli 1968), thus allowing the spindle to turn and to twist the fibers together. Seventy-eight whorls were found at the City of David, a small percentage of which are doubtfully identified as whorls, as noted below. These whorls are made of fired clay, basalt, limestone and chalk. One whorl, E3/7672 (Fig. 22:16; PL 12:4), is a fossilized sea urchin with a hole drilled through it. Several interrelated factors are crucial for creat- ing the necessary momentum, the 'speed and force of spinning' (Smith and Hirth 1988): 1. The raw material from which the whorl is made. The spinning process requires the whorl to be shaken. This action is especially intense in the suspended spindle method, where spinning is carried out while walking. The whorl must be made of a durable enough material to withstand this. Thus, unfired clay and other such materials would be unsuitable for this purpose. 2. The size of the whorl. Too large a whorl would complicate the spinning. 3. The weight of the whorl. Whorls made of light material, such as wood, are used to spin wool (short fibers), while heavier whorls, such as stone, are used for linen (long fibers) (Forbes 1956: 152; Ryder 1983: 747; Baginski and Shamir 1995: 31). Ryder maintains that a heavy whorl produces a tight spin, which is suitable for the warp. 4. The location of the perforation. A hole located in the center of the whorl provides the best momentum and equal distribution of the object's mass around the hole (Nodet 1980: 316; Smith and Hirth 1988). Factors 1-3 are dependent on the type of fibers used for spinning (wool, linen or other material), the tightness of spinning and the thickness of the thread to be spun (thicker threads, as well as two or more threads to be spun together, require a heavier whorl). At Megiddo (Guy 1938: 170, Fig. 175:6, PL 84:1), two hemispherical whorls joined at the base on a spindle were found. The use of two such whorls provides a weight which enables the spinning of two or more threads into one. 1. Fired Clay (Ceramic) Biconical Whorls: Types B2c, B3c (Fig. 21:18) Two biconical whorls were found at the City of David. They may be subdivided into B2c, fired at low temperatures, and B3c, well fired at high temperatures. Whorl El/10004 (B2c; Fig. 21:18) was found in L. 1391, defined as a Stratum 12(?) floor; it weighs 17.3 g. Whorl G 17552 (B3c) comes from L. 1115, a living surface of Stratum 12B; it weighs 15.3 g. The perforation is cylindrical and was made before firing. Such a perforation shape is ideally suited for placing the whorl on the spindle (Nodet 1980: 316). Attempts to spin were carried out by the author, using the suspended spindle method in which the whorl is placed at the bottom of the spindle. The material employed was sheep wool. This experiment showed that the objects from the City of David could be used as whorls. 2. Fired Clay (Ceramic) Disc Whorls: Type B3h (Fig. 22:4-10; PL 11:8,11) Twenty-one fired clay (ceramic) disc whorls were found at the City of David. Six of them were found on floors dating to the Iron Age, Strata 14-10. One such whorl, E3/19204/2 (Fig. 22:8), comes from L. 2441, a floor dated to the Early Bronze Age, Stratum 20. The thirteen remaining whorls were discovered in fills of various periods, none of which contained material later than Stratum 7. Similar whorls are found in the Land of Israel from the Neolithic period (Perrot 1966: Fig. 6:17; Wheeler 1982: 626, Fig. 255). However, the main 149</page><page sequence="157">distribution of these whorls is in the Iron Age (Yisraeli 1968: 1000-1001). This type of whorl is extremely common throughout the world. For example, such whorls dating from 1025 BCE to 700 CE were found in Mexico (Smith and Hirth 1988: 353-54). The shape of these whorls (B3h) is a result of reworking pottery sherds to a rough circle. The rounded shape was obtained by sanding down the edges. A hole was then drilled through the center. Most of the sherds in secondary use as whorls are body sherds and thus the original vessel is uni- dentifiable. An exception is whorl E3/ 19204/2 (Fig. 22:8), which was made out of a red-slipped and burnished Early Bronze Age platter. In most instances, the hole was drilled from both sides of the sherd, evidenced by its being narrower in the center than at the openings (Fig. 22:4-9; PI. 11:8). This is termed a 'chamfered' or 'double cone' perforation. Whorls El/16677 (Fig. 22:10; PI. 11:11), E3/13107 and El/10605/1 have a perforation which is drilled from one side and thus cylindrical. Although, as previously noted, a cylindrical hole is optimal for spinning, only a minority of the Type B3h whorls have such a perforation. Whorl El/9815 has a residue of clay around both openings of its perforation, showing that the hole was made before firing. In only three cases, El/16677 (Fig. 22:10; PI. 11:11), Dl/12725 and El/10605/1, was the perfora- tion centered. The size and weight range of Type B3h is quite large. The height ranges from 0.7 to 1.6 cm, the diameter is between 2.3 and 7.3 cm, while the weight varies from 4 to 88 g. Attempts to spin with these objects employing the suspended spindle method showed that they may certainly be used as whorls. 3. Decorated Limestone Whorls: Types B4k, B41, B4m, B4n (Fig. 22:16,19-21; PI. 12:4) Four limestone whorls were found at the City of David. Only one, G 4890 (B41; Fig. 22:19), is from a clear context, L. 792 in the 'House of AhieP, dated to Stratum 10C-B. Whorl E3/7672 (B4k; Fig. 22:16; PI. 12:4) is made of a piece of fossilized sea urchin with a hole drilled through it; the natural lines of the fossil are visible on the whorl's surface. Whorl G 4890 (B41; Fig. 22:19) is conical and decorated on its base with 16 dotted concentric circles. Whorl G 4546 (B4m; Fig. 22:20) is cylindrical and decorated on its side with an incised strip bearing a double zigzag. Whorl D2/ 20067 (B4n; Fig. 22:21) has a natural shape and is decorated with incised lines around the hole and around the base, with three zigzags incised between them. The perforation of these whorls was drilled from one side and is cylindrical. E3/7672 (B4k; Fig. 22:16; PI. 12:4), made of the fossilized sea urchin, weighs 7.6 g. The rest of the stone whorls were fragmentary, and thus their weight could not be determined. 4. Basalt Whorls: Types B6k, B61, B6n (Fig. 22:11- 15; PI. 12:1-2,7) Eight basalt whorls were found at the City of David, seven of them in fills containing material no later than Stratum 6, dated to 70 CE. Whorl E3/19283 (B6n) was found in L. 2438 of Stratum 21-20, dated to the Early Bronze Age. Six of these whorls are hemispherical or dome- shaped (B6k; Fig. 22:12-15; PI. 12:2,7). Of these, only two are decorated: G 4389 (Fig. 22:13) with an incised band near the base and G/4387 with two incised lines near the base. Whorl Al/108/1 (B61; Fig. 22:11; PI. 12:1) is conical and is decorated with an incised line near the base and an incised concentric circle around the perforation. Whorl E3/19283 is ring-shaped (B6n) and is undecorated. The perforation of these whorls is drilled from one side and is cylindrical. The weight of the six intact basalt whorls from the City of David ranges from 5.2 to 18 g. Ring-shaped basalt whorls are common in the Early Bronze Age in Israel and have been found at Affula (Sukenik 1948: Pl. XIII:14-16), Ai (Callaway 1980: Fig. 84, Pis. 94:11,15,16; 140:19), Arad (Amiran 1978: PI. 67), Azor (Shamir, in prepara- tion), Beth She'an (Fitzgerald 1935: PI. VI:23,25), En Shadud (Braun 1985: 98), H. Iiiin Tahtit (Braun 1994: Ch. 12:3), Jericho (Wheeler 1982: 626-27), Lachish (Tufnell 1953: 71), Megiddo (Loud 1948: PI. 171:1,2,4,7,8; Guy 1938: PI. 76:5,6), Me'ona (E. Braun, personal communication), Palmahim Quar- ry (Braun 1994: Ch. 12:3), Qiryat Ata (Shamir, in preparation), Yarmouth (de Miroschedji 1988: Fig. 16:9, PI. 49:7) and Yiftah'el (Braun 1994: Ch. 12:3). At Tell Abu al-Kharaz in Jordan, a ring whorl of the Early Bronze Age I was found with part of a wooden spindle (Fischer 1993: PL 13). In the Early Bronze Age a preference for stone whorls (basalt 150</page><page sequence="158">and limestoné) is evident, but fired clay disc-shaped whorls also continued in use (Wheeler 1982: 627). 5. Chalk Whorls: Types B5h, B5m, B5p (Fig. 22:18,23-27; PL 11:12) Twenty-nine chalk whorls were found at the City of David. Twenty-six of them came from fills and dumps containing material no later than Stratum 5, the 1st century CE. Whorl El/ 16848 (B5h) was found in L. 2089, defined as an earth layer. Whorl El/21635 (B5h) comes from L. 2161, defined as a gravel layer. Both are dated to Stratum 18 of the Middle Bronze Age. E2/7305/2 was found in L. 1431. This whorl was made from the base of a chalk vessel of the 'measuring cup' type in secondary use (Cahill 1992: 210). The original vessel may be dated to the 1st century CE, with a terminus ante quem of 70 CE. Most of the chalk whorls are discoid (B5h), apart from two, E3/7467 (Fig. 22:23; PL 11:12) and E2/ 1573/2 (Fig. 22:25), whose shape is roughly circular (B5p). One of the chalk whorls, El/4055 (Fig. 22:27), is cylindrical (B5m). In sixteen of the chalk whorls, the hole was drilled from both sides, as it is narrower in the center ('chambered' perforation). Thirteen of the chalk whorls have a cylindrical perforation drilled from one side (Fig. 22:26-27). Twenty-three intact chalk whorls were weighed. Their weight ranges from 6.5 to 70.1 g, apart from three chalk whorls with exceptionally high weights: Dl/6976 (B5h) weighing 97.6 g; El/10089 (B5h) weighing 171 g; and E2/7305/2 (B5h) weighing 195.5 g. Though it is generally assumed that a whorl weighing 195.5 g is too heavy to be used, the author attempted to spin with it and was successful in doing so. It may be concluded that these extremely heavy whorls were used to spin the warp threads, as a heavy whorl causes tight spinning suitable for the warp (Ryder 1983: 747). In the Nahal Mishmar cave, similar objects dated to the Chalcolithic period were found. They have parallels at other sites from this period, such as Jericho, Teleilat Ghassul and the Chalcolithic sites of the Beer Sheba region (Bar-Adon 1971). Bar- Adon maintains (1971: 183) that these were used as loomweights, claiming this as evidence for the use of a weighted loom as early as the Chalcolithic period. However, it should be noted that the remains of a loom discovered in the Nahal Mishmar cave are of the horizontal loom type; whorls were not used on such a loom. It is the author's opinion that Bar- Adon' s interpretation is incorrect, and the chalk weights found in the Nahal Mishmar cave are spinning whorls of Type B5h. Fired clay whorls (Type B3h) were found at Nahal Mishmar as well; this may indicate that threads of different types were spun, which is borne out by the remains of both linen and wool cloths found in the cave. This type appears to be typical of the Hellenistic period, and also occurs at Tel Maresha (Shamir, in preparation). 6. Chalk Discs with an Unfinished Perforation: Type B5i (Fig. 22:22; PL 11:15) At the City of David, four discs of Type B5i were found. They are similar in shape to Type B5h, but in this case the hole is unfinished. The beginning of the perforation can be seen from both sides of the disc. Nodet (1980: 20) claims that these discs served as pivots for the drill boring a hole in a sherd or stone. The drill's head would be lodged in the 'conical cavity' hollowed out in the disc, and this would provide the necessary vertical pressure for drilling the hole. When such a pivot eventually became pierced through due to use, it might have then been used as a whorl. CONCLUSIONS The different types of loomweights throughout the periods at the City of David accord with the typology of loomweights at other sites in Israel. The dominant type of loomweight in the Iron Age II is doughnut-shaped with a weight of hundreds of grams; in the Persian period the dominant type is biconical with a low weight (less than 100 g); in the Hellenistic period the dominant type is pyramidal with a weight of around 100-200 g. Among the whorls, Type B3h (flat ceramic whorls) are found in all the strata, but are concentrated mainly in the Iron Age strata, 14-10. Type B5h (chalk whorls) come mainly from Strata 7-5 of the Hellenistic period. A total of 186 loomweights and 73 whorls was found in the City of David (Table 4). This amount is low, considering the extent of the excavated Iron Age strata in the City of David: only 142 loom- weights attributed to the Iron Age were found.

This supports the opinion of Browning (1988) that two major centers of textile production were active. Very few loomweights were discovered in loci defined as floors in the City of David: 1-6 loom- weights per floor. Very few loomweights were found in Areas E and E3; 17 loomweights were found in Area D, all from Stratum 12. The remaining loomweights (102), with one exception, stem from Area G, Stratum 10, despite the fact that a larger area of Stratum 12 was excavated. The low number of loomweights compared to other sites also persists in the Persian and Hellenistic-Roman periods in the City of David. The whorls found in the City of David are relatively few in number as well: a total of 73 whorls of varying types from different strata. The majority of whorls were found in fills and thus it is difficult to form definite conclusions about the nature of this find. The limited number of whorls and loomweights 152</page><page sequence="160">found in the City of David provides evidence for domestic weaving activity rather than industrial production. The residents perhaps bought their textiles from the Shephelah region and Beth She'an Valley. It is probable that the textiles produced at the City of David were of wool, and not linen, which was manufactured in the Beth She'an Valley. A large quantity of sheep bones was found in the City of David (Horwitz, this volume, Chapter XI). The limited weaving and spinning activity in the City of David thus probably utilized wool.

In a society whose economy and social organization relied heavily on individual agricultural production, this class of finds, its intra- and intersite spatial distribution and its diachronic changes are probably most informative about daily subsistence and the organization of the means of production. However, domestic stone tools are rarely discussed in 'biblical' site reports. A few categories of stone vessels, namely certain types of stone bowls, are sometimes included in the reports because of their similarity to pottery types, and are analyzed by the same criteria. However, grinding and pounding vessels are rarely reported. In some instances comments are made in passing, or illustrations are presented with cursory remarks, if any (Albright 1932: PL 44; 1943: 84; Ben-Tor 1987: 236-43, Fig. 58; Franken and Steiner 1990: Figs. 2- 23:5, 2-24:1, 2-29:11, 2-35:3-4; Lapp 1978: 110, PL 24; Lamon and Shipton 1939: Pis. 106, 112; Yadin 1958: Pis. LIX, LXIL5-8, LXXXVII:22-23,25, CXLII:23-26; 1960: Pis. LXXVII, CIV, CV:19-20, CVII:22, CXXVI:26, CXLIX:1-12; Yadin and Geva 1986: Figs. 38-39, Photos 45, 48; to name but a few). The reasons for this omission are not easy to understand. Its origins should perhaps be sought in the early days of archaeological research in the country, when stratigraphie and chronological aspects, partly based on typological classifications * Submitted October 1990. of pottery, were of primary significance. It would seem that most researchers did not find domestic stone tools to be of interest from those two points of view. Indeed, in most cases there is no hint of recognition of such items as possessing any archae- ological meaning. However, the focus of research has gradually been shifting from the purely archaeological to somewhat more anthropologically-oriented realms. Excavations no longer concentrate solely on monu- mental architecture and massive fortifications, but also on the sometimes meager remains of the daily life of the population in the sites under study. Another welcome trend, albeit slower to appear, is the shift to explanatory rather than descriptive research. Within this broadened research scope, all implements should be considered and studied. It was for this reason that it was decided to devote specific attention to the domestic stone implements originating from the City of David excavations. Although it became clear from an early stage that sample limitations restricted the full treatment of all the basic research questions (see below), it was considered worthwhile to present the results of the analysis and the problems involved in dealing with this class of finds. In conclusion several research possibilities will be outlined. RESEARCH OBJECTIVES The current research was designed to clarify issues connected with the domestic groundstone industry at the City of David along three distinct lines: descriptive, methodological and interpretative. Since this class of finds has not been dealt with in the past by detailed typological or stratigraphie 171</page><page sequence="179">analyses, it was felt that a necessary step in the present study was the clarification of any temporal patterns that could be detected within the ground- stone class of artifacts. The City of David excava- tions seemed to provide an appropriate case study for a diachronic analysis, taking into consideration the long time span represented by the various stratigraphie units in the excavated areas (Chalco- lithic to Islamic periods; Shiloh 1984). In order to define the temporal characteristics of the assemblage, three analyses were deemed neces- sary: A. Typological changes of grinding/pounding vessels with time. B. The relative frequencies of typological classes within any period. C. The metrical characteristics of specific types in specific periods. Only after dealing with the chronological aspects could further subjects be raised: D. Patterns of exploitation of raw materials and the various techniques used for producing grinding/ pounding stone tools. E. Examination of the uses of various types and/ or raw materials, which might have been diverse in both intraperiod and interperiod comparisons. F. Patterns of intrasite spatial distribution of typological classes. These analyses could have a bearing on techno- logical processes of the production of the stones, labor and trade organization (e.g., whether the stones were manufactured privately or by specia- lized artisans, whether they were distributed from a production center by means of a market economy, etc.) and subsistence patterns, namely, which materials were processed. METHODOLOGY Groundstone artifacts are defined here, following Clark (1988: 83), as 'all the artifacts produced by the . . . process of pecking, grinding, abrading and polishing.' At least one group of such artifacts (flint hammerstones) is described elsewhere (Rosen, this volume, Chapter VI) and will not be discussed here in detail. As is the common practice in biblical archaeology excavations, the basic analytical unit used in this study is the basket. The artifacts were recorded by an attribute analysis, in which every specimen was identified by its basket number and then examined and described from several aspects (the raw data are presented in Appendix A): A. Provenience (record of stratum and locus within the excavation). Spatial relations were defined by both the designation of the area from which the object originated and the locus and context description (e.g., fill, floor, foundation, robbers' trench, etc.). B. Raw material. Eight attribute states were used to describe this variable: 1) limestone; 2) basalt; 3) sandstone; 4) flint; 5) vesicular basalt; 6) chalk; 7) phosphorite; 8) other (various indeterminate mate- rials). Identification of raw material was carried out by the naked eye. In some instances, however, more detailed tests or pétrographie analyses were used to identify the raw material (see Appendix B). C. Length, width and thickness. These metrical attributes were measured in mm at their maximum and at 90° to one another. The dimensions of broken items were measured when possible, but were not used for specific statistical analyses. D. Depth. This was measured only in hollow vessels (such as bowls, basins, mortars, etc.). The measurement was taken in mm, perpendicular to an imaginary horizontal line connecting the two sides of the rim of the vessel. E. Diameter. This was also taken only in hollow vessels, measured in mm at the opening of the vessel. In the present sample it was also the maximum distance between the walls of the vessel. F. Weight. This is given in grams. Values are correct within an instrument error of ± 5 g; however, several smaller objects were re-weighed on a more sensitive scale. G. Morphology. This attribute describes the shape of an artifact as seen in plan view. Nine attribute states were used: 1) round; 2) elliptical; 3) square; 4) rectangular; 5) amorphic; 6) oval; 7) broken (when broken beyond recognition); 8) indeterminate; 9) cylindrical. Elliptical shape is conceived here as elongated, as opposed to the more rounded oval shape. H. Shape of section (Fig. 23). This describes the transversal cross-section. The attribute states are: 1) round; 2) lens-like; 3) concave-convex; 4) plano- convex; 5) rectangular; 6) trapezoidal; 7) convex- convex; 8) square; 9) triangular; 10) U-shaped; 11) hat-like; 12) amorphic; 13) indeterminate (when broken beyond recognition). Longitudinal section shape was noted in passing and usually conforms with the transverse pattern. 172</page><page sequence="180">Fig. 23. Shapes of transversal cross-sections. I. Typology. The typological characteristics of grinding/pounding stones are less definite than those of pottery vessels, since the number of distinctive elements (e.g., rims, bases, decorations) is low. The classification is therefore a flexible, intuitive procedure. Following Kraybill (1977: Tab. 1), the basic typological division is between pounding as op- posed to grinding instruments. Each group consists of lower and upper stones. Kraybill grouped them in pairs, correlating types of lower stones with specific upper stones. However, her scheme is based on ethnographic material from hunter-gatherer societies and cannot be employed here uncritically. The typological list includes 17 types: 1) mortar; 2) pestle; 3) lower grinding stone; 4) grinding slab; 5) bowl; 6) footed bowl; 7) bowlet; 8) cup mark; 9) basin; 10) upper grinding stone; 11) mano; 12) muller; 13) rounded hammerstone (without any scars, but with pitting all over the surface); 14) elongated hammerstone; 15) varia; 16) indetermi- nate; 17) broken. Of these, Nos. 1, 2, 8, 13 and 14 are considered pounding instruments; in this category only the pestle is an upper stone. The distinction between a mortar and a deep bowl is a difficult one, and in some cases the two terms may be interchangeable. Differentiation between a small bowlet and a cup mark is easier, since the diameter of the hole of a cup mark is small in relation to the area of the stone surface, while in a bowlet this diameter takes up almost the whole surface. The other types consist of grinding utensils (except for No. 15; see below), of which Nos. 10- 12 are upper stones. The lower grinding stone is also known in the literature as a 'metate' (Carter 1977; see Clark 1988; Flannery 1986: 147-56), a name derived from South and Central America. The difference between a grinding stone and a grinding slab is primarily one of size (slabs have larger working surface) and of shape (slabs are less regular and do not show the typical elliptical or oval morphology of a 'lower grinding stone'). The term 'mano' (attribute state No. 5) is also a South American one (Clark 1988; Flannery 1986), describ- ing a specific type of upper grinding stone (see below). 'Muller' (attribute state No. 6) is also a particular type of 'upper grinding stone' (see Belfer- Cohen 1988: 191-92). In the current analysis the distinction of upper grinding stone as opposed to 'mano' or 'muller' is based on their sizes and shapes: while the former are larger and were probably employed with both hands, the latter two categories are much smaller and fall within the group of the 'one-hand mano' (Clark 1988: Fig. 40). A serious problem may arise when attempting to differentiate between lower grinding stones of the classical shape and upper stones belonging to the typical bun-shaped variety. In some cases, size serves as a criterion for distinction, since the lower stones are larger. However, when intermediate sizes were encountered, the definition rested on several other criteria: when the face opposite the working surface was not modified in any way and remained coarse, this was taken as an indication of a lower stone in which the coarse face was placed on the ground or stuck into it, or inserted in a clay emplacement, during work. On the other hand, if the face opposite the working surface was smoothed or modified, and if the size and curve of the opposite face fitted into the palm of the hand, the items were considered to be upper grinding stones, held in the palm during work. Another criterion for distinction may be found in the degree and shape of curve of the working surface. While in lower stones that surface tends to become concave with pro- longed usage, the working platform of the upper stone is either flat or slightly convex. The term 'varia' was used to describe items that were only loosely connected with either pounding or grinding utensils, but which on the other hand could not be included within any of the formal type classes used in the various analyses of finds from the 173 1 w 2 &lt;Z522&gt; /fa. 9 &amp;22Z&amp; 3 10^^ „V 5 ^ 6 7 ÏZZZZâ 13</page><page sequence="181">excavations. These items will be described in greater detail. J. Preservation. Attribute states here include: 1) complete; 2) broken longitudinally; 3) broken transversally; 4) broken into fragments. K. Length of leg. In footed bowls the length of the leg was measured from the rim of the bowl to the basis of the leg. This measurement was not taken if the leg was broken. RESULTS A. Sample Size and Preservation Table 1 presents the absolute frequencies of stone tools in the various strata and areas of excavation. In order to achieve a better resolution, several strata are collapsed together. Thus, all sub-divisions of Strata 3, 10 and 18 are disregarded, while Strata 7 and 8 (both Hellenistic) and 17 and 18 (both MB IIA-B) are combined. As can clearly be seen from Table 1, sample size is extremely small. The highest number of artifacts was found in Stratum 12, dated to the 8th century BCE (N = 52), while the richest area is El (N = 76). Some of the stratigraphie designations are extremely broad (e.g., Strata 17-20 cover some 1200 years), while several artifacts originated from chronologi- cally questionable contexts within their assigned stratum. When broken down by typological classes, the sample is actually useless in terms of defining any temporal patterns and diachronic changes. The poor sample is partly due to the fact that not all the items of possible interest for the current analysis were available for study. This was partially a result of the fact that some items were not saved during the excavation. Others were too large to be removed and could not be found during later visits to the site (although several were recorded by photographs). Still others could not be located in the laboratory, although they were appropriately recorded and registered. Hence, the present sample of 190 items is by no means a complete one. Area G alone yielded at least 15 additional groundstone items, two of which were saddle querns left at the site. However, as far as I could establish, the numbers of missing items are not large enough to affect the results. Out of the 190 objects recorded, there were only 40 complete ones on which all the relevant Table 1. Distribution of stone tools by stratum and area.

Table 2 presents the typological breakdown of these complete items. No significant statistics regarding metrical data could be extracted from such data, especially since 1 5 out of the 40 undamaged specimens are classified as 'varia.' Consequently, any attempt to relate metrical data to temporal patterns is rendered impossible. B. Typology Typological aspects seemed in many cases to be inseparable from those of raw material and from the techniques of execution of the objects. Hence, the following typological discussion touches upon all three issues. Table 3 presents the typological breakdown by stratum across all areas of excava- tion. 1. Mortars (N = 3; Fig. 24:1; cf. Lee 1973: Fig. LBl:a-b; Samuel 1989: Figs. 12.2-12.3; Lamon and Shipton 1939: PL 112:8). The only item from a secure stratigraphie context comes from a floor in Stratum 12, but its position in the floor, i.e., whether it was inserted in the ground, in a pit, on a platform, etc., is not clear. It is made of limestone by careful Table 2. Typological breakdown of complete items (all strata).

The criteria for distin- guishing the two types should be metrical ones, and I suggest that they be based on the ratio between the depth of the hollow part to the diameter of the opening: i.e., the higher the ratio, the more 'mortar- like' is the object. This suggestion is based on the fact that a steeper angle of curvature reduces the risk of the contents flying out during pounding (see also Samuel 1989: 259). However, given the extremely small sample size here it is difficult to set a threshold value for this ratio. 2. Pestles (N=10; Fig. 24:2-5). Six of these are made of basalt, three of limestone and one of vesicular basalt. One item is a surface find. Several forms of pestles are grouped in the class. One item is a fragment. Three others (dated to Middle Bronze and Iron Age strata) are 'classical' pestles, i.e., elongated and cylindrical in form (Davis 1982: Fig. 3.3:4-8; Franken and Steiner 1990: Figs. 2-23:5, 2-29:11, 2-35:3-4; Kirkbride 1966: Fig. 7:4,6; Lamon and Shipton 1939: PI. 106:7-9), of which the complete one measures 127 x 58 x 52 mm (Fig. 24:2). Of these, one is polished along its whole length, but the others show signs of polish only on their working edges (cf. Lapp 1978: PI. 24), which are heavily battered. One item from the Persian Stratum 9 is a bell-shaped pestle (91 x 57 x 57 mm) (Fig. 24:3; see Davis 1982: Figs. 3.2, 3.4:5-6; Kirkbride 1966: Fig. 7:1-3 for Neolithic items; Lamon and Shipton 1939: PI. 106:11, of Iron Age date). Pestles of later (Hellenistic and Byzantine) periods, however, tend towards a squat, cuboid form (54 x 48 x 45 mm and 48 x 36 x 36 mm) (Fig. 24:4-5; cf. Iron Age items: Ben-Tor 1987: Fig. 58:15- 20; Lamon and Shipton 1939: PL 106:4-5, 10-13, where they are classified as 'hammers'). All the later specimens have in common two parallel worked edges, but only the wider and flatter one shows signs of polish, sometimes to a sheen, as a result of usage. Most of the pestles are quite light (weight range is 105-1010 g) and seem unsuitable for heavy pound- ing of tough materials. 3. Lower grinding stones (N = 24; Figs. 24:6-8, 25:1- 5, 26:1). These comprise 15 made of limestone, five of vesicular basalt, three of flint and one of finer- grained basalt. The materials for making lower grinding stones were probably selected for their durability, thus giving a long life to the object, but were not so hard as to make grinding too difficult a task. While vesicular basalt is considered by some authorities to be a highly appropriate raw material for such purposes (Xenophontos et al. 1988: 169, Fig. 1:2-3), the size of the pores in the City of David items is quite large and may reach 1-2 cm in diameter and/or depth; thus the powdery substance resulting from grinding could have fallen into them. However, due to their size and curvature several such items were classified as lower stones. When not too fragmentary, the items are mostly elliptical in plan view, with one or two oval specimens. The cross-section in most cases is plano-convex or shows a very slight concavity of the working platform (Figs. 24:6-8, 25:1-3, 26:1; see also Franken and Steiner 1990: Fig. 2-25:1; Gebel et al. 1988: Fig. 12:1; Lee 1973: Fig. LB2:a; Yadin 1960: Pl. CIV: 16; Yadin and Geva 1986: Figs. 38:1- 2,9, 39:1-2). However, in several cases the profiles showed shallow troughs along the object, their depth varying between 5 and 46 mm (Figs. 24:6-8, 25:2-4; Yadin and Geva 1986: Figs. 38:12-13, 39:8). These could have been formed intentionally when the item was manufactured in order to produce higher margins and thus prevent any loss of ground material, or may result from repeated grinding action over a prolonged period. When grinding, the worker moves the upper stone from the proximal end (i.e., the one closer to his body; see Clark 1988: 89-90) towards the center of the lower stone. The orientation of the lower stone might have been frequently alternated, so that the abrasion of its working edge would be equal on both ends; or it could have been rotated when one edge was too worn to be used. Another sign of prolonged use would be the very smooth, sometimes almost polished, surfaces of the stone. In such cases, working faces would have to be renewed by pecking (see below), in order to preserve the roughness necessary for the grinding action. Since striations resulting from heavy abrasion can be seen on the working surfaces of such items (Figs. 24:6,8; 25:1), and in a few cases (El/3486, El/21610, El/21655, G 4566) pecking could be detected on the surfaces, I tend to believe that the troughs observed on the items are the result of use rather than of the original shaping of the product. Pecking may also appear on the outer face of a stone (see Fig. 25:3). The heaviest complete specimen weighed 8740 g and measured 390 x 190 x 78 mm (Fig. 24:6). Broken objects often weighed more than 4 kg. 176</page><page sequence="184">Specimens in this typological class show a clear tendency to break transversally (Figs. 24:7-8; 25:2,4). This may be partly due to attrition and thinning as a result of repeated grinding (see also Clark 1988). However, it may also be viewed as the physically probable breakage pattern for an elon- gated object. 4. Grinding slabs (N = 9; Fig. 26:2-3). Four are made of limestone, three of flint and two of vesicular basalt. These objects are large, massive lower stones. Little effort seems to have been made to shape them. The working faces are smoothed and polished from heavy use, and most of the objects show a concave-convex section, attesting to con- siderable attrition. Although none is complete (Table 2), all the specimens are quite heavy (ranging between 1240 and 6500 g) and thick. In fact, these slabs are the flat, relatively wide lower stones known from both ethnographic examples (e.g., Reynolds 1968: Pl. Y) and archaeological material (Samuel 1989: 260, Figs. 12.4-12.6, 12.11). Their outer faces are not very convex and they can conveniently be laid on a flat surface (see also Fig. 25:4; cf. Davis 1982: Fig. 3.7). 5. Grinding bowls (N = 9; Fig. 26:4-5). Seven of these are made of limestone, one of basalt and one of flint. The two complete specimens (both of lime- stone) are quite heavy (9400 and 6145 g). Record- able diameters (N = 6) of the vessels range between 92 and 200 mm, again showing no clear temporal trends. In some cases the rim tends to be asymmetrical, i.e., one side is higher than the other (E2/1212, El/ 10913). The inside of the bowl is sometimes highly polished and smoothed by use (E2/1212; El/ 16504, seen in Fig. 26:5), and one item (El/21544, seen in Fig. 26:4) has signs of pecking on the inside of the bowl. In one instance (E3/12955) the bowl is wide and shallow, and is reminiscent of a basin. The specimens seen in Fig. 26:4-5 demonstrate that at least two techniques were used to manufac- ture bowls. The item in Fig. 26:5 was accurately executed and carefully finished and smoothed (cf. Ben-Tor 1987: Fig. 58:3; Gebel et al. 1988: Fig. 13:10; Yadin 1958: Pl. LIX:13; Yadin 1960: Pl. CIV: 10). Its function may not have been connected with domestic grinding activities (see also the mortar in Fig. 24:1). The item seen in Fig. 26:4 is a hollowed-out limestone boulder, probably made haphazardly from local raw material. A similar technique of executing lower grinding stones/bowls is known from Arad in the EB (Saban n.d.). The other specimens in the sample are more similar to the latter than to the well-made one. Yadin presents several intermediate cases of bowls that are carefully hewn but not well finished (1958: PL LIX:12; 1960: PL LXXVII:13,15; see also Gebel et al. 1988: Fig. 13:12-13). Wherever possible, the ratio of the depth of the hollow part to the diameter of the opening was calculated; it was found to range between 0.18 and 0.42. While still not sufficient to establish the boundary line between mortars and deep bowls, these results may form a first clue for such an analytical distinction. 6. Footed bowls (N=14; Fig. 27). Although these sometimes appear in the literature as footed mortars, I refer to them as footed bowls, based on the tentative criterion suggested above. This group is very homogeneous in terms of raw material: except for one item made of vesicular basalt, all are of fine-grained basalt. However, none of the specimens is complete. As a rule, the objects are well made and carefully finished (Fig. 27:2-5), except for one item where the basalt was left rough (Fig. 27:1). Some variation can be seen in the shape and length of the leg relative to the body of the bowl itself (Appendix A; Fig. 27). In one instance the vessel has a ledge handle (Fig. 27:3). Renewal by pecking could be observed on the inside of H 5041/1 (Fig. 27:2); this is rare in basalt, where pecking and striations are difficult to identify. This type is very well known from Iron Age assemblages (see Ben-Tor 1987: Fig. 58:2; Lamon and Shipton 1939: 14, and especially 12, described by them as a 'very common type throughout Strata V-I'; Yadin 1958: Pis. LIX: 12,17, LXII:5; Yadin 1960: Pis. LXXVII:2-6, CIV: 13, CXXVL12). 7. Bowlets (N = 6; Fig. 28:1-3). The six specimens are made of chalk, limestone (two items each), basalt and vesicular basalt (one each). Sizes vary considerably. The chalk bowlets (D 1/1 2527; El/ 17436, seen in Fig. 28:3) are rough and their outer faces are not well finished. The limestone objects are more finely made (Fig. 28:1-2). One of these (E3/ 12852) has a base that is not completely flat, and the hollow in the center is not symmetrical. The walls are quite thick in all cases (cf. Ben-Tor 1987: Fig. 177</page><page sequence="185">58:5-7; Yadin 1960: Pis. CIV: 11-12, CXXVLll). Kirkbride (1966: Fig. 7:5,7-9,11-12) defined a similar artifact group at Beidha as 'cup bowls'; their maximum size was 50-130 mm, and the depression in their center as deep as 20 mm. 8. Cup marks (N = 6; Fig. 28:4-6). Three are made of limestone, two of basalt and one of vesicular basalt. The group consists of small objects (Fig. 28:4) in which the stone itself is limited in surface area, and larger items (Fig. 28:6) in which the hollow is relatively deep and the sunken area is only a small fraction of the total surface of the boulder. Two specimens (Dl/13264, El/9686; Fig. 28:4-5) are actually manos (see below) with two smoothed faces. In the first case a cup mark was pounded into each face. At least one of these two holes (the deeper one) was used to pound or grind ocher, and clear ocher stains could be detected inside the hollow. In the second the hollow is deep and marked. Two additional items (D2/13830, D2/2039 6) bear two holes on one face. The former had been an upper grinding stone before the holes were pounded. The latter has an asymmetrical rim. 9. Basins (N = 5; Fig. 28:7-8). One is made of basalt, the rest of chalk and limestone. The depth of the basins varies considerably, ranging from 5 to 61 mm. They are rectangular or square in plan view: it is this latter characteristic which distinguishes basins from bowls. One basin (Fig. 28:8) has a series of shallow ledges inside the hollow and on the base. The object seen in Fig. 28:7 is well executed. Two walls incline inward, while a third is thick and projects outward. The sunken area in the center is square (see also Yadin 1960: PI. CIY:20, though considerably larger). 10. Upper grinding stones (N = 25; Fig. 29:3-4). The vast majority of these originates from Iron II strata (see Table 3). Fifteen are made of limestone, eight of vesicular basalt and two of flint. Since the upper stones were the active ones during the grinding action, i.e., those moved by human hands, their weight and size are significant factors in their production, and this class of artifacts is expected to be smaller and lighter than the lower stones. Only five items were complete (Table 2); these are small and light and relatively easy to handle. Complete examples measured 66 x 53 x 36 mm (250 g); 220 x 155 x 40 mm (1790 g); 132 x 93 x 37 mm (740 g); 1 1 1 x 96 x 61 mm (900 g); 108 x 75 x 46 mm (435 g). These items are unquestionably upper stones. Many of the almost complete specimens are only slightly larger and heavier (e.g., the one in Fig. 25:9), and can also be classified as upper stones. However, some items, a few of which are heavily damaged, were probably originally much more massive (Appendix A; Fig. 29:3-4; Yadin 1960: PI. CIV: 18). Apparently, upper stones may be divided into at least two broad categories: small items reminiscent of manos in size but not shape, and larger specimens similar to the lower components. The differences in size may reflect functional differences (see the discussion below). As noted above, distinguishing between relatively large upper stones and relatively small lower stones can be extremely problematic, especially since most of the objects are broken. While the rough outer surfaces of some stones served as a criterion to include them with the lower stones (they were difficult to hold in the palm of a hand), the reverse is not necessarily true, since some lower stones had smoothed outer surfaces. Fig. 25:8 is an example of an object which may be either a small lower stone or an upper stone, although it was classified here as the latter (cf. Yadin 1960: PL CIV:14-15,17; Yadin and Geva 1986: Figs. 38:5,6, 39:9). Working faces are totally flat (plano-convex or triangular in transverse and longitudinal sections), or slightly convex. This convexity was probably caused by the use of somewhat greater pressure on the lateral edges of the item during work, thus smoothing them and reducing their topography in relation to the central part. In one instance (Fig. 25:9) signs of battering were observed on the surface, and the implement may have served as a hammer stone. In three cases (D 1/6728/1, El/7876, E2/12050) pecking could be observed on the working surfaces of the upper stones, presumably to renew the surface and to improve grinding. On the whole, however, pecking appears less frequently than in the lower stones. 77. Manos (N = 7; Fig. 29:1-2). The mano is by definition an upper grinding stone made from a rounded item, with either one or both faces flat. In the present sample all objects but two are of Iron Age date. The item from Stratum 7 is made of 178</page><page sequence="186">limestone, while the others are made from a variety of materials: two of sandstone, one each of basalt, flint, limestone and phosphorite. The sizes of items vary from 70 to 112 mm (length), 57 to 98 mm (width), 24 to 46 mm (thickness); weight for complete items ranges between 325 and 975 g, i.e., at the lower range of upper grinding stones. Section shapes are round, plano-convex, rectangular or lens-like, while in plan view these objects are round/oval or rectangular. The 'handstones' de- scribed by Davis (1982: 87-96, Figs. 3.5:3-9, 3.4:3- 14) are such manos, as are Lee's (1973: Fig. LB25:a- d) 'small hand-stone grinders.' 12. Mullers (N = 7). These are upper stones made of small flat pebbles with ogival lateral working surfaces; i.e., the working faces are the narrow edges of the pebble. This results in most cases in a rectangular cross-section (in the present sample, in four out of seven specimens). Three items are made of limestone and one each of basalt, flint, vesicular basalt and sandstone. In one case (B 596) the muller shows signs of battering around its circumference, as if it were used at some point as a hammerstone, a type defined by Belfer-Cohen (1988: 191-92) as 'muller-hammer- stone.' Another muller (H 5041/3) is a secondary product. The two broad faces, formerly the working surfaces of an upper grinding stone, were smoothed and polished by use, and one of them was battered by hammering. Only then were the lateral edges used. 13. Round hammerstones. These are discussed by Rosen (this volume). They are mostly made of flint and show clear signs of pecking, either for their initial shaping from flint pebbles or for renewal of battered surfaces. 14. Elongated hammerstones (N = 2). One (B 568/2) is made of flint. The long plane of the item is covered with cortex; although it has the typical plano-convex cross-section of a grinding stone, it is therefore classified as a hammerstone. Battering signs appear on the edges rather than on the narrow distal-proximal ends. The other item (El /9067) is made of limestone. 15. Varia (N = 46; Figs. 28:9; Fig. 30; PI. 13). This group consists of objects of various shapes, types and raw materials. Many of these fall into the category of groundstone tools in terms of their manner of production, but rarely seem to have been used for grinding/pounding activities, as is the case with the objects described so far. One specific type, the chalk cylinders, appears as a distinct group within the 'varia' category (E3/ 13012/1, E3/13012/2, E3/13145, E3/13172, E3/ 13174, E3/13 175, E3/13187, E3/13193-13196, E3/ 15517, all from L. 1901A-B (Photo 20); El/9035 and El/9035/1 from L. 1352; Dl/13259; E2/12024; E3/19168; E3/15530). The majority of these objects was found in a pit dating from the 8th century BCE in Area E3, and only one (E2/12024) dates from Roman times. Some are modified by 'shaving' along the outer face of the object (Fig. 30:1-4). In most instances the ends are pointed, but in a few examples the end is blunt and rounded (Fig. 30:5). All of them were found covered with a yellowish- brown concretion, the nature of which is not yet clear. The location of this concretion on the face of the cylinder does not show any consistent pattern: it sometimes covers the length of the object on half of its circumference, and in other cases it appears in patches. Photo 20. Area E3, chalk cylinders from L. 1901B (ZR). 179</page><page sequence="187">In two instances (E3/13012/1, E3/13012/2) stria- tions are engraved deep into the soft chalk (Fig. 30:5-6; Photo 20). These are undoubtedly inten- tional and look as if they were made by rubbing a rough object, perhaps vegetal material, along the cylinder. The function of these objects is obscure. It has been suggested (A. Belfer-Cohen, personal commu- nication) that these were reserves of chalk: when chalk was needed in small amounts, for instance to be mixed with other materials or minerals for purposes of making a dye or a special plaster, the cylinder was either 'shaved' or rubbed and the powder collected and further processed. Such a process would have affected the thickness of the object rather than its length. The only complete item (E3/13172; Fig. 30:1) measures 62 x 112 x 112 mm, but others, broken transversally, vary in thickness from 36 to 159 mm. However, striations or 'shaving' do not occur specifically on the thinner objects, and thus cannot be directly correlated with their reduction. Three more specimens, morphologically identical with this group, are made of harder limestone (E2/ 1561, E3/13173, E3/12992/4). Another group that appears consistently, although not as abundantly as the first one, are the triangular and rectangular pebbles (E2/1572, El/8652, El/9957, E3/7548, G 4617, G 4829, G 11739, G 11794). These are made of hard, fine- grained limestone which seems to have been care- fully chosen, and one item (G 1 1794) is made of true dolomite. The base is wide and slightly convex (Fig. 30:7-8) or flat (Fig. 30:9-10; PI. 13:2-3) and is polished, probably as a result from being used as a grinder. In one case (G 4829; PI. 13:4) a hole exists on one side and striations, probably as a result of use, appear on the face rather than the base. Yadin (1960: PI. CV:l-6) presents an identical group, though at Hazor they were made of basalt rather than limestone. The function of this group is again unclear. Since two rectangular objects (Fig. 30:9-10; PI. 13:2-3), as well as several other groundstone items not avail- able for the current analysis, were found on the floor of the 'House of the Bullae' in Area G, it has been suggested that their existence is connected in some way with the manufacture of the bullae. However, they also occur in other contexts, and hence the manufacture of bullae was not in any case an exclusive use for them. Two pieces (El/10840, G 11385), dated to MB IIA-B and to the 7th century BCE, are elliptical, the latter showing a lens-like section. The former has a flat, worked face, while the opposite face has a groove running along it. The second item is made of sandstone and a very shallow groove runs along one of its faces. These objects are reminiscent of the artifacts known in prehistoric industries as shaft- straighteners, but their functions were not necessa- rily the same. Two votive basins, not functional in terms of grinding, have been included here. One is a tiny object with two holes in it. One is diagonal to the inner surface and goes through the wall; the other is a conical hole leading from the rim of the basin into the sunken area. A second object (Fig. 28:9; PI. 13:1) is well made, with its outer face smoothed and polished. A deep groove separates it into two parts, and is higher than the hole breaching the side of the vessel. Two objects attesting to secondary use are included in the 'varia' class. The first (Dl/13335) was formerly a mano made of vesicular basalt, into which a basin or a cup mark was later pounded. While reminiscent of some of the cup marks described above, the shape of the hollow and its extent are not clear because of the breakage (Fig. 30:12). The other item (El/9987) appears to have been used twice: once as an upper grinding stone with a smooth and shiny working face, and once as a lower stone showing a stepped longitudinal section on the opposite face. A curious elongated object (G 4296), probably made of sandstone, originated from a fill of the Persian period. All faces are well polished and smoothed (Fig. 30:11). It resembles Davis's (1982: 106, Fig. 3.11:1-2) type 1 of 'small abraders,' apart from the fact that it was not originally a natural pebble. One object, made of an unidentified magmatic material, is perhaps a jewelry mold (E3/7772; Fig. 30:13). The rest of the objects included in 'varia' are pieces that could not be attributed with certainty to any of the formal groups (see PI. 13:5). 16. Indeterminate (N = 2). Both are made of lime- stone and dated to Iron Age II. The difficulty in classifying these items stems from their indefinite characteristics (shape of section, etc.) as well as from their being broken. 180</page><page sequence="188">17. Broken (N= 15). These are fragments that could not be identified. Eight are made of vesicular basalt, three of basalt and two each of flint and limestone. Except for three, all the items were unmeasurable and weigh between 100 and 860 g. The remaining three items (Al/670, B 567/3, El/10912) may have been grinding stones, judging from their sections, although it is impossible to tell whether they were lower or upper ones. Another object (E2/7179) shows the longitudinal section of a saddle quern, but the finished working face shows the convexity and polish of an upper stone. C. Raw Material Of the eight categories of raw material, limestone is the most common (N = 72). It appears in almost all strata where groundstone tools are found. When sample size is somewhat larger (e.g., the Hellenistic period and Iron Age: Strata 7-8, 10, 12; Table 4) it is the dominant raw material. The term limestone includes several kinds of rock: many of the objects are made of fine-grained, hard limestone, and one is of true dolomite. The fine- grained limestone seems to have been chosen for artifacts requiring better finishing. However, for the manufacture of many of the lower and upper grinding stones biogenic limestone was used. This rock is morphologically very similar to kurkar: negative imprints of fossil mollusks abound, and the matrix is coarse. The effect of this texture on grinding is identical to that of vesicular basalt - it serves to enhance the effectiveness of the grinding action, but on the other hand much of the powdery product may get lost in the pores. The origin of both kinds of raw material is in the vicinity of Jerusalem, and they can be found in the various formations of the Cenomanian Judea Group. On the whole, limestone was chosen for making the grinding implements, especially the larger ones: 15 lower stones, four grinding slabs, seven bowls, one mortar and 15 upper stones are made of this material. Basalt is the second most common raw material (N = 34). Its temporal distribution is somewhat uneven, and the bulk of basalt items seems to Table 4. Distribution of raw material. Material!

This was apparently the preferred raw material for making footed bowls and pestles (see above). The problematic nature of vesicular basalt in a grinding implement has already been discussed; despite this, 13 out of 28 items made of this material are upper and lower grinding stones. Both basalt and vesicular basalt had to be brought to Jerusalem from a distance. The nearest sources are in Transjordan, though an exposure exists in Wadi Far'ah, some 30 km north of Jericho. Basalt could also have been brought from the Golan Heights and the Galilee. Flint appears in the form of larger artifacts (i.e., lower stones, grinding slabs and upper stones of the larger variety). The flint in this sample seems to be of an inferior quality, with many cracks and impurities, of a kind abundant in the vicinity of Jerusalem. The hardness of the material combined with its rough texture would make for efficient grinding/pounding tools, though limestone utensils were perhaps preferred due to their higher elasticity. Sandstone appears exclusively in Iron Age strata. The origins of this sandstone were probably in the Negev and/or Sinai (see Appendix B), perhaps explaining the fact that it was used mainly for smaller types of upper grinding stones (manos, mullers and 'shaft-straighteners' in secondary use). Chalk, a material common in the Judea Group rocks, is a very soft material which does not seem to be especially appropriate for making grinding implements. Indeed, except for six bowlets and basins, it was used almost exclusively for the manufacture of the pointed cylinders, a fact that explains its main appearance in a single stratum (12) and a single locus (L. 190 IB). D. Spatial Distribution Table 5 presents the loci in the excavation in which more than one item was discovered and their contexts. When discussing intrasite spatial relationships, accurate contemporaneity of the objects must be established. As a rule, floor contexts are the most effective means available of defining such contem- poraneity. However, as can be seen from Table 5, concentrations of groundstone tools are mostly the result of accumulations in fills or are derived from collapses. There are rarely more than two vessels of this category on a single unquestionable floor in any Table 5. Number of objects per locus (N &gt; 2).

Floors in Area G are exceptional in the relatively large numbers of such tools found on them. The types found together on any single floor do not necessarily form a complete set (i.e., lower and upper components) of either pounding or grinding kits. One may encounter only lower stones of various types, a number of broken objects or several 'varia.' When a formal set is found, it is difficult to fit them together, due to the high breakage rate. It is almost impossible to reconstruct the original size of the vessels and clarify whether an upper stone fits in size a lower one found next to it. On many other floors of different periods a single implement was found. There are 26 such instances (Table 6). In several cases such items are connected with installations, usually of unspecified character. 182</page><page sequence="190">Table 6. Floors with a single item: breakdown by area and stratum.

The number of items per area seems to reflect the size and volume of excavation rather than any differences in function of the specific area or socio- economic status of the inhabitants. DISCUSSION A. Function and Form One of the goals of the present study, the establish- ing of a chronological sequence of the appearance of various groundstone tools, proved impossible. This was due partly to sample size problems, but mainly to the nature of the items themselves. Ben-Tor (1987) has noted correctly that mortars and grind- ing stones are difficult to date typologically. He suggests that the daily use of such vessels required their production from a hard raw material, namely stone (preferably hard stone). This fact made them less breakable and hence their long use-lives and lack of fast, dramatic typological changes. When viewed in a chronological perspective, groundstone implements show very little variation since their introduction into the repertoire of human material remains. The earliest specimens dated to the early Epipaleolithic cultures of the Levant (19,000-12,500 years BP) (e.g., En Gev I; Bar-Yosef 1970: Fig. 97) are already fully developed and show considerable diversity. The same basic shapes, and a rather small range of raw materials, were exploited in the later Natufian, Neolithic (both pre-pottery and pottery) and Chalcolithic periods (see Bar- Yosef and Belfer-Cohen 1989: Figs. 6; 10:7-10,14- Epipaleolithic; Davis 1982: 73-174, Figs. 3.2-3.16, Pis. 3.I-3.III; Gebel et al. 1988: 122-26, Figs. 12-13; Kirkbride 1966: 32-36, Figs. 7; 9:1-3 - all PPNB assemblages from Chayönu, Basta and Beidha; Lee 1973: 263, 270 - Chalcolithic from Teleilat Ghassul; to name but a few examples). These are the same forms as those found in Bronze and Iron Age sites, the only exception being the appearance of footed bowls, apparently in the Late Bronze Age. Indeed, ethnographic evidence indicates that in certain rural societies the same types prevailed until quite recent times (Clark 1988; Reynolds 1968; Dalman 1933). Hillman (1984: 8) has been able to show that in the absence of modern technology there are very few ways of doing any one of the tasks associated with the stages of cereal processing. It would seem that the shapes of groundstone tools, in the absence of such modern technology, are so greatly determined by their functional role that changing fashions or traditions did not affect their basic form. Only slight changes, if any, have occurred over a period of some 20,000 years. This fact suggests a strong connection between function and form. This conservatism, on the other hand, may turn groundstone implements into prime objects on which stylistic variation, in the sense of Sackett (1977), may be observed. Sizes, however, do vary considerably, apparently indepen- dently of chronological factors, as an intra-assem- blage trait. Ever since their appearance, pounding/grinding stones have been viewed as part of the techniques for processing vegetal food which heralded the appearance of true agriculture. Mortars and pestles are traditionally seen as the means of processing nuts and acorns, while grinding stones {sensu lato ) were supposedly used for cereal processing (Byrd 1989: 178, and references therein). Such a hypoth- esis relates the gradual disappearance of the former over time to the establishment of fully agricultural communities in the Levant and the growing reliance on cereal foods. However, the pattern seems to be more complex. While ethnographic evidence from non-agricultural societies supports this suggestion (Kraybill 1977), both archaeological evidence and a variety of ethnographies indicate that this is not necessarily the case. Byrd (1989: 178-79), for example, notes that replacement of pounding by grinding may be related to reduced production costs rather than to changes in the types of vegetal resources exploited, as much more plant material could be processed in a shorter time. Other studies demonstrate that mortars and pestles were part and parcel of the processing of cereals, both free- 183</page><page sequence="191">threshing and glume wheats (see below). According to some ethnographers, the two distinct sets are used in different environmental circumstances. Experiments with an archaeological mortar (Samuel 1989: 266) indicated that pounding fragmented the grain into a large range of sizes and that a few kernels remained intact, while there was some spilling of material out of the mortar during the process of pounding itself. Thus, pounding seems not to have been a very efficient and economic method of grain processing. In Gwembe Valley pounding of cereals was carried out in times of 'reasonable plenty' (Reynolds 1968: 82). Grinding, on the other hand, is more economical and might have been used in years when harvests were poorer. Hillman (1984) has suggested another scenario. On the basis of his ethnoarchaeobotanical work in Turkey, he presented a model describing the stages of cereal processing from harvest to storage. The initial phases are different for free-threshing wheats (e.g., bread wheat, rye and barley which, when threshed, immediately separate into rachis seg- ments, grains and light chaff) and for glume wheats. The latter have to be pounded (and sometimes even parched) in order to release the grain from the spikelets. The final stages of grain processing are identical for the two types of cereals: after several winnowings and sieving the hulled grain (hulled forms of barley and oats, in the specific case) is de- husked by means of 'loose-set rotary querns, saddle and trough querns ... or by pounding in large wooden or stone mortars' (Hillman 1984: 6, Fig. 4). Bran removal at a later stage is also carried out by pounding, and the same is true for grain cracking, usually done by loose querning or pounding, but with different pestles I mallets from the previous stages (emphasis mine). A similar process was described for Palestine and Syria, where various implements were used to prepare the wheat: first mortars and wooden pestles, and only later on grinding implements (Dalman 1933: 273). Taking into consideration the evidence for temporal stability of the morphologies of ground- stone tools, and Hillman's above-mentioned con- clusion about the similarity of techniques in certain societies, application of this model to the archae- ological case at hand seems a legitimate endeavor. Clearly, for Iron Age strata the validity of the application is stronger, since they yielded the largest numbers of artifacts. An analogy can certainly be drawn between the ethnographic and the archae- ological data, based on relative geographical proxi- mity and similarity of climatic conditions (see Wylie 1985 on the use of analogy), and probably also on similarity of agricultural technology. Such a model may explain the appearance of both grinding and pounding vessels in one household. Admittedly, very few mortars appear in the City of David record, but bowls may have been used for finer pounding, perhaps in the later stages of grain processing. Moreover, wooden implements that might have been used in pounding/grinding have probably not been preserved. For instance, when experimenting with pounding, Samuel (1989: 259, Fig. 12.9) used a long wooden pestle, on the basis of Egyptian models and paintings dated to the el- Amarna period. Dalman (1933: 213) describes the use of wooden pestles and hammers in Lebanon, Syria and Palestine, and mentions the existence of wooden mortars, 20-25 cm high from base to rim and with a hole 12 cm deep; these were used for grinding coffee beans. Hillman's model can also explain the variety of shapes and sizes for a single type, if indeed they were used at various stages of processing. It must be stressed here that the model is difficult to test in the case of the City of David, due to the insufficient resolution of the data. Of the botanical remains analyzed from the City of David excava- tions, only two seeds of barley, identified to the genus level, have been reported (Liphschitz and Waisel 1992), thus rendering impossible any recon- struction of the agricultural products (e.g., free- threshing as opposed to glume wheats), and the processes necessary to prepare them for consump- tion. The same analyses do not support or refute the possibility that grinding/pounding vessels were made of wood. Boxwood has been reported from a floor in Area G, dated to the late Iron Age, but since it was imported from abroad (e.g., central and western Europe, Spain, North Africa, southern Turkey or northern Syria; Fahn and Werker 1992), it is hardly conceivable that it was used for daily implements in all households. Other wood remains from the excavations are of local species (Fahn and Werker 1992; Werker and Baruch 1992), which apparently have not been worked. Hillman's (1984) observations indicated that the spatial distribution of tasks connected with grain processing is strongly influenced by climatic condi- tions: in regions with dry summers, dusty tasks (e.g., threshing, winnowing and pounding) may be carried 184</page><page sequence="192">out on a large scale out-of-doors, thus preventing dirt and dust from entering the living quarters. This is indeed the habit of Arab villagers today. In such regions the harvest is bulk-stored in the form of cleaned grain, as opposed to wet-summer regions, where dusty procedures are carried out inside the houses and the grain is bulk-stored as spikelets. The City of David falls within the first category of climatic regions. Several mortars/bowls which were documented in situ were found inside rooms (Photos 21-22), stuck in the floors in order to prevent their movement while pounding (see also Samuel 1989: 259). However, given the fact that excavation concentrated mainly on built structures and less on open areas, the possibility cannot be ruled out that at any one period function-specific areas existed within the city boundaries (or outside the walls), where winnowing and pounding on a large scale were carried out. It is worth noting in this connection that the pestles recovered from the various habitation structures in all the periods represented in the sample are 'light-duty' imple- ments, not heavy enough to pound large quantities of grain with any efficiency. The processed grain may have been stored in the individual houses; where no constructed silos were discovered, jars could have served for storage. Another possibility is that such pestles served for other domestic pur- poses; for example, Dalman (1933: 213) notes that meat and onion, in addition to grain, were pounded in mortars. Photo 21. Area El, mortar (without registration no. - the object remained in the field) in situ on floor of L. 631 (YS). Photo 22. Area El, bowl (El /2 1544) on the floor of L. 2135 (YS). Grinding, as opposed to pounding, seems to have been a totally domestic activity, its goal being the final preparation of grain, i.e., making flour, for daily consumption. The amounts of grain that could be ground at one time on a lower grinding stone/ slab could not have been very large, taking into account the fact that such items are usually rimless. Samuel (1989: 262-66, Fig. 12.5) observed that no more than 15-20 ml of fragmented grain (after pounding) could be ground at a time, because flour fell off the sides. In order to collect the prepared flour, the lower stones were frequently placed on a pedestal or 'quern emplacement.' Such installations were found at el- Amarna (Samuel 1989: 260), and one was documented in situ in the City of David (Photo 23). The stone would be in many cases slightly tilted, and a catching basin for the flour placed below the distal edge. Clark (1988: 89) has stressed the importance of the tilt in terms of ease of work, and notes than when the angle is not built into the tripod metates used in modern Mexico, it is attained by propping up the instruments with small sticks or stones. Documentation of material in situ from other excavations (e.g., Yadin and Geva 1986: Photos 45, 48) and several occurrences on floors at the City of David (see Tables 5, 6; Appendix A) show that lower stones were discovered lying horizontally on the floor, perhaps because their 185</page><page sequence="193">Photo 23. Area G, lower grinding slab (without registra- tion no. - the object remained in the field) in situ in unexcavated installation L. 888, within room L. 818 (YS). supports have not been preserved or have collapsed. Another possibility is that a container made of organic material was placed at the distal edge of the lower stone, and the flour fell directly into it (cf. Reynolds 1968: Fig. Y; Dalman 1933: 223). The heavy weight of lower stones (see Appendix A) suggests that they usually remained in one place for long periods and were not carried around, particularly in cases where special installations were constructed for them. Manos and upper stones are easier to move around, but it is feasible that upper and lower stones formed permanent sets. The width of the lower stone and the length of the mano/upper stone are optimally equal (Reynolds 1968: 84; Samuel 1989: 262), although Clark (1988: 89) notes in his ethnographic example a special type of mano, the 'brazo,' which is extremely long and whose ends project out of the metate on each side. Attrition of upper stones is caused by rubbing against the lower ones. Hence, for the worn portions, the longitudinal section of the mano / upper stone will be complementary to the transverse section of the lower stone. If an upper stone is too curved to begin with, it will wear first in the center, while if it is too thin it will wear first on the ends. The lower stone will wear mostly in its center. As noted in the typological discussion, several of the City of David items demonstrated signs of heavy use in the smoothness and sheen of the working surfaces. In lower stones prolonged use gradually forms a concave surface, and the smoothed surfaces are usually in the center of the stone. Since both upper and lower stones should be coarse in order to perform the grinding action efficiently, smoothed surfaces were pecked. Pecking has been noted on many items (see the typological description), some- times leaving part of the surface smooth and thus creating signs of superposition of use-wear and repairs on the working surfaces. A study of 'battered tools' thought to have been used for processing of vegetal materials at the Armijo rocksheiter in New Mexico indicated that such items were actually tools for pecking other stones, apparently the groundstone tools (Dodd 1979: 234- 39, Fig. 7), and that the metates were produced from less durable stone than the tools which were used to batter and peck them. While no such analyses were conducted in the present case, it is perhaps possible that some of the artifacts desig- nated here as round hammerstones (Rosen, this volume) could actually have served such a purpose, being made of hard flint nodules. It is relatively easy to speculate about the functions of pestles, mortars (bowls), upper and lower stones or grinding slabs, despite the problems in the identification of the items themselves noted above. However, many of the vessels included in this study may not have been connected with food processing. Thus, Kirkbride (1966) suggested that the small 'cup-bowls' (bowlets in the current terminology) were cosmetic containers, or that they might have been lamps. The ocher marks discerned in the shallow depression on one of the faces of a cup mark (D 1/1 3264) indicate that the vessel was used for grinding the mineral or as a sort of palette for using it. Ethnographic evidence indicates that temper for pottery production may have been prepared by grinding the relevant minerals into powder on the lower stone/slab. Conventional use- wear studies, though able to pinpoint which faces of the stones were worked (where this is not obvious to the naked eye), are inadequate for identifying these various functions, since they focus on edge damage rather than the chemical residues on the working surfaces of the stones. Indeed, studies of ground- stone use-wear showed that the 'various types of 186</page><page sequence="194">use-wear are not significantly associated with different traditional functional categories of groundstone artifacts in the assemblage' (Gorman 1979: 48). Chemical residue analyses could perhaps clarify the functions of items such as cup marks, bowlets and votive basins, as well as the uses of mortars (as opposed to bowls) and the various materials processed on the grinding stones and slabs. B. Trade As has been demonstrated, the raw materials used for producing the groundstone assemblage are diverse and include both local and more exotic varieties. It is noteworthy that at some northern sites, such as Hazor (Yadin 1958; 1960) and Megiddo (Lamon and Shipton 1939: Pis. 106, 112), basalt and scoria served almost exclusively as the raw material for this class of artifacts (with one diorite item at Megiddo), while at Iron Age Qiri both limestone and basalt were reported. At Beth She'an (Yadin and Geva 1986: Figs. 38, 39) pestles were made of basalt, but there is no indication as to the raw material of the grinding stones. At sites in the Judean hills both limestone and basalt are reported (e.g., Lapp 1978), but the sample is extremely small. This pattern seems to corroborate the claim made by Xenophontos et al. (1988) that basalt was the preferred raw material for groundstone tools (at least for certain typological sub-classes), and to justify the extension of this claim from Cyprus to Israel. While inhabitants of northern cities were apparently satisfied with their local raw material, people in cities of central Israel invested the effort and the expenditure of importing basalt items. No waste from basalt working has been reported from any area in the City of David excavation. This probably reflects the fact that basalt implements were brought into the site in their finished forms, or at least had been roughly shaped before their arrival. Indeed, basalt blocks in the size required for manufacturing grinding/pounding tools would have been particularly heavy and difficult to move about. Even if this absence of basalt flakes and chips is attributed largely to excavation techniques, the items were probably brought into Jerusalem as half-finished vessels rather than as heavy blocks of raw material. Either way, there seems no doubt that basalt groundstone utensils were traded through an organized network and not by individual enterprise. A geochemical study by Xenophontos et al. (1988) suggests that the basalts of the Galilee and the Golan Heights were exported during the Late Bronze Age to Cyprus for the purpose of ground- stone production. While no such study has as yet been conducted on the City of David material, it is plausible that the basalt flows in these two regions were indeed the sources of raw material in the present case. Identification of the trade center is not as clear-cut as in the Cypriot trade, where Late Bronze Age Beth She'an is the suggested central point. For many of the periods represented in the City of David sequence, Hazor could have held this position. Items made of local material are found together with basalt and other exotic stones. The spatial distribution within contemporaneous loci fails to show any clear pattern; thus it is impossible to describe the socio-economic status of a household by the groundstone finds in it, since both categories - local and non-local - may be represented. Ethnographic evidence from Mexico (Clark 1988: 83-88) indicates a similar situation, in which certain raw materials are preferred and the tools made from them by specialist artisans are sold on the market for a relatively high price, with the cost of transportation figured into the price requested. Interestingly enough, there too the preferred mate- rials are volcanic rocks, and especially basalts with small vesicules. Local raw materials are also worked by specialists and the tools are sold on the market for a much lower price. While this analogy cannot be carried too far, it serves to suggest that both exotic and local groundstone tools, though they were part of the individual household's equipment, were produced and sold by specialists. Thus, mundane, daily utensils as well as rare materials and prestige items were circulated by a market economy. Some implements were made of very rare raw materials that had been transported over long distances (Appendix B). However, the frequencies of such raw materials are too small to attribute their appearance to any large-scale trade. On the whole, they seem to reflect sporadic events. CONCLUSIONS Although it forms an inadequate sample, the study of the assemblage from the City of David serves to 187</page><page sequence="195">illuminate several problems and potentials of groundstone studies. The major problem seems to be the offhand treatment of such artifacts in some excavations. Even when they are collected, documentation is usually less than good, and intralocus and interloci relationships are hard to understand. As could be seen from the discussion, such variables may bring new insights to the understanding of various social and economic processes rooted in the daily life of the population under study. Taking into account the stability suggested for morphological attributes of groundstone artifacts, research should concentrate on aspects of function, provenience and significance for interpreting the archaeological record. Once all groundstones are collected, they should not be treated in any physical manner, e.g., they should not be washed or scrubbed. Chemical residue analysis of the City of David material was impossible partly because of the fact that all the stones had been thoroughly washed. Provenience of stones can be established by means of pétrographie and geochemical analyses. When larger samples (or composite samples) are available, stylistic details may be discerned and better under- standing of trade and diffusion at any one period may be achieved. A point to bear in mind is the fact that due to their relative durability, groundstone tools have a long use-life and therefore do not undergo dynamic processes or changes in fashion, as opposed to pottery vessels. While interpreting their messages may be a somewhat more difficult task than deciphering 'conventional' archaeological find classes, and certainly a very different one, it appears to be a rewarding effort.

G 11794; L. 967 (GSI id G-l). Khaki dolomite. Polished hand specimen or pebble. Very dense, homogeneous mosaic of very fine anhedral dolomite crystals. Provenience could be the Judea Group carbonates in the vicinity of Jerusalem. 2. G 11739; L. 967 (GSI id G-2). Light brown arkosic sandstone. Polished hand specimen or pebble. Well sorted, medium grain size, very dense, hard and well cemented. Consists of 50% quartz grains, mostly subrounded to angular in shape, and 40% feldspar (microcline and plagioclase) grains. Accessory minerals include chert (5%) and turmaline, muscovite and opaque ore minerals. Provenience could be the Nubian sandstone of Sinai. 3. G 11876; L. 967 (GSI id G-3).* Dark brown limestone. Beach or alluvial pebble. Very fine grained, micritic fossiliferous limestone. Abundant clayey mineral, dense. Scattered plank- tonic foraminifera. Probably of Cenozoic age. This rock type is not known in Israel, and thus an unequivocal provenience cannot be assigned. 4. G 11999/6; L. 997 (GSI id G-4). Dark gray graywacke sandstone. Polished specimen. Very dense and hard, well sorted, subangular, medium-sized grain. Consists of about 60% quartz, 20% fine-grained chert, 15% altered ferromagnesian minerals, and various accessory minerals. The quartz grains are highly strained and partially recrystallized, indicating an original metamorphic * Items which were examined but did not show any signs of use as grinding/pounding utensils, and are therefore not included in the catalogue of Appendix A. provenience. Provenience cannot be assigned; not known in Israel. Could be derived from any of a number of provinces of clastic sequences derived from and adjacent to the Alpine Orogenic belt, the closest of which are in Cyprus and the Greek islands. 5. E2/4080; L. 665 (GSI id G-5).* Brown, ferruginous, quartz sandstone. Alluvial pebble. Consists of about 70% subrounded to angular, moderately sorted fine- to medium-sized quartz grains. Black iron-oxide cementing material comprises ca. 25% of the rock. Accessory minerals include turmaline, chlorite and zircon. Well cemen- ted, dense and hard. Provenience could be the Nubian sandstone of southern Israel and Sinai. 6. El/10954; L. 1660 (GSI id G-6). Dark gray diabase. Cut and polished hand specimen or alluvial pebble.

THE EVIDENCE FOR WEIGHING IN THE CITY OF DAVID I. The Topographical Distribution of the Early Weights Found in the City of David (Table 1) The areas in the City of David excavated by Macalister and Duncan (1923-1925), Crowfoot and Fitzgerald (1927), Kenyon (1961-1967) and Shiloh (1978-1985) are widely distributed over the surface of the hill and the part of the Tyropoeon Valley adjoining the western slopes. Not all of them yielded weights. For the excavations by Macalister and Duncan no details as to the excavation areas in the modern sense are available. They excavated in the large 'Field 7,' situated on the northern ridge of the Ophel, but we do not know the precise locations where the early weights were recovered by them (Macalister and Duncan 1926; Duncan 1931). Duncan (1931: 216 ff.) reported quite large numbers of such weights, but most of them have been lost (see Part C.II below). Crowfoot and Fitzgerald excavated a site that was called Field 10, situated to the west of Area G, actually in the Tyropoeon Valley, where a gate area was exposed. Kenyon opened thirteen excavation areas, S, R, M, H, P, A, AA, V, K, W, O, F and X, extending from north to south in the City of David. The majority of the weights found by Kenyon came from Sites A and AA in the northern section of the eastern slope, overlapping Macalister and Duncan's Field 7 and Shiloh's Area G. In the excavations in 1978-1985 directed by the late Yigal Shiloh weights were recovered from five excavation areas: from north to south, Areas G, J, E, D and B. The majority of early weights came from Areas G and E. The excavations of Area H on the western slope of the Tyropoeon Valley and Area A at the southern tip of the Ophel brought no early weights to light. As noted, Macalister's Field 7, Shiloh's Area G and Kenyon's Sites A and AA overlapped one another and the quantities of 31, 52 and 55 weights in these excavation areas are certainly most noteworthy. II. The Weights Found by Period and Size The finds recovered from different periods include weights of widely differing sizes (Tables 2-3). The picture formed by finds from specific periods may of course be a result of the exposure of areas and loci of different character, e.g. living quarters, a store or shop, an office, a market place or a gate area, all places where weights might have been kept or handled for a variety of purposes and for different quantities. Such widely varying practices of weighing seem to have been followed throughout history. People had an interest in using a balance for small as well as for larger, even substantial, quantities, and they pro- vided themselves according to their requirements with a single weight or a number of weights of different sizes. One should not conclude that the recovery of weights of a particular size range may, without further consideration, be taken as indicat- ing that weighing at the time was carried out only in that particular range. Furthermore, ancient weigh- ing was rarely analytical, but was mainly used for 204</page><page sequence="212">Table 1.

The weights are identified by their serial number in Part B.III of the Catalogue. Uninscribed mute weights are indicated by the letter 'm' after the serial number. Weights inscribed with the looped sign are indicated by the letter '1.' The attribution of the weights to the various standards is based on the author's study. Scott's interpretation (1985: Tables 2A and 2B) is recorded for each item in the Catalogue, Part B III. The material of the weights is limestone, dolomitic limestone or dolomite (Scott 1985), except for the nine weights in Column 4 which are of the following materials: W* 249, gray quartzite; W* 252, W* 265 and W* 298, black hematite; W* 240, basalt; W* 242, rhy olite; W* 246, chert; W* 302, bronze and lead; and W* 297, calcined limestone. These are foreign weights, though they may have served for weighing in Judea according to the standard indicated by the second part of the equation suggested. The occurrence of part weights of the nsp unit (W* 280) and of the bqa' unit (W* 303) is discussed in the text. weighing out portions, i.e. specified quantities, of materials or for verifying the mass of such portions. For such weighing practices the ancients must have had access to balances with different-sized beams and pans: some with a small delicate beam and small pans for weighing small quantities of precious metal (sometimes gold, but generally silver) for payment in trade or as a tax, and others with a beam of substantial dimensions and appropriate scale pans. The weighing practice of a particular period is characterized not only by the number of weights and the standards used, but also by the size of the weights kept and used. In order to describe the weighing practice in this respect, the weights found are classified into two classes: a) bag-and-counter weights, i.e. the smaller weights consisting of hand units, unit-part-weights and multiple unit weights up to a mass of 184 g; and b) store weights with a mass of 185 g or more. The importance of the size differences in an assemblage of weights recovered cannot be over- stressed. A balance to weigh a mass of 300-700 g must have not only pans of suitable size to accommodate the wares on one pan and the weight stones on the other, but also a beam of adequate length and strength for the total load on the beam, which would have been from 600 to 1400 g. Neither a beam of such dimensions nor appropriate pans have been found. Balance beams were probably made of wood or bone, but wood is not often preserved in the climate of Jerusalem. Bronze balance beams are known from the Near East, though discarded bronze articles were usually collected and melted down in order to reuse the metal. Balance pans (or receptacles serving as such) could have been made of metal or a variety of other materials, such as wood, bone, leather or textiles, but none have been preserved. Ancient pans of metal are known but none have been found in the City of David; the thin sheet metal of such pans was particularly susceptible to corrosion. The scale weights recovered in the excavations of 1978-1985 and treated in this report date from two main periods: the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. From the Bronze Age in the City of David excavations there are 27 weights. The majority of the scale weights recovered in the excavations are from the Iron Age: of 121 weights from stratified Iron Age contexts, one is dated to the 12th- 1 1th centuries BCE, nine to the 10th century, one to the 9th century, 45 to the 8th century and 13 to the 7th, while another 45 are dated from the mid-7th century to 586 BCE. The Persian period Stratum 9 yielded 24 weights, many of which are probably intrusive from the Iron Age. To these finds must be added 30 weights of the same type, material, shape and mass which were found in later strata and on the surface (Catalogue, Parts A.II and A.III); they comprise 23 bag-and-counter weights and seven store weights. From the Bronze Age we have nine bag-and- counter weights and 18 store weights; from the Iron 207</page><page sequence="215">Age there are 62 bag-and-counter weights and 59 store weights. The large number of store-size weights invites the question of what commodities were weighed in Judean times. Could it be that materials other than precious metal were handled according to precise mass measures? Or must we assume that silver in substantial quantities was handled by weighing on a balance either among the people, or between the inhabitants and the autho- rities, or for record-keeping by the treasury? The Eshtemo'a hoard of silver fragments (Yeivin 1990) provides evidence for the weighing of a large quantity of silver. Three of its jugs are inscribed 'five,' indicating a mass measure of five Mesopota- mian minas of 841 g in each jug, while the whole hoard amounted to thirty minas or a talent of 25,320 g (Eran 1990). Of the smallest weights, the part-weights of the Judean weight units, only very few have been recovered in excavations. We must ask ourselves why part-weights are so much rarer than unit weights. One possible reason is that in the course of excavation large stone objects, even if they do not appear to be tools or weapons, are easily distin- guished by excavators. Moreover, larger scale weights will be recognized as soon as the excavation procedure includes steps for further investigation of suspected stone weights, including a determination of their mass on a modern balance. Part-weights, on the other hand, with their tiny dimensions and mass (see Barkay 1981) and the possibility of their being covered by soil particles, are less conspicuous. It is not surprising, therefore, that so few have been recognized and published. Can we expect that large numbers of such part- weights did indeed exist? Weighing of small quantities in antiquity was generally not analytical in purpose. The precise determination of small quantities of precious metal was probably of interest only to a silversmith, goldsmith or jewelry mer- chant. Weighing in other trades or for payment of dues and taxes consisted of quantifying silver to a stipulated mass and of course of checking the mass of such a quantity. This type of weighing required a scale weight of the correct size for the particular transaction. Therefore very few weights of standard fractions of a hand unit, a quarter, third or half, would have been appropriate for such weighings. It is thus understandable that in contrast to the 25 weights of one, two or three shekels found, only seven part-weights have been recovered. III. The Materials and Shapes of the Weights The majority of the weights recovered in the City of David excavations are made of two kinds of stone: limestone and flint. Both were and still are available in the surroundings of Jerusalem. Under limestone we include here carbonate rocks in their various types of calcite and the dolomite group. These are usually classified as limestone, dolomite or chalk. However, precise mineralogical identification is of little importance in metrological considerations of scale weights and would only have been obtainable from a mineralogist, who would have needed to perform a test on a sample from a stone object, thereby perhaps spoiling the shape of the artifact. Consequently no such examinations were per- formed and all such materials are described here as 'limestone.' The other local material from which weights were made is flint, a variety of chert.1 This material occurs as individual nodules or as layers of nodules in limestone or dolomite, or as an erosion product in wadi gravel. In Palestine flint artifacts have not so far been considered as scale weights. When flint artifacts are found at prehistoric sites, they have been described as tools for various purposes (or as components of tools), as well as weapons or the cutting parts of weapons. Occasionally archaeologists have pointed out that the use of flint continued into historical times. Franken (1982: 29) recorded flint spheroids on Iron Age sites and proposed for them a use as 'throwing balls,' but remarked that a peaceable purpose could not be excluded. The inhabitants of Jerusalem must have learned early on that the local geological strata of dolomite and limestone provided two kinds of raw material suitable for working into scale weights. The earliest weights appear to have been made of flint. Rough spheroids and cuboids of flint could be found or freed from dolomite and limestone matrices. In preparing scale weights from such material a piece could have been selected by size with the mass of the intended weight in mind, so that the blank would require a minimum of gross shaping by flaking. The blank would have to be given a base (an essential feature for a scale weight) and have its mass adjusted by hammer dressing and pecking to the desired mass norm. In shape the flint weights from the City of David are either cuboids, pecked all over, or more often 208</page><page sequence="216">spheroids, on which a segment has been split or flaked off in order to form the base. A base area has become recognized as a distinctive feature of rotund scale weights. The shaping of a base is also an important step in production in order to reduce the blank to the desired mass without spoiling its general shape. When a rotund weight was used on a balance pan its flat base prevented its rolling and slipping off the pan, a useful feature as the round sheet metal pans of balances were generally only slightly concave and were not provided with a raised edge. Out of 38 weights from the Bronze Age 18 are of flint; among 121 Iron Age weights there are 46 flint weights. The inhabitants also learned how to obtain pieces of dolomite or limestone (some containing a flint kernel) and by pecking, grinding and polishing to make such blanks into the shapely dome-shaped weights of Judean times. Flint as a material for weights is not limited to the City of David. Petrie recorded some made from flint among his acquisitions and excavations of weights in Egypt (Petrie 1926: Nos. 2313, 2815, 2887, 3335, 3370, 3741), and listed some more as being made from a material of the silicate group. Flint bulbs have been found in Ramesside Egypt in the laborers' camps in the Valley of the Kings (Valbelle 1977). There, these stones are inscribed with hieratic signs indicating the wares (and in some cases their mass) or the number of objects that had been dispatched to the workers in the valley. On modern weighing of these stones, it was found that their mass approximately represented a mass value in Egyptian new deben units of 91 g. These inscribed stones can certainly not be regarded as scale weights in the proper sense. They were not made for repeated use and therefore had not been given a designed shape and a worked surface safeguarding the incorporated mass against diminution. The inscribed stones from the Valley of the Kings have been regarded as a record of the stores issuing the wares. However, as they have been found scattered about the camp sites in the Valley, it is more likely that they served as a kind of manifest accompanying the wares to the addressee. The foreman of a group of laborers could, on the basis of the information inscribed on the stone, determine the quantity of the wares arriving by weighing them against the inscribed stone on a balance without using proper scale weights. That the Egyptians had thought about such check weighing, resulting in a 'yes-or-no' answer, is shown by their belief in the weighing of the heart of the dead against the 'feather of truth' or the 'statuette of Maat.' A number of weights found in the City of David are made of materials not available in the neighbor- hood of Jerusalem (Table 4). These weights raise the question of whether they were fashioned in Judah, which was probably not the case. By this assump- tion such weights are rendered still more intriguing. Did they conform to one of the Judean weight standards, or did they represent a foreign standard known to the Judeans which had been applied in commercial transactions with a foreign partner or with regard to wares originating from a foreign country?

This mass represents ten Egyptian old deben (10 x 13.50 g), the mass unit which appears to have been the progenitor of the 'Shekel of the Sanctuary' and the bqa', its half (Exod. 30:1 1-16). At the time to which the alabaster ring has been dated, the 8th century BCE, the Temple tax already had a reduced mass value, and that discrepancy may possibly have been the motive for breaking it. Stone ring weights have not yet received compre- hensive study. A number of such artifacts have been recovered from Near Eastern civilizations, all with- out inscriptions or markings. For none of these finds has their mass been determined, though their use as scale weights had been suggested; cf. e.g. Tepe Hissar (Schmidt 1937: 219, 311), Tepe Gawra (Tobler 1950: 205), Tell Nebi Mend (Pezard 1931: 42 f., Pis. 33-34) and Shtora (Kuschke 1954: 110, PL 5A). From Egypt two such artifacts have been recorded (Petrie 1920: 28; 1926: 11), both represent- ing a Mesopotamian standard. In Palestine mute stone ring weights, mostly of basalt, are numerous. Some are of large size with a substantial mass; others are small, varying between 30 g and 250 g (Table 5). B. THE MASS STANDARDS I. The Weight Equipment of Judah and Israel By the beginning of this century a number of weights from ancient Palestine were known, sug- gesting for the first time a comprehensive treatment (Conder 1902; Benzinger 1903; Moors 1904; Sayce 1904). Some of the weights recovered in and around Jerusalem were found to be different from any weights from the ancient Near East. They are fashioned in a style which came to be described as dome-shaped, a style represented among ancient Egyptian weights with many variations.2 In Judah these weights were made of locally available lime- stone or dolomite (see above, Part A.III). At the same time other weights made of basalt, diorite and hematite had been found in Judah. Thomson (1926: 312) described their shape as cones, cylinders, discs, 'torpedoes' (i.e. grain-shaped) and half spheres. Of the dome-shaped limestone weights there are five types which bear an inscription: those with a Table 5. Stone ring weights in Palestine.

Once the numerals accompanying the looped sign had been recognized as the Egyptian hieratic numbers 5, 10 and 50, the connection of these Judean weights to Egyptian metrology became clear. Their mass of about 455 g, 91 g and 45.50 g was that of five Egyptian deben, one deben and one half deben, equalling 50, 10 and 5 Egyptian kite. As the Judean weights with the looped sign included specimens designated by one or two unit strokes, i.e. as one shekel and as two shekels, the unit-value of the Judean shekel turned out to be about 11.40 g (norm 11.375 g), and it was concluded that the hieratic numerals for 5, 10 and 50 on these weights with the looped sign were understood in Judah as 4, 8 and 40 (cf. Scott 1985: 198). It was further observed that the Judean weight inscribed 'pym' had a mass of one twelfth of the eight-shekel weight (91 g = 12 x 7.583 g). But as a value of 7.583 g did not constitute an original Egyptian mass unit, a review of the metrology of other neighboring civilizations of Judah leads to the recognition that the pym weights represent a Phoenician standard adjusted to the Egyptian deben. Much thought has been devoted to the under- standing and explanation of this Judean weight equipment as a unified metrological system. As the weights with the looped sign form the majority of the weights recovered - both unit pieces and multiples - their unit is seen as the basis, the Judean shekel. From this shekel standard it was deduced that the pym, nsp and bqa' units had been intended as 2/3, 4/5 and V2 °f the shekel. However, after a review of the artifactual evidence these conclusions are convincing only for the pym unit. As for the bqa' weights, there are many with a mass above the half value of the shekel, i.e. heavier than 5.70 g. As the bqa' is a mass unit for the payment of the poll tax (Exod. 38:26), it would seem an unlikely development that a tax unit increased over time. Furthermore, the mass of the poll tax was defined as a 'half shekel' after the shekel of the sanctuary (Exod. 38:26). Petrie (1926: 17, sec. 42) recognized an early Egyptian mass unit, originally of 13.61 g (Petrie 1926: VI, 'Key to the Standards'). He recorded weights of this standard from the early dynasties and up to the 12th Dynasty. Recently Egyptologists have indeed recognized an early Egyptian mass standard with a unit of such size (Helck 1980: 1202, ca. 13.60 g; Hornung 1967: 16, ca. 13.80 g). The weights inscribed 'nsp' have a mass ranging from just below eight grams to just above eleven grams, a spread which makes it unlikely that these Judean weights developed from a single model. There are indeed two foreign sources which probably provided models for this extraordinary size variation among the Judean nsp weights. A northern source is suggested by the Ugaritic mean- ing of 'nsp' as 'half (Gordon 1965: 50, 447; Scott 1970: 62) and by mass units in Mesopotamia of 10.91/21.82 g (Hultsch 1898: 199, 201, 'Register of Weight Norms' and discussion there). A southern source is indicated by the various raised kite values between 9.30 and 9.85 g which developed in times following the 18th Dynasty (Hultsch 1898: 198, 200) and spread along the Levantine coast and into Syria. No stone weight inscribed 'maneh' or 'mina' has turned up, either dome-shaped of limestone or of any other type or material. Josephus Flavius used the term 'mina' in his account of Crassus visiting the Temple to see the gold kept there. Stating the quantities of gold, Josephus adds: 'The mina with us is equal to two and a half pounds' {Ant. XIV, vii, 1). In modern times this interpretive equation has been calculated on the basis of the classical Roman libra of 327.45 g as 2l/i x 327.45 g = 818.60 g. However, in the development of Roman weight metrology there was an earlier unit, 'as libralis' or 'as librarius' of 273 g, later called 'litra italike' (Chantraine 1961: col. 630 ff; Regling 1930: 39, 353, 713, s.v. as, libra , uncia). This earlier pound unit, also divided into unciae (12 x 22.75 g = 273 g) had remained in use side by side with the classical libra. A find from Herodian times provides evidence for its use in Palestine. Some years ago a fine drum- shaped weight made of hard limestone turned up in Jericho. Inscribed 'LEIN,' it has a mass of [13,514 g] and, estimating the loss from a few chips and scratches, must originally have weighed ca. 13,600 g.3 Its abbreviated inscription, reading 'year 5, italike [litrai] fifty,' explains its mass as 50 x 272 g for the Italian litra, i.e. 0.37% below the norm of 273 g. It is this Italian litra by which Josephus defined the Hebrew mina, which accordingly must have had a mass of 2l/i x 273 g = 682.50 g. While we have no 211</page><page sequence="219">further evidence that Josephus Flavius was indeed aware of this early Roman pound, it is surprising that the much later Josippon, writing in the 10th century in southern Italy, was able to improve on the definition given by Josephus. From his text (Flusser 1978: Vol. I: 165, Vol. II: 119), it appears that Josippon did know of different mass values for libra and litra and their unciae. In order to define the 'litra' he used the canonical Islamic weight unit of his time, the widely known 'mitqal' (in Hebrew 'mishkal') and explained the litra as 60 mishkalim, i.e. 60 X 4.55 g = 273 g,4 thereby arriving at a mina value of 682.50 g. This mina was neither an invention of the Hebrews nor a latecomer in their land. A weight of such a mina from a very early period has been recovered in Mesopotamia (see below, Part B.II). Its mass appears to have been derived from fifty Indus Valley shekels: 50 x 13.65 g = 682.50 g. Weights of such mina size (and of their parts) have been found all over the Near East (Table 6). At the City of David such mina weights and part- weights of such a mina have been found in strata from the Bronze and Iron Ages (Table 7). These weights are made from locally occurring flint concretions, fashioned into cuboids or into spher- oids with a base. In comparison with the sculptural and geome- trical weights from Mesopotamia and Egypt their shape and manufacture appear primitive. They are unsightly but stable and show the desire of the inhabitants to measure rather substantial quantities of materials or products on the balance. These weights are distributed over the different strata as follows: 16 from the Bronze Age, 47 from Iron Age II, two from the Persian period and four from Roman strata. The question arises why were all weights in use at one time not made from the same material. Did these flint weights serve to weigh particular wares? Were the dome-shaped limestone weights intended for weighing precious metal in small quantities - up to two dozen shekels - while the flint weights served for consumer goods and other materials? Or might the dome-shaped weights have remained in the hands of persons of a particular class, while the common people were Table 6.

If that was the case, one wonders why weights of this kind have so far turned up only in sizes much heavier than the dome-shaped weights. II. The Mass Standards of Egypt, Mesopotamia and Phoenicia Well-known land routes connected the land of the Canaanites and the Hebrews with their immediate and more distant neighbors. The maritime route from the Nile Delta along the Levantine coast to Aegina and Athens brought influences from Egypt to Phoenicia, the Syrian coast and Greece. Thus the mass standards customary in these lands became known to the Canaanites and the Hebrews and foreign weights were handled by them. During the 19th century discoveries and studies of weights from Mesopotamia and Egypt made archaeologists and historians aware of the weight equipment of the ancient Near East. Comprehensive treatises on weighing in antiquity were published (Queipo 1859; Brandis 1866; Hultsch 1882). Petrie's finds and acquisitions in Egypt had been regularly published since 1886. They have been analyzed by Hultsch (1898) and by Petrie himself in his concluding catalogue of 1926. However, some of these works were disregarded outright. The detailed survey of ancient weights, Die Gewichte des Alterthums by F. Hultsch (1898), was derided by the German scholar of Greek and Roman history K.J. Beloch, who compared it to 'a witch's kitchen' (Beloch 1925: Vol. I, 2:333). And Flinders Petrie's great catalogue Ancient Weights and Measures (1926), concluding a lifetime of excavating, collecting and studying weights from Egypt, was at the time not even regarded as worth acquiring by either the Library of the Palestine Department of Antiquities or the National and University Library of Jerusalem. True, at the beginning of the present century important knowledge for a full understanding of weight metrology of the ancient Near East was still lacking. Although Hultsch (1882: 197 ff., 'Register of Weight Norms') recorded a unit of 90.96 g (the Egyptian ten-kite deben of the 18th Dynasty) as well as a unit of 13.64 g, he had no sources to explain the latter as an early Egyptian mass unit. Weights of this standard from the Indus Valley civilization were not known at that time (see Piggot 1950: 181), and Egyptologists had not yet recognized a parallel early mass unit in Egypt (see now Hornung 1967: 16, about 13.80 g; Helck 1980: 1202, about 13.60 g). In Mesopotamia three groups of mass standards have been observed: the standards of the shekel of 8.186 g and the raised shekel of 8.41 g, both 213</page><page sequence="221">originally connected with the weighing of gold. For weighing the more common silver, standards based on shekel values between 10.20 and 10.91 g were in use. A singular Mesopotamian mina weight from very early times represents a further standard in Meso- potamia. Inscribed 'Dudu - one mina in wool,' it weighs 680.485 g5 (Table 6). This mass can be seen as 50 shekels of 13.6097 g, the unit value now known from the Indus Valley (norm 13.65 g), or as 60 shekels of 11.3414 g, a shekel value known in Mesopotamia which much later became the shekel of the Judean Kingdom. Weights of this mina size and its parts and multiples have been recovered from all over the Near East, in Greece and in Palestine (Tables 6-7). The Egyptian kite of 9.096 g, the tenth of the 18th Dynasty deben, continued into the later periods of intensive commercial contacts over the whole Near East. These connections gave rise to a number of raised unit values from about 9.35 to 9.85 g, known from Egypt to Syria. It seems that the higher values also came to be seen as a diminution of the Mesopotamian unit of 10.91 g and as a half of the Ugarit shekel. On the Levantine coast of the Mediterranean, where the influence of Egypt met that of Mesopo- tamia, a further system of mass standards devel- oped, attributed to the Phoenicians. Mass units of 7.28, 7.48 and 7.58 g and double units of 14.56, 14.96 and 15.16 g appeared and became known through commercial contacts all over the Near East. When coinage was first issued on the Lebanese coast, it was the Egyptian mass unit of 13.64 g which Tyre adopted as a coin standard for more than a hundred years, stamping its earlier coins with Egyptian symbols: the crook, the flail and the owl (Naster 1967: 3, 22). The coin standard was later raised, apparently when the originally quite pure silver, too soft to give coins a long life without loss of mass, was replaced by silver hardened by alloying with a little copper. C. THE EARLY WEIGHTS RECOVERED IN JERUSALEM PRIOR TO 1978 I. The First Finds of Early Weights in Modern Times Recoveries of scale weights in Jerusalem and its immediate environs amounted up to World War I to only a few pieces (see Catalogue, Part B.IV, W* 306- 315). Two different types, both made of limestone, had attracted attention: weights of spheroid shape with a flat base, a form later described as 'dome- shaped,' all similar but of small mass; and weights shaped like a disc or drum, some appreciably heavier than the artifacts of the first type. Some of the dome-shaped weights were marked with signs and others with inscriptions in ancient Hebrew letters. Weights so marked or inscribed became recognized as the earlier ones. It was thought that this group of weights represented a kind of official weight system. This understanding delayed the realization that stone weights of other types and materials were used by the inhabitants of Jerusalem at the same time, as archaeological excavations were to show. The size of the earliest dome-shaped weights recovered seemed to indicate a custom of weighing only small quantities of silver ranging from a few grams up to about 90 grams, presumably for use in payment either in trade or in discharging taxes and duties. Two finds in particular show that weighing of silver by householders and merchants was not restricted to such small quantities, but that silver was also weighed in far larger quantities. However, the particular circumstances prevented the under- standing of the artifactual evidence in both cases. In 1889 a large limestone weight (W* 308) turned up in the courtyard of the White Fathers at St. Anna, north of the Temple Mount (Chaplin 1890; Conder 1891; Cré 1892; Schick 1892; Guthe 1894; Cler- mont-Ganneau 1899). A rather clumsy ellipsoid in shape, it has a smoothed surface and at one pole a carefully carved cavity, a distinctive feature of scale weights.6 The stone artifact weighed 41.9 kg, i.e. 50 minas of 838 g.7 The find lapsed into oblivion when its inscription was recognized as a modern and amateurish fake (Guthe 1894, citing Prof. Euting, Strassburg; Rafaeli 1920/21; Barrois 1932). The other weight (W* 233) came from the excavations of 1923-1925 in the Ophel, where a very large lime- stone artifact was recovered. Macalister and Dun- can (1926: 30, Fig. 23) did not consider the object a scale weight, nor did they suggest any other use for it. However, they published its main dimensions and a section and described its material and surface treatment. From these details the artifact can be recognized as a scale weight of Herodian times. As noted in the catalogue, W* 233 can be seen as a talent weight of 60 minas of 728 or 748 g the mina. The artifact appears to have been lost. 214</page><page sequence="222">Both these artifacts, so skillfully produced as scale weights, show that some rulers of Judea had provided themselves with a scale weight of sub- stantial size, a custom which by the Iron Age had become widespread. Archaeological excavations in Mesopotamia, Elam and Egypt have brought to light a number of large weights ranging from a quarter talent to a triple talent (Table 8). Whether in Judea these two weights were indeed used to weigh such enormous quantities, or whether perhaps they were exhibited near a monumental balance purely to indicate the wealth of the ruler, we do not know. The making of such huge weights, as well as their use, would have required an especially large and strong balance beam capable of being loaded with double their mass, and also appropriate smaller weights.8 Table 8.

II. The Finds Made by Macalister and Duncan (1923-1925) In 1923-1925 excavations9 were undertaken at the City of David by R.A.S. Macalister, the excavator of Gezer, assisted by J.G. Duncan, who served as acting director during Macalister's prolonged ab- sences from Jerusalem. Macalister, through his experience at Gezer (1912: 25 f., 278-97), had become thoroughly disappointed with the study of ancient weights,10 while Duncan, who had worked with Flinders Petrie and admired his research on ancient weights, was keen to discover Hebrew weights. At the close of the excavations Duncan (1925: 23) believed that a large number of weights had been recovered: he spoke of hundreds from different periods. However, when the excavators came to write the final report on the excavations, Macalister restricted the section on weights to the enumeration of a mere handful of artifacts whose identification as weights appeared to him certain: two pieces had an inscription, one was marked, another had lead fillings for adjustment of its mass and two could be recognized because of their shape. They were all from the Herodian-Roman period. No dome-shaped weights were mentioned in the final report, though according to Duncan (1931: 216, 218) 27 had been found, of which 13 had inscriptions and the 'familiar mark' of the looped sign. On the division of the finds between the Mandatory Department of Antiquities and the sponsoring institutions, some were allotted to the Palestine Exploration Fund in London, but only 16 of these survived World War II and are now in the custody of the Institute of Archaeology in Lon- don.11 The majority of the weights, as well as the numerous stones which Duncan thought were weights, were left in Jerusalem, but were apparently not even accepted for registration by the Mandatory Department of Antiquities. Some of the weights from the Ophel excavations of 1923-1925 were identified in 1974 when J. Zias, the curator of the Mandatory period collections of the Israel Department of Antiquities, drew the author's attention to a box marked 'For Exchange' and containing weights and other artifacts. The weights among them were recognized as coming from the Ophel when it was realized that they included some of the items reported by Macalister and Duncan (1926: 157) and that others had numbers and letters pencilled in an English hand 215</page><page sequence="223">on them. To these finds belongs the marked 40- shekel weight (W* 228) which had already been registered in the collection of the Department in 1940.12 Whether Macalister envisaged that Duncan would publish their finds of weights at the Ophel we do not know. In any case, in 1928-1929 Duncan took the opportunity of his Croall Lectures on 'Digging up Biblical History' to speak about 'Early Hebrew Weights' (Duncan 1931: 216-27). From what one learns from the Croall Lectures about Duncan's approach to metrology and his approach to the study of ancient weights, Macalis- ter' s distrust of Duncan's ability to recognize and interpret the scale weights of the Hebrews appears on the whole to be justified. However, one must applaud Duncan's efforts to recover and safeguard all such implements: marked and mute weights, the smallest and the largest, all had been saved by him in the field. This material would have made a great contribution to the understanding of weights and weighing in Judean and Herodian Jerusalem had it become properly known and recognized as relevant at the time. Duncan was one of the first to realize not only that the Hebrews weighed small quantities of valuable materials either for the needs of the householder's shopping in the market or for their payments to the authorities, but also that large quantities, even of hundreds of shekels, must have been weighed on a balance. Some aspects of the weights listed in Part B.I of the Catalogue call for comment. The customary material for local weights was limestone in the different varieties found in the surroundings of Jerusalem. However, there are some weights made of other kinds of stone, e.g. basalt (W* 213) and hematite (W* 216 and W* 222). Similarly, although dome-shaped weights were predominant in Judean times, other forms must be noted: an inverted frustum of a cone with a domed top (W* 205 and W* 22213) a truncated pyramid (W* 220), a rectangular block (W* 223), a cuboid (W* 224 and W* 227) and a rough subglobe (W* 225). It must be suspected that such weights of non-local material and of other than the customary shape are foreign weights which had been brought to Jerusa- lem by traders or had been copied locally from foreign weights. These weights may have been taken over from earlier times and show that the inhabitants of Jerusalem were not only familiar with foreign weight standards, but found some of these weights useful locally - a fact which raises questions about the relations between the local and foreign weight standards and contemporary knowledge of such relations. W* 204 of 7.34 g, marked with a unit stroke, is 3.2% below the pym norm of 7.583 g (i.e. V12 x 91 g = 2/3 x 11-375 g). One may not be justified in regarding this weight as a pym: being midway between Phoenician unit values of 7.28 and 7.48 g, it appears to represent a Phoenician unit. W* 228, inscribed with the looped sign and the hieratic number 50 (its mass being 454.50 g = 40 x 11.3625 g = 5 x 90.90 g), provides striking evidence for the mass relation of the Judean shekel norm to the Egyptian deben norm of 90.96 g, the 'new' deben of the 18th Dynasty. It is only 0.07% below the norm value. W* 233 must have been an atypical talent weight. Macalister and Duncan (1926: 30, Fig. 23) found the artifact important enough to report on it in detail: 'A block of hard limestone in shape the frustum of a cone with slightly convex sides, having a short cylindrical projection from its broader end.' The excavators did not recognize this artifact as a scale weight, nor did they discuss its character or purpose. Hard limestone was the usual material for the better class of scale weights during various periods in Jerusalem. However, its shape is unique. In making such a large weight there was the problem of giving the artifact a shape which was special and different from other artifacts, and further enabling the blank in its final stage to be adjusted to the desired mass without spoiling the intended shape. With the ellipsoid talent weight of St. Anna the half-spherical cavity at one end of its axis served this purpose. On W* 233 from the Ophel the rabbet at the base rim enabled the craftsman to adjust the artifact to its intended precise mass. The rabbet also enabled those who lifted and handled the weight to get a good grip on the heavy object. For the four weights W* 229-232, Duncan (1931: 226) stated their mass only in English pounds (272, 4, 10 and 19 pounds).14 From his explanation 'taking 450 g to represent one pound,' one conjectures that these weights had been weighed in Jerusalem on a decimal platform balance and that he translated the result into round figures of avoirdupois pounds for the benefit of the audience of his Croall Lectures. There is no longer any reason to follow Duncan in such an approximation, and 216</page><page sequence="224">the mass of these weights is given in grams based on the exact value of the English pound (453.60 g). In view of the lack of information as to the material and shape of these weights, one would hesitate to approach their metrological interpreta- tion were it not for the fact that three of them (W* 229-231) do represent the same standard: either the Phoenician mina of 756 g (= 100 x 7.56 g) or the Judean multiple unit of 453.60 g (= 40 x 11.34 g).15 The unit value of 7.56 g incorporated in these weights is quite near the norm value of the Judean pym of 2/3 x 1 1.375 g = 7.58 g. Could one see this as a late occurrence of a weight practically represent- ing a multiple of the pym unit? In this connection one notes the unusual artifact of soft limestone found at Tel Shuqaf (Stern 1982: 216, 111. 362) on which the letters 'pym' are engraved in 'common Aramaic letters of the Persian period.'16 W* 232 is reported by Duncan as having had a mass of 19 English pounds (8618 g). Since he was unable to interpret the result, it is likely that he had rounded off the true figure. If he rounded down the mass value to exactly 19 lb, only about 4 ounces (113.80 g) or 1.3% of its mass as weighed would have been suppressed by Duncan, yielding a true mass of 8731.80 g or 12 minas of 727.65 g. Just as parallels of 756 g for the mina value have been cited, so may parallels from Jerusalem be cited for the mina value of 727.65 g which appears to be incorporated in W* 232. Hultsch already recognized among the finds made by Petrie in Egypt separate Phoenician mina values of 718, 748, 758 and 764 g (Hultsch 1882: 418; Hultsch 1898: 204, Index). On the other hand, if Duncan rounded up the mass value of W* 232 by about 3 ounces (85 g) in order to obtain 19 lb, we obtain a true figure of about 8530 g, i.e. the mass of a quarter of the talent of 34,120 g, composed of fifty minas of 682.50g, which is the mass-unit described by Josephus Flavius as 'our mina.' For two additional very large scale weights, see below, Section D.III. One, also from Macalister and Duncan's excavations, was never weighed. The other (W 123) derived from the City of David excavations in 1978-1985. Besides W* 228 discussed above, which almost precisely represents the Hebrew shekel norm, there are two weights (W* 218 and W* 211) among those bearing the looped sign which have slightly inexact unit values, one on the high and the other on the low side. Five other weights are substantially below the norm: three (W* 206, W* 207 and W* 209) with unit values of 11.05, 11.06 and 11.14 g and two further ones (W* 215 and W* 217) with unit values as low as 10.98 and 10.996 g. These low unit values approach the unit value of 10.765 g of the mute dome-shaped weight W* 214. As this problematic feature also occurs in all later excavations, it is discussed below in connection with the finds from the City of David excavations. III. The Finds Made by Crowfoot and Fitzgerald (1927-1928) In 1927-1928 Crowfoot and Fitzgerald excavated in Field 10 on the western slope of the City of David 'in the Tyropoeon Valley,' a site 'about 120m south of the [Ottoman] City Wall and due west of the Field [No. 7] excavated by Duncan.' One of their finds was the Judean shekel weight W* 237 (90.50 g = 8 x 11.313 g), inscribed with the looped sign and hieratic 10. Among the other stones for which Fitzgerald (Crowfoot and Fitzgerald 1929: lOlf.) had found it 'impossible to be certain of the purpose for which they were made,' there are three inscribed ones which from their description and mass may be considered as weights from Judean times. The variety of standards represented among these weights can be understood today: W* 238 of 173.50 g = 16 x 10.844 g is a weight of high nsp value, while W* 235 of 49.50 g = 6 x 8.25 g and W* 236 of 66.50 g = 8 x 8.313 g represent Mesopota- mian shekel units. IV. The Finds Made by Kenyon (1961-1967) At the time when Kathleen Kenyon began excavat- ing in Jerusalem, 22 dome-shaped limestone weights with the looped sign were known (Yadin 1961). The recovery in 1963 at the City of David of 18 weights with this symbol, together with five weights other- wise inscribed and 12 mute ones, was therefore understandably described by Scott (1965: 128) as a 'veritable treasure trove,' although these weights did not form a single assemblage. Altogether 67 weights probably dating from the Judean Kingdom were recovered in Kenyon's excavations in Jerusalem: 27 among them show the looped sign. However, the weights did not all come from one context. While 25 weights turned up as single finds at different loci, 32 occurred in two 217</page><page sequence="225">groups, a group of 18 weights from Loci 669.1 la-b and another of 14 weights from Loci 669.34, 34a and 42 (Tables 3.1, 3.II). How are these contexts to be characterized, and what kind of activities were carried on at these premises? They may be understood in various ways: each of them may have been a weightmaker's shop, a place from which official weights were distributed, an office dealing with taxes or the shop of a merchant. Some understanding in this respect may be gained by analyzing the composition of the groups of weights. The Judean shekel weights with the looped sign form the main component in two groups. In both the weights with the looped sign are joined by uninscribed (mute) dome-shaped limestone weights representing the same standard and also by part- weights of the Judean gerah series. Moreover, there are nsp weights and pym weights, some inscribed and some mute. Two weights of a somewhat irregular dome shape must be especially noted: their metrological value can be related to more than one standard. a) The mute hematite weight W* 252 of 22.53 g - a foreign weight - can be explained as 1 x 22.53 g, a heavy Mesopotamian royal shekel, or perhaps as 2 x 1 1 .265 g, a Judean shekel value albeit less than 1 % below the shekel norm. b) The limestone weight W* 279 (162.34 g) is inscribed with a particularly looped shekel symbol, 'a curved line closing an upper loop to form a figure eight' (Scott 1985: 201, n. 29), similar to one from Megiddo observed by Lamon and Shipton (1939: PL 104:37), though lacking any defining hieratic numeral. From its mass W* 279 could have represented 20 shekels of 8.117 g or a rather low Mesopotamian shekel value of 16 units of 10.146 g, a nsp value. As the looped sign has never been found applied to a weight of Mesopotamian shekel value, it must be concluded that W* 279 was marked with this unusually shaped loop in order to be taken as a Judean shekel, though it does not have the mass of one. Twenty-three of the 25 weights found singly were dome-shaped (one is fragmentary and does not appear in Table 3. II). These weights of units or multiples display variations of unit size similar to those found in the two largest groups of weights. Among them are: seven clearly inscribed Judean shekel weights (W* 241, 243, 289, 299, 295, 300, 305), four mute Judean shekel weights (W* 239, 287, 292, 301) and two mute weights of higher nsp value (W* 246, 288). A similar correspondence is found in the seven weights in Table 3. ID. Scott (1965: 131), considering 'the baffling differences in mass of scale weights bearing the same or related inscriptions,' rejected the determi- nation of standards by striking averages without making allowances 'for loss in mass through wear and deterioration' and 'loss through damage.' To take these factors into account he developed an elaborate system of classifying the condition of the weights (Scott 1965: 132-33; 1985: 207-209). Ana- lyzing the resulting tables at great length, he was led to note 'anomalies' (Scott 1965: 133; 1985: 209); he concluded that 'not all the twenty-one [shekel weights with the looped sign, which can be classed fair or better] when first circulated, represented an identical standard shekel value' and consequently thought that 'the evidence from only 21 scale weights is inconclusive.' As the model for the Judean shekel value has been recognized in the Egyptian (new) deben of the 18th Dynasty - eight shekels equalling one deben (Scott 1985: 198) - it appears reasonable to search for possible foreign models for the other Judean units. The contemporary norm for the pym unit was indeed also linked to the Egyptian deben: twelve pym units of 7.58 g equalling one deben. It appears however that the mass of the three Phoenician units of 7.28, 7.64 and 7.86 g was well known in the Near East and Egypt, and that occasionally one of these values was taken as a model by the weightmaker, perhaps on the suggestion of the client who ordered the weight. The case of the nsp weights attracted much early attention, in the first instance because of the name inscribed (see the discussions in Scott 1970; 1985: 205-206). While Scott had 23 nsp weights before him, Kletter (1991: 146-48, Table 6) listed 51 items. Tabulating the mass data of these weights according to their frequency, and disregarding the weights with extremely irregular mass, one obtains mina values (fifty nsp units) surprisingly near to minas observed by Hultsch (1898) among Petrie's finds from his campaigns in Egypt between 1886 and 1897. The comparable quinquagesimal weight stan- dards have been rightly designated by Hultsch (1898) as Mesopotamian (Babylonian). Mesopota- mian counting and weighing has often been described as exclusively sexagesimal (Lehmann- 218</page><page sequence="226">Haupt 1916). However, a decimal/quinquagesimal substructure has also been recognized. It appears that such weights had as wide a distribution in the Near East as had the weights of sexagesimal standards. There are six weights made of material other than the usual local dolomite or limestone: W* 242 (rhyolite), W* 246 (chert), W* 249 (quartzite), W* 252 and W* 265 (hematite) and W* 288 (bronze). W* 242 (45.50 g - 4 x 11.375 g) and W* 252 (22.53 g = 2 x 11.265 g) could have been used for weighing according to the Judean shekel unit with the looped sign. W* 265 (30.09 g = 4 x 7.523 g) could have represented a mass of four pym, while W* 246 (32.43 g = 3 x 10.81 g) and W* 288 (4 x 10.838 g) could have served to measure nsp units of the higher range. There is only one inscribed gerah weight (W* 280), but there are three small mute artifacts (W* 247, W* 263 and W* 273), all dome-shaped, which may represent 6, 7 and 8 gerah, i.e. parts of shekel units of 11.00, 11.075 and 11.286 g respectively. The group of weights found in Loci 669.1 la-b (W* 247-265) contains seven intact shekel weights inscribed with the looped sign. With these inscribed weights, the two mute ones (W* 264 and W* 261) and the foreign weight (W* 252) the owner could have weighed any quantity from 1 to 47 shekels. Measuring silver quantities of 24 and more shekels was common: special weights of such large sizes were provided, as shown by the 24-shekel weight (W* 278, 268.30 g) and the 40-shekel weight (W* 228, 454.50 g) recovered by Duncan. Such large quantities indicate the size of the balance which must have been available: both pans were loaded with a total mass of 900 g and more. A balance with a substantial beam was required, equipped with scale-pans much larger than the small pans recov- ered in the Armenian Garden Area (Tushingham 1985: No. 5480, Fig. 72.7, diameter ca. 5.6 cm). Together with the Judean shekel weights at Loci 669.34 and 34a were two pym weights. One of them (W* 268, 8.39 g) is clearly too heavy to be accepted without further consideration as a regular pym. Scott described its shape as an 'irregular polyhe- dron' and concluded that the artifact had remained unfinished. The numerous facets making up its surface perhaps indicate that it was not fashioned by a professional weightmaker: it is what may be called a private weight. Its mass, reminiscent of the Mesopotamian shekel of 8.37/8.41 g, enabled the owner to receive 10% more silver than a regular pym would have weighed. Among 38 dome-shaped limestone pym weights whose mass was published (Kletter 1991: Table 7), 29 pieces weigh under 8 g (7.18 to 7.95 g) and nine pieces over 8 g (up to 8.591 g). Such a large number of heavy pym weights cannot be regarded as fortuitous. Originally modeled on one-twelfth of the new Egyptian deben (V12 x 91 g = 7.583 g), over time the Judean pym followed the Egyptian deben in its increase to a heavier mass up to 7.95 g, or came to be related to the Syrian multiple of 10 x 9.40 g or 10 x 9.50 g. These influences, however, were not strong enough to exclude the influence of the Mesopotamian shekel units of 8.186/8.41 g, as well as the parallel Egyptian unit of 8.53 g (Hultsch 1898: 198, Index). Indeed among the foreign weights is W* 246 (32.43 g = 4 x 8.108 g), representing four Mesopotamian shekels. Together with the Judean shekel weights in Loci 669.34 and 34a were two inscribed nsp weights. They differ widely in their mass: W* 269 (10.62 g) is 13.8% heavier than W* 274 (9.33 g). Such variation in mass among nsp weights is now well known. Among 48 nsp weights (all dome-shaped limestone and intact) there are nine weights with a mass from 9.80 to 10.00 g and five weights from 10.10 to 10.63 g (Kletter 1991: Table 6). Even among the inscribed shekel weights, there are two weights (W* 270 and W* 275) with a similar unit mass of 10.895 and 10.798 g, i.e. 4.2% and 5.07% below the shekel norm of 11.375 g. These also compare with the 10.829 g of the fossil echinus marked with the looped sign (Barkay 1978: 217). Further, among the mute dome-shaped weights there are two, W* 254 (42.22 g = 4 x 10.556 g) and W* 255 (43.39 g = 4 x 10.848 g) whose mass is below the shekel norm by 7.2% and 4.6% respectively. All these weights are reminiscent of the weight from Samaria of ca. 2730 g inscribed as 1000 quarter-shekels of ca. 2.73 g, i.e. 250 shekels of ca. 10.92 g. In the Mesopotamian weight system a unit of this size was the light silver shekel, half of a heavy shekel (Hultsch 1898: 199, 201, Index). The lighter of these silver units was particularly common all over the Near East. It is possible that 'nsp' means 'one half (Scott 1985: 206). The Mesopotamian silver units therefore explain the royal court weight of Samaria as well as 219</page><page sequence="227">the Judean nsp weights of higher mass. However, this Mesopotamian weight standard did not have as strong an influence in Judea as did the Egyptian new deben of 91 g on the Judean shekel series. Nsp weights fluctuated in mass: specimens of lower mass approximated a unit value found in Ugarit (Scott 1985: 206), while the nsp weights of higher mass followed the light Mesopotamian silver shekel, some at a reduced value. It was a novel step in the Kingdom of Judah for all scale weights to be made in one style and from local stone. However, in unit mass the weights display an eclectic adoption of various weight units common in the Near East and known to the Judeans from contact with their neighbors and with the surrounding civilizations. Returning to the question of how to characterize the contexts in Site A where the bulk of the weights were found, the possibility of a weightmaker's workshop or an office or store of the administration can be excluded. No raw material or blanks for weights were recorded (for a blank, see Catalogue, Part A.III, Annex). While the condition of most of the weights was described by Scott as 'good,' for seven only a 'fair' condition was noted. At the offices of the weights administration one would expect neither foreign weights nor mute ones, unless the latter were in first-class condition just before being inscribed. One must thus conclude that the contexts were the premises of merchants. D. THE EARLY WEIGHTS FROM THE CITY OF DAVID 1978-1985 I. The Dating of the Weights In the City of David excavations in 1978-1985 the weights recovered were precisely recorded according to their findspot, and for each its locus, stratum, period and date were determined. The date indicates the approximate time at which the weight was deposited at the findspot. For fragile pottery one may assume that its production occurred not long before its deposition. However, for stone weights, much more durable and of greater value than many types of pottery and likely to be held in safe keeping for a long time, a similar supposition is not warranted. The making of a stone weight may have been coeval with the dating of its findspot but it may also have been fashioned earlier, even by some generations. A stone weight may have been made locally or at some other place; it may have been obtained in a neighboring country or even in a distant land. It may have been an heirloom in the family of its owner, or it may have been brought to its findspot by him or by a foreign trader. Unless it was found in a weightmaker's workshop, a realistic dating for the origin of a weight must come from the evidence of parallels. II. Weights Found in Bronze Age Strata (W 1-27) The oldest Bronze Age weights in the City of David, dated to the 31st and 29th centuries BCE, are an uninscribed flint spheroid (W 1), with a mass of 408.70 g = 50 X 8.174 g, and the equally mute limestone weight (W 2) of stele shape with a mass originally of 672.50 g = 50 x 13.45 g. W 1 represents the Mesopotamian half mina, or can be seen by the Egyptian old deben standard as thirty shekels of 13.623 g. W 2 and W 15, both likewise mute, are remi- niscent of the ancient Mesopotamian weight from Girsu-Lagash, inscribed 'Dudu - mina in wool' and with a mass of 680.485 g. Weights of this size and related mina parts have been found all over the Near East and are represented among the finds from the City of David (Tables 6-7). It was a mina of this size that Josephus Flavius described as the 'Mina of the Hebrews,' which he defined as two and a half Roman litra, i.e. 2X¡2 x 273 g = 682.50 g (see above, Part B.I). As these weights of local production are mute, we cannot determine whether at the time W 1 and W 2 were regarded as multiples of certain shekel units or, as seems more likely, as two kinds of minas. With these earliest weights we are already confronted with uncertainty regarding the mass standard which an uninscribed weight may have represented in the eyes of its ancient owner or his counterpart in trade. All the weights from the Middle Bronze Age (W 4-24) are also uninscribed. Some can be seen as representing more than one standard. W 18 (429.30 g), for example, may be seen as fifty shekels of 8.586 g, though this is a value 2% above the Mesopota- mian norm of 8.41 g, as well as thirty shekels of 14.31 g, 1.65% below the Phoenician norm of 14.55 g. Both deviations are within a tolerance of 1.5% to 2% either way, which seems acceptable for weights of these times and materials. Three Late Bronze Age weights (W 25-27) 220</page><page sequence="228">illustrate the ability of the ancients to find various materials and produce weights of different shapes: W 25 is a basalt rhomboid block, W 26 a black stone of half-grain shape and W 27 a pebble. The first two represent weights of a Phoenician stan- dard, while the third conforms to a Mesopotamian silver standard. As shown by the weights recovered from the Bronze Age, the inhabitants of Jerusalem were familiar with weights and weight standards of the neighboring civilizations of Egypt, Mesopotamia and Phoenicia. There are two late 'descendants' of the mina of Dudu: W 2, a full mina, and W 15, a two-third mina weight, a mina size described by Josephus Flavius as the 'Mina of the Hebrews' of his time. III. The Early Weights from Iron Age Strata (W 28-148) Only one weight (W 28) was recovered from the Iron Age I Stratum 15: it represents a Mesopota- mian silver half mina. Among the nine weights from the 10th century BCE we have one representing an Egyptian standard (W 31), three on a Phoenician standard (W 35-37) and four weights according to a Mesopotamian standard (W 30 and W 32-34). The mute W 29, fashioned in the Judean style, is remarkable as representing not only Judean shekels (16.90 g = V/i X 11.267 g) but also Mesopotamian units (16.90 g = 2 X 8.45 g). The single find from the 9th century BCE, the mute weight W 38, has a mass of ca. 68.40 g. Judging by its shape and material, it is not of local origin; it may have represented five Egyptian old deben, but could have been seen as one tenth of the Hebrew mina. Calculating its mass in Judean shekels results in the multiple six, a step unknown among the Judean weight equipment. Fifty-two weights (W 39-90), all of stone, are dated to the 8th century BCE, including 24 of flint, 1 1 of limestone, two of basalt, one of alabaster and three pebbles. Flint was used for weights of both Phoenician and Mesopotamian standards (eight and 15 respectively). Among the weights on Phoenician standards, all the known varieties of the shekel values are represented (Hultsch 1898; Lehmann-Haupt 1916). Among the weights on Mesopotamian standards, six represent the common shekel in its two ranges (8.186 and 8.41 g), while 24 weights appear to represent various values of the silver shekel (the lower ranges of ca. 10.50, 10.91 and 11.22 g and the higher ranges of 11.375 and 11.46 g). The Egyptian old deben standard appears to be represented by W 58, W 74 and W 77 with unit masses between 13.50 and 13.95 g, and the Egyptian gold unit by W 51 with its mass of 12.70 g. From the 7th century BCE we have 13 weights (W 91-103), all of stone (eight limestone, two flint and one each of basalt, hematite and some other kind of stone). Among these weights is one dome-shaped limestone artifact (W 96), marked with an unusual loop imitation and two unit strokes. Its mass is nearly 2% above the norm value. The other limestone weights are in the shape of a disc, a cylinder, a globoid, a cushion and a pebble, while two are grain-shaped. Forty-five weights (W 104-148) were dated to the mid-seventh century to 586 BCE. Among the materials are flint and limestone (15 of each), chalk and hematite (three of each), basalt and goethite (one of each), as well as two pebbles. Flint was used for weights of Phoenician, Mesopotamian and Egyptian standards, always for sizable weights. An unusual very large weight (?), W 123, is discussed below. From the Persian period there are 24 weights (W 149-172): one of bronze (W 154), one of pottery (W 161) and 22 of stone (eight of limestone, three of chalk, three of hematite and one each of flint, basalt, marble and quartz, as well as a pebble and three stones of undefined kind). The Judean shekel standard appears to be represented by ten weights, but there is only one (W 169) inscribed with the loop sign and hieratic 5. The dome-shaped black stone weight W 165, with a mass of four Judean shekels (45.55 g = 4 X 11.388 g), is marked with two small cavities which appear to denominate it as two units of 22.785 g. Early weights have also been recovered as intrusive in later strata. Thirty such weights were found in Strata 8 to 5 (W 173-192) and as unstratified or surface finds (W 193-202), eight of them as fragments. Among these finds are four weights of flint, 18 of limestone, one of chalk and one pebble. It is noteworthy that among the flint weights are two small weights: W 185 of 37.80 g = 5 X 7.56 g and W 187 of 184.75 g = 16 x 11.547 g. The shape of the inscribed weight W 123 is a rectangular paralleliped, though not of angular 221</page><page sequence="229">sharp-cornered form; the face with the inscription is well-rounded, as are the faces of the lateral sides. These features raised doubts as to whether the stone served as a constructional element in the wall and led to its consideration as a stone weight. Very large stone weights are rare. Some are fashioned as real works of sculpture, more as rotund geometric bodies, and even boulders have served such a purpose after adjustment by chipping and pecking. An example of the second class will be discussed below. Both of the fashioned type require an experienced craftsman. One should therefore not be surprised to find artifacts of simple shape being prepared as large scale weights. The stone, weighed on the large Sartorius balance of the Departments of Weights and Measures of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, was found to be 18,971 g in mass. Five main spots of damage are discernible on the stone, causing a loss of mass; from plasticine complementation this loss may be estimated as about 270 g. There are additional chippings and rubbings and small flat cavities on the stone's surface; thus the original mass may have been 19,240 g. Such a mass is reminiscent of a half talent of one of the so-called 'Phoenician' shekel standards: 18,950 g = x¡2 X 37,900 g = 2500 shekels of 7.58 g 19,100 g = y2 X 38,200 g = 2500 shekels of 7.64 g 19,650 g = V 2 X 39,300 g = 2500 shekels of 7.86 g The first standard is the norm of the Judean pym unit (7.583 g = x'n x 90.996 g), and the third is still within the range of one-twelfth of the Egyptian deben in its later stages. In fact, our stone comprises 2500 units of 7.736, i.e. a pym 2% heavier than the norm. Taking into account how simple it would have been to fashion an available large stone into a scale weight, one must consider the possibility that some of the artifact's feature which appear to us as damage may have originally been part of the stone or were the result of adjustments to the desired mass, perhaps in a secondary stage of its production or use. In such a case, we would have to take the stone at its weight as found. Dividing 18,971 g by 2500 units, we obtain 7.588 g for the unit, a value surprisingly near the norm for the Judean pym unit (7.583 g). As a large scale weight from the City of David, our object from Area G joins another extraordinary stone weight found by Macalister and Duncan in Field 5 of their excavations in 1923-1925 (Macalis- ter and Duncan 1926: 29-30, Fig. 23). This artifact (apparently now lost) was not recognized by the excavators as a scale weight. However, they found it so outstanding in shape, quality of manufacture and size that they included in their report its precise measurements, a detailed description and a section drawing. It was a block of hard limestone in the shape of a frustum of cone with a slightly convex mantle face, dressed with a comb pick, and with a short cylindrical projection from its broader end. The excavators reported precise measurements: a) for the conical body, h 317.5 mm, d1 152.4 mm, d2 292.1 mm; and b) for the cylindrical projection, h 50.8 mm, d 279.4 mm. To calculate the volume of the artifact, the convexity of the conical part was taken into account by the method of approximate volume integration based on the section drawing. Multiplying the total volume of seven 'slices' and the volume of the cylindrical projection of the cylindrical projection by the specific weight of Jerusalem limestone, the mass of the artifact obtained was between 46,130 and 47,000 g. Such a mass corresponds to 6000 units of 7.689 g and 7.834 g respectively. In evaluating the result it should be noted that the lower value is higher than the pym norm of 7.593 g by only 1.4%. Further, in calculating the convexity of the cone's surface we were limited to the dimensions taken from the section drawing, in which the convex curves are probably the result not of measurement but of the draftsman's visual impression. Calculating the artifact as if it were fashioned with a straight mantle face to its conical part gives a mass of 46,763. The difference between the lower value of 46,130 g and the hypothetical mass of 46,763 g is great enough to accommodate a mass of 45,000 g (6000 x 7.583 g) while still leaving the conical part of the artifact with a marked concavity. Our conclusion, therefore, is that this outstanding artifact was a scale weight of either 6000 pym of 7.583 g or 4000 Judean shekels of 11.375 g. Both these large stone weights found in 1980 and in 1923- 1925 confirm that in the City of David there were large-scale activities of handling and weighing quantities of silver. This point was already shown by the recovery in Kenyon's excavations there in 1963 of a large group of scale weights. E. CONCLUSIONS The finds from the City of David provide a unique 222</page><page sequence="230">opportunity for investigating a very large sample of stone artifacts as to their possible use as scale weights. The weights found in the City of David excavations, joined by the finds from earlier excavations by Macalister and Duncan and by Kenyon, have opened a wider view on the practice of weighing in Jerusalem in the Bronze and Iron Ages. There is evidence that weighing on a balance was practiced with stone weights of widely differing sizes. There were tiny grain weights, weights of shekel units and shekel multiples, as well as mina weights, some of substantial mass. For the Hebrew mina mentioned by Josephus Flavius there is now artifactual evidence. This mina, it turns out, was the descendant of a very ancient artifact from Sumer. The mass standards used in Egypt, Mesopotamia and Phoenicia were known in Jerusalem. The deben of 13.65 g, the ancient Egyptian unit, must have been the origin of the 'Shekel of the Sanctuary' in Jerusalem, with 'Beqa its half (Exod. 38:26). However, despite the more than 300 weights found up to now in all excavations at the City of David, one must realize that for each century of the Iron Age we still have only relatively limited artifactual evidence for the practice of weighing. For the 8th century BCE, from which the greatest yield has come, there are 52 weights, i.e. only one weight for each two years. One must hope that future excavations make further evidence available, if special attention is paid to the recovery of such elusive artifacts, which have often been regarded as tools or weapons or have remained altogether unrecognized. NOTES 1 . The investigation of flint weights in the City of David excavation was not carried out as a comprehensive study of the total yield of flint artifacts recovered. The aim was to test the supposition that flint may also have served as a material for weights by applying the usual criteria for a scale weight (a geometrical or otherwise deliberate shape, the presence of a base, and a surface treatment making diminution as well as deterioration recognizable), and finally by weighing the selected object and checking its mass against one of the known mass standards. The selection was aimed at objects of no more than mina size. 2. Cf. the numerous outlines of dome-shaped weights among the 'Forms of Weights' illustrated by Petrie (1926: Pis. IV, V, VII). 3. The weight was acquired in Jericho by the Jerusalem advocate Gabbay, who kindly permitted the author to have it weighed at the Department for Weights and Measures, Jerusalem. Its whereabouts are unknown since Gabbay left Israel. 4. It must be noted, however, that the Josippon manu- scripts which have come down to us contain a copyist's error, reading 'and the uncia 60 mishkalim,' which is of course impossible and should be read 'and the riti (litra) 60 mishkalim.' As the uncia of the litra (Vi2 X 273 g = 22.75 g) contains five mishkalim (22.75 = 5 X 4.55 g), a correction of 'sixty mishkalim' to 'six mishkalim' cannot be justified. 5. Dudu lived about 2500-2400 BCE (Woolley 1950: 52; Reifler 1964: 32). The weight, now in the Ashmolean Museum, is a pear-shaped artifact, pierced at the top for suspension (see Thureau-Dangin 1921; Powell 1971: 198, 255). 6. Axial cavities were noted by Dunand on many stone artifacts which he did not weigh, but which may have been weights, and by Petrie (1886: 43); both failed to recognize them as a characteristic feature of scale weights. Petrie thought that the artifacts were hammerstones, conjecturing that 'the habit seems to have been to hold them between the thumb and the finger and not in the palm of the hand.' He noted however that 'very often old weights were thus used and many weights catalogued have thus been treated.' He did not return to this feature in his 1926 study and catalogue, though he again referred to weightstones having been used as hammerstones: 'a common fate of even the best of weights.' 7. Cf. the Mesopotamian mina of raised royal norm of 836/841 g (Hultsch 1898: 204; 1882: 400; Powell 1971). 8. In connection with the weighing of such quantities of the Eshtemo'a hoard, a talent of scrap silver (Eran 1990). 9. Activities actually continued into 1928 and informa- tion on a few finds must be added to the chapter on weights in the official report of 1929. 10. Having described and discussed his harvest of 238 weights on fifteen pages, Macalister (1912: 278-93) held it 'hardly worth the space ... needed to follow further the intricacies of these miracles of dishonesty' and concluded his effort with the remark: 'that this bewildering subject is exhausted here cannot be claimed.' 1 1 . The author wishes to record his thanks to the Director of the Institute of Archaeology, London, for facilitat- ing his study of these weights. 12. The few remaining pieces in the collections of the Institute of Archaeology, London, and the forgotten group in Jerusalem (now in the collections of the Israel 223</page><page sequence="231">Antiquities Authority) are included in this study. 13. Weights of similar shape and mass to W* 222 are known from Egypt, where they represented two deben (or 20 kite) of the (new) deben/kite standard first introduced under the 18th Dynasty (see e.g. Petrie 1926: Catalogue of Weights No. 3227: 181.39 g; No. 3232: 181.60 g; and 3237: 181.71 g, all of basalt). 14. The ellipsoidal stone weight illustrated by Duncan (1931: plate facing p. 219, bottom row, second from right), stated to have had a mass of 1810 g, cannot be identical with W* 230 as its original mass is uncertain. He reported it to have 'lost one inch diameter at one spot' (whatever that phrase means); and on p. 222 he states its 'loss' to have amounted to both 290 g and 190 g. 15. Cf. W* 228 (454.50 g), inscribed with the looped sign and the hieratic numeral 50. 16. The artifact (Israel Museum No. 57-703, R1670) was investigated in 1974 by the author with the kind permission of the curator Ruth Hestrin. It is a five- sided prism of soft limestone with an adjustment cavity at its base. In its present state, damaged at four of its corners, it weighs [81.28 g] and originally weighed ca. 95 g as established by plasticine com- plementation. The statement by Stern (1982: 216) as to its mass cannot be maintained. The weight represents 12 pym-deben of a late period, a deben of a size observed in Egypt from the 26th Dynasty onwards (Petrie 1926; Hemmy 1937: 39, Table 10; Porten 1968: 68). CATALOGUE* A.

Abbreviations: 1st: limestone; fl: flint; dsh: dome shape; fed: frustum of cone, inverted and domed; d: diameter; h: height; 1: length; w: width. Dimensions: in order to indicate the degree of sphericity of rotund artifacts, two diameters have been measured and recorded at right angles, e.g. W 45: d 63/53.5 mm; W 10: 46.4/46 mm; W 12: 68/68 mm. Original mass: for fragmentary or damaged weights the value of their extant mass in grams is placed in square brackets. Where the original mass of such weights has been either estimated or determined by plasticine complementa- tion and calculation based on the relevant specific gravity values, the resultant value of the original mass is qualified by the term 'ca.' Every unit value in the metrological equations for such weights is to be understood accordingly. During preparation of the stratigraphie reports, changes continue to be made in stratum designations for certain loci. Since this catalogue is organized and numbered by strata, it was impossible to take account of a number of changes made while the volume was in press. Note, however, the following revisions: W 37 (Stratum 12), W 39 (Stratum 0), W 135 (Stratum 147-12B), W 182 (Stratum 5), W 191 (Stratum 6).

Reddish 1st; fragment (more than half) of dsh weight; mass 53 g; h 31 mm (originally a little more), d 43 mm, d (base) ca. 37 mm. At one stage a half-moon area has been clumsily scraped or filed from the flat base to a thickness of 1-3 mm, reducing the mass of the artifact (or of the fragment). As Judean dome-shaped eight-shekel weights with com- parable dimensions are known (cf. Kletter 1990: Catalo- gue, Group 4), twelve with a diameter of 40 to 42 mm and one each of 43 mm and 44 mm, our fragment possibly comes from an eight-shekel weight. W 174. Area Dl; L. 422; Dl/7000.

[131.80 g] A Judean sixteen-shekel weight in the Paris Bible Museum has a comparable maximum diameter (Lemaire 1976: No. 18).

Hard gray 1st; fragment of dsh weight, the larger part of the artifact; h 34 mm, d 41.6 mm, d (base) 22.5 mm; mass (frag) [53.3 g]. Weights of eight shekels which have a diameter of 41-41.5 mm are known (Kletter 1990: Catalogue, Group 4). Probably this fragment too comes from a weight of such a size. W 196. Area El; Surf.; El/9013; Fig. 39:9. Hard 1st; frag- ment of irregular dsh weight; h 39.5 mm, d 41.5 mm; mass of fragment [72.70 g]. The fragment is a little more than half the original artifact, which was possibly meant to represent the shekel of the Sanctuary (136 g = 10 x 13.60 g) but was destroyed because the dome-shaped style was not to be used for a weight of this standard. W 197. Area El; Surf.; El/9854; Fig. 39:10. Lst; dsh with ellipsoidal section and irregular concave base; intact ex- cept for spot of very thin splitting off; h 14 mm, d 17.6/ 15.8 mm; mass ca. 5.80 g; possibly a mute bqa' weight. W 198. Area G; L. 714; G 2057; Fig. 39:11. Hard 1st; fragment, base part of dsh weight, only surface pecked; h 57.5 mm (originally a little more); d 68.7 mm, mass [201.50 g]. Macalister and Duncan recovered a 40-shekel weight with h 59 mm and d 71 mm (W* 228). Our frag- ment may have been intended to become a weight of that size (455 g = 40 x 11.375 g), but was found too small to give its mantle surface and its base the final grinding and polishing. W 199.

Reddish- brown 1st; fragment of dsh weight; on surface negligible damage; h 37.5 mm, d 38.7 mm; dimensions of fracture surface 32/34 mm; mass [58.46 g]. The interesting feature of this artifact is its kernel, a siliceous concretion exposed on the fracture face. The remnant of this concretion is of spheroidal shape and completely surrounded by limestone from the matrix in which it had developed. The blank must have been col- lected in awareness of its structure and have been carefully worked so as to retain its limestone cortex to a thickness of 2-2.5 mm all over its domed surface and 3-5 mm over the base. The original mass remains uncertain. As the diameter of the weight approximates those of two known eight-shekel weights (Kletter 1990: Catalogue, Group 4, Nos. 13-14), it appears possible that an eight-shekel weight was intended. However, calculating a sphere with the diameter of this artifact (in fact a volume substantially larger than the original dome-shaped artifact), one ob- tains a mass of 80-83 g, which would have been too small for a Judean eight-shekel weight, but suitable for a weight of ten shekels of 8.19 g to 8.36 g. In the circumstances we cannot say whether the weight was accidentally damaged or intentionally destroyed. W 202. Surface find, area and findspot unrecorded; Surf. 3001; Fig. 39:15.

[189.20 g]ca. 371 g = 4x92.75 g = 32 x 11.594 g So far no weight of 32 shekels (32 x 11.375 g = 364 g by the norm) is known. Possibly this mass step was undesir- able among the Judean equipment of dome-shaped weights, as such a mass represented the Phoenician shekel of 7.28 g ( = 750 x 364 g), different from the unit of 7.583 g sanctioned in Judea under the name 'pym.' Perhaps this was the motive for the destruction of this artifact. ANNEX: BLANKS FOR EARLY WEIGHTS Bk 1. Area and find spot unrecorded; Surf. 3006.

W* 233. 4 A block of hard limestone, in shape the frustum of a cone with slightly convex [mantle face]; dressed with the comb pick' (Macalister and Duncan 1926: 30, Fig. 23). Around the base rim a rabbet (width 12.7 mm, h 50.8 mm) has been cut, forming a socle to the conical body. Overall height 368.3 mm, h (cone) 317.5 mm, h (socle) 50.8 mm; d (top) 152.4 mm, d (max) 292.1 mm, d (base socle) 279.4 mm (Macalister and Duncan 1926: 30, Fig. 23). Cutting the rabbet permitted the mason to adjust the blank to the desired mass without spoiling the artifact' s shape (cf. the axial cavity on the talent weight W* 308 for the same purpose). The finished rabbet on the weight's base rim also enabled the weightmaster's assistant to get a sure grip on the heavy implement while lifting it on and off the balance pan. The measurements stated by the excavators do not de- fine the bulging body described and illustrated. The sec- tion of the artifact in Fig. 23 does not permit reliable calculation of the body's volume, as the drawing is not precisely to scale. Calculating the mass of a straight- walled cone together with the mass of the socle according to the stated dimensions, one obtains a minimum mass of 42.76 g. However, the artifact as found and described by the excavators must have been heavier, because of the slight bulging of the conical part. Conjecturing the mass of the 'bulge' as having been between one and two kilo- grams, the total mass of the lost artifact may have been between nearly 44 kg and about 45 kg. These limits com- prise the talent values of two Phoenician standards: 43,680 g = 60 minas of 728 g and 44,880 g = 60 minas of 748 g. For these values, see Hultsch 1882: 418, Table XXII; Hultsch 1898: 204, Index of Mass Norms; Haeberlin 1909: Tables 13 and 16; Lehmann-Haupt 1916: 611 ff., table under No. 4. II.

[56.63 g] ca. 94.38 g = 8 x 11.798 g The loss estimate by Scott, leading to a shekel value sub- stantially above the shekel norm, is possibly too high. * The listing of weights from Kenyon's excavations in Jerusalem is limited to weights from the period of the Judean Kingdom, recognizable by the criteria of mass, shape, material and context. They comprise the weights listed by Scott (1985) in Tables 2A and 2B under Nos. 1-66 and No. 89. They are listed here in order of the geographical position of the excavation area and by loci. The relevant data on each item are taken from the entries in Scott's tables, the accompanying notes and the discus- sion (Scott 1985: 197-212). The material, as determined by Scott, is limestone unless another material is indicated. Each item is identified by locus number and registration number.

Lst weight of boulder size, nicely crafted to an ellipsoidal shape and provided with a cavity at one end of its axis; originally mute but with some spurious lettering, apparently scratched by local inhabitants at the end of the 19th century, who had accidentally come across the arti- fact. While the true site of its discovery in Jerusalem is unknown, it became known as the 'Talent of St. Anna,' where it had been clandestinely reburied to be 'discovered' by one of the Fathers (Cré 1892). 41,900 g = (a) 60x698.34 g = 3600x1 1.639 g = 3000 x 13.967 g = (b) 50x838 g = 5000x8.38 g = (c) 80x523.75 g = 4000 x 10.475 g Testing the relation of its mass to a Judean standard (equation a) results in shekel values 2.3% over their norm values. Calculating the mass of the artifact as a multiple of either the Mesopotamian common or the Mesopotamian silver standard (equations b and c), the resultant unit va- lues concord surprisingly with other known local Iron Age weights.

Rosen Ben-Gurion University of the Negev INTRODUCTION The analysis of lithic implements and waste from complex societies can provide significant informa- tion on such diverse subjects as trade and economy, social organization, functional interpretations of sites and activity areas, chronologies, and perhaps even ethnicity. Although most of the work on the general subject of lithics in complex societies has come from the New World (e.g., Hester and Hammond 1976; Pires-Ferreira 1976; Winter and Pires-Ferreira 1976; Stone et al. 1983; and for Greece, e.g., Runnels 1985), in recent years the groundwork has been laid for the comprehensive analysis of lithic implements in the Levant during the early historical periods (e.g., McConaughy 1979; Schick 1978; Milstein 1981; Rosen 1982; 1983a; 1983b; 1983c; 1984a; 1984b). These studies, com- bined with earlier work, primarily by Neuville (1934-35; 1930) and Crowfoot (1935; 1937; 1948a; 1948b; Crowfoot Payne 1984), provide a sound data base for attempting to understand some of the above subjects from a lithic perspective. The collection from the City of David provides a good example of both the potentials and the problems of lithic analysis in the historical periods in Israel. On the one hand, the site was occupied repeatedly for long periods, thus providing a good chronological sequence for lithic types. On the other hand, this same settlement history causes significant problems in terms of intrusions and the interpreta- tion of finds recovered from fill horizons, from which the bulk of the material was recovered. * Submitted in 1986. These methodological problems require some further discussion, and may be organized under three general headings: 1) the nature of the site; 2) the nature of the artifacts; and 3) the nature of the archaeological interpretation and chronological attribution. First, the City of David was intensively occupied over the course of several millennia. As such, it was subject to repeated episodes of construction, repair and destruction, all of which tended to create significant problems in the chronological attribution of finds from fill layers. In connection with this, flint artifacts are small and behave like potsherds and coins in an archaeological stratum. They move easily and are subject to a wide variety of disturbances, both human and natural. Unless found in pristine condition, in a totally primary in situ context, one cannot rule out the possibility of intrusion. Failure to consider the likelihood of such intrusions can lead to the mistaken attribution of types, and consequent misinterpretations of assem- blages. These two factors together create major problems in the attribution of material to particular cultural or chronological horizons. Of further interest in connection with the features of the site itself is the apparent fact that virtually all intrusions seem to reflect upward movement of material. It is very common for older material to be found in younger levels, and much less common for younger material to infiltrate downwards. This is undoubt- edly a function of large-scale construction, which tends to bring up older material during the digging of foundations and other building activities. The same is generally true of ceramics as well. Secondly, the vast majority of flint artifacts are not culturally or chronologically diagnostic. With respect to industrial waste, apart from exceptional 257</page><page sequence="265">types of cores or the waste from specialized manufacture such as microburins, most flint debit- age can be dated and interpreted only by reference to the assemblage as a whole. Index fossils are virtually absent in waste assemblages. The picture is only slightly better for tools, especially in the later periods. The vast majority of tools from the historical periods are ad hoc and cannot be assigned a date without contextual information; there are few exceptions (e.g., Canaanean sickle segments). Even such well-known types as tabular scrapers span more than a millennium in their chronological range. Finally, archaeological recording tends to stress the dating of architectural horizons. The rule of thumb is that the youngest ceramics date the fill (e.g., Walker 1978). A fill layer in which 90% of the ceramics are dated to the Late Bronze Age and 10% to the Iron Age can be interpreted as having been laid down during the Iron Age, but having reused an earlier matrix. Unfortunately, attributing an Iron Age date to the lithics from such an horizon would clearly be inappropriate, and leaves the problem of how to date artifacts from such fill horizons. When data are available, assemblages (as opposed to individual artifacts) can often be dated roughly by reference to the predominant ceramic types present. However, such information is often not available. In such a situation one is left with the option of discarding all material from fills as unfit for analysis (thus eliminating the vast majority of artifacts), or noting the presence of fills and trying to take them into due consideration in the analysis. Similar problems occur in the analysis of bones and other non-intrinsically datable artifacts. In spite of this array of difficulties, when such assemblages are considered with reference to pre- vious research, it is possible to make good use of even the problematic collections. While the assem- blage from the City of David suffers from many difficulties with respect to intrusions, it is also one of the few well-collected assemblages from a historical mound site, with more than 6000 artifacts. Collection bias is minimal, and this alone makes the lithics from the City of David worthy of closer study. With regard to the stratigraphical analysis of the loci in which lithics were uncovered, stratum designations here are up-to-date as of March 1986. Loci from which lithics were examined for this report will be noted accordingly in the locus indices in the forthcoming final stratigraphical reports. DESCRIPTION Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age Loci For the purposes of description, the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age loci have been grouped together. There are no clean, unmixed Chalcolithic loci, and many of the Early Bronze Age loci show Chalcolithic intrusions. In Table 1 an attempt has been made to separate industries, based on strati- graphic considerations; the experiment was not successful in cúlling out intrusions. As is typical of the assemblages from these periods, the bulk of the tool assemblage is comprised of non-diagnostic ad hoc elements. These include borers, notches, denticulates, miscellaneous trimmed pieces, various scrapers, choppers and hammerstones. Excepting the choppers and ham- merstones, virtually all of these tools were manu- factured on flakes. Borers (Fig. 40:1-3) are pointed pieces whose working edge was manufactured either by notching to form a 'nose' between the notches, or by retouching a corner or natural point. Two (of 20) are better classified as drills. They show long thin bits, with abrupt retouch. Notches and denticulates (Figs. 40:5-7,13) show single or multiple concavities. In the case of notches, the concavities show internal retouch. Of the 39 pieces in this general class, 19 are notches and 20 are denticulates. Miscellaneous trimmed pieces consist of two pieces showing truncations, two microtools and 15 pieces showing retouch, but without diagnostic shapes or attributes. The 37 scrapers (excluding tabular scrapers) comprise the largest tool group from the assem- blage, accounting for 26.1% of the total tools. A general breakdown of types shows 13 steep scrapers (Fig. 40:16), two heavy scrapers, three denticulated scrapers (Fig. 40:9), one small scraper, and 18 flat scrapers (Fig. 40:17-18). As a general rule, work- manship is of poor quality, and type of retouch is not standardized. The three choppers are bifacially retouched wadi cobbles. The two hammerstones , perhaps better called pounding stones, are fist-sized, and show pecking over most of their surface. They are grouped separately from other tools in Table 1 due to essential contrasts in technology and raw material. 258</page><page sequence="266">Table 1. Lithic frequencies by period.

Although the three other tool classes, sickle segments, tabular scrapers and axes/adzes, comprise a much smaller proportion of the tool assemblage, they stand out because of their more standardized attributes and specialized production technologies. Of the 14 sickle segments recovered, seven were manufactured on Canaanean blades (Fig. 41:6-7) (Rosen 1983a). All of these were broken, but average width and thickness measurements are 21 mm and 5 mm respectively. Three plain sickle blades were recovered (Fig. 41:10), and four backed sickle blades (Fig. 41:8), typologically probably Chalcolithic (Rosen 1982), were also found. Six tabular scraper fragments were recovered (Figs. 40:19, 41:1-3) (Rosen 1983b). Of these, three are too fragmentary for measurements or attribute descriptions. One is broken but quite large, with a minimum length of 7 cm. One is irregular in shape, and measures 4.9 x 3.8 x 0.9 cm. The final one is oval in shape, measures 4.4 x 3.2 x 0.3 cm and shows minor incisions on the cortex (Fig. 41:3). The three fragments of groundstone axes are both too broken tó be adequately described. All seem to fall into the Chalcolithic axe group. One comes from a mixed Chalcolithic-Early Bronze Age locus, and it is likely that the other two, found in Early Bronze Age fill layers, are also intrusive. Debitage analysis shows a very high proportion of flakes as opposed to blades/bladelets (15:1), which is similar to that of flake tools to blade tools (12.4:1). Of the 49 blades recovered, only five are technolo- gically Canaanean. The remainder are crude, irregular blades, in some cases probably not intentionally manufactured as such. The presence of 11 bladelets may be of some interest, since bladelet industries are known in the Chalcolithic at 259</page><page sequence="267">Ghassul (Neuville 1934) and in the Early Bronze I at Arad (Schick 1978). However, it is impossible to determine whether these pieces are in fact intrusive from even earlier periods. Cores consisted of 37 irregular, nodular flake cores (Fig. 40:10), five small mixed blade/flake cores, two single platform non-Canaanean blade cores and ten bladelet cores. The latter could easily be Epipaleolithic intrusions. All come from fill loci. Middle Bronze II Loci The Middle Bronze II fills, and to a great extent the cleaner loci as well, show a high proportion of intrusions from earlier periods as evidenced by the presence of types such as Early Bronze Age Canaanean blades and sickles, Chalcolithic backed sickles, a Chalcolithic adze and chisel, and two tabular scrapers. This is not surprising and is true of the ceramic repertoire as well, but still presents difficulties in the interpretation of the assemblage. Most of the general types recovered from the Middle Bronze II loci are similar to those of the Early Bronze Age assemblage and require little further description. This is particularly true of the pieces classified as ad hoc tools, i.e., the notches and denticulates, the borers (Fig. 40:4), the scrapers and the miscellaneous trimmed pieces. All derived from relatively simple flake technology and show little sophistication in later stages of manufacture either. It is difficult to assess exactly what proportion of these tools is indeed Middle Bronze II in date. Scrapers include four steep scrapers, two small scrapers, two heavy duty scrapers, one denticulated scraper (Fig. 40:8) and 17 general end- and side- scrapers. This last general scraper category shows much variability. While the ten borers resemble those from the Early Bronze Age levels, in contrast to the Early Bronze Age assemblage, no drills were recovered from the Middle Bronze II assemblage. Miscellaneous trimmed pieces include one small nibbled flake, two truncations, one microtool (Fig. 40:14) and four retouched flakes. Varia consist of three retouched bladelets, none of which falls into any set category of tool. They cannot be attributed to a particular period. Aside from one truncated blade, the 14 retouched blades fall into a general class showing scraper or nibbling retouch on one or two working edges. None were manufactured on Canaanean blades. The 46 hammerstones (or pounding stones) recovered (Fig. 40:11) are similar to the two from the Early Bronze Age assemblage. They are generally fist-sized spheroids with pecking over their surface. In general, the much higher number of these objects in post-Early Bronze Age layers suggests a real difference between the Early Bronze Age assemblage and its successors. A chi-square test of the relative numbers of pounding stones found in Chalcolithic/Early Bronze Age loci versus post- Early Bronze Age loci, using proportion of excava- tion per period to compute expected numbers (Table 2), gives a chi-square statistic of 8.21, with p &lt; .005 (very significant), strongly supporting the contrast between the assemblages. By way of explanation, I suggest that these stones were perhaps some type of projectile weapon, and that the differences between the assemblages reflect basic contrasts in the nature of the settlements in the different periods. The presence of fair numbers of these pieces at other Early Bronze Age sites suggests that this difference may be specific to the City of David. The adze and chisel recovered from Middle Bronze II loci are unquestionably intrusive and should be assigned a Chalcolithic date. The two tabular scraper fragments are also undoubtedly intrusive and may be either Early Bronze Age or Chalcolithic in date. The sickle segment class illustrates the problem of intrusions well. Of the 26 sickle segments recovered, seven were manufactured on small backed blades with truncations. They averaged 3.4 x 1.2 x 0.6 cm in dimensions, and are clearly Chalcolithic in affinities (Rosen 1982). Another seven are Canaanean sickle segments (Fig. 41:5,9), manufactured on Canaanean blades and attributable to the Early Bronze Age (Rosen 1983a). Unfortunately, all of these were fragments and length measurements were impossible to take, although width and thickness averaged 1.8 and 0.5 cm, respectively. Of particular interest is the presence of backing on four of these segments. While backing (abrupt retouch on one edge of the piece, presumably to facilitate hafting) is not unknown on Canaanean blades (cf. Crowfoot 1948a), it is certainly not common (e.g., Rosen 1983a; 1983b; Schick 1978), and the high proportion of such pieces here is unusual. One of these can be explained as the subtriangular endpiece of the composite sickle, backed possibly to allow the final segment to fit into a curved haft (Fig. 41:5). One 260</page><page sequence="268">shows a point in conjunction with the back, suggesting possible reuse as a borer. Finally, it is suggested as a speculative hypothesis that the final two may be Canaanean blades (Fig. 41:9) initially manufactured in the Early Bronze Age, and later reworked in the Middle Bronze II to fit better the paradigm of how sickle segments were supposed to look. Notably ethnographically, such reuse is common, and the lithics from the Early Bronze Age layers would certainly be readily available to Middle Bronze II occupants of the site. Regardless, it is likely that the sickle/borer is indeed an example of such reuse. Of the remaining 13 sickle segments, 11 are the large geometric sickles (Fig. 41:14,19) typical of the Middle Bronze II through Iron Age (Rosen 1982), and two are truncated sickles manufactured on plain blades. All of these can best be attributed to the Middle Bronze II. The large geometric sickle segments reflect a basic technology totally removed from that of either the Chalcolithic or the Early Bronze Age assemblages. The segments are con- siderably bulkier and were manufactured on broad blades/flakes and flakes rather than blades. Average dimensions are 5.3 x 2.5 x 0.7 cm, contrasting significantly with those from earlier periods and matching the dimensions of Middle Bronze II sickles from other sites (Rosen 1982; 1983a; Gilead 1973). The pieces generally show abrupt or semi- abrupt backing and one or two truncations, and often show a serrated working edge. Sometimes the ventral face shows bulbar thinning, presumably to facilitate hafting. The two plain blade sickles both show single truncations and gloss on only one edge. One is fragmentary and measures 2.8 x 0.2 cm in width and thickness, respectively. The second measures 6.0 x 2.0 x 0.8 cm. Although I have assumed that both are Middle Bronze II on the basis of their general dimensions and raw material, they could also fit into the Early Bronze Age assemblage. The debitage counts show high proportions of flakes with low blade and bladelet components. Since there is no record in Israel of the use of bladelet tools in Middle Bronze Age assemblages, the few bladelets and truncated bladelet tools present are either intrusive or were produced unintentionally. This general observation is sup- ported by the abraded quality of the four bladelet cores recovered and their affinities to Epipaleolithic bladelet cores. Of the remaining cores, one was a non-Canaanean blade core and the others were nondescript flake cores (Fig. 41:4). Of the blades recovered, only one was technologically Canaanean, and it is undoubtedly intrusive (or re-used). Late Bronze, Iron Age and Persian/Hellenistic Loci Although these periods were distinguishable strati- graphically, they have been grouped together because of the continuity in tool types and the low numbers of pieces from most of the levels. The ad hoc tool types (e.g., Fig. 40:12) are similar to those of earlier periods and require no further description. The lithic frequencies are presented in Table 1. It is likely that a very high proportion of these tools is intrusive, since single-stratum sites, e.g., Deir el-Balah (Rosen and Goring-Morris forthcoming; Rosen 1983a) exhibit very low ad hoc tool percentages. Along with sickle segments, the 101 pounding stones dominate these later assemblages. They are similar in size and shape to those of the preceding periods. Again, they have been separated from the rest of the tool assemblage because of essential contrasts in technology and raw material. Of the 40 sickle segments recovered, 30 are large geometries (Fig. 41:12-13,15-18,20), typologically similar to those of the Middle Bronze Age but somewhat smaller, averaging 4.3 x 2.8 x 0.9 cm. These sickle segments were manufactured on broad blades/flakes and usually show backing and two truncations. Edge retouch varies from nibbling to more marked serration. Shapes are generally parallelogram and rectangular (cf. Rosen 1982). The decline in average length from 5.3 cm in the Middle Bronze II to 4.3 cm in the Late Bronze/Iron Age is seen in other assemblages as well (Rosen 1982). The nine intrusive sickle segments include two plain blade sickle segments (excluded here due to differences in technology), four Canaanean sickle segments (Fig. 41:11) and three Chalcolithic- type backed sickle segments. One piece was too frag- mentary for subtype classification. Varia included a small chip of obsidian found in a Persian fill and a small Pottery Neolithic arrowhead (Fig. 40:15). The obsidian cannot be dated, although its original source is undoubtedly Anato- lia. The arrowhead is a small pressure-flaked piece with a tang, similar to those recovered from Jericho VIII (Crowfoot 1937) and other sites. The axe 261</page><page sequence="269">recovered is typically Chalcolithic in its affinities. Debitage from these levels relates almost exclu- sively to flake manufacture. The proportion of blades and bladelets is very low despite the increase in the percentage of blade/flake tools (i.e., sickles); none of the flakes recovered can be related to the manufacture of sickle segments. The three blade and two bladelet cores recovered are undoubtedly intrusive, dating from the Neolithic/Chalcolithic and Epipaleolithic, respectively. DISCUSSION Despite the problems of intrusive materials, the City of David assemblage provides good supporting data for previously presented hypotheses concerning lithic analysis in the early historical periods in the Levant. In particular, these include models of trade and exchange in tabular scrapers and different types of sickles, and the analysis of the decline of lithic industries and their replacement by metallurgy. Studies of the changing functions of lithic assem- blages can also be related to this process. With respect to the exchange hypotheses, the Early Bronze Age assemblage is of particular interest. First, as has been noted for numerous other sites (Rosen 1983a; 1983c), there are no cores or debitage which relate to the manufacture of tabular scrapers. This suggests that these tools were manufactured off-site and imported. The medium to low percentage (4.5%) of these pieces in the tool assemblage closely matches that predicted by the fall-off trade model (Rosen 1983c), lending further support, albeit indirect, for the suggestion of the western Negev as a manufacturing center of these pieces and for the hypothesis that these tools represent a diffusion type of exchange. It may be further noted that the addition of the Chalcolithic/ Early Bronze Age assemblage does not change this picture. Obviously, problems of intrusions render the specific numbers somewhat unreliable; however, the closeness of the predicted percentage of tabular scrapers at the City of David to the actual percentage recovered seems unlikely to be a mere chance result. The low number of Canaanean sickle segments recovered from either Early Bronze Age contexts or Middle Bronze II fills is insufficient for the testing of hypotheses concerning the trade of these imple- ments. However, it is still useful to note that no Canaanean blade cores were recovered from the site, and that in this sense, the City of David resembles most other Early Bronze Age sites. The low number of unretouched Canaanean blades (i.e., blanks for sickle blade manufacture) also suggests that the pieces were produced off-site. In contrast to the tabular scraper and Canaanean blade industries, the ad hoc industry is well represented by a large industrial waste component, including both flakes suitable as blanks for these tools and cores, reflecting the actual manufacture of these tools on site. In particular, the large number of flake cores recovered from Early Bronze Age layers is to be emphasized, indicating that the manufacture of ad hoc tools in the Early Bronze Age was very common and contrasted with later periods. The later Middle Bronze II and Iron Age strata show similar, though more simplified, pictures. As with Canaanean sickles, there is no evidence of the manufacture of large geometric sickles on the site, and both cores appropriate to blade/flake manu- facture and blanks for the manufacture of these sickles are absent. This may be interpreted as the result of either the import of these pieces or their specialized manufacture in an area of the site not yet excavated (cf. Rosen 1986). With respect to the lithics, there is no other evidence for specialized trade or manufacture of other tools in the post- Early Bronze Age strata. Shifting the discussion to the function of the lithic assemblages, three trends can be isolated. First, while the Early Bronze Age shows a wide range of lithic types, and, in particular, a relatively low percentage of sickle segments, later periods show increasing restriction in the number of other tools and tool types and an increasing dominance of sickle segments in the assemblages. Secondly, there seems to be a quantitative decrease in the number of lithics recovered in the later strata. This is especially evident when a rough calibration is calculated to account for the differences in the amount of material excavated from the different strata (Table 2). Both of these trends are best explained as the result of the increasing availability and popularity of metal replacements (cf. Rosen 1984). Finally, the significant differences in the proportions of pound- ing stones, possibly interpretable as projectile weapons, suggests a marked difference between the Early Bronze and post-Early Bronze Age settlements. It is significant that despite the pro- blems of intrusions, the general trends are clear and unambiguous. 262</page><page sequence="270">Table 2.

The continued use of flint sickles, and their increasing domination of the lithic assemblages when other flint tools were being phased out of use, may be explained as a consequence of two factors. First, experiments on the relative efficiency of flint sickles when compared to bronze and iron sickles (Steensberg 1943) have shown that while iron sickles are more efficient than those of flint, there is virtually no difference in efficiency between sickles of bronze and flint. On its own, this suggests that flint sickles would not be replaced until iron was a common enough occurrence to be available to farmers, that is, certainly not until the late Iron Age. Secondly, given the abundance of easily obtained, high-quality flint in Israel, one may assume that even after the introduction of iron sickles, flint sickles continued to be used until the iron ones were roughly equally economical (in terms of cost as well as return). SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS In summary, several points should be stressed. To a great extent, the above discussion relies on hypoth- eses generated by previous studies. It is significant that the assemblage from the City of David essentially supports all of the 'economic' interpreta- tions suggested in earlier papers, despite the difficulties of intrusive materials. This can be attributed to the good collection techniques used on the site and the consequently reliable and relatively unbiased nature of the sample. While the lithic assemblage may not be particu- larly useful as a chronological indicator (though even here there are limited uses), it is clear that in the realms of trade and exchange, and for the analysis of function and technological change, lithic analysis provides vital information to archaeologists working in the historical periods.

Hence very many people find that a single gemstone alone is enough to provide them with a supreme and perfect aesthetic experience of the wonders of Nature.' This is a remarkably modern approach to the definition of gemstones and hints at several proble- matic aspects of the subject. Gemstones are indeed wonders of nature, pro- duced under unique and distinctive physical and chemical conditions typical of different regions of the world, so that certain gemstones are only found in certain areas. This was even more clearly delimited in ancient times, when primitive mining techniques limited the depth and extent of mining operations. By identifying the nature and internal features of a gemstone, in some cases the gemologist can even determine from which mine in a particular region the specimen was taken. Gemstones are no longer classified as 'precious' (rubies, sapphires and emeralds) or 'semiprecious' (all other gem materials from agates through andalusite to alexandrite, irrespective of rarity, beauty or market value). An alexandrite with good red/green color change can be far more valuable * Submitted in 1987. than the average emerald or ruby. Thus all gem materials are now defined as gemstones without an evaluative prefix. Gemstones have been used by mankind for decorative, medicinal, magical and artistic purposes at all stages of human history and in all cultures throughout the world. One reason is that, as Pliny put it, they are 'a supreme and perfect aesthetic experience' and satisfy man's desire for adornment. Another is the mystery surrounding their formation in the depths of the earth. There was a theory that gems grew and matured with time, their colors being indicative of varying stages of development. Their chemical properties were assumed to impart to gemstones a medicinal value when crushed or imbibed. It was even believed that gemstones were uniquely attuned to the vibrations of nature, and when worn as a talisman around the neck assisted in the wearer achieving a harmony with the music of the stars or the 'humors' of the human psyche. Thus particular gems were highly prized in certain regions of the world and in different eras, according to the social, religious and mystical beliefs and traditions of the tribes and peoples of the period. A knowledge of the gemological preferences of a place or period throws new light on the values and concepts of the people. ARCHAEOLOGY AND GEMOLOGY Although practically every archaeological excava- tion turns up some gem materials, whether in the form of seals, scarabs, jewelry or carvings, very few archaeologists work with gemologists in identifying these finds and interpreting their significance. In the early 1960s, Kathleen Kenyon gave her Jericho finds to John S. Harris, F.G.A., a gemol- ogist from Carlisle, who subsequently wrote two 268</page><page sequence="276">articles (1962-63, 1963-65); one described the gem materials excavated, while the other used this information to speculate on the possible identity of the twelve gemstones in the breastplate of the High Priest of Israel. To my knowledge, no other gemologists have been involved in archaeological research. A brief survey of the gemstone finds from the City of David excavations follows (the photographs were taken by Israel Haramaty). NATURE OF GEM TESTING Gem testing is non-destructive and based on the physical, chemical and optical properties of gem- stones, which are distinctive, characteristic and diagnostic (Anderson 1980). Destructive tests, such as scratching the surface for hardness or powdering the specimen for x-ray diffraction, are not used as a matter of course by the gemologist in the field, though they may certainly be useful in gemological research laboratories and in the development of procedures for the manufacture of synthetic gem- stones for lasers and electronics. It is usually possible to make a positive identification with the aid of gemological identification tables. When occasionally a very rare and unusual specimen is encountered, more sophisticated instruments, such as the electron microprobe, may be pressed into service - but this has not as yet proved necessary with archaeological specimens. GEMOLOGICAL INSTRUMENTS By using a polariscope to polarize the light passing through a gemstone it is possible to determine whether the stone is single or double refracting (Read 1983). A refractometer then measures the angle at which a beam of light passing through the gemstone is refracted by the internal crystal structure of the stone. As the refractive index (Ri) is characteristic for each gemstone, this is a very important test. Heavy liquids or hydrostatic weighing determines the specific gravity (S.G.) of the stone and a table equating the S.G. and R.I. defines the possible limits of identification. Some minerals also fluoresce under ultra-violet light, a further piece of information. A stereoscopic micro- scope with dark field illumination enables the gemologist to examine the internal structure and inclusions of the gemstone. The inclusions are typical of the species and variety and may be indicative of the location in which the material crystallized, as the environment impinges on the developing crystal and different elements are pre- sent in different regions. The surface structure of the gemstone can also be more clearly defined under magnification; very often surface cracks reveal internal features that can be diagnostically decisive. A gemologists' trick of the trade is the use of an unglazed porcelain tile to determine the color of the streak left by a gemstone drawn across the surface of the tile; lapis lazuli leaves a blue or gray streak, hematite a distinctive reddish-brown. All the information gleaned from these varied, non-destructive tests can usually lead to a definitive identification. GEMSTONES FROM THE CITY OF DAVID These gemstones were excavated in different loca- tions: in fills, floors, dumps, walls, pits and burials. They come from different periods: Iron Age I and II, Persian, Hellenistic, Roman and Islamic. They were used for different purposes, as seals, beads and pendants, and there were several small round stones of unidentified purpose, similar in size and color but without stringing hole or scratches from mounting. Of 82 specimens received for testing, 29 were not defined as gemstones. The remaining 53 gemstones appear in Table 1. There were five manufactured glass beads. Natural glass, such as obsidian, is regarded as a gem material although it does not crystallize and is therefore amorphous in structure. Though man-made glass is an ornament, it is not a gem material. Nine faience beads and scarabs are similarly defined. Two pieces of shell and three bone seals could be positively identified by zoologists or biologists, but only tentatively by gemologists. One specimen was a rock and not a gemstone, and another was heavily coated and could not be identified without further cleaning, which might have proved destructive. The remaining specimens were defined as gem- stones and identified as chalcedony (variety: carne- lian), tubular agate, sandstone agate, yellow chalcedony, gray-blue jasper, rock crystal quartz, brown aventurine quartz, calcite, orthoclase feld- spar, hematite, lapis lazuli, 'Eilat stone,' gypsum and sodalite. This assortment shows no particular pattern and most are common varieties found in many localities throughout the world. Lapis lazuli, 269</page><page sequence="277">Table 1.

GENERAL MINERALOGICA!. INFORMATION (Webster 1978) Crystals', mineralogists recognize six crystal systems (seven in England), namely cubic, tetragonal, hexagonal (trigonal in England), orthorhombic, monoclinic and triclinic, which are arranged in descending order of symmetry. Hardness : the Mohs scale of hardness is based on the principle that the substance with the higher hardness value will scratch the substance next in line below it. This is a comparative scale from ten to one, but the difference between 10 and 9 is greater than the difference between 9 and 1 . Specific Gravity (S.G.): the specific gravity of a substance is the ratio between its mass and the mass of an identical volume of water at 4° C. Refractive Index (R.I.): the refractive index of a mineral is the degree to which it bends or refracts a beam of light passing through it. Birefringence : when a mineral is double refract- ing, it splits the beam of light that enters and bends 271</page><page sequence="279">it at two different angles. The difference between these two angles is the birefringence of the mineral. Quartz (Si02; Photo 25) crystallizes in the trigonal system and has a hardness of 7, an S.G. of 2.65 and an R.I. of 1.548. The varieties include rock crystal, which is transparent; aventurine, which is green or brown with minute included platelets; and jasper, which is a massive variety of quartz. Quartz is the most common mineral on the earth's surface and is found world-wide, although well- formed crystals are less common. Chalcedony is a crypto-crystalline quartz, which means that its crystal structure is so minute that it cannot be seen even under magnification. It also has a hardness of 7 but its S.G. is slightly less (2.6), as is its R.I. (1.53). The varieties include carnelian (Photo 24), which is red, and agate, which has concentric banding and is found in many colors. Hematite (Fe203) (Photo 26) crystallizes in the trigonal system, has a distinctive brilliant metallic luster and leaves a reddish-brown streak when drawn across unglazed porcelain. Its hardness is 6 and its S.G. is high (5.1). The R.I. is very high and cannot be measured on a standard refractometer. Feldspar has a very complex chemical formula that is irrelevant for most gemological purposes. Crystallizing in the monoclinic system, it has a hardness of 6, an S.G. of 2.7 and an R.I. of 1.53. This is a fairly common mineral even in our minerally poor region and is found in many colors. Calcite (CaC03) crystallizes in the trigonal system with a hardness of 3, meaning that it is not very durable but can be worked easily even with primitive tools and fashioned into seals or statues. It has an S.G. of 2.71, an R.I. of 1.48 to 1.65 and a distinctive high birefringence of 0.17. This is another mineral that appears in many colors, including a beautiful pink, and is commonly found in this region. Lapis lazuli (Photo 26) is a complex silicate containing sulfur which is actually a rock compris- ing the minerals lazurite, sodalite and diopside, with specks of pyrite and streaks of calcite. It has a hardness of 5.5 and so was easily fashioned into the scarabs that were so popular in ancient Egypt. The S.G. is 2.8 for varieties that include pyrite, some- what less for others, and the R.I. is 1.5. Lapis lazuli was a highly prized gemstone throughout the ages and is thought to be the 'sapphire' of the ancient texts. DISTRIBUTIVE PATTERN No pattern in the use of particular gem materials in the City of David was discerned (Table 2). There were carnelians in Iron Age I and II, but also in Hellenistic and Persian period fills. The lapis lazuli was found in Iron II and Hellenistic contexts. The hematite comes from Iron II (including 10th century) contexts. If more gemological testing is carried out on a wide variety of archaeological material, a pattern may hopefully emerge. Table 2.

As more gemological information is collected, it should be possible to determine which gems were most highly prized in which period, for what purpose, and by which peoples. Because they are durable, gem materials do not undergo severe changes with time. Gemological testing can throw new light on these materials which were so admired and desired in ancient times, on their sources and distribution. BIBLIOGRAPHY Anderson, B.W. 1980.

These were made of various materials: gemstones, faience, glass, ivory, bone and stone. The definition of these objects as beads or pendants is based on the nomenclature proposed by Beck (Beck 1928: 11): beads are 'perforated along the axis' and pendants are 'perforated at one end.' The description and typology of the objects appearing opposite the figures uses the terms suggested by Beck in the same study. Gemological identification of the beads was carried out by Ann S wer sky (Chapter VII). Geological details were kindly provided by Naomi Porat of the Geological Institute of Jerusalem. This chapter deals with all the beads and pendants made of gemstones, faience and stone. The ivory and glass beads and bone pendants have already been published by Ariel (1990: 136-37, Fig. 17 for bone pendants and ivory beads; 157-59, Fig. 31 for glass beads). The figures depicting the beads and pendants (Figs. 42-44) are arranged by material, and within each material in typological order. The pendants are grouped together in Fig. 45 by the same system. This presentation makes it possible to trace the connection, if any, between the materials and the forms of the beads. It also emphasizes visually the differences in abundance of the various materials. A systematical theoretical study of bead assem- blages in archaeological contexts has not yet been carried out. It is therefore important to stress a number of considerations. Beads, by definition, are relatively small objects (the largest pendant in the City of David assemblage is less than 6 cm long). Such objects may be seriously affected by natural pressures on the ground in which they are buried, or even by human involvement in the stratification process, such as trampling on the surface, digging and building activities. In an experiment designed to examine the effects of such pressures, potsherds and coins were buried in pebble layers. It was found that potsherds in most cases remained in the place in which they were buried, while coins (also representing other small and valuable objects, like beads) tended to move considerable distances, even through the stone layers, which were not damaged during this process (Adkins and Perry 1989: 124-29). This difference may also be due to excavation methods, which are more efficient in the case of the largest pieces of pottery. Nevertheless, these findings demand the use of caution regarding the provenance and dating of small objects. Beads, considered valuable and sometimes made of gemstones, have great symbolic social signifi- cance. Objects of this kind can pass from generation to generation as heirlooms (Chin 1988: 60-61); thus the finding of a bead in a certain context may represent only the last stage of its use, and its manufacture and primary use may have been much earlier. The gemstones of which some beads were made were valued for long periods. Stones like lapis lazuli, chalcedony, agate, hematite and rock crystal were common from the predynastic period in Egypt until as late as the 19th century and even up to the present (Clark 1986: 65-66). This fact makes it impossible to distinguish between beads manufac- 276</page><page sequence="284">tured in different periods on the basis only of the material used. These factors, and the small number of beads found in the City of David, make any conclusion - whether chronological, typological or technological - disputable. The fact that less than 25% of the beads were found on floors or in other well-dated stratigraphie contexts should also be taken into account. Thus, the parallels presented opposite the figures serve merely to emphasize the wide spatial and chronological range which characterizes the simple form of the beads. MATERIALS Most of the beads and pendants found in the City of David were made of gemstones. These include: Chalcedony-carnelian (Figs. 42:1-3,5-9,11-17; 45:1). This is the most common material in the City of David assemblage (15 beads and one pendant). This stone was very popular in almost every period throughout the ancient Near East, due to its red- orange color, its hardness and the fact that it can be worked to obtain many forms (Clark 1986: 70-72). In Israel rare occurrences of carnelian have been reported from Lower Cretaceous basal conglomer- ate in the Negev (Machtesh Gadol and Machtesh Ramon); carnelian is common in Sinai and Egypt (N. Porat, personal communication). Carnelian beads were found as early as the 8th millennium BCE in sites like Khirokitia in Cyprus (Mellaart 1975: 131), in the royal cemetery of Ur (Woolley 1934: PI. 131), in sites from the prehistoric period in Egypt (Petrie 1920: 44; Andrews 1981: Pis. 20-22, 25) and later. The predominance of carnelian over other gemstones used in the manufacture of beads and pendants is attested in many contexts (e.g. Tufnell and Ward 1966: 194; McGovern 1980: 311 - Late Bronze Age pendants at Beth She'an). In the City of David assemblage carnelian appears in contexts dating from the Middle Bronze Age II up to the Persian period (see Table 1). Orthoclase feldspar (Fig. 43:1). This stone has been identified as the Biblical bareket and nophech (Harris 1963-65: 50). Both feldspar and quartz are found in crystalline rocks in Sinai (N. Porat, personal communication). Quartz (Figs. 42:4, 43:2-5). This widely distrib- uted mineral occurs in many varieties with different transparency and color (Hamilton et al. 1974: 128). Varieties represented in the City of David assem- blage are rock crystal, orbicular quartz and jasper. Its hardness makes it very durable and hence valuable. Quartz jewelry has been popular in many periods (Ogden 1982: 105). Lapis lazuli and sodalite (Figs. 43:6-8; 45:2). Much has been written about the rarity of this stone, found mainly in Afghanistan and probably imported from there to all the areas of the ancient Near East (Aldred 1971: 15; Ben-Tor 1989: 41). The high value of this stone, prized for its blue color, resulted in its use in jewelry from the predynastic period in Egypt (Petrie 1920: 44), the Early Bronze Age in Iran (Gwinnett and Gorelick 1981), and later on in Mesopotamia, Egypt and the Aegean. All these areas engaged in trade relations in order to acquire this stone (Clark 1986: 67-69). Lapis lazuli appears in the City of David in Middle Bronze Age II contexts and reappears in Iron Age II strata. Hematite (Fig. 45:3-5) is represented in the City of David by four pendants, two of which (from the same locus) are made of natural crystals of hematite, adopting its mamillated form (Hamilton et al. 1974: 42) as an aesthetic feature (Fig. 45:3-4). All the stratified hematite pendants are attributed to Iron Age II strata. The hematite probably origi- nated in Egypt (Petrie 1920: 43). Other materials not defined as gemstones which were used for beads and pendants are glass, faience and natural stones (limestone, sandstone and pebbles). Faience (Fig. 44:1-6): the use of this material goes back to the predynastic period in Egypt (Aldred 1971: 35) and perhaps even earlier, in fifth- millennium Mesopotamia (Stone and Thomas 1956: 40-44). Faience is an artificial material, made of ground quartz and usually glazed (Ogden 1982: 124-25). This material is easy to work and diverse forms can be obtained by molding and firing; some of them are represented in Fig. 44. Stone (Figs. 44:11-12; 45:6-9): this category includes one bead made of limestone, one stone (Fig. 44:12) whose identification as a bead is dubious (it could be a loomweight), one natural pebble perforated as a pendant and three large pendants made of sandstone, which occurs in Transjordan (N. Porat, personal communication). THE PRODUCTION PROCESS The process of producing beads from gemstones is relatively simple. The same method, consisting of 277</page><page sequence="285">four principal stages, was used from the Early Bronze Age in Iran (Gwinnett and Gorelick 1981), through the Middle and Late Kingdoms of Egypt (Aldred 1971: 116), and to this day, for example in the Cambay region in India (Possehl 1981: 42-46). All the gemstones found in the City of David, including those with the highest hardness value such as carnelian (6.5) and rock crystal (7), could have been worked with tools made of quartz, which is common enough to be an inexpensive tool material. Due to the lack of beads in different stages of manufacture or areas which could be recognized as working areas by production debris, raw materials or specialized tools, it is impossible to identify specific techniques or implements which were used during this process (see Mackay 1937). In fact, few such working areas have been identified archae- ologically in Israel, most of them unpublished (McGovern 1980: 311); but see Bikai (1978: 8) for a Late Bronze Age workshop of faience beads. The available data are small amounts of raw materials on the one hand, and the complete beads and pendants on the other. However, given the simplicity - almost universality - of the process, we can assume that its stages are more or less identical in all cases: 1 . Preliminary preparation of the raw material by chipping off small lumps of material, or roughly shaping the small pebbles. Most of the lumps of raw material in the City of David are pebbles 1-2 cm across, each of which could have been used for the making of one bead or perhaps two very small ones. Some of the pebbles are smooth and polished, probably due to water activity. It is interesting to note that a few of the pebbles are opaque, tinted with calcite veins or damaged. This might suggest that they were discarded as unsuitable for further preparation as beads. 2. Finer shaping of raw material: cutting off the sharp ends and leaving flat surfaces on the pebble. This was usually done by rubbing them against harder materials (Possehl 1981: 43). 3. Perforation of the bead: this is the most complex and delicate stage in the production process, demanding precision and a high level of skill (Stocks 1989: 530). For this reason, the perforation was often carried out when the bead was still only roughly shaped and before polishing (Gwinnett and Gorelick 1981: 21), saving much effort, time and material when a bead was damaged or broken during the process. Evidence of this can be found in Early Bronze Age sites in Iran (Gwinnett and Gorelick 1981: 21) and at the Harrapian site of Chanhu-Daro (Mackay 1937). One of the pebbles at the City of David (E3/7604) shows signs of incomplete perforation. Some of the complete beads show signs of cracking in the perforation area, which was smoothed before or after the perforation was made. This is probably due to the greater sensitivity of the bead in this area. The perforation was done by one of several methods: A. Using a sharp implement made of quartz (flint) or metal (Lucas and Harris 1962: 54-55; Gwinnett and Gorelick 1981: 21). B. Using a bow-shaft drill with a point of bronze (Stocks 1989: 527) or another hard material, such as diamond (Possehl 1981: 44-46). C. Employing abrasives such as quartz and emery powder, which are put on the surface of the bead to make drilling easier and more efficient (Gwinnett and Gorelick 1981: 19). Some of our carnelian beads (Fig. 42:5,7) appear to show evidence of the groove (bevel) used to concentrate the abrasives for drilling down the bead (Ogden 1982: 146^9). The perforating may have been done from both sides of the bead, using one of the methods described above (Lucas and Harris 1962: 53), or by drilling from one side to the center of the bead and then striking from above, causing a conical piece to break off the other side (Chevalier et al. 1981: 62). Both these methods create a biconical perforation, sometimes smoothed in order to straighten the sides but often left as it is (Beck 1928: Pl. IV). 4. Final shaping of the bead to give it a rounded finish and polish. This stage may have involved the use of a grooved sandstone on which the beads were held and moved back and forth (Gwinnett and Gorelick 1981: 23, Fig. 29). A stone which could have been used for this purpose may be G 4296 (Hovers, Chapter IV, Fig. 30:11). Another method of achieving polish is to place the beads in a large container and shake them with abrasives, first coarse and then fine (Possehl 1981: 46). This production process is suitable for beads made of gemstones. The forms which can be achieved are diverse, varying from spherical to barrel-shaped. The disc and cylinder beads were often made of long cylinders cut into smaller parts; this method was used mostly with faience disc beads (Beck 1928). 278</page><page sequence="286">Table 1.

No spatial distribution is given due to the paucity of finds and the fact that most of them were found out of context (see Introduction). The most substantial amounts of both beads and raw materials are found in the Iron Age II strata, especially Stratum 10. This conforms to the exposure of those strata in the excavated areas at the City of David. Data for the raw materials are given in Table 2. Considering the above, it is clear that any attempt to establish a coherent typological and chronological framework for the distribution of the raw materials is impractical; their quantity (only nine pieces) is insufficient and they are distributed over the various excavation areas and strata. The retrieval of raw materials was probably also selective, in that not every small fragment was registered. CONNECTION BETWEEN MATERIAL AND FORM The carnelian beads comprise 50% of the total finds in the City of David assemblage, and as such represent the only group which can be examined for a connection between material and typology. Carnelian is easy to work, can be readily obtained at a relatively short distance, and has a pleasing red- orange color. Its internal structure can be used to create ornamental patterns without further working (see Fig. 42:12,13,17). 279</page><page sequence="287">A certain degree of uniformity of form can be seen in the carnelian beads, although they belong to different strata. This fact is not surprising, con- sidering the extensive use of this material through- out many periods and the assumed similarity of the production process. The beads can be divided into several groups by type: rounded (especially the smallest beads), barrel- shaped, biconical, cylindrical and disc-shaped. Each of these forms can be paralleled in many sites and periods in the Near East. It is difficult to define chronological or spatial boundaries for their ap- pearance, especially when dealing with small and scattered samples. A connection appears to exist between the raw material and the size of beads. Most of the smallest beads, which tend to be round, are made of light orange-colored material, totally translucent without veins and dark spots. On the other hand, for the larger beads, which vary in form from biconical to long and short barrel-shaped, there seems to be less emphasis on the translucency of the material. The opacity and mottled character of the stone are used as ornamental motifs (Fig. 42:12,17). SUMMARY The wide range of chronological and spatial parallels offered for each of the types of beads and pendants exemplifies the problematic nature of these objects. The mere term 'assemblage' for the City of David finds is of course unjustified: the beads and pendants discussed come from every period and almost every area in the excavation. The main contribution of their presentation here is in the gemological identification of the raw materials used and their provenance. Emphasis on this kind of data, often neglected in publications of these objects, would add another aspect to the analysis of trade relations of specific sites in periods under discussion. The symbolic and social importance of beads and other such objects should be borne in mind when dealing with them in known and well-dated contexts (Hodder 1982; Clark 1986; Williams 1987). How- ever, no such analysis is justified here. BIBLIOGRAPHY Ariel, D.T. 1990.

Cahill One complete 'Horus Eye' amulet and fragments of two others were discovered in stratified contexts attributable to the Iron Age II during Shiloh's excavations in the City of David, Jerusalem. All three of these amulets are representations of right eyes fashioned from molded faience. Egyptian and Egyptian- type amulets1 of various materials and motifs are commonly found in archaeological excavations throughout the ancient Mediterranean world. Those popularly known as 'Horus Eye'2 amulets portray the wedjat-e ye, an Egyptian motif thought to represent a human eye embellished with the facial markings of a falcon (Gardiner 1957: 451, DIO; Petrie 1972: 9, 32).3 The term 'wedjat-e ye,' abbreviated is a compound term deriving from the ancient Egyptian verb wd3, ' ļļ , 'to be sound,' 'to be prosperous' or 'to be whole,' and an eye determinative (Gardiner 1957: 563; Faulkner 1976: 74^75). Thus the term literally means 'the sound eye,' 'the whole eye' or 'the prosperous eye' (Gardiner 1957: 563; Budge 1961: 141). Together, the literal definition of the term 'wedjat-e ye' and the interpretation of the eye motif as the compounding of a human eye with falcon markings have resulted in the identification of the eye motif as the eye of the falcon-god Horus, who was injured by the wicked god Seth and miraculously healed by the ibis-god Thoth (Gardi- ner 1957: 197, 563; Griffiths 1958: 183).4 The eye motif consists of six component parts (Fig. 46: 1-6)5: 1) the sclera6; 2) the iris7; 3) the eyebrow; 4) the eyeback; 5) the forefeathers; and 6) the hindfeathers. Amulet No. 7, Reg. No. G 17609 (Fig. 47; Photo 27), is a complete amulet made of nonporous, light gray faience coated with light blue-green to white glaze. Although chipped at several spots around the edges, the amulet is complete, measuring 31 x 24 x 9 mm, and is pierced latitudinally by a roughly circular shaft measuring approximately 3 mm in diameter. The back surface is smooth and featureless, but not flat. In order to create a central area wide enough to accommodate the pierced shaft, the top and bottom halves of the amulet's back slant outwards, forming a central bulge. The characteristic features of the eye motif appear in low relief on the front side only. The eye motif on this amulet displays an almond-shaped eye framed by narrow eyelids; a smooth, round iris; a high brow8 notched in herring-bone pattern; a multilined eyeback formed of four horizontal bands; forefeathers formed of three horizontal bands beneath the front sclera and three vertical bands beneath the iris; and hindfeathers ending in a tight curl adjacent to the eyeback. Amulet No. 1 was recovered from L. 1 136 in Area G, identified as a foundation trench dug for W. 765 in square E5. Locus 1136 and the construction of W. 765 have been ascribed to Stratum 10C, dated to the 7th century BCE. As a foundation trench, L. 1136 cut through previously accumulated deposits and contained material ranging in date from the 10th through the 7th centuries BCE. Seven stylistically similar faience amulets from four different sites have been published: one from Atlit (Johns 1933: PI. XVII:419); one from Lachish Fig. 46. Components of 'Horus Eye' motif. 291</page><page sequence="299">Fig. 47. 'Horus Eye' amulet No. 1 (G 17609). Photo 27. 'Horus Eye' amulet No. 1 (ZR). (Tufnell 1953: PL 35:37); four from Megiddo (Lamon and Shipton 1939: PL 75:17,20,25; Loud 1948: PL 206:60); and one from Tell es-Sa'idiyeh (Tubb 1988: 41, Fig. 17). Each of these amulets appears to originate from a datable archaeological context. The amulet from Atlit derives from Tomb LI 6, burial a-i, which was reportedly the only Atlit tomb found undisturbed by later burials. The use of this tomb has been dated ceramically and numis- matically to the Persian period, ca. 5th-4th centuries BCE (Johns 1933: 60; Stern 1982: 70-71).9 The Lachish amulet was recovered from Tomb 224, which Tufnell (1953: 215) dated ceramically to the 9th century BCE.10 Each of the four Megiddo amulets has been dated to the 10th-9th centuries BCE. The first (Lamon and Shipton 1939: Pl. 75:17) was found in square 01411 and attributed to Stratum IV, which Albright (1943: 2-3, n. 1) and Wright (1964: 235-36) redesignated Stratum IVA and dated to the 9th century BCE. The second (Lamon and Shipton 1939: Pl. 75:20) derives from L. 421 which, although not described specifically in the Megiddo report, is located in a residential area excavated in square 0 14 and ascribed to Stratum V, ca. 1 1th- 10th centuries BCE (Lamon and Shipton 1939: 150, Fig. 6). The third (Lamon and Shipton 1939: 32-33, Fig. 34, PL 75:25) was found in L. 1674, defined as a soil fill excavated beneath the southern stable complex which Albright (1943: 2-3, n. 1) and Wright (1964: 235-36) ascribed to Stratum IVA, ca. 9th century BCE. The fourth amulet from Megiddo derives from L. E 2081 in Area AA (Loud 1948: 4446, 162, Figs. 100-101, 388). This locus is identified as the courtyard of a building located west of the Stratum VA city gate (Shiloh 1979a: 149); the courtyard contained a large assemblage of cultic vessels dated to the 10th century BCE (Yadin 1977: 846). The amulet from Tell es-Sa'idiyeh was found in a destruction layer attributed to Stratum XII and dated by Tubb (1988: 41) to the latter part of the 12th century BCE. On the basis of the ceramic assemblage published together with the amulet, however, a date within the 10th century BCE seems preferable (cf. Cahill et al 1989: 38). The comparative material suggests that the stylistic type represented by amulet No. 1 from Area, G may have enjoyed a long period of popularity ranging in date from the 11th to the 5th/4th centuries BCE. Alternatively, however, the amulet found in the Persian period tomb at Atlit may be interpreted as an heirloom or an antiquity at the time of its deposit, in which case amulets of this stylistic type may best be defined as characteristic of the llth/9th centuries BCE. Amulet No. 2, Reg. No. El/16980 (Fig. 48; Photo 28), is a fragment from the upper portion of an eye amulet bearing stylistic features similar to those observed on amulet No. 1. This amulet is made of nonporous, light gray faience coated with pale blue- green to white glaze and is pierced latitudinally by a rounded shaft. The back surface of this fragment is smooth and featureless and, like amulet No. 1, bulges at the center in order to accommodate the pierced shaft. The characteristic features of the eye motif appear in low relief on the front side only. The amulet has an almond-shaped eye framed by a narrow lid, a smooth, round iris and a high, diagonally notched brow accentuated by a coat of blue-green glaze, darker in color than that covering the rest of the amulet. The eyeback, the forefeathers and the hindfeathers are all missing. Absent the 292</page><page sequence="300">Fig. 48. 'Horus Eye' amulet No. 2 (El/16980). Photo 28. 'Horus Eye' amulet No. 2 (ZR). three last-named features, this amulet may only be compared generally to other right eye amulets with almond-shaped eyes, round irises and high, notched brows. Amulets with these general characteristics are known from Beth She'an (James 1966: Fig. 113:14), Lachish (Tufnell 1958: PL 29:67-68) and Megiddo (Lamon 1935: PL 4:7; Loud 1948: Pl. 206:58), where they range in date from the 13th/ 12th to the 10th centuries BCE.12 Amulet No. 2 was found in L. 2063 in Area El, identified as a pit ascribed to Stratum 10. Pit L. 2063 cuts floor L. 2076 of Stratum 13 and contains cultural remains ranging in date from the 9th through the 6th centuries BCE.13 Amulet No. 3 , Reg. No. El/9983 (Fig. 49; Photo 29), is an almost complete amulet made of porous, light gray faience coated with pale blue-green to white glaze. The amulet is weathered, rough to the touch and chipped in two places, the first at the front end of the eyebrow and the second under the base of the eye, resulting in the loss of the motifs forefeathers. The amulet's outline follows the characteristic contours of the wedjat-Q ye motif: a high, slightly curved brow; a V-shaped depression separating the front end of the eyebrow from the front corner of the eye, at which point the central shaft is pierced; a patch of unglazed faience under the iris marking the original position of the missing forefeathers; rounded hiiidfeathers; and a sloped left edge. The back surface of the amulet is smooth and feature- less, bulging slightly at the center in order to accommodate the pierced shaft. Unlike the two previously described amulets, the features of the eye motif on this amulet do not appear in low relief. Rather, except for a narrow depression delineating the bottom of the brow, the surface of the amulet is smooth and flat. The only accentuated features of the eye motif are the eyebrow and the iris, both of which are marked with black glaze. The amulet measures 22 x 16 x 10 mm and is pierced latitudinally by an irregularly shaped shaft measur- ing roughly 2.5 mm in diameter. Fig. 49. 'Horus Eye' amulet No. 3 (El/9983). Photo 29. 'Horus Eye' amulet No. 3 (IS). Amulet No. 3 was recovered from L. 131 1 in Area El, identified as the lower floor of the 'Ashlar House.' This locus is sealed by floor L. 1281 which is ascribed to Stratum 10, representing the final phase of the Iron Age II. Floor L. 1311 is ascribed to Stratum 11, of the 7th century BCE.14 Thirteen stylistically similar amulets from at least six different sites have been published: two from Beth Shemesh (Mackenzie 1912-1913: PL 43:16-17); one each from Lachish (Tufnell 1953: Pl. 35:43), Gezer (Macalister 1912: Vol. 3, Pl. 210:31) and Sheikh Zuweid (Petrie 1937: PL 30:62); six from Tell Jemmeh (Petrie 1928: Pl. 45:30,48,49,54-56); one from Tel Michal (Giveon 1989: 342-44, Fig. 29.1:9, Pl. 75:9); and one from an unknown provenience (Rowe 1936: PL 31:A58). From this group of 13 amulets, only those from Beth Shemesh, Tel Michal and possibly two from Tell Jemmeh derive from datable archaeological contexts.15 The two amulets from Beth Shemesh were found together in Tomb 5, which can be dated ceramically to the late Iron Age 293</page><page sequence="301">II (Mackenzie 1912-1913: 76-77, Pis. 41-42). That from Tel Michal is ascribed to Locus 1858, identified as a jar burial dated generally to the Persian period, ca. 6th-4th centuries BCE (Davies et al. 1989: 155, 163; Herzog et al. 1989: 8). Two of the six amulets that Petrie (1928: PI. 45:54-55) found at Tell Jemmeh may cautiously be associated with chronologically indicative ceramic assemblages16 that suggest dates ranging from the late Iron Age II through the Persian period.17 Thus, amulet No. 3 appears to belong to a stylistic group of amulets characteristic of the late Iron Age II and the Persian period, ca. 7th/4th centuries BCE. USE OF THE EYE AMULETS Each of the three 'Horus Eye' amulets from the City of David is pierced latitudinally through the central area of the amulet, directly behind the iris and the eyeback. Whenever described fully, 'Horus Eye' amulets from other archaeological sites are always said to be similarly pierced. As neither the three City of David amulets nor their parallels are small enough to be worn comfortably as rings, they are best understood as pendants pierced for suspension. The interpretation of 'Horus Eye' amulets as pendants appears to be corroborated by the frequent discovery of eye amulets together with other beads and pendants.18 The identification of these objects as amulets is supported by the religious significance attached to the symbol of the wedjat-Qye in Egyptian mythol- ogy. The religious concept of the eye apparently originated as that of the eye of solar Horus (Griffiths 1958: 190-91). 19 As such, this eye was analogous to the uraeus serpent worn on the king's forehead as a symbolic representation of his divine majesty and descent from the sun god (Ions 1982: 25, 36). When Re became the king of heaven, the Eye of Re came into existence as the manifestation of his divine authority. When Horus the son of Isis and Osiris became the king of heaven, the divine tribunal awarded the eye to him (Ions 1982: 64). The eye, therefore, served as the symbol of kingship worn, in turn, by each supreme ruler. As the manifestation of divine kingship passed down from ruler to ruler, the eye came to be associated with several different divine figures: Horus the Elder, Re and Horus the Younger, each of whom reigned as supreme authority over the Egyptian pantheon at some point in Egyptian religious history.20 According to Papyrus Leiden (1348 rt.7.3) the eye of Re protected a patient from a demon qualified as dw.hr , 'bad of face,' an epithet which Borghouts (1973: 143) interprets as 'evil glance.' The ancients' belief in the power of eye amulets is inferred both by Schrire (1966: 6), who asserts unequivocally that the Egyptians 'had a very strong belief in the Evil Eye,' and Budge (1961: 361), who maintains that the Egyptians 'set the influence of the eye of the sun- god against that of the Evil Eye.' Budge identified the numerous eye amulets as the eye of the sun and the eye of the moon and opined that no evil person or power could resist the power of the two eyes of Horus, the one ruling the day and the other the night (Budge 1961: 36 1).21 Corroboration for the belief that the eye amulets served a protective function may be found in the Egyptian words udjau , an expression which, phonetically, is very close to wedjat-Q ye and which means 'the thing that keeps safe' or 'the strengthener' (Budge 1961: 133); and to wd3w , ' iWfu , which Faulkner (1976: 75) translates as 'amulets.' Belief in the evil eye was, and still is, prevalent throughout the Near East and belief in the efficacy of the Egyptian eye amulets against the evil eye may account for the universality of the eye amulets which are found throughout the ancient Mediterra- nean world.22 DISTRIBUTION AND ORIGIN OF THE EYE AMULETS Although 'Horus Eye' amulets appear at sites located throughout the Land of Israel, they are prevalent at sites situated along the Mediterranean coast. Small and easily transported, the amulets may have been imported from Egypt or elsewhere (Phoenicia?), since no production center for them has yet been located in the Land of Israel. None- theless, the possibility that they were manufactured locally should not be dismissed. The vast majority of eye amulets attributable to the Iron Age and the Persian period are fashioned from molded faience. Sagona (1980) has shown that the technique of faience production was known in Egypt from at least as early as the Middle Kingdom and that knowledge of this technique appears to have spread to the Land of Israel during the Middle Bronze Age II. The materials required for producing faience were all readily available along the Palestinian coast: sand, lime, plant ash or natron and a furnace 294</page><page sequence="302">capable of reaching a temperature of 700° C (McGovern 1980: 309). All that was needed to fashion these amulets locally was the know-how to mix the materials in the correct proportions, to form a paste by hand, to press the paste into a mold and to fire it. Therefore, although the motif is Egyptian in character, there is no technical reason to assume that all (or any) of the Iron Age or later 'Horus Eye' amulets were imported.

The amuletic character of these objects stems from their embodiment of a religious symbol, the wedjat - eye. Although the amulets themselves may often have been worn as mere ornaments, the amuletic origin of the represented symbol is not in doubt (Schrire 1966: 5). 2. Although commonly referred to as the 'Eye of Horus' (Petrie 1972: 9, 32-34; Gardiner 1957: 197, 451, 563; Faulkner 1976: 75; Andrews 1984: 36-37), the eye represented on these amulets has also been identified as the 'Eye of Atum' (Ions 1982: 25, 26), the 'Eye of Re' (Faulkner 1976: 75; Ions 1982: 60) and the 'Eye of Osiris' (Gray 1971: 125). 3. For additional suggestions concerning the component parts of the wedjat-e ye, see te Velde (1967: 50), who suggests that the markings below the eye indicate an eye overflowing with moisture or light; Andrews (1984: 36), who suggests that it is a falcon's eye; and Murray (1953: 379), who notes that it is an emblem of Horus in both his human and falcon form. 4. Gardiner (1957: 197) supports this identification by stating that the eye of the falcon god Horus is often depicted on ancient monuments in this form, i.e. ^ . For a complete history of this interpretation with bibliography, see Griffiths (1958), who argues for the identification of the wedjat-e ye with the uninjured eye of Horus. 5. Gardiner (1957: 197) states that by virtue of the myth, according to which the eye of the falcon-god Horus was torn into fragments by the wicked god Seth, the eye symbol came to serve as the Egyptian 'grain measure.' In accordance with this myth, each of the component parts of the eye symbol was assigned a numerical value: the left sclera, &lt; , stood for l/2 ; the iris, O , stood for 7*; the eyebrow, , stood for Vs ; the right sclera, ]&gt;, stood for l/i6; the hindfeathers, , stood for 732 ; and the forefeathers, , stood for 764. Together, these fractions add up to 63 /64. The missing 764 was presumably supplied magically by the ibis-god Thoth, who miraculously healed the eye of Horus by joining the various parts and filling or completing ( ) the missing part. 6. 'Sclera' refers to the whites of the eye. 7. 'Iris' refers to the round, pigmented membrane surrounding the pupil. 8. 'High brow' refers to the fact that there is a gap between the top of the eyelid and the bottom of the eyebrow. 9. This date is based on the discovery in the tomb of two large jars with pointed bases (Johns 1933: 60, Fig. 16; Stern 1982: 108-109, Type H6), an Attic lekythos (Johns 1933: PI. VIII:4) dated to the 5th century BCE (Stern 1982: 7) and a silver coin (Johns 1933: 60, CI 184) of 'Philisto- Arabian' type, which Stern (1982: 71) dates to the late 5th-early 4th century BCE. 10. Tufnell (1953: 215) described the ceramic assemblage from this tomb as characterized by open bowls which are slipped on the interior and over half of the exterior, and wheel burnished. 1 1 . Square 014 is located in an area north of Building 338, in an area designated as private dwellings (Shiloh 1979b: 53, Fig. 73). 12. Although James (1966: 47, Fig. 75) only cursorily discusses the context in which the Beth She'an amulet was found, it apparently derives from a floor, L. 1538, ascribed to Upper Level V, dated to the 10th century BCE. The two amulets from Lachish (Tufnell 1958: PI. 29:67-68) derived from Tomb 570 (Tufnell 1958: 248- 50), which was cut into the side of the Middle Bronze Age fosse and dated by the excavators to the late XlXth or early XXth Dynasties, ca. 1225-1175 BCE. Dothan (1982: 276-79), however, advocates a date late in the 12th century BCE for the contents of this tomb. One amulet from Megiddo (Lamon 1935: PI. 4:7) was recovered from L. 1010, the 'guard's post' in the spring cave connected to the subterranean water system, the latest ceramic remains from which were sherds dated to the 12th century BCE (Lamon 1935: 8-10, 36; Yadin 1977: 855). The other Megiddo amulet (Loud 1948: PI. 206:58) was found in L. 2103, defined as a room in a residential area just east of Building 2081, which housed a 'cultic corner' (Loud 1948: 44- 45, Fig. 388; Shiloh 1979a: 149) in which two other eye amulets were found (Loud 1948: PI. 206:59-60). The contents of L. 2103 are apparently contemporary with 295</page><page sequence="303">those found in L. 2081 and are, therefore, ascribable to Stratum VA, dated to the 10th century BCE (Shiloh 1979a: 149). 13. The stratigraphical data pertaining to this amulet were kindly provided by Alon De Groot, who supervised the excavations in Area El. 14. The stratigraphical information about this amulet was also provided by Alon De Groot. 15. The provenience of the Lachish amulet is described only as Area 6000 (Tufnell 1953: 246, PI. 129), which presumably refers to the cemetery located in the northeastern corner of the mound (Tufnell 1953: 246). The amulet from Gezer derives from a unspecified context (Macalister 1912: Vol. 3, PL 210:31). Those from Petrie's excavations at Sheikh Zuweid have been ascribed to Level H, dated by Petrie (1937: 7) to ca. 824-630 BCE. Neither of these two amulets can be associated with any accompanying objects useful for corroborating Petrie's date. 16. Petrie's method of assigning stratigraphical designa- tions based on absolute levels obviates their chron- ological significance. Occasionally, however, small groups of pottery and artifacts that were found in close proximity to one another may be isolated and, in cases where they appear to be homogeneous, tentative dates may be assigned to the resulting assemblages. The ceramic assemblages that can be associated with each of these amulets are as follows: that associated with the amulet appearing in Petrie 1928: PI. 45:54 includes the following vessels: Pl. 48:8n; Pl. 53:35v; PI. 55:46n; Pl. 56:47h; Pl. 57:56t,57u; PI. 59:77h; and PI. 60:84s; that associated with the amulet appearing in Petrie 1928: PI. 45:55 includes the following vessels: PI. 48:3d, 3n, 3s; PI. 49:14t; PL 50:22p; PL 56:47u; PL 57:57n; PL 59:78c; PL 60:87d; PL 61:91x,98m,98n. Petrie ascribed both amulets to Stratum A, B, which he dated ca. 660-457 BCE (Petrie 1928: 4). 17. Stern's (1982: 22-25) revision of Petrie's stratigraphi- cal conclusions postulates the presence of three stratigraphical phases at Tell Jemmeh dating from the Persian period: Building A, ca. late 6th century BCE; Building B, no earlier than the 5th century BCE; and the granaries, ca. 5th-4th centuries BCE. 18. The following amulets discussed herein as parallels to those from the City of David were found together with pendants, beads or other types of jewelry: that from Megiddo published by Loud (1948: PL 206:58) was found together with a bone pendant (Loud 1948: PL 218:130) and a pierced Ptah-Sokar amulet (Loud 1948: PL 206:55); that from Atlit published by Johns (1933: Pl. XVIL419) was found together with two silver pendants, electrum earrings, a bronze ring and beads of various materials (Johns 1933: 60-62, PL XVII); that from Megiddo published by Lamon and Shipton (1939: PL 75:25) was found together with a number of pierced Egyptian amulets and various types of beads (Lamon and Shipton 1939: 146-47); that from Megiddo published by Lamon and Shipton (1939: PL 75:17) was found together with a glass bead (Lamon and Shipton 1939: 141, PL 92:56); and that from Tel Michal published by Giveon (1989: 342-43) was found together with two hair rings and a serpentine bead (Davies et al. 1989: 155). 19. In Griffiths' opinion, the term 'wedjat-e ye' initially appeared in a Horian context in the Pyramid Texts, where it is used several times as an epithet for an eye of Horus: The King has come to thee, O Horus of the East; Lo, the King has brought to thee thy great left eye as a healer; Take it to thee from the King. It being sound. (Griffiths 1958: 183, n. 3 quoting Pyr. 450c-451c). Griffiths also points out that although the Pyramid Texts often refer to the eye that was seized by Seth, it is not specifically referred to as the wedjat-eyQ (Griffiths 1958: 183). Griffiths, therefore, concludes that it was the other, uninjured eye, or the eye that remained sound, that came to be called the wedjat-e ye (Griffiths 1958: 182-83). 20. Hence the apparent confusion in nomenclature noted above in n. 2. 21. Petrie (1972: 32) similarly notes that the wedjat-Q ye was properly a pair of eyes representing the two eyes of the solar Horus, which were compared to the sun and the moon. This identification of the sun and the moon with the two eyes of the solar Horus is based on an early Memphite hymn which actually identifies the two eyes with the evening and morning boats of the sun: He who acted against thy father in his weakness, he is against thee, O eye of Horus, and thou art against him, O eye of Horus. Thy right eye is the evening boat, Thy left eye is the morning boat, Thy two eyes, O Horus, which have come forth from Atum, they are Shu and Tefnut. (Griffiths 1958: 187). Griffiths points out that as there is nothing in the Pyramid Texts to suggest a different interpretation for the two eyes, their significance must be solar. Moreover, if the eyes were thought of as the sun and the moon, then this thought may suggest the notion of divine omniscience, at least in its elementary form as the power to see everything. 22. 'Horus Eye' amulets appear to have made their first appearance outside Egypt during the New Kingdom, when they were introduced to lands located within the Egyptian sphere of influence. By the Late Period, they were widely distributed throughout the Mediterranean world. 296</page><page sequence="304">BIBLIOGRAPHY Albright, W.F. 1943.

Remains of birds were also recovered from Areas G, El, E2 and E3, but these remains are still being analyzed. METHODS During excavation all material from floors was sieved, while that from other deposits such as fills and dumps was hand collected. The bird species were identified with reference to the modern comparative zoology collections held at the Depart- ment of Evolution, Systematics and Ecology of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. All bone elements were counted to give the number of identified bones for each species (NISP counts). The minimum number of individuals per species (MNI counts) was calculated for each area separately by stratum, using the most frequently represented bone, with side and age taken into account (Table 2). THE REMAINS Examination of the NISP counts for birds by area (Table 1; Appendix) shows that the largest number of bird bones was recovered from a single locus, L. 1 in Area Al, which was an Early Roman pottery dump. The concentration of bird bones (as well as other vertebrate bones; see Chapter XI) found in this deposit is probably related to the fact that it represents a refuse dump. Five avian species are represented in the City of David assemblage (Table 1). Domestic species identified included chicken {Gallus gallus ), goose ( Anser anser) and duck {Anas platyrhynchos). The chukar partridge {Alectoris chukar) was the only wild species represented in this collection. Bones of a pigeon {Columba livia ) were also found, but it is uncertain whether these represent remains of the wild rock pigeon or of a domestic pigeon. Even if the pigeon remains are excluded, domestic species are more prevalent in all periods (Table 1). The presence of four pigeon bones {Columba livia) recovered in Area D2 from the Hellenistic fill of a columbarium (L. 2336) is of special interest. The Latin name Columba livia refers to the domestic pigeon bred for consumption as well as to its ancestor, the wild rock pigeon, also known as rock dove or feral pigeon (Paz 1987). Columbaria are common in archaeological sites in this region from the Hellenistic period onwards. Their particular architectural style (numerous closely placed niches within variously shaped structures, often subterra- nean) resembles structures described in Roman and Jewish sources as used for pigeon raising. This, together with the fact that similar structures are used today in Egypt for pigeon raising, has led to their general acceptance as installations for pigeon breeding (Tepper 1986; Kloner 1993; Zissu 1995). Moreover, Talmudic sources describe pigeon breed- ing as being widespread in this region. Pigeons were raised for ritual purposes, for consumption and as a source of fertilizer (Tepper 1986). The presence of pigeon bones in columbaria at Maresha, Masada (Tchernov and Horwitz, unpubl. data) and now at the City of David provides the first archaeozoological evidence for the use of these structures for pigeon raising. Talmudic sources hint at the existence of a special breed of pigeon that was raised in the columbaria (Tepper 1986). However, 298</page><page sequence="306">Table 1.

It was therefore not possible to determine the extent of differences in the size or shape of the archaeological sample as compared to modern Columba livia. For all bird species represented at the City of David, there were few cranial or foot bones. Fig. 50 illustrates the pattern for three dominant species in the assemblage: chicken, goose and partridge. There are several possible ways to interpret this pattern (Horwitz 1990; Horwitz and Tchernov 1989). Firstly, these bone elements are poor in meat and so usually discarded during butchery; this raises the possibility that the bulk of the bird bones recovered at the City of David represents consumption debris rather than butchery offal. Secondly, the small sample sizes and selective sieving may have biased the recovery of these bones. A third factor to consider is the likelihood of differential preserva- tion, with the more fragile bones such as those of the skull being poorly preserved. Fig. 50.

The Ophel is situated in the southern part of the Temple Mount and forms the northern extension of the City of David. In order to obtain a broader picture of patterns of bird exploitation in Iron Age II and Early Roman Jerusalem, the avian samples from the two sites were combined (Fig. 51). Fig. 51. Comparison of bird remains from the City of David and the Ophel. In the Early Roman sample a narrow range of bird species, all domesticates, were recovered: chicken {Gallus gaiļus), goose ( Anser anser) and duck (Anas platyrhynchos). However, in the Iron Age II strata a much broader range of species was found, including duck, partridge, dove and passer- iformes in addition to chicken, goose and pigeon. Compared to some of the other Roman-Byzan- tine sites in this region, such as Kh. Sumaqa (Horwitz et al 1990), H. Rimmon (Horwitz 1990), Pella (McNicoll et al 1982: 1 10-1 1) and Tell Hesban (Weiler 1981; LaBianca 1990), the two Jerusalem sites (especially the City of David) contain a high frequency of geese. This may reflect intersite variation in dietary preferences, or it may be related to local conditions that made it more profitable to keep or market this species. There appears to have been an overall increase in the frequency of domestic birds consumed in the Early Roman period at the two sites relative to the Iron Age II. Although in the latter period there is as high a frequency of avian remains as in the Roman period, most of these are of wild partridge and pigeon, in contrast to the domestic poultry and geese characterizing the Early Roman period. A similarly high frequency of domestic birds, espe- cially fowl, has been reported from several other Roman-Byzantine sites in the southern Levant: Kh. Sumaqa, H. Rimmon, Pella, Tell Hesban (references as above), Tel Ira (Dayan in press) and el-Lejjun (Toplyn 1990). It is possible that the predominance of domestic birds reflects the importance of eggs in the Roman-Byzantine diet (Broshi 1989). It is also possible that the increased consumption of these domestic birds may be related to a concomitant decrease in the consumption of meat from ungulates such as sheep, goats and cattle (Broshi 1986). This may reflect a change in animal husbandry in the region, or even a reduction in the overall standard of living in the Roman-Byzantine period. BIBLIOGRAPHY Broshi, M. 1986.

Faunai remains recovered from sites with long diachronic sequences offer valuable opportunities for examining these issues in one settlement over time. With changes in the function, size and population structure of a site, concomitant changes in the manner in which people obtained and exploited animals and their derivatives are to be expected. An excellent example of such a site is the City of David. Archaeological excavations at the site testify to a lengthy chronological sequence spanning the Chal- colithic period (Stratum 21: second half of 4th millennium BCE) up to and including the medieval period (Stratum 1: 14th-20th centuries CE). Animal remains have been recovered from even the earliest, Chalcolithic layers at the site, while the Byzantine strata have yielded the most recent faunai sample. Eight excavation seasons were carried out at this site during 1978-1985 under the direction of the late Prof. Yigal Shiloh. Of the 1 1 areas excavated (Fig. 52), animal remains were recovered from nine, the exceptions being Areas A2 and J. Descriptions of the areas and their stratigraphie and architectural contexts are to be found in Shiloh (1984; 1990) and De Groot and Michaeli (1992). This report presents the findings of the faunai analysis for six excavated areas: Al, B, DI, D2, H and K; the faunai remains from the remaining Areas E and G will be presented in separate reports. Because of the complex nature of the chronology of the site as well as the high degree of spatial variation between areas, the faunai remains from each excavation area are discussed here separately by period, followed by a brief discussion of the salient diachronic trends observed for the site as a whole on the basis of the data presented here. A detailed discussion of the faunai remains from the site as a whole and their relationship to other, contempora- neous sites in the region will appear in the subsequent publication dealing with the remaining two areas. METHODOLOGY During excavations at the City of David, bones were hand collected and only selected loci such as floors or the contents of installations were sieved. This resulted in the loss of the bones of most of the smaller animal species as well as the smaller bones of the larger fauna, thereby biasing species and bodypart representation (Payne 1975; Clason and Prummel 1977). However, as this practice was consistent throughout all excavation seasons and areas at the site, it is assumed to have had an equal effect on the sample as a whole, although it limits intersite comparisons. The chronological and spatial complexity of a site such as the City of David (the excavated areas cover some 16 dunams; Shiloh 1984) poses problems for the archaeozoological analysis. Firstly, the fact that the site was destroyed and subsequently rebuilt and/ or remodeled over much of its history means that much of the material recovered is from fills rather than in situ floor deposits. Secondly, as the site lies on a fairly steep hill, it is probable that some of the bones have undergone some degree of pre- and/or postdepositional movement resulting in a high degree of fragmentation and possibly dispersal from 302</page><page sequence="310">Fig. 52. Sketch map showing the relative positions of the excavated areas at the City of David. their point of origin. Thirdly, differences in the architectural and cultural remains recovered from the diverse excavated areas at the site testify to a high degree of spatial heterogeneity in terms of function and status, which probably changed further over time. It is thus necessary to conclude that comparisons between contemporaneous strata from different areas at the site may be limited. Where possible, the bones were identified as to species, bodypart and age. Unidentified bone fragments were counted. On all bones unusual features such as burning, cut marks or pathologies were noted. Sheep and goats were separated using morphological criteria as well as condylar indices as given in Boessneck (1969). Where separation was not possible, sheep and goats were pooled into a combined 'ovicaprine' category. Species ratios were calculated using both N (number of identified bones per species) and MNI (minimum number of individuals) counts. MNI was calculated using the maximum number of sided bodyparts per species, with proximal and distal ends of bones counted separately. In addition, fusion stage of the bones was considered and immature and adult animals were summed independently. The problems associated with both methods have been discussed by numerous authors (e.g. Grayson 1984; Hesse and Wapnish 1985; Horton 1984; Crabtree 1990). N counts tend to result in slightly inflated numbers, since they do not take into account the fact that several bones may have originated from the same animal. MNI counts result in an even greater distortion, as their numbers relate directly to the method (i.e. equation) and level (i.e. locus, area, period) for which the aggregation has been made. In order to present as detailed an account of the data as possible, both MNI and N counts have been reported here. Furthermore, MNI counts have been calculated by stratum for the different areas of the site, and then recalculated by period for the site as a whole. The fish remains from the site were studied by Lernau and Lernau (1992). Their results are included in this report, as are the bird remains (Chapter X), so as to provide a complete picture of the fauna from the areas analyzed here. Aging of sheep was carried out using tables for bone fusion as given in Silver (1969). In addition, fusion rates for goats were quoted after Noddle (1974). Aging of cattle was based on data given in Grigson (1982). Bodypart breakdowns for ovica- prines and cattle follow that used by Horwitz and Tchernov (1989), where cranial remains include 303</page><page sequence="311">skull, mandible and loose teeth; forelimb includes scapula, humerus, ulna, radius, metacarpal and carpals; hindlimb includes pelvis, femur, tibia, calcaneum, astragalus, metatarsal and tarsals; feet includes phalanges 1, 2 and 3; and trunk includes vertebrae and ribs. For the bodypart breakdown, distal and proximal ends of bones were counted separately and fragmentary remains of these bones are also included; consequently numbers may be inflated, especially for ribs, vertebrae and loose teeth. MATERIAL Area Al Area Al lies in the southeastern portion of the site (Fig. 52), adjacent to the area previously excavated by Bliss and Dickie as well as Weill (see De Groot; Cohen; Caspi 1992 for stratigraphie details of these and the current excavations). Although archaeolo- gical remains from five different strata were found during the renewed excavations in this area by Shiloh, animal remains from this area were con- centrated in a single locus (L. 1) in Stratum 6 (Early Roman). L. 1 is a pottery dump containing large amounts of stone vessels, close to 4000 ceramic vessels, glass, coins and animal bones. The deposit reaches a maximum thickness of some 3 meters down to bedrock (De Groot; Cohen; Caspi 1992: 15). A total of 1722 bones was recovered from this dump. Over half of the bones (NISP = 871) were unidentifiable bone fragments, of which 5 were burnt. The remaining 863 bones were identifiable as to species and bodypart. Sheep and goat bones dominated the assemblage, followed by cattle. Other species represented in this area included Table 1. Species breakdown by area and stratum.

In this area the predominant bird consumed was goose, followed by chicken and duck (see Chapter X). Two species of fish were identified from this area: Nile perch and little tunny (Lernau and Lernau 1992). Bodypart breakdown for ovicaprine and cattle remains is given in Fig. 54. For both species, foot bones are the least frequently represented element, while the most frequently represented element is the hindlimb for ovicaprines and trunk for cattle. Fore- and hindlimbs are represented in similar numbers for both species. Fusion data for selected ovicaprine bones are given in Table 2. Although the sample sizes are small, there appears to have been some selection for animals aged 2 years or older, as evidenced by the frequency of unfused bones in this age range.

The relatively high frequency of cut marks on the bones is probably related to the fact that they are derived from a refuse deposit. Area B Area B lies on the eastern slope of the City of David and is the excavated area closest to the base of the Kidron Valley (Fig. 52). The excavated area covered some 70 sq. m. A small assemblage of animal remains spanning the Chalcolithic period to the Iron Age II was recovered here. The animal remains from the Chalcolithic period and Early Bronze Age I were recovered from a dark brown soil deposit in loci on the bedrock. Alto- gether 40 bones were recovered from the Chalco- lithic period (L. 136, Stratum 21), of which 25 were identified as to species: in order of dominance, ovicaprines (including at least two immature ani- mals), cattle and an immature pig (Table 1 and Fig. 55). One of the ovicaprine bones was burnt. In addition, 31 identifiable bones were recovered from Table 2. Ovicaprine fusion frequencies for selected bones, areas and strata.

Histogram of species represented in Area B. an Early Bronze Age context (L. 126A, Strata 20- 19) which included some Chalcolithic material. Once again ovicaprine remains predominated (one adult and one immature animal), followed by cattle, the latter all bones from adult animals. Eight unidentifiable bone fragments were also found here. The Iron Age II sample is derived from two strata: 14 and 12. The faunai remains from Stratum 12 were found in a structure termed Building 130. They included 12 bones of ovicaprines and cattle. The remains from Stratum 14 were found in a structure that antedates Building 130. Here only 8 bones were identified, representing ovicaprines and cattle (Fig. 55). All bones from these strata represent adult animals. In Area B, a similar range of animal species is represented in all periods (Fig. 55). However, the relative frequencies of the different species are difficult to assess due to the small sample sizes. Area D1 An area of about 500 sq. m. was excavated in Area Dl. Animal remains were primarily recovered from three Iron Age strata, 15, 14 and 12, with the bulk of the material deriving from a limited area (about 20 sq. m.) lying to the east of the entrance to a natural cave (Stratum 15). In addition, some material was recovered from Stratum 8, which yielded only 3 unidentifiable bone fragments and has been excluded from further analyses. Stratum 9 yielded a single ovicaprine astragalus, which has been included in the strata totals. Stratum 15 The majority of the animal bones recovered from Area Dl were found in this stratum (Table 1); 4174 unidentified bones and 1394 identifiable ones. The densest concentration of animal bones was found in a refuse dump (L. 450), some 2 meters thick, lying east of a natural cave whose contents had previously been excavated by Weill. Ariel; Hirschfeld; Savir (forthcoming) have proposed that the cave was utilized during the course of Stratum 15 and that during this period, perhaps towards its end, the contents of the cave were dumped outside, resulting in this enormous accumulation. Although some five superimposed debris layers were noted in this accumulation during excavation, there were no indications of marked differences between them and consequently they are treated here as a single accumulation. Animal species represented in L. 450 were, in order of predominance: ovicaprines, cattle, pig, gazelle, dog, goose and partridge. A lighter-colored layer (L. 433 and L. 437) overlay L. 450. These loci were poor in bone remains (only 6 identifiable bones) and conse- quently contained remains of only a limited range of species: ovicaprines and cattle. Another large bone accumulation in Stratum 15 was found in L. 447, a gray ashy deposit lying on bedrock to the north of the cave entrance. The range of species found here was similar to that found in L. 450: ovicaprines, cattle, deer, pig and goose. Summarizing the data for Stratum 15 as a whole, the vast majority of bones were those of sheep and goats; cattle and several other species (dog, moun- tain gazelle, fallow deer and pig) were represented in small numbers (Fig. 56). Both the dog and the pig Fig. 56.

For ovicaprines, fore- and hindlimbs are represented in similar frequencies (Fig. 57), while cranial remains dominate the assemblage. For cattle a similar pattern is observed, with cranial remains being the most numerous. Examination of the data on bone fusion indicates an increase in the number of animals aged about 2 years or older that were exploited in this period (Table 2), relative to those aged 1 year or less. There is however a higher mortality of animals aged 1 year or less than is found in the other strata in this area. Six ovicaprine bones, all from the ashy fill in L. 447, were burnt. In addition, some 20 ovicaprine bones from the stratum as a whole exhibited cut marks (2% of the identified assemblage). These included: 4 atlas vertebrae (one of which has been sawn in half), 5 astragali, a tibia shaft, 2 pelvis acetabulae and one pelvis fragment, 1 distal and 2 proximal radii, a scapula blade, a distal scapula, a distal femur and a distal metacarpal. In addition, cut marks were present on a pig distal radius and a distal scapula of a cow. Fig. 57. Pie diagram showing bodypart breakdown for caprovines and cattle for Area Dl. Stratum 14 Nearly 2000 bones were recovered from Stratum 14 in this area. Of these, 1269 were unidentifiable fragments, while 669 (34%) were diagnostic as to species and bodypart. The deposits belonging to this strata comprise fill that may have originated higher up the hill. Ovicaprines formed the predominant species in the assemblage, followed by cattle. Other minor species represented were: donkey, fallow deer, dog (including one neonate), mountain gazelle (a male animal) and a pig (Table 1 and Fig. 56). Bird species represented include goose and partridge (Chapter X). There is a difference in the relative representation of ovicaprine and cattle bodyparts (Fig. 57): cattle elements are almost equally represented, while for ovicaprines feet and trunk elements are present in lower frequencies than limb and cranial bones. As regards the data for bone fusion (Table 2), there appears to have been selection for animals aged 24 months or older. Four ovicaprine bones, a goat horncore, two 1st phalanges and a distal tibia were burnt, while 3 ovicaprine distal scapulae exhibited marks resulting from carnivore gnawing. Altogether 24 ovicaprine bones (4% of identified sheep/goat material) had cut marks: a proximal radius, 3 astragali, a proximal femur, 2 pubis fragments, 2 proximal ulnae, 10 distal scapulae, 2 distal humeri, a distal femur, and a distal tibia that had also been sawn in half. Only 2 cattle bones (2%), a proximal radius and a distal tibia shaft, exhibited cut marks. Stratum 12 Stratum 12 represents an extramural residential area dating from the 8th century BCE. The meager nature of the architectural remains do not facilitate a detailed reconstruction of the layout of this area. Of some 760 bones recovered, only 35% (265 bones) were identifiable; the remaining 497 bones were unidentifiable fragments. Most of the bones found in this stratum are derived from a refuse pit (L. 317) that contained 154 identifiable bones of ovicaprines, cattle and pig. For the stratum as a whole a broader range of species were represented: primarily ovicaprines followed by cattle, while pig, fallow deer, goose and partridge are represented in low numbers (Table 1 and Fig. 56). Fusion data for ovicaprines are given in Table 2. 308 AREA D1 STRATUM 15 40 ^ HINDLIMB 27 7 OVICAPRINE CATTLE STRATUM 14 20 OVICAPRINE CATTLE STRATUM 12 n'/mAPDiMP nATTi t=</page><page sequence="316">There is no clearly discernible trend in age profiles, other than a tendency for animals to be slaughtered over the age of 2 years. Larger sample sizes are needed to assess the significance of this finding. The bodypart breakdown for both sheep/goat and cattle is given in Fig. 57. For sheep/goat the forelimb is the most frequently represented, while for cattle cranial remains predominate. Very few trunk elements are present for either species, indicating that the remains are mainly of limb bones. Seven ovicaprine bones were burnt and 2 were cut: a distal humerus and a proximal radius. In addition cut marks were present on a cow distal humerus. Summary of Area D1 The Iron Age II strata (12 and 14) showed similarities in the range and relative frequencies of animals exploited (Fig. 56). In both strata, ovica- prines represented about 80% of the remains and cattle about 16%, while deer and pig comprised less than 4%. Stratum 14 does, however, contain remains of gazelle and equid, which are absent in the Stratum 12 assemblage. This may however be due to the larger sample of identifiable material from Stratum 14 (669 bones as opposed to 265 identifiable bones in Stratum 12). When compared to the Iron Age II material, the Iron Age I assemblage (Stratum 15) contains a lower frequency of cattle, while the same range of wild animal species is found as in Stratum 14. No equid remains were present in this stratum. Ovica- prines are present in roughly the same frequency as in the subsequent period. Area D2 In this area, faunai remains from the Chalcolithic through Hellenistic periods were excavated. Un- fortunately, only very small bone samples derived from each stratum. Consequently, only species frequencies were calculated for most of the strata (Fig. 58) and no age breakdown is given. The bodypart breakdown is for ovicaprines only, and reflects overall trends in element representation. These results should be treated with caution due to the small sample sizes. Chalcolithic-Early Bronze Age As in Area B, a small sample of Chalcolithic-Early Bronze Age fauna (Strata 21-20) was excavated here from pits dug into the bedrock. Altogether 17 Fig. 58. Histogram of species represented in Area D2. identifiable bones from these periods, representing ovicaprines, cattle and pig, were recovered (Table 1). In Stratum 20, only 3 cattle bones were found, one of which was cut. A similarly small sample of 5 identified bones was recovered from Strata 20-17, spanning the Early and Middle Bronze Ages: 4 of sheep/goat and 1 of cattle. In L. 1891, dated to the Late Bronze Age (Stratum 16), 34 identifiable bones and 47 unidentifiable fragments were found. Some 70% (25 bones) represented ovicaprines, while the remaining 9 bones (30%) were of cattle (Table 1 and Fig. 58). Bodypart breakdown for ovicaprines (Fig. 59) indicates the presence of few trunk or feet bones. Iron Age II The Iron II deposits in this area lie outside the city wall. Strata 14-12 are also represented by small rather poorly preserved samples (Table 1). Stratum 14 contained 38 unidentifiable bones and 17 identifiable ones, 16 of which were ovicaprine and 1 cattle. One of the ovicaprine bones was burnt. Stratum 13 was likewise represented by only 21 identifiable bones that included remains of ovica- prines, cattle, pig and fallow deer (Fig. 58). One of the ovicaprine bones was burnt and 2 humeri shafts had cut marks. Strata 13-12 contained 39 unidenti- fiable fragments and 40 identifiable ones, represent- ing ovicaprines, cattle and bird. A larger bone sample was present in Stratum 12, with 115 identifiable and 181 non-diagnostic bones. This assemblage was dominated by ovicaprines, followed by cattle. Isolated bones of an equid and a small-sized cat, probably a wild species, were also 309 AHfcA UZ 20 0 K i i i i ^ i i i ' ^ 3IRD 20-21 20 17-20 10 14 12-14 13 12-13 12 9 7 STB ATA</page><page sequence="317">Fig. 59.

Three ovicaprine bones had been cut: 2 distal humeri and a distal metacarpus (the latter had also been gnawed by a carnivore, as evidenced by pits and puncture marks on the shaft). In addition 2 cattle bones exhibited cut marks: a proximal humerus and a pelvic fragment. Strata 14-12 yielded 97 unidentifiable bones and 46 identifiable ones representing sheep/goat and cattle (Table 1 and Fig. 58). At least 2 ovicaprines were represented, one of which was immature. The Iron Age II deposits in this area are dominated by ovicaprines and cattle, with isolated finds of deer, pig, donkey and a wild cat (Fig. 58). This corroborates the picture found elsewhere at the site for contemporaneous layers. The bodypart breakdown for ovicaprines (Fig. 59) is similar for all phases of this period, displaying a high propor- tion of both fore- and hindlimbs relative to trunk and foot elements, which are poor in meat. Persian-Hellenistic A small collection of bones from the Persian period (Stratum 9) was also found in Area D2; it contained the remains of cattle (9 bones) and ovicaprines (27 bones), representing an MNI of one animal each (Table 1). In Area D2, two phases of the Hellenistic period (Stratum 7) were identified according to the provisional framework established by Shiloh (1984: 3): Stratum 7B dating from the end of the 2nd century to the 1st century BCE and Stratum 7 A dating from the 1st century up to 37 BCE. Until the full analysis of these phases in Area D2 is complete, this breakdown should be viewed as tentative. Stratum 7B contained a small identifiable sample of 29 bones, with ovicaprine, cattle and gazelle remains. Only 15 identifiable bones were recovered from Stratum 7A, representing ovicaprines, cattle, cat (possibly wild cat) and dog (Fig. 58). When pooled, the two phases of Stratum 7 yields an interestingly wide range of species despite the small sample size. The ovicaprine bodypart breakdown for the two Hellenistic phases is similar, with quite high numbers of trunk elements and low numbers of foot and cranial remains (Fig. 59). When pooled, this picture is similar to that found in Stratum 12 but contrasts with that observed in the other Iron Age II strata from this area. Stratum 7 contains almost equal frequencies of all elements, with the exception of foot bones, which are represented in low numbers. In contrast, the Iron Age strata are rich in fore- and hindlimbs and poor in trunk elements. Summary of Area D2 Despite the limitations imposed by the small size of the samples recovered from this area, it is evident that sheep and goat remains predominate in all strata, followed by cattle (Fig. 58). A broad range of other species, such as pig, deer, gazelle and carnivores, is represented, though in low numbers. Bird remains form a prominent component of the Hellenistic Stratum 7 (Chapter X). Although small, the Chalcolithic-Early Bronze Age sample resem- bles that recovered from Area B. Area H Area H lies on the eastern slope of Mount Zion, near the Siloam Pool (Fig. 52). The animal remains recovered from this area date from the Early Roman period (Stratum 6). A total of 366 bones was recovered from Area H. Of these, 187 were unidentified fragments, 3 of 310 AREA D2 STRATUM 16 STRATUM 12-14 Ü 4 " 36 " STRATUM 12-13 STRATUM 12 5 STRATUM 9 STRATUM 7 A A 1</page><page sequence="318">which were burnt. Ovicaprines (including at least one sheep and one goat) were once again the major species represented, followed by cattle (Table 1 and Fig. 60). Remains of both chicken and goose, as well as fish remains (Nile perch; Lernau and Lernau 1992), were identified. At least 2 of the ovicaprines were immature animals, while all the cattle remains were from adult animals. One ovicaprine and 2 cattle bones were burnt, while 9 ovicaprine bones and 2 cattle bones had cut marks. Fig. 60. Histogram of species represented in Area H. Fig. 61 gives the bodypart breakdowns for ovicaprines and cattle. In both species trunk elements are the most numerous, followed by cranial elements. Both these bodyparts are fre- quently discarded as butchery offal; their high representation may be related to the fact that most of the deposits in this area are fills. Fore- and hindlimbs are present in almost identical amounts for both species. Fig. 61. Pie diagram showing bodypart breakdown for caprovines and cattle in Area H. Area K Almost all the animal remains recovered from this area are from fills dating from the Early Roman period (Stratum 6) and the Byzantine period (Stratum 3). Although the Byzantine period at the site has been subdivided into phases (Ariel and Magness 1992), the small size of the faunai sample recovered from Area K did not justify the use of these phase distinctions. Of the 59 bones found in this area, 21 were unidentifiable fragments. Remains of ovicaprines were the most numerous, with other species, cattle, donkey, dog and cat (possibly wild), represented in lower frequencies. In addition, remains of chicken and partridge (Chapter X) and a shark or ray (Lernau and Lernau 1992) were found (Table 1 and Fig. 62). At least one of the ovicaprines was immature, and at least one goat and one sheep were represented in this assemblage. Two of the ovicaprine bones were burnt. The cattle remains, all found in a cistern fill, are from an immature animal. Only the ovicaprine sample was large enough to permit a breakdown of bodyparts (Fig. 63). Inter- estingly, hindlimb elements are the most numerous, while trunk elements are present in very low frequencies. This suggests that prime meat-bearing elements are mainly represented here. DISCUSSION The long chronological sequence at the site provides an almost uninterrupted series with which to evaluate changing subsistence patterns against Fig. 62.

However, only some preliminary conclusions will be given on the basis of the material presented here, as significantly larger samples will be available with the publication of the fauna from Areas G and E. Moreover, certain periods poorly represented in the material studied here are well represented in these latter areas. It is interesting to note that despite the long time sequence represented at the City of David, the species represented show little change. In all periods and in all six areas studied here, domestic animals, especially sheep (Ovis aries) and goats ( Capra hircus), were the animals most commonly exploited in all periods, followed by cattle ( Bos taurus). Other species, such as pig (Sus scrofa ), donkey (Equus asinus) and dog (Canis familiaris ), were present, but comprise only a minor component of the assem- blage in any period (Table 3). Wild mammalian species represented at the site included mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella), fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica) and an unidentified species of cat, probably wild (Felis sp.) (Table 3). In addition, remains of fish (Lernau and Lernau 1992) and birds (Chapter X) were recovered. Table 3 presents the relative proportions of the main mammalian species identified at the site by period. Only the trends reflected in the larger samples, namely Early Roman (Stratum 6), Iron Age II (Stratum 14) and Iron Age I (Stratum 15), will be addressed. The Iron Age I and II assem- blages are almost identical in the range and relative frequency of species represented. In contrast, the Early Roman assemblage contains a lower fre- quency of ovicaprines and higher frequency of cattle. Other species show some variation: isolated remains of pig and gazelle are present in both the Iron Age strata but are absent in the Early Roman period; deer, equids and carnivores are present in all three periods but in low frequencies. A further difference is the increase in the consumption of birds in the Early Roman period relative to the Iron Age II (Chapter X). On the basis of condylar index estimates for the metatarsal and the metacarpal of adult (fully fused) animals (Boessneck 1969), it was possible to assess the numbers of sheep versus goats at the site. In order to increase the size of the data set, material from the same stratum from the different areas was pooled (Table 4). With the exception of the Iron Age I deposits (Stratum 15), in which there is a trend for more goats to be represented than sheep, all other strata contain an equal number of sheep and goats. The age profiles for animals at the site, based on bone fusion rates, are incomplete for the entire chronological sequence due to small sample sizes in some periods. Similarly, only data for ovicaprines have been given, as none of the other species provide a large enough corpus of data. In general (Fig. 64), there appears to be a peak in the exploitation of ovicaprines over the age of 2.5 years. In the Early Roman period, some 50% of the animals had been slaughtered by 36 months, while in the Iron Age I and II a lower frequency (circa 40%) of animals had been slaughtered by this age. Dental attrition data based on Payne's wear stages (Payne 1973) indicates a similar trend (stage E), but the sample sizes for each period are small. In both Areas A and H, the Early Roman period (Stratum 6) shows a similar pattern of bodypart breakdown, with all elements represented for ovicaprines in almost equal amounts. In contrast, cattle are represented by high quantities of trunk and cranial elements. This patterning contrasts with that observed for the Iron Age I and II strata, in which a more even distribution of elements is observed. There are however many differences in patterning between the Iron Age strata, and consequently there is no distinct pattern of element representation in the Iron Age. This may be related to spatial variation in activities between areas and strata. Taking into account all the features mentioned above, it is pertinent to ask whether we may talk of 312 AREA K STRATUM 3 F^7 T S/G</page><page sequence="320">Table 3.

This matter is of necessity limited by the relatively small size of all the samples in question, the largest comprising only some 1400 identifiable bones. Furthermore, the smaller the sample size, the less chance one has of recovering the full range of species originally represented in a stratum, especially those that are rare to begin with. An additional limiting factor is that most of the sample was obtained by hand collection which has introduced an additional bias. 313</page><page sequence="321">Table 4.

Age profiles for caprovines based on bone fusion rates. Consequently, all conclusions reached here need to be treated with caution. The high sub-adult ratio of ovicaprines indicates that the Early Roman subsistence economy was orientated to the exploitation and consumption of meat (see Payne 1973 for explanations of slaughter patterns). This is corroborated by the presence of all bone elements in almost equal numbers, as well as the relatively high frequency of cattle in this period. In contrast, the Iron Age reflects a broader spectrum of fauna (both wild and domestic), ovicaprines appear to have been kept into adult- hood, possibly for secondary product exploitation, while considerable variation is evident in the representation of bodyparts from the different strata. It is interesting to note that no marked differences are evident between the Iron Age I and II levels at the site, despite distinct differences in settlement size and role. In conclusion, it is proposed that the Iron Age assemblage from the City of David conforms to the expected patterning of a site involved in the primary production of food through hunting or herding. In contrast, the Early Roman period conforms more closely to a consumption oriented economy (per- haps a market system), with a higher frequency of animals exploited for meat but a generally narrower variety of food sources.

Ariel Israel Antiquities Authority This concordance provides an area/locus/registration number listing of all objects noted individually in the City of David Final Reports, Vol. III (De Groot and Ariel 1993 = Qedem 33) and the present volume, thus continuing the cross-referencing of published finds found in the concordance in Vol. II (Ariel 1990 = Qedem 30). For objects noted in Vols. III-IV but originally published in Vol. II, reference is made to the publication in Vol. II. Besides the value of the organization by archaeological context of objects published by category, a major additional element in these lists is that they provide Israel Antiquities Authority numbers for objects that have been registered, thus allowing examination of them in their permanent storage location. This concordance does not include references to finds noted only in the indexes of loci found in Vol. Ill, unless these items have received IAA numbers. As stated in the preface to Vol. II (p. XII), the locus lists that appear after the stratigraphical reports are to be considered the ultimate arbiter of stratigraphical designations. In cases where data for objects (locus or stratum designations) were given in error in Vol. Ill, or have subsequently been refined, an asterisk appears after the corrected datum. The refinements in stratum designation are generally slight and do not change the objects' stratum designation per se , but rather their phasing within the stratum. Reference for Vols. II and III is to volume and page number or to figure/plate number. In Vol. IV, where objects are presented in catalogue or tabular form, the reader is referred to the respective catalogue; no page reference to the primary presentation is given, and page numbers refer only to items that are studied in Appendices B-D in Chapter II and Appendix B in Chapter IV. When an item appears in a figure, the figure reference is given. Plate or photograph references are given for objects that are illustrated only in photographs. The categories of the objects are abbreviated as follows: BD: beads and pendants; BI: bone and ivory (with catalogue number); BR: botanical remains; C: coins (with catalogue number); FB: fish bones (with catalogue number); FG: ceramic figurines (with type number); FL: flints; GL: glass (with catalogue number); GM: gems; HS: chalk vessels (with type number); IN: inscriptions; LW: loomweights and spindle whorls (with type number); ML: molluscs; MT: metals; POT: pottery; ST: stones; W: weights (with catalogue number).
