<plain_text><page sequence="1">V.-THE MEANING OF THE TIME-DIRECTION. BY R. A. P. ROGERS. [ABSTRACT.] Kant endeavours to give an objective meaning to the Time-direction by regarding it as a concrete expression of the Category of Cause and Effect, which is the only Category which expresses an irreversible rela- tion between objects. A determines B but B does not determine A. Now- this Category as intellectual can only mean that if the cause is given it is. possible for intellect to deduce the effect; on the other hand, if the effect is given it is not possible for intellect to deduce the cause. As applied to Time, this means that given the Past the Present and Future can be foretold, but given the Present or Future the Past cannot be uniquely deduced, and may be one of several. This difference of relation, for- Kant, gives meaning to the Time-direction; if this were not true, there would be a Time-order but no Time-direction. The principle is shown, however, to be false, for the Time Series is unlique and all its parts are necessarily connected; hence omniscient intellect could deduce the only possible Past from the Present, with the same certainty as it, can deduce the only possible Future from the Present. Therefore the intellectual relation between Past and Present is reversible. This is illus- trated by showing that the fundamental laws of rigid dynamics, s = 1ft 2 etc., are reversed by merely changing the sign of t. We must therefore seek for some other objective determinant of the Time-direction. I notice that the Time-direction is psychical, i.e., when the conscious subject is abstracted, Nature appears as an endless series of phases continuously connected extending in either direction (Past or Future) indifferently. The laws of science illustrate this. Hence it follows that consciousness must make the Time-direction. I conclude that the Time-direction must have a psychical basis, and therefore a psychological explanation of it is valid, provided this can be nade objective. The explanation must therefore begin from subjective experience of the difference between Past and Future. Consciousness is always in the present, which is, so to speak, an ever-changing unit containing elements which give a meaning to the distinction between Past and Future. These elements are memory and expectation respectively in a general sense. But the active elements in both accentuate the difference most strongly. Thus desire intensifies the conception of the Future. The Future is that which can be an object of desire and is the direction in which Will moves; the Past has only a theoretical interest. This explanation, however, is purely subjective and individual. How- is there one Time, and one Time-direction for all conscious beings ? Since the Time-direction has a psychical meaning only-and in thez</page><page sequence="2">THE MEANING OF THE TIME-DIRECTION. 59 individual it is given by Will-the objectivity of the Time-direction necessarily implies objective Will. The Future, in fact, is the direction in which Objective Will necessarily moves, and through this necessary motion Time ceases to be a mere continuum. The Motive which actuates objective Will is the continuous and progressive development of some unique psychic Quality. This Quality, by its very definition, must be an 'absolute and common good' since objectivity of Will imiiplies universality. As Nature inevitably strives after an absolute and common good for all conscious beings, we have a reconciliation between Rational Ethics, and Natural Law. Finally the assumption of a Supreme Spirit inmmanent in Nature, de- livers us from the solipsisin which arises from the conception that any individual human will can guide the processes of N ature. The human Will becomes rationally objective through submission to the Divine. FROM the point of view of Religion, Time is the form in which the Divine Purpose is manifested to finite minds. Ethics regards the Future as the possibility of a better state of humanity, to be attained by free conscious action. Again, if Kant is right, in ordinarv experience we are bound to re- gard Time as the form in which the intellectual Category of irreversible relation becomes concrete. Each of these three treatments of the form of Time is an attempt to give an objective spiritual meaning to the direction-as distinct from the continuity and order-of the Time series. It is of great importance to determine if a connecting link can be found between the solutions offered in the three spheres of Religion, Ethics and theoretical philosophy. With this end in view, I propose, in the first place, to examine Kant's proof of the Second Analogy, 'All changes take place accord- ing to the law of connexion of Cause and Effect '.' The proof of the Analogies depends on the famous Anti- Humian principle that the objectivity of experience, as distinct from the subjectivity of mere impressions, means the regulation of quantified and qualified perceptions by universal and necessary laws. When we say that an event does happen, or that an object is in a certain place, we mean that a certain perception must rise in the mind of any ob- server (in a given position and with given sense-faculties) in virtue of its necessary connexion with other perceptions, and that the mind conceives, though it does not feel, this necessity. The experience of the individual is, for Hume, a mere cinematographic display of impressions ; it is this for Kant also, but the objectivity arises, not from the panoramic 'By Time-direction, I mean the relation of Past and Present. It must be carefully distinguished from the Tirne-order, which implies that Time is a Continuum of objects, like a straight line, in which the direction is indifferent.</page><page sequence="3">60 R. A. P. ROGERS: phantasms possessing a concrete internal meaning-as or- dinary people foolishly think-but from the fact that the spectator, placed in a given position, knows that the parts of any one picture must be arranged as they seem to be and that the pictures must follow one after another in the order in which they seem to follow. An appearance becomes ob- jective as soon as it is recognised as a necessary part of a scheme of appearances. Knowledge- as distinct from sub- jective feeling-implies that we recognise that the panorama of qualified and quantified impressions could not be unrolled in the reverse order, and the objects of the picture could not be arranged in any other relative position. Each of the necessary a priori intellectual elements of experience are exhibited by Kant in three phases, passing from the abstract to the concrete. First, as an abstract Judgment of formal logic. Secondly, as a transcendental concept or Category, referring to objects in general. Thirdly, in their application to our concrete experience, that is, to our perceptions. Here they become necessary laws or Principles ,of Space and Time experience.- Each phase is a more con- crete expression of the preceding one, and each of the last two phases may be exhibited in the first phase as a judg- ment. The differentia of a Principle or of the corresponding Category appears in the corresponding Judgment. In the Principle which I am now discussing-that of cause and effect-the logical phase is the Hypothetical Judgment; If a proposition A is true, the proposition B is true. This judgment is irreversible, that is, from its truth we cannot infer the truth of the converse; If B is true, then A is true. In the transcendental sphere the Category expressed as a judgment is: If A is objective then B is objective. This judgment, in like manner, cannot be converted; we cannot infer from its truth that the objectivity of B involves the objectivity of A. Here, then, we have the concept of an irreversible relation between objects, which Kant terms the relation of cause and effect. Passing to the third stage, that of our experience in Time, the Principle nmay also be ex- pressed as a Judgment, 'If A happens, then B will happen, or is happening'. This judgment cannot be converted; from its truth we cannot infer the truth of the judgment; 'If B happens then A. has happened ': for otherwise the connexion with the Hypothetical judgment would fail. The Principle then expresses the necessary irreversibility between events. This irreversibility is the concept which gives an objective meaning to the Time-direction of perceptions. If the judgment, 'If A happens, then B happens,' could be</page><page sequence="4">THE MEANING OF THE TIME-DIRECTION. 61 reversed, it would be meaningless to say that A exists before B in time. In other words (Kant holds) the irreversibility of the Time-direction depends for its objective meaning on the irreversibility of the intellectual relation between cause and effect. If a definite event (c) is given, then another event (e) is necessarily determined, and must follow. But if e, alone were given we could not argue that c is necessarily determined and has already taken place. Kant seems to&amp; have overlooked that this would be the true intellectual re-- versal of the relation. A given cause can have only one effect or series of effects, but a given effect may be produced by an indefinite number of causes. Or, more generally, many different series of events may have preceded a given event ; but only one series of events can follow a given event. The Future is determinate, the Past indeterminate. This relation between Present and Future as conceived by Kant may be illustrated mathematically. Let x be a present event, y a future event, the effect of x. The relation of cause and effect may be expressed by a functional equation y = f (x). When x is given y is uniquely determined; in other words, f (x) is a single-valued function of x. On the other hand, when y is given x is indeterminate, having more than one possible value; that is, x is a many-valued function of y. The equation y = sin x would be of this type; given x, y is determined; given y, x has an infinity of values, n 7r + (- 1) "x, where x is one of these values. If f (x) were a polynomial, such as a cubic, the same irreversibility would follow. Kant's doctrine expressed in mathematical language implies that the cause is a multiple-valued function of the effect, but the effect is a single-valued function of the cause. The whole of Kant's argument for the objectivity of theA Time-direction (as distinct from the objectivity of the Time- order, and of the isolated events in Time) depends, therefore, on the truth of this compound proposition, 'A given cause pro- duces a determined effect, but a given effect may be produced by different causes '. If this proposition is false, that is, if the present and future are, intellectually, reciprocally deter- minate, then the Time-order, for Kantians, is not objectively irreversible. Events in Time, as well as objects in space, will stand in a relation of Community (action and reaction). The principle that when a phenomenon is given, the effect. is uniquely determined may be termed the Singularity of Effects (as contrasted with the Plurality of Effects, when a phenomenon is given, the effect is indeterminate). The cor-- responding doctrines when cause and effect are interchanged may be termed the Singularity of Causes, and the Plurality-</page><page sequence="5">62 R. A. P. ROGERS: .of Causes, the latter termn being borrowed from Mill. It is clear from the above that (for Kant) the objective irreversi- bility of the Time-order depends on the truth of the two principles--the Singularity of Effects and the Plurality of Causes. But it will be shown in the sequel that if the terms Cause and Effect are used in the ordinary conven- tional and abstract sense, the Plurality of Causes and the Plurality of Effects stand or fall together, and the Singularity of Effects and the Singularity of Causes are likewise in- separable. On the other hand, if the terms Cause and Effect are used in a fully comprehensive sense, the Singu- larity of Causes and the Singularity of Effects are both self-evident; and the Plurality of Causes and the Plurality of Effects are axiomatic absurdities. It will be therefore in either case necessary, on principles suggested by Kant, to seek for some new universal concept, law or notion, to ob- jectively determine the Time-direction. Before further discussion it will be well to fix a definite meaning to the-notions of cause and effect, as exhibited in concreto. In ordinary language a cause is an isolated pheno- menon, necessarily succeeded by another isolated pheno- menon, its effect. For example, a diminution of pressure in the atmosphere causes a fall in the barometer; a sickness is the cause of death, and so on. Kant and Hume seem to have used these terms in this narrow sense. Mill defined cause as a sum of conditions positive and negative, either simultaneous with or preceding the effect, which necessarily appears when these conditions are given. Though in this way he extended the use of the term "cause," he continued to use " effect " in the same narrow sense of an isolated pheno- menon. This abstract use of terms is inevitable in practical science, which aims at producing definite effects; but Philo- sophy deals with the concrete whole of phenomena, not with abstract, isolated phenomena, and its terms should be as comprehensive as possible. By extending the notion of a sum of conditions, we arrive at the following definition of the notion of a concrete cause. A Cause in concreto is the entire infinite complex of phenomena existing at any given instant, when this complex is viewed in relation to the entire in- finite- complex of co-ex'isting phenomena which follow it in Time; the latter complex in relation to the former is Effect; and again becomes Cause of the succeeding infinite complex. An infinite complex of co-existing phenomena may be termed a complex moment of Nature, and I shall hereafter refer to it as a Moment. Nature passes in turn through its different Moments, each of which is a complex totality, in virtue</page><page sequence="6">THE MEANING OF THE TIME-DIRECTION. 63 of the law of' Community which connects all its co-existing phenomena. Any integrated sum of Moments is likewise the cause of the succeeding integrated sum of Moments. The relation of cause and effect can be applied only in a loose and secondary sense to isolated phenomena. This limited use is, as I have said, inevitable in science and ordinary life, but it really points out those elements in true cause and effect which are most conspicuous or most important for the ob- server, and capable of being reproduced in connexion. We say that a person's illness is the cause of his death. In the wider senlse of the term, the cause is the integrated sum of Moments which include his illness; the effect is the Moment which includes his death. General laws of science are abstractions, which hold good, and are true, so long as their limitations are not overpassed. Nature herself is not an abstraction, but a' concrete reality acting inevitably according to her own laws; but for Nature these laws are not formal or abstract. The activity of Nature, as Spinoza would say, is free, and not a submission to external generalities or abstractions. We may concede, however, that a Moment of Nature is, figuratively speaking, condensed in any one of its parts, and this part in its representative capacity may be regarded as the cause in relation to the following con- tiguous phenomena, which is similarly representative of its Moment. The sense which I have attached to cause and effect re- lation, as exhibited in concreto, is, I hold, necessary in order to make Kant's argument definite; for there is not a different time-series for each isolated train of phenomena. If the cause and effect relation determines the one tilme-series, there must be only one cause and one effect in each moment of Time. Nevertheless, even if cause and effect are predi- cated of isolated phenomena, the Singularity of Causes and the Singularity of Effects stand or fall together according to the point of view we take. Every series of phenomena may be regarded as different phases of a permanent. If attention is fixed on the phases, then each phase may be preceded or followed by a variety of determinate phases; and in this sense the Plurality of Causes and Effects hold good. But if attention is fixed on the permanent, then the relation be- tween cause and effect is merely one of' Identity, and the Singularities of Causes and Effects are self-evident. A given quantity of heat may pass in any order, according to cir- cumstances, through different phases, and finally pass into mechanical energy, which in turn may produce the same quantity of heat. These transformations are held as a proof</page><page sequence="7">64 R. A. P. ROGERS: of the existence of a permanent sum' of energy. The trans- formations are reversible and indeterminate. This indeter- minateness in the order of the phases arises from abstracting from the actual environment. The indeterminateness is re- moved when we regard nature as a concrete whole; then each complex Moment is the unique and necessary cause of the succeeding Moment which is its unique and necessary effect. The complete Present could have been deduced from the Past, only if all the past conditions are given; and re- ciprocally if all the present conditions are given the complete Past can be deduced from the Present. In other words, the Past is as intellectually dependent on the Present as the Present on the Past. The objection which a whole-hearted Kantian will urge against this conclusion is that the mistake arises from neglecting the schema of Tim- e. Kant himself saw the diffi- culty of applying intellectual concepts to the pure form of intuition, and to overcome this difficulty he invented-or pointed out-the existence of the schema of Time, that is, the form of Time determined d priori by the Category, be- fore empirical objects exist therein. The forms of Time exhibit it as something more than a one-dimensional con- tinuum; the direction from Past to Present is also involved. ' The schema of cause is the real which when posited is always followed by something else. It consists, therefore, in the succession of the manifold, in so far as that succession is subject to a rule.' But this description of the schema itself justifies my criti- cism. There is a definite rule of succession. You have the direction of Time given in the pure form of intuition; and the succession of definite units according to a rule is, we will suppose, given by intellectual law. But this law is not one of irreversible dependence. It is rather a law of definite order in which each unit depends on the law of order, but not on the preceding unit any more than on the succeed'ing. The conclusion at which we have arrived is capable of an ad absurdum proof. If the Past is not intellectually dependent on, and therefore deducible from, the Present, the Present may have had several different Pasts. Any one of these dif- ferent Pasts is necessarily connected with the actual Present; therefore, for Kant, each of these Pasts actually happened ! For a Transcendental Idealist, the actual Past is that series of events which would necessarily produce present percep- tions, possible or actual. This follows from the Second Postulate of Empirical Thought. " Was mit den materialen Bedingungen der Erfahrung (der Empfindung) zusammen-</page><page sequence="8">THE MEANING OF THE TIME-DIRECTION. 65 huingt, ist wirklich." The history of Nature and Man will be indeterminate, being, in fact, multiple. It will be meaning- less to inquire what was the actual course of History, for there were many courses. The problem will be what different series of events could have produced the Present. It may be true that Napoleon really existed; it may simultaneously be true that he was a myth, and that all the writings and traditions relating to him were forgeries or lies. Memory also will be an extraordinary phenomenon; of these different actual Pasts it selects only one; but it should, if trust- worthy, report all the different actual Pasts which, experi- enced by the individual, could have produced his present perceptions ! The above is a reductio ad absurdum of the doctrine of the intellectual irreversibility of the Time-series. The direct principle involved is that the actual course of History is unique, and the Present is representative of it; the Future is also unique and necessarily follows from the given Present. Omniscience could argue back from the Present to the only possible Past, i.e., to the actual Past; or from the Present to the only possible Future, i.e., to the actual Future. Dyna-- mics affords a good illustration of this. In that science-as in all abstract sciences-Time is regarded as a one-dimensional continuum (t) in which the order of events is necessary, but the direction is conventional. It is true that no dynamical scheme has been discovered which will satisfy all the formal laws of Nature; yet the reversibility of dynamical laws are symbolic of the intellectual reversibility of all the laws of Nature. Newton's laws are expressed in prophetical form, but they are really just as much historical. The first law, for example, may be stated, 'Every body has been in a state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line since the last force acted on it'. If the motion of every particle of matter were instantaneously reversed, it is quite possible that, every law remaining unchanged, past phenomena would be pro- duced in inverse order. The planets, for example, would move round the sun in the opposite direction in exactly the same orbits, and with the same periods, if their motions were instantaneously reversed. A like theorem is true for every conservative system of forces; if the velocities at every point are reversed, the past states are reproduced in the same order. Whether this is true in general does not alter the fact that the reversed order is always uniquely deducible by changing the sign of t in the prophetic equation. The simplest cases are the fundamental equations. The equation s = vt + ift2 is prophetic or historical according to the sign 5</page><page sequence="9">66 R. A. P. ROGERS: of t. It may be objected that this equation does not apply backwards ad inf., but its backward application, like its for- ward application, is dependent on the positions of other particles. The present positions, masses and velocities of all the particles are supposed to be given in both cases. We conclude that the relation between the Complex Moments in the Time-series is, intellectually, a relation of reciprocity-action and re-action-just as much as the rela- tion between different objects in space. Keeping to Kant's intellectual view of Causality (the pure Category), this means that the Future is just as much the cause of the Present as the Present is of the Future, or to put the same truth in different language, the Final Cause (the Future viewed as determining the Present) just as much as the Efficient Cause (the Present viewed as determining the Future) is a necessary postulate of Science and of History. This conclusion will no doubt cause some surprise. To those who, in opposition to Kant, hold that events in Time have a self-dependent, isolated existence, the proof will appear as a mere argumentum ad hominem against Kant, and there- fore of little value. It must be fairly obvious, however, that Time is the form in which the eternal concrete unity of Nature breaks into a plurality of phases. Each phase has thus an eternal or ontological as well as a merely transitory or phenomenal meaning. The ontological meaning-though it is really concrete-we make definite to ourselves by concep- tions of universal laws, which as such are supra-temporal. Each Moment acts ontologically sub specie aeternitatis. We cannot say that the Future does not yet act ontologically,, for the ontological action must be conceived as outside the Time- series. A Moment of Nature viewed phenomenally, that is, as a mere appearance, is not determinative of anything either past or future. The action of Nature is, so to speak, behind the scenes, and revealed to us by intellectual conceptions of necessary connexion. Ontologically, then, the Future exists even in the Present, through the fact that it necessarily de- termines the Present; and the Past is actual in the Present because it necessarily determines the Present. The Future is dependent on that which is eternal in the Present, and the Present is likewise dependent on that which is eternal in the Future. The same eternal essence manifests itself in both, in different phases. The point at issue between the Final Cause and the Efficient is: Does the Future, the Pre- sent or the Past more clearly reveal to us the eternal and invisible essence of Nature ? We have now to attack the question which we have seen</page><page sequence="10">THE MEANING OF THE TIME-DIRECTION. 67 is not solved by the Category of Cause and Effect. What is the objective law, concept, or notion, which makes the differ- ence between Past and Future, or must we regard the problem as insoluble and admit that the difference is purely subjective and based on momentary feeling ? Nature reveals herself as a plurality of units (Moments) in a fixed order, but more, there is a certain direction in this order. What does this direction mean ? The units themselves (as appear- ance) do not contain this meaning, this difference. Is there, then, some transcendent quality existing in the Present in a greater degree than in the Past, and in the Future in a greater degree than in the Present ? Static reflexion as distinguished from personal and histori- cal experience-cannot answer this question, for it only re- gards the Time Moments as having an external relation to each other. Apart from conscious existence in the time-series the Time-direction is indifferent. Mathematics, pure and applied, are the best illustrations of this. For these time is a one- dimensional quantity like a straight line (+ t). This is obviously true in Algebra, Geometry and Statics, and I have shown that it holds for Dynamics. It is true, though not so obvious for every abstract science-that is, for every science except Ethics, which is the only science whose direct object is personality as actually existing in concrete, and not as an abstraction. All natural and experimental Sciences abstract from self-consciousness. The essential thing in these is con- tinuity and arrangement in definite order. It seems para- doxical, but is nevertheless true, that in these abstract Sciences the time-direction is of no consequence. Scientific laws may be expressed in logical form, e.g., All A is B, and this form is independent of the Time; or they may be ex- pressed in continuity form: If A is, B follows in Time. But the essence of this law is expressed in the statement that A and B are juxta-posed in a continuum, a conventional direction being assumed. The whole order might be reversed, and we could say: If A is, B preceded; no error would ensue, because the relation of Past and Future is here quite abstract and conventional. Evolution does not alter this argument. The same is true even of empirical psychology, which in its laws regards states of mind as different entities arranged in a certain order. It is only in their ethical application that the laws of abstract sciences become concrete. The laws have a concrete origin, they are discovered by persons acting from ethical motives, and in like manner they have a concrete application. A scientist, in expressing these laws, naturally -takes the order in which they were actually revealed to him</page><page sequence="11">68 R. A. P. ROGERS: as the most convenient one for statement, but this does not alter the fact that, expressed as abstract general laws, Time is regarded as a one-dimensional continuuim; and they do not invoke any notion of time direction unless they are brought into express connexion with self-consciousness. This is done in the practical application of the laws. " Science must treat the world of objects as self-subsistent in abstrac- tion from the knowing subject," 1 and when this abstraction is made, the Time-direction, though not the Time-order, is indifferent. Every science deals with a mere plurality of objects; its general laws state connexions between objects or classes of objects. The essential difference between Past, Present and Future has, I conclude, no meaning when Nature is regarded exter- nally, that is, as a complex of lifeless phenomena. Externally viewed, Nature is a unity possessing an infinite series of phases (Moments). Each phase is necessarily connected with the contiguous phase on either side of it, in the one-dimen- sional continuum of Time. But no Time-direction emerges from this view of Nature. The Time-direction only emerges when the mind returns to itself and views Nature internally or from the subjective point of view. The subject, so to speak, puts life into Nature, which otherwise appears as a lifeless connexion of units, arranged in a determinate order, but possessing no direction. We have now arrived at a most important truth. The trreversibility of the time-direction is purely psychical ; we can- not therefore treat the time-order in an abstract formal way as Kant did; for if we do so, we shall never get beyond the continuum idea; for the meaning of the Time-direction we must have recourse to concrete personal experience. Thus the subjective or psychological method of interpreting the Time-direction is indispensable as a starting point; for its objectivity is primarily revealed to us through its subjec- tivity. Anthropomorphism is here justifiable and necessary, for the time-direction is actual for a conscious Time subject, and not actual when we abstract the conscious subject. The mind apprehends each of its phases (sub-phases of Nature) as a present consciousness. The subjective question will be what qualitatively differing feelings or sensations are there in present consciousness, which give rise to the conception of a qualitative difference in the direction in which Time-units move ? Our first appeal, therefore, will be to direct psychological 'Mr. T. F. Underhill, MIND, April, 1904.</page><page sequence="12">THE MEANING OF THE TIME-DIRECTION. 69 observation. The subjective meaning of the Time-direction will emerge from an analysis of the units of consciousness. By a unit of consciousness I merely mean a concrete syn- thesis of which one is immediately conscious. These units are the ultimate data of observational psychology. Every such unit is really an instantaneous phase of the Ego, and the bridge between preceding and succeeding units. Each unit thus involves two elements, memory and expectation. Of course it is only by repetition and comparison that these elements enmerge as distinct. The unique quality of the memory-element is the subjective basis of a conception of past time; the unique quality of the expectation-element is the subjective basis of a conception of future time. Subjectively then, the conception of past time has for its empirical basis a perception of the quality common to all memory sensations; to avoid abstraction we may describe it as individualised in a unit of consciousness, or a remembered series of such units, in which the memory element is speci- ally prominent. In like manner the conception of future time is individualised in a unit of consciousness-or remem- bered series of such units-in which the expectation element is specially prominent. The subjective conception further of past time as a series arises thus: A series of units occur. Each unit as it occurs contains in itself a memory of the last, and contrast as well as resemblance therewith. The contrast makes us conscious of a difference in the units, the semblance gives a sense of a unity or connexion. Each unit has a direct contrast with its neighbour. Thus in a given unit you have a memory of a contiguous memory of a con- tiguous memory, etc. This can be imaged only by a spatial continuum. How does the sense of a unity of the series arise ? To answer this we must remember that each unit is a phase of the Ego. The unity of the Ego is given in the unit, and in each unit past units are presented as nmemories and so as phases of the present unity. Thus there is only one series, as only one Ego is conceivable. When once we have imaged the past as a spatial continuum (most simply a line) with the present Ego at one end of the line, there rises inevitably a thought of this line extended indefinitely in the other direction; and this in connexion with the expectation- sensation gives a conception of future time as a series. The subjective root of our concept of- future and past time is, however, not expectation and memory in a passive sense only; it includes desire and aversion generally, that is, a sense of mental activity. Desire involves imagination, by help of past experience, of a phase of the Ego different from,</page><page sequence="13">70 R. A. P. ROGERS: and more pleasant than, the present phase. Primarily this image of the Ego is subordinate to the present Ego, and quite static-merely an ideal. Secondarily, the present Ego- phase strives inevitably to pass into the imagined pleasanter Ego-phase, i.e., it strives to exclude all perceptions which are imagined as non-existing in the ideal Ego-phase. There is thus a conscious effort to expel certain perceptions-aver- sion, a negative self-destructive activity of the present Ego, which in its entirety rejects and repudiates some of its parts. This aversion, when successful, intensifies the conception of past time. In like manner Desire is a positive activity, a conscious effort on the past of the present Ego to give the fullest possible intensity to the imagined pleasant Ego-phase. Thus desire 'intensifies the conception of future time. It may be noticed that the subjectivity of these processes is strongly apparent in that eidolon tribus to which most of us are subject-the tendency to persuade ourselves that what is pleasant is true, and what is unpleasant is false. Fear may be termed negative desire, and is distinguished from aversion as being directed not against the elements in the presented Ego-phase, but against an imagined Ego-phase. Fear also evokes the conception of future time. In like manner the feeling Relief is successful aversion, and tends to strengthern the concept of past time. Generally speaking, the Past is that which evokes only a theoretical interest and cannot be an object of desire. The Future evokes a lively practical interest, and is necessarily an object of desire in some form. Desire, then, is the subjective element which gives a meaning to the distinction between Past and Present. The mind is passive in relation to the Past, active in relation to the Future. Without desire, there can be no self-conscious existence in Time.' We may inquire whether this hypothesis has an immediate practical application. An event B follows A; we say then that A is not, and B is. Our attitude towards the percep- tions given by A is this: They are thrown away, they are no longer possible objects of our desire, they have, so to speak, a merely theoretical interest. It is true that so-called con- sequences survive, and have an immediate practical interest, but consequences are ipso facto in the Present, B. The Future, on the other hand, has a practical interest, it is an object of desire (including curiosity), and has a real meaning in the Present. 1 Since writing this article, I have been informed that Dr. Hodgson's psychology of the ' Time-stream' is virtually the same as the above.</page><page sequence="14">THE MEANING OF THE TIME-DIRECTION. 71 The above may be regarded as a solipsistic exposition of the genesis of a conception of the Time-direction. If I were the only Ego, further discussion would be superfluous. I could say Past Time is the abstract form which memory (including successful aversion) creates for itself, and Future Time the form which expectation (including desire) creates for itself. The Past would be a thin psychological residue of numerous memories and successful aversions, and simi- larly for the future. It would be idle to ask: Does con- sciousness presuppose the time-direction, or conversely? The coiicrete elements of consciousness are the given realities, the form is abstract and ideal. But I am not the only consciousness. Where, then, does the conception of the objective unity of the Time-direction arise ? We have three degrees of psychical unity. First, the unity of a unit of consciousness-here the conceptions referred to originate; secondly, the unity of the Ego through all its units; thirdly, the unity of the experience of all conscious beings.' The objective unity of the Time-direction exists as the same conception for all conscious beings, it must there- fore involve, in so far as its objective nature can be under- stood, the conception of a Collective Will of conscious beings. There is one Time-direction for all in so far as they will the same thing. The unity of the Time-direction is thus a mere hypothesis except on the assumption of a universal object of will common to conscious beings who have a rational con- sciousness of their existence in Time. That all minds which are capable of a rational knowledge of Nature are the expres- sion of a Concrete Unity, and in their Unity aim at a single end (the Future) is the assumption necessary to justify our conviction that there is one Time-direction common to all conscious beings. Time, then, primarily a one-dimensional continuum is directed by the motion of Objective Will. The Future is the direction in which Objective Will proceeds. This as- sumption is necessary to give the conception of unified force. The direction, however, is not arbitrary but essen- tial. The Will proceeds not according to fickle choice, but according to a single principle actualised in the other direc- tion of the Future. There must, in short, be a continuous 1The subjective conception of the Time-direction is created by desire. It has been shown, further, that the Time-direction has only a psychic meaning. It follows that its universal meaning can be no more than an extension of the immediate meaning which it has for the individual. This is the fulcrum of the argument which is not however solipsistic but personal.</page><page sequence="15">472 R. A. P. ROGERS: imotive urging objective will, whose process is now seen to be development or evolution, the unfolding of something which did not exist before and which is inevitably progressive; and not to be identified with any collocation of things in Nature viewed externally. I have endeavoured to show, in fact, that the mere Form of Time necessarily implies a cer- tain continuous development of some unique Quality in Nature viewed psychically (the abstract or external point of view gives mere continuity). This Quality belongs to the Time Moment as a whole, not to its isolated parts. The Present contains more of the Quality than the Past, and the Past than the Future. We have seen that t]4e Time- direction has a psychical meaning only; but since their direction is only the form in which the Quality appears, it follows that the Quality has a psychical meaning, and since the Time-direction is objective and universal, so is the Quality. It is, in other words, that which is an object of Universal Will. When two persons will the same object, they are in touch with this secret of Nature. To will the same object does not mean merely to have harmonious wishes, which can both be gratified, but to will something as an absolute end. Now, in this conception (a common object of will) we have the innermost germ of morality. It is what Green calls an absolute and common good, and is, of course, clearly involved in Kant's conception, the universality of the moral law. The Quality, therefore, at which Nature herself aims is 'An absolute and common good,' a good common to all rational beings, i.e., those endowed with the capacity for conceiving a common good. Here are the heads of the whole argument. From the formal point of view Time is primarily a one-dimensional continuum, a series of units. The schema of Time is only a subterfuge to escape from this. The law of irreversible de- pendence (cause and effect) does not make it otherwise; for we have seen that the Past as well as the Future may be uniquely deduced from the Present. But when we come back to experience, we find that the mind does view the Past in a different light from the Present; and the felt dis- tinction between desire and indifference is the subjective root of this distinction, we conclude that the Time-direction is not abstract but psychical-determined by Will. But the will must be objective, for Time-direction is objective. Hence Time is the form of continuous development of some Quality which is a necessary motive for objective or Universal Will. This conclusion as to the objective basis of the Time- direction is, I believe, the only solution of the problem</page><page sequence="16">THE MEANING OF THE TIME-DIRECTION. 73 raised. It has the further advantage of connecting intel- lectual philosophy with the Ethics of pure Duty (as exhibited by Kant) and with the philosophy of Religion. Daty re- quires that a rational being should act according to the con- ception of universal law, thus making his will objective. 'The above doctrine shows that every being who is completely and rationally conscious of his existence in Time must make his will objective-he must freely submit to the laws of Nature, regarding them as the expression of his own will, and at the same time as aiming at an absolute and common good. Thus the way is paved for Reli-gion, which extricates us from the inevitable solipsism-involved in saying that a rational being recognises the laws of Nature as the expres- sion of his own will-by providing the conception of a Supreme Spirit who is immanent in Nature-to Whom xational beings freely yield their wills.</page></plain_text>
