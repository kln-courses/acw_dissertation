<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT DIRECTIONS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE Personality Dimensions in Nonhuman Animals: A Cross-Species Review Samuel D. Gosling1 and Oliver P. John Institute of Personality and Social Research, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California Abstract The evolutionary continuity between humans and other animals suggests that some dimensions of personality may be common across a wide range of species. Unfortunate ly, there is no unified body of research on animal personal ity; studies are dispersed across multiple disciplines and diverse journals. To review 19 studies of personality factors in 12 nonhuman species, we used the human Five-Factor Model plus Dominance and Activity as a preliminary framework. Extra version, Neu roticism, and Agreeableness showed the strongest cross species generality, followed by Openness; a separate Con scientiousness dimension ap peared only in chimpanzees, humans' closest relatives. Cross-species evidence was modest for a separate Dom inance dimension but scant for Activity. The comparative approach taken here offers a fresh perspective on human personality and should facilitate hypothesis-driven research on the social and biological bases of personality. Keywords personality; traits; cross species; Big Five; temperament In a recent article in the Los Angeles Times, Robert Fagen, a professor of biometry, described Susie as irascible, irritable, grumpy, and manipulative. This is hardly newsworthy, except that Susie is a bear. Scientists have been reluctant to ascribe personality traits, emo tions, and cognitions to animals, even though they readily accept that the anatomy and physiology of humans is similar to that of ani mals. Yet there is nothing in evolu tionary theory to suggest that only physical traits are subject to selec tion pressures, and Darwin (1872/1998) argued that emotions exist in both human and nonhu man animals. Thus, personality traits like Extraversion and Agreeableness may not be as uniquely human as once was thought (Buss, 1988). Early at tempts to assess animal personali ty, including the pioneering studies by Stevenson-Hinde, were con ducted in the 1970s, and the 1990s have seen a resurgence of research activity. Our goal in this article is to take stock of what is known about animal personality, focusing on in dividual differences within species. We ask, What are the major dimen sions of animal personality? MAPPING THE LANDSCAPE OF ANIMAL PERSONALITY Faced with the challenge of inte grating the fragmented literature on animal personality, we felt like early cartographers faced with the challenge of constructing a map of the globe. Our task?much like that of the cartographers?was to piece together the isolated reports about the landscape of personality. These reports came in different lan guages; used a variety of scales, methods, and notations; and varied in their scope and reliability. Our first task was to select the most trustworthy reports; starting with more than 100 potentially relevant studies, we selected those that had sample sizes larger than 20 animals and a reasonably broad coverage of personality traits.2 To integrate the many pieces of information provided by the di verse research reports, we used the most widely accepted and com plete map of personality structure: the human Five-Factor Model (FFM; John, 1990). The FFM is a hi erarchical model with five broad factors (Table 1), which represent personality at the broadest level of abstraction. Each bipolar factor (e.g., Extraversion vs. Introversion) summarizes several more specific facets (e.g., sociability), which, in turn, subsume a large number of even more specific traits (e.g., talk ative, outgoing). Unfortunately, no short labels capture the broad FFM dimensions adequately, so the tra ditional labels are easily misunder stood; thus, we use the letters N (for Neuroticism, Nervousness, Negative affectivity), A (for Agree ableness, Altruism, Affection), E (for Extraversion, Energy, Enthu siasm), O (for Openness, Origin ality, Open-mindedness), and C (for Conscientiousness, Control, Constraint). Are there additional dimensions that might be of special importance for describing the personality of nonhuman animals? In adult human personality, Activity and Dominance are part of the E dimen sion. In children, however, Activity may form a separate dimension (John, Caspi, Robins, Moffitt, &amp; Stouthamer-Loeber, 1994), and temperament models (Buss &amp; Plomin, 1984) also consider it sepa rate. Moreover, many socially liv ing animal species show individual differences related to status in the dominance hierarchy: Individuals with high status can control others Copyright ? 1999 American Psychological Society 69</page><page sequence="2">70 VOLUME 8, NUMBER 3, JUNE 1999 Table 1.

To explore whether Activity and Dominance form separate dimensions in ani mals, we added them to the five FFM dimensions in our prelimi nary framework (see Table 2). Our review includes 19 factor analytic studies and represents 12 different species. We reviewed the items defining each personality fac tor in each study and compared them with the definitions of the seven potential dimensions in Table 2. If there was a match in item content, we classified the animal factor into one of the seven dimen sions and included its label (or a short definition) in the appropriate column of Table 2.3 Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Agreeableness: Cross-Species Dimensions? Three human FFM dimen sions?E, N, and A?showed con siderable generality across species. Of the 19 studies, 17 identified a factor related to E. The factor labels in the E column in Table 2 range from Surgency in chimpanzees to Sociability in pigs, dogs, and rhe sus monkeys; Energy in cats and dogs; Vivacity in donkeys; and a dimension contrasting Bold Approach versus Avoidance in oc topuses. The particular labels may differ, but they all reflect core fea tures of the broad E dimension (see Table 1). Factors related to N ap peared almost as frequently; again, despite the differences in factor la bels, these animal factors capture core elements of N, such as Fearfulness, Emotional Reactivity, Excitability, and low Nerve Stability. Factors related to A ap peared in 14 studies, with Affability, Affection, and Affinity capturing the high pole of A, and Aggression, Hostility, and Fighting capturing the low pole.4 The evidence indicates that chimpanzees, various other pri mates, nonprimate mammals, and even guppies and octopuses all show individual differences that can be organized along dimensions akin to E, N, and (with the excep tion of guppies and octopuses) A. These remarkable commonalities across such a wide range of taxa suggest that general biological mechanisms are likely responsible. The way these personality dimen sions are manifested, however, de pends on the species. For example, whereas the human scoring low on Extraversion stays at home on Saturday night, or tries to blend into a corner at a large party, the octopus scoring low on Boldness stays in its protective den during feedings and attempts to hide itself by changing color or releasing ink into the water. Openness: Another Potential Cross-Species Personality Dimension? Factors related to the O dimen sion in the FFM were identified in Published by Blackwell Publishers, Inc. 7 of the 12 species. The two major components defining this dimen sion were curiosity-exploration (interest in new situations and novel objects) and playfulness (which is associated with E when social, rather than imaginative, as pects of play are assessed). Although these factors are similar to the O dimension known from humans, some core facets are obvi ously missing; openness to ideas and interest in arts are difficult to observe in animals that lack ad vanced means of symbolic expres sion, such as language and music. The O factor in these animal stud ies resembles the early forms of O observed in human toddlers; lack ing advanced language skills, their curiosity is manifested in an in tense interest in novel objects and events, and their imagination is shown in perspective taking and role shifts characteristic of pretend play. The evidence for an O-related factor was not consistent across multiple studies of the same species, pointing to methodologi cal differences, most likely in the traits included in the studies. For example, the two chimpanzee studies that did not find an O fac tor did not include items clearly relevant to O. Given that forms of curiosity have been observed in a wide range of species, a thorough and focused search should pro vide more consistent evidence for O.</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT DIRECTIONS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE 71 Conscientiousness: Only in Humans and Chimpanzees? Although cats and dogs showed a factor that combined C and O, chimpanzees were the only species with a separate C factor. The chim panzee factor was defined more narrowly than in humans but in cluded lack of attention and goal directedness, as well as erratic, un predictable, and disorganized be havior?characteristics typical of the low pole of C. Why did we not find separate C factors in any other species? The failure to include rele vant items cannot explain this find ing: In our own studies of dogs and cats, we included items that define C in humans, but they did not form a separate factor. Considering the "superego" aspects of the C factor (following norms and rules, think ing before acting, and other com plex cognitive functions involved in the control of impulses), it may not be surprising that we found a separate C factor only in humans and in humans' closest relatives, chimpanzees. These findings sug gest C may have appeared relative ly recently in the evolution of Homininae, the subfamily com prising humans, chimpanzees, and gorillas. Dominance and Activity: Two Additional Dimensions? Dominance emerged as a clear separate factor in 7 of the 19 stud ies. Although interpreted as Confidence in rhesus monkeys and Assertiveness in hyenas, the factor was essentially the same, correlating substantially with dominance rank.5 Across studies, the Dominance factor was typical ly defined by assertiveness or boldness (high E), physical aggres sion (low A), and low fearfulness (low N). Thus, dominance had more diverse personality implica tions in animals than in humans, for whom it is related only to the E dimension. Perhaps these differ ences arise because humans partic ipate in multiple dominance hier archies that are less clearly defined and involve widely divergent skills: The class bullies may domi nate in the school yard, but the conscientious students will get the grades to advance academically, and the open-minded artists will win prizes for their creations. Future research needs to examine more closely the links between dominance rank and personality traits. Personality may vary even among animals of the same rank, and rather than being viewed as a personality trait, dominance rank may be better conceived as a social outcome determined by both per sonality and physical traits (Buss, 1988). Finally, our review uncovered scant evidence for the idea that Activity should be retained as a separate dimension of animal per sonality, with only 2 of the 19 stud ies showing support. Of the 3 chimpanzee studies, only the study of infants identified a separate Activity factor. This age difference in chimpanzees parallels findings in humans suggesting that Activity may not become integrated with the E dimension until late adoles cence (John et al, 1994). THE SPECTER OF ANTHROPOMORPHISM A number of the studies summa rized in Table 2 relied on human observers rating animals on trait adjectives defined in brief behav ioral terms (e.g., playful was de fined as "initiates play and joins in when play is solicited"). Although some researchers argue that ob server ratings are the best way to assess personality, others are skep tical and worry that these ratings might be anthropomorphic projec tions. Three kinds of evidence Copyright ? 1999 American Psychological Society argue against this concern. First, for a wide range of species, includ ing chimpanzees, rhesus monkeys, and hyenas, studies show that in dependent observers agree about the relative ordering of individuals on a trait. Second, many of the studies reviewed here used behav ioral tests in specific situations or carefully recorded ethological ob servations. Both types of data yielded similar factors. For exam ple, when piglet behavior was test ed in specific situations, the E fac tor was defined by number of vocalizations, number of nose con tacts, and location in the pen; when chimpanzee behavior was ob served in naturally occurring set tings, the E factor was defined by behavior patterns such as "pull limb" (playful social contact), "grasp and poke" (boisterous but relaxed contact), and "gymnastics" (exuberant locomotory play, such as swinging, dangling, turning somersaults). It is remarkable that such similar factors were discov ered using such diverse methods. In fact, studies using multiple methods have demonstrated the validity of trait ratings (Capitanio, 1999). Third, our finding that the factor structures showed meaning ful differences across species ar gues against the operation of gen eral rating biases in observers. For example, in our own work, we found the familiar FFM dimensions for humans but only four factors for dogs, even when we collected personality ratings using the same instrument for both species; the items defining a clear C factor in humans failed to form a separate factor in dogs (Gosling &amp; John, 1998). These differences show that personality structure depends on the individual rated, rather than on the particular items in the rating instrument. Sex differences are another do main where cross-species differ ences in the meaning and implica tions of personality factors can be</page><page sequence="4">72 VOLUME 8, NUMBER 3, JUNE 1999 -o CD c o "O CD CD DO ^ 03^^ DJO CT) "O .EC ?5 S?

Research on the human FFM has repeatedly shown that women tend to be more emotional and prone to worry (i.e., higher on N) than men (Costa &amp; McCrae, 1992). Does the same sex differ ence emerge in other species? Not necessarily. To illustrate this point, we collected observer ratings of humans using items previously used in a study of hyenas (Gosling, 1998). In humans, women were described as some what higher on N than men; in hyenas, the sex difference was re versed, with males being consider ably more high-strung, fearful, and nervous than females (see Fig. 1). What explains this dramatic in teraction effect? The key is the dif ference in social organization: In the hyena clan, dominance rank is transmitted through a matrilineal system, and females are larger than males and more dominant. This example suggests that sex dif ferences in personality may be re lated to the ecological niches occu pied by the two sexes in a species, and illustrates how a comparative approach can offer a fresh perspec tive on the interplay between so cial and biological factors in personality. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS The cartographic metaphor serves to highlight some limita tions of the initial map of animal personality dimensions presented in Table 2. First, Antarctica will be discovered only if one sails south: The lack of evidence for a dimen sion does not necessarily prove the factor does not exist; studies may not have included the items rele vant for the factor. To show that a dimension does not exist in a species requires that future re searchers actively search for that dimension.

For ex ample, we may hypothesize that solitary species (e.g., orangutans) would not show a separate A di mension, or that O occurs only in species that depend on a great va riety of food sources. Second, just as early maps look rough by today's standards, with missing land masses and poorly defined boundaries, we expect that future researchers will refine our rough initial sketch and discover new is lands, perhaps even continents. Third, much work remains to be done on the internal geography of the continents. For example, a great many species appear to in habit the curiosity area of the O continent, but other areas may be inhabited solely by humans and perhaps chimpanzees. Fourth, re searchers need to move from map ping personality continents to for mulating theories about the movements of tectonic plates, ad dressing how and why the conti nents emerged; animal models of personality may be uniquely suited to identify genes for complex traits and to study how these genes work (i.e., functional genomics). Finally, the early sailors knew their maps were not perfect, but imperfect maps were better than no map at all; it is in this spirit that we offer the present classification of animal personality, hoping that future re searchers may find this initial sketch helpful in their quest for new discoveries.

A number of factor analytic stud ies did not sample personality traits broadly but focused on a single trait. The numerous studies of emotional ity in mice are an example of this approach. 3. There were a number of compli cations due to differences in the way factor analytic procedures are used and reported in this literature (e.g., some studies did not rotate factors; others did not report factor loadings), but we cannot discuss these complications in the space available here. Only a small number of animal factors could not be classified; most of these factors would not be considered part of personality (e.g., physical coordination in chim panzees and indoor vs. outdoor suit ability in dogs). 4. Although four studies yielded two separate factors related to A, these findings may reflect methodological ar tifacts. For example, in Wilsson and Sundgren's (1997) study of dogs, sepa rate Affability (high A) and Aggression (low A) factors were found, but Affability was defined by only one item. In Gosling's (1998) study of hye nas, the two dimensions related to A (Human-Related Agreeableness and Sociability) were positively related. 5. Unlike all the other species re viewed, octopuses are clearly solitary (rather than social) and thus cannot ex hibit dominance rank. References Bard, K.A., &amp; Gardner, K.H. (1996).
