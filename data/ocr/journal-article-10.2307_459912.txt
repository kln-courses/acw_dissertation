<plain_text><page sequence="1">HAWTHORNE AND THE CONCEPT OF SYMPATHY BY ROY R. MALE, JR. SOME OF THE MOST fruitful modern Hawthorne criticism is that which endeavors to correct and supplement the older, somewhat dis- torted picture of a solitary Puritan anachronism living in an "owl's nest" by recognizing Hawthorne's immediate connection with the fundamental issues of his own day.' What Hawthorne owed to his immediate pred- ecessors and contemporaries cannot be adequately evaluated in terms of "influence" or parallel passages. A more rewarding approach to the problem would be to examine part of the climate of opinion in Haw- thorne's time in connection with a detailed study of his work. The present paper, intended to be suggestive rather than definitive, is an attempt to reveal some of the possibilities of this approach. As Carl Becker once suggested, "If we would discover the little back- stairs door that for any age serves as the secret entranceway to knowl- edge, we will do well to look for certain unobtrusive words with un- certain meanings that are permitted to slip off the tongue or the pen without fear and without research."2 One such significant word for Romanticism in general and for Hawthorne in particular was sympathy. Henry James observed that Hawthorne had an "extreme predilection for a small number of vague ideas which are represented by such terms as 'sphere' and 'sympathies'." Most modern readers will doubtless agree with James that Hawthorne made "too liberal a use of these two sub- stantives."3 Yet I think we should qualify this stricture by recognizing that the ideas lurking behind the Romanticists' watchword sympathy were neither small in number nor always vague in conception, and I am convinced that a much longer, more detailed study would confirm what is here tentatively proposed-that these ideas formed an essential basis of Hawthorne's art, affecting his aesthetic theory, his use of setting, his symbolism, and a small but notable group of his characters. One who studies the historical meaning of sympathy is struck by the wide variety of contexts in which the word is significant: ancient, medieval, and Renaissance medical books, eighteenth-century ethical treatises, physiognomical pamphlets, and gushingly sentimental verse in popular periodicals. Sympathy had long been a popular and ambiguous word, as the English moralist Abraham Tucker indicated in his chapter 1 See Randall Stewart, Nathaniel Hawthorne, A Biography (New Haven, 1948); F. O. Matthiessen, American Renaissance (New York, 1941), p. 192; and Richard H. Fogle, "The World and the Artist: A Study of Hawthorne's 'The Artist of the Beautiful'," Tulane Stud. in Eng., I (1949), 31-52. Fogle shows that in this story Hawthorne "expounds the fundamental ethic, metaphysic, psychology, and aesthetic of English Romanticism." 2 The Heavenly City of the Eighteenth-Century Philosophers (New Haven, 1932), p. 47. 3Hawthorne (New York, 1880), pp. 119-120. 138</page><page sequence="2">Roy R. Male, Jr. on the subject in The Light of Nature Revealed (1765). Here Tucker summarized three common meanings of sympathy: a primitive medical theory, stemming from Paracelsus and popularized by Sir Kenelm Digby, which proceeded from the assumption of a universal connection between all things, basing its alchemical remedies upon supposed cor- respondences between the injured member and the cure; the equally ancient notion of magic communication between kindred individuals by means of what Tucker called "cognate effluvia"; and an ethical principle emphasized in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in reaction to Hobbes' selfish system, popularized by numerous delicate works on "the handkerchiefly feeling," and given an acute psychological analysis by David Hume in his Treatise of Human Nature (1739) and by Adam Smith in his Theory of Moral Sentiments (1759).4 These three time-honored ideas concerning sympathy were re- emphasized and reshaped during the latter half of the eighteenth century when the shift in taste and critical temper which we now call Romanti- cism5 occurred. The significance which sympathy took on during this period seems to have stemmed mainly from two important and inter- dependent developments: the striking discoveries in electricity and magnetism, and the revived conception of the universe as organic. As Coleridge pointed out in his lecture to a London audience in 1819, the discovery of electricity was a crucial factor in the Romantic challenge to the mathematical, mechanical world-view: "From the time of Kepler to Newton, and from that to Hartley, not only all things in external nature, but the subtlest mysteries of life and organization, even of the intellect and moral being, were conjured within the magic circle of mathematical formality. But now a light was struck by the discovery of electricity, and in every sense of the word... it may be affirmed to have electrified the whole form of natural philosophy."6 The age-old 4 The medical theory is discussed in the anonymous Die sympathetisch-magnetische Heilkunde in ihrem ganzen Umfange (Stuttgart, 1851). An interesting physiognomical treatise is Les Sympathies, ou L'Art de Juger, par les traits du Visage, des Convenances en Amour et en Amitie (Paris, 1813). A fuller background on the ethical theory will be found in my article, "Shelley and the Doctrine of Sympathy," Univ. of Texas Stud. in Eng., xxix (1950), 183-203. Hawthorne was probably familiar with Adam Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiments since it was one of the books charged out to Mary Manning in 1827. See Marion L. Kesselring, "Hawthorne's Reading, 1828-1850," Bull. of the N. Y. Public Library (1949), p. 18. 5 "Romanticism" in this article is defined in the terms used by Arthur O. Lovejoy, The Great Chain of Being (Cambridge, 1936), Ch. x, and by Morse Peckham, "Towards a Theory of Romanticism," PMLA, LxvI (March 1951), 5-23. 6 The Philosophical Lectures of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ed. Kathleen Coburn (New York, 1949), p. 342. See also Hints Towards... a Theory of Life, ed. Seth B. Watson (Philadelphia, 1848), pp. 28-32. Further evidence that the discoveries in electricity were crucial in breaking down the mathematical world-view may be found in John Abernethy, 139</page><page sequence="3">Hawthorne and the Concept of Sympathy question of the secret of life became again acute as the physiological doctrines advanced by the Scotsman John Brown and the Swiss German Albrecht von Haller seemed to culminate in Galvani's observation of the twitching frog's legs. After Brown and Haller had theoretically reduced the manifold complications of animation to the irritability of muscles and the sensibility of nerves, the conflict between mechanism and vitalism took on an impassioned fervor, revolving around such concepts as "nerv- ous fluid," "vital force," and "principle of life." Thus when Galvani in 1786 successfully brought about artificial movements in dead organic matter, there were some who believed that the basic principle of life was close to revelation, that the gap between animate and inanimate, mind and matter, could be bridged. Sympathy, a word which had long been used as a synonym for magnetic attraction, found added currency in that it expressed not only "feeling" (i.e., life) but also "feeling with" (i.e., homogeneity). As a result of this new emphasis on an organic world-view, we find impetus being given to a kind of double projection of man into nature and nature into man. "Man is a true Narcissus," wrote Goethe in his novel Elective Affinities (1809); "he delights to see his own image every- where; he spreads himself underneath the universe like the amalgam behind the glass." Poe, in later expressing the same idea, pointed to the significance of electricity for the organic theory of nature: "To elec- tricity we may not be wrong in referring the various physical appearances of light, heat, and magnetism; but far less shall we be liable to err in attributing to this strictly spiritual principle the more important phenom- ena of vitality, consciousness, and thought."7 In this Romantic anthropomorphism "mortal sympathies" become synonymous with "symbolizings," as they did for Melville in the chapter on "The White- ness of the Whale" in Moby Dick. Thus the fallacy which Ruskin called pathetic might more aptly be called sympathetic. On the other hand, the workings of an organic universe provided a clue to the mysteries of mental and nervous phenomena; the laws of chemical affinity and electro- magnetic attraction and repulsion found parallels in "human sympathies and antipathies," the neuroses and psychoses which were later systemat- ically analyzed by Freud and his followers. Hawthorne's preoccupation with the significance of sympathy is usually explained by critics as resulting from his "cursed habits of solitude," and there is certainly ample evidence to support this view. Lectures on Anatomy, Surgery, and Pathology (Boston, 1828), I, vii. Historians of German Romanticism have, of course, long recognized the significance of these discoveries. See particularly Alexander Gode-von Aesch, Natural Science in German Romanticism (New York, 1941), pp. 186-203. 7 "Eureka," in The Complete Works of Edgar Allan Poe (Chicago, 1894), ix, 34. 140</page><page sequence="4">Roy R. Male, Jr. Yet, as Randall Stewart has shown, Hawthorne was not quite the re- cluse his early biographers made him out to be, and his personal concern with "the guiding light of sympathy" was amplified and crystallized by the ideas which had also affected, in varying degrees, the German and English Romanticists in "the days when the comparatively recent dis- covery of electricity and other kindred mysteries of Nature seemed to open paths into the region of miracle" (II, 47).8 The impact of discoveries in electricity upon a sensitive mind is perhaps best stated by semi- hysterical Clifford Pyncheon in The House of Seven Gables: "Then there is electricity,-the demon, the angel, the mighty physical power, the all-pervading intelligence! ... Is it a fact-or have I dreamt it-that by means of electricity, the world of matter has become a great nerve? . . . Rather the round globe is a vast head, a brain instinct with in- telligence" (III, 313). Clifford, in his grandiose claims for electricity, is not, of course, to be taken as the author's mouthpiece; he does express, however, a fundamental belief in the universe as a coherent, living unit which may be taken as representative of Hawthorne. This conviction is manifested, first of all, in the organic theory of art which is elaborated and dramatized in "Drowne's Wooden Image," "The Artist of the Beautiful," "The Great Stone Face," "The Snow- Image," "The Prophetic Pictures," and The Marble Faun. The Cole- ridgean distinction between mechanical and organic is of primary im- portance in "The Artist of the Beautiful," as well as in the discussion of Hilda's copying of art in The Marble Faun.9 The same aesthetic theory is perhaps even more explicit in the story of the New England Pygmalion, "Drowne's Wooden Image." Coleridge, following Schlegel, had main- tained that "the organic form is innate; it shapes as it develops itself from within, and the fullness of its development is one and the same with the perfection of its outward form." Creation of this organic form is the mark of "true genius" as opposed to the mechanical product of the mere understanding.10 Drowne, ordinarily a "mechanical carver in wood," is inspired on one occasion by "the divine, the life-giving touch." To the query of Copley, the artist, about the creator of the half-finished female figure, Drowne replies that it is "'No man's work. The figure lies within that block of oak, and it is my business to find it'." This reply, taken in conjunction with Drowne's artistry, convinces Copley that the woodcarver is "the very spirit of genius . . .entitled to tran- scend all rules" (II, 353-355).

Raysor (Cambridge, 1930), I, 224. 141</page><page sequence="5">Hawthorne and the Concept of Sympathy this one occasion is the same "divine sympathy" which "illuminated the mountain visage" of the Great Stone Face and "etherealized its ponder- ous granite substance into spirit" (III, 430); it is the same "guiding light of sympathy" which enables Hilda to grasp the unifying life of great paintings (vI, 74). Another and perhaps the most obvious consequence of this organicism for Hawthorne was that it usually determined the setting of his fiction. Like Emerson, who found that "the greatest delight which the fields and woods minister is the suggestion of an occult relation between man and vegetable," Hawthorne observed that "an orchard has a relation to mankind, and readily connects itself with matters of the human heart" (Ii, 21). As a result, like the painter of "The Prophetic Pictures," Haw- thorne seldom had the "impulse to copy natural scenery, except as a framework for the delineations of the human form or face, instinct with thought, passion, or suffering" (I, 205). The gloom cast by Phoebe's departure is matched by an easterly storm which frustrates Hepzibah's attempts to build a heartwarming fire in the House of the Seven Gables; Kenyon's dreary spirit, downcast over Hilda's disappearance, finds a fitting counterpart in the ruins of Rome; darkness and light subtly match the moods of Hester and Dimmesdale: "All at once, as with a sudden smile of heaven, forth burst the sunshine pouring a very flood into the obscure forest.... Such was the sympathy of Nature . . . with the bliss of these two spirits" (v, 243). Readers of Shakespeare and Milton will recognize that this matching of emotional and natural atmosphere is, of course, by no means peculiar to Hawthorne. But the technique assumes more significance in his work than in Irving's, for example, because it is so clearly a facet of Hawthorne's belief in the living unity of nature. Hawthorne's assumption of organicism was also inextricably bound up with his bent for symbolism. Indelibly impressed by Spenser, Bunyan, and Cotton Mather, familiar with the search for ethico-scientific analo- gies in eighteenth-century moral treatises, Hawthorne lived in an age of which Emerson was the spokesman when he said, "Nature is the symbol of spirit .... The axioms of physics translate the laws of ethics." It was an age which embraced phrenology, physiognomy, animal mag- netism, homeopathy, and Perkinism as fads-all of which derived most of their fascination from correspondences or "sympathies" between matter and spirit and from the prestige of electromagnetism or "sym- pathy."" Beneath the superficiality of such popular excesses, Hawthorne n Elizabeth R. Hosmer has shown the extent of Hawthorne's exposure to these fads in her unpublished Univ. of Illinois dissertation, "Science and Pseudo-Science in the Writings of Nathaniel Hawthorne" (1948). Hawthorne habitually treated sympathy and magnetism as synonyms. See Works, m, 209. 142</page><page sequence="6">Roy R. Male, Jr. shared with such fellow-Romanticists as Melville and Shelley the con- viction that the deep truth concerning the mystery of life is as complex and ungraspable as the universe itself; yet by reason of its very com- plexity it is best grasped through image and symbol. As a result, accord- ing to Hawthorne, it is the artist's aim never to "separate the idea from the symbol in which it manifests itself" (xII, 67). Not only the method of symbolism but also some of the symbols themselves were affected by Hawthorne's predilection for sympathy. Part of his symbolism concerns the interdependence of all creatures, which is, of course, a major theme in all his work, the inevitable con- comitant of his penetrating analysis of isolation. He objectified the "sympathetic bond," as he objectified the inner world of heart and mind, by various projected symbols. Some of these symbols, to be sure, are self-evident and need no further discussion: the fireside circle, the scarlet letter which enables Hester to feel an "electric throb" with her more hypocritical fellow-sinners; the black veil which gives the Reverend Mr. Hooper a similar "sixth sense"; the too-mysterious ears which indicate Donatello's link with "the inferior tribes of being." Other symbols of sympathy are not so readily apparent and may profitably be examined for their significance in the total body of Hawthorne's work. Just as the heart is frequently objectified by a dwelling-place,12 so the heart's connection with humanity is often symbolized by the means of entrance to the dwelling. Ethan Brand in his isolation lacked "the key of holy sympathy," which could have opened the "chambers or the dungeons of our common nature"; the isolation of the narrator in "Monsieur du Miroir" is emphasized as he sits alone in his chamber- "the key turned and withdrawn from the lock, the keyhole stuffed with paper to keep out a peevish blast of wind" (II, 188). Similarly, the little shop-bell in The House of Seven Gables serves as the connection between the isolated Hepzibah and the stream of life outside. Shattering her introspective routine, "the little bell played the very deuce with Hepzi- bah's nerves"; "the old gentlewoman's heart seemed to be attached to the same steel spring, for it went through a series of sharp jerks in unison with the sound" (iii, 73, 68). To the equally isolated Clifford the bell also rings with "a hateful clamor," signifying his "shivering repugnance at the idea of personal contact with the world." It tinkles merrily for Phoebe, however, whose place "was good in the whole sympathetic chain of human nature." Thus commerce has its enlivening as well as its evil side; Hepzibah's first bit of income from the shop, a schoolboy's copper coin, is a kind of talisman, a circlet showing her new connection with 12 See John W. Shroeder, " 'That Inward Sphere': Notes on Hawthorne's Heart Imagery and Symbolism," PMLA, LXV (March 1950), 106-119. 143</page><page sequence="7">Hawthorne and the Concept of Sympathy life. "It was as potent, and perhaps endowed with the same kind of ef- ficacy, as a galvanic ring" (III, 71). Hawthorne's fondness for bell-imagery was associated with his interest in the "real principles of union" during the procession of life. The steeple- bell peals for all humanity; it sounds the alarm, marks general festivity, reminds businessmen of their affairs, suggests to a soldier thoughts of religion and "home-tenderness," keeps time for mothers in child-birth, and tolls a requiem for all alike. Its chief function, therefore, is to serve human interests; it symbolizes the same warm, earthy sympathy as the fireside circle. Thus it is quite fitting that Owen Warland, having temporarily ceased his individual quest for ideal, living beauty, should be called upon to regulate the clock in the church steeple. He has sac- rificed his individuality, but in fixing the steeple clock he momentarily grasps the magnetic chain of humanity: "the merchants gruffly acknowl- edged his merits on 'Change; the nurse whispered his praises as she gave the potion in the sick-chamber; the lover blessed him at the hour of appointed interview . . " (II, 513). A somewhat more specialized symbol of sympathy is the needle. "There is something extremely pleasant ... in this peculiarity of needle- work," wrote Hawthorne in The Marble Faun. "The slender thread of silk or cotton keeps them [women] united with the small, familiar, gentle interests of life, the continually operating influences of which do so much for the health of the character, and carry off what would otherwise be a dangerous accumulation of morbid sensibility. A vast deal of human sympathy runs along this electric line, stretching from the throne to the wicker chair of the humblest seamstress, and keeping high and low in a species of communion with their kindred beings" (vi, 55-56). Miriam's sewing, as well as the imaginative sympathy of her sketches, prefigures a life filled richly with the "bliss and suffering of womanhood"; the solitary Hepzibah Pyncheon, on the other hand, has fingers "at once inflexible and delicate" which prevent her from being a seamstress. Similarly, it is in the chapter of The Scarlet Letter entitled "Hester at Her Needle" that we learn that "Hester Prynne came to have a part to perform in the world." Her intercourse with society was limited, how- ever, since the "new sense" which she developed gave her only "sym- pathetic knowledge of the hidden sin in other hearts," rather than any well-rounded companionship. Again we notice that each concrete object in "The Artist of the Beautiful" is carefully chosen. Annie Hovenden comes to the artist equipped with the symbols of her position in the warm fireside circle of humanity-thimble and needle. As he glances at the damaged thimble, Owen seizes eagerly upon the idea that this girl, who is perceptive enough to grasp his aim of "putting spirit into machinery," might be able to offer him companionship in his lonely toil. But her 144</page><page sequence="8">Roy R. Male, Jr. warm, earthy sympathy is irreconcilable with his quest for the ideal; it takes but a touch from the point of her needle to destroy his project.l3 Since Hawthorne's mirror images, the most pervasive and complex of his symbols of sympathy, have already been discussed at some length by Matthiessen and Malcolm Cowley, they need not receive detailed analysis here. Yet we should note that the mirror imagery leads to a crux in Hawthorne criticism. It cannot very well be discussed apart from the other psycho-physical parallels which characterize his work: the resemblance between Sylph Etherege's face and the face in the miniature, the likeness between Ernest and The Great Stone Face, the incest and Doppelganger themes in "Alice Doane's Appeal," "Howe's Masquerade," "My Kinsman, Major Molineaux," and The Marble Faun. The customary explanation of these constantly-recurring "sympathies" is most cogently stated by Cowley, who finds their source in Hawthorne's "private character." "In Hawthorne's life as well as in his stories there are curious suggestions of the Narcissus legend . . . Mr. Bullfrog's pre- dicament is like the one in which Hawthorne involved himself during the Salem years when he had no other companions: in a sense he did marry his own image. Many of his tales read like confessions of a self- love that was physical as well as moral." Roderick Elliston, the Reverend Mr. Hooper, Gervayse Hastings, Arthur Dimmesdale-all, in a sense, are Hawthorne confessing his guilty narcissism.14 There is, of course, a certain amount of truth in this explanation, but to me it seems one-sided, since it tends to reduce Hawthorne the artist to a Rousseau-like confessionist and treats his work as though he wrote in a vacuum. We recognize the impact of Newtonian science in Pope and Thomson, we discuss Darwinism in Hardy and Browning, we see Freudian influence in Eugene O'Neill; but for some curious reason we consistently miss the broad and rather obvious influence of science upon English and American Romanticism. Hawthorne, after all, lived in an age when interest in the phenomena of attraction and repulsion had been stimulated by the discoveries of Bergmann, Galvani, and Volta; when psycho-physics was being developed as a science by Weber, Lotze, and Fechner; when the English psychologists, admitting that "introspection is still our main resort-the Alpha and Omega of psycho- logical inquiry,"'5 were constantly using mirror imagery to express the relation between matter and spirit.16 From the general interest in attrac- 1' This is the exact converse of the situation in "The Birthmark," where Aylmer's quest for the ideal destroys Georgiana. 14 "Hawthorne in the Looking-Glass," Sewanee Rev., LVI (Autumn 1948), 545-563. 16 Alexander Bain, quoted in Rudolph Merz, A History of European Thought in the Nineteenth Century (London, 1928), nr, 527. 16 Even so apparently inconsequential a piece as "Feathertop," for instance, takes on significance in the light of the Coleridgean antithesis between mechanical and organic. 145</page><page sequence="9">Hawthorne and the Concept of Sympathy tion sprang the preoccupation with the theme of incest between brother and sister which may be found in Goethe, Grillparzer, Kotzebue, Lessing, Melville, Poe, Schiller, Shelley, Tieck, and others. Here, for instance, is Poe's interpretation of the Newtonian law: "let the reader pause with me ... in contemplation of the miraculous complexity of relation in- volved in the fact that each atom attracts every other atom.... What is it that we are actually called upon to comprehend? That each atom attracts-sympathizes with the most delicate movements of every other atom, and with each and all at the same time .... Does not so evident a brotherhood among the atoms point to a common parentage? Does not a sympathy so omniprevalent ... suggest a common paternity as its source?"'7 Or as Emerson put it: "Has the naturalist or chemist learned his craft who has explored the gravity of atoms and the elective affinities, who has not yet discerned the deeper law whereof this is only a partial or approximate statement, namely that like draws to like?"'8 Clearly the ancient notions concerning lovers, or "twin children, twins of fate, who have lived, enjoyed, suffered, and died in unison, each faithfully re- peating the last tremor of the other's breath, though separated by vast tracts of land" (II, 184), were revived by the new interest in chemical and electromagnetic attraction and found literary expression in the brother-sister theme. To put it a little differently, the inferences of kin- ship and the shimmering mirrors in Hawthorne's tales are a part of the Romantic endeavor to find a world-view in which all life could be recog- nized as essentially homogeneous. But, it may be objected, the psycho-physical analogy has broken down here; in magnetism, like poles do not attract; they repel. Exactly-and the plot involving an exact double, named the Doppelganger theme by Jean Paul Richter and used by Goethe, Grillparzer, Hoffman, Poe, and Tieck, as well as by Hawthorne, dramatizes this repulsion. Though the ultimate meaning of tales involving the repulsive double varies, the initial situation, like that of the brother-sister motif, seems to have been suggested by physical science. "Howe's Masquerade," "Alice Doane's Appeal," and "My Kinsman, Major Molineaux" express the same "How terrible should be the thought, that the nude woman whom the modern artist patches together, bit by bit, from a dozen heterogeneous models, meaning nothing by her, shall last as long as the Venus of the Capitol!" wrote Hawthorne in The Marble Faun. It is the product of such a false Pygmalion (in this case a witch) which is dramatized in "Feather- top." Mother Rigby has made many a "puppet" before out of "clay, wax, straw, sticks"; on this occasion she uses equally heterogeneous materials. Coleridge had stated that the truly organic form had "its true image reflected and thrown out from the concave mirror." It is a mirror which betrays Feathertop's mechanical composition; he gazes in the full length looking-glass and beholds "the sordid patchwork of his real composition." 17 "Eureka," Works, ix, 39. 18 "Circles," in The Complete Works of Ralph Waldo Emerson (Boston, 1904), ii, 314. 146</page><page sequence="10">Roy R. Male, Jr. situation which led Oliver Wendell Holmes later to observe that "Rela- tions are very apt to hate one another just because they are too much alike.... The centrifugal principle which grows out of the antipathy of like to like is only the repetition in character of the arrangement we see expressed materially."19 I would suggest, in short, that the anticipa- tions of modern depth psychology apparent in Hawthorne's work result in part from his following the tendencies of his own time in translating the ambiguous mysteries of attraction and repulsion into the human sphere. Starting with such apparently inconsequential notes as "Two little boats of cork, with a magnet in one and steel in the other" (ix, 210), he probed into the "deeper psychology," into the borderland of the un- conscious. Like Oliver Wendell Holmes, he felt that "there are unex- plained facts in the region of sympathies and antipathies which will repay study with a deeper insight into the mysteries of life than we have dreamed of hitherto."20 Specifically illustrating that the history of the idea of sympathy stretches from Paracelsus to Freud are Hawthorne's peculiar scientists. Aylmer, Dr. Heidegger, Dr. Rappaccini, and Roger Chillingworth look both backward and forward. They are, on the one hand, products of the same era which produced a Faust renaissance in New England, an era in which the mysterious life-giving qualities of electricity called up visions of Paracelsus, Albertus Magnus, Cornelius Agrippa, and Sir Kenelm Digby, as well as of New England witchcraft. "Who does not look with astonishment upon the mock creative and life-giving energy which electricity displays?" asked George Brewster in 1843. "Had some chemist made an exhibition like this in the dark ages without explana- tion, or even in the days of Salem witchcraft, it would have rung through- out the country that he had made a league with the evil one.... ."21 Chillingworth, we are told, is a student of Paracelsus and a colleague of Sir Kenelm Digby; he is cognizant of all the ancient lore which underlay the therapeutic powders of sympathy. But in seeking the secret of Dimmesdale's "strange sympathy betwixt soul and body," the leech anticipates the technique of modern psychiatry. Apart from his morbid motive, he is quite in keeping with current practice: So Roger Chillingworth ... strove to go deep into his patient's bosom, delving among his principles, prying into his recollections, and probing everything with a cautious touch, like a treasure-seeker in a dark cavern. Few secrets can escape an investigator, who has opportunity and license to undertake such a quest, and skill to follow it up....

(v, 152-153) To this passage we may subjoin another from "The Birthmark" to show how definitely Hawthorne and other Romanticists were shaping the way for Freud's systematic study of the Unconscious: "Truth often finds its way to the mind close muffled in robes of sleep, and then speaks with uncompromising directness of matters in regard to which we practise an unconscious self-deception during our waking moments" (II, 52). It is one of the ironies of intellectual history that the very writers who were most affected by the theory of sympathy and contributed notably to our knowledge of depth psychology are those most often singled out in our own time for Freudian interpretations. Thus to at least one writer The Scarlet Letter is a dramatization of Hawthorne's own Oedipus complex.22 So far we have been interested in seeing what Hawthorne did with certain ideas and attitudes which were lumped under the term sympathy in his time. It is equally revealing, however, to notice what he rejected- not only the tearful benevolence which made "sympathy" a shibboleth for many of his feminine contemporaries but also the idea that imagina- tive sympathy had moral value. Adam Smith, William Hazlitt, many of the lesser Scotch moralists, and particularly Shelley had upheld ima- ginative sympathy as "the great secret of morals." "A man, to be greatly good," maintained Shelley, "must imagine intensely and comprehensively; he must put himself in the place of another and of many others; the pains and pleasures of his species must become his own." Emerson's note on sympathy in his Journals is in the same vein: Sympathy.-He whose sympathy goes lowest,-dread him, O kings!... See you a man who can find pleasures everywhere, in a camp, in a barn, in a school- house, in a stage-coach, in a bar-room, so that he needs no philosophy but drops into heaven wherever he goes, because of the great range of his affinities; who is an observer of boys and admires so much the strokes of nature they deal, that he feels himself their inferior while he watches them; who is an observer of girls and lacks countenance to speak to them, so warm is his interest in their well- being; who is so alive to every presence that the approbation of no porter, 22 0.

Male, Jr. groom, or child is quite indifferent to him, and a man of merit is an object of so much love as to be a fear to him-see you such a man, and is he a worshipper also of truth and of Virtue? Then mark him well, for the whole world converts itself into that man ... 23 Hawthorne would have none of this. He recognized such imaginative fellow-feeling as a requisite for an author, but he anticipated D. H. Lawrence's criticism of Whitman in pointing out the danger of losing one's identity in attempting to absorb the mass. Miles Coverdale has the imaginative ability to identify himself with others; he can look at old Moodie and "take his view of the world, as if looking through a smoke-blackened glass at the sun." But this process tends to make him a detached, colorless, and inhuman Paul Pry rather than one of Emer- son's moral paragons. In Hawthorne's experience the imagination seemed more often coolly speculative than warmly sympathetic; Holgrave, for instance, shares Coverdale's habits of prying into the inner lives of others. But what is most notable about this young man is that he has never lost his identity, despite his varied occupations. It is this integrity, typified by his resistance of the temptation to hypnotize Phoebe, which saves him and prepares the way for his eventual happy marriage. Perhaps at this point the reader feels that I have confused the mean- ings of sympathy even more than the Romanticists did. Yet rigid, logical discrimination of the various ideas connoted by the word seems futile, since they all stem from an organic theory of nature. Sympathy empha- sized man's link with man and with nature; served as a sort of intuitive and image-making "sixth sense" which was glorified above unimagina- tive sagacity; and functioned as a moral and psychological equivalent to gravitation, electromagnetic attraction, and chemical affinity. Seldom has one word been so admirably suited to the sensibilities of an age. And through examining the use which Hawthorne made of some of these ideas, we get a fragmentary picture at least of what Romanticism meant for his work. As is often pointed out, he did not share the optimism and reforming urge which infected the Transcendentalists; nor did he glorify the frail, sensitive creature who desperately needs sympathy, as Shelley did in Alastor. Hawthorne did, however, fully accept the basic assumption of Romanticism-a deeply-grounded belief in organicism, with its resultant emphasis upon symbolism, psycho-physical parallels, and the Unconscious. And in his artistic quest for the secret of life, he, like Coleridge, Shelley, and Melville, necessarily felt cut off from the great mass of humanity. Hence his search for "the key of holy sym- pathy." TEXAS TECHNOLOGICAL COLLEGE Lubbock 23 Works, v, 19-20. 149</page></plain_text>
