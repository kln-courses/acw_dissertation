<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CULTURE OF NATURE: NORTH AMERICAN LANDSCAPE FROM DISNEY TO THE EXXON VALDEZ, by Alexander Wilson, Cam- bridge, Mass.: Blackwell Publishers, 1992. 335 pages, illustrations, photo- graphs, plans, maps, index, $21.95, softbound. ISBN 1-55786-336-9 Reviewed by Richard L. Kent Alexander culturist, Wilson, journalist, horti- and culturist, journalist, and teacher, is a deep thinker and keen observer of the natural world and the place of humans in it. His insightful and engaging writing entices the reader to delve deeply, as he has, into the critical issues facing the North American landscape. Several themes are explored in this broad examina- tion of scenic routes, suburbs, movies, TV programs, world's fairs, theme parks, zoos, and nuclear power plants. The author provides revealing exam- ples of how people's attitudes to na- ture have changed, particularly during the last fifty years, and he discusses the dilemmas and implications of new ways of thinking. The popularity of hunting has waned. Awareness of the loss of species has turned from shooting animals with a gun to shooting them with a camera. Environmental edu- cation is now common in the public schools, where students are actively involved in recycling, restoration, and raising rather than dissecting live an- imals. A strong sense of regionalism infuses and strengthens the work of modernist landscape architects from coast to coast. In the last few decades, many new parks and reserves have been created to preserve important Books 77</page><page sequence="2">ecosystems and also culturally sig- nificant landscapes. Change is ever present and more rapid, with lines beginning to blur between natural and cultural history, city and country, conservation and development. Wilson is obviously intrigued by anthropomorphism, giving human qualities to nonhuman objects such as animals, rocks, and wind. He suggests that, since the advent of science, the exterior world has unfortunately been purged of its spirit. Now, in the mod- ern world, nature is normally consid- ered a field of objects to be managed for the public good. He sees anthro- pomorphism as a vehicle for breaking down the pervasive ideology of hu- manity versus nature. It can help humans to understand that the bar- rier between us and the natural world can be bridged. The need to form bridges or connections is one of Wilson's major concerns and most well-developed arguments. He sees the landscape as having been fragmented and concep- tually reorganized into discrete units: nature films depict humans as either destroyers or as saviors; land must be preserved or left to be totally devel- oped. There is no middle ground. Modern development is characterized as a tangle of bedroom communities, greenbelts, and high-tech parks, splintered by interstates designed for the greatest of all isolators - the automobile. However, Wilson argues, all is not yet lost. City and country can merge and become one. Cities can be made more natural with urban forests, wetlands, and, most impor- tant, food production. A sustainable agriculture is possible based on the old idea of small parcels of land and few inputs. Harmony and livelihood, not domination and profit, need to be our relationship with the natural world. The author lauds Tony Hiss's The Experience of Place ( 1 990) and his three forms of connectedness: kin- ship, partnership, and community- companionability. The connectedness that Hiss sees occurring through coalitions of bureaucrats, profession- als, environmentalists, and private landowners represents part of the "intermittent hopefulness" that Wilson's book portrays. An author for the Socialist Review, Wilson is decidedly left in his politics and strongly advocates social empow- erment. One does not have to be so- cialistic to share the writer's abhor- rence of the greed and exploitation in our industrial society. Wilson suggests that the domination of the earth can be halted through direct action deal- ing with the landscape. Humans need to build landscapes that heal, connect and empower, make intelligible rela- tions with the natural world and each other, and create meaningful places. The key, according to this young sage, is to imagine a future in which tech- nology, culture, and nature are fully integrated. When humans gain a real sense of how constructed and natural environments connect, they can act to restore nature and assure the natural world and themselves a desirable future. The Culture of Nature is a well- referenced work. The "Notes on Sources" includes leading landscape thinkers: J. B.Jackson, Ian McHarg, Lewis Mumford, F. W. Turner, and Robert Venturi. Each chapter has an extensive list of references, many of them Canadian. American and inter- national readers may find that these less well-known sources provide en- lightening points of view. Absence of any mention of the work of Steve and Rachel Kaplan, who have written extensively on the topic of humans and nature, was sur- prising. Their most recent book, The Exper√¨ence of Nature : A Psychological Perspective (1989), has the same intended audience as The Culture of Nature. Although the Kaplans' book is narrower in focus, Wilson might have found its discussion of the effect that the natural environment has on people germane to his musings on tourism, nature education, and city and country environments. Wilson's writing is admirable be- cause he does not "pull any punches." Rather, he states his opinions directly and emphatically. Denouncing the marriage of science and industry in promoting nuclear fission, he claims that technology "inhibits human free- dom, through and through." Mining he labels "destructive" and the chief symbol of "industrial society and its will to dominate." And to the U.S. military he awards the dubious honor of largest producer of hazardous wastes in the world. Not showing any favoritism to his adopted home, he calls Hydro-Quebec, developer of the James Bay Project, "ruthless" and the plans to move Great Lakes water southward "sinister." Although many readers are likely to sympathize with the author's sentiments, his criticisms are, at times, overly zealous. Wilson decries the fact that affluent Ontario, Can- ada's most populous province, obtains about half of its energy from nuclear power plants. Environmentally this is unfortunate, but how would the province cope with only half of the energy it now consumes? While it could do a better job at energy con- servation and produce energy in other ways, each available option would have environmental costs. Wilson avoids discussing potential solutions, which is a pity, because in doing so he could have displayed a greater will- ingness to develop his thesis. The author's claim that Disney World and all world's fairs displayed a "failure of imagination" surprised me. Wilson argues that they promote an ideology of growth and develop- ment, which is abhorrent to his politi- cal philosophy. But growth and devel- opment do not have to produce, as he suggests, "a future of hierarchy, con- tinued industrialization, enforced scarcity, and a ravished planet." This socialistic rhetoric surfaces now and again through this work and is likely to put off some readers who have faith in our capitalist system. If that does occur, it would be unfortunate because there is much environmental wisdom and sensitivity in these pages, and the writer's ideas are presented in a very readable manner. Overall, this well-crafted book makes a valu- able contribution to the literature of landscape and ecological criticism. Richard L.
