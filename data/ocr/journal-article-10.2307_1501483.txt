Primary Teacher Perspectives and Practices MICHAEL LITTLEDYKE, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester College of Higher Education ABSTRACT This article presents the results of a survey of primary managers and teachers to assess the relationships between experience, attitudes and practice in science and environmental education. Analysis, from a concerns theory perspective, shows that science, by virtue of its high National Curriculum status, has progressed to collaborative and refocusing concerns with substantial management support, whilst environmental education, in spite of perceived importance, remains at the status of personal concerns, due to insufficient pragmatic management support and pressure to cover National Curriculum subject content. Four broad groups of attitudes towards science and environmental education are identified which highlight the relationship between experi- ence, attitudes, practices and views of science and corresponding practices and attitudes relating to environmental issues and education. The significance of this to science and environmental education is discussed. Introduction and Background to the Research There has been considerable discussion, In recent years, concerning teachers' philosoph- ical assumptions about science (Nussbaum, 1989; Matthews, 1990; Koulaidis, 1995), and research studies into teachers' views on science have focused on their understanding of the nature of science and how this may influence classroom practice (Lederman &amp; Zeidler, 1987; Lantz &amp; Kass, 1987; Duschl &amp; Wright, 1989; Brickhouse, 1991; Burbules &amp; Linn, 1991; Lakin &amp; Wellington, 1994). There has been little research to date on teachers' views and practices of science in relation to environmental education, however. The link between application of science and environmental impact has been identified through analysis of its development in the modern era (Littledyke, 1996a). Thus, modern science has positivistic, mechanistic, deterministic and reductionist emphasis, which has had destructive influences environmentally through the development of damaging tech- nologies and objectified, exploitative attitudes towards the environment (Roszak, 1970; Sessions, 1974; Drengson, 1989; Naess, 1989; Fox, 1990; Orr, 1992). Criticisms of modern science have come from postmodemn perspectives (Harvey, 1989) as well as 0141-1926/97/050641-19 ? 1997 British Educational Research Association</page><page sequence="2">642 M. Littledyke from within science itself, including findings from quantum mechanics (Bohm, 1980; Capra, 1982; Davies, 1983), and the science of complexity (Prigogine &amp; Stengers, 1984; Kaufmann, 1992; Lewin, 1993; Waldrop, 1992), which includes chaos theory (Gleick, 1988). Griffin identifies revisionary postmodern science as a strand of postmodernism which both criticises modem science, and identifies features of the newly emerging scientific paradigm (Griffin, 1988). This proposes scientific knowledge as tentative and changing, based on probability rather than determinism, and concerned with dynamic processes of complex interaction rather than linear causal reductionism. In this way postmodern science proposes an ecological (Birch, 1988; Ferre, 1988) or 'organicist' (Griffin, 1988) paradigm which both provides a critical understanding of the limitations and destructiveness of modem science, as well as providing possible scientific models for achieving ecological sustainability. The need for teacher understanding of the nature of science for effective science teaching is generally accepted. There is also a need for an understanding of the relationship between science and environmental education which draws on science to support knowledge of the causes of environmental problems, as well as the complexity of ecological systems. Such knowledge is complex, interrelated and impinges on a number of disciplines. Thus, Gorodetsky &amp; Keiny define environmental cognition as 'conceptual development regarding the dimensions of complexity, dynamism, interaction and involvement in conjunction with socio-economic problems' (1995, p. 207). This has as its goal integrative thinking (Miller, 1981), which draws on meaningful approaches to science (McClelland 1982; Biddulph &amp; Osborne 1984; Gaskell, 1992; Watts &amp; Bentley, 1994) and the personalisation and politicisation of science (Hodson, 1994). In the context of the National Curriculum, the high status of science within a technological society (Department of Education and Science [DES], 1985) has influenced the inclusion of science as a core subject in the National Curriculum. This has elevated science's status and given impetus to science development in primary schools. Assessments of the implementation of the National Curriculum (Lawton &amp; Chitty, 1988; Brighouse &amp; Moon, 1990; Coulby &amp; Ward, 1990; Moon, 1990; Chitty, 1991; Riley, 1992; O'Hear &amp; White, 1993; Taylor &amp; Tytler, 1993), however, point to its prescriptive nature, which 'lays great emphasis on knowledge and understanding' (White, 1993, p. 10), and there has been a clear shift in dominant educational ideology toward a more knowledge-based, objectives and assessment led, instrumental and revisionist emphasis (Littledyke, 1996b). Research and evaluations of the development of National Curricu- lum primary science (Wragg et al., 1989; Carr6 &amp; Carter, 1990, 1993; Pennell &amp; Alexander, 1990; Bennett et al., 1991; Jennings, 1992; Littledyke, 1994; Russell et al., 1994; Smith, 1994; Summers, 1994) indicate that the amount of science taught has increased and teacher confidence and ability to teach science has improved, but there are still problems of teacher science expertise and understanding of the nature of science. Thus, pressures of covering the extensive National Curriculum content (Silcock, 1992) and limited science understanding have influenced the way science is taught and can drive teachers to instrumental teaching methods with poor process and investigatory science development (Littledyke, 1994, 1996b). Against this background there are key factors which may mediate against effective environmental education within the National Curriculum. * Environmental education, as a cross-curricular theme and without a clear subject status, may be squeezed out by the demands of the extensive knowledge-centred and assessment-driven content of core science and other subjects. Also, many of the</page><page sequence="3">Science and Environmental Education 643 critical and issue-based aspects relating to the environment have been located within National Curriculum geography, leaving science as concerned with scientific concept and process development, but ostensibly value free. The teaching of science is influenced by ideas about the nature of science and knowledge (Harlen, 1992). Furthermore, teachers' restricted understanding of science may perpetuate the environmentally inappropriate values of modem science. Lack of understanding of the nature and history of science is problematic (Lakin &amp; Welling- ton, 1994) and this can be compounded by positivist ideas (Clayden et al., 1994). Thus, modem science within a fragmented school curriculum reflects values which are alienated from nature and can perpetuate attitudes which are environmentally damaging (Eagan &amp; Orr, 1992; Gaskell, 1992). The research findings presented in this article are part of a programme which derives from this analysis. The programme is designed to investigate ways in which science education can be supportive of environmental education in the context of the primary National Curriculum. The survey presented here is designed to assess how teachers perceive and practise science and environmental education, and to assess how attitudes and practices within the two areas influence one another. This is a preliminary stage in the research programme, which also includes elicitation of children's attitudes and ideas through interviews and questionnaires. Further research stages draw on these findings to develop action research cycles to evaluate ways of teaching science so as to provide an explicit conceptual base for the understanding of environmental issues which will inform environmental action. These other stages will be presented at a later date. Research Aims and Design The aims of this phase of the research are to: (i) identify key groups of teacher attitudes to science and environmental education; (ii) assess present policy and teaching practices; and (iii) explore the relationship between (i) and (ii). Questionnaires for teachers and managers (headteacher, deputy or coordinator) were designed, informed by data from pilot interviews with eight teachers (including a science coordinator), to assess priorities and concerns in science and environmental education. The questionnaires included specific questions to identify practices, statements inviting responses on attitude scales with a 1-7 level (to provide a range of views so that comparisons between attitudes could be made), and open questions to allow respondents to provide more detailed responses. The management questionnaires included questions to find out about management priorities and school development. The teacher question- naires were designed to determine the range of personal views, attitudes, background experiences and classroom practices so that analysis could uncover any relationships which may exist between these aspects and their influences on science and environ- mental education. The questionnaires were trialled using the original pilot group and four others to check for clarity of format and reliability of interpretation and response, and adjustments were made correspondingly. Then the two sets of questionnaires were sent to 70 randomly selected schools within Gloucestershire including, for eachschool, one questionnaire for a school manager and a set of teacher questionnaires to distribute to all the teachers on the staff. (A further set of children's questionnaires for Year 6 children in each school</page><page sequence="4">644 M. Littledyke was also included in the mailing. The results of this are under analysis and will be published later.) A reminder for completion was sent after 6 weeks, with a final deadline at 8 weeks. The following data show that the questionnaire respondents include a wide variety of schools and teachers which are generally representative of the primary educational phase: The returned questionnaires included completed management questionnaires from 30 schools (42.8% response rate) and five uncompleted returns (which also indicated that pressure of work was too great to complete them). The schools which completed comprised a wide range of types, including: inner city (6); suburban/small town (6); and village (18). Phases include: primary (24); infant (2); junior (4). Sizes ranged from &lt; 100 pupils (10), 100-300 (13), to &gt; 300 (7). Some 90% of the completed manage- ment questionnaires were from headteachers, with the remainder from science coordina- tors; 42.1% were female and 57.9% were male. A total of 120 completed teacher questionnaires were received, with sets of uncom- pleted returns from five schools. Of those who completed questionnaires, this included 75.8% female and 24.2% male from a full range of teaching positions and backgrounds, including: class teachers with no identified coordinator role (48.2%); science coordina- tors (11.7%); other coordinators, headteacher or deputy (40.1%). Science backgrounds were: A level science or higher (32.7%); O level or General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) science (70.9%); science in initial teacher education (42.7%); Grants for Education Support and Training (GEST) science course (16.2%); no recognised science background (21.4%). The pilot group, who also completed the questionnaire, were interviewed again after the completion deadline to explore their responses to the questionnaire further. This was to check for reliability and validity of their responses as an indicator of the way in which questions were interpreted across the whole sample. As almost a third of the respondents had a relatively high level science background, the sample may have been self-selecting, to some degree, for people with particular interest in the subject of the questionnaire. Unfortunately, national statistics showing science backgrounds of practising primary teachers are not available for comparison to verify this (source: Teacher Training Agency). However, currently, less than 30% of the undergraduate student teacher intake have A level science passes, and this figure has been increasing in recent years, (source: BEd intake, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester College of Higher Education, 1996 entry), which suggests that the figure of one-third of practising teachers (including many who qualified well before National Curriculum implementation) with A level science or higher is greater than one would expect for a truly random sample. Also, the research, which is of limited sample size and geographi- cally restricted, cannot be seen to provide reliable generalisable data. Nonetheless, the trends in the responses show indicators of attitudes and practices which may assist in understanding the nature of the problem of developing environmental education in the context of science. Results of the Survey Policy Development The management questionnaire returns provided indicators of the status and policy initiatives in science and environmental education.

Environmental education policies were less common (26.7%), depending on the priorities of particular schools, and where they do occur, most were included with science (38.5%), geography (15.4%) or science/geography policies (23.1%). When asked about proposed changes to curriculum provision, 58.6% indicated changes to science and 52.2% to environmental education. The proposed changes are shown in Table II, which shows that most schools are involved in updating science policies, but many have environmental education policy development on their agenda. Resource Provision Some 40.7% indicated changes to science resource provision, with 33.3% targeting funds to environmental education. The changes included provision of additional resources, updating resources, provision of class-based resources or separation of science and environmental education budgets. Of those signalling environmental education resource changes, 33.3% indicated new development of their outdoor area, and 20% of the changes referred to reduced resourcing in line with school budget cuts. Previous research (Littledyke, 1994) confirms that science resources have increased significantly since the implementation of the National Curriculum, whereas the presented data suggest that relatively few schools are including budgetary support for environmental education, in spite of its rising profile in school development plans.

In other cases, coordinator roles were included within the role of the headteacher for science, whilst 53.3% were included in other coordinator roles for environmental education. These other coordinator roles, which included environmental education, were science (43.8%), geography (25.0%), science/geography (6.3%), with the remainder within humanities or the headteacher role. Recorded staff in-service training for one or more staff in the school during the previous year, was 64.3% for science and 33.2% for environmental education, confirming that staff support for science was relatively well developed, but less so for environmental education. Priorities Priority for environmental education and science is confirmed by the ranking of National Curriculum subjects and cross-curricular themes by respondents, where science is ranked third and environmental education ranked fifth out of 15 (see Table III). Results from the management questionnaire showed broadly similar rankings (however, information technology and design and technology were ranked higher [fourth and sixth respect- ively], which indicates a higher management curriculum priority for these subjects). Teaching of Environmental Education Most teachers rated the amount of teaching of environmental education, relative to other National Curriculum areas, as low (see question 27, Table IV). Factors which prevented more teaching of environmental topics included, predominantly, lack of time (cited by 65.8%) and other National Curriculum areas which have 'squeezed out' such topics in</page><page sequence="7">Science and Environmental Education 647 TABLE IV.

Nonetheless, most teachers (78.6%) rated their actual en- vironmental teaching as effective, as evidenced by: general care and concern of their children (39.9%); children able to discuss environmental issues in class (31.0%); lack of litter and care for the school environment (15.0%); recycling activities of children (8.3%); and less waste (e.g. paper conserved, lights switched off) in school (5.8%). Examples of approaches to environmental teaching included: topic work (35.2%); discussion and topical use of media issues (30.9%); fieldwork/visits outside of school (21.7%); using school grounds (20.0%); within other subjects, e.g. acid rain/erosion in geography (11.7%); assemblies, drama, art, stories (4.2%). Priorities for environmental topics are shown in Table V, which shows that topics which facilitate study of the local environment were favoured and taught most frequently. Personal Involvement in Environmental Action Personal involvement in environmental action varied among teachers (see question 19, Table IV). Of those who cited examples of this, activities included: recycling (66.7%); home energy conservation (36.7%); cycling or walking where possible/transport sharing (23.5%); donation to environmental organisation (20%); 'eco-shopping' (e.g. recycled products or unleaded petrol) (12.5%); organic gardening (7.1%); active involvement in conservation (4.2%); promotion of environmental awareness (4.2%). Active involvement in environmental action was related to approaches to teaching, as those teachers with high environmental action also taught environmental topics more (as confirmed by the statistical analysis described later).</page><page sequence="9">Science and Environmental Education 649 Relationships between Experience, Attitudes and Practice The teacher questionnaires produced a range of data from the scaled attitude questions and open responses. The frequency distributions for the scaled questions were approxi- mately normal, and the data were considered to be suitable for parametric statistical tests (Daly et al., 1995; Rees, 1995) to investigate attitudes of groups of teachers with particular viewpoints, experience or practice and their responses across the questionnaire. The statistically significant effects obtained from this analysis produced meaningful relationships within the data which were generally confirmed from interview data, indicating that the conclusions can be treated as having a reasonable degree of validity. The overall trends within the responses are shown in Table IV, which includes mean attitude scores with standard deviations for all the scaled questions. (Note: questions on attitudes to environmental education (20-26, Table IV) were derived from Froud [1994]. Other questions were informed by the pilot interviews to elicit attitudes, practices and priorities.) Combined Experience, Attitudes and Practice Scores Certain scaled questions in the teacher questionnaires were grouped, as they collectively represented particular attitudes, practices or experiences. These groups of questions were selected for this purpose in designing the initial questionnaire. The combined scores for the groups of related questions, therefore, indicated particular trends in teachers' responses which could be used for comparative analysis purposes. These groups of questions were selected as shown in Table IV and the scores for each teacher were combined to identify: 1. a range of attitudes to science (attitude to science combined score [questions 1-4], including confidence in science understanding and science teaching, science interest and perceived relevance of science [high scores represent positive attitudes to science]); 2. teachers who held positivist views of science, which indicate aspects of a modem view of science (Littledyke, 1996a) (positivist views of science combined score [questions 6-8], including views of science as finding facts, truths and being value free [high scores represent positivist views]); 3. teachers who held views of science as process, which reflect aspects of a postmodern scientific stance (Littledyke, 1996a) (view of science as process combined score [questions 9-10], including views of science as about asking questions and producing ideas which are uncertain and not fixed [high scores represent views which emphasise process]); 4. a range of attitudes to environmental issues (attitudes to environmental issues combined score [questions 16-19], including concern, interest and understanding of environmental issues, and involvement in environmental action [high scores represent positive attitudes to environmental issues]); 5. a range of attitudes to environmental education (attitudes to environmental education combined score [questions 20-26], including emphasis of personal responsibility, knowledge and understanding, ethics, economic issues, political issues, awareness of local issues and awareness of issues in other countries [high scores represent positive attitudes to environmental education]); 6. a range of teaching styles (teaching style combined score [questions 28-30], includ- ing assessment of present teaching style [low scores represent child-centred, process</page><page sequence="10">650 M. Littledyke and values emphasis, whilst high scores represent teacher-centred, knowledge and skills emphasis]); 7. a corresponding range of preferred teaching styles (preferred teaching style combined score [questions 31-33], including assessment of preferred teaching style in the hypothetical case of complete autonomy and no National Curriculum [low scores represent child-centred, process and values emphasis, whilst high scores represent teacher-centred, knowledge and skills emphasis]); 8. identified science experience (science experience combined score, includes a score for a range of qualifications and science experience, incorporating degree, A level, O level/GCSE, science in initial teacher education, GEST science, and other relevant experience [each qualification/experience scored one point and high scores represent extensive science experience]); and 9. involvement in teaching environmental education (environmental teaching, includes a score which totals named environmental topics actually taught within the last 2 years [high scores represent extensive environmental teaching]). Analysis The data from the teacher questionnaires were analysed to identify any statistically significant relationships between experience, attitudes and practices. This was carried out in the following ways. 1. Each set of combined scores was used to calculate correlation coefficients, including 'r' values and statistical significance, for the relationship between the scores and the responses to each question. This gave an indication of any trends in the data for high or low combined experience, attitude or practice scores and the associated responses to particular questions. 2. These trends were investigated further by grouping those respondents with scores equal to or greater than the middle value for the combined scores (positive scores) and those respondents with scores less than the middle value (negative scores) and comparing the responses of each group to each question by means of a t test with a computed t value and degree of significance. This test generally confirmed the correlation coefficient tests and gave further indication of particularly strong relation- ships in the data. 3. Further groupings were performed by cluster analysis of each set of questions associated with the experience, attitudes and practice scores into three cluster groups: a, b and c. These clusters grouped the teachers according to how they responded to the questions included in each combined score. This produced high, medium and low scoring groups for the experience, attitudes and practice scores, but the cluster groups showed particular responses to the questions included in each combined score, thus providing additional information about trends in responses. The responses of these three cluster groups to each question in the questionnaire were compared by carrying out an analysis of variance to produce an F value for statistical significance, with a Scheffe test to determine which means were significantly different from each other. By carrying out these three forms of analysis, patterns within the data were indicated, whilst the levels of significance obtained and the significance of the analyses over the three tests indicated confidence in the validity of any suggested pattern. Using the statistically significant values (p &lt; 0.05) from these analyses, profiles of</page><page sequence="11">Science and Environmental Education 651 respondents with high combined scores for experience, attitude and practice were produced. There were seven such profiles, which are summarised in the following section. There is insufficient space here to present all the statistical data in these profiles, hence an example, which collates the statistically significant effects derived from the analyses, is shown in the appendix. Summary of the Relationships between Experience, Attitudes and Practice across the Questionnaire The following includes a summary of the attitudes of high scoring respondents with particular experience, attitudes and practice derived from statistically significant relation- ships within the survey data. Confidence in the validity of these conclusions is related to the degree of significance of the effects and whether the significance was confirmed over the three tests carried out (see the appendix for an example of how the statistically significant results of the analyses were used to produce the profiles). This summary also infers the converse for low scoring respondents. The ways in which questions were interpreted by the sample of teachers who were interviewed after they had completed the questionnaire also corresponded generally with the conclusions derived from the statisti- cal analysis, which provided further evidence of the validity of the findings. A wide range of responses was obtained over the survey sample, indicating some eclectic and sometimes contradictory views (Ray, 1991); nonetheless, certain significant patterns of responses emerged from the analysis. These patterns are included in profiles of groups of attitudes to science and environmental education. Views of Science Three general groups of attitudes to science were identified within the survey sample. Confidence. Teachers with confidence and positive attitudes to science and science teaching (high attitudes to science scores, with the profile shown as an example in the appendix) had generally strong science backgrounds and experience. They perceived science as important, understood that science is not value free and recognised the importance of enquiry through asking questions, whilst their teaching style emphasised knowledge and understanding of science. They were also critical of science as being responsible for more harm than good socially. This group of teachers had positive attitudes to environmental education, had a good understanding of the issues, and considered it to be important and interesting. They were actively involved in both environmental teaching and in environmental action in their lives. Interestingly, the cluster groupings indicated that the medium confident teachers considered science as being less relevant to their lives than the group of teachers who were least confident with science. Open questionnaire comments and interviews suggest that the former group contain teachers who have some confidence in teaching science to children, but are not personally interested in science, whilst the latter group contains teachers who see science as important, in its technological application, but find many scientific ideas difficult. This latter group may also include teachers who are more critically aware of their personal limitations in science than some of the former group, who may teach in a confident, but uncritical manner. Positivist views. Teachers who agreed most strongly with the claim that science is about facts, is a way of finding truths and is free of values (high positivist views of science</page><page sequence="12">652 M. Littledyke score) tended to hold the view that science is the main means of solving environmental problems. They also held positive attitudes to environmental education, finding it interesting, and with high involvement in environmental teaching and environmental action. Their teaching style emphasised knowledge over process. Interview data and open comments from the questionnaire indicated that responses to the positivist views of science statements were complex. Of those who disagreed with the positivist statements, some were from an informed scientific viewpoint and with good science background, whilst others disagreed from a viewpoint of disaffection through lack of interest/under- standing or from an anti-rationalist stance. Cluster analysis showed that, of those who agreed with the statements of science as facts and a way of finding truths, some did not consider science as value free, whilst others did. The latter group held more consistently positivist views, whilst the former held a positivist understanding of science which was also generally critical of the impact of science, from an ethical position. Emphasis on process. The previous point is borne out by examining the attitudes of the group which emphasised process in science (high views of science as process score). This group had positive attitudes to science, with confidence in science and science teaching, saw science as interesting and important, and considered science as holding major responsibility for environmental problems. The group also had positive attitudes to environmental education, emphasising ethics, political issues and awareness of issues in other countries. These attitudes highlight the global aspects of environmental edu- cation. Cluster analysis showed two clear groups which generally agreed with or disagreed with the two science as process questions, whilst the third group saw science as questions, but disagreed that scientific ideas are uncertain. This latter group may hold positivist views, but emphasise process in their work with children. Views on Environmental Education Two groups of attitudes were identified within the survey sample, though these were interrelated. Interest in environmental issues and action. The group which showed most concern for, understanding of and interest in environmental issues, and high personal environmental action (high attitudes to environmental issues score) included those with confidence in science and science teaching and who find science interesting and relevant. They held positivist views and agreed that science is about facts and is value free, though interview data indicated that this may have been a stance which was also critical of science. They also held positive attitudes to environmental education, emphasising political issues and awareness of issues in other countries, which also highlight the global aspects of environmental education. This group was actively involved in environmental teaching. Interest in environmental education. The group which agreed most strongly with the statements emphasising aspects of environmental education (high attitudes to environmental education score) saw science as important and as a way of finding truths, but also valued processes in science. These teachers showed interest, concern for and understanding of environmental issues, and were involved in environmental action and teaching.</page><page sequence="13">Science and Environmental Education 653 Teaching Style Actual teaching style and preferred teaching style (teaching style and preferred teaching style scores) were closely related. Teachers whose style was less child-centred and had less emphasis on process and values showed low interest in and more negative attitudes to science, which was seen as about finding facts. They also held an uncritical view of science, seeing it as not substantially responsible for environmental problems, or doing more harm than good, and not being the means of solving environmental problems. They also had low interest in environmental issues, which they regarded as of relatively low importance. Conclusions The survey showed that teachers produced complex and varied responses according to their experience and attitudes. Nonetheless, certain trends emerged, and particular types of relationships between experience, attitudes and practice can be identified. Status of Science and Environmental Education Science has high perceived status and priority within the curriculum, with well devel- oped support through policy development, identification of coordinator roles, improved resourcing and in-service training provision. This has arisen directly through National Curriculum legislation (DES, 1988). Analysis of responses to planned change is located within 'concerns theory' (Hall &amp; Loucks, 1977), which proposes that teacher concerns progress through an invariant sequence of phases from initial awareness, with personal and informational concerns, through to general management, collaborative and refocus- ing concerns, associated with policy development, implementation and monitoring (Bennett et al., 1991). The survey data confirm that schools have progressed to collaborative and refocusing concerns in science, whilst environmental education devel- opment remains in earlier stages of personal concerns in most schools. However, in spite of its lack of subject status, environmental education, as a cross-curricular theme, has relatively high priority. Support is not well developed, and most schools have no policy provision, no identified coordinator roles, or environmental education is included in science or geography, if identified. Resourcing and in-service support is also limited. Whilst science teaching is generally well established through its National Curriculum core subject status, environmental education is not well developed in most cases, though some teachers and schools have well-developed practice, according to their own rating. Lack of time and higher pragmatic priorities for National Curriculum subjects, in spite of the perceived importance of environmental education, prevent progression in concerns for environmental education to management and collaborative issues. Relationships between Experience and Attitudes and Practice in Science and Environ- mental Education Taking the statistically significant relationships derived from the analysis (with an example profile shown in the appendix), certain broad categories of attitudes can be identified. Teachers with confidence in science. Teachers who were most confident in science generally had positive attitudes to environmental education and to forms of environmen-</page><page sequence="14">654 M. Littledyke tal action. This indicates that scientific understanding of the issues can enhance environmental awareness and give priority to environmental teaching, as well as personal action for the environment. Teachers with confidence in science fell into two groups. Teachers with confidence in science and holding positivist views. One group of such teachers held positivist views, including a view of science as finding truths, facts and as value free. They also emphasised scientific knowledge over processes. Such views have been criticised by scientific and 'deep green' philosophers (Polanyi, 1958; Popper, 1963; Feyerabend, 1975, 1985; Naess, 1989) and are associated with the deterministic, mechanistic science of the modem era, though they evidently do not preclude environ- mental concern and action. Significantly, this group also saw science as a means of solving environmental problems. These views are in keeping with Naess's concept of 'shallow environmentalism' (sometimes referred to as 'light green'), which proposes technical management of the environment (1989), but which has been criticised for not considering deeper questions about ecological relationships, ethical responsibilities for living things, and implied radical environmental action (Hettinger, 1990). Teachers with confidence in science and holding process/value oriented views. Another group of science-confident teachers disagreed with the positivist statements, emphasised science processes over knowledge, was critical of science's role in environmental problems, and valued ethical and global perspectives on the environment. This latter group held views which are more in keeping with Naess's 'deep' category of environ- mentalism ('deep green'). These views are also compatible with 'organicist' (Griffin, 1988; Orr, 1992) perspectives on science and the environment which include ethical values and informed understanding of ecological relationships. This perspective is also part of a postmodern approach to science and environmental education. Teacher with low confidence in science and holding positive attitudes to environmental education. A further group of environmentally concerned teachers was less confident in science. They generally agreed with the positivist statements, but tended to be critical of such perspectives (suggested by open statements and interview responses), tending to prioritise ethics and global perspectives. They had positive attitudes to science and science education but were critical of science's role in environmental problems. Such attitudes are based on environmental care and concern, though they lack sound scientific understanding to inform them. Teachers with low confidence in science and holding less positive attitudes to environ- mental education. The teachers who showed less concern and interest in environmental education or environmental action (few had overtly negative attitudes), generally showed less interest and confidence in science, held positivist views and were uncritical of science's role in environmental problems. Their teaching style was generally more teacher-centred, placing more emphasis on knowledge over processes, and skills over values than the other groups. This infers an instrumental approach to teaching which is also in opposition to currently accepted constructivist understanding of children's learning (Driver et al., 1985; Osborne &amp; Freyberg, 1985; Driver &amp; Bell 1986; Driver &amp; Oldham, 1986; Needham &amp; Hill, 1987; Scott et al., 1987). These attitudes indicate lack of critical and conceptual understanding of science, which is also associated with a low level of awareness and concern for environmental education or action. Overall conclusions are that, in promoting environmental education:</page><page sequence="15">Science and Environmental Education 655 "* many schools have prioritised its development; "* many teachers regard it as important and include it in their teaching; "* understanding and confidence in science can enhance environmental education; "* responses from some teachers who are confident in science suggest a critical understanding of the nature of science and its role in environmental problems. This forms a sound basis for effective environmental education; "* even where positivist views are held, environmental education may be prioritised; "* some teachers who lack confidence and understanding in science may prioritise environmental education because of care and concern over environmental issues; and "* personal environmental action is associated with positive approaches to environmental education. Factors which deter environmental education include: "* limited policy development, lack of coordinator and teaching support, and poor resourcing in many schools; "* lack of curriculum time because of demands from timetabling of National Curriculum subjects; "* lack of scientific understanding of environmental issues in many teachers; "* limited concern for or interest in environmental education in some teachers; "* inappropriate or limited understanding of the nature of science and its role in environmental problems; and "* approaches to teaching which can perpetuate inappropriate understanding of science in children. These factors have relevance to initial teacher education, to in-service support for teachers, and to school policy development if science education is to support environ- mental education effectively. Important implications of the findings here are that confidence in science can enhance understanding of environmental issues and provide an important platform for environmental education. Thus, development of environmental education should be seen as being supported by corresponding development of teachers' understanding of science and confidence in science teaching. Initial teacher education and in-service science courses should also consider the epistemological basis of science as well as the processes and concepts which need to be taught so that environmentally appropriate science pedagogy can be developed. Furthermore, they should develop a critical view of the role of science and technology in contributing to and the possible approaches to rectifying environmental problems. Such approaches must also incorporate ethical consideration of human relationships with other living things and to ecological systems. In summary, environmental education, which aims to foster understanding of the complexity of environmental issues, needs to address social and ethical implications, as well as the scientific principles which underpin the problems. The overall conclusions from these data show, however, that environmental education is generally underdeveloped and is restricted by pressure from a crowded National Curriculum and from other management priorities. Given the core status and curriculum priority of science, however, there is an excellent opportunity to raise the agenda of environmental education by integrating it more closely with the science curriculum. This would both enhance environmental understanding and provide more meaning and social context to much of the science curriculum. This is the subject of further research, to be reported later.</page><page sequence="16">656 M.
