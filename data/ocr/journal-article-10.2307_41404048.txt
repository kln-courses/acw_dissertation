<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book reMarks A Personal View of Current Juvenile Literature Ruth M. Stein With summer in the offing, it is impor- tant to remember that children should succeed in any recreational reading pro- gram they undertake. Because young- sters are not usually taught to cope with failure, it is vital that leisure time books give pleasure as well as challenge. Such positive experiences reinforce life-long attitudes toward literature and learning. A plus (+) marks the superior selection, while a minus (-) designates the in- ferior product, so marked for reasons stated. Happy summer and happy read- ing! Picture Story Books + Chester Crickeťs Pigeon Ride by George Seiden, ill. by Garth Williams. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1981. 72 pp. $10.95 Chester, introduced to older readers in The Cricket in Times Square , cavorts for a younger audience in movies, planetarium, and museum. A floor-size perspective matches a dizzying aerial view when Lulu Pigeon takes the homesick insect for a tour of the Big Apple. Pen-and-ink drawings do credit to a captivating cricket in a magic town. An over-size book to read and share. A Dark Dark Tale by Ruth Brown. Dial, 1981. 32 pp. $8.95. The protagonist, a black cat, is pic- tured but never named as it explores a dark dark house on a dark dark moor in a sumptuously illustrated take-off on the teeny- tiny tale. Color and sense of third dimension heighten the spookiness. Well designed pages, however, detract from a tale better told than read. +Day Dreamers by Tom Feelings and Eloise Greenfield. Dial, 1981. 32 pp. $9.95. Two great talents reveal their own daydreams in lines of poetry which un- derscore evocative portraits in pencil or 482 Language Arts, Volume 59, Number 5, May 1982</page><page sequence="2">pen and ink. Reproductions of halftone photographs express longing faces. "Daydreamers . . . /holding their bodies still/for a time/letting the world turn around them/while their dreams hopscotch, double-dutch, dance,/ thoughts rollerskate, /crisscross, /bump into hopes and wishes." Active dream- ing renews dreamers, creators, and us. Detective Whoo by Dennis Panek. Bradbury, 1981. 32 pp. $9.95. In the same style as Matilda Hippo Has a Big Mouth , the tongue-in-cheek whodunit for the very youngest searches for the source of strange nocturnal noises. Daylight solves the mystery. An ingenious use of black and yellow, and of segmented torsos in cartoon double- spreads. Much darker and less pedantic in tone than Matilda. ... A fine book to read aloud because of size, color, and scraps of text. +Hosie's Zoo, ill. by Leonard Baskin, words by Tobias, Hosea, Lucretia, and Lisa Baskin. Viking, 1981. 40 pp. $10.95. Close-up eye-to-eye watercolor con- frontation with exotic animals makes the book extraordinary, despite an uneven text. You can guess which of the Baskin offspring wrote the verses for creatures like the Slender Loris, bactrian camel, titi, and others. Humor characterizes some of the descriptions, metaphor others. A sense of space fills paintings and overall design. The House That Jack Built, ill. by Bobby Lewish. Four Winds, 1981. 32 pp. Reinforced binding, $10.95. Animals enact the chain of events that starts when Jack built a house in the traditional cumulative nursery rhyme. The influence of film cartoons is evident in the watercolor doublespreads, high- lighted by prism colors. Much to notice in expressions and detailed settings. +The Importance of Crocus by Roger Duvoisin. Knopf, 1981. 32 pp. $8.95. The importance of being Crocus is finding how he can contribute to the well being of the Sweetpeas' farm. The author's understanding of human nature exhibits itself in the voice of Trumpet the rooster: . . how right I was when I said we can all do something that others cannot do.'" Brightly colored animals balanced nicely on the pages move the eye up, down, and around. Duvoisin's talents will be missed by generations of children and adults. -fThe Little Moon Theater by Irene Haas. A Margaret K. McElderry Book. Atheneum, 1981. 32 pp. Reinforced binding, $11.95. Against four seasonal backdrops a small troup of traveling actors perform and help off-beat characters, including a small, tired fairy godmother. Subtle themes deal with non-conformity and the nature of wishes. Changes from courtly narration to italicized ballad mark the brilliant style of stories-within plays-within story. Repetitive phrases and accumulated events hold the atten- tion and climax at exactly the right moment, concluding a miniature mas- terpiece. Reproductions of precise watercolors enrich characterization and the mood of enchantment, blending a European ambience with folkloric ele- ments. A marvelous story to be read and re-read, sung, and dramatized. Mine! by David Lord Porter. Houghton Mifflin, 1981. 32 pp. $7.95. In this "little parable about wanting" Book reMarks: A Personal View of Current Juvenile Literature 483</page><page sequence="3">Porter describes how a little boy's self- ishness leaves him alone in the world with nothing, until he learns to share. "Mine" is redefined, more through finely-drawn illustration than text. Symbolic use of color against black and white. +An Owl and Three Pussycats by Alice and Martin Provensen. Atheneum, 1981. 32 pp. $9.95. A richly illustrated large book con- tinues the saga of Maple Hill Farm, with the titled characters introduced im- mediately next to the title page. Ques- tions and the second person involve young readers, first in caring for a tiny owl, then in helping three kittens grow up. Detailed line-on- wash illustrations offer indoor and outdoor perspectives, extending action and interest. +Petrosinella: A Neapolitan Rapunzel by Giambattista Basile, ill. by Diane Stanley. Warne, 1981. 32 pp. Reinforced binding, $11.95. Translated in 1847 this earlier version of the story popular in the Mediterra- nean area nearly two hundred years be- fore the Grimms were published finds the heroine breaking the enchantment of the ogress with three magic acorns. The chase at the end is more exciting than the grimmer German tale. Blue predominates in wash-and-ink illustra- tions which reflect sixteenth-century art values, the approximate time when Basile compiled his folktale collection. No behests here for Petrosinella to let down her hair, although that is the way the prince ascends the tower. Compare in style and content to Rapunzel. The Summer Cat by Howard Knotts. Harper &amp; Row, 1981. 32 pp. $7.95. Knotts' companion to The Winter Cat finds a small boy accepting the fact that the cat he found during the summer be- longs to someone else. Delicate pencil il- lustrations capture the mood of child and feline. A softer version of the theme in Parsons' The Upside-Down Cat, but for younger readers. Too small to be shared in a large group. Realistic Fiction For the Middle Grades Anastasia Again! by Lois Lowry, deco- rations by Diane deGroat. Houghton Mifflin, 1981. 145 pp. $7.95. Twelve-year-old Anastasia is hor- rified at her family's decision to move to the suburbs, but she survives in an en- gaging tale of the consequences of "premature assumptions." The very funny heroine of Anastasia Krupnik is back with her family - precocious baby Sam and parents who talk and behave like real people, plus a crew of senior citizens to put the Gray Panthers to shame. The dialogue will keep you in stitches. Lowry writes well in different modes and for all ages. An extra bonus for would-be writers. Baseball Fever by Johanna Hurwitz, ill. by Ray Cruz. Morrow, 1981. 128 pp. $7.95. Can a ten-year-old baseball nut and an intellectual father ever come to terms? They do, through outside help, and it's a whole new ballgame. Ezra Feldman's family comes off as sym- pathetically realistic, but some of the humor is forced and the situations con- trived. Still, fans of family stories about baseball will enjoy it. A Matter of Pride by Emily Crofford, ill. 484 Language Arts</page><page sequence="4">by Jim La Marche. Carolrhoda, 1981. 48 pp. $7.95. Young Meg's opinion of her mother changes when she sees the woman con- quer several kinds of fear on behalf of her family. Slowly, yet sparsely, the first-person narration unwinds as a ten-year-old witnesses the depression on an Arkansas cotton plantation. Much of the drama comes through what is left unsaid. Crofford's first book, a textured novella, leaves us applauding. Pen- and-ink washes work more successfully than the dark-hued colored spreads. So Long, Grandpa by Elfie Donnelly, trans, by Anthea Bell. Crown, 1981. 92 pp. $7.95. If any book could be about death and be entertaining, this is it. The ongoing anecdotal narrative places the reader right in ten-year-old Michael's shoes as he describes the decline of his loving grandfather. The conglomeration of modern and outmoded slang, plus the Viennese names and expressions charm, even as they tip the reader that this is a translation. The family - older sister, father, mother, maid Frau Novotný, Dr. Gnad, and the thoroughly believable young hero seem as real as next-door- neighbors. Scenes at the Grand Canary Islands and the first of two funerals evoke chuckles, as Grandpa, the book's real star, comments on life and death. Filled with love, Donnelly's first book does much to dispel fears and break un- natural silences. +The Trouble with Tuck by Theodore Taylor. Doubleday, 1981. 110 pp. $8.95. The trouble is that Friar Tuck, Hel- en's golden Labrador is going blind. To keep his spirit from being broken Helen must train him to follow and trust Daisy, the guide dog. Written in flashback, the human drama is second- ary to the one enacted by the special canines. At the conclusion you'll join the determined girl and the smiling dogs as they parade past cheering family and neighbors to the "Colonel Bogey" march. Based on true events, the re- markable tale uplifts through its theme and attention to gritty details. For the Upper Grades Jump Ship to Freedom by James Lincoln Collier and Christopher Collier. Del- acorte, 1981. 198 pp. $9.95. In 1787 young Daniel Arabus, eager to buy freedom for himself and his mother, escapes from his dishonest mas- ter, and tries to find help in cashing the soldiers' notes received by his father for fighting in the revolution. The black fourteen-year-old faces two dilem- mas - his slave mentality and a promise to be kept - that threaten his people. Characters are sacrificed to themes, and action to historical detail. The boy doesn't jump ship until almost halfway through the book. The story casts lights on the Constitutional Convention and Revolutionary slavery, but the authors' explication of their research of the story is more exciting than the story itself. Not as successful as My Brother Sam Is Dead or The Bloody Country. Let the Circle Be Unbroken by Mildred D. Taylor. Dial, 1981. 394 pp. $11.95. Taylor continues the saga of the Logan family in this complex sequel to her Newbery Award-winning Roll of Thunder , Hear My Cry. Too much space, time, and energy is spent in bringing new readers up to date on the family it- self, and on the status of blacks in the Mississippi countryside during the 1935 Book reMarks: A Personal View of Current Juvenile Literature 485</page><page sequence="5">Depression. Cassie, Taylor's spokesper- son, is older. Through her eyes we see the family's enduring under white man's justice, and the conflict of racial feelings versus the need for a roof over one's head. Especially poignant is the role of black girls. I found the first two books more absorbing, benefiting from a pithier style. Another novel in the series is in the works. + A Tide Flowing by Joan Phipson. Atheneum, 1981. 156 pp. $8.95. In a more inward-directed book than is her wont, Phipson depicts a young man's torment from his mother's death and his father's rejection. Mark learns to cope with his grandparents, finding new strength and purpose in his ac- quaintance with a young quadriplegic with whom he shares his fears and his all-consuming interest in nature. De- spite a poor title and a tendency to overwrite here and there, the sensitive novel holds the attention through fine characterization, metaphorical use of sea and albatross, and the profound un- derstanding of two wounded adoles- cents. Phipson is as potent writing about water as she is writing of the Aus- tralian landscapes. Her seascapes charge the atmosphere with emotion. A fine piece of writing. +Upon the Head of the Goat: A Child- hood in Hungary 1939-1944 by Aranka Siegal. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1981. 214 pp. $9.95. How much of this personal narrative is fleshed-out memory and how much actually occurred as written, we can't tell. No matter. The account of nine- year-old Piri's experiences of survival engrosses from the first moment she heard Hitler's name to five years later when her family boarded the cattle train for Auschwitz. Evocative scenes contrast the rural Ukraine with urban Hungary. Piri's resourceful mother sticks in mem- ory after the unfinished story ends. A sense of doom pervades despite cheer- fulness, because we know what lies ahead. Not to be missed in Holocaust literature. You Never Knew Her As I Did! by Mol- lie Hunter. Harper &amp; Row, 1981. 216 pp. $10.10. The "Her" is Mary, Queen of Scots, and the "I" is an adult Will Douglas, who, upon hearing of the Queen's execution, recalls the year of her impris- onment on the island Castle of Lochle- ven in 1567. More is revealed of the then seventeen-year-old young man than of Mary. Most of the suspenseful action oc- curs off-stage, before and after the Queen's incarceration. Not as gripping as Hunter's other novels. Fantasy For the Middle Grades + The Gathering Room by Colby Rodowsky. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, 1981. 186 pp. $9.95. Mudge's fantasy combines the psychological with the literary, as the nine-year-old boy befriends the dead inhabitants of the cemetery where his father is gatekeeper. The entrance of a well drawn aunt brings the outside world into Mudge's solitary life. As in all births, pain accompanies the en- counter. House, burial grounds, the city - all assume an importance equal to the characters, including the other- worldly ones. Beautiful writing, well paced and firmly grounded. A fine mesh 486 Language Arts</page><page sequence="6">of the real and the fantastic. For older readers as well. +The Indian in the Cupboard by Lynne Reid Banks, ill. by Brock Cole. Dodd, Mead, 1981. 181 pp. $9.95. A magic cupboard and key enable nine-year-old Omri to animate a plastic Indian from the eighteenth century and a toy cowboy from the nineteenth. No whimsy, rather an original device for observing the nature of power over de- pendent beings and the accompanying responsibility. Omri and his pal think, speak, and behave normally. Minutia concerning Little Bear's taming a horse, eating, and constructing a long house add to theme and plot. A logical ending. Time warp with a twist. Mail-Order Wings by Beatrice Gormley. ill. by Emily Arnold McCully. Dutton, 1981. 176 pp. $9.95. It's a nine-year-old girl who works magic, by wings ordered through a catalogue. They work, with frightening side effects. Gimlet-eyed readers can spot the source of Andrea's adventure in the first chapter. A good first novel that comments on the price of wish fulfill- ment. Family members and aviatic prac- tices add humor and suspenseful credi- bility. Out of the Bug Jar by Kathleen Thomas, ill. by Tom O'Sullivan. Dodd, Mead, 1981. 125 pp. $7.95. Twelve-year-old Tom Jenkins relates how he caught a tooth fairy in his bug jar two years earlier, and how he had to connive to be rid of the creature. Let's see . . . we've had imaginary dead people, toys brought to life, and here is Marvin, no winged creature, but a tough little man ". . . with a red baseball cap and funny-looking boots," dressed in blue jeans and a red shirt. Marvin speaks in slang and in a loud voice. His reluctance to be released pro- vides plot and humor. Again, the preoc- cupation with size and the off-beat character enlivens the first-person narra- tion. Walter, The Homing Pigeon by Nathaniel Benchley, ill. by Whitney Darrow, Jr. Harper &amp; Row, 1981. 26 pp. $7.95. While Walter obeys his owner for food, the man is in it for money. Wal- ter's adventures begin when he decides to stop for a snack on the way home during a race. We're with the good- natured bird all the way. Benchley gets in some digs on the nature of "home." Soft black/white cartoons accentuate the action. While animals speak, they are far from anthropomorphic. Fine for third and fourth grades. For the Upper Grades Circle Home by Emily Hanlon. Brad- bury, 1981. 237 pp. $9.95. A dybbuk motif complicates a time- warp story when thirteen-year-old Mai falls down a prehistoric ravine into the body of Isabelle, the twentieth-century victim of a fatal fall from the window in her house. The poignant story fascinates through its look at modern and ancient ways from the viewpoints of alien cul- tures. Authentic junior high school characters and family help support credulous readers. The Keeper of the Isis Light by Monica Hughes. An Argo Book. Atheneum, 1981. 136 pp. $8.95. Reared by her robot Guardian on the Book reMarks: A Personal View of Current Juvenile Literature 487</page><page sequence="7">planet Isis, teen-ager Olwen Pendennis welcomes settlers from Earth, falling in love with one of them. The author de- livers a double punch when readers realize before Olwen that the arrivals must adapt to the girl, as much as to the land. The plot and the exotic Isis through Olwen's eyes rivet, but the novel falters through anti-climaxes, a weak conclusion, and changes of perspective. A science fiction treatment of prejudice and loneliness. + Lights on the Lake by Gregory Maguire. Farrar, Straus, &amp; Giroux, 1981. 214 pp. $10.95. An unusual fantasy expounds on Emily Dickinson's statement that "... space and time are things of the body and have little or nothing to do with our selves. ..." Aided by a magic feather from a black bird that emerges from an eerie mist over Canaan Lake, young Daniel Rider flies at night into the dreams of others. Feeling deserted, lonely, and preoccupied with death, the twelve-year-old identifies with an older "leftover," a guilt-ridden poet. Rich im- agery and Christian metaphor set the mood in the Adirondacks. A forbidding outdoor atmosphere enhances the bus- tling life in Meyer House, with its priests, ritual, and homey house- keeper - all essential to Daniel. As he crosses the threshold of time and space, he sees that people were "... willing and waiting all along to be friends, reaching over to him. ..." A well exe- cuted original piece on life and death and friendship. -Soul-Singer of Tyrnos by Ardath Mayhar. An Argosty Book. Atheneum, 1981. 195 pp. $9.95. Yeleeve, one of a selected group who can sing soul in order to commend or condemn the owner, discovers on her quests that calamity which only she can overcome threatens the well being of her country. Yeleeve's deeds to rout the evil take on the quality of knight errantry. Since nothing can withstand her power, suspense is at a minimum. The flat nar- ration saps vitality from the action, slowing the story even further. Even the revelations of the nature of the Winter Beast and the source of the evil come too late to arouse the reader. The self- contained chapters are uneven in qual- ity, and the soul-singer remains an enigma. The author does not sufficiently explore the theme that people must unite to protect themselves. I shall not accompany Yeleeve as she travels the rest of her world. A book to skim and skip through. 488 Language Arts</page><page sequence="8">Chester Cricket's Pigeon Ride - photo courtesy of Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux Hosie's Zoo - photo courtesy of Viking The Little Moon Theater - photo courtesy of Atheneum An Owl and Three Pussycats - photo courtesy of Atheneum Petrosinella: A Neapolitan Rapunzel - photo courtesy of Warne So Long , Grandpa - photo courtesy of Crown A Tide Flowing - photo courtesy of Atheneum Upon the Head of the Goat: A Childhood in Hungary 1939-44 - photo courtesy of Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux The Gathering Room - photo courtesy of Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux Book reMarks: A Personal View of Current Juvenile Literature 489</page></plain_text>
