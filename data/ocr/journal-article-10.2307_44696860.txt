<plain_text><page sequence="1">92 NOTES ON THE TEXT OF CATULLUS The text of Catullus is notoriously corrupt, and though much has been healed, something remains to be done. An article may still be useful if it encourages scepticism and speculation.1 1 have found Baehrens the best commentator for this particular purpose; for information about the manuscripts I rely on Mynors. The text printed is that of V where I wish to discuss it, but it is sometimes silently altered where I do not. Textual variants are mentioned only where they are relevant to the argument. Passer, deliciae meae puellae, quicum ludere, quem in sinu tenere, cui primům digitum dare appetenti et acris solet incitare morsus, 5 cum desiderio meo nitenti carum nescioquid lubet iocari, et solaciolum sui doloris, credo, [ut] cum gravis acquiescit (-et V) ardor: tecum ludere sicut ipsa possem 10 et tristis animi levare curas. Catullus 2 Lines 5-6 are generally interpreted 'when it is pleasing to my radiant love ...'. J.S. Phillimore doubted the possibility of personal desiderium in an oblique case, and reasonably asked for a parallel;2 Fordyce tried to meet the challenge by citing 104. 1 'credis me potuisse meae maledicere vitae?', but vitae is an insufficient analogy for more abstract words like desiderio and voluptati. And there is a more clear-cut objection to the traditional explanation: nitens , which appeals to the eye, is the wrong sort of word to agree with desiderium. 3 Catullus might call the girl 'my great desire' because desire in the primary sense can be great (cf. Hor. Carm. 1.14.18 'nunc desiderium curaque non levis'), but not 'my red-haired desire' and not desiderium nitens. Therefore desiderio is not dative but ablative, and the meaning is 'to her shining with longing for me';4 commentators do not notice Anacreon, PMG 444 rcóGcp axiXßcov (of "Epiûç rcapGévioç). It now becomes clear that nitens refers not to beauty in general but to sparkling eyes; when Juvenal says of Lesbia 'turbavit nitidos exstinctus passer ocellos' (6.8), he is combining allusions to Catullus 2 and 3. This conclusion encourages a more tentative re-interpretation of line 7: the girl</page><page sequence="2">NOTES ON THE TEXT OF CATULLUS 93 offers her finger to the bird (a) in happy moments and ( b ) 'as a solace for her pain'. That is to say, solaciolum follows solet incitare morsus as an 'accusative in apposition to the sentence'; sui can now be retained as it refers back to puella , the subject (understood) of solet. This explanation was excluded so long as desiderio was understood in a personal sense; for after it had displaced puella as the logical subject of 5-6, it was impossible to find a point of reference for sui. It may be thought unnatural to have such an accusative after a cum clause has intervened; yet cf. Tac. H. 4.19.1 'pretium itineris donativum, duplex stipendium, augeri equitum numerum, promissa sane a Vitellio, postulabant, non ut adsequerentur sed causam seditioni'. I am not here primarily concerned with 8, but quote it to show how the lines go in pairs; like Munro I look for a clear contrast between dolor and ardor. The omission of ut is due to Baehrens,5 the present acquiescit to Ellis. quare, quidquid habes boni malique, die nobis: volo te ac tuos amores ad caelum lepido vocare versu. 6.15-17 Catullus cannot 'call' anybpdy to the sky unless he is already there himself. He cannot even be referring to his own immortality as a poet, as that has yet to be achieved; mock-heroic exaggeration is not plausible in this mundane context. Baehrens, who saw the difficulty, was as often better at diagnosis than treatment. His ad cenam suggests a nineteenth-century obsession with etiquette: Catullus cannot ask the febriculosum scortum to dinner unless he is told what name to put on the invitation. The line must refer to the poet's power to confer immortality: here the name of the laudando really is necessary. The contrast between the slight lepido and the grand caelum is effective, and brings out exactly what Catullus did for his friends. Read levare. Cf. Prop. 3.1.9 'quo (versu) me Fama levât terra sublimis', Hier. In Os. 1.1.5 (PL XXV 823 c) 'cur Socratem ad caelum levenť, Ven. Fort.

NISBET Pļautus might perhaps have scanned imperatival commoda as a dactyl, but not Catullus. Though brevis brevians was a phenomenon of spoken Latin, it is only found in classical poetry with a few common words; the use of puta as a pyrrhic to mean 'for instance' (Pers. 4.9) is not a parallel. In the absence of other instances from epigram or satire, the prosody cannot be defended by the oratio recta, and still less by the social position of the speaker. commodum enim (Hand) and commode enim (Munro) are not only unsatisfactory in sense but give an unparalleled elision at this place in the line; it has also been observed that in the polymetrics Catullus uses enim only after £5/(12.8 and 35.17). One is reluctant to cut across nam volo ad Serapim, which gives a convincing movement (though Passerat's iam is agreeably impatient). Munro's final thought was da modo , but this phrase is wrongly placed at the end of a sentence. Ellis considered taking commoda as neuter plural in the sense of 'loans'; 'perquisites' would be more promising, as the word is used euphemistically of the rewards of military service.6 The apposition with istos, which Ellis was ready to consider, is impossible on either hypothesis, ista would be easy but unsatisfactory: O. Skutsch has pointed out that in this part of the book (poems 2 to 26) Catullus does not give his hendecasyllables a trochaic base.7 On the other hand istaec might be worth considering (at 67.37 R restores the form for iste); a corruption from istec to istos does not seem excessive in a context where the next word begins with c, and in a tradition where e and o are often confused. But one can hardly say istaec commoda without a verb to mean 'give me your perquisites'; such an accusative may be used in shouting for water or selling figs, or in an impassioned exclamation like 38.7 'paulum quidlibet allocutionis' or 55.10 'Camerium mihi, pessimae puellae', but it is too peremptory for our passage and unsuited to a word as abstract as commoda. commoda cannot be governed by quaeso, which in classical Latin does not take an accusative of the thing sought;8 on the other hand quaero seems possible. For the combination with mihi cf. 58 b.9-10 'et multis languoribus peresus essem te mihi, amice, quaeritando' (though the old conjecture mi amice should be noted); so velie sibi, poscere sibi, postulare sibi. For the separation of the enclitic pronoun by inquit cf. 18 '"non" inquam "mihi tam fuit maligne"'.9 So the sentence now runs '"quaero" inquit "mihi, mi Catulle, paulum istaec commoda"', 'I require your perquisites, darling, for a few minutes'. The speech is not absurdly peremptory (as it would be without a verb), but silkily imperious, ut decuit cinaediorem. omnia haec, quaecumque feret voluntas caelitum, temptare simul parati ... 11.13-4 Catullus has just mentioned all the places where Furius and Aurelius might go as</page><page sequence="4">NOTES ON THE TEXT OF CATULLUS 95 his comités. But though these are well summed up by omnia haec, the resumptive pronoun does not seem compatible with the indefinite quaecumque. And though the will of the gods may bring death and disaster, it cannot bring the Alps, the Rhine, and the Britons. Friedrich separates quaecumque from omnia haec ; the relative clause now means 'no matter what the gods bring'. This use of quaecumque without an antecedent is explained by Housman10 on Prop. 1.21.9-10 'et quaecumque super dispersa invenerit ossa montibus Etruscis, haec sciat esse mea'. But our passage is much more difficult in two respects: haec immediately precedes quaecumque , and it is too tempting to connect omnia with the generalising relative pronoun. Quinn gives another explanation: 'C.'s friends are ready to face not only all those things ( omnia haec) which have been mentioned, but whatever the gods have in store for C.'. So R.O.A.M. Lyne:11 ' quaecumque would naturally agree with haecf but Catullus has a surprise. It must be paratactic ...; while haec looks back, quaecumque looks onward, enlarging'. But the surprise is an unpleasant one: an asyndeton bimembre is particularly unexpected in a place where quaecumque is naturally taken with omnia. Ellis considered quocumque, comparing Hor. Carm. 1.7.25 'quo nos cumqueferet melior fortuna parente', but it makes all the difference that Catullus has no accusative nos. If Friedrich's interpretation is to be accepted one might consider quodcumque, which would now be successfully detached from omnia haec. Dr. J. Diggle cites in favour of this view Enn. Ann. 197 'quidve ferat fors', Ter. Phorm. 138 'quod fors feret feremus'; as he points out, such heroics suit the grandiloquence of voluntas caelitum. But I prefer to try quacumque'feret is now intransitive and means 'bears', 'tends', 'goes' ( OLD s.v. fero , 31). The usage is more prosaic than the transitive construction (cf. phrases like 'ut mea fert opinio'), but it is attested with voluntas even in poetry: cf. Lucr. 3.44 'si fert ita forte voluntas', Virg. Aen. 6.675, Manil. 5.495-6 'qua fert cumque voluntas praecipitant vires' (both verbs are presumably intransitive), a passage actually cited by Ellis in support of his quocumque. An indefinite relative clause indicating 'way by which' fits contexts that refer to leading and following,12 especially where loyalty is emphasised: cf. Hdt. 1.151.3 xfjai Sè XoiTcfjai TcóXiai ëaSe Koivfjlcoai ërceaGai xfj dv oďtoi è^riyécovrai, 6.74.1 ÂXXouç te ôpicouç Trpoadyov a(pi fļ pèv I'|/ea0ai a&lt;peaç aire© xfj Sv è^r|yfjxai. Such an oath suits the comités Catulli, who are ready to go with him anywhere in the footsteps of Crassus and Caesar; quacumque points to the alternative destinations suggested in the first three stanzas of the poem (sive... sive... seu... sive... sive). The poet asks of his comrades not so much endurance as versatility (cf. temptare ), as emerges in particular from the nature of their mission. This idea is supported by quacumque better than by quaecumque or quodcumque.</page><page sequence="5">96 R.G.M. NISBET O colonia, quae cupis ponte ludere longo, et salire paratům habes, sed vereris inepta crura ponticuli axulis stantis in redivivis, ne supinus eat cavaque in palude recumbat. 17.1-4 redivivus is applied by Cicero and Vitruvius to building-stone that has been re- used. Editors quote Festus 334 L. (= 273 M.) 'ex vetusto renovatunť, but this gives the wrong emphasis for our passage; Catullus should say nothing to suggest that the bridge is as good as new. Yet the word by origin probably means 'cast-off (cf. reduviae of the skin of a snake), and does not necessarily imply later use.13 In the fourth century A.D. it was falsely connected with a second life, but it cannot be demonstrated that this implication was felt as early as Catullus. But even if redivivis cannot be proved wrong, recidivis might be considered.14 This word came to be applied to a new growth (apparently because of the agricultural recidiva semina ), but in origin it was derived from cadere (like cadivus). In our passage 'back-sliding' makes an effective contrast with stantis ; it also leads to supinus and recumbat (as Professor Kenney observes). Niall Rudd has convincingly suggested that Catullus gives the bridge anthropomorphic features that match the physical decrepitude15 of his victim. redivivis does nothing to help this association (and if connected with vivus would be an actual hindrance): recidivis on the other hand would strongly reinforce it. The change would be minimal even in an author with a sounder manuscript tradition. cartae regiae, nove (novi cod det.) libri, novi umbilici, lora rubra, membranae, derecta plumbo et pumice omnia aequata. 22.6-8 novi libri is too unspecific compared with the other items (of course the publication was new), and the comprehensive term should not come second on the list. Kroll saw the difficulty but lamely commented 'ohne den Verszwang hätte C. sie vor den chart ae regiae genannt'. Attempts to explain libri as a genitive are equally futile. Read bibli; Catullus is describing royal sheets of new papyrus (genitive). The word is first attested in Latin a century later (Luc. 3.222-3 'nondum flumineas Memphis contexere biblos noverat'); but as the Greek term was a natural one for the book-trade, there is no difficulty about its use in this informal poem. As biblus was feminine (like ßtißXog), V's nove (the medieval spelling of novae) is now seen to be correct. Alternatively it has been suggested to me that one might interpret novae bibli as a nominative; a series of short parallel phrases is thus produced, and novae exactly</page><page sequence="6">NOTES ON THE TEXT OF CATULLUS 97 balances novi in the next line. On the other hand biblus refers primarily to the material rather than the book ( TLL II 1959.5 ff.), and the plural at this date might suggest papyrus stalks (as in Lucan, loc. cit.); it is only much later that one finds glosses like bibli libri ( CGL IV 601.2). Moreover, if novae bibli is part of the first phrase, the contrast with 5 palimpsesto is much sharper (I owe this point to Professor Kirk). Certainly it would be impossible to take cartae regiae as genitive and novae bibli as nominative: the word-order is not easily justified and in the present context far too misleading. Catullus nowhere else ends a scazon with a word like libri, where the spondee is only produced by an artificial lengthening before mute and liquid; on the other hand bl lengthens automatically at its rare occurrences in classical Latin,16 as it normally does in Greek.17 But no canon can be established even for Republican poets (cf. Matius, fr. 12 iabra conserens labris'), and there are several instances of artificial lengthening at the ends of Martial's scazons (including 10.100.2 libro). There is less ambiguity in Greek scazons, as the Ionic of Hipponax usually lengthens before mute and liquid; in this he is followed by Callimachus and to a considerable extent by Herodas.18 Poetae tenero, meo sodali, velim Caecilio, papyre, dicas Veronám veniat, Novi relinquens Comi moenia Lariumque litus. 5 nam quasdam volo cogitationes amici accipiat sui meique. 35.1-6 6 amici mei is explained in two ways. Some think that it refers to Catullus himself; but though Horace calls himself noster in the sense of 'our hero' ( Serm . 2.6.48), 'my friend' cannot possibly mean 'me', especially where it adds nothing to the straightforward amici sui. Others argue that Catullus is referring to some unnamed third party, whose identity will be obvious to Caecilius. This is to ignore the conventions of this type of poetry, which in spite of its air of intimacy is written for a public audience: it would be inartistic in the extreme to introduce an unintelligible allusion that is not elucidated in the rest of the poem. I suggest sui tuique ; authors are notoriously well-disposed to their own writings, and Catullus is addressing his poem as if it were a human intermediary (cf. Cic. AttA.2.5 'interventu Varronis tui nostrique'). I have also considered tui suique, which gives the more conventional word-order, but the greater courtesy is due to Caecilius, the real recipient of the poem. After amici has preceded, sui is the expected possessive and tui a humorous climax. It does not seem to have been noticed that Ausonius begins a poetical letter in</page><page sequence="7">98 R.G.M. NISBET similar terms: 'perge, o libelle, Sirmium et die ero meo ac tuo ave atque salve plurimum' {Epist. 16.2.1-3 Schenkl = 12 p.239 Peiper). The recipient of this poem, the magnificent Sex. Petronius Probus (cos. 371), 19 was 'a luminary of literature and oratory',20 the addressee of the Ora Maritima of Avienius and of half-a-dozen letters from Symmachus (1.56-61), the part-author of a book of verse dedicated to Theodosius {Anth. Lat. 1.783), the father of the Probinus and Olybrius who were celebrated in Claudian's first poem (1.31-60). An inscription from Verona suggests that this was his native city;21 when the Historia Augusta describes how the descendants of the Emperor Probus 'vel odio vel invidiae timore Romanam rem fugerunt et in Italia circa Veronám ac Benacum et Larium atque in his regionibus larem locaverunť {Prob. 24.1), this is clearly an attempt to flatter the Probi of the writer's own day.22 A man with the Veronese origin and literary tastes of Petronius Probus must have been alert to see allusions to Catullus; if he had estates at Lakes Benacus and Larius that would increase his awareness (the reference to his headquarters at Sirmium might even make a playful contrast with Sirmio). Both Catullus and Ausonius ask the personified poem to carry a message to a friend {dicas, die), and both use two possessive pronouns to express the friendly relationship. Ausonius has capped his model23 by showing the deference due to the great Probus ('ero meo ac tuo'), but there would be no point in the imitation if Catullus had been referring to a totally irrelevant third party. non tuus levis in mala deditus vir adultera procatur pia persequens 100 a tuis teneris volet secubare papillis. 61.97-101 In line 99 Calphurnius proposed probra turpia, and this has generally been found acceptable, turpia is certain, probra less so. The word can of course mean not just 'reproaches' but 'acts worthy of reproach' (like ôveiSq), but the extended sense does not suit all contexts equally well (a general principle that we have already met at 2.5 desiderio), probra turpia persequens would naturally suggest not a career of dishonour but a morbid delight in receiving insults or a thorough-going search for rude expressions; though Catullus himself says 'a turpi mentem inhibere probro' (91.4), that phrase is unambiguous. The possible neuter plurals cannot be many, facta would be feeble; furta is better,24 but perhaps too euphemistic for turpia and persequens. The plain- spokenness of stupra would suit; the word is not too low in style nor Horace's Odes (4.5.21) and Ovid's Metamorphoses (2.529), and the assonance with turpia is forceful rather than clumsy.</page><page sequence="8">NOTES ON THE TEXT OF CATULLUS 99 But how can the corruption be explained? proca might be derived from the end of stupra , but the loss of letters at the beginning of the line seems curious. Or perhaps stupra turpia was read as stupratur pia' then somebody might have interpolated the innocuous and unmetrical procatur pia, 'the pious woman is courted' (cf. CIL XIII 7550 'ille te sponsus procať). But an interpolator so well-intentioned and so muddled is more likely to have been medieval than ancient, and such a person would not readily have thought of procare with the accusative. So the safest course is to obelize proca. quae tuo veniunt ero, 110 quanta gaudia, quae vaga nocte, quae medio die gaudeat! sed abit dies: prodeas nova nupta. 61.109-13 There are two things wrong with this passage: medio belongs to a different category from vaga, and die is pointlessly picked up by dies. Both faults can be cured by changing medio to emerito,15 'when the day has done his work'. For this use of the word cf. Ov. Fast. 4.688 'dempserat emeritis iam iuga Phoebus equis', Stat. Theb. 1.336-7 'emeriti ... Phoebi'; at Sen. Ag. 908-9 'stat ecce Titan dubius emerito die suane currat an Thyestea via' Tarrant proposes e medio die, the reverse of what is suggested here. For the strong elision 'quae emerito' cf. 130 'hodie atque heri', 165 'Tyrio in toro', 215 'Manlio et'. emerito, with its suggestion of doing a stint and getting an honourable discharge, is contrasted with the flightiness of vagabond night. The second relative clause now refers to the same period as the first, but by way of climax hints that the hour is near; the point is then brought out explicitly by abit dies. Editors assume that Catullus is talking about love-making in the siesta (Cat. 32, 0 v. Am. 1.5), but a reference to the coming night is better suited to the genre; Paris in Iliad 3 might be guilty of such behaviour (Plut. Quaest. Conv. 655a còç ouk àvôpòç àXXà poisou Xvggí ovtoç oĎaav Ti)v ps0r||iepivi)v áicpaoíav), but it has no place in an epithalamium. In a serious celebration of married love, day must first run its course: 'Now welcome night, thou night so long expected, That long daies labour doest at last defray'.26 ut aput nivem et ferarum gelida stabula forem, et earum omnia adirem furibunda latibula. 63.53-4 The two ionics a minore at the beginning of 54 have no anaclasis; though this rhythm is possible in galliambics, there is no other instance in this poem. What is</page><page sequence="9">100 R.G.M. NISBET more, omnia is pointless in itself: why should Attis tour all the lairs? L. Mueller's opaca heals both these faults but leaves a third: earum is avoided in verse27 (except in Lucretius and Horace's satires), and here seems too emphatic. For earum omnia I have tentatively considered (h)arundinosa' in all Latin this word occurs only at 36.13 'Cnidumque harundinosam'. For reeds as a lair cf. Claud. 24.305-6 'defensus arundine Rheni vastus aper'; Sinon and Moses used similar hide-outs. There is no serious objection to reeds on Ida, which was a large area with many fountains; Catullus below associates it with the 'aper nemorivagus' (72). Yet I feel some difficulty about the lack of a genitive; as 53 fer arum belongs only to the second member, it seems unnatural to continue its influence. We are now threatened by a real dilemma: the absence of earum is as objectionable as its presence. But perhaps Attis is going not to the animals' lairs but to his own; adire sometimes suggests boldness, but not necessarily so here. In view of the feminine adjective it makes more sense if he is not too adventurous in approaching wild animals' dens (53 may simply mean 'make my home in the snow and the cold country inhabited by beasts'). But this interpretation may be incompatible with furibunda, which suggests manic behaviour; the word is used at 31 of the earlier phase before Attis has seen the light. As fugibunda is not attested one might consider something like tremibunda (note the preceding -irem). ego gymnasi fui (sui X) fios, ego eram decus olei. 63.64 The change of tense from fui to eram is wasteful and meaningless (see Baehrens); it is no use quoting instances of tense-variation where the verb also changes. The alliterative fui fios is so crisp and satisfying that one turns one's first attention to eram ; but no suitable substitute presents itself (the i of (h)eri is of too indeterminate a quantity to be allowed in this position). Baehrens proposed mei for fui, but this lacks edge; Nencini's tui is worse. I have considered prius but prefer suus ('the very own flower'). If that is right, it would mean that X's sui was the reading of V; for the familiar confusion of s and / cf. 14.16, 68.79, 68.130. roseis ut hinc labellis sonitus ... adiit geminas deorum ad aures nova nuntia referens ... 63.74-5 adiit does not explain the case of labellis and is uneconomical with 75 ad ; it was emended by the Itali to abiit. Bentley's supplement citus is palaeographically neat, but would suit the arrival of the news (he retained adiit) better than its departure (Attis is not wishing to be heard); from this point of view Ahlwardt's vagus or Giri's</page><page sequence="10">NOTES ON THE TEXT OF CATULLUS 101 miser (balancing 49 miseriter) might be an improvement. For V's impossible hinc the Itali proposed both huic and hie (nominative); the latter avoids the slight clumsiness of huic labellis ('minus onerat constructionem' Baehrens). deorum presents a more interesting puzzle; the only god in question is Cybele. For the generalising plural editors quote 63.68 'ego nunc deum ministra et Cybeles famula ferar?' (where see Friedrich's note); the masculine is used in such plurals even where a woman is meant. The usage is discreet and euphemistic (as people say 'headquarters' when they mean 'the boss'), but the plural remains a plural; in the absence of further specification the gods' two ears come in very awkwardly. Lachmann proposed 'geminas matris ad aures'; but Cybele was not Attis's mother, and ionics without anaclasis are attested in the poem only at the corrupt 54 (see above). Ahlwardt proposed 'matris deorum ad aures'; but the double genitive sounds clumsy, and geminas is convincingly paralleled. In place of deorum we need another elided bacchius, but a suitable genitive singular in - ae is not easily found (Munro's deae tarn and Riese's deae turn are best forgotten). The difficulty would be diminished, even if not removed, by reading erorum (or herorum, as the word would be spelt in this tradition); Catullus calls Cybele an era at lines 18 and 92. Plura eri of a singular mistress is much easier than plural dei of a singular goddess: the former, unlike the latter, describes a relationship to Attis, and so defines precisely who is meant. 'Plural for singular' is particularly well attested with words referring to the family (thus liberi is often found of a single child);28 for 'masters' cf. Eur. Hipp. 287 oia rcéípuKa SooTU/ouai 8ea7cóxaiç (Phaedra), Med. 61, Andr. 391. See especially Cat. 68.75-8 'inceptam frustra, nondum cum sanguine sacro hostia caelestis pacificasset eros, nil mihi tam valde placeat, Ramnusia virgo, quod temere invitis suscipiatur eris'; here eros may refer not to the gods of marriage (as editors assume), but be a sinister euphemism for Venus herself. The legend is not elucidated precisely elsewhere, but Eustathius mentions Aphrodite's later anger (II. 2.700, p.325). dona ferunt prae se, declarant gaudia vultu. 35 deseritur fsiros (syros X), linquunt Pthiotica Tempe Crannonisque domos ac moenia Larisaea, Pharsalum coeunt, Pharsalia tecta fréquentant. 64.34-7 siros was changed in the fifteenth century to Scyros, and by Meineke to Cieros' the former has recently been championed by G. Giangrande.29 But in this carefully structured passage the passive deseritur also requires scrutiny; the variation of voice in 32-3 and 38-40 (cited below) is not a defence. We look for a word to balance linquunt exactly, just as ferunt prae se balances declarant, and coeunt balances fréquentant. Perhaps one might try destituunt with an accusative place-name; a verb</page><page sequence="11">102 R.G.M. NISBET for 'leaving in the lurch' is acceptable in a context that goes on to describe the abandonment of agriculture. If a syllable was left out, deseritur might seem the easiest way of restoring the metre. rura colit nemo, mollescunt colla iuvencis, non humilis curvis purgatur vinea rastris, 40 non glebam prono convellit vomere taurus, non faix atténuât frondatorum arboris umbram, squalida desertis rubigo infertur aratris. 64.38-42 This description owes its beauty to a wonderfully precise series of verbs: mollescunt, purgatur, convellit, attenuai. The positive infertur in the last line should mark the climax, but it seems by comparison vague and inert. Commentators see a military metaphor, which might cohere with 'desertis, but one would prefer something that reinforces squalida rubigo by appealing to the eye or the touch. Perhaps increscit would suggest the required scaliness; cf. O v. Met. 4. 577 'durataeque cuti squamas increscere sentit'. sic nimis insultans extremo tempore saeva fors etiam nostris invidit questibus auris. 64.169-70 saeva is taken as an attributive adjective with fors. But the participial clause must make a colon, and if it includes fors, the break then comes at a very awkward place. By Virgilian canons it would be illegitimate for an adjective at the end of one line to be followed by its monosyllabic noun at the beginning of the next, especially where this in turn is followed by a pause. It is not clear that in this end-stopped poem the practice of Catullus was very different. To meet the difficulty one might try to take saeva with insultans ; but though 'arduus insurgens' (Virg .Aen. 1 1.755) is a familiar poetic locution,30 the word-order insultans ... saeva causes serious doubts. It would perhaps be a little easier if we took nimis closely with the adjective; for this hyperbaton cf. Cic. De Or. 2.288 'sed haec ipsa nimis mihi videor in multa genera digessisse', Pis. 17 'cui nimis videtur senātus in conservanda patria fuisse crudelis'.31 If saeva still seems too difficult, the problem could be solved by reading saeve (to be taken closely with nimis); Catullus uses adverbs more freely than later poets. The conventional view of our passage may seem to be supported by 64.246-7 'sic funesta domus ingressus tecta paterna morte ferox Theseus' (where Kroll compares 'saeva / fors')32. But though morte does not present the particular difficulty of a monosyllable followed by a pause, its juxtaposition with ferox produces an</page><page sequence="12">NOTES ON THE TEXT OF CATULLUS 103 unfortunate ambiguity. There is something to be said for the idea of Marcilius, who read paternae (with domus) and Marte (with ferox); for the latter collocation cf. Ov.

Baehrens proposed celsis, which is very close to cesis. The word seems too grand for heaps of bodies, but the grandeur might be suitably ironic; the variation to alta in the next line is justifiable, as the deep gore would correspond to the high heaps. It might be objected that celsis is infelicitously repeated at 363 'cum teres excelso coacervatum aggere bustum'; but Achilles' own tomb could appropriately recall his mounds of dead (thus acervis is picked up by coacervatum). Yet I should prefer densis ( dèsis ), which would refer to the same dimension as angustans and a different one from alta (rather than the other way round), densas... aristas has already occurred at 353, but in this sinister incantation there is an effective repetition of key words (to be distinguished from the banality of caesis ... caede in one sentence): cf. corpora (355, 359), caede (360, 368), acervis ( see above). For the gruesome scene cf. Juv. 10.185-6 'cruentis fluctibus ac tarda per densa cadavera prora'. saepe in letifero belli certamine Mavprs 395 aut rapidi Tritonis era aut Amarunsia virgo armatas hominum est praesens hortata catervas. 64.394-6 rapidi is conspicuously unsuited to the Libyan Lake Triton, which is described as a marsh by Lucan (9.343) and the elder Pliny (5.28).

In that case Catullus is indulging a perverse Alexandrian taste for obscure variations on familiar legends.</page><page sequence="13">104 R.G.M. NISBET But the poet is more concerned with the prowess of Athene than with the torrents of Boeotia: perhaps he wrote rapida (nominative).34 The adjective is not used of fleet-footed people, but the case is different with the onrush of a goddess; in particular it might represent Ooõpiç, which is applied by Homer to the aegis, and by Nonnus to Athene herself (Dion. 48.799). The lengthening of the final syllable before a mute and liquid in the following word might be defended as an imitation of Greek heroic poetry (note the proper name); it is otherwise attested in Catullus only in pure iambics (4.9, 4.18, 29.4), though similar lengthening before sp- and st- is found in grander poems (63.53, 64.186). Yet as the irregularity was exposed to corruption it is also worth citing 63.50 'patria o mei creatrix, patria o mea genetrix'; here mea creatrix (A. Guarinus) produces a variation in prosody35 that is much more elegant than the variation in syntax. ignaro mater substernens se impia nato impia non verità est divos scelerare penates. 64.403-4 Editors decline to punctuate, with good reason. Kroll talks of the epanalepsis of impia, but one would like to see another place where an adjective in a participial clause is repeated with the main verb. Alternatively we could put commas after nato and the second impia' but though the epanalepsis is now cured, the adjective is separated from the clause with which it should be particularly associated. Perhaps the first impia should be changed to improba (abbreviation of pro might have helped the corruption); for confusion between the two words see TLL VII 620. 65. At 14.7 'qui tantum tibi misit impiorum' there might be something to be said for improborum. Editors see a contrast with pii vates , but instead of this artificial joke one expects a more general word for rascals. estne novis nuptis odio Venus? anne parentum frustrantur falsis gaudia lacrimulis, ubertim thalami quas intra limina fundunt? non, ita me divi, vera gemunt, iuerint. 66.15-18 Perhaps brides spoil their parents' joy by only pretending to cry. But the parents cannot be disappointed unless they witness their daughter's tears; and they are not present in the bridal bedroom, where the tears are shed. It is no use saying that their happiness is in some ideal sense nullified by matters outside their knowledge; /ató implies deception (the text is supported by vera below), and in the context the persons deceived can only be the parents. Friedrich saw the difficulty, and came up with a characteristic answer.

Baehrens had given a terser solution: 'intra, dum limen supergredi verentur'. But intra limina cannot mean 'in the doorway'; a Roman limen was such a physical and psychological barrier that the phrase can only mean 'inside the room', extra is one's first thought, but not necessarily the right one. Perhaps Catullus wrote citra limina (cf. Ov. Met. 7.238 'constitit adveniens citra limenque forisque'): brides weep on this side of the threshold, but no farther. namque ego non ullo vera timore tegam, nec si me infestis discerpent sidera dictis, condita quin (qui V) vere pectoris evoluam. 66.72-4 vere is not an adverb naturally found with evolvere , which is not primarily a verb of speaking. So editors accept the early conjecture veri , but that still involves an imprecision that seems uncharacteristic of Catullus. Doubts about both vere and veri are greatly increased by the occurrence of vera two lines above; this circumstance diminishes the force of the parallels at 64.198 'quae (querellae) quoniam verae nascuntur pectore ab imo', Lucr. 3.57-8 'nam verae voces turn demum pectore ab imo eliciuntuť. These passages might rather suggest imi in Catullus (which also suits condita and evoluam)', if quin imi was conflated to qui, the transmitted reading, then vere might have been interpolated to restore the metre. When a constellation called 'Coma' talks about its pectus, the absurdity must be intentional, and this would be underlined by imi. quod cum ita sit, nolim statuas nos mente maligna id facere aut animo non satis ingenuo, quod tibi non utriusque petenti copia posta est: 40 ultro ego deferrem, copia siqua foret. 68.37-40 39 utriusque is supposed to refer back to 10 'muneraque et Musarum hinc petis et Veneris'. But the gifts of the Muses and Venus are one and the same; Catullus is not being asked to provide a poem and a girl (he cannot do the latter from Verona), but to write something serious and beautiful about life and love (such as 68 in fact is).36 But if only one gift is involved, utriusque becomes very difficult; Catullus cannot be humorously distinguishing the two aspects of his friend's hendiadys, as it came too far back for the reference to be intelligible. I suggest hucusque,31 'up till now'.</page><page sequence="15">106 R.G.M. NISBET 39 copia also seems a little strange; one would expect a contrast between the larger stock on which Catullus might draw (40), 48 and the particular specimens that he selects for his friend. I have considered exempla ( exepla is not too far from copia , given the appearance of the latter word twice in the context and the common confusion of e and o in this tradition). We now need an active verb to replace posta est (which has rightly been doubted even with copia ); I prefer paravi to posivi (if exempla was once corrupted, re- writing was necessary to save the sense and metre). That gives us 'quod tibi non hucusque petenti exempla paravi'; I should also prefer nulla for non, though one must feel some diffidence about changing four words in the line. non possum reticere, deae, qua me Allius in re iuverit, aut quantis iuverit officiis. 68.41-2 Baehrens and Kroll defended the repetition of iuverit , but Riese more plausibly looked for a change of verb; Cornelissen proposed foverit in the second clause.39 Without knowing of this conjecture, Ellis in his Oxford text records a possible imitation in Agius, Epicedium Hathumodae (A.D. 874) 73-4: vos melius nostis quanto me semper amore, quantis incolumis foverit officiis. Cornelissen was not aware of this passage when he made his conjecture, and the resemblance is regarded as simply a coincidence by Traube in his text of Agius.40 But foverit suits admirably the context of Catullus: after the severely objective iuverit the poet describes more warmly the kindnesses of his friend. Agius surely deserves further investigation. In fact his elegy includes other parallels to Catullus 68 that are not noticed by Traube or Ellis: Agius 57-8 quae nostrae dulcedo simul vel gloria vitae in qua sunt una perdita tanta bona? Cat. 68.158 a quo sunt primo |omnia41 nata bona (bono V). Agius 71-2 nam minime, veluti est dignum, nunc dicere possum quanta ego vobiscum commoda perdiderim. Cat. 68.21-3 tu mea tu moriens fregisti commoda, frater, tecum una tota est nostra sepulta domus, omnia tecum una perierunt gaudia nostra. As the three parallels occur within twenty lines of Agius and a single poem of Catullus, they cannot be brushed aside as a coincidence, or even as commonplaces</page><page sequence="16">NOTES ON THE TEXT OF CATULLUS 107 of the genre; so Cornelissen's forgotten foverit should be put in the text. The abbess Hathumoda and the Epicurean 'Allius' must have cherished their friends in very different ways, but the vox humana survived the centuries: 'sed dicam vobis, vos porro dicite multis'. Agius42 was a monk at Corvey on the Weser, and his knowledge of Catullus 68 raises questions that I am unable to answer. The codex Thuaneus (Paris, lat. 8071), which contains poem 62 among miscellaneous other authors, was written in France in the ninth century. It was copied from the manuscript now identified as Vind. lat. 277, 43 which is known mainly for Grattius and th z Haliéutica, this was written in the eighth or ninth century, probably in France but possibly in Germany.44 The latter manuscript was brought from France by Sannazaro about 1502 (possibly 'e Turonibus'),45 and B.L. Ullman46 sees a possible descent from a book of verse lent by Gregory of Tours to Venantius Fortunatus between 573 and 576 ( Carm . 5.8b); he compares Carm. 6.10.6 'per hiulcatos fervor anhelat agros' with Cat. 68.62 'aestus hiulcat agros' (interestingly from the very poem under discussion). He mentions some fainter resemblances to Catullus in Carolingian writers; most of these are worth nothing,47 but in view of the evidence from Agius one cannot disregard the similarity of Cat. 40.5 'an ut pervenias in ora vulgi?' and Heiric, Allocutio ad librum 29 'et ni proripias in ora vulgi' (Poet. Lat. Aev. Car. Ill 437). This passage suggests that acquaintance with Catullus, in however limited a sense, might have extended beyond poems 62 and 68, and Ullman believes that the Veronensis itself came from Northern Europe. nec tenuem texens sublimis aranea telam in deserto Alii nomine opus faciat. 68.49-50 Spiders spin their webs in the rafters; commentators cite Hes. Op. Ill àspai7iÓTT|TOç àpá/vriç, Ov. Am. 1.14.7-8 'vel pede quod gracili deducit aranea filum cum leve deserta sub trabe nectit opus' (note especially deserta). Yet the picture in Catullus is unclear: imagines were displayed in the atrium where they became black with soot (Cic. Pis. 1), but there seems to be no evidence that they were stored in the roof. Fordyce talks of an abandoned monument (cf. Prop. 2.6.35 'velavit aranea fanum'), but it is awkward to think in our passage of a lofty edifice; the tomb of Caecilia Metella has suffered little from the ravages of spiders. And besides encouraging too visual an interpretation, sublimis is too grand48 a word to be used naturally of the insect. I propose subtilis. The word suits 'the spider's touch, how exquisitely fine', especially as it is etymologically connected with tela ; the words in the line now reinforce each other in a manner familiar from Catullus 64. It is a commonplace that time works its attrition through slight but persistent agencies; cf. Lucr. 1.326</page><page sequence="17">108 R.G.M. NISBET 'vesco sale saxa peresa', Ov. A.A. 1.473 'ferreus adsiduo consumitur anulus usu'. This notion is found in the corresponding passage at the end of our poem (149-52): 'hoc tibi, quod potui, confectum carmine munus pro multis, Alii, redditur officiis [cf. 42 officiis], ne vestrum scabra tangat rubigine nomen haec atque illa dies atque alia atque alia', subtilis would suggest something of the same idea: the spider, like rust and time, does ill by stealth. qualis in aerii perlucens vertice montis rivus muscoso prosilit e lapide, qui cum de prona praeceps est valle volutus 60 per medium densi49 transit iter populi, dulce viatori salso50 (basso V) in sudore levamen cum gravis exustos aestus hiulcat agros. 68.57-62 perlucens normally means 'transparent', but this is not the conventional epithet of a mountain torrent (note vertice ); Baehrens explains the word as limpidus , but this blurs the precision of the prefix. Ellis talks of the glimmer of the rivulet and compares SiayXauaasiv, but per - cannot mean 'between' where no background is specified; the OLD cites Plin. Nat. 18.358 'cum carbo vehementer perluceť, but that passage refers to incandescence. I suggest praelucens, 'shining out'; the word is used absolutely at Sen. Cont. 1.6.4 'auro puro fulgens praelucet Capitolium'. prae - is better suited than per - to the scale of landscape implied by vertice ; Baehrens comments 'si de aquis longe splendentibus cogitandum esset, flagitaretur verbum simplex lucens' but he does not consider changing the compound. It may not be necessary to alter in to ab, as Catullus is mentally up the mountain and not looking at it from miles away; this is shown by the detail of muscoso ... lapide. The simile and its successor (on deliverance from storm) go primarily with what follows (the relief provided by Allius), not with what precedes (Catullus's tears); the two images are combined by earlier poets51 in similar contexts (a good case to remember when people doubt the relevance of parallels). But the analogy extends beyond levamen to the whole situation: prosilit and praeceps suggest a friend bounding forward (cf. 65.22 'dum adventu matris prosilit') and rushing to the rescue; salso in sudore (if Baehrens's conjecture is right) would answer to 56 tristi imbre (of the poet's salt tears); gravis aestus and exustos not only recall the elegists' comparison of love and heat, but correspond to the earlier description of Catullus's own burning (52 torruerit, 53 arderem, 54 Thermopyliś). In this sequence praelucens has a function that perlucens lacks: Allius's unexpected offer flashes out like a mountain cataract with the first promise of relief.</page><page sequence="18">NOTES ON THE TEXT OF CATULLUS 109 hune metuunt omneš, ñeque mirum: nam mala valde est bestia, nec quicum bella puella eubet. quare aut crudelem nasorum interfice pestem, aut admirari desine cur fugiant. 69.7-10 hunc is Rufus's smell of goat. Catullus plays on the two meanings of hircus by regarding it as a real animal: it lives valle sub alarum , it is called trux caper , mala bestia , crudelem pestem (like some monstrous creature of legend), everybody fears it and runs from it, no pretty girl could sleep with it. interfice may seem to sustain the image, but so unequivocal a word is awkwardly juxtaposed with nasorum : the former suits only the goat, the latter only the smell. Ellis, who seems to sense the problem, points out that the verb can be applied to bread (Lucil. 1157 M.) and harvests (Virg. G. 4.330), but 'kill that smell' was surely not a Latin locution. Perhaps inter cipe might be considered; it primarily suggests cutting off the smell, but could also be used euphemistically of eliminating the beast (cf. Colum. 9.3.4 of bees 'saepe morbis intercipiuntur'). Catullus affects a concern for the public at large (7 metuunt omnesf 10 fugiant ), but is actuated by sexual jealousy (cf. 1-4); there is still much to be said for the view that he is addressing Caelius Rufus.52 He has no wish to cure his rival's alleged complaint, but only to see that he breaks off physical contact with the one puella Who matters. aemulus iste tuus, qui vestrum exercet amorem, mirifice est a te nactus utrumque malum. 71.3-4 Catullus is talking about the gout and disagreeable smell of an unnamed friend's unnamed rival. 4 ate must be corrupt: the complaints in question are not infectious. Schoell53 solved the problem by apte ( abte might be the intermediate stage); Catullus goes on to explain why the punishment fits the crime, mirifice would be used with another adverb like Gaupaaícoç còç. Line 3 is also difficult. The successful rival may be said to 'carry on' the loyeafíair that belongs to the loser, but plural vestrum (which naturally includes the lady) is incompatible with this interpretation. Nor is it convincing to take vestrum as equivalent to tuum' though this very rare usage is attested in Catullus,54 it is confusing so soon after tuus in a context where a woman is also involved. Because of these difficulties Kroll asked whether exercet might mean 'disturbs'; but in a poem about rivalry it obviously refers to a take-over. nostrum is an early conjecture (the corrector of G); ñrm and ūrm are easily confused (cf. 26.1, 55.22). But this does little good unless we also emend tuus to meus ; the former might well have been interpolated after nostrum had been corrupted to vestrum and apte to a te. The rival is presumably Rufus, who is reviled</page><page sequence="19">110 R.G.M. NISBET in similar terms in 69; as sometimes happens elsewhere, a pair of parallel poems is separated by one on a different subject. If Catullus is writing about himself, that explains why he is so virulent, and why the poem has no addressee. credo, sic mater, sic liber avunculus eius, sic maternus avus dixerat atque avia. 84.5-6 liber is hard to justify as an attributive adjective referring to a social status; libertinus would be expected. And though allegations of servile origin are common in invective, they are not made so circuitously; what is said about the uncle is too obscure to be an acknowledged fact and too indirect to be a malicious fiction. Catullus neither knows nor cares about the maternal relatives of Arrius, but he supposes with some confidence {credo) that they all spoke alike. He concentrates on the mother's line (as happens elsewhere in invective) because of its greater obscurity; it is quite wrong to quote Cicero on the conservatism of women's speech. The same line of argument can be used against any adjective that differentiates the uncle from the rest of the family. If he was a gibber or hunchback, Catullus would not have known, and the insult diverts us from the uniformity of the family in the only circumstance that matters. If he was a Cimber (Heinsius) or an Umber (Riese), it is not clear why the grandparents were not; special circumstances might exist in a particular case, but these would be unfamiliar and irrelevant. An durò Koivoõ construction is equally impossible: such artificialities do not suit the simplicity of a lampoon, and even the most mannered poet would not give the adjective to the second item in a sequence of four. If this reasoning is correct, the missing word describes neither a particular characteristic of the uncle nor a general characteristic of the family. Therefore it is not an adjective at all. It cannot be a noun, pronoun, preposition, conjunction, interjection, or verb (for dixit would be fatuous). It must surely be an adverb; there is no artificiality now about an ànò koivou construction. Wick proposed libere, which makes no sense and produces an unconvincing elision. I suggest semper, a word natural in invective and particularly so here: the family were all alike in their misuse of aspirates, and this misuse was persistent. Zmyrna fcanas Satrachi penitus mittetur ad undas, Zmyrnam cana diu saecula pervoluent. 95 5 6 The unmetrical can as was altered to cavas in the fifteenth century; the conjecture has proved generally acceptable, but the parallels are less satisfactory than is supposed. The adjective can refer to engulfing waters (cf. 17.4 'cavaque in palude</page><page sequence="20">NOTES ON THE TEXT OF CATULLUS 1 1 1 recumbať), but such a notion is irrelevant here: Cinna's poem is not going to be thrown in. When Virgil says 'cava ilumina' (G. 1.326), he is describing hollow river-beds; but while flumina can include the banks, undae cannot. Ovid says 'qua cava de Stygiis fluxerat unda vadis' (Ibis 226), but that water flows from underground. Lucan says 'dexteriora petens montis declivia Thybrim unda facit Rutubamque cavum' (2.421-2), but there the adjective suggests the channel of a mountain torrent. On the other hand the actual appearance of the Cypriot Satrachus is irrelevant, as neither Catullus nor his readers can have known a thing about it. canas has clearly jumped from the line below, and in such circumstances palaeographic considerations should not be given undue weight. The right adjective should support the thought rather than appeal to the eye; picturesque detail is out of place in an epigram of this kind, brevis might give a possible sort of sense; there would then be a contrast between the great masterpiece and the small river. I suggest rather suas , which goes better with penitus : the poem will be sent even to the exotic places from which Zmyrna herself came. Parthenius mentioned the river (Etym. Gen. s.v. 'Aôoç), and his influence on Cinna is established:55 the Zmyrna must have described the stream, suas would underline the compliment; the degree of emphasis imposed by the hyperbaton is now seen to have point. Anybody who tries to emend the text of Catullus will sometimes find that others have been there first. A few such conjectures may be worth reviving, particularly if they are in danger of disappearing from view. I give first the reading of V, but have sometimes modified it to include agreed corrections. 51.9-10 'tenuis sub artus fiamma demanať: dimanat Statius ( tenuis and sub suit the idea of diffusion). 61.125-7 'satis diu lusisti nucibus: lubet iam servire Talasio': punctuate after lusisti with Owen, CR 4 (1890) 312 (nuts cannot symbolise immaturity as well as fertility), and read iuvet with Busche, NJPhP 149 ( 1 894) 395 (the concubinus is not in the least pleased). 63.5 'devolsit iletas acuto sibi pondera silice': ieta Statius. 63.85 'ferus ipse sese adhortans rapidům incitât animo': combine Schwabe's rabidum (the words are virtually interchangeable) with animum of the Itali (sese goes well only with adhortans). 64. 108-9 'ilia procul radicitus exturbata prona cadit': exstirpata ed.

Liv. 22.48.4 'inter acervos caesorum corporum'. 34. I cannot trace the source of this conjecture, but doubt whether it is my own. 35. See Nisbet and Hubbard on Hor. Carm. 1.32.11, with bibliography there cited. 36. The poem is probably addressed to L. Manlius Torquatus, praetor 49 {RE XI V 1203-7); 'Allius' in the more public second part would then be a 'cover-name'. Hortensius described Torquatus as ôpouaoç àvcuppóôixoç ànpoaôióvoaoç (Gell. 1.5.3); this may be the rebuttal of some claim of his own to be a</page><page sequence="23">1 14 R.G.M. NISBET protégé of Venus and the Muses (Gellius's comment, subagresti ... ingenio, is an unlikely story about the Torquatus of the De Finibus ). Cf. also 61.191-2 'neque te Venus neglegiť. 37. After writing this article I found that Weber (cited in Merrill's Teubner edition) had proposed non ulla usque. But it is more courteous for Catullus to mention his own failure 'so far' ( hucusque ) rather than his friend's continuing entreaties {usque). 38. Cf. also 33 'nam quod scriptorum non magna est copia apud me'. This is generally taken to refer to previous scriptores, but there are advantages in thinking of Catullus's own scripta (thus Quinn); copia would then have the same reference at the beginning and end of this group of lines (33-40). 39.

Goold, Phoenix 12(1958) 108). tanta in Agius might suggest 'a quo sunt primo plurima nata bona'; plurima (which would echo 153 'hue addent divi quam plurima') could have fallen out after primo. Alternatively one could try sunt uno plurima (cf. una in Agius) or sunt primo tot mihi. 42. M. Manitius, Geschichte der lat. Lit. des Mittelalters I (191 1) 581-2, Poet. Lat. Aev. Car.

Agius, op. cit. 417, uses the word femella, which occurs in classical Latin only at Cat. 55.7; yet as Ullman points out, the word lies behind old French 'femelle' (whence 'female'). 48. See Brink on Hor. A.P. 165. 49. densi gives an odd impression of traffic-jams (as Haupt and Baehrens saw), and even multi (cf. Call. Ep. 28.2) seems unsuited to this remote highway. Perhaps Catullus wrote properi ; if the word was once corrupted to populi, anything might then have happened. 50. Editors prefer the early proposal lasso, but the elided adjective ought to combine with sudore rather than with viatori. Baehrens's salso (cf. Virg. A en. 2.173-4 'salsus ... sudor') gives a good contrast with dulce. 51. Aesch. Ag. 900-1 KdXXiaxov fjpap eiaiôeïv èK x£íHaT°Ç» óSoircópcp ôiyôvxi Ttqyaïov ^oç, Asclepiades, A.P. 5.169.1-2. 52. T.P. Wiseman, in his interesting re-appraisal of these problems, argues that the malodorous and gouty Rufus cannot be identical with a dancer as accomplished as Caelius {Cinna the poet (197 4) 106-7). Yet ancient invective sometimes derived its appeal from its inappropriateness: why was Socrates said to accept fees for his tuition? 53. NJPhP 121 (1880) 486. See now also R. A.
