<plain_text><page sequence="1">Thinking the New: Of Futures yet Unthought Elizabeth Grosz One It gives me pleasure to be here presenting a paper which is something of an announcement of future directions for my research - research on the idea of futurity itself, the notion of the emergent or the event. It is the question of the new I would like to address, however hesitatingly and schematically. I want to explore the nature of timej the precedence of the future over the present and past, and the strange vectors of becoming that a concept of new provokes. This paper will argue that unless we develop concepts of time and duration which welcome and privilege the future, which openly accept the rich virtualities and divergent resonances of the present, we will remain closed to understanding the complex processes of becoming that engender and constitute both life and matter. My project, of which this is a beginning fragment, is to think temporality and futurity, in all their richness, as modalities of difference. The concept of the new raises many anxieties. While it is clear that newness, creativity, innovation, progress are all terms deemed as social positives, the more disconcerting notion of unpredictable, disordered or uncontainable change, which lurks within the very concept of change or newness, seems to disconcert scientific, philosophical and cultural ideals of stability and control. Predictable, measured, regulated transformation seems a readily presumed social prerequisite; upheaval, the eruption of the event, the emergence of © symplokë Vol. 6, No. 1-2 (1998) ISSN 1069-0697, 38-55.</page><page sequence="2">symplokê 39 new alignments unpredicted within old networks, threatens to reverse all gains, to position progress on the edge of an abyss, to place chaos at the heart of regulation and orderly development. How is it possible to revel and delight in the indeterminacy of the future without raising the kind of panic and defensive counter-reactions that Foucault envisages a supervising, regulating power needs in order to contain unpredictability, the eruption of the event, the emergence of singularities, and the consequent realignments of power.1 This preoccupation with the new can be readily transcribed into many other terminologies, which each have their own political genealogy and their own specific anxieties. Instead of the production of the new, the concept of revolution could be substituted. Is the concept, revolution, so tied to a set of weary discourses that, within their terms, it can now only mean predictable transformation, transformation which follows a predesignated path, innovation within legitimised parameters, that is, controlled and regulated progress (whether the rule of the proletariat, the equalisation of relations between the sexes or racial integration)? Or does it involve the more disconcerting idea of i¿/ipredictable transformation - mutation, metamorphosis - upheaval in directions and arenas, with implications or consequences which cannot be known in advance? This is a most disconcerting and dangerous idea: politics seems to revel in the idea of progress, development, movement, but the very political discourses that seem to advocate it most vehemently (marxism, feminism, postcolonial and anticolonial discourses, the discourses of anti-racism) seem terrified by the idea of a transformation somehow beyond the control of the very revolutionaries who seek it, of a kind of 'anarchisation' of the future. If the revolution can carry no guarantee that it will improve the current situation or provide something preferable to what exists now, what makes it a sought-for ideal? What prevents it from blurring into fascism or conservatism? While common preoccupations of certain of the natural sciences (physics and certain branches of biology in particular), the nature of temporality or duration, the relations between past, present and future, have remained elided within the humanities and social sciences. Philosophy and cultural studies nonetheless have made a number of assumptions regarding time, movement and change. Underlying these assumptions about change are various commitments to upholding the values of predictability and stability, or else commitments to revelling in the idea of the unpredictable, that need careful analysis and reconsideration. ^ee Foucault (1972).</page><page sequence="3">40 Elizabeth Grosz Thinking the New Moreover, one cannot contain temporal conceptions to those explicitly focused on. Conceptions of each of the three temporal modalities (past, present and future in all their conjugative complexities) entail presumptions regarding the others that are often ill- or un-considered: how we understand the past, and our links to it through reminiscence, melancholy or nostalgia, prefigure and contain corresponding conceptions about the present and future; the substantiality or privilege we pragmatically grant to the present has implications for the retrievability of the past and the predictability of the future; and, depending on whether we grant to the future the supervening power to rewrite the present and past, so too we must problematise the notions of identity, origin and development. The ways in which we consider the past to be connected to and thus to live on through the present/future will have direct implications for whatever conceptions of futurity, the new, creativity, production or emergence we may want to develop. If the past constitutes a remnant, a ghost or mode of haunting of the present, this is only insofar as we can no longer consider the present itself as fully self- present. The present can be seen, through this inhabitation, which is as unavoidable as it is problematic, as a mode of differing or differentiation. This is not to suggest that the relations between the past and present, or between the present and future, that is, relations of progress or directionality, are only bound, or given their direction, by scientific laws, whether relations of causality (in classical science) or relations of statistical probability (in contemporary science). The extent to which one remains committed to determinism is precisely the degree to which one refuses the open-endedness of the future.2 In seeking an open-ended future, one is not required to affirm that misnomer, free will, but to acknowledge the capacity of any future eruption, any event, any reading, to rewrite, resignify, reframe the present. To accept the role that the accidental, chance or the undetermined play in the unfolding of time. It is this open-endedness that Derrida affirms through his understand of the power of iteration;3 and that contemporary biology has designated through the notion of emergence, which is neither free nor determined, but rather both constrained and undecidable. Moreover, it is precisely such a notion of open-endedness and of emergence that contemporary ^his position, now regarded as the causal theory of time, is committed to temporal irreversibility on the grounds of the irreversibility of causal relations, is represented perhaps most clearly in the writings of Leibniz and Kant. It is a position that has also been forwarded in the more contemporary work of Reichenbach and Carnap. See Grünbaum (1973), chapter 7, "The Causal Theory of Time." 3See Derrida (1988).</page><page sequence="4">symplokê 41 physics, especially in its flirtations with biochemistry, seems to have put in place of the emphasis on determinism so powerful in classical physics.4 And finally, it is such a notion that leads Deleuze to seek in Bergson the notion of duration or becoming, as we see shortly. What kind of difference must it be to differ not only from itself and what is other (difference as divergence, as the breakdown or failure of identity) but also to differ from its own differing: in short to diverge in (at least) two directions at once? How to think the idea of direction or trajectory without being able to anticipate a destination? It is this idea, direction without destination, movement without prediction, that is also so intriguing about the current researches regarding genetic algorithms, biological emergence, cellular automata, and the formulation of programs and computer simulations of animal and insect behaviours that is described by the label artificial life. There seems to be a convergence between these so-called new sciences and the movement of difference within the humanities.5 What these scientific discourses make clear is that the unpredictability of daily and cosmological life can be duplicated and rendered indiscernible from the ways in which the computer program exhibits emergent properties inherently unpredictable for their programmers or present users. The evolution of life itself, from the simplest organic forms, to complex biological beings seems to parallel the inherent openness of the structure of matter itself.6 ^To the biologist as to the philosopher the great inadequacy of determinism is its inability to account for the appearance of novelty. Biology above all seems rich in new and more complex structures and functions; the rigid determinisi must either deny the reality of these novel appearances or claim that they are somehow derivable from general laws . . . The feeling grew that biology would have to choose either to follow physics and live with determinism or to strike out on its own. To many it seemed that biological phenomena were so different from physical that some element of indeterminism would have to be admitted. The schism thus established lasted well into this century and produced some notable debates. However, at the present time controversy has faded in perspective and a very different atmosphere prevails; physics and biology are together edging toward a unified theory .... The fact that the generation of mutational novelty ... by the random or chance chemical modification of the informational molecules, which are the genetic store of organisms . . . underlies the evolutionists' stress on the creative contribution of pure chance and the impossibility of predicting the results of its intervention" (Mercer 1987, 11). ^his burgeoning area contains many initial attempts to chart parallels between the sciences and humanities. See Arkady Plotnitski's Complexity, and the work of N. Katherine Hayles. 6Lyotard describes the refiguring of matter in contemporary technoscience as a fourth blow (following Copernicus, Darwin and Freud) unsettling the privilege of the human. Matter can be seen to exhibit desire, if by desire is understood divergence and complexification. If we proceed beyond anthropomorphism, even if cells, stars and chemicals cannot read or desire in one sense, they can in another: "... in the current state of science and techniques, resort to the entity 'Life' to cover what I call, for want</page><page sequence="5">42 Elizabeth Grosz Thinking the New Much of contemporary physics is impelled closer towards the interests and presumptions of biology, which itself has been transformed in the process: their mediation is to a large extent a function of the privilege granted to the random and the unpredictable in both discourses. Biologists no longer accept a simple subsumption of the principles of biology to those of physics and chemistry; instead they have insisted on the boundaries and conditions specific to the nature of biology. In doing so, physics has been forced to accept that certain of its well known presumptions (entropy, to mention the most obvious), need reconsideration in the light of biology (which breaches the principle every minute of the day). The more closely physics comes to providing modes of mathematical modeling for biological processes, the more committed both disciplines must be to the power of the random and the event, to contingency and openness. In other words, the possibilities of convergence between these two sciences seem to depend to some extent on the translatability or interchangeability of mathematical languages of the type preferred in physics with the logical and computer languages and programs now to some extent guiding biological modeling. This convergence or proto-translatability seems possible because otherwise incommensurable disciplines share a certain core commitment to chance and randomness that may allow them to be rendered comparable. The biological notion of evolution seems to have provided the means by which biology has opened itself to futurity and thus aligned itself with certain contemporary physics notion of indeterminacy7 and with the movement of becoming advocated in some versions of postmodern thought. of a better term, desire [conatus, appetitio for others], i.e. the complexification which disavows - de-authorizes so to speak - all objects of demand in turn: resort to this term seems still far too anthropomorphic. To say that Life is responsible for the formation of systems such as the atom or the star or the cell or the human cortex or finally the collective cortex constituted by machine memories is contrary, as are all teleologies, to the materialist spirit ..." (Lyotard 1991, 45). 7The convergence of biology and physics in the late twentieth century seems to rely on a lateral convergence rather than the more conventional model subsumption (a model which has tended to privilege physics as the most notable and pure of the sciences). There are in fact a number of issues which seem to make possible the drawing together these two disparate domains: "1) Physics had to relax its hopes for strict determinism which had seemed to rule out the possibility of biological novelty, contrary to the facts of biological evolution and diversity; 2) Both physics and biology had to strengthen their understanding of evolutionary, historical, irreversible processes in the macroscopic (including macromolecular) dynamics are not time symmetric, and small factors or fluctuations may have amplified effects, especially at bifurcation points where symmetry can easily be broken down; 3) The uses of terms and concepts cast in the mold of information-communication metaphors that now dominate biological explanations have to be justified by accounting for information as a byproduct or side</page><page sequence="6">symplokê 43 Two Is knowledge opposed to the future? Is the future inherently unknowable? While it may be true certain modes or forms of knowing or thinking are incapable of thinking the new, the future or becoming, there seems no essential opposition between them. If dominant modes of knowledge (causal, probabilistic) are incapable of thinking the new, maybe other modes of knowing, other forms of thinking need to be proposed. It is only if thinking is itself part of the provenance of the new - which clearly involves a new account of what thought is - that thinking can be an appropriate modality for dealing with the future, for coping with and producing the new. This is the reservation expressed in the opposition between knowledge on the one hand and the immersion in temporality, and thus possibilities of the future, on the other, posited in the writings of some of Bergson's disciples, even if not by Bergson himself. In Minkowski's analysis of lived time, for example, he raises the question "How do we live the future, independent of and before all knowledge?" (Minkowski 1970, 79). Where memory and perception, the past and the present, are in play, epistemological concerns can be somehow addressed, there is the possibility of knowledge; but where it is a matter of futurity, of life and the direction forward, somehow knowledge can only function as a mode of resistance to the play of vital forces, the élan vital : As for memory, it always concerns recorded events or things heard. It is much closer to knowledge than to life and consequently can occupy only a secondary place in an analysis of lived time. (Minkowski 1970, 80) Futurity is not amenable to exact prediction (except within the most experimentally contained and limited contexts). Indeed, for Minkowski, it is the outsideness, the fundamental alienness, of futurity to knowledge that is part of the awe and mystery, part of the hold that the future has over us as living subjects who are inevitably propelled forward: We look at the future and we see it in a broad and majestic perspective stretching out to lose itself in the distance. This majesty approaches the mysterious. But this mystery is as indispensable to our spiritual life as pure air is to our effect of dynamics .... The dichotomies of structure and function, form and process, genotype and phenotype, biology and physics are seen to be variation on that of information and dynamics" (F. E. Yates in Yates et al. 1987, 625).</page><page sequence="7">44 Elizabeth Grosz Thinking the New respiration. It makes of the future a reservoir of eternal and inexhaustible forces without which we could not continue to live. (Minkowski 1970, 81) We need to affirm, along with Minkowski, the joyous, open- endedness of the future, without, however, asserting that such an indeterminacy functions only in the realm of consciousness, or even life itself. Vitalism is the philosophical commitment to a specific life- force, a life energy, which distinguishes the organic from the inorganic. As part of an ancient tradition within philosophy, vitalism is conventionally opposed to mechanism, the belief that objects, things, are composed of externally or mechanically connected atomic elements. Vitalism is commited to the belief that the organism is greater than the sum of its parts; while mechanism claims that the unity of the organism comes from its particular ingredients in their specific configurations. Where vitalism seems unable to think matter and its capacities for transformation adequately, mechanism seems unable to think the specificities and distinctive features of organic existence, the peculiar properties of life. This opposition prefigures and is to some extent undermined by the opposition and convergence between physics (the conceptual descendent of mechanism) and biology (which can be seen to be oriented more by at least certain elements of vitalism). The opposition Bergson, Minkowski and other vitalisti assume between the organic and the inorganic, between consciousness or mind, and matter, (or, in their terms, between duration and space), must be questioned while simultaneously being taken seriously. Bergson, Minkowski and others have accepted, as few others have, the (perpetually impending) precedence of the future over the past and present; they have acknowledged and delighted in the uncaptured playing out of the forces of duration, temporal continuity and eruption or emergence, and the coincidence of this movement with the surprise and openness of life itself. However, their commitment to vitalism, and their understanding of duration or becoming as the privileged domain of the lived, the experienced, remains limited in at least three respects: 8It must be hastily added that while Bergson is commonly taken as the last full- blown vitalist, there is much in his work that mitigates such an understanding. Where he affirms vitalism in the face of the mathematisation of nature, at the same time he seems to undermine it by asserting the interchangeability of mind and matter, their difference of degree: "... from mind to matter there is but a fundamental difference of degree, which depends on the capacity to gather and conserve. Mind is matter which remembers its interactions, its immanence. But there is a continuum from the instantaneous mind of matter to the very gathered matter of minds" (Lyotard 1991, 40).</page><page sequence="8">symplokê 45 a. its refusal to see spatiality as just as susceptible to the movement of difference as duration. If time has numericised and mathematised duration, then so too, mathematisation has rendered space itself a kind of abstraction of place or locus. Just as time is amenable to both flow and discontinuity (to de- and re-territorialisation), so too is space. Space is no more inherently material than duration, and is no more the privileged domain of objects than memory is subjective and to be denied to spatial events: each is as amenable as the other to the disconcerting of difference, which in any case refuses such a clear-cut distinction between them; b. its refusal to accord to matter itself the indeterminacy and openness that it attributes to life. It is no longer clear where the boundary between life and non-life, between the organic and the inorganic, or perhaps the virtual and the real, can be drawn. What is the status, for example of those strings of RNA which lie half-way between the organic and the inorganic, which we call viruses? Are viruses self-reproducing organisms or are they more biochemical programs? Does it literally matter whether they are enacted in carbon or silicon- based form? A virus has been regarded as a self-replicating, evolving organism, whether it is carbon or silicon-based, whether its content is chemical or informational. There are striking analogies between biological and computer viruses such that the latter may well qualify to be considered forms of artificial life. At the very least, they blur the boundaries between what is regarded as inorganic and what has an organic-like life of its own. Viral infections of both biological and silicon form are programs (genetic or computing) which are injected into the body of a larger cell or application. The cell is thereby infected, and converted into a system for the production of many replicas or clones, and possibly, mutations. A computer virus is a small segment of computer memory (at its most simple, from 2-20 kbs) which is capable of copying its code onto host programs, which, when executed, spread the virus further. Biological viruses are similar in their informational length (usually around 3-30Kb) and in their various capacities.9 How can the line be drawn, such 9Spafford argues that, as far as the properties a-life scientists want to associate with the definition of life, a computer virus could qualify as life. Yet he concludes that this indicates a problem with the definition of life on which computer programs have relied. He cites the following criteria, which he believes the computer virus satisfies:</page><page sequence="9">46 Elizabeth Grosz Thinking the New that material objects are characterised by an inertia, and by temporal self-containment (i.e. by being) that the organic world enlivens (through becoming)? and c. its inability to realise that it is not simply matter, organic or inorganic, but more intriguingly and less straight- forwardly, information, at least information insofar as it is bound up with a particular mode or organisation of matter, that becomes, that expands itself as it is impelled to the future. It is significant that although there seems an ostensive commitment to materialism within biology, as one would expect, nevertheless, there seems a stronger commitment to the independence of information from matter. Matter figures as significant only insofar as its particular modes of organisation can support the demands/ requirements for the transmission and reproduction of information. It is the peculiar transmigration of matter and information that seems to mark the 'materialist' commitments of contemporary biology, and to provide a space is which the notion of 'artificial life', life generated in simulated space, life generated through information, can gain not only a plausible but perhaps an inevitable role in biological modeling.10 Becoming is what emerses both matter "1) Life is a pattern in space-time rather than a specific material object; 2) Self- reproduction, in itself or in a related organism; 3) Information storage of a self- representation; 4) A metabolism that converts matter/energy; 5) Functional interactions with the environment; 6) Interdependence of parts; 7) Stability under perturbations of the environment; 8) The ability to evolve; 9) Growth or expansion" (Spafford 1992, 741). While noting, indeed arguing in favour of the analogy, Spafford is clearly disturbed at the implication that a hard and fast line may not be able to be drawn dividing life from its simulation and at the very end of his paper reasserts in somewhat dogmatic form exactly that which his own paper has helped problematise. He argues that "we must never lose sight of the fact that 'real life' is of much more importance than 'artificial life,' and we should not allow our experiments to threaten our experimenters." (744) when in fact his own arguments make it increasingly difficult to divide the experimenter from the experiment. For more on the links between biological and computer viruses, see Moya, Domingo and Holland, (1995), Richard Dawkins (1986) and Andrew Ross (1991, 77). 10Langton makes explicit the relative indifference of biological concepts of life to the specific modes of materiality to which it has up to now been confined: "Certainly life, as a dynamic physical process, could haunt other physical material: the material just needs to be organized in the right way. Just as certainly, the dynamic processes that constitute life - in whatever material bases they might occur - must share certain universal features - features that allow us to recognize life by its dynamic form alone, without reference to its matter. This general phenomenon of life - life writ-large across</page><page sequence="10">symplokë 47 and information: it is for this reason that temporal modeling, though not prediction, is as possible in the spheres of social and cultural activities as in the domains of ethology, biology, physics or genetics.11 This is made abundantly clear in the ways in which information, in virtual space, in computing programs of various kinds, exhibit emergent properties even though it is difficult to ascertain exactly what their modes of materiality consists in. Three While clearly I can do no justice to the resources that may make such a project of thinking the new feasible - Bergson, Deleuze, Minkowski, Derrida, the writings on artificial life, on molecular biology, and on contemporary physics - it is nonetheless very rare in the history of Western philosophy that time, duration, is conceived outside the constraints of a mathematisation of space. Indeed, since Einstein, time is conceived as the mode for the mathematisation of space. It is largely Deleuze's reading of Bergson that has rescued the latter from the kind of oblivion dealt to once popular figures of yesteryear, who are often treated as little more than anachronistic amusements. Deleuze's reading of Bergson12 has taken a very long time to have any impact of the reassessment of Bergson's work, and on refiguring conceptions of time in literary, cultural, filmic and scientific contexts. For the purposes of this paper, I will look at only a tiny fragment of Bergson's work, duration, and its links to the notion of virtuality, which will be of use to reconceiving becoming and the new.13 all possible material substrates - is the true subject matter of biology" (Langton 1989, 2). Whenever the specificities of matter are regarded merely as substrate, ground or 'support' of a program, form or idea, it seems that we return to the reign of Platonism and the profound somatophobia to which it gave rise. It is significant that Langton's conception of matter as substrate has been challenged, not entirely surprisingly, from the point of view of molecular biology, "according to which 'form' and 'matter' do not represent separate realms" (Claus Emmeche 1992, 466). nFor a current overview of the role of computer simulation and what have been called 'artificial societies', see Gilbert and Conte (1995). 12Deleuze (1988). 13These are clearly abiding concerns in Deleuze's writings, from his work on Hume, through his analysis of Proust and his understanding of the time - movement in his studies of cinema to his more recent writings on thinking and philosophy. Outlining this trajectory would no doubt warrant a book length study (maybe in another lifetime!) .</page><page sequence="11">48 Elizabeth Grosz Thinking the New Bergson claims that a distinction between subjective and objective (or duration and spatiality, life and the non-organic) can be formulated in terms of the distinction between the virtual and the actual. Bergson suggests that objects, space, and the world of inert matter exists entirely in the domain of the actual. They contain no virtuality. Matter has no hidden latency, no potentiality, no hidden becoming. While there is more to matter than our images of it (a claim which rescues him from the unwarranted accusation of idealism with which he is continually charged), material objects are nonetheless of the same kind as our images.14 If everything about matter is real, if it has no virtuality, the proper Medium' or milieu of matter is spatial. While it exists in duration, while clearly it is subject to change, the object does not reveal itself over time. There is no more in it 'than what it presents to us at any moment.' By contrast, what duration, memory, consciousness bring to the world is the possibility of an unfolding, a hesitation, an uncertainty. Not everything is presented in simultaneity. This is what life (duration, memory, consciousness) brings to the world: the new, the movement of actualisation of the virtual, expansiveness, opening up. Thus the living being essentially has duration; it has duration precisely because it is continuously elaborating what is new and because there is no elaboration without searching, no searching without groping. Time is this very hesitation. (Bergson 1992, 93) Time is a mode of stretching, protraction, which provides the very conditions of becoming, however haltering they may be. Time is the hiccoughing that expands itself, encompassing past and present into a kind of simultaneity. Both exist, they concur 'at the same time.'15 14As Bergson says, "There is in matter something more than, but not something different from that which is actually given. Undoubtedly, conscious perception does not encompass the whole of matter, since it consists, in as far as it is conscious, in the separation or 'discernment', of that which, in matter, interests our various needs. But between this perception of matter and matter itself, there is but a difference of degree and not of kind, pure perception standing toward matter in the relation of the part to the whole. This amounts to saying that matter cannot exercise powers of any kind other than those which we perceive. It has no mysterious virtue; it can conceal none" (Bergson 1988, 71). 15The past and the present do not denote two successive moments, but two "elements which coexist: One is the present, which does not cease to pass, and the other is the past, which does not cease to be but through which all presents pass.. .The past does not follow the present, but on the contrary, is presupposed by it as the pure condition without which it would not pass. In other words, each present goes back to itself as past" (Deleuze 1988, 59).</page><page sequence="12">symplokë 49 But they do not exist in the same order: they function, not in terms of the possible/ real relation, but in terms of the relations between actual and virtual. Matter and the present are to be placed on the side of the actual, and mind or duration and the past, on the side of the virtual. In doing so, Bergson in effect displaces the dominance of the possible/ real relation. The process of realisation, that 'movement' or vector from the possible to the real, is governed by the two principles of resemblance and limitation. The real exists in a relation of resemblance to the possible, functioning as its exact image, to which the category of existence or reality is simply added. In other words, the real and the possible are conceptually identical (since, as Kant argued, existence is not a quality or attribute). Realisation also involves the process of limitation, the narrowing down of possibilities, so that some are rejected and others made real. The field of the possible is broader than the real. Implicit in the coupling of limitation and resemblance, Deleuze suggests, is a preformism: the real is already preformed in the possible insofar as the real resembles the possible. The possible passes into the real by a process of culling. Deleuze suggests that this relation entails a fixity: the real emerges as the given (rather than produced), though the possible could just as readily be seen as the 'retrospective' projection of the real.16 The possible is both more and less than the real. It is more, insofar as the real selects from a number of coexisting possibles, limiting their ramifying effects. But it is also less, insofar as the possible is the real minus existence.17 Realisation is a temporal process in which creativity and the new are no longer conceivable. Making the possible real is simply giving it existence without adding to or modifying its conception. The question begs to be posed: is the possible the foundation or precondition of the 16"Everything is already completely given: all of the real in the image, the pseudo- actuality of the possible. Then the slight of hand becomes obvious: If the real is said to resemble to possible, is this not in fact because the real was expected to come about by its own means, to 'project backwards' a fictitious image of it, and to claim that it was possible at any time before it happened? In fact it is not the real that resembles the possible, it is the possible that resembles the real, because it has been abstracted from the real once made, arbitrarily extracted from the real like a sterile double" (Deleuze 1988, 98). 17Cf. Bergson, "One might as well claim that the man in flesh and blood comes from the materialization of his image seen in the mirror, because in that real is everything to be found in this virtual image with, in addition, the solidity which makes it possible to touch it. But the truth is that more is needed here to obtain the virtual than is necessary for the real, more of the image of the man than for the man himself, for the image of the man will not be portrayed if the man is not first produced, and in addition one has to have the mirror" (Bergson 1992, 102).</page><page sequence="13">50 Elizabeth Grosz Thinking the New real, or does the real project itself backward to produce the possible? Is the real an image of the possible, or the possible an image of the real?18 To reduce the possible to a préexistent phantom-like version of the real is to curtail the possibility of thinking emergence, an open future not bound directly or strictly to the present. 19 In Difference and Repetition (1994), Deleuze claims that there are at least three ways in which the virtual should be distinguished from the possible: First, existence, the acquisition of the status of reality by the possible can be understood either as an inexplicable eruption or a system of all-or-nothing: either it 'has' existence, in which case it is real, or it lacks' existence, it which case it remains merely possible. If this is the case, Deleuze argues, it is hard to see what the difference is between the existent and the non-existent, seeing the non-existent is a possibility that retains all the characteristics of the existent. Existence is regarded as the same as the possible, and they thus function as conceptual duplicates. Existence or reality are regarded as simply the unfolding of a predesignated possible.20 By contrast, for Deleuze as for Bergson, the virtual cannot be opposed to the real: it is real. It is through its reality that existence is produced. 18The processes of resemblance and limitation constituting realisation, Bergson argues, are subject to the philosophical illusion which consists in the belief that there is less in the idea of the empty rather than the full; and less in the concept of disorder than order, where in fact the ideas of nothing and disorder are more complicated than of existence and order: "Underlying the doctrines which disregard the radical novelty of each moment of evolution there are many misunderstandings, may errors. But there is especially the idea that the possible is less than the real, and that, for this reason, the possibility of things precedes their existence. They would thus be capable of representation beforehand; they could be thought of before being realized. But it is the reverse that is true .... [W]e find that there is more and not less in the possibility of each of the successive states than in their reality. For the possible is only the real with the addition of an act of mind which throws its image back into the past, once it has been enacted. But that is what our intellectual habits prevent us from seeing" (Bergson 1992, 99-100). 19"As reality is created as something unforeseeable and new, its image is reflected behind it into the indefinite past; thus it finds that it has from all time been possible, but it is at this precise moment that it begins to have been always possible, and that is why I said that its possibility, which does not precede its reality, will have to precede it once the reality has appeared. The possible is therefore the mirage of the present in the past; and as we know the future will finally constitute a present and the mirage effect is continually being produced, we are convinced that the image of tomorrow is already contained in our actual present, which will be the past of tomorrow, although we do not manage to grasp it" (Bergson 1992, 101). Existence is supposed to occur in space and time, but these are understood as "indifferent milieux instead of the production of existence occurring in a characteristic space and time. Difference can no longer be anything but the negative determined by the concept; either the limitation imposed by possibles of each other in order to be realised, or the opposition of the possible to the reality of the real" (Deleuze 1994, 211).</page><page sequence="14">symplokë 51 Instead of an impoverished real (the possible), the virtual can be considered more a superabundant real that induces actualisation. Second, if the possible is thought in place of the virtual, difference can only be understood as restriction and containment rather than production. Where the possible 'refers to the form of identity in the concept', the virtual 'designates a pure multiplicity in the Idea which radically excludes the identical as prior condition/ The self-identity of the image remains the same whether possible or real; it is precisely such an understanding of self-identity that the virtual renders unthinkable. And third, while the possible is regarded as a mode of anticipatory resemblance of the real, the virtual never resembles the real that it actualises. It is this sense that actualisation is a process of creation that resists both a logic of identity and a logic of resemblance to substitute differentiation, divergence and innovation. While the concept of the possible doubles that of the real, the virtual is the real of genuine production, innovation, creativity. It is only actualisation that engenders the new.21 The process of actualisation is a process of genuine creativity and innovation, the production of singularity or individuation. Where the possible/ real relation is regulated by resemblance and limitation, the virtual/ actual relation is governed by the two principles of difference and creation. For the virtual to become actual, it must create the conditions for actualisation: the actual in no way resembles the virtual. Rather, the actual is produced through a mode of differentiation from the virtual, a mode of divergence from it which is productive. The process of actualisation involves the creation of heterogeneous terms. The lines of actualisation of virtuality are divergent, creating multiplicities, the varieties that constitute creative evolution. This is a movement of the emanation of a multiplicity from a virtual unity, divergent paths of development in different series and directions.22 21" Actualisation breaks with resemblance as a process of no less than it does with identity as a principle. Actual terms never resemble the singularities they incarnate. In this sense, actualisation or différenciation is always a genuine creation. It does not result from any limitation of a pre-existing possibility . . . For a potential or virtual object, to be actualised is to create divergent lines which correspond to - without resembling - a virtual multiplicity. The virtual possesses the reality of a task to be performed or a problem to be solved: it is the problem which orientates, conditions and engenders solutions, but these do not resemble the conditions of the problem" (Deleuze 1994, 212). ^"While the real is in the image and likeness of the possible that it realizes, the actual, on the other hand, does not resemble the virtual from which we begin and the actuals at which we arrive, and also the difference between the complementary lines according to which actualization takes place. In short, the characteristic of virtuality is</page><page sequence="15">52 Elizabeth Grosz Thinking the New The movement from a virtual unity to an actual multiplicity requires that there is a certain leap of innovation or creativity, the surprise that the virtual leaves within the actual. The movement of realisation seems like the concrétisation of a préexistent plan or program; by contrast, the movement of actualisation is the opening up of the virtual to what befalls it. In the terms of another discourse, actualisation is individuation, the creation of singularity (whether physical, psychical or social), insofar as the processes of individuation predate the individual yet the individual is a somehow open-ended consequence of these processes. Individuation contains the 'ingredients' of individuality without in any way planning or preparing for it.23 Individuation is the alignment of virtualities, which make both being and becoming possible. Individuation is in no sense tied to the human: it is what characterises cloud formations, the formation of crystals, the currents of oceans, as well as the development of cells, and the creation of individuals. Individuation is a series of processes of radical excentering and self-exceeding, whether psychically, organically, or at the level of the non-organic. This is what becoming is of necessity - a movement of differentiation, divergence and self-surpassing or actualisation of virtualities in the light of the contingencies that befall them. Insofar as time, history, change, the future need to be reviewed in the light of this Bergsonian disordering, perhaps the concept of the virtual may prove central in reinvigorating the future insofar as refusing to tie it to the realisation of possibilities (the following of a to exist in such a way that it is actualized by being differentiated and is forced to differentiate itself, to create its lines of differentiation in order to be actualized" (Deleuze 1988, 97). 23This notion of individuation is articulated by Gilbert Simondon, who has been so influential in much of Deleuze's writings, especially in A Thousand Plateaus, regarding the processes of individuation. Individuation is seen in terms of a series of states of metastable equilibrium; it is thus necessarily regarded in terms of becoming. Simondon may have succeeded in going a step further than Bergson in thinking the implications of movement as the internal condition of individuation or being itself: "The concept of being that I put forward, then, is the following: a being does not possess a unity in its identity, which is that of the stable state within which no transformation is possible; rather, a being has a transductive unity, that is, it can pass out of phase with itself, it can - in any arena - break its own bounds in relation to its center. What one assumes to be a relation or a duality of principles is in fact the unfolding of the being, which is more than a unity and more than an identity; becoming is a dimension of the being, not something that happens to it following a succession of events that affect a being already and originally given and substantial. Individuation must be grasped as the becoming of the being and not as a model of the being which would exhaust his signification . . . Instead of presupposing the existence of substances in order to account for individuation, I intend, on the contrary, to take the different regimes of individuation as providing the foundation for different domains such as matter, life, mind and society" (Simondon 311-312).</page><page sequence="16">symplokë 53 plan), it links it instead to the unpredictable, uncertain actualisation of virtualities. This point is not simply a semantic one: it is not a question of dumping the word 'possible' and replacing it with Virtual/ but of understanding the concept in an entirely different way, understanding the processes of production and creation in terms of an openness to the new instead of a preformism of the expected. Bergson's conception of virtuality provides us with a way of seeing the future as bound up with the continual elaboration of the new, the openness of things (including life - here I must depart from Bergson to attribute the possibilities of becoming to the non-organic or the quasi-organic as well as to life in its more traditional senses). This is what time is if it is anything at all: not simply mechanical repetition, the causal ripple of objects on others, but the indeterminate, the unfolding and the emergence of the new. Time is intrication and elaboration. The model that Bergson himself develops, with great prescience in view of the current transformations and upheavals going on in biology and biological modelling, is more akin to the randomness of evolution, the unfolding of lineage and mutation. Elaboration is time's mode of acting, but an elaboration that frees up, un-determines, interrupts and deflects rather than causes.24 Duration proceeds not by continuous growth, smooth unfolding or accretion, but through division, bifurcation, dissociation - by difference - through sudden and unexpected change or eruption. Duration is a mode of infecting self-differentiation: difference is both internal to its function, its modes of elaboration and production, and is its ramifying effect on those objects located 'within' its milieu. This means that not only must conceptions of time (in physics, biology, philosophy as well as cultural studies and social theory) be opened up to their modes of differentiation; it also means that our very concept of objects, matter, being - well beyond the concept of life itself - need to be open to the differentiations which constitute and continually transform them.

It must, therefore, be elaboration. Would it not then be a vehicle of creation and of choice? Would not the existence of time prove that there is indétermination in things? Would not time be that indétermination itself?" (Bergson 1992, 93).</page><page sequence="17">54 Elizabeth Grosz Thinking the New References Bergson, Henri. Creative Evolution. Trans.
