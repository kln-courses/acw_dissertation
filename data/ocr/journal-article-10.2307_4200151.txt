<plain_text><page sequence="1">39 THE DISTRIBUTION OF UPRIGHT-HANDLED JARS AND STEMMED DISHES IN THE EARLY DYNASTIC PERIOD By JANE MOON Introduction In a previous article we discussed the recently excavated upright-handled jars and stemmed dishes from Abu Salabikh (Moon 1981). In the following pages we attempt to follow the wide distribution of these two pottery types by presenting similar material from other Early Dynastic sites. Occurrence of both in association clusters about Northern Babylonia, so a good starting point is provided by Kish, where upright-handled jars and stemmed dishes were first commented upon. Fig. 1. Map of Mesopotamia showing the distribution of upright-handled jars and stemmed dishes. Kish As with so many sites dug in the earlier part of the century, available records leave much to be desired. " Ingharra was badly excavated, the excavations were</page><page sequence="2">4? JANE MOON badly recorded, and the records were correspondingly badly published " (Lloyd ^69, 48). However, the attention to detail afforded by Mackay's description of the upright-handled jars and stemmed dishes is admirable (Mackay 1925, 23-37; 1929, 130-156). And while the caution that is the privilege of hindsight must now be applied to some of the deductions, there is no need to reiterate pure descrip- tion.1 Upright-handled jars i. (Moorey 1978, Fiche 2, FO 5). 1929.329. Upright-handled jar, complete. Ht. 18? 2 cm, rim di. 9 -4 cm, base di. 7 -4 cm. Fine buff clay, well levigated, with much grit. Incised decoration. Uneven but well made. Piece of copper adheres to handle. Context : Y tomb 524. This jar clearly displays features of the very earliest upright-handled jars from the Diyala region (Delougaz 1952, PI. 76b, B.416.371) : bevelled-ledge rim, small solid handle set low down on the shoulder and decorated with a simple cross. In contrast to the early Diyala examples, however, this jar is much smaller than later ones from the A cemetery usually are, and it is a different shape. Tomb Y 524 also contained single-lugged jars. These do not occur anywhere into ED III, and are predominantly ED I in the Diyala region (Delougaz 1952, 57). They occur in quantity at Kish independently of association with upright-handled jars (Watelin 1934, PI. I), and at many other sites as distant as Iran (de Mecquenem 1905, Fig. 285, from Tepe Aly Abad), so can have nothing to do with quirks of regional variation. They were also found in the limited probings of deeper levels at Abu Salabikh (Whelan 1978, 93 Fig. 5a, b). There is little doubt, then, that No. 1 is most pro- bably of ED I date. 2.

Uneven but well made and finished. Context : Y sounding, 6 m down. Like No. 1 above, this jar would be pre-ED III by Diyala criteria, on account of the framed cross on the handle and the protrusion at its top centre (Delougaz 1952, PI. 76b). Two handles very like those from early Diyala jars were also found in the Y sounding at Kish (Moorey 1966, P. XL, 1930. 243a, e). 3. (Mackay 1929, PI. XLVIII No. 4). 1925.237. Upright-handled jar, complete. Ht. c. 16-3 cm, rim di. c. 10*9 cm, base di. c. 6-2 cm. Dull pink clay, paler surface. Roughly incised decoration. Context : Cemetery A, Burial 40. The decoration of the handle is geometrical, and therefore slightly unusual for Cemetery A. Both a detached handle (ibid., PL XLVIII 13) and an upright-handled jar (ibid., PI. XLVIII 14) from the same grave are of the human type. The latter has a combed shoulder design, a feature more commonly ED IIIB in the Diyala region. Two stemmed dishes were also found in this grave (ibid., PI. XLIX 16). 4. (Mackay 1925, PI. IX No. 4). 1924.761. Upright-handled jar, complete. Ht. c. 10 -8 cm, rim di. c. 7-4 cm, base di. c. 4*5 cm. Coarse buff clay. Roughly incised decoration and applied features. Handle pinched on to rim. Context : Disturbed grave of a child, Burial 18, Cemetery A. The handle has been deliberately attached to the rim.1 Smaller upright-handled jars frequently come from the graves of children, but by no means exclusively. A second jar and a stemmed dish from the same grave are of normal proportions (Mackay 1925 PI. IX 14, PL XI 7) and another miniature come from adult graves. 5. (Mackay 1925, PL IX No. 9). 1924.209.

The pottery described below is now to be found in the Iraq and Ashmolean Museums, and is a selection. Some jars are reillustrated from the original publi- cation in order to show decoration details. Specimens that were unidentifiable and otherwise added nothing to our discussion have been omitted. * This contradicts Whelan's statement that they were never so joined at Kish (Whelan 1978, 83).</page><page sequence="3">UPRIGHT-HANDLED JARS AND STEMMED DISHES 41 ?z ^ 3 ^ 10 cm Fig. 2. Scale ? 15.</page><page sequence="4">42 JANE MOON Unfortunately none of the other upright-handled jars from this grave are published, so no further comment can be made on whether a nose only on a handle is an earlier form than the full face (Moon 1981, 50). The associated small stemmed dish (Mackay 1925, PL XI No. 5) could be any Early Dynastic date. 6. 1925.217. Upright-handled jar, complete. Ht. c. 31 -o cm, rim di. c. 10-4 cm, base di. c. 13 ?? cm.

The depiction of the pubic triangle on the jar below the handle is echoed as a shoulder decoration. The use of herringbone design to denote hair has already been observed (Moon 1981, 54, note 7), and here we have another example of the same decoration being used both as a representation and as purely abstract design. 8 and 9.

While part of the purpose of this study is to demonstrate the diversity of types that can occur, there is occasional exact repetition as here. A comparison, therefore, of pottery and other types of object from the same graves would provide valuable leaders to sort out a chronology of types. Alas, evidence for the rest of the graves, physical or pictorial, is sufficiently meagre to be useless. There is a stemmed dish (Mackay 1929, PL L No. 4) and an undistinctive large jar (ibid., PL LUI No. 31) both from Burial 68.* Detached handles 10. KM 259 (Iraq Museum). Upright-handle.

An upright-handled jar with a " human " handle was found with this vessel (PL X No. 17). While there is no doubting the general similarity of stemmed dishes from Kish and Abu Salabikh, strikingly identical matches are in fact rarer than with the upright- handled jars. The " gerillte " rim occurs but rarely outside Kish : Abu Salabikh (6G 74:209) and an un-numbered fragment from Ur. Upright-handled jars occur at Kish in Cemetery A and in graves in the Y sounding. They are also found in non-funerary context, but no real stratification is available for any so found. Stemmed dishes offer comparatively few parallels and add little to discussion. Dating Cemetery A. Various attempts have been made to date Cemetery A in the light of more recent discoveries and excavations. The seriation analysis attempted by Hrouda and Karstens (Hrouda and Karstens 1967) has already been ably criticised by Moorey (Moorey 1978, 87) and Whelan (Whelan 1978, 85-86), and need not be further examined here. The dating that seems to be most widely accepted is that proposed by Moorey. Moorey argues that " cemetery A was not in use for a very great length of time, and that . . . period of use ended in the Akkadian period " (Moorey 1978, 65). A brick platform in the A palace contained a Fara tablet, and the cemetery must be later than the palace into which it was dug. " Even if it is not part of the original structure, this platform certainly formed part of the palace fittings during and not after its destruction, which could not have been earlier than an advanced date in ED IIIA " (ibid., 57). The walls of the palace were found in an eroded condition, but as Moorey points out (ibid., 53), this does not mean that their deterioration covered a long period of time : the decay of even a fairly substantial mud-brick building can advance considerably over the course of a single Iraqi winter. * A large number of these appear in the original publication, and unlike the upright-handled jars which really have to be seen from two different angles for a full appreciation of the detail, these vessels are readily understood from the small-scale drawings of Mackay's report. There is no need, therefore, to repeat any of the original illustrations, and very few unpublished ones of any value were discovered in the course of study.</page><page sequence="7">UPRIGHT-HANDLED JARS AND STEMMED DISHES 45 15 16 17 10 cm Fig. 4. Scale ? :5? On this reckoning then, the cemetery must begin in late ED IIIA or later. Moorey argued for a relatively late start, noting, as did Delougaz (Delougaz 1952, 144), the similarity of upright-handled jars at Kish to those dated to ED IIIB in the Diyala region. Whelan has challenged this dating (Whelan 1978), and favours an ED IIIA date for most of the upright-handled jars. She lists exhaustively (ibid., 84-85), similarities of features between the Kish jars and those from ED IIIA levels in the Diyala region, arguing that " the only significant difference in the upright-handled jars from the two regions is the presence of plastic ? goddess ' features on some of the spout handles from the A cemetery " (ibid., 85). Although she purports to argue from combinations of features, most of the examples she uses deal with single features, and other combinations are dismissed where they do not fit the point.6 6 For example, in remarking upon the association of spout-handles and double registers on both the Kish pots and those from the Diyala region of ED IIIB she writes " the most convincing hypothesis is that Kish potters were more innovative and that the introduction of double registers and plastic goddess features were followed rather more slowly in the Diyala region" (Whelan 1978, 85).</page><page sequence="8">F JANE MOON The major stumbling-block in this line of reasoning is the disparity in numbers of stratified ED IIIA and IIIB upright-handled jars in the Diyala region : there were only fourteen found in levels above Houses 2, and only nine of these are illustrated (Delougaz 1952, fi.516.371b, B.516.473, B.526.471, C.515.561, C.5i6.37ia, C.526.47ia, C.526.47id, C.527.471), and not all of these can be con- fidently dated. It is scarcely surprising, then, that more similarities can be quoted from the ED IIIA vessels, as there are so many more of them. Some of the features cited by Whelan, such as plain handles (Whelan 1978, 83) are in fact common to both periods, and the Abu Salabikh assemblage amply demonstrates the diversity of types that can occur. Although there are fewer upright-handles jars from ED IIIB levels in the Diyala region there is a number of handles from among the surface finds. Many of these are of the anthropomorphic type (Delougaz 1952, PI. 87). Although these cannot be stratified they should not be completely ignored. Whelan mentions them, but does not take account of them in her analysis. Surface finds can come from anywhere, through rodent or other disruptive action, but on Mesopotamian tells they most often belong to levels eroded by the alternate action of summer heat, winter rain and springtime wind-storms. It is likely, therefore, that most of the surface handles post-date the latest occupation of the mound on which they were found, which at Khafajah is early ED IIIB. There is no satisfactory way of estimating the time-lag between the destruction of Palace A and the beginning of the cemetery dug into it : at least one grave contained an upright-handled jar stylistically pre-ED IIIB (Mackay 1929, PL XLVIII No. 22), but the position and other stratigraphical details of all the graves are missing. What is certain is that most of the upright-handled jars and stemmed dishes from Cemetery A published by Mackay are similar to what few are known to be ED IIIB in the Diyala region, and are relatively homogeneous in their manufacture. As at other sites under consideration, a few upright-handled jars from Kish seem to have Akkadian affinities, though definite proof of their date is elusive. These have been stressed by Gibson : " It is my suspicion that some of the graves in the A cemetery are actually Akkadian in date . . . specifically graves 52, 102, 104 and 107. In one of the graves there occurred a goddess-handled vessel with a high foot and high neck" (Gibson 1972, 79). A few graves on neighbouring Tell Ingharra contained pottery the same as that from the A cemetery, and at least one of these is of Akkadian date : " The cylinder seal from grave 306 provides certain evidence that the use of this area as a cemetery extended into the Akkadian period " (Moorey 1970, 101). Isin Early Dynastic remains have been encountered in the excavations at Ishan Bahriyat, the ancient Isin, a few kilometres from Nippur and Abu Salabikh (Hrouda 1973, Wo)? As yet, however, finds of this date are not particularly numerous. This is no doubt partly due to the fact that the remains excavated have been predo- minantly architectural and not funerary.</page><page sequence="9">UPRIGHT-HANDLED JARS AND STEMMED DISHES 47 ?9? IB 738 (Iraq Museum). Upright handle, solid. Pr?s. ht. 7*6 cm, max. width 5*8 cm. Fine pale pink clay, buff surface. Incised decoration, applied features. This handle is a surface find. The similarity to Kish handles is obvious (Mackay 1925, PL II No. 7, and Fig. 3 No. 10 above) and is worth noting as this kind of square, hollow handle with heavy applied features has not yet turned up at Abu Salabikh. As far as one may postulate anything from negative evidence, this may support an ED IIIB date for the Kish cemetery, that period being absent at Abu Salabikh. A similar handle from Isin is published (IB 30, see Hrouda 1973, Abb. 24). Nippur Nippur is in the same vicinity as Abu Salabikh, Isin, Fara and Adab. A certain amount of pottery from the North Temple has recently been published (McCown et al. 1978). The quantity is small and " no attempt can be made to determine the pottery sequence from the Protoliterate through the Akkadian period " (ibid., 28). Upright-handled jars occur in NT (North Temple) Level IV. These are considered " the best evidence for its attribution to ED III " (ibid., 28). While pottery from the succeeding Level III is " much more characteristically ED III " (ibid., 28), the upright-handled jars from Level IV are not particularly so. The single decorated specimen (ibid., PI. 45 Nos. 1 and 3), has a complex incised design, and is virtually identical to two jars from Abu Salabikh, Area A, Level II (Moon 1981, Fig. 1 Nos. 2 and 3). The one from Nippur is, however, covered with a light red wash, a characteristic which is most commonly ED II in the Diyala region. The other two upright-handled jar types found were plain. No less than nine examples of one type (McCown et al. 1978, PI. 45 No. 4) were found inside the altar of Level IV. 20. P. 557 (Iraq Museum). Upright-handled jar, restored. Ht. 29-6 cm, rim di. 9*6 cm, base di. II ?6 cm. Pinkish clay, buff surface. Undecorated but for notched rib. Levels NT XVIII and parts of the sounding below are dated to ED I by the presence of solid-footed goblets. Levels II and I contained Akkadian tablets and are dated accordingly. The pottery from Level III is similar to that dated to ED III in the Diyala region, but all the rest is enigmatic. As there is no recognizable ED II pottery in any of these levels, NT VIII-V are dated to that period " by process of elimination " (McCown et al. 1978, 28). Levels IV and III are considered to be ED III though the upright-handled jars could as well be ED II as ED III by Diyala criteria. Fragments of stemmed dishes were found both in Level IV and Level III, those from IV being compared to Diyala examples that are ED II there. Until information about the Early Dynastic Inanna temple at Nippur is fully published it is unlikely that the North Temple sequence can be sorted out satis- factorily. A number of detached handles occurred in the Inanna sequence itself: a plain one in Level VII (7 NP 7), square and solid with a slight bump at the top centre. Level IXb produced two more of the same basic type, but with incised crosses (7 ? 581, 7 NP 86), and in Level Vllb there was a tall, thin, solid handle with applied eyes and nose, and incised pubic triangle (7 ? 523). Stemmed dishes occurred also : two in Level VIII (7 NP 41, 49), one in Level Vllb (7 NP 33), and three in Level VII (7 NP 8, 13, 22). All were of the relatively broad, short, elaborately decorated kind : the plain sort is not reported at all.</page><page sequence="10">48 JANE MOON (Information on the Inanna sequence is from Richard L. Zettler, personal communi- cation, letter of July 17, 1981). Adah Neither of our two types is mentioned by the excavator of Adab (Banks 1912), though his rough sketch of pottery (ibid., 349) includes what could be a short, undecorated stemmed dish. A more convincing one is shown among the stone vessels (ibid., 261 No. 28), and seems to be decorated, and there is a possible short, plain stone stemmed dish too (ibid., 261 No. 5). The upper half of an upright-handled jar was recently found on the mound surface at Adab (by J. N. Postgate) and is now in the Iraq Museum. It is the largest on record (see PL II). The massive handle combines hatched St. Andrew's cross, plastic features and perhaps an inverted pinnate motif; and the shoulder design is inverted hatched triangles. There is a plastic ridge at the base of the neck as well as the usual pricking. We are at a loss to hazard a date for this jar. The extremely warped condition suggests it was made at the site. SaW el-Jumr The site of Sali' el-Jumr was on the Euphrates between Babylon and Sippar. It was excavated by the Department of Antiquities of the Iraq Museum ahead of the Museyib irrigation project (al-Hasani 1955). These two Early Dynastic vessels were among the finds. 2i. IM 59421.

Context : Level II, which was considered by the excavators to be ED I/II. The rather thin handle with pinnate motif would seem to be post-ED I, at least there are no ED I parallels for it. The rather careless shaping of the rim suggests a later date. In fact the nearest comparison for the whole piece is ajar from Houses 3 at Khafajah (Delougaz 1952, PL 84a). 22? IM 59420.

As we have seen, decorated stemmed dishes such as this one are not otherwise known to occur before ED III. This one is close to the usual type found at Kish, but was apparently associated with a conical bowl of the tall, narrow variety usually considered pre-ED III (Delougaz 1952, 58), as well as a spouted jar which could be ED II or III. Mari During the Early Dynastic period Mari, like Susa, was a thriving centre of Sumerian culture, though hundreds of miles from Sumer. The pottery, as well as other artefacts, bears this out. 23.

The pattern of herringbone-hatched triangles on the shoulder is paralleled at Kish (see Fig. 2 no. 7 above), and the anthropomorphic handle with the incised cross is especially like a jar from Abu Salabikh (Moon 1981, Fig. 6 No. 32) ; even the right-hand arm of the cross stops short in the same way. This jar would be quite at home among those of ED IIIA in Mesopotamia.</page><page sequence="11">UPRIGHT-HANDLED JARS AND STEMMED DISHES 49 19 10 cm 22 10 cm Fig. 5. Scale 1 15, except no. 19, at 2 '.5.</page><page sequence="12">50 JANE MOON Upright-handled jars are not treated as a separate type in the Mari reports, and one gathers that they were less numerous than stemmed dishes. One other example is illustrated (Parrot 1935, PI. II No. 2, and p. 9 Fig. 4), and has a geometric handle : " l'anse est ... simplement incis?e, mais sans aucun des attributs constituant la figuration sch?matique de la d?esse m?re " (ibid., 8). A stemmed dish is also mentioned as coming from the same grave, number 4 (Parrot 1935, 8, and PL II No. 2). Stemmed dishes received more thorough treat- ment than upright-handled jars, and a number of examples from the Ishtar temple are illustrated in the final report (Parrot 1956, 213-217m and 214 Fig. 105). Com- plete examples are rather long and thin in the stem, with more rounded dishes than is the norm elsewhere, but it is clear from the illustrated fragments that the shorter kind with stem gradually flaring towards the base also occurred (e.g. ibid., 214, Fig. 105 Nos. 10 and 14). Stemmed dishes were found in and around the temple, as well as in the graves. To the south-west of the Ninni-Zaza temple was found a model clay building, filled with miniature pottery (Parrot 1967, 293-305). Two of these vessels would seem to be upright-handled jars (ibid., 300, Fig. 314 Nos. 3206 and 3228). The handles are rather tiny, more like the single lugs of the ED I period, but the associ- ated pottery is so well paralleled among grave-goods of Cemetery A at Kish that the assemblage must be ED III, probably ED IIIB. Tell 'Uqair Tell 'Uqair lies within sight of Kutha (Tell Ibrahim), halfway between the Tigris and the Euphrates (Lloyd and Safar 1943, 135). An Early Dynastic cemetery was discovered on a different part of the mound from the remains of the famous Uruk temple. As at Kish and Abu Salabikh, comparable stratified material to date the cemetery is lacking. Many levels have been eroded from the top of the mound, and it is not possible to say if there was ever a structure associated with the cemetery. The range of types is nevertheless of interest, also the evidence in one grave of post- ED survival of the upright-handled jar.7 24, UQ 563 (Iraq Museum). Single-lugged jar, rim and handle missing. Ht. 27-6 cm, rim di c. io*5 cm, base di. 9-4 cm. Partly fine buff clay, partly coated with bitumen, including band beneath rim. Sharply incised decoration. Context : Grave 52. Although in all probability the broken stump of the handle is of a wing-lug, this jar is included here because of its similarity to Diyala pots of the same type, with decoration concentrated around the lug, a feature which appears on ED I upright-handled jars in the Diyala region, the incision being then concentrated around the upright handle (Delougaz 1952, PI. 76a). 25.

On the other hand the pinched base, on analogy with Diyala pottery, would argue for an earlier date. However, small, plain upright-handled jars, like small plain stemmed dishes, 7 A m?lange of finds from various graves set out as a single burial, including an upright-handled jar (Fig. 6 No. 27 below) is one of the attractions of the Iraq Museum. The vessels illustrated here are those that were available for study there in 1976, and are not intended to constitute a complete corpus of all upright-handled jars and stemmed dishes found at 'Uqair.

The handle has appliqu? decoration, and is somehow like the way country women in Iraq today draw their abbayas up under their noses. It is also similar to a handle from Abu Salabikh (Moon 1981, Fig. 8 No. 45). Three Gutium seals were found in this grave, and in another grave on the site this type of seal is associated with one that is early Akkadian.8 28? UQ428 (Iraq Museum). Stemmed dish, complete.

This dish demonstrates just how crude and amateurish attempts to manufacture this sort of pottery can become. The notching has been done with a knife, incidentally slicing the depression under the rim. 29. UQ. 558 (Iraq Museum). Stemmed dish, complete. Ht. 16-4 cm, rim di. 15-0 cm, base di. 16 -4 cm.

This is a more elaborate form of stemmed dish, again remarkable for its crudity.

Context: Grave 33. *Uqair produced not only extraordinary stemmed dishes, but abo at least one that is very close to typical Diyala ED IIIA specimens. Tell Madhhur Neither upright-handled jars nor stemmed dishes occurred in the occupation levels at Tell Madhhur. This is probably because the Early Dynastic assemblage there pre-dates the introduction of these forms. This is supported by the high incidence of painting as a form of decoration, which at Khafajah at least becomes rarer during the ED II period when upright-handled jars and stemmed dishes come into fashion. Painted upright-handled jars are found in the Hamrin valley at Tell Raz?k and Tell Sabra (reported in Postgate and Watson 1979, 177, 178), and also at Tell Jeokha, near Ramadi. 32. Un-numbered.

The gypsum was merely pushed into the cavity between the broken handle and the jar. The fourth jar (not illustrated) also had a broken handle, but this had not been mended. At Kish too there was evidence that grave pots were not always in perfect condition : "a few of the jars were slightly broken when placed in the graves ; the missing pieces were not to be found, though each grave was carefully cleared by Colonel Lane or myself " (Mackay 1925, 23). 34? 6G : 45.

Fairly coarse pink clay. Undecorated. Much vegetable matter in temper. Possibly hand-made. This jar is again essentially similar. The publication of this and other large graves at Tell Madhhur is forthcoming. Their precise date is not yet settled, as the pottery, though plentiful, seemed to have few close published parallels. A third millennium date, late rather than early is likely : perhaps the Akkadian period. This is supported by the metalwork finds. Tell Madhhur marks the northern limit, in eastern Mesopotamia, of the known occurrence of upright-handles and of Scarlet Ware. Susa During the Early Dynastic period there was a close relationship between Elam and southern Mesopotamia. This expressed itself both in trade and contention. " Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta " demonstrates the former point, and various Sumerian rulers had cause to take up weapons against Elam, in defence or aggression. It comes as no great surprise then to find similarities between the Early Dynastic assemblages of pottery at Susa and the Sumerian cities.9 Unfortunately nothing is now known about the following vessels but that they come from Susa and were considered by the excavators to be pre-Sargonic. The good state of preservation suggests a funerary origin. Upright-handled jars With only one exception all the upright-handled jars in this collection are of the anthropomorphic type. 36.

No. 41 is the only hollow handle in the collection, and No. 39 the only one without human features, having instead an unusual punched and incised pattern. The applied face on No. 41 resembles more a horned rather than a human creature (cf. Delougaz 1952, PL 87 Nos. 1-q). Many of the handles have a dent or rough patch behind the top, apparently caused by contact with the rim of the vessel, as on Nos. 36 and 37 above. Some of them have representations of the pubic triangle, as at Kish, but not at Abu Salabikh or the Diyala sites. Perhaps this is an ED IIIB feature. Stemmed dishes 45? Un-numbered.

This one is virtually plain, and again well-paralleled at Kish (Mackay 1929, PL XLIX No. 10) and Khafajah (Delougaz 1952, C.365.810D). Some of these upright-handled jars and stemmed dishes display characteristics apparently peculiar to them, but in general they are not unlike the same sort of vessels from Mesopotamia. They echo the same problem as the Kish pots : while they are more like Diyala specimens from late ED IIIB than from other periods they cannot be taken to corroborate the sequence there while they remain un- provenanced. Stemmed dishes from Ur Stemmed dishes occur at Ur, not only in pottery, but also in stone, copper and silver. Grave 1130 contained a harp and a metal stemmed dish (Woolley 1934, PL 239 Type 101), for instance. Despite the comparative simplicity of the illustrated types (Woolley 1934, PL 266 Types 242, 243), the pottery stemmed dishes from Ur are more elaborately decorated than any others discussed here. " Insistence on ornament when all the rest of the pottery is plain must mean that the offering table is in some way distinguished by</page><page sequence="19">UPRIGHT-HANDLED JARS AND STEMMED DISHES 57 Fig. 9. Scale ? -.5. its functions from purely utilitarian vessels " (ibid., 389). The special status of the stemmed dish among grave furniture is further emphasised by its unusual position as set apart from the other offerings (ibid., 387). However, to surmise further that " it is because it is an offering table and therefore dedicated to the service of the gods that it is singled out in this manner " (ibid., 389) is to move out into the realm of pure unsupported conjecture. Decorated pottery stemmed dishes occur in 35 graves at Ur. Unfortunately it is usually no longer possible to reconstruct which dish came from which grave. Most of those which survive in the British Museum are discussed here, the majority un- registered. Very broken ones that were more or less the same as better examples have been omitted.10 49.

Graves 379, 1391 and 1603 are Predynastic B, the rest are Predynastic A. According to Nissen's dating the graves with stemmed dishes are fairly well distributed through his phases : two are " Royal Tomb ", three " erster unterer Teil ", two " Meskalamdug ", four " erster mittlerer Teil ", five " erster oberer Teil ", one "erster oberer/ zweiter unterer Teil ", one " fr?h Akkadisch " and two " zweiter unterer Teil " (Nissen 1966, 163 ff.).</page><page sequence="20">58 JANE MOON Fig. io.

Delougaz 1952, PL 173 C.3?.0?) but as the latter vessel type is not reported from Ur, then presumably this pot is in fact a stemmed dish.

This stemmed dish has a hanging branch either side, terminating in a group of punched dots, pre- sumably meant to be dates. This same motif is observable at Abu Salabikh (Moon 1981, Fig. 12 No. 73). 56. BM 121986. Stemmed dish, dish missing. Pr?s. ht. 46-0 cm, base di. 33? 2 cm.

Two holes in base. As well as the tree, triangle and geometric base pattern this vessel has two long doors in the stem, with little square windows above. It is very similar to one from Abu Salabikh (Moon 1981, Fig. 13 No. 81). In this instance the incised lines flanking the opening are flanked by a triangular device, similar to a pattern on a chisel from Grave 832, interpreted by Woolley as a cuneiform sign (Woolley 1934, 304). There are also rings either side of the doors. Posts with rings are frequently used to represent doorways (Amiet 1961, 16 No. 271 ; Hansen 1963). 57. Un-numbered. Partial stemmed dish.

Un-numbered. Stemmed dish, dish missing. Pr?s. ht. 36-0 cm, base di. 34-0 cm. Incised decoration. The entire preserved surface of this stemmed dish is covered with incised designs. A different sort of plant appears as well as the usual palm branch, with what would appear to be a fat carp feeding at its roots, and some kind of fruit interspersed with its branches. Perhaps the plant is meant to be an aquatic species, like the sammu of the Gilgamesh epic. There is a panel consisting of three verti- cally arranged St Andrews' crosses, and opposite, a different design of two vertical panels. At least one Ur stemmed dish had modelled bulls like a specimen from Abu Salabikh (Moon 1981, Fig. 13 No. 81 ; Woolley 1934, PI. 180b). As upright-handled jars do not occur at Ur, with one exception and one other possible handle (Woolley 1934, p. 388 PI. 187), it seems that the stemmed dishes have partly taken over the feminine characteristics normally displayed by the later ED III upright-handled jars. The other symbols which occur on these stemmed dishes are intriguing. Roughly similar arrangements of lines are provided by some cylinder seals, but these, being so small, deal in a sort of pictographic shorthand, and it is difficult to be sure of the significance of some of the representations. Parallels also occur among pictographic cuneiform signs. This is not to propose that the citizens of Ur liked to write on their stemmed dishes in an archaic script, but the known meaning of the pictographs offers suggestions for interpretation of the incised symbols. The symbol of the incised triangle means " woman " : ? SAL, (Falkenstein 1936, Sign No. 2i).^p^HA is " fish ", (ibid. No. 83). The doorway with pillars and rings can also mean " Ishtar ", ^^rd(ibid., No. 208), which further emphasises the female aspect of the dishes. More equivocally, the fringed square is slightly similar to the sign^? (Falkenstein 1936, No. 322) and to ?&lt;?gf (ibid., Nos. 273 and 320), which may mean " wash ". Tell al- Wilayah A considerable amount of Early Dynastic material, including evidence for upright-handled jars and stemmed dishes, was found at Tell al-Wilayah, possibly to be identified with the ancient Kesh. The site was dug in 1958 by the Directorate General of Antiquities of the Iraq Museum, under the directorship of Dr Tariq Madhlum. The original report appeared in Arabic (Madhlum i960), and a trans- lation and commentary of some aspects of the seals has been published by Dr Subhi Rashid (Rashid 1963). A report on the tablets found was produced by Mr J. N. Postgate (Postgate 1976). Two detached handles were found on the surface (Madhlum i960, PL 9 Nos. 10 and 11). They are strikingly similar to those illustrated above from Susa (Nos. 36, 38 and 40). IM 61150 has crossed incised bands across the body, the lowest triangle thus formed being hatched, as on Nos. 36 and 38 from Susa (see above). On IM 61150 the maximum width of the handle at the very top and the square set of the eyes are just the same as on No. 40 from Susa (see above). At Wilayah, Area II (Madhlum i960, Plan Ila) disclosed the partial plan of two substantial houses. From one of these came most of the tablets, the bulk of them Ur III in date, but including some that were Old Akkadian (Postgate 1976, 78). The second house was partly constructed of planoconvex bricks laid herringbone</page><page sequence="25">UPRIGHT-HANDLED JARS AND STEMMED DISHES 63 Fig. 13. Scale 1:5. style and was considered to be late ED III in date on account of the pottery (Madhlum i960, PL 3 Nos. 7, 16, 17, 28 and 32). In Area III another large building was found, also built of planoconvex bricks, and considered by the excavators to be a palace on account of its similarity to the palace of the rulers at Tell Asmar. This building seemed to be divided into two by a pair of blocked doorways : "Es ist erw?hnenswert, dass wir im westlichen Teil des Palastes keine Funde machen konnten, nicht einmal solche von geringer</page><page sequence="26">64 JANE MOON Bedeutung. Wir schl?ssen daraus, dass dieser Teil in sp?terer Zeit nicht mehr benutzt worden ist". (Rashid 1963, 85).1X Room I, the largest, contained a few fragmentary tablets, all Old Akkadian, except one which was Ur III, and various other Akkadian objects including seals (Madhlum i960, PL 4 Nos. 1-4, PL 5 Nos. 1-4). A rather long, decorated stemmed dish was found in Room 12 (ibid., PL 3 No. 26). None of the rest of the pottery found in the western part of the building (ibid., PL 3 Nos. 1, 5, 13, 19, 25, 27), would quarrel with an Akkadian date.12 The position of the stemmed dish " im Schutt " is not very satisfactory, but suggests an association contemporary with the occupation or the destruction of the palace rather than with its originad con- struction. Rashid emphasises the Early Dynastic elements of the seals, the plano- convex bricks of which the palace was built and the similarity of the ground plan to the palaces at Eridu and Kish. However, he concedes that " der Palast bis in die Akkad-Zeit hinein in Benutzung gewesen ist" (Rashid 1963, 85). The stylistic connection of the upright-handles with those from Susa is especially exciting in view of the geographical position of Tell al-Wilayah. In his consideration of the identification of Tell al-Wilayah with Kesh, Postgate remarks that " the combination of the architectural and inscriptional evidence yields an interesting picture of Kesh as sharing with Adab in the Early Dynastic period the control of a major water-borne trade route which connected Sumer with the north-east and so with Elam and the Iranian plateau " (Postgate 1976, 81). He also draws attention to the recognition of a " Tigris-Gruppe " among seals from Tell al-Wilayah, Khafajah and Susa. Development of upright-handled jars and stemmed dishes Single-handled jars can be traced back to the protoliterate period (Delougaz 1952, PL 231, from Sin Temple IV at Khafajah). During the ED I period the relatively uncommon scarlet-ware was mainly single, wing-lugged jars (ibid., 58), suggesting such jars may have had special significance. These " beaked " jars were also made at Mari and Susa and later ones bore incised decoration like that of the earliest upright-handled jar (e.g. Delougaz 1952, C.515.373). Spool-lugs were also used as single handles (Postgate 1978, 87, Fig. 3 No. 1), and some begin to look like upright-handles (Moorey 1966, PL XI, 1930. 243a, e). Many of the ED II graves at Khafajah contained long thin hollow stands sup- porting small dishes (Delougaz 1952, 0.357.000b). It is not unreasonable to sup- pose that the later stemmed dishes served the same purpose, whatever that was, but conveniently combined both pieces, as suggested by Delougaz (ibid., 85). The separate stands were sometimes made out of metal at Kish and Khafajah, as were stemmed dishes at Ur. 11 In the following discussion we assume that " ?stlichen " was in fact meant instead of " west- lichen " (following the Arabic ^ ^?J! (Madhlum i960, 80), as all the finds are, in fact, listed as coming from the western side. 12 The Diyala comparisons worked out by Madhlum (Rashid 1963, 86) give dates ranging from ED II to Larsa, but most are not convincingly similar to the Wilayah examples.</page><page sequence="27">UPRIGHT-HANDLED JARS AND STEMMED DISHES 65 Function The nearest one can come to deciding the usual function of upright-handled jars and stemmed dishes is to guess.13 The majority of those surviving were found in graves, but this does not imply a specifically funerary function, for graves pre- serve pottery so much better than other contexts. There is no reason to suppose the crockery for a dead person's use to be much different from what he used while alive. For whatever principle differences are supposed to exist between this world and the next, human societies frequently expect domestic details to be the same, as in Egyptian tombs for example. What little is known of Sumerian views of the after-life is difficult to reconcile with ob- served funerary practice. A recently-discovered text affirms that " there was food and drink in the underworld but one might not partake of it " (S. N. Kramer 1979, in a paper presented to the XXVIth Rencontre Assyriologique Internationale at Copenhagen). This accords ill with the many well-documented Sumerian graves full of pottery that have been found. Similarly, the occasional presence of these types in temples cannot be taken to imply exclusively ritual use : the Sumerian temple was the house of the god, and equipped accordingly.14 ED I cylinder seals sometimes show large jars being carried by two people with the aid of ropes (Amiet 1961, PL 90 Nos. 1191). The decoration on certain ED I jars seems in fact to imitate ropes or string (e.g. Postgate 1978, 87, Fig. 3 No. 2), as does that of the ED I upright-handled jar found in the Abu Temple at Tell Asmar (Delougaz 1952, PL 87a). The incision on the shoulder of this jar is confined, as already noted, to the area of the handle. The connection, however, does not survive, for upright-handled jars soon come in a variety of sizes and styles of decor- ation and lose any resemblance to single-lugged jars. Later specimens are not conveniently lifted by their handles, particularly when full (Mackay 1925, 23), and those with human features afford but an uncomfortable grip. Spout handles were introduced later, and disappeared again at a still later date. Delougaz' suggestion that "jars with solid handles were used chiefly for storing dry substances, those with spout handles, though without real spouts, were intended for liquids " (Delougaz 1952, p. 84) does not seem to have any foundation. Spout handles are more efficient, being easier to attach firmly to the shoulder of the vessel. The jars obviously had some household function. On purely modern analogy the closed shape suggests liquid storage. Spouted jars were used for drinking beer, and while this does not preclude the same use for upright-handled jars it is persuasive of seeking alternatives too. Mackay's suggestion that they contained water for washing is tenable (Mackay 1925, 23). The washing of the person is considered a rather special act in most societies, and calls for a special container. Ritual washing survives in many religions, such as Islam or Catholicism, especially on entering a place of worship. And even modern agnostics reserve separate basins for washing themselves and their food dishes, a practice which predates universal appreciation of 18 They did have extraordinary functions : one upright-handled jar at Khafajah had been used as a jewel box (Delougaz 1952, 103, PI. 107b). 14 Nine plain upright-handled jars were, however, found built into the altar of the North Temple at Nippur (see above p. 47).</page><page sequence="28">66 JANE MOON the principles of bacteriology. A special use for the jars must be sought if one is to explain their elaborate decoration when plain pottery was the fashion. Stemmed dishes could be simply the washbasins to go with the water-jars. Such a use does not, however, accord well with our previous suggestion for their development from the earlier separate stands and dishes, which would have been unsuitably shaped for such use, being too small. Equally, there is no evidence that they were offering stands. The possibilities for such a versatile shape are endless. It occurs in many parts of the world at different times (Delougaz 1952, 85 note 1), and can still be seen in the modern English bakery or butcher's shop. The slits which appear occasionally in the lower part of stemmed dishes were presumably decorative. Some at least were meant to represent doorways, which of themselves are frequently objects of superstition and special treatment, adorned with symbols such as winged bulls or horseshoes. The holes, on the other hand, often paired, do not seem to be decorative : Delougaz suggested they may have been used to secure handles of some sort (Delougaz 1952, 90). None of this offers any satisfactory reason for the persistent association of these two types, best demonstrated by the " Cult Wagon " found in an ED II level of the Sin Temple at Khafajah (Delougaz 1952, 85-86, PL 83), nor for the obvious feminine attributes of at least some of them. Fertility is often associated with exaggerated female features, and the representation of fruiting date trees may be connected here. Mackay suggested the upright-handled jars may have been used in the cult of Inanna (Mackay 1929, 74), but of course this is only imagination, and only a textual reference could settle the point. Apart from the fact that fertility was universally desired and prayed for by pre-twentieth century societies, its equivocal shadow here offers us no further leads. Distribution The distribution map (Fig. 1) shows that upright-handled jars and stemmed dishes occur together at sites in Akkad, and to the north, at Khafajah, Tell Asmar, Sali' el-Jumr, Kish, Abu Salabikh, Nippur, probably Bismaya, Tell al-Wilayah, Susa, Tell 'Uqair, Fara (Heinrich 1931, 41-43, 50-51, PL 18) and at Mari. Stemmed dishes alone occur in southern Babylonia, in Sumer proper : al-Hiba, Ur, al-'Ubaid (Hall and Woolley 1927, PL LX, XCVIII), and probably Telloh (de Genouillac i934&gt; PL 63 1,3, PL 65 1). Neither type has yet been reported from Uruk, Umma, Eridu or Larsa, though there was Early Dynastic occupation at these sites. Upright- handled jars alone are at present confined to rather isolated incidences at Isin and in the Hamrin region. Many of these sites are of course insufficiently investigated to make final pronouncement on what is definitely absent from them, but there is enough evidence to begin an attempt at explanation. The Sumerian cities were all in touch at the political level, attacking, conquering and re-conquering one another. And political relationships were not confined to nearest neighbours : Eannatum of Lagash conquered Kish, destroyed Susa, and fought Ur, Uruk and Mari. But these dramatic events had no influence that we can distinguish on pottery styles. Trading relations might reasonably be expected to throw a little more light on our problem than state politics, but in fact trading patterns for this date cut right</page><page sequence="29">UPRIGHT-HANDLED JARS AND STEMMED DISHES 67 across the groups of places distinguished above. Texts from Lagash, for instance, include records of commodities sent to Adab, Elam, Nippur and Uruk. There is no equivalent of the Kengir League for the late Early Dynastic period. Ninizkimti, wife of the ruler of Adab, sent Baragnamtara, Lugalanda's wife, a pot of herbs (Lambert 1953, 58-59), showing that some pottery must of course have moved physically from place to place. And the " Names and Professions List " of Abu Salabikh lists " several individuals further identified by the name of what seems likely to be their home town (e.g. Adab, Sippar), and if this interpretation is correct it may indicate the mobility of artisans and craftsmen" (Biggs 1967a, 62). So it is quite feasible that potters moved from town to town too. Certain aspects of the literary texts for this period suggest special relations between certain cities, but the groups do not correspond exactly with the ceramic divisions we are concerned with. Writing of the Abu Salabikh texts Biggs has remarked " there appears to have been considerable communication among the cities of Sumer, not only of a commercial nature, but scholarly as well " (Biggs 1967a, 26). Copies of the same text turn up at different sites : an ED version of the Instruction of Shuruppak occurred at Abu Salabikh and Adab, and duplicates of a list of professions are found at Abu Salabikh, Gasur and Kish. The contents of the tablets are interesting, but so is the way they were written, and by whom. In his comments on the tablets from Ibla, Gelb pointed out " various elements culturally linking Ibla to Abu Salabikh, Mari and the Kish tradition. These ele- ments are : similar literary traditions at Ibla and Abu Salabikh, the same dating system at Ibla, Abu Salabikh and Mari ; and the same scribal conventions at Ibla, Abu Salabikh and in the Kish tradition " (Gelb 1977, 15). Also, there are indications that the similar scribal traditions are linked with ethnic origins. At Abu Salabikh various philological points " suggest the use of Akkadian or a Semitic language, contrary to the Sumerian tradition of Fara " (Gelb 1977, 8). Nearly all the men who copied out the Abu Salabikh tablets had Semitic, not Sumerian names, and the point of this lies " not only in their being Semitic, but in their being the names of scribes, thus suggesting that at least in this particular city, Semites were well- established and were active in the intellectual life " (Biggs 1967b, 60-61). Shuruppak, on the other hand, seems to have been a Sumerian-dominated city, having closer political ties with the south (Jacobsen 1957, 121). But there remains the possibility that " our data from Shuruppak, Adab and other cities, which provide mostly names of workers and work-supervisors, of whom practically all have Sumerian names, give us a somewhat distorted picture " (Biggs 1967b, 66). Thus it is not easy to distil from the m?lange of scraps of information left us a clear understanding of the interrelationships between the cities of Babylonia during the ED period. Moreover, the Diyala sites cannot be fitted into the scheme at all, as references to them do not occur further south, though it is interesting to note that Akkadian occupation in that region can be supposed before the ED III period (Jacobsen 1957, 109 note 26). Ibla has a completely different ceramic tradition from that of Mesopotamia. If one accepts that " the Sumerians were at home only in Sumer proper. . . . Other parts of Mesopotamia including Akkad, the Diyala region, Assyria, and the regions round Mari, were populated and dominated by Akkadians and closely</page><page sequence="30">68 JANE MOON related peoples " (Gelb 1977, 14), then it is possible to draw a tentative line south of Abu Salabikh and Nippur and place Semitic literary traditions and upright- handled jars to the north of it, and " proper " Sumerians to the south, with Shuruppak and Adab as a border region. But the evidence as it stands is really too thin, and we are left with a tantalizing problem perhaps peculiar to the threshhold between prehistory and history.
