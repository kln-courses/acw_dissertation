<plain_text><page sequence="1">A CONSIDERATION OF HEBREW i 11) BY A. A. MACINTOSH Cambridge The aim of this article is to indicate that s?i means more than the English word rebuke denotes, and to this end the evidence of the ancient versions, of comparative philology, and of usage will be reviewed. The verb nl occurs twelve times in the Hebrew bible, the noun .1ya sixteen times, and mnn.. once. The root 'i and its derivatives are consistently translated rebuke by A.V., R.V., and R.S.V. Similarly, BRowN-DRIVER-BRIGGs' Lexicon gives the single translation rebuke, simply dividing the entries of both the verb and noun into two parts, depending upon whether God or man is the subject of that activity. KOEHLER-BAUMGARTNER'S Lexicon gives schelten (rebuke) as the meaning of the verb, and of the noun Schelten and Drohung (menace) 2). The ancient versions display less unanimity in translating the word, yet it may be said that, on the whole, they too use words which ap- proximate to what is meant by English rebuke. Thus, the LXX translates by rLT-i.Liv/&amp;TLrT-rpit4 in about half the instances of 'S7 in the M.T. iztrrT-Cv has the overtones of moral censure; it means to lay value upon, and (of judges) to penalize, censure. In all but two instances the Vulg. uses increpare (increpatio) to thunder (of Jupiter), to exclaim loudly against someone, to chide. The Targ. almost always renders by lT was angry, rebuked, and the Pesh. by ka" rebuked, chid 3). The general impression is, therefore, that in translating *i1 1) A shortened version was read to the Society for Old Testament Study in January, 1969. I am indebted to Professor D. WINTON THOMAS for much help and advice. 2) KOEHLER-BAUMGARTNER'S Hebrdisches und Aramdisches Lexikon (1967) adds for the verb, Zurechtweisen, and for the noun, Raige. 3) The Aramaic and Syriac derivative nouns are N"!IttZ and kdtha. Dictionaries consulted were: Greek, LIDDELL and SCOTT; Latin, LEwrs and SHORT; Aram., M. JASTROW, G. H. DALMAN; Syr., PAYNE SMITH.</page><page sequence="2">A. A. MACINTOSH the Targ., Pesh. and Vulg. used words that denoted rebuke in the sense of angry chiding. The LXX seems to have understood the word in terms of authoritative censure or moral rebuke. The versions, however, do not invariably use these words, and to some of their interesting variants we shall advert below. Philology From the philological side 's? is deemed by some scholars to have the basic meaning of to shout, cry out 1). Ethiopic ge'era means cried, groaned 2). In Syrian Arabic ja'ara means bellowed 3), and in colloquial Egyptian snarled 4). Among three occurrences of the verb g'r in the Ugaritic texts is one in which the word describes the symptom of a sick horse 5). C. H. GORDON translates the verb roar, and describes roaring as an "ailment familiar enough to those who know horses" 6). Indeed, the term roarer in English is used of such a horse. The root occurs in South Arabic proper names, and for these Ryckmans 7) cites Arabic ja'ara passed excrement 8). The use of 'll in Mal. ii 3, in association with ttin dung, may contain an allusion to this meaning, but generally such a meaning does not illuminate Hebrew ln. Aram. and Syr. is_ g'ar are listed by JASTROW and PAYNE SMITH 9) as meaning rebuked. However, the words are very rarely used in Targ. or Pesh. to translate the Hebrew cognate. For those instances where they are used, see below. On the theory of the biliteral origin of Hebrew roots 10), the sig- nificance of v\ seems to have been onomatopoeic and to have denoted 1) See JOUON in Biblica 6 (1925), pp. 318 ff.

K. IRVINE (School of Oriental and African Studies, London) in a private communication has stated that there are to date six Sabaean instances of the namesyg'r and tg'r, and also there is the Qatabanian clan-name g'rn. 8) This is the meaning given the word by E. W. LANE, Arab.-Engl. Lex., p. 429. 9) opp. citt. DALMAN (p. 85) regards 5?a as a Hebraism, and gives it the meaning screamed at (anschreien). 10) e.g. G. R. DRIVER, Problems of the Hebrew Verbal System (1936), pp. 3ff 472</page><page sequence="3">473 a rumbling sound, and the quaking that is associated with it 1). Thus, in Hebrew mnz indicates the convulsing of the throat which effects a lowing, bellowing sound. tya: means quaked and is used of the waves of the sea. Further, V (Ly ?) is used in Ben Sira xiii 22 2) as an onomatopoeic expression of contempt 3). On such a theory 'ir signifies the expulsion of sound denoting disgust or anger.4) We may suggest, then, that from the evidence of philology -i~ originally described those physical reactions, including roaring/ growling that were observed to be coincident with passionate anger. Such considerations are well illustrated by the use of words in 2 Sam. xxii 16, Ps. xviii 16: i_ n.'n r ni:. l,7 nrt_?. The use of ;n'r in parallelism with words denoting the bodily expression of very strong anger is noteworthy. The words as a whole denote snorting fury. Context and Usage Both God and men are the subjects of the verb S7. Israel, priests, the sea, nations, Satan and the wicked are amongst its objects 5). The question arises as to whether rebuke in the sense of authoritative reprimand/moral censure is all of, or at all, the meaning of S: in every instance of its use in the M.T. Thus, does the M.T. really mean that God reprimands the sea in the sense that is normally given to that word in association, for example, with Joseph's receiving a paternal rebuke for his impertinent dreams (Gen. xxxvii 10) ? Attention, therefore, must be directed to every instance of the word in the M.T. and judgement made as to its meaning from the evidence available, including the evidence of context. Two categories of usage become apparent from such a study. A. Instances where 'n= seems to denote anger, or angry protest rather than rebuke in a moral, judgemental sense: 1. In Ruth ii 16 Boaz commands his young men: "Pull out some of the sheaves for her to glean, n; .iS n iW". 1) See G. R. DRIVER inJ.S.S. vii (1962) p. 15. He notes that I and 7 are "com- monly found in verbs expressing sounds produced deep in the throat, when they emerge through the mouth, or in the bowels when they emerge through the vent". 2) R. SMEND, Die Weisheit des Jesus Sirach Hebr. u. Deutsch. 3) The expression is D SZ7 XWI; SMEND translates rufen pfui. 4) It is a common feature of Hebrew to express feelings and emotions in physical terms; Cf. D. WINTON THOMAS, Understanding the O.T. (London, 1967), p. 21. 5) For the references, v. infr.</page><page sequence="4">A.A. AMACINTOSH The question arises as to whether the injunction means that the young men should refrain from delivering a moral reprimand or from shouting an angry protest, for either interpretation fits the context. The Pesh., however, witnesses to the latter, using the verb bar barked, yelped 1). 2. Isa. xxx 17 rtnr nl _ zo. [B.H.3 n_r' after LXX] -rrm .. The context is that of defeat in battle, and moral reprimand is hardly appropriate. The LXX renders by aSt&amp; Opwvv ev voc (ps6ovrcxL ZXtot and the Vulg. by Mille homines a facie terroris unius. These versions may be said to interpret rrs?l in the sense of the physical expressions of wrath, and cpcov] (LXX) suggests more particularly an angry noise. 3. Gen. xxxvii 10. Joseph has told his dreams and the result is ';x in .l:_"i. The idea of moral rebuke may be said to fit the context precisely. We may wonder, however, whether strictly the denotation of 'vl in this phrase is not that of angry protest, while the connotation remains that of a paternal reprimand 2). B. With regard to the second category of instances of 'i, where (usually) Yahweh is the subject of that activity, the meaning of the word is again to be seen in the expression of his wrath and its results rather than in moral reprimand. Attention has frequently been drawn in recent times to the substantial character of the spoken word in Hebrew thought 3). If the word of God does not return to him void, then we may expect that his roar of angry protest will have similar powerful effect. Indeed, the anger of God may be seen to effect the paralysis of the curse4) in its object. First, we may turn to passages where the object of Yahweh's nii1 is the sea: e.g. Nah. i 4 .neS.l -' n -ia. To the difficulties of stating that Yahweh subjects the sea to a considered moral reprimand we have already alluded. What seems to be meant is that the sea is cursed, even exorcised, and the effect of that powerful word is seen in its being dried up. To this interpretation the LXX gives support, using the verb &amp;icsCrXZv to threaten, menace. With 2 Sam. xxii 16 (Ps. xviii 16), 1) The phrase is wlad tdhrnabh. 2) The customary translations are used by the versions; v. supr. 3) e.g. G. voN RAD, Theology Vol. 2, F. 4) J. PEDERSEN (Der Eid bei den Semiten, 1914, p. 82) briefly compares '1S with tlTl, and suggests that the connotation of cursing was to be discerned in both. Ql7? (Arabic tazaggama groaned (camel): spoke angrily (man), Syr. zCam blamed), displays a similar semantic development to 'S1. 474</page><page sequence="5">475 already cited, we may compare the words of Isa. lxvi 15 1), where lK is again parallel to '8v. Here the LXX translates by 7roax&lt;opXac[zt6v derived from the curse 'q x6poxocq to the crows/ad profanum 2). Support for such a view of Yahweh's effective anger in the world of nature may also be discerned in Ben Sira xliii 13. Here his ;rSv provokes the lightning 3). In SMEND'S edition lnmlll is printed in the margin and IMs7S in the text 4); his preference for inSvl is confirmed by its occurrence in the text of the Masada Scroll 5). rnn:a as a variant (see YADIN, p. 9a) may be held to indicate a meaning for ns1:i which is consistent with the idea of God's powerful and effective anger 6). Secondly, passages in which the objects of God's ;nsw are hostile nations, the wicked, Satan etc. are capable of the explanation that they are rebuked. On the other hand it may be argued that God's reduction to order of such forces is often depicted in the language of his victory over the primaeval sea, and that '3 properly denotes again his anger and its effective result. For this interpretation there is contextual and versional support. Thus, Isa. xvii 13: pni?. ? o- i3 -_1. The preceding verse explicitly likens the threat of political enemies to that of the primaeval sea. The LXX again translates 's~ by &amp;tro-xopaxs.tLv (v. supr.), and the Pesh. by g'ar, where normally kd" is used. g'ar does mean rebuked, but its passive participle g'ira means vile, odious, abominable which may be held to indicate that the active meaning is stronger than that of rebuke 7). Other passages which may be put in this category are Pss. ix 6, lxviii 30 (where the beast is interpreted by all the versions in terms of the ungodly/foreigners), lxxvi 6, lxxx 16 and cxix 21. A similar connotation for fi3 may be discerned in its use in Prov. and other texts adverting to wickedness and disobedience. While rebuke in the sense of moral reprimand is apparently very appropriate, the actual meaning of the word may be seen to be 1) The text runs: 1t ;1 .1 i_ R nn nl 1 .~. 2) The other passages where 'IVI is used in connection with the sea are: Job xxvi 11, Pss. civ 7, cvi 9, Isa. 1 2. 3) See SMEND, op. cit. t11l is translated hetgen. 4) I. LEVI, L' Ecclesiastique, prints Inl?l1 in the text and IBs'I3 in the margin. 5) Y. YADIN, The Ben Sira Scrollfrom Masada (1965). 6) In Ex. xxxii 8 7'1121 is associated with shouting, and there may, therefore, be an allusion to Yahweh's roar of anger in this text. For LXX rpo6aocy,ta v. infr. 7) See PAYNE SMITH (op. cit.) ad loc. The Pesh. only elsewhere uses gcar for 151 at Zech. iii 2, and at Mal. ii 3; both passages are discussed below.</page><page sequence="6">A. A. MACINTOSH continuous with that already adduced. On this argument the use of nI in the sphere of ethics originally denoted the threat of the effective anger of God and the extermination of wickedness by the curse, to which the man of discrimination was particularly sensitive, and from which by his prudence he sought to be free. The versional evidence of two passages in Prov. may be held to support this view. (a) xiii 1: ;riz nt_ x? r,. is rendered by the LXX u6O? 8 a&amp;vzxooG ev &amp;toXs[lc, and by the Targ. nn x9pz R', where xnsn means terror 1). (b) xvii 10: For M'rI in this verse LXX and Pesh. read a&amp;reXtL, zuhdmd threat, and the Targ. again uses RnI. In Deut. xxviii warnings concerning disobedience are given in the form of conditional imprecation 2). Deut. xxviii 20 records that, in the event of disobedience, .ntn.iM-nrK ;Rrrli -nR =. nrp. ntn?. nn .n-mnx. The noun nnSia is found in close association with nni and its derivative rnita 3). BRICHTO has shown that the underlying idea of ixt is the "curse from the operational point of view"; it is the imposition of a "ban or barrier, a paralysis on movement or other capabilities". The second noun, from the tir has the force of confusion or panic 4) induced by war or divine judgement and is opposed to iz'W well-being. The LXX interprets such an operational curse more particularly, with vAsLoc poverty, axXoczt hunger, faintness, and &amp;avaXoo0 wasting ruin 5). BRICHTO suggests that the phrase as a whole is a hendiadys, having the meaning "a curse sent to chastise and confound". 6) At all events it seems clear that what is sent by Yahweh is the curse in the material, operative sense that it reduces men to confusion and deprivation, and that nimn denotes some part of that operative curse. Similarly, 'i: may be seen to have the connotation of the operative curse in Mal. ii 3. The words run: toi .n"n st. nrr-n.x n.R -Si "' '; I., ':*.*,--: -V.* - *I. V T * : ::?..-5_ The LXX reads yB &amp;copco ipiZv ro v bitov, apparently 1) nS31 was excited, afraid, agitated. There would seem to be no reason to derive the word from WI, which in any case means much the same thing. Cf. JASTROW (op. cit.) I p. 183, and DALMAN (op. cit.) p. 61. 2) The nature of the curse both here and in the O.T. generally is comprehensive- ly treated by H. C. BRICHTO in The Problem of 'Curse' in the Hebrew Bible (J.B.L., Monograph Series, xiii, 1963). 3) So, too, in Ps. cxix 21. 4) See BROWN-DRIVER-BRIGGS, adloc.; Arab. hama rushed about madly is cited. Like '71, the word is basically onomatopoeic, cf. rHVH, 7H. 5) Whether financial or pathological is not clear. &amp;ava[axetv i. to squander, lavish, ii. to destroy. 6) op. cit. p. 113. 476</page><page sequence="7">477 reading :ht arm for S't seed. PROCKSCH 1) moreover, thinks that acpopiLv implies Hebrew sn. (cut off). If, however, n1 implies that an effective curse was uttered by God against the crops 2) in answer to the unworthy action of the priests of Malachi's time, then acpopL[Evt might have been an appropriate translation 3). The Pesh. again uses the stronger g'ar, possibly because the word was known to be associated with cursing, and its exact preservation, therefore, was of importance. For the mention of the spreading of dung upon the faces of the rebellious priests in close association with the word 1n, see p. 472 above 4). The jussive phrase of Zech. iii 2, tyin I= nn. 5;, n W, was described by PEDERSEN 5) as a "curse-formula". Confirmation of this assessment may be found in what has been argued above concerning the force of n~r. The prayer is rather that the evil power of Satan be exorcised than that he should receive a moral reprimand. That the Pesh. and Targ. both preserve the actual word nXl (and the latter only here) may be held to represent a desire on the part of the translators to preserve the actual Fluchformel 6). The difficulties of interpreting the Ugaritic Texts are notorious. However, two occurrences of g'r in them, not previously discussed, and usually translated rebuke 7) may be compared tentatively with the usage of Zech. iii 2. In the first (BAAL iii A 28) Athtart "rebukes" Baal when the latter is about to destroy completely Yam/Nahar 8). 1) KITTEL, B. H.3 2) See also Mal. iii 11, where :'1 is used in connection with the destruction of crops (? by locusts). 3) SI7C cut off is frequently used in association with curses; for &amp;cpopi6etv in association with curses, see Luke vi 22. For a prophetic curse against the arm of the sacrificing Jeroboam, see 1 Kings xiii; this story may well have influenced the LXX's translation of the passage before us. 4) For the demonological significance of dung, see STEUR and SAUNDERS, Ancient Egyptian and Cnidian Medicine (1959) p. 67; also, e.g. H. B. SWETE, The Gospel of Mark (1908), p. 64 (On Beelzebul). 5) op. cit. 6) Such an exorcistic usage of ^V1 occurs in the Genesis Apocryphon(xx 28): KR1W t RN'l jnl = 1 1nn '1nnl is translated by GREENBERG" Let this evil spirit be exorcised from us". BRICHTO, op. cit., p. 95n (BRICHTO mistakenly omits the word Xnlr). 7) So G. R. DRIVER, Canaanite Myths and Legends (1956). Similarly AISTLEITNER (op. cit.). The citations which follow are from DRIVER'S text. 8) That gcr is used in connection with, but not of, Baal's defeat of Yam is noteworthy. The conservatism of religious language is well known, and it may be that the biblical use of the word depends for its authority upon this earlier Caananite use.</page><page sequence="8">A. A. MACINTOSH That the "rebuke" is dependent for its efficacy upon the spoken word seems to be emphasized by the fact that Baal is "rebuked" by name, and by the words that closely follow: as the speech came out of (her mouth, her word out of her lips, and) Victor Baal was ashamed at her. In the second instance (BAAL iii B 22), the cowed Gods raise their heads in confidence at the "rebuke" of Baal, and face with him the challenge of the embassy of Yam/Nahar. We may leave open the question as to whether g'r is these instances primarily denotes moral reprimand or an effected change in the power and influence of the gods who are the objects of the verb 1). The normal translations of ann in the versions by words signi- fying moral rebuke must now be considered. All these words 2), although differing slightly in meaning, may be held to have the con- notation of censorious rebuke. More particularly, sxmLt[lv of the Greek versions has the specific overtones of moral judgement. These traditional translations of the M.T., at the head of which stands the LXX, may be held to be a reflection of the intense moral and legal nature of post-exilic Judaism and afford evidence that, at least from the third century B.C. onwards, the Jews understood the word nli primarily in these terms. Further it is not without sig- nificance that the only occurrence of the verb 'v in the Pentateuch is in Gen. xxxvii 10, where the context is that of a father's dealing with his son. That the Pentateuch was the first section of the Bible to be translated into Greek is most probable 3), and on this assumption it becomes likely that the motif of moral rebuke should be associated with later occurrences of -IS. Some examples may be cited to suggest that the versions tended to replace the earlier motif of God's angry and powerful word by that of moral rebuke and paternal authority. Such versional interpretation (for as such it must be accounted) may also have been influenced by anti-anthropomorphic tendencies. 1 Mal. iii 11 4) nll =1 n.n_a. The LXX runs xoa L careXX uLarv eLSq Sp&amp;CtL, reading 5?1 food for "5? locust(s). The translation of the word La6rzXXetv is not easy 5), yet the words would seem to 1) The use of '111 in Jer. xxix 27 may also, perhaps, be interpreted not so much as a moral reprimand, as an exercise in discrediting the prophet and his word to the exiles (cf. LXX auXXotsopZv = to revile, abuse). 2) For the words, v. supr. 3) e.g. 0. EISSFELDT, Introduction to the O.T., p. 703. 4) For the denotation of '5S here, see on Mal. ii 3 above. 5) 8taaCrXXetv to send through &gt;to part (of the air, by sending through)&gt; (in Plato) to distinguish; but in LXX and N.T. usually to give orders, command. 478</page><page sequence="9">479 mean: I wil give orders toyou in regard to food (i.e. I will give minatory torah) 1). 2. Mal. ii 3, quoted above. The Targ. renders: Behold I rebuke (lTn) you with (3 of instrument) the increase of the land, and I will uncover the nakedness of yor sins uponyour faces. The euphemistic language here used is characteristic of the Targ 2)., and the total sense of the verse moves from the sphere of God's effective ;aln into that of moral rebuke for sinfulness. 3. Ps. cxix 21. Thou hast rebuked (rY ?) the proud, cursed (n'.i.) are they which wander from thy commandments (R.V.). That the psalm is concerned with Law and discipline is clear from every verse. It is, then, readily comprehensible that the versions use their characteristic translations of moral rebuke. 4. Ps. lxviii 30 (M.T. 31). Rebuke the wild beast of the reeds, the mul- titude of the bulls with the calves of the peoples ... (R.V.). All the versions have interpreted the beast in terms of the ungodly 3), and S71 in terms of God's moral rebuke of them. The Pesh. and Targ. appear to have in mind specifically the sin of idolatry. Again it becomes clear why the words characteristic of moral reprimand are used. Summary By way of summary, we may state that nl denotes in origin an aspect of the physical expression of anger; it is used to denote angry protest: when God is the subject its connotation is both his anger and the effective working out of his anger. An extension of such meaning, which is consistent with later Jewish understanding of God, is that of authoritative moral reprimand 4), and in this way the word was mostly interpreted and understood in ancient times. 1) The occurrence of p6aTraypia commandin LXX Ben Sira xliii 13 (Hebrew quoted above) is of interest. For the LXX, at least, nature responds to the just orders of God. 2) cf. J. F. STENNING, The Targum of Isaiah, p. xvi. 3) e.g. LXX q auvayty?3 T6Cov raO6pCov. Targ.: the camp of the wicked. 4) Greek ipt3pi&amp;aOo60, used by Symm. to translate '7.V in Isa. xvii 13, affords an interesting parallel to the semantic development of 'V1. In AESCHYLUS (Sept. c. Theb., 46) the word denotes the snorting of horses. In LXX Dan. xi 30 the word is used of the threatening attitude of the Romans towards Antiochus, and in Lam. ii 6 i1:X :1Z becomes in the LXX z'iPp, ti',cr' 6opyG ociuoti. The word occurs in Mark i 43 where it is translated by A.V. charge strictly. In John xi 33 and 38 the word is given the meaning be moved with emotion by D. WINTON THOMAS in Exp. Times, Jan 1933. H. C. KEE, N.T.S. 14 (1967/8) pp. 232 ff., in an article seen after this paper was written, has considered '1v in relation to wrplztvv and 43pLiiia0aoL in the healing stories of the gospels, and has suggested that these words have an exorcistic use.</page></plain_text>
