Meeting of the Aristotelian Society at 21, Bedford Square, London, W.C. 1, on November 7th, 1955, at 7.30 p.m. I.-SOME MERITS OF HEGELIANISM. THE PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS. BY J. N. FINDLAY. I I wish to devote the opportunity afforded by this presidential address to a congenial task: that of doing something towards rehabilitating the philosophical reputa- tion of Hegel. I wish to stress some of the neglected merits of a philosopher who impressed himself on a whole age of German thought, and who influenced thought in this country for a period no less considerable. I do so in fear and trembling. For, from being a name to conjure with, Hegel's reputation and the attention devoted to his works have now reached " an all-time low " (to quote Mr. Gellner from last year's Aristotelian Society Proceedings): from being a writer little read but greatly admired, he has become a writer read not at all but made the target of incessant and inordinate abuse. He has, in particular, had to bear a fierce onslaught at the hands of my valued friend Karl Popper, who has not only revived the old Schopenhauerian accusations of fraud and charlatanism, but who has also indicted Hegel (and those who study him) in the following words: " The Hegelian farce has done enough harm. We must stop it. We must speak even at the price of soiling ourselves by touching this scandalous thing which, unfor- tunately without success, was so clearly exposed a hundred years ago. Too many philosophers have neglected Schopen- hauer's incessantly repeated warnings; they neglected them not so much at their own peril (they did not fare badly) as A</page><page sequence="2">2 J. N. FINDLAY. at the peril of those whom they taught, and at the peril of mankind ". In the face of this solemn warning, and in the face, too, of my own great admiration and affection for Professor Popper, it requires some boldness to defend Hegel. I cannot, however, allow that a form of thought which has seemed to so many (myself included) to make sense of so much in their thought and experience, can deserve such an immoderate characterization. Hegel is of course condemned in good company: he is lined up with Heraclitus, Plato, Aristotle and Karl Marx. But while the others have either found enthusiastic rehabilitators, or are perhaps past needing any, it does not seem to me that enough has been done in this way for Hegel. I shall therefore try to wipe off some of the mud. My office of rehabilitation is also an office of personal piety. For Hegel was, with Henri Bergson, the very first philosopher to rouse me out of my own unreflective slumbers-such wakenings were not rare in those days- and I have since lived through over thirty years of philoso- phical activity with the ring of his sayings in my ears. This ring has in fact become louder with the passing of time, and Hegel's sayings have never ceased to have a telling, sometimes poignant application to a great deal in my ordinary and philosophical experience. I have lived long with the beautiful statement that a progress into infinity is not the true infinite, which consists rather in being at home with oneself in one's " other ", or with the statement that " the consummation of the infinite End consists merely in the removal of the illusion which makes it seem yet unaccomplished ", or with the still more famous passage in which " the True " is compared to a Bacchic orgy in which not one member is sober, but in which, owing to the noiseless collapse of each member into its neighbours, there is none the less only simple and translucent repose. Such statements may be too Pythian for Professor Popper, but they illuminate me; though they mnight not do for the iron rations carried in the packs of modern philosophers, they are meat and drink to such as myself.</page><page sequence="3">SOME MERITS OF HEGELIANISM. 3 The value of these Hegelian sayings has shown itself, also, in my experience, by their sheer survival among the constant flux of other forms of philosophical talk. At first they went accompanied with the pattern of talk and argument practised by Caird, Green, Bosanquet, Bradley and the British idealists. When this pattern of talk no longer satisfied me, I found my appreciation of Hegel's talk undiminished: like the moon he took up his place at the end of each new vista of words as I travelled, and revealed aspects of realism and even of materialism not previously suspected. At a still later date I found echoes of the Hegelian dialectic in Wittgenstein's dissolution of philoso- phical puzzles: the very words he used sometimes had a Hegelian ring. Thus Hegel who thought ordinary language to be " divine ", and who held that it sometimes turned men's meanings in other directions than they had intended, might very well have said that " the problems arising through the misinterpretation of the forms of our language have a character of depth ", that they are " deep disquietudes, whose roots are as deep in us as the roots of our language and whose significance is as great as is the importance of our language ". I have felt, moreover, that the whole development of our British thought over the past half-century is a museum- specimen of Hegelian dialectic. It started with a firm proclamation of the Understanding (in the special Hegelian sense of that word) to the effect that " everything is what it is and not another thing ", it turned with distaste from the loose rules and shifting distinctions of everyday speech as from the evasive fluidity of the idealists, it fragmented the world neatly into a vast range of independent entities- points, instants, qualities, relations, propositions, sensibilia, sensa, non-naturalistic predicates and so forth-and it then proceeded to lay down a number of separate dogmatic principles, as undoubted in their truth as they were clear in their sense. The advance of the century saw an ever increasing amount of this notional and dogmatic furniture falling into disrepair and disrepute, and revealing itself A 2</page><page sequence="4">4 J. N. FINDLAY. riddled with obscure antinomies; even when its outer form remained solid, its inner analysis seemed maddeningly unclear. At length hardly anything of the whole brave structure remained, and a Hegelian return to Reason set in, which took the form of reinstating the complex, ill-defined, ever developing usages and shifting boundaries of ordinary language, together with a clear understanding, born of the frustration engendered by Russellian antinomies, of the wisdom implicit in such rules and usages. Such understanding is no more than a modern version of the self-consciousness which is central for Hegel. My one regret is that this British return to Reason has been relatively flat and unsubtle, that it has not achieved the many-dimensional richness that it might have had by preserving as well as overcoming the turns and twists of Russellian thought. Such richness it might have kept, had men been steeped in Hegel's method and spirit. In dwelling on Hegel's merits, it is not my intention to be scholarly and detailed: I shall not enter into the lists with M. Hyppolite or with other modern commentators. Though I believe that my statements have an adequate textual foundation, being based rather on many utterances of Hegel than on single, special ones, I shall not try to justify them this evening. I shall try rather to put an " interpreta- tion " upon Hegel, to show him in a special light, to behold him modelled and relieved in terms of the slants and attitudes of our own time. It is characteristic of the major philosophers that they permit of such treatment, that they have special mouldings and faces for particular epochs. Quite obviously the Plato of Marsilio Ficino is not the Plato of Nettleship, just as the Plato of Nettleship is not the Plato of Ryle: the same is true of the ever changing imago of a Spinoza, a Hume or a Kant. Hegel has not, however, in this country at least, been allowed to share in these interesting changes of chiaroscuro: having first been shown in the light cast by the later Victorian and Edwardian eras, he has not been allowed to benefit from subsequent angles and degrees of illumination. His teachings are, in the main, associated</page><page sequence="5">SOME MERITS OF HEGELIANISM. 5 with a subjectivist epistemology, which believes the universe to be a construct of thought, or to exist only as experienced or felt. He has also been associated with the most extreme of monisms or holisms in which nothing whatever can be, or be conceived, apart from some single, total, all-comprehen- sive system in which it is embedded. It has also been connected with a transcendent absolutism which is willing to hold that Reality, as it reveals itself in unmutilated experience, will need to be talked of in ways differing entirely from those in which we talk of the things of our mutilated and imperfect experiences. Now it is not my wish to deny either the importance or the originality of the British idealists, even though this may now seem more purely provincial and more largely historical than was previously allowed. They were thinkers in their own right, who were not Hegelians, thought they had learnt much from Hegel. Nor am I concerned to deny that the roots of their thought are in Hegel, or that Hegel can be developed in the way in which they tried to develop him. I only wish to deny that the light in which they saw Hegel is the only or best light in which to regard him, or that it accords best with the illumination of our own time. It is clear, for instance, that the British idealists made extremely small use of the dialectical element in Hegel's thought: they did not reason in triads, nor did they overcome oppositions in higher unities. What advance there was from lower to higher grades of truth and reality was extremely smooth and undramatic: they know nothing of what Hegel called " the seriousness, the suffering, the patience and the labour of the negative ". Or if they began with a phase of contradictory breakdown, as in the first part of Bradley's Appearance and Reality, they were soon moving on the high plateau of an absolute reality, in which all contradiction, all mutilation and all development had been left far behind. The notion of a spiritual reality perpetually at work in comiing to full consciousness of itself, and requiring diremption, opposition and self-estrangement in order to</page><page sequence="6">6 J. N. FINDLAY. achieve such self-consciousness, and whose actual achieve- ment of self-consciousness was inseparable from the process by which it was achieved: this, the most valuable and characteristic of the doctrines of Hegel, received only scant attention from the British idealists. When something like it was momentarily envisaged (as by Joachim in The N'ature of Truth) it excited only painful recoil. The absolutism of the British idealists was without the tragic aspects essential to the Hegelian absolutism. The background from which the British idealists approached Hegel, and the aims that led them to study him, also differed widely from those present in Hegel's period or in our own. Having discovered the merits of Kant at much the same time as they discovered those of Hegel, they tended to emphasize too strongly the relatively tenuous umbilical cord which connects the thought of Hegel with that of his predecessor; in so doing they achieved a distorted view of either philosopher. They saw Kant merely as an anticipator of Hegel, and Hegel merely as a follower and developer of Kant. If they recognized the debt of Hegel to the Greeks, they interpreted those Greeks in terms of their own epistemological subjectivism. They also read into Hegel notions of seamnless unity and coherence which had really been derived from Spinoza: they failed, in Hegelian terms, to make the complete transition from Substance to Subject. They were, further, men of the Right, concerned mainly to defend religion against scientific positivism, life and purpose against dead mechanism, spiritualism against materialism, the higher values against the crassness of utilitarianism, and a semi-mystical, conservative view of society against the atomistic individualism and liberalism of their own day. They called in Hegel to assist them in this battle. In so doing they put a gravely one-sided interpretation upon him, since Hegel's teaching, as is well known, permits as ready a use by the Left as by the Right. (I am now referring to the legitimate developments of Hegel by men like Feuerbach and D. F. Strauss, rather than to</page><page sequence="7">SOME MERITS OF HEGELIANISM. 7 those of Marx and Engels, who seem to me to have been "born on the wrong side of the blanket ".) As the philosopher of the " absolute negativity ", who believes in no other absolute than pure, self-related, self-determining self-consciousness, Hegel is in fact as essentially the philoso- pher of the Absolute Left as of the Absolute Right. Circumstance, advantage, temperament and personal de- terioration may have pushed Hegel more and more into the service of the " closed ", as opposed to the " open " society: in the essentials of his doctrine he belongs to both or neither. It is therefore important that we, who are trying to revalue Hegel, should make a clean sweep of the interpretations put upon him by our predecessors, and that we should try to see what picture emerges for us when we have combined the unprejudiced study of his works with our own special interests and critical approaches. II What then shall I say are the main merits that recom- mend Hegel to contemporary attention? I shall begin by praising him as the philosopher who above all others is most completely free from transcendent metaphysics, who is most essentially the philosopher of the Here and Now, rather than of the Yonder or the Not Yet. For him what isjenseits, what lies beyond the immediate and apparent, is a notion only put up to be overcome, it enjoys no more than a postulated or background being, its whole function is to give depth to what is actual and present. Of course Hegel is in one sense a metaphysician, in that he describes the world of experience in countless subtle categories, in that he sees it in " lights " in which it has never before or since been seen. He was not, however, concerned to go beyond this world of experience, nor even to complete it in a manner exceeding ordinary human ability. The world in which Hegel's thought moves, and whose deepest " truth " is held by him to be spiritual, is no other</page><page sequence="8">8 J. N. FINDLAY. than the world in which earth and sun and moon and the planets exist, in which there are heat, sound, light, electricity and other natural forces, in which there are plants, animals and reasoning men, in which professors are called to fill university chairs, battles are waged by invading emperors, and in which there are cabals, scandals, marriages, publications, seminars and summer holidays. Hegel may not have been as explicit as Moore in telling us that he does not doubt the existence of these things, but such is plain from his practice. Nor does he differ profoundly from Moore in seeking to substitute for accounts of things which are only in a superficial sense correct, other accounts which probe the notions of the things in question, and which are said, in a special Hegelian sense of the word, to bring out their " truth ". The Hegelian " truth " of such common- or-garden facts and realities is of course quite different from any Moorean analysis; for Hegel the " truth " of anything involves a relation to self-conscious Spirit, which is not the case with the analyses of Moore. The fact remains that neither philosopher wishes to subvert, nor even to add to our ordinary certainties, but merely to re-conceive or re-state them from the special standpoint of philosophical reflection. That Hegel's philosophy has such a this-worldly com- plexion may appear dubious to those who see him through the spectacles of Bradley or McTaggart or Joachim, who know him to be a philosopher of the Absolute, and who take the Absolute to be a systematic whole of the most utter coherence and comprehensiveness, in which all the facts of everyday experience are to an inconceivable extent trans- formed and rearranged. The completeness, the coherence, the rearrangement and the transformation involved in the Hegelian Absolute are however quite different from anything contemplated in the British pattern. For the supreme manifestations of the Hegelian Absolute are not to be found in a transcendental sphere: they are simply to be found in art, religion and philosophy, and their highest expression is in philosophy. And by philosophy Hegel does not mean</page><page sequence="9">SOME MERITS OF HEGELIANISM. 9 the sort of universal insight that might be enjoyed by an Aristotelian or a Thomist God, but simply the insight that was enjoyed by Hegel himself, and that may likewise be enjoyed by other philosophers. In so far as the Hegelian Absolute exists at all, it exists in explicit form in the sort of address that I am now giving, and that you are now hearing. And it also existed in less explicit form when you last said your prayers or attended chapel, or when you visited the Tate Gallery or wrote your last poem. And it also exists, in infinitely more confused form, in the proceedings of Parlia- ment or in the varying rules and usages of English life, as well as in the institutions and customs of peoples less civilized, until it sinks at last, in complete self-forgetfulness and self-estrangement, into the externality of material nature. That the absolutism of Hegel dissolves transcendent absolutes is shown, moreover, in Hegel's well-known criticisms of the Kantian thing-in-itself, which is held to be the most emptily abstract and therefore the most readily knowable of entities. It is also shown in his criticisms of the' supersensible Laws and Forces, introduced for explanatory purposes by the natural scientists of his day. These Laws and Forces were referred to a level of being deeper than the merely phenomenal, but Hegel has no difficulty in showing them to be devices of the Understand- ing, which creak and break under philosophical pressure, and which do no more than disengage the universal element present in the observed behaviour of natural objects. There is nothing in the non-metaphysical modern philosophy of science which is not be found in Hegel, even if stated in somewhat bewildering language. In much the same manner Hegel deals with the transcendent absolutes of unmystical religion: being set apart from man and nature, they become confessedly finite, and therefore not divine at all. It is true that Hegel claimed to be a believing Christian, but his Christian- ity was of the mystical stamp of Meister Eckhart or Angelus Silesius, a view for which God's being would remain</page><page sequence="10">10 J. N. FINDLAY. unfulfilled were it not shown forth in man and nature, for which man's worshipful consciousness of God cannot be distinguished from God's consciousness of Himself, and for which the Incarnation, Passion, Resurrection and other Christian mysteries are not uniquely bound up with remote events in Judaea, but with relationships and processes present in the world and in the worshipping individual. It would seem that the Hegelian Right, which read into Hegel serious belief in an Absolute otherwise realized than in human self-consciousness, have scarcely anything, beyond Hegel's politic ambiguities, to go on. Hegel says, of course, that his Logic studies the eternal essence of God as it existed before the creation of nature and finite spirit. An examina- tion of its contents reveals, however, that this pre-existence means no more than the abstract subsistence of certain thought-determinations, whose incapacity for unexempli- fied being is, in fact, the nerve of the subsequent transition to the more concrete treatment of nature and spirit. It would seem, finally, that it is wholly foreign to the thought of Hegel to believe in an all-inclusive total system of experience, which sums up and goes beyond what is con- tained in the experiences of particular persons. The Hegelian Absolute lives in many persons, but it lives in them severally and not collectively. Hegel certainly affirmed the Truth to be the Whole, but this statement was immediately followed by others in which this Whole was said to be one which perfects itself through its own development, and which is as much process as result. An all-inclusive totality would moreover be infinite in a manner which Hegel, living before the time of Cantor, regarded as self-contradictory and " bad ". We cannot argue the point, but it may be held that the " true infinity " of the Hegelian Absolute is no more than a finitude which is freely variable, and which realizes itself to be such. Thus I achieve absoluteness and infinity in the moral life when I accept some concrete system of laws and customs which will in general be those of the society in which I live: my infinity consists in the fact that I recognize</page><page sequence="11">SOME MERITS OF HEGELIANISM. 11 other choices to be equally proper in other historical circumstances, and as therefore in principle identical with my own. These notions may perhaps palliate Hegel's apparent deification of the Prussian constitution of 1830. III Having praised Hegel for his avoidance of transcendent metaphysic, which accords well with the spirit of modern philosophy, I shall next praise him for the fluid, developing, dialectical character of his thought. Hegel seems to me to have introduced and practised a form of thought which is the eternally necessary counterbalance and complement to the exact and rigorous thought practised in mathematico- deductive systems, a form of thought which has only too often been the sole, model and exemplar for philosophy. Hegel recognizes to the full the value of such mathematically inspired thought, which is called by him the thought of the " abstract Understanding ". It is a thought which gives notions greater fixity and definiteness than they have in ordinary use, and which tries to disentangle them from their manifold, vague relations of relevance to other notions, thereby " sterotyping them in their isolation " and making them function in a vacuum. It is also a type of thought which turns vague certitudes into clear-cut dogmas, making them more precarious in the process. And it is a type of thought whose inferential processes are studiously devoid of life or growth, and which become in the limit tautological. Hegel, we may note, recognizes the analytic character of the proposition 7 + 5=12, and the tautological character of arithmetical computation. He gives the Understanding poetic praise by identifying it with the marvellous power of death, a power which somehow manages to cut off from its living context what is not really capable of independent existence. But though it has a place both in scientific and philosophical thought, the Understanding never is a satisfactory philosophical instrument. If pressed too far</page><page sequence="12">12 J. N. FINDLAY. it develops a mysterious malaise: it breaks out in overt contradictions, or is felt at least to be strangely hollow and inadequate. It passes over into dialectic, which can only be cured by the higher thought proper to philosophical Reason. It is not hard to give meaning to all this, and to see that Hegel is right. Quite obviously there are many possible conceptual and inferential schemes in terms of which fact and experience can be categorized and ordered, and quite obviously there will be incompatibilities and conflicts among them. Quite obviously, too, the vague inexact notions of ordinary life have the germs of many such systems within them, and will develop overt conflicts when we try to make them exact. To force talk about the apparent and the real, the essential and the accidental, the individual and the universal and so forth, into the fixed harness of some strict conceptual system, and then to apply the whip of definition and deduction, is certainly to invite breakaways and an overturning of the buggy. And even when surface contra- dictions are avoided, there can still be the deeper contradic- tion of a form of thought and speech which is out of step with the purpose for which we intend it, or which neglects or leaves out all-important aspects of the matters we are trying to treat. Mechanism and analytical behaviourism furnish well-worn examples. We may then be able to hit on alternative forms of speech which will avoid the abstract narrowness of the systems in question. In all these cases we shall be faced by a choice among ways of saying things, between alternative modes of categorizing fact and exper- ience. Such situations are situations of hesitation at the crossroads: there can be nothing to tell us " where we go from here ". They are also situations in which contradic- tion, or self-cancelling movement in incompatible directions, has a necessary and profitable place: it is as profitable there as it would be merely disruptive in the working of some formal calculus. Now it appears to me that all this is involved in Hegel's dialectical practice, and in his treatment of such puzzles as that of Force and its Manifestations, the</page><page sequence="13">SOME MERITS OF HEGELIANISM. 13 Possible and the Necessary, the Universal and the Individual and so forth. There is an attempt to show in such cases that ordinary notions do not work out as we want them to work, that they result in conflict or obvious loss of sense, and there is also an attempt to provide concepts, sometimes in the same, sometimes in other fields, which are immune from the difficulties that have just been experienced. And it is the determination to avoid, not merely surface contradiction but the deeper contradiction of leaving out what is vitally relevant, which gives Hegel's dialectic its constant direction, and which makes it move towards ever richer and more concrete positions. Many of the objections to Hegel's use of dialectic would seem to be due to a total misunderstanding of its purport, often encouraged by Hegel's own misleading statements about it, which are far from agreeing with his practice. Thus it is thought that Hegel intends to disrupt the smooth working of ordinary concepts at the level at which they work satisfactorily, that he wishes gratuitously to introduce contradictions among them. This would of course be absurd and ruinous, as Professor Popper has pointed out. Contra- dictions introduced into a smoothly functioning deductive system will enable us to deduce any and every proposition, a result that is obviously not desirable. But Hegel is not concerned to disturb the working of the Understanding where it keeps within well-defined limits, or remains loyal to initial abstractions: thus he finds no contradictions in ordinary arithmetical computation. It is only when notions of the Understanding are pushed into new territory-Hegel cites the case of the infinitesimal and incommensurable in mathematics-or when friction arises at the boundaries of independently developed systems, or when systems are regarded from an outside, or as we should call it, meta- standpoint,-which discovers presuppositions of such systems which they sometimes ignore or override-it is only in such cases that a dialectical element enters into our reasonings, and that a movement towards a higher synthesis of Reason becomes necessary. There is, for instance, nothing wrong</page><page sequence="14">14 J. N. FINDLAY. about an abstractly economic or abstractly legal treatment of men in society. But such a treatment presupposes deeper relations which it properly ignores, and sometimes overrides, and with which it must, at a higher level, be brought to terms. It is further thought that a dialectical transition is no more than a new sort of deductive trantsition, having the same sort of necessity as the latter. Here Hegel himself is misleading, since he constantly speaks of " necessity " in the dialectical field, and uses the term " science " (Wissenchaft) of a dialectically developed series of phases. Despite the fact that Hegel draws a sharp distinction between a mathematico-deductive and a dialectical sequence, he seems to expect the same rigorous relation of logical consequence in the one case as in the other. This is of course impossible. A notion or position which is to remove the inadequacy or contradiction of other notions or positions, cannot follow from them, since the full consequences of what is inadequate and self-contradictory will perpetuate the same defects. Obviously the passage to notions or positions which remove inadequacies or contradictions, must involve an ascent, a creative start: it may " take off ", or be led up to, by notions which are inadequate or self-contradictory, but it cannot be their consequence. All this means that the dialectic cannot follow a single rigorous course as Hegel suggests that it can. There must be a large amount of creative arbitrariness in the discovery of new notions and positions which avoid the difficulties present in other notions and positions. Hence the often reprobated element of arbitrariness in Hegel's dialectic is no defect but a merit: it is as proper in dialectic as it would be improper in deduction. Hegel, in fact, never achieves deductive rigour in his practice: it is only his accounts of that practice which suggests that he is aiming at it. These accounts have led to such ludicrous and disastrous results as the Marxist attempt to turn dialectic into an instrument of scientific prediction. But where dialectic exists, there may be intui- tion, divination or improvisation; there cannot be anything</page><page sequence="15">SOME MERITS OF HEGELIANISM. 15 like exact prediction. The necessity of Hegel's dialectic is in fact much more like that of a well-conceived work of art than of a rigorous argument: it never excludes alternative prolongations, nor follows rules capable of precise formula- tion. This being the case, it is as absurd to blame Hegel because one phase of his dialectic does not follow logically from another, as it would be to blame Shakespeare because the end of Romeo and Juliet is not logically entailed by the beginning. Croce seems to have been the one commentator of Hegel who has both recognized and admired the poetic character of his dialectical proceedings. If the non-deductive character of Hegel's dialectic ceases to be objectionable, objection will also cease to the frequent occurrence of empirical elements in it. Hegel obviously used his dialectic to bring out the affinities, the obscure relations of relevance, the progressively deepening meanings in concepts derived from the natural sciences, the social sciences and the history of his day. He makes no attempt to deduce the content of such branches of knowledge in a priori fashion, but seeks rather to illuminate them, to find Begriffe, philosophical notions that fit them. Sometimes he backs the wrong horse in a scientific controversy (as in his determined preference for the ideas of Kepler and Goethe to those of Newton); sometimes, too, his dialectical re-state- ments fail egregiously to illuminate. But they often do illuminate our ideas in the most far-ranging and penetrating manner, as in the comparison of the interplay of natural forces to the mutual recognition of men in society, or as in his superb series of attitudinal portraits in the Phenomenology of Spirit. I need here only mention such a unique master- piece as the treatment of Master and Slave in this series. What Hegel has to say in these fields is at times as unscientific, and also as illurninating, as are the notions and interpretations of psycho-analysis, in many ways a Hegelian discipline. The fact that Hegel uses his dialectical art on empirical material is accordingly no defect but a merit: I am glad that so deep a student of Hegel as the Warden of Merton agrees with me on this point.</page><page sequence="16">16 J. N. FINDLAY. I shall here merely slip in a passing reference to the repellent fact that Hegel accords an objective, as well as a notional status to his dialectic, that he sees contradictions in nature and society, as well as in our thought about them. Such teachings may have been badly misapplied, but I do not think that Hegel is so culpable in holding them as he is generally thought to be. For apart from our patterns of thought and language the world cannot be said to be either self-contradictory nor yet free from contradiction. If we discuss the world in terms of a well-worked out, smoothly functioning system of notions, it will no doubt be free from contradiction, and this certainly is the best way to deal with it. But if we discuss the world in terms of half-worked out, imperfectly functioning notions, it may very well be said to declare itself in contradictory ways and to frustrate attempts to characterize it consistently and straightforwardly. It is clear, further, that the primary sense of " contradiction " applies to speakers, people who say things, not to whatthey say: it is I who can contradict myself, or you who can contradict me. Contradiction in this sense is undoubtedly part of the world, and there is no reason why, by a natural anthropomorphism-I borrow a word from Professor Acton -we should not transfer it to the things we deal with, which may, in a natural sense, be said to express themselves in contradictory fashion. I cannot in any case see why the demerit of contradiction should be attributed only to speakers and thinkers, and never to the things they deal with. The evil of contradiction lies, moreover, in its unilluminating and self-cancelling character, not in any supposedly virginal essence of the world. I think, finally, that we should prefer Hegel to contem- porary philosophers in that his dialectic is not merely a " passage from the familiar to the familiar ", but always an advance to richer notions representing famniliar notions at a higher level. Such an advance takes place in fact, whether verbally expressed or not. One cannot go through all the dialectical "experience " surrounding such notions as " substance ", " causality " and " knowledge ", without</page><page sequence="17">SOME MERITS OF HEGELIANISM. 17 such notions becoming wholly transformed in the process: their dialectical history will in a sense be written into them, as will also their " place " within the total system of our notions. And it seems to me that Hegel sometimes succeeds, in extremely difficult language, in indicating the array of puzzlements latent in a certain notion, as well as its resultant position in the economy of our thought. I shall sum up by saying that I think that the liberation due to the modern philosophical understanding of language and logic has for the first time put us in a position from which the Hegelian dialectic can be understood, and from which its merits and demerits can be intelligently assessed. IV I wish now to deal with what appears to me the main merit of Hegel: his subjectivism, his idealism or his basic stress on Spirit. For Hegel Spirit, Idea, Subjectivity are the infinite " truth " of everything, and nothing can be philosophically understood except as leading up to them, or as presupposed by them. It is important, however, that we should not confuse this Hegelian idealism, subjectivism and spiritualism with other doctrines which go under the same names. Above all, it is important that we should not interpret Hegel on the model of Kant, or rather on the model of certain passages in Kant. The interpretation of Hegel that I think wrong and misleading is one that regards him as teaching that the world exists only in relation to the mind that looks at it and thinks about it, that thought constructs or fabricates the world, and that the law and order we discover in nature were in some sense "' put there " by the contemplating and theorizing mind. This brand of productive idealism is the one propounded and never completely discarded by Kant: it goes together with his picturesque, unhelpful accounts of the Thing-in-itself, of the preexistent confused " manifold of sense ", of the industrious ordering activities of the B</page><page sequence="18">18 J. N. FINDLAY. "productive imagination ", and of the remarkable art of "schematism " whose secret lies hidden in the depths of the soul. These notions are all metaphysical in the bad sense of the word: they apply to processes of which we have never had experience, and of which it is impossible that we should ever have had experience. They are also, incidentally, the source of much of that megalomania, that exaggerated narcissism, which has led the Germans into their recent excesses: if there were sense in blaming a philosopher for the misdeeds of those whom he has only remotely influenced, then Kant is perhaps more responsible for the misdeeds of Hitler than Hegel. There are, of course, parts of Kant in which this mythological machinery fades into the back- ground, where the abiding lesson becomes that self-conscious subjectivity presupposes a lasting order of things in space, subject to laws which often run counter to the subjective trends of our thinking. It is in these passages that Kant's true greatness is to be found, and it is on these, it seems to me, that Hegel mainly builds. There are, no doubt, places where Hegel says things which suggest what I can only call the bad kind of Kantian idealism: possibly this represents a stronger strain in his thought than I, who wish to make the best of him, like to acknowledge. I believe, however, that the idealism of Hegel is different from the constructive idealism just mentioned, and that the passages in which he speaks of Spirit finding or recognizing itself in objects bear quite a different interpretation from the one commonly put upon them. The interpretation that I should like to put on Hegel is one involving considerable elements of a non-metaphysical realism, naturalism and even materialism: it makes it proper to regard self-conscious Spirit as the outcome and end of nature, rather than as its source. And it is an interpretation for which this realism, naturalism and mater- ialism are in no sense adventitious and peripheral, but of the deepest essence of Hegel's doctrine. Self-conscious Spirit, on the interpretation I am advocating, can only arise or exist in a setting of things which are in many ways its</page><page sequence="19">SOME MERITS OF HEGELIANISM. 19 antithesis: things that display rigidity and mutual external- ity, whereas in Spirit all is fluidity and interpenetration, things which behave mechanically and unintelligently, whereas in Spirit all is purpose and understanding, things which are without insight into themselves and their place the world, while in Spirit all is limpid self-consciousness. And Spirit must likewise first display itself in limited, mutually exclusive minds associated with material bodies, in order that it may rise in these to the consciousness of itself as immaterial, supra-personal and in the Hegelian sense, infinite ". That Hegel teaches such a limited realism, naturalism and materialism is not hard to establish. For while his system begins with Logic, this is no more than a study of the categories involved in the abstract possibility of a world: such categories must be allowed to " go forth freely as nature ", because it is only in nature, and in the mind that emerges from nature, that they can be anything whatever. They are, in fact, no more than a schematic prefiguring of what is concretely worked out in nature and mind. And the first half of the concrete part of Hegel's system deals not with Mind but with Nature: it studies the Idea in its complete "self-alienation" and "self-externalization ", states in which it is not merely other to everything ideal and spiritual, but even has the otherness of part to part which is character- istic of spatial existence. It is in this natural matrix that life and consciousness arise, and which they proceed industriously to dominate, both by understanding objects scientifically and by controlling them practically. They also rise from forms in which other conscious beings are merely there to be wiped out or enslaved, to forms in which they are regarded as sharing common thoughts, aims and feelings. In the end an order arises in which practically everything in nature bears the impress of mind, and practi- cally everything in mind bears the impress of what is supra- personal and universal. Men then become capable of the achievements of Absolute Spirit, of Art, Religion and Philosophy. Not all of this development is thought by</page><page sequence="20">20 J. N. FINDLAY. Hegel to have taken place in time: some of it is merely logical or ideal. Living before the era of evolution, Hegel did not believe in any temporal development in the realm of nature. But he did believe in temporal development in the higher achievements of self-conscious Spirit. We have seen that Hegel had no more than a verbal belief in the existence of any form of self-consciousness other than man's: Absolute Spirit, which is for him the " truth " of the universe, is fully manifested only in a few philosophers. It has, moreover, only made its appearance on the world's stage at a late phase in its history-Hegel holds no doctrine of an aeternitas philosophiae or an aeternitas philosophorum-the owl of Minerva, in the often quoted passage, only wings its flight when the shades of night are falling. It follows that, in the whole previous unphilosophical age of the world, that world existed only in natural forms which were, at best, implicitly spiritual, or in spiritual forms which had not as yet achieved full self-consciousness. In my own view, further, Hegel's rejection of temporal development in the natural world was wholly adventitious: had the doctrine of evolution been put forward in 1800, he would have embraced it whole- heartedly. He would have found absolutely no stumbling- block to his idealism in the beiief that the world had existed for long ages before the emergence of life and consciousness. Spirit would still have been prior in respect of " truth" even though nature was prior in respect of time. In what sense, then do I hold Hegel to have been an idealist, and how do I think that his views differ from those of the Marxists, or from those of many modern believers in " emergent evolution "? I think that they do so in several vital respects. They are idealistic because Hegel holds that the existence of a natural order, with its blindness, rigidity, contingency and mechanism, is a necessary precondition or presupposition of the existence of self-conscious Spirit. It is only if the world sets us a task, that our theorizing and practical activities will be called forth by it, and that we shall be able to rise to the conscious enjoyment of these activities, and so achieve full self-consciousness. In a world</page><page sequence="21">SOME MERITS OF HEGELIANISM. 21 without brute fact, puzzling discrepancies and bewildering detail there could be neither theory nor science, just as in a world without recalcitrant materials there could be neither technology nor art. In the same way the higher achieve- ments of morals would be impossible without an initial independence of persons and an initial brute conflict of their wills and interests. The Spirit, as Hegel calls it, is nothing without an Other to overcome: like the God of the German mystics, whose stanzas are never far from Hegel's thought, it would have to give up the ghost if it had neither world nor men to raise up and redeem. Hegel's system is also idealistic in that he holds that exter- nal nature is such as to permit a perpetual encroachment and overcoming by Spirit: its complexities are such as to yield progressively to the advances of scientific theory, just as its recalcitrant materials and initial brute struggles are such as to yield progressively to technology, morals and art. Nature is moreover such as constantly to anticipate and prefigure mind: there are analogues of self-consciousness in the performances of magnets, in the ways of electricity, and (of course) in the functioning of organisms. All this part of Hegel's doctrine seems to me much more sensible and acceptable than is generally allowed: I suggest that his philosophy of nature has been unduly denigrated. Its scientific background is no doubt outdated, but so will ours be in the course of a century. Hegel holds, further, that the world is such as to present us with beings whose behaviour is seen to express a consciousness like our own. Such beings offer us a mirror of our own consciousness, and thereby make self-consciousness possible: they also enable us to rise to various supra-personal standards in the spheres of science, art and morals. Hegel's system is also idealistic in that he holds that the world conspires to make us conscious of the facts just mentioned, to make us realize that the opposition of things to self-consciousness is necessary for the existence of self- consciousness, that it is, in a sense, a " moment ", an element i n self-consciousness itself. In this realization we become</page><page sequence="22">22 J. N. FINDLAY. reconciled to the externality of material objects, as to the otherness of our neighbour's minds: we see them as part of a game, as a foil, a spur and a mirror to self-consciousness. This last does not mean that we shall ever be able to explain nature down to the last detail or control it completely, nor does it mean that we shall ever wholly remove the disagree- ment and severance between ourselves and other persons. It means, in fact, the contrary: were such externality and otherness to be eliminated, it would lead at once to the elimination of self-consciousness. Such externality and otherness can, however, be eliminated in another fashion, inasmuch as self-consciousness realizes them to be necessary to itself. By a subtle shift of view, it can come to regard the process or activity of eliminating otherness and externality, as in a sense the very elimination that it aims at. This completely satisfactory vision seems to me the central notions of Hegelianism: it is what Hegel calls the " Absolute Idea ". This is the best account I can give of Hegel's idealism, which I think immensely more interesting than any other idealistic system. Why do I hold such idealism to be a merit of Hegel? I do so because it seems to me both a wholly legitimate and a profoundly illuminating way of thinking and talking about the world, and one to which as reasonable beings we are in a sense committed. It is wholly legitimate, since it neither denies nor goes beyond the facts of experience: it merely sees such facts in a peculiar light, in their bearing on ourselves, and on whatever we hold most precious and rational in ourselves. It is more than merely legitimate, since as human beings we must want to regard things as they affect human beings, and since as reasonable beings we must want to regard them from the standpoint of the requirements of reason. I agree, further, with Hegel that our various scientific, ethical and aesthetic norms and values, have their roots in our nature as conscious and self-conscious beings: they spring from the generalizing and unifying propensities proper to consciousness as such, as well as from the attribution of such consciousness to other beings like ourselves. I cannot argue the point here, but it seems</page><page sequence="23">SOME MERITS OF HEGELIANISM. 23 to me that our sad experience over the past half-century, in which Moore's non-natural predicates crumbled dialectically into the mere arbitrariness of personal emotion and decision, must drive us back to the sort of treatment of norms and values that Hegel has given. If this is so, self-conscious beings with their various scientific, ethical and aesthetic requirements are committed to acting as if the world were such as to satisfy the requirements in question, or, what is the same, to viewing the world as being such as to satisfy them. We are bound to look on the world as having secrets that we can penetrate, disorders that we can overcome, and conflicts of interest that we can adjust. We are, in short, committed to some strictly linited historicistic faith in an ever increasing coincidence between the " rational " and the " real ". This coincidence may require social and other formns of engineering to bring it about, it may be indefinitely, delayed, frustrated and circumvented, it can, in any case, never be complete, but we must look on the world as being such as to allow it, and even with some force to favour it. We must look on the world in this manner whether or not it satisfies our requirements, and our looking on it in this manner need not mean that we expect it to satisfy them: the world may however satisfy our requirements in varying degree. It is therefore a merit of Hegel to have viewed the world in a manner in which every being whose self-conscious- ness has risen to the supra-personal or rational level must of necessity view it. I shall end my talk by saying a few words about the main demerit of Hegel's philosophy. This does not, I think, lie in its concessions to political reaction: serious as these are, I think them peripheral to Hegel's thought. Had Hegel remained in Suabia or Heidelberg, and had he never breathed the air of the Brandenburg marshes, it is possible that they might not have become so prominent. But it is an immense defect of Hegel that his writing is so very difficult, that it requires far more effort than a thinker has a right to exact of others, and that it invites all the accusations that it has so richly received. This does not mean that I should</page><page sequence="24">24 J. N. FINDLAY. have wished Hegel to have substituted " clear or relatively clear propositions" (to quote Moore's description of McTaggart's emendations) for his dialectical treatments. I should only have wished that the difficult style of the Phenomenology or the Logic could have been more like the style of the Zusdtze added by Hegel's editors. To these editors, sometimes slightingly spoken of, an immense debt is due. They provide the gleam of light which encourages us to penetrate the jungle, and which first convinces us that all in Hegel is not crabbed and senseless. Hegel, like Wittgenstein, seems to have been better at the spoken than the written word: we should be glad, therefore, that so much of his actual talk has survived.</page></plain_text>
