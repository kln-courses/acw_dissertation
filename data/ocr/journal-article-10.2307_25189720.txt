A. GRIERSON, CLE., M.R.A.S. Introduction T HAVE been asked by ?lkondavilli G?vind?c?rya Sw?nii to offer the following pages to the Royal Asiatic Society. The Artha-pa?caka, written in Tamil in the thirteenth century A.D. by the celebrated Pillai L?k?c?rya, is quite the most important summary of the modern Bh?gavata doctrine of Southern India that we possess. A Sanskrit translation of this work by N?r?yana Yati was noticed, and its contents partly described, by Dr. Bhandarkar at the Vienna Oriental Congress of 1886 (Aryan Section, Proceedings, p. 101), and the information is repeated by him in his Report on the Search for Sanskrit MSS. in the Bombay Presidency during the year 1883-4, published in 1887 (pp. 08, 09). It is upon thi.s work, and upon another (the YoMndra-mcita-cltyik? 1 of Sri-niv?sa) described at the same time, that Dr. Bhandarkar founded his well - known account of the origin of the Bh?gavata religion, which has formed the basis of all 1 G?vind?c?rya Swam? informs me that a translation of this important work is under preparation. JRAS. 1910. 37</page><page sequence="2">566 THE ARTHA-PANCAKA OF PILLAI LOKACARYA researches into the subject conducted since then in Europe. To those who have studied G?vind?c?rya Sw?mis translation of the Bhagavad-Git? with R?m?nuja's com mentary, the author of the present paper needs no introduction. He has written several other valuable works dealing with the Bh?gavata beliefs of Southern India, which are perhaps not so well known in Europe. I may draw attention to his "Divine Wisdom of the Dr?vida Saints ", his " Lives of the ?zhv?rs " (the Bh?gavata predecessors of R?m?nuja), his " Life of R?m?nuja ", and his "Vade-mecum of V?d?nta". These are frequently quoted in the following pages. He has given me authority to edit his paper, and I have utilized the discretion thus afforded me to make one or two verbal alterations, and to omit a few passages that infringe the rule prohibiting the discussion of controversial religious topics in the pages of this Journal. I have also left out a few quotations from European writers on the Bh?gavata doctrines, whose views are familiar in this country and, however valuable, do not possess the authority of an Indian professor of the religion. In other respects I have left the article just as I received it. It is well known that modern Bh?gavatas are divided into two kalds, or schools of thought, commonly known as that of the North (Vada-galai) and that of the South (Teii-galai) respectively.1 The main difference between these affects the doctrine of Grace, the former teaching that God's Grace is " co-operative ", and the latter that it is " irresistible ". They also differ in the view held regarding the Goddess ?ri. The Vada-galais look upon her as a form or phase of the Supreme, assumed mainly for the purpose of spreading the truth, and, equally with Him, infinite and uncreate. The Ten-galais, on the 1 The so-called "Monkey-" {Marlcata-ny?ya) and "Cat-" (M?rj?ra ny?ya) schools. See JRAS., 1908, p. 338, and A. G.'s Vade-mecum, p. 45.</page><page sequence="3">THE ARTHA-PANCAKA OF PILLAI LOKACARYA 567 other hand, give her an independent personality. She is looked upon as the mediator between God and man, and, while from one point of view she is created by the Supreme, from another point of view she is one with Him. The Bh?gavata doctrines brought to Northern India by llfimfinanda, as expressed in the Bhakta-m?la and other works of the class, belong to the Vada-galai school, and therefore differ in some points from those enunciated in the following pages. The Vada - galais of Southern India, from whom these doctrines came, wrote mainly in Sanskrit, and their chief light was V?d?nta De?ika (A.D. 1268), who belonged to the generation succeeding Pillai L?k?carya (a.D. 1213). The latter was the first great teacher of the Te?-galai school, the textbooks of which are mainly written in Tamil. The doctrine of irresistible grace taught by L?k?carya demands a corresponding attitude on the part of the believer. This is known as prapatti, or self-surrender.1 It is a stage beyond bhalcti, which (like an infant monkey clinging to its mother) connotes active love and devotion, while prapatti (like the self-surrender of a kitten carried by its mother) is entirely passive. Prapatti, carried to its logical conclusions, entails the further doctrine that devotion and reverence are due to the mediator (?c?rya), who puts the postulant on the right way, and presents him to God as a soul to be saved. It will therefore be noticed that the Artha-pa?caka lays great stress on prapatti and ?c?ry?bhim?na, while the text books of the Vada-galais, including all those of Northern India, stop at bhalcti, and insist on the active participation of the soul in working out its salvation, with the loving co-operation of a merciful and gracious God. 1 This is the Te?-galai use of the word. Radically it means "approaching". Cf. prapadyatc in Bhg. G., vii, 19, and prajxtnna, ii, 7. Northern commentators translate this word by "hhajati", and hence virtually equate prapatti with bhakti. R?m?nuja's commentary is to much the same effect. Cf. also S?ndilya, i, 9.</page><page sequence="4">568 THE ARTHA-PANCAKA OF PILLAI LOKACARYA To me personally this translation is of particular value, as it corrects a mistake made by me on former occasions when writing about bhakti,?a mistake, I must confess, in which I have not been alone. Trusting to the best sense I could make out of one very incorrect MS. of the Sanskrit version of the Artha-jia??caka, I have more than once described those souls who arc classed as " k?vala," as souls that are "only" devoted to the Adorable. I have now obtained an excellent MS. of this work, and it, as well as G?vind?c?rya Sw?mis paper, shows that the real explanation of the term as given by Pillai L?k?c?rya is that k?vala here means " isolate ", and connotes those souls who seek self salvation, i.e. those who are content with realizing their own nature, by means of knowledge (juana), instead of proceeding to the more advanced stage of bhakti.1 As a further contribution to G?vind?c?rya Sw?mi's translation, I give, after his article, the text of N?r?yana Yati's Sanskrit version of the Artha-imncaka. This will serve two purposes : it will be useful for its own sake, and it will also help to show where the English translation of the Tamil original is literal, and where it has been expanded.2 G. A. G. The Author and his Works Sri Pillai L?k?c?rya, or B?la-L?k?c?rya, is called " PiHai " or " younger " because Nambijlai or Kalivairi Dfisa, hierarchically anterior to him by two stages in the apostolic succession, also bore that distinguished title, " L?k?c?rya," which means the same as " Jagad-Guru ". B?la-L?kfic?rya, or Pillai L?k?c?rya, or Ulag?rian, was born in 1213 A.D. (see Table in our Lives of the Azhv?rs 1 The necessary correction should he made in n. 1 on p. 109 ante. 2 G?viiul?cFirya Sw?m? informs me that N?rayaiia Yati's work is rather a paraphrase than a literal translation of the Tamil, and that in one or t wo passages he has either departed from or misunderstood the original.</page><page sequence="5">THE ARTHA-PANCAKA OF PILLAI LOKACARYA 569 or Dr?vida Saints), as the son of Vadakkut - Tiru - Vidhi - ppijlai, or Krsna - Sam?hva. He lived in times made troublous by Musalm?n raids, which overran even Srirangam, not excepting the holy shrine of Sri-Rangan?tha there enthroned. It is believed that the invaders sacked the place, and ruthlessly slaughtered the inhabitant?, only a few escaping from the general massacre. But this vandalism and sacrilege elicited heroism and martyrdom. L?k?c?rya was compelled to leave Srirangam to follow his Lord, Sr?-Rangan?tha, and to protect him from Muhammadan outrage. When he came to Jy?tish-Kudi he fell ill, and leaving his Holy Charge to the keeping of his followers, passed away from this world. L?k?c?rya is a star of the first magnitude in the galaxy of Sri-Vaisnava Divines, and his writings on philosophy and religion are considered to be precious gems of the first water. The sacred literature that flowed from his pen is the outcome of a long anterior religious and philosophic history of Hri-Vaisnavism, stretching down ageless from N?r?yana through Sri, and thence through the archaic ?zhvfirs and the mediaeval ?c?ryas. The style adopted for this literature is what is known as Mani-prav?la, or literature produced in the Dr?vida tongue (Tamil) happily blended with Sanskrit, so as to place philosophy and religion within the reach of the masses. L?k?c?rya composed eighteen Rahasyas or Secret Treatises, called " Secret " because their contents are to be hidden only from those who do not deserve to be initiated into the Science of the Spirit. So goes the verse? " Y? g?payaty ay?gy?n?rh y?gy?n?ih saihprayacchati." It is also said in the Muido-panisad? " Vidy? ha vai brfihmanam ?jag?ma g?p?ya in?iii ??vadhisth? 'ham asmi." So also did Krsna warn Arjuna in Git?, xviii, 67.</page><page sequence="6">570 THE ARTHA-PANCAKA OF PILLAI LOK AC AR YA The eighteen Rahasyas are? 1. Mumuksu-p-padi. 10. Navaratna-m?la. 2.

No. 4, the Sr?-vacana-bh?$ana, is a difficult and abstruse work, composed in the Sutra style. ?ri S. P?rthas?rathi Yogi made a scholarly rendering of it, to represent Sri -Vaisnavism in the Parliament of Religions held at Chicago in August, 1893. Our tradition chronicles that it is inspired, L?k?c?rya being himself considered as an a?i?a of the Lord Varada of K?ncipuram. This abstruse work can never be understood in all its intricacies unless read with the very lucid commentary by Varavaramuni Yogi ( = Manav?la Mah?imiui, 1370 A.D.).1 To translate it would be a formidable task, which yet might be undertaken if sufficient encouragement were forthcoming. Finally, this is what we wrote on p. 103 of our Vade mecum of V?d?nta : " This Vade-mecum of Viaist?dvaita Philosoph}' is but the antechamber to the Holy Halls of the Viaist?dvaita Religion."

The Muletas, or the Freed, are those who, by the grace of Bhagav?n (God), have been liberated from all the pains and taints contingent on their conjunctive existence with matter {prahrti) ; who taste in the fullest measure the blissfulness of Bhagav?n in all His several aspects of Essence {svar?pa), Person (r?pa), Excellence (giuja), and Glory, or the Pageant* (vibhava) ; who, by reason of such divine joy overflowing the bounds of their being, burst into p ans of praise, and so dwell for ever and ever, drowned in rapturous delights, in the eternal regions of heaven, called Vaikuntha,2 never more to return into the migrations of material existence. A 3. The BaddJtas, or the Bound, are those souls who are turned away from Bhagav?n (God): (1) by reason of their illusorily identifying their Selves (Souls) with the bodies which they wear; constituted as these bodies are of the five material elements?impermanent cause of joy and grief?corrupt, so that in the absence of the indwelling spirit (soul), they are unfit for sight or touch?and which breed the mental aberrations, such as ignorance (ajn?na), misapprehension (anyath?-jn?na), and reversed apprehension (viparUa-jn?na) ; and (2) by reason of their notion that pandering to the pleasures of the body (catered to by the fivefold thralls of objects, sound, touch, sight, taste, and smell) is the be-all and end-all of their existence. To secure such pleasures of sense, they infringe all the salutary dictates comprised in the system known as varna and d?ramo,,3 become slaves to worldlings, inflict cruelty on creatures, seize others' wives and wealth, and thus swell the ranks of the mundane. 1 Or Kosmic (apeshy, of God, as it were. 2 Literally, " the unfettered," i.e. " spiritual universe".

The K?valas, or the Isolate or Aloof, are those souls &gt;vho feel like creatures stranded in solitude and who, stung by hunger and grown listless, devour their own flesh for food. They aspire to escape from the fires of samsara (consortship with matter) that consume them, and seek retirement into their own Solitary Selves. These take sedulously to studies of the science of the soul, because they have come to discern that the soul is an entity distinct from the body, and that the latter (the body) is the Seat of Sorrow and the Compound of Corruption, while the former (the soul) is the 25th category, distinct from and above the sum of the 24 material categoriesl that comprise the body,?self luminous, blissful, eternal, and the Spiritual Substance. By reason of the intensity of suffering endured by these souls in the s?ms?rika state, as soon as they find a haven of refuge in the trivial enjoyment of their own soul-isolation, they rest so satisfied, and become on that account oblivious to the infinitely more joyful nature of Bhagav?n (God), failing to know Him as such a Higher Entity. These are the men who embark particularly upon the path of jn?na-y?ga,2 which is chiefly the means to secure this coveted " zoistic " state?a disembodied or bodiless existence, hanging, as it were, in mid-heaven in aeonic suspension,?a state past redemption. A 5. The Mumuksus, or the Would-be Free, are those souls in whom a longing desire for salvation (i.e. reaching Bhagav?n) has arisen. These are of two classes, viz. the Up?salcas, or the S tri vers, and the Propannos, or the Resigned. The former seek salvation by se If-effort, and the latter leave the same to Bhagav?n's (God's) care. The former thinks of salvation as his concern, whereas the latter thinks of it as His concern. 1 See Cosmological Table in our Bhagavad-G?t?, pp. 257-8. 2 See E 2 {infra).</page><page sequence="12">576 THE ARTHA-PANCAKA OF PILLAI LOKACARYA II I.

U 3. Kama, or Joys, are of two kinds : terrestrial or mundane; and celestial or ultra-mundane. The joys of this world are those derived by means of the senses of sound, touch, sight, taste, and smell, from such objects as father, mother, gems, lucre, grain, raiment, food, drink, son, friend, wife, cattle, house, land, perfumes, flowers, and all such luxuries. The joys of the other material worlds are of a nature much exalted above those of this world, and consist in dwelling in such bright regions as svarga,1 in being there bereft of such distempers as hunger, thirst, grief, passion, age, and death, and there enjoying draughts of nectar, and the love of celestial nymphs (apsaras) [but all one day to cease].2 IT 4. ?tm?nubhava, or Soul-bliss, is also m?k$a (release), inasmuch as it is the release from, or cessation of, sorrow, or in other words; deliverance from the bonds of the revolving wheel of births and deaths and the recovery of the natural state of the soul in its freedom, or the soul-life confined to itself without objective contacts, in the condition called kaivalya, or isolation, a purely psychic state, but not divine.

River.4 Here, 1 It must bo noted that this gross body is only the medium or vehicle by means of which pleasures and pains are conveyed to the mind (subtile body), and thence transmitted to the soul, which is the mii?erer. Mind, according to V?danta, is the subtile material. What mind stands for in the English language is consciousness, which is the inseparable attributive adjunct of the soul. The Vedantik mind is said to garner and retain all germs of deeds permitted by the soul to be played on all the material planes, to be available for a new harvest in incarnations to come.

For example, the eye is Adhycltma, any 6ight or shape outside it affecting the eye is Adhibh?ta, and the sun is Adhid?m. Pain may be engendered by any of these three causes?the senses, the object, and the presiding deity. In brief, Adhytitma is the organ of sense, Adhibh?ta is the object of function, and Adhidcvn is the Power or Higher Intelligence which makes these two, and the contacts between them, possible. 4 Virajd is literally the purifying element, by immersion in which all the -rajas (traces of taint), vi-, disappear.

The consciousness streaming out through the senses to worldly objects, when prevented from sensuous experiences, stands in need of engagements other wise, and these are afforded in the soul itself. In other words, consciousness is turned away from the Objective, and turned inwards to dwell on the Subjective?a process entitled inhibition or introspection. This process is divided into the eightfold stages of y ama, niyama, ?sana, pr?n?y?ma., praty?li?ra, dhy?ua, dh?rana, and sam?dhi. This eightfold process is specifically called " yoga ". This yoga 1 part of karma-y?ga may be conceived as the transition between karma-y?ga proper and jn?na-y?ga proper. This karma-y?ga is auxiliary to jn?na-y?ga, and is the chief means of acquiring material prosperity (aisvarya), i.e. artha and k?ma? E 2. Jiidna, or Knowledge, means the Highest Know ledge, or Divine Knowledge. Jn?na-y?ga is its acquisition. The Karma-y?ga aforesaid is productive of knowledge. The object, or objective, of this knowledge (in other words, consciousness functioning in this direction) is Divinity, conceivable in various localized situations, much as the orb of the Sun, the Heart-Lotus, and so forth, and con cretizabl? into Figures of Beauty as that which has an Image in space limits, or the Idea, idolized, bearing the Discus and the Conch, attired in radiant robes, bedight with Crowns and Corselets, Armlets and Anklets, mated with ?ri, and so forth. God is thus conceived as confined in contours of bewitching beauty. This is the special 1 On this eight-limbed yoga, read note 2, p. 106, of our Divine Wisdom of the Dr?vida Saints ; and Part II of our Lectures on Inspiration, etc. 2 See Appendix IV.</page><page sequence="19">THE ARTHA-PANCAKA OF PILLAI LOKACARYA 583 manner in which it is yet allowed man to realize * the Divine Spirit in actual presence and for profit, and this serves the purposes of constraining attention, which is habitually dissipate, and of its being riveted on to the Holy Object of contemplation. Consciousness, so exercised, is itself moulded into that blessed shape, and, thus trained, is relieved of all distraction over various futile objects. This is Divine Meditation, which at the start is of brief duration, but which the postulant is to extend by practice into longer and longer periods, and in the end to render enduring. This Jn?na-y?ga is auxiliary to Blmldi-y?ga, and is the chief means for effecting soul-realization (kaivalya m?ksa). E 3. Bhakti is Love. BhaJdi-y?ga is the practice of Loving Faith. Fixture of Consciousness (Jii?na) on an idolized ideal Object of Beauty is described to be its persistence and insistence thereon, like the streaming filament of a fluid substance, uninterrupted in flow. So far, the experience obtained from such fixture is what pertains to the province of Jn?na-y?ga aforesaid. But when the experience partakes of the nature of love, or becomes a loving experience, it obtains the name of Bhakti. The practice of this loving experience of loving faith is Bhalcli-y?ga. In its onward progress it becomes more and more intense and rapturous. Instead of compelling, as it was, it has become inviting ; instead of repelling, as it was, it has become bewitching. Effort is merged in craving, self-assertion giving place to self-abandon. The heart has become poured into the intellect, or, rather, the intellect has become fused with the heart. The purely mental has become united with the emotional.2 1 See Appendix V. 2 Bhakti exists wherever heart exists.

It is put into three clusters : samcita, pr?rabdlta, and ?g?mi.1 All the yogas have the virtue of sin-killing. Whereas this virtue is partly effected by the Karma-y?ga and the J?ana-y?ga processes aforesaid, the residue of pr?rabdlia which they leave untouched is also entirely eradicated (or effaced from the pages of the soul-life) by BJiakti-y?ga. To the Blvakti-y?gin a vivid knowledge of Means and Ends is vouchsafed. In other words, the true perception of what constitutes the means of salvation, and what constitutes the End or what Salva tion really signifies, is imparted to him. E 4. Prapatti is lovingly surrendering or sacrificing faith, or resigned trust in God. The practising of this is Prapatti-y?ga. In other words, it is the means of unreservedly placing oneself in His hands, and ridding oneself of all notions of securing salvation by self-effort. It is the attitude of mind entirely resigned to His will. This is real renunciation (samny?sa). Blvakti-y?ga, sup ported by Karma-y?ga and Jn?na-y?ga, as described above, becomes a means that tries the utmost strength and capacity of mortals, nor is it compatible with the nature of those souls that have realized their essential nature ? their relationship with God. This Path of pmpatti is accessible to all,2 irrespective of caste, colour, instinctive promptings, waste of breath ; and all further speculation on such lines seems waste of brain. 1 Saihcifa is what is stored like grain ; prdrabdha is so much of it as is taken out of tho store for actual use ; and dgdmi is what is being sown for a future harvest, and when harvested it is added to saificita. 8 Read Bhdgavata Purdna, II, iv, 18?

The mental act, " I trust Thee, Lord," once dedicated, is done once for all, for, as soon as done, it is accepted by Him. Whatever series of acts the Sup pliant (Prapanna) may do thenceforward are no more Means to secure an End, but acquire the character of being Ends in themselves ; inasmuch as all these acts become but acts of service done to Him, and devoid therefore of any ultra-motive. Motivelessness of all act arises from its being done as Divine Service ; and is hence bereft of all binding character, such as entails phenomenal existence again for the soul who does it. The soul, moreover, does the act on the clear understanding of its own intrinsic position or character, as liege of the Lord whom it has to serve. This is the true relation between soul and God, and from it there naturally follows the recognition of the True Means as no other than sur rendering faith, or entire loving trust, or trustful faith, which is resignation. Self-surrender, or Resignation, in other words, is sacrificing oneself, or offering an oblation of oneself, at God's feet. The truest freedom lies in self surrender. The " Self-assert " of Bhakti has given place to the " Self-negate " of Prapatti. The uplift to sublime independence is the fruit of complete subservience to the Supreme Law?God. Prapatti is of two kinds : Drpta, or Patient ; and Arta, or Impatient. [The Prapanna is what we shall call the Suppliant, or Postulant.] The Postulant, Patient (Drpta), is he who is not only weary of, but dreads, migratory, or material, or embodied life, and is averse from all delights, mundane and ultra mundane. To obtain relief from these and access to God, Paths are necessarily subject. Freedom is here granted to all to meditate on the highest problems of life, unhampered by social conventions. A franchise of religion is here granted to all.</page><page sequence="22">586 THE ARTHA-PANCAKA OF PILLAI LOKACARYA he seeks a competent teacher, and under his guidance adopts the Way (Prapatti) of Salvation. He adapts his life to the way of shunning evil, and of walking the paths prescribed by the laws of varna and a?rama, and, to the best of his ability, remains devoted to the service of God and of the Godly?straight in thought, speech, and deed. He constantly reflects on God being his Lord, and on himself being His liegeman ; He as the Ruler, he as the ruled; He as the Master, he as the chattel; He as the Spirit, he as the body ; He as the Pervader, he as the pervaded ; He as the Enjoycr, he as but the enjoyed ; He as the All-knowing, he as the ill-knowing; He as the AU-powTerful, he as the powrerless; He as the Full, he as the void; He as the All-sufficient, and he as the all-wanting. Thus reflecting, the Postulant dedicates all to God, laying on Him all his burden, and spends the lease of his life that may still be left to him in perfect resignation, not allowing its peace to be distraught by considerations of self-care for self-salvation. The Postulant, Impatient (Arta), is he in whom?by the free grace of God?by study and service with a true Teacher, wisdom has dawned, making him loathe all such bodies, places, and leaders as wean him from God, and causing him to long for all such things as wed him to Him. He throws himself entirely on the mercy of God, saying, " Lord, Thou alone canst be my Deliverer from all ills/* "Thou alone, Lord, art my Way," and "Thee alone, O High, I adore ". He grows impatient of salvation, beseeching and besieging God in all manner of ways to lift him once for all to His Holy Feet.1 1 Prajxiffi or Sarandgaii is Bhdgarata-Dharma, par excellence.

Acaryabhinmna is either resort to the Mediator by the aspirant for salvation, or resort to the saved by the Mediator Himself from His own free choice. This fifth Means of Salvation possesses the virtue of being within the nearest reach of mankind, as contra distinguished from all the other Means aforesaid. Those no doubt prescribe God as the object for resort, but He is so beyond the reach of mankind's senses, minds, and hearts, as to forbid His being used in the manner of other objects more accessible. This want is supplied by the Mediator, insomuch as he is tangibly present in the midst of mankind, as one of their own, and therefore so accessible and so within reach, that the work of salvation becomes for souls, so to say, a practical reality. This contrivance in the Scheme of Salvation has been devised by God Himself, in the manner of the mother feeling love for her child, and the Mediator, patent to all mankind, is the result. The Mediator sees his children as weak and helpless, incapable of shifting for .themselves. He stretches his hand down to them, on the one side, to lift them up, and he stretches his hand up, on the other side, to present them to God as fit objects for His mercy and compassion. The function of the Mediator is thus twofold. He is the Mother who is ready to sacrifice her own comfort by voluntarily treating herself to medicine and regimen for the sake of saving the sick child, and he is the Servant who, by such act of self-sacrifice, performs a great deed that pleases his Master, God, who, of course, in the first instance delegated him, or deputed him, for this loving task. He submits to personal suffering in order to redeem the fallen. The Mediator, then, is the Ready Means, under the grace of which souls may take refuge and shape their conduct entirely at his sole bidding. The resort to a Mediator is both an independent Means and an auxiliary Means to the other Means aforesaid, just as God Himself, the Eternal, is both directly the</page><page sequence="24">588 THE ARTHA-PANCAKA OF PILLAI LOKACARYA Goal, and indirectly the Goal as the Spirit indwelling in all the lesser Gods of the Pantheon.1 V 0.

I only quote this : ? "Other 'Gods' are spoken of?millions of them, great and small? but in spite of this a Bh?gavata is no more a polytheist than was the Jew who used the word 'el?hlm both for the Supreme and for His ministers. Just so does the modern Hindu use the word dein both for the Adorable and for His ministering creatures, Brahma, ?iva, and the rest, divine but finite, whom He called into temporary being to fulfil His will. We translate '*l?hlm by 'God* or by ? angel?, according to its sense. If we translate d?ixi uniformly by 'God', no matter what idea it is meant to express in the original, it does not prove that the Bh?gavatas were polyth?iste, but it does prove that we are bad, and?what is worse?unfair translators." 2 The student of the Bhagaixid-GUd may read the whole of chapter xiii ?a sequel, as it were, to chapter ii?discoursing on the knowledge</page><page sequence="25">THE ARTHA-PANCAKA OF PILLAI LOKACARYA 589 say, has vanished, then comes the profession of allegiance (???atva) to deities other than the One God ; but when this error too has disappeared, what may again supervene is the false idea of the Soul's independence, as if it (the Soul-entity) were not dependent for its very be-ness, not to speak of its activities and final doom, on a Kosmic Entity?God (Bhagav?n). 0 2. Paratva-vir?dhi?Anti-God, or what is hostile to God?is the inis-notion that lesser Gods1 possess the character of the Supreme, or the mistaking of non-supreme deities or Gods for the One God ; or believing them to be of equal status with God; the investing of minor deities with power that can only belong to the Supreme ; the mistaking of God-incarnate (Rama, Krsna, etc.) as human; and thinking that the images of God are inert and powerless. 0 3. Purus?rtha-vir?dh% Anti-Goal, or what is hostile to the Ultimate Aim. It is desire for fruits or ends other than that of God Himself (the others being those noted under Purus?rtha-svar?pa) ; and the idea of deriving self-gratification or of gaining satisfaction for one's self in the doing of Divine Service. 0 4. Up?ya-vir?dhi, Anti-Means, or what is hostile to the true Means. It is the notion that other means (those noted under Up?ya-svar?pa) are of equal, if not more, efficacy than the Means (Nos. E 4 and E 5), which requires that those should be discarded, or at least looked down upon as subordinate or unimportant ; the notion of doubt whether this real Means (E 4 and E 5) can be so simple and light as described, and therefore the fear that it cannot be an efficient means to a goal ; the notion discriminatory between body (ks?lra) and soul (ksctrin), particularly the concluding verse 35?

So armed with the knowledge (of the Five Truths), and adorned by the conduct ensuant therefrom, the Pilgrim to the Kingdom of God becometh to Him an object dearer to Him than all the Heavenly Hosts (Eternals and Arch angels) ever near to Him; nay, dearer to Him than even Sri Herself.

Hail, all Hail, to Thee, All-beloved God! Appendix I (p. 573). The term " Bhagav?n " gives a conception of Divinity, as that which is All-Knowing (jn?na), All-Powerful (sakti), All-Strong (bald), All-Lord (o??varya), All-Capable 1 See Appendix VIII.</page><page sequence="28">592 THE ARTHA-PANCAKA OF PILLAI LOKACARYA (vlrya), and All-Bright (t?jas).1 Our ?c?ryas add that these primary perfections of Divinity are the Six typifying an infinite number of them.2 The term "Adorable", chosen by Dr. Grierson,3 accords with the root meaning of " Bhagav?n ". Bliaga, the Vedic God, Bliagavdn, and bhakti, all come from bhaj, to adore, to love, to serve. In this treatise we shall not be far away from the conception of Bhagav?n if we translate it by the term " God " (i.e. "Blessed" or "Perfect"), though our readers should keep in mind the warning of Max M?ller? " We ourselves, the heirs of so many centuries of toil and thought, possess, of course, the name and concept of God, and we can hardly imagine a human mind without that name and concept. But, as a matter of fact, the child's mind is without that name and concept, and such is the difference of meaning assigned by different religions, nay, even by members of the same religion, to the name of God, that a general definition of it has almost become an impossibility. Nevertheless, however our ideas of God may differ, for us to say that the sun or the moon, or a pebble, or the tail of a tiger was God, would be absurd or self-contradictory." (Physical Religion, p. 116.) In the terms " Visnu " ( = All-Present) and " V?sud?va " ( = All-Pervading), the all-pervasive character of Divinity, which is of its essence alone, is radically evident ; and not what is implied in the term " Bhagav?n ". There remains the immanence of Divinity to be provided for. Hence the name " N?r?yana ", which includes all these several con ceptions, making it thus all - comprehensive. It could * The very ancient name for expressing this concept of God, common to the whole Indo-European race is Dcva (Latin Dens, Lithuanian Du'toas), meaning "bright". This is only one attribute of the many that are connoted by the term lihagav?n. It may also be noted that Bhagav?n is the epithet of the Deity to which Saivas, as well as Vaisnavas and every other denomination, including Buddhists and Jainas, subscribe. See Visnu-Purdna, VI, v, 71-9, and our Bhagavad-Gll?, pp. 5, 6, and 10. 2 See p. 82 of our Vade-mccutn of V?d?iUa. 9 See JRAS. for 1910, p. 159 ff.</page><page sequence="29">THE ARTHA-PANCAKA OF PILLAI LOKACARYA 5?M be shown that this name includes all the ideas of God connoted by such terms as " Absolute " (Sat), " Infinite " (Vi$nu), "Transcendent" (Para), and "Divine" (Bhagav?n). This Holy Name has thus become to all Vedic people the highest conception of Divinity, and is the Name which they look upon as their solace in life, comfort in death, and salvation after death. When, therefore, we employ the word " God " we must be understood to represent by it all that has been briefly indicated above.1 Appendix II (p. 574). The Vanyxs, or grades, in formulated, or stratified, Hindu Society are four : Brahma, Ksatriya, Vaisya, and S?dra; and the A?ramas, or stages of life, are Brahma cdrya, Gdrhasthya, Vdnaprastha, and Samnydsa. Both these divisions may be understood for our present purposes as intended by the foreign term " caste " or " the caste system". The Varna (lit. colour, but also used in an occult sense) is peculiar to the Hindus, but the ??ramas do more or less, in other forms, exist in other countries also beyond the confines of India. Appendix III (p. 578). Svarga is but one of the many material Paradises, or material Heavens.

Also read Bhg. G., viii, 16, 28 ; and ix, 20, 21, 24, and 25. Appendix IV (p. 582). To the Hindus all karma is sacrifice. Karma is " act ", and all sacrifices are, of course, acts. Every act is natural, and this in time assumes the technical meaning of a most sacred and solemn act. The agnih?tra is, in the beginning, the natural act of lighting and keeping the fire on the hearth at sunrise, noon, and sunset ; and in time this became a sacred function even to be enforced by law. The rising and setting of the Sun naturally evoked gratitude and then praise, for the sun was the giver of light, heat, life, and joy. This in turn culminated in the sacred duty of the Samdhy?-vandana. The c?turm?sya, or the Four-monthly Sacrifice, is a simple natural festive celebration of the threo seasons of the year (summer, autumn, winter). This after a time became an artificial and complicated ritual, with more and more technique associated with it as time ran on. Thus sacerdotal practices prevailing among all nations owe their origin to the most natural and simple habits of human nature prompted by natural phenomena sur rounding it. See S?ndily? yp&gt;anisad for an explanation of some cf these terms. Appendix V (p. 583). God in Images is described thus :? " Srisasya sarv?dhisth?nam d?ru-vahni-vad iritam | Visn?r vis?s?dhisth?nam ayah-pind?-'gni-van matamH"1 1 Quoted in Sr?misnava-Saniay?cdra-Niskarsa by Pillai Lokam Jlyar.</page><page sequence="31">THE ARTHA-PANCAKA OF PILLAI LOKACARYA 595 It is like electricity, which pervades the conducting wire, but which is nevertheless latent, and lacking in utility, till it becomes patently present, by its power of illuminating darkness, at the poles in a vacuum bulb. According to the Bhagavat-S?stra entitled the Pa?cardtra ? gamas, the types for making material representations on canvas or in sculpture are furnished by the Vy?ha and Vibluiva mani festations of the Deity. Cf. Bhg. G., xi, 46 ff, t?naiva rup?na caturbhuj?na, etc. For the man-forms of God on earth, it is written that even the D?vas desire to worship them : " D?v? apy asya r?pasya nityaih dar?ana-ka?ksi nalji " (Bhg. G., xi, 52) ; " avat?r?su y ad r?paih tad arcanti divaukasah " (Vi?nu-P., I, iv, 17). Appendix VI (p. 589). See Appendix I. The term " Gods " requires expla nation. The best that we can give cannot excel that of Ruskin? "By gods in the plural," he writes, " I mean the totality of spiritual powers, delegated by the Lord of the Universe to do, in their several heights, or oflices, parts of His will respecting man, or the world that man is imprisoned in ; not as myself knowing, or in security believing, that there are such, but in meekness accepting the testimony and belief of all ages, to the presence, and the like?with genii, fairies, or spirits ministering and guarding, or destroying and tempting, or aiding good work and inspiring the mightiest. For all these I take the general term ' gods ' as the best understood in all languages, and the truest and widest in meaning, including the minor ones of seraph, cherub, ghost, wraith, and the like, and myself knowing for indisputable fact, that no true happiness exists nor is any good work ever done by human creatures, but in the sense or imagination of such presences." (Prctterita, ii, 172.) Read Bhg. G., ix, 24, 25. Appendix VII (p. 590). See Appendix II on Varna and ?srama (caste-system). Vaisnavism is here added to denote all those who could embrace that faith, irrespective of those who could remain within the pale defined by the caste-system. Vaisnavism is simply the faith which acknowledges the All-Pervader (Visnu) as God. To all theists, God, we guess, has by</page><page sequence="32">596 THE ARTHA-PANCAKA OF PILLAI LOKACARYA this time become an all-pervading spiritual Essence, involving what is connoted by the term "immanency". To Vaisnavism, therefore, every theist can belong, regard less of caste, creed, or race. In this simple sense it is universal and cosmopolitan. In time, as in everything else, the term became confined to a sect, invested once again with technicalities. Sacraments seem gradually to have become its annexe, the administration of which alone entitled one to be admitted as a votary into the fold of Vaisnavism. Regarded in this sense, rules have been laid down as to the right ways a Vaisnava should proceed, what he should adopt and what he should avoid, and so forth, in order to gain his livelihood. The code is, however, morally worthy of its name and helpful to spirituality, though restraints are placed upon the free exercise of one's power of earning. Where, without varna, ?srama, and Vaisnavism, earning was before indiscriminate, it is now, with these limitations, restricted to a narrow and elect circle, cut out from the larger society. In cases of mendicancy, these rules also make the mendicant less of a prey on society, and urge him to adopt a less parasitic mode of life, than if he were left to roam at large without them. Appendix VIII (p. 591). The designation " Sri-Vaisnava " comes from Sri and Visnu, which two terms, divested of all anthropomorphism and allegory, mean, considered in their etymons, the Mother and the Father of the Universe, ?ri is charis, grace, the universal mediatrix, the reconciler, or peace maker, between God and Soul. Sri-Vaisnavas are thus radically those who are believers in the Father-and Mother principle of the Kosmos. Whether we study Nature without or from within, or the great Supreme lying behind both, it is governed by the two principles of Justice and Mercy, which in metaphor become Father</page><page sequence="33">THE ARTHA-PANCAKA OF PILLAI LOKACARYA 597 and Mother, and in symbol Visnu and Sri. In this universal sense, who is not a Sri-Vaisnava ? Much has been written on this theme, for a few examples of which see note 1, p. 6 of our Bhagavad - G?ta, and Topics 17, pp. 19, 20 in our Divine Wisdom of the Dr?vida Saints; the articles on Sri and Christ in the Theosophist, vol. xxvi (January and February, 1905); and ?ri P?thastirathi Yogi's Sri-vacana-bh?^ana, pp. 5, 6, etc. Also see note on p. Ill of our Lives of the Azhv?rs ("Are there wives in Heaven ?" etc.). In the Sri-Vaisnava system thus, like the three postulates of philosophy? acit (matter), cit (soul), and Isa (God)?are these three postulates of religion vividly set forth, viz. :? The Motherhood of God (Sri or Bhagavati) ; The Fatherhood of God (Visnu or Bhagav?n) ; The Brotherhood of Souls (?r?-Vaisnavas or Bh?gavatas). If this scientifically significant language has in modern days been debased into shibboleths of party politics, who is to blame ? But it is so all the world over. There are various theories, both modern and ancient, as to what the Sri-tattva exactly signifies. There are not wanting those who equate or identify it with inert or inanimate (jada) Prakrti, or Nature. But they forget that the Sri-tattva is sentient or intelligent (ajado,). She is the Goddess of Nature, not Nature itself, as God is the God of Nature and not Nature itself, as some others identify Him. That Sri is a conscious entity is borne ou,t by all the oastras from the llg Veda (Sri-sulda) downwards. Here is one verse from Skfinda :? " Aparaih tv aksaram y? s? prakrtir ja?la-rupik? | Sril.i par?-prakrtih pr?kt? c?tan? Visnu-samsray? || " Sri is the Daivi-Prakrti of the Bhagavad-Glt?, and Sr?h of x, 34, of the same authority.
