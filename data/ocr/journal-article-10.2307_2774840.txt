<plain_text><page sequence="1">Population and Society: Introduction to Social Morphology. By MAURICE HALBWACHS. Translated by 0. DUDLEY DUNCAN and HAROLD W. PFAUTZ. Glencoe, Ill.: Free Press, 1960. Pp. 207. This is a translation of a book published in French in 1938, under the title (more fitting than that selected) of "Morphologie Sociale." To supplement the author's original text, the translators have provided a preface, two technical notes, and a brief list of references in English. The book proper is less than sixty thousand words in length. Its contents are divided into two parts, the first dealing with the mor- phology of groups and activities internal to a society and the second treating the mor- phology of total populations. In the former the author does little more than exemplify an approach toward research into religious, political, and economic structures. His general proposition is that these institutional com- plexes have demographic foundations and characteristics and that inquiries into them can profit from the truism that the function- ing of such institutions is necessarily assured by the existence of groups of men in motion on the earth. Halbwachs asserts that this "nature of things" is most evident and in- fluential in the economic area, less so in the political area, and least persuasive in the re- ligious area, where beliefs are less responsive to the sanctions of physical experience. The second part of the book, making up the bulk of the monograph, is an elementary, incomplete, and outdated presentation of the contents of a standard undergraduate course in population problems. The style is fre- quently rhetorical, and the allocation of space to particular topics is old-fashioned. Errors in fact and logic are frequent enough to be annoying. If there is a justification for this publica-</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 319 tion today, it lies in the presentation of a research viewpoint which deserves more than the handful of followers it now has. Halb- wachs presents population as the most general framework within which all social facts must be placed. Population as a mass has the two essential properties of being juxtaposed in space and persistent through time (in con- trast to its transitory components). Demo- graphic change is a necessary but insufficient determinant of social behavior, restraining some types of development and inducing (but not compelling) others. Although social un- derstanding cannot be reduced to a set of determinisms, it is equally true that no social structure or function is disembodied. The great merit of the viewpoint, then, is the persistent emphasis on the interdependencies of the normative and the physical morphology. Maurice Halbwachs (1877-1945) was the greatest sociologist of his generation in France. He was one of the very few who have tried to bring together sociology and demography, in the tradition of his predeces- sor and mentor, Emile Durkheim, for whom social morphology represented the most im- mediately accessible type of phenomenon for sociological research, preliminary to and un- derlying the investigation of the normative structure environing the individual. Regret- tably, the links that Halbwachs attempted to forge between the demographic and the normative aspects of society turned out to be mostly metaphors in collective psychology or anthropomorphic allusions to the instincts of the population, which might be testable by faith but certainly not by research. The translators' Preface is a mild polemic on behalf of the directions in which Halb- wachs might have developed his work. Some- times Halbwachs disappears from sight some- where between the much more substantial figure of Durkheim and the much more im- mediate present of modern human ecology. In particular there is a disjunctve shift into an examination of the work of Charles Booth in relation to contemporary urban studies, which might deserve publication in a less inappropriate context. In the reviewer's judgment the translation of this book represented a misallocation of scarce resources. The book is clearly not a classic; indeed, its contents are here and there embarrassing, as happens with most merely good works in the course of time. The cogency of the message for current re- search strategies will prove compelling only to those who are already convinced. A modern treatise on social morphology is a worthy task. Perhaps the translators will write their own book next time. NORMAN B. RYDER University of Wisconsin</page></plain_text>
