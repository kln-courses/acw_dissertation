<plain_text><page sequence="1">6 Unpublished building remains from Evans's trial pits of 1900-02 at Knossos Vasso Fotou Evans's excavations brought to light parts of all the set- tlements which had occupied Kephala and the sur- rounding area.1 The Neolithic, Prepalatial, Protopalatial and Final Palatial towns of Knossos are represented only by a few buildings each. The bulk of the extensive re- mains unearthed by Evans belong to Neopalatial Knossos and include, apart from the Palace, two large complexes and at least 30 buildings. The preliminary reports and The Palace of Minos, in conjunction with the excavation records, give well documented accounts for the majority of these remains. Most importantly, these accounts can be supplemented by observations on site since most of these buildings are still visible. A few building remains, however, received little mention, or none at all, in the reports and, as they have been backfilled, there is no chance of study in situ. Unless they are re-excavated, our only source of information on these remains is the excavation records in the Evans Archive in the Ashmolean Museum. With the notable exception of the Arsenal (a full study of which will be published elsewhere), these remains are only parts of buildings that came to light in pits dug at the start of the first three campaigns so as to test various areas on the Kephala before dumping earth from the excavations {DM/ DB 1 900.1, 23 March, 1, 11. 20- 6; DM/ DB 1900 rev., 23 March, 3, 11. 5-6). These re- mains were summarily excavated, unless they showed important architectural features (such as ashlar ma- sonry, mason's marks etc.) or were associated with finds such as frescoes, in which case some excavation carried on beyond the limits of the pits, but stopped short of full exposure of the structures (e.g. Appendix: Entry 8). All these remains were backfilled and have not been re-explored. Exceptionally, a few remains from these backfilled trial pits were later dug extensively, at the cost of removing the dump. One example is the North- East House (DM /DB 1901.1, 23 April, 86; and below on the 1902 trial pits. For the North-East House, see Hood and Smyth 1981. 220). In general, the records are scanty and probably in- complete. There are, for instance, buildings (such as the House of the Chancel Screen [Hood and Taylor 1 98 1 . 284]) that were explored in subsequent campaigns, parts of which are said to have been uncovered in these early trial pits, but no mention of them can been found in the relevant records. I must point out also that subsequent trial pits ap- pear to have contained architectural remains that were not published. These pits differ from the early ones in their purpose, which was not any more to find free space to dump earth from the excavation, but either to estab- lish stratigraphy or to explore the surrounding area of a given building or road. They can be traced in the Day- books (e.g. DM/ DB 1905, 10 April, 27, 1923.3, opp. 1, for tests on the S side of Royal Road and SE of the Ar- senal), and in the publications (e.g. Evans 1928, 546, plan, 552, for tests [?] N and S of the Royal Villa); oth- ers were revealed during recent excavations (such as the 1987 excavation in the Throne Room area for tests in Rooms 44 and 48). No specific information, how- ever, on the architectural remains in these pits could be found in the excavation archive. 1 The paper read at the Conference was entitled 'Unpublished building remains from Evans's excavations at Knossos' and, as well as the remains found in the trial pits of the first three campaigns, discussed the remains excavated N of the Royal Road in the area of the so-called Arsenal. However, the full study of all these building remains far exceeds the space avail- able in this volume. Accordingly I present here only the re- mains from the trial pits. The Arsenal and earlier remains be- neath it will be published later. I thank Sinclair Hood and Gerald Cadogan for their com- ments and observations. Gerald Cadogan also undertook the task of checking the English of the final draft. My thanks also go to Helen Hughes-Brock, Richard Firth, Ariane Marcar and Ingo Pini for information they readily provided, and to my husband, David Sherman, for his help with the English and many practical matters. This work is entirely based on the ar- chive of the excavations at Knossos, which is part of the Evans Archive in the Ashmolean Museum. I thank P. R. S. Moorey, Keeper of the Department of Antiquities, for allowing me unlimited access to the Archive. I am also grateful to Alexandra Karetsou, Director of the Herakleion Museum, for allowing me in November 2000, to search for material from the trial pits, and Marina Panagiotaki for helping me. A similar search was carried out at the same time at the Stratigraphical Mu- seum with the help of the Curator, Eleni Hatzaki, whom I thank.</page><page sequence="2">84 VASSO FOTOU BUILDING REMAINS FROM THE 1900 TRIAL PITS The 1900 trial pits were spread all over the E part of the S slope, the SE slope and the S part of the E slope. On the S slope, a field of corn marked the W limit of the area tested (FIG. 6.2 a-b), a line running roughly between the South Porch (Hood and Taylor 1981. 9) and the House of the Sacrificed Oxen (Hood and Taylor 1 98 1 . 286). On the E slope, the N limit of the area tested was the boundary of Evans's property which ran along the middle of the E slope (FIG. 6.4), more or less on the line of the East-West Corridor (Hood and Taylor 1981 . 222-3). The bank of the Vlykhia to the S, a modern terrace to the SE and a path to the E marked the limits of the tested area on these sides (FIGS. 6.1-6.2 a-b). The modern terrace bordered (to the NW) the bottom of the SE slope which was occupied by a garden ending northwards in a small olive grove (FIG. 6.2 a-b): this area was not tested, and probably lay outside Evans's property.2 No architectural remains were found in the pits on the E part of the S slope, but pottery is mentioned from these pits.3 On the other two slopes, the SE and E, ar- chitectural remains were plentiful. On the upper part of these slopes, the pits struck parts of the East Wing of the Palace, the East House (Hood and Taylor 1981. 280: "Houses on east slope E. of Monolithic Pillar Base- ment"), the House of the Chancel Screen, the Ka- pheneion (Hood and Taylor 1981 . 270), and the South- East Kamares area (Hood and Taylor 1981 . 278-9) (FIG. 6.4), all of which were excavated in the following sea- sons. The architectural remains uncovered on the mid- dle and lower parts of these slopes were subsequently covered by earth from the main excavation.4 Specific information on remains belonging to nine buildings or constructions can be gleaned from Mackenzie's jour- nal and Evans's notes. More buildings were probably found than have been recorded. One building seems to be Venetian; the rest seem Minoan and, most likely, of Neopalatial date although in only one case (the Build- ing in the Middle of the SE Slope) do we have indica- tions from the pottery associated with the remains. The first four of these constructions were on the middle and lower parts of the SE slope, and should cor- respond to those labelled "Minoan Houses" on Evans's final general plan of Kephala (FIG. 6.3). The most sig- nificant and comprehensive of these remains belong to a building referred to below as the Building in the Mid- dle of the SE Slope; the others, as listed below, include a long wall, a limestone block with a mason's mark, and a space with plaster floor. Apart from the architectural remains and the finds associated with them, the main information from the pits on the middle and lower parts of the SE slope is on the presence or absence of pottery. The only references to specific finds are a rock crystal bead in one pit (Appendix: Entries 2b, 7a-7b), and in another (just S-SE of the Building in the Middle of the SE Slope) fragments of rectangular and oval larnakes (Appendix: Entry 1). N from this area, on the E slope, the pits encoun- tered a series of tombs of later date (FIG. 6.4),5 which may have been connected with some poor house remains probably dating to Venetian times (Appendix: Entries 8~9a). N of these tombs, excavation concentrated on a drain described below. W of this drain and in the area NNE and E of the East House (FIG. 6.4), parts of build- ings were frequent in the trial pits (Appendix: Entry 9a), but only three of them are recorded in some detail - the corner of a building (referred to below as the Building NE of the East House); the S part of an elon- gated space; and a curved wall. Apart from these re- mains, special mention is made of finding a Neolithic figurine associated with incised Neolithic pottery from a pit just E of the N wall of the NE space of the East House. Neolithic levels were found in several pits in the middle part of the E slope, E of the region of the East House and the South-East Kamares Area, and down to the tomb area. But no constructions are re- corded, only pottery.6 2 See Panagiotaki in this volume.

The occurrence of snails with bones in disorder recorded by Evans (Appendix: Entry 4a) is noteworthy. In the LM IB destruction deposit in the Cult Room Basement of the North House at the Stratigraphical Museum site snails were found intermingled with children's bones, a jug and sherds of a large pithos. But no burial is sug- gested there: according to the excavators the snails and bones, which very probably were originally inside the pithos, either were for cooking or represent the remains of a meal (Wall et al. 1986, 345, 386, 388). 6 DM/ DB 1900.1, 26 March, 5, 11. 19-27, 6, 11. 22-4, 33-6 and opp. p.

General plan of the Palace at Knossos and surrounding area with indication of the architectural remains found in the içoo-02 trial pits (after Hood and Smyth iq8i, with additions from Warren 1994, and Evans's and Mackenzie's sketches and notes: Fotou). The Building in the Middle of the SE Slope (Appendix: Entries i-2b, 6a-8; the building also mentioned in Evans 1900, 5) These were the first building remains that Evans unearthed at Knossos, in the middle of the SE slope, S of the House of the Chancel Screen (FIG. 6.1. 1). Their location can be ap- proximately established from Evans's sketch (FIG. 6.2 b). The building probably dates to early Neopalatial. From Evans's and Mackenzie's descriptions of some of the pottery found at floor level it appears that the latest pieces are MM IIIB and were found with "Kamares" ware. No stratigraphical data can be found in Evans's and Mac- kenzie's accounts. The walls (FIG. 6.5 a) started at about 0.3- 0.4 m from the surface, and the floor was at 1.4-1.5 m from the surface. This gives a height of 1-1.2 m for the walls, sug- gesting thick deposits and well preserved remains. But the excavation stopped before the building was completely cleared (Appendix: Entry 8). This was a typical example of the gen- eral policy of the excavation during the first campaigns, which concentrated on the Palace. Any building remains unearthed prior to 1902 that proved to have no connection with the Pal- ace received little attention at the time. Examples are the House of the Chancel Screen, the North-East House and the South- West House (Hood and Taylor 1981. 14-15).7 The remains of the Building in the Middle of the SE Slope recorded on Mackenzie's sketches present a plan far too in- complete to allow us any discussion of its architecture and internal organisation (FIG. 6.5 a). Further remains of the building may have been found in nearby pits, but nothing is sketched or described. From the available information, how- ever, we know that this was a freestanding building laid out on a terrace created for it, and the main retaining walls against the cutting were of boulders. Another wall had one face built of gypsum ashlar blocks, the other, which was partly against the cutting, being probably of rubble. The construction and layout indicate that it was a building of polite architecture8 similar to the neighbouring South-East House (Hood and Taylor 1981. 283) and the House of the Chancel Screen and, therefore, that buildings of such quality continued down the SE slope. This conclusion finds further confirmation in the fragments of frescoes from the building, the first to be found 7 See also on the Buildine(s) NNE of the North-East House. 8 For the term see McEnroe 1990, 195 and especially n. 2.</page><page sequence="4">86 VASSO FOTOU 1 1 1 1 ^ ^ ã ^ lililí ÌI |í|ílís ^ 8^ § "&gt; &lt;tt 15 35 na itili</page><page sequence="5">UNPUBLISHED BUILDING REMAINS FROM EVANS'S TRIAL PITS OF 1900-02 87 ^ ^ § Ä "^^ ** ^ S ^ I</page><page sequence="6">88 VASSO FOTOU by Evans at Knossos and which, in his words, "gave the prom- ise of better things above" (Evans 1900, 5). The pottery, frescoes and one seal from the Building in the Middle of the SE Slope are all, to my knowledge, unpub- lished. The pottery dates to Protopalatial and early Neopalatial. Evans's and Mackenzie's descriptions are the only available information on this pottery.9 They refer par- ticularly to fragments of two vases at floor level: the neck and spout of a "Kamares" jug, and a MM III fragment with spi- rals and other decoration in white paint. Fragments of a large piriform "Kamares" pot and of an incense vase (of the type known as "fire-boxes") comparable to those from Phylakopi and probably dating to the Neopalatial period,10 are men- tioned by Evans, but their position in the deposit is not known. Evans also refers to quantities of cups (with and without han- dles), which seem to have occurred in the area of this build- ing, but it is not clear that they came from it.11 The fresco fragments were found at floor level in the area indicated on the plan (FIG. 6.5 a). Their number is not re- corded, but two are mentioned by Mackenzie and five are sketched by Evans. Among the latter the most significant is one with a relief motif and another with rosettes of black dots on a blue background.12 I have not been able to find the fragment(s) with the dotted rosettes or any of the other frag- ments either in the HM or the SMK,13 and none of these fragments seems to have been recorded by Cameron (1974). Cameron does list a number of fragments with dotted ro- settes, but none of them is in black. Most are red on a white background and dated to LM II-IIIAi (Cameron 1974, pis- 131. D, G-I, K, 167. B.7, and (?) 170. A a ); there is one example of white rosettes with red centres on sky blue, and two of yellow rosettes, all dated to MM IIIB-LM IA (Cameron 1974, pls. 42. E, 165. A.8, 169. C.2; also Evans l9Z°, 33O-!&gt; fig- 220). In the HM I found a small fresco frag- ment with one black dotted rosette framed on two sides by horizontal and vertical black lines, in sky blue background. This fragment is the closest parallel to our untraced fragment(s) of black rosettes and is comparable to the MM IIIB-LM IA fragments catalogued by Cameron. The seal was found at 0.3-0.4 m from surface, at the level of the top of the walls of the building. Together with Mac- kenzie's statement that it was in the surface soil, this makes it likely that it was not connected with the building.14 The seal was lentoid, of steatite with both sides engraved, one with a lion couchant and a star, the other with a star. It has not been identified and is presumed lost.15 From Evans's sketch, the lion appears similar to the lion on a Neopalatial lentoid seal from the House of the Frescoes, in which, however, the lion is not combined with a star (CMS 2. 3. 19). A parallel for a lion with star is found on a damaged steatite lentoid without provenance dated to the Postpalatial period (CMS 2. 4. 76). 16 This parallel tallies with Mackenzie's comment on the "or- dinary" workmanship of this (missing) seal. A late date does not affect the dating of the building, since the seal was prob- ably not connected with it. Other remains on the lower SE slope Long wall (Appendix: Entries 4b, 7a-8) This wall occurred at 0.6-0.7 m fr°m the surface. It is prob- ably the wall noted by Evans in his sketch of 27 March, as "long wall below" (FIG. 6.4; see also Appendix: Entry 4b). This sketch and Mackenzie's notes on its location place it somewhere on the lower part of the SE slope, to the SE of the Building in the Middle of the SE Slope, and near the modern terrace (FIGS. 6.1. 2, 6.2 a-b). The wall was traced further than the length at which cross-walls could be expected, sug- gesting to Mackenzie that it was probably a terrace wall. The wall is not dated, and all evidence for dating it (such as de- scription of the materials and type of construction, or pot- tery associated with it) is lacking. Limestone block with a mason's mark (Appendix: Entries 7a- 7b, 1, 2b) An ashlar limestone block was found at the bottom of a pit, but the exact depth is not noted. Its location can be approxi- mately established as on the lower part of the SE slope, near the modern terrace at the point corresponding to the S bor- der of the small olive grove (FIGS. 6.1. 3, 6.2 a-b). It is not mentioned if it was built into a wall or other construction, or if it was an isolated stone (perhaps fallen to where it was found from a wall above). An eight-ray star sign was cut in the mid- dle of the dressed face of the block, but whether it was finely or deeply cut is not noted. No date is suggested. The fact that the block was found at the bottom of the pit is not neces- sarily an indication for an early (Protopalatial) date. Other indications for dating this block are lacking. Part of a space with plaster floor (Appendix: Entries 7a-8) The information on the location of this space places it some- where on the lower part of the SE slope, near the modern 9 No pottery from this building or from any of the 1900 trial pits seems to be recorded in Pendlebury 1933. 1 have made no attempt to identify in the various museums the pieces described by Evans and Mackenzie, which would have involved a long search. 10 Appendix: Entry 2a. Cf. Bosanquet and Welch 1904, 21 1-12; also Georgiou 1973, especially nos. 1, 4, 5. 1 1 Appendix: Entry 1 . The note on these cups is not fully intelli- gible, one word being illegible. 12 Appendix: Entry 2b. In later notes Evans wrongly associated these fresco fragments with the area of the drain in Spaces 92- 3 of the Palace (see comments on Entry 4b). 13 In the HM I checked the fresco trays from Knossos labelled "Unprovenanced - Palace" housed in the W apotheke. Of 93 trays, 78 were checked (125-57, 160-9, an^ aU unnumbered trays stacked beneath "Amnisos" [203], "House of Frescoes" [179, 193] and "Unprovenanced - Palace" [135, 147, 157, 169). The rest (112-24 anc* 158-9) were inaccessible. At the SMK I checked all the trays with painted plaster fragments from unidentified locations. Finally, none of the fragments seems to exist in the AM. 14 In later notes (Appendix: Entry 4a) Evans seems to associate this seal with the East House, mistakenly. See comments on Entry 4a. 1 5 Popham and Gill were aware of Evans's sketch of the seal, but could not find the object (Popham and Gill 1995, 60, pl. 48 a. 1). The seal is not in the AM (H. Hughes-Brock, personal communication) nor among the HM seals that are still un- published (I. Pini, personal communication). 16 I thank H. Hughes-Brock for bringing this seal to my atten- tion.</page><page sequence="7">UNPUBLISHED BUILDING REMAINS FROM EVANS'S TRIAL PITS OF 1900-02 89 Fig. 6.5.

The space had a wall running N-S and a plaster floor next to it to the E. No other walls were found, although it appears that the excavation extended beyond the limits of the original pit. This could suggest a large, perhaps open, space. No date is suggested, nor are there any clues such as the type of wall construction. The great depth of 2.3 m from the surface in which the floor was found does not necessarily mean that the space belonged to an early period. Remains on the E slope Drain (Appendix: Entries 3-5, ça-io; also mentioned in Evans 1900, 6, 1921,429, n. 1) The remains of a drain lay at the bottom of the slope, near the path ENE of the East House, its location being approxi- mately established from Evans's sketches (FIGS. 6.4, 6.1. 5). The drain had two parallel walls with cover slabs at four dif- ferent levels, and was connected with two cavities formed naturally in the conglomerate rock. Neither the description nor Evans's sketches gives a clear picture of this unusual con- struction. The height and the width of the channel, materi- als and construction of the floor and the sides, length of the part of the drain that was uncovered, and its date, elude us. The depth of the second cover slab is noted as 1.7 m from the surface. Building NE of the East House (Appendix: Entries 9a~9b, 4a) The remains of this building lay on the lower part of the E slope above the path, adjacent to the boundary line marking Evans's property in 1900, which ran approximately down the middle of the E slope - a sketch by Evans locates it approxi- mately NE of the East House (FIGS. 6.4, 6.1. 6). Two walls were uncovered, one of limestone (probably ashlar) blocks, the other of boulders (FIG. 6.5 b). They form the SE corner of a building that continued to the N beyond the boundary of Evans's property - which may have prevented further exca- vation. The walls began at 0.5-0.6 m from the surface; there is no mention of their state of preservation or of the depth of the deposit, nor is it noted if they were associated with a floor. No date is suggested. The construction of the walls could indicate that they belonged to an important building. Part of an elongated space (Appendix: Entry 9a, and possibly Entry 4a) The location of these remains sketched and briefly described by Mackenzie can only be roughly established as being E of the East House. They may correspond to the walls forming a SE angle, between the corner of the Building NE of the East House and the East House, as shown on Evans's sketch (FIGS. 6.4, 6.1. 7), although there also should have been a SW cor- ner. The remains form the S part of an unusually long space, 3 m wide and at least 12.65 m l°ng (FIG- 6.5 c). No further information on this excavation exists; the depth of deposit, state of preservation, materials and construction of the walls, presence of floors, and the date of these remains all elude us. Curved wall (Appendix: Entries 4a, 9a-9b) The location of this wall can be approximately established from Evans's sketch as being at 10 m N of the East House (FIGS. 6.4, 6.1. 8). A circular hollow was identified above it but was not excavated. The wall is not described, but its curved plan suggested to Mackenzie that it may have been part of a bastion. No similar construction exists on the Kephala. Its date is crucial in establishing its importance, but no evidence exists on this matter. Evans ascribed it to recent times with, however, some degree of uncertainty (FIG. 6.4). BUILDING REMAINS FROM THE 1901 TRIAL PITS The 1 90 1 campaign started with trial pits W of the Pal- ace and on the S slope aiming at finding areas to dump the earth from the main excavation on the Palace site. Midway through the season, a series of trial pits was opened for the same reason on the NE slope, but the only remains to have been recorded from these pits be- long to the North-East House excavated in subsequent years.17 On the S slope 25 pits were opened W of the area tested in 1900 and already in use for dumping earth. One pit had a wall (FIG. 6.1. 9), probably dating to the Neopalatial period; the others (like the 1900 pits fur- ther E on the same slope) lacked architectural remains (see Appendix: Entries 11-19, especially 13-15). How- ever, Mackenzie's comment on this wall that it was the only construction "worth mentioning" (Appendix: Entry 16) suggests the presence of some building re- mains in the other pits. Apart from this wall and the material associated with it, the sole information from these pits is about finding a tablet fragment in a pit at the SW part of the tested area at 1.8 m from the surface (Appendix: Entry 15),18 and the presence or absence of pottery. The discovery of a tablet at such a depth, in a deposit which does not appear to have contained other finds or architectural 17 See below for the 1902 trial pits, with references. 18 Linking this tablet with a published one is problematic. Al- though there is no description of the fragment, it is more likely to be from a Linear B than from a Linear A tablet. Of five Linear A tablet fragments known from Evans's excavations at Knossos, three come from the Palace. The other two (KN 22, KN 32) are possible candidates only because their find-spot or year of discovery are not certain (Godart and Olivier 1976, xxviii, 260-1, 264-5). None of the find-spots of Linear B tab- lets in AE/HL seems to fit the description of the pit so as to confirm the identification of this tablet with an existing one. However, the definition of the find-spots of a number of Lin- ear B tablets is far from certain. One such case is ON (= origi- nal number) 1088, which was found in 1901 and, in the bibli- ography, is allocated either to the area beyond the W Wall or to the SW Corner of the Palace (Palmer 1963, 54; Olivier 1967, 22; Firth 1997, 16-18; and cf. Killen 1997, 127-32). I propose that this could have been the fragment found in the pit. To my knowledge, this possibility has not been suggested in any of the works cited, perhaps because the authors seem to be una- ware of Mackenzie's reference to a tablet from a pit SW of the Palace. Firth (2001, 123) quotes Mackenzie's text, but does not identify this fragment with an existing one.</page><page sequence="9">UNPUBLISHED BUILDING REMAINS FROM EVANS'S TRIAL PITS OF 1900-02 91 remains, is perplexing: one explanation could be that this deposit had been dumped there in a previous exca- vation (by M. Kalokairinos ?). The pottery found was predominantly LM, with some Neolithic in the lower depths. A large deposit of Neolithic ashes and bones was identified in the NE part of the area tested (Appen- dix: Entry 15). W of the Palace the trial pits extended over an area bounded to the N by a path which ran about 30-50 m S of the Royal Road (Hood and Taylor 1981. 166; Hood and Smyth 1981. 211) and marked the boundary of Evans's property in 1901 (FIG. 6.2 #), and to the W by the main road. The southern limit was in line with Magazine IX (Hood and Taylor 1981. 53, no). The eastern limit is vaguely indicated as being "opposite the N. magazines as yet un-excavated [i.e. Magazines IX- XVIII: Hood and Taylor 1981. 53, 110-11, 113-15, 117- 19, 121-2]" (Appendix: Entry 11); it is not specified how far W from these magazines, but it could not be any further than is indicated on our plan (FIG. 6.1. 10), particularly since a wall in one of the easternmost pits was thought to belong to the Palace structures (Appen- dix: Entry 13). The total number of pits is not men- tioned, but it would seem that their density varied, in the W part of the area the pits being set further apart from each other than those nearer to the Palace. The main feature of these pits was a drainage sys- tem, probably of LM date, described below, but which cannot be located on the site plan. More building re- mains were found than are recorded and described be- low. Their precise location cannot be determined. They occurred mostly E of the drainage system, and were scarce W of it. Those E of the drain were probably Neopalatial, those W perhaps earlier. In only three cases (one E of the drainage system, the other two at the SW edge of the area tested) were these remains considered significant enough to be ex- plored further. It appears then that part of the area tested was characterised by poor structures, while the rest, an area extending 10-20 m S from the path mark- ing the N boundary of the area tested, was found to be free of buildings (Appendix: Entries 13, 15, 17, 19). Apart from the architectural remains and finds asso- ciated with them, the only other information in con- nection with the pits W of the Palace reveals the discov- ery in a pit E of the drainage system and next to the path of a Late Minoan stand (Appendix: Entry 11)19 and other pottery. References to pottery emphasise its abundance, especially E of the drainage system, with LM sherds predominating (and occurring also with MM sherds); the presence of later (Roman) pottery is mentioned, and in one pit, in the W part of the area tested, Neolithic pottery was found at 8 m from the surface.20 Only Mackenzie recorded the 1901 trial pits and their architectural remains. No references could be found in Evans's notes, and there are no sketches. The available information is limited. Remains on the S slope Wall on the lower part of the S slope (Appendix: Entries 1 6-20) The information on its location, near the bottom of the slope and 26 m W of the W limit of the area tested in 1900, places it approximately below the South Porch of the Palace near the stream bank (FIG. 6.1. 9). The deposit associated with the I have reconstructed one page of Evans's original notebook from which the original drawings of tablets, often accompa- nied by annotations referring to their find-spot, have been cut out and pasted on AE/HL (document compiled as part of the study of Evans's finds from the Throne Room area, to appear in the forthcoming publication of Throne Room excavations of 1987 - cf. Hood 1994, 101). This page originally contained the drawings of seven tablets, but one is missing. From the ON sequence of the six extant tablets, it is fairly certain that the missing drawing is ON 1088, which occupied the top right corner of the page followed, in the middle of the page, by draw- ings of three tablets discovered at different places in the Palace between 9 March and 2 April 1 901. At the bottom of the page Evans drew ON 1089 and ON 1090, both annotated "S.W. Corner" and discovered on 18 April (Palmer 1963, 69-70; Firth 2001, 130). ON 1089-90 are SM (= Scripta Minoa) 35-6. On the next page there were probably drawings of ON 1091 and ON 1093 (SM 37-8) from the same area. Following Evans's Concordance, Palmer and Firth allocate ON 1088 to the same find-place although they identify it with a different SM number, either (?) 47 (Palmer) or 39 (Firth): Palmer 1963, 35, 37, but see 31, 54 where, confusingly, he allocates SM 47 to the area beyond the W Wall; Firth 1997, 18. However, to judge from the lay out of the drawings of tablets 1088 and 1089-90 on the original page, it is possible that ON 1088 was, like the next three tablets drawn on this page, an isolated fragment grouped with tablets from the SW Corner of the Palace, per- haps because this was its nearest deposit - such a fragment could have been the one from the pit SW of the Palace. If Firth is right, as I believe he is, in his concordance that ON 1088 = SM 39, it is noteworthy that in Evans's final grouping of tab- lets from the SW corner of the Palace ON 1088 was added last in the new sequence of numbers. Of course, none of these ar- guments gives an absolute proof that ON 1088/SAf 39 comes from the trial pit, and it is possible that the fragment from the pit was never recorded (Firth has suggested [personal com- munication] that it might be included in batch C: see Firth and Melena 2001, 322-3, 345-6). At any event, the reason for this exposé scrutinising AE/HL was also to highlight the limi- tations of the information on find-places of the tablets. No other clue can give absolute certainty on the find-place of a tablet, if that information was not noted by Evans on his origi- nal drawing. The differences in the dates of discovery and the find-spots of the tablets drawn on this one page are notewor- thy, as they show that the recording was not always consistent. 19 I have not been able to locate this object, which has not been published to my knowledge. 20 Appendix: Entries 11-13, 21. One box of pottery from 1901 "W. Pits" is recorded in Pendlebury 1933, 30; the location of these pits is not marked on the key-plan of the site (Money- Coutts and Pendlebury 1933, fig. 20), but it is possible that they correspond to the pits in question. The pottery in the box, dated to Neolithic, EM II-LM III and PG (Eccles et al Ï933Î X9)&gt; may be a sample of pottery from one or more pits.</page><page sequence="10">92 VASSOFOTOU wall, as well as the stratum underlying the wall, contained pottery referred to by Mackenzie as "Mycenaean", meaning probably Neopala tial. A blue glazed faience vase fragment is also mentioned, but it is not clear if it came from the pit with the wall or the pit E of it. The wall started at 3.8 m from the surface and continued to a depth of 5.3 m, which gives a pre- served height of 1.5 m. It ran E-W, but the total length un- covered is not noted. It was well built with a S face. This latter information and the fact that no floor or cross- walls are mentioned in relation to this wall, suggest that it was prob- ably a retaining wall, which might have been a terrace wall or some other construction connected with the stream rather than a building. Remains W of the Palace Drainage system (Appendix: Entries 11-12). The exact location of the drainage system cannot be estab- lished; the only indication on this matter is that the N-S drain started at the path, but the precise point or distance from the Palace is not mentioned. The system had two drains con- nected at a kind of manhole at their junction.21 The main drain started at the path where a NE curve suggests a con- tinuation, which was not explored. From this curve it ran S on a straight line for 35 m before emptying itself into the manhole, from which another similar drain ran W for 6 m before disappearing at surface level. Both drains and the man- hole were lined with what Mackenzie calls "cement" (prob- ably a special kind of plaster, like hydraulic cement22 ), and had all their angles bevelled to help counteract the infiltra- tion of water. The N-S drain was 0.18 m wide and its floor was at 0.5-0.6 m from the surface; the dimensions of the E- W drain must have been similar, but they have not been re- corded. These dimensions indicate a capacity less than half the capacity of the drainage system of the East Wing of the Palace. Both drains preserved their cover slabs at the sec- tions adjacent to the manhole, the N-S drain for a distance of 5 m, the E-W drain for 2 m from the manhole. The manhole was square, 0.75 x 0.75 m, and 1.2 m high; its opening at 0.2 m from the surface was covered by two blocks set side by side above the level of the drains. It was found full of fine sand with a few sherds. The latest pottery associated with the drains and the pot- tery found in the sand filling the manhole are described by Mackenzie as "Mycenaean", meaning probably Neopalatial rather than Postpalatial. There was also earlier pottery ("Kamares"). The purpose of this drainage system is not clear. Appar- ently it was not under any buildings that it could have served, as is the case with the drainage system of the East Wing of the Palace. The absence of building remains above it can be explained by its being so near the surface. However, if any buildings had existed, the excavation should have come across their foundations when exploring the drains; no such remains have been recorded. These drains probably served buildings and/or open spaces to the NE, but our ignorance of their pre- cise location prevents us from identifying them: the North- West Treasure House and the Théâtral Area (Hood and Taylor 1 98 1. 98, 162) are likely candidates, as are the buildings and open spaces S of the Royal Road. Walls E of the drainage system (Appendix: Entries 1 1-13) Mackenzie emphasises the great frequency of walls, together with the abundance of Mycenaean pottery mixed up with Kamares and some Roman, in the pits E of the drainage sys- tem. Apart from one case referred to below, any other infor- mation on these important remains so close to the Palace is lacking. However the presence of building remains of, appar- ently, the Neopalatial period confirms that the North- West Treasure House was not alone. Other buildings or structures existed in the area to the w/SW of it, at least up to the S side of the House of the Frescoes (Hood and Smyth 1981. 212). One of these structures was represented by a wall running W-E towards the Palace, of high quality construction (prob- ably ashlar). This wall was the only one to have been more systematically explored and is mentioned specifically by Mackenzie who thought it belonged to the Palace. No defi- nite conclusion seems to have been reached from this investi- gation, but the presence of at least one other construction of polite architecture in this quarter is important for defining its character. Walls W of the drainage system (Appendix: Entries 13, 15, 17- 21) Four pits are recorded as containing architectural remains, two near the drainage system, and two at the SW edge of the area tested. One other pit near the road had rough boulders over virgin soil at a depth of 3.6 m, but whether these boul- ders belonged to a wall is not indicated. Although other pits may have had remains that were not recorded, the general picture of the area between these two sets of pits and for 10- 12 m S of the path is that there were not any. The structures near the drainage system occurred at a depth of 1 .7 m and are described as "poor" (Appendix: En- try 13). They were not investigated further and there is no other information on them or their pottery. They were far deeper than the drain, which could suggest an earlier date, unless they were deep foundations of later (LM) buildings. The SW edge of the area tested, where two pits showed walls, should correspond to the area S of the three MM I 21 Mackenzie interprets this construction as a cistern or water depot, but its dimensions and its connection with the two drains, the N-S one running into it and the E-W one running from it, suggest that it should have been a kind of manhole. Compared with the drainage system of the East Wing of the Palace, the layout is similar to the part connected with "Shaft C" there (Macdonald and Driessen 1988, 236, fig. 1, 244-6, fig. 6) - the term "shaft" is a general term, "manhole" being the proper specific term for a covered opening providing ac- cess for cleaning and repairing a drainage system. In the case of the drainage system examined here, the manhole could not have been used to access the drains which were too narrow and must have been cleaned and repaired from above. 22 It is likely that the plaster lining of this drainage system was similar to that covering parts of the drainage system of the East Wing of the Palace, which Macdonald and Driessen call "hydraulic cement" (1988, 246). However, the use of this term is not based on chemical analysis nor was it established how the nature and consistency of this plaster compare to common plaster (C. Macdonald, personal communication). This is an interesting question that could be answered in the future.</page><page sequence="11">UNPUBLISHED BUILDING REMAINS FROM EVANS'S TRIAL PITS OF 1900-02 93 roads crossing a paved area excavated by Hutchinson (Hood and Smyth 1981. 210; Warren 1994, 196-9, 203; FIG. 6.1: W end of stippled area 10). The two pits were on an E-W line and the two walls ran on a S-N direction. The easternmost of the walls was at 1.6 m from the surface. The westernmost at 2.6 m from the surface had ashlar masonry (probably lime- stone). Although these walls were systematically explored over nine days, and must have been completely exposed, there is no other information on them or the pottery associated with them. The depth at which they started and their proximity to the MM I roads may suggest an early date. However, there was a considerable depth of deposit here, and in the eastern- most pit, in which the wall started at 1 .6 m down, a Neolithic level was found at 8 m down. BUILDING REMAINS FROM THE 1902 TRIAL PITS In 1902 the NE slope and the E part of the N slope were investigated by trial pits dug to look for buildings and ascertain whether they were connected with the Palace or were ordinary town buildings. This operation fol- lowed on from the series of trial pits dug in 190 1 on the NE slope. On the lower part of the slope, the 1901 pits did not find any architectural remains, but higher up they revealed parts of the North-East House, notably part of its E wall with mason's marks and one of its magazines (FIG. 6.6).23 These constructions looked like Palace structures to the excavators, but there were no definite plans for further investigation of the area, and a dump was put there, "for want of more convenient room elsewhere"(ZMi /Z)i? 1 902.1, 17 March, 34. Cf. DM/ DB 1 90 1. 1, 23 April, 86, 11. 24-9, 190 1.2, 29 April, 3, 11. 37-41). Within a month of beginning the 1902 campaign, the excavators came to believe that the NE precincts of the Palace extended further to the E and N than was thought previously, and decided to remove the shoot and open the trial pits.24 The pits started in the area N of the dump and NNE of the area of the North-East House tested in 1901. They revealed architectural remains only on the upper half of the slope; the lower part (like that further to the S which was tested in 1901) showed no constructions and even pottery was scarce.25 A series of architectural remains is described and sketched by Mackenzie, but more may have been found in these pits and not re- corded (FIGS. 6.1. 1 1, 6.6). The remains were scattered in the area NNE of the North-East House. As it is not clear if they belonged to one building or several, they are described below as the Building(s) NNE of the North-East House. Apart from these remains and the finds associated with them, no other material from these pits seems to have been recorded. Parallel to this first series of pits, and after the dump had been mostly removed, exploration resumed in the area adjacent to the S with new pits and an extension of the 1 90 1 pits. This operation revealed more of the North-East House, and also a Roman kiln and the North-East Kamares buildings (Hood and Taylor 1981 . 178-80; also Appendix: Entries 28-31, and comments following Entry 32). No other remains are recorded from the investigation of this area. Finally, as work in the first series of pits came to a close, another series was opened in the region adjacent to the W, its western limit being in line with the North Entrance (Appendix: Entry 30; for the North Entrance: Hood and Taylor 1981 . 154). The main outcome of these pits was the discovery of the North Pillar Hall and sub- sequently of the "Geometrical" well (Hood and Smyth 1 98 1 . 222; also Appendix: Entry 31, and comments fol- lowing Entry 32). Also in these pits was part of a space described below as the Building E of the North Pillar Hall (FIG. 6.1. 12). However, Mackenzie's comment that these constructions are the only ones "in the whole re- gion worth noting" (Appendix: Entry 32), suggests that other, probably poorer remains had been found. 23 DM/ DB 1 90 1. 1, 23 April, 86, 1. 16 to end of day; 24 April, 87, 11. 2-28, and opp. 87, sk. 24; 25 April, 90, 11. 8-12; 190 1.2, 27 April, 1, 11. 4-6; 29 April, 3, 11. 34-41; 30 April, 4, 1. 26-5, end of day; 1 May, 6, 11. 26-7. These pits proceeded to join another series of pits which had been started a few days earlier to the S: DM/ DB 1901.1, 19 April, 80, last four 11.; 20 April, 81, 11. 2- 17; 22 April, 84, 1. 18 to end of day; 23 April, 85, 1. 2-86, 1. 8. These pits then continued as one operation together with the removal of the surface soil over the area H-N/9-1 1 on the plan in Evans 1 901, pl. 1, which began on 26 April (DM /DB 1901.1, 91, 1. 2-92, 1. 1). As the northernmost series of pits closed and a dump was put there, the southernmost continued together with the clearing of the surface soil. The latter soon brought to light the North-East Magazines and the Olive Press Area, and one of the southernmost pits struck the stone am- phora in room 83 (DM /DB 1901.1, 1 May, 6, 1. 30-7, 1. 4 ; also Hood and Taylor 1981. 184, 208, 215-16), thus starting the uncovering of the East Wing of the Palace. 24 The removal of the dump started on 14 March (DM/ DB 1902.1, 14 March, 32, 11. 16-20) for reasons explained three days later (17 March, 34, 11. 4-15). This operation lasted at least one month, its progress being intermittently recorded by Mackenzie (18 March, 36; 21 March, 42; 22 March, 44; 24 March, 46; 25 March, 48; 26 March, 50; 27 March, 52; 28 March, 54; 29 March, 56; 31 March, 58 [= Appendix: Entry 22]; 3 April, 64 [= Appendix: Entry 25]; 4 April, 66 [= Ap- pendix: Entry 26]; 5 April, 68 [= Appendix: Entry 27]; 7 April, 70 [= Appendix: Entry 28]; 8 April, 72 [= Appendix: Entry 29]; 10 April, 76 [= Appendix: Entry 31]; 12 April, 81; 15 April, 84; 16 April, 86). However, by 31 March, enough of the dump was removed to allow the opening of trial pits to the N (Appendix: Entry 22; and see the comment of the previous day: "The NE shoot is still in course of removal and N of it the ground is tested by means of trial-pits with a view to finding space for further deposit when it once has become necessary to explore the outlying NE regions of the palace in the imme- diate neighbourhood W &amp; N of the NE shoot."

They have been published and are still visible. The other remains in these pits that were recorded, namely the Building(s) NNE of the North-East House and the Building E of the North Pillar Hall, were only summarily explored and the pits were backfilled.26 They belong to the Neopalatial period, and have been recorded only by Mackenzie. No references to them or to the pits as a whole could be found in Evans's surviving notes. The Building(s) NNE of the North-East House (Appendix: Entries 22-30) The architectural remains of this/these building(s) occupied the area NNE of the North-East House. FIG. 6.6 shows a sketch plan of these remains related to parts of the North-East House, compiled from an amalgam of Mackenzie's sketches.27 Un- fortunately, Mackenzie did not indicate on the sketches or in the text the distance of these remains from the North-East House, and therefore their location can be only approximately established (FIG. 6.1. 1 1). Equally, the distances between the various remains were not noted, and therefore we cannot de- termine the dimensions of the area they occupy. This is an added difficulty in establishing the connections between the various remains.28 Today (2000) there is an olive grove in this area which lies outside the archaeological site, the bound- ary of which passes over the N wall of the North-East House.29 The building(s) probably date to the Neopalatial period. Mackenzie refers to the presence in the deposit of "the usual Mycenaean pottery" (Appendix: Entry 29) and, although no description of vases or sherds is given, we can safely assume that it is of the Neopalatial period. This date is compatible with some architectural aspects (namely the use of rabbeted doorjamb bases and of a low-block type of pier), as well as with the fragments of frescoes associated with these remains (as far as we can judge from their description presented be- low). From the available information it is not clear whether the remains represented one or more buildings. The northern- most remains form a unit of four interconnected spaces (FIG. 6.6), but their connection with the wall to the SE associated with a pit, and with the wall to the S associated with a paved floor, has not been established. The preservation of the re- corded remains seems to have been good; unless the record- ing is incomplete or the deposit had entirely disappeared in parts of the area, the scattered appearance of the remains, so clear on Mackenzie's sketches, should be the result of the limited nature of the excavation. This continued only until it was ascertained that the buildings were not Palace structures (Appendix: Entry 30). There is therefore scope for a new in- vestigation of this area, which might reveal a more complete plan of the buildings. The walls appeared at a maximum depth of 0.1 m from the surface and went down to a floor level at 0.75-1. 15 m from the surface (Appendix: Entries 23-4, 28-9). This sug- gests that they were preserved to a height of 0.65-1.05 m. There was widespread evidence of fire (Appendix: Entry 23). In particular, over the paved floor associated with the southernmost wall (FIG. 6. 6) the deposit was full of ash (Ap- pendix: Entry 24), and in the N space unit, N, W and S of the square gypsum block (FIG. 6.6), at a depth varying from 0.4- 0.5 to 0.8-0.9 m fr°m the surface, there was a layer of charred wood 0.24 m thick (Appendix: Entry 25). The materials and construction of the walls and floors are described briefly. On the sketches, all the walls, apart from one show only one face, and in the case of the two walls de- scribed in the text (the wall with the paved floor and the wall with the pit, FIG. 6.6) only their E face is mentioned (Appen- dix: Entries 24, 28-9). It is not, however, possible to confirm whether this is due to their excavation being incomplete or whether they were (up to their preserved height) retaining walls. Of the two walls described, the one associated with the paved floor was of "ordinary masonry", the other associated with the pit was of "large rough blocks" (Appendix: Entries 24, and 29). However the presence of "blocks from walls" in some of the pits (Appendix: Entry 23) suggests use of ashlar masonry. In the remains in situ, ashlar was only found in the doorjambs and the pier of a wall. The doorjamb bases are gypsum blocks cut in the usual rabbeted shapes, with rab- beted stops at both ends (Appendix: Entries 25, 29), and the pier that forms the end of a freestanding wall has a base of a square gypsum block (Appendix: Entry 24; FIG. 6.6). The architectural remains recorded by Mackenzie present a plan with far too many lacunae to allow any understanding of their layout, and even the number of buildings represented eludes us. Only the northernmost remains certainly belong to one building. They form a unit of four interconnecting spaces, two of which communicate with a dithyron or polythyron. Two doorjamb bases were found in situ, the east- ernmost having rabbeted stops on both sides indicating the presence of another to the E, which seems to have been dis- 26 The filling in of at least some of these pits seems to have been done in 1902 (Appendix: comments following Entry 32). 27 The wall marked "1901" on the sketches of Appendix: En- tries 24, 28 corresponds to the wall marked 1 (and probably also to the wall marked 2) in DM/ DB 1901.1, opp. 87, sk. 24. This wall is part of the N part of the E façade of the North- East House. It also appears on a sketch illustrating the progress of excavation of the North-East House on 9 April (DM/ DB 1902. 1, opp. 74, sk. 61 [not included in the Appendix but used in FIG. 6.6]), which also includes Magazine II and the begin- ning of excavation of Magazine I. 28 Mackenzie usually drew his sketches at approximately 1 : 100. If this holds for the sketches in Appendix Entries 28-9, the remains circumscribe an area approximately 10 m N-S x 8 m E-W, which could easily represent a single building (cf. FIG. 6.6, where note that it is reduced to 90%). The measurements of the doorway noted on the sketch of Appendix: Entry 29 indicate a 1:100 scale for the sketch. However, this may not apply for the distances between the different walls, which may have been at another (larger) scale, from lack of space on the page of the Daybook. 29 Probably the area was tested without having been expropri- ated. This would explain the filling in of the pits and the fact that the excavation never resumed, which that of the North- East House did.</page><page sequence="14">96 VASSOFOTOU appeared (Appendix: Entry 29). Mackenzie restores a jamb with rabbeted stops on one side (FIG. 6.6), effectively estab- lishing a dithyron. However the restoration of two jambs, one with rabbeted stops on both sides and one against the E wall with stops on one side, is possible. The gap seems long enough to accommodate a further door, and the presence of frescoes in the deposit where this door should have come makes this restoration more likely than the one proposed by Mackenzie. Despite its largely incomplete plan, the construction and lay out of the N unit presents characteristics of polite archi- tecture, and the building to which it belonged must have been similar to the neighbouring North-East House and to the other buildings nearer to the Palace. This conclusion is further sup- ported by the presence in the deposit between the pier and the polythyron (on the areas noted with crosses on the plan, FIG. 6.6) of two large deposits of fresco fragments apparently belonging to two different frescoes. These fresco deposits are the only material from the building(s) to have been recorded.30 The northernmost deposit was found E of the restored doorjamb at 0.3 m from the surface (Appendix: Entry 24; FIG. 6.6). It contained fragments described by Mackenzie as being "chiefly of dado bands - red-blue-black-white" (Ap- pendix: Entry 23). These "banded dadoes" are common in Minoan architecture (Cameron 1974, 1 14), and these particu- lar fragments may or may not still exist. I have not tried to locate them during my searches in the Herakleion Museum and the Stratigraphical Museum. The second deposit was found in the space S of the re- stored doorjamb and N of the gypsum pier base, immediately underneath the layer of charred wood, referred to above (Ap- pendix: Entries 24-5, also Entry 22; FIG. 6.6). This places this fresco deposit above the floor level which was at 1. 15 m from the surface (Appendix: Entry 29). The fragments of this fresco are described by Mackenzie as fragments of simple fresco cornice with painted imitation of grained parti-col- oured marble (Appendix: Entries 22-5). The theme of the fresco with imitation of marble recalls the fresco known as the "Marbled Dado" (imitating marble or fine-grained stone, such as gypsum, panelling), which, coincidentally, was found that year, and sketched and pub- lished promptly by Fyfe (1903, no; FIG. 6.7 a-b)?x Evans's notes32 confirm the published accounts on the provenance of the Marbled Dado from the area E of the East Light Well of the Hall of the Double Axes. It therefore seems fairly certain that large fragments of two frescoes33 both with marble imi- tation were recovered in 1902, one on the flat representing a dado, the other with some kind of moulding34 which possibly formed the border of a relief fresco (Fyfe 1903, 1 16-17) or marked the top of a wall, or of a door or window frame.35 To my knowledge the Marbled Cornice has not been pub- lished, nor even mentioned in a preliminary report or The Palace ofMinos, or in Fyfe's article although it has a section on 'moulded work' (1903, 1 16-19). This is puzzling particu- larly because, if we judge from the great impression it made on Mackenzie,36 it must have been an exceptional piece and a good example of the large-scale architectural decoration used in buildings of Knossian polite architecture. Cameron, in his section on 'dadoes imitating stonework' presents six exam- ples of such frescoes, among which is the Marbled Dado but not the Marbled Cornice.37 He seems to have been unaware of Mackenzie's notes on the cornice, and one might assume that he did not look for it in the museums. 30 There is no account of the pottery. Three boxes of pottery from 1902 "N. Pits" are recorded in Pendlebury 1933, 30, but the location of these pits is not marked on Money-Coutts and Pendlebury 1933, fig. 20. They could well be other pits (in the area of the North Pillar Hall and the Building E of it described below) W of the pits I discuss. The pottery in the boxes was mostly LM I with some Neolithic and MM I, one MM II and one LM II (Eccles et al. 1933, 19). 3 1 Note that the sketch (FIG. 6.7 a) shows and states the existence of "traces of 4 panels", but the published drawing (FIG. 6.7 b) omits the fragment of the fourth panel joining the other three on the left. Evans referred to this fresco in his report (1902, 1 10) and discussed it in more detail, reproducing Fyfe 's draw- ing, in Evans 1921, 355-6, fig. 255. 32 For 2-3 March 1902 Evans noted: "E. of Hall offert s. [Dou- ble Axes] below under ataoviov [Hood and Taylor 1981. 239 (Space 94); see also Evans 1928, plan B] a large piece of plaster from a wall with red panels + marbling on a white ground." (AE/NB 1902, 35, 11. 9-1 1). This tallies with Fyfe's sketch (FIG. 6.7 a), as well as with Mackenzie's entry for 3 March, which refers to the discovery of large pieces of fresco from the same spot, although no description of the fresco is given: "Nothing of interest has turned up except that at E of the en- trance to the Hall of the Double Axes a little down the slope underneath the level of a threshing-floor large pieces of fresco have been uncovered some upside down some face up. 2 or 3 metres further E &amp; down the foundations of what may be a terrace wall run NS." (DM/DB 1902.1, 17, 11. 12-19). The first fragments of the Marbled Cornice were found later in the same month (31 March), and were not known at the time of these notes. In the last entry in his 1902 Notebook, Evans re- fers to the "Labyrinth Fresco" in connection with the "Mar- ble fresco": "E. Threshing floor Area - Near the Marble fresco - in same tones - interesting pieces of maze pattern - with triple openings - Compare bit of 'key' ornament on Kamáres seal" (AE/NB 1902, 73, 11. 10-13). However, this entry does not seem to have been made during the discovery of the Laby- rinth Fresco; perhaps it was made at home, upon inspection of the trays with the frescoes, and possibly after the Marbled Cornice was found. No reference is made by Mackenzie to the Labyrinth Fresco. The association of the Labyrinth Fresco with the Marbled Dado can be questioned; the former may well be among the many fresco fragments found in the spaces of the Marbled Cornice. 33 According to Fyfe's sketch (FIG. 6.7 a) the fragments of the Marbled Dado cover an area of more than 2.2 m in length by about 1.88 m in height. Mackenzie's references to the frag- ments of the Marbled Cornice give the impression that they were substantial fragments. 34 'Cornice' implies moulding - see the definition in Harris 1975: "Any molded projection which crowns or finishes the part to which it is affixed". 35 S. Hood also believes this. I have corresponded at length with him about these two frescoes and thank him for considering the data painstakingly, sharing his observations and conclu- sions with me, and making very constructive comments. 36 The cornice is repeatedly noted in his excavation accounts and there is a special annotation on the page opposite to draw at- tention to it (Appendix: Entries 22, 24-5). This annotation must have been written during revisions in preparing The Pal- ace of Minos, but it was clearly not taken into final account.</page><page sequence="15">UNPUBLISHED BUILDING REMAINS FROM EVANS'S TRIAL PITS OF 1900-02 97 Fig.6.7.

A wooden label in the tray states "K.2 Fresco from Pits N. of Palace", written in pencil in Mackenzie's hand. It would appear that these fragments come from the 1902 trial pits, but I could not be sure that they belong to the cornice or to any other of the frescoes found in these pits. A thorough examination of these fragments is nec- essary in order to assess this. The Building E of the North Pillar Hall (Appendix: Entry 32) The architectural remains of this building described by Mac- kenzie consist of a N-S wall associated with a plaster floor. The wall lay at 13.4 m E of the E wall of the North Pillar Hall (FIG. 6.1. 12). Its W face was of limestone blocks of smaller size than those of the walls of the North Pillar Hall. Some of the blocks had a trident mason's mark carved on them. To judge from the fact that the floor was at a depth of 1 .6 m from the surface, this wall must have been preserved to a good height. It is not clear, however, if the wall had another face, nor on which side of the wall was the floor. If the floor was W of the wall, the ashlar face of the latter would have been an interior face, as in the case of the walls of the North Pillar Hall. The building would have extended westward, and might have been connected with the North Pillar Hall. If the floor was E of the wall, its ashlar face should have corre- sponded to the building's W façade, and these remains would have belong to a space of a building separate but similar to the North Pillar Hall. There is no specific clue to date these remains (whether description of the pottery or of the carving of the signs), but they were probably contemporary to the North Pillar Hall. CONCLUSION The exact number of trial pits opened in the immedi- ate surroundings of the Palace during the first three campaigns of the excavations is not known, but they were probably more than 100. Apart from the interest the remains found in these pits have in themselves, the pits as a whole are an invaluable source of information for understanding the area surrounding the Palace dur- ing the various periods of occupation of the Kephala. Although the recording of the excavation of the pits is far from complete, it does add a few pieces in the great puzzle of Knossos, and in particular of Neopalatial Knossos. It would appear that during the Neopalatial Period the Palace was surrounded by buildings except in two areas, one to the S and one to the W. More precisely, the central part of the S façade and the part of the W façade corresponding to Magazines IX-XVIII had an almost unobstructed view. The quarter flanking the Royal Road to the S was confined to the series of buildings near the road. The area S of these buildings seems to have been left mostly un-built. To the NE, the Palace was flanked by buildings dotting the area E of the North Pillar Hall to the NNE of the North-East House. However, in the lower part of this slope, between this quarter and the quarter of the Royal Villa, the area seems to have been mostly unbuilt. The buildings found in the pits, insofar as they have been explored, seems to have been similar in their lay out and architecture to those already known such as the South House, House of the Chancel Screen, South-East House, East House etc. They were detached buildings with many of the characteristics of polite architecture.

Appendix Extracts from Evans's Notebooks and Mackenzie's Daybooks with transcriptions and comments This publication of the excavation records for the re- mains we have discussed aims to allow the reader to check the data and the interpretations that have been presented, and to grasp the problems and see the lacu- nae in the only sources of information for these re- mains. As these documents, however, were not meant to be published, it took thought to decide how to present them. From the experience of publishing Harriet Boyd Hawes's excavation archive (Fotou 1993), I believe that the best publication of such documents is to have a fac- simile copy of the original side by side with a compu- ter-based transcription accompanied by comments. The transcription should reproduce the original text and sketches exactly; for more clarity letters or signs in the text referring to sketches may appear in bold and in a different font from that of the text. The comments should allow the reader to correlate the entries with the discussion and point out any inconsistencies, errors or ambiguities in the entries. Large sections of Evans's Notebooks, Mackenzie's Daybooks and Fyfe's Sketch- books have already been prepared in this way for forth- coming publications of a number of Neopalatial build- ings and of the rooms N and W of the Throne Room. However, in view of the character of this volume and the space available to contributors, the length of this appendix had to be kept to a minimum. Consequently, facsimiles from Evans's Notebooks have been reduced to 75% and the facsimiles of texts in Mackenzie's Day- books omitted, although his sketches are included and reproduced at original size. The reproductions of the facsimiles have been made from photocopies of the originals and have been cleaned up and enhanced by hand, although sometimes ink spots mar the texts. For the present task photocopies were thought a better choice than photographs or scanned images.</page><page sequence="18">100 VASSOFOTOU Vf A '*N ^ 'fi iff b Z N w '*N ^ // I iff i b Z j •"» '*N ^ I iff b Z •"» N r t ^ 1 4 ! 1 4 tilxiü i * tf î ¡ li ^ 1 i S ini a /// ° | I v 1 1 „ !

Also at M£ Evans' suggestion the trial-pits on the S. slope were also at once started instead of being left for a subsequent date. - MM and LM pottery in pits W of Palace. In the case of the pits W. of the palace it at once began to be apparent that there would be walls on account of the large quantities of pot sherds. There were large numbers of Mycenaean fragments but along with these many fragments that could be identified as 'Kamarais'. One would naturally have expected that the 'Kamarais' ware should be deeper than the Mycenaean but we must take account of the fact that deposit is apt to be disturbed next the surface in case of a cultivated site. - Drain in pit W of Palace. A curious feature appeared in one of the pits at a few centimetres from the surface in the shape of a cement lined drain running N- S or S-N it was for the moment difficult to say [p. 4] which. The nearness to the surface made I one suspect post-Mycenaean construction yet I the nearness to the surface descending W. has to be taken account of also in the case of the great W. paved area partially ex- cavated last year.
