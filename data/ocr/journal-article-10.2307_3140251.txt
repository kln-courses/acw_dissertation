In the Journal of Biblical Literature, Vol. XIV., Parts I and 2. The truth of the Scriptures is exhibited in specific shape, adjusted to par- ticular times, persons, and places, and primarily intended for temporary needs. Although some exceptions, as the golden rule and various moral exhortations, may be proved, the truth of this statement will appear immediately to a thoughtful reader of the Bible. But this fact has been forgotten for many reasons. Some read the Old Testament as a sort of allegory, and its terms have been transformed so that they refer simply to the life beyond the grave. A striking illustration of this in the New Testament is the Apocalypse. Such a spiritualizing process is not wholly objectionable; indeed it is to be found in the New Testament itself. Thus John lifts the words of Caiphas into a prophecy. Paul makes a striking use of the veil over Moses' face. Further, some biblical precepts have been allowed to lapse, their exclusive application to the times when they were uttered being thus tacitly granted. Thus the precepts about wearing veils, the treatment of unmarried daughters, the pro- hibition of braided hair, the holy kiss, washing saints' feet. Many other pas- sages can be understood correctly only by realizing this historical element. The statements in regard to the angels ascending and descending on the Son of Man, the abode of demons, the fall of Satan, have little force if taken literally and allowance be not made for the beliefs and expressions of the time in which they were uttered. In theology we see the influence of rabbin- ical training in the recognition by Paul of the Adamic headship to the unity of the rise. The Parousia of Christ is to be understood by recognition of the local and historical cast of Christ's language. Jesus was of necessity led to use language that would be understood by his hearers. Mingled fulfil- ment and deferment, verification and transformation, old hopes blossoming into new surprises, these are some of the steps of him "who moves in a mysterious way his wonders to perform." The fact of the historical character of the language of the New Testament leads to the following suggestions: (I) It emphasizes the importance of studying the New Testament in its literary, national, and local relations. Students need courses of study in the literature, Jewish, heathen, and Chris- tian, immediately preceding and following that of the Bible. (2) The recog- nition of the historical cast of our sacred records will lend new value to geographical and archaeological information relative to the merit of their origin; and because of this (3) it is time that an American school for oriental study and research should be established in Palestine. 304</page><page sequence="2">SYNOPSES OF IMIPORTANT ARTICLES 305 The article from which this abstract has been made was the author's annual address as president of the Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis, at its yearly meeting in Hartford, June 2, 1895. It is especially noteworthy for two things: (i) Its recognition of the absolute necessity of historical training for the exegete; (2) its proposal for an American School in Palestine. So far as the second item is concerned, it is gratifying to learn that the society has recommended the formation of a school somewhat after the fashion of the American School at Athens, to be supported by subscriptions from the various theological seminaries, and that a committee has been appointed to bring the matter before proper authorities. There is an abundant need of some such institution as this. Biblical study, although gaining vastly from the work of the Palestine Exploration Fund and the German Palestinian Society, is still greatly in need of material similar to that which has of late years revolutionized classical studies. It is sincerely to be hoped that an American School will be established, and that it may prove as successful in throwing light upon the historical background of the Scriptures as has been the American School at Athens in throwing light upon Greek history. S. M. THE LITERARY FEATURES AND THE INSPIRATION OF THE HISTORICAL BOOKS OF THE OLD TESTAMENT. By E. L. CURTIS, in the New Chris- tian Quarterly, July 1895. Pp. 64-71 . Two groups of historical works appear in the Old Testament, one Genesis to 2 Kings (except Ruth), the other, I and 2 Chronicles, Ezra and Nehemiah. An examination of Chronicles shows that it draws its material from earlier written sources, some of which it names, others, e. g., Kings, being silently used. The same general fact is true of all the historical books. The method of employing these sources is compilation, i. e., making extracts verbatim and joining them together. On a framework like that found in Judges the compiler arranges his collections thus drawn from other writings. These earlier writings laid under tribute are of four kinds: stories, laws, annals and genealogies. Stories preserve the early history in the only form it has come down to us, often inadequately, from the historical point of view, but most successfully from the emotional and religious point of view, which is that taken by the biblical writers. Much of the biblical history is child's history, and preserves details which serve to "point a moral or adorn a tale," not to present historic motives and results. Sometimes, in compiling these narratives, the extracts from different writings are placed together without change. Sometimes modifications, omis- sions and changes were made to remove discrepancies and produce a consis- tent impression. A comparison of details in Kings and Chronicles shows this process. Does such a procedure cast doubt on the trustworthiness of these histories? Observe in reply (i) that these writers are evidently sincere and honest. (2) Modern research has confirmed the truthfulness of much of their geo- graphical detail and historical reference. (3) The purpose is not primarily historical but religious, hence omissions and adaptations, in order to accom-</page><page sequence="3">306 THE BIBLICAL WORLD plish the end of teaching religion, " Exact, painstaking histories, written in a scientific historical manner, could never have served as a vehicle of religious truth." The religious element of the Old Testament historical books is threefold: (I) prophetic, insistence on righteousness of life, (2) priestly, insistence on religious institutions, (3) the ultimate design of both prophetic and priestly histories to set forth a history of redemption. This constitutes their unique character, their inspiration. This element of redemption appears in the his- tory of Israel, in its bright and dark sides; in the institutions of Israel, both civil and religious. God was specially in history and institutions alike, making them a prophecy of Christ. The records of this history are also inspired, since they directly and specially reveal God. "No other history has been written like theirs. The writers of that history were inspired. They wrote as they were moved by the Holy Ghost, and, save in the writers of the New Testament, they have had no successors, and they will never have until Christ shall come again in his glory." The recognition of the imperfect character of the biblical histories from the literary and historical point of view must needs reconcile itself somehow with the use of them for religious purposes at the present day. It is necessary to be assured pri- marily of the good faith of the writers in the use they made of their materials; to determine whether this use of the materials has produced something which is of any special historical value; then, finally, to decide just what benefit religion is to derive from the finished product. The writer of this article has clearly set forth the literary limitations of the writers. It is not so clear that he has been so successful in uncovering the attitude of the writers toward the materials they had, regarded as his- tory. If the chronicler made changes in matters of fact, it is not enough to say that the evidence goes to show that he was honest. It is just that evidence which we want. We desire an explanation of why he felt justified in making the change. If he deliberately altered what he knew to be true, because of some laudable religious motive, it is a case of acting on the principle of the end justifying the means- which by no means justifies him. If it be pleaded that the literary and historical conscience of the time was not sensitive with respect to the use made of these traditional stories, that is a valid answer on one of two grounds, first, if evidence from other sources can be brought for- ward to substantiate it; or, second, if it be merely an inference from the present case. It is in vagueness on this point that we find a weakness of the present article. There is no adequate bridge thrown across the gap between the literary form of these books and their inspiration. Their form, content and character must go together. We cannot make them rough compilations, "child's histories" - and then cover the multitude cf sins by asserting, without more adequate proof, that they reveal the divine plan of redemption, and hence are inspired. For the question is whether the facts of the books on which you base your argument for the history of redemption are real and essential facts, the institutions real institutions, characteristic of the life of the nation during the centuries of its history. The writings are all that we now have, not, e. g., the ark itself or the dial of Ahaz. Is the author sawing off the limb on which he is stand-</page><page sequence="4">SYNOPSES OF IMPORTANT ARTICLES 307 ing, when he depreciates the form and historical content of the books which have so wonderful a religious element? This religious element may have been read into a series of scattered and non-representative, if not manufactured, facts. To draw the events from the literature, to see in the events thus drawn a unique religious element to assert the inspiration of the events, and therefore the inspiration of the literature - is reasoning around the bush. Why not first infer the inspiration of the writing from the unique religious insight disclosed in it, then argue to the inspiration of the writers and that of the history out of which they sprang? G. S. G. "UEBER BERECHTIGUNG DER KRITIK DES ALTEN TESTAMENTS." By DR. AUGUST KOHLER, University of Erlangen, pp. 68. The bulk of the Pentateuch belongs to the post-Mosaic period; only a small portion of the legal sections are from the pen of Moses him elf. The historical character of such portions as the narratives concerning creation, the fall, and the deluge is questionable. Errors in the historical, archaeologi- cal, and similar sections of the Old Testament writings must be accepted. The church of our day can no longer refuse to look the scientific discussion of Old Testament problems square in the face. It would not do to place a system of religious or theological thought higher than the historical research of the Scriptures. To ignore or shut one's eyes to the critical problems does more harm than good. To do this only arouses the suspicion that the church has either not the courage or the means to meet the difficulties. Among these, and as examples, mention can be made of the deluge, in regard to which the old traditional view is no longer tenable. It is true, that with God all things are possible, yet it requires the boldest of hypotheses to comprehend how on the basis of the Old Testament account of the deluge, salt and sweet water fishes could continue to live in the same sea for a whole year, or how in the ark a single window one ell high could admit enough air for all the inmates; or how the animals from the polar districts could live side by side with those from the tropics, the ice bear with the anthropomorphic ape, in the same temperature; or how Noah, with the seven members of his family, could provide for the wants of all the animals, which, according to Gen. 6: 21 I, had to be fed, or whence he gained the knowledge of the needs of each kind of animals; how these could be provided with food and drink, and their stalls be kept clean; how the needs of the carniferous animals for fresh meat could be satisfied in the ark. The details of this narrative and of others are so past comprehension that, if we leave out of consideration the theory of the different strata in the nar- rative, it is almost impossible to understand the matter or to take them as the report of a real historical transaction. In regard to the appeal to the authority of Christ and of the New Testa- ment in defense of the historical correctness of these details it must be remem- bered just what Christ's position as authority in these matters was. Jesus indeed calls the Pentateuch the book of Moses, or in brief calls it "Moses"</page><page sequence="5">308 THE BIBLICAL WIORLD (Mark 12:26; Luke 16:29); but he does so not in order to give his hearers information as to the author of these books, but in harmony with the desig- nation of these books current in that day. It does not matter how this desig- nation originated, or what Jesus' judgment may have been in regard to the correctness or incorrectness of this view; he could at that time make use of this view of the Pentateuch without any further considerations, just as we, e. g., speak of the Apostles' Creed and of the Apostolic Constitutions, although we know full well that neither the one nor the other is the product of on apostle's pen. And he in fact was compelled to make use of this view, in case he wanted to make himself understood to the people of his day; otherwise he would, by imparting instructions on natural things, have stepped out of the sphere of his calling as the teacher of heavenly things. Who is the author of the Penta- teuch can be determined only by an historical investigation and critical examination of the contents and form of these books; and the most important fact in reaching the conclusions in this matter is that the Pentateuch itself, not even at Ex. 17:14, or Deut. 31:9, 34 claims to have been written as a whole by Moses. Essentially the same principles obtain in judging of Christ's attitude toward the book of Daniel, in Mark 24: 15. As the prophetic book cited by him was currently ascribed to Daniel, this was naturally the term which he too made use of in speaking of this writing, no matter who the real author was. Even such passages as Matt. 22:41-46 (Mark I2:35-37, Luke 20:41- 44) and Acts 2:24-36 cannot be used as evidence that Pss. I iO and 16 were written by David, even if in other respects the arguments of Jesus and of Peter are correct. In passing judgment on these passages the fact must never be lost sight of that the Psalter in the days of David was called "the Book of David" (2 Mac. 2: 13) and for this reason every quotation from the Psalter could be called a word of David (cf. Acts 4:25 and Ps. 2:1 ; Heb. 4:7 and Ps. 95:7, 8, which are passages from anonymous psalms). The purpose of this question of Christ, Matt. 22:41-46, to show how the current view that the Messiah was to be the son of David, i. e., his equal, could be harmonized with the word of the Psalter, according to which he was to be David's superior. The purpose of Peter, Acts 2:34-36, was not to show that Ps. I6:8-II was a word of David, but to make this the basis of an argument concerning the resurrection of Christ. This brochure, first published in its essentials as an article in the Neue Kirchliche Zeitschrift, is a sign of the times, and has created a sensation in conservative circles and the German Protestant church. Kohler, since Delitzsch's death, has been regarded as the chicf protagonist of the conservative views, and in his Lehrbuch der Bibl. geschichkte Alten 7Testaments, completed only recently, is conservative to the core. In the present article he yields much more than Delitzsch ever did, and this fact shows what inroads the newer critical views are making, even in the conservative ranks. What he says is not exactly new, but the fact that it is he who says it and defends it is significant. G. H. S.</page></plain_text>
