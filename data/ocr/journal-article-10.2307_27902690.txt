<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE TRANSFORMATION OF HERMENEUTICS: 19TH CENTURY ANCIENTS AND 20TH CENTURY MODERNS "There is more to-do about interpreting interpretations than interpreting the facts themselves. There are more books about books than about anything else. We do nothing but make commentaries on one another." ?Montaigne Hermeneutics is one of those archaic and refractory, yet fashionable words which seem to crop up in so many places that they take on a power all their own. E. D. Hirsch has observed that the word has become "a rather vague, magical talisman."1 For better or worse hermeneutics has entered into the theoretical controversies of literary criticism, history, sociology, anthropology, political science, philosophy?not only the theory of the humane disciplines but even the theory of the natural sciences. This essay will attempt to examine a distinction which has become deep ly engrained in the discussion of hermeneutics, that is, the distinction between "traditional" or "methodological" hermeneutics?identified with the current of German thought stretching from Humboldt and Schleiermacher through Droysen and Dilthey?and "radical" or "ontological" hermeneutics, which is identified with Heidegger and some of his students, such as Rudolf Bultmann, Ludwig Binswanger, and most notably Hans-Georg Gadamer. The older, methodological hermeneutics is said to be primarily concerned with the justification of interpretive understanding as knowledge or "science" (Wis senschaft), while the newer, ontological hermeneutic is claimed to be con cerned with different matters altogether. The major principles of the traditional hermeneutics were laid down in the course of the 19th century, while those of the radical position have been articulated over the last fifty years, since the publication of Heidegger's Sein und Zeit in 1927. For the sake of brevity it seems appropriate to speak of a battle of 19th century "ancients" and 20th century "moderns" fought over the grounds of interpretation-theory. The battle is by no means over, nor can one assume that it has been decided in favor of the moderns. On the one hand, a number of contemporary thinkers such as Emilio Betti and E. D. Hirsch have restated and refined the case of the ancients; on the other, the moderns' position has been defended by other contemporary commentators such as Richard Palmer and David Hoy. At the risk of making matters even more complicated, it is necessary to point out that a third position, which attempts</page><page sequence="2">176 MICHAEL ERMARTH to combine both the traditional and radical camps has been indicated by Ludwig Landgrebe, Otto-Friedrich Bollnow, and Paul Ricoeur. They, too, however, have drawn a sharp contrast between the two hermeneutic tradi tions of the 19th and 20th centuries. The proponents of the new hermeneutics claim a decisive advance over their 19th century predecessors. They claim to be "radical" in the sense of fundamental, critical, and universal: in short, in being truly philosophical. While they take up some of the tenets of 19th century hermeneutics, they car ry them forward in quite a different direction. For example, the ancients' ex tension of hermeneutics from a "special" to a "general" form (from special canonical texts to all texts) has been further extended to betoken a universal condition of man's being. This extension carries a profound shift in focus? from epistemology to ontology. The concern of 19th century thinkers with method, validity, and the proper grounds of interpretation as knowledge is now taken to be derivative of a more fundamental ontological recognition, that is, hermeneutics is not a special way of knowing certain special mean ings, but rather is man's way of "being-in-the-world." Hermeneutics in this latter sense is thereby allied with the phenomenology of human existence, which in turn is taken up in the even more basic task of fundamental on tology. A second major difference emerges in the moderns' charge that the 19th century hermeneutic operated with a conception of meaning which was "romantic," subjectivistic, and ultimately psychologistic. It is claimed that meaning was falsely conceived as being primarily a matter of inwardly private, subjective states of mind, which are somehow contained in their out ward manifestation. Texts are thought to be "expressions of life." This "romantic" and "expressivist" notion of meaning is now rejected as naive, superficial, and inadequate. It is claimed that the very essence of meaning is to transcend those traditional categories of subject/object, inner/outer, self/world with which 19th century thinkers vainly attempted to characterize meaning. The new hermeneutics finds the subject-to-subject model of meaning transmission to be snared in a Cartesian notion of the subject, that is, a pure, thinking cogito which proceeds to know by analyzing the workf into "ob jects" set over against itself, and which also entails a secondary, reflective awareness of the subject knowing that it knows things only "as" such-and such. This model of knowing is held to be inadequate: for the moderns in terpretive understanding (Verstehen) is a surrender to the Sache selbst, not to its conceptual or contextual shadow. When we are truly "seized" or taken by a meaning, we do not filter this meaning through the grid of intermediary categories which determine it as belonging to "art," "religion," or "history." It does not belong to us and our categories, we belong to it.</page><page sequence="3">TRANSFORMATION OF HERMENEUTICS 177 A third and related major difference concerns the notion of Verstehen as empathie re-construction, re-enactment, or re-experiencing. The old hermeneutics held meaning to be primarily a matter of the interpreter's reconstituting the genesis, development, and derivation of the originator's ideas and mental contents. The new hermeneutic, on the other hand is far more radical. It does not view hermeneutics as being concerned solely with establishing or re-cognizing past meanings but rather puts forward on tological claims concerning the relation between past meaning and the "hap pening" of history itself. In this connection the moderns claim that the old hermeneutics is "naive," especially because it fails to take time and temporal distance seriously. We only mislead ourselves in thinking that we can think as if we were Caesar at the Rubicon: try as we will, we are not Caesar, nor can we think as he did. The passage of time and historical epochs has rendered such a re-experiencing impossible: the historicity of understanding is an on tological condition of all interpretation, one among several said to be overlooked by the 19th century theoreticians. I In order to understand these points of contrast, we must first look more closely at the general premises and aims of the 19th century hermeneutic tradition and then illustrate them through the views of three prominent representatives of that tradition?Schleiermacher, Droysen, and Dilthey. It is the cumulative and complementary character of their views which justifies speaking of a 19th century tradition which culminates in Dilthey. Most broadly the 19th century thinkers operated upon the assumptions of what could be termed "humanistic historicism," that is, that the deepest and truest understanding of human matters is historical in character. A human phenomenon is comprehended most fully in both its individuality and its relations by means of tracing its genesis and development. Its essence is its becoming or coming-to-be; in Hegel's phrase Wesen ist was gewesen ist. Becoming assumes special "generic" importance for mankind, since mankind becomes what it is in history. Human nature is historical and history in the broadest sense is "anthropogenesis" or Bildung. Man can become, at least potentially, the product of his own ideas and actions. The larger course of history is the self-formation of mankind and, as persons we realize our fullest humanity in studying man in history. Another tenet of the 19th century tradition held that meaning is primari ly a matter of consciousness and only secondarily a matter of the language or sign-system in which meaning comes to be. Meaning, too, is a kind of becom ing over time; it is produced in the mind and "embodied" in expressions. The 19th century theoreticians tended to use the Christian imagery of spirit and</page><page sequence="4">178 MICHAEL ERMARTH body or the equally image-laden notion of "inner" and "outer" to define the relation of meaning to expression. Indeed meaning is "// " the language like the Christian is supposed to be "in" the world: it is "in" the language but not "of it?the expression is not of the language but of the mind behind it. To understand is to grasp what some expression meant to those who expressed it?and not primarily or necessarily to attend to what it means to us in our terms. The understanding of meaning then is the re-presentation of the con sciousness of the expresser within the retrospective consciousness of the in terpreter. These premises together put a premium upon human agency and man's capacity to initiate and conduct dynamic processes of thinking, acting, and creating toward some purpose. Correlatively they stipulate the task of in terpretation largely in terms of retracing these processes toward some end state?indeed, some end-state-of-mind, which is in some sense identical with or similar to the consciousness of the originator. Friedrich Schleiermacher (1768-1834) is generally credited with systematically formulating the basic principles of hermeneutics. Dilthey, looking back, meant to convey as much in calling Schleiermacher the "Kant of hermeneutics." Along with Wilhelm von Humboldt, Schleiermacher con ceived the decisive advance from the special "dogmatic" hermeneutics of classical and sacred texts, with their own special rules, to the notion of a general theory of exegesis based upon a common method for all texts. Indeed the movement of generalization was extended beyond written texts altogether to wherever thoughts come into words, as in conversation (Gespr?che) and the matters of daily routine (Gesch?fte). Schleiermacher did not restrict hermeneutics to writing, much less to canonical texts such as Plato or the Bi ble, but expanded it to encompass all human manifestations. Methodical in terpretation can open up worlds of meaning by directing the interpreter to the creative spirit behind all expressions.2 By conceiving interpretation as ubiquitous and extending hermeneutics to cover the whole range of life and human expression, Schleiermacher gave it a universal and theoretical rather than a primarily practical exegetical cast. Interpretation was linked to our very sense of being alive, for as human be ings we live "understanding^"; there is a kind of unreflected, virtual hermeneutics inherent even in a child's initial grasp of verbal meaning.3 In Schleiermacher, meaning is both initially bestowed and subsequently grasped through man's creative powers of thought and action. Understanding is the reconstitution (Nachbildung) of these creative powers from the expression at hand. Such reconstitution is ultimately possible because Schleiermacher finds "the whole world to be ideally postulated in man."4</page><page sequence="5">TRANSFORMATION OF HERMENEUTICS 179 Another signal contribution lay in the extension of the hermeneutic cir cle beyond the inner relations within a text. Schleiermacher stressed, as had others before him, the inevitable circularity of all understanding: we under stand the parts of a text only through a sense of the whole, but understand this whole only through its parts. This condition of all interpretation necessitates throwing off the sterile distinction between induction and deduction, both of which are subsumed in the circle of thinking. Logic cannot fully account for the actual process of understanding, for there is something intuitive and "divinatory" about it. But the circle of interpretation extends beyond this: in addition to the relation between part and whole within the text, the in terpreter must already have a preliminary sense (Vorkenntnis) of the whole matter and context being presented, if he is to grasp the particular meaning at hand. 'One has to know the person in order to understand his speech and yet one only comes to know the person through the speech."5 We grasp the par ticular from the general and the general from the particular. Understanding is thus a dynamic and reciprocal but always approximative effort?an "endless task" like Kant's moral Idea.6 I now turn to an examination of a second important but less renowned figure in the development of 19th century hermeneutics, Johann Gustav Droysen (1808-1884). Droysen was a student of Hegel and of Boeckh and was also influenced by Humboldt and Schleiermacher. His Historik can be regarded as a particular kind of hermeneutics?a hermeneutics of historical knowledge?or Organon (Wissenschaftslehre) of historical thought. But it is not a reversion to what Schleiermacher would call a "special hermeneutics," since Droysen regarded historical knowledge as the primary means by which the human mind approximates the "absolute totality."7 History for Droysen, as for Ranke and the Historical School, was a kind of sacred text writ large, if somewhat cryptically. It is indicative of his position that Droysen quoted Sebastian Franck approvingly: "history too is a kind of Bible."8 With Droysen hermeneutics was transformed into "histories": the interpretation of meaning belongs to the larger science of history. Droysen, who once defined his standpoint as "lying between theology and philology," held that to un derstand means "to understand historically." Such historical understanding, however, is the very opposite of a mere representation of a past reality which is "dead" to the present. The Verstehen of the works and traces of the past is not a passive mimesis but a "new creation" (weitere Sch?pfung) which there by contributes to the further development of history.9 Droysen's conception of historical understanding emphasized the active, formative work of consciousness. History as knowledge is not the past an sich but a mental construct of the past. The historical representation cannot give</page><page sequence="6">180 MICHAEL ERMARTH the whole of the past, for it is selective and inevitably fragmentary. Indeed, we grasp not the past itself but the past which is ideally (ideell) contained in the present. History as knowledge, then, is "so to say, a transposition into another medium in which something is added and something is lost."10 The historian is not a tabula rasa or pure, disinterested spectator; Droysen con tested Ranke's "ocularism" and insisted that the historian always has both a personal and formative relationship with his material. The historical viewpoint is to this extent ideal and "artificial." It per force gets things "backwards" within its own formative perspective. Life is not lived "for history"; actions are not carried out "for history"; art is not created "for history" they are only thus interpreted from the historical view point. Echoing Hegel, Droysen affirms that no human action, expression, or thought sets out to be "historical"?their primary intentionality is to bring something about or bring it into being. There is thus an inexorable difference (Droysen does not call it an "ontological difference") between the historical vantage point and the original one of the "then-present": It does not take an especially high degree of acuity to see that human actions, at the time at which they happen and in the opinion of those through whom and for whom they happen, can hardly be said to have the aim (Absicht) and determina tion (Bestimmung) of being historical facts.11 Droysen's point here is a cardinal one: human expressions (?usserungen) do not intend or "ask" for historical treatment; it is the historian who imposes the historical treatment; it is the historian who imposes the historical perspec tive upon them. Just as Kant asserted that knowledge does not simply reflect sense-experience, so too Droysen finds that history is "another medium" of "an entirely different direction" from that in which human actions and ex pressions were originally accomplished. It is only with the active mediation of thought, imposing the categories of its own formative activity, that "Gesch?fte" are transformed into "Geschichte".12 This mediation proceeds through the forms of what Droysen calls the "moral powers." The historical material to be interpreted is not raw data, nor wholly alien to our daily humdrum experience. The doings of mankind which become history do not show the regular and predictable sameness of nature but rather development (Steigerung). "The summation of this ceaseless development is the moral world."13 Droysen's concept of the moral world is the most distinctive element in his hermeneutics of history, for he establishes it as the condition of the very possibility of human understanding. The individual historian and the individualities he studies are not isolated and foreign to each other, for they exist and develop within the en compassing ethical collectivities (sittliche Gemeinsamkeiten) of family, peo</page><page sequence="7">TRANSFORMATION OF HERMENEUTICS 181 pie, state, religion, language, and the like. The historian must view all human traces and expressions (institutions for Droysen can be "expressions") as coming to be within these overarching contexts. "The essence of interpreta tion is to see past happenings as realities (Wirklichkeiten) within the fullness of their conditions of realization."14 History is inevitably constituted from the initial vantage point of the practical present, but that does not mean that it cannot attain validity and ob jectivity. There is no such thing as a standpointless standpoint (Droysen derided "eunuchlike-objectivity") but there is relative objectivity within the ethical collectivities. The acknowledgment of this standpoint is the very op posite of arbitrary subjectivity (subjektive Willk?r), since to the extent that the inquirer recognizes his own standpoint, he can "stand high above his own self." In coming to see my own standpoint, I also come to see beyond it: "I think, so to speak, from a higher self, in which the dross of my own narrow personhood is melted off."15 Through such a process the particular self is ex panded to the "whole" of the potentially human (das allgemein Menschliche or humanitas).16 The historical consciousness provides not so much a sense of personal in dividuality but of continuity (Bewusstsein der Kontinuit?t) in the formation of the moral world. History gives a sense of belonging?though this belong ing is not to be confused with a conservative "Restauration." History es tablishes a self-conscious mediation between the self and the ethical forces and is thus a prime means of Bildung. "Ethics and histories are, so to speak, co-ordinates."17 Droysen finds no contradiction in seeing history as an empirical science but also a moral science, closely linked to practical ethics, politics, and per sonal development. The edifying Bildungs-function of history is "im measurably to broaden, to enrich, to augment the inadequate and lonely here and now of our ephemeral existence"; it is the pathway to freedom and eman cipation, in order to serve the present. So conceived, history becomes the very conscience and self-consciousness of mankind.18 Like Schleiermacher, Droysen emphasized the primary role of language in the formation of meaning, yet he too persisted in treating it as a medium for the expression of the thoughts of a subjective self: "Our language is our thought and only thinking makes us speak.... Language, mediated through the ear, is only one mode of expression in which the totality of the self (Ichsein) comes forth?although, to be sure, language is at once the most perfect and most fundamental (die vollkommenste und zugleich prim?rste) mode of expression."19 Both as the formal structure and as the content of what has been said, language inflects the human-historical world: "Language, as it is in the present or as it exists in great literature, is a living piece of</page><page sequence="8">182 MICHAEL ERMARTH history, and that means linguistically as well, that is, in its grammatical and etymological relations, as well as in its images and metaphors."20 But while Droysen gives language this primordial role and puts it first among the "ideal collectivies" (die idealen Gemeinsamkeiten), he ultimately assigns it a place alongside art, science, and religion, rather than as an all-encompassing deter minant. Wilhelm Dilthey (1833-1911) emended and extended the hermeneutic principles of Schleiermacher and Droysen, and is perhaps the most signifi cant as well as the best known representative of the 19th century hermeneutic tradition. He projected the scope and import to be assigned to hermeneutics even beyond that ascribed to it by his predecessors. Hermeneutics was not simply an adjunct of philology or historiography but intrinsically involved in all the human sciences (Geisteswissenschaften); Indeed life itself was said to be hermeneutical in nature: "understanding and interpretation are always ac tive in life itself."21 Dilthey defined Verstehen as "the process by which from signs given to sense-experience we perceive a mental coherence whose expressions they are."22 Consciousness cannot go directly "behind" life in pure reflection or introspection and must therefore proceed by way of the manifestations and expressions of life. Even more than his predecessors, Dilthey insisted that there is a special relation between our immediate awareness of being alive and the interpretive knowledge we have of these manifestations. This continuity between our ordinary "sense" of the world as given in concrete lived ex perience (Erlebnis) and the methodical cognition of the human sciences remained the armature of Dilthey's reflections. The critical foundation of the human sciences seemed to entail a "phenomenology of consciousness" or reflective anthropology which would explicate the various structures, pat terns, and categories of the human-historical world of lived experience. In this world our way of being is involved in our way of knowing: "the first con dition for the possibility of history as a science lies in the recognition that I myself an a historical being, that the one who examines history also makes history [and participates in it] ,"23 ' All understanding of whatever grade?whether immediate and elemen tary or very deliberate and refined?is what Dilthey following Goethe, called a "seeing in types." We do not experience reality either as ineffably discrete particulars or as indefinite all-encompassing universale, but rather in terms of implicit contexts and typifications. Our ordinary and on-going experience contains "silent thought," a dynamic structure of tacit expectations which are fulfilled or disconfirmed as experience proceeds. Actual experience is not the inchoate sense-data of the pure empiricists or Kantians but a structured coherence pervaded by implicit patterns of memory and expectation. The</page><page sequence="9">TRANSFORMATION OF HERMENEUTICS 183 elucidation of these structures in ordinary experience and the "life categories" evident in more reflective thinking can be refined to constitute a typology of world-views (Weltanschauungslehre), a critical branch of the human sciences concerned with different ways of conceiving the world, dif ferent modes of action, and different styles of imaginative creation. Dilthey consistently emphasized that the meanings of the human historical world are intelligible at more than one level and in more than one context. Expressions may be more or less subjective and personal or objective and impersonal. He attempted therefore to combine Schleiermacher's subjec tive, "psychological" re-experiencing with Hegel's "objective mind" and Husserl's objective content (noema) of mental intentionality. Dilthey even tually came to acknowledge two different "valences" of Verstehen: 1) the more objective, which moves towards a "what" of content (which need not necessarily be present in the mind or experience of an actual personal subject; and 2) the more subjective, which moves toward re-constituting the thoughts and experiences of a personal subject considered as an individual psy chological being. These two valences meet?and are inseparable?in language. Thus, in a manner reminiscent of Herder's dictum that man is "both creator and creature of language (Sch?pfer und Gesch?pf der Sprache)," Dilthey emphasized the constitutive role of language in the formation of "ob jective mind" and cultural meaning.24 But while he saw a special relation between the categories of life and the structures of language, he never went so far as to resolve the human sciences (or hermeneutics) into a science of language instead of a science of consciousness. Like his predecessors, Dilthey portrayed Verstehen primarily in terms of attaining something like a "co consciousness" between originating and interpreting minds. Over and above his stress upon language, objective mind and cultural content, Dilthey con tinued to appeal to human consciousness as the ultimate frame of under standing and hermeneutics. Understanding in the final analysis can be no more?nor less?than human understanding of things human; the widest arc of the interpretive circle describes a purely human horizon of "re subjectification." Hermeneutics for Dilthey, it has been said, remains "doubly subjective, since it goes from a subject to a subject."25 II Paul Ricoeur has furnished a compact summary of the movement from the 19th century "ancients" to the 20th century "moderns": Contemporary interpretation theory has moved further and further away from Dilthey's still psychologically inclined views; although he explicitly linked the no</page><page sequence="10">184 MICHAEL ERMARTH tion of text and the transition from inter-subject understanding, such as is found in dialogue, to the "interpretation of expressions of life committed to writing," Dilthey never explicitly connected the problems of comprehension with those of language. Hermeneutics has accordingly had to disengage itself from the psy chological problems of transfer into another's life, and come to grips with the more ontological problems involved in comprehending 'being-in-the-world'. Here we see the influence of the early Heidegger, the Heidegger of Sein und Zeit (1927). Here comprehension is no longer a psychological concept; it is dissociated from any idea of empathy, any perception of an alien consciousness; it is in terpreted in ontological terms as one of the components of Dasein, which is no longer a consciousness but a being in the world, a being which faces the question of being within the context of specific situations and plans, against a background of f?niteness and mortality. Thus 'depsychologized' comprehension is brought nearer the problem of language.26 The new hermeneutics has continued the widening of the interpretive cir cle beyond the exegesis of special texts (philological) and historical traces (historiological), indeed beyond any consideration of proper method and critical justification (epistemological), beyond the conditions of human ex istence (anthropological) to encompass?or at least broach upon?the "ques tion of questions," that of the Being of beings. Hermeneutics is no longer viewed as a method or technique?nor a discipline with a definite object?but is identified with philosophy, when the latter returns to its foundations in on tology. As Ricoeur states it: "The movement of generalization is accom panied by a movement of radicalization by which hermeneutics becomes not just 'general' but also 'fundamental' hermeneutics."27 The fundament, however, is no longer consciousness but language?or rather "living language." In Sein und Zeit Heidegger insisted that Verstehen is not a method or technique of inquiry but first and foremost man's way of being in the world.28 Dilthey is criticized for sharing in the 19th century bias toward methodology and epistemology, both of which mistakenly presuppose the priority of self conscious subjectivity. Hence Dilthey could not be radical enough in his frame of questioning: the concern for methodical rigor, objectivity, and validity blocked him from recognizing the deeper ontological dimension of his own project of founding the human sciences. Even though he broke with conventional positivism, he failed to overcome the residual positivism implicit in regarding hermeneutics as a mode of knowledge rather than a way of being. For Heidegger a "Grundwissenschaft" is a contradiction in terms, since the sciences cannot deal with grounds, including their own. Only think ing in the sense of genuine philosophizing can deal with foundations. The sciences do not touch upon this dimension, for "the sciences do not think."29 The forgotten question of Being is, then, prior to all scientific inquiry and epistemology; these necessarily neglect the ontological difference</page><page sequence="11">TRANSFORMATION OF HERMENEUTICS 185 between entities and the ground of entities, between beings and Being. Heidegger's philosophical turn can be said to undo that of Kant and the 19th century?indeed the whole of Western thought since Socrates?it is a turn which is also a "re-turn." It rejects the "critical" turn of mind which ar rogantly presumes that Being belongs to thinking, rather than that thinking belongs to Being. Heidegger's conception of truth concerns neither the cor rectness nor correspondence of judgments with regard to states of affairs, nor the agreement of subject and object within these assertions. Truth is not a matter of demonstration or judgment but the self-showing or unconcealment of Being. Heidegger insisted all along that^the problem of human existence was only the entry-way to the problem of Being. As much as man is destined to be concerned about his own being (Dasein), he must not lose himself or arrest his thinking in his own consciousness (Bewusstsein). Thinking about Dasein is always and already en route (unterwegs) to Sein: the analytic of Dasein, the phenomenology of consciousness, and all genuine efforts of self understanding must perforce take us toward ontology. The fateful limitation of Dilthey and the 19th century was to succumb to a Cartesian-Kantian no tion of subjective consciousness: "Dilthey's Verstehen makes the other into a duplicate of the Self."30 The turn away from all "psychologism" and "subjectivism"in Sein und Zeit was later radicalized into a turn away from all "anthropologism" and from shallow "humanism" (i.e., the "Letter on Humanism" of 1947). Truth, to be sure, comes through man, but it is not due to man, the choices he makes, and the instruments he has devised. Man is not the master or measure, but the "clearing" and horizon of Being.31 The being of things does not consist in their becoming an experience for man. The deepest meanings of art, religion, philosophy, and poetry are not man-made, nor determined by us. This applies as well to history, that region of being which hitherto had been taken to be the very self-activity and self-manifestation of man. For Heidegger history is not to be confused with "historiology," the 19th century "science of history." History is not factual but "actual"?not a "once-was" but a continuing-to-be. Dilthey's religiously-inclined friend Yorck von Wartenburg saw "the basic character of history as 'virtuality'."32 History is not an object of knowledge, not an account of factual pastness?it is a kerygmatic presence mediated through time. History is the future making the past present. This radical sense of history has little to do with the methodical and objective historiography of Droysen and Dilthey: "In the historical sciences, just as in the natural sciences, the methodology aims at representing what is fixed and stable, and at making history an object."33 Ob jective historiography, like objective natural science, reduces everything to</page><page sequence="12">186 MICHAEL ERMARTH method and measure?not in this instance mathematical, but the "ordinary" and "average." Historiography is not ? "counting" but an "accounting," not a living presence but a fixed re-presentation (dar-stellung): Nature, in being calculated in advance, and history, in being historiographically verified at past, become as it were, "set in place" (gestellt). Nature and history become the objects of a representing that explains. Such a representing counts on nature and takes account of history. Only that which becomes object in this way is?is considered to be in being.34 The "setting" of historiographical method gets in the way of truly historical being and substitutes for it; historiography is another symptom of the loss of Being. The understanding of history in Heidegger's radical sense of "virtuality" is not the account of a happening but a new experience, a "happening" in its own right: Verstehen is itself always a Geschehen. Heidegger's conception of history is, like his conception of much else, quite far from the common mean ing and usage of the term: "In order to experience this presence of history, we must free ourselves from the historiographical representation of history which continues to dominate."35 Droysen's distinction between historical knowledge and the totality of what has happened in the past is transformed into an ontological difference: Historiography is the exploration of history. But historiographical observation does not first create history itself. Everything "historiographical," everything represented and established after the manner of historiography, is historical (geschichtlich), i.e., grounded upon the destining resident in happening. But history is never necessarily historiographical.36 Not only is history in Heidegger's uncommon perspective not necessarily "historiographical," it is not necessarily defined by specifically human con cerns with specifically human affairs. Droysen's statement "only man unders tands man" is extended beyond the sphere of human being. "The history of Being is never past but stands ever before; it sustains and defines every condi tion et situation humaine"31 The "human condition" is subsidiary to and derivative of a more primary condition: "The happening of history occurs es sentially as the destiny of the truth of Being and from it."38 Heidegger is con cerned less with the understanding of history than the historicity of understanding?and what this understanding shows about Being. The conception of understanding which emerges from such premises is a far cry from the 19th century notion of Verstehen: it is much closer to Hegel's speculative philosophical recollection than Dilthey's re-experiencing. Heideg ger has re-interpreted the 19th century hermeneutic tradition within his wider rethinking of Western thought from its origins to its "end" in the loss of Be ing. What this tradition "says" (and what Heidegger takes it to mean) cannot</page><page sequence="13">TRANSFORMATION OF HERMENEUTICS 187 be resolved into what individual thinkers propounded, nor what they pro pounded of each other. Heidegger's terms are therefore not the terms of his subjects but of the subject-matter of Being. The understanding of the tradi tion is not identical with the self-understanding (or mutual understanding) of its constituents: not because they did not "know" what they were talking about, but because they "forgot" to come to speak about that which is the ground of all thinking and speaking, the Being which is presupposed in all thought and utterance. The real question for genuine thinking (and thus for genuine understanding) is not what they thought, but rather what thinking reveals itself to be through them. This understanding is therefore anything but a literal re-thinking?rather it is a fresh thinking which is always different from its derivation. Something new comes into being with every authentic act of understanding. It can come as no surprise that Heidegger's understanding of the 19th century hermeneutic tradition bears very little relation to what its represen tatives thought they were doing. Heidegger terms the 19th century "still the most obscure of all centuries of the modern age up to now,"39 but he has no doubt that it confirmed and abetted the fundamental movement of thinking from Descartes to Kant in the direction of shallow "philosophy of con sciousness." In his view, 19th century thinking proceeded far down the way towards becoming anti-metaphysical and anthropological. The humanism of the 19th century is the distillate of the whole modern consciousness and its tendency to think things ever more exclusively in terms of man's situation and the enhancement of human power, security, and self-esteem. Far from oppos ing technological manipulation, historicist humanism is the inward and backward projection of man's craving for mastery. Man has projected himself over everything at the inestimable yet imperceptible cost of the "loss of the gods" and the "loss of being." The decisive modern transformations are closely linked together: modern metaphysics has turned into "anthropology" or the self-understanding of man (whether or not one says "philosophical anthropology" makes no difference in Heidegger's estima tion); modern science has turned into empirical research, exact methodology, and machine technology; art has fallen under the purview of aesthetics and has been evacuated by technical criticism; religion has lost its object (the gods) and has been attentuated into "religious experience"; human activity as a whole has pridefully been labelled "culture," the all-embracing excuse man employs to advance his self-image and worldly projects. The anthropological abrogation embodied in 19th century hermeneutics is the culmination of man's "self-seeking" denial of Being. We now turn to consider Hans-Georg Gadamer's Wahrheit und Methode (1960) which has been called "the most substantial treatise on hermeneutic theory that has come from Germany in this century."40</page><page sequence="14">188 MICHAEL ERMARTH Gadamer insists even more emphatically than Heidegger that understanding is directed toward Being, not human being or consciousness. Truth is not the result of method; it has nothing to do with correctness or correspondence?it is the disclosure of Being. A truly philosophical hermeneutics cannot be con fined to projects such as Droysen's "histories" or Dilthey's "critique of historical reason," its scope is at once broader and deeper. "Hermeneutics is, as we have seen, a universal aspect of philosophy itself and not just the methodological basis of the so-called "humane disciplines."41 Gadamer is not concerned with grounding or validating the knowledge claims of these dis ciplines nor with refounding humanism as a world-view; instead, he wishes to explicate the experience of a level of truth which has nothing to do with the sciences or scientific method, whether natural or humane. His aim is not epistemology or methodology but the exposition of the ontological structure of all understanding as such. Gadamer reconceives hermeneutics so that it concerns not the subjec tivity of the author nor his historical situation but rather the subject-matter (Sache) and "its" language or linguisticality. He carries further Heidegger's ontological "neue Sachlichkeit"?the shift away from concern for the mental life of the putative "other" behind the text to a stringent, uncompromising concern for truth-content as such: "A text should be understood not as an ex pression of life but as that which it says."42 A hermeneutics concerned with the understanding of truth as such has an "interest" which is neither historical nor anthropological. Gadamer's philosophical hermeneutics in tends to restore to the understanding of meaning that very sense of Being and urgent truth-content which in the realm of art has been abrogated by the "aesthetic consciousness" and in the realm of history by the historical con sciousness. Aesthetics and histories have nothing to do with truth. The dominant 19th century hermeneutic tradition from Herder through Dilthey portrayed Verstehen as active re-creation and re-constitution, i.e., a psychic transposition into the "mind" of the author, not a receptivity to the "what" of his saying. For Gadamer the romantic model of understanding as Gleichsetzen is limited and superficial, even naive. "In light of the historicity of our way of being, the reproduction (Wiederherstellung), of the original conditions of a work is a futile enterprise."43 The meaning of a work is not determined or fixed by authorial intention, indeed it is the very nature of meaning to transcend the mens auctoris: "The meaning of a text goes beyond its author's understanding of it not just now and then but always. Under standing is not merely a reproductive, but also a productive activity_Suf fice it to say that one understands differently when one understands at all"44 Gadamer's most noteworthy contribution to hermeneutical theory is his doctrine of the linguisticality (Sprachlichkeit) of interpretation. He regards</page><page sequence="15">TRANSFORMATION OF HERMENEUTICS 189 the expressivist view of language characteristic of the 19th century as partak ing of the general "forgetfulness of language in Western thought" from which hermeneutics must be rescued.45 Language is not a means?not an instrument at our disposal?but the very horizon of Being: "we are always and already encompassed by the very language which is our own."46 Indeed Gadamer goes so far as to hold that "Being which can be understood is language."47 Gadamer finds a tacit practical reason (phronesis or prudentia) inherent in linguistic usage; it is the continuity of application and explication implicit in such usage which establishes the open horizon of meaning we call "tradition." This tradition is not the outcome of method or deliberate self conscious design; it is so to speak, the "cunning of language"?or as Edmund Burke might say, "wisdom without reflection." This subtle, barely noticed reason is lodged in our "prejudices," a crucial term which Gadamer is at pains to rehabilitate. We understand on the basis of pre-judgment (Vorurteilen), since prior to any comprehending there is a "pre-hending" or prior grasping, which is not the work of subjective consciousness but of the tradition of language. It was the Enlightenment's "prejudice against pre judice" (in the long-lost positive sense of pr?juges legitimes) which wound up discrediting tradition?and thereby our way of belonging to history. We do not more preside over or control tradition any more than we do language: "in truth history does not belong to us, we belong to history."48 Tradition in this sense of "operative history" (Wirkungsgeschichte) is not an object of methodical understanding but rather the universal condition of all understanding. Gadamer illustrates this "belonging" to language and tradition by means of our participation in a game (Spiel) and our "posses sion" by the work of art; the individual is taken up in a higher telos or move ment which is not self-willed or reflectively attended to. "Tradition too is a partner in communication to which we belong as much as the I to the Thou."49 Thus, Gadamer's tradition functions somewhat like Droysen's "moral powers" and Dilthey's "objective mind": it is the ground and background of all possible meaning. Tradition is immanently operative in our use of language, it is not a contrivance or method; indeed, only when one has lost the living force of tradition does one need to resort to method as a means of overcoming a perceived sense of historical difference and alienation. The "problem of historicism" arises only when thought has lost this deeper tradi tion and feels alien to the direct claim of meaning as Being-in-language. The real focus of understanding is not the self?or the self projecting itself into another self?but rather a fusion of horizons within a tradition. It is perhaps illuminating to regard Gadamer's hermeneutics as a "historicism of the third degree" following dialectically upon the first-order historicism of the 19th century and Heidegger's more radical "historicism of</page><page sequence="16">190 MICHAEL ERMARTH the second degree."50 First-degree historicism stresses the historical specificity of the object (or alien other) to be understood; second-degree historicism stressed the historicity of the concrete subject as "Dasein"; Gadamer's all-enveloping third-degree historicism goes beyond both and emphasizes the historicity of the "understanding-event" which fuses the horizons of self and other. This kerygmatic conception of understanding transcends the merely historical consciousness and restores meaning to its es sential "presentness." Gadamer's hermeneutics might be compared to Hegel's notion of philosophical reflection as a cure for the "dis-ease" of thinking. The two great "wounds" of modern thought?subjectivity and historicity?are overcome through a kind of philosophic homeopathy. Historicism cures itself with the recognition that we cannot overcome our historicity and difference from the past but must accept both as "productive" conditions of all meaning. Likewise subjectivism cures itself with the radical insight that "the self that we are does not possess itself; one could say that it happens."51 Our way of being and of understanding is fundamentally a belonging to language and tradition; with this recognition we attain the "es sential self-forgetfulness" or "I-lessness that belongs to the experience of speaking, the beholding of the art work, and the understanding of truth."52 Ill The development of hermeneutics through the 19th and 20th centuries can be said to constitute a tradition or "Sinnkontinuit?t" in Gadamer's sense. It represents a set of common questions handed down, a partial fusion of horizons, and an interplay of understanding and misunderstanding. In three key assumptions the radicalization of the moderns constitutes a rupture with the ancients. These concern the role of man, of historical consciousness, and of method in hermeneutics. Since these three topics were closely linked in the older tradition, the ruptures too have the effect of a cumulative displacement. The first break concerns the "man-centeredness" of Verstehen. The an cients saw hermeneutics primarily m terms of human experience, human pur pose, and the "generically human." Whether called the "moral world" or "lived world," the horizon of meanings was circumscribed as the "Menschenwelt" in which, as Dilthey put it, "life encompasses life." The older hermeneutics rested upon what Heidegger called "humanistic transference"?the reenactive appropriation of human meanings by human consciousness. Verstehen is empathie transposition of "I and Thou"?from one consciousness to another consciousness, from one form of life to another form of life (though not necessarily implying approval or emulation). The new hermeneutics re-interprets the old as arrant "anthropologism" in which</page><page sequence="17">TRANSFORMATION OF HERMENEUTICS 191 "man, expelled from the truth of Being, everywhere circles round himself as the animal rationale"5* The moderns reverse the humanistic transference with a kind of superhuman Nietzschean movement of man beyond himself (and his terms) in order to (re)cognize something allegedly more primordial than man and his projects. Whereas the ancients saw hermeneutics as the way toward the ^//-understanding of man, the moderns see it as the way toward recovering what is usually foreclosed, forgotten, and forsaken in man's understanding of the world. But exhortations alone will not move thinking beyond the circle of "anthropologism," of man circling round himself. If, as Goethe said, thinking does not know how anthropomorphic it is, inveighing against humanism will not thereby free thinking from its natural root. The second break concerns historical consciousness. The ancients regarded history as the very self-consciousness of man, whereas the moderns have renounced this man-centered historicism for a supposedly more fun damental ontology of historicity mediated through language. Ont?logical or philosophical hermeneutics is not concerned with knowing history or the "past" in any ordinary sense, but rather with understanding what might be termed "ontological precedence"?the presence of the past (or the past which persists) in linguistic usage or assumptions op?rant in language. The moderns, perhaps reflecting a more drastic contemporary sense of rupture with the past, are concerned not with understanding past meanings, but meanings still binding and belonging in the form of tradition. The new hermeneutics claims to transcend mere "histories"?concerning itself not with mere intellectual history or "the illustrative history of past opinions," but rather with "the history of Being to which thinking belongs as a recollec tion of this history that unfolds itself. Such recollective thought differs essen tially from the subsequent presentation of history in the sense of an evanes cent past."54 This kind of understanding is not cognitive but devotional: "Thinking holds to the coming of what has been, and is remerribrance."55 Such thinking supplants the older historical consciousness with a fresh new consciousness of language. Both Heidegger and Gadamer set about amending man's forgetfulness of language (or Being-in-language). Their exhortation to think deeply and devoutly upon this forgotten dimension, however, comes up against a paradox, since both insist that "the more language is a living opera tion, the less we are aware of it."56 How does one remember the living language which speaks through us, without being aware of it? The third discontinuity concerns method. The 19th century regarded hermeneutics as knowledge, to be included among the sciences (albeit as Geisteswissenschaften) and under an expanded conception of reason. If hermeneutical Verstehen was acknowledged as "practical-moral" or "ex istential," it was also epistemic, critical, and methodical?and therefore com</page><page sequence="18">192 MICHAEL ERMARTH mitted to objectivity and validity. The moderns regard hermeneutics not as knowledge but as a new philosophy in its own right. It may be that methods always imply metaphysics (and that the metaphysics of many modern thinkers often seems to consist in denying that they have any); but such an as sertion is of a different order from claiming that hermeneutics will light the way (or the horizon) to the old promised land of metaphysics, even if renamed the "language of Being." For the moderns, method is not the way to truth but rather the shadow of man which darkens the way to truth?or to coin along with Heidegger?method can be said to be man "getting [it] in his own way instead of in the way of Being." We self-conscious and method conscious moderns are "too late for the gods and too early for Being," since we always already know the terms in which things must appear in order to qualify as known. But hermeneutics without method is at least as con founding a notion as method without metaphysics. If anti-metaphysics is still a metaphysics, then being "against method" is still a method. It would be gratifying to concur with the judgment that the moderns' position represents an advance or constructive departure over and beyond the ancients. But owing to their own position, the grounds for such a judgment are denied from the start: the moderns are not better, just different. This dif ference stems in part from different assumptions, but also a kind of deliberately arbitrary (mis-)reading of the past. The moderns' understanding of the 19th century ancients is aptly characterized by Heidegger's resigned comment upon his own critics: "These misinterpretations are natural reinterpretations of what one has read, or else simply mirrorings of what one believes he knows already before he reads."57 Michael Ermarth Department of History Dartmouth College NOTES 1.

Schleiermacher can hardly be accused of a cavalier psy chologism, which restricts meaning to connections among the thoughts of a subject, while neglecting the distinction between language and discourse. In fact in the Hermeneutik of 1819 he distinguished two crucial dimensions or "sides" of textual in terpretation: 1) the grammatical side, which concerns the coherence and meaning of the text at the level of linguistic relations; and 2) the psychological side, which con cerns the grasp of the mind-set (Gesinnung) of the author. He specifically rejected the subordination of the grammatical to the psychological: "Both sides are entirely equal to each other and one is wrong to say that the grammatical interpretation is the lower and the psychological the higher." One form takes precedence over the other only for certain purposes: The psychological interpretation is the higherv if one takes language only as the means whereby the individual person communicates his thoughts; the grammatical in this case serves merely to eliminate preliminary difficulties in grasping the thoughts of the person. The grammatical interpretation is the higher if one takes the individual person to be a place [Ort] for the language and speech?a place wherein the language discloses itself. Then the psychological interpretation is fully subordinated, as, indeed, is the existence of the in dividual person, (p. 81). Schleiermacher expressly referred to the "life of language" as distinct from the life of the author and saw the latter as the "product" of the former when the author operates under the "potency and power of language."
