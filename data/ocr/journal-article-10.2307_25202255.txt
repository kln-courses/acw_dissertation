<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION By H. G. Quaritch Wales The cosmological aspect of religion, and the application of cosmic symbolism to religious architecture and social organization, were discovered relatively late, so that the attention rightly directed to the subject in recent years has engendered a tendency to over estimate its importance in Asian thought. Fortunately this has not escaped the notice of critics. The cosmological aspect of the ziggurat is now recognized to have been secondary.1 Further, with regard to Indian culture, Prof. A. L. Basham has uttered this timely warning : " It is hardly likely that the complex cosmic symbolism of the Vedic sacrifices was elaborated until long after the sacrifices themselves came into being. Similarly the cosmic symbolism of the Hindu temple seems to us to be a comparatively late and artificial growth, of far less significance than some authori ties are inclined to attribute to it. The symbolism seems to have been somewhat esoteric, the preserve of schools of learned men who specialized in trying to explain every aspect of life by this means. We believe that for the early Indian man in the street it was of far less significance than might be believed from the emphasis which some modern students place upon it." 2 In the present article I shall try to redress the balance in the case of certain non-Islamized peoples of Indonesia, an undertaking which in view of some recent publications seems to be needed. The Ngadju Dayaks form the largest population group of South Borneo. On the basis of the first-hand studies of Hardeland,3 much of whose material has been conveniently summarized by Kruyt,4 and has been supported by later workers, it appeared that we possessed, before it was too late, a comprehensive, if by no means exhaustive, knowledge of Ngadju Dayak religion. At any rate there seemed to be no doubt as to its general character, in 1 Andr? Parrot, Ziggurats et Tour de Babel, Paris, 1949, pp. 204, 214. 2 Prof. A. L. Basham, JRAS., 1958, p. 96, in review of J. Auboyer, La Vie Publique et Priv?e dans VInde Ancienne, Fase, vi, Paris, 1955. 3 A.

Largely an otiose god, he could be approached in case of dire need, but only after every effort had been made to enlist the help of the sangiangs, these being active atmospheric-gods and helper-spirits. The cult is shamanism, in the strict sense. The shamans, both male and female, who have undergone an initiation, call their helper-spirits, who do not " possess " the shamans, nor is there " possession " by ancestors. The shamans communicate with their helper-spirits in a special language, and when in trance, journey in the sangiangs' boats to recover the souls of sick persons, or to accompany the souls of the dead at the tiwah feast to the afterworld, which at least for the upper class was in the sky. Tempon Telon, the chief sangiang, acts as psychopomp on these occasions. The Cosmic Tree, used in s?ances, and at the Feast of the Dead, and shown on representations of the shaman's boats, has been recognized as having the same function as the Siberian shaman's Cosmic Tree, the axis by which they go in spirit to the sky. That strict shamanism, together with the recognition of a supreme sky deity, not of course unmixed with animism and ancestor worship, characterizes the Ngadju Dayak religion, receives support from the fact that the same religion has been established by careful observers as characteristic of certain other Dayak peoples, notably the Ot Danum and Manyan Dayaks, close neighbours of the Ngadjus, and also the Sea Dayaks of Sarawak.1 Furthermore Kruyt's thorough investigations of the East Torajas of Celebes,2 suggest that, before the coming of Indian influences, shamanism closely comparable to the Siberian and Central Asian model must have been widespread in South-East Asia. Noticing how greatly this religion differs from that of the Neolithic period in the region, I came to the conclusion that this shamanism and the cult of sky deities is likely to have been brought in with the Bronze Age (Dongson) culture.3 1 Archdeacon J. Perham, in H. Ling Roth, The Natives of Sarawak and British North Borneo, London, 1896, vol. i ; That the Sea Dayaks practise strict shamanism, the manangs never being possessed by spirits, is confirmed by their latest investi gator, Dr. J. D. Freeman, in a private letter to me dated 10th November, 1958. 2 N. Adriani and Alb. C. Kruyt, De Bare'e sprekende Toradjas van Midden Celebes (de Oost Toradjas), Amsterdam, 1951. 3 H. G.

III.</page><page sequence="3">102 THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION With the characterization of Ngadju Dayak religion above out lined, the late Dr. H. Sch?rer's Die Gottesidee der Ngadju Dajak in S?d-Borneo (Leiden, 1946), does not at first sight seem easily reconcilable. True the title suggests that the work is limited to the " conception of God ", but the author insists (pp. 6-8) that this is the central theme on which the understanding of Ngadju Dayak religion depends. Again, the author acknowledges the existence of a popular religion (" Volksreligion "), presumably that which has been established by previous investigators, though this is not explicitly stated, but we are told that this popular religion would give us only a superficial view. We must probe beneath, he says, to get the full meaning. We must study the quite separate theological system which is to-day unknown to the laity and also to many priests. Only thus shall we gain an understanding of the central theme, the conception of God, which runs as a red thread through the whole culture and religion. So the author leaves no room for doubt as to the prior importance he attaches to this " Gottesidee ". This attitude is definitely recognized by J. A. J. Verheijen when he says : " It is my inten tion?in contrast to Dr. H. Sch?rer in his Die Gottesidee . . .?to give a picture of the present-day Manggerai [West Flores] belief concerning the Supreme Being, and especially as it lives with ' the plain man of the street '." 1 Important Sch?rer's work certainly is, though not exactly in the way he supposed. And incidentally his intensive study brought to light or clarified some points on the popular religion. It was in connection with these that I made a few references to his book in my recent Prehistory and Religion in South-East Asia. To deal with his whole theme there I realized would have involved too great a digression ; it had to be postponed for consideration as part of another study. In undertaking this now I must begin with a summary of Sch?rer's work and con clusions. This will provide the material on which to base a critical analysis. The author first makes known his opinions as to the theories of primitive religion in general (pp. 4-6) : He is opposed to evolu tionism, remarking that the phenomena called animistic occur in all religions. They should not be considered in isolation, but rather are understandable as parts of a whole, in the light of the central 1 J. A. J. Verheijen, S.V.D., Het Hoogste Wezen bij de Manggaraiers, Vienna, 1951, p. 4.</page><page sequence="4">THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION 103 theme of primitive religion. He denies that the Ngadju Dayak Supreme Being is otiose, and at the same time he rejects " original monotheism ". The reasons for his views emerge clearly enough as we proceed. His sources are the myths and priestly songs, in the special priestly language, and also the (adat, or divine law, which is in ordinary language. We must follow the author in using the words " priest " and " priestly " in this summary, for there is no mention of shamanism. The names of the chief deities are then discussed (pp. 15-18). There were always two of these, so no question of " monotheism " arises. There is the God of the Upperworld, whose indigenous name is Tingang = Hornbill, also known as Prince of the Sun. Mahatala, which we may use here for convenience, is a Hindu adoption from Majapahit times, but implies no foreign influence beyond the name. The Deity of the Underworld has the indigenous name of Tambon = Watersnake or Naga, and the Hinduized name of Jata, which we shall employ here. Mahatala lives on the primeval mountain in the sky (p. 19), reached through forty-two cloud layers, and the Upperworld is an image of this one, only much better. Jata lives in the Underworld, or primeval water, under man's world (p. 20). The entrance is near villages at the deep junctions of streams, and the deity's village is on the Underworld river. But in the Creation Myth the homes of the two deities are not considered as geographically separate : they are both placed in the Upperworld, one on a Jewel Mountain, the other on a Gold Mountain. They are there considered more as one deity than as a duality. This brings us directly to the conception of the Godhead (p. 21). Mahatala and Jata are two distinct deities, and on many occasions are invoked as such, but are then immediately treated as a unity. This is very clearly shown in the Creation Myth ; also in rites where they are referred to as " The Naga who is united with the Hornbill, the Naga who is also the Hornbill ". Also the phrase " King of the Sun, King of the World " shows this unity. It is significant not only for the religion, but also for the whole culture, which in every way shows both totality and ambivalence. The Total Godhead [or High God] is Naga and Hornbill, Upper- and Underworld, man and woman, good and bad, life and death, war and peace, health and sickness, etc. Similarly the Cosmos shows ambivalence : sun and moon, upperworld and underworld, etc. In the social organiza</page><page sequence="5">104 THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION tion there are two groups, as we shall see. This conception of the total/ambivalent Godhead is the leitmotif of Sch?rer's book, at the end of which he offers an explanation as to what this Total Godhead is. Here at the outset he insists that this unity has not evolved from a duality, for the sources indicate that the unity was always a duality, and vice versa. Beneath Mahatala and Jata are various good and bad spirits, of which the more important are five in number (pp. 22-6). They are not independent, but are representatives, or rather personified aspects, of the two chief deities. Some are associated with Mahatala, who is good and the creator, and some with Jata who is bad and the destroyer. Yet just as the deities are ambivalent, so each of the higher spirits can bring mankind both good and evil. The high spirits show the unity of good and bad, life and death, etc., which are associated with both the deities. At the same time there is an antagonism between them which shows itself clearly in the Creation Myth and in social life. The two deities are not represented as anthropomorphic (pp. 27-8) but as the symbolical animals, Hornbill and Naga. These are depicted as forming a totality with the Cosmic Tree on the sanggaran post erected at the Feast of the Dead (tiwah). Only the high spirits are anthropomorphic. The deities' homes are represented by a stone or stepped pyramid for the primeval mountain, and by a coconut shell for the primeval water. Mahatala's emblem is a lance, Jata's is a cloth. The most important myth, at any rate from Sch?rer's point of view, is the Creation Myth. It is long and complicated and was known only imperfectly before his publication (Ch. 6). He gives a full translation, as well as a summary and analysis, of which I shall try to reproduce the essentials. Before the creation there were only the two mountains, the Gold Mountain and the Jewel Mountain, seats of the chief deities. These mountains came together six times, making each time the clouds, sun, and moon, etc., and on the seventh occasion Mahatala's gold head-dress. That ended the first period of creation. Then Mahatala and Jata made the hills and rivers of the Upper- and Underworlds. That closed the second period. There were as yet no men or any world for them to five on. Mahatala then started the third period of creation. He raised his head-dress and out of it issued the Tree of Life with gold leaves and ivory fruit. Now Jata manifested</page><page sequence="6">THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION 105 as a female hornbill and Mahatala as a male one. She saw the Tree in the distance, flew to it and began to eat its fruit and buds. The male bird also flew to it and began to eat the moss on it, but when he saw that the female was eating the fruit he was overcome with envy. A fight broke out between them. The male hornbill broke off the buds and fruit and they changed into a gold boat. The knots were cut off by the female bird, and from them issued a young woman. She got into the gold boat and floated on the primeval ocean. The strife between the birds, that is to say between Mahatala and Jata, continued, and from bits of the Tree the rivers and lakes of the Upperworld were formed. From the stump of the Tree, all that was left of it, issued the jewel boat, also floating on the primeval ocean. The male bird now cut the female bird's throat and from it there fell moss, from which a young man issued. He got into the jewel boat. Soon the two boats met. The young man saw the young woman and his heart yearned for her. She agreed to marry him, but not until he could provide a home for her on dry land. They remained in their boats and the young man grieved because there was nowhere to land. Mahatala saw the trouble and created an island, supported by the Naga who, as Jata, had planted padi. The two birds con tinued to fight until they were both killed and their bodies became rivers. The young man, seeing the island, was pleased because the young woman could no longer refuse to marry him. However, she demanded a house first. Again seeing the difficulty, Mahatala let seven gold planks fall on the island from which Jata built a house. The couple married and lived in the house, naming their village Batu Nindan Tarong. They had three sons : Maharaja Sangiang, Maharaja Sangen, and Maharaja Buno. As a result of a quarrel these separated. Maharaja Sangen remained in the original village, his descendants including the sangiangs and other good and bad spirits, representatives of the ambivalent total Godhead. Maharaja Sangiang settled on the Sangiang River in the Upperworld, as ancestor of men in the Upperworld, and Maharaja Buno settled in our world as ancestor of men here. Evidently Maharaja Sangiang represents the upper class of men, Maharaja Buno the lower class. Maharaja Sangen's village is not only the original village, but the totality of all villages, and he is the Total Godhead and Society, and is also ambivalent. Man comes from the Godhead, lives in the Godhead, is the Godhead, or an aspect of it (p. 43).</page><page sequence="7">106 THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION Sch?rer notes (p. 36) that Jata's part in the creation is important but subsidiary, she being regarded as the sister or wife of Mahatala. The emphasis is on Totality as the creating Godhead, symbolized by the Tree and by Mahatala's head-dress. The author illustrates two representations of the Tree expressive of this Totality ; and one of them shows children falling from it to the tribal parents standing below. In the Totality the Hornbill is also the Naga, and vice versa. In the cult this ambivalence also appears (p. 39) when the Hornbill is shown with the scales of a Naga, and the Naga with feathers. The Tree is the total/ambivalent Godhead or Cosmos. The creation is the holy fight between Mahatala and Jata, in which they destroy the Tree and so also themselves. But from the destruc tion and death the Cosmos and new life are born : the creation arises from the dead Totality. This sacred fight is found throughout the religious life, in birth, initiation, wedding, and death, as well as in the legal procedure. The new creation and new men arise from destruction and death. Just as children are depicted on one Tree representation, preserved in the Leiden Museum, as falling from its branches, so the Ngadju Dayaks are the descendants of the Tree of the Total Godhead. They live in accordance with the holy order. We can go a step further, says Sch?rer : " The people are the total deity itself, and they show in their totality and structure the conception of the deity and its ambivalence. The people are also the Cosmos and consequently show the cosmic dualism " (p. 44). The Ngadjus no longer have a tribal organization, this having broken down long ago, but there is evidence of its former existence. Thus there are separate groups, which once formed such an organization and still figure on important religious occasions, especially the tiwah. These are as follows (Ch. 7) :? A. The upper or rich group : Its members are always spoken of respectfully in the myths. They are good and beautiful, not only physically but also morally. Their position is partly derived from birth, partly from initiation. They possess the godly gifts and maintain world harmony. They are rich and have the leading places in the community. They are brave, and physically and mentally well-adjusted. Their children are brought up for this status, which can be lost by marriage to the lower group, or by bad behaviour. This involves not only social but also religious degrada tion. They are the Sun Men, associated cosmically with the Sun,</page><page sequence="8">THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION 107 and they represent Mahatala and the Upperworld. This upper group is an aspect of the Total Community, and of the Total God head, the Upperworld aspect. They can be considered as identical with the mythological group of Maharaja Buno, who is the reflection of one group of the Total Community.1 B. The lower or poor group : These are the freemen, as they are called in the sources. They are known by names which show them to be considered ugly and morally bad. In the mythology their blood is considered different, and they have only a part of the holy gifts. This distinction causes rivalry and mistrust. They are poor, but there are many exceptions who, however, lack the " real " wealth, the most valuable gongs and holy vessels. They are discriminated against in law. They usually live below the village, a cosmic distinction. They are the agricultural workers and must do much for the rich group. Some of them become priests. They are the Moon or Naga men, clearly associated with the Underworld, and probably with the mythological group of Maharaja Sangiang. There is further a group of slaves, perhaps of relatively recent origin, and also a group of outcast practitioners of black magic, to neither of which need we devote attention, since they have no social or religious status. However, the slave group now produces many of the priests, an important group requiring our careful consideration. The priestly group consists of priestesses (balian) and priests (basir). " They are links between men and gods and also between the mythical groups of Maharaja Buno and Maharaja Sangiang. They take part in all the big religious rites of the whole community, though belonging to neither group. In the Upperworld they have their own village of the dead " (p. 64). The basir s are hermaphro dites. They are called to their profession by the sangiangs. " Cosmically classified they stand between the Upperworld and the Underworld. Further they are Upperworld and Underworld together, Mahatala and Jata, Maharaja Buno and Maharaja Sangiang. They are the total/ambivalent Godhead and represent this Totality in the community. In ritual they are referred to in the priestly songs as ' the Naga who is also the Hornbill ', showing 1 In this and the next paragraph the roles of Maharaja Buno and M. Sangiang seem to have been erroneously transposed, since it has been previously stated that M. Sangiang was associated with the Upperworld group. Cf. Sch?rer's statements on pp. 39 and 43, also text of Myth, p. 218.</page><page sequence="9">108 THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION that they represent and are the bisexual Godhead and Total Community " (p. 66). Their sacred prostitution on ceremonial occasions does not show a loosening of custom, but a return of the universe and of the whole community into the Cosmic Tree. The priestly group's totality represents the mythical group of Maharaja Sangen who dwelt in the original village between his two brothers' villages. And in intercourse with the Godhead and sangiangs they go back to the original village. " The people can in their being, their existence, and their social structure only be understood through the conception of God. They are grounded in the Total Godhead. They are the reflection of this ambivalent and bisexual Godhead. Their social, economic, ethico/ religious, and cosmic aspects represent the different groups which, at a time when the tribal organization was not yet weakened, probably were different phratries (hornbill, naga) and different clans. In their totality the holy people are the holy, total, and ambivalent Godhead " (p. 67). The true home of man is regarded as being the original village Batu Nindan Tarong, where the three mythical groups lived in the care of the Godhead, and to die is to go back there. But now they are in this world and the tribal organization is lost, while its centre is just the local village. However, this village is regarded as the centre of the whole divine cosmic order and represents the social and cosmic totality. At the same time there is a dualism in the village, the upper and lower sections, inhabited by the two groups. At feasts the priest sounds the gong first up-stream and then down-stream, following the sun. " The holy land is the land of the Total Godhead. It was not only created and maintained by the deity, it is the Godhead itself and represents the totality of Upperworld and Underworld, of Mahatala and Jata. Man lives not only in the divine land, not only in the peace of the Godhead, he lives actually in the Godhead, for the holy land is a part of the Tree, it was created from Sun and Moon, which flank the Tree, and which issued from the Gold and Jewel Mountains, also from the Total Godhead " (p. 76). The theological interpretation of the dwelling-house, states Sch?rer, applies in the first instance to the houses shown on the sacred drawings, but must also apply to the ordinary houses. On these religious drawings there are always two houses, one standing on each side of the sacred Tree, which forms the mid-point of the</page><page sequence="10">THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION 109 village. These houses differ architecturally, but we need only mention the chief differences : The roof of one of them is crowned by an umbrella, with a cock on one side and a hen on the other, while its upturned eaves represent hornbills' heads. The house is shown over the earth, with its pigs and oxen, carried on the back of a naga. The house is divided into a higher level room and a lower verandah. The roof represents the primeval mountain, on which Mahatala is enthroned as the umbrella = Cosmic Tree. The cock and hen represent the two hornbills on the Tree. Thus the house is the Tree and therefore the total/ambivalent Godhead. Its division into room and verandah shows its totality and ambi valence. However, this kind of house represents the Upperworld aspect of Totality. The second kind of house has a vaulted roof which represents the Naga, ending with head and tail. It is crowned with a flag representing the total cosmos, but various details, such as fish and open net beside it, show that the house is intended to represent the Underworld aspect. Thus the houses on the sacred drawings are not two ordinary houses, but are each an aspect of the house in its godly/cosmic totality. The adat is the divine order or harmony, comparable to Chinese Tao or Vedic Rita, which having been given at the creation is known as the Creation Order. The Ngadju Dayak is brought up to live in accordance with it, for it is by living in harmony with the divine order that brings human welfare. In the songs and myths the man is known as hornbill or falcon and is compared with the sun. Cosmically and totemically, states Sch?rer, he belongs to Mahatala and evinces the aspect of the Tree associated with him. Lance and dagger connected with the Tree are (according to Sch?rer) the totem-emblems of Mahatala and of the social group associated with him. So they are also of man and this means that man is lance and dagger, and also that he is hornbill and the sun. It further means that he is the Tree in its Mahatala aspect, for in lance, dagger, hornbill, and the sun he unites himself in the Tree with Jata as ambivalent Totality. Woman, on the other hand, is known as naga or moon. She is the Tree in its Jata aspect, and also is Jata herself, for she bears her names and emblems, such as the holy cloth. " Man and woman are not only two different aspects of the Tree, they are also the two deities and therein lies their divinity and holiness. They are not only two aspects but also the Totality, for man and woman are</page><page sequence="11">110 THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION not only the products of the total/ambivalent Godhead, but also of Total Society. They were produced from the representatives of both groups, who on one side are associated and identical with the Upperworld and Mahatala, and on the other side with the Underworld and Jata. . . . Their totality and ambivalence plays an important part at death and the Feast of the Dead, and especially in the guidance of the dead to the village of the dead. Since man represents Totality, both social groups are concerned in getting him to his destination. The Naga group bears the body, for body comes from the primeval water, while the Hornbill group brings the soul to the village of the dead, since the soul comes from the Upper world. Generally the sangiang Tempon Telon does the guiding. He is the total Godhead and total Society in his function of soul guide. The transport of the two parts of the dead is done on two different boats, the Hornbill boat and the Naga boat, or on one boat which, with its hornbill and naga heads, shows it is the totality of the two boats. So goes man as the Total Godhead back into the Total Godhead " (pp. 88 f.). At all the transitions, marked by birth, initiation, marriage, and death the creation drama is re-enacted, as will be considered later. Here we note the following points : The time for weddings is the two months " between the years ". Before a wedding the couple ritually die by bathing in the river in which in former times there was mixed the blood of a slave sacrificed as their substitute. At the wedding ceremony they clasp a representation of the Cosmic Tree to indicate their union with it prior to issuing from it to begin a new life. The marriage is the repetition of the creation of the first human pair from the Tree, and in their union they are also the Total Godhead. Birth is represented as coming from the Tree. The custom of couvade is explained by the belief that the couple together bear the child. The birth room is the primeval ocean, from which comes new life. At initiation rites the holy bath signifies going back into the Godhead whence life is renewed. The boat taking the young person to the ritual bath has the form of a naga. Tattooing a young man with the Tree indicates oneness with the godly/cosmic Totality of the Tree, and so also with the Godhead. The most important stage of life is death, for it represents not the loss of life but the return to the divine world and the social and divine oneness of the mythical primeval time. It is the entry upon a new and true existence. " The coffin has the form of a boat.</page><page sequence="12">THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION 111 But it is not only a boat, and it serves not primarily for the journey of the dead to the village of the dead, and the journey over seas and rivers. We do not find the explanation there. The coffin is not only a boat, it is also Hornbill and Naga. The Hornbill coffin is appointed for dead women, the Naga coffin for dead men [sic]. The sides of the boat are decorated with a painted or incised liana, representing and called the Tree of Life. The whole coffin is orna mented with coloured points, which represent gold and jewels and have the same meaning as the gold and jewel mountains of the mythical primeval time. With the coffin are the totem emblems : for a woman a cloth, for a man the blowpipe and sword. What particularly does the coffin signify ? It is Boat, Tree, Godhead, and primeval mountain. It represents, one may say, the Creation Myth. The two boats are identical with the two boats in which the first couple floated on the water of life. They have the same names. They are also identical with the Tree (liana), for they issue from it and are also the Tree itself. They are also the Godhead, for the total Godhead is indeed the Tree. Lastly they are also identical with the two primeval mountains, whose coming together produced the head-dress of Mahatala, out of which issued the Tree. The coffin is the cosmic/divine Totality of the primeval time ..." (p. 105). " The coffins and other important matters show us clearly that the dead fall into two categories, one associated with the Upper world and the other with the Underworld. This division cannot, as we have already seen, be only on a sexual basis, but must connect with the divine and social division. We cannot speak only of woman's and man's coffins, for the two kinds must earlier have belonged to the two groups, one of which was connected with the Upperworld and used the hornbill, and the other with the Under world and used the naga. This agrees with the fact that in the myths the dead of the Upperworld group change into mythical falcons and those of the Underworld group into mythical snakes " (p. 106). This is supported by the aerial burial of the upper group and the ground burial of the lower group members. " Despite this division, which also plays an important part during the conveying of the deceased at the Feast of the Dead, the oneness is much more stressed to-day. The dead go back into the mythical primeval time, into the godly Totality, and into the original village Batu Nindan Tarong " (p. 107). The holy year, which is also a world period, ends with the harvest. 10 JKAS. OCTOBER 1959</page><page sequence="13">112 THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION Then follow the two months known as the " time between the years ". Some weeks are then devoted to the Harvest or New Year Festival. It has a deeper meaning than is thus implied ; it is the end of a creation period, when man not only goes back from the fields into the village, but also goes back into the mythical primeval time and to the beginning of being. He goes back into the Tree and divine Totality and lives in it. At the great festival, after the end of the world period, or old year, the creation is repeated and the whole Cosmos renewed. " Man is during this time the ambivalent Godhead and ambivalent Tree, and man remains so until the repetition of the creation, the renewal of the world, until the division of the groups out of the Tree and the renewal of the whole worldly, cosmic/ divine and social order " (p. 109). At the high point of the feast there takes place the sexual orgy, which is no breach of adat, no return to " primitive promiscuity ", but the union of Upperworld and Underworld, of Mahatala and Jata, in personal and sexual wholeness and oneness. Sch?rer then devotes considerable space (twenty-four pages) to recognition of the same divine concepts in the administration of justice. In addition to noting the prior importance of Mahatala (p. 115), who visits his displeasure on the village by sending bad weather (p. 112), we need mention only the following points from the author's conclusions (pp. 134 f.) : Divine judgment concerns the whole society, though the group representing the Upperworld is undoubtedly to the fore. Here also there must be a re-enacting of the sacred events, since the restoration of harmony disturbed by a breach of adat is possible only through the repetition of the creation and the renewal of the whole Cosmos. In the two groups opposed in the law case the whole community is concerned, and the judges are the representatives of the Total Godhead. A gong is placed between the contending groups and the holy lance is erected which as at the marriage ceremony represents the Cosmic Tree. The opposing groups are identical with the two birds on the Tree, and their fight is a repetition of the struggle between the two birds. Valuable goods are destroyed. The most important part of the proceedings is a wordy battle, waged with passion, in which the grossest abuse is not lacking. Victory is deemed to go to the side that makes the most telling speeches (p. 114). This holy conflict ends with self-destruction, that is to say the killing of the guilty or of a sacrificial slave, in either case a substitute for the</page><page sequence="14">THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION 113 total community. The conflict is thus ended and the creation repeated, since out of the struggle comes not nothing or chaos, but the Cosmos. Harmony is restored, and man can now begin a new life as a new man in a new Cosmos and a new Society. The legal procedure can only be understood in relation to the primeval events and the creative activities of the Total Godhead, for it is their repetition and dramatization. We need not dwell on the next section (Ch. 9) in which the author shows how a man enjoys health so long as he lives in harmony with the Total Godhead, how certain talismans are the gift of Jata, others of Mahatala. Also, since the Godhead is not only good but also evil, certain aspects of the Godhead, personified by evil spirits, bring sickness, but they can also bring a return to health. More illuminating is the next chapter, " The holy service," for it brings us really to the kernel of the whole study. This holy service is nothing less than the repetition and dramatiza tion of the primeval sacred events. It can be performed to cure a sick person, for the expulsion of evil, but most fully when the whole Cosmos has been destroyed and the creation has to be repeated on a full scale. This is at the year's end, after a serious sin, or following the death of a freeman. The service described in detail by the author is in connection with the Feast of the Dead (tiwah). When a free Dayak dies he goes back to the Upperworld, and the cosmic order is destroyed. Destruction and death lie like a fog over the world. Man goes in darkness, for the eyes of God are no longer upon him ; the approaches to Upperworld and Underworld, to gods and ancestors, are closed. Life is uncertain and any false step can bring death. No ordinary work is done, only the collection of the necessary offerings. This done, the freeing from the evil can be undertaken. The time has come when the Naga emerges from the primeval water, and Mahatala looks down from the primeval mountain and contemplates the Tree. " The Tree bears fruit, for it is primeval time, creation time, and the gods now reign. The Hornbills spread their wings and await only the invitation, the rising incense and the beat of drum and gong. The community chooses one of the elders to open the festival, invite the priests and priestesses who will lead the holy service and carry out all the rites. Messengers having been sent to them, they arrive singing and shouting in richly decorated boats. They land at the village plaza and begin to beat the drums. They first</page><page sequence="15">114 THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION bend earthwards and the sound goes to the Underworld. Then they move in a circle, beating their drums, first to sunset, then down-river, then up-river, and lastly to sunrise. After they have called Jata, they move from sunset to sunrise, from sickness to health, from death to life. The whole Cosmos, which has been called by the priests to take part in the service, closes in to co-operate " (pp. 148 f.). What has been said about these balian and basir will be recalled, how they represent and are the total community of mythical times and the Total Godhead. They must be summoned by the sangiangs to their profession, proof of such call being that they have had a psychopathic disturbance. Their significance is based not on their own power, but entirely on their having been called by the sangiangs. Without this, neither knowledge of the lore nor drumming to produce ecstasy would be of any avail. " At the beginning of the rites the sangiangs incorporate themselves in balian and basir, for the holy service is not a matter of man but of the Godhead, for whom man serves only as tool and appearance form. The chief sangiang, representative of the Total Godhead, enters the chief balian and his helper enters the assistant balian " (p. 151). Three, five, seven, or more may take part. The entry of the sangiangs into the balian and basir is referred to as their embarking on their bandong boats, the officiants being likened to boats and also regarded as the wives of the sangiangs. The repre sentations of the sangiangs' boats show them as hornbill or naga boats, or as a combination of the two. " During the holy service the head balian represents the total creator Godhead and functions as such. She wears the sacred head-dress out of which the Tree of Life issued, and girds the dagger out of which came the male horn bill. Through these emblems and through the incorporation of the Godhead she herself is the Godhead. During the holy service she uses with her assistants the language of primeval times, spoken by the Godhead and the sangiangs " (p. 152). It is to be understood that in earlier times the whole tribe took part, or at least its chief representatives, but now only the neigh bouring villages. They form the two ritual groups, Naga and Hornbill, which act as a Totality, being known as the Hornbill who is also the Naga. They represent the social, religious, and cosmic Totality, and have the emblems as well as the names of the Total Godhead. Those invited come in richly decorated boats,</page><page sequence="16">THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION 115 loaded with food and other contributions to the feast. Some wear masks to represent the ancestors, so that the whole community, living and dead, take part. As these guest boats draw near, the villagers' boats, manned with masked men, put off. After a mock fight, during which they seize the masks of the opposing party, they return, and the guests can land. Behind a series of barricades at the entrance to the village a symbolical Tree has been erected. At each barricade valuable objects, such as cloth, gongs, holy vessels, etc. symbolizing the Tree's fruit, are heaped up. An elder from among the guests, armed with a sword, advances to the barricades, is ritually sprinkled with cock's blood, and proceeds seemingly or actually to destroy the collected valuables. Then the Tree itself is destroyed, and the two hornbills must now die. This final act was symbolized by the sacrifice of a slave, representing the Total Community. Thus is the creation repeated and the Cosmos renewed. So will it be until the world period (year) again ends, or there is a death or a great sin?for then the Tree has grown again and bears fruit. Now to consider the dead. They are taken to the village of the dead by Tempon Telon, representing the Total Godhead. He takes first the soul, then the body, both being reunited in the afterworld by being bathed in the water of life. But the earlier view is preserved in the myths, where the dead become falcons and snakes, which agrees with the cosmic, religious, and social dualism, and refers to their afterlife in the Upperworld or Under world villages of the dead, according to their group. At the tiwah the remains are burnt and put in the sandong (bone-house), placed on poles or on the ground, up or down river, according to the Upperworld or Underworld association of the deceased's group. Nowadays there is thought to be only one village of the dead (for good people of both groups) situated on the edge of the Upper world, not one in Upperworld and another in Underworld as formerly. But the old concept of Totality is preserved since the village of the dead is depicted as resting on both Naga and Hornbill. The wooden figure and stone erected for the dead [despite a probably megalithic basis]x are seen as representative of body and soul together = social and religious totality. The Ngadju Dayaks consider it important to live in harmony with the dead, who in their totality are also an aspect of the Total Godhead. 1 H. G. Quaritch Wales, op. cit., p. 94.</page><page sequence="17">116 THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION In his final chapter (Ch. 12) Sch?rer offers his interpretation of the Ngadju Dayak concepts under the heading " The nature of the Dayak religion ". His main conclusion is to be found in the following passage : "It strikes us that the highest gods were never repre sented in art as persons, but as mythical totem animals?Hornbill and Naga?while of their representatives, the sangiangs, images do indeed exist. This may agree with the two highest deities being identical with the two tribal halves, and consequently not to be depicted except as totem-animals or as totem-emblems (lance and cloth). They are not persons, but the Total Society. In the two highest deities the two tribal halves deify and make themselves absolute and objective. When they appear as two groups, they do so as Naga and Hornbill, as Jata and Mahatala. When they appear as Totality, they do so as the Naga who is also the Hornbill, i.e. the total, bisexual, and ambivalent Godhead. At important events they appear as the personified functions of the highest gods, for it is the Total Society which acts in and through them. The godly world is therefore an image of the human. . . . What we have said of the Godhead, applies also to the divine worlds. The Upperworld and Underworld are not in the first place the dwelling-places of the two highest deities, but of the two phratries, or ritual groups. The drawings show a representation of our world " (pp. 177 f.). The gods have no world of their own, they dwell only on an offerings-table in this world, as a symbol of transcendent human society. So also for the dead, who remain nearby in this world as members of the community : the sandong is the village of the dead. The " village of the dead in the Upperworld is the transcendental Totality of all sandongs of the Total Community ". Then as to the Creation Myth. " The Creation Myth tells us not of creation, but it states how the Total Society is ordered, and how the whole Cosmos and all its appearances are brought into agree ment with the community and its different groups. It explains the sociological structure of the tribe, it shows the function of the different groups, and it is the basis of the cosmic/classificatory system " (p. 179). The assembling of the whole people at the year's end, or on the other occasions mentioned, with a period of feasting and licence, and the symbolical repetition of the primordial differentiation, enables a new start to be made, and the social order to be reconstituted for a further period. Without going into great</page><page sequence="18">THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION 117 detail I think that enough has now been said to indicate the lines of Sch?rer's interpretation. My criticisms of the above, making use of both internal and external evidence, may conveniently be divided under three headings : (1) to show that the appearances of oneness or totality in this " conception of God " are secondary to an earlier dualism, while, despite this secondarily conceived totality, one of the pair of deities continues to maintain a prior importance ; (2) to consider the validity of the author's " sociological " interpretation of the religion, and (3) to show, in a widely comparative setting, the real meaning of the ritual of the dramatized repetition of the creation. That the totality is secondary to an earlier dualism seems evident from the titles, " The Naga who is united with the Hornbill ; the Naga who is also the Hornbill." The Hornbill represented with scales and the Naga with feathers are also obviously secondary concepts. The " soul boat " with combined Naga and Hornbill heads, still more the type of sangiang's boat which consists of a complete Hornbill boat placed on top of a Naga boat, are combina tions which could exist only as a result of a secondary conjunction of ideas. So also with the coffin-boat as Godhead, a boat which we are asked to believe served " not primarily " for a journey. In the Creation Myth the third mythical ancestor, Maharaja Sangen, seems to be a combination of the other two. That the existence of a totality concept fails to suppress the non-equality of the two deities, and the greater importance of Mahatala, is shown by several features. In the Creation Myth Jata's home has been transferred from the Underworld and placed on a mountain in the Upperworld, comparable to Mahatala's. This is clearly a secondary idea designed to obscure Jata's former inferiority. With this is undoubtedly coupled Jata's manifestation as a female Hornbill instead of a Naga. Mahatala's part in the creation is more important than is Jata's. The rich social group is associated with him. He is to the fore in legal procedure and judgment. The land of the dead in Mahatala's realm, the Upper world, was formerly reserved for the rich group. All this accords with the supremacy accorded the sky deity among peoples strongly influenced by Dongsonian beliefs, and it agrees also with our pre Sch?rer information concerning the Ngadju Dayak religion. Sch?rer's interpretation of the Ngadju Dayak conception of God</page><page sequence="19">118 THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION is immediately recognizable as an application of the theory of Emile Durkheim and the French sociological school. Though the founder's name is nowhere mentioned, the work of W. H. Rassers and several other Dutch exponents is referred to with approval. Durkheim's theory, an outgrowth of Marxism, was simply that God is in origin nothing but society deified, a combination of the totems representing the two exogamous phratries into which the primitive tribe was divided. The fact that social anthropology during the decade following the second world war so largely concerned itself with kinship and social structure, no doubt made it tempting thus to regard religion as a by-product, or more usually to neglect it altogether.1 Nevertheless we may note in passing that Durkheim's theory has been rejected by two of the most distinguished anthropologists of this century, Malinowski2 and Kroeber.3 What is perhaps more generally known is that Durkheim's theory has been found unacceptable by virtually all students of com parative religion, on grounds summarized by Paul Radin as follows : " The fundamental objections to the point of view of the Durkheim school are the well-known ones. It is aprioristic ; it is arbitrary in its choice of information ; it is not always critical in what it does select ; and it eliminates the individual." 4 According to Durkheim the cosmic bodies were merely employed by the primitives as a means of classifying the all-important social phenomena. As this concerns our present study somewhat closely it may be worth while to mention that here a specific weakness has been pointed out by M. Eliade. Remarking, inter alia, upon the importance of the religious values placed on the course of the moon, he criticizes the attempt of members of the French sociological school to main tain the social origins of the rhythms of sacred time.5 1 " It was argued that social structure should be clearly separated from the other aspects of man's social heritage. These came to be subsumed under the title * culture ', a word which has often been used in the post-war years almost in a pejorative sense to describe a sort of rag-bag of odds and ends in which to thrust all facts and ideas in which the social anthropologist was not at the moment interested."

To give his elucidation the slightest vraisemblance he realizes that he must show evidence for totemism, and so he produces so-called totem-emblems and totem-animals. The emblems are, however, sex-emblems, the lance of Mahatala, the cloth of Jata. As totem-animals he offers us the Hornbill and Naga. Had he considered these in a wider cultural perspective he must surely have recognized them, in association with the Cosmic Tree, as an example of the well-known cosmological symbolism of the Tree with bird at summit and snake at root.1 This has indeed been recognized by Eliade when he refers to the Ngadju Dayak myths as expressing " l'ancien sch?ma cosmogonique de la hi?ro gamie Ciel-Terre, sch?ma exprim? ?galement, sur un autre plan, par le symbolisme des oppos?s compl?mentaires Oiseau-Serpent ".2 In beginning now the more constructive part of my task I would point out that there is world-wide evidence showing an evolution towards totality. This is not itself a primary concept and in religion developed alongside the cult of individual deities. Thus we find the growing importance, as religious thought develops, of the coincidentia oppositorum,3 the urge to combine the pairs of opposites, such as light and darkness, male and female, life and death, good and bad, rich and poor, which everywhere present themselves in nature, but which suggest the idea of divine perfection only when combined as a totality. The widespread desire for the reconciliation of contraries is very evident when myths are examined. Primitively this results in the concept of the androgynous deity in religion. and the rhythms of nature. In point of fact this divergence in no way disproves the link between man's systems of reckoning and the rhythms of nature ; it simply proves on the one hand the inconsistency of primitive reckoning and chronometry, and on the other the non-' naturalist ' character of primitive piety, whose feasts were not directed to any natural phenomenon in itself but to the religious aspect of that phenomenon." M. Eliade, Patterns in Comparative Religion, London, 1958, p. 390. (This is a translation of Trait? d'histoire des Religions.) 1 A. J. Wensinck, Tree and Bird as Cosmological Symbols in Western Asia, Amsterdam, 1921, p. 46. 2 M. Eliade, Le Chamanisme, Paris, 1951, p. 258. Hornbills and snakes were of course widely venerated, without this implying a totemistic basis, cf. J. H. Hutton, The Angami Nagas, Appendix IV. 3 M. Eliade, Patterns . . ., p. 419.</page><page sequence="21">120 THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION Socially this is paralleled when the importance of the tribe is seen to transcend its often antagonistic moieties. Examples could be given from many cultures, e.g. the Chinese, where " above the Yin and Yang categories, the Tao plays the part of a supreme category : Power, Totality, Order ".1 But there is no need to go beyond the more primitive peoples of Indonesia where " this union of Father and Mother, Sky and Earth, Sun and Moon, exists alongside of or superimposes itself5 upon a duality of the Sky (or Sun)-Father and the Earth (or Moon)-Mother, in the same way as [my italics] the unity of the communal organization stands alongside of and above the two halves composing it ".2 This will suffice to show that quite primitive peoples are capable of evolving theory?the theory of primeval unity. Father Sky and Mother Earth, as a divine pair of opposites, can be traced far back in prehistory, the worship of the former taking precedence among hunting and pastoral peoples, and of the latter among agriculturists. Even when they come to be effectively combined as a Supreme Totality we can often detect which of the pair retains the chief place : Thus with Gawang of the Konyak Nagas, Ga (Earth) precedes Wang (Sky) ; while Dua Nggae (Sky earth) in Middle Flores is blue, lives in heaven, and has the stars for eyes,3 thus showing the prior status of sky, just as we have seen with the duality Mahatala/Jata. As to the dual organization of society, it has long been recognized that no single origin can be postulated : " No one theory of origin can be laid down as conclusive ; each occurrence must receive special attention." 4 A division into rich and poor, or upper and lower classes seems eminently natural. But, as W. H. R. Rivers believed in the case of Melanesia, it seems to me that the effect of the immigration of a more powerful or highly cultured people cannot be ruled out as sometimes providing an additional reinforce ment for such division. I have implied as much in comparing the aerial burial and sky afterworld of the upper class Ngadju Dayaks with that of the upper class Central Asian and Siberian nomads.5 Despite this, as Sch?rer has clearly indicated, the often antagonistic 1 M. Granet, La Pens?e Chinoise, Paris, 1934, p. 325. 2 R. Pettazzoni, The All-Knowing Cod, London, 1956, p. 336. 3 Ibid., p. 334. 4 I. Schapera, Encyclopaedia Britannica, 14th edn., art. " Dual Organization ". 5 H. G. Quaritch Wales, op. cit., p. 92.</page><page sequence="22">THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION 121 groups are anxious to stress their membership of the total community. Man was undoubtedly interested in his own creation (as in Genesis, Ch. 2) before he became interested in cosmogony (as in the added Genesis, Ch. 1) ; and the Ngadju Dayak Creation Myth has a substratum which does not differ markedly from creation myths of other Bornean and Indonesian peoples. But once man had become aware of the cosmos, and of his position in regard to it, he or at least those of a community capable of appreciating esoteric thought, were provided with a useful means of strengthening the idea of totality. But we should note that this concept of a Supreme Being who is the world order is not the same as the " primitive monotheism " of K. Th. Preuss, who not only supposed this con ception to be fundamental but also regarded the Godhead as a transcendental Creator.1 What we actually find is the application, not only to religion, but to virtually all aspects of culture, of the widely-known " universe analogy " or macrocosm-microcosm doctrine. In this the Godhead is no longer anthropomorphically conceived, despite the primitive duality of the earliest cosmos, as in ancient China,2 and among the Winnebago Indians.3 At a later stage, probably as the result of ultimately Mesopotamian influence, we find the universe of three or five strata, with finally the planetary cosmos of seven or nine heavens ; and the Cosmic Axis, from being used as a means by which the shaman passes in spirit from stratum to stratum, becomes an emblem (as Mountain or Tree) of Cosmic Totality. The fact that with the Ngadju Dayaks the Cosmos is now dual suggests a loss of culture since the mention that the Upperworld is reached through forty-two cloud layers (a multiple of seven) indicates a vague memory of a stratified planetary cosmos. That the whole system described by Sch?rer is based upon the macrocosm-microcosm symbolism is evident enough from his definitions of the totality of the Ngadju Dayak Godhead, and equally so from the wholesale manner in which the universe-analogy has 1 K. Th. Preuss, Glauben und Mystik im Schatten des H?chsten Wesens, Leipzig, 1926, p. 38. 2 C. Hentze, " Cosmogonie du Monde Dress? Debout et du Monde Renvers?," in Serie Orientale Roma, xiv. 3 C.

How obviously indeed has the cosmic framework been applied to what is essentially the simple battle of arguments that constitutes the usual means of settling disputes among primitives.1 In the marriage ceremony, again, one may be disposed to agree with the opinion of a previous observer that the clasping of the symbolic tree by the bridal pair is essentially a fertility rite.2 Far from there being a " deeper meaning ", as supposed by Sch?rer, the cosmic significance, known only to the few, is more likely to be secondary ; for the Tree of Life, symbolizing power, is older than the concept of the Cosmic Tree.3 Then the reader has only to glance over the whole list of items, including sangiangs, spirits, priests, coffins, boats, houses, villages, as well as the individual and group, alive or dead, to observe the constant application of the macrocosm-microcosm doctrine. So by this " cosmisation ", more effectively than in primitive means of effecting (or restoring a supposed primordial) totality, man " remakes in himself and for himself the primeval unity which was before the world began ".4 To be of practical value such thought requires a magico religious ritual which can regenerate the cosmos at any time that the divine order appears to have suffered disruption. That this has, in the esoteric system, developed alongside the popular cult of sky deities, is confirmed by the nature of the associated ceremonial. What is this ritual ? Sch?rer makes it plain that there is only one such ceremony. He describes it as it is performed in connection with the tiwah, but he states that it is also carried out at the New Year, and whenever it is necessary to remove the effects of some serious sin ; also on a minor scale on occasions when the cosmic harmony is deemed to have been to some extent disturbed. For Sch?rer, as we have seen, the ceremony is cosmic only in that a cosmic classification is used to symbolize the repetition of the primordial social differentiation. But such rites have been 1 E.g. A. C. Kruyt, De Bare'e sprekende Toradjas . . ., i, p. 198 ; P. R. T. Gurdon, The Khasis, London, 1914, p. 92 ; and which indeed seems to have been generally understood as such by the Ngadjus, cf. Mallinckrodt, loc. cit., pp. 293 if. 2 Mallinckrodt, loc. cit., p. 93. 3 M. Eliade, Patterns . . ., pp. 267-9. 4 Ibid., p. 420.</page><page sequence="24">THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION 123 made the subject of careful comparative study by M. Eliade,1 and it is against this wider background that we can now evaluate the Ngadju Dayak ritual. In still existing folk ceremonies we find the burning of a tree, in a rite symbolic of the regeneration of vegetation and of the year in springtime.2 For example it occurs in the Holi festival in India. This in its most primitive form, with the burning of a stake symbolic of " the burning of the old year ", has been attributed to aboriginal usage taken up by Hinduism.3 But with the applica tion of cosmic concepts the tree becomes a microcosm and the ceremony one of cosmic renewal. The yearly repetition of the creation was enacted in Babylonia when the sea-monster Tiamat was destroyed by Marduk, to put an end to chaos, and the idea is found in Christian, Jewish, Persian, and Indian traditions. Essentially similar is the repetition of the creation in Fiji when a new chieftain is crowned. Everywhere the principle involved is that historical time may be destroyed by repeating an archetypal action which took place in mythical or sacred time, thus enabling a new start to be made. Characteristic proceedings are purifications, expulsion of evil, masked processions and receptions of the ancestors, fights between opposing teams, saturnalia, and orgy. The reception of the dead shows that all barriers between life and death have been removed. " The presence of orgy among the ceremonials marking the periodic divisions of time shows the will to abolish the past totally by abolishing all creation . . . licence is let loose, all commands are violated, all contraries are brought together, and all this is simply to effect the dissolution of the world?of which the com munity is a copy?and restore the primeval Mud tempus." 4 Having thus abolished the Cosmos, by a magical return to a supposedly primordial undifferentiated chaos, the creation is repeated in a ceremony symbolizing the struggle between the contrary deities with the intention " to start a new life in the midst of a new creation ". As we have seen, in the case of the Ngadju 1 Ibid. Chapters XI and XII. My indebtedness to Eliade's study of these cosmological aspects does not mean that I subscribe to the extreme importance he would ascribe to cosmic features in culture generally ; cf. my review of Patterns . . ., JRAS., 1958, p. 216. 2 Ibid., p. 311. 3 W.

Eliade, Patterns .. ., pp. 399 f.</page><page sequence="25">124 THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION Dayaks this is done by symbolically destroying the Cosmic Tree and the two hornbills. We should note that the desire to start a new creation " is no spiritual attitude, which depreciates life on earth and all that goes with it in favour of a ' spirituality ' of detachment from the world. On the contrary, what may be called the ? nostalgia for eternity ' proves that man longs for a concrete paradise, and believes that such a paradise can be won here, on earth, and now, in the present moment ".1 Essentially the same symbolism and magic has been applied, in the theological system, to the Ngadju Dayak rites of initiation and of marriage, and to the judicial system, each of which, as we have seen, involves a new creation. And in the service of this imitative magic the macrocosm-microcosm doctrine has everywhere found employment. Further, the village and the house are " easy sub stitutes " for the sacred centres they are held to represent. " Not only does the construction of the house take place in the centre of the world, but in a sense it also repeats the creation." 2 The Ngadju Dayak symbolism for the house falls into a pattern for house, palace, and temple that is now widely known?but nowhere can the critical mind suppose that such symbolism is anything but secondary. The question of " origins ", entirely subsidiary to the main theme of this article, may be postponed until I have carried my examination of the Indonesian material somewhat further. I now propose to consider a more recent book which certainly invites comparison with the foregoing. This is The Structure of the Toba Batak Belief in the High God, by Dr. Ph. L. Tobing, Amsterdam, 1956. Before embarking on this, however, we must briefly outline what was known of Batak religion prior to Tobing's work. The basic study is that of Warneck.3 According to him the Supreme Deity is Mu?a Jadi na Bolon, an otiose creator living in the highest of the seven heavens. Besides the Upperworld the Batak cosmology recognizes the Middleworld of man, and an Underworld of demons and the dead. However, many of the latter remain in this world and the renowned go to a sky afterworld. The otiose Supreme Deity has been effectively replaced by a triad of active atmospheric 1 Ibid., p. 408. 2 Ibid., p. 382. 3 J. Warneck, Die Religion der Batak, Leipzig, 1909 ; largely utilized by E. M. Loeb, Sumatra, Vienna, 1935, with further bibliography.</page><page sequence="26">THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION 125 deities, Batara Guru, Soripata, and Mangalabulan, born from three large eggs laid by a fabulous bird which the Creator placed on a tree. These three gods live one stage lower in the Upperworld, and are evidently in some sense deified ancestors. Naga Padoha is the deity of the Underworld and regarded as evil. There are also various other gods of different grades. The spirits of the dead (begu) may, as a result of their descendants' feasts, become nature spirits (sombaon). All these require propitiation and sacrifice. Death is explained as the theft of a person's soul (tondi) by a begu. Batak civilization, and especially that of the Sembiring sib of the Karo-Bataks, who alone practice cremation, was more or less influenced by Indian culture, as is obvious from their script and divination books, their deity and sib names, and their vocabulary. Consequently it is not surprising to find that religious cult, once probably a strict shamanism, has become influenced by trance-mediumship or " possession ". The sibaso, or shaman, is always a woman. Though undergoing no initiation she is a true ecstatic, but allows herself to be possessed by the spirits who have chosen her. She knows their language and finds out what sacrifices are needed by a begu to procure the recovery of a patient. The datu, or priest-magician, has undergone an initiation from a guru but does not go into a trance. His procedure for treatment of a sick person is by exorcism of the evil spirits, and he makes much use of his magic staff, for the manufacture of which it was necessary to sacrifice a child. All of this betrays the influence of Indian magic.1 It must be added that in more recent years the cosmic nature of the Batak Godhead, to be revealed in detail by the investigations of Tobing, had in some degree been recognized by several authors.2 Dr. Ph. Lumban Tobing is himself a Toba-Batak, and this no doubt gave him many advantages as a field-worker among his own people. He is also a Ph.D. of Leiden, which makes his theoretical approach a matter claiming our interested attention at the outset. He rejects animism, but what he dislikes about " primitive mono theism " is mainly the otiose character, resulting from degeneration, that is generally ascribed to the Supreme Being of present-day peoples. At the same time he firmly rejects any interpretation 1 M. Eliade, Le Chamanisme, pp. 312 f. 2 K. H. A. Hidding, " Allah Ta'ala," in Binkisan Budi, Leiden, 1950, p. 147 ; V. E.

He recognizes that Preuss' view of the cosmic character of the Godhead has some value ; and, like him, in practice he regards this character as fundamental, saying (p. 20) that he does not propose to deal with the history or origin of the structure of the Godhead. To correct Preuss' view of the otiose nature of the Supreme Deity, who did nothing beyond starting the world order, Tobing theorizes in terms of L?vy-BruhPs so-called " law of participation ". It would have been better had he realized that, as seen in primitive symbolism, " the whole exists within each significant fragment, not because the ' law of participation ' (as understood by L?vy-Bruhl) is valid, but because every significant fragment reproduces the whole ".1 Eventually Tobing does recognize what we are in fact concerned with, the application of the macrocosm-microcosm symbolism : " The Tobanese relation to this God is therefore that of a part to the whole, or rather, the individual is a microcosmos within the macrocosmos, which is the High God " (p. 94). Dr. Tobing certainly brings much new and valuable information towards a fuller understanding of the esoteric conception of the Batak God head. Where I shall have to take issue with him is on his main thesis that this " totalitarian way of thinking is underlying and inherent " to the structure of the High God (p. 177). Tobing's main sources are the creation and other myths, of which he gives texts and translations of versions not previously available. He tells us that the Toba-Batak Supreme Deity, known as Mu?a Jadi na Bolon, or more shortly Debata, is the Total Cosmos. But this Godhead " has three aspects, each representing one of the three worlds ", or being a manifestation of Debata. As Bubi na Bolon he is the god of the Upperworld and is the Upperworld itself ; as Silaon na Bolon he is god of the Middleworld and is the Middleworld itself ; as Pane na Bolon (or Naga Padoha, the Under world serpent) he is god of the Underworld and is the Underworld itself. A lance is the Upperworld emblem, a cloth the Underworld emblem (p. 133), while a wooden rack, raga-raga, symbolizes in rites the Middleworld (p. 68). The Toba-Batak experiences the same Debata in each of the tree deities. Yet Debata in his totality is " imagined as living in the highest sphere of the Upperworld " (p. 28). More definitely " the seventh sphere of the Upperworld is the dwelling-place of the High God ; from this place he rules all 1 M. Eliade, Patterns . . ., p. 269, and cf. Ch. XIII, " The Structure of Symbols."</page><page sequence="28">THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION 127 that exists " (p. 97). Also the Tree met with in three creation myths, which reaches from the Underworld to the Upperworld, is identical with the High God [Godhead], and represents the Total Cosmos (p. 60). " Beyond doubt the High God is the banian tree renewing itself by growing twigs and fruits again and again " (p. 120). However, other myths and folktales speak of a banian tree growing at the entrance to the Upperworld. This is the Upperworld Tree = the Upperworld itself (pp. 60 ff.). Tobing deduces (pp. 71-81) that the triad Batara Guru, Sori, and Balabulan (Mangalabulan), who were born from the three eggs, are " representations of the three functional groups in the Tobanese system of relationship ", and (p. 135) that these three mythical ancestors also represent Under-, Middle-, and Upperworld respectively. Together they form a microcosm known in their totality as Debata Asi-asi, and personified by the village chief. [This appears, I may comment here, to be a superimposed combination similar to Maharaja Sangen with the Ngadju Dayaks, but reflecting a more developed cosmos of three strata.] Our previous information is confirmed as to the behaviour, if not the significance, of the begu, or ghosts of the ordinary dead. " Illness, misfortune, etc., are imputed to the tondi leaving the body. If it stays away for a long time, a man must die. It is the spirits which can entice a tondi from the body and keep it in their power " (p. 86). Again, " when a begu makes somebody ill . . . if the begu accepts the sacrifice, recovery will set in, if not, death will follow " (p. 100). The sombaons, or nature spirits, unlike the begus, very rarely live in the Upper- or Underworld, but are frequent in our world, where they sometimes wage war on each other, and also cause illness and demand sacrifices from men. They, like the begus, derive their power from the High God (p. 101). In view of the above description of the begu's behaviour, the following generalization may strike one as a little surprising : " It will now have become clear that each begu is an entity of time and space. The High God is the assignor of the dwelling places and the functions of the begu. He makes them live in the Upper-, Middle-, and Underworld. Against this background the High God can scarcely be anything else but the oneness of all space and all order. In other words, the begu are parts or rather manifestations of the High God. A begu and the High God cannot be separated ; they form an inseparable oneness, although they can be quantita 11 JRAS. OCTOBER 1959</page><page sequence="29">128 THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION tively distinguished : the totality is more powerful than a part. In each of the begu the Tobanese experience the High God. He is a ' deus otiosus ' and active God as well, oneness as well as multiplicity, etc." (p. 106). That the village and house are each regarded as microcosms (pp. 136-8) is as we should expect within this system. Similarly, since the villager originates from the Tree, lives with it and will be united with it again after death (as symbolized by the planting of a banian on his grave), it is natural to find that initiation rites are considered to have the aim of " participating " in the Under-, Middle-, and Upperworld (p. 139). The bius celebration, held at New Year and after epidemics, has already been shown by Korn to be a festival of cosmic renewal. Now Tobing shows reason to see in the slaughter-pole, to which the sacrificial buffalo is attached, a representation of the Cosmic Tree = Total Godhead (pp. 152-4). Especially does his interpreta tion of the much-discussed magic staff (tunggal panaluan), as having the same significance, seem to me convincing (pp. 155-168). He then gives an interesting and detailed description from personal observation of the dances performed by the datus at the bius celebration, " a magico-religious dramatization of the cosmic renewal " in which the magic staff, standing in a basket of rice, has an important role. I think the purport of the whole will be sufficiently clear if I quote only his interpretation of the last dance :? " This last dance demonstrates the tunggal panaluan as the High God in his totality of Under-, Middle-, and Upperworld. Therefore we may see in this dance, which is a combination of the preceding ones, the magico-religious dramatization of the ' total ' cosmic renewal, but also of the cosmic destruction, as the two are inherent. The wiping-out of the octagon [or ' double-square ' drawing, representing the Middleworld] and of the naga-drawing [repre senting the Underworld], the removal of the altar, etc., the killing of the animals, and the planting of the tunggal panaluan on the egg [placed in the centre of the octagon], what do they represent ? The myth, the text of which has been published on p. 115 sq. of this work, throws a surprisingly new light on this. Let us summarize what we have said there : ' The end of the year is the cosmic destruction and renewal at the same time. The tree of life dies, a new one develops from the same trunk, nourished by the fruit fallen from the old tree.' Notice the essential oneness of myth,</page><page sequence="30">THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION 129 rite, and magic. For in the wiping-out of the octagon and the naga drawing, in the removal of the altar, etc., and in the killing of the animals we see the symbolical destruction of the total cosmos, the community included. We see the dramatization of the renewal in the planting of ' the same ' tunggal panaluan, because it has been in the possession of the community from generation to generation. It is planted on the egg, which no doubt symbolizes the fruit of the old tree of life and consequently it is a representation of the new cosmic life. So we see that the tunggal panaluan actually symbolizes the High God. It represents him in his trinity and in the total character of each of his manifestations ; in the three ' aspect ' dances and in the one combining the three the same staff is used " (p. 173). My opinion of Dr. Tobing's theoretical standpoint has already been stated. Now my first comment on the material he provides will concern the nature and formation of the Toba-Batak cosmos and Total Godhead. This tri-partite cosmos represents a more advanced conception than does that of the Ngadju Dayaks which, without prejudice to the possibility of their having known something more complex during earlier times, at present closely adheres to a primitive dualism. Now the underlying uranic character of the Batak High God, and lingering theistic conception of him, persists in his being thought to reside in the highest heaven. So his " total " nature is undoubtedly secondary. Again, the conception of the banian tree, representing the total cosmos or Godhead, that is found in the three creation myths, is an obvious extension of the belief met with in other myths and folktales of a more limited Upperworld tree = Sky. I do not feel entirely convinced as to the three active deities Batara Guru, Sori, and Balabulan, being equated to the three worlds, especially the relating of Batara Guru to the Underworld, which conflicts with our previous information, and with the generally prior importance of the Upperworld, as seen in the nature of the High God. In fact it is stated in the myth translated on p. 37 that Batara Guru " comes from the higher heights, from the upper most sphere of the Upperworld ". Although it is not surprising to find these " three gods " regarded more and more as ancestors, with the cosmological symbolism probably applied both to them and the social relationships, it seems to me that further investigation is needed on this matter.</page><page sequence="31">130 THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION The secondary character of the cosmic status is very evident in what we are told about the behaviour of the begu and sombaon. Their essentially animistic bias is only too apparent in their thoroughly individualistic activities ; and the status of microcosm does not seem to fit them very comfortably. Certainly Tobing's arguments, referred to above, are very weak. Nor should we expect the microcosm status to be readily acceptable by the ordinary man in regard to his tondi. For as Tobing rather ingenuously remarks : " Though the feeling of being part of cosmic reality is predominant, though nature and its course are the pattern to which the Tobanese adapts his life as much as possible, yet he is a conscious and rational being who can detach himself from everything around him " (p. 154). In maintaining that the macrocosm-microcosm doctrine is not fundamental to Batak culture I would not seek to underestimate the very general manner in which it seems to have been applied in the esoteric religious system. Indeed this has perhaps been more thoroughly achieved here than with the Ngadju Dayaks, judging by the concept of the total Godhead and some of the features of the bius ceremony, as will appear below. Dr. Tobing undoubtedly underrates the extent of Indian and Indo-Javanese influences among the Bataks, and particularly the Toba-Bataks. He dismisses any traces of them among the latter as " unimportant " (p. 17), even though he seems to experience a doubt when he reflects on the speed with which the greater part of the Toba-Bataks have been converted to Christianity. Archaeology shows that the population of Padang Lawas were Indianized Bataks, who built a number of thoroughly Indianesque temples.1 It would be strange if some rather strong Indian influences had not reached the Toba-Bataks. So Tobing overlooks the fact that Pane na Bolon, or Naga Padoha, the Underworld deity, and especially the auguries drawn from the supposed position thereof, have been proved by Voorhoeve to be of Indian origin.2 Of more concern to us here is that Tobing fails to recognize that the desa na ulu or " double square ", used to represent the Middleworld in the cosmic renewal rites, should be compared with figs. 3 and 4 of P. H. Pott's Yoga en Yantra. This has been pointed out by P. E. de Josselin 1 F. M. Schnitger, The Archaeology of Hindoo Sumatra, Leiden, 1937, Chapter V. 2 Bijdragen, 113, pp. 291 f. In my Ancient South-East Asian Warfare, p. 157, I gave a different explanation of this Naga, equating it with Rahu.</page><page sequence="32">THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION 131 de Jong.1 It is unquestionably derived from the Indian mandola, and this indeed was already recognized by Schnitger.2 The use of the m?ndala indicates the influence of Tantrism, and provides a symbol of cosmic totality which enables the Bataks to give precision to their own vaguer views. As illustrated in Tobing's Sketch 7, the double-square is outlined in three colours to symbolize the three worlds, further a naga is drawn inside to represent the Underworld. At the centre is placed an egg and, as we have seen, in the last dance the datu places the magic staff, symbolizing the Supreme Totality, on the cosmic centre. While underestimating the Indian influences, Tobing is certainly right when he generalizes (p. 18) : " Foreign elements have only been adopted when they could be brought in an organic relation with their original cosmic views." We may now pause to consider briefly the subsidiary question of the origin of the esoteric religious concepts of the Ngadju Dayaks. A comment that I may mention here on the difficult question of foreign influence comes from Eliade in his brief reference to Sch?rer's work in Le Chamanisme (p. 258). While Eliade there recognizes, as we have seen, the presence of the ancient Sky-Earth basis, he adds, without giving his reasons : " It is moreover incontestable that some Indian influences have been added later to the ancient local basis, even though these influences are often limited to the gods' names." This sentence is really too ambiguous to be satis factory : the first part accords with the view to which I feel inclined, the second part is merely a repetition of the contrary opinion of Sch?rer. I shall now state my reasons for concluding very tentatively in favour of Indian, or more particularly, Indo Javanese influence. 1. In the Mahakam region of East Borneo, considerable finds of Indo-Ja v?nese cultural objects have been made, especially the Hindu and Buddhist statues in the Mount Kombeng cave. Various characteristics have led to these being thought to be the work of Javanese long separated from their own land, or else of " marginal Dayaks ".3 One is also reminded of the Sambas (West Borneo) incense-burner discussed by me elsewhere, which I concluded to have been the work of a people marginal to Hinduism.4 Further 1 Bijdragen, 113, p. 396. 2 F.

Even Sch?rer, so strongly opposed to the admission of Hindu influence as he was, freely allowed that the Ngadju Dayak myths indicate that close relations existed between the Ngadjus and the rulers and people of Majapahit.1 Need one ask more by way of conditions suitable for some degree of cultural transfer ? 2. The Ngadjus are exceptional in Borneo as practising cremation, the bones being burnt at the tiwah. Wherever cremation is found in Indonesia it is generally accepted as a decisive sign that there has been Indian influence. 3. According to Sch?rer, the priestly maps of the Upperworld are merely maps of our world. But one of those he illustrates 2 certainly suggests the possibility of another interpretation. In this drawing we see the representation of the sangiangs' villages. Four of the larger ones are depicted as circles, each having an eight-petaled flower in or near the centre. Another large circle has wheel-like divisions. Could not these be mandolas, at any rate the Ngadju Dayak conception of such symbols ? They do not have to be immediately identifiable as a specialized type of m?ndala, as was the case with the Toba-Batak " double-square ", because the word mandola means literally a " circle " ; also because " for the most part, the m?ndalo form is that of a flower, cross, or wheel, with a distinct tendency towards four as the basis of structure ".3 As providing a well-defined image of the universe, or of the micro cosm, the mandola would surely have been found as useful by the Ngadju Dayaks as it was by the Toba-Bataks. Gongs (= microcosms ?) are similarly drawn.4 4. There is no " possession " of the balians by ancestors, nor are they concerned with the general cult of ancestors. But a careful study of the passage I have quoted from Sch?rer on the matter of " incorporation " of the sangiangs now inclines me to the belief that their relation to the balians represents at least a considerable 1 Sch?rer, op. cit., p. 234, n. 12. 2 Sch?rer, op. cit., Plate V, also Cultured Indi?, iv, p. 74. 3 C. G. Jung, The Secret of the Golden Flower, London, 1931, p. 97. The fact that something like m?ndalas are known to some American Indians, as also to Jung's patients, would not appear to me, all things considered, to be a very strong argu ment against the Bornean m?ndalas, if such they be, resulting from Tantric influence. 4 Sch?rer, op. cit., Plate XX also Cultured Indi?, iv, p. 73.</page><page sequence="34">THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION 133 step towards " possession ", as compared with the status of the sangiangs as helper-spirits in the popular shamanism. This personal situation of the balians vis-?-vis the sangiangs, quite apart from the magical symbolism of the macrocosm-microcosm doctrine, would point towards Indian influence modifying a previously strict shamanism. 5. One would like to be able to say that since nothing com parable to the Ngadju Dayak theological system has been discovered among such thoroughly investigated peoples as the Sea Dayaks and East Tora jas, this points to foreign influence in the case of the Ngadjus. Unfortunately what should perhaps be our strongest argument is rendered our weakest by the fact that both Ngadjus and Bataks had also apparently been well-studied. Here is a challenge to field-workers, if and where it is not already too late. To these considerations must be added the improbability that anything so complicated as the macrocosm-microcosm doctrine, in the full range of its application, which was so characteristic of Indo Javanese Tantrism, was achieved independently or derived from any but that source.1 As we have seen, an awareness of the cosmos, in varying degree of complexity, did not have to await the coming of Indian influences ; but in Bronze Age times it would appear that preoccupation was with the Cosmic Axis as a means by which the shaman could reach the highest heavens. Tantrism, with its magical formulae, brought an easier way, and one which could be easily grafted on to the androgynous deity of primitive totality concepts. The likelihood that this took place is not lessened by the fact that details to-day are not identifiably Indian. The origins of a cosmic mountain, a tree, a bird, a serpent, and similar symbols in the Creation Myth, or even an umbrella-crowned house, do not have to be looked for in India. Obscuring factors are cultural loss since the time of Majapahit contacts, and also probably a considerable local elaboration. Indeed we must bear in mind a remark of Sch?rer's (p. 12) that the Ngadjus have some great thinkers, priests who are constantly developing their religion. It reminds us of what has been said of the Malay theologian's aptitude, at a later date, 1 The macrocosm-microcosm doctrine was also known in China as well as in India and the classical West. But Chinese influence here may be ruled out. There was no deity or spiritus rector concerned in the Chinese conception, which has much more in common with the organic naturalism of modern Western philosophy. Cf. J. Needham, Science and Civilization in China, vol. ii, p. 302.</page><page sequence="35">134 THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION for Sufi mysticism : " The skill with which these Malays with a vocabulary lacking in abstract terms were able to grasp and introduce Sufi mysticism to their world is very remarkable, and though their ideas were not original, in no other field has the Malay mind displayed such intellectual ability and subtlety." x It would seem that when brought into contact with Indo-Javanese Tantrism, the Ngadjus displayed a similar skill, together with a freedom from restraint which only a marginal people can know. It is the critical study of such marginal cultures, which may now perhaps be held to include the Ngadju Dayak as well as the Batak, though in a less degree, that may well be fruitful for a better understanding of the processes involved in the early spread and acceptance of Indian influences in South-East Asia. The indications seem to be that from the outset, magic and religion, with the art that expresses them, were the aspects of Indian culture that made greatest appeal. This accords with what van Leur perhaps not too forcibly stressed when he said that " what expressions of Indian civilization there were in early Indonesia were without exception sacral."2 Law and social structure (the full caste system) were certainly among the less attractive aspects of the Indian cultural pattern in South-East Asia, while in South India they were well assimilated, and there was no waning of the foreign factor. So to suggest like Coed?s (BEFEO, xlix, pt. 1, pp. 353-356) that local response was as inactive towards religion and art as it was to the relatively unattractive legal systems may lead to a wrong impression of the Indianization of South-East Asia. I now propose to bring into the discussion some related problems concerning another people of Indonesia?the Javanese. Here, of course, we are dealing with a civilization which underwent, at a certain period, strong Indianization, with consequent acquaint ance with more spiritual religious ideas in the official culture. Elsewhere I have indicated the way in which a pre-Hindu shamanic religion seems to encourage the adoption of transcendental Mah?y?na Buddhism, with its abolition of the spatial cosmos on the attainment of nirvana, after a step by step ascent of the cosmic axis.3 However, the attitude of Hindu and later Buddhist thinkers 1 Sir E. O. Winstedt, The Malays : A Cultural History, 4th edn., London, 1956, p. 40. 2 J. C. van Leur, Indonesian Trade and Society, The Hague, 1955, p. 107. 3 H. G. Quaritch Wales, Prehistory and Religion . . ., pp. 171 fif.</page><page sequence="36">THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION 135 to the universe (popular theistic worship aside) was often both transcendental and pantheistic at the same time : As Sir Charles Eliot remarked : " The soul wishes to move towards God and away from matter. Yet when Indian writers glorify the deity they rarely abstain from identifying him with the universe." * So I think we should not look for a strict demarcation of the immanent and transcendental in esoteric Indo-Javanese thought.2 For the late period to which I am going to refer, the Majapahit period whose external influences have already engaged our attention, the matter need hardly concern us. By then there is little doubt that magical aspects of Tantrism were uppermost. A case in point is the meaning in Tantrism of the gunungan or kekayon, that puzzling mountain- or tree-piece which is of such importance for the understanding of the wayang kulit, or Javanese shadow play. Now Dr. Jacoba Hooykaas, taking account of the work of Sch?rer and Tobing, on the Ngadju Dayak and Toba-Batak Cosmic Trees, has recognized that similarly the kekayon is an emblem of Totality (Siva-Uma) placed in the " centre ", with which Total Deity the dalang is united during the wayang performance.3 This is undoubtedly a contribution to our better comprehension of the Tantric aspect of the wayang kulit, and it is incidentally no help to the Rassers' theory.4 Perhaps we need say little more of Rassers' theory here than that it is erected on the weak foundation of the Durkheim philo sophy, and the example of Rassers' publications seems to have formed the main inspiration for Sch?rer's interpretation of the Ngadju Dayak Godhead. Certainly it should be mentioned in extenuation that these Durkheim-based views of Rassers first saw the light in his De Pandji-Roman as long ago as 1922, when nothing whatever was known of Bronze Age or Neolithic religion in Indonesia, and lack of adequate support from ethnology was not thought to be a detriment. One was free then to imagine the pre-Hindu " old 1 Sir Charles Eliot, Hinduism and Buddhism, London, 1921, vol. ii, p. 317. 2 That the cosmic symbolism of the stupa was secondary to its basic significance as a substitute body was recognized by Paul Mus, cf.

Apt indeed was the comment of one early Dutch critic : " The refutation of this representation is as difficult as the proof of it." x Prehistory has made great strides since then, though not it would appear for Rassers, who much more recently tries to find an origin of the k?ris (a weapon of evidently Dongson affiliation)2 in terms of his totemistic theory.3 This is not to deny the probability that k?ris and gunungan (when seen as representing Totality) may be equated, but not on the grounds proposed by Rassers. It would seem likely that to both of them the universe-analogy was applied at a certain time, while no doubt they both more and more came to be regarded as the equivalent of Panji, the first ancestor. The most frequent form of k?ris consists of Garuda handle and serpent blade?a perfect microcosm. And we have the analogy of the Batak magic staff which?though now often exhibiting a multiplicity of carvings?has a serpent on the lower part, and must essentially consist of three parts symbolizing the Batak tripartite universe.4 Rassers tells us that Panji's supernatural power lay in his k?ris, that every k?ris is in some way identical with the first ancestor, and even though it be an entirely new one yet it is a link in the chain binding succeeding generations with the mythical founder. It is indeed the materialization of the eternally living clan hero, and receives worship at certain times.5 So it seems comparable to the Samurai's sword. In South-East Asia it reminds us of what we know of the Khmer devardja, or of the megalithic menhir, neither of which fortunately has anyone yet attempted to interpret in terms of totemism. It would seem quite likely that the Javanese national 1 T. Pigeaud, De Tanti Panggelaran, The Hague, 1924, p. 207. It may be men tioned here that for totem animals on the gunungan Rassers points to the two animals facing each other on either side of the Tree. Unlike the example illustrated by him, they are as often as not of the same species, and not particularly warlike in mien. Not recognizing the presence of the Cosmic Tree, Rassers did not appreciate that the animals facing it must be interpreted within the context of the widely known symbolism of animals facing a Cosmic Tree. 2 R.

Since I have had to mention in this article that the opinions of Durkheim and the French sociological school have found virtually unanimous rejection on the part of students of comparative religion, this has seemed an appropriate occasion to remind the reader that these form the foundation of Rassers' theories. Previously 1 I had found it sufficient to criticize such obvious specific points as his failure to recognize the presence of the Cosmic Tree on the gunungan, and the k?la head = Siva in his demoniacal form, often repre sented on the Tree, and as often reduced to a sun-eye, thus losing its Hindu veneer. The fact is that Hassers in studying the Panji myths found plenty of evidence to connect the ancestors with sun or moon ; but, instead of taking these at face value, he dis missed them in favour of Durkheim's theory of a primitive cosmo logical " classification " of a basic totemic clan organization.2 To return to the k?la head on the gunungan : It is this being so frequently transformed into a Sun-eye that somewhat limits the significance of Dr. J. Hooykaas' contribution ; or rather the Sun-eye, coupled with such facts as the naturalistic Sun-face shown on the well-known wayang of Siva in the Batavia Museum, the progressive rounding of the k?la head over the chandis from the twelfth century onwards, the identification of ?iva and indeed of all deities with the Sun in fourteenth-century Majapahit, which identification was carried over into Bali when Majapahit Javanese migrated thither, and where the Sun-seat (padmosana) is of out standing importance. These facts belie the Totality concept, at least as an all-satisfying interpretation of the gunungan. Clearly there is also a no less profound belief in the pre-eminence of a solarized sky deity. The dalang, officiating in the shadow-play, essentially identifies himself with a deity who is Siva as Sun-god/ancestor. So also in Kelantan the ?iva with whom the dalang identifies himself is also Panji, the first ancestor whose solar origins are reflected in the myths.3 It is only if Dr. Hooykaas wishes to concern herself exclu sively with a superimposed Tantric conception that she can say : 1 H. G. Quaritch Wales, The Making of Greater India, pp. 136 ff. 2 W. H. Rassers, Bijdragen, 88, p. 336. 3 J. Cuisinier, Le Theatre d'Ombres ? Kelantan, Paris, 1957, p. 16.</page><page sequence="39">138 THE COSMOLOGICAL ASPECT OF INDONESIAN RELIGION " It now becomes a futile question whether the kekayon is solar or chthonic, as it is both, being the home or transfiguration of Siva-Uma, the divine conception of totality." x If we glance at the products of earlier periods, the Barabadur and the Khmer temple mountains, we find that the cosmic-totality concept has already been applied. It is in this sense that C d?s can correctly say (BEFEO., xlix, p. 352) that all these symbolic structures are both uranic and chthonic, since a totality includes both aspects. But the difference in deep-seated trend is clearly enough indicated by the liking for Mia-heads and the circular terraces of the Barabadur, as against the love of n?gas, the stress on the quarters and the developed pyramids of the Khmer temple-mountains. The solar and uranic features above-mentioned are not manifesta tions of popular Indian theistic religion, marring the perfect realization of esoteric conceptions of Totality. By the fourteenth century neither Tantrism (in its higher or lower aspects) nor any other form of Hinduism or Buddhism, were proof against the general upsurge of Bronze Age ideas ; and a little later in Java we find Older Megalithic-type pyramid building and an underworld land of the dead. No, Tantrism in the fourteenth century was no longer " insoluble in the magma of its Indonesian surroundings, unassail able by all influences of time and space ", as Bosch has imagined.2 ?iva is the Sun/Ancestor, the solarized pre-Hindu sky deity resurgent. The Sun's supremacy can now no more be adequately cloaked by the universe-analogy in Majapahit than can the nature of the Godhead with the Ngadju Dayaks and Toba-Bataks. As I have said in my book Prehistory and Religion in South-East Asia (pp. 153 f.), I believe that the evidence strongly supports those who have seen the dalang as formerly a shaman journeying in trance to the sky deities, this being before the ancestor element and " possession " became so pronounced, and finally the wayang kulit descended to the field of entertainment. That is to say it was in earlier times a shamanic s?ance, at least in the eyes of the majority. Similarly, no doubt, with the Kelantan shadow-play, on which 1 Jacoba Hooykaas, " Upon a White Stone . . .," loc. cit., p. 331. Another point of some bearing on the matter is that she herself has shown elsewhere (" The Balinese Realm of Death ", Bijdragen, 112, pp. 74-87) that there is old Javanese literary evidence that in the thirteenth-fourteenth century a sky afterworld was conceived?which is not a union with Totality. 2 F.

Cuisinier has recently published the results of her investiga tions. Though of the highest value as a mine of information, her conclusions are regrettably weak. An adherent of Rassers, albeit a half-hearted one, she finds x in the initiation of the dalang the main support for Rassers' explanation of wayang origins in terms of totemic initiation. It does not occur to her that there is nothing peculiarly totemic about this initiation of the dalang, which can certainly as well be explained as pointing to a former shamanism. Finally I would say that I do not wish to undervalue the con tribution of Dr. J. Hooykaas, any more than I do those of Sch?rer and Tobing, when seen in proper perspective to the religion as a whole, and correctly interpreted. But after our comparative study we must feel on familiar ground when Dr. Hooykaas tells us she obtains her information from " four small treatises about the wayang kulit which deal with the macrocosm and microcosm, as nearly all Javano-Balinese mysticism does, following its Indian master ".2 How, indeed, was the Indian master received even in India ? Of course anyone was capable of appreciating totality as an androgynous deity, or a combination of sky and earth, but when it came to such things as the macrocosm-microcosm doctrine of Tantrism " all these mystical techniques are possible only to a tiny minority as compared with the mass of the Indian peoples ".3 It was not that Tantrism was not in theory open to all who could comprehend it. " Bien que la r?v?lation s'adresse ? tous, la voie tantrique comporte une initiation qui ne peut ?tre effectu?e que par un guru ; d'o? l'importance du Ma?tre, qui seul peut trans mettre, ' de bouche ? oreille ', la doctrine secr?te, ?sot?rique." 4 Here is adequate support for the opinion of Prof. Basham, which I quoted at the beginning. I will conclude by repeating his words, as equally applicable to Indonesia, that the cosmic symbolism " seems of far less significance than some authorities are inclined to attribute to it. The symbolism seems always to have been somewhat esoteric, the preserve of schools of learned men who specialized in trying to explain every aspect of life by this means ". 1 J.
