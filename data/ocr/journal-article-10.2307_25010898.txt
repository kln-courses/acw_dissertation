The principal questions are the following: (1) Where was the altar situated? (2) Was the altar an ever-present, conventional property of the theater? (3) Might there be more than one altar? (4) Was the thymele employed as a theatrical property? For these uncertainties paucity of reliable evidence is partly to blame. Vase-illustrations of theatrical altars are difficult to interpret, and literary sources that discuss dra matic questions generally are tainted by the influence of later theatrical usage. I believe, however, that we have at our disposal an additional resource which has not been fully exploited: the plays themselves can yield more information about the altar than has been realized. This essay, which falls into two parts, addresses primarily questions 1 and 2. In Part I I examine selected passages from extant tragedy and argue that they offer a clear, if partial, answer to question 1: the location of the altar seems to have shifted according to dramatic need, and in some plays, at least, the altar stood in the orchestra. Evidence of a movable altar suggests, of course, a nega tive answer to the second question. In confirmation of this I argue in Part II that lexicographical testimony and archaeological evidence leave little doubt that the agyieus-altar had a distinctive appearance. A version of this altar probably did stand on stage whenever the dramatic action took place before a house or palace, and frequent references to it in both tragedy and comedy have been taken as evidence of a permanent stage-altar. But it is difficult to believe that the agyieus altar could have been represented by the same structure as other altars. The use of the agyieus as the conventional sign of a house makes it seem likely that the agyieus occasionally shared the Spielplatz with another altar. Certainly it did so in Thesmophoriazusae (see below, p. 131). I avoid, however, discussion of other possible indications of the use of more than one theatrical altar, since they seem to me to be uncertain. To the fourth question, about the dramatic use of the thymele, I can see no firm basis for any answer, and I shall not attempt one.2 In what follows I shall consider tombs as equivalents of altars, since they served similar dramatic functions.3 I shall use the word "stage" to = Reisch, "Agyieus"; Erika Simon, Das antike Theater (Heidelberg 1972) = Simon, Theater; T.

Whether or not a low stage stood in front of the scene building4 is a matter of no consequence for this inquiry. I SUPPLIANTS, SEVEN AGAINST THEBES, PERSIANS It is a striking fact that an elevation of some sort was a feature of the three earliest extant plays of Aeschylus.5 That this elevation was a descendant of the eleos or thymele or bema on which the earliest actor stood to distinguish himself from the chorus is a plausible but unprovable conjecture.6 In two of these plays, Suppliants and Persians, we can be reasonably confident that an actor speaks from the top of the elevation. At Suppliants 713, when Danaus sights the ships of the Egyptian suitors, he seems to be speaking from the top of the altar (ixeTcra6xoi yaQ Tf lo' a&amp;to oxOJPg o6Q / TO6 nkXoov). Similarly, at line 180 he sees the distant approach of Pelasgus and his retinue-presumably from the same vantage-point, for at 189 he refers to the altar as "this pagos." As important to us as the use of the elevation by the actor is its accessibility to the members of the chorus. Twice, before the entrance of the king at 234 (see 188-89, 208, 224-25) and at the arrival of the Egyptian herald at 836 (see 885 Steinaltar nicht unahnlich gewesen ist ..." .Arnott 57-63 argues that his permanent stage-altar serves also, when required, as a tomb. Two representations of Agamemnon's tomb which date from the mid-fifth century and may have been inspired by Aeschylus' Choeph. (a terra-cotta relief from Melos: Berliner Staatliche Museen 6803, Webster and Trendall, Illustrations III.1, 1 [p. 41]; an Attic red-figured skyphos: ARV2 1301, no. 5; CVA 8, pl. 351; Illustrations III.1, 2 [p. 41]; N. G. L. Hammond and Warren Moon, "Illustrations of Early Tragedy at Athens," AJA 82 [1978] 382-83, fig. 12) show stepped structures which are distinguishable as tombs only by the grave-steles that surmount them. Since the two structures differ significantly in appearance, however, it cannot be argued that either faithfully represents the tomb of Aeschylus' original production. For a detailed discussion of tomb-representations in vase-painting see Savas Gogos, "Das Buhnenrequisit in der griechischen Vasenmalerei II. Grabbau," Jahreshefte d. ost. arch. Inst. 55 (1984) 43-53. Gogos believes that tombs in the theater of the fourth and fifth centuries commonly were represented by a tomb-altar with a column, and he suggests tentatively that the same property could have served both as altar and as tomb (see esp. 43-45, 53). 4. As Arnott 1-41 insists. A case for a low raised stage is also made by Hourmouziades 58-74. I am more comfortable with the idea of a low stage, but the only material evidence I know for such a structure is the Attic red-figured chous of about 420 B.C. showing a comic Perseus cavorting on a stage (ARV2 1215, 1 = Phlyax Vases PH 1, illustrated in Bieber fig. 202). For bibliography see Phlyax Vases 20 and Richard Hamilton, "A New Interpretation of the Anauysos Chous," AJA 82 (1978) 385-87, who questions its value as evidence for a fifth-century raised stage. 5. I exclude Prometheus Bound from consideration here because of doubts about its date and authenticity. 6. See esp. Hammond, "Dramatic Production" 397-98, 409-10; D-R 33-35, 367-69 (Dorp feld). Ancient authorities for performers standing on the eleos or thymele are Pollux 4.123 and Etym. Magn. s.v. OvukXril. The likelihood that the first actor stood on a sacrificial table in the orchestra is discussed briefly in P-C, TDA 71 and P-C, Dith. 71, 86-88. Webster, P-C, Dith. 88n cites J. D. Beazley, JHS 59 (1939) 31 and Webster, Arch. Eph. 1953-54, 195 for representations of perfor mances on tables.</page><page sequence="4">POE: The Altar in the Fifth-Century Theater 119 86, 921), they take refuge at the altar. This, it seems to me, tells us two things. The more obvious is that this altar must have been a structure of fair size, since all the members of the chorus had to make physical contact with it.7 The size would seem to be confirmed by the word pagos8 and by the maidens' threat (457ff.) to hang themselves from the statues standing on it.9 The second thing that the chorus's access tells us is that in this play there is no definition, even of a vague general sort, of the area occupied by the chorus and the area occupied by the actors. The chorus move from altar to orchestra and back again. Soon after each of his entries Danaus apparently takes a position on the altar, while Pelasgus, like the Egyptian herald, almost certainly remains in the orchestra. This seemingly freer use of the Spielplatz by actors and chorus should be con nected with the observation made by Wilamowitz in 1886 that in none of Aeschy lus' extant plays before the Oresteia is there any clear indication of a scenic background.10 The implication is obvious: if there was no background and no segregation of actors and chorus, there is no compelling reason for locating the play's center of action, as almost everyone does, at the rear of the orchestra. The altar may, as Wilamowitz thought, have stood in the middle of the orchestra or may even have been situated on the eastern edge,1 where Hammond has 7. I cannot believe that it is necessary to assume a structure large enough to accommodate the whole chorus on top, as for instance Wilamowitz, Interpretationen 5 does. (See also A. M. Dale, Collected Papers 263; Hammond, "Dramatic Production" 417-18, 420-21; Albin Lesky, "Die Theophoroumene and die Buihne Menanders," Hermes 72 [1937] 126-27. Bethe's observation, "Spielplatz" 109, is right, that jndyov 3QOOit;Elv of 189 implies that the chorus sit not auf but an the structure. Nevertheless a xoLvo3wLcal (222) should be a structure of significant size. 8. It sometimes is argued that the pagos is not the altar proper, which would then be compara tively small. See Arnott 22, who wants the pagos to be his raised stage; F. Schmidt, De supplicum ad aram confugientium partibus scaenicis (diss. Konigsberg 1911) 8; C. Robert, "Die Scenerie des Aias, der Eirene, und des Prometheus," Hermes 31 (1896) 547. But in the context of dramatic production this must be an artificial distinction. It is clear from line 189 that the mound itself has a protective sanctity, and surely we should not imagine with Robert that a pile of earth was dumped in the middle of the orchestra. 9. Bethe, Prolegomena 91 thinks that this threat indicates that the height of the altar was considerable. Franz Stoessl, Die Hikatiden des Aischylos als geistesgeschichtliches und theater geschichtliches Handeln = Sitzungsb. d. osterr. Akad. d. Wiss., phil.-hist. Kl. 356 (Vienna 1979) 49 assumes, on the basis of lines 212-20, that there are only four statues-of Zeus, Apollo, Poseidon, and Hermes-and that Aeschylus is not concerning himself with any strict realism. 10. "Biihne" 606-11. This was taken for granted at the turn of the century by Dorpfeld (D-R 369-71), Reisch (D-R 195-200), and Bethe, Prolegomena 87-99, as well as by Frickenhaus 3-4, 74 and Flickinger, The Greek Theater and Its Drama (Chicago 19263) 65, 226. 11. I assume for most, if not all, of the tragedies of the fifth century Dorpfeld's circular orchestra (see D-R, Tafel III), whose diameter William Dinsmoor, "The Athenian Theater of the Fifth Century," Studies Presented to David M. Robinson (St. Louis, Mo. 1953) 2: 312-13, calculated at 25.5 meters. A shallower but somewhat wider rectilinear orchestra, proposed most recently by Egert Pohlmann, "Die Proedrie des Dionysostheater im 5. Jht. und das Biihnenspiel der Klassik," MH 38 (1981) 129-46 and "Philologie und Theater," Das neue Erlangen 61 (1983) 47-55, would make no difference to my arguments, but it seems to me even more speculative than Dorpfeld's circle. On the possibility of a rectilinear orchestra see also Carlo Anti and Luigi Polacco, Nuove ricerche sui teatri greci arcaici (Padua 1969) 127-59, esp. 157-59 and Elizabeth Gebhard, "The Form of the Orchestra in the Early Greek Theater," Hesperia 43 (1974) 428-40, esp. 429-34, 440.

Newiger.</page><page sequence="5">120 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 8/No. 1/April 1989 argued-attractively if not entirely convincingly-that a natural pagos in the form of a rock outcrop stood, perhaps until the "Periclean" reconstruction2 Of course the fact that no temple or dwelling plays any role in the earlier plays of Aeschylus does not necessarily mean that there was no skene on the south edge of the orchestra. In fact, both Bethe and Dale believe that the large altar/tomb of the early plays was the skene itself.13 This identification is, so far as I can see, based on nothing more than speculation; but it is true that an altar or tomb seems to be present in all three plays. The structure's presence is least certain in Seven, where no specific reference is made to an altar.'4 Nevertheless, there are here, as in Suppliants (463-65), several eQ@ETmr . . . jxoXLoooUov hEwov visible (185). And, as Wilamowitz pointed out,5 the entry of the chorus and its first exchange with Eteocles correspond closely to the beginning of Suppliants. Here too the members of the chorus, having with loud cries of trepidation taken refuge at the figures of the gods (95-96, 185-86), are persuaded by the king to withdraw from their place of supplication, after which they sing an ode (288 368). It seems reasonable therefore to conclude that here again we have a substantial structure representing a xoLvoPco)ia.16 The suspected presence of an altar in plays with quite different plots suggests that the altar served a purpose unrelated to the play's fictional situation. But was that purpose to disguise a skene? I think that we cannot be sure, on the evidence of three plays by one author, whether drama of this period employed a skene, but that we have good reasons to be skeptical. (1) In these three plays all entrances and exits, except for the appearance of Darius' ghost, are made through the parodoi. This being so, the south edge of the orchestra would appear to be an inconvenient place for a costume-building. (2) If the structure was in fact a building with a door it seems surprising that in none of the three plays does Aeschylus exploit it dramati cally as a building, making entrances and exits from it. In Persians the appearance of Darius' ghost has been taken as an indication that the tomb did stand on the orchestra's south edge, where it might well have been represented by the skene.17 It is true that such a location would have expe dited an unobserved approach by the actor playing this role. The same advantage 12. Hammond, "Dramatic Production," esp. 447-50; see fig. 2, p. 406. See also Siegfried Melchinger, Das Theater der Tragodie (Munich 1974) 82-111. Hammond's case is not so conclusive as M. L. West, "The Prometheus Trilogy," JHS 99 (1979) 135 and Dana Sutton, "The Date of Prometheus Bound," GRBS 24 (1983) 290, seem to feel. 13.

It has sometimes been thought, for instance by Wilamowitz, Interpretationen 72 and Ham mond, "Dramatic Production" 422, that the structure represented the Theban acropolis, onto which the chorus at 240 say they have come. But the orchestra itself, with the precipitous drop on its south edge, can very adequately have represented an acropolis. See Bethe, "Spielplatz" 110 and P-C, TDA 36. 15.

As Wilamowitz saw, the chorus do not sit in the council chamber at all, but only propose to do so. Suddenly at 150 the queen appears, and the suggestion to take counsel is forgotten.22 But if Taplin's argu ments against a scenic background here are based on a false premise, it is also true that the passage constitutes very fragile evidence for the existence of a building that neither comes into use nor is even mentioned in the play again. Even if evidence of the presence of such a scene-building in Persians were strong, it is not certain that from that fact we could draw conclusions about the location of Darius' tomb. It seems only natural to assume that a scenic back ground, as soon as it came into use, would have tended to draw the action to the rear of the orchestra. For this reason most English-speaking scholars seem to take for granted a conventional location center-stage for the altar/tomb, which in some plays is the focal point of the action.23 I shall argue below, however, that this assumption is not always justified: in some plays the altar stood either to one side of the orchestra or well forward toward the center. And if Darius' tomb was, as there is some reason to believe, relatively large (see above, p. 119 and n.7), it surely would have obscured any background before which it stood. THE ORESTEIA In Agamemnon the background is as clearly defined as in the earlier extant plays it is vague or uncertain. There is in this play, on the other hand, no monumental structure representing an altar or tomb. If, during the first ode, 18. "Dramatic Production" 410. 19. See W.

For Clytemnestra is so closely associated with the house that surely it would have been dramatically inept not to have her first appear from the door and remain standing before the palace. In fact neither lines 85-96 nor 261-62 warrant the assumption that Clytemnestra is sacrificing at the moment, and there certainly is no evidence in the text for the series of altars that sometimes is imagined (see Appendix A). Arnott argues that in the Oresteia there is only one altar visible, that it is on stage, and that the altar on which Clytemnestra (as he believes) sacrifices in Agamemnon is the same structure that, in Choephoroe, becomes Agamemnon's tomb.24 Such a change would have been intelligible to an audience only if tradi tion had established the convention of a stage-altar. Convention, moreover, would have provided the only conceivable motive for putting the tomb immedi ately at the house door. But we have seen that there is no evidence for a scenic background in Suppliants, which is to be dated sometime between 467 and 456.'25 Although other plays before and after may have had such a background, there is, I think, good reason to doubt that audiences before 456 had learned to expect a building with an altar in front of it to play a role in every tragedy. It therefore seems a likely guess that Agamemnon's tomb was not represented by an altar on stage but stood in, or to one side of, the orchestra. This guess is, I think, confirmed by the text of the play. As the play opens, Orestes and Pylades stand or kneel before the tomb, Orestes making an offering of two locks of his hair. Orestes' pious musings, however, are almost immedi ately (line 10) interrupted by the appearance in the distance of a throng of women. The two men conceal themselves (oTacOciev exrrobcov) after line 21. The parodos begins at line 22 and continues to line 83, by which time Electra obviously is standing before the altar. The first words of the chorus are iaXTrg Ex 66itov Fpav / xoag Qrot0ototuOrg' (22-23), and indeed, since they are accompa nied by Electra, the palace is their natural point of departure. Where, then, do Orestes and Pylades hide? The most likely place is around the corner of the tomb. But if either a stage-altar or the thymele in the center of the orchestra represented the tomb, such a place of concealment probably would be impossi ble; they would be too obviously visible to the chorus, who come out of the palace door and dance, if not around the thymele, surely on both sides of it. Hammond, who of course would like the tomb to be represented by his pagos, suggests that a likely place of concealment would be on the side of the pagos facing the audience.26 A similar position was long ago suggested by Reisch, who would have the two retreat down the parodos.27 Since, however, at line 212 Orestes appears abruptly before Electra, who is standing before the tomb, it is 24.

D-R 250.</page><page sequence="8">POE: The Altar in the Fifth-Century Theater 123 unlikely that they go far along the parodos.28 It seems to me that the side of the tomb, whether this is represented by the pagos or is an artificial structure, is the most likely place for them to hide. Taplin, who apparently assumes that the altar/tomb stands on the stage, adopts a solution, earlier proposed tentatively by Dale,29 which seems to me both clumsy and unnecessary. The skene, Taplin argues, does not at the begin ning of the play yet represent the palace. The scene "refocuses" only between 584, when Orestes leaves the tomb, and 653, when he returns to knock at the palace door. In the first half of Choephoroe, says Taplin, "all attention is on the tomb," and the chorus, who say that they are coming from the palace, actually appear from the parodos. This allows Orestes and Pylades, at the rear of the orchestra, to conceal themselves behind some piece of scenery or, very likely, in the doorway of the skene itself.30 Such a refocusing of scene is not impossible, but it presupposes that the focus at the beginning of the play is blurred. We should keep in mind that in the previous play the scene is unambiguously de fined. It is the front of the palace of Agamemnon. At the beginning of Choepho roe the audience see before them the same palace, clearly identifiable by the agyieus that has been so dramatically called to their attention at Agamemnon 1080 (see below, p. 135).31 The tomb does not encourage them to ignore the fact that the scenic background is identical. It is, rather, a dramatic new addition that emphasizes that all else is the same. Although, as Wilamowitz worried (n.29), this relative proximity of tomb and house does not reflect actual Greek usage, the audience cannot have failed to perceive its deeper reality. The entry of the chorus from the background is unusual but by no means unique, and nothing seems more likely than that Aeschylus should have experi mented in this way with the skene, from which not even actors enter in his earlier extant plays. Taplin professes to see a difficulty in the length of time required by Electra and the chorus, if they do come out of the skene door, to arrive at their destination32 (eleven lines from Orestes' announcement of their distant appear ance until his concealment, sixty-three additional lines of choral song). This, I think, is a rationalization of, rather than a reason for, his conjecture that they arrive through the parodos. Bodensteiner, after a detailed examination of the lapse of time in Greek drama between the announcement that a character has been sighted and his arrival in the Spielplatz, concludes that it varies between 4 28.

If in the first part of the play "all attention is on the tomb," there still is a problem with the "refocusing" of the second part of the play, for the tomb is not entirely forgotten.

Stagecraft 336.</page><page sequence="9">124 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 8/No. 1/April 1989 and 115 verses.33 In Euripides' Electra Orestes sees the heroine at verse 107; at 112 she begins to sing, but approaches the house and catches sight of the two men only at 215. It is true that this approach is through a parodos, but Electra must at line 112 be reasonably near to the edge of the orchestra. The heroine of Euripides' Helen requires fifty-six lines (330-85) to go from Proteus' tomb to the skene door. If the chorus of Choephoroe proceed through the palace door as they begin their song, their progress from stage to orchestra requires only seven lines more than Helen's (see below, p. 126), and some indeterminate but consid erable number of lines fewer than Electra's, from orchestra to stage. Even if the positioning of the tomb to one side of the orchestra is admitted to be the most convenient way to stage the opening scene of Choephoroe, it may nevertheless be objected that such a position would be ineffective dramatically. Thus Dale asserts that the tomb "must have had a central position; anything else is unthinkable for the grouping of the great xoo6S;, the centre-piece of the whole trilogy."34 It is true that the poet would have wanted to avoid anything that would have depreciated the importance of the tomb and of Electra's grief. But before we concede that it is unthinkable that centrality in importance should not have been indicated by centrality in space, we should remember that the Greek playwright had at his disposal a space that was very different from ours both in size and in shape. It is apparent that over the second half of the fifth century, after the play's setting came to be more clearly defined by the scene building centered at the rear of the orchestra, the action came to be more concentrated before this building. But even in Euripides significant action could take place out in the orchestra. At Iphigenia in Tauris 1068-70, for example, Iphigenia goes up to individual members of the chorus and, taking them by the hand, pleads for their cooperation. At 167-68 she turns to a member of the chorus (see 63-65) and asks for the urn from which she pours a libation to the brother who she is convinced is dead.35 We should not expect that at an earlier period Aeschylus would deliberately have turned his back on such a resource as the orchestra to confine his action to a small area at its rear.36 Again in Eumenides Aeschylus may well have facilitated a scene shift by shifting dramatic action to a different part of the Spielplatz. Orestes at 235ff. enters an empty orchestra to take refuge at the cult figure of Athena. The probability is very strong, as Taplin has shown, that this statue is standing, not on the stage that has recently represented the temple of Apollo, but somewhere in the orchestra.

The orchestra's space may also be exploited to dramatize not a change of location but a difference of position that is more than spatial. Thus Klaus Joerden has proposed that an altar or tomb may dramatize the opposition be tween the person taking refuge at it and the possessor of the house.38 Analo gously, if Agamemnon's tomb in Choephoroe stands on the periphery of the circle and to one side, that is, among other things, a visual symbol of his banish ment from the house that dominates the Spielplatz. ANDROMACHE, HELEN, IPHIGENIA IN TAURIS In Aeschylus' last play, Eumenides, there is a vagueness of location reminis cent of earlier tragedy. In each of the extant plays of Sophocles and Euripides, however, the setting is clearly defined by the skene, which, standing at the south edge of the orchestra, becomes the focal point of attention. For this reason most of the suppliant plays of which Euripides is so fond in some way subordinate the altar to the skene and the building that it represents. It is likely that in most, if not all, of these plays that altar/tomb stands closer to the skene than the tomb of Agamemnon does. Two plays in which the structures are not logically connected are Andromache and Helen. Each play contains expressions which have been thought to indicate spatial proximity, but in each, I think, there is evidence that the structure at which the heroine takes refuge did not stand directly before the door. In Andromache the door of the skene is the entrance to the house of Neoptolemus. The altar belongs not to the house but to a shrine of Thetis. Arnott, noting the phrase 660tov jragotxov (43), believes that it stood before the central door.39 What stood next to the house, however, was not just an altar but a temple (vao6 162, 66itog 130, 6itca 161, &amp;av6xoQov 43, 117). This temple must have been a visible property, for, as Hourmouziades points out, there is no good reason otherwise for the poet so specifically and repeatedly to have attested its existence.40 If the skene had only one door, perhaps the temple was repre sented by a painted canvas or panel on the wall,41 or even by a free-standing screen. In that case the altar will not have stood centrally before the scene building but before the temple facade. I can see no evidence to indicate how far 37. Stagecraft 386-87 and 386n.1.

Reisch thought that it would have been very near, since the play begins with Andro mache already seated at the altar. This tableau opening seemed to him to de mand a curtain, which he visualized as stretching from one paraskenion to the other.42 At line 1165 of Helen Theoclymenus enters from a parodos and greets the tomb of his father, adding that it was for this purpose that he buried him en' E66O1OL. Despite the phrase, most students of the play have recognized that the tomb cannot stand immediately before the door, at the front and center of the stage.43 Among the reasons given, two advanced by Richard Kannicht (ad 1165 68) seem particularly convincing. First, the long comic scene between Menelaus and the servant-woman (435-82) is played at the door, which therefore cannot be obscured by the tomb. Second, at 541-56 Menelaus attempts to intercept Helen coming from the house. Dale in her commentary ad 532-40 reconstructs the scene as follows: "At 540 she turns to go to the tomb, and Menelaus steps forward to intercept and speak to her. She tries to dodge him with little runs, till her accusation 550-52 makes him step back haughtily; then she skips around him and reaches her goal at 556." The scene, as Kannicht says, would be unplayable if the tomb stood too near to the door. We can be reasonably confident, more over, that the tomb did not stand forward from the door toward the center of the orchestra. For such a location would require the members of the chorus, who precede Helen out of the palace, to pass within a few feet of Menelaus without noticing him. Menelaus' place of concealment must be the tomb (as it is at 1203), since he appears suddenly to Helen, standing between her and this place of refuge. This tomb, therefore, like the tomb of Choephoroe, probably stands to one side of the playing area. I can see no evidence to indicate how far from the door the tomb is located.44 Reisch's conjecture that it stands near to a parodos puts too much weight on the fact that Theoclymenus directs his first words to it.45 And it probably means little that Helen requires fifty-six verses to go from the tomb to the door (330-85),46 for she accomplishes her return in thirty (527-56). I think that we can say only that it was far enough removed to allow a free view of a tableau of at least three 42. D-R 252-54. See also Bethe, Prolegomena 194-95. 43. D-R (Reisch) 251; A. M.

That Theoclymenus fails until eleven lines after his arrival to remark that Helen is no longer at the tomb (1177) or to notice Menelaus viYoJntltag Taqrcp until Helen points him out at 1203 tells us nothing, for we do not know where Theoclymenus is standing. Similarly, when Teucer arrives from the parodos, he suddenly (xa, 71) notices Helen sitting at the tomb only after three lines of admiring description of the palace. Such momentary "partial vision" on the part of an arriving character is, however, a Euripidean convention and tells us nothing about Helen's proximity to the palace. See Donald J.

At 865 Theonoe emerges through the door and, before taking notice of Helen sitting at the tomb, addresses eight lines to two attendants who are bearing torches.47 Dale proposes on the basis of no evidence that the tomb in Helen is on stage just to one side of the skene door.48 A similar location for the altar of Iphigenia in Tauris seems to be indicated on a fourth-century south Italian vase.49 Webster suggests that this was a fixed position for theatrical altars, at least by about 350.50 Even if that is right, it tells us nothing, of course, about fifth-century practice. But the painting's reliability as a representation even of a fourth-century produc tion is questionable. The position of the altar may well be dictated by a problem of composition. If the altar were placed centrally, Artemis, who is sitting on it, would obscure Iphigenia and the small image of the goddess standing in the aedicula. Lines 167-68 of the play have, on the other hand, been thought to show that the altar is in the orchestra.5 Here Iphigenia asks an attendant, who must be a member of the chorus (63-65), to hand her the golden ewer, from which she then pours a libation to the shade of Orestes. Iphigenia probably is in the orchestra, as she is at 1068-70 (see above, p. 00), and it may be that she stands before the altar of the Taurian Artemis to pour the libation, but we cannot be sure that this is so. HERACLES AND SUPPLIANTS Another play in which the altar is not directly related to the building repre sented by the skene is Heracles. The altar of Zeus Soter, on which Amphitryon, Megara, and the three children seek refuge from Lycus, has to be one of reason ably large size, for here the threat is immediate, and all must have direct contact with the altar. A position immediately in front of the door seems unlikely, and Reisch's location of this altar to the side between the skene and the parodos may be right.52 We should not exclude the possibility, however, that the altar occu pied a position in the axis of the skene far enough forward to allow the door, and the ekkyklema, to be seen by people in the lowest seats. The suppliants, who at the play's opening are gathered at the altar, become convinced that Lycus will not respect their right of asylum, give up hope, and request the opportunity to dress themselves suitably for death. Amphitryon reproaches Zeus for having failed in his duty to help them (339-47), and they abandon the altar to go into the house. At the end of the following choral ode, 47. Bodensteiner (715) believes that it is significant that Helen can convincingly speak seven lines, which Theonoe is not supposed to overhear, after she notices (858) that Theonoe is coming out. At 858, however, Helen only hears a noise at the door, and we cannot tell precisely when Theonoe emerges. 48. Commentary 69. 49. T&amp;SP TV 5; P-C, TDA fig. 16. 50. "Staging and Scenery" 506. 51.

It is probable, although not subject to certain proof, that they proceed into the orchestra, for when Heracles arrives at 525 he sees his wife, children, and father surrounded by the chorus (6oXp. .. . . avgb&amp;v).53 If they do move away from the skene into the orchestra, what can be their destination? The most dramatically effective place for them to wait for death would be at the altar of Zeus the Savior, and this staging seems to be indicated by Amphitryon's final desperate prayer to Zeus (497-502). Reisch maintained that a position for the altar forward in the orchestra would be un likely in a period when people were "long accustomed" to see the action take place immediately before the skene.54 But, as we shall see, Suppliants proves that Euripidean actors could enter the orchestra, speak, and exit without ap proaching the stage. Suppliants opens with a tableau showing Aethra, the queen mother, seated at the altar surrounded by the chorus, who represent the mothers of the Seven (32-36, 94-96), while the despairing Adrastus lies at the temple door (22, 104) with the children of the dead men around him (106-7). Here I think we can confidently follow Reisch in assuming that this altar could not have stood just before the door. If convention had required such a location for the altar, it is impossible to believe that Euripides would have positioned Adrastus where his prostrate grief certainly would have been hidden from view, or that he would have added eight people (Adrastus and seven children) to a small area of the stage already overcrowded by Aethra and a chorus of fifteen. That does not, however, mean that we have to imagine an altar displaced to the side "nahe an dem Proskenion."55 In fact, evidence is strong that this altar's location was somewhere in the orchestra. That the chorus was gathered at the altar does not necessarily prove anything. Collard, indeed, believes that the chorus was on the stage. This, how ever, would have meant that the chorus had to leave the altar and the stage to sing and dance the "parodos" (42-86),56 which is a supplication of Aethra. If this happened it must have struck the Athenian audience as a strange mode of supplication. For the essence of the act of supplication, as John Gould has shown, is the establishment of physical contact. "The suppliant comes forward with his hands empty and outstretched, and adopts a physical posture of inferior ity towards the object of his supplication."57 It is clear that this is what the suppliants do, bending to touch Aethra's knee (QlO;g y6vv niTovoca TO o6v, 44), 53. P-C, TDA 57 and Wilamowitz, commentary (Berlin 1889) ad 529 take this as evidence that there was no raised stage and seem to picture the chorus approaching the suppliants, who remain near the door.

Surely this would have been a circular dance (see above, p. 00), with the members of the chorus abasing themselves successively before the seated Aethra. Similarly, when in their next ode they supplicate Theseus, they go very near to him and touch his knees ((3d0l xai &amp;avtaoov yovadTov 1T XECyLQa PaXoiioa, 272; see also 278-81, 284-85). It is very hard to believe that there would have been room enough for these dances unless the altar was removed at least a little distance into the orchestra.58 Theseus' failure to continue on to the stage after he entered the orchestra is explainable by his mother's presence on the altar. ION Another altar which has been thought to be in the orchestra is the altar upon which Creusa after line 1255 takes refuge from Ion's wrath. According to Wilamowitz, this was a great altar, decorated with statues, which needed to stand deep enough in the orchestra to allow the actors to be fully visible.59 The evidence for the statues is fairly weak. At 1402-3, when Creusa, in her joy at having discovered the secret of Ion's birth, leaves the altar and runs to him, Ion exclaims, Xcaro /I P[o 3t XuklroOa 6?ava. Wilamowitz did not base his estimate of the altar's size solely on the evidence of these lines, however. Before the Apollo-temple at Delphi, at a distance of about 13.5 meters, did stand the massive Chian altar. Since Euripides should have expected a large number of his audience to know about, if not to have seen, this altar, it is not unlikely that Creusa's altar was large and did stand in the orchestra.60 An often quoted passage, 226-29, would show conclusively that the altar stood in the orchestra if we could be sure of what the word fhvutFXl means here: Ei TLEv 6aoctxc JeXavOv JTQe 66cov xai TL t ZvO0oh XQ'Itece ,:oio3ov, JaEQLT' eg Ov[AtEag-' E: 6'&amp;aoqpaXTOl Fn1XOLoL 66tcoWv At jdgQLT' eg FWvXv. In three other passages (46, 114, 161) the word thymele seems to be used in a sense peculiar to this play and perhaps peculiar to Delphi. Almost certainly in 114 and 161 it refers to the outside of the temple, the stylobate, and perhaps it may refer to 58. Collard (supra n.23) 1:18, and ad 71-72 has refuted the idea that this ode is sung by a split chorus, allowing the mothers of the Seven to remain at the altar, not dancing at all, while the other half-chorus, whether they represent handmaids or mothers of other fallen warriors, sing and dance the last strophe and antistrophe (71-86). See, as representatives of the theory of the split chorus, Joseph Lammers, Die Doppel- und Halbchore in der antiken Tragodie (diss. Monster, Paderborn 1931) 94-95, and, more recently, Wesley Smith, "Expressive Form in Euripides' Suppliants," HSCP 71 (1966) 156-57. 59. Euripides Ion (Berlin 1926) 23. 60. A. S. Owen, commentary (Oxford 1939) ad 1258 assumes that the altar stands on the stage, even though it represents the Chian altar.</page><page sequence="15">130 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 8/No. 1/April 1989 the temple as a whole.61 If that is true here as well, then the altar at which the pelanos, or sacred cake, is to be offered-presumably that at which Creusa takes refuge-must stand before the stylobate, in the orchestra.62 It is possible, how ever, that in line 228 thymelai has its more usual meaning of "altar." Thus Georges Roux believes that the thymele is the altar where the animal sacrifice is to be made, and that it stands within the temple.63 (We know from the account of Neoptolemus' murder in Andromache [1111-17] that blood sacrifice was made within the temple.)64 Ion could, according to this interpretation of thymele, be telling the chorus to offer the pelanos on an altar standing on the stylobate-that is, on stage.65 I think therefore we have to conclude that the evidence should lead us to suspect that the altar of Ion stood in the orchestra, but that this evidence is too slight and too problematic to warrant a claim of certainty. II If Euripides did put the altar of Ion on stage, ignoring the actual location of the altar in front of Apollo's temple at Delphi, his motive is not easy to see. He is not likely to have done so in deference to convention, for the passages that we have examined so far show, first, that the altar/tomb probably had no fixed position and, second, that some altars and tombs almost certainly stood some where in the orchestra. This does not mean that an altar never stood on stage. As we have seen, the altar of Andromache and the tomb of Helen may have been placed on stage, although the text of neither play gives us particular reason to believe that this was so. And Pollux 4.123 tells us explicitly that at least one kind of altar, the agyieus, was located immediately before the door: eti 6e Tflg oxnvrg .. . aynlEV i EXELTO logC 0 TQO TCOV vhQSpOV.

Gow, "On the Meaning of the Word Ove.XBr," JHS 32 (1912) 213-38, asserts that thymele in Ion refers to the hearth of Apollo in the cella of the temple, but his argument seems to me to be very strained. 62. H. W. Parke and D. E. W. Wormell, The Delphic Oracle (Oxford 1956) 32, believe that the pelanos was offered outside at the large altar. 63.

Pausanias 10.24.4 speaks of a hestia of Apollo in the naos of the temple, at which Neoptolemus, about to sacrifice, was killed. 65. There is, however, no indication in the text of the play that the altar may have stood on the stage. At 1275-76 Ion tells Creusa that neither the altar nor the house of Apollo will save her, but that does not necessarily mean that the altar at which she is sitting is on the steps of the temple. In any case, the authenticity of 1275-76 has been questioned by James Diggle, "On the 'Heracles' and 'Ion' of Euripides," PCPhS 20 (1974) 28-30. See also David Bain, "Euripides, Ion 1261-81," CQ 29 (1979) 263-67. At line 1309 Creusa implies that if she is killed it will be Evrog &amp;a6cuov 63v6E, but that has to be interpreted as rhetorical exaggeration. Wherever she is, she is not within the adyton. Winnington-Ingram suggests that during the altar scene the action is to be conceived as taking place not outside but inside the temple. Since, however, up to this point outside and inside have been very clearly defined, that suggestion is not persuasive.</page><page sequence="16">POE: The Altar in the Fifth-Century Theater 131 the skene, orchestra, proskenion, and paraskenia, this testimony seems to imply that the altar too was a permanent fixture. It is true that Pollux' source probably is Hellenistic66 and that the passage refers to a period after the stage was raised. Nevertheless, the relatively large number of passages, in extant drama and in fragments,7 which reflect the presence of an agyieus has encouraged the belief that the altar was a conventional stage property by the later fourth century, if not before.68 A passage in Thesmophoriazusae convinced Wilamowitz that this was true by the time of Aristophanes. In this play there is a change of scene at about line 278. To that point the action takes place before the house of Agathon; thereafter, at the Thesmophorion. How the change was staged is uncertain,69 but that need not concern us here. At line 285 Mnesilochus, disguised as a woman, makes an offering to the two goddesses, presumably at an altar. It is almost certainly to this altar, for whose location there is no evidence, that Mnesilochus runs for refuge after having snatched up the "child" at 688 (OEotocqpoQEiov TOlTOyi, 880). At 748 he swears a conventional oath, ita TO6 'Ao6ko TOVTovi. Wilamowitz thought that this passage indicated that the practice of representing the agyieus on stage was so firmly established that it could appear even in front of the Thesmophorion,70 but this misses the point of the joke. The agyieus to which Mnesilochus points is standing by the door which was earlier the entrance to Agathon's house. Mnesilochus should, of course, no longer be able to see the agyieus, which represents a different location, and the wit lies in the breaking of the dramatic illusion. Line 748 therefore seems to indicate that the agyieus could not stand in front of a shrine or temple but that it probably did serve as a conventional sign that the skene represented a dwelling. 66. E. Rohde, De Julii Pollucis in Apparatu Scaenico Enarrando Fontibus (Leipzig 1870), argued that the source for Pollux' section on the theater was Aristophanes of Byzantium through Juba's Theatrike Historia.

To this evidence we may add the made-up story of Mnesi lochus, who is disguised as a woman, that (s)he slipped out of the house tag&amp; T6v 'AyvLd for a tryst (Thesm. 488-89). If the stage arrangement reflected Attic custom, probably the agyieus stood "before" the door to one side, adjacent or near to the front wall of the building, like the house-altars discovered at Delos.72 On the other hand, the evidence of drama offers only limited support for Pollux' testimony that the agyieus was an altar. Only one citation (discounting the late evidence from Plautus and Terence) uses a word meaning "altar" (Sopho cles fr. 370 Pearson: &amp;ayveiSg PoAO6g). It is apparent, however, that at OT 919 20, Sophocles Electra 637-38, and Euripides Electra 216-17, altars of Apollo are present on the stage. And outside of drama the tradition that the agyieus was an altar is very clear. Aside from our passage from Pollux, which seems to say that it was a stage-altar, we have explicit statements in Harpocration s.v. &amp;ayvlg, Suidas s.v. &amp;ayvUa, Photius Lexicon s.v. &amp;yvlcg, and Hesychius s.v. &amp;yvuLSg, as well as supporting evidence in Photius Lexicon s.v. Aotias and Helladius apud Photius Bibliotheca 535b (see below). Nevertheless, it has often been doubted that the altar itself could have been the agyieus. For there is ample evidence, both literary and archaeological, that the agyieus was a pointed column.73 As we can see from Harpocration's definition of the agyieus, which is closely paralleled by the testimony of Suidas and Photius Lexicon s.v. &amp;yvlag, the apparently contradictory traditions puzzled the ancient lexicographers as much as they puzzle scholars today: cayMEvtL 6 EaoT xicv eig 6Oi) kiyov, 6v LOTaOL JTQO TC)V OVQo)V, d; oa(ieg JTOLOVOlV 'AO.toTo Yv;ng TE EV d)m]l xac EiToXlg .... )aoil 8' 71.

Harpocration, after defining the agyieus as a pointed column, then suggests rather tentatively that nacQa Tolg 'ACTLxoLg (whatever the precise meaning of that phrase may be) it was an altar. The distinction between Dorian and Athe nian cannot, however, be trustworthy, because Harpocration, saying that the agyieus was a pointed column, cites as his witnesses Aristophanes and Eupolis. The phrase naga ToLg 'ATTLXOI; must therefore represent a clumsy attempt by the source which obviously is common to the three passages to reconcile what he considered to be a conflict. It was nevertheless taken at face value by Farnell,74 who conflated it with a statement of Helladius (see below) and proposed that in Athens the agyieus was a "rounded stone of altar shape." Helladius, however, explicitly distinguishes his round altar from the agyieus. The solution of the agyieus as a round altar, attractive as it may seem, is therefore entirely a modern invention. One ancient source, Hesychius s.v. ayvtlvg, says flatly that the altar and the column are the same: 6 nro TCOV uVQo-v Eoatbg 3Co)6R; EV OX/laQTL xiovog. This has been accepted by a few scholars, notably Nilsson and DeVisser,75 but be cause of the difficulty of imagining a suitable horizontal surface for offerings,76 it often has been vehemently rejected. The altar, whose correct name was ayvle/u; P3owt6g, Reisch tells us, was often called atyvtevg for short. It may sometimes have replaced the agyieus, but it was not the holy stone itself: "Sehr mit Unrecht hat man daher diese Spitzsteine auf Grund einer unklaren Nachricht bei Hesychios . . . mit den anderweitig bezeugten Strassenaltaren... identifi ciert."77 "An unclear notice in Hesychius" is unfair. The tradition represented by Harpocration says, albeit somewhat tentatively, that in Athens (or in Attic drama?) the agyieus was the altar. And, as we shall see, this identification is supported by Helladius and by still another passage from Photius. The separa tion of altar and agyieus, on the other hand, is attested by only one authority, Helladius apud Photius Biblio 74. L. R. Farnell, The Cults of the Greek States 4 (Oxford 1907) 149. 75. Nilsson (supra n.70) 1:203; DeVisser 67; see also E. Saglio, Daremberg-Saglio 1:168-69 s.v. Agyieus. 76. Rhomaios (supra n.73) 212 suggested that the truncated top of the archaic agyieus from Corcyra was intended for the reception of offerings. Nilsson 1:203 seconded this but was uncertain enough to propose that to meet this need the stone was doubled, creating an altar before the column. DeVisser 67-68 earlier had suggested that the agyieus may have had a flat top, but he also pointed out that the Ambracian coins (see supra n.73) show the agyieus standing on a broad basis, which may have served as an altar. 77. Reisch, "Agyieus" 912. More recently A. W. Gomme and F. H. Sandbach, Menander: A Commentary (Oxford 1971) ad Dyscolus 659 have asserted that "[t]he statement of Hesychios . .. that the altar had the shape of a column deserves no credit." See also D. M.

But even if lexicographical testimony seems quite clearly to identify the agyieus-altar and the conical agyieus-figure, is it still possible that on the Athe nian stage the figure was represented by an ordinary sacrificial altar? Pollux 4.123 probably implies that all dramatic altars were the same; but in the same sentence he also seems to imply that they all were on stage and that they all were called agyieus, both of which we know to have been untrue of the period when the extant tragedies were written. What Pollux says about the agyieus, therefore, is not likely to be relevant to the fifth-century theater. What we can accept in Pollux' testimony, however, and what seems to be corroborated by archaeologi cal evidence, is that later the stage agyieus lost its distinctive appearance. For instance, a terra-cotta relief of the late first century, found in various fragmen tary versions,79 shows a slave sitting on a quadrangular altar which stands on the stage. The altar does not have to be one devoted to Apollo Agyieus, since this is a Roman theater and the altar can be nowhere else. As early as the fourth century, however, quadrangular and round altars standing on the stage (or, if the stage is not depicted, immediately before the house) are to be found illustrated on Phlyax vases.80 These tell us nothing reliable about the tragedians' practice or even Menander's, since the relationship between the native south Italian drama 78.

It is quite possible that the house-altar already had lost its pointed column as Athenian drama spread to other parts of Greece. Such an adaptation could well have taken place at Delos, for example, an important center for Hellenistic drama where numerous quadrangular altars have been found beside house doors.83 The possibility, however, seems very remote that such an altar could have represented the agyieus in the fifth century; for the agyieus makes an appear ance, playing an important dramatic role, comparatively early-certainly long before such an artificial convention could have been established. It is, I think, a reasonable guess that the first play to display the agyieus was Agamemnon, since that is the first extant play to represent the background to the action as a house. When Cassandra, about to enter the palace, finally breaks her silence at Aga memnon 1080ff. to cry out, "Antokkov, "Aokk.ov, adyUdT', / &amp;aco6YXv iF60g / adJteoc g yaQ oi ,U6Xt; TO 6E1EEQov, it is a moment of great dramatic tension. It would have been perfectly appropriate for Cassandra, even if she had not been standing before the palace door, to cry out at this critical moment, "Apollo my destroyer! . ." Without the word ayvlaT' lines 1080-82 would be full of mean ing. In this play, however, the reference to Agyieus is particularly appropriate, for in the Oresteia Apollo plays a double role, as destroyer of Cassandra and as protector of the house in which she will meet her death. It is very hard to believe that this agyieus, to which Aeschylus deliberately calls attention, was not some thing distinctive and immediately recognizable to the audience. This will have been the protective figure that the spectators were accustomed to see in front of the houses of their city. Could Aeschylus' audience have been accustomed to seeing agyieus altars either standing alone or standing beside a pointed column84-which had the 81. T. B. L. Webster, "South Italian Vases and Attic Drama," CQ 42 (1948) 15-27, asserts that the influence of Athenian drama was strong, and a great deal is to be learned about Middle Comedy from Phlyax vases. 82. But see Webster, "South Italian" 18, who points to the evidence of the Attic red-figure vase, ARV2 1215, 1 = Phlyax Vases PH 1. Webster's interpretation of the evidence of this vase is questioned by Hamilton (supra n.4) 385-87. Some theaters outside of Athens (e.g., Delphi, Epidaurus, perhaps Eretria) seem to have had a raised stage by the late fourth century. See G. M. Sifakis, Studies in the History of Hellenistic Drama (London 1967) 106-9; P-C, TDA 198-99, 204. 83. Bulard (supra n.72) 7-20. 84. Reisch, "Agyieus" 911, believed that the agyieus on the Attic stage was an anthropomor phic figure, but anthropomorphic representations of Apollo Agyieus seem to have been very rare. Only one certain example from the pre-Roman period given by Filippo Balestrazzi is a relief from Cyrene which she dates ca. 300-277 ([supra n.73] no. 28; see II:1, 330, 332). Reisch cites two statue bases, IG II2 4850 and CIA 175, as well as Pausanias 8.53.3 and 10, who speaks of four agalmata of</page><page sequence="21">136 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 8/No. 1/April 1989 same shape as "andere fur Brandopfer bestimmte Altare"?85 If so, it is per haps not inconceivable that what Cassandra addresses is a theatrical altar which is recognizable by its peculiar position in relation to the skene door rather than by its shape. But we have seen that the literary evidence for such a conven tional, free-standing altar is very questionable; and the archaeological evidence is hardly more persuasive. Conventional rectangular altars dedicated to this god, if they existed at all, must have been exceptional, for there are, to my knowledge, only two certain examples, both of which belong to the imperial period.86 On the other hand, there is a good deal of archaeological evidence which seems consistent with Hesychius' definition of the agyieus as an "altar in the shape of a column". Filippo Balestrazzi's recent study of the agyieus has shown that it was not merely a conical column or pillar. It characteristically had a more or less broad flat base, either rectangular or circular; in several of her examples this base is doubled.87 This base could well have served-a possibility suggested by DeVisser at the turn of the century88-as the altar on which incense was burned (Sophocles fr. 370 Pearson) or nadyxaQna (Sophocles Electra 634-38) were offered. It is true that Filippo Balestrazzi's earliest examples date from the first half of the fourth century, except for a fragmentary archaic agyieus from Cyrene (her no. 8; see above, n.76). Fortunately, however, we know a good deal about the colossal statue of Apollo, dating from the seventh or the early sixth century, which stood over the grave of Hyacinth at Amyclae.89 This statue, which had a body in the form of a pillar or column with head and arms above, rested on a broad base analogous to that of the agyieus' pointed column. The base had, according to Pausanias 3.19.3, a P3owto oxafacc.90 If the base of this archaic Apollo-figure could be described as "shaped like an altar," surely we are justified in assuming that the agyieus of the fifth century had a base similar to that of its fourth-century and Hellenistic representations. Apollo Agyieus. The bases, however, can have supported the aniconic column just as well as a statue. And the word agalma is not infrequently used of nonrepresentational wooden and stone figures (DeVisser 22, 62, 71, 109-10 with citations). Two scholiastic notices, ad Phoen. 631 and ad Wasps 875, indicate that an "agalma" of Apollo stood before Athenian houses. Clearly the second of the two meant by "agalma" a figure of human form; but he is confused, since he imagines the conical stone as a support for the statue. 85. Reisch, "Agyieus" 912-13. 86.

But this tells us nothing reliable about the location of other altars. For the position of the agyieus near the house-door, which probably re flected that of real agyieus-altars, may well have been as distinctive as the agyieus' shape. There is no reason to think that that became a conventional location for other altars such as the "Chian" altar in Ion, whose appearance will have been very different. The agyieus-altar's distinctive shape argues strongly, if not conclusively, against the notion that the altar was a fixed, conventional theatrical property. It is true that frequent mention, in extant plays and in fragments, of Apollo Agyieus and of altars of Apollo makes it clear that the agyieus was a common piece of stage furniture even in the fifth century. But there is no real evidence that the agyieus ever stood on stage except in plays in which the skene represented a house or palace. It may not be impossible to imagine that a permanent altar, which was, for some undetermined reason, a conventional property of the theater and in some plays had no dramatic meaning at all, was modified for mimetic purposes, in Agamemnon and subsequently in other plays, so as schematically to represent a recognizable agyieus. It is a far more efficient hypothesis, however, that it was the agyieus' special shape, which made it a simple but clear token of a house, that established its conventionality, and that, if there was a permanent altar in the playing area, the agyieus had nothing to do with it. This hypothesis is supported by indications that certain altars and tombs could not have been represented by any structure that would have represented the agyieus. First, a few such structures, such as the altars of supplication in Euripides' Suppliants and Heracles and the tombs in Helen and Choephoroe, must have stood well away from the skene door, either forward in the orchestra or well to one side. Second, certainly Demeter's altar in Thesmophoriazusae and probably the tomb in Choephoroe shared the playing area with an agyieus. And third, certain altars at which several persons take refuge from danger will have been much larger than an agyieus. It would be wrong to assert unconditionally, on the basis of the evidence that we have considered, that altars and tombs were temporary structures erected to suit the dramatic needs of individual plays. For it is perhaps not impossible to imagine that such a permanent theatrical property stood at some point well away from the door, even though we have seen indications of variation in size and location that make this seem unlikely. What we can assert is that no sober argument for a permanent structure can take into account dramatic references to the agyieus; and that without the support of these references such an argument can hardly stand. Tulane University APPENDIX A Visions of a Spielplatz lavishly outfitted with altars mostly belong to another period of scholarship, whose conception of Greek dramatic production was more</page><page sequence="23">138 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 8/No. 1/April 1989 spectacular than ours today. Eugen Petersen, Die attische Tragodie als Bild- und Buhnenkunst (Bonn 1915) 582-83, for instance, pictures Clytemnestra between lines 83 and 264 of Agamemnon proceeding silently across the stage, from one altar to another, lighting offerings. See also G. Murray, Aeschylus (Oxford 1940) 209. Even Wilamowitz, with his sure ear for exactly what the text does and does not say, imagined for Aeschylus' Suppliants (Interpretationen 6) a pagos sur rounded by "many altars." Contemporary views tend to be more conservative, but in 1967 Joachim Dingel (52) could assert that usually several altars were erected simultaneously. The most likely references to the presence of more than one altar occur at OT 16 and Euripides Supp. 33 and 290, but these may well have been poetic plurals. Twin altars may have stood before the skene in Supp., imitating the twin altars of Demeter and Kore referred to by an inscription of 446-40. See K. Kourouniatis, Eleusiniaka 1 (1937) 176 and 179, lines 16-17. (George M. Mylonas, Eleusis and the Eleusinian Mysteries [Princeton 1961] 90-91, also refers to IG II2 1672, lines 140-41.) Agam. 88-91 and Alc. 133-34 refer to altars which, despite Dingel 55, need not have been visible. Even when Polyneices at Phoen. 604 calls upon the feiv PCO)[i IaTQOgcWWv, it is not likely that he points to anything visible, for at line 606 he also calls on the temples. Similarly at OC 756 Creon exclaims Q6O;g fteCv x3caTQiov, whose statues or altars are of course not part of the scenic background. The only possible archaeological evidence for a display of altars in the playing area is an Attic black-figure lekythos (Athens N.M. 18606), dated by S. Karouzou, RA (1972) 195-96, 203, to ca. 470, which shows six bearded men sitting on three altars. There is, however, nothing to confirm the assertion of N. G. L. Hammond and Warren Moon, "Illustrations of Early Tragedy at Athens," AJA 82 (1978) 380-81, that the scene has anything to do with drama. The advocates of a permanent altar are naturally disposed to believe that there was only one (but see Reisch in D-R 249-50). So Arnott 46-47 takes it for granted that the altar at the beginning of OT and the altar at 919 are the same. Webster, Introduction to Menander (Manchester 1974) 81, asserts that the altar in Dyscolus does "double-duty"; it is the agyieus which is called upon at 659 and the altar at which he claims-very dubiously-that Sico pours a libation at 622. In fact, it is remarkable how seldom in Greek drama the use of two altars comes into question. APPENDIX B The assertion often is made that the thymele's sacred character would have made its use as a stage prop "unseemly" (Arnott's word, 45; see also, for in stance, P-C, TDA 131, Hourmouziades 75). But, as Kamerbeek in his review of Arnott's book pointed out (Mnemosyne 16 [1963] 410-12), there is no real evidence to justify such certainty. The question is complicated by the suggestion</page><page sequence="24">POE: The Altar in the Fifth-Century Theater 139 that the word thymele, in its theatrical use, did not refer to an altar at all and by doubts on other grounds that an altar stood in the middle of the orchestra. On the meaning of thymele see Carl Robert, "Zur Theaterfrage," Hermes 32 (1897) 439-53; 0. Navarre, Daremberg-Saglio s.v. "Thymele"; contra C. Robert see F. Robert, Thymele (Paris 1939) 261-62. On the question of an altar in the orches tra see Andreas Rumpf, "Attische Feste-attische Vasen," BJ 161 (1961) 212; Fensterbusch, RE VI.2 (1936) 703, s.v. "Thymele"; A. von Gerkan and W. Muller-Weiner, Das Theatron von Epidauros (Stuttgart 1961) 7-8. Even Dorp feld, who argues strongly that the literary evidence, conveniently collected by Reisch in D-R 278-80, leaves no doubt of the existence of the thymele (D-R 33; see also "Thymele" 249-57), believes that the thymele was situated in different places in different plays ("Thymele" 256). Neither the early fifth-century Attic red-figure column krater showing dancers at an altar behind which stands a figure of Dionysus (Basel Inv. 415 [ca. 500-480 B.C.]: E.

But the former at least is unquestionably a choral dance, and, as Froning 23-24 says, the outstretched arms, which indicate lamentation, speak strongly for tragedy. (She concludes that it is "much less problematic" to interpret this as a tragic chorus than as a dithyrambic chorus [25].) Simon, Theater 18, asserts that "Wegen der deutlich angegebenen Kinnlinien sind es ganz Masken, zu denen wir die Dia deme und die Haare zu rechnen haben." In any case, if it is at least established that the nondramatic chorus danced around an altar, it seems unlikely to me that this altar would easily have disappeared from dramatic productions. The altar may, however, as Dorpfeld thought, have been shifted around for dramatic purposes and may thus have lost its earlier significance.</page></plain_text>
