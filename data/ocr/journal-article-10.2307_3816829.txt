<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ambrose Bierce, John Camden Hotten, The Fiend's Delight, and Nuggets and Dust* By M. E. GRENANDER AMONG THE RARITIES of American literature are two little books by ?1 "Dod Grile" which were published in London: one, The Fiend's Delight,' by John Camden Hotten at 74 &amp; 75 Piccadilly; the other, Nuggets and Dust,2 by Chatto and Wmdus as successors to Hotten. "Dod Grile" of course, was the well-known California journalist, Ambrose Gwinett Bierce, quondam Town Crier of the San Francisco News Letter and California Advertiser. FD and ND, undated on their title pages, are incorrectly assigned to I872 by both Vincent Starrett and Joseph Gaer3 in their Bierce bibliographies. Moreover, ND is sometimes listed in dealers' catalogs as Bierce's first book; actually it was preceded by FD. Halkett and Laing's Dictionary of Anonymous and Pseudonymous Literature gives the correct date, I873, for FD, but identifies Dod Grile as "M. H. Bierce" (a ghost who can be laid permanently to rest) and does not list ND at all.4 Certain things are clearly wrong in this array of misinformation. Since the Preface to ND refers to an earlier book by Dod Grile, and 1 should like to record here my gratitude to the Carl and Lily Pforzheimer Foun- dation and to the Research Foundation of State University of New York for fellow- ship grants which made this study possible; I also wish to extend my thanks to the staffs of the Carl H. Pforzheimer Library and the Bancroft Library of the University of California at Berkeley for courtesies rendered. I am compiling a new edition of the letters of Ambrose Bierce and should appreciate hearing from anyone who knows of the existence of such letters, particularly those in private hands. 'Octavo.

Both these errata have been cleared up by Jacob Blanck, in Volume I of his authoritative Bibliography of American Literature.5 There is, never- theless, cause for bafflement on the part of bibliographers and dealers concerning these two books. Both advertise, following their pages of text, "very important new books" for 1873; ND, moreover, was advertised in the autumn of 1872, prior to the publication of FD. Bierce himself, years after the event when his recollection of the books was hazy, wrote that FD had been published in 1872.6 And heretofore the only facts concerning his relationship with Hotten, who published FD and who, at his death, had ND ready for the press, have been those drawn from the autobiographical "A Sole Surviv- or"'7 The information in this fragment, however, is meager, and deals only with Bierce's bad luck-or poor judgment-in not getting a post- dated check cashed quickly enough after Hotten's demise. Hence it is not surprising that errors about Bierce's earliest book publications should be in circulation. But a collection of letters to Bierce from Hotten and other Englishmen, now owned by the Carl H. Pforz- heimer Library, reveals the tangled publishing history of FD and ND, establishes their sequence, permits them to be accurately dated, and sheds new light on the relations between the two men.8 Bierce had gone to England in the late spring of 1872 with his bride, the beautiful San Francisco heiress Mollie Day, to try his 5New Haven, 1955, pp. Zi6-2I8. 6The Collected Works of Ambrose Bierce, hereafter cited as CW (New York and Washington, 1909-12), XII, 3 I6. 7"Bits of Autobiography" CW, I, 388-393. 8The unpublished letters from Hotten to Bierce are all from Miscellaneous Manu- scripts, the Carl H.

The jump was not a blind one: the San Francisco News Letter, under Bierce's editorship, had been citing such London periodicals as Figaro, Fun, and the Echo, and in turn had been noticed favorably in London magazines.9 Al- most immediately Bierce began writing for Fun, a humorous weekly edited by Tom Hood the younger; Figaro, edited by James Morti- mer; and the Alta California, published in San Francisco, to which he sent letters reporting on current events in England and the tourist sights he visited. These were printed in both the daily and the week- ly issues of the paper.10 He used the pen name "Dod Grile" in Lon- don, and a letter Tom Hood wrote him addressed to "Dear God Rile (which of course is an anagram)"'1 confirms Paul Fatout's surmise as to the source of the pseudonym. Fatout, writing at the suggestion of Emerson G. Sutcliffe, had conjectured that it was an anagram for Douglas Jerrold (i.e., "Dg Ierold"). Jerrold (i 803-1857), an English playwright, had written a melodrama, Ambrose Gwinett; or, A Sea- side Story, which played in various American cities for almost forty years after its opening at the Royal Coburg Theatre on Waterloo Road in October 1 828.12 On July 4, I872, Bierce called on John Camden Hotten, who was not in at the time; but the two men met shortly thereafter and began planning a book. Hotten, a notorious pirate who had lived in the United States as a youth and young man, had published, after his return to England, such American writers as Edgar Allan Poe, Oliver Wendell Holmes, James Russell Lowell, Artemus Ward, Bret Harte, and Joaquin Miller. And he was handling the works of Mark Twain in such a way as to cause a public protest from Clemens.13 Moreover, he had an unsavory reputation on Fleet Street.

[over Ward's death] is certainly unique. I refer to a certain publisher, who has "done more for American humor"' etc., etc. In the course of an amusing quarrel, the other day, between this publisher and a well-known author... the publisher severely taxed his antagonist as being the prime actor in poor Ward's undoing; in other words the author was one of those who led him into the fatal temptation which was too strong for him. I was in- expressibly touched at this exhibition of heart in a publisher ... but upon learning that he had made a good profit by pirating "poor Ward's" books, and had never given the latter a penny, I partially dried my "tear of sen- sibility." It is only just to say that the publisher in question denies the soft impeachment. The absence of an international copyright, of course, made it an easy matter for English publishers to pirate American authors,'5 and Bierce, himself a sharp businessman, later wrote that, under the cir- cumstances, Hotten had both a legal and a moral right to fly the Jolly Roger.16 But it is not inconceivable that, urged on by his Fleet Street friends, he may have approached Hotten in order to forestall a raid on his own work. Nevertheless, arrangements between author and publisher began amicably enough. Hotten purchased, for ?75, the "MS. &amp; print" of Bierce's "short stories, paragraphs, Grizzly papers, axioms, &amp;c" This collection was compiled from clippings of Bierce's work for California periodicals, including the five Grizzly Papers (by "Ursus") which had appeared in the Overland Monthly from January to June, I87I, and the Town Crier material from the San Francisco Nerws Letter. The manuscript, which came to about seventy folio pages, seems to have been brought to England by Bierce after it had been rejected by a New York publisher. Hotten intended to put this compilation out under the title The Fiend's De- light. Since it was not the basis for the book which eventually ap- peared under that name, I shall call it the Ur-Fiend's Delight.

When he came here certain of those gentlemen fastened-I may say batten'd-upon him, and his executors subsequently gave me to understand that some of them had endeavoured to make un- pleasantness betwixt him and myself. Indeed, I remember very well his writing to me in a genial sort of way asking some questions, and I have nothing in my literary portfolio that I value more than his cordial, honest reply to my explanation. I subsequently purchased his English copy- rights, and unpublished MSS. from the Executors.'7 A month later, having proceeded with the printing of the Ur- Fiend's Delight, Hotten announced that proofs would shortly be sent. Moreover, he and his wife genuinely tried to make the young American couple, who were living near Tottenham Court Road, feel at home in London, inviting them to tea on Sunday, September i, at their home in Hampstead. "You will like the air in this neighbour- hood' he wrote, "and I think Madame might be amused at seeing a Pirate's home, with Mrs. Pirate and the young ones. The cave is situated at 4 Maitland Park Villas, Haverstock Hill, N.W" (1505). The Bierces, however, who were planning a trip to Stratford, were unable to accept the invitation. On September 2, Hotten wrote: "Of course, we shall be glad to see you when you return, but my little wife is such a domesticated, motherly soul that I thought a few hours companionship would be agreeable to Mrs. Bierce" (I5o6). Furthermore, Bierce, who had apparently brought with him a tea chest full of clippings of his work and stored it in Bernard Street, London, seems to have had thoughts of compiling a second book, and asked Hotten to hold up the Ur-Fiend's Delight. Hotten ac- quiesced, promising that, unless the proofs reached Bierce immedi- ately, nothing would be done until his return. As a consequence of these arrangements, in the autumn of i872 Hotten purchased, for another ?75, a second book-length manu- '7Pforzheimer Misc.

Apparently no money had yet been paid over for either book. The second com- pilation was referred to as Nuggets and Dust (i.e., an Ur-Nuggets and Dust; the announcement that Blanck refers to in his Bibliography on page 2 18 is to this Ur-Nuggets and Dust, and not, as he assumes, to the book which finally was published under that title by Chatto and Windus). Work stopped on the Ur-Fiend's Delight, and both author and publisher concentrated their attention on the Ur-Nug- gets and Dust, Hotten inserting the following ad in the Spectator for October 12: NUGGETS AND DUST./Panned out by DOD GRILE. A new style of Humour and Satire. If Artemus Ward may be considered the Douglas Jerrold, and Mark Twain the Sydney Smith of America, Dod Grile will rank as their Dean Swift. There is a grimness and force in him which places his humour far above anything of the kind ever attempted. The New York Nation-a literary authority of marvellous ability-is struck with Dod Grile's wit and delightful badinage, every line in the most forcible English. The reference to the Nation, which appears on the surface to be a rash falsehood, calls for some explanation. That journal had, indeed, praised Bierce during his Town Crier days. Although somewhat shocked at his "Rabelaisian audacity' his impudence, and his irrever- ence, the editors explained these traits-which they did not unre- servedly admire-as the consequences of his being "a Californian social phenomenon" not quite comprehensible to the eastern mind. They cited as a good example of his humor, however, a passage from the Town Crier which appears in FD as "A Certain Popular Fallacy" (pp. 83-84); and went on to praise his "mental detachment" and "sense of fun" his presumptive "power of spiritual sympathy" allied with his undoubted "intellectual playfulness' his "strong sense, when he chooses to exercise it" and courage, and his "apparent capacity for despising some things more 'respectable' than really respected.""8 Bierce had returned the compliment in his Town Crier column, call- ing the Nation "conspicuously the most thoughtful and sensible journal published in the United States'."9 Its editors undoubtedly had 18The Nation, June 17, I869, pp. 473-474. 19News Letter, Jan. 27, I872, p. 9.</page><page sequence="7">AMBROSE BIERCE 359 at least a strong suspicion of "Dod Grile's" identity, but in their No- vember 2 1 issue, they took mock umbrage at Hotten: We learn, from an advertisement of his printed in the Spectator of Octo- ber I 2, that "the New York Nation is struck with Dod Grile's wit and delightful badinage, every line in the most forcible English"; as to which we would say that we have not been struck by Dod Grile; that his wit, and his delightful badinage, and his forcible English are all entirely un- known to us; that we never heard of him or them till we saw Mr. Hot- ten's advertisement, and that we should like to know why we are quoted as having been struck with the powers of Mr. Grile. Tom Hood, who took this disclaimer at its face value, wrote la- conically that "the Nation shews Hotten has been lying again as usual"20 But the article continued in a vein that left no doubt of the editors' opinion of Bierce: And finally, Mr. Hotten himself tells us that he has made a certain cove- nant and agreement with that serpent, that hardy blasphemer, that foe of all the gentler feelings adorning our nature, that prodigious and front- less contemner of virtue and morality, the San Francisco News Letter's "Town Crier" In consideration of a sum of money to him in hand paid, this enemy of man and worse enemy of woman has bound and obligated himself to gather together his compositions into a book-a sort of cynic's vade mecum, a Delectatio Demonorum and "Fiends' [sic] Delight:' which Mr. Hotten will publish. Should he do so, the reading public will see a specimen of "American humor" as unlike that of any of the other Amer- ican humorists as the play of young human merry-andrews is unlike that of a young and energetic demon whose horns are well-budded.21 Hotten wrote that the Nation had been having a "bit of fun" with him, and said he hoped Bierce would not thrash him for having de- vised the advertisement. The magazine, he went on, "has a delicious paragraph about you, ... praises you in a way to make all the other humourists of America hide their heads; in fact the Nation places the laurel upon your brows!" ( i 5o8). Toward the end of 1872 the touring Bierces settled temporarily in Bristol, where their first child, a son, Day, was born. Bierce, more- over, was not eager to return to the capital because of the unfor- 20Pforzheimer Misc.

Hot- ten seems to have been treating him equitably and (in comparison not only to the publishing standards of the time but to his treatment of Mark Twain during these months) generously. Nevertheless Bierce was not satisfied, and a rift grew between the two men. Lack- ing Bierce's side of the correspondence, one finds it impossible to say exactly what was making him disgruntled, but with Hotten in Lon- don and Bierce in Bristol, there seems to have been a breakdown of communication. It is difficult to reconstruct precisely what hap- pened, but the sequence of events seems to be approximately as fol- lows: By December, or possibly earlier, Bierce changed his mind yet again, this time about the forthcoming Ur-Nuggets and Dust, which, as has been noted, Hotten had already advertised. Bierce now de- cided that his first book should consist of stories only, and wrote Hotten to that effect. The date of this letter cannot be determined, because Hotten did not receive it immediately, having taken a trip to Manchester some time in the autumn or early winter. On his re- turn, however, he wrote Bierce on December I 8, falling in with the revised plan, asking that stories for the new volume be gathered, and suggesting the inclusion of material from the Overland Monthly. "I dare say we shall agree as to terms"' he added. "I am not rich, but I am not mean' He also complimented Bierce on his "How I Came to Like Dogs' published in Tom Hood's Comic Annual for 1873.22 Although this tale may have been the one originally purchased for the Ur-Nuggets and Dust, there is no dog story in the final version of either FD or ND. The letter is a friendly one; Hotten suggests various books he would like to send the new baby for Christmas- Mother Hubbard, The Three Bears, or "a sweet thing called 'The Cats Tea Party'-adorned with gamboge and crimson pictures, near- ly life size, that greatly delights the infant mind" Then he adds that perhaps a Bancroft history or Webster's unabridged dictionary would be a sounder "first course for the young &amp; free American' and 22London, [1872], pp. 21-23. "How I Came to Like Dogs" is a typical American tall tale, with an added touch of Biercean gruesomeness. It is narrated by the'second officer of the Mudturtle, a ship with a cargo of 63 million dogs, and is the only example of Bierce's writing in the book. Other contributors were Hood himself, Prentice Mulford, Henry J. M. Sampson, Crawford Wilson, E. G. Dalziel, William Sawyer, Mark Twain, J. F. Sullivan, and W S. Gilbert.</page><page sequence="9">AMBROSE BIERCE 36I twits Bierce with spawning little Englishmen: "By the way I've been thinking over this question of nationality. Is it right, is it proper, is it patriotic for you to be going round in this way getting young Britishers? " ( I 50o8) . Bierce definitely received this missive, since it was found among his papers. But possibly it was delayed in transit, for he sent Hotten an ill-tempered letter requesting the return of his MS, and on Decem- ber 29, I872, he wrote to Charles Warren Stoddard: "He bought one very bad thing of mine, which I compiled at his request from old newspaper paragraphs, but he shows no disposition to do anything more than advertise it at present-which suits me. He is not a nice publisher to deal with, and I shall probably give him nothing else!'23 In the meantime, he seems to have received Hotten's December I8 letter, and wrote to apologize for his "rough remarks:' Hotten claimed never to have received them, and mentioned that his own letter of December I8 had not been answered. He then added: "I reopen this note to say that from one or two remarks dropped by you since Bristol has been your 'dwelling place' I do not seem to have recd all your letters" ( I 5og). Bierce had been planning to visit London soon anyhow. It seems likely that, on receipt of this information, he proceeded post-haste to the capital. I suggest January 5 or 6 as a likely date for his arrival, since he spent a fortnight there, and had left, ill and anxious to return to his family, by January i8. During this period, Hotten returned the copy for the Ur-Nuggets and Dust on which Bierce had decided to postpone work, and on January 9 cited their "new understand- ing": Bierce was to select "the best:' or what he conceived to be "the most telling to English readers:' of the shorter stories and para- graphs from both the Ur-Fiend's Delight and the Ur-Nuggets and Dust. This new selection, to be called The Fiend's Delight, would then constitute his first book to be published in England-or, indeed, anywhere else. At this stage, the project to make FD a book of stories only had been dropped. Matter left over from the Ur-Fiend's Delight was to be put in ND. Hotten, however, in outlining the new agree- ment, included a sentence which angered Bierce: "Should there be 23Unpublished letter, Huntington Library HM IOI02. This and HM 10103, quoted below, are owned by, and quoted with the pernission of, the Huntington Library, San Marino, California.</page><page sequence="10">362 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY any of your writings in my own fathering of American facetiae, or among your own unsorted writings, wch would benefit this first book the same is to be included in it" ( I 5 IO). VWhen Bierce objected to this condition, Hotten wrote: "I do NOT mean to lay claim to all your unsorted things, NOR did I dream of including any other man's things in your book" (I5 I i). The new FD was to be paid for as soon as Hotten received final arrangement of copy for the press, and the book was to be printed six weeks later. After FD was published, pay- ment would be made for ND. During the fortnight he spent in the capital, Bierce apparently turned over the copy for the new FD, which consisted of the seven- ty folio pages of the Ur-Fiend's Delight plus thirty-three additional folio pages. He and Hotten went over this material, both men think- ing it sufficient for the size of book they intended bringing out, and Hotten gave Bierce a check-probably for ?5o, an amount which Bierce later complained about. After Bierce's return to Bristol Hot- ten found, on consultation with his printer, that the revised copy was sufficient for only about 120 pages-fewer than had been agreed upon. He thereupon wrote for more copy, saying that if Bierce would only send for his tea chest and ransack it for clippings, he (Hotten) would be glad to assist in the selection. Furthermore, after studying the copy carefully, he felt there were too many atroc- ities piled one on top of the other, and that the interpolation of lighter material on the order of "'Love's Labour Lost"' (see FD, pp. 17-I9) -"a little laughter between the knife business &amp; the mur- ders"-would render the atrocities more vivid (S 1I3). Bierce then suggested headings for FD, which Hotten accepted; but he con- tinued to plead for some "delightful conceits not entirely of a gory character" as "a relief to savage chuckles" A good deal of acrimoni- ous debate ensued, not only about the amount of copy, but about the price paid for it. Hotten felt that Bierce had accused him of being a Shylock, whereas, he asseverated, "what I have paid you is the high- est I have ever known to have been paid, under the circumstances, in this country. It may seem small to you, but I am sure your Fleet st. friends will tell you that it is a good price for that particular com- modity in the particular market' He promised proof of the first six- teen pages of FD on February 8, but asserted he was still short of cOpy ( 514, 1515). By February i i Bierce, who had been ill again,</page><page sequence="11">AMBROSE BIERCE 363 had corrected these proofs and had sent some additional "pleasan- tries"' Hotten found this extra copy satisfactory, saying he would either return it with the corrected proofs for proper arrangement or, if Bierce would tell him where it went, insert it in its appropriate position himself. By February I8 Bierce had sent in enough extra copy to make FD the agreed-upon length. The additions-which appear as "Tall Talk"-follow directly after "Some Fiction" in the final published version. Although at this time Hotten began requesting more copy for ND, he was now satisfied with what had been sent him for FD, and by March 4 was sending proofs of the entire book to Bierce. Further negotiations on it concerned only such matters as the quality and arrangement of certain parts. In some cases Bierce followed Hotten's suggestions; in others he did not. For example, Hotten regarded "Angels and Angles" "The Internationale' and "Additional Talk -Done in the Country" as of lower caliber than the rest of the book and asked that these be replaced with selections from the Grizzly Papers in the Overland Monthly, a file of which he possessed. When the book was printed, "The Internationale" was omitted, but "Angels and Angles" (FD, pp. 76-77, a rather witless essay, the gist of which is that women should have no angles in their clothes) was retained, as was "Additional Talk" (FD, pp. 95-97), which Bierce defended by saying Bret Harte had once praised it. On his own initiative, he took out a tale called "Nocturnal Calf" and replaced it with one called "The Baffled Asian" (FD, pp. 59-60). By the middle of March arrangements were substantially com- plete for the publication of FD, and on March I 6 Bierce wrote Stod- dard, who had been trying to find an English publisher for South- Sea Idyls, "I have some things a-publishing there [in London], but my atrocities afford no criterion as to the sale of your better wares. I should have burnt all mine if I could have afforded that luxury" (HM 10103). Hotten planned to bring out FD about April i, but shortly a new difficulty arose, this time over the fact that Bierce had been sending in uncorrected copy, then making his corrections on the proofs. Hotten stood this without complaint until, on the very eve of publication, Bierce asked that all the revises24 be sent him at 24A "revise' in printer's parlance, is a second or any subsequent proof.</page><page sequence="12">364 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY once. Hotten could not comply with this request, since the revises, on their return, had been worked off and the type distributed, the whole book never having been set up at any one time. He took this occasion to upbraid Bierce for sending in uncorrected copy, especial- ly when, being mainly printed material, it would have been easy enough to edit. The bill for alterations and corrections, he said, would come to about ?io. Sending revises, too, was delaying com- pletion of the book, which he was anxious to get out. Bierce responded to these charges by requesting more money, which Hotten was unable to send immediately, since he was bring- ing FD out in a more expensive edition than he had intended. It is, as a matter of fact, one of the handsomest books Bierce was ever to see his own work appear in. Hotten said, however, that as soon as FD appeared he would send the money. (It will be remembered that, although Bierce still had ?25 owing him for FD, payment on ND was not due until the first book had been published.) On April 7 Hotten sent Bierce the revises of almost the last sheets of FD. At this time, also, plans for the format of the book were made. On the title page is a drawing (reproduced in Blanck, p. [217]) of a be- spectacled Pickwickian gentleman of benign aspect contemplative- ly holding a baby over an open fire on a toasting fork. Hotten wrote Bierce asking for "a few telling lines" to put beneath this picture. The lines as printed were "'Count that day lost whose low descending sun / Views from thy hand no worthy action done"'2' A donkey's picture with a quotation from Swift comes at the end of the book: "For my own part, I must confess to bear a very singular respect to this animal, by whom I take human nature to be most admirably held forth in all its qualities as well as operations [: ] and, therefore, what- ever in my small reading occurs concerning this, our fellow creature, I do never fail to set it down by way of commonplace; and when I have occasion to write upon human reason, politics, eloquence or knowledge, I lay my memorandums before me, and insert them with a wonderful facility of application.-Swift'26 By the end of April or early in May, I873, FD was ready for the 25An early version of this (I697) was written by Jacob Bobart in David Krieg's autograph album, now in the British Museum (Sloane MSS, 236o). 26"A Discourse Concerning the Mechanical Operation of the Spirit:' Sec.

Yet whatever financial arrangements had been made were un- satisfactory to Bierce. He evidently complained to his friend and fellow-contributor to Fun, Henry Sampson, for on April 28 Samp- son wrote him: If you will take the tip of a man who ... know[s] ... London, and far deeper people in it than Mr. Hotten, you will I fancy succeed in flooring that watery-eyed imitation of a shrewd ... man. The people with whom he does business are as a rule the greatest duffers from a worldly point of view that the Almighty ever allowed to live-they let him do as he likes, and then he thinks he is clever. Bah! You have (unless you have com- promised yourself in any way) the whip hand of him. You have had money[;] you are not insanely anxious for publication. Then let him slide. It matters more to him than it does to you.27 Some time in May the Bierces, who had spent the spring in Bath, returned to London, settling in Hampstead. But early that month Hotten had come down with a fatal illness. On May 3o he sent Bierce a last letter written on his deathbed, a pencil scrawl in a pathetically uncharacteristic hand. He said that his clerks had secured the Bierces' address from Joaquin Miller, who had called at the office on May 29 on his way to visit them, and that he was forwarding a copy of FD. At this time, according to Bierce, Hotten still owed him ?ioo, but on June I 2 dispatched his manager, Andrew Chatto, with a check for the full amount. After a two-hour argument, Chatto finally pro- duced the check, signed by Hotten but postdated to June I4, and asked Bierce to call on the ailing publisher. Bierce accordingly went to Hotten's house on the morning of Saturday, June 14, I873. But Hotten, who had spoken confidently of his recovery in his May 30 letter, had died only a few hours earlier. Bierce still had hopes of racing to the bank with his check before Hotten's account was closed. On the way, however, he stopped off at a taproom fre- quented by his fellow-journalists, and whiled away several hours with them drinking and composing facetious epitaphs on the late publisher. By the time he reached the bank, it was too late: the news of Hotten's death had preceded him. It was, said Bierce, "the old, old story of the hare and the tortoise."28 27Pforzheimer Misc. MSS, 1541.

But "Tall Talk" the section which was added fairly late in planning the book, is a group of quite creditable essays, followed by some aphorisms and epigrams. The subjects range from Johnsonian fleers at the bucolic life to a satire on the use of batteries of artillery in orchestras. The latter, "Music-Muscular and Mechanical" (pp. 66- 67), was perhaps occasioned by the Grand Music Festival held in the Mechanics' Pavilion of San Francisco on February 22-24, I870, at which electrically fired cannon, city fire bells, and fifty anvils struck by a hundred firemen were added to corps of drummers from the city militia, a chorus of 1,200, an orchestra of I5o, and a band of 350. In the din created by this weird panoply Verdi's Anvil Chorus from I1 Trovatore and "The Star-Spangled Banner" were supposed to be audible.29 "Current Journalings" which comes next, consists of disconnected little paragraphs on a variety of topics, somewhat like the New Yorker's Talk of the Town. Deriving from the Town Crier column, they are among the best parts of the book. And there is one amusing- ly wrong-headed piece of self-analysis: "We are tolerably phleg- matic and notoriously hard to provoke .... Slow to anger, quick to forgive, charitable in judgment and to mercy prone; with un- bounded faith in the entire goodness of man and the complete holi- ness of woman; seeking ever for palliating circumstances in the con- duct of the blackest criminal-we are at once a model of moderation and a pattern of forbearance" (pp. II 5-I I 6). The fourth section is made up of a few satirical "Obituary Notices" on "Christians" and "Pagans:' the latter group constituting a savage attack on the mistreatment of Orientals by American westerners. "Musings, Philosophical and Theological:' are exemplified by No. xIi (p. 159): "Everybody professes to know that it would be diffi- cult to find a needle in a haystack, but very few reflect that this is 29See also News Letter, Feb. I9, I870, p. 7.</page><page sequence="15">AMBROSE BIERCE 367 because haystacks seldom contain needles" On the whole, they are pluralistic and relativistic in outlook; sometimes two or three in a row will present conflicting opinions, and many of the statements satirize man's uncompromising anthropomorphism."0 The "Laughorisms"'3 the next section, show Bierce at his epigram- matic best: Those who are horrified at Mr. Darwin's theory, may comfort them- selves with the assurance that, if we are descended from the ape, we have not descended so far as to preclude all hope of return. Every man is at heart a brute, and the greatest injury you can put upon any one is to provoke him into displaying his nature. No gentle- man ever forgives the man who makes him let out his beast. Truth is more deceptive than falsehood, because it is commonly em- ployed by those from whom we do not expect it, and so passes for what it is not. In the infancy of our language to be "foolish" signified to be affec- tionate; to be "fond" was to be silly. We have altered that now: to be "foolish" is to be silly, to be "fond" is to be affectionate. But that the change could ever have been made is significant. The noblest pursuit of Man is the pursuit of Woman. The "'Items' from the Press of Interior California" last of the prose sections, are little paragraphs, satirizing the freewheeling journalism of western frontier towns, which had apparently appeared in the San Francisco News Letter as early as August I868. I have not had ac- cess to a file of the News Letter for that period, but see Fatout, p. 79. In CW (XII, 3I6) Bierce noted that they had appeared in the News Letter "two or three years before" their publication in FD. The final section, "Poesy" is devoted to a strange assortment of verses, on the whole rather high in quality. "Ye Idyll of Ye Hippopo- potamus" is a kind of surrealist nonsense poem, in a variety of meters and rimes: Down sank the Sun with a kick and a plunge, Up from the wave rose the head of a Sponge; Ropes in his ringlets, eggs in his eyes, Tip-tilted nose in a way to surprise. 30Some of these Musings appeared originally in the Town Crier, Dec. i6, I871. 31These appeared originally in the Grizzly Papers; see especially Overland Monthly for March and June I871, pp. 282, 567-568.</page><page sequence="16">368 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY The "Epitaph on George Francis Train" is more conventional: The sexton tolls his solemn bell For scoundrel dead and gone to-well, It matters not, it can't recall This convict from his final cell. "Communing with Nature" is an attack on unrealistic sentimental- ism about the delights of the rural life;32 its protagonist, sitting on a hill above San Francisco, gets caught in the rain: "As the boots I had on were uncommonly thin/My fancy leaked out as the water leaked in"' "Resurgam" a witty poem on the Resurrection day, is revised from the Grizzly Papers, where it occurs without a title, signed "Ursus"33 Hotten's widow had sold his business to Chatto and Windus, who subsequently brought out ND. This seems not to have posed the problems between author and publisher that FD had: for one thing, it was probably substantially ready for the press at the time of Hot- ten's death; and for another, Bierce's dealings with Andrew Chatto were always much smoother than those with Hotten. The second book, like its predecessor, began with a group of stories, "Crazy Tales" This section was followed by "Notes Written with Invisible Ink by a Phantom American' "The Model Philosopher" "Editorial Fine Frenzies" "Sacred Themes" and "The Model Reporter" The last section is not, as Gaer indicates, a part of "Sacred Themes"; the two are independent. The "Crazy Tales" with which ND begins are very short-some contain only a paragraph or two-and fall into the general categories of comic (e.g., "Hanner's Wit" from the Town Crier for December I6, I87I); ludicrously horrible (e.g., "A Mournful Property"- which is inadvertently omitted in Gaer's listing of the "Crazy Tales" -and "A Delicate Hint") ;34 and satiric. The only completely suc- cessful story in this group is "Maternal Precaution" a very brief "fable" on the order of the "Fantastic Fables" of Volume VI in CW Two stories in this group are of considerable interest, however, 32See also the Grizzly Papers, in Overland Monthly, June I871, p. 563. 33Grizzly Papers, Overland Monthly, Feb. 1871, p. i85; FD, pp. I96-i97. 34These appeared originally in the Town Crier; see the News Letter for Sept. 2 and i6, 1871.</page><page sequence="17">AMBROSE BIERCE 369 as an indication of Bierce's groping toward the kind of masterpieces he was later to create: "D.T." and "A Working Girl's Story"' The first of these, after a mildly facetious beginning, develops a tone of real terror, which is spoiled by an abrupt intrusion of the comic. From this awkward genesis, Bierce later was to develop a form peculiarly his own, the tale of ironic terror.35 "A Working Girl's Story" begins on a note of genuine pathos; again, however, its tone is spoiled by misplaced comedy at the very end. The next section of ND includes some of Bierce's most successful work in these two volumes-"Notes Written with Invisible Ink by a Phantom American' appreciative little essays on aspects of England that had appealed to him.36 These essays, which lack the tone of savage denunciation permeating much of Bierce's California writing, have added psychological interest as indicating an alternative direc- tion for Bierce's mental development, had he settled permanently in an environment more congenial to him than the gilded corruption of late nineteenth-century America. "The Model Philosopher" signed "Ursus" and adapted from the Grizzly Papers, reveals Bierce's reading in philosophy (the tracks of Plato can be clearly discerned, most notably in the little essay-pp. 67-68-which treats suicide as a Platonic myth). This section is a series of quasi-philosophic reflections on such topics as the relativism of both physical perception and intellectual comprehension and the relation between Nature and Art (a problem that continued to haunt Bierce as he developed his own aesthetic theory). "Editorial Fine Frenzies" are on a more topical level. "The Beast without a Name" (an attack on abortionists) was taken from the Town Crier for February I 8, I 87 I . "Perseverance" (on the method of suicide), "Ad Stultos" (on hypocrisy), "February Twenty- Second' and "A Small Mistake" on mankind's increasing tendency 35See my "Bierce's Turn of the Screw: Tales of Ironical Terror:' Western Hwmani- ties Review,XI ( 957), 257-264. 36"St. Paul's" and "The Size of London" appeared originally in DAC, Oct.

Again, these are developed, at least in part, from the Town Crier column (e.g., March ri and September 9, 1871)". The Model Reporter" the last section, is a series of random observations which seem to have been taken almost entirely from the Town Crier.38 A comparison of both FD and ND with the journalistic sources from which they were taken shows that Bierce was not merely copy- ing old material. Revision of some sort nearly always occurs, and occasionally the adaptation is extensive. I have dealt with these early London books in some detail because they are almost unobtainable today; they were rarities in Bierce's own time. Little attention has been paid them because even when they appeared he professed con- tempt for them, and he continued to do so throughout his life, dis- suading publishers from reissuing them and diverting attention to what he felt was his better work. The basis for his continuing aver- sion probably lies in their occasional lapses from style and even grammar, and it is true that FD and ND lack the clarity and pre- cision of his prose at its limpid best. Yet they are not so bad as all that. A few items from both books have intrinsic merit; several more are of real importance to anyone who is interested in tracing Bierce's artistic development. Gladstone, twenty years after their original appearance, started a Bierce boom in London by his praise of FD, and Bierce finally included parts of them, with revisions, in his CW Since he called FD a "foolish book" (CW, XII, 3 I 6) at the very time he was plundering it, it is instruc- tive to note how much of these first two books he himself actually regarded as worthy of preservation. Three of the "Tall Talk" essays were revised to reappear as "Tangential Views" in Volume IX of the CW: "A Call to Dinner" (FD, pp. 6I-64) became "The Religion of the Table" (CW, IX, 76-78); "Did We Eat One Another?" and "Thanksgiving Day" were reprinted under those titles (FD, pp. 37News Letter for Jan. 2, I872; July 15, Feb. 25, and July 15, I871. 38News Letter for Dec. 4 and i8 of I869; Feb. 5 and 26, Mar. i9, Apr. i6, May 2I, June 4 and i8, Dec. 17 of I870; Feb. ii, Mar. i8, Apr.

"'Items' from the Press of Interior California" were revised and most of them were reprinted as "Mortality in the Foot-Hills' CW, XII, 3I6-325. "Musings, Philosophical and Theological' and "Laughorisms" from FD were combined with the "Model Philoso- pher" from ND and revised to form, with some additions, the "Epi- grams" of CW, VIII, 343-381. The subsequent history of Bierce's relations with publishers is appalling in its record of waste, mismanagement, and lack of under- standing; but during one period, at least, he had an able and sym- pathetic publisher whose role in giving his career a push has been obscured by lack of knowledge. Whatever Hotten's faults or his record for piracy of other American authors, his treatment of "Dod Grile" stands forth as a model of competence and forbearance in comparison with the tragic mishandling of much of Bierce's later work.</page></plain_text>
