BURTON University of Chicago The previous articles of this series have dealt with the usage of Greek writers from Homer down to, and along certain lines a hundred years beyond, the close of the New Testament period, with the usage of the corresponding Hebrew words, and with Jewish-Greek usage of the pre-Christian and early Christian period. Before taking up the New Testament writers themselves, it is desirable to consider briefly certain non-Christian religious writers who though of somewhat uncertain date reflect usages which may be antecedent to, or contemporary with, the New Testament. A. THE USAGE OF THE MAGICAL TEXTS In the magical texts, which have been brought to light by the researches of Parthey, Wesseley, Kenyon, and others and made the subject of study by Dieterich, Reitzenstein, Cumont, and others, the word zrve^ja is of frequent occurrence, sometimes with #,Vvx in parallelism or a&amp;p? in antithesis. Probably none of the literature is itself pre-Christian in its present form, and much of it belongs to the third and fourth centuries A.D.,' but the pos- sibility that it reflects a usage coming from as early a period as the New Testament writers requires that it be taken into account. HIIveIa is still used in the sense of air. The god is spoken of as 6 Kevc rvevlyanL. More frequently, however, it is applied to I See Parthey, in Abh. d. Akad. d. Wiss. (Berlin, 1865), p. 3I7; Wesseley, in Denk. d. Akad. d. Wiss. (Vienna, I888), Abt.

So sometimes in connection with the use in the sense of air, or with both uses in reference to the god in close connection.' In particular irve'a is used of the paredros or guardian-spirit by whom the soul of the initiate is cared for.2 But irvei9a is also applied to the soul of the initiate.3 It is noticeable here that rvevia alone is used as a simple anthropological term, denoting one of the two elements of man, along with a&amp;~jia; but a&amp;dpov irveva as applied to the soul when separated from the body, and to the irdpe8pos by whom it is borne into the air. To the former also even the term Oe6s is applied. The human irve a is, sometimes at least, thought of as coming from God, and as that by the impartation of which life is created or of which the soul is composed; but, more fre- quently, perhaps, it is identified with the #vxi?. It is instructive to find in these writings the two already familiar phrases 7rveVea Ge6ov and irv*~/a &amp;ywv. The former, occurring in Menander in the fourth century B.c., in the Axiochus, the LXX, and Philo, and in the magical papyri, has in all cases the same fundamental meaning, "divine Spirit." In the Greek writers it is the power that controls the actions of men or the source of mentality in men: in the Jewish writers, the source of inspiration or of moral uplift; in the magical texts, the source of religious ecstasy or transformation. IIYvea t iyov, first attested by the LXX, occurs also in other Jewish writings, including the New Testament, and in the magical papyri. Its presence in these two apparently unre- lated groups may conceivably be due to an oriental idea and phraseology (of which even the "Holy Spirit" of Hebrew scripture may be an early expression) by which the two literatures have been independently affected. In view, however, of the absence of definite testimony to the existence of such an oriental idea and of the syncretistic character of the religions which gave rise to the magical papyri, it is perhaps quite as probable that the latter 1 Cf. passage quoted by Kenyon, Papyri in the British Museum, I, 114; Wesseley, op. cit., p. 54, I, 1029, in Reitzenstein, HM-R, p. 137; Parthey, I, i, 312; Wesseley, I, 146, I, 243, in Reitzenstein, HM-R, p. 137. s Parthey, I, 177, I, 96. 3 Reitzenstein, HM-R, p. 136.</page><page sequence="3">SPIRIT, SOUL, AND FLESH 565 derived the term from Jewish or Christian writings. There seems at least little reason to deny that Judaism and Christianity may have influenced the contemporary religions as well as have been influenced by them. The chief value, accordingly, of the evidence of the papyri is in showing the wide currency of the word irvvei)a, and especially of the phrases irvevia Oelov and rveivA &amp;yov, rather than in throwing any considerable light upon the origin of New Testament usage. 'vx' continues in use and with substantially unchanged meaning, although Irve^pa has become individualized and its practical equivalent. Of any antithesis between the two terms there is but slight evidence. The adjectives UvxcKbs and rvevpLarTKbs each occur once. Reitzenstein maintains that, in the religious and magical writers of this period, the man who had received the divine rveiva was thought of as lrvPevuarLKS; he who had not received it was still only IvX'6bs (op. cit., pp. 42 ff.). This is at least so far true as that the divine being or influence by which man is transformed in nature, reborn, is constantly called irvwia, very rarely, it would seem, bvXih, and the man who is by the divine irveLca reborn is never as such designated V#vx', but, in the post- mortem state at least, 7rvevcua ('ptmov). 2l&amp;p?, so far as appears, took on in the magical texts no meanings different from those found in the other Greek writings of the period. B. THE HERMETIC LITERATURE The so-called Hermetic writings have been known to Christian writers for many centuries. The early church Fathers (Justin Martyr, Tertullian, Clement of Alexandria) quote them in defense of Christianity. Stobaeus collected fragments of them. The Hu- manists knew and valued them. They were studied in the six- teenth and seventeenth centuries, and in modern times have again been diligently examined by many scholars. Parthey has published the text of the Corpus Hermeticum in full and Reitzenstein in part, and G. R. S. Mead has issued a translation of the whole body of extant literature, with extended prolegomena, commentary, etc.' I Parthey, Hermetis Trismegisti Poemander, Berlin, 1854; Reitzenstein, Poe- mandres, Leipzig, 1904; G. R. S. Mead, Thrice-Greatest Hermes, London and Benares, xgo6.</page><page sequence="4">566 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY There is a wide difference of opinion as to the date at which this literature was produced. Mead believes that some of the extant portions of it are at least as early as the earliest Christian writings, while von Christ assigns them to the third Christian century, and thinks that they show the influence of neo-Platonism. To affirm that they influenced New Testament usage would be hazardous, but they perhaps throw some light on the direction in which thought was moving in New Testament times. In this literature the common division of man into soul and body is retained from the long familiar usage (Corpus Hermeticum 1:30; 2:9; 8:I; 9:2; II:IO). In io:io, it takes the form, mind and body. But the favorite conception is of man as consisting of five elements, arranged in the order of their dignity as follows: voVS, X&amp;YoS, I, vxl, r1 'veiLa, oiia, mind, reason, soul, spirit, body (C.H. 1o:13). Mind is that which is most akin to God, for God is mind (C.H. 5:11), or the cause of mind (C.H. 2:14). TIvx is that which has life. From the all-Soul there spring souls of creeping things, and these in ascending scale become by transmigration souls of fishes, land animals, birds, and men, while human souls may eventually become bal/oves or vo8s. . vX' in man has substantially the same meaning which it bears throughout Greek literature. It is the seat of intellectual and especially of moral life (C.H. io:8, I9); an eternal intellectual essence (Stob. Phys. 41 :6); incorporeal (ibid., 41: 2, 5); pre-existent and immortal (C.H. 8:i; 10:7, 15; Stob. Phys. 41:5). The 7rp6eua is distinct from the Cvx'i and inferior to it, its gar- ment, an intermediate thing between soul and body, yet also incorporeal (C.H. 2:8; io:13, 16, I7). Elsewhere it is represented as having intellectual qualities (Stob. Phys. 41:6). It is also spoken of as possessing generative power (C.H. 9:9). It is apparently conceived of as a rarefied substance. In the series of envelopes it is that which lies between body and soul, preventing their contact and the body's consequent destruction (C.H. io: x7). As distinguished from h/vx' it is perhaps thought of as the seat of life, while the latter is the seat of mentality and morality, never apparently occurring in the sense of life.</page><page sequence="5">SPIRIT, SOUL, AND FLESH 567 This literature is permeated with the Platonic idea of the inferiority of the body to the soul and with the notion that the body is a burden on the soul, yet it is not wholly consistent in its representation. Matter is eternal, yet also has been born, i.e., has been given form; unborn matter was alop4qa (C.H. I2:8; Stob. Phys. I1:2). Body, as in the Stoics (cf. American Journal of Theology, October, I914, P. 584), is used in a double sense: (a) that which has extension (C.H. 2: i); and (b) the material portion of man (Stob. Phys. 35:9; 9:2; C.H. 8:3). The passions of the body befoul the soul, which in infancy is not fully detached from the cosmic soul, and so is a thing of beauty and purity (C.H. 1o:15). The vice of the soul is ignorance; and ignorance is induced by the body (C.H. io:8). Its highest good, which is to be achieved by the life of piety, is on being released from the earthly body to become mind (vo0s), which takes to itself a fiery body. According to one passage the fate of the impious soul is its being turned back toward creeping things (C.H. io:8); according to another, which distinctly repudiates this view, it is to be re-embodied in a human body and to be scourged with its sins, the punishment being in- flicted by the mind, which has become a demon (C.H. 10: 19-21). But, on the other hand, the natural bodily impulses are not as such condemned, the begetting of children in particular being pronounced a pious act, while to die without children is an impiety punished after death by incarnation in a sexless body (C.H. 2:I7). It appears, then, that despite the occasional pessimistic asser- tions that good unmixed with evil is impossible here below (C.H. 6:3), and that the hardest thing of all is that we need evil things and cannot live without them (C.H. 6: 6), the real doctrine of this literature is not that the body by virtue of its quality as matter pollutes the soul, but that the body is a hindrance, its passions things to be overcome by piety, itself defined as knowing God and doing men no harm (C.H. 10:19). On the other hand, bodilessne'ss, or rather the possession of a fiery body, is an element of the highest blessedness along with knowledge of God and active benevolence and beneficence.</page><page sequence="6">568 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY 2&amp;pt is of very infrequent occurrence. When used it signifies either the muscular portion of the body (C.H. 6:6) or the body itself (ibid., 3:3, 4). C. NEW TESTAMENT USAGE In considering the usage of the New Testament writers, it will be expedient in the interest of brevity to present first an exhibit of New Testament usage in general, and then in a discussion of the usage of the several writers and groups of writers both to explain and justify the conclusions indicated in the general exhibit. i.

In 6 all the good that comes to man by nature is credited to the 4&amp;p?, the evil of it is its moral inadequacy; in 7 the right impulses are credited to the voDs or the o'w &amp;AvOpwcros, and the a&amp;p? becomes a force positively and aggressively evil. From this exhibit of New Testament usage in general we may pass to consider the usages of particular writers. PAULINE USAGE One of the marked peculiarities of the New Testament vocabu- lary which is especially characteristic of Paul is the frequency of the words 7rveV/a and o&amp;pi, especially the former. TvXF is indeed not infrequent, but while the others rise into a prominence which they have in no other literature that we have examined, 4?vxxi, which almost everywhere has been far more frequent than either of the other words, is now much less frequent than either. The apostle Paul's use of rvevya is plainly kindred with, and almost beyond doubt directly or indirectly influenced by, the Old Testament usage of .'11. If one turn to the Greek writers contemporary with Paul, he will find the meanings "wind" and "breath" most frequent, the meaning "spirit" rare, and the reli- gious sense of the term as referring to the Spirit of God or the spirit of man as the seat of religious life almost without example. Even in the Jewish-Greek writings other than the LXX, these latter meanings are relatively infrequent. In Paul, on the other hand,</page><page sequence="15">SPIRIT, SOUL, AND FLESH 577 7rvEuja never means "wind," the meaning "breath" occurs but once, and that in an epistle not quite certainly his, while its use in reference to the Spirit of God occurs on every page, and the instances in which it denotes the spirit of man are also quite frequent. Both these uses indeed are much more frequent in Paul than in any preceding literature, even the Old Testament, a fact which indicates that in the mind of Paul himself or in a circle of thought by which he was influenced something occurred to exalt the importance of the term in the senses referred to. If one seek for an author later than the Old Testament by whom Paul may have been influenced, there is none more probable than Philo Judaeus (see American Journal of Theology, July, 1916, pp. 404 ff.). But Paul's idea of spirit is by no means identical with Philo's, being simpler and more self-consistent, and more like that of the Old Testament. It may be doubted, therefore, whether Paul was very strongly influenced by Philo at this point. The occurrence of the phrase nrveDa &amp;ytov in the magical papyri, in such a way as to indicate that it is a familiar term in the vocabu- lary of those who wrote these documents, raises the question whether it is under the influence of this literature that Paul and the other New Testament writers employ this phrase and use nrv'da so frequently of the Spirit of God. It may be that further research will show this to have been the fact. But, as indicated above (p. 564), the existing evidence falls short of establishing more than the possibility of it, and it must for the present remain more probable that the development of which the Pauline writings give evidence has its chief basis in the Old Testament literature and its chief impulse in the Christian movement. Indeed, in view of the relative infrequency of the idea and the terms in contem- porary Jewish literature and their much greater prominence in Paul than in most other New Testament writers, with the exception of the Johannine literature, the most probable hypothesis seems to be that the apostle himself is largely responsible for the marked development in the usage of 2rveua with reference to the Spirit of God and the spirit of man as the seat of religious life. The secular Greek writers, it will be recalled, very rarely employ 1rvela of the human spirit, or soul, but almost uniformly .vX'i.</page><page sequence="16">578 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY Paul, on the other hand, like the LXX and the later Jewish-Greek writers, frequently uses 2rvega in this sense, and, like them, not infrequently with special reference to its religious capacities or experiences. The only respect in which he shows any definite development in the use of rve0p4a of the human spirit beyond the Jewish-Greek writers is in that he seems occasionally by a sort of blending of usages to employ it of the human spirit as permeated or dominated by the divine Spirit. In the consideration of the Pauline use of rvezeua to denote the Spirit of God, and the differentiation of Pauline from earlier usage, four facts are important to observe. First, the relation of the Spirit of God to God is analogous to that of the spirit of man to man (I Cor. 2:i I). In other words, whatever the origin of the phrase, it has become for Paul anthropomorphic, denoting an existence which has, in relation to God, powers or functions analogous to those of the human spirit in relation to man. In this statement of the apostle we seem to approach very closely to the identification of God and the Spirit of God. The Spirit is not here something which proceeds from God, but is the very center of the divine con- sciousness, and if we suppose that of the two elements of man there is in God none corresponding to the material body, the Spirit of God would seem to be God. Paul, to be sure, does not expressly say, as the Fourth Gospel does, that God is spirit, or that he has no body. To affirm, therefore, that he definitely identified God and the Spirit of God is doubtless in a measure to substitute infer- ence for evidence. Yet the passage is important as showing how near the apostle approached this affirmation. The second notable fact is that in Paul the Spirit as a transitive force is operative only in men, and in them as a force either pro- ducing extraordinary powers, such as prophecy, tongues, and the like (see especially I Cor., chap. 12), or regenerating moral character (see especially Gal. 5: 13-25). On the now familiar distinction between the charismatic expression of the Spirit and his ethical working, or on the apostle's toleration of the former idea and his exaltation of the latter, it is superfluous to dwell. In the third place, it is significant that from the point of view of religious experience Paul identifies the Spirit of God and the</page><page sequence="17">SPIRIT, SOUL, AND FLESH 579 heavenly Christ. Both are alike the indwelling cause in the soul of man of the present religious life and of the future resurrection and blessedness. There is but one experience and but one cause of it, which may be spoken of as the Spirit of God or as the Spirit of Christ or as Christ. This appears not only from such passages as Gal. 5: 6, i8, 25, compared with 2:20 and 5:6, reinforced as they are by many others, but most strikingly in Rom. 8:3-11, where the interchange of terms with reference to the same experience and without change of meaning is unmistakable, and in II Cor. 3: 17, where he seems directly to affirm that Christ is the Spirit.' Ade- quately to discuss the cause of tlhis duality of expression for a single idea would require more space than is here available. But it is evident that the two terminologies have a different historic origin. The Spirit-phraseology has its roots in those usages which we have been examining in previous articles. The Christ- terminology, itself, of course, derived from Jewish thought, as employed in the description of the Christian experience and expectation has its starting-point in Paul's own interpretation of his Damascus experience as a revelation of the Son of God in him. Unable to discard either phraseology for the other, he uses now one, now the other, now both together. In the fourth place, it must be noted that the apostle has not altogether left behind those forms of thought and expression which are inherited from a time when the Spirit of God was thought of without clear ascription of personality, and even quantitatively. See, e.g., I Thess. 1:5; Rom. 5:5; 8:23; I Cor. 2:4; II Cor. 1:22; Gal. 3:5; Phil. : 19. This type of expression is not indeed the dominant one in Paul, yet giving due weight to it and to the appar- ent reluctance of Paul directly to identify God and the Spirit, we may say that in his thought the Spirit of God is the personalized power of God, operative in the spirits of men, not distinguishable, in experience at least, from the heavenly Christ. If this is to us a difficult mid-station between identity with God and personality distinct from God, it is nevertheless apparently about the point which Paul occupied. 1 If indeed 6 Kc6pos here means God, we have an explicit affirmation of the identity of God and the Spirit, but this is a less probable interpretation than the one indicated above.</page><page sequence="18">58o THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY It is probably significant of the reflection which had been going on respecting the nature of rwpvea that in Paul for the first time we find the term used generically to denote the whole class of intelligent beings who are not conditioned by a fleshly body, and less frequently in a still more inclusive sense as embracing intelli- gent beings whether embodied or unembodied. See III, B, 5, and C in the list of meanings. The Pauline usage of 4#vx' is, formally at least, almost identical with that of the LXX, itself largely a reproduction of the Hebrew use of E... None of the Hebrew senses is lacking, and none of the senses found in later Greek but not in Hebrew is present. In one notable passage, however, in which the apostle quotes a phrase from the Old Testament, he gives to the terms 7rve3vpa and 41vxF an antithesis of meaning which they bear neither in the Old Testament nor, so far as has been observed, in any writer between the Old Testament and Paul. Discussing the resurrection and the body which is raised, quoting freely from Gen. 2:7, he says: Iy~ETero 6 rpwiTro S Opcros 'A8&amp;e els 4/vXPv Srav, and adds b i~xaros 'Ab&amp;a/ els 7rve^ a tworoto v (I Cor. 15:45). The contrast is twofold. Adam is alive; Christ is able to make alive (the dead). Adam became Vvxj4, which, according to a common usage of the Hebrew 16. and #4vxj in the LXX, is a living corporeal being. Christ became (by resurrection-note the context and Rom. I:4) rvEDua, i.e., not a wholly unembodied being, for this very chapter maintains the contrary respecting those who are raised from the dead, but one no longer having a terrestrial body of flesh and blood (vss. 40, 50). Such a contrast between rvevia and 1ivx' is wholly foreign to ordinary Greek thought, to which rpve3tza is the substance of which the soul is composed. Nor have we found in any Greek writer a placing of the Irvei3,a above the 'vXyq. It is still more foreign to the usage of the Hermetic writings, which make the 4,'vxt superior to the 'rvei3Ma. There is a certain approach to it in Philo, in that he makes the r'vLa superior to the I'vx7 and, of course, like the LXX, sometimes uses VIvxj of a person, not simply the soul. The use of 7rveV'a to denote an incor- poreal being is also not without precedent. But the distinctive feature of this passage, the use of 7rve^/a and 4ivx " to describe two</page><page sequence="19">SPIRIT, SOUL, AND FLESH 581 types of beings, the earthly, embodied, and the heavenly, super- corporeal, and the association with the latter of the idea of life- giving as contrasted with the simple life-possession of the former, has no observed precedent. The consideration of the Pauline use of oi&amp;p brings us into the heart of one of the most difficult and important aspects of our whole study. That a6-&amp;p sometimes has a physical sense is beyond ques- tion; that it has in Paul an ethical sense is scarcely less clear. What is important to determine is whether when it takes on its distinctly ethical sense, so as to denote a force that makes for sin in the lives of men, it still retains its physical sense, and whether as a force that makes for unrighteousness (be this physical or non-physical), it is an influence that may be resisted or a compelling and irre- sistible force. If the flesh in the physical sense is the latter, then the apostle must, logically at least, hold that the touch of the flesh is essentially polluting, and that there can be no salvation except through the release of the soul from the body. If, however, the u1p? that makes for evil is not a physical thing, or if the o-&amp;p? as physical is only an influence, an occasion of temptation, not a compelling force, salvation may be a spiritual, not a physical, process. These questions are of great importance. The answer to them will go far toward determining the whole character of Paul's conception of religion. It must, of course, be recognized on the one hand that the apostle has nowhere definitely formulated his doctrine, and on the other that there are several passages which at least on superficial reading seem to express a hard-and-fast ethical dualism. Such, for example, are Gal. 5:16-25 and Rom. 8:i-ii. In attempting to decide the question thus raised the following facts must be taken into account: First, throughout a large part of the whole period covered by our previous study there have appeared here and there evidences of a tendency to regard matter, or the human body as a material thing, as injurious to the intellectual or moral interests of man. This persistent conception takes various forms. Sometimes, as in Plato, the ultimate cause of disorder in the physical universe is found in the recalcitrancy of the matter of which it is composed.</page><page sequence="20">582 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY Sometimes, as in Plato again, the body is disparaged as a hindrance to philosophical thought. Sometimes, as in the Orphic teaching, incarnation is regarded as a punishment imposed upon the soul for sins committed by it in a previous state. Sometimes, as in Philo, there is emphasized the ordinary fact of experience, viz., that the bodily passions incite men to immoral acts. Nowhere is this conception expressed in a definitely formulated doctrine of an ultimate ethical dualism of spirit and matter, or of mind and matter, or of flesh and spirit, nor is it anywhere affirmed that sin in the universe is a necessary consequence of the matter in it, or sin in the individual, of embodiment, or that all good comes from the spirit by virtue of its immateriality. That such a view was held by the Gnostics comparatively early in the Christian period seems to be true. But the evidence does not seem to show that this development had already taken place in the New Testament period itself. Palestinian Judaism, which Paul's use of the word "spirit" suggests had influenced him much more than had non-Jewish thinking, had not developed the thought of the evil of the body or of matter as the cause of evil. In the Old Testament the flesh is weak but not sinful. Weber, indeed, in his Theologie des Talmud, maintained that rabbinism held an ethical dualism finding the evil impulse, the yeqer hara in the flesh. But, as mentioned in a previous article, Professor F. C. Porter has demonstrated the erroneousness of this view and shown that rabbinic Judaism held no doctrine of the evil of matter.' Even Philo, who agrees with Plato that the body is a drag upon the soul, holds no consistent doctrine of the evil of matter or of the body as the cause of sin. Our approach to the study of the New Testa- ment ought therefore to be with open mind on this point. There was an intellectual soil out of which there might easily spring the doctrine that embodied man is ipso facto a sinful man. But appar- ently it had not yet sprung up. If it had, it would not be certain that the New Testament writers would adopt it; nor, if it had not, would it be impossible for Paul to create it. We should therefore interrogate Paul and the other writers who followed him without prejudice. ' "The Yewer Hara: a Study in the Jewish Doctrine of Sin," in Yale Biblical and Semitic Studies, New York and London, 1go9.</page><page sequence="21">SPIRIT, SOUL, AND FLESH 583 Secondly, the New Testament usage of cra&amp;p is not simple but highly developed. There are found here not only the simple meaning "flesh" and that relatively easy metonymy "body," but those other meanings derived from the Hebrew, "corporeal being," "person," "kindred" (cf. American Journal of Theology, January, 1914, PP- 74-77, with pp. 574 ff.). Not only so, but in Paul and in writers influenced by him there appears a still further development of usage. The meaning 3, a) (see p. 574) is but a slight departure from the meaning "kindred" which the word had already taken over from the Hebrew. So also 5 is by easy metony- my developed from 4. Nor is the case materially different with 6. When op? has come to mean the basis of natural generation (3, a), it is but a short step to using it also for all that comes by heredity, the whole complex of life's relationships into which one enters by being born of whatever parents one is born of. This step Paul seems clearly to have taken in Phil 3:3-7. By virtue of the flesh he was not only a circumcised son of the race of Israel and of the tribe of Benjamin, but an orthodox Hebrew, a Pharisee, a persecutor of the unorthodox, and, as concerns the righteousness that can be achieved under legalism, above reproach. Thus it denotes the whole of his personality and possessions except that which comes through a distinct personal religious experience. At this point it is important to observe three facts. a) The word is at this point of the development no longer an exclusively physical term. Indeed, it is not such in any of the preceding meanings, 3, 4, 5, unless possibly in 3, a). But here -more clearly than at any preceding point the term has become super-physical. b) The term carries with it no suggestion of positive evil. All the things that Paul comprehended under the term "flesh" are in themselves good, and so regarded by him except the persecu- tion of the church, and even this he cites as an illustration of his zeal for God. His conversion is not the repudiation of the evil, but the turning from the good to the better. The doctrine that underlies the passage is" that true life is achieved only when to all that nature gives, though it has given its best, there is added the gift of the Spirit of God.</page><page sequence="22">584 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY c) Thus the idea of the aap? is here brought into definite rela- tion to the 7rveVia. The aap? can do much; it is the -irvepa only that can produce the true, the perfect. But to this step there is added one more, by which for the first time the term takes on a distinctly ethical sense. Had we only Rom. 8: i-11 to deal with, it would not be clear that this is the case. For this whole passage might perhaps be explained from the point of view of Phil. 3. It is the weakness of the flesh that is emphasized in vs. 3, and the walking according to the flesh might be thought of as the conduct of those who are controlled by those things in life that come by heredity, not by the spirit, good though the former are. And even when it is said that the mind of the flesh is enmity against God, this might mean only that the love of things that one inherits-the life of the man who follows the current of heredity-inevitably issues in the rejection of the will of God. But it is clear that in any case the apostle has here pushed his thought of the evil consequences of following the flesh much further than he does in the passage from the later letter to the Philippians. And when we turn back to Gal. 5:16-25 we seem to see clearly that the apostle had already come to include in his thought of the flesh not only the good things that are inadequate, but those impulses to evil which also seem to be born in us; in other words, to let the flesh stand for one aspect of heredity-the inborn tendency to evil. But if so, there are certain additional facts that require to be observed. a) It is almost beyond question that the meaning which we find in Gal., chap. 5, represents an advance upon that found in Phil., chap. 3, not the reverse. As out of the meaning 3, a), basis of natural generation, there arises 6, the total product and outcome of heredity, so out of the thought of the moral inadequacy of the latter there might spring the conception of the hereditary tendency to evil.' x In Rom. 7:17-8:8 we seem to have as it were an epitome of the working of the apostle's mind. In chap. 7 it is not the flesh that is the evil force, but sin stimulated by law. The flesh is inadequate, unable without God's Spirit to respond to the inner imperative. In 8:3 it is still the weakness, not the power for evil, of the flesh that is spoken of, and only in the latter part of the passage does the idea of weakness and unresponsiveness gradually merge into that of hostility to God.</page><page sequence="23">SPIRIT, SOUL, AND FLESH 585 b) This being the case, the fact that the meaning which repre- sents the latest step in the evolution appears in one of Paul's earliest letters, and that the earlier, non-ethical meaning appears in one of his latest letters, shows that development of the distinctly ethical meaning did not involve the repudiation of the thought expressed by the unethical sense. c) The relation of the several meanings of the term makes it improbable that the aop? which is hostile to God, and the works of which are evil, is a purely physical thing, or that it is evil because it is material. The strictly material sense is left behind several steps before we reach the distinctly ethical meaning. To introduce it at this point is superfluous and illogical.' d) Not even to the crdp? as a force that makes for evil does Paul ascribe compelling power. In faith with its consequent vital fellowship with God, there is a power adequate to overcome the force that makes for evil (Rom. 6: I, 2; Gal. 5:i6, 22, 23). e) So far from sharing the feeling expressed by Plato, Seneca, and Plutarch that true blessedness is achievable only by getting SAgainst this interpretation of the apostle's thought there may be urged his phrase v' 6Ob#LaCTL oCapKcb &amp;lcaprias in Rom. 8:3, and the Trov^ aclros roo Oavcd'rov of 7:24. But the former phrase by no means of necessity involves an analytic judgment that the flesh in the likeness of which Christ came is by its nature sinful, intrinsically tainted with sin; nor is the flesh by any necessity of usage or context to be taken in a purely physical sense. The latter interpretation indeed, with or without the former, would make Paul a docetist, which he certainly was not. The view most consistent with Pauline usage is that which takes odp? as standing for a corporeally conditioned being (referring to man of course) and &amp;*uapTria as in effect the predicate of a synthetic proposition. The whole phrase then means simply that when Christ came he did not differ in outward appearance from sinful men. If 7:24 were an expression of desire for deliverance from the body in death, one might plausibly argue that Paul conceived of the body as the cause of sin and release from it as the only way of escape from sin. But this is manifestly not the case, since Paul never thinks of Christ as the author or cause of death, as on this view vs. 25 would imply that he did. It is rather a moral victory which he desires, and doubtless in the present life. That he uses the word "body" at this point instead of "sin" bears witness to the apostle's deep sense of the intimate relation between the evil impulses, which he has previously personified under the name "sin," and the body (cf. vs. 23 and I Cor. 9:27), and the addition of To70 Oapdrov reflects his belief that sin is the cause of death. The passage is one of several that bear testimony that Paul was not blind to the obvious fact of human experience that the tendency to sin is closely associated with the physical nature; but it by no means follows nor is it probable that the body as such is, in his view, the compelling cause of sin.</page><page sequence="24">586 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY rid of the body, Paul believed that the soul could not be wholly happy without a body. This thought, which is somewhat more clearly expressed in I Cor., chap. 15, and II Cor., chap. 5, and sug- gested by I Thess. 5:23, is implied in vs. ii of the very passage now under consideration. The culmination of the work of the Spirit is that through it God makes alive our mortal bodies. It is true, indeed, as I Cor., chap. 15, shows, that the making alive involves a transformation into a spiritual body; but a spiritual body is still a body; and that not the transformation of the body but the permanent possession of it is what the apostle here has chiefly in mind is shown by the fact that he makes no mention in vs. i i of the former, but speaks only of bringing to life again our mortal bodies. Had the apostle thought of the body as such as the cause of sin, he must here have spoken, not of its being made alive (in the resurrection), but of its being destroyed, or of the spirit as being released from it.' Had he thought of its materiality as the cause of sin he must at the least have spoken here of its transformation; cf. Phil. 3:21. Thus in three respects the evidence is against the view that Paul found in the flesh as a physical thing a compelling force for evil. The flesh that makes for evil is not the body or matter as such, but an inherited impulse to evil. This force is not com- pulsory, but can be resisted by the power of the spirit. The body is not an evil, but a factor of the best life. The inherited evil impulse is, of course, related to the bodily life. The body. is inferior to the spirit and the occasion of temptation. But embodied man may, by the power of the spirit, triumph over all evil tendencies. The foregoing discussion of rvu/a and ard&amp;p suggests what further examination confirms, that when these two terms stand in I It may be alleged that the usage of the time requires us to understand Paul as actually personalizing, not simply personifying, sin, that by it he means a demon and that the abode of this demon is for him in the flesh, in the sense either of the body or of the whole physical environment. (See Dibelius, Die Geisterwelt im Glauben des Paulus, pp. II9 ff.) The writer finds himself unconvinced by the arguments that seem to some to establish this view. But even if it be correct, it does not materially affect our interpretation of adip, but only requires the substitution of the idea of a demon for the more vague expression "hereditary impulse" used above.</page><page sequence="25">SPIRIT, SOUL, AND FLESH 587 antithesis, as they frequently do in Paul, it is by no means always the same meanings that are contrasted. In Gal. 6:8; I Cor. 5:5; II Cor. 7: I; Rom. 2:28, 29; Col. 2:5, the contrast is between the flesh, or the body, and the spirit of man-an antithesis that in most Greek writers would have been expressed by a/ia and 4'vx' -but in most of the foregoing cases at least with an emphasis on the religious capacity of the 7rvne3a that would not have been conveyed by 4Ivxj. In Gal. 6: 8 the sowing to the flesh is the devo- tion of one's goods (see vs. 6) and energies to the satisfaction of the demands of the body; sowing to the spirit is devoting these things to the development of the spirit-life, which is both intel- lectual and religious. In Gal. 3:3 the flesh is, as in the preceding cases (see especially Rom. 2:28, 29), the physical flesh, that in which the circumcision which they were urged to accept took place; but the spirit is the Spirit of God, which they received (vs. 2) when they accepted the gospel and by which miracles were wrought among them (vs. 5). In Gal. 4:23 adpt, as in Rom. 9:3, 5, 8, is clearly the basis of natural generation, the contrast being with the promise in fulfilment of which Isaac was born extraordinarily; in the application of the allegory b yEPvvrl'eS Kata a pKa (vs. 29) refers to the Jew who depends upon his heredity for salvation (the word thus verging toward meaning 6) in contrast with one whose life is according to the Spirit of God, or possibly with one who has been born according to the Spirit, an idea sug- gested in Rom. 6:4 and further developed in John 3:6. In Rom. i:3, despite the similarity of the phrases to those in Gal. 4:23, 29, a&amp;p? is probably to be taken as denoting a corporeally conditioned being, and wrve/.a as a generic term for an unembodied being (III, B, 5), KaTa meaning "viewed as" and the whole passage indi- cating the high rank of Jesus among earthly (corporeally condi- tioned) beings, and, secondly, among holy heavenly (not corporeally conditioned) beings. Somewhat similar is the contrast in I Tim. 3: 6, but o'dp? probably denotes the body or the corporeally con- ditioned mode of life, and ?rvpebgart, by a further metonymy sug- gested by the desire to parallel 'v uapKL, denotes an incorporeal mode of being rather than an incorporeal being. In Phil. 3:3 rve^ a manifestly denotes the Spirit of God, and ai&amp;p?, as already</page><page sequence="26">588 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY pointed out, all that man obtains by heredity. In Rom. 7:5 acpaP probably means the totality of the life apart from the spirit (as in Phil. 3:3), while nrvde.a in 7:6 stands for the human spirit as the seat of religious life. In Rom. 8:4-II there is, as indicated above, a gradual transition from this meaning of ao&amp;p to the more posi- tively ethical sense, while in vss. 12, 13 there is probably a return to the earlier meaning. Throughout these verses rvvPeua denotes the Spirit of God, and sometimes the Spirit of Christ. The absence of the article gives the phrases in which it is lacking a qualitative force, by which it approximates to the generic sense, as inclusive of the divine and human spirit, but probably always retaining in the apostle's mind a reference to the divine Spirit. In Gal. 5: 17-25 the flesh is the force that makes for sin, and 7rv'eiua is the divine Spirit, the omission of the article having the same effect as in Rom., chap. 8. THE USAGE OF THE SYNOPTIC GOSPELS AND ACTS In the Synoptic Gospels rveVDya always means "spirit." The meanings "wind" and "breath" do not occur. As applied to the human spirit, the reference to the religious life is less frequent than in Paul, and the idea of the human spirit as permeated by the divine does not occur. On the other hand, we find here instances of irveDua denoting that in man which departs at death, or returns in revivification, for which Greek writers use 1vx i only, but Jewish- Greek sometimes 4Ivxq and sometimes, following the Hebrew, 7rvPe ta. Cf. I Kings 17:21 (Hebrew and LXX); Jos., War, VII, 185, and II, 156. Akin to this latter is the use of the term of a ghost, a specter. Akin also, as is shown in Jos., War, VII, 185, is the use of rvue^a to denote a demon. This usage, not found at all in Paul, is frequent in the Synoptic Gospels. In the body of the synoptists rvwe^a, referring to the Spirit of God, is used almost exclusively in the charismatic sense, referring to the Spirit as the cause of such extraordinary phenomena as prophecy, and of power over demons. Only in the John the Baptist prediction of the baptism in the Holy Spirit by his great successor, and in connection with Jesus' own baptism and temptation, does the term seem to approach an ethical</page><page sequence="27">SPIRIT, SOUL, AND FLESH 589 reference, and even here there is no sharp distinction of the ethical from the charismatic. The use with reference to the conception of Jesus in the womb of his mother, found only in the infancy sections of Matthew and Luke, is without parallel in literature earlier than the New Testa- ment or in the earlier parts of the New Testament itself. It apparently represents a unique development of the charismatic sense of the word. The synoptic usage of 4Ivxj and aoip calls for little comment. It is substantially that of Jewish-Greek writers generally. There is no occurrence of the characteristically Pauline uses of ao&amp;p or any suggestion of Pauline influence. The whole evidence of the Synoptic Gospels tends to confirm the impression gained from the study of Paul, that his usage is not as a whole a reflection of com- mon usage in his day, but to an important extent the result either of exceptional influences or of his own thinking. The only important respect in which the usage of Acts differs from that of the synoptists is in the non-appearance of v~rvva in reference to the conception of Jesus, and in the ascription to the Spirit of God of power in the external world (Acts 8:39; cf. II Kings 2:16). THE USAGE OF THE JOHANNINE WRITINGS The Fourth Gospel contains one instance of R'evja meaning "wind" (3:8), introduced for the purpose of comparing the action of 7rve^ a as spirit and 7reua as wind. Aside from this exceptional case and the employment of the word of that which departs in death (John 19:30) the Johannine use of the word is very similar to that of Paul. It is used neither of a demon, as so commonly in the Synoptic Gospels and Acts, but not in Paul, nor in reference to the conception of Jesus in his mother's womb. In reference to the Spirit of God r7nri3a occurs in three ways. In chap. i it is used in evident dependence on the synoptists, of the descent of the Spirit on Jesus at his baptism. In chaps. 3 and 6 it is used, much as in Paul, of the Spirit as the source of life to men. In chaps. 14-17 it is employed of the Spirit as not yet present, but as coming to supply the place of Jesus. Here, as in Paul, there is no</page><page sequence="28">590 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY clear distinction of function between the Spirit and the heavenly Christ. The Johannine representation is the Pauline conception converted from experience into prediction of experience. To these references to the Spirit of God there must be added the unique statement of John 4: 24 that God is spirit or a spirit. This, as already pointed out, Paul never says, but this use of the word as a generic term for incorporeal intelligent being is illustrated in Paul. The proposition itself had been affirmed two hundred years before by Posidonius, but with the addition of the expression Pvopbv KaO 7rvp&amp;wes. The absence of these adjectives in John marks not only the elimination from the idea of God of the notion of materiality suggested by wrvp&amp;ess (or at least its reduction to a minimum), but the inclusion of the idea of intelligence in that of iriesoa, marked by the fact that it is no longer necessary to add Poepb6 to express this idea. IIH~e6a used in reference to men denotes the seat of intellectual or emotional life, chiefly with reference to the religious aspects. John 3:6 b is without exact parallel, but explicable in view of iruevi9a to denote the spirit of man permeated with the Spirit of God. See I Cor. 14: 14, 15, 16. For the idea of a human spirit under the ethical domination of the Spirit of God, Paul uses iv ru'ebgiar (Rom. 8:9) and other similar phrases, but closely approaches the Johannine use in Rom. 8:Io. In I John we find the same use in general of irvu'eia with reference to the Spirit of God. The generic use comes out distinctly in its employment as an inclusive term covering both the Spirit of God and those other beings which purport to be such, but whose anti- Christian utterances betray their real character. See I John 4: 1 ff., and cf. list of meanings, III, B, 5. Here also we are on familiar Pauline ground. Cf. I Cor. 12:10o. The Apocalypse has no usages that call for special discussion. JvX f in John and I John is used chiefly in the phrase "to lay down one's life." The instances in the sense of soul are of the familiar type. The use of aa&amp;p in John, chap. 3 (the others require no discus- sion), reminds us of the Pauline use in Phil. 3:3, 4. In John, as in Paul, there is the thought that the Spirit of God is essential to true</page><page sequence="29">SPIRIT, SOUL, AND FLESH 591 human life, and the use of oa&amp;p in antithesis to rveiua in a way to suggest that it denotes that which comes by heredity and is not dominated by the Spirit. Paul the Pharisee might almost have sat for the picture of Nicodemus; and the language of Jesus to Nicodemus, affirming the inadequacy of all that had come to him by heredity and the indispensableness of the transforming power of the Spirit, reads like an affirmation in general terms of what Paul had learned by personal experience.' But though there is this clear affinity between the Johannine and the Pauline thought, neither the Fourth Gospel nor I John furnishes any certain example of the Pauline use of cap? meaning the force in men that makes for evil. I John 2: i6 might seem to be such a case, but the parallelism of the phrase "the lust of the eyes," in which no evil sense attaches to eyes in themselves, makes it probable that there is none such in the word "flesh," but that in itself it simply means the body, the evil sense of the phrase being suggested by the word brLGvula (cf. Rom. 7:7). It is clear in any case and most important to observe that to the flesh in the physical ' Considerations of space forbid an extended discussion of all the interpretations which have been or might be proposed for this verse. It must suffice to call attention to a few points of importance. (a) There is no presumption in favor of an interpretation that takes the two instances of edpt in the same sense, for this is not the case with the two instances of 7rve0Oa in the second clause. The first is the Spirit of God; the second cannot be this, but must refer in some way to man, and indeed quite clearly in the sense of man filled with the Spirit of God and thus born anew. The two senses must manifestly be related but not necessarily identical. (b) Aside from objections to a strict identity of meaning, the interpretation, "that which is born of the body is body, " is foreign to the context; for that which Nicodemus possessed was manifestly far more than a body. (c) Nor is the meaning " that which is born of a corporeal being is a corporeal being" more satisfactory, for if the idea of moral deficiency be not included in the term, it is impertinent to the discussion, and if this idea is associated with both instances, it would imply what is again wholly out of harmony with the context, that the moral deficiency of the child was conditioned on the moral state of the parent. (d) Nor can it be translated "that which is born of a sinful being is a sinful being," for similar reasons, and because there is no evidence that adpp means a sinful being. The interpretation which is most consonant with the context and best sustained by lexical usage may be paraphrased somewhat thus: That which is born by natural generation is, however good, inadequate to fit one for the Kingdom of God. Only that which is produced by the Spirit of God is like unto it, being a human spirit filled with the divine. The whole sentence is a formulation in intentionally sharply antithetical phrase of the same doctrine that is implied in Paul's experiential statement in Phil. 3:3 ff-</page><page sequence="30">592 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY sense this writer attached no taint of moral evil. For it is one of the cardinal points for which he contends that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, evidently meaning to affirm the reality of the bodily life of Jesus (I John 4:2; cf. II John, vs. 7), yet clearly also believing in his sinlessness. Of similar purport is John I: I4; for though the term o'pt does not mean flesh in the physical sense, but a corporeally conditioned being, yet no one who believed, as this writer did, that Jesus was sinless could affirm that he became a corporeal being if he also believed that to be corporeally con- ditioned was ipso facto to be sinful.' It may be said, however, that by their opposition to the doctrine that Jesus Christ is not come in the flesh, these writings testify to the existence, in their time, of the belief that the flesh is neces- sarily polluting. But not even this is a certain or even probable inference from the evidence of this letter. For I John 5:6-8 shows that the docetism which this epistle opposes is that which affirmed that the Christ entered the body of Jesus in the baptism and withdrew before the crucifixion; and this type of docetism has its basis, not in the affirmation of the evil of matter, but in the desire not to affirm that the Christ suffered. On the one hand, therefore, the evidence of the Johannine writings shows that in the circle from which they issued the flesh was not regarded as causing sin, and on the other fails to show that they were directly in contact and conflict with such a view. This fact is not without its reflex value in confirming our con- clusion that Paul, who wrote earlier in a similar environment, or under less influence from Greek thought, did not impute sin to the body as its cause. THE USAGE OF THE REMAINING BOOKS The uses of 2rpe^ia in Hebrews are quite diverse and interesting, but present no special difficulty. Nor do 4I'vxqi and od'p? call for x The abstinence of this writer (or these writers) from such language as Paul uses in Gal., chap. 5, and Rom., chap. 8, may be due to a wish to avoid words which by their ambiguity might seem to imply that there was. moral taint in incarnation, and so suggest that Jesus either did not really come in the flesh or that he was not sinless. It may be due to their disposition to trace all sin to the devil. What is of importance is that the idea of a necessary moral taint in the body as composed of matter is definitely excluded.</page><page sequence="31">SPIRIT, SOUL, AND FLESH 593 extended discussion. Respecting rvei3Aa we may note its use alongside of gIvx as an element of man's nature (4: 12), as in I Thess. 5:23, but probably neither here nor there as expressive of a tri- chotomous view; its reference to the eternal Spirit of Christ, but qualitatively spoken of (9:14); and its broadly generic use (i: 14; 12:9). Zdp? has no ethical implications.' Limitations of space forbid the extended discussion of such interesting passages as I Pet. 3: 18; 4:6; II Pet. 2:10, 18. It must suffice to call attention to the fact that whatever the precise sense of the terms or the grammatical force of the datives, the basis of the antithesis between the ao'&amp;p and 7rveia is the idea of cor- poreality and incorporeality. yvXif in I Peter is noteworthy because of its distinctly religious sense and its futuristic aspect. The V/vX77 is the soul as the seat of religion (2: II, 25), capable of existence after death, and its salvation is to be revealed in the last time (1:5, 9; 4:19). Cf. the similar use in Jas. 1:21; 5:20. This usage has apparently had more influence than any other in the New Testament in fixing the meaning of the word "soul" in modern religious terminology. In II Pet. 2: 10, i8 cr&amp;p? may perhaps denote the body as itself the cause of sin. It would not be strange if this writer had already come to hold this view which was held by others in his day or soon afterward. On the other hand, the passage does not strictly imply anything more than that the writer recognizes the fact, recognition of which involves no philosophic theory, viz., that the body furnishes incitements and temptations to sin, and to follow these is sin. It is perhaps not without signifi- cance that in the kindred Book of Jude it is clear that aaop?, though used in speaking of sensual sins, itself means only the body. Note especially vs. 8, in which it is not the aaip that defiles but that is defiled. It is most probable that the usage of II Peter is the same. 1 In Heb. 12:9, it is most consonant with the context and the Alexandrian character of the book to understand that "fathers of our flesh " refers to our human fathers as those who beget our bodies, and that "the Father of the spirits" designates God as the source of the spirits of men. Nor is the absence of a possessive pronoun in the second phrase a serious objection to this view. See Matt. 26:41; 27 :So, and cf. John ii: 33 with Mark 8:12. This interpretation need not, however, imply that each spirit is a fresh product of divine generative power. The phrase probably means only that the spirit comes eventually from God, and is not a product of natural generation. See Wisd. Sol. 8: Ig.</page><page sequence="32">594 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY IIevIarLK6s, 'J'VXLKbw, AND ZapKLK6S (XpKwOS) The problem of the relation of these adjectives to one another demands a few words. The difficulty pertains almost wholly to #vXLtK6 and the manifestly derogatory sense which it bears in the New Testament.' In I Cor. 15:44 the ordinary body of men in this life is described as #vxLIKb o~&amp;a, in contrast with the post-resurrection body, which is IrvevarTLK,6v. The term is associated (vs. 45) with the fact that Adam was a Vlvx"i and of the earth earthy (vs. 46), in contrast with the risen Christ, who is 7rved3a and in heaven. The basis of Ihe antithesis between the two adjectives is in the antithetical use of the two nouns. The way in which the words are introduced seems to imply that vUXLK6S in this sense is already familiar, and this is probably the case, despite the fact that no earlier examples of such a use have been pointed out, and that there is only a suggestion of a basis for it in Philo. In I Cor. 2:14 VIvxK6bs occurs in antithesis to rvevia7tK6s in vs. 15, and as a synonym of a-pK vos in 3:1, which is further defined by the phrase "babes in Christ." These facts indicate that 4uvxKbs denotes one who is not possessed of the Spirit of God--not rvevaru~K6~ in the sense of Gal. 6:I . This conception is nearer than that of 15:44-46 to Philo's view, that there are some men who have only 4.vx", lacking the gift of the Spirit of God; cf. above, p. 577.

I:I [1?]; 7:14; 15:27; I Cor. 2:13; 9:II [?]; 12:1; 14:1; Eph. 5:Ig [?]; Col. I:g9[?]; 3: I6 [?]); (c) pertaining or adapted to the spirit of man (Rom. I:ii [ ?]; I Cor. 9:11 [?]; 1o:3, 4; Col.

With this use of the term that in Jas. 3:I5 is practically identical., FINAL SUMMARY It remains to state briefly some of the more important results to which, in the judgment of the writer, this study leads. i. The New Testament use of 7rve0a, 1vXJ, and a'&amp;p? is not simply a reflection of earlier usage, but has certain marked differ- ences from that of any earlier literature. As respects /'vxtq, these differences are slight, being chiefly a retirement of the word into less prominence, and a certain emphasis on the religious aspects of the term. The difference is greater in respect to rvev3a, but greatest in respect to aop?. 2. New Testament usage is much nearer to that of Jewish- Greek writers, and indeed to that of the Old Testament, than to that of Greek writers in general, or to that of any other literature of which we have knowledge. 3. -The peculiarities of New Testament usage appear most strongly in Paul, and it is probable that it is to him that we owe them, either as originator or transmitter, and most likely the former. 4. Of the characteristics of New Testament usage which dif- ferentiate it either from all previous usage or from that of non- Jewish Greek, the following are the most important: a) HIIvea is no longer prevailingly a substantial term, as in Greek writers, but, with few exceptions, individualizing, as in Jewish Greek, following the Hebrew. b) Its most frequent use is with reference to the Spirit of God. For this there is only the slightest precedent in non-Jewish-Greek writers. New Testament, especially Pauline, usage shows a marked advance even on Jewish Greek. c) For the exaltation of irvz'epa over 1vxy7 there is no observed previous parallel. It marks an advance on Philo, for which there ' On a usage of the magical papyri which seems to Reitzenstein to point to the source of the Pauline antithesis of IrPevAarTLK6S and 4WVXLK6S, but which seems to the writer to furnish a slender support to the view, see Reitzenstein, Hellenistische Mys- terien-Religionen (Leipzig and Berlin, I9Io), pp. 42 ff.</page><page sequence="34">596 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY is no precedent in non-Jewish Greek, and only partial and imperfect parallels in the magical papyri. It is the reverse of Hermetic usage. d) The use of 7rvev^Aa as a generic term for incorporeal beings (inclusive in Paul of those who have heavenly bodies) is found in Paul and those who followed him. No precisely similar use is found in earlier writers, though a basis for it is found in the appli- cation of 7rv-e3a on the one side to God and on the other to the demons. e) The clear distinction between the charismatic and ethical work of the Spirit of God and the exaltation of the latter over the former is probably original with Paul; it at any rate receives from him an emphasis found nowhere else before his time, or in the New Testament. f) The extension of the meaning of arap? from the basis of natural generation and kinship to mean all that one acquires by kinship and heredity, and its still further extension, or rather limitation, to denote the force in men that makes for evil, the hereditary impulse to sin, are, so far as we can see, Pauline con- tributions to the usage of this word. 5. Neither the evidence of contemporary usage nor that of the New Testament itself warrants us in finding in Paul or in the Johannine writings the notion that the flesh is by reason of its materiality a force that makes for evil, or that a corporeal being is by virtue of that fact a sinful being. It may perhaps be found in II Peter, but probably not even there.</page></plain_text>
