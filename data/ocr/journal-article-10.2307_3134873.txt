<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONCEPTS OF SPIRITUAL NOURISHMENT IN THE ANDES AND EUROPE: ROSARIES IN CROSS-CULTURAL CONTEXTS PENELOPE DRANSART University of Wales, Lampeter This article explores visual imagery connected with the Christian rosary and its connota- tions of spiritual nourishment in European art and Andean ritual practices. Early eighteenth- century religious art inspired by a vision received by Isidoro of Seville, a Capuchin friar, presented the Virgin Mary as the Divine Shepherdess with her flock of Christians, depicted as sheep with roses in their mouths. This imagery resonates in the flowering ceremony prac- tised by Aymara pastoralists in Isluga, Chile. The floreo serves as a rite of passage for herd animals, its intention being to enhance their fertility by making them 'flower'. However the congruence between the visual codes produced by Europeans and Andeans conveys related but different social and moral messages. Whereas sheep can represent human beings in Chris- tian art, they cannot stand in for human beings in Isluga, since Isluga people recognize that both human and herd animals require spiritual nourishment. The term 'rosary' refers both to a set of conventionalized Christian practices and to the beads used in cycles of prayer and meditation. Rosary scholarship to date has largely addressed questions concerning the religious symbolism of the rosary and its origins in Europe.' However, when Isluga people in the highlands of northern Chile first told me in the 1980s that they apply the Spanish term rosario to a type of necklace which I had not immediately rec- ognized to be a rosary, I began to appreciate that much rosary scholarship has been devoted to exploring the medieval origins of these devotional objects and the practices associated with them. There is much work, too, on the rela- tionship of the Christian rosary to the prayer beads of other religions (such as those used by Hindus and Muslims). It occurred to me that a study of the Christian rosary in cross-cultural contexts and the examination of an appar- ently small aspect of material culture would cast light on wider issues con- cerning responses to evangelization in the historical relationship between Europe and the Andes. The unusual rosaries that women in Isluga possess provide a means for exploring issues concerned with what I call here 'spiri- tual nourishment'. Publications in anthropology and art history that have appeared since I started studying a specific ceremony among Aymara-speaking camelid herders of Isluga in 1986 have encouraged me to look anew at my fieldwork. First, George Marcus and Fred Myers remind us that 'it is no longer possible for ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2002. J. Roy. anthrop. Inst. (N.S.) 8, 1-21</page><page sequence="2">PENELOPE DRANSART anthropologists to address subjects "cleanly"- that is, as subjects in relation to whom they, or their discipline of study, do not already have a history of rela- tions' (1995: 2). The contributions included in their edited volume, The traffic in culture, are views that arise from what they call the 'implicated relations' between observers and observed (Marcus &amp; Myers 1995: 3). In another edited volume with contributions from art historians, Claire Farago's starting-point was her realization that published writings on the history of Western aesthetic theory have not examined the impact of contact with non-European societies prior to the nineteenth century (Farago 1995: 1). She invited contributions that attempted'to define a new program for the study of Renaissance visual culture focused on cultural exchange' (Farago 1995: 2). Thirdly, Mary Bouquet (1996) has addressed what she calls the visual imper- ative of representational objects in order to demonstrate how such objects bear complex, condensed meanings that can cross from one conceptual field to another. She argued that there is an imperative need to examine how genealo- gies have been collected and displayed diagrammatically as an indispensable aspect of anthropological study of kinship systems. Elsewhere, Bouquet's ex- ample of family trees in European culture shows how biblical imagery that was originally interpreted as a prophetic image of the Immaculate Concep- tion of the Virgin became transmuted into 'an essentially backward-oriented genealogical motif for tracing ancestry' (Bouquet 1995: 43). From her use of the phrase 'the visual imperative', I understand her arguments to be based on the premiss that people's understanding of the organization of visual phe- nomena plays an important role in the development of culturally specific verbal and non-verbal concepts. The Christian rosary is another item of European material culture that became associated with a particularly intense set of symbolically expressed, densely packed meanings, especially from late medieval times and the period of the Counter-Reformation. In the late fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, Spanish soldiers and priests carried rosaries with them in their quest to bring the Americas into the Spanish empire, and into the fold of Christianity.2 A study of rosaries in cross-cultural contexts demonstrates the complex charac- ter of the history of relations between European and Andean peoples, and it also throws light on the intersections of belief that arise in such contexts. Unlike the family trees studied by Bouquet, in which data are organized in a branching and linear fashion, rosaries organize information in an apparently closed circuit of a cyclical character. As will be demonstrated below, rosaries belong to overlapping conceptual fields - both European and Andean. One part of the re-examination of my experiences in Isluga in the light of the literature cited above is my own growing realization of the one-sided character of my initial interpretation of Isluga rosaries. In the 1980s, I discussed rosaries with Isluga women and I was impressed by the manner in which they wore these items of women's dress for specific occasions that emphasized their amuletic properties (Dransart 1998). In my 1998 article, I emphasized the apotropaic qualities of these rosaries, perhaps because of the historical contingencies that dominated events at the time of my early fieldwork.3 Throughout the 1980s, members of the village where I spent most of my time in Isluga had refused to entertain the 2</page><page sequence="3">PENELOPE DRANSART missionaries of a Pentecostal, evangelical sect who had managed to convert many other Isluga communities to Protestantism. Enquelga was different in that it proudly proclaimed its Catholic identity throughout most of the 1980s. However, on my return to the community in 1989, I found that several fami- lies had decided to become members of the Iglesia Evangelica Pentecostal. The changing historical circumstances which I observe on my repeat visits to Isluga are enabling me to situate my work on Andean ritual and the ma- terial culture of religion in an historical context that takes into account more complex intersections of belief. My aim here is to examine how certain visual phenomena (European rosary imagery and the visual aspects of Andean ritual) serve as expressions of culturally embedded notions of spiritual nourishment. These 'images' have been drawn into the interactions between Andean and European peoples. They figure in the 'implicated relations' between local people and outsiders, and they are also implicated in the process whereby con- densed meanings cross from one conceptual field to another. A nexus of Aymara themes, represented visually and enacted in ritual in Isluga, appears to have drawn on both Spanish and Andean sources. The former is constituted by imagery of the Virgin Mary nourishing her flock of faithful Christians (Fig. 1). The Andean imagery occurs in a ceremony observed in many parts of the Andes (Fig. 2). It is known in Spanish as the floreo, and it is intended to enhance the fertility of herd animals by making them 'flower' (Dransart 1997). The floreo is a contemporary ceremony practised by Aymara- and Quechua-speakers in the Andes, but many observers consider it to have a particularly 'native' ancestry, perhaps dating from Pre-Hispanic times. Indeed, I have argued for this myself (Dransart 1991), and some of the evidence for this ancestry is briefly presented below. The ceremony as it is observed today in Isluga seems, in addition, to have incorporated responses to Christian imagery introduced to the Andes in the eighteenth century. Paintings and sculpture of the Virgin Mary as the Divine Shepherdess depict Mary seated and surrounded by a flock of sheep. She is feeding her sheep with roses (Carcelen 1992: 469; Dransart 1998: 138-9). A version of the painting in the Museo Nacional de Arte, La Paz, makes the connections between rosaries, roses, and sheep particularly clear, as the backs of some of the sheep are draped with rosaries. In this iconography, the sheep stand for Christians, and the roses for the spiritual nourishment of the rosary. In the Isluga ceremony, llamas, alpacas, and sheep are made to flower; they are ritually 'dressed', which involves tying strands of red and pink dyed fleece to their backs and inserting ear tassels. These ritually invested animals seem to be acting as the visual counterparts of the sheep with roses in their mouths and rosaries draped over their backs in the European imagery. Given my bringing-together a particular set of Spanish-American images and an Isluga ceremonial practice, I note with interest Marietta Ortega Perrier's use of Christian imagery for understanding the expression of ritual identity in Isluga. She argues that religious imagery performed what she calls a 'transcendental role' in the transmission of Christian beliefs in the period in which the Andes were evangelized (Ortega Perrier 1998: 123).4 Many native Andean peoples did not read, nor did they share a common vernacular lan- guage with the missionaries. Christian imagery would have constituted an important means for communicating information, but Ortega Perrier (1998: 3</page><page sequence="4">PENELOPE DRANSART FIGURE 1. Anonymous, Cuzco School. 'The Divine Shepherdess', early eighteenth century. Courtesy of, and photo, the Museo Nacional de Arqueologia, Antropologia e Historia del Peru. 124) points out that the complex beliefs that informed the imagery might have been subject to different interpretations among people unable to read the accompanying texts. The art historian, James Elkins, has emphasized just how complex images are, since they are neither wholly inside nor wholly outside systematic, logical, and mathematical structures of meaning. He 4</page><page sequence="5">PENELOPE DRANSART 5 _~~~~~~~~~ r-: (9 oo CO _ ~~~~~~~~~~~~S ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~p__ :I s~ ?? o ii _iI~~BB. - ~ ----- u 4.a __ _S S ! i C\ _~~~J~~ o. i *| - ' i _ ! .

I agree with Elkins's assessment of images as being unstable; he argues that it is only with time that pictures become amenable to historical and semiotic analyses (Elkins 1998: 124-5). Michael Sallnow (1991: 137) characterized Andean Christianity as being 'internally contradictory'. I do not choose to evaluate it under such terms. Instead, I wish to explore the instability of European and Andean visual phe- nomena, in order to address something of the spectrum of meanings that have accrued through time to religious images used in the Andes. The Christian materials introduced by missionaries to Andean peoples had their own para- doxical character, too. A simple anecdote demonstrates that the obduracy of images has been a recent factor. In 1997, Don Marcos Castro, a learned and elderly Isluga man showed me Catholic literature given to him some years previously by the parish priest. He pointed to a line drawing of the Holy Ghost in the form of a hovering bird, and he said that it was an eagle before correcting himself to say that it was a dove. The depiction of the Third Person of the Trinity as a dove is a commonplace of European art. Yet Don Marcos was aware, like Marina Warner, that doves do not hover. Warner (1983: 38) observed that interpretations of the Holy Ghost have caused many a com- mentator to espouse views considered to be heretical and that most artists have not dared to stray from iconographic orthodoxy. Hence the Third Person of the Trinity is depicted in European art as a bird poised in the manner of a hawk or a lark, but it is painted white.5 This demonstrates that visual imagery often possesses a disquieting character. Elsewhere, I have argued that certain visual phenomena are long lived in the Andes, but they are not associated with essentialistic meanings (Dransart 1997: 95). This is equally true of the rosary imagery discussed in the present article. The emergent rosary forms in Europe and the Andes express values that are changing up to and including the present, while at the same time serving as a means to respond to forms inherited from the past. The historical background of rosaries in the Andes The Isluga rosary is a parallel form to the chaplet often regarded as the ortho- dox form in Western Christianity. However, there are differences between the two forms. Many people today consider the Dominican rosary to be the 'definitive' type. It consists of a circle of beads in five decades, with an attached pendant of five beads. This pendant is thought to derive from the Brigittine rosary, a late sixteenth-century form consisting of six decades in a circle, with a pendant of three extra beads (Thurston 1900: 633). The sixty-three beads were designed to correspond with the sixty-three years that the Virgin is thought to have spent on earth. The present-day Isluga rosary consists of a circle without the pendant, which implies that it was, at some point, inspired by a prototype taken to the Andes earlier in the sixteenth century. It is made up of brightly coloured glass beads interspersed with miniature cups of silver and silver coins. Little cups are used for rites in the libations that are intended 6</page><page sequence="7">PENELOPE DRANSART to serve as a 'blessing' of the products of the earth, including the people and their animals (llamas, alpacas, and sheep). Isluga people have borrowed the Spanish term bendicidn to apply to these libations, and I will return to this theme below. When Christianity was introduced to the Andes in the sixteenth century, Andean people realized that the rosary had a counterpart in the quipu, an already existing Andean form. The quipu was a series of knotted cords used by the Incas and other ethnic groups for keeping administrative and other records. Jose de Acosta and Perez Bocanegra, both Jesuit priests, observed that Andean peoples began to use quipus instead of rosaries for confessing their sins to priests. In 1590, Acosta reported that an Andean woman made a general confession of her life to him, using the knots tied in a quipu to aid her memory (Acosta 1954: 190). In turn, Perez Bocanegra observed in 1631 that female and male native Andean confessors used quipus. They instructed the people before they went to confess their sins to their parish priest. He commented: For these Indians, particularly the Indian women, teach other women to confess by means of these knots and signs, which are multicolored, in order to classify sins and the number that were committed ... in the following way.... [B]efore a penitent Indian man or woman goes to confess to the priest, he [or she] has already confessed every sin to these Indian women and men, whether they be sins he has committed, or others that he never com- mitted, ... and to do this, these male and female confessors tie knots in their cords which are called caitus, and they are the sins which they were told, and they go adding and putting in their knots others which were never committed, ordering [the penitents] and teaching them to confess a sin, when it really is not a sin, and vice versa. And commonly the [elder brothers and sisters] tell them to make an infinite number of false declarations and confess what they never did ... and I have brought this to light by my constant questioning ... until they finally admit:'This is what the brothers and sisters told me to say' ... according to these knots; and they call these general confessions ... and thus they do not confess the sins they have committed, for they do not tell the father confessor about these sins, rather only those which these Indian men and women have shown them [on the knots]; and after confess- ing with the priest, they go and tell these Indians what the father told them and the penance he gave them, making fun of him, saying that he does not know how to interrogate the penitent or that he does not know their language (Silverblatt 1987: 156-7). Irene Silverblatt observes that this subterfuge enabled Quechua people to continue observing a Pre-Hispanic religious practice, in which the 'sins' of the entire community were remembered by individual members and selec- tively revealed to the parish priest. The native confessors were able to control rites that enshrined concepts concerning'sin', guilt, and responsibility that dif- fered greatly from the corresponding Catholic concepts (Silverblatt 1987: 157). One of the uses to which quipus were put in the days of the Inca empire was to record the offerings and worship that the Inca emperors made to every wak'a (oracle, holy place or thing) in all parts of the empire, lest some neglected wak'a should wreak its revenge on the monarch (MacCormack 1991: 201). Virtually no detailed information is available regarding the use Isluga people made of rosaries in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Given that their rosaries do not appear to be associated with confession, penitence, or meditation in the present, eighteenth-century images of the Divine Shepherdess containing allusions to the rosary assume great importance for 7</page><page sequence="8">PENELOPE DRANSART understanding the contemporary appearance of the Isluga rosary and the underlying beliefs that made it an appropriate item of women's dress. Divine Shepherdess imagery in Spain and the Andes In 1703 or 1704, a Capuchin friar, Isidoro of Seville, had a vision of the Virgin dressed as a shepherdess, wearing a fleecy tunic. He reported that she enjoined him to honour her in the form in which she presented herself to him, and she promised to help him in this task (Trens 1946: 343). After his death, a confraternity was established. A need arose for paintings and sculpture that expressed the friar's vision in visual form.6 The imagery became popular in the Andes.7 Painters depicted the Virgin Mary dressed as the Divine Shepherdess, wearing a fleecy tunic seated under the shelter of a tree (Fig. 1). She holds a spray of three red roses in her left hand and a crook rests on her right arm. Her head is surrounded by a radiant halo with twelve stars, while two cherubs hold a crown over her. Some of the sheep have roses in their mouth, and she rests her right hand on the head of one of them. There are also roses strewn on the ground. In the distance on the shore of a lake, St Michael strikes a monster that threatens a white lamb with an 'Ave Maria' speech-scroll emerging from its mouth. This lamb evidently is intended to represent Christ as it is depicted in the form of the Agnus Dei (Lamb of God). The vision experienced by Isidoro of Seville makes it clear that the Virgin he saw was adopting a parallel role to that of her son, Christ, as the Divine Shepherd. There was already an established tradition in Western European art for depicting male and female figures in analogous roles. In an analysis of early Renaissance paintings from Tuscany that depict the Virgin with one bare breast exposed, Margaret Miles has discussed the evident gender parallelism in Chris- tian verbal and visual symbols that artists developed in Europe. She claims that the elaboration of Marian theology resulted in an 'ever more articulated par- allelism' between the scriptural events of the life of Christ and the traditional, unscriptural events of the life of his mother, inspired by scant biblical refer- ences (Miles 1986: 200-1). Miles examined how images of the Virgin's milk- laden breast, as a counterpart to the sustenance offered by Christ in the form of his body and blood, might have been perceived in the light of what is known about the nourishment of infants at a time of chronic famine in Tuscany.8 The later use of the Divine Shepherdess in Spanish and Spanish-Andean art as the counterpart to the Good Shepherd presents a different image of spiritual and physical nourishment, in which the powers of women to con- ceive, nourish, and sustain human life are recast in a fundamentally different fashion from the images of the Virgin's bare breast. According to Miles (1986: 201), the Virgin's one bare breast evoked a mixture of sensual pleasure and spiritual nourishment in the mind of Tuscan viewers. In contrast, the elaborate iconography of the Divine Shepherdess presents the Virgin as protecting Christians, who are represented as sheep. The roses of the rosary give them spiritual nourishment (Carcelen 1992: 469). By the late sixteenth century, an energetic publishing industry based in centres such as 8</page><page sequence="9">PENELOPE DRANSART Antwerp in the Spanish Netherlands gave voice to such concepts of spiritual nourishment. These notions were deeply sensuous but less obviously focused on the human body than was the case with the Virgin's breast. The anony- mous author of a manual known as a method for praying 'the great Rosarie of our blessed Ladie' published in 15989 instructed readers to follow a vocal exercise (the uttering of fifteen paternosters, or Our Fathers, and 150 Aves, or Hail Marys) combined with a mental exercise that involved meditation on the joyous, dolorous, and glorious mysteries.?1 The author of the method explained that the joyous mysteries were represented by 'green flourishing leaues', the dolorous mysteries by 'the sharpe pricking thornes', and the glo- rious mysteries by 'the most sweete and odiferous blossoms of the most delicat Rose' ([Anonymous] 1972). These mysteries corresponded with charity in colour, delicateness in odour, and sweetness in savour. For the author, the flower of the rosary was characterized by its colour, which 'delighteth' the sight, by its odour, which 'recreateth' the smell, and by its savour, which 'com- forteth' the taste. In Europe, the tradition of didactic writing focusing on synaesthetic plea- sures like these dates back to the earliest printed books. In 1495, Gaspar Gorri- cio de Novaria published a work on the rosary in vernacular Spanish for his fellow Carthusian brothers. He used a language that revelled in the senses: 'My contemplation is sweeter than honey' and 'I beg of all of you that with love and devotion we say if we wish to be full of the fragrance and softness of her [the Virgin's] roses' (Gorricio de Novaria 1495: aii, aiiii).11 According to Thurston (1908: 617-19), Gorricio de Novaria was a friend of Christopher Columbus. The rosary and its sublimated synaesthetic bitter-sweet associations would have formed an important part of the Christian experience that Euro- pean men and women took with them to the Americas. The flowering' of the herd animals in Isluga, northern Chile As far as I am aware, Isluga people have not in recent times used their rosaries to keep a record either of sins committed or of collective obligations. Although both Andean men and women wore rosaries around their necks in the seventeenth century,12 contemporary Isluga rosaries belong only to women. In my conversations with them, they show no concern for counting the numbers in the groups of beads. The beads are not arranged in decades, and many rosaries are incomplete, having lost some of the beads, coins, and cups through time (Fig. 3). However, the emphasis that both women and men give to miniature silver cups interspersed between groups of beads indicates the significance which they accord to the concept of bendici6n (blessing). On these Isluga rosaries, the cups indicate the importance of ritual libations in Isluga ritual practice (Fig. 4). The combination of ritual libations (known as ch'alla in Aymara), alcohol, drunkenness, and communication with Andean divinities has been examined by contributors to a book edited by Thierry Saignes (1993).13 Isluga people have a highly developed sense of the importance of being inclusive when making ritual libations to the spirits of the hills (the uywiris). Echoing the concern displayed by the Inca rulers for using the quipu to ensure that no shrine was neglected, Isluga people name specific divini- 9</page><page sequence="10">10 PENELOPE DRANSART FIGURE 3.

They then add the phrase 'uywiris remembered and not remembered' to avoid dishonouring any divinity through neglect.14 However, after sprinkling liba- tions to the Wirjin Tayka (the mother of earth/time, generally known as 'Pachamama' in the Andes) and to the spirits of the hills, the worshipper then drinks most of the alcohol to partake of the nourishment, which is both spiri- tual and physical. This is an aspect of Isluga ritual practice that constitutes a conceptual field parallel to the theme of nourishment expressed in Christian imagery of the Virgin as the Divine Shepherdess. Isluga people who have not become converts of Protestant evangelical denominations that forbid the cults ofAndean divinities and of the saints make libations. They regularly punctuate the long floreo or flowering ceremony with rounds of libations offered to the Pachamama and the spirits of the hills on behalf of the animals, in order to make them 'flower'. Just as human beings require spiritual nourishment (as expressed in the imagery of the Divine Shepherdess), in the Andes animals have to be spiritually revitalized in order to enhance their fertility by making them flower and produce offspring. In Isluga the floreo of the llamas and alpacas is observed by individual families between 1 January and Carnival, a moveable ceremony that begins on the Saturday before the first day of Lent. If a family owns a flock of sheep, their floreo normally takes place immediately after Carnival. I have considered various aspects of the ceremony in detail elsewhere (Dransart 1991; 1997; in press) and will not give a full account of the complex event here. In outline it begins with an all-night session during which people gather in the home of the family celebrating the event; they sing mournful songs while making ritual libations. The next day the animals are herded into a corral and one is selected for sacrifice during which the sequence of libations continues. People continue to sing the songs to the different categories of animals; they cut marks into the ears of animals approaching sexual maturity, and they ritually 'dress' these animals, as well as those marked in the previous year's ceremony, with ear-pieces, neck-pieces, and fleeces tied to their backs. This part of the ceremony may take one or two days. Finally, it ends with the release of the animals to the hillsides and the people return to their house, where they invite members of the community to a communal meal followed by dancing to joyful music. What I wish to do here is to give some attention to the equally complex preparations that precede the ceremony proper. Authors of published ethno- graphic accounts of the floreo elsewhere in the Andes tend not to mention the preparation processes for the ceremony.15 Alcohol, coca leaves, and aniline dyes must be bought, and time allocated for making the material items. These items include the sarsillu (ear-piece), chimpu (dyed fleece for tying to the backs of the animals), and wistalla (neck-piece), with which the animals will be 'dressed'. All the colours of these articles must be strong and clear; any faded colours are rejected as useless. People state explicitly that the ritual investiture of the animals with ear-tassels, neck-pieces, and dyed fleece will not have effect without the singing of certain songs. Mournful sounds are the essential com- plement of the strong colours (red, pink, orange, and the tonal gradations of green, orange, and red) used in the ritual 'clothing'. As a consequence, during the floreo people become emotional and frequently cry for their animals. The 12</page><page sequence="13">PENELOPE DRANSART FIGURE 5. Ceramic jar for fermented maize drink in the form of a woman wearing a rosary. Courtesy of the Museo Regional de Iquique, Chile. Photo: P. Dransart. responsibility for making the items lies with the women of the household, but the men should make the ear-pieces intended for the male animals and also the wistalla. Neighbours may lend a hand with the preparations. Women also make fermented maize beer (chicha) in the privacy of the kitchen. Given the prominent role the liquid will play in the ritual libations that express the concept of bendici6n during the floreo, the process of making it is appropriately couched in ritual, from the grinding of the maize by hand to the preparation of the fermented liquid. On one occasion I was present at the final stages of making chicha (10 February 1987). The grandmother of the household made the sign of the cross over two large pans covered with hand- woven shawls; then, removing the covering, she took an enamel mug of the liquid, which she passed to her daughter. In turn, her daughter went to the doorway and made libations to the Wirjin Tayka. The grandmother next poured chicha into a globular earthenware jar with a narrow neck. A rosary modelled on the front of the jar indicated that it was anthropomorphic in form and that it was intended to represent a woman (Fig. 5). She filled the 13</page><page sequence="14">PENELOPE DRANSART neck of the jar with orange, red, and pink chimpu fleece. Her daughter sprin- kled chicha from her mug and coca leaves over the jar, then all the other adults present (there were six adult women including myself) followed suit. The absence of adult men should be noted in this ritualized preparation of chicha for the floreo. In Isluga, an adult man and woman usually make liba- tions together; a member of the family hosting the ceremony presents a little cup of alcohol to each person. In unison, the couple (who are not necessar- ily husband and wife) sprinkles drops of liquid on the earth, while mention- ing the particular names of the spirits of the hills. The man and the woman then drink the contents of their cup. In contrast, a series of women libate the chicha in the final stages of its preparation. I would like to suggest that this ritual highlights Isluga concepts concerning the powers of women's fertility and of their powers to nourish and sustain human life. These concepts are expressed in the libations to the chicha pot, with its globular, barely anthro- pomorphized form and its clearly depicted Isluga rosary, an article, which all local people know, bears miniature silver cups. In due course, the pot will be carried to the corral for the flowering of the animals; it will be placed with other ritually important items by the misa,6 a large flat stone outside the corral entrance. Women have invested the process of making chicha with a dignity that incorporates elements of Christian practice. The seriousness with which they regard the ritual expression of their religious beliefs should not be under- estimated. One week after I observed the making of the chicha, the teenage member of another family, Marina Castro Mamani, remarked that she had been lucky and her llamas had multiplied precisely because she had ground the maize for the chicha for her family's floreo in the previous year. The emotional impact of the floreo ceremony as it takes place in the corral is compounded by the ritual drunkenness of the participants. This is the one time of the year when women allow themselves to become drunk; during other ritual events they take alcoholic drink but they maintain their sobriety and act as intermediaries between their drunken menfolk who may become aggressive towards each other in such a state. During the floreo, the mother of the household is expected to imbibe an excess of alcohol: 'You have to drink until you fall down', one woman explained to me. Alcohol gives a person courage to call on the fiercest uywiri with enthusiasm, as related to Martinez by an Isluga man who visited a powerful type of uywiri (known as a juturi) alone, under the darkness of night: 'With a little drink you ... have more head ... you call on the juturi with more enthusiasm, Jutur Mallku [male juturi]! ... Jutur T'alla [female juturi]!' (Martinez 1976: 286, my translation). In Isluga, the elaborate floreo ceremony is explicitly said to enhance the pro- creative vitality of the herd animals that a family possesses. The ceremony is a rite of passage for the herd animals, especially for the young ones who are approaching sexual maturity. But in bringing human and animal family members together in close proximity, it casts the relationship between a married couple with their children and their herd animals with their progeny in a clearer light. Human and animal lineages are, in some senses, parallel and, in other senses, mutually interdependent. The focus is on animal fertility during the marking and the dressing of the animals in the corral, but the jux- taposition of human and animal lineages constitutes the cultural matrix in which the events unfold. 14</page><page sequence="15">PENELOPE DRANSART Pre-Hispanic evidence for the floreo The floreo seems, outwardly, to be non-Christian in form and content. There is some archaeological evidence of the ritual investiture, and of piercing and marking of llama and alpaca ears, to suggest that it is Pre-Hispanic in origin. A Candelaria-style modelled and painted vessel from the Department of La Candelaria, northern Argentina, suggests that similar ceremonies were practised in the past. The zoomorphic form represents a pair of copulating camelids, and of interest is the tassel drawn by incised lines hanging from the right ear of the male camelid (Ryden 1936: fig. 117a). However, the ears do not have any notches cut into them.17 Elsewhere in the Andes, there are icono- graphic representations of camelids with pierced ears. Classic Tiwanaku 4 pottery vessels with modelled representations of camelid heads often show a rope encircling the head, passing through the base of one ear. From even earlier times, some Moche ceramics from the north coast of Peru depict mod- elled camelids with patterns of cut-marks round the ears (Donnan 1978). Evidence for ear-piercing in Inca times takes the form of the napa, an elaborately dressed white llama with golden earrings, which preceded the Inca rulers (Sarmiento 1942 [1572]: 40). Oral narratives collected in Quechua from Huarochiri at the end of the sixteenth or the beginning of the seventeenth centuries tell of the decoration of llamas with bells and earrings for the deity Pariacaca (Taylor 1987: 383). From this brief summary of the material culture evidence, it would seem that making the ears of herd animals bleed was, and is, an indigenous ritual practice, a rite of passage for the llamas and alpacas at the time of their ini- tiation into sexual maturity. As such, it would have paralleled the ear-piercing ceremonies and the ritual investiture of the breechcloth for noble Inca boys, which formed part of the Qapaq Raymi celebrations at the time of the winter solstice (Molina 1947 [1574]: 93).This ceremony was known as the warachikuq, but Christian evangelization has eradicated the Andean practice of making boys' ears bleed in such ceremonial rites of passage. There are recorded instances of rites for herd animals dating from the colo- nial period, which the Spanish authorities attempted to eradicate. Kenneth Mills (1997: 65-6) examined documentation about Juan Chapa and his consort Maria Ticlla in the province of Yauyos. According to Juan Chapa's evidence, he was responsible for cutting the tops of the ears of the young llamas, after which he cooked the pieces in a fire, to which he added coca leaves and coloured maize. He offered the mixture to the mountain peak called Pata Caca. Both Maria Ticlla and Juan Chapa maintained this ritual twice a year, despite the punishment meted out to them by the ecclesiastical authorities. It should be noted that Juan Chapa admitted to cutting the ears rather than Maria Ticlla (Mills 1997: 65). A feature of present-day marking ceremonies in the Andes is the gender division in the tasks performed; in Isluga men (usually the father of the family) cut the ears of the llamas and alpacas, while women use a needle to pierce and stitch the ear-pieces in place. In Qaqachaka, Bolivia, it is likewise the father of the household who usually cuts the marks in the ears of the sheep, but Arnold and Yapita (1998: 128-9, 132) stress that he is directed in the task by his wife and young daughter, who herds the flock, while the women are responsible for the flowers attached to the animals' ears. 15</page><page sequence="16">PENELOPE DRANSART 'Heart make me flower': Aymara notions of flowering Isluga people call llamas and alpacas 'flowers' in ritual language during the floreo or flowering ceremony; they are the p'aqalli of their herders. Elsewhere in the Andes, the ear decorations are called tika, which means 'flower' in Quechua (Tomoeda 1985: 290). The complexity of the ceremony is such that it appears to be of native origin, yet it also contains evident similarities with the imagery of the Divine Shepherdess. In Aymara, the verb p'anchayana can be used both for the opening of a bud and the opening of the heart, in the sense of being inspired to create some- thing. Denise Arnold (1997: 108) observes that in Qaqachaka, women say 'heart, make me flower' (chuyma p'aqartatistanta) when they seek inspiration in their weaving. The notion of flowering is laden with resonances in Aymara culture having to do with both memory and inspiration. There is a gendered aspect to this notion of flowering because women, in particular, act as sources of memory and inspiration, as well as having the capacity to generate lineages. This observation also applies to female animals, in particular the llamas and alpacas herded in Isluga. In European languages the term 'flower' is also used in a range of contexts. Dictionary variants in English include 'the best of anything', 'the prime of life', or 'the person or thing most distinguished'. In Spanish, the range of meanings is even greater, including'bloom, prime, the most excellent or valu- able part of a thing' as well as 'flowers or beauties of polite literature, flowers or figures of rhetoric'. There is also an idea conveyed by the Spanish notion of flowering of a sense of fulfilment that is not unlike some of the Aymara resonances. Qaqachaka women sing from the heart (Arnold &amp; Yapita 1998: 118). However, Cecilia Klein discusses the ways in which apparently similar visual signs produced by very different cultures can distract us from under- standing how 'representation operates in a colonizing context'. Her concern was to demonstrate how apparently similar visual codes produced by Aztecs and Europeans conveyed a related, 'yet always slightly different, social and moral message' (1995: 263). Arnold (1994: 196) has stressed the importance of women's libations for understanding Andean cosmogonies and cosmologies. Aymara women are thought to have the capacity to 'irrigate the earth' when drinking alcohol and, like the Pachamama, whose mouth is the earth, women must dampen them- selves to be fertile (Arnold &amp; Yapita 1992: 117-18). In Isluga the roses of the rosary are accompanied by a ritual irrigation that enables the flowering to occur in the bodies of the women. The wearing of the rosary and the ritual libations of alcohol are human activities, while the waynu ceremony is a parallel ritual for animals, and it is meant to enhance the flowering of the llamas and alpacas. The flowering opens both buds of blossoms and the hearts of living creatures. The implicated relations I have been discussing are not only between Aymara culture and European culture, but also between the culture of human beings and herd animals. However, the latter in Isluga cannot 'stand for' the former (as sheep do for human beings in the Divine Shepherdess imagery), given the parallel character of human and animal lineages. In Isluga it is only members of the Pentecostal sect who are learning to understand the sacrifice 16</page><page sequence="17">PENELOPE DRANSART of herd animals in terms of the sacrifice of Christ. They compare animal blood with the blood of Christ when a herd animal is sacrificed for human con- sumption (Dransart in press: chap. 9). This is an analogy that Catholics and agnostics in Isluga do not make.18 Following Klein (1995: 263), I would like to suggest that the apparently similar semiotic signs in the rosary imagery produced by Aymara and European peoples distract from the different social and moral messages con- veyed by the outwardly converging visual codes. The Spanish attempted to extirpate the ritual (drunken) behaviour of Andean people (their means of communicating with divinities), but Isluga people introduced miniature drink- ing-cups as an essential component in that most Christian of objects - the rosary. Skar argued (1993: 230) that the monotheism of Christianity was at odds with the principle of duality that characterizes the cosmos of the Quechua speakers of Matapuquio in highland Peru, so that recent efforts by Christian missionaries have resulted in a conspicuous failure to persuade Matapuquio people to adopt an orthodox Catholicism. She sees Catholic beliefs in a male- gendered divinity and an emphasis on celibacy in the priesthood as deriving from a perceived opposition between men and women that contrasts greatly with Quechua belief in the 'essential incompleteness as separate values' of men and women (1993: 247). Isluga men's and women's roles in cutting and pierc- ing, respectively, the ears of their camelids would seem to fit in with Andean values concerning 'duality'. My analysis of Catholic imagery of the Divine Shepherdess additionally indicates that Aymara culture esteems herd animals in a different manner from Christian values, and that the principle of duality ought to be extended to the incompleteness as separate values of human beings and their herd animals. Olivia Harris has suggested that Aymara-speakers have been able to juxta- pose what they perceive as local and exogenous sources of religious knowl- edge based on different principles, and in so doing they have been 'able to sidestep the issue of the exclusive nature of Christianity' (1995: 115). Chris- tians in both the Andes and Europe recognize that their religious beliefs require spiritual nourishment, which has been expressed in strongly gendered images concerning physical nourishment, blossoming, and lactation. These images have been recast through time. However, Isluga people maintain that both human and herd animals require spiritual nourishment. In contrast, Euro- peans acknowledge the need for human beings to obtain spiritual nourish- ment, but they do not expect non-human animals to require it. NOTES I wish to thank the people of Isluga for their hospitality and for making this work pos- sible. The following bodies provided with me with financial support for the fieldwork, for which I am very grateful: Pirie-Reid Scholarship Fund (University of Oxford), Emslie Horniman Anthropological Scholarship Fund, British Council (Santiago), and the Pantyfedwen Fund (Uni- versity of Wales, Lampeter). I also wish to acknowledge the receipt of AHRB-funded research leave in 1999-2000. An earlier version of the paper was given to a seminar in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Wales, Lampeter. I wish to thank those present, as well as James G. Carrier and two anonymous Journal readers, for their helpful comments. 17</page><page sequence="18">PENELOPE DRANSART 'For a basic bibliography, see Esser (1897), Thurston (1900; 1901), Wilkins (1969), Heinz (1977), Vail (1995), and Winston-Allen (1997). 2Given the themes concerned with herding discussed in this article, I use the conventional phrase 'the fold of Christianity' in a self-conscious fashion. 'I have conducted fieldwork in Isluga in 1986, 1987-8, 1989, 1995, 1996, and 1997. My 1998 article was initially drafted for the 1995 workshop entitled 'Beads and bead-makers: gender, material culture and meaning' organized by Lidia Sciama at the Centre for Cross Cul- tural Research on Women at Queen Elizabeth House, Oxford. I wish to thank Dr Sciama for inviting me to participate in the workshop. 4Raffaele Moro R. (1994) has discussed the publication of eighteenth-century engravings of Christian saints by the publisher Remondini, in the Venetian republic, destined for an Andean market. He cites the well-known example of Fray Diego de Ocaiia who wished to use engrav- ings of the Virgin of Guadalupe to 'move' the spirits of the faithful into supporting the cult he established in Potosi (Ocana 1969: 177). Remondini prints reached extremely remote parts of the world, and some of their religious images in particular were at the cheapest end of the range (Boschloo 1998: 220-1; Remondini 1990: 65-6, 99). ' For a discussion of the depiction of the Three Persons of the Trinity in Andean art of the colonial period, see Gisbert (1980: 30-1, 88-90). &lt;'For an example by the Spanish sculptor Luis Salvador Carmona, see Hernandez Redondo (1998: 371). 7Painted versions of the Divine Shepherdess in Latin American collections include the Museo Nacional de Arqueologia, Antropologia e Historia del Peru, Lima, the Banco de Credito, Lima, and the Museo de Arte, La Paz. 'Another example of iconographic gender parallelism is provided by the penitence of Sts Peter and Mary Magdalene, respectively. Of course the visual treatment of such parallelism had different impacts on male and female viewers that was grounded in women's inequality with men in western European countries. Warner's study (1983) demonstrates that the exaltation of the Virgin resulted in the Mother of Jesus being assigned a superhuman status beyond the expectations of what was accepted for women. 9This was originally published in Antwerp. It has been reprinted alongside a tract by Baillie ([Anonymous] 1972). 1"These are now referred to as the Joyful, Sorrowful, and Glorious Mysteries. " The translations from the Spanish are my own. 2 Illustrations that accompany an early seventeenth-century manuscript by Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala show many instances of men and women wearing a rosary around the neck (Guaman Poma 1980: 18, 689, 717, 771, 767, 769, 835, 900). 13The title of the book translates as Drunkenness and memory: the experience of the sacred in the Andes. 4 In Aymara, people whisper or say 'Uywir mallku amtata jan amtata, Uywir t'alla amtata jan amtata [Male Uywiris remembered and not remembered, Female Uywiris remembered and not remembered]', when making libations (Dransart 1997: 94-5). See also Martinez (1976: 324-5). 15For a detailed list of published accounts of the floreo in the Andes, see Dransart (in press: chap. 4). "'Misa is an Aymara term borrowed from the Spanish mesa,'table'. In practice, Isluga people have scarcely used Western furniture in their homes. They do, however, use ritual 'tables' in various contexts in order to lay out certain items on a hand-woven cloth. It is interesting to note that the misa in the Andes is clearly associated with the theme of spiritual nourishment, and that in seventeenth-century European church Latin, the mensa mystica referred to the sacra- ment of the Lord's Supper. 17The vessel might have been used in a mating ceremony, comparable with ritual cross- ings of herd animals practised today in some parts of the Andes (Arnold &amp; Yapita 1998: chap. 8). 18In terms of Pentecostal vocabulary, 'salvation' is expressed through the sacrifice of Christ for the benefit of believers in the cult (Van Kessel &amp; Guerrero 1987). Sallnow (1987: 135-6) argued that during livestock ceremonies in highland Peru animal and human societies were merged into 'a single congregation' whose destiny was 'controlled by the spirits of nature'. He attempted to take the argument further by arguing that this united congregation offered one of the animal members as a sacrificial victim to substitute for a human one. However he could 18</page><page sequence="19">PENELOPE DRANSART not support this further hypothesis through his own fieldwork, and he used two published sources (Favre 1967; Nachtigall 1975) that were already dated at the time of his publication. The findings from my fieldwork in northern Chile do not support such a view - it is only Pentecostalists who regard animals as possible stand-ins to expiate human failings.

Concepts de nourriture spirituelle dans les Andes et en Europe: les rosaires dans des contextes interculturels Resume Cet article etudie en detail les images visuelles associ&amp;es avec le rosaire chretien et leurs con- notations de nourriture spirituelle dans l'art europeen et dans les pratiques rituelles andines. Au debut du dix-huitieme siecle, l'art religieux inspire par une vision recue par Isidoro de Seville, un moine capucin, representa la Vierge Marie comme Divine Bergere avec son trou- peau de chretiens depeints comme des moutons avec des roses a la bouche. Ces images ont des resonances avec la c6ermonie des fleurs pratiquee par les pastoralistes Aymaras d'Isluga au Chili. Le floreo sert de rite de passage pour les animaux du troupeau en vue d'accroitre leur fertilite en les faisant 'fleurir'. Cependant la congruence entre les codes visuels produits par les Europeens et les Andins communique des messages sociaux et moraux qui sont dif- ferents bien qu'apparent&amp;s. Tandis que les moutons peuvent repr6senter des etres humains dans l'art chretien, ils ne peuvent pas prendre la signification d'etres humains a Isluga, car dans la pensee des gens d'Isluga, tant les humains que les animaux de troupeau ont besoin de nourriture spirituelle.
