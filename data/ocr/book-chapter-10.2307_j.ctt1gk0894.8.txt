A miniscule simulacrum of nucleo-l iterary waste. . . .  “Things” don’t “biodegrade” as one might wish or believe. — Jacques Derrida3 PlastiCity, toxiCity, and temPoRality In 2008, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power hit upon a solu- tion to an unforeseen problem in the Ivanhoe Reservoir, which provides  drinking water to the southern portion of the city. The problem was the  presence in the water of the carcinogen bromate, formed when, in the open-  to- the- sky pool, the bromide (which appears naturally) and chlorine (used  in treatment) interact with sunlight. Cost- benefit analyses suggested that to  cover the pool, with cloth or metal, would likely be too expensive and inef- ficient. And officials reassured residents that “dangers were minimal be- cause bromate poses a small cancer risk only after consumed daily over a  123 </page> <page sequence="2"> Revised Pages 124 Risk CRitiCism lifetime.”4 Nevertheless, the existence of a known carcinogen in the city’s  water supply was a cause for concern, and so a year after elevated levels  were detected in the water, a remedy was found: To shield the water and  prevent the volatilization of the bromide, engineers decided to float 6.5 mil- lion black plastic balls on top. The mood at the event, at least as the Los  Angeles Times reported it, was ebullient: “Pebble- heavy ‘plops’ permeated  the laughter of smiling onlookers. City Councilman Tom LaBonge shouted,  ‘For quality of water for all of Los Angeles!’ with each of three balls he  chucked into the water”; “‘Water quality doesn’t get more exciting than  this,’ Marina J. F. Busatto, a DWP [Department of Water and Power] biolo- gist, said with a smile to a colleague as she helped slide ball- filled bags to  the reservoir’s edge.” The only reported dissenter was a local resident,  Marilyn Oliver, who offered a rather ominous “It looks like an oil spill,”  but “quickly added,” “it’s OK because it’s temporary and the water quality  is more important than the looks.” Of course, one cannot help but wonder whether those magic plastic  balls, even while successfully shielding the water and preventing the pro- duction of one carcinogen, might themselves interact with water and sun.  Surely anyone who has purchased a plastic bottle or baby toy in the last  few years has had a crash course in plastics chemistry and endocrinology,  as phthalates and bisphenol- A have moved out of the lab and into public  parlance. Can we really believe that the new BPA- free plastics will be the  end of this?5 Aren’t we justified in suspecting that these too might have  some other hidden danger? (Plastic has turned out to be something like  Chris Columbus’s gremlins from the 1984 film, cute and lovable until you  get it wet, let it stay up past midnight, expose it to sunlight, acidic liquids,  or microwave ovens.) As though anticipating this response, the Los Angeles  Times reports that the balls are “environmentally safe for drinking water  and approved by NSF International, a government- sanctioned, nonprofit  water quality organization.” But in an age in which toxicity seems to change  as one crosses borders (witness debates over the safety of BPA exposure,  for instance), is “government- sanctioned” still a reassuring adjective? Judging from the responses to the balls in the reservoir, the answer to  this question is no. In a letter issued June 25, 2008, Marty Adams, director  of water quality and operations for the Los Angeles Department of Water  and Power, attempted to reassure those who expressed concerns about the  safety of the plastic: Perhaps the greatest misinformation I have recently seen is the notion  that the bird balls heat up and release toxic chemicals into the water.  </page> <page sequence="3"> Revised Pages letting PlastiC have its say 125 This is just simply not true. Granted, there are many different types  of plastics and recent news has focused on certain plastics leaching  chemicals. . . . The balls are made of High Density Polyethylene— a  long- time water industry product also used for pipelines, and a black  version of the same clear product you buy your one gallon container  of milk in (look on the bottom for the HDPE label). You will not find  any legitimate news findings claiming that HDPE leaches chemicals  into drinking water. . . . The balls are made to survive in a hot, sun- light environment without breaking down, and they are warranted  for 10 years— twice the lifetime we are looking for.6 Of course, fear of contamination in and of itself can produce potent results,  even in the absence of any revelation of actual harm. Adams’s invocation of  the wholesome and homey “container of milk” is doubtless targeted to dis- pel such fears. But Adams’s concession that other plastics (“certain plas- tics”) have been found to leach chemicals raises the possibility that high-  density polyethylene (HDPE), that safe plastic, used so pervasively to  contain such staples of life as water and milk, will not have been as inert as  we presently believe it to be. Reassurances about the safety of HDPE are  perhaps less comforting given what has happened to PET bottles in recent  years. If, as a report from the Pacific Northwest Pollution Prevention Re- source Center suggests, a “common plastic memory device” is “One, four,  five and two, / all of these are good for you,” recent research suggests that  at least number 1 (PET) is not so “good for you” as it was once thought to  be.7 Though it contains no presently known endocrine disruptors, PET was  found to leach “small amounts of one or more unknown compounds that  mimic estrogen.”8 As Beck points out, in risk society, “What was judged  ‘safe’ to swallow today, may be a ‘cancer risk’ in two years’ time.”9 But even if the bird balls in the Ivanhoe reservoir do not leach unsafe  chemicals or pollutants— or at least, in the cost- benefit analysis that weighs  such risks against the risks of bromate and the costs of a different covering  material, not enough to warrant a more expensive solution—t here is still  the question of the stubborn and persistent presence of the balls them- selves. When local resident Marilyn Oliver suggested that the first several  thousand of 6.5 million plastic balls “looks like an oil spill,” she was per- haps noting something more than aesthetic, given that most plastic has its  origins in petroleum. And another onlooker, less sympathetic, might have  pointed out the resemblance of the reservoir to that other, larger, reservoir,  the Pacific Ocean, in which floating plastic presently makes up most of  what is known as “the Pacific Garbage Patch,” an area alarmingly described  </page> <page sequence="4"> Revised Pages 126 Risk CRitiCism as the size, or sometimes (twice as alarmingly) twice the size, of the state of  Texas.10 This, we might hazard, could indeed be the ultimate locus for the  Ivanhoe reservoir’s black plastic balls, the use of which, as Oliver reassures  herself, is “temporary.” Though HDPE is one of the more recyclable plas- tics, and though Pankaj Parekh, director for water quality compliance for  the DWP, in another attempt to placate citizen fears, informed a reporter  for the Times that the balls would all be recycled,11 it is not hard to imagine  a few (hundred? thousand?) of these 6.5 million balls escaping that fate,  either in ball form, or in an interim state like a plastic pellet, or in a new,  recycled state, as plastic building material, toy, or flowerpot, likely the final  stage in what is not as infinitely recyclable and “plastic” a substance as one  might wish. If risk criticism is necessarily concerned with the question of the  archive— whether that is the archive of risk or the archive of hedges against  risk, the critical piles or the doomsday seed vaults— integral to its own ar- chival project is the chronicle of what was not meant to be archived, those  unintended consequences of first modernity. In this project, perhaps no  substance is as instructive as waste, excluded from the archive but, particu- larly in the case of plastic, building up as a material archive on the planet,  and one that is, increasingly, haunting our cultural production as much as  it is our ecological condition. When, exploring the possibilities of a cultural  form of biodegradability, Derrida went looking for vehicles for its oppo- site, nonbiodegradability, it is no coincidence that he chose nuclear waste  and plastics, both substances that seem, almost maliciously, to resist the  test of time. Derrida imagines the future fate of his essay on the legacies of  Paul de Man as akin to “one of those plastic packages,” a “simulacrum of  nucleo- literary waste,” the eventual duration and consequences of which  he can neither predict nor control.12 Here, of course, plastic and radiation  are the metaphorical vehicles for the tenor of the text, which is the question  of the durability of the archive of Paul de Man’s wartime journalism, not  environmental concerns in their own right. But the metaphor could also be  upcycled for more literal concerns. In “Responsibility, Biodegradability,”  for example, Tze- Yin Teo repurposes Derrida’s “Biodegradables” for an  ecological context by reading the figure of the biodegradable literally. Not- ing that, for Derrida, what is incalculable is the biodegradability of a docu- ment, Teo counters that, for literal wastes, “what cannot be mastered in the  current environmental crisis is certainly not the eventual biodegradability  of certain waste substances in time— the calculation for which is increas- ingly reliable as relevant technology progresses,” but rather “the question  of an incalculable limitation of space.”13 Though Teo does not specify which of  </page> <page sequence="5"> Revised Pages letting PlastiC have its say 127 the “certain” waste substances she might mean, plastic would seem to fit  nicely into this equation, as, refusing to biodegrade, it gradually usurps the  space for others, human or nonhuman, who might be to come. If plastic has, up to now, largely evaded what Derrida playfully calls  “hermeneutic microorganisms,” its material evasion of biological microor- ganisms has forced us to confront it, both as substance and text.14 Plastic is,  as Peter van Wyck has suggested of nuclear waste, not so much “matter out  of place” (Mary Douglas’s much-c ited definition of pollution), but “matter  without a place”15— both having duration that exceeds human imagination,  and, as we are beginning to learn, forms of toxicity that are novel, difficult  to contain or control. If the geologist of the Anthropocene might dig into the  earth to discover the strata of this era, in between the layers that Timothy  Morton has recently imagined— “1784, soot, 1945, Hiroshima, Nagasaki,  plutonium”16— we might wedge “1907, creation of Bakelite,” the “first fully  synthetic polymer, made entirely of molecules that couldn’t be found in  nature.”17 Given that plastics do not biodegrade, all of the plastic produced  is, conceivably, still with us— and the ever- growing, never- diminishing  mass of it contributes to the sense of horror that plastic waste represents. Unlike nuclear waste, which might appear in the form of contaminated  clothing or laboratory equipment (“decks you can’t stay on for more than a  few minutes but which seem like other decks”), plastic is, of course, visible,  but at the same time, surprisingly difficult to represent. Though “Texas”  has been the metric in the popular press for representing the reach of the  Garbage Patch, the question of whether it is one Texas or two is symptom- atic of the fact that, as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra- tion (NOAA) points out on its website, there is no scientifically accepted  way to determine its size or shape, given that it is made up of microplastic  particles suspended in the water column.18 In this sense the “Patch” is  something like the “nebulous mass” that Don DeLillo’s Jack Gladney is  informed might be a result of his exposure to Nyodene D. When Jack asks  the doctor whether it is called “nebulous” because “you can’t get a clear  picture of it,” he is corrected: “We get very clear pictures. The imaging  block takes the clearest pictures humanly possible. It’s called a nebulous  mass because it has no definite shape, form or limits.”19 This problem of imaging— the sense that the Garbage Patch clearly ex- ists, but, like the “mass” is “nebulous,” with no “definite shape, form or  limits”— is in fact true of the plastics problem more generally. As Jody Rob- erts suggests: “The spread of plastic has been more subtle, and it is perhaps  for that reason that experts of all stripes missed it slipping into unintended  places, travelling near and far such that nearly every cup of water from the  </page> <page sequence="6"> Revised Pages 128 Risk CRitiCism ocean is likely to contain some plastic in some form of degradation and  nearly every human subject found anywhere on the globe will likely bear  the marks of a plastic modernity.”20 Indeed, Max Liboiron has suggested  reviving the term “miasma” to describe the “additive and somewhat mys- terious” health implications of plasticizers, those substances that render  plastics more flexible or pliable.21 In an irony that Ulrich Beck would surely  appreciate, the “wonders” of first modernity— miracle plastics, with their  additives and colorants, taking on infinite shapes, textures, and degrees of  fire resistance— generate uncertain, mysterious, and illusive forces, com- prehensible only by recourse to an earlier vocabulary and understanding  of harm. And whatever sorts of plasticizing chemicals those banal objects  may have had in the hand of the consumer, in the ocean, they gather more,  becoming “sponges” for other pollutants like DDT, PCBs, fire retardants,  BPA, yielding “tiny time bombs” for oceanic life.22 Plastic thus offers a challenge for representation with which artists,  writers, and culture workers have recently been grappling, producing cul- tural artifacts that even scientific agencies have taken to employing in pre- senting plastic. Accompanying NOAA’s “Science versus Myth” web page  on the Pacific Garbage Patch is, not only a large rendering of the Pacific,  with at least three “garbage patches” mapped, but also an image taken  from graphic artist and photographer Chris Jordan’s Midway series, which  consists of photographs of dead, decaying birds, the very sign of the biode- gradable, the stomachs of which are packed with the stubbornly nonbiode- gradable plastic pieces they have picked up from the ocean and its envi- rons. As Stacy Alaimo suggests of this series, it is the very juxtaposition of  plastic’s “eerily cheery”23 color and the death that it has most certainly  caused— and will go on causing, now that it is exposed for other wildlife to  consume—t hat renders the scene so troubling: “Everyday, ostensibly be- nign, human stuff becomes nightmarish as it floats forever in the sea. The  recognition that these banal objects, intended for momentary human use,  pollute for eternity renders them surreally malevolent.”24 “Cheery” and  “malevolent,” the plastic seems to taunt us; Jordan’s photographs capture,  in an image, the juxtaposition of finitude, the very cycles of ecological,  planetary life, and the virtually immortal plastic, products intended, in  many cases, for a single “banal” use, the juxtaposition of muted, natural  tones of decay and the grotesquely animated colors of persistence. And  though “cheery” and “malevolent” are intended, perhaps, to be a descrip- tion of the plastic’s appearance, they also seem— and this may be the “sur- real” part— to slide into describing the plastic’s very nature, its essence, if  not its personality or feelings. </page> <page sequence="7"> Revised Pages letting PlastiC have its say 129 Of course to say that plastic is “cheery” or “malevolent” is to anthropo- morphize, to attribute human emotions to nonhuman things, and attention  to cultural production surrounding plastic suggests that anthropomor- phism and related figures of personification and prosopopoeia have risen  to something of a tropological wager for those interested in representing  plastic waste in a risk archive. Appearing in children’s literature and Dis- ney productions— Peter Rabbit, Mickey Mouse, Thomas the Tank Engine—  anthropomorphism has been denigrated, at least traditionally, in literary  and scientific circles alike, generally relegated to the category of mistake,  not elevated to the category of trope. Paul de Man argues, for example, that  anthropomorphism is “an identification on the level of substance” that  “implies the constitution of specific entities prior to their confusion.”25  Here, the focus on “substance” is what makes this a “confusion” rather  than a “figuration,” for anthropomorphism seems to make an assertion  about the essence of a thing, a process that, de Man argues, “freezes the  infinite chain of tropological transformations,” which, given the premium  on such transformations in de Man’s work, is clearly a problem.26 In the  sciences, of course, “substances” are hardly a problem, but anthropomor- phism’s “confusion” remains troubling, as it projects the emotional, intel- lectual, or interpersonal qualities of one substance (“the human”) onto an- other, in the process failing to account for the actual substances under  consideration. But in recent work in what critics have taken to calling “new material- isms,” this negative valance of anthropomorphism appears to be changing,  particularly as those who might, formerly, have avoided substances turn to  them. Jane Bennett, for example, has suggested that “we need to cultivate a  bit of anthropomorphism—t he idea that human agency has some echoes in  nonhuman nature— to counter the narcissism of humans in charge of the  world.”27 Reading nonhuman things as having human qualities is, for Ben- nett, less itself a matter of confusion than it is a symptom of it. She takes the  example of a power grid: “To say that the grid’s ‘heart fluttered’ or that it  ‘lives and dies by its own rules’ is to anthropomorphize. But anthropomor- phizing has . . . its virtues. Here it works to gesture toward the inadequacy  of understanding the grid simply as a machine or a tool.”28 Given the un- predictability and uncontrollability of objects—a  power grid or a plastic  pellet— attributing human traits offers a way to grapple with the limits of  understanding, suggesting an approach that we might, in the spirit of an  earlier critical ambivalence, call a “strategic anthropomorphism,” one that  recognizes the pragmatic usefulness of anthropomorphism, even as it is  cognizant of its limitations.29 </page> <page sequence="8"> Revised Pages 130 Risk CRitiCism In this chapter, I track the tropological wagers associated with animat- ing plastic (whether in anthropomorphism or other, related figures—  personification, prosopopoeia),30 strategies of representation mobilized by  activists, artists, and writers alike to capture and complicate the problem of  plastics, navigating the intimate relationships that all life on the planet now  has with the synthetic material that at once seems to mold itself into the  shape of our dreams and desires and to persist as a nightmarish reminder  of a past that refuses to remain past and a future that defies prediction.  Anthropomorphizing plastic emphasizes the degree to which it is human,  our creation and our responsibility, even as the strategy also complicates  any simple demonizing of this substance that has become such a vital help- meet to humankind. And if approaches to plastics generally seem to imply  that human beings ought to address the problem— by banning bags in gro- cery stores or microbeads in facial scrubbers, recycling packaging or reser- voir balls— these texts emphasize the enormity and ubiquity of a problem  that we cannot not address by imagining the plastic as addressing us. Plas- tic thus becomes, not something to be turned to, but something that hails  us, constituting us as subjects of risk society, just as much as we may be  producers or consumers of plastic things. PlastiC matteRs In endorsing anthropomorphism, then, I join Jane Bennett and other advo- cates of the “new materialisms,” critical practices that emphasize the agen- tial capacity of nonhuman things, whether organic or synthetic, born or  made. My additional modifier of “strategic,” though, is intended to fore- stall a potential pitfall in some of this work. As amenable as I find the turns  to “objects,” “things,” or “matter” in contemporary cultural and literary  theory, as much as I view them to be a necessary and useful supplement to  ecocriticism and ecocultural studies, I also find in them a tendency to level  any distinction one might wish to make between different kinds of things,  a tendency that can complicate an environmental ethics or politics that re- lies, often, on such delineation. This leveling is particularly symptomatic in  the rhetorical technique of listing, which is common in this kind of work,  whether in Timothy Morton’s “wind harps, egg cups, cathedrals, underwa- ter gas pipelines, poems, neutron stars, PDFs, and grains of salt,”31 or Se- renella Iovino’s “stories, bodies, landscapes, bacteria, electric grids, quan- tum entanglements, waste dumps, animal testing, cyborgs, cheese, nuclear  sites, oceanic plastic, art, time, nature,”32 or Serpil Oppermann’s “water,  </page> <page sequence="9"> Revised Pages letting PlastiC have its say 131 soil, stones, metals, minerals, bacteria, toxins, electricity, cells, molecules  and atoms, and a vast array of nature’s constituents as well as culture’s  trash and garbage.”33 Such interventions are directed at undermining what  is perceived to be an artificial and problematic binary between nature and  culture, a binary that critics perceive ecocriticism as endorsing. Patricia  Yaeger has suggested, for instance, that ecocriticism is “so contaminated  with nature as perfection or with a quest for organic truth that operating in  its name is hard.”34 Given the direction of recent work in ecocriticism, I find  Yaeger’s fears about operating in its name to be a bit misplaced. Certainly  those of us influenced by Donna Haraway, Bruno Latour, and Ulrich Beck  are already working in the interstices between those problematic binary  terms. But the effect of the rhetorical move of listing is often to blur that  admittedly problematic nature/culture binary by implying sameness (all  items in the lists have “agentic capacity,” as Oppermann reminds us). Of course, the fact that all matter is “lively” need not mean that all of its  actions are the same— or that all matter and its actions should be valued in  positive terms. It is precisely because all things have agency that one ought  to distinguish among them. Cheese and nuclear sites, oceanic plastic and  bacteria— these may be lively, but they differ in their life- supporting or  biopolitical implications. And in making these sorts of distinctions among  lively things, some recourse to— again, strategic— language of nature or the  organic may be necessary. At the end of Vibrant Matter, Jane Bennett specu- lates on some of the ethico- political pitfalls of her own endorsement of a  lively materialism, noting that, whatever its epistemological or theoretical  problems, “the ideal of nature as the Wild continues to motivate some peo- ple to live more ecologically sustainable lives.” And she notes that, even  she herself, a convert to Latourian hybridity, is troubled by the normative  principles that might (or might not) accompany the shift her book advo- cates: “One thing I have noticed is that as I shift from environmentalism to  vital materialism, from a world of nature versus culture to a heterogeneous  monism of vibrant bodies, I find the ground beneath my old ethical maxim,  ‘tread lightly on the earth,’ to be less solid.”35 This is, in her estimation, a  risk worth running, but it also might remind us that, in the case of plastic—  that paradigmatically artificial substance— recourse to the natural or artifi- cial has had tremendous pragmatic political effect. Though one can and should certainly think plastic materiality differ- ently— in terms less of nature/culture than of carcinogenesis or wildlife  poisoning— a too hasty leveling of distinctions among different forms of  “liveliness”— what promotes life and what denies it— risks ethico- political  neutrality. When plastic is anthropomorphized by activists, it is generally,  </page> <page sequence="10"> Revised Pages 132 Risk CRitiCism as in Alaimo’s rendering, “malevolent”—e ven in its “cheeriness.” As some  critics have pointed out, though, a too categorical rejection of plastic denies  the ubiquity and usefulness of this substance, a point Gay Hawkins makes  in her analysis of “say no” campaigns against plastic grocery bags: “Cata- strophic images of plastic bags as pollutants link them to the end of nature  and fuel a sense of disgust and horror. There is no possibility that plastic  bags might move us or enchant us.”36 As her phrasing suggests, Hawkins  is interested in experimenting with the latter figuration. Thus, though “in a  world represented as drowning in plastic bags, a concern with how plastic  materiality is performed in various associations seems both indulgent and  grotesque,” she elects to let “plastic bags have their say.”37 Analyzing plas- tic bags, first as the target of bans, but then as useful in storing a wet bath- ing suit and aesthetically beautiful in the famous “plastic bag” sequence  from the film American Beauty (1999), Hawkins animates different sides of  the plastic bag’s materiality and the multiple ways in which the bag inter- acts with human beings. In the process, Hawkins usefully reminds the en- vironmentally conscious consumer of the ways in which we are complicit  with plastic, much as we might wish to demonize this substance. Plastic  bags are hardly exonerated in her essay, but they become, through use and  aesthetic pleasure, something slightly more sympathetic and complex. Ex- perimenting with a transformation in environmentalist affect, Hawkins  asks, in her book- length investigation of waste, “Could it possibly be more  ‘environmentally friendly’ to feel sympathy and ethical concern for rub- bish rather than disgust and anxiety about its destructive impacts on na- ture?”38 But what “environmentally friendly” would mean, in this context,  is vague. Certainly, in her discussion of the plastic bag sequence in Ameri- can Beauty, one gets the sense of the aesthetic possibilities of plastic waste,  but what sort of environmental response ought to follow from that recogni- tion is unclear. To see how the twin moves of strategic anthropomorphism and strate- gic reinforcement of the nature/culture binary might work, I turn to an- other wind- tossed bag, the one tracked in Heal the Bay’s “mockumentary”  The Majestic Plastic Bag (2010).39 This short film, released as part of the cam- paign to ban plastic bags in California, offers, not an anthropomorphism  per se, but rather something of a beast- morphism, as the bag is treated as  some sort of organic or natural object, a member of some elusive species.  The film has the feel of a nature documentary, as the voiceover, in David  Attenborough– style British accent provided by actor Jeremy Irons, narrates  the bag’s “migration” from its “release into the wild” on the “open plains  of the asphalt jungle” to “its home, the Pacific Ocean.” The bag is not pre- </page> <page sequence="11"> Revised Pages letting PlastiC have its say 133 3. From The Majestic Plastic Bag. (Courtesy of Heal the Bay. www.heal  thebay.org.) sented as malevolent—t his is not the strangling plastic bag that maliciously  kills ocean life (though later scenes suggest it may do this accidentally)—  but as itself at risk: even in a city park, which “at first seems an idyllic place  for the plastic bag,” “danger lurks ’round every corner,” as the bag is  threatened by parks’ employees and, “one of nature’s most deadly killers,”  the teacup Yorkie.40 Thus the film illustrates the ways in which an inani- mate object like the plastic bag has material effects that might appear moti- vated, even if not the product of some sort of cognition. Plastic matter is, in  other words, “lively,” to borrow Bennett’s adjective, even if it is not alive. This playful confusion of nature and culture, animal and trash, is cer- tainly emblematic of what Patricia Yaeger reminds us is a “world where  molecular garbage has infiltrated earth, water, and air,” in which “we can- not encounter the natural untouched or uncontaminated by human re- mains.” But while Yaeger concludes, “Trash becomes nature, and nature  becomes trash,” the film’s ironic tone suggests something else.41 Its humor  clearly derives from the beast- morphizing of the bag, but there is no actual  confusion of substance, no sense that the bag is “really” migrating. Lest the  viewer not perceive the dissonance in “naturalizing” plastic, the final frame  informs us, “Plastic bags are not indigenous to the Pacific.” In The Majestic  Plastic Bag, then, the overt strategy— the one that supplies the humor— is in  the confusion of nature and culture, pretending that the bag is on some sort  of epic migration, but this strategy only works by reinforcing the opposite:  </page> <page sequence="12"> Revised Pages 134 Risk CRitiCism the bag is not natural, is not alive, is not organic; it is, in fact, very out of  place in the ocean. PlastiC has its say The dancing, migrating plastic bags in American Beauty and The Majestic  Plastic Bag offer playful examples of the liveliness of matter, as well as the  potential for this liveliness to be mobilized for political purpose. In both  cases, though, this liveliness does not carry all the way to prosopopoeia. To  create a context in which plastic bags actually “say” something requires a  shift in genre, for, much as Gay Hawkins may want to animate the plastic  bag, to give of sense of its multifaceted “thing- power” (a term she borrows  from Bennett), she does not imagine the plastic bag “speaking,” in the sense  that a human being might speak. Plastics most certainly communicate in us  and through us, transforming not only our physical landscape, our cultural  mores, and our consumer expectations, but also the very material of our  bodies. Whatever “thing- power” plastic objects might have, however, it is  only in imaginative texts (fiction, poetry, drama, film) that a plastic bag  might actually be allowed to “speak.” Though the boy in American Beauty  might read the floating, dancing plastic bag as “like a little kid begging me  to play with it,”42 the simile disavows the anthropomorphism. It is “like” a  kid, but it is not a kid. It looks animate, but we know that the wind is just  blowing it about such that it looks like it is dancing. It is not nature, not hu- man; it is artificial, much like the family to which the boy who makes this  small short within the film belongs. The bag is animate, but it demands  little of the viewer beyond aesthetic observation.43 In the interest of pursuing the strategic possibilities of anthropomor- phism further, here, I turn to a set of texts that take plastic animation past  simile or metaphor, playfully giving voice to plastic, using the strategy of  prosopopoeia, and thus literally “letting plastic have its say.” These plastic  things— a bag, appearing in Ramin Bahrani’s short film Plastic Bag (2009); a  garbage sea monster, imagined in Rachel Hope Allison’s graphic novel I’m  Not a Plastic Bag (2012); a ball, the quirky narrator of Karen Tei Yamashita’s  Through the Arc of the Rain Forest (1990); and a kind of diffuse miasma, in  Adam Dickinson’s poem “Hail” (2013)— all take on human qualities  through speech, addressing the audience directly in order to render them- selves objects of human concern. In each case, this is not, perhaps, true  anthropomorphism— given the whimsy in each, there is no real confusion  of “being” or “substance,” no sense that plastic “really” could talk or think.  </page> <page sequence="13"> Revised Pages letting PlastiC have its say 135 Rather, these texts animate plastic objects in order strategically to engage  the viewer or reader in a different sort of ethical relationship to plastic.  Presented not as cheerily malevolent but as oddly sympathetic and inno- cent, these plastic things observe the society of which they are products  with a usefully defamiliarized eye that, in turn, requires a different sort of  reflection on our own positions as subjects in risk society. Such narratives are not new, of course. Indeed, the particular texts I  consider here might be seen as contemporary iterations of a genre that  came to prominence in the eighteenth century, the “it- narrative.” As Jona- than Lamb describes it, “the narrative usually begins when a thing comes  out of circulation and looks back at its career, sometimes nostalgically, but  mostly with incomprehension, disapproval, or resentment.”44 Lamb’s use  of the word “thing” is important, for he distinguishes “things” from  “objects”— the latter might be useful commodities that produce us as  consumer-s ubjects; the former, however, act uncannily outside of the realm  intelligibility, as those items we thought we threw away come back to re- mind us that, on a finite planet, “away” is itself an ideological rather than  geographical concept. I begin with another film in what I am tempted to describe as a growing  subgenre of the plastic bag, Ramin Bahrani’s Plastic Bag (2009). Like The  Majestic Plastic Bag, Plastic Bag features celebrity voice- over. In this case,  though, Werner Herzog’s voice is not to represent some fictional ecoceleb- rity, but the bag itself. Known for his unconventional nature/culture docu- mentaries (Grizzly Man [2005], Encounters at the End of the World [2007]),  Herzog is an apt choice, for, as James Palmer remarks in his review of Plas- tic Bag, Herzog “lends a gravitas to this film that allows nihilistic observa- tions and big questions to be asked by Plastic Bag without the slightest  sense of pretention” since “we have heard this same voice asking similar  questions in Herzog films.”45 Palmer’s choice to turn the thing into prop- erly named subject (not “the plastic bag” but “Plastic Bag”) highlights the  degree of anthropomorphism in the film, and alludes, perhaps, to the ways  in which, as Paul de Man argues, anthropomorphism seems to “freeze the  infinite chain of tropological transformations,” yielding “no longer a prop- osition but a proper name, as when the metamorphosis in Ovid’s stories  culminates and halts in the singleness of a proper name, Narcissus or  Daphne or whatever.”46 Though conceivably the real hedge on the bet of  nonbiodegradability in this short, ephemeral film is the proper name “Wer- ner Herzog,” de Man’s “or whatever” seems particularly appropriate to  describing Plastic Bag, a character that hovers in the spaces between a  “what” and a “who.” That anthropomorphism produces the effect of a  </page> <page sequence="14"> Revised Pages 136 Risk CRitiCism proper name is especially appropriate to the message of the film, for, as  Derrida notes, a proper name militates against biodegradability (“the  proper name— the proper name function— finally corresponds to this func- tion of nonbiodegradability”).47 In the case of Plastic Bag, the purpose of  the film is to extend plastic’s cultural life to something closer to the nonbio- degradability of its material life, to make plastic waste appear in the cul- tural archive as it does in the ecological archive. If The Majestic Plastic Bag seems to position its viewers as armchair  nature- enthusiasts, observing our own detritus as uncannily possessed of  an external, “natural” life of its own, it still allows us to remain passive  observers. Not so in Plastic Bag, in which the Herzog- voiced protagonist  addresses us directly, giving us insight into its interiority, its own existen- tial crises arising from its expulsion from human society and its duration in  the Pacific. Indeed, given that Herzog provides its voice, the bag is,  strangely, gendered, and “his” relationship with the female consumer he  calls his “maker” is at once oddly familial and romantic, producing a dif- ferent model both for the relationship with plastic represented in the film  and for the relationship of plastic objects to the viewer of the film. Plastic  Bag comes to consciousness when he is opened by the checker at the gro- cery store, the opening of the bag a “breath” that imbues the plastic with  life. This is a moment of misidentification, as the newly awakened Bag, in a  comical enactment of commodity fetishism, mistakes the consumer for the  creator, thus effacing, for himself and for us, the processes by which petro- leum products like plastic are actually made. But the point seems also to  target that casual consumer who, in choosing to accept the bag, produces it  as waste, turning object into uncanny thing. In this context, it is perhaps not  surprising that his “maker,” the one who makes by consuming rather than  producing, is female, reflecting an ideological feminization of consumption  more generally. A good ecoconscious consumer, the maker reuses Plastic  Bag a number of times, a process that climaxes when she fills him with ice  for an injured ankle, an intimacy that Bag finds initially “shocking,” but  also alluring: “This brought me closer to her than ever before, my skin  against her skin, my cold her warmth; I made her happy, and she made me  happy. I thought we would be together forever.” This almost Oedipal mo- ment of transgression offers some comic relief, clearly, but it also might  suggest to the consumer-v iewer, presumably herself a user (and reuser) of  plastic bags, a sense of her own unthinking reliance on— and potentially  abuse of— plastic bags. Describing the passage from “object” to “thing,” Jonathan Lamb sug- gests that while the former is situated in the realm of the human, a part of  </page> <page sequence="15"> Revised Pages letting PlastiC have its say 137 the symbolic exchange of goods, the latter is external to this system, marked  by its “irrelevance to any human system of value.”48 An object’s transition  to thing is, he argues, “not dialectical”: “Once having made the change,  things do not return as anthropomorphized items in the systems of ex- change and symbolic labor.”49 It is this transformation that the film  describes— and, in the process, undoes. Plastic Bag very quickly moves  from useful commodity to uncanny thing, a process that the bag does not  understand he has undergone. Even in the landfill, the bag imagines that  “it must have been a mistake. . . . I imagined her crying, ‘Where is he?  Where is he?” And it is at this point that the bag comes to realize the differ- ent temporalities that govern plastic— the speed with which plastic turns  from useful helpmeet to waste, and the uneven duration of its own lifespan  against an organic environment: “The world decomposed. It was eaten by  monsters, some too small for me to even see. Not me. I remained.” Plastic  Bag resembles, certainly, the monster in Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein, a  novel so often mobilized to imagine the havoc genetically modified food  might wreak on its “makers,” but unlike Frankenstein’s monster, Plastic  Bag never knowingly gives in to murderous wrath. The damage he might  cause is collateral, as when, having found the Pacific Ocean, he is partially  consumed by sea life: “Some ate pieces of me until they realized I was use- less to them. I wonder where those little pieces are now.” The ominously  open- ended query reminds us that those pieces, wherever they are, persist,  out of sight and mind, but still extant, now multiple miasmatic “things”  that retain nonetheless the identity of the original. Plastic’s persistence becomes a source of great ambivalence in the film.  Certainly, the nonbiodegradability of plastic is something that human be- ings tend to lament, even as we are, at the same time, grateful for a sub- stance that is so resilient and resistant to mold, rot, rust, or decay. That the  plastic itself might lament this—r ather than, malevolently, glory in it— is  something that we don’t generally consider, given that plastic does not “la- ment” or “glory” about anything. In his review of Plastic Bag, James Palmer  suggests that the film’s protagonist is most analogous to those in the poems  of Tennyson, “Ulysses” and “Tithonus,” Plastic Bag’s journey to what he  calls the vortex taking on shades of the epic, his aging- but- not- dying a  “cruel immortality.”50 The references here highlight the incongruity of the  anthropomorphism, as epic heroes and princes become analogous to a  flimsy piece of garbage, the waste of contemporary consumer culture. And  Plastic Bag is not content to remain a thing. Though he finds temporary  solace in the camaraderie of the vortex, a place where bags are “free and  happy,” the film’s end leaves Plastic Bag still yearning to find his maker.  </page> <page sequence="16"> Revised Pages 138 Risk CRitiCism “And when I do,” he tells us, “I will tell her one thing: I wish you had made  me so that I could die.” Of course, Plastic Bag does not find his maker, but his message is passed  along to viewers, proxies who have certainly themselves had similar rela- tionships to plastic bags, and it is this form of address that is central to the  film’s impact. Describing Gaston Bachelard’s argument about hybrid ob- jects, Bill Brown notes that it “portrays the material object world as another  medium through which we are constructed, by which subjects are, say, si- lently interpellated.”51 Plastic Bag, animated and ventriloquized, is, of  course, not so “silent” in its “hailing” of the subject, but the Althusserian  language is useful insofar as it highlights the ideological nature of the sub- ject’s constitution. The subject interpellated by Plastic Bag is individual- ized, consumerist, feminized, and as such a fairly familiar, even comfort- able, fit for the viewer herself. The environmental subject produced is  isolated, empowered perhaps in our individual acts of resistance (say,  bringing reusable bags and therefore refusing to “make” another such  bag), but the broader context of plastics—m anufacturing, transport, recy- cling, disposal—i s largely lost. Such individualized, consumer subject po- sitions are hardly rare in environmental films— take for instance Al Gore’s  An Inconvenient Truth (2006), which capped off its devastating account of  climate change with the modest suggestion that viewers swap their old in- candescent lightbulbs for the new (mercury containing) compact fluores- cents. The different scales on which the consumer and industry act produce  something of the disjunction that Beck describes in the context of the  Greenpeace protest of Shell: “‘Those at the top’ get the approval to dump in  the Atlantic an oil rig filled with toxic waste, yet ‘we down below’ . . . have  to save the world by dividing every teabag into three— paper, string, and  leaves— and disposing of them separately.”52 In this way, Plastic Bag may collude in what Beck has called the “indi- vidualization” of contemporary world risk society, a turn that is, for Beck’s  fairly liberal model of subpolitics, perhaps ambivalently positive (as indi- vidual consumers can “vote” with their dollars), but also quite limited.  Hailing us, Plastic Bag calls for a response, but the sense of responsibility  inculcated as a result remains locked in the claustrophobically contained  dyad of consumer and her similarly individualized and anthropomor- phized waste. Indeed, Plastic Bag goes further in explicitly resisting any  form of collectivity. When he finally arrives in the “vortex,” that plastic  Garbage Patch in the Pacific, he discovers his “own kind” and with it the  first- person plural: “I made it to the vortex. I was with my own kind. We  covered the area of a small continent. We were free and happy.” This shift  </page> <page sequence="17"> Revised Pages letting PlastiC have its say 139 to a collective “we” suggests a way to conceptualize a more widespread  and pervasive plastic presence, but Plastic Bag is not content to join in a  kind of hive mind. He discovers that “no one here thought about any- thing,” the aggregate plastic “continent” seemingly incompatible with the  vivification of prosopopoeial voice. But individuality on the scale of the single plastic item is not the only  way to animate plastic. A somewhat different strategy appears in Rachel  Hope Allison’s graphic novel I’m Not a Plastic Bag, in which a range of plas- tic and other waste items (a bag, a name tag, a tire, an umbrella) all make  their way to the Pacific, there to agglomerate as a single organism that,  serendipitously, ends up communicating via the text and icons on the sur- faces of its pieces, a smiley face on the bag, “Hello” and “My Name Is” on  the name tag.53 Here, these objects-t urned- things retain that residue of hu- man voice which highlights their very incongruity. Though the words are  in some ways accidental, over the course of the text, Allison presents the  aggregate waste as a single organism, floating in the ocean like a prehis- toric or extraterrestrial creature, luring birds to their doom— at once inno- cent and malicious in its cheery smiley face and friendly greetings. Alli- son’s garbage creature is born, not in the process of consumption, but in  those forgotten spaces of abjectification, thus emphasizing the “thingness”  of its being. As the floating garbage assumes its shape— a tire forms one  eye, an umbrella another; its plastic arms stretch down into the water— the  text changes, again based on what is possible on discarded signs— “Hello”;  “Come in We’re Open”; “Welcome”; “Please”; “Nice Day”; “Thank You”;  “Come Again”— in a seeming effort to communicate with the sea life the  waste- creature encounters. By the end of the book, the particles of plastic  having broken down— degraded, but not biodegraded—t he same “face”  appears in the sky above the water, smiling its eerie grin as a seagull flies  below. Somewhere between The Majestic Plastic Bag’s beast- morphizing  and Plastic Bag’s anthropomorphizing, Allison’s strategy highlights the un- canny human/inhuman qualities of (plastic) waste. Commenting on her  inspiration for the project, Allison recalls: “Like a lot of people, just learn- ing that something so big and dangerous existed out in the ocean was kind  of a shock, and the image of all that debris, trapped in such a remote part  of the ocean, really stuck with me. That said, even some of the most dis- turbing pictures of the Garbage Patch also had a kind of beauty to them,  and it got me thinking that the island itself might be a sympathetic charac- ter.”54 Like Plastic Bag in Bahrani’s film, the creature here is innocent, even  as the results of its presence are toxic, but in Allison’s graphic novel, the  problem is no longer a plastic bag per se. The “I” who is “not a plastic bag”  </page> <page sequence="18"> Revised Pages 140 Risk CRitiCism 4. From I’m Not a Plastic Bag. (Copyright 2012 Rachel Allison. All  Rights Reserved. Used with permission.) is a larger waste problem, and one that haunts the scene even after the  floating island has dispersed (but not disappeared). “gloBal PlastiC”: imagining the ColleCtive Bahrani’s film and Allison’s graphic novel offer tools for conceptualizing  the plastic waste question— one can easily imagine, say, one of the Los An- geles reservoir’s balls making a journey similar to that of Plastic Bag,  though perhaps with a jauntier voice-o ver, or joining the aggregate waste  creature in the Pacific, forming, say, an appealing dimple on its composite  “face.” These imaginings of the afterlives of plastic objects— their transits  into inconvenient and uncanny “things”— help to forestall the cultural bio- degradability that contrasts so dramatically with the ecological nonbiode- gradability of plastic. Bringing these things back into circulation, Plastic Bag  and I’m Not a Plastic Bag interpellate environmentalist-c onsumers, calling  us to ethical responsibility— in the case of Allison’s narrative, this con- sumer is figured quite explicitly in the paratexts, the forward by Jeff Cor- win (executive producer and host of ABC’s Ocean Mysteries) and afterword,  “I’m Not an Ocean Polluter,” which provide practical information on how  to ameliorate the waste problem. Plastic objects are, in these texts, not “ma- </page> <page sequence="19"> Revised Pages letting PlastiC have its say 141 levolent”; indeed, they are presented with the kind of “sympathy” and  “ethical concern” that Gay Hawkins suggests might be more “environmen- tally friendly” than disgust or horror. In recounting the tragic fate of plas- tic— to be discarded with so little care or contemplation— these texts aim to  develop our sense of responsibility to and for it. The anthropomorphism  reminds us that there is a good deal of the human mixed up in plastic, em- phasizing a relationship that we might wish to disavow, especially when  the plastic moves from useful commodity to placeless synthetic matter. But  these texts might highlight as well the representational challenges that re- main. Rachel Hope Allison’s composite creature begins to mitigate the in- dividualism of the single plastic bag (and consumer), but arguably it still  does not quite capture the elusive globality of plastic. Her garbage monster  is modeled on the premise that the Garbage Patch is an “island,” singular,  representable, an image that avoids the troublingly nebulous qualities of its  actual presentation in the ocean— a fact of which Jeff Corwin reminds us in  the afterword when he describes the “patch” as a “trash stew.” And graphic  as such descriptions may be, they still do not take in the reach of plastic in  all of its miasmatic ubiquity— qualities that make the global plastic phe- nomenon difficult to present as a “character.” Taking in plastic’s global scale may seem, then, to require a strategy  other than anthropomorphism, which tends, as I have suggested, to indi- vidualize, but I would like to turn, here, to a text that attempts to render  these moves compatible, animating a single plastic “character,” while still  insisting on the elusively pervasive reach of plastic and other nonbiode- gradable waste, Karen Tei Yamashita’s magical realist novel Through the Arc  of the Rain Forest (1990).55 Set in Japan, Brazil, and the United States, this  novel maps a series of transnational crossings, financial, cultural, and eco- logical, all of which culminate in an environmental cataclysm that is tragic  for most of the characters involved. Through the Rain Forest is narrated by a  mysteriously omnipotent figure whose identity is revealed (only very  gradually over the course of the narrative) to be a ball made of a plastic  material that appears to be the side effect of the burying of nonbiodegrad- able wastes around the world. This ball is in orbit near the forehead of a  character named Kazumasa, a location that could limit its view, but it is  also possessed, as it informs us, of a “clairvoyance” that allows it, in a first-  person omniscient narrative, to map the movements of all of the diverse  and far- flung characters, as a religious pilgrim in the north of Brazil makes  a trek to the Amazon, or an American corporate CEO discovers the perfect  product, or a jealous husband in São Paulo bemoans the business trips of  his entrepreneurial wife. </page> <page sequence="20"> Revised Pages 142 Risk CRitiCism The origins of this mysterious ball are certainly resonant with the first  nuclear age, for, brought into being when a stray lightning bolt strikes the  water near the home of Kazumasa (who is, at this point, a child in Japan),  the ball appears as a kind of collateral piece of shrapnel, a molten portion  of the earth’s crust ejected in an unexpected and explosive moment. As  Caroline Rody notes, “The thunder and ‘flying mass of fire’ that bring the  ball to Kazumasa’s head surely recall the atomic bombing of Japan and the  mutations it bred.”56 But in this case the event in question is not the massive  flash or fireball, not the subsequent rain of radiation, but “a tiny piece of  flying debris,” some minor bruising and swelling, and the addition of a  personal satellite to Kazumasa’s field of vision. This expulsion of debris is,  as it turns out, revelatory of a very different set of ecological processes,  which have developed unseen and unacknowledged (but no less materi- ally) underground. As we learn as the story progresses, the ball is likely a  piece of a much larger geological phenomenon, a kind of plastic layer in the  earth’s crust, formed, the scientists in the novel speculate, “for the most  part within the last century, paralleling the development of the more com- mon forms of plastic, polyurethane and Styrofoam. Enormous landfills of  nonbiodegradable material buried under virtually every populated part of  the Earth had undergone tremendous pressure, pushed ever farther into  the lower layers of the Earth’s mantle.”57 The ball, then, is a tip of this plas- tic iceberg, a side effect that signals, not the explosive effects of nuclear ca- tastrophe, but the slower effects of an ecocatastrophe that has been happen- ing, quietly and relentlessly, over the course of a century. Yamashita’s  novel thus offers us an image of what Myra Hird notes is basic to any form  of waste disposal: “The management of waste ultimately fails. Fails to be  contained, fails to be predictable, fails to be calculable, fails to be a techno- logical problem (that can be eliminated), fails to be determinate.”58 This new plastic layer of the earth’s crust, the result of the geological  period of the Anthropocene, eventually surfaces in a number of global loca- tions, including the Amazonian rain forest in Brazil, a country to which  Kazumasa and his ball immigrate in search of work and adventure. This  geological formation, a giant sheet of plastic dubbed, by the locals, “the  Matacão,” is not only materially a hybrid (comprising nonbiodegradable  material and the earth’s natural forces), but it is hybrid as image as well,  conjuring both the Garbage Patch, here brought by currents terrestrial  rather than oceanic, and a kind of inversion of the “carbon sink” discourse  surrounding Amazonia— in place of a carbon- absorbing forest, the earth’s  “lung,” Yamashita figures a “garbage rise,” a locus for the world’s waste  that, as Ursula Heise suggests, evokes “the simultaneous presence of natu- </page> <page sequence="21"> Revised Pages letting PlastiC have its say 143 ral ecosystems, cultures, and histories from across the world in one loca- tion.”59 Though the plastics problem, in our world as in the world of the  novel, puts us all in the same boat (in the same plastic- filled ocean), Ya- mashita’s Matacão might remind us that we are not all in the same proxim- ity to hazard, not all as mobile or risk resilient; perhaps, to adapt Nixon’s  warning about life downwind, “We’re all plasticized now, some sooner  than others.” The ball’s relationship to the Matacão, which Kazumasa imagines is its  “true mother,”60 is unclear, even to the ball itself. It is tempting, given the  ball’s description at one point as an “impudent planet,”61 to read it as a  metaphor for the earth, speaking to us with a voice that, as Heise notes,  “emerges from the depths of geology,” but it is a planet “strangely trans- formed,” “half plastic and half rock, half waste and half raw material, and  it orbits around a human head as if to signal the inevitability of anthropo- centrism in even so fantastic a narrative strategy.”62 Indeed, in this case, the  anthropomorphism seems to lend itself to the anthropocentrism, for the  ball has far more insight into the lives and minds of the human characters  (who, after all, seem to think as it does) than it does into the ecological ac- tors, organic, synthetic, and somewhere in between— who are nonetheless  quite lively— that play such a vital role in the events that ensue. The ball  offers the charismatic anthropomorphized character with whom we might  identify and sympathize, and the Matacão is the mysterious (even to the  ball) substance that escapes such domestication. This relationship of plastic  character to larger plastic waste phenomenon may initially seem akin to  that figured in Plastic Bag. There, too, the “vortex” is an uncanny collective.  But Yamashita’s ball is not, as Plastic Bag is, an individual’s waste, the per- sistence of which is to pique our individual consumer consciousness. Made  of the same stuff as the Matacão, the ball, too, is representative of that larger  agglomeration of waste, a phenomenon that comes from here and else- where and affects everyone, whether any individual forgoes a plastic bag  at the grocery store or not. And, returning not as recognizable garbage but  as uncanny sphere, the ball is a “thing” removed from the “object”— or  objects— it might once have been, its lively operations incalculably unpre- dictable as a consequence. Though Plastic Bag moves out to sea, seemingly positioned external to  the system that produced it, the plastic waste in Through the Arc of the Rain  Forest reappears in a new form, and, as it turns out, one available for return- ing to the system of commodity exchange. Having come, presumably, from  the exploitation and transformation of previous natural resources, this new  substance becomes a natural resource in its own right, subject to new min- </page> <page sequence="22"> Revised Pages 144 Risk CRitiCism ing and generating new revenue and industry, raw material for revolution- izing industry and global consumer trends alike. Though it is initially im- permeable, eventually scientists manage, through a combination of acids  and lasers, to mine and use the plastic. Once this technique is discovered,  the Matacão is the ultimate “plastic” material, the perfect natural resource,  submitting passively to the infinite whims of global consumer culture. Ma- tacão plastic is so lifelike, so seemingly natural, that reproductions are of- ten mistaken for the real thing: “The remarkable thing about Matacão plas- tic was its incredible ability to imitate anything. . . . Matacão plastic  managed to recreate the natural glow, moisture, freshness—t he very sensa- tion of life.”63 This discovery inaugurates the “Plastics Age,” as Matacão  plastic is used in construction materials, in plastic foods (which are deter- mined to be not only to be edible but virtually calorie- free), and in plastic  surgeries— producing a “paradise of plastic delights” for modern global  society.64 But even while the novel tracks a giddy enthusiasm for this newly  plastic planet, it also chronicles the side effects, for the Matacão seems to  usher in further desertification of the Amazon, destroying habitat for wild- life and for locals who may formerly have made a living off of swidden  agriculture or rubber tree tapping. The exploitation of the Matacão provides an allegory for the (neo)colo- nial legacies of resource extraction in the global economy. For those for  whom it is plastic, the Matacão is, at least initially, a tremendous windfall.  As American CEO J. B. Tweep discovers, “An entire world could be created  from it,” and thus, in mining the material, his company, GGG, “had accom- plished what no one before had been able to achieve: it had turned plastic  into gold!”65 But the miracle material is only lucrative for the alchemists at  GGG. Though “the north of Brazil was a gold mine in plastic,” “those who  uncovered a piece of Matacão plastic in most cases did not have the technol- ogy to cut even a splinter of the stuff away from the mother lode.”66 And  even the Brazilian government, which initially imposes legal and economic  restrictions on research into Matacão plastics in an attempt to keep the prof- its from that research in the country, cannot capitalize on this natural re- source within its borders. As congressional members argue, “Brazil had  once before emptied its wealthy gold mines into the coffers of the Portu- guese Crown and consequently financed the Industrial Revolution in Eng- land. This time, if there was any wealth to be had, it had better remain in  Brazil.”67 This protectionism is, however, already legislated against by the  global economy, for, as other congressional members scoff, “The treasure of  the Matacão might, at best, make a small dent in their continuing interest  payments to the International Monetary Fund.”68 Just as colonial powers  </page> <page sequence="23"> Revised Pages letting PlastiC have its say 145 used Brazilian resources to finance the metropolis, so the multinational cor- poration, GGG, uses the market for Matacão plastics to line the coffers of its  New York office, the new metropolis for the neocolonial world. The Ma- tacão, then, becomes the perfect material and stage for global capital. Not  only is the global North able to dump its own waste on the global South, it  is able to “recycle” this waste, and to make a handy profit doing so. Accessing this plastic involves its own side effects, as the proprietary  blend of acids and lasers produces a runoff that proves to be toxic. In a tell- ing consequence, scientists find that rats exposed to the pollutant become  analogous to the vampire capitalists extracting the material, as, in the fifth  generation of those exposed, offspring “were found to develop fangs and  tiny horns and an appetite for blood.”69 Further generations, though, are  found to grow additional appendages, a mutation that characterizes the  three- armed CEO J. B. Tweep himself, and thus the corporation, GGG, is  able to spin these as potentially salutary, even therapeutic. Tweep’s hope- ful recasting of the runoff as salutary recalls Edward Teller’s notorious que- ries regarding radiation. “Cesium 137 in the fallout, by affecting reproduc- tive cells, will produce some mutations and abnormalities in future  generations,” Teller conceded. But, he continued: “This raises a question:  are abnormalities harmful?”70 Of course, those who are most likely to be  exposed to the runoff— and thus the test cases in these experiments in  mutation— are not likely to be those in charge of the industry itself. Indeed,  attempting to downplay the dangers of its new pollutant, GGG assures the  public that “disposal locations will not impact the social or environmental  structure as they are usually spaces made vacant by the mining itself.”71  Even as the global plastic sheet, the result of the world’s nonbiodegradable  garbage, has rendered the soil fallow, killing forest and farm alike, its min- ing will leave the new by- product solidly contained in geographical place  (at least for the time being). The context that the novel conjures is thus ines- capably global, as the plastic not only literally brings the characters to- gether but acts as a metaphorical vehicle for addressing global resource  extraction of all kinds— and the social, economic, and environmental con- sequences that accompany it. As it happens, the ball has a mysterious magnetic attraction to the Ma- tacão that makes it instrumental in discovering deposits of the material,  and thus both the ball and the novel’s other characters are swept up in the  larger narrative of capitalist development, at once innocent observers and  complicit participants in the environmental and social devastation that en- sue. This combination of innocence and complicity makes blaming any one  actant— human or plastic— impossible. At one point, late in the novel, the  </page> <page sequence="24"> Revised Pages 146 Risk CRitiCism ball reports that Kazumasa has “had enough of Matacão plastic”: “He  stared cross- eyed at me with a certain sinister irritation but eventually re- lented. It was not my fault. One did not simply separate oneself from a  lifetime of proximity.”72 The plasticizing of the planet seems likely to con- tinue, for, though Kazumasa believes “Matacão plastic was a finite re- source,” GGG, which has hired him and his ball to locate new deposits, has  plans to send him outside of Brazil, “to Greenland, central Australia and  Antarctica, not to mention every pocket of tropical forest within 20 degrees  latitude of the equator.”73 Kazumasa’s position here is very much like our  own: inundated by plastic, we have certainly had enough, but, also like  Kazumasa, we seem unable to avoid it, either as new products or as persis- tently nonbiodegradable waste. But the novel also breaks this seeming stalemate, not by imagining some  new environmental movement or technoscientific innovation, but via a  rather magical solution produced by the process of evolution. Even as Kazu- masa is looking at the ball with a “sinister irritation,” the ball is looking back  in a manner both “haggard” and “sad.”74 The cause of this helps to explain a  cryptic mystery in the novel’s frame, for the novel is not precisely narrated  by the ball, but by a reincarnated memory of the ball. The ball itself, as it  turns out, has become biodegradable. If the hybrid actants of garbage and  geological forces produced Matacão plastic, such forces do not end with it,  for a bacteria develops to fill the new ecological niche, and everything made  of Matacão plastic—f rom facial remolds to food to buildings and clothes to  the narrator itself— is consumed. The end of the novel closes the frame, the  voice returning to the presumed present, in which the narrator informs us:  “Now the memory is complete, and I bid you farewell. Whose memory you  are asking? Whose indeed.”75 Though one might have presumed the mem- ory to be the ball’s, this final query suggests otherwise. As readers of the  novel, having incorporated its narrative into ourselves, presumably the  memory is, at minimum, ours, individuals who have, in joining in the pro- cess of reading, become a collective, potentially global in scope. The magical solution that Yamashita imagines, whereby evolutionary  transformations overcome plastic waste, would seem to be possible only in  the space of a novel. In the real world, as we know, the addition and subtrac- tion that Patricia Yaeger uses to describe the “techno- ocean”— it “subtracts  sea creatures and adds trash”76— would seem to be relentlessly and mathe- matically predictable, making the total plasticizing of our planet a fairly safe  bet. But as Bruno Latour reminds us: “If a maxim had to be stitched onto the  flag of political ecology, it would not be, as some of its militants still believe,  the lapidary formula ‘Let us protect nature!’ It would be a different one,  </page> <page sequence="25"> Revised Pages letting PlastiC have its say 147 much better suited to the continual surprises of its practice: ‘No one knows  what an environment can do . . .’”77 Indeed, the media has been abuzz lately  with a variety of techno- and eco- fix solutions to the problem of plastic  waste that rival Yamashita’s in magical implausibility. In 2011, Nature re- ported, in a story uncannily like that imagined in Through the Arc of the Rain  Forest, that evolution itself has been acting in tandem with the plastic envi- ronment human beings have produced, for scientists have found, in the  ocean, bacteria that seem to have adapted to eat the plastic, a fact that “might  help explain why the amount of debris in the ocean has levelled off, despite  continued pollution.”78 And, in 2012, the Daily Mail reported that scientists  had found a fungus in the Ecuadorian rain forest that might “be used to  break down plastic, and so rescue the world from one of its biggest man-  made environmental threats.”79 Here, nature itself seems to offer a magical  alchemy by which the problem of the nonbiodegradable can be overcome.  Perhaps some future viewer will look on with condescending nostalgia at a  film like Plastic Bag (of the sort one encounters in those born, say, after the  end of the Cold War, who tend to look upon the first atomic age in this man- ner), plastic having achieved what Tennyson’s Tithonus could not, having  persuaded the gods to let him die— as if, to attach Derrida’s phrase to a new  referent, not to the “Paul de Man affair,” but to the question of plastic waste,  “Forget it, drop it, all of this is biodegradable.”80 Truth may end up being stranger than fiction, it seems, but before we  proclaim the triumph of evolutionary fixes and planetary resilience, we  might take a further precautionary lesson from Yamashita. Matacão plastic  is indeed eaten by bacteria, a magical ecological solution, but given our  knowledge of side effects, we might linger on the penultimate paragraph of  the novel. Here, the “old forest has returned once again,” we are told,  surely a reassuring moment for those who mourn its loss: “But,” the final  sentence reminds us, “it will never be the same again.”81 What residue re- mains of the Matacão? What, to borrow again from DeLillo’s White Noise,  will “happen to the toxic waste [or plastic] once it was eaten or to the mi- croorganisms once they were finished eating”?82 Invocations of similarly  precautionary questions accompany Gwyneth Dickey Zaikab’s article in  Nature: “Specialist bacteria seem to be eating the plastic garbage we throw  into the ocean,” she reports, “but whether they’re cleaning up our poisons  or just passing them back up the food chain remains to be seen.” According  to the expert she cites, ecologist Mark Browne, this process of bacterial di- gestion could easily be “yet another mechanism for the particles of plastic  that we throw away to potentially come back to haunt us.”83 Given Ya- mashita’s use of the future anterior, the “memory” commissioned for us  </page> <page sequence="26"> Revised Pages 148 Risk CRitiCism that, by the end of the novel has become the reader’s, one must imagine  that there is something (pre)cautionary in that final “But.” Something re- mains; whether it is ecological or cultural, haunting our thoughts or our  endocrine systems, embedded in our bodies or our brains— or both—  remains to be seen. fRom anthRoPomoRPhism to Plasti- moRPhism? Commenting on the inevitability of anthropomorphism, Timothy Morton  offers a provocative inversion appropriate to a world of animate matter: I anthropomorphize. It’s not that I anthropomorphize in some situa- tions but not in others. . . . Just as I fail to avoid anthropomorphizing  everything, so all entities whatsoever constantly translate other ob- jects into their own terms. My back maps out a small backpomor- phic slice of this tree that I’m leaning on. The strings of the wind  harp stringpomorphize the wind. The wind windpomorphizes the  temperature differentials between the mountains and the flat land.  The mountains are shellpomorphic piles of chalk.84 These variations on the theme of “- morphizing” all give a sense of a world  of lively actors. Thinking of plastic, we may inevitably anthropomorphize,  a fact that the plastic characters I have discussed here take to comically  hyperbolic extremes, but we do well to recall, as these texts also demon- strate, the extent to which plastic plasti- morphizes us in our own version of  the plastics age. The existence of disposable plastic, products, as Gay  Hawkins puts it, “made to be wasted,”85 has produced the world in which  we live in ways too pervasive to enumerate— food and beverage storage,  computers, furniture, building materials, bird balls for reservoirs, the addi- tion of plastic and subtraction of sea life. The biodegradability of that plas- tic is perhaps yet to come, but even if it were to break down, it may well be  turned, not into the nourishing stuff of soil, but into the toxins that then  reinvade our bodies, transforming us, as we are coming to see it has been  doing for some time, biologically as well as socially or culturally. The per- vasiveness of plastic, its “thing- power,” requires that we ask: What hap- pens when, in effect, we are a plastic bag, when plastic becomes part of our  cellular structures, our endocrine systems, our cancer cells, our germ lines?  What consequences might follow from recognizing what Stacy Alaimo has  </page> <page sequence="27"> Revised Pages letting PlastiC have its say 149 called the “trans- corporeality” of plastic waste?86 What kind of subject is  interpellated at once biologically and ideologically in such a moment? I would like to close by turning to a poem that stages these queries,  again by animating plastic, and by giving it a voice. The poem in question,  titled (in a tantalizing allusion, perhaps, to Althusser) “Hail,” is drawn  from Adam Dickinson’s extraordinary book The Polymers (2013), a text that  plays with the chemical and ideological structures of a plastic world. “Hail”  offers a series of sentence fragments, chopped into short lines that carry the  movement of the poem forward through the landscapes and bodyscapes  appropriate to its subject, as the banal disposable objects return as uncanny  things, saluting the reader: Hail Hello from inside the albatross with a windproof lighter and Japanese police tape. Hello from staghorn coral beds waving at the beaked whale’s mistake, all six square metres of fertilizer bags. Hello from can- opened delta gators, taxidermied with twenty- five grocery sacks and a Halloween Hulk mask. Hello from the zipped- up leatherback who shat bits of rope for a month. Hello from bacteria making their germinal way to the poles in the pockets of packing foam. Hello from low- density polyethylene dropstones glacially tilled </page> <page sequence="28"> Revised Pages 150 Risk CRitiCism by desiccated, bowel- obstructed camels. Hello from six- pack rings and chokeholds, from breast milk and cord blood, from microfibers rinsed through yoga pants and polyester fleece, biomagnifying predators strafing the treatment plants. Hello from acrylics in G.I. Joe. Hello from washed up fishnet thigh- highs and frog suits and egg cups and sperm. Hello. “Hail” from Adam Dickinson’s The Polymers87 In “Hail,” the speaker of the poem hails us with an anaphoric “Hello” com- ing from locations near and far, like a long- lost relative sending a postcard:  “hello” from “inside the albatross,” from “staghorn coral beds,” from “can-  opened / delta gators, / taxidermied / with twenty- five grocery sacks,” from  “the zipped- up leatherback,” and ultimately from “bacteria,” “breast  milk,” “cord blood,” “sperm.” And lest the environmentally minded con- sumer become too self- congratulatory in our purchases of clothing made  from recycled milk jugs, say, the speaker reminds us that it and its frag- ments are also in “microfibers / rinsed through yoga pants / and polyester  fleece”— in the air, the dust, the water. Moving from the ocean plastic— the  albatross made iconic by Chris Jordan’s Midway series, the beaked whale,  which made international news when it was killed by ingesting plastic  bags— back to the terrestrial consumer, his or her own body now housing  something that is still capable of a “hail,” these lines reverse that trajectory  of Bahrani’s plastic bag, back from the vortex and now pervasive. What is  anthropomorphized is no longer a visible thing. It is pieces, a miasmatic  “memory,” conceived biologically and culturally, that speaks from every- where and nowhere. It is hailing us like a long- lost friend, a traveler, one  that we thought we had sent away, but that comes back, uninvited and  </page> <page sequence="29"> Revised Pages letting PlastiC have its say 151 unwanted. The final “Hello,” the single word on the line, indicates that the  hail may be from closer still. Dickinson’s poem offers a rendering of the real problem that NOAA  highlights, that “manmade debris does not belong in our oceans and water- ways.” The NOAA website ends with the admonition that this problem  “must be addressed,” but this use of the passive voice may allow any of us  individuals to abdicate our responsibility to address this problem. “Hail”  turns that around— the plastic addresses us in a way that is uncannily fa- miliar, as though it knows us, individually, as though we were somehow  responsible for it. Our friendly helpmeet is still out there— inadvertently  killing wildlife— as well as “in here”— altering our biochemistry, our abil- ity to sustain ourselves, even quite materially in the sense of biological re- production (breast milk, sperm), and it is calling to us, reminding us of our  own complicity in its actions. We may very well, like Kazumasa, not be able  to separate ourselves from “a lifetime of proximity,” but a poem like “Hail”  ensures that we also will not forget this fact, presumably in the hopes that  we might mitigate future plastics production, consumption, and waste. In  the face of the “nebulous mass” of the plastics problem, Dickinson’s poem  helps us to see something that is there, but that we normally either do not  or cannot see, that miasmatic presence which plastic has on all scales, from  the global to the intimately local. PlastiC’s tell Plastic is, of course, the preeminently morphable substance. Its very malle- ability, mutability, plasticity, renders it capable of representing a number  of diverse forms, from plush toy animals to cars. As Bernadette Bensaude  Vincent suggests, “Plastics are shapeless; they have pure potential for  change and movement. They connote the magic of indefinite metamorpho- ses to such a degree that they lose their substance, their materiality, to be- come virtual reality.”88 Writing about this phenomenon in his short reflec- tion on plastic, Roland Barthes notes: “At the sight of each terminal form  (suitcase, brush, car- body, toy, fabric, tube, basin or paper), the mind does  not cease from considering the original matter as an enigma. . . . And this  amazement is a pleasurable one, since the scope of the transformations  gives man the measure of his power, and since the very itinerary of plastic  gives him the euphoria of a prestigious free- wheeling through Nature.”89  Barthes was writing in the 1950s, and while the amazement likely persists,  the euphoria is decidedly tempered. Today, if we consider the original mat- </page> <page sequence="30"> Revised Pages 152 Risk CRitiCism ter at all, in, say, our purchases of stuffed toys for cute birthday gifts, it is  surely still an enigma, but the sense that plastic is “free- wheeling through  Nature” is likely a decidedly less “pleasurable” one, the “terminal” forms  all too terminal— persisting long after their use, in landfills or oceans. In animating the plastic things that we might believe we have discarded,  the texts I have examined here indeed perform a kind of anthropomor- phism, but in retaining, in each case, the shape of the nonhuman thing  (bag, ball, miasma), they also undo the seeming “magic” of plastic’s mor- phing power. Plastics mimic all the way down, their endocrine- disrupting  qualities coming precisely from their ability to take on the shape of hor- mones, misrecognized, in turn, by our own bodies. Plastic bags mimic jel- lyfish in the oceans, the favorite meal of leatherback turtles, or krill, crabs,  or squid, which albatrosses feed to their chicks. Alarmingly, too, as Chelsea  M. Rochman, Mark Anthony Browne, and their coauthors point out, our  regulatory system tends to endorse mimicry: “In the United States, Europe,  Australia, and Japan, plastics are classified as solid waste— so are treated in  the same way as food scraps or grass clippings.”90 To classify plastic thusly  is, however, not to let plastic truly have its say. As the authors go on to  point out, in their own research they discovered that “at least 78% of prior- ity pollutants listed by the EPA and 61% listed by the European Union are  associated with plastic debris.”91 Were regulators listening to plastics, they  might, as the authors argue, regulate them accordingly, thus producing a  different future. Were plastics production and consumption to proceed as  it has, “The planet will hold another 33 billion tonnes of plastic by 2050.  This would fill 2.75 billion refuse- collection trucks, which would wrap  around the planet roughly 800 times if placed end to end.”92 Reflecting  what plastic is actually saying by regulating it as hazardous could, they  speculate, reduce this to “just 4 billion tonnes”—s till, clearly, a staggering  amount of plastic.93 Certainly, in our own historical moment as in Barthes’s, magical think- ing about plastic persists, especially in the form of recycling, which con- sumers often see as a way to atone for plastic’s sins, a sense captured well  in Don DeLillo’s account of a visit to the recycling center in Underworld:  “Newsprint for newsprint, tin for tin, and we all feel better when we  leave.”94 There are substances like this, not newsprint, but glass, for exam- ple, that can be recycled virtually infinitely. But the percentage of plastic  waste that flows back into recycling is fairly low— the EPA reported it at 9%  in 2012.95 And even if it does make it to recycling, the most recyclable of  plastics is not very “plastic” in this sense. In the case, say, of HDPE, the  plastic used for the Los Angeles reservoir, the next form is likely the “ter- </page> <page sequence="31"> Revised Pages letting PlastiC have its say 153 minal” one. But this does not, of course, mean that more will not be made.  As it happened, Los Angeles’ use of the balls was precedent- setting— they  had not been used for drinking water reservoirs before (they were “bird  balls” used at airports), but following the city’s massive order, the manu- facturer, Orange Products, a “pioneer in the plastic balls industry,”96 quite  understandably began marketing the balls for use in such facilities. As  those of us on the ground continue carefully to separate our glass from our  plastic, squinting to read the resin codes stamped on the bottom, Orange  Products will be manufacturing these balls by the millions, warranted for  ten years, likely extant for millennia. The “hook” sentence in Francisco  Vara- Orta’s article on the Ivanhoe reservoir—“ The Los Angeles Depart- ment of Water and Power dropped the ball Monday. Actually, it dropped  400,000 of them”— ought perhaps to be taken more literally and seriously  than Vara- Orta seems to have intended.97 In letting plastic have its say, the texts I have considered here offer a  way to defamiliarize our own perspective, to look at plastic, not as some- thing we can discard, but as something persistently present, insisting on  our attention and care. Listening to plastic, in this case, means, not just ob- serving its magic morphologies, the ways in which it can mimic “the very  sensation of life,”98 but also recognizing its differences, its persistence, its  hazardous effects on life around it. In an age in which plastic is so perva- sive, in which even the laudable project of the My Plastic Free Life blog must,  by its very existence, rely on the plastics in a computer, we cannot simply  demonize plastic.99 But plastic is not just one thing among many. Plastic  may well be lively, and it certainly acts— and in this way it is very like other  “things”— but its participation in the world is something to be mitigated,  treated differently, say, than the “water, soil, stones, metals, minerals, bac- teria”100 with which it nonetheless inevitably interacts. Plastic seems infi- nitely morphable— even anthropomorphable— but appearances can be de- ceiving. Plastic bags might seem to say, as in the title of Rachel Hope  Allison’s graphic novel, “I’m not a plastic bag”— I am a jellyfish, a dancer,  an endangered species, a narrator— but an attentive reader must listen for  what we might call plastic’s “tell.” Roland Barthes, amazed by the myriad  and wondrous shapes that plastic can assume, but also wary of the way in  which it cheapens, gives us a hint: “What best reveals [plastic] for what it is  is the sound it gives, at once hollow and flat; its noise is its undoing.”101  Letting plastic have its say, the cultural texts I consider here offer another  way to imagine the “sound it gives,” for the stories that these plastic objects  tell are also a “noise” that might help lead to plastic’s undoing. </page> </plain_text>
