A· PATRIDES Paradise Lost and the Theory of Accommodation "Now we know God but imperfectly, enigmatically; but then we shall know him, with a perfect, cleare Meridian knowledge." Charles Odingsells (1637)1 ONE OF THE MOST FORMIDABLE PROBLEMS FACED BY JOHN MILTON IN Paradise Lost was the presentation of the war in Heaven. Critics, as we know only too well, are wont to regard that event as possibly Milton's greatest artistic failure; nor, we must confess, is their judgment wholly wrong. At the same time, however, we must recognize that Milton was constrained: for the conventions of the epic compelled him to introduce a battle of heroic proportions, while the need of an "example" for Adam and Eve necessitated the relation, specifically, of Lucifer's rebellion and fall. This is not to say that Milton's account of the war is beyond reproach. But at least we must credit him with such wisdom as he manifested in choosing the better of two unsatisfactory methods of presentation. The other method had been attempted by Thomas Heywood in The Hier- archie of the Blessed Angells ( 1635), where the embattled spirits were allowed "No Lances, Swords, nor Bombards," but only "spirituall Armes." This was the result: Lucifer, chargé with insolence and spleene; When nothing but Humilitie was seene, And Reuerence towards God, in Michaels brest, By which the mighty Dragon he supprest . . .2 Milton, in contrast, was sharply aware of his difficulties : to recount Almightie works What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice, Or heart of man suffice to understand?3 1 The Pearle of Perfection (London, 1637), p. 83; being one of the numerous variations of St. Paul's well-known statement in I Corinthians 13: 12. 2 The Hierarchie of the Blessed Angells (London, 1635), p. 341. ror a simüar dilemma faced by a lesser versifier, see John Abbot, Devout Rhapsodies (London, 1648), V. » Paradise Lost, VII, 112-1 14.</page><page sequence="2">Paradise Lost and the Theory of Accommodation.. 59 Raphael, commissioned to relate the war in Heaven, realizes that the problem is fundamentally one of language : for who though with the tongue Of Angels, can relate, or to what things Lik'n on Earth conspicuous, that may lift Human imagination to such highth Of Godlike Power . . .4 But since the "process of speech" cannot be avoided, he resolves to tell of things invisible to mortal sight in such a manner "as earthly notion can receave."5 His method was to adopt what has been happily de- scribed as an "extended metaphor,"6 which begins with the explicit statement that What surmounts the reach Of human sense, I shall delineat so, By lik'ning spiritual to corporeal forms, As may express them best,7 and ends some twelve hundred lines later with the observation that Thus measuring things in Heav'n by things on Earth At thy request ... to thee I have reveald What might have else to human Race bin hid.8 Raphael's method is not distinguished by any remarkable originality; we may safely assume, indeed, that most seventeenth-century readers of Paradise Lost would have recognized his procedure as an interesting application of the "theory of accommodation." This theory - one of the great commonplaces of the Renaissance - originated long before in an attempt to explain (perhaps even to explain away) the cruder anthro- pomorphism of the Bible, and notably that of the Old Testament. The locus dassicus is St. Augustine's statement in De Civitate Dei: Gods anger is no disturbance of mind in him, but his iudgement assign- ing sinne the deserued punishment: and his reuoluing of thought is an vnchanged ordering of changeable things: for God repenteth not of any thing he doth, as man doth : but his knowledge of a thing ere it be done, and his thought of it when it is done are both alike firme and fixed.

Α. PATRTOES Scripture without these phrases cannot instil into our vnderstandings the meaning of Gods workes nor terrifie the proud, nor stirre vp the idle, nor exercise the inquirers, nor delight the vnderstanders. This it cannot do with- out declining to our low capacities.9 This and more explicit formulations are repeatedly echoed throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Thus, elaborating on a parallel statement by St. Hilary of Poitiers,10 a minor apologist had this to say: Because our dulnes to conceiue the thinges of God is so great as wee cannot perceiue them, but by comparisons drawne from the things of men, for this infirmity of our vnderstanding, the scripture very often speaketh of inuisible thinges by visible, and shadoweth spirituall, by corporall.11 Time and again Renaissance England was cautioned against literal misreadings of the Scriptures. As Jean Veron declared in his "litel treatis" written "for the erudition and learnying of the symple &amp; ing- norant peopell" : e Whan we do read any where Í y scriptures that god is subiecte to passiones, or that he hath humayne lymmis, as a head, heares, eyes, and such lyke, it e ought not to be vnderstãdyd carnally, &amp; after y hystorye of the letter . . . But all thinges thus spoken, must be spiritually vnderstandid, and cõfessyd.12 9 XV, 25; trans. John Healey, Of the Citie of God (London, 1610), p. 565. For parallel statements, including those by Thomas Aquinas and Calvin, see Roland M. Frye, God, Man and Satan (Princeton, 1960), pp. 7-13. Professor Frye's work is an attempt to demonstrate that "the method of accommodation as operative in Scripture is also the basic mode of development in Paradise Lost" A sound thesis, soundly argued; but one fears that, in less competent hands, "the literal sence" may be altogether displaced by what George Gifford called "grosse and foolish allegories" (Foure Sermons [London, 1582], sig. A 8 v). Time and again Renais- sance theologians cautioned against such excessive zeal; typically, Calvin attacked all "Allegorimakers," thinking it "an euill thing to dally with the holie scripture by transforming of it intoo allegories" (Sermons . . . vpon the Booke of lob, trans. Arthur Golding [London, 1574], p. 733; for a similar English view, see Richard Montagu, Immediate Addresse vnto God Alone [London, 1624], p. 93). Whatever the merit of other interpretations, the literal was given priority - nowhere more clearly evident than in expositions of history's eschatay which I have discussed in "Renaissance and Modern Thought on the Last Things: A Study in Changing Conceptions," Harvard Theological Review, LI (1958), 169-185. 10 In De Tnnitate, Vlll, 43: [GodJ has so far tempered the language ot His utterance as to enable the weakness of our nature to grasp and understand it" (trans.

After all, well versed as he was in the writ- ings of the Fathers and later theologians, he could have gathered as much from earlier sources. And, once aware of the theory of accom- 13 Seriatim: Roger Hutchinson, The Image of God (Cambridge, 1550), fol. 7 ν; John Pelling, A Sermon of the Providence of God (London, 1607), p. 8; William Gouge, Gods Three Arrowes (London, 1631), p. 67; and John Byshop, Beavtifvll Blossomes (London, 1577), fol. 2.

But similar comments are to be encountered in nearly every work concerned with the "anger" of God; see in particular Luther's exposition in Works, éd. Jaroslav Pelikan (St. Louis, 1958), I, 14-15. Similarly, John Col et affirmed that the act of creation is described "so as to suit the conceptions of the multitude"; however, he trespassed into heterodoxy when he claimed that the account in Genesis is merely "a high and holy fiction." See his four "Letters to Radulphus" in loannis Coleti Opuscula Quaedam Theo- logica, ed. and trans. J. H. Lupton (London, 1876), pp. 3-28. 14 Richard Bernard, The Bibles Abstract and Epitomie (London, 1642), p. 3; I have eliminated the author's profuse Biblical references.</page><page sequence="5">62 C. A. PATRIDES modatíon,15 he resolved to utilize it as the basis of the "extended meta- phor" of the war in Heaven. Thus Raphael's attempt to liken "spiritual to corporeal forms" was but an application of the Biblical precedent to speak "of inuisible thinges by visible" and of "spiritual!, by corporall." In this manner, as another writer maintained, "vnder the vine and the barke of things visible and corporall, we draw neare vnto the flower and the pith of that which is inuisible &amp; spirituall."16 But the theory of accommodation applies not only to the war in Heaven but also to the Deity of Paradise Lost. Comments on Milton's reported anthropomorphism abound, in tones that are often scornful and sometimes even abusive. Surely, however, it is more profitable to consider that Milton's God is conceived not so much anthropomor- phically as anthropopathically, "after the manner of men." Not that the anthropomorphic conception of God needs to be frowned upon ; indeed, it is a point not widely known, yet one that is of some consequence, that a higher form of anthropomorphism is still very much part of the fabric of the Christian faith. There is not only irony but some truth in the ob- servation - usually attributed to Voltaire - that after God made man in His image, man retaliated. As Lewis R. Farnell wrote a number of years ago, it is not possible for us to disregard totally the anthropomorphic conception of God. In Farnell's words, no one has ever been able to imagine a divine personal power that in its na- ture, attributes, and activity was wholly non-human ; also, we find that the farther the ideal recedes from the human sphere the less is its value for real and practical religion. By its votaries the high-pitched theory of God as pure spirit is probably unattainable.17 Specifically, we should regard the Christian faith as "the most extreme and consistent expression" of the anthropomorphic approach. In the fuller statement of the distinguished theologian W. R. Matthews, The eagerness of some Christian thinkers to disclaim the title for their re- ligion is due to the mistaken notion that such a type of thought about God must be superstitious and childish . . . [Yet] the religious consciousness of Jesus was fashioned after this mode ; and it is surely significant that the two pivotal dogmas of developed Christianity are that man is made in the image of God and that God is manifested fully in the man Christ Jesus. Let us not be afraid of the plain implications of our faith.
