<plain_text><page sequence="1">Nietzsche and Hume Naturalism and Explanation P. J. E. Kail or those who think in misinformed stereotypes, Nietzsche and Hume are the A chalk and cheese of philosophy. Nietzsche is antiscience, a "postmodern ist" and doyen of "Continental" philosophy; Hume, a hard-nosed protological positivist and hero of "analytic" philosophy. These two stereotypes are so mis informed it is difficult to know quite where to begin in dismantling them. But for those who rightly read Nietzsche as a naturalistic philosopher, Hume is a point of comparison for the obvious reason that, thanks to Norman Kemp Smith and Barry Stroud, naturalism is at the heart of Hume's philosophy.1 How similar then are these thinkers? There have been a very small number of synoptic and topic-based comparisons of Nietzsche and Hume,2 but much, it seems to me, remains to be said; thus, this article is a prospectus for further work. The aim of this essay is to sketch the character of their shared naturalism and address two issues regarding it. One is their skepticism about causation. There is a prima facie problem here. A shared aspect of their naturalism involves attempts to explain, and explain causally, a whole host of phenomena by appeal to more minimal materials. Both, however, appear skeptical about causation itself, putting pressure on their explanatory aspirations. i shall show that there is no genuine tension for either thinker. The second issue i explore is the character of the explanations that they offer of dif ferent kinds of phenomena and what the philosophical ramifications might be. i should mention two caveats before we proceed. First, i am not here concerned to trace lines of influence from Hume to Nietzsche. Second, for reasons of space i will have to forego some of the detail necessary for a proper discussion, and a fortiori i shall be unable to defend fully the claims made for each philosopher. My main aim is instead to bring out what is common to their philosophical strategies. Both Hume and Nietzsche are "naturalists." But since philosophers as diverse as Spinoza, Quine, Aristotle, and John McDowell are "naturalists," this claim, while true, is relatively uninformative. To make some headway, we begin with JOURNAL OF NIETZSCHE STUDIES, Issue 37, 2009. Copyright ? 2009 The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA. Naturalism, Physiology, and Method 5</page><page sequence="2">6 P. J. E. Kail what Kant said of Locke. Kant said that Locke offered a "physiology of the understanding" that, "in tracing its vulgar origins in common experience," amounts to an "attempt to cast doubt on the pretensions of the supposed Queen." Fortunately, says Kant, this "genealogy" is a "fiction."3 The notion of "fiction" in this context is more interesting than it may seem, but I will not address this issue here. Instead, putting fiction aside, I shall suggest that what Kant describes is the kernel of the naturalism of Hume and Nietzsche.4 They offer "physiologies of the understanding" and "genealogies" of concepts that have experiential origins. These explanations, furthermore, sometimes "cast doubt" on the pretensions of what is explained. In what follows I shall try to unpack this claim. According to Brian Leiter, Hume and Nietzsche are speculative method ological naturalists constructing accounts of human nature "in order to explain various human phenomena."5 These general theories appeal to empirically determinable materials and principles that constitute their respective "physiolo gies." Obviously, their starting points are different. Hume appeals to "impres sions," "association," "sympathy," "sentiment," "imagination," and other notions, whereas Nietzsche appeals to "drive," "ressentiment" the "will to power," and "affect." However different in substance their basic materials are, both Hume and Nietzsche conceive such materials to be continuous with the rest of the natural world. In Hume's case, the vocabulary of A Treatise of Human Nature is recognizable from the psychophysiology of the period, which is given a mechanical gloss and is exploited in the explanation of animal behavior.6 Thus Ephraim Chambers's massive 1728 reference work Cyclopaedia, or, an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences contains entries on terms familiar to us from Hume such as imagination and association. Association, upon which the Treatise theory is built, was viewed as a mechanical and literally brute mechanism, which, according to thinkers like Hobbes, Descartes, Malebranche, Leibniz, and many others, governs the inferential mechanisms of reasonless animals. Similarly, much of Nietzsche's vocabulary is drawn from the (material istic) physiological and biological sciences of the day, which Nietzsche studied with great care.7 This is most significant with respect to the "will to power," which Gregory Moore has shown to be of a piece with movements in German biology, where the language of "appropriation," "drive," and "overpowering" is rife. So, although the materials to which they appeal are different, their naturalistic character is not. For these starting points are "physiological" in that they are not conceived to be radically different in kind from those taken to be operative in the natural, and particularly animal, world. Hume's theory of human nature and Nietzsche's attempt to "translate human ity back into nature" (BGE 230) share an assumption that human nature is not different in kind from the rest of nature. They reject the assumption that "You [humanity] are more! You are higher! You have a different origin!" (BGE 230). Nietzsche identifies as one of the "four errors" of GS 115 the placement of</page><page sequence="3">Nietzsche and Hume 7 humans "in a false rank order with animals and the rest of nature" (cf. D 31; HH11), and famously he expressed the psychology of the will to power in GM as the claim that "every animal... instinctively strives for an optimum of favourable conditions under which it can vent its power completely" (GM 111:7). But this is not to be conflated with the idea that there are no genuine differences between humans and other animals. For Nietzsche, humans, as well as being "diseased" (GMII:7) animals, have also become "interesting" ones (GM 1:6) and are still full of potential. For Hume there are great differences between humans and animals, differences that are enhanced through the formation of culture and convention. But what seemed to others to call for differences in kind?a Cartesian soul in the bete machine or a contracausal noumenal self?are explicable by appeal to more tractable animal material. This aspect of Hume's and Nietzsche's philosophies represents their sub stantive naturalism, an ontological claim that humans are part of nature. Their naturalisms are also methodological. Hume's and Nietzsche's naturalisms share in the rejection of a priori routes to knowledge. Hume's claim to be the "Newton of the mind" should be understood in the light of a key meaning of Newton's famous "hypotheses non fingo." This, when applied to physics, is a refusal to hold one's experimental result hostage to a priori conceptions of matter. Instead, any theory must be determined solely by results obtained through experiment and observation.8 Newton's view is a direct response to Cartesian physics, the theories of which are constrained by the claim that we have a priori knowledge of matter as pure extension. We do no "less honour to our native country," says Hume, when the methods of natural philosophy are applied to the science of man, comparing our ignorance of the essence of the mind with our ignorance of the essence of body.9 For him "it seems evident, that the essence of the mind being equally unknown to us with that of external bodies, it must be equally impossible to form any notion of its powers and qualities otherwise than from careful and exact experiments" (THN, xvii). So Hume's method is naturalistic in the sense that it is continuous with the observation and experimental approach that had triumphed in mechanics and continuous in the sense that it rejects any a priori conception of the mind constraining its results. Such a view clearly encourages empiricism. Nietzsche, like Hume, is skeptical of alleged a priori knowledge and lauds empiricism from BGE onward. Thus he writes that all "credibility, good conscience, and evidence of truth first come from the senses" (BGE 134; cf. BGE 15 and 77 "Reason in Philosophy" 3). This does not mean that Nietzsche must be uncritical of the results of science (see below); nor does it prevent him from questioning the value of truth or indeed holding that science itself cannot create the values that philosophers must (see, e.g., GM III; BGE 211). But these features of Nietzsche's philosophy depend on his belief that he is getting human nature more or less right?that is, in being correct about what kinds of creatures human beings are?and that empirical study is the root to such knowledge.10</page><page sequence="4">8 P. J. E. Kail Skepticism About Causation? The naturalism favored by Nietzsche and Hume is not of a semantically reduc tive sort (in the sense of reducing concepts into postulates regarding experience) but is, instead, explanatory in its aspiration.11 There are a number of different aspects to this shared explanatory aspiration that require discussion. Kant's claim that a "genealogy" can be an "attempt to cast doubt" is one such aspect, and another is the significant overlap regarding what Nietzsche and Hume see as requiring explanation, an overlap that includes the concepts of substance, self, causation, religious belief, ascetic valorization, and moral evaluation in general. The explanations are also causal explanations. But aren't both thinkers skeptical about causation? And if so, how can they offer causal explanations? It is undeniable that Hume and Nietzsche are "skeptical" about cause and effect. But we must distinguish between a skepticism that claims that there is no such thing as a causal relation and a skepticism about particular metaphysical theories of that relation and its epistemology. Nietzsche and Hume are skeptics of the second, and not the first, kind. A first point in support of this is the fact that both do avail themselves of causal explanations and causal language. Thus Hume seeks to understand "what causes induce us to believe in the existence of body" (TEN, 187) and the "causes" of religious belief.12 Nietzsche criticizes Christian "morality and religion" for being "completely out of touch with real ity" because inter alia they peddle in "imaginary causes" without "any concept of natural cause" (A 15). He then goes on to give a causal explanation of this misinterpretation of reality (A 15). These statements can be taken at face value because when we turn to the textual evidence in favor of causal skepticism, it supports the second and not the first kind of skepticism about causation. We begin with Hume or, more precisely, with one of Hume's influences, namely, Newton. Newton concerns himself quite obviously with the natural world and naturalistic explanation. But his own position emerges partly as a result of empirical criticism ofthe then-dominant mechanistic metaphysics and particu larly the metaphysics of causation. The mechanical metaphysics of causation pur ported to offer a perfectly transparent geometrical model for causal transactions, such that one could see just why such and such effect must happen. The model for causation is supposed to fit with the a priori-determined conception of matter as pure extension mentioned above. But Newton abandoned that model since it was inadequate to the experimental results and manifest phenomena such as action at a distance and cohesion. It furthermore failed to offer any genuine conception of activity since matter is defined as passive. None of this made Newton doubt the existence of causal relations, but it did lead him to develop an experimental philosophy that operates without any commitment to a transparent model of its metaphysics. Thus in the general scholium to the Principia Newton writes: "But hitherto I have not been able to discover the cause of those properties of gravity</page><page sequence="5">Nietzsche and Hume 9 from phenomena, and I feign no hypotheses; for whatever is not deduced from phenomena is to be called an hypothesis; and hypotheses, whether metaphysi cal or physical, whether of occult or mechanical, have no place in experimental philosophy."13 Hume wrote in his History of England that "Newton seemed to draw off the veil from some of the mysteries of nature, he showed at the same time the imperfections of the mechanical philosophy."14 Hume's critique of the causal relation is Newtonian inasmuch as he targets the idea that causal rela tions can be transparently intelligible to us, but it extends the scope of Newton's modesty. Newton famously offers speculations about the nature of gravity and the existence of ether but holds them to be empirically inadequate (having "no place in experimental philosophy"). Hume targets the very possibility of grasping any relation of cause and effect beyond mere regularity on the grounds that such a grasp must entail that we can see just why such and such effect must follow and render it impossible for us to conceive any other effect following that cause. But given that our concepts are constrained by the deliverances of sense experience, it is impossible for us to grasp this relation. The powers and forces of Newtonian speculation are "totally shut up from human curiosity and enquiry."15 Since our concept of powers outrunning regularities is not detected in experience, we are left without any conception of the powers underlying causal transactions. But this does not mean that Hume rejects the relation of cause and effect: rather, he holds that the relation between what are genuinely causes and effects is not something of which we can have a transparent grasp.16 Bearing in mind this distinction between the relation of cause and effect and the possibility of a transparent grasp of what is involved in that relation, let us now turn to Nietzsche. He writes that "we have no 'sense for the causa ejficiens': here Hume was right" (WP 530). The nature of the causal relation is not given in experience. Now, it is quite true that in earlier works Nietzsche appears to reject the idea that there are any causal relations. Thus at BGE2X he argues that we "should not erroneously objectify 'cause' and 'effect': ... We should use 'cause' and 'effect' only as pure concepts. In the 'in-itself' there is nothing like 'causal association.'" According to Maudemarie Clark these remarks betray an adherence to a neo-Kantianism that Nietzsche subsequently came to reject.17 The prior skepticism about causation is, on the reading, a particular instance of the more general "falsification thesis." Roughly, since (a) the "true world" is to be identified with the noumenal world and (b) like Schopenhauer and others, Nietzsche held it to be illegitimate to apply empirical concepts, including that of "cause" and "effect," to the thing-in-itself, any claim we make must falsify the "true world" and itself be false. However, according to Clark, Nietzsche subsequently abandoned the pernicious distinction between the noumenal and phenomenal world (cf. 77"How the 'True World' Finally Became a Fable"), and so the "falsification thesis" goes with it. Nietzsche's later works must be read in such a way in which the true world is identified with the empirical world, and the</page><page sequence="6">10 P. J.E.Kail application of causal concepts yields no error. This thesis of Clark's has not gone unchallenged, and although it is not possible to provide a full discussion of this matter here, Nietzsche's treatment of causation in the later works is sometimes used against this kind of reading.18 For some of the later statements do indeed have a skeptical ring to them. But, it seems to me, where Nietzsche does seem skeptical in the later works, we should understand him as skeptical of our grasp of causation, and of attempts to articulate the metaphysics of causation, rather than skeptical about the existence of causation per se. In 77"The Four Great Errors" (entitled the "error of false causation") Nietzsche writes: "People have always believed that they knew what a cause was ... how did we get this belief that we have knowledge?" (3). Nietzsche essays an answer, namely, that we "projected... three 'inner facts' out of themselves, and onto the world" (77 "The Four Great Errors" 3): the will, the mind, and the I. We think mistakenly that there is a substantial self that stands behind the causal efficacy of the will that constitutes mental causation. Our willing is supposed to provide us with a way of catching "causality in the act," together with the idea that the self and mental causation are established "as given, as empirical (77 "The Four Great Errors" 3; emphasis in original). But recapitulating a point made in BGE 19, the efficacy of the will is not "empirically given." The mistake that it is itself leads to a further one, the projection of the self and will onto the world inasmuch as we hold that natural causal efficacy is perfectly intelligible and involves causal transactions (such as "pushes" and "pulls") between discrete substances. And the notion of a substance is borrowed from the erroneous conception of self as simple substance. Nietzsche chides "Mr. Mechanist and Mr. Physicist" for promoting an atomist mechanical metaphysic modeled uncon sciously on the mistaken view of a transparent self with a causally efficacious will. This echoes the BGE 21 complaint about the "dominant mechanistic stupidity that would have the cause push and shove until it 'effects' something." The difference is that here Nietzsche is not suggesting that there is no such thing as causation but, instead, attempting to explain the belief that we understand the causal relation. The claim that "A is the cause of B" can be true, though the claim that we can fully understand the causal process on a mechanical model is false. This line of thought also explains why Nietzsche seems happy to appeal to causation and a distinction between genuine and imaginary causation, on the one hand, and make some scathing remarks about causal explanation, on the other. Part of the rationale for the mechanistic picture is that its purported explanations do not simply consist in identifying the causally relevant facts for some effect but also promise a transparent form of understanding of just why such and such a cause brings about such and such an effect. Newton rejected such models as completely insufficient for genuine explanation, without giving up on the idea that there are causal relations. This, it seems to me, is echoed unknowingly by Nietzsche: "Cause and Effect.?We call it 'explanation' but 'description' is what</page><page sequence="7">Nietzsche and Hume 11 distinguishes us from older stages of knowledge and science. We are better at describing?we explain just as little as all our predecessors. ... The series of 'causes' faces us much more completely in each case; we reason 'this and that must precede for that to follow'?but we haven't thereby understood anything. The specifically qualitative aspect for example of every chemical process, still appears to be a 'miracle,' as does every locomotion; no one has 'explained' the push" (GS 112). Now, it is quite true that in this passage Nietzsche goes on to evince a skepticism about cause and effect in general, but this is not a surprise since The Gay Science is a transitional text that shows worries about the legitimacy of applying concepts to the thing-in-itself (cf. GS 374).19 But the passage expresses quite clearly a skepticism about the possibility of attain ing a transparent understanding of the relation between cause and effect (and hence "explanation") in the manner I have been discussing. Once the distinction between the noumenal and phenomenal world is abolished, one can retain the skepticism about our grasp of such a relation without it being illegitimate to think of the world in causal terms. So both Hume and Nietzsche can offer what we nowadays recognize as causal explanation inasmuch as they do identify causally relevant features in an attempt to show how such and such emerges. Nevertheless, a point may come when the question of just why such and such must occur cannot be answered by us. Science, which Nietzsche identifies with "the healthy concepts of cause and effect" (A 49), is healthy inasmuch as it can offer empirical identifications of events that are related by causal dependence, without being necessarily able to offer a model of just why they have that dependence. A final point: Newton's skepticism about the reach of mechanism did not prevent him from speculating about the underlying metaphysic of forces in play with respect to gravity and cohesion. With this in mind, we might view Nietzsche's occasional gestures at a metaphysics of the will to power in the published work (e.g., in GM 11:12) in a similar light, though they are far less sustained and rather more speculative. I do not, it should be emphasized, want to make too much of this point. For while the will to power is important to Nietzsche's psychology, its extension, and its importance, beyond that domain is very limited in the published works. After all, as Leiter points out, Nietzsche makes no mention of the will to power in his Ecce Homo review of his work. But there is nothing antinaturalistic in speculating about the metaphysics of causation in the belief that the dominant paradigm is explanatorily inadequate. As Gregory Moore has shown, the doctrine of the will to power was deeply informed by Nietzsche's interpretation of strains of thought in nineteenth-century biology,20 and his unpublished work connects the notion of efficacy per se with that of the will to power (e.g., WP 689).21 Be that as it may, the notion of the will to power as giving a genuine metaphysic of efficacy does not condition the naturalistic explanations that Nietzsche actually offers.</page><page sequence="8">12 P. J.E.Kail Naturalistic Explanation and Its Consequences As mentioned above, Leiter sees both Hume and Nietzsche as offering a general theory of human nature to "provide a basis for explaining everything in human affairs."22 But of course, they do not just attempt to provide a basis for explana tion. They also offer explanations of some phenomena. And what is more there is substantial overlap regarding what it is they seek to explain. What is it that Nietzsche and Hume seek to explain naturalistically? And what are the conse quences and significance of their strategies? I begin by briefly listing the shared areas of explanation. Both seek to explain the emergence of certain central concepts, including that of a substantial self and of causal efficacy, as well as religious belief and moral concepts, including a certain ascetic version of morality. Where they differ in the kinds of explana tions they offer is partly due to the differences in their basic accounts of human nature, which I described very briefly earlier in this article. They also differ in detail and focus. For example, Hume offers more detailed explanations of the ideas of self and causation than Nietzsche does, whereas Nietzsche, unlike Hume, offers a rich account of conscience and guilt. Clearly the explanatory dimension of their philosophies is important to them. In what follows I shall have to be somewhat sketchy about the details of some of these explanations (and silent on others), but I hope to provide enough detail to address our second question. Recall Kant's idea that a "physiology of the understanding" can be seen as an "attempt to cast doubt." How so? Much turns on the particular explanations offered, but let me begin with some schematic distinctions that will help guide subsequent discussion. It is important to note first that some forms of naturalistic explanation need not cast any doubt on the relevant explananda. Naturalistic accounts of cognitive architecture or processes (say, connectionism or Marr's account of vision) cast no doubt whatsoever on the phenomena of inference and vision. Second, success ful naturalistic accounts might cast doubt not upon the explananda themselves but on interpretations of, or attitudes toward, those phenomena as relevantly different from "mere" nature. Consider Nietzsche's account of conscience or Hume's account of our reasoning processes. Both accounts are articulated against competing nonnaturalistic interpretations of those phenomena. Conscience for Nietzsche is not "the voice of God in man" (EH"GM"), and reason for Hume is not an unreduced Cartesian faculty of rational insight.23 These phenomena are instead explained in tractable naturalistic terms that do not trade in the metaphysi cally dubious. So it is the nonnaturalistic interpretation of those phenomena that is cast into doubt, not the phenomena themselves. So "explained" naturalistically is not the same as "explained away." I shall not here concern myself too much with that strategy but focus, instead, on explanations that are related to "casting doubt." One aspect of this strategy</page><page sequence="9">Nietzsche and Hume 13 is that alternative claims about the extent and nature of our knowledge can be called into doubt precisely because no genuinely informative account of how we can grasp that alleged realm is available. Thus Nietzsche complains that Kant's concern to show our "right" to use certain concepts is explanato rily empty: synthetic a priori knowledge is possible "by a faculty ... though unfortunately not in so few words, but rather so laboriously, reverentially, and with ... an extravagance of German frill and profundity" (BGE 11). Second, one might hold (as Nietzsche and Hume do) that certain key beliefs are false. Here an explanation of our possession of such beliefs comes into play because to defend that position fully one needs to be able to show just why we have those beliefs. Third, there is a line of thought, familiar from Gilbert Harman's discussions of moral realism, to the effect that if we can fully explain our possession of a certain class of beliefs without having to cite their relevant objects, then the explanation renders those objects redundant.24 Fourth, an explanation can cast doubt on a belief by casting doubt on the reliability of the origins of that belief With these distinctions in mind, let us turn to the text. For Kant the central con cepts of power, self, and substance are conditions of the possibility of experience: for Hume and Nietzsche the emphasis is on showing how such concepts might arise given a more minimal, naturalistically characterized, input. Sometimes this is motivated by a claim that the belief to be explained is false. As mentioned, merely arguing that such and such a belief is false may not convince unless one can account for just why we have that belief. This demand is expressed in Hume's discussion of self, substance, and certain conceptions of causation and in Nietzsche's discussion of similar topics at various places (e.g., BGE I "On the Prejudices of the Philosophers"; GS 110, 112, 121; and elsewhere). Both famously reject a substantial self as the locus of mental activity. Nietzsche calls this the "atomism of the soul" and instead proposes that we consider the self as "a society constructed out of drives and effects" (BGE 12). Hume says that we cannot "more properly" compare the soul to "a republic or commonwealth, in which the several members' [perceptions] are united by ties of government and subordination, and give rise to persons, who propagate the same republic in the incessant change of its parts" (THN, 261). Hume's negative conclusion is partly fostered by the claim that no substantial self is given introspectively. There are elements of this in Nietzsche too. He writes: "'The subject' is not given, it is something added and invented and projected behind what there is" (WP 481; cf. 477). Though sharing in this negative conclusion, their respective explanations of the false belief in a substantial self differ. Hume offers an account appealing to the associational relation of resemblance that fools the mind into thinking that resembling perceptions are connected by something simple (THN, 254). Nietzsche thinks that the belief is fostered by the "grammatical custom" of the use of the first person pronoun, which rests of the (false) doer-deed</page><page sequence="10">14 P. J. E. Kail distinction (WP 484; GM 1:13). They agree that there is a false view of the self as a substantial unity, one that requires explanation. This is part and parcel of a shared skepticism about substances per se. For Nietzsche our beliefs in self, substance, and the intelligibility of causation are linked. Recall that in TI"The Four Great Errors," Nietzsche argues that we have "projected ... three 'inner facts' out of themselves, and onto the world" (3), and one such projection is the transformation of the false belief in a substantial self into a belief in substance per se. For Hume, the general belief in substance emerges from the operations of the imagination on resembling perceptions in the manner briefly mentioned above. As I also noted, for Nietzsche the idea that we have a transparent understanding of natural causation owes itself to an anthropomorphic projection of the (supposedly given) causal efficacy of the will. Hume, like Nietzsche, does not take the efficacy of the will as an empiri cal given.25 Nevertheless, again like Nietzsche, Hume holds that we engage in a projection of this false assumption to provide a conception of natural causation. He holds?again like Nietzsche (cf. HH111)?that religious belief emerges because our failure to understand the natural causal nexus triggers a disposition to anthropomorphize nature that offers a doubly false model of nature governed by the active will of invisible intelligent power.26 This same projective disposition, according to Hume, is behind the fiction of substantial form and substance favored in Aristotelian philosophy. For Hume this "fiction" is a psychological reaction to our failure to grasp genuine efficacy, breed ing anthropomorphic notions like "sympathies, antipathies and horrors of a vacuum" (THN, 224).27 We have then a common pattern of explanation: identify a false belief, and appeal to psychological recourse to explain it. Again, for both there is a false belief in play?a certain conception of power modeled on human wills?for which they offer an explanation. Obviously the explanations they offer are consistent with the falsity of those beliefs, but the beliefs are held to be false on independent grounds. A second strategy is a Harmanesque line of thought that seeks to cast doubt on beliefs by simply showing that their putative objects are explanatorily redundant. This strategy is common to Hume and Nietzsche, but its deployment is complicated. For example, in Hume's case the beliefs in causal connections and the external world in general are also given explana tions that are consistent with their falsity. This raises a worry about whether we are therefore entitled to maintain those beliefs. In connection with Hume's explanation of our belief in the external world Barry Stroud writes: "Even if we are not obliged to explicitly regard it as false, we will see it as something we would believe in, just as we do, whether there actually were any world like that or not. We would see that we would inevitably have come to believe in it whatever the world around us, if any, actually happens to be like.... But can I see my own beliefs as 'fictions' in that way?"28 One thing that worries Stroud concerns the particular belief under consideration, namely, the external world</page><page sequence="11">Nietzsche and Hume 15 belief, and is part and parcel of Stroud's questioning of the very strict constraints of Hume's empiricist naturalism. But we must be careful not to import worries revolving around this particularbdief (e.g., whether we can genuinely conceive of persons in a world without "external object") into the general issue. The relevant question is: If we can explain the presence of a certain class of a belief in a way that is consistent with the falsity of those beliefs, what impact might that have? And one answer is this: If we have independent reasons to believe in the objects of those beliefs, then it should have none at all. For although we might offer an explanation of how we come to believe something that is con sistent with the falsity of the belief so explained, that does not foreclose the possibility of establishing those objects on independent grounds. Consider the once popular social science explanations of particular scientific beliefs, which purported to show how certain scientific beliefs become infixed because of merely social factors, such as peer esteem and favoritism, fashion, and the like. We might take this as a possibility, or even historically compelling, but such an emergence story is perfectly consistent with there being ways of verifying the correctness of the relevant theory. We might learn something about the human all-too-human activity of science, but it does not itself serve to undermine those beliefs (unless one buys the Rortyesque extravagance that the whole of our "epistemic" situation is like this). The simple point is that how we come to believe something does not foreclose the possibility of subsequent activity whereby that belief is verified. For while we might explain our beliefs without such posits, the posits might subsequently explain something else. One of the peculiarities of the external world belief that Stroud focuses on is that it con cerns solely the order of our experience and not how the features of the world act in a way independent of it. If we cannot make good the idea of something external to our experience, then we cannot distinguish between explaining how we acquire our beliefs and positing things that explain how belief-independent things act on other belief-independent things. This explains why moral properties are, however, vulnerable to Harman's objec tion. Put bluntly, all that moral facts or properties can do?if they are to do anything at all?is explain our beliefs and perceptions of them. Morality only has any effect on the world through people's moral beliefs, and if we can explain those without the alleged moral properties, such properties are redundant. I shall take it as read that neither Hume nor Nietzsche subscribes to a nonnaturalistic realism about values. Hume, for example, seeks to explain the character of our evaluative thought and experience as such by appeal to a mechanism of projection, whereby we "gild" and "stain" natural objects with our sentimental responses.29 Moral properties are not cited to explain moral beliefs. But we need to be careful about the extent to which such explanations "cast into doubt" for Hume. For he does not take this "discovery" (THN, 469) to imply that the practice of morality is to be abandoned. He sees the error as an eliminable feature of ordinary thought, which does not undermine the "reality of virtue" (THN, 469), just as the fact that our experience of color involves</page><page sequence="12">16 P. J.E.Kail a projective response does not undermine the reality of color. Indeed, the majority of Hume's explanation of the phenomena of morality is aimed not at undermin ing morality but, rather, at explaining it in naturalistic terms in a way that under mines competing theoretical accounts that appeal to nonnaturalistic materials. The account of morality draws upon a psychology that includes sentimental responses, the mechanism of sympathy, and a host of passions including limited benevolence and concern for one's offspring, all of which are situated in the more basic framework of his associationism. This psychology is augmented by some conjectures about the kinds of situations in which human beings might find themselves, including, crucially, assumptions about the scarcity of resources. The account attempts to explain how, from these limited resources, institutions such as justice can be seen to emerge, and it is an account that is articulated against an opposition that includes the quasi-Platonism of moral rationalism and a providential stoicism. Explaining here is not a matter of explaining away morality but of explaining away the need for materials that transcend human nature. Nietzsche's account of morality is also naturalistic and explanatory. His atti tude toward morality is somewhat different, and his Genealogy is calculated to call it into doubt. So what is the difference? There is evidence that Nietzsche exploits something like the Harman-style explanatory argument against non naturalistic realism. Thus in Daybreakhe tells us that as "the sense for causality increases, the extent of the domain of morality decreases ... [we come to have] destroyed a countless number of imaginary causalities hitherto believed in as the foundations of customs?the real world is much smaller than the imaginary" (10).30 But this passage is ambiguous between criticism of ordinary thought, conceived as committed to an untenable metaphysic, and acriticism of particular theoretical glosses put on ordinary first-order practice. Recall that I said that some naturalistic explanations "call into doubt" not what is explained but non naturalistic interpretations of it. So Nietzsche here might be taking ordinary thought to task, or instead he might be targeting a certain interpretation of it, imposed upon it by philosophers or the religious. It is hard to adjudicate con cerning which way to go here, and not just for the reason that I lack the space to review the relevant texts and literature. I introduced the distinction between moral phenomena and interpretations of them with the example of the genuine phenomenon of conscience and its theorized underpinning, namely, the "voice of God in man." It is relatively easy to pry these two apart so that we can identify the phenomenon of conscience independently of our commitment of God, but matters become much more complex when we remember that a good deal of Nietzsche's discussion concerns the subtle interplay of behavioral dispositions captured by the types "master," "slave," and "priest" and the changing interpreta tions or Sinne placed upon them. So the neat division between ordinary thought and the "theoretical" is problematic, and of course, one of the aims of GM is to identify some of the different meanings of these types.</page><page sequence="13">N i etzsc heandHume 17 Rather than pursue this issue, we should take note of another. Talk of "morality" is rather a blunt instrument, since for Nietzsche there are many different morali ties, with the most conspicuous difference in moralities being expressed through the division between master and slave. In GM, Nietzsche appears to target a par ticular ascetic morality (which Leiter calls "morality in the pejorative sense"). But if Nietzsche's casting into doubt of morality rested solely on the kind of causal redundancy claim gestured at above, then more would be needed to account for just why ascetic morality is his particular object of concern. Of course, there are many dimensions to Nietzsche's critique, but the one that concerns us is how, if it all, the particular explanation can "call into doubt" what is explained. A number of different answers to this question have been offered, but rather than discussing these I shall sketch an answer that has some affinities with a strategy adopted by Hume in his discussion of religious belief. The aspect of GM with which I am concerned is the emergence of the core commitments of slave morality. The basic outlines are familiar: prior to the slave revolt, the slaves recog nize the rank order of the master pattern of evaluation and their place at the bottom of it. This recognition is accompanied by the reactive attitude ofressentiment in the face of the impossibility of overpowering the masters. Ressentimentbecomes creative in its creation of an "imaginary revenge" (GM 1:10). What are produced are evaluative concepts, embedded evaluative beliefs, which embody an inversion of the noble mode of evaluation. What is important to note is that the psychological process by which this pattern of evaluation emerges must be such as to be insulated from evidence or epistemic reasons that speak either for or against those beliefs. For the beliefs to have the effect of palliating the psychic discomfort generated by ressentiment, the adopters must think of them as reflecting reality (hence the beliefs "falsify" the world [GM 1:10]). However, the processes by which those beliefs emerge are geared to removing the slaves' discomfort: andbelief-fixation to remove discomfort is an epistemically unreliable source of belief because it is not intelligibly connected to the aim of belief, namely, truth. Coming to know that the beliefs have that source "casts doubt" upon them inasmuch as one must recognize that such beliefs now require further justification. This is because their causes are in no way connected with the truth of the belief. This discovery does not show the beliefs to be false, nor does it show that such beliefs cannot be given some further justification: but it does show that the beliefs must be reassessed. Hume deploys a similar strategy in his account of the emergence of religious belief. Religious belief emerges because early human beings are in a state of ignorance regarding the natural world and are wholly dependent on the vicissi tudes of nature for their survival and flourishing. Unable to predict or manipulate nature, early humans are in a perpetual state of anxiety, which in turn triggers and sustains a standing disposition to anthropomorphize nature in the form of polytheism. The belief is fixed, not because of any appreciation of epistemic reasons in its favor but because it relieves the anxiety by yielding a conception of</page><page sequence="14">18 P. J.E.Kail the unknown causes of natural events and, more important, offering a model of how to manipulate them. Again, the belief-forming processes are not something that we can intelligibly see as connected with the truth. In both cases, the beliefs are destabilized by their causal histories. Since the mechanisms that produced them are not connected with the truth, awareness of their origins provides a reason for the thinker to seek grounds for those beliefs. The consequences are different in each case. For Nietzsche, the explanation not merely shows that the ascetic morality is not the only morality possible but also makes appeal to those ascetic values that are problematic inasmuch as those values require some furtherbacking, outside of the morality system, given their origins.31 In that way the "revaluation of values" is facilitated by putting the ascetic morality in the position of having now to defend those values.32 For Hume, the fideist position whereby religious belief does not require reasons in favor of it is shown to be unsustainable. Much more can (and should) be said about this, but it suggests a sense in which an explanation can cast doubt on a class of beliefs by showing the unreliability of the cause of belief and that this strategy is common to Hume and Nietzsche. Conclusion This essay has barely scratched the surface of the parallels between Hume and Nietzsche. I have shown the parallels with respect to their methodological and sub stantive naturalism and tried to deflect an obj ection to their explanatory naturalism based on their skepticism about causation. I have also identified some of the kinds of explanations common to them and their different ramifications. But much more detail is required to make this convincing. So one area for future work is making good the detail of these claims. Among the areas for future discussion are these: 1. What are the naturalistic materials that figure in the explanatory projects of Hume and Nietzsche, and in what sense are they naturalistic? 2. To what extent are any differences in position explicable in terms of differences in these starting points? 3. Given, however, that there is substantial overlap, can we explain why there is such an overlap in terms of shared concerns? 4. What precisely are the relevant explanations, and how plausible are they? 5. What normative consequences do these explanations have, and why? However, there is a great deal more overlap between the two thinkers that requires discussion or elaboration. For example, both Nietzsche's and Hume's accounts of the emergence of religious belief overlap in form and content. Both furthermore see it as having normative import for religious</page><page sequence="15">Nietzsche and Hume 19 belief. This, of course, is a particular instance of the general questions (4) and (5), but it is a particularly interesting topic for the reason that a naturalistic approach to religious belief is coming to the fore in philosophical discussion,33 and the accounts that Nietzsche and Hume offer do not rest essentially on any thing contentious in their philosophies of mind. In both cases, however, the concern with religion is not a theoretical one but, rather, with its import for the ethical conception of humanity. For both thinkers, religion is tangled up with a range of ascetic values that they see as inimical to human flourishing. So another avenue to explore is, 6. TowhatextentdoNietzsche'sandHume'sconceptionsoftherelationbetween religion and ascetic morality overlap? Are the differences a matter of degree, or do they mark a fundamental disagreement between the two thinkers? In what sense do they see asceticism as threatening to human flourishing? And is there any overlap in their conceptions of human flourishing? This shared concern overlaps?somehow?with the method of "genealogy," and I have touched upon that topic in this article. Recently, Bernard Williams's discussion of genealogy has suggested a model that sees some overlap between Nietzsche's and Hume's genealogical explanations of morality, but for reasons I cannot go into here, I doubt that it is the correct one. So we should explore, 7. In what sense might Hume's and Nietzsche's approaches to morality be thought of as "genealogical"? What are the ramifications of this? All of this will require some considerable thought and study. At the very least, I hope I have whetted your appetite.

Davey (1987) compares Hume and Nietzsche on</page><page sequence="16">20 P. J. E. Kail the self. Poellner (1995, 33ff.) discusses Hume and Nietzsche on causation. Christopher Williams (1999, 124) mentions Nietzsche in connection with Hume's critique of asceticism in morality. Swanton compares Humean sympathy with Nietzsche's views on pity in an attempt to show that "Hume has answers to the difficulties Nietzsche poses for the status of compassion or pity as a virtue" (2000, 157). Danford (1990) mentions Nietzsche in connection with Hume but views the former as a "postmodernist." Bernard Williams (2000, 2002) connects Hume and Nietzsche in his discussions of naturalism and genealogy. For a good discussion of Williams that draws on Hume's The Natural History of Religion, see Craig 2007. 3. Kant, Critique of Pure Reason, preface a, ix-x. 4. The issue I have in mind is Bernard Williams's view that genealogy is to be understood as postulating what is essentially a fictional explanation.

Hume of course famously offers "definitions" of "cause," but it is a mistake to view them as semantic reductions (not least because they are neither intentionally nor extensionally equivalent). For a discussion on the nature and role in causal judgment, see Garrett 1997, chap. 5. 12. See The Natural History of Religion (Hume 1993, 134). B.InThayer 1953, 46. 14. Hume 1983, 6:542. 15. Hume 1975, 30. 16. Alternatively, many read Hume as metaphysically reductive of the causal relation: causal relations are just instances of regularities. Note that this position is not a rejection of the cause and effect relation but, rather, a metaphysically austere account of in what that relation consists. Hume, on this reading, is not skeptical about causation but about alternative philosophical accounts of causation. 17. See Clark 1990,103-5; Leiter 2002, 22-23. In a talk given recently at Southampton, Clark had moved away from this reading. 18. See, e.g., Acampora 2006; Hussain 2004; Poellner 1995, 22-24. 19. By "transitional" I mean that Nietzsche in GS is beginning to reject the idea of the thing in-itself but has not seen its implications for the falsification thesis.

Locke is to Hume as Schopenhauer is to Nietzsche inasmuch as it is Locke who claims that we gain our understanding of causation through the activity of the will. Hume objects that no genuine efficacy is revealed: instead, there is an event we identify as a "volition" that is simply followed by movement (see, e.g., the appendix to Hume's Treatise). 26. See Hume's The Natural History of Religion (1993). For discussion, see my 2007b, chap. 1, and my 2007c.</page><page sequence="17">NIETZSCHE AND H?ME 21 27. There is a prior question that Hume, unlike Nietzsche, tries to answer. Given that we have no "sense for the causa efficiens" what is the origin of our conception of efficacy in general? Hume, of course, offers an associational account. Repeated experience of constant conjunctions produces a "determination of the mind" that is then projected onto the world. Nietzsche is skeptical of such explanations. It is "not the great habit of seeing one occurrence following another" that determines our notion of power "but our inability to interpret events otherwise than as events caused by intentions" (WP 550). But this still leaves the question of the prior notion of efficacy unanswered, and it is unclear Nietzsche has any answer. For a more sustained discussion of this issue, see Poellner 1995, 30fif. 28. Stroud 2006, 349. 29. Hume 1975, 269. 30. For a discussion of this passage in connection with the Harman point, see Sinhababu 2007, 273. 31. Cf. D 103. Here Nietzsche writes that it "goes without saying that I do not deny?unless I am a fool?that many actions called immoral ought to be avoided and resisted, or that many called moral ought to be done and encouraged?but I think the one should be encouraged and the other avoided for other reasons than hitherto" (Z) 103; emphasis in original). Presumably there are certain practices that one should follow but are given other interpretations. 32. Cf. Owen 2006; Ridley 2006. 33.1 have in mind Daniel Dennett (2007).
