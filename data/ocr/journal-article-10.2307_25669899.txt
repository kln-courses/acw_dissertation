<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAVID AND MARJORIE HAIGHT Time, Memory, and Self-Remembering i. If there are only nominal classifications and no natural kinds or real essences, what happens to induction which is based upon at least resem blance of instances in the past to instances in the future? Generally speaking, induction fares very poorly indeed in the hands of nominalists, and one wonders if that might not be to their disadvantage. That some leaves are green should be as supportive of the claim, "All crows are black," as the fact that some crows are actually black (Hempel's paradox), or that "grue" emeralds may be green one day and blue the next depending upon our classification system (Goodman's riddle) both attest to the counter intuitive consequences of contemporary nominalism (not to mention Pop per's dismissal of induction as crucial to the scientific enterprise). Insofar as nominalism is correct, there is no need for a justification of induction since induction is either impossible, or if possible at best groundless. This manifests itself in Quine's remark that ostensive learning is "a case of induction . . . a game of chance with loaded dice, "with the loaded dice being "each man's spacing of qualities being enough like his neighbor's," which simply pushes the problem of induction back to the level of sameness of human constitution or behavior, etc.1 The problem of induction then becomes, Where to find the loaded dice if there are any? If there are none, successful inductive generalization is nothing short of "miraculous," a word which Hume in the context of religion denied. How ironic it should be that he opposed miracles in religion on the grounds that they are inconsistent THE JOURNAL OF SPECULATIVE PHILOSOPHY, Vol. Ill, No. 1, 1989. Published by The Pennsylvania State University Press, University Park and London.</page><page sequence="2">2 DAVID AND MARJORIE HAIGHT with the uniformity of nature when he could not find any grounds for such uniformity in his analysis of causality beyond constant conjunction and mental custom. I suspect that Humian habit without grounds is like Quine's "spacing of qualities": both are supposed to be rock-bottom con cepts and therefore explain how there can be community of discourse when in fact they themselves require explanation. If the reply is made that "Grammar tells us the essence of a thing," we should note that this too merely pushes the problem back onto the level of sameness of linguistic circumstances, verbal pronunciation, and general facts such as sameness of human anatomy, gestures, etc., all of which are involved in the learning of the meaning of a word. Identity may well be irreducible to custom, uneven chance, or family-resemblances and life forms, etc., inasmuch as the latter are destined to presuppose identity elsewhere. Nominalists are all alike insofar as they assume what they bring into question. As a result, nominalism commits the fallacy of hysteron proteron?the reversal of the order of explanation?much the same way that the James-Lange theory of the emotions is an illicit inversion in its claim, for example, that we are enjoying ourselves because we laugh, not that we laugh because we are enjoying ourselves.2 II. Not only does nominalism end up begging the question of sameness, but it makes a critical assumption about time which brings time itself into question. The nominalist approach as to whether the future will resemble the past usually assumes that time and memory are discontinuous, which seems inevitably to end up in a solipsism of the present moment. If so, how can there be a "present moment" if there are no other moments? The very concept of the instantaneous presupposes some duration, just as the very concept of a point in space presupposes or treads upon some notion of dimensionality. A "point-instant" is already on its way to becoming a spatio-temporal slice out of a world-line, and as such it can be nothing more than an ideal limit that can only be approached asymptotically. How indeed are we supposed to get a line of time out of a set of discontinuous point-instants? Continua by nature do not admit of absolute minima. No wonder the future cannot resemble the past?there isn't any! If Hume had been consistent in following out the implications of his analysis of sub stance and causality, he would have had to deny, or at least doubt, the existence of time and space, as well.</page><page sequence="3">TIME, MEMORY, SELF-REMEMBERING 3 Since Hume's analytical approach inevitably terminates in an inconclu sive or arbitrary nihilism, our attempt to solve the problem of induction will adopt a different understanding of time-space which is not based upon Hume's principle that whatever can be distinguished is separable. This resolution will not be in the spirit of ordinary language conceptual therapy, which has had a very limited success in resolving the problem. Rather, it has more affinities at least in the beginning with Heidegger's notion of time as "ecstatic," or to use Marcel's term, "participatory," and will eventually illuminate the concepts of Platonic participation and recollection as well. Phenomenologically the resolution in question runs as follows: as I write this line, the initial words are now upast," but they are also present, otherwise this sentence would make no sense since they would be dead and buried?forgotten, as it were. But they are not forgotten, at least not entirely, for if they were, you would not be able to understand this line or any other line of speech. If you do understand them, then the past is present, and therefore not atomistic, but continuous, or rather, participa tory, so that we are not left with solipsism of the present moment. The fact that we are still talking about Hume's analysis of causality today is an ironic testimony to his having had an influence of some kind and therefore constitutes a refutation of his own scepticism. The past participates in the present, and therefore time is ecstatic rather than static. Let us call this perdurance in one dimension of time horizontal participation. Horizontal time is therefore a harmony and tension of opposites, in Heraclitus' sense? the opposites of endurance and perishing which means that the past is present and the present is past. The past, present, and future must all co exist in order for there to be any duration whatsoever. Even the statements "Time is always passing," and 'Time is a perpetual perishing," attest to the perpetuity of something amidst the flux. This resolves the problem of induction insofar as the present is in the future, just as the past is in the present, thereby assuring that the future will resemble the past to that extent. To be sure, if the past is in the present, however belatedly, the present has to resemble the past at least that much, and therefore the future must resemble the present and past as well. Such is the ecstatic unity of the three modes of time. But, it might be objected: this is all based upon memory, and memory is often mistaken; if so, it could be mistaken all the time. Consequently, the proponent of participation is the one who assumes something incorrectly. This qualm about memory, however, is questionable?the phrase "all the time" reveals the contradiction implicit in the statement. The nominalist</page><page sequence="4">4 DAVID AND MARJORIE HAIGHT cannot get around the fact that he must rely upon memory to state his paradoxes and riddles. The sceptic is condemned out of his own mouth if he remembers his objection, which he must in order to pose it. If Hume is right about memory and causality, I should forget what I am going to say from one discrete instant to the next. Memory is the exception, forgetfulness the rule: this is the truth of Hume's philosophical Altzheimer's disease. But Hume's extremism makes memory questionable altogether when in fact forgetfulness is not possible without memory. I can err in memory only if I can also be correct, because even a copy or substitute must be a copy of, or substitute for, something else. The past is no more present as an image or set of images than is the future for the simple reason that an image is not by itself past or future, nor can the image be a copy of the past or future without begging the question as to what it is a copy of, which cannot itself be a further copy. All the problems inherent in a copy theory of perception are relevant to such a theory of memory as well. It must be finally admitted that the past is present not as a representation of itself but as presence. It is not that memory is poor and the self is weak because time "passes," but rather that time "passes" because memory is poor and the self weak. Here I think is the place to turn things on their head, not where Hume does. And nothing follows from the intermittent character of memory of self other than the fact that human consciousness is poised between time and timelessness, having both a trans-temporal identity and a temporal capacity for change and growth. If we are to remain faithful to our experi ence of time and its unity-in-difference we need to avoid extreme scepti cism, or forgetfulness, and extreme mysticism which would equate com plete memory with timelessness in the sense of a static instant. III. In order to show how the three ecstases of time can be unified while preserving the integrity of their differences, we shall use a meta-geometri cal model of a multi-dimensional universe which has an uncanny affinity with the ideas of the philosopher who wrote over the doors of his academy, "Only geometricians need enter here." Let us begin by thinking of a line as the limit of a plane, the former being the cross-section of the latter. The same is true of a plane which would be a slice from a three-dimensional solid. Consequently, we can conceive of a solid as a section of a four-dimensional life-line of that solid. It is as if a solid</page><page sequence="5">TIME, MEMORY, SELF-REMEMBERING 5 is "moving" along the fourth dimension of time when in fact that line of motion is already complete, thereby making time a unity of past, present, and future. The difference between the ecstases is maintained by the fact that the fourth dimension has individuated itself as this one solid. In terms of possible worlds theory: there is indeed this worldline, not any other, though others are possible, just as only one of a great number of cross sections can be taken from a surface, a solid, or a hyper-solid. Platonic Forms might then be understood as higher-dimensional seed like universals that can be individuated by cross-sectioning into many roots without exhaustion, almost like holograms which can repeat themselves infinitely. The inexhaustibility of essences is due to their universality, whereas their definiteness is a function of their individuation. They, too, would be cross-sections of an even higher-dimensional Form of the Good which mathematically divides itself without effort or exhaustion as well. That the future resembles the past is accounted for by the fact that events are united in a higher dimension which identifies what would otherwise appear to be simply a series of constantly conjoined events. To illustrate this in a lower dimension: consider a many-colored striped ball which turns as it passes through a plane surface. There would seem to be a series of colors following one another when in fact after the first rotation it would be clear to a three-dimensional observer that exactly the same colors that appeared before are becoming ingredient in the lower dimension. The same is true of shapes, sizes, tones?common qualities in general: all embody themselves as separate events, but from a higher dimension all these instances are actually collected into one identity. This suggests that a person may have an identity in a higher dimension and not be aware of it in a lower one. As an illustration of this, consider what it would be like to be a point in, but not above, a line: you would not perceive the line itself, only some other points. A being in and not above a surface would not perceive the surface, only some other lines. A being in and not above a solid would not perceive the solid, only some other surfaces. A being in and not above a hyper-solid would perceive only some other solids. And so on. Each time, it is necessary for a being to rise beyond the dimension in order to perceive what it is in; otherwise, it does not perceive it at all. Likewise, we perceive three dimensions because we are already "above" it in the fourth. Here is evidence that there have to be more than three dimensions, or else we would not even know of three. It is question-begging to argue that there can only be three coordinates drawn perpendicular to one another, no more, no less, thus proving space</page><page sequence="6">6 DAVID AND MARJORIE HAIGHT to be three-dimensional, inasmuch as a Flatland philosopher who per ceived only two dimensions would argue that only two such perpendiculars can be drawn. For us to mistakenly identify three-dimensional time with reality would be exactly like a two-dimensional inhabitant who thinks that three-dimensionality is motion, and that the succession of colors appearing in a two-D plane caused by a colored ball passing through it could not possibly exist simultaneously whereas in three dimensions of course they can. A lower-dimensional entity is analogous to the prisoner in Plato's cave who cannot see that the shadows are caused by higher-order beings behind him, and his turning around is analogous to thinking vertically rather than just horizontally about causality. IV. In addition to providing a basis for induction, this multi-dimensional model of the cosmos suggests a way of understanding Platonic "participa tion" and "recollection." In terms of a higher dimension, a lower dimen sion receives its existence by partaking of the higher insofar as the one is imbedded in the other. Each dimension is "hierographic," to invent a word, which is to say that it is a hologram that contains other holograms like the whorls in Er's vision of the star-pole at the end of the Republic. In effect, this makes each lower dimension in the Great Chain of Being a "moving image" of the higher in that the lower is moving while the higher is not. Time is a river without banks. What is fragmented, or divided, in the lower dimension becomes whole, or collected again, in the higher. Time literally becomes the horizon-tal of Being. This is how the future exists now: the vertical participation between dimensions creates the mystery of horizontal participation between past, present, and future, just as the intersection of a higher with a lower dimension produces the mystery of motion. A thing is what it is in a higher dimension, thereby making the concept of nature, or essence, necessarily imply the view that time is many dimensional. This cosmological model also helps to make intelligible the classical conjunction of potentiality and actuality, time and eternity, for time and possibility still exist as that which is and is not?just like the line in a surface, a surface in a solid, and a solid in a tesseract, etc. Here indeed is another meaning of time as a mystery in its quality as the revealing concealing of the dimensions and its paradoxical status as the "moving image of eternity." That each dimension is incommensurable (literally,</page><page sequence="7">TIME, MEMORY, SELF-REMEMBERING 7 lacking a common measure) with every other, while at the same time being recursively related to all of them, saves the appearances of both time and timelessness, particularity and universality, and allows them to exist side by side, so to speak. When seen more adequately, namely, from a higher coordinate system, what seems to be a temporal change from that level is actually a motionless line of the next. In other words, eternity is not the infinite duration of time, but rather a perpendicular to it. Herein lies a meta-solution to Zeno's paradoxes of motion as to how something can both appear to move and remain where it is at the same time. That there is no universal present moment in the neat and tidy division of time into past, present, and future, and that one person's past is another person's present and yet another's future, and that some "intervals" are more inclusive than others are all principles of most interpretations of the theory of relativity. For example, for a far star, "now" could refer to any interval over billions of years, meaning that what takes place in my "now" is but a quick slice out of the time-interval of that distant star. So the space time scale of something will depend upon its speed in relation to light. Time, in other words, can be stretched or shrunk by motion. If anything could surpass the speed of light, it would approach being everywhere and nowhere, like the God of scholasticism which is simultaneous with every event, and which timelessly knows everything which happens. Aquinas's image is that of the center of a circle which is co-present to all the radii that spread out from it. Anselm speaks of this in terms of the "ages of the ages," meaning that the larger interval can be used to date the shorter ones, just as the higher dimension(s) can include the lower one(s) and indeed alter their temporal character so as to make them more "re-collected" as long as the lower participates more and more in the higher. If indeed we are living in a time when everything is being recorded and very little is being remem bered, perhaps it is because we lack this deep recollection, or presence. V. In order to bring these analogies between a multi-dimensional cosmos and modern physics to life, and to show that they might be more than just abstract or fanciful speculation, let us consider them in the light of scien tific studies which indicate that human consciousness is not limited to just one way of perceiving space-time. It has been discovered that not all human beings perceive the third dimension any more than you and I do when we close one eye. African natives, for example, can carve elaborate</page><page sequence="8">8 DAVID AND MARJORIE HAIGHT surfaces but cannot construct boxes to put them into because they have no perception or conception of a further right angle. When asked what he perceived when presented with a solid cube, a South Sea Islander drew a series of squares?the third dimension manifesting itself as a sequence in the second dimension.3 If we look for a correlation between the evolution of consciousness and the history of art, it becomes evident that qualitative leaps occur in an orderly sequence each time the mind takes a right angle or vertical turn from one dimension into another. The artists of Eastern cultures that are most sensitively attuned to the Tao of Nature innocently experience the moment of pure sensation as being framed in two-dimensional flat pictures or still-lifes. In nature time moves so slowly and unintentionally that each Now seems to be suspended from Eternity or infinite Space?like pictures hung in an art gallery against the background of an all-encompassing white wall. Primitive artists express the dynamic world of the hunt by drawing the bodies of animals with their boundaries magically overlapping in the same space. This is analogous to seeing a movie in which two separate perceptual images appear so rapidly that the figures partially merge to produce the illusion of motion or the stroboscopic effect. When the angles of the third dimension are perceived as being organized around a common yet visually displaced center, the sides of all solids can be used to cover, clothe, veil, or hide sacred and precious things that need protection from the hostile or corrupting influences of the profane. Thus one can account for the pre eminence of ancient civilizations in the symbolic or concealing arts of architecture, city planning, military fortification, sculpture, weaving, and pottery. A more sophisticated or intellectually advanced power that sees the third dimension announces itself in Renaissance painting when three dimensional depth or perspective appears along with photographic clarity or realism. During the age of mercantilism the free flow of trade and ideas opened up a multiplicity of intellectual perspectives or speculative horizons which allowed Western culture to transcend the symbolic enclosures of ethnocentrism. This individualistic relativism was then disciplined by the logical abstractions and exact methodology of empirical science, which operated in a three-dimensional homogeneous space emptied out of all intrinsic relational content. The anonymity of modern science gradually transformed Western art into a purely formal representation of abstract relations devoid of personal imagery or anthropomorphic significance. The movement toward increasing objectification was reversed early in</page><page sequence="9">TIME, MEMORY, SELF-REMEMBERING 9 the twentieth century when new developments in quantum physics, non Euclidean geometry, symbolic logic, and existential philosophy paralleled a unique movement in art known as Cubism. The Cubists attempted to show all sides of an object at once, as if the human mind were capable of transcending three-dimensional perspective and sequential analysis in a trans-temporal or fourth-dimensional flash of inspiration, intuition, or insight. Since holistic patterns or paradigms are gathered only by minds with the proper openness, receptivity, or genius, fourth-dimensional sci ence and philosophy eagerly acknowledge the intimate participation which joins knower and known, the circularity or question-begging nature of its methodology, and the paradoxical or even dialectical nature of its conclu sions.4 In the fourth dimension one begs the question and the answer is given. This is why Heidegger can say that thinking is thanking. In the fifth, sixth, and seventh dimensions all knowledge is assimilated through the very subtle values of sound and feeling tone, this awareness being called Vedic cognition in very ancient Indian texts. Whenever humanity collectively evolves to the paradisiacal level of the fifth dimen sion the mind will instantly be able to materialize any desire through the creative potential of sound.5 VI. Since the theory of dimensions establishes a participatory linkage or inti mate bond between the world as it appears to us and our horizontal level or horizon of consciousness, it seems appropriate to pose the question as to why nominalism cannot see the wholeness or trans-temporal identity of things. We believe it cannot see this for the simple reason that identity is not something that is seen but is rather felt. The conclusions of nominalism are counter-intuitive because of its link with scientific positivism and its systematic denigration of human feeling. It is no wonder that no evidence can be found for self-identity, for such intimate feelings have been dis credited from the start. However, we are not claiming that violent or strong emotions, like anger or passion, are evidence for the trans-temporal iden tity of the self, but rather we are alluding to the existence of very subtle, delicate feelings that are normally beyond the threshold of awareness when our attention is captured by the externals of life and superficial distractions. Here we are at the entrance to self-recollection that comes only with a kind of abandonment of the senses and the grosser emotions.6 The fact that Hume and others cannot find any necessary connections or</page><page sequence="10">10 DAVID AND MARJORIE HAIGHT identities in nature or themselves is due to their initial exclusion of human consciouness from the cognitive enterprise. In the absence of the human or divine touch, a nominalistic account of induction at best ends up as a mechanism without a mechanic. A chemist working with three-dimen sional presuppositions will see only an assemblage of materials automat ically or mechanically coming together to induce a certain process, while he naively ignores the fact that he consciously planned the experiment from the start.7 Three-dimensional science must be wary of projecting the more mechanical operations of the human mind into nature while dismiss ing emotive projections as unscientific or anthropomorphic. To under stand the activity of nature as being like that of a factory worker who mechanically performs the same task over and over again without any feeling for his work, or capacity to ask the ontological question, "What is the meaning of all this?" be no less anthropomorphic than the projections of a four-dimensional enthusiast who sees in the movement of atoms not a factory or office drudge but the dancing Wu Li masters. The point is not so much to discredit third-dimensional thought as to recommend the pos sibility that the cosmos may have enough dimensions to answer to all the creative exigencies of human thought.8 Nominalists are all the same in the sense that they abstract from the wholes of experience to a hyper-atomistic way of understanding events, and assume that all of humanity must experience things as they do, when they are in a class by themselves. Hume looked for the self and could not find it because he made it into an atom alongside other atomic ideas. He could not find himself in his mental inventory because the self is not found in higher-dimensional feeling by holding onto boundaries?the trick is to be able to let go of them. An intentional, purposeful looking is counter productive to experiencing depth or identity in the self. Hume's experience confirms what all higher-dimensional philosophies have affirmed when humans look for themselves within boundaries. His disillusionment only begins to express the frustration of trying to find oneself in what one isn't. Why the disappointment if there isn't something else that we are looking for in the wrong place? Who is it that looks for itself? The answer to these questions in terms of a multi-dimensional cosmos makes intelligible the ancient paradox, "Become what you are," insofar as "knowing thyself becomes a matter of recollecting what one already is in higher dimensions.

Marjorie Haight has spent seven years researching the four-dimensional archetypes which destine the twelve stages of cosmic and human evolution. She more fully explains all the archetypes mentioned here as well as some that pertain to the sixth and seventh dimensions in chapter eleven of David Haight's book, the Shadow of God (University Press of America, 1989). The subject matter of each stage being extensive and yet self-contained, the archetypes will eventually appear in a series of twelve books.</page></plain_text>
