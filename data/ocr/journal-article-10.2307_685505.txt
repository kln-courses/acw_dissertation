<plain_text><page sequence="1">MINDLIKE BEHAVIOUR IN ARTEFACTS * I Introduction IN popular usage the term machine has come to stand for something which is essentially servile. The commonly-heard expostulation that 'a machine only does what you tell it to do' thus becomes virtually a tautology. The term artefact in the sense of'artificial construct' has been used in the title of this paper in order to minimise misunder- standing from this cause, for the mechanisms with which we shall be concerned will differ radically from the common notion of a slave- machine. Equally important is the fact that we shall not be concerned with existing digital computing machines. For certain functions the artefacts we consider may make use of digital techniques; but present-day digital computers are deliberately designed to show as few as possible of the more human characteristics. Originality, independence in opinion, and the display of preferences and prejudices are not favoured by the mathematician in his computing tool. The comparison of contemporary calculating machines with human brains appears to have little merit, and has done much to befog the real issue, as to how far an artefact could in principle be made to show behaviour of the type which we normally regard as characteristic of a human mind. Our enquiry might be roughly framed in the form of three questions marking progressive stages : (i) Can an artefact be made to show the behavioural character- istics of an organism ? (ii) How closely in principle could the behaviour of such an artificial organism parallel that of a human mind ? (iii) On what philosophical issues, if any, do these possibilities have a bearing ? 2 Goal-directed activity One of the most distinctive features of an organism is that of goal-directed activity. Associated with this feature are a group of concepts such as purpose, control, and the like, which cease to have * Received 5-iii-5I. 105</page><page sequence="2">D. M. MACKAY meaning in its absence. To avoid committing anthropomorphism- one of the two currently unforgivable sins-we may define the statement 'A seeks the goal X' as follows : Let the current state ofA (plus its environment) be defined as Y. Let X define that state of A-plus-environment which we term the goal of A. Then the statement above implies that the activity of A in a defined group of circumstances is such as inter alia to mini- mise the discrepancy between X and Y. In a still more formal sense we may consider the two states X and Y to be representable by two points X and Y in an abstract space, the coordinates of each point being given by some set of parameters defining the corresponding state. We may then say that A functions in such a way as to minimise the interval XY, or some time-average of the magnitude of this interval. The situation may then be depicted in the manner of Fig. I, which indicates the essential requirements for such goal-directed activity to be possible. i ,IG I, . F--.I FIG. I. (i) There must be an effector (I) capable of altering the state Y. This perhaps would qualify for the title of'machine' in the usual sense. (ii) The activity of this effector must be controllable by an ele- ment (2) capable of receiving information. (iii) Information as to the magnitude of XY must be fed back from the field of activity to the controlling element (2), there to give rise (after analysis) to activity in (I) leading to the minimisa- tion of some measure of XY. There are many familiar examples of devices satisfying these re- quirements, ranging in complexity from the simple thermostat, in which the effector is a heating unit and the space of XY is a one- dimensional scale of temperature, to the self-directing missiles and automatic processing plants with multi-dimensional fields of activity which are now emerging from the blue-print stage. They are all characterised by the circulation of information indicated in Fig. I,-by Io6</page><page sequence="3">MINDLIKE BEHAVIOUR IN ARTEFACTS the presence, in other words, of feedback. Perhaps the simplest form of control is one in which the frequency or intensity of activity is proportional to the discrepancy XY. This evidently has a state of equilibrium only when the discrepancy is zero. (Such 'error- operated' fedback systems may, however, easily become unstable in the presence of delays or inertia in the information loop, so that the control element (2) must normally include quite complex computing operators if the information is to be used to optimum effect.) The impression seems to be current that fedback systems form a class by themselves, subject to different laws from those of'straight' systems. It is perhaps worth pointing out here that from the physical standpoint a fedback system is only a particular case of the general non-fedback type. If an input x to the control point of a normal mechanism causes an output y which is some function F(x), then the introduction of feedback amounts to setting x equal to some function G(y). The problem set by the system is thus the solution of the normal equation z = G(F(x)) for the special case wherein z = x. No exemption from ordinary laws accrues. The features of interest in its behaviour arise from the limitations on its behaviour-pattern set by this equation. The systems we have considered can evidently be thought of from another standpoint. If we focus attention on the transformations of information which are usually necessary in (2), we can think of the latter as a type of computer, which makes logical deductions from data acquired from a field which is affected by the results of the deduc- tions. This leads us to ask what types of field are open to the activity of such an artefact. Among the most interesting are the following: (a) The field of physical variables outside the artefact. This we have already considered in the examples above. (b) More interesting, the field of physical variables widened to include the artefact itself In a primitive sense, an artefact capable of receiving and acting on information about the state of its own body can begin to parallel many of the modes of activity we associate with self-consciousness. At a lower but equally important level, as Ashby's 'Homeostat ' 1 illustrates, it can adjust its internal modes of functioning so as to become in principle self-repairing. (c) The field of mathematical and other logical propositions. The interest of this field from our viewpoint lies in the possibility of 1 W. R. Ashby, Electron. Eng., 1948, 20zo, 379 Io7</page><page sequence="4">D. M. MACKAY generating continuous and significant trains of reasoning, not depen- dent on the continuous supply of information by an operator. To a limited extent this mode of operation is realised in present-day com- puting machines; and the well-known discipline of Boolean algebra enables logical deduction also to be arithmetised for treatment, by the same method as numbers on the scale of (2). (d) In any or all the above, a field including a human interlocutor. This is perhaps of greatest interest. An artefact can for example be designed to play a game of chess with a reasonable frequency of success against a human opponent.1 In principle such an artefact may truly be said to engage in logical dialogue, and no barrier of principle prevents the field of dialogue from covering topics other than chess. But we may cut short the enumeration of these possibilities, for they have already received much publicity. Among the more im- portant functions of which we shall hereafter assume an artefact to be capable, we may list the following in summary : (a) Receiving, selecting, storing, and sending information. (b) Reacting to changes in its 'universe,' including messages and data on its own state. (c) Reasoning deductively from prenmisses which can include the results of previous deductions and data on the relative success of different courses. (d) Observing and controlling its own activity, whether symbolic or otherwise, so as to further some goal. This may be only a very general objective, such as the maxinmisation of efficiency in some defined sense, or the attainment of equilibrium, leaving a wide scope for the development of subsidiary 'purposes' ad hoc by the artefact as the result of its experience. (e) Changing its own pattern of behaviour as a result of experience so as to develop quite complex and superficially unpredictable char- acteristics capable of rational description in purposive terms. The above enumeration has not been made in the belief that these possibilities are philosophically significant, except in so far as they remove confusion due to insufficient thought. For they are merely consequences of a principle which is generally accepted : any pattern of observable behaviour which can be specified in terms of unique and precisely-definable reactions to precisely-definable situations can in principle be imitated mechanically. (As a last resort, the 1 C. E. Shannon, Phil. Mag., 195o, 41, 256 Io8</page><page sequence="5">MINDLIKE BEHAVIOUR IN ARTEFACTS decomposition of the specification in terms of Boolean algebra can always in principle lead to a description of a relay system which satisfies it.) It is suggested in other words that no new philosophical issues are raised by the possibilities so far considered. These artefacts are merely deterministic performers of functions which we ourselves would describe as 'mechanical' were we to carry them out. There seems no reason to deny, however, that in principle such artefacts could merit the title of organisms. 3 A probabilistic reasoning-mechanism The type of artefact that we have just considered would meet many of the classical tests for mindlike behaviour. We have still, however, to meet the question implicit in our first paragraphs : Is it possible for an artefact to show originality, independence of opinion, and, for example, such illogical human characteristics as prejudice, and preference ? Or can we find analogues of such impalpable processes as the weighing of evidence ? In short, how closely in principle could the behaviour of an artefact parallel that of the human mind ? To answer this question we shall consider a rather different type of artefact, which is perhaps most easily introduced as a development of the first. We have been making an implicit assumption that all the data used are exact, and lead to deductions which are unique and certain. This follows from our assumption that decomposition into elementary 'yes-or-no' propositions is possible without distortion. But in human intercourse this is seldom the case. Data are only moderately certain, and the closest attainable approach to a unique conclusion is often an estimate of the relative probabilities of several. It appears likely that an artefact to imitate the more human thought- processes, should operate on a much less deterministic and inflexible basis. What is required in fact is a means of introducing the concept of partial truth or probability. This is a twofold problem. First, we require means of handling, combining and computing probabilities--in effect, of making statistical analyses. Secondly, we should evidently design our artefact so that its actions based on such probabilistic data can parallel those of a rational mind in the same circumstances. This implies that the statistical structure of its behaviour pattern shall be that logically justified by the statistics of the data if it is to be described as reasonable and 0og</page><page sequence="6">D. M. MACKAY unprejudiced. It is possible to envisage a very simple mechanism which can meet these requirements admirably, and incidentally has a well-known neurological parallel. It is the mechanism of threshold control. Consider an element which changes from one to another of two states when a controlling input exceeds a certain threshold level. If the magnitude of signal and threshold are precisely specified, the consequent state of the element is uniquely determined (excluding the infinitely improbable case where the magnitudes are exactly equal). But if now we introduce an element of randomness -which is inevit- able in any real case-we shall only be able to say that the probability of change of state is some known function of the signal and threshold magnitudes. For example, we might use electronically generated random noise-signals to perturb the threshold level, in such a way that the individual actions of the element would become unpredictable in principle. At the same time its statistical behaviour pattern would reflect quite precisely the information-content of the threshold: signal configuration. In short, such an element would behave as if uncertain of the truth of the proposition represented by the stimulating signal. It is not of course necessary to adhere literally to the notion of a determined threshold randomly perturbed. Any fmunctional per- turbation which can give meaning to the notion of control of transition- probability is sufficient to provide the kind of statistically-sensitive element we require. In an artefact constructed on this new principle, information would be represented not only by the current excitation- patterns, but also by the changing probabilities of excitation. In fact it could be thought of as two interlocked computing networks, one representing and handling information in the form of discrete symbols, the other handling information relative to the probabilities to be associated with them.' At the risk of oversimplification, we might clarify the picture by describing our earlier reasoning-mechanism as a switchboard with rigidly-interlocked levers. We have now moved from this notion to the notion of a switchboard in interaction with an analogical net- work controlling the probabilities of throwing the switches. 1 This complementary relationship is closely analogous to that between structural and metrical information in the formalism of information theory (D. M. MacKay, Phil. Mag., I95o, 41, 289), which in fact was the stimulus leading to the ideas now presented. The connection will not be developed here, though it may be remarked that the representation of meaning by the orientation of an information vector suggests a direct interpretation of the concept in terms of the functioning of a statistical mechanism of this kind. IIO</page><page sequence="7">MINDLIKE BEHAVIOUR IN ARTEFACTS We have in fact passed by easy stages to a new concept of a reason- ing mechanism, in which the control of transition probabilities plays a dominant rble. ' Thinking' in such a mechanism becomes a stochas- tic process, proceeding along paths determined only statistically. Guiding the statistical process is the network which computes and governs transition-probabilities, which may in many cases be more important than the excitation-pattern. It is natural to ask what it is which prevents such activity from becoming nonsensical. In the first place, it must be remembered that only an increase in threshold is necessary to make the mechanism operate on the simple digital principle. It is thus capable of all the activities of the digital artefact considered earlier. Lowering of threshold need take place only where statistical 'thinking' is appro- priate. But in the second place, the activity is always distinguished from nonsense by its statistical pattern-by the effects of the guiding transition-probabilities at each point of divergence. Individually its actions may be unpredictable; statistically (or collectively) they make sense. The behaviour pattern of a human being in many respects provides a parallel here; and there is no reason in principle why precisely the same degree of reasonableness should not be attained by the artefact, since its upper bound of performance is the perfection of rigid logic. It is not difficult to see how such a flexible mechanism can manifest most of the 'typically human' characteristics. Continuously- variable (and irregularly excitable) prejudices, preferences, and other 'emotional' effects can obviously be shown if transition-probabilities are linked appropriately to the 'causes' of the prejudices. Weighing of evidence can be represented by subliminal manipulation of prob- ability-amplitudes. Originality of a kind can be constantly in evidence because of the lack of a deterministic link between input and output; and on those occasions when a random excitation-pattern finds itself in logical equilibrium with the current data-pattern, quite significant contributions could be made to a train of thought, with full claim to be called original.1 Learning in such artefact could take place in more than one way. Discrete representations similar to those used in digital computers could of course be used. But the most natural process would be one in which the frequency of past success or failure of a given action determined the transition-probability to that action 1 Normally, of course, the life of a sequence uncorrelated with the main stream of thought would be short, because of the improbability of the necessary transitions. III</page><page sequence="8">D. M. MACKAY in future. Such a self-guiding learning mechanism has been built by the author. It is readily envisaged both in electronic and physio- logical terms, and has the advantage that stored information is im- mediately available at the relevant point. It seems increasingly likely, in view of physiological evidence, that the human brain also may retain much of its information in this form rather than in localised 'stores.' In comparing the possibilities of such an artefact with the performance of a human mind, it is important to remember the part played in the development of the human mind by intercourse with other human beings. We must be prepared to imagine as much care and attention to be spent on the ' education' of our artefact as on that of a child. If we do so, it is difficult to deny that such an artefact could be made to develop statistically consistent modes of behaviour which in a human being we should describe as constituting a person- ality. Our conclusion in fact may reasonably be expressed in a general- isation of our previous axiom, as follows : ' Any pattern of observable behaviour which can be defined statistically, in terms of probable reactions to given situations, can in principle be shown by an artefact.' The implications of this conclusion are of greater interest. 4 Abstraction It is not the purpose of this paper to enter into technical details of artificial mechanisms. The foregoing sketch has sought only to establish the width of the class of functions which can be realised in an artefact, so as to place the later discussion in proper perspective. There is, however, one central problem which deserves closer con- sideration because of its connection with longstanding philosophical issues. It is the problem of abstraction-the recognition of pattern or Gestalt. Related to it is the question whether an artefact could with reasonable frequency generate significant hypotheses. We have indeed begged a thorny question in assuming implicitly that all incoming data were intelligible to our artefact. How is it possible to ensure that the significant invariant of a pattern of data is selected for propositional representation ? Given a situation in which recognition of triangularity is required-to take a stock example-how can we ensure that the response of the artefact could remain invariant with respect to changes in size, shape and orientation of a triangle ? It is a fact which may perhaps be thought surprising, that contem- porary artefacts can much more readily be made to perform elaborate 112</page><page sequence="9">MINDLIKE BEHAVIOUR IN ARTEFACTS calculations that would strain a human brain to the linmit, than simple feats of recognition which children or some lower animals perform instinctively. Two fundamentally distinct approaches to this problem are pos- sible. The first may be called the passive or template-fitting method, which has been described by McCulloch 1 and Wiener2 among others. A typical sample of the pattern to be recognised is stored in the artefact as a kind of template. Incoming signals are now subjected to a syste- matic series of transformations inverse to those under which the pattern is invariant. If the artefact is to recognise a triangle irrespective of its size, shape or orientation, it must change all three aspects of the incom- ing signal systematically until it matches the stored sample-signal- the 'ideal triangle '-representing the concept 'triangularity.' At this stage the artefact can adopt a course of action indicative of its recognition that the pattern is triangular. Such an artefact recognises in the act of reception-hence our use of the term' passive' to describe the mechanism, which acts essentially as a filter. Some features of the structure of the visual cortex have been adduced as evidence in support of the hypothesis that cerebral pattern-perception functions in the same manner,3 but the idea does not appear to have found universal favour; and for our purpose it is possible to envisage a mechanism on a different principle, which is not open to the same objections. By way of introduction to this second notion, let us first consider the way in which a blindfold man might seek to recognise a solid triangular figure, by moving his finger around the outline.4 He requires essentially to perform two kinds of motion-recti- linear movement, and sudden changes of direction. As his finger moves round the outline, he finds it necessary to issue to them just two types of order, in a characteristic sequence. This sequence is in prin- ciple invariant with respect to the size, shape or orientation of the 1 W S. McCulloch and W. Pitts, (I) Bull. Math.

Biophys., 1947, 9, 134-36 4 The usefulness of defining the form of a geometrical figure by its 'natural equation' (i.e. the equation specifying curvature as a function of distance along the periphery) has been noticed independently by a number of workers. Some develop- ment of the idea has been found in the writings of Craik (K. G. W. Craik, The Nature of Explanation, Cambridge, 1943) ; and Dr. O. Straus of Massachusetts Institute of Technology in a personal communication (2s/i/sI) has described a method of identifying curvilinear figures on this principle by computing their natural equation. 113</page><page sequence="10">D. M. MACKAY triangle. To the blindfold man, the concept of triangularity is in- variably related with and can be defined by the sequence of element- ary responses necessary in the act of replicating the outline of the triangle. Let us generalise this approach to the problem of recognition, and consider now an artefact whose response to incoming stimuli of any kind is an act of replication, in some formal sense, of the stimuli received. In other words, disequilibrium signals are generated in the artefact and cause activity therein until there is a sufficient degree of resemblance between a synthetic replica and the incoming pattern. This situation is simply a particular case of the general scheme of Fig. I, wherein X and Y would now represent the incoming and imitative patterns respectively. At this point we introduce a crucial feature. We suppose that our artefact possesses at any time a finite number of standard methods of replication-a finite number of commands and command-sequences to the replicating effectors. Evidently then, if recognition is a function of the act of replication, the total of recognised experience for the artefact is describable and identifiable in terms of this one set of commands. The elementary acts of replication define the basic vocab- ulary in terms of which the artefact describes its own experience. The term 'experience' though anthropomorphic appears to have justifiable metaphorical use here, since it refers to that fraction of the total of received stimuli which has evoked the analogue of conscious awareness in the artefact-the fraction with which subsequent be- haviour may show correlation. Evidently the problem ofrecognising complex patterns now reduces to the problem of learning to make complex (formal) replicas, which is of the same class as other problems of coordination such as learning to walk or write. And since our artefact uses as its elementary sym- bols the elementary acts of replication, no problems of identification arise. Complex concepts are represented by complexes of symbolic (internal) acts of representation.' The significance or meaning of any concept to the artefact, is described in its language by the same complex of responses as that which makes up its name. This intro- duces a vast simplification into the kind of learning-mechanism which 1 It should be clear that the input dealt with by the replicatory mechanism is generally in quite a different physical form from the original input to the sensory receptors. An olfactory stimulus for example might be mapped electrically, and would not have to be replicated by generating odours ! II4</page><page sequence="11">MINDLIKE BEHAVIOUR IN ARTEFACTS we may envisage. Transition-probabilities now require to be estab- lished, not between a stimulus and an action via an identification- link, but between one action and another-between the act of replica- tion constituting recognition and the learned response which should follow recognition. In the above discussion we have incurred two debts. We have onmitted all mention of the statistical aspects of recognition; and we have tacitly assumed that our artefact has been taught to make the standard sets of responses which symbolise the universals of its world. It is almost time to leave technical discussion for more philosophical stock-taking, but a very brief indication of solvency may be given. The first debt is readily discharged. All that has been said earlier about statistical thought-sequences can apply equally to the process of recognition. Replication is, of course, never perfect. A practical recognitive artefact need only have a finite resolving-power in its comparator, and could use parallel-operation to enable it to choose what it estimates to be the most probable replicatory command-sequence to 'describe' a given pattern. This has important implications for the concept of meaning. Evidently the meaning of a symbol can here be something more general than the specification ofa unique combina- tion of 'eigensymbols.' To our probabilistic artefact, a symbol means a probability-distribution over the set of eigensymbols ; the selective ocperation performed by the symbol is a statistical one and may perhaps be validly followed by any one of several different responses. It may equally be impossible to give a unique verbal definition even in terms of responses, of some concepts appearing in the thought-process of the artefact, since these may be defined only in terms of the statistical conjunction of several responses. Our second debt is a more important one. Could an artefact discover and recognise new invariants independently of prior instruction ? Again a statistical mechanism makes it easy to envisage such a process. The only pre-requisite is a sufficiently frequent re- currence of the invariant in the patterns which are replicated. For in the absence of a' recognised' pattern, the artefact could be made to try automatically in random fashion, various sequences of replicatory orders. The relative success of each could be caused to influence the probability of future trial. Thus if one of these happens to correspond to a recurrent pattern, it will rapidly grow in statistical status. If the recurrence of the response-pattern is persistent enough for it to become IIS5</page><page sequence="12">D. M. MACKAY associated with actions, the pattern enters the vocabulary of the arte- fact as a new 'universal.' In a final word we might examine the relation of this last mechan- ismn to the making of hypotheses. A hypothesis in this context is a symbolisation not evoked as a direct replica of received stimuli. It is essentially a response-train prepared in advance of an expected pattern of stimuli. The simplest hypothesis-that past experience will recur-is thus made automatically by our artefact. But in the face of contradictory subsequent experience, it can be designed to adopt procedure identical in principle with the exploratory speculation which forms at least a large component of what we understand by making hypotheses. And because the transition-probabilities can be made to change automatically in accordance with the results of trials, there is no obvious reason in principle why the process should not converge as frequently and as fruitfully as in human speculative thought. In- deed it is a tenable hypothesis that the human cerebral mechanism may operate in just such a manner. We may generalise our concept in a further step. One way in which our artefact could respond, is to alter the order-pattern (or the relative probabilities of orders) in a standard group of orders. This is an important form of response, for it corresponds to the making of an abstract hypothesis-an hypothesis concerning an abstraction, as distinct from one concerning a pattern of stimuli. In other words, the response of an artefact may be to alter the mechanism controlling response. This is equivalent to recognising the pattern formed by the response-orders. Here we have the first step in a hierarchy of abstrac- tion, in which the patterns formed by the responses of each level be- come the subject matter of the response-vocabulary of the next higher. This possibility may repay more detailed study on another occasion. In summary we may note some of the more important features of the type of artefact we have been developing. (a) We take for granted the ability to parallel the more mechanical aspects of human behaviour discussed in earlier sections. (b) The distinction between reception and perception is fundamental to its operation, the latter being characterised by the element of response. (c) The points (or regions) of conscious attention in a field of re- ceived data have their analogues in the regions under active replication. II6</page><page sequence="13">MINDLIKE BEHAVIOUR IN ARTEFACTS (d) Many fanmiliar psychological phenomena, such as optical illusions, find direct analogues in the normal functioning of the replicatory mechanism. (e) The basic symbols of the vocabulary of the artefact are the elementary acts of response. (f) The universals of its field of discourse are those sequences of responses which have found repeated application. (g) Such an artefact is automatically adapted to concentrate on the changing features of its environment, since it is these which require the issue of new commands to the replicatory mechan- ism; and by (e) above this automatically amounts to naming the new features. (h) It is possible to find an analogue for the activity of making hypotheses, which seems hard to distinguish in principle from the human parallel. (i) The element of indeterminacy in the modus operandi is funda- mental to its proper function in a statistically-fluctuating uni- verse. 5 Philosophical Stock-taking On what philosophical issues do these possibilities have a bearing ? A systematic study of their implications would be lengthy; but they appear to illuminate a number of concepts from a new angle. The interesting aspects of the behaviour of our artefact arise prin- cipally from the combination of two features-its goal-directed activity and its 'reasonable indeterminacy.' It has already been suggested that the first of these raises no new philosophical issue. It does, however, have some purgative influence on our thinking about the concept of mind. Mindlike behaviour is here conditional on the circulation of information in the sense of Section 2, for the concepts of mindlike behaviour are defined only for closed-loop circulatory systems. It now becomes easy to see the fallacy inherent equally in the analytical approach of the classical mechanist and in the Cartesian compromise. To claim that analysis of the nervous system into parts reveals 'no sign of the soul' is as indicative of a false approach as to suggest that any one organ might be the seat thereof. In terms of the information-diagram, the position is directly analogous to that of a man seeking the ' residence of triangularity' among the individual dots of a triangular dot-pattern. We have in fact an ideal example of the destructive effect of H 117</page><page sequence="14">D. M. MACKAY abstracting a system from its environment, when the concepts of interest are essentially properties of the system-plus-environment. A more subtle fallacy, however, lies in wait. The temptation is now to say that the mindlike features are 'nothing but' abstractions from the physical description. The question-begging phrase' nothing but' appears to have no justification. The concepts relating to mind- like behaviour form a different logical group from those which appear in the analysis of elements of the artefact, so that it is true that the corresponding descriptions may be logically immiscible for some purposes of deduction. But for our recognitive artefact at least, the abstractions have as much logical respectability as the data in which they are recognised, since all are exemplified by replication-operations of one kind or another. All, in short, have operational status, at one level or another. The false dualism which used to be expressed in the question ' how can matter produce mind' would now seem to have its origin in a genuine dualism of conceptual frames of reference, defined respectively for the viewpoint of actor and spectator. The situation is not a sym- metrical one, but the concept of complementarity whose value we have been led to recognise in physics appears to have an analogue here that would repay development. The dualism of wave and particle in physics is resolved neither by arbitrary denials of'reality' nor by 'explanations' of one as 'nothing but' an aspect of the other. The process of description is seen as a selective or projective operation; and it is not so much the validity but the appropriateness of a descrip- tion which requires to be discussed in any given situation. Paradoxes arise when concepts defined for one logical background are mixed carelessly with those defined for another. Descriptions in terms only of one group or the other may both be valid. It is not the descriptions which are exclusive, but the logical backgrounds in terms of which they have meaning. The moral is obvious, and seems to admit of large-scale transfer to other fields of thought. The artefact is also of interest in providing a direct analogue of the concept of consciousness. Consciousness, behaviourally speaking, is represented as we have seen by the region of the field of data evoking active response by (formal) replication. Self-consciousness appears to be shown if the field of replication includes a representation of the artefact itself, which of course introduces no special difficulty. The same situa- tion could automatically ensure that the artefact would act as if aware that external events were located in a world external to its own body. II8</page><page sequence="15">MINDLIKE BEHAVIOUR IN ARTEFACTS The application of a similar interpretation to the concept of human consciousness is of course purely hypothetical, but the parallel is at least suggestive. It would imply, if valid, that 'I' am the totality of currently reacting elements of my body, which are organised in ternis of information-linkages so as to constitute an organism. The continuity which we predicate of our perceived experience despite the discontinuities of our received data, would find its origin in the persistency of the command-pattern by which experience is symboli- cally replicated and ipsofacto perceived and described. Concepts such as responsibility are group-concepts defined for the totality, and define a valid calculus of behaviour at the level and in the language of conscious activity. Along such lines it seems possible that a consistent probabil- istic theory of personality might be developed which could find a com- plementary place for some of the psychological dicta currently debated as antagonistic, particularly in relation to pathological conditions. Another concept which now appears in a new light is the notion of randomness. Information theory enables us to give precise sig- nificance to a definition of randomness as' lack ofinformation-content.' In particular, a completely random sequence to a given receiver is defin- able as one which exercises no selective operation on the information- space of the receiver. (Absolute randomness has probably as little meaning as other notions defined by prefixing the word 'absolute' to operationally defined concepts.) We are accustomed to think of completely random activity as meaningless and dull. But our artefact shows randomness in the domain which in a human being is that offree will; and behaviourally there is no reason in principle why the two should be distinguishable. All systematic components of human behaviour-patterns can in prin- ciple be simulated. What remains is by definition devoid of syste- matic content for the observer, i.e. it exercises no selective action on the information-space of the observer. Equally by definition, it must then be classified as the' completely random component' of the human behaviour patternfrom the observer's point of view. Yet in the context of the systematic component it admits of a reasonable interpretation as the exercise of free choice; and by the actor himself the calculus of responsibility is normally acknowledged to be directly applicable to it as such. The point cannot be pressed in detail here, but it may bear further consideration, since we are so often inclined to use' mere randomness ' as a term of dismissal or almost of explanation. 119</page><page sequence="16">D. M. MACKAY The connection between the apparent free will of our artefact and the determinate components of its behaviour-pattern inevitably suggests an analogy with the hoary problem of human free will. This is usually epitomised in the question, 'Is human free will genuine?' The question in this form is imprecise, but the parallel may be illumin- ating. The choices of a free man are seldom devoid of a statistically- predictable component; someone who knows him well can usually score a significant frequency of success in predicting his choices, though it is most unlikely that they form a stationary time-series. In the same way the choices of the artefact, given a knowledge of the various threshold levels defining transition-probabilities, are statistically pre- dictable on a short term basis. The suggestion is that the choices of a free man may likewise be governed by statistical distribution-functions which have a physiological representation and are in principle deter- minate ; but that individual choices can be unpredictable in principle, and it is probable that the distribution-functions are indeterminable in practice. To complete a sketchy stock-taking, it is suggested that these de- velopments raise no new theological issues. This is, of course, a personal view ; but the so-called' theological objection' against which Turing tilts in a recent paper appears to be a windmill without an owner among reputable contemporary theologians. Doubtless a full realisa- tion of foregoing implications will have a purgative action on un- warranted speculative accretions in theology, but the central concern of Christian theology at least is framed in terms of the calculus of re- sponsibility, whose categories in the author's view are unaffected by changes in the complementary categories of physical process used to describe brain function. No reputable theologian expects to find physical laws disobeyed in the human brain; and it is difficult to see how elucidation of the particular physical processes which happen to be used can in any way be relevant to the claims (whether admitted or not) which are made by Christianity on the personality whose thought is mediated by those processes. 6 Conclusions Our principal conclusion is that we have failed to find any dis- tinction in principle between the observable behaviour of a human brain and the behaviour possible in a suitably designed artefact. We 1 A. M. Turing, Mind, 1950, 59, 433 120</page><page sequence="17">MINDLIKE BEHAVIOUR IN ARTEFACTS would do well, however, to retain a sense of proportion; the human central nervous system is estimated to comprise some Ioo elements, each of considerable complexity. It is unnecessary to point out the practical difficulties of constructing, supplying and maintaining an artefact of comparable complexity, and the possibility need not be taken seriously. At the same time it must be realised that a much smaller number of elements would provide a complexity of behaviour comparable in most respects with that of human beings, so that no deductions in either direction need be made dogmatically at this stage. We have seen that the designing of an artefact on statistical prin- ciples, using a combination of quantal and continuous processes, en- ables its statistical behaviour-pattern to be intelligible despite a controll- able measure of freedom in individual choices. In such an artefact analogues of concepts such as emotion, judgment, originality, con- sciousness, and self-consciousness appear. It is capable of performing abstractions, and generating significant hypotheses with reasonable frequency-including hypotheses about its own mechanism for generating hypotheses. Quite unintentionally, this paper appears to have provided an answer to some strictures of Professor Popper on the capabilities of ' machines.' 1 Professor Popper's emphasis on the limitations of Science (with a capital S) and on the dignity of human personality, we should warmly endorse. His remarks that 'calculators' can have only 'senseless powers of producing truths,' and 'possess no method of picking out the interesting or important ones' are certainly true of contemporary computers, for good reasons. But when he says that ' It is only the human brain which can create interests, purposes, prob- lems and ends '-then in face of the foregoing possibilities, he appears to shoulder a considerable onus probandi for no very clear reason. This said, we might perhaps go even further than Professor Popper in insisting that the elucidation of the actual mechanisms mediating human thought, or the development of artificial organisms capable of a comparable function, affects neither the status of man's thought nor the extent to which he is answerable for the choices made on the level of moral and spiritual responsibility.
