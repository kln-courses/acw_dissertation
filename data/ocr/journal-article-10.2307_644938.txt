<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Sinhala Village in a Time of Trouble: Politics and Change in Rural Sri Lanka. JONATHAN SPENCER. Oxford University South Asian Studies Series. Delhi and Bombay: Oxford Uni- versity Press, 1990. xv + 285 pp., maps, ta- bles, appendixes, notes, glossary, bibliog- raphy, index. BRUCE KAPFERER University College, London In the fashion of much contemporary anthropo- logical writing, this study is as much focused on the author of the account as upon the people who af- ford its raison d'etre. The description unravels as a personal discovery. Ingenuously, Spencer initially appears as the proverbial "innocent abroad," con- vinced of the bucolic and harmonious world of vil- lager self-presentation. As we would expect in any melodrama (an early chapter begins with thumbnail sketches of the village actors), the plot thickens. All is not what it seems. The village is not "traditional" but filled with recent immigrants. Village rites of community solidarity give way to political rites of dissension. Spencer elaborates on cultural practices which veil from his Outsider a darker world of jeal- ousy and violence. As Spencer puts it, "I had lost my ethnographic innocence" (p. 83). Such is the central descriptive theme of the book, which is also not what it seems. It is an attack on an outdated ro- mantic and ahistorical anthropology, the like of which has probably not been taken seriously since Lewis' devastating critique of Redfield and, cer- tainly, in British anthropology, since the criticism in the 1950s by the "Manchester School" of the work of Malinowski and his successors at the London School of Economics and Cambridge. The best chapters are possibly "Work and Differ- ence," an account of 150 years of economic change in the village, "Politics as a Consuming Pas- sion," where Spencer discusses the extension of the power of the contemporary State into the village and the everyday cultural rhetoric of politics. The description is backed by much chit-chat and per- sonal reminiscence but achieves its critical strength largely through a discussion of the work of other scholars. These (Leach, Yalman, Obeyesekere, Tambiah, Robinson, Brow, Moore, and the like) have recorded in great detail their observations, something Spencer never does. Tenna appears very indefinitely as a series of discordant images, which the author regards as a virtue. Spencer warns, "we should beware of attributing too great an impor- tance to something just because we happen to have relatively detailed evidence on it" (p. 107). Yes, but more detailed accounts of what is deemed as im- portant would be valuable. As presented, Tenna cannot be a basis for the research of future scholars and employed substantively, as Spencer uses the studies of those he criticizes. Many of the arguments appear to be ill-con- ceived, misplaced, or marginal to the ethnography. Tenna is often presented as a clearly bounded so- cial entity, continuous through time as its nature changes in history. But from diverse perspectives, historically and sociologically, Tenna is very differ- ent things. It might have been more satisfactory to have treated Tenna as a locale within a diverse and dynamic social and political field. The problem of many studies of "change," especially those of the 1960s with which this study is cognate, is that they imply a notion of statics as their counterpoint. Spen- cer is caught in the same contradiction and erects the same straw persons. He discusses aspects of class and caste, finding the continuity of caste dif- ficult to understand (p. 187). In Sri Lanka what may be "objectively" distinguished as class or caste (by locals or visiting anthropologists alike) is inter- twined in everyday practice: class, for example, finding some of its force in the expression of caste and vice versa. Spencer cites Hocart indicating that his argument is no longer relevant. Yet Hocart re- alized the subordination and structuring of caste- based relations to political force. This general ob- servation may still apply (that is, caste as both con- stituting an organization of power and being repro- duced in the movement of power relations). King- ship has long gone, but as Spencer notes the sym- bolism of kingship continues in everyday ritual. The continuity of such symbolism in ritual and, indeed, in the ideological rhetoric of politics, does not in- dicate the persistence of ancient structures but, rather, kingship, in the sense of Ricoeur, as a sym- bol which points beyond itself to the centrality of power in the contemporary world. The force of caste (the variety of its manifestation) in modern Sri Lanka has much to do with historical processes in- volving the structuring and restructuring of the cen- tral institutions of power which the idea of kingship continues to symbolize. The agents of the state (no less than the president himself) continue to engage it even though the circumstances of their power are very different from that of the ancient or medieval kingship to which the modern usage of the symbol often refers. However, the general point is that caste as a contemporary phenomenon is to be under- stood in the context of its role in contemporary po- litical and economic processes. I link the continu- ing importance of caste to class forces which, ob- viously, are inextricably part of the contemporary dynamics of power in Sri Lanka. Caste is a very modern phenomenon, and Spencer's lack of grasp results from simultaneously reducing it to ideologi- cal terms based in the past and failing to attend to the structure of contemporary practice in which it is sustained as relevant. "Protestant Buddhism" is a concept Spencer uses to gloss contemporary patterns of Buddhist practice strongly affected by colonialist influences and the inroads of capitalist consumerism. For all the efforts that some present-day Sinhala Buddhists make to get the original teachings of the Buddha right, the diversity, exhuberance, and sheer "magical" in- ventiveness of everyday religious practices is more "catholic" than protestant, regardless of the appro- priateness of such Christian categories. This study often appears contrived in the ex- treme. Thus, the description of Tenna is sand- wiched between two long statements on the current nationalist and ethnic crisis. Yet almost nothing happens in the Tenna reported by Spencer that has vital bearing on the issue. Spencer says very little of the 1971 JVP (Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna [Peo- ple's Liberation Movement]) insurrection of rural youth or of the revival of the JVP culminating in the shocking destruction of human life in 1988, which reviews 843</page><page sequence="2">started at the time of his fieldwork. The violent events surrounding the JVP were highly relevant to the Tenna region. Spencer's epilogue does not fill this gap, and its failure to understand contemporary political trends only serves to underline the periph- eral artifice of the nationalist question in this vol- ume. Spencer's theoretical musings on nationalism are old hat. He fails to recognize a contradiction be- tween the instituted practices of the Sri Lanka state and the political and economic ground of its repro- duction on the one hand, and the ideological terms of state legitimation and expansion, founded in the primordialist rhetoric of Buddhist kingship, on the other. There is a cozy, comfortable ambience to his discussion of nationalist passion. Nationalism is de- scribed as a "genre" (p. 253) and is a manifestation of "people battling against the storm" (p. 252). The commonsense security of this analysis does nothing to penetrate the present horror and suffering of the people in Sri Lanka. It is said that the agony of Sri Lanka should be used to make a rather time-worn point against the village ethnography of yesteryear. This is not redressed in either the urbanity or acces- sibility of the style in which this book is written. African Reflections: Art from Northeastern Zaire. ENID SCHILDKROUT and CURTIS A. KEIM. Seattle and London: University of Wash- ington Press with the American Museum of Natural History, New York, 1990.272 pp., illus- trations, photographs, maps, notes, bibliog- raphy, index. SIMON OTTENBERG University of Washington This creative and complex work is the collabo- rative effort of an anthropologist (Schildkrout) at the American Museum of Natural History, who has never done research in Zaire but whose museum has on hand a major collection of northeastern Zai- rean objects, and of a historian (Keim) with exten- sive experience in northeastern Zaire. It is in a rel- atively new genre of anthropological, artistic, and historical analysis. Other recent examples include Adrienne L. Kaeppler's study of the objects gathered on Captain Cook's voyages (Artificial Curiosities, Bishop Museum Press, 1978), Jeanne Cannizzio's analysis of Canadian missionary collections, mainly from Angola (Into the Heart of Africa, Royal Ontario Museum, 1989), and John Mack's exami- nation of southern Zairean objects collected by an- thropologist Emile Torday for the British Museum (Emile Torday and the Art of the Congo 1900-1909, British Museum and the University of Washington Press, 1991). Such publications have certain com- mon features, enough to suggest that a new style of analyzing past cultures, a new way of looking, is evolving. Based on a specific collection or collec- tions and the collectors, each publication examines a museum exhibit of the objects, with emphasis on their aesthetic qualities as well as their functions. These publications employ not only the objects and published materials, but also the diaries, letters, field notes, drawings, printed plates, photographs, and other records of the collectors. In some cases the interpretations are broadened to include a dis- cussion of the anthropological theories and the gen- eral ideas concerning cultural evolution at the time and how these influenced the objects collected, what collectors thought about them, and what they did with them-in effect developing a useful mini- history of a slice of anthropology. Elements of the lives and cultural backgrounds of the collectors are explored and contrasted with that of the culture and lives of the people who used the objects. This is a complex new way of studying old cultures, inter- preting their culture and history through their cre- ated objects. The objects become a part of the his- tory, not a residue of it. The publications in this new genre are rich in photographs. They are not really art catalogues of exhibits but scholarly monographs accompanying the presentations. African Reflections shares these features: it is an excellent example of this genre, perhaps the best to appear so far. Based primarily on a collection at the American Museum of Natural History (supple- mented with information on objects from else- where), the artifacts came from an AMNH expedi- tion to northeastern Zaire in 1909-15 led by natu- ralist Herbert Lang and ornithologist James P. Chapin. While the primary purpose of the expedi- tion was zoological and botanical, these men col- lected a rich horde of ethnographic objects, often with detailed notations which provided the basis for this book. While focusing largely on the Mangbetu and the Azande, the book also discusses neighboring cul- tural groups and in fact, as is characteristic of this type of work, employs the objects and their collec- tors as a gateway into the ethnography and history of the cultures in the area at the time (approximately 1850 to 1920), so that what emerges is a picture of societies, interethnic relationships, political sys- tems, and European contacts, with accounts of the major explorations and expeditions into the area, the objects that were collected and the ways that the collectors interpreted them, so much so that the subtitle of the work, Art from Northeastern Zaire, is misleading; it really is a much broader study in which art and artifact play major roles. In this light there is a rich chapter on the ethnohistory of the area by Jan Vansina, a two-part chapter on music by Didier Demolin and Thomas Ross Miller, and a chapter on Azande art by John Mack. One considerable value of the work is that it ex- plores the way stereotypes concerning art scholar- ship arise and leave false impressions, in this case the idea that Mangbetu art is characterized by na- turalistic portrayal, particularly of the human head and figure. The authors convincingly argue that Mangbetu art in pre-European times was essentially nonnaturalistic, emphasizing design, and that it was the influence of European and Arab slave traders and, more important, of later missionaries and co- lonial officials that led to a florescence of natural- ism in Mangbetu art from about 1900 to 1915, after which this style largely died out. While Schildkrout and Keim are less convincing as to why it disap- peared than as to why it began, they clearly show that Mangbetu anthropomorphic art probably de- rived from neighboring cultures and was not of Mangbetu origin at all. The book is a warning to other scholars: European influence on traditional art and craft styles may occur much earlier than one 844 american ethnologist</page></plain_text>
