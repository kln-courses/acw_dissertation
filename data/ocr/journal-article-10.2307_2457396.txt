Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1943: i-x, 1-124, col. pls. 1-4, diags. 1-2, figs. 1-62.-Designed to serve the indi- vidual who has had no previous experience with fungi, this publi- cation, contrary to the title, contains accounts of both edible and poisonous species. The term ''"mushroom ''is used to embrace all fungi, a usage which many people will be inclined to question. Although descriptive accounts of the various species are included, the illustrations are the most valuable aid to identification. Many 3' 0 37l</page><page sequence="2">No. 771] REVIEWS AND COMMENTS 371 of the halftones are very good. Fig. 49, however, probably represents Coprinus micaceais instead of C. atramnentarils. The four color plates are disappoiutiug because the colors show for many of the species are not true to life. Colltybia velutipes, C. platyphylla, Hypholomta satblateritilamt and Lepiota Morgani are outstanding in this respect. L(aetaria s cilticloides, listed as edible, has been treated as poisonous by some specialists, aud because of its similarity in appearance to L. resimuts and certain forms of L. tormimosmts, must be regarded as dangerous. On page 48 an unfortunate misstatement is made, i.e., a mushroom that exudes droplets of a white or colored liquiid is invariably Lac- tarius. " Actually Mycena haematopats possesses a dark red juice, and when its gills are broken, droplets are sometimes exuded. Since this is a very common species, every collector is sure to find it sooner or later.-ALEXANDER H. SMITH. Biology The Science of Life. BY MARY STUART MACDOUGAL AND ROBERT HEGNER. New York: McGraw-Hill Book Co., 1943: i-x, 1-963, figs. 1-555.-The authors have handled well the diffi- cuLlt task of illustrating fTundamental biological principles with both plant and animal examples. Ample treatment is also given to the development of an appreciation of plant and animal groups by a study of types. Progressive features are the chapters on applied biology: Biology and Human Welfare; Conservation. Many of the illustrations are new and are good except for the sketches used to illustrate the groups of organisms. Inclusion of the derivation of technical words where they occur in the text is commendable, serving to make scientific terms come to life, and the glossary is exhaustive. The length of the book will preclude its use as a text in any but the longer types of courses.-KARL F. LAGLER. The Wild Turkey in Virginia: Its Status, Life History and Management. By HENRY S. MOSBY AND CHARLES 0. HANDLEY. Richmond, Va.: Game Commission of Game and Inland Fisheries, 1943: i-xx, 1-281, frontisp., figs. 1-68. $1.00.-An excellent monograph in the field of applied ecology. Meeting the Mammals. By VICTOR H. CAHALANE. New York: Macmillan Co., 1943: i-ix, 1-133, 52 figs., 1 map. $1.75.- In this guidebook there are 66 short, intimate, readable, some- times anthropomorphic biographies of the Muammals that might be encountered in our western national parks. It is written for the interested tourist, who will want a Copy in his library. Most of the natural history is good. The interesting illustrations by Walter A Weber add munch to the usefulness of the volume.- WILLIAM H. BURT.</page><page sequence="3">372 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. LXXVII The Ring-neck Snakes, Genus Diadophis. By FRANK NELSON BLANCHARD. Bull. Chicago Acad. Sci., 7, 1942: 1-144, figs. 1-26, maps 1-4. $1.25.-This posthumous work lives up to the Blanchard tradition of impersonal outlook, careful, cautious presentation of data and meticulous, precise style. Much credit uust go to Dr. Gloyd, of the Chicago Academy of Sciences, whose deep ancl intimate understanding of the author is evident in the excellent editing of the paper. The lack of ain introduction is to be doubly regretted since it is quite certain that one had been prepared which is thought to have stated the author's views on speciation in snakes iii general. As has been shown for Pituophis, Thamniophis and other snake genera, Diadophis differentiated and spread from a southwestern center. The chief similarities evolved in the end forms to the East and to the West are the lack of ventral pigmentation and the reduced number of scale rows. The western derivatives have re- tained the primitive dentition but have acquired larger bodies while the eastern races have developed more miaxillary teeth and shorter bodies. An unusual feature, or at least an unusual interpretation of evolutionary sequences in herpetology, is found in the author's speculations on the intraspecific relationships of the races of D. punctatus. He hypothecated that the Ozarkian upland forni is ancestral; that it became reduced in size and number of scales, as it migrated southward into the Mississippi and Gulf lowlands, to form a new race. These features were retained as the ]owx-land race spread and evolved into another lowland race in the south- eastern United States. But, when the southeastern reduced form moved northward into the Appalachian upland habitat (similar to the ancestral one) it evolved into another race which was larger aiid had a greater number of scales, simulating its ancestor of the Ozarks. If this interpretation be correct, certainly the evidence is strong that the changes taking place with the spread of the species were adaptive, as Fitch found in the western garter- snakes, and not orthogenetic. The author's use of the term hybridization, as contrasted with intergradation, is somewhat confusing. He apparently uses it to indicate interbreeding not only between distinct species but also between any two subspecies, in the same racial group, which do not have the immediate progenitor-deseendant relationship. Intergradation is reserved to indicate interbreeding only between direct-line relatives. Dr. Blanchard had been actively interested in the natural his- tory of the genus for many years as attested to by other publica- tions and the well-chosen, detailed observations under "Habits" and "Habitats" in the present one.-NoRRIVAN HARTWEG.</page></plain_text>
