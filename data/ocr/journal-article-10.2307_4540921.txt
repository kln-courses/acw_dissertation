Leslie Irvine. Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 2004. The notion of a "sociology" of animals is likely to strike many as odd, if not contradictory. Subordinated to the interests of humans, ani- mals have rarely been considered members of any human society. How- ever, the past 20-25 years have witnessed the birth of a new field within sociology, one primarily concerned with the ways that animals and hu- mans interact, but which inevitably touches what such interactions say about the nature of both human and animal consciousness. The existence of the social scientific journal Society and Animals and the recent addition of an ASA section named "Animals and Society" attest that this emerg- ing field is solidifying a place in the academy. However, one could hardly argue that mainstream sociologists generally recognize human-animal re- lations as significant. The fate of human-animal studies appears to de- pend largely on its ability to show how incorporating animals into our in- vestigations of society will enhance understanding across many avenues of sociological inquiry, including identity, community, politics, and econ- omy. Without this wider framework, human-animal studies risks being dismissed as a thinly veiled, institutionalized branch of the animal rights movement. 1Department of Sociology, City University of New York-Graduate Center, 365 Fifth Ave., New York, NY 10016; e-mail: cjerolmack@gc.cuny.edu. 651 0884-8971/05/1200-0651/0 © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">652 Jerolmack In some ways, incorporating animals into the sociological study of soci- ety should not feel strange. Long ago, Durkheim (1995) described the cen- trality of animals and nature to the organization and identity of aboriginal clans. As many anthropologists have shown, even when hunted for food or fur, animals were regarded as sacred by many "primitive" societies. While the era of modernity has meant the increasing subordination and profana- tion of nature, in the past 150 years animals have found a new place in our lives. The Cartesian portrayal of animals as automatons has given way to a Darwinian view that stresses continuity more than absolute rifts between the species. This paved the way for the reincorporation of animals into our lives in new ways. The popularity of domestic cats, dogs, and other "com- panion animals" (that is, pets) in a majority of American homes points to the increasing importance of animals in our everyday lives. While most an- imals are still treated as property and commodities, more and more people have come to regard animals in a way that approaches sacredness. Indeed, the growing use of the term companion animal over pet, the rising pop- ularity of animal rights philosophies (see Regan, 1983; Singer, 1975) and activism (see Jasper and Nelkin, 1992), the increasing use of legal sanctions against animal cruelty, and the popularity of vegetarian/vegan diets attest to an attempt to put (certain) animals on a footing, if not exactly equal to that of humans, then clearly different from that of mere chattel. As early as 1979, Clifton Bryant urged social scientists to examine the "zoological connection," encouraging investigation of "ideological conflicts" over ani- mals, the significance of relationships with companion animals, and the link between animal abuse and interpersonal violence. In recent years more and more scholars have responded. Surprisingly, the most innovative work making the "zoological connec- tion" in sociology today has emerged from the social constructivist/symbolic interactionist tradition. Whereas Mead (1934) denied that animals can en- gage in "minded behavior," numerous human-animal scholars have set out to demonstrate that animals have "selves" in the Meadian sense and can share symbols with humans. This notion is not unproblematic, and one won- ders whether it can actually be proven or not, given the tools of symbolic interaction. Nevertheless, millions of pet owners-or guardians, to use the increasingly preferred term-routinely assume that their companion ani- mals do have "selves" and that humans have access to those selves in their everyday interactions. History has shown us that the boundary between hu- mans and animals is fluid and contingent on time, place, and the practical interests of humans. Thus the time appears ripe to go beyond speaking of animals in the abstract-as symbols, property, and so forth-and discover how humans actually make sense out of and interact with the animals that they encounter.</page><page sequence="3">Our Animals, Our Selves? Chipping Away the Human-Animal Divide 653 Several of the books in Temple University's Animals, Culture, and So- ciety series, edited by Arnold Arluke and Clinton R. Sanders, show the promise of using ethnographic methods to get at what actually happens when humans and animals interact and what such interactions mean for the humans and, perhaps, for the animals who engage in them. The three books examined below all push sociologists to rethink the Meadian conception of the role of language by providing evidence that animals do indeed have selves and can share some forms of intersubjectivity with humans. These findings not only demonstrate that animals play a role in the way human selves are constructed, but point to deeper political and moral implications of our obligation to animals, if we concede that their difference from hu- mans is one of degree and not kind. REGARDING ANIMALS If the contemporary literature on human-animal relations has some- thing like a modern "classic," it is Arluke and Sanders's Regarding An- imals. The authors state that "studying animals and human interactions with them enables us to learn about ourselves as social creatures. It will show us, among other things, how meaning is socially created in interaction, even with nonhumans; and how we organize our social world" (p. 4). What follows is an ambitious book that spans a variety of interactional settings and encounters among humans and animals and sets the theoretical and methodological tone for future investigations of human-animal interaction. The authors contend that applying the symbolic interactionist perspective (although revised to be less lingua-centric) through participant observation (including auto-ethnography) is the most fruitful approach for understand- ing human-animal interaction. The authors argue that we must attempt to take the role of animals if we seek to understand them. They show how, in our everyday lives, people do this all the time. For example, observations in a veterinary clinic reveal that humans frequently "speak for" their dogs, striving to empathize with and make sense out of their dog's experience by "actively incorporating their mute companions into the 'language community"' (p. 67). The authors show how, for all involved, speaking about the animals in behaviorist terms is not a practical way to understand the dog. Based on a history of shared experience and interaction, the human has come to know the dog's indi- vidual personality. While an understanding of animals as having "minds" and being capable of intersubjectivity with humans is just as much a social construction as behaviorism, it "has the practical utility of allowing the con- struction of effective and mutually rewarding patterns of social interaction"</page><page sequence="4">654 Jerolmack (p. 81). In other words, this social construction better fits the experience that humans have with their companion animals. This fit between the social construction of the animal and actual lived experience demonstrates that humans do not merely project any self they desire onto their companion animals-only certain selves are actually consistent with how the animal acts and allow for cross-species interaction. Other chapters give more evidence that humans and animals share in- tersubjectivity by exploring how they are able to read each other's gestures to accomplish mutually enjoyable activities. Such social constructions of an- imals often blur the boundary between humans and animals, as guardians come to view their companion animals as members of the family with legit- imate preferences and needs. An excellent chapter examines the treatment of primates at two different experimental labs in the same city. Here, the effect of context on our construction of animals becomes most obvious. In one lab, the primates are treated as sources of data. Lab workers make no attempt to know or understand the animals. They work just for their pay- checks, and the culture of the lab even rewards callous treatment of the primates. Clear boundaries are drawn that make the primates unworthy of the treatment that workers give to their own pets. Yet in a nearby lab, pri- mates are morally elevated. Most employees took their jobs because they wanted to work with animals, management rewards workers for caring for and empathizing with the primates, and they see it as their duty to provide the best possible lives for the captive animals. The boundary between hu- mans and animals is unclear, and many workers see themselves as surrogate parents. The ability of individuals and institutions to socially construct be- ings in a way that becomes a nearly unquestioned norm is made apparent, yet the authors also demonstrate that some workers in the first lab were not always able to maintain such a clear boundary. This revelation is brought home in the only chapter that employs his- tory and moves beyond microinteraction. Chapter 6 examines the bizarre philosophy of nature of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis. Hitler was a vegetarian, and the Nazis passed comprehensive legislation to prevent animal abuse. The Nazis rejected urbanization and over-intellectualization in favor of "a return to the pre-Christian tribal mentality of barbarian hunters who wor- shipped nature and held animals in awe" (p. 139). Nature was sacred- the boundary between humans and animals not absolute-but Jews were a threat to the Aryan race and were responsible for the havoc wrought by modernity. While animals were morally elevated to nearly the same level as humans, Jews, Roma (gypsies) homosexuals, and others were constructed as subhuman and thus a threat to the whole natural order. "Defective" human beings, such as the mentally retarded, could, like animals, be ster- ilized and even euthanized without serious moral consequence. Thus, the</page><page sequence="5">Our Animals, Our Selves? Chipping Away the Human-Animal Divide 655 authors argue, the Nazi ideology strikingly reveals "the capriciousness of socially constructed categories" (p. 166). CAT CULTURE In Cat Culture, Janet and Steven Alger follow similar threads in their ethnography of a "no-kill" cat shelter, which deals with issues of boundary construction, shared intersubjectivity among humans and animals, and tak- ing the role of the other. "The most unusual aspect of our study," they point out, "is that we used the methods and theoretical perspectives of sociology to examine the social and cultural lives of animals themselves" (p. 203). The book builds the case that, once we pose the possibility that cats are capa- ble of minded behavior and construct their selves through interactions with other cats (and people), then we must admit the possibility that a group of cats living together can "produce elements of culture" (p. 48). The Algers have chosen a strategic research site. By participating in a no-kill cat shelter in which the cats are allowed to roam free around all of the rooms of a converted apartment (after a "socialization period" in a cage), the Algers can witness the behavior of cats in a total institution. As in any society, the 60 or so cats present in the shelter at any given time must find ways to live peacefully among each other, and they must do so in a very crowded setting. The employees create an environment that promotes peaceful interaction among the cats by placing new cats in cages-but where the free cats can get close to them, so that they become used to other cats. Cats that fight must take a "time out" in a cage. In addition, shelter workers create an environment that maximizes cats' choices. For example, no area is off limits to them, and if they prefer to eat away from the group, they are accommodated. Drawing on Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the Algers argue that the shelter creates an environment where the cats' higher selves can emerge. Humans and cats create a "negotiated order" together in the shelter, while the environment also allows for a negotiated order to emerge among the cats themselves. While portraying this negotiated order as a "cat culture" may seem a stretch, anyone who takes in stray cats and attempts to integrate them knows that their fighting and territoriality can prove intractable. Yet the Algers demonstrate how the shelter creates a context where the norm is co- operation, and cats socialized in the environment show a remarkable ability to achieve harmonious living in crowded conditions. Even with the con- stant exit and entrance of cats through adoptions and abandonment, the "culture" of the shelter is maintained. Central to the maintenance of order are the feral cats. Having come from the streets, many are used to living in</page><page sequence="6">656 Jerolmack "cat colonies" and thus live well with other cats. Their fear of humans makes many of them unadoptable, yet this makes them model integrators who help socialize the new cats that constantly enter. The Algers argue that cats rou- tinely take the role of other cats in their displays of affection, in play, and even in the rare instances of aggression. Could it be that the cooperation among cats is simply the result of behavior modification by humans? Key to countering this argument is the fact that, once the initial conditions of the shelter have been established, the cats largely manage their own day-to-day affairs and socialize new cats to be cooperative without the intervention of humans, thus passing on the norms of the shelter. The Algers also stress the importance of humans attempting to take the role of animals to understand them. Shelter workers let the cats display their preferences and then reinforce those preferences. Shared histories and routines enable the shelter workers to recognize distinct cat personalities and predict their behavior. Some of the cats become aggressive or appear "depressed" after being adopted. When brought back to the shelter, they return to "normal." Shelter workers interpret such behavior as evidence that those cats "want" to stay at the shelter, and they no longer adopt out such cats (they becomes shelter "mascots"). Thus, shelter workers routinely take the role of the cats and then make decisions based on that perspective. But can cats take the role of humans? The Algers argue that the cats, over time, increasingly treat the shelter workers like other cats by displaying shows of affection used among cats. In addition, often a cat vies for a hu- man's attention as soon as the human seeks affection with another cat. The Algers argue that many other cat-initiated interactions, attempts to appease humans, and patterned responses to human actions make it reasonable to believe that, in many circumstances, the cats have a shared understanding of situations with humans (i.e., playing or sharing affection) and thus show some ability to take humans' point of view. The Algers conclude that, with- out a shared understanding of the "social reality" of the shelter, 60 free cats and the caretakers would have found it impossible to coexist in four small rooms without conflict. Yet does this prove that humans and animals can take each other's point of view, or merely that humans can create success- ful group settings for taming animals? IF YOU TAME ME Not surprisingly, Leslie Irvine begins If You Tame Me by claiming that "animals have selves, too" (p. 2), and she encourages us to take the role of the animal-other and realize that language is not the sin qua non of symbolic interaction. Further, she argues, "our relationships with animals, on the cul-</page><page sequence="7">Our Animals, Our Selves? Chipping Away the Human-Animal Divide 657 tural level, have as much to say about human beings as about animals them- selves" (p. 7). Irvine's book explores relationships among cats and dogs in a shelter and with their guardians. Refreshingly, Irvine takes the thorny issue of anthropomorphism more seriously than some of her peers and situates our current cultural understandings of animals in their historical context. In a brief but illuminating historical account, Irvine traces the changing social constructions of animals in the realms of philosophy, science, politics, and law and shows how shifting meanings affect the treatment and status of animals. The various social constructions reveal the key factor of context. Indeed, "It is a matter of convention that Americans will eat cows but not poodles" (p. 34), and such conventions seem to have little connection to whether the animal has a self or not. The boundary between animals and humans that seems so objective is actually contingent upon human interest and thus can change over time and space. This leads Irvine to weigh arguments about modernity as a risk society that creates ontological insecurity and promotes misanthropy. To some of these possibilities Irvine adds that there is an "increasing awareness that animals are conscious, sentient beings" (p. 62) as we realize behaviorism's failure to explain the complexity of animal behaviors. Irvine also introduces the notion of animal capital. While perhaps gimmicky, the concept allows Irvine to show how those who know more about animals and have prior experience with them can "create more complex and therefore satisfying relationships with animals" and "expand the experience of self" (p. 67). Those with high animal capital enjoy meaningful interactions with animals and come to see them as having selves. At this point Irvine tackles anthropomorphism. Yes, it is unavoidable; but because we have no choice but to seek to understand all phenomena from the human point of view, anthropomorphism is not a unique "prob- lem" with regard to animals. Anthropomorphism becomes a problem when it is sentimental or uncritical-when we merely project our desires or men- tal states onto an animal. The author encourages us to use a critical or in- terpretive anthropomorphism, seeking the subjective understanding of the animal that fits naturalistic observation-just as Weber did for the human actor. Subsequent chapters explore the intertwining of human and animal selves. Shelters are places where humans can go to "try on" new selves by fantasizing about the possibilities of bringing home various animals. At the same time, an animal "presents" its self to a potential adopter, who seeks a "connection" with the animal. This feeling of a connection can be so deep that it overrides all other physical/behavioral factors of the animal-age, appearance, overall demeanor, and so forth. While this connection may be</page><page sequence="8">658 Jerolmack inexplicable in rational terms, it attests to the powerful effect that animals can have on humans. Irvine then repeats others' attacks on Mead's abso- lute separation between animals and humans, according to which animals cannot have selves because they do not have language. Irvine makes a con- vincing comparison (also mentioned by the other authors) between animal communication and the nonverbal communication and expression of self that we see among babies, deaf/mutes, and mentally disabled people. Irvine goes on to show how animals portray elements of a "core self" and meet all of William James's requirements for the self as a system of experiences (a sense of agency, coherence, affectivity, and self-history). Animals with a self become capable of sharing intersubjectivity with humans. Irvine's own experiences, interviews with, and observations of others provide myriad examples, familiar to most readers with compan- ion animals of their own, of humans and animals achieving intersubjectiv- ity through shared activities. Play is a perfect example-both players need to realize that the behavior is not "serious" or practical. A "move" out- side the play context has a different meaning to the other than it does in the context of play. Irvine shows that animals share emotions with hu- mans as well and argues that if we agree that identity is fluid and con- structed through interaction, then it is hard to deny that humans and an- imals shape each other's selves through everyday shared activity. Why do humans seek out these relations? Not only because they are unique, but also because "playing with dogs and cats provides an escape-albeit a temporary one-from the iron cage" of people's mechanistic and bureaucratic lives (p. 169). ANIMAL SELVES Each of these authors is fully committed to a version of symbolic in- teraction that recognizes that shared understanding, communication, and construction of minds and selves are possible without language. In strug- gling to combat Mead's emphasis on language as a set of universal symbols that enables "mind," each author shows how, even among human beings, we can never "really" know if we grasp the other's point of view. Yet we act as if we can achieve intersubjectivity; and this works, for all practical purposes. Paradoxically, after revealing that even a basic level of intersub- jectivity can be problematic among interacting humans, none of the authors abandon the possibility that humans and animals can successfully take the role of the other. This preoccupation with animal selves not only may leave many readers unconvinced, but also detracts from larger contributions that these books could have made to general sociology.</page><page sequence="9">Our Animals, Our Selves? Chipping Away the Human-Animal Divide 659 Intersubjectivity is not the same as taking the role of the other. For example, if I use a string to play "tug of war" with my cat, we both share awareness of and action toward the string. The string is shared among us, intersubjectively. However, while our actions meet in a way that brings off this coordinated activity, we need not take the other's point of view or share the other's understanding of the situation to carry this out. We could have entirely different practical purposes or understandings of the encounter, and yet, for all practical purposes, the game works. My cat will often play "tug of war" or react to petting in the same way whether I am fully attentive to her or virtually ignoring her. Whether I am enthused or share her emo- tion or focus of attention sometimes appears to matter little to her. This is exactly the point of ethnomethodologists, who argue that assumptions of shared understanding among humans often turn out to be wrong without impeding our ability to interact (see Garfinkel, 1967). POLITICAL AND MORAL IMPLICATIONS Each of these books begins and ends with a critique of the treatment of animals in modern society. Arluke and Sanders conclude by implicat- ing the labeling, stratification, and boundary-making that we engage in with animals with racism and sexism. In fact, each book makes the connection between animal and human oppression. Given the well-established link be- tween animal abuse and interpersonal violence, this is not an unreason- able analogy. Still, drawing links between ethnographic studies of human- animal interaction and large-scale social conflicts among humans will strike many as a stretch. This problem is compounded by the fact that Arluke and Sanders and the Algers commit the cardinal sin of attaching a scant few pages of sweeping moral condemnation and policy recommendations to their thick descriptions of microinteractions in local settings. Clearly the preoccupation with proving that animals have selves is at least partially in- tended to lay the foundation for making claims about animal rights. Yet this singular focus prevents these otherwise valuable works from speak- ing as broadly as they might to the rest of sociology. In this regard Irvine is more successful. She makes more systematic links between micro and macro levels by bringing in history and a broader theoretical framework. While no less committed to the ethical treatment of animals, she takes a far less moralizing tone. She prefers to lead readers to see how, if they are convinced by the book's argument about animals as conscious beings and if they believe that their companion animal's life has an intrinsic value, then a more encompassing moral philosophy toward all animals is the most logical outcome.</page><page sequence="10">660 Jerolmack Animals may or may not have "selves" in the full range of ways that some symbolic interactionists claim. Even if we concede that animals are not the mere automatons that Descartes portrayed, we can probably never know what sort of self and self-conscious they possess. However, regard- less of that ambiguity, these rigorous ethnographies richly describe human- animal interaction in a way that, if nothing else, proves the significance of studying the matter. More than 60% of Americans have a cat or dog. Many see their pets as members of the family. Animals are clearly a significant part of our lives. These books each reveal the meaningful lives that animals lead, both on their own and in relation to humans, and should leave us pon- dering how it is that the "self" we seem so willing to extend to the compan- ion animals that share our homes is so seldom extended to other animals, the ones we eat. Future human-animal investigations should probably fo- cus less on unverifiable speculations about the inner lives of animals and examine instead what is knowable about human-animal interactions and the significance that humans attribute to them. Expanding human-animal studies beyond microinteraction to explore how animals affect human com- munities and their organization would do much to convince sociologists that they should not ignore animals in their study of society.
