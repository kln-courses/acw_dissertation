<plain_text> <page sequence="1">    VIII COSMOLOGY ‘All time is now’, Hope tells us, and yet he is aware of the complexity that occurs in the poetic imagination, fed by concepts of the past and the future from the perspective of an intangible present. Eternity is a paradox. Eternity is not a state of things but a state of mind which contemplates all the moments of time as though they were present. This is the case whether one is looking at a star whose light came into existence in times past, or whether one is, at this moment, thinking of a philosophy from antiquity or imagining a future possibility based on a present intuition. Hope, trained as an empiricist, is wary of categorisation that sepa- rates matter, time and the spiritual. Values, social laws, moral precepts and scientific hypotheses are man-made and hence are precarious and reinvented as one scientific paradigm is usurped by another. Perhaps, he suggests, the mistake is to see ourselves as outside nature looking in rather than accepting that we are part of it.The idea that we are apart from nature and that our observations as a knower create knowledge also must mean, he argues, that self-scrutiny and self-consciousness are impossible. Our knowledge, he shows, is beset by contradictions, and, although page 219 logic tells us we are blind to the complexity of our own age, we, never- Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="2">    theless, go about creating knowledge as if we can predict and know the ramifications of this knowledge, as if our eyes are wide open. We assume, for example, that matter other than human has no conscious- ness; and what we cannot account for by ‘scientific knowledge’, we call mysticism, or coincidence, or superstition, when it might be the case that these areas will, as our knowledge increases, become comprehensible within a scientific context. The meaning of the universe might not be found by looking for an order based on statistical probability but instead by chance, accident and coincidence. Chaos theory and complexity theory, in the 20th century, explored these areas. Nevertheless, when reading Hope’s inquiries into the limitations on what we know, we do so through the imagination of a poet. The scientist, he pointed out in a lecture, ‘works with daylight sight, reasoning from observed fact, while the poet works with a kind of night sight to extend the range of consciousness’.1 Hope’s interest in cosmology stems from an interest that began in his childhood. One of his earliest childhood experiences responded to the knowledge that everything is composed of atoms and that these atoms are themselves composed of smaller particles arranged like the planets. He was haunted by the idea that each of these particles might be a universe reproducing the same sort of system and containing further universes ad infinitum, and then the other way, by imagining our visible universe as an infinitesimal particle in an atom of a larger universe and so on.2 This made him feel from an early age that a theology that posited a single God able to take notice of him was nonsense. On the other hand, Hope is rather amused at the way in which the scientist has tradi- tionally believed that his or her view of the world is more acceptable than a religious one that cannot be tested with facts and experiments, at least not now, reminding us that we might be able to test such experi- ences in the future when we ‘know’ more. Hope had flirted with the idea of studying science at university but felt that his lack of mathematical skills might prove a barrier. His interest, in particular in biophysics, never waned. His notebooks are testimony to this, giving particular attention to the ways in which the content of physics is determined by the technique which defines its boundaries. He reminds us, and the writers he argues with, that the framing of a hypoth- esis, the evolution of a new technique to test this hypothesis, is implicitly page 220 putting in what we expect to come out. Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="3">            As a poet, Hope is excited by the limitations to our knowledge. He speaks of us as savages on an atoll trying to make a world picture on ‘the basis of the flotsam and jetsam of the shoreline’, and as ‘fishermen’, with our nets flung into ‘the ocean of being’ attempting, via our senses, which although enlarged by instruments are still only partly known, to know and contain what is currently unknowable. In his last book of poems, Orpheus, he enjoys taking on the scientist Hoyle when the latter notes that really efficient leaves, ones that trap sunlight, would be black, and that the green colour of leaves shows the light they are losing. Hope then asks: But suppose the poets know things that scientists miss, Things we know in our bones. How we know none of us know If we trust what we see — though we know how deceptive it is. We accept what science demonstrates, but can it show There was not a good reason why chlorophyll failed your test? Could whoever made my world, if it was made at all, By any chance have listened to your protest And agreed so that everything afterwards went to the wall.3 Hope would agree that science has provided us with many elegant systems to give us wings with which to soar through the dark.The ulti- mate answers, though, will, it seems, be met with further bafflement, no matter how swift and targeted our flight. Hope is always keen to warn his readers when he enters areas of thought that are not those in which he can claim expertise; it is impor- tant to assess the extent to which his speculative theories carry weight from the perspective of those who are qualified in the area. When selecting excerpts for the cosmology section, I approached the scientist Dr Mart Idnurm4 and asked him to respond to a selection of Hope’s cosmology from a scientific perspective. Idnurm, in response to Mysticism of Matter, notes that it ‘contains a fascinating train of thought on the evolution of consciousness’. He concedes that the ideas seem very speculative, but he also insists that they are by no means absurd. He points out that these ideas are being pursued currently by the Transpersonal School of Psychology.5 There appear to be Greek antecedents, such as Plotinus: ‘Mankind is poised midway between the gods and beasts.’ Reading Plenum or Vacuum, Idnurm agrees with Hope’s page 221 ‘argument for the universe as a plenum’, noting that it would be vindi- Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="4">        cated by the discovery in the mid-1960s of the so-called cosmic back- ground radiation, which fills space in at least one part of the universe (this radiation, incidentally, is regarded as a relic of the Big Bang). Idnurm is excited by Hope’s Big-Little and Little-Big excerpt. He writes: From the modern viewpoint A. D. Hope’s ideas here are by no means completely fantastic. The idea that the sub-atomic parti- cles may be universes in their own right is perhaps the furthest away from current thought, yet in a sense there is an entirely new world of Alice in Wonderland relationships displayed at the sub-microscopic level. On the large-scale the idea expressed by A. D. H. that our universe is but an atom, or part of, a still larger universe may not be so absurd. It seems quite possible at least that there exist sister universes akin to our own; still this is highly speculative. Closer [to] ‘home’ is the discussion about different laws seen at different scales. The important qualification, however, would be that the differences are only apparent. The same holds for all scales of existence, only for certain scales one can intro- duce approximations which simplify the laws and hence their application to practical problems, whether these be to the microchip, to the internal combustion engine or to the cosmos. So, Newtonian mechanics and the world (our everyday world) to which it applies is but one approximation to the general law that applies at other scales. Einstein’s work is not a complete description of the system of all physical laws that govern the universe. He never assumed it to be more than the description of a facet of such a system, and continued his quest towards the next level of reality, the unified field theory, which utterly defeated him. Much develop- ment has taken place in that line of thought since Einstein died, and I believe that the solution may not be too far away. I understand too that Einstein’s work is, like A. D. H. suggests, receding into history, though of course his systems, unlike that of Newton, still reign. The notebooks provide many aspects of Hope’s discourse with page 222 cosmology.The ideas he explores not only fertilise his poetic vision, they Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="5">           serve to open one’s mind and spirit to the enigma of existence when we see ourselves as ‘knowers’. The paradoxes that are met by Hope form, I think, the philosophical nexus of his ‘creation of being’. MYSTICISM OF MATTER The starting point is that of ordinary materialism: that all agents known to us are material agents obeying invariable physical laws. But materialism really only recognises those characters and properties of matter which are universal. It therefore seeks to explain the charac- ters of living bodies in terms of those of inanimate matter, in fact it is unhappy because it cannot reduce the first to the second. There seems a gap which cannot be passed. One could attack the problem from the other end: suppose that living bodies reveal certain universal proper- ties and characters of matter which are latent in all matter (the hypotheses of J. C. ‘Bhose’ [illegible]).6 This would involve us in no crude vitalism. II When we consider the ways in which energy is spent in Nature, we see everywhere in nature that the more primitive forces are crude and violent: the storms and floods and earthquakes, the cosmic conflagra- tions and cataclysms, and that these crudest and most primitive forces have a universal range; we see that organization of these forces both diminishes their violence and limits their range. The organization of living bodies exhibits this in its most advanced forms. The machines invented by man come somewhere in between the chemical compounds and the living bodies. III The General Picture: 1. Vast areas of the universe filled with simple, relativity, simple mate- rial substances, huge expenditure of energy and nothing but simple page 223 physical change as a result. Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="6">            2. Small areas of the universe whose complex physical substances are built up. (The only area well known and studied is the Earth but there may be others and probably are many others at this level.) 3. In very limited areas, because the conditions merely ‘recur’ and the probability of this occurrence at all is very low indeed, matter shows still higher organization: the virus, the protein, molecules, etc. The inception of the ‘open system’ as independent and autonomous bodies. The open system, of course, is not in itself new — the stationary wave in a river, the growing crystal). 4. The single celled organism. 5. The multicellular organism 6. The animal conscious of its ends and purposes. 7. The self-conscious forms of matter. These form a hierarchy, in each case more and more organized, giving release to latent possibilities of matter in the form of characters not possessed by the less organized forms and, in each case, more limited in range and location in the universe, but more capable of acting on the other forms of matter. The mistake has been to take this limita- tion as an indication that life, consciousness and self-consciousness are not universal, or necessary or implicit characters of matter; to regard them as something to be, if possible, reduced to simple physical and chemical properties of universal range. IV At the first two stages, bodies influence one another externally by attraction and repulsion. At the third and later stages they are organ- ized to take up and transform the simpler bodies, to extend the amount of matter which has the higher organization. The history of life on the earth has been the history of the conquest of inanimate matter by animate. At the 6th stage (perhaps at the 5th), the devel- opment of a nervous system shows a special type of matter which is not only conscious, but conscious for the larger amount of uncon- scious matter within its own organization (the animal body) but the history of this stage has mainly been that of small parts of matter becoming conscious of a wider and wider range of things external to page 224 itself. In man this has reached the point where small parts of his own Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="7">              substance and a small part of the whole of matter, have become conscious of, or capable of being conscious of, the whole of the rest. This is the intellectual process of which modern science is an episode and perhaps the beginning of a new departure. V In man self-consciousness makes possible the free direction of energy, the early stages made possible the autonomy of energies of a material body. But there are signs that ‘other consciousness’, already existing within individual animal bodies is in [the] process of extension to bodies of which man is normally [illegible] conscious. Mystics appear to possess this power. If this 8th stage, which at present appears only under limited conditions, erratically and sporadically became general, we should have parts of the material universe capable of being conscious for the rest, as they are now capable of being conscious of it. We should have a conscious world perhaps, perhaps in the end a conscious universe, and ultimately a self-conscious, autonomous universe and the adventure of biology would be complete. It is not absurd but it is incomprehensible except as a general idea. No conception of the sort of organization that would be required is possible to us any more than any conception of self-conscious and other-conscious matter would be in terms of the characters and organ- ization of unicellular animals. But its advent need not be infinitely remote in time. The lower the organization in the past, the slower has been the period of development, the more it has depended on the chance occurrence of natural but unlikely conditions. By the stan- dards of former stages that of the conscious and self-conscious stages has been incredibly swift. The ‘sporadic’ stage of the occurrence of mystics once passed, the progress may be very rapid indeed. VII There are constant occurrences of events within nature which are called ‘miraculous’ or ‘supernatural’ and a persistent tradition of and belief in divine beings. The attitude of science is to treat these as page 225 delusions or mistakes as some of them demonstrably are. The attitude Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="8">      of religions has been more and more to treat such events as outside the order of Nature because they cannot be explained in terms of natural science. But life, consciousness, self-consciousness are charac- ters of a limited range of material bodies each inexplicable in terms of the preceding stage — each only explicable in terms of a kind of organization unknown at the earlier stage. Just as various types of man-like creatures appeared and most of them disappeared and one survived, so it may be that forms of material organization unrecogniz- able except in their effects to our own more primitive organization, have occurred sporadically and disappeared. We may call these ‘gods’. Divine characters are, judging from their effects, precisely what we should expect on the analogy of earlier stages and on the direction indicated by the progression — vital &gt; conscious &gt; self-conscious &gt; other-conscious: (a) They occur so rarely that we doubt their occurrence at all, just as a committee of unicellular creatures inhabiting the whole surface of the earth would rightly doubt rumours of the first multicellular animals and would say there was an obvious ‘scientific’ explana- tion, ie., that these were simply colonies of unicellular individuals pooling their resources. The ‘supernatural’ powers due to special- ization of function in the higher type of animal would be incomprehensible to the unicellular animals and their effects which would be evident would be discounted as ‘superstition’. In the same way the first few creatures capable of colour vision would be dismissed by the colourblind majority as ‘mystics’.  (b) The divine characteristics, unknown and possibly unknowable to us, show by their effects that they have powers over matter unknown to us — the so called miracles. Ability to think would be a miracle to a polypus or an earthworm; ability to propose and crit- icise ends to a lower vertebrate; consciousness of the structure of the universe or of one’s own motives to an anthropoid ape; ability to reproduce and transform inorganic matter, to stars and meteors. Miracles indicate a type of organization able to operate in ways which indicate a superior control over matter to our own. (c) The effects indicate vaguely an extension of the range of other- consciousness or perhaps an adaptation of this to an entirely new type of power. At all the earlier stages the ‘new’ power has always been an adaptation of some power already existing in matter to page 226 a new sort of function.  Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="9">                (d) A constant attribute of divinity has been that of ‘creation’. What this means at the higher stage the mystics hint at but cannot tell us. But it may be something as extraordinary to us as reproduction or enzyme building would be to a stone or a Mozart symphony to a lobster. — Canberra Community Hospital (1953) — Book IV, 1953, pp. 1–9. THE INSTANT VIEW FALLACY I MORE ASTRONOMICAL CONFUSION Here it is again! A useful book by two scientists, Astronomy: Fundamentals and Frontiers (Robert Jastrow and Malcolm Thompson, 1972), shows the careless reference which often appears to bedevil cosmological argument in support of various ‘models’ of the universe. In the same paragraph I read: If a supernova happens to occur nearby in our Galaxy, it appears as a new star in the sky ... The last supernova that exploded in our Galaxy was seen in Europe in 1604, and caused a sensation. One of the earliest reported supernovas was a brilliant explo- sion recorded by Chinese astronomers in AD 1054.7 So far, so good. The event referred to is the date at which the explo- sions were observed on earth. But the next sentence reads: At the position of the supernova there is today a great cloud of gas known as the Crab Nebula, expanding outward at a speed of 1,000 miles per second, which contains the remains of the star that exploded 900 years ago.8 Professors Jastrow and Thompson are, of course, perfectly aware that the phrase underlined is completely false and should read whose explo- sion was observed 900 years ago, but forget that they are writing a book for use by liberal-arts college students who may take it literally. But it page 227 is not the only case in which this sort of thinking appears to muddle Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="10">          an argument by treating the evidence as though light was transmitted instantaneously from all parts of the universe. For example, it is not at all clear that Jastrow and Thompson do not mean their readers to take quite literally the sentence: ‘At the position of this supernova there is today a great cloud of gas ...’, etc. We have in fact no evidence at all of what is there today. — Book XXI, 1979, pp. 7–8. PLENUM OR VACUUM? We are accustomed to think of the universe as consisting largely of empty space with matter very sparsely and unevenly distributed in it. This must partly be the effect of the scale of the viewer; creatures of the size of sub-atomic particles would take the same view of what Hamlet calls this too, too solid flesh. It would be hard or impossible for them to conceive [of] me as a ‘solid’ body, coordinated and organ- ized to act as a whole. But the view of the universe as empty is due also to our habit of thinking of matter as the only form of ‘filling’ and discounting the electro-magnetic waves of various kinds. Not only is the distribution of ‘matter’ in the form of particles and dust much more general thoughout the empty space of the universe than was formerly supposed, but the whole of this space is full of motions. Now that the boundaries between matter and energy are no longer as sharply drawn as they used to be we could easily come to think of the universe as a plenum: Zero with a difference! — Book VII, 1961, p. 1. THE HISTORICAL SENSE II What chiefly marks our lack of an Historical Sense, as distict from a Sense of History, is the fact that we are so well aware of the false views of the world on which past ages have depended for the world pictures they have constructed for themselves: the Copernican concept of the cosmos for example, affects every view of man held page 228 before its appearance and must considerably modify the view of God, Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="11">      if it does not call it [into] question altogether. The Darwinian hypoth- esis has a similar, though less thorough-going tendency to upset the assumptions on which man’s view of himself and his society, and the whole world picture, must rest. Some of the implications of earlier theories are only now beginning to have general affect. Those of Einstein, of Marx and Freud are perhaps still to be felt. What is clear in studying the history of previous fundamental revolutions in ideas, revolutions which question and then destroy something so obvious that no one would question it, something apparent yet false, is that the revolution itself proceeds by degrees. It is usually as with Copernicus or Darwin, incompletely or falsely formulated at first, it does not realise its own implications and its founders are usually anxious to make the theory conform to parts of the world-view that the new theory actually makes absurd or meaningless. Before one set of implications is fully grasped, before a new world-view becomes generally accepted, another may be on its way, made possible by the first which it is destined to over-set. All this we know; our sense of what has happened in history and is quite likely to happen again is excellent. What we lack is a sense of the precariousness of our present world picture in the face of history. There is no general view that our general view is as likely to be over set in the future, as [were] the general views of the past. We tend to think of ourselves as living in a ‘scientific’ age, such that no new discovery or radically new idea could over-set the general world picture. Yet this has precisely been the blindness of past ages. In a previous note I suggested that over-reliance on the general, the common, neglect of the individual, the unusual, the unique is charac- teristic of our notion of the scientific attitude, and that when we become aware of this the whole world picture may change and the present one appear as out-moded as the medieval cosmos elaborated from Ptolomy, and the implications for man and society may be as profoundly revolutionary. A new conception of matter, a new concep- tion of life, of consciousness, of other-consciousness, of the limitations of the human to grasp the nature of things — any of these at any time now may render our world picture as a whole archaic and absurd. And there may be thousands of others not even guessed at. Without at least an inkling of the probable fragility of our own world-view we cannot in fact be said to have an historical sense even page 229 of the history of other world-views. Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="12">                It may be that too well developed an historical sense is a disad- vantage and can never be common. Belief and disbelief are easy. To live and act satisfactorarily in a world in which all the basic things are no more than probable and most of them hypothetical, is not possible to most of us. To act on as if is harder than on est and non est. — Book VIII, 1964–65, pp. 47–49. THE THING CONCEPT Our way of thinking about the world is basically that of things related to and interacting with other things. Our languages presuppose this in their very structures, our logic and science are constructed on this assumption and of course it works well enough for the ordinary world around us. Any other way of thinking would seem to be ‘unthinkable’, though physics has lately been forced to question it in dealing with the bases of the material world, and philosophy has been trying to invent ‘logics’ not tied to this assumption, and philosophical linguistics has been busy purging language of false or merely verbal things and ghost substantives. If we scrutinize our notion of ‘things’ over the whole range of our knowledge we shall find a range of objects capable of holding and altering relations without themselves being changed, capable of moving as a whole in space, capable of moving other objects or influencing them where the status and nature of the thing is clear enough. A stone, [a] star, a drop of water, a bubble of gas in a liquid is each a thing. Their parts cohere; they move and are moved as a whole. But is a cloud, a mountain, a wind or a wave a ‘thing’ in quite the same sense? The objects mentioned are complex bodies composed of things, molecules and atoms which themselves move and are moved as a whole and are distinct from their surroundings. But are the ‘particles’ which compose the atoms things in the same sense? Present views in physics would suggest that they are not and that below a certain level the concepts of the macrocosmic world are simply inappropriate and its language misleading. It is natural for us to regard the chain of being as if it were a sort of hierarchy: Atoms page 230 Molecules Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="13">      Loose aggregations of molecules Chemical continuations of molecules Self-contained ‘pieces’ of the foregoing [illegible] Organisms Consciously self-directing organisms. It is natural enough in this simple and largely unconscious mythology to regard ourselves as the ‘thing’ par excellence, the sole and final example of a fully autonomous ‘body’ and to build on this, equally unconsciously a view of a homo-centric universe, just as Ptolomoic cosmology led to the view of a geocentric universe and supported a homocentric view of man’s position in it.  Suppose that we had now reached a stage in human history where this sort of thinking was about to become as obsolete as Ptolomoic concepts of the cosmos! Not the least obstacle to the Copernican type of view was the vested interest which human vanity had in the other view — the microcosm, that core and rationale of man’s existence seemed to be lost if the earth was no longer the centre of the material world and man the top of the material creation. Suppose the vanity of being the highest organization of matter, the most thingy of Things turned out to be equally an illusion! Suppose the next age of science were to prove a revolution profounder than any previous one, a revolution in which man was forced to see himself a mere part or ‘cell’ in higher organizations of which he had had till then no more conception than he had previously of the system of the heavens or the structure of the atom.  All his previous world-views would then seem to him to have been like the views of an intelligent cell in an animal body trying to give an account of that body in terms of combinations of individual cells alone and their interactions, singly and as organizations, without any inkling of the body itself as a Ding an Sich, with its own total organization, its own purposes and procedures. The single-cell scien- tist or the single-cell philosopher would no doubt evolve remarkably clever and to some extent plausible accounts, but they would be as ingeniously false as the most subtle refinements of the attempts to explain the motions of the sun, moon and planets and the system of the fixed stars in terms of a universe with the earth at the centre and the other bodies revolving around it. Such a cell might be able to grasp dimly the nature of a multi- page 231 cellular, conscious and autonomous being, but it would probably not Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="14">      get very far since its thinking would be limited to cell-to-cell experi- ence. It would not be possible to conceive the real nature of the higher entelechy. And this would be the most likely obstacle to the human conception of the higher entelechy of a super-individual, whatever it was. (Very possibly this way of thinking in terms of a super individual is just what would stand in the way of our realizing the possibility of an organization to which, as in the sub-atomic world, such concepts would be inappropriate, temporal and spatial relations being of a sort not appli- cable in the intermediate cosmos of ‘things’. Sept. 1968.) A direct attack would be useless, results in a sort of theology or anthropomorphic concept of the sort we are already used to in religious and science fiction. Yet there is a possible way out. The mere idea of an ‘intelligent’ cell is contradictory since intelligence is the character only of a higher organization of a multicellular body. A higher than human entelechy might and probably would have the characters of the lower ones, but it might have other powers as inconceivable to us because we lack it, as intelligence is impossible to a single cell. Nevertheless the great difference in the rising scale is the point where intelligence becomes possible. Something analogous to the Browning method might at least give us a clue. What the nervous system has achieved for the multicellular body, may [as an] analogy, be the sort of thing that intelligent beings can voluntarily do for the understanding of or even the evolution of higher sorts of entity. But the Browning method needs a note to itself and must wait till I get back to my books and papers. — Off Guardafui, Indian Ocean, Dec. 1965. — Book VIII, 1965, pp. 169–74. BIG-LITTLE AND LITTLE-BIG From the time that I learned as a child that everything is composed of atoms with a great deal of space between and that these atoms are themselves composed of smaller particles arranged like planets around the sun with vast spaces between relative to size of the particles, I was seized, indeed haunted by the idea that each of these particles might page 232 be a universe reproducing the same sort of system as our macrocosmic Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="15">        universe and containing further universes ad infinitum. From there it was an easy thing to go the other way and imagine our visible universe as an infinitesimal particle in an atom of a larger universe and so on ad infinitum and this seemed to make nonsense of a theology that posited a single creator able to take cognisance of me.  From the time I could count, the ‘folie de l’infinité’9 has been with me in the form of trying to make the infinite an imaginable, siez- able image. First came the notion of counting to the end of the series of integers. Later with the calculus the notion of the infinitesimal, an infinite enclosed in a definite. I wrestled with Socrates’ argument [illegible] in the Phaedo and later with the paradoxes of Zeno. The discovery of particles of brief duration introduced me to the idea of something with a definite nature and structure which yet exists only for an infinitesimal time. And this in turn introduced me to the idea of time scales of a relative sort: the notion that there might be lives lived on a time scale such that our own was like that of a transitory sub-atomic particle by comparison, and which might in turn be infini- tesimal in comparison with others, far beyond the A thousand ages in Thy sight Are as an evening gone of the Old Hundred. So that it might be perfectly possible that just as the cells which make up the body — or some of them — grow old and are replaced, we might ourselves be passing elements in the organiza- tion of other living beings imperceptible to us on account of their vastly greater time-scales and yet, unknown to us, influenced and subject to direction and control by the whole macro-being. Or that the same space might be occupied by other macro-societies of which we were as unaware as the micro-organisms living in and on and around us to whom we are simply ‘environment’, indeed that the Biosphere might itself be such a creature and the Anima Mundi more than Plato’s dream. Another set of such possibilities has arisen to haunt my imagina- tion from the consideration of incommensurable quantities, and yet another from the speculations of some phycisists, in recent years, on the possibility of an ‘anti-matter’ parallel to the matter of our perceived world — or again from the possibility that the relations of page 233 time, space and energy which hold in this universe are not continued Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="16">      beyond the organization at atomic or sub-atomic level but are ‘local’ to a certain range and that below this range other laws hold and other concepts are necessary (accounting for the apparent logical problems and discrepancies encountered by physicists trying to account for the behaviour of subatomic particles). And this raises the question [of] whether there might not be an upper limit in this sense as well as a lower. There would not, therefore, be an infinite series of worlds each continuous with and homogeneous with the others, but a series of worlds connected only by unknown laws and other logics, each strictly incommensurable and incomparable with the others. Such ways of thinking are probably very naive and simple-minded but they are so habitual to me that all my thinking is permeated and coloured by them. Any theory of the world based on what we know, any system of belief has for me, a provisional quality, an ‘unfinished’ aspect when viewed in the light of what we do not know. The actual seems always something held in suspense between all the forms of the possible, the definite ready in a moment to dissolve into the ocean of the unlimited. And I live my life in local space and time with a premo- nition that the human mind is already on the brink of a metaphysical revolution more profound than that by which the Ptolemaic cosmos was replaced by the Copernican and Newtonian. Einstein may one day look like the last of an old line — comparable to those astronomers before Copernicus who in the light of growing awareness of discrepan- cies in the old system, tried to solve them by refinement of theory, more and more elaborate systems of epicycles, and so on. His apparent break- through in theory may in time be seen to be no such thing, but an ingenious fiddle with time, space and energy in order to preserve an old world-view — a fiddling mainly valuable in taking a further step towards proving it inadequate and opening the way to another sort of thinking. If so, he would be pleased, I imagine. — Atlantic off Morocco, 1971 — Book XII, 1971, pp. 24–9. THE BOOT STRAP TRICK I The biochemical world we have until now been describing is a page 234 static one. It is a world of things rather than of events ... In Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="17">      order to obtain this picture, we have had deliberately to destroy the living tissue at some arbitrary time and systematically to fragment it into its component chemicals. Yet by doing so we have ignored just those characteristics which make life different from death. The proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates, of a living animal are to all intents and purposes identical with those of one just dead. But no one would mistake the one for the other ... where has the life gone? Can we describe the difference that we know exists between life and non-life in chemical form? Of course, we can. But to do so we must shift the perspec- tive from which we have been studying the chemistry of the cell. We must no longer ask what they are made of but, rather, how are they kept in existence? For the highly organized molecules we have been describing all have one most important character- istic in common: By comparison with more elementary chemicals, they are all highly unstable. They readily begin to break down as soon as their environment alters beyond certain well-defined limits of pH and temperature ... The second characteristic implicit in the macromolecules is that they are all extremely unlikely substances. Those mate- rials which life produces in such abundances still defeat the synthetic techniques of the chemist. In the living cell they cannot arise purely by random chemical reactions; they must be synthesized according to precisely planned pathways which can achieve a specificity far beyond that of the chemist. There must be mechanisms within the cell which can distinguish between even such close relatives as the d- and l-isomers of amino acids, or between sugars such as glucose and galactose. This second problem would not perhaps be so over- whelming if the synthesis were, so to speak, a once-for-all job, if the lipid, protein and carbo-hydrate molecules had only to be made in the desired quantities, laid down in the appropriate structure, and then were able to go on functioning indefinitely until ‘fair-wear-and-tear’ demanded their replacement. But such is not the case ... Throughout the body the molecule which survives for more than a few days without undergoing change was found to be the exception rather than the rule. The page 235 discovery of the prodigality of this constant flux of molecules ... Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="18">            revolutionized bio-chemical thinking. It became clear that one, perhaps the major function of the living cell, was the constant re-creation of itself from within. — Steven Rose: The Chemistry of Life, 1968, pp. 77–78 It becomes clear that the discovery of some of the simpler ‘organic’ molecules in the clouds of interstellar space, which has been hailed as evidence of the ‘automatic’ evolution of life in the universe by chance interaction is largely a bit of nonsense, like the similar and earlier dream of the evolution, by lightning strikes on a primitive warm ‘soup’ of simpler chemical formations in the primordial oceans. Chance colli- sion and chance chemical bonding has no more likelihood of achieving the precise chains of reactions required by wholly unlikely living substances than the 400 monkeys of legend striking the keys at random [have] at some point of time any chance of producing a play by Shakespeare or the motes in the Brownian movement in a glass of water [have] of ever arranging themselves in the shape of a lion or even of a simple crystal lattice. The random effects concerned do not form a closed series such that each possible combination given enough time must be achieved, including that of the text of the play. They form an infinite series even if the number of letters involved is finite in much the same way that the value of pi is an infinite series though only ten digits are involved. Random combination of letters can never achieve the result of a selective, purposeful and creative imagination using those letters in the form of words even though only a few thousand words are in question. In the same way random association can never achieve the planned, purposeful and orderly structure of a single cell. Vitalism in its ancient crude form may be as discredited as the ‘phlogiston’ theory, but it is by no means extinct and will not be until someone can explain and even demonstrate how a living cell can arise from random collisions of non-living chemicals. Every scientific advance increases the mystery of life and of consciousness. Human beings represent, as far as we know, the only chemical structures able to investigate and reflect on themselves; but they represent the only conscious or sentient creatures able to investigate the chemical bases of thought, feeling, sensation and will. These are not in Mr Rose’s brief, but it is part of his bio- chemists’ faith that, like life itself, they will ultimately be shown to be page 236 based on chemical structure and reactions. Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="19">                So they probably will. It is the ‘reductive’ theory so common in modern science that worries me, the theory that reduces all chemical characters to their physical substrates, all vital character to their chem- ical substrates and all conscious characters likewise. At each stage matter emerges into a new mode of being which possesses character not possessed by its constituent parts and not reducible to the character of those parts. And it is precisely these emergences of new, irreducible characters that pose a logical problem — which can be put in the form of a riddle: What is it, composed only of A and B, which gives rise to C? — Book XXI, 1979, pp. 13–19. THE INSTANT VIEW FALLACY II: ACCORDING TO HOYLE Here is Fred Hoyle, for whom I have the greatest admiration appar- ently committing what I call the Instant View Fallacy, that is the mistake of treating the whole visible universe as though what we see at any one instant were happening simultaneously instead of the view he has just stressed that the further away we look the more remote are the events in the past that we see. The theory that the universe is uniformly expanding rests on the fallacy which in turn rests on the increasing shift towards the red end of the spectrum as we view events farther and farther away. ‘The relationship of the polygons* is determined by the relative motions of the galaxies. If the larger polygon occurs later in time, the galaxies are moving away from each other. If the larger polygon is earlier, the galaxies would approach each other as time went on. In the first case the universe would be expanding, in the second, contracting.’ (Ten Faces of the Universe, p. 99.) The assumption here is that the polygon in question is observed as at one time. But this is obviously impossible. If we view the polygon ‘face-on’, all the galaxies will be equi-distant from us in time and space. The observed red-shift would tell us nothing but the fact that this set of galaxies was once receding at the same rate. We are to suppose that each galaxy is at a different distance from us so that we page 237 view the system end-on and in perspective. If we take a set of galaxies Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="20">           which includes M15 the nearest large one and others at the limit of observation, there is a time difference between what we see in the case of M15 (2 million light years approx.) and the farthest galaxy (5,000 million light years approx.) of 4,995 million light years. Since the age of the universe is at present calculated to be between 12 and 15 billion years (Hoyle appears to use the American billion), all we can say is that literally as far as we can see, 5,000 million years ago objects at that limit were receding from us in every direction at very high speeds, and that at intermediate periods nearer objects were receding at lesser speeds. What they are now doing is unknown. M15 five million years ago seems indeed to have been slowly approaching. But again what it is now doing is unknown. Hoyle at any rate, once a steady-state man, recognizes that the universe could now be contracting on itself (p. 100). But the polygons on which his earlier argument is based can never at any time have actually existed. You cannot draw a ‘line’ between objects in space and moving rapidly when their positions are only known at different times. * Of a set of galaxies formed by joining the set (in this case 5) by lines on a plane though in actuality the figure would be three dimensional; one polygon is represented as smaller than the other, though the relative shape is the same. — Book XXI, 1980, pp. 141–3. THE INSTANT VIEW FALLACY III: ACCORDING TO KAUFFMAN Here it is again in its crudest and most careless form. W. J. Kauffmann III, according to his book Black Holes and Warped Space-Time (1979), is a leading US astronomer, physicist and cosmologist. He certainly knows better, yet on p. 57, I find the following: The fastest pulsar, called the Crab Pulsar, is located at the center of the Crab Nebula in the constellation of Taurus ... This dramatic nebula is the remnant of a supernova that erupted on July 4, 1054, as recorded by the ancient Chinese page 238 historian Toktaga ... The neutron star at the center of this Dance of the Nomad nebula is therefore only nine hundred years old. </page> <page sequence="21">            Four pages back under a photograph of [the] Crab Nebula as it appears today I read: The nebula, located in the constellation of Taurus, is 6,500 light years away and measures 8 light years in diameter. The Crab Nebula appears from photographs to be roughly elliptical in shape with one of the diameters facing about twice as long as the other; the third diameter from front to rear is probably not measurable but if the nebula is really ovoid in form [it] could be about the same as the top-to-bottom diameter (the smaller). Clearly the proper figure for the age of the nebula as we see it at present should be 6,500 + 900 years + an undefined time for the exploding star to reach the dimensions of the ‘two inches’ against the night sky recorded by the Chinese observers before it shrank to its present proportions, as they record it did after more than a year. If we assume that the explosion took about a year to reach its peak we have an age of 7,401 years. Sir Fred Hoyle in a recent book, Life Cloud, written in collabora- tion with N. C. Wickramasinghe, makes the same slip as Kauffmann. Since 1968 scores of pulsars have been discovered. They all ‘pulse’ with almost clockwork regularity and with periods typically of about one second, significantly larger than the period of the Crab pulsar [33 milliseconds]. The pulse period is thought to lengthen slowly as a pulsar ages, so that the Crab is a particularly young example being less than a thousand years old.

THE BOOT-STRAP TRICK II Further to Steven Rose’s The Chemistry of Life: For many years the principle of spontaneous generation of every- thing from barnacles to micro-organisms was implicitly believed page 239 by the vast bulk of mankind [except that ‘the vast bulk of Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="22">           mankind’ never even considered these possibilities any more than the rest of their animal species did — or could. A nice example of the tendency of scientists to think in terms of their own specialties, as though their concerns were matters of common knowledge.] It was the rigorous investigations of Pasteur in the middle of the nineteenth century that conclusively demonstrated that life as we now know it could not have arisen spontaneously from non-living matter. Every living thing, said Pasteur, has arisen from another living thing. Nor should this surprise us, for even the simplest of present-day living organisms are highly complex, highly improbable molecular structures, whose chance assembly from their elements would involve odds of such astronomical unlikelihood that we may regard it, for prac- tical purposes, as impossible. The chemicals which compose present life forms require to be synthesized by specifically catal- ysed reactions, and these specific catalysts are themselves the product of the living organism and cannot arise spontaneously. If we are to seek for the origins of the complex of attributes that we regard as life today, we must assume that these attributes evolved only slowly over the thousands of millions of years of blank history that separate the origin of the earth from even the earliest living form whose fossilized traces we can now observe. (p. 248)10 This is fair enough. But he still clings to the possibility of such an evolution. I must take advice from the mathematicians and the experts on the theory of probability on my argument in BS’ theory I that the crucial point is the difference between the predictability of the combinations possible in a limited series and those in an unlim- ited series, particularly of those mathematical series in which it is possible to generate an infinite series from a finite series of integers of which language appears to be a member. In any case, until I am proved wrong, my impulse is to say, ‘this is my case: j’ y suis, j’y reste.’ Some form of Vitalism remains a possibility — even if we do not know how or in what terms it can be formulated. It remains possible because in the present state of our knowledge, no other alternative can be suggested. It remains faute de mieux, but it does remain. page 240 — 12–VIII–79 Dance of the Nomad — Book XXI, 1979, pp. 21–3. </page> <page sequence="23">             A BOY THINKING Another point just met in Sagan’s Broca’s Brain (p. 176). In his discus- sion of the better examples of Science Fiction he remarks: He Who Shrank, by Harry Hasse, presents an entrancing cosmo- logical speculation which is being seriously revived today, the idea of an infinite regress of universes — in which each of our elementary particles is a universe one level down, and in which we are an elementary particle in the next universe up. By ‘seriously revived’ he means, of course revived as an hypothesis by serious scientists as an explanatory notion in a systematic schema in cosmology. That it is an old idea revived, I did not know though from the first formulation of the atomic theory by Leukkippos and Demokritos it must have occurred independently to many minds. I recall that it occurred to mine when I was a small boy, about ten years old if I recall correctly. It arose from reading some popular scien- tific account of the atomic theory of the period in which complex atoms consisting of a nucleus and rings of electrons figured (but not the sub-atomic particles of today). My notion arose from childish consideration of Olbers’ famous paradox11 — though I had never heard of Olbers — why is the sky dark at night? In an infinite universe, I reasoned, there should be an infinite amount of light — I think some theological ideas intruded here vaguely: the notion of God as the source of light — but I went on: suppose this universe is inside another in much the same way that an atom may be enclosed in a collection of molecules in a solid — suppose we are part of an atom-universe which is inside the leg of a super-chair composed of other atom-universes — then our universe would be dark, except for the light it could produce inside itself. I recall very clearly the particular chair-leg I was looking at as I worked this out. From here it was an easy step to ask why, if this were so, there could not be an infinite regress in both directions of universes within universes; indeed it seemed a logical conclusion since I had had to abandon the theory that this particular universe was infinite in space and time. I had tried without success to imagine a finite or closed page 241 universe with ‘nothing outside it’, though at the time I knew nothing Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="24">     of this idea as a scientific theory deriving from Einstein’s theories. I had simply found a comfortable way of resolving an uncomfortable clash of ideas involved in the notion of a limited universe. Later in reading D. W. Sciama’s account of Olbers and his paradox, I learned that C. V. L. Charlier in 1922 had proposed to solve the paradox by something like an infinite regress of galaxies, clusters of galaxies and clusters of such clusters and so on to a point where the distances between clusters accounts for the darkness of the night sky through the inverse square law. I doubt if I should have been impressed since I had fallen in love with my own ‘metaphysical’ theory and was as fascinated by the thought of ‘our’ atoms as possible universes containing others as by the macrocosmic model. Charlier’s theory makes no provision for this. The only advance on this early theorising occurred to me on a train-journey from Western Australia. The idea that by a revolu- tionary theory of time and space the two ends of the regress might be joined and the series of universes be shown to be re-entrant on one another. There the mind boggled and rested in its bogglement. — Book XXII, 1981, pp. 19–22. page 242 Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="25">          Notes 1 Hope, ‘Address to Australian College of Ophthalmologists’,A.

In cosmology, the paradox related to the problem of why the sky is dark at night. If the universe is endless and uniformly populated with luminous stars, then every line of sight must eventually terminate at the surface of a star. Hence, contrary to observation, this argument implies that the night sky should every- where be bright, with no dark spaces between the stars.The answer is that the stars do not live infinitely long, so there is not enough starlight to fill the universe. A wrong answer, frequently given, is that the expansion of the universe weakens the starlight. page 243 Dance of the Nomad </page> <page sequence="26">  </page> </plain_text>
