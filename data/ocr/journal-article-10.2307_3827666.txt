<plain_text><page sequence="1">George Levine DARWIN AMONG THE CRITICS1 IN A RECENT REVIEW ESSAY IN THE NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS, R. C. LEWONTIN speculates about why there is such a large industry of Darwin scholarship while Gregor Mendel, whose work is at least as important scientifically, receives relatively little at- tention.2 Lewontin is rough on Darwin, or at least on the laborers in the Darwinian vineyard. To a non-biologist his arguments are cogent, and the proliferation of Dar- win studies does seem to give disproportionate attention to a thinker who, however great, did not after all invent evolution, and whose major theoretical contribution to the description of evolutionary processes, natural selection, has remained controver- sial. I cannot pretend to provide a satisfactory explanation or justification for the Darwin industry. Certainly, I am in no position to suggest that Mendel does not de- serve at least as much print as Darwin, but as a literary scholar used to looking at end- less bibliographies on Dickens, Wordsworth, Milton, not to mention Shakespeare, who gets a library to himself, the vastness of the expanding Darwin bibliography is not surprising. This is especially the case, biological originality aside, because Darwin is clearly a "major writer" as well as a scientist. The Origin of Species (1859) is a book that any student of Victorian literature, culture, and history should have read. And Gillian Beer's recent Darwin's Plots has once again inserted Darwin into the discus- sion of Victorian prose, Victorian narrative, and Victorian mythology.3 Gregor Mendel, on the other hand, remains for the student of Victorian culture very much a figure of science, and his obscurity (not to speak of the language in which he wrote) as a contemporary, his isolation as a monk, place him outside the mainstream of the cul- ture, and obviously outside Anglo-American culture. However inaccurately, Darwin is identified in Western culture with the idea of evolution. Almost miraculously, given the limitations on what it was possible for him to know and the enormous gaps in his arguments, his theory as articulated in the first edition of The Origin survives (of course, with major modifications) inside the scientific establishment today. And while he was more the inheritor of the idea of ev- olution than its inventor, his arguments transformed it from an eccentric to a requi- 1 The books under review in this essay are The Correspondence of Charles Darwin, Volume I, 1821. 1836, ed.

When Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge offer their theory of "punctuated equilibrium," they do so to modify or displace the gradu- alism built into Darwin's theory of natural selection.4 Gould, like many of the major evolutionary biologists, sees himself even now as a Darwinian. And of course Darwin remains the object of the enmity of fundamentalist Christians. It is of peculiar interest to historians of science and students of Victorian cul- ture that Darwin's original genius emerged from the wealthy amateur center of English nineteenth-century society: from a cross between the prosperous Wedgwoods and the intellectual and medical Darwins, members of the landed gentry, and through a desul- tory education at Cambridge, after which he was largely self-taught in science. Dar- win as subject is inexhaustible, and thus scholars have given themselves to the most minute examination not only of his ideas, his methods, his sources, and his creative processes, but of his life. While much of what the industry produces is repetitive, uninteresting, and unimportant, Darwin scholarship has become one of our more valuable enterprises. Scholarship tends to feed on itself and we often pursue the facts and the detritus of famous lives with almost no sense of why, no discrimination. Yet the more we study Darwin and his work, the more interesting he becomes. As history of science incorpo- rates increasingly externalist analysis of the development of scientific ideas, Darwin becomes an exemplary case study of how the values of a culture and the texture of per- sonal life (itself informed by that culture) help determine both what the scientific ideas are and how they are understood and used. His special interest to lay readers is that he is one of the few major figures of science whose language remains accessible; if he spoke to scientists, he was also more than ready to be overheard by the public at large. And as we grow more accustomed to breaking the disciplinary boundaries that lead students of literature to consider texts only in relation to other literature, we find how richly Darwin's texts reflect and impress the main forces within Victorian ideol- ogy and society. Fine-grained studies of intellectual and social contexts, of biographi- cal detail, of literary style, however excessive they will often seem, are indispensable not only to a complete understanding of what Darwin said, but of why he said it. More- over, the more completly we understand powerful ideas as expressions of the whole culture, the more likely we are to be able to resist authority, to imagine alternatives. I thus see the two volumes under review here as of interest far beyond the technical scientific issues which are the efficient causes of their being. And the con- nection between them is more than the coincidence that "Darwin" is in the title of each. They are, of course, totally different enterprises. The Correspondence is the richly and meticulously edited first volume of what is already one of the monumental works of Victorian scholarship. It will ultimately give us at least 13,925 pieces of corre- spondence, all of which are already listed, summarized, and indexed in an invaluable re- 4 Although Stephen Gould has expounded the view in many of his more popular pieces, the key es- say, written with Niles Eldredge, is "Punctuated Equilibria: The Tempo and Mode of Evolution Re- considered," Paleobiology 3 (1977), 115-151. For a more extended and popularly available treat- ment, see Niles Eldredge and Ian Tattersal, The Myths of Human Evolution (New York: Columbia University Press, 1982). Discussing Darwin's gradualism, they argue, "Whether Darwin's concept of biological evolution was so similar to general notions of progress within society at large because he was unable to see it any other way or because he consciously used it as a ploy to convince his peers is moot. The point is, the concept of evolution - a view still very much dominant today - is distinctly Victorian" (p. 32). VICTORIAN STUDIES 254</page><page sequence="3">DARWIN AND THE CRITICS search tool, the editors' Calendar of the Correspondence of Charles Darwin.5 Robert M. Young's Darwin's Metaphor is, on the other hand, a deeply engaged, polemical, and personal work. In it Young brings together with some revisions a series of important essays, written between 1971 and 1980, which both illuminate the way in which Dar- winian theory - the major scientific theory to "place humanity in nature" - was de- veloped and absorbed into the culture, and argue for and exemplify an historical method that requires that we get beyond internalist history and the history of ideas to understand science as informed by its culture. Young, a maverick historian of science but a precise and indefatigable scholar in his own way, argues passionately that "it is not right to separate the Darwinian debate from broader cultural, ideological, politi- cal and economic issues" (p. xiii). The essays have a coherence of vision rare in vol- umes that collect an author's scattered papers: that is, they constitute a genuine book. And when we read the Correspondence in the context of Young's arguments, we find wonderfully confirmed his view that science is, indeed, embedded in the cul- ture that produces it. The letters - stopping as they do shortly after Darwin's return from The Beagle voyage - do not take us very far into the development of the theory of evolution by natural selection, but they demonstrate with the vividness of a major novel how completely a man of his time Darwin was and how thoroughly his views of nature (and ultimately of man's place in it) would be dependent on the texture of his social and family life. Despite the formidable apparatus of the Correspondence - indeed, partly be- cause of its thoroughness - this first volume reads like a Victorian novel. The Dar- win family tree, in all its intricacy and elaborate connections with the Wedgwoods, usefully decorates the end papers. A "chronology" summarizes in great detail the events preceding the first letter (from a friend, when Darwin was 12) and then all the events covered by the letters, that is, through 1836. Appendices give us a list of all records Darwin kept on The Beagle, of all the people and all the books known to have been on board, and in addition Darwin's notes on coral reef formation (which led to an important geological idea whose gradualism, learned from Lyell, convinced Lyell to change his views of how coral reefs are formed). A fifty-page "Biographical Regis- ter," listing all correspondents, all people addressed or referred to in the 338 letters included in the volume, becomes an indispensable guide to the life of the Darwin family, to Cambridge connections, and to the scientific world Charles was entering as he returned from his travels. All of this supporting information accompanies a careful statement of editorial policies. As a whole, the book gives us all we need to know about the young Darwin, and much that we might have forgotten to ask. The pleasures of this text are, oddly, as much in the letters of those writing to the young Charles as in his own writing. Indeed, most of the letters in this volume are to or about Darwin. As in a strong epistolary novel, we get multiple perspectives on character and incident, a plethora of detail that renders the rich texture of the social and family world in which our protagonist dwells. The charming, scientifically ori- ented letters of brother Erasmus to young "Bobby" (aged twelve through sixteen) are full of boyish life and technical expertise, and testify to Charles's long and continuing interest in natural history, although not by any means to the exclusion of other appro- priately youthful activities. Family life among the siblings - registered marvelously in the monthly letters to Darwin from his sisters during his five-year voyage - 5 Frederick Burkhart and Sydney Smith, A Calendar of the Correspondence of Charles Darwin: 1821- 1882 (New York: Garland Publishing, 1985). WINTER 1987 255</page><page sequence="4">George Levine emerges as warm and pleasant, the large patriarchal figure of Dr. Robert Waring Dar- win nevertheless hovering imposingly in the background. (Dr. Darwin is all the more imposing because he does not seem to have written often. While there are constant allusions to him, we hear him in his own voice primarily when he is negotiating with others about whether Charles should take The Beagle voyage, and touchingly in a P.S. or two, when he condescends to write in his own hand and express his affection and - obviously - growing admiration for his son. In a novel, these would be powerful dramatic moments.) Young Fanny Owen, obviously once in love with (and loved by?) Charles, is one of the liveliest and most interesting of the correspondents. The Darwins were very close to the Owens, and Charles was a favorite of Fanny's father, William. Her long gossipy letters from 1828 until Charles left for his five-year voyage sound rather like excerpts from a Jane Austen novel. They are full of playful underlinings, allusions to significant moments in her relations with Charles, suggestive-sounding code words. All remind me of the decorous reticences and intimations of heroines of nine- teenth-century fiction, of their youthful energy, and of the sexual politics by which lovers maneuver inside constricting social codes. A sample of these letters can begin to suggest their vitality and, at the same time, the way they reflect, just as in novels they might, the cultural rituals and assumptions of courtship: I received your leetle message from Catherine when I was staying at the Darwin Hotel for the Hunt week 1 have delay'd so long complying with your modest (but I cant help thinking unac. countable request) that I fear you are thinking me an ill tempered creature: sulky, idle &amp;c &amp;c but I have been so busy lately or so cold &amp; frost-bitten that I have never had time to scribble you a few lines - I am quite convinced that there does not exist so dull &amp; stupid a letter composer as me, &amp; how any body in their senses can wish for one of my productions is more than my weak mind can comprehend. I can only say I feel extremely flatter'd by such a compliment, and if you are put to sleep in reading the effusion you have only yourself to blame for it - (P. 99). There follows a delightful page of trivia, and a concluding postscript: "Bur this I do desire!!!!!!!" That Fanny essentially disappears as correspondent into marriage and a difficult life of her own after Darwin departs from England is one of the sadnesses of this volume. But the rest of her narrative is suggested. We know that on his voyage Darwin is surprised to hear of her engagement and clearly interested in her fate. (Though quickly engaged to one Robert Middleton Biddulph, a close friend of Charles, she is slower than Charles's other friends to marry; she continues to express to the Darwin sisters her eagerness to hear from Charles, and we hear, perhaps even more sadly, of her in-law troubles, and of her serious and prolonged illness following the birth of her daughter. There is certainly a novel here.) What, one might nevertheless ask, has all this luscious novelistic detail to do either with Darwin's achievement as scientist, or with Young's concern with the cul- tural embedding of science? Everything. Young argues throughout his book that seri- ous history of science needs to be concerned with what he calls "the fine texture" of the social and cultural forces at work on the scientist. I don't mean to suggest that Fanny Owen Biddulph had anything directly to do with the development of Charles's theory; but knowing the world she lives in and knowing Charles's relation to her help create a context for the development of the theory. Fanny is part of a comfortable ru- ral society whose youth had comfortable expectations, whose children married quickly and respectably, and whose minds were weaned on Romantic literature. It's odd to think that a Wedgwood is responsible, by persuading Robert Darwin to let VICTORIAN STUDIES 256</page><page sequence="5">DARWIN AND THE CRITICS Charles take the Beagle voyage, for the theory of evolution, or that Darwin's charm and social status led him to friendship with a teacher, J. S. Henslow, who found the position for Charles in the first place. The romance was sustained amidst convention- ality by considerable wealth. Romantic dreams, we find, had much to do with Darwin's eventual develop- ment. On 7 April 1831, Darwin wrote to his friend W. D. Fox: "At present, I talk, think, &amp; dream of a scheme I have almost hatched of going to the Canary Islands. - I have long had a wish of seeing Tropical scenery &amp; vegetation: &amp; according to Humboldt Teneriffe is a very pretty specimen. - " (p. 120). In a letter to his sister Caroline, he says in very unscientific language, "I never will be easy till I see the peak of Teneriffe and the great Dragon tree; sandy, dazzling, plains, and gloomy silent for- ests are alternately uppermost in my mind. ... I have written myself into a Tropical glow" (p. 122). And in the midst of so much dreariness and stagnation during his five years away, now eager to get home, he writes from New Zealand that "I would not ex- change the memory of the first six months, not for five times the length of anticipated pleasures" of returning home (p. 471). To the end Darwin writes like a Romantic in search of the tropical sublime. The splendidly direct style of his Voyage of the Beagle (1839), which almost became a best seller long before he published The Origin of Species, can suggest Romantic long- ings, but is scrupulously unromantic and precise in its record of his experiences and discoveries. The letters, while manifesting a similar style, often indulge rather unsci- entific desires. They show a Darwin very interested in the politics of his day and fol- lowing the news about the reform movement from aboard the Beagle with the enthusi- asm of a true Whig. In all things Darwin shows himself a child of his time, rather more open and charming than most, capable of remarkable self-discipline, modest but quietly ambitious, and surprisingly willing to take great risks in an understated British way. Aboard the Beagle he was an obsessive worker (undoubtedly driven in part by the vision of a skeptical paterfamilias behind him, as well as by seasickness) and an enthu- siast for natural phenomena, both as scientist and view-hunter. What could be more Victorian than his comment to his sister Susan, "that a man who dares to waste one hour of time, has not discovered the value of life - " (p. 503)? The letters' richness of texture makes it impossible to summarize them. This first volume of The Correspondence will be of interest even to those students of Victo- rian culture who have no interest in Darwinian theory or, for that matter, in Darwin himself. Few books I know convey so fully what it meant to be alive in that time and how intellectual cross-currents, political interests, class instincts, and the institution of the family meet in the lives of ordinary people. Darwin, of course, turned out to be far from ordinary (we watch him growing unawares even to himself through these pages), and we feel all the more richly how far "ordinary" experience determined the unique and world-transforming argument that Darwin was to make as a consequence of those experiences partly registered here - registered in his long letters to his fam- ily, and particularly to Henslow, his Cambridge teacher and friend, during his circumnavigation of the world. With the complex sense of Darwin that these letters give, it would be difficult to abstract his great theory from the richness of the life and times that gave it birth. We can gather the first glimmerings of his theory in these pages, but we get them filtered through a personal Darwin who liked women, shoot- ing, novels, tropical landscapes, dogs, bugs, his sisters - a Darwin who was awed by his father, very much a child of his class, conventional in his religious views. WINTER 1987 257</page><page sequence="6">George Levine Young is not directly concerned in his volume with the details of Darwin's bi- ography. His primary interest is in the movement by which "people" became not only the makers of science but its subject; and his focus has to do with Darwin's importance in moving the human inside nature, as part of the world of phenomena, from its spe- cial position as divinely created and informed and thus above nature. On several oc- casions Young pauses to outline the course of his own investigations, to explain how he was forced in the study of this subject to move from "relatively internalist preoccu- pation with the histories of psychology, psychiatry, neurology, and neurophysiology to the development of evolutionary theory in Britain" (p. 126). Ironically, he found that in the scientific debates on "man's place in nature" there was far more about "ge- ology, natural theology, and Malthusianism" than there was about psychology (p. 126). Young thus reads the development of Darwinian theory into broad cultural de- bates centering precisely on the conventional religious views we see Darwin unself- consciously accepting in the letters. Young's essays read more like cultural history - informed but not confined by the tradition of the history of ideas - than history of science. That, of course, is precisely what Young wants. The essays, as he points out in his important chapter, "Natural Theology, Victorian Periodicals, and the Frag- mentation of a Common Context," attempt to relate three issues: "the common in- tellectual context, natural theology, and the body of writings in which the debate oc- curred" (p. 127). Young, of course, has a political program. He has republished these essays be- cause, he believes, the kind of history of science he was doing has had very little im- pact on the discipline, which, according to Young's account, has reverted by and large to strict internalist study or to hagiography, and has a radical blindness to the ways in which science is implicated in and becomes a disguised expression of ideol- ogy. So he argues in his preface that "The Darwin industry has reverted to the norms of scientists and scholars rebuilding the very boundaries which the nineteenth-cen- tury debate showed were not arbitrary but were in the service of ideological forces which place the role of the professional expert at the service of culture (as ornament) rather than aligning expertise with forces for democracy and progressive social change" (p. xii). Young is abrasive and his overt political stance may discourage some readers from seeing how much he has to contribute both to the debate about what his- tory of science should be doing and to our understanding of Darwin and Darwinian theory. When I first came across most of these essays in their original periodical form (particularly the extraordinarily helpful title essay, "Darwin's Metaphor: Does Nature Select?"), they not only stimulated my interest in Darwin and Darwin studies, but they provided me, through their notes and their brilliant commentary on the cultural debates, with the materials I needed to pursue my own research on Darwin and nine- teenth-century science. I do not want to subvert Young's larger objective, but I can- not resist saying that his exhaustive footnotes alone make these essays invaluable to the student of Darwin. (My major complaint about their repackaging in this book form is that Young has taken great trouble to make his text accessible without any vis- ible apparatus. The objective is a good and important one, and makes the footnoteless, unsuperscripted text very readable indeed. The problem is that the foot- note material is as a consequence much harder to find, and one must read with one's finger on the appropriate footnote page in the rear of the book in order to learn about the scholarship that was so readily, if clumsily, available in the periodical form of these essays.) VICTORIAN STUDIES 258</page><page sequence="7">DARWIN AND THE CRITICS With Young's perspective it might be interesting to consider Darwin's rela- tions to the various revolutions and bloodbaths through which he had to maneuver in order to practice his natural history in South America, to examine his complicated attitudes toward blacks, and particularly toward the Fuegian, Jemmy Button, whom the Beagle returned to his native land, to watch how unselfconsciously the values of the wealthy (liberal and generous, provincial and racist and sexist) English landowner govern his perceptions of the new worlds he visited, to notice how much the unifor- mitarianism he developed out of Lyell parallels his politics. In attempting to "break down barriers" between scientific and social history, Young begins, as he puts it, "in one small area": the intimate interrelations between natural theology, Malthusian theory (and political economics), and the working out of Darwin's theory. Treating this subject, Young wants to show that "the distinction between so- cial and biological issues . . . was broken down in principle before the turn of the [nineteenth] century" (p. 24). While some of Young's ideas have since been worked out in other ways by Sylvan Schweber, 6 and while there have been extensive discus- sions about precisely when Darwin read Malthus and how far the "Eureka" of natural selection really followed from his re-reading as Darwin claims in his autobiography, Young's analysis of Malthus is illuminating. He shows that Malthus was already a "bi- ologist, a human ecologist," and he places Malthus, Paley, and Darwin in the same enterprise of constructing a theodicy. Darwin's closeness to natural theology (which was in turn absorbed by Malthus in the revisions of his book) has been argued recently by the late Dov Ospovat. 7 Young's essay makes the connection powerfully, particu- larly by showing how easily Darwin's theory was reabsorbed into teleological thinking and used to serve Malthusian purposes. The subtle analysis of the metaphor of "selec- tion" in Darwin shows how Darwin's ambiguity and anthropomorphism left him open to endless adaptation and interpretation. 8 There is much to argue with throughout these essays, but they are all deeply grounded in the primary and secondary materials that will allow serious readers to test Young's argument. Together they provide an example of how history of science, writ- ten with a view to understanding the political, social, and economic forces at work on science and affected by it, can illuminate both science and cultural history. The im- plicit debunking of Darwin is a natural consequence of this kind of history and seems to me at least implicitly a modification of Kuhn's theory of paradigmatic leaps and of Foucauldian epistemological shifts. Life after Darwin is more like life before Darwin than traditional histories suggest. The views entailed by this kind of history surely cause unease in many circles (by Young's sometimes polemical account this is radical understatement). Young shows how far Darwin retreated from his own theory in his revisions of The Origin and emphasizes not its uniqueness, but its similarity to other 6 Sylvan Schweber has some almost monograph-sized essays on these ideas. See "Darwin and the Po- litical Economists: Divergence of Character," Journal of the History of Biology 13 (1980), 195-289; and "The Origin of the Origin Revisited," Journal of the History of Biology 10 (1977), 226-316. 7 Dov Ospovat, The Development of Darwin's Theory: Natural History, Natural Theology, and Natural Selection, 1838-1859 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981). 8 Another recent book that contains excellent material on Darwin's metaphorical language and its relation to contemporary discourse is Edward Manier, The Young Darwin and His Cultural Circle: A Study of Influences which Helped Shape the Language and Logic of the First Drafts of the Theory of Natu- ral Selection (Dordrecht: Reidel, 1978). WINTER 1987 259</page><page sequence="8">George Levine intellectual activities of his time: "Darwin's achievement turns out to be much more like that of Lyell and of the other evolutionists: together, by a rather confused mix- ture of metaphysical, methodological, and scientific arguments which depended heavily on analogical and metaphorical expressions, they brought the earth, life, and man into the domain of natural laws" (p. 122). Young's resistance to "hagiography" is an aspect of the insistence on treating science not as the ahistorical (and therefore, somehow, fully authoritative) discovery of universal truth about nature by aberrant geniuses, but as part of a densely populated history, governed by forces beyond the control of intellect or intellectual formulations (his last long essay seeks a specifically Marxist method of history of science). Given the current context of scientific aggran- dizement of Darwin, there is probably much to be gained in seeing him not in his uniqueness but in his similarity to his contemporaries and to others who preceded him. What one misses in Young is precisely that sense of what made Darwin so effec- tive when others "like him" were not, what was unique about him, what constituted his genius amidst his confusions. One misses the possibility (which Gillian Beer has argued and Young contests) that the ambiguities and anthropomorphisms of his writ- ing were creative and not merely failures of precision and clarity. Whatever one's objections, one has here two major contributions to the study of Darwin and of his culture. The astonishing detail and scholarship manifested in the Correspondence may well be a happy consequence of that hagiographical impulse that Young objects to; but the Correspondence stands also as evidence to support the im- portant position that Young argues and I believe demonstrates throughout his book: "At the heart of science we find a culture's values" (p. 125).
