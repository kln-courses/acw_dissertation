<plain_text><page sequence="1">"THE ORDER OF WOLVES" By Richard Fiennes. 7976. Hamish Hamilton, London. 206 pp. illustr. Price 55.25 In the preface to his book "The Order of Wolves", Richard Fiennes states that his objectives in writing this volume are to dispel some of the many myths surrounding this species, particularly those which portray it as an evil and unwanton killer, constantly at odds with man. The table of contents further raises optimistic anticipation on the part of the reader that the book will perform its purpose and summarize information from recent research studies. Alas, this reader at least was disappointed. Mr. Fiennes instead produces a curious mixture of scientific facts, anecdotal and frequently naive anthropomorphism, coupled with his own mythology about how wolves should behave. Perhaps this is the result of his stated opinion that the carefully undertaken studies by such biologists as David Mech and others, provide information of no greater truth than do the works of such delightful novelists as Farley Mowat. This is a great pity. The author is obviously widely read and has otherwise carefully consulted most major works on wolves and their relatives. The book contains excellent illustrations and tables, but interspersed between the lines are all too frequent, inexcusable errors; especially for, as we are informed, the author is an animal biologist (e.g. primary producers are herbi- vores - p58). These errors and occasional obvious contradictions in his arguments result in an overall impression which tends to negate the author's original purpose. Added to this are the Ardrey-like jumps Fiennes makes in comparing wolf and human behaviour and organization. Suffice it to say that most of these problems could have been eliminated, without losing the author's original intent, if the book had received a thorough review before going to the presses. This is essential considering the wide readership to which this book is presumably directed. For any potential purchaser, the reviewer suggests a critical scrutiny of the text, before deciding on this or alternative books on the subject. D.M.
