<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Werther Effect: The Esthetics of Suicide TOBIN SIEBERS The "Werther effect" denotes within psychological literature the tendency of people to commit suicide under the compulsion of imitation rather than for individual motivations. In a 1974 essay, David Phillips uses the term to explore the idea that widely circulated stories of suicide cause a rise in national suicide rates. His idea is derived from the effect that Goethe's novel had on its reading public. The Sorrows of Young Werther was an esthetic failure, if esthetics is to be defined as a symbolic and essentially disinterested activity, for Goethe's readers were known to translate the novel into deadly practice. Werther, of course, was banned in Leipzig in January 1775 precisely because the theological faculty of the university believed that it would be successful in advocating suicide. The Werther effect, in short, stands as one of the great examples of the imitative effect of fiction on moral life. We tend, however, not to recognize this same Werther effect within Goethe's life and work. Rather than emphasizing imitation, we focus on either the original feelings that made Goethe write the novel or the originality of the novel itself and its role in literary history. We tend to view the novel, then, as separated from the imitative effects that most concerned its first reading public and against which any concept of "originality" must be defined. As a result, we lose the means to view the events surrounding the book as an opportunity for creating a more interdisciplinary view of the reading experience in general. First, we stress Goethe's now famous explanation Mosaic 26/1 0027-1276-93/010015-20S01,50©Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">16 Tobin Siebers of the origins of Werther in which he attributes the novel to his feelings of depression and makes a special point of denying that he was imitating other books. There is, however, something strange about this explanation. Although Goethe was only twenty five when he wrote the novel, he never again produced a work with a tragic conclusion like that of Werther. Apparently, the writing of Werther purged Goethe forever of his unhealthy feelings. Second, we give Werther a unique position in literary history. According to some critics, the book is the first psychological novel, and it continues to be regarded as one of the great literary models in the tradition. The same argument has been extended to Goethe's hero. Werther has acquired a unique status in the history of literature because he represents an exemplary case of personal emotion being transferred to literature and because he became the model for the artist-suicide in the Romantic age. I would argue, however, that we will never comprehend the great artistic achievement of Werther if we insist on linking it to real suffering, because the novel's triumph is ultimately esthetic rather than ethical—although I hasten to add that distinctions between esthetics and ethics are of limited value in the age of Romanticism. The fact that we are tempted to trace the novel's power to Goethe's ability to sublimate his own personal sufferings in fiction exposes the extent to which we remain under the domination of the same esthetic ideology that created Werther, namely the Romantic myth that suffering is necessary to cultivate artistic originality and to be recognized as a unique individual. In this essay, therefore, I would like to pursue an anti-Romantic reading of the novel. I want to insist that the Werther effect and its imitative patterns are as much a cause of the novel as its effect. If Werther is more imitative than original, if something like a Werther effect produced Goethe's novel, we must seek an explanation for the power of the novel not in Goethe's emotions but in literary history—or, at least, in the effect that this history had on Goethe. What does it mean, however, to claim that Werther is imitative? I do not mean to suggest that the suicide of Carl Wilhelm Jerusalem, Goethe's melancholic student acquaintance at Leipzig, serves as a model for either the novel or Goethe's emotional state during its writing. Jerusalem's suicide did have an impact on Goethe, but only because the incident resonates with the dominant esthetic of the period. The knowledge of Jerusalem's death merely serves to mediate between Goethe's artistic aspirations and the Romantic tradition. It is a red herring because it allows Goethe the pretense of relating his artistic work to an unmediated experience of suffering, when in fact a precedent exists in literary history that makes it unnecessary for Goethe to experience suffering in order to write about it. Jean-Jacques Rousseau created this precedent, for he was the first to establish in a major way the value of the suffering self for the production of literary works. He initiated the esthetic movement called Romanticism by constructing a double image of himself. As I have explained elsewhere, Rousseau exposes the cruelty and injustice of society by making an example</page><page sequence="3">The Werther Effect 17 of himself: "to make an example of oneself," to become the example and outcast of society, is to resolve a certain division between victim and victimizer as well as to achieve a uniqueness extremely beneficial to esthetic goals (72). Another way of elaborating this proposition is to state that Rousseau's early writings, whether essayistic or fictional, are deeply autobiographical, and that contemporary readers experienced them in precisely this way. Rousseau thus establishes himself as a series of personalities—as the victim of culture, as its paragon and as a character in a narrative— through which individuality may be represented. He embarks on an enter prise to create an idea of individuality for himself and his culture. He creates another Rousseau with whom he may converse. He feeds on his own substance and nourishes himself. As self-sufficient as God, he is at once savior and condemned. Rousseau's genius .was to have realized that he could be his own victim and victimizer, but his discovery did not necessarily have happy consequences for the Romantics. For a logical outcome of this attitude is suicide, and in this progression we find the potential for both a great novel of suicide and much genuine self-destruction. Werther is an esthetic expression of Rousseau's ethical system: Goethe's Romanticism defines itself by reproducing esthetically the basic elements belonging to the scenes of persecution that Rousseau describes in his writings. When Goethe disclaims any relation between his novel and the tradition, therefore, and names personal suffering as its sole origin, he both suppresses and imitates Rousseau. The Romantic tradition views the suffering self as a work of art, but if we wish to understand Romanticism, we need to acknowledge that it distinguishes some forms of suffering as possessing greater esthetic potential than others. Rousseau discovers the idea that the forms of suffering with the greatest esthetic value portray the self as a victim of persecution. This achievement derives less from Rousseau's esthetic taste than from an ethical ability to describe the ways in which persecution relates to social life. In Rousseau's eyes, violence against the individual is at the heart of culture. For René Girard and his school, however, this insight acquires even greater import. As they see it, persecution is not merely an effect of culture but part of its founding order. Girard has made a strong case for the fact that persecutors represent their violence in a particular way: they depict their victims through a series of distorted images and ideas, making them into scapegoats of culture. Persecution produces a "text of persecution," a mythological language, in which the actions of the persecutors are concealed, all blame for violence is placed on victims, and a form of social hierarchy emerges (6-9). In Eric Gans's language, then, persecution creates "scenes of representation" (13-15). Persecution is "scenic"—in the same way that Freud defines the primal scene—both because it produces fabulous accounts of victims and victimizers and because it configures internal, mental scenes that permit social order to be imagined. Historically, these scenes contribute to social order, although today we recognize them increasingly as a form of</page><page sequence="4">18 Tobin Siebers mythology serving violence. It is our sympathy with the victim—a recognition of the centrality of victimization in such representations—that exposes the true nature of these mythological scenes. Sympathy also provides the ethical thrust behind the modern alliance with the victim, of which Romanticism is the emergent form. Nevertheless, the ethical nature of our sympathies does not always escape the esthetic dimension of the scene of persecution—by which I mean its capacity to produce fabulous images of the victim—because we continue to misrepresent the victim, first, by creating the specific cult of the Romantic outcast or poète maudit and, then, by maintaining a cult of the victim in general. This is to say that the consequences for selfhood are similar in both esthetic and real experiences of persecution, even though they may differ in great respects. Both experiences depend on the relation between violence and selfhood, but the esthetic scene, which reaches a critical stage of development during Romanticism, risks paradox. First, it endangers the self, as Nietzsche says, by producing a mendacious egoism. Second, it creates a morally ambiguous view of literature, for the knowledge of the scenic power of persecution that artists appropriate for their writings overturns their esthetic system with its violence. The violence that artists produce in esthetic scenes of persecution has its own victims: those called victimizers for the sake of the esthetic system. Romantic artists almost always fail to extricate themselves from this powerful association with violence. When they are least successful, their art looks unsympathetic or vengeful. When they are most successful, they achieve, at best, the appearance of egotism or hypocrisy. There are, of course, many differences between Rousseau's writings and Werther, despite their fundamental reliance on the representation of suffering. The greatest difference turns on the issue of autobiography. Werther is supposed to be a novel: its protagonist is not Goethe but Werther. In contrast, Rousseau's writings are inherently autobiographical, and they therefore succumb to all of the paradoxes currently plaguing debate about the genre. In modern critical parlance, autobiography is essentially self contradictory. One camp contends that it is impossible to write autobiography, so strong is the fictional nature of all representation. Any attempt to compose one's life results in a novel. Another camp, influenced by psychoanalysis, holds that all writing is involuntary autobiography. So powerful is the unconscious that any attempt to move outside the self produces a return of the repressed in fictional guise. All writing speaks the truth of the self, without, however, being able to name that truth very effectively. Depending on which theory we believe, either the novel or autobiography is the dominant form. It grows increasingly clear, however, that modern critics have no language to explain the real difference. What is an obvious distinction for most people becomes a thorny issue for literary criticism. The question of where the autobiographical element lies always returns us to the interaction between victimization and literary form, or, in different words, to the connection between the ethical and esthetic versions of the</page><page sequence="5">The Werther Effect 19 scene of persecution. Indeed, the actual texts written by Rousseau and Goethe differ most significantly in the role played by the scene of persecution. Rousseau conceives of himself as a victim of society and situates his suffering at the heart of his writings. After the scene of his persecution has been established, however, it may be appropriated by other authors, without their having had to live it in reality, and as the scene becomes increasingly part of the esthetic tradition, it acquires greater availability and accessibility. Yet it is crucial to realize that the esthetic scene continues to reproduce the character of a real event. The temptation remains when reading an esthetic work to return to an original scene, if one can be found, or if not, to compose one by imagining a secret relation between the experiences of the character and those of the author. The most common of reading experiences verges upon the experience of ethnography because the reader, like the anthropologist, always conceives of the relation between fictional representations and reality according to what Gans calls the "generative model." This means that we tend, even in esthetic situations, to view the gap between reality and fiction as an obstacle to be overcome, whether it requires us to identify authors with characters or to plumb deep social meanings in the most farfetched literary fantasies. This tendency explains, for instance, why a confusion exists between Goethe and Werther in particular and between authors and characters in general. Goethe's contemporaries automatically assumed that he was expressing his own personal angst through Werther, and this was in some ways true. Goethe describes a battle with depression, although he does not admit anything equaling the despair found in Werther. He views the book as a success because he has managed to transform "reality into poetry"; but the reactions of his friends and of the public still catch him off his guard: he in no way expects them to turn "poetry into reality" (147). Far from enjoying a Wertherian pleasure in the public's interest in his apparent suffering, Goethe was horrified by its desire to see him enact the emotions of his unfortunate protagonist. In short, Goethe did not wish his readers either to impose his fiction on his reality or to take it as a model for their own reality, but, of course, they did both. After the publication of Werther, Goethe was forced to travel incognito, and a number of pale young men donned the yellow waistcoat and fired a bullet into their brain. Readers are driven unavoidably to find genuine suffering behind the representation of suffering, and for all the attempts by modern critics to put a stop to this thinking, by the invention of the so-called "intentional fallacy" for example, it is unlikely that anyone will ever be able to repress this all too-human desire. Nor, in fact, should we wish to repress it, for the defining feature of the reading experience consists of trying to identify with what other human beings think and feel. We would be foolish, then, to expect that readers would want to stop thinking that characters are human. Nevertheless, we must understand that Goethe's relation to his public is infinitely different from Rousseau's, and that any correspondence between</page><page sequence="6">20 Tobin Siebers their experiences is the product of what one must call an esthetic device. To call Werther esthetic is to recognize that it is inherently imitative—and not participatory in the same way as Rousseau's writings: despite the public's desire to create the cult of Rousseau à nouveau, to place Goethe, and not Werther, at the center of the scene of persecution, Goethe did not need to live through the experience of suffering in real life, simply because it existed esthetically. The important differences and similarities may be summed up by comparing Werther to the work most like it in Rousseau's canon, The Reveries of the Solitary Walker, although it was published after Goethe's novel. Rousseau, of course, died before finishing the Reveries; and Werther, it seems, dies before Goethe can finish the novel. These deaths are as different as can be. Yet they are similar insofar as both writers offer a rather truncated model of the Romantic personality to their readership. This is precisely the point. The essence of the Romantic personality lies in this very impossibility, its flirtation with death, and it will never surpass these two instances. Its success can be described as a direct result of the fact that the readers of Romantic texts always have a better chance of living a Romantic life than any Romantic hero because they possess the model of the entire life: readers have the opportunity to stage their own suffering in ways that will allow them to experience the distinction that Romantic heroes win only after death. The model of the Romantic hero's reception remains Goethe's success at Werther's expense, for Werther's death makes Goethe's esthetic life possible. Goethe could not have created Werther if Goethe had been a Werther. Imagine the grand effect it would have had, however, if Goethe had subsequently killed himself in a fashion after Werther. The possibility of achieving this effect did not escape other Romantics, Pushkin and Lermontov for example, whose tardy arrival on the scene made them more vulnerable to the poetics of suffering. After Rousseau, the esthetic scene of persecution is sufficient to summon the narrative elements necessary to give coherence to a Romantic experience, and readers need not necessarily apply the character's "reality" to themselves. Nevertheless, I add quickly, this is not to say that the temptation to live the scene disappears. The esthetic scene takes its toll on artists by urging them to injure themselves or to represent themselves as injured, which explains in part the existence of the Romantic myth of the mad artist, the appearance of the Doubles as a literary theme, and the veritable explosion of artist suicides and Romantic madmen in the nineteenth century. Suicide is itself a highly individualistic action within social structure. Indeed, it risks being the most individual of actions. Nevertheless, if we are to comprehend how it relates to Romantic esthetics, that is if we are to see that some forms of it begin as an esthetic formula that goes awry, we have to examine how the act is embedded in social relations. Another way of framing this problem is to ask how suicide relates to the scene of persecution that we have been analyzing. Émile Durkheim's book on suicide, as might</page><page sequence="7">The Werther Effect 21 be expected, relates this apparently individual action to collective representations. It seems an irrepressible irony that the birth of sociology relies both on the poetics of suicide and on what may be called in some respects a literary analysis. Dürkheim relies on accounts of real suicide and on representations of suicide in literature. He creates his methodology by transforming the act of suicide, a marginal and eccentric activity, into a model for collective representation, demonstrating that sociology owes a great debt to the Romantic ethic of the nineteenth century. Indeed, his description of the forms of suicide amounts to an analysis of how suicide may be used to represent oneself to society at large. Durkheim's typology of suicides is not unrelated to the esthetic devices found in Romantic literature, and it will be useful in interpreting both Werther and the larger Romantic mythology of the victimized artist. Dürkheim begins his study by arguing that the suicide rate drops during extended social crises, not at their beginning or end, and he attributes the phenomenon to the greater social cohesion made necessary by times of duress. For example, the suicide rate is low among Jews, according to Dürkheim, because of the general social hostility that they experience. When society requires the sacrifice of individuality, fewer suicides occur. With the greater possibility of individuality, more suicides take place. Indeed, Dürkheim predicted that the suicide rate would climb as society became more modern and a greater possibility of individual freedom evolved, and this is exactly what has happened. Suicide, then, relates intimately to the representation of individuality, and according to Dürkheim, these representations take three forms: egoistic, altruistic and anomic suicide. Each form measures the relation between the individual and the social at different degrees. "Egoistic suicide," Dürkheim concludes, "results from man's no longer finding a basis for existence in life" (258). Egoistic suicides are so removed from the normal social justifications of existence that they reject society in a radical way. Altruistic suicide places the basis for existence beyond life. Finally, anomic suicide occurs when someone's existence lacks recognition and regulation by other people. Both anomic and egoistic suicides spring from what Dürkheim calls society's insufficient presence in individuals, or their greater individuality. Altruistic suicide, on the contrary, springs from too much of society's presence in the individual, or the lack of individuality. In fact, however, altruistic suicide often places its faith in some future tribute or memorialization. It is characterized by less individuality, to be sure, but people who give their life for their country, for example, frequently win great distinction and uniqueness after their death. We give great reverence to war heroes and martyrs. This reverence is not unlike the esthetic effect produced by the scene of persecution: we revere the altruistic suicide as both victim of the enemy-persecutors and hero of his or her people. Indeed, altruistic suicide is easily perverted by the promise of glory. The amusing modern film, The Americanization of Emily, takes this problem as</page><page sequence="8">22 Tobin Siebers its theme. A public-relations minded admiral seizes upon the harebrained idea that an American sailor should be the first to die on the beaches of Normandy. He recruits one of his aides, who is treated to a premature monumentalization in the form of vast favors, much feasting and grand social distinction. They even commission a statue of him, to be erected later at the proper moment. When on the beach itself, the hero changes his mind, his fellow soldiers fire upon him and try to chase him into the enemy's grasp. Much modern military recruitment depends on this kind of confusion of altruistic and egoistic motives. Similarly, egoistic suicide attempts to build ego by sacrificing it. It creates a cult of the self by translating negative into positive attention. The unfortunate individual who reasons, "I will kill myself, then they will be sorry," wishes to attain in the future by extreme measures the distinction that he or she believes is due in the present. In egoistic suicide, the "perfect moment" merges death and self-celebration, as when Narcissus's death rattle joins his last gasp of admiration for his own image. Like altruistic suicide in its perverse form, egoistic suicide stages the victim's death to win the pity and attention of the community. Egoistic suicide is more or less the Romantic system under another name, and its evidence lies everywhere during the nineteenth century. In almost every instance, it is associated with mysterious talents and magnificent self-sufficiency. The Romantic ironist is one of its most obvious examples, for the self-negation of irony serves to make the artist, Kierkegaard tells us, a mysterious hieroglyph for his or her contemporaries. The third type of suicide identified by Dürkheim is anomic suicide. Although anomic suicide would appear to be far removed from the Romantic quest for difference, it reveals in extreme forms of psychopathology the failure of egoistic motives, and it serves in its more theatrical forms as a kind of strategy for stimulating interest in those who desire uniqueness. Anomic suicides, as Dürkheim describes them, destroy themselves in remorse over their abandonment by society, for they cannot support the loneliness of anonymity. Whether this form of suicide reveals a last ditch effort to gain significance for the self—and thus its similarity to egoistic suicide—or whether it genuinely marks the absolute desperation of someone who has fallen out of place is difficult to analyze; in any case, it is clear that the self knows that its own value lies in the attention of society and that it must convert this attention into self-esteem or lose itself entirely. The anomic profile has great resources to place in the service of self representation. Anomic suicide becomes productive, Dürkheim explains, if it can translate suffering into a strong preoccupation with the self. Rousseau's "flight" from society, for example, was a strategic use of the anomic profile. This tactic worked for him because he was not anonymous, and he hardly risked being forgotten. Goethe also took advantage of this strategy by publishing Werther anonymously: the public's desire to discover Goethe's identity was fired beyond belief, and his reputation was established once</page><page sequence="9">The Werther Effecjy ggcl and for all. Indeed, the "pose of anonymity" often sets into motion the reactions cultivated by Romanticism and present all around us. Beau Brummell, for instance, used to attend balls sponsored by high society in a peculiar way. He would arrive and station himself in the antechamber, never entering but positioning himself well in view of the room, and after a certain interval, he would quit the event, leaving everyone to gossip about his motives and to make expressions of regret. We can detect a similar strategy in the aspiring social butterfly who sulks in the corner at cocktail parties. Likewise, in the more intimate field of sexual relations, no Don Juan ever admits his success to women; he begins by bemoaning his failures with them and complaining about his suffering at their hands. He lays out his suffering like bait to attract the sympathy of his prey. In a Romantic universe, often the slightest show of suffering or isolation will bring down upon the "victim" a shower of concern and affection. Dürkheim, of course, takes suicide seriously, as well a sociologist should. Literary critics are in a somewhat different position. We are not concerned with the death of human beings but with literary representations. We should insist, at the least, on the difference between the esthetics and the ethics of the act or, at the most, on how the esthetics of suicide feed on the ethical meaning of the real act. Werther involves precisely this issue, but critics have by and large shown little of the required disinterestedness. They are perhaps too much like Werther's pale young imitators; they are gourmets of feeling. Caroline Wellberg, for example, usefully explains how eccentric Werther is in comparison to other sentimental novels, giving reason for us to suspect sentimental responses to the novel. The critical reception of the novel, however, has generally been too sentimental to understand its power to organize feelings. Even those who view the book as a curiosity, as an example of the Zeitgeist of the age of sentiment, fail to escape this trap, for they unwittingly insist that Werther is either a victim—of love or of bourgeois culture—or some kind of victimizer—hypocritical, aggressive or spoiled. Although I will not be able to elaborate it here, the point to remember is that we cannot understand Werther in any fashion by relying on an "either/or." His forcefulness as a character evolves from Goethe's ability to make him always "both"—that is, Werther's autonomy and distinctiveness derive from his ability to embrace oppositions and to symbolize in miniature the conflicts found in large social processes. Werther, most critics imply, does not use the ethical power of suicide as a means to represent himself as a poetical figure. His self-destructiveness is unrelated to his desires to attain social distinction and poetic luminosity. He is a victim, perhaps a little deranged and with excessive sensitivity, but a victim nevertheless. He suffers the misfortune of falling in love with a married woman, and in that lies his great tragedy. (In some variations, he is considered a victim of class structure as well, as, for example, in the reading of Carol Ames.) These sentimental readings fail on two counts. First, they ignore the extent to which Werther uses the tragedy of love to</page><page sequence="10">24 Tobin Siebers make claims for his inimitable nature. Werther begins by using Lotte's sympathy to distinguish himself in the sphere of love relations: "She knows how I suffer. Today her eyes looked deep into my heart." Next, he-transforms his suffering into a historic event: "Sometimes I tell myself my fate is unique. Consider all other men fortunate, I tell myself; no one has ever suffered like you. Then I read a poet of ancient times, and it is as though I were looking deep into my own heart. I have to suffer much. Oh, has any human heart before me ever been so wretched?" (95). Lotte's relation to Werther parallels his own view of himself; the important thing is that someone look deep into his heart. The text cracks open to reveal a schizophrenic discourse, in which Werther scrutinizes and takes the pulse of his abused heart, as if it were someone else's. His taking confidence in himself serves to separate him from society, mimicking a god-like self-sufficiency and demonstrating once and for all that his "fate is unique." Second, the sentimental explanation of Werther's suicide fails to see what adulterous love buys for the ambitious young man. The essence of the sentimental interpretation may be derived from the following scene, in which Werther meets Lotte and Albert in the garden. Werther waits for them in an "enclosure that has a mysterious aura of loneliness" (67). He runs to meet their footfalls and they retreat back to the "gloomy enclosure" just as the moon rises above the wooded hills. They sit for a time in the profound darkness, when suddenly Lotte begins to speak as if she were Werther: "'I never walk in the moonlight, never, without being reminded of my dead. In the moonlight I am always filled with a sense of death and of the hereafter. We live on'—and now she spoke with glorious feeling—'but, Werther, do we meet again? Shall we recognize each other? What do you feel? What do you believe?' 'Lotte'." Werther responds with eyes full of tears, "'we shall meet again. Here and there...we shall meet again'" (67). Demoralized by his love for a married woman, Werther takes the only course open to him; he kills himself so that they will meet again. This is high tragedy, apparently, for not only does the adulterous love destroy Werther's life, it ruins his creative talents. "It is a tragedy," he tells William, his correspondent: "My creative powers have been reduced to restless indolence" (64). Yet our view of Werther before he meets Lotte offers the same vision. In the opening letter of the novel, we discover a Werther who is stricken with inertia and who cannot express on paper the wonders surrounding him (24). Moreover, he already carries in his heart a "sweet feeling of freedom" in the knowledge that he can leave the prison of his own body whenever he likes (29). Werther's adulterous passion, then, does not bring on his depression; he is a "tragic figure" from the beginning. His adulterous love, however, does permit him a constant source of injury. Werther is not a victim of love; he loves being the victim. He traps himself in an adulterous affair because suffering is essential to the self-image required by his artistic ambitions. Adultery is rarely successful in Romantic novels, despite the fact that its</page><page sequence="11">The Werther Effect 25 incidence is overwhelming. This fact should tell us that the Romantic is more interested in a problematic of failure and self-pity than in love. Adultery in novels, next to suicide itself, represents the greatest act of self definition because it almost always ends in isolation and injury, and it guarantees that its victim will be able to convert this injury into a position of privilege. The victim of love becomes the victim par excellence. The way that novels present adultery makes this conclusion inescapable. To fall in love with another's spouse or betrothed is one of the surest means available in novels to rebel against society at large and to disappoint oneself. Before Werther meets Lotte, he is warned not to fall in love with her. "And why shouldn't I fall in love with her?" he asks. "Because," he is told, "she is engaged" (34-35). Later, in a moment of anger, Lotte will speak the truth of Werther's attachment to her: "Be more manly! Divert this tragic devotion from a human creature who can only pity you....Don't you see that you are deceiving and ruining yourself on purpose?...Why me of all people, who belongs to another?...! fear that it is just the impossibility of possessing me that makes your desire for me so fascinating" (108). Indeed, why should Werther be captivated by Lotte?—for there is nothing intrinsic to her that should invite this morbid fascination. Whether Lotte is a femme fatale or an innocent is therefore beside the point, for she can be blamed neither for failing to save Werther nor for drowning him in a well of fatal sexuality {pace Kathleen Warrick). Lotte merely holds a position necessary to Werther's self-injury. Whenever he diverges from his path to himself, she calls on him to put it straight. In one episode, he explodes in frustration and emotion at a party, and she scolds him. "I was, please, to think of myself," Werther paraphrases her. "Angel! For you I have to live!" (48). Her love fuels his egoism, and when he first suspects that she loves him, he enters into this love as if it were a cathedral in which to worship himself. She "loves me," Werther says, "and how precious I have become to myself, how I—I can say this to you, who have understanding for such emotions—how I worship at my own altar since I know that she loves me!" (50-51). Werther's stuttering "I" represents in microcosm the entire problematic of the novel. It is a lapse that reveals how "defect" allows him to remain focused on himself, and how other people provide merely the occasion for him to adore his own image. Lotte plays the role of mirror to Werther's soul, just as Nature and God are presented as mirrors. Everything surrounding Werther serves to reflect him and to demonstrate his uniqueness and awesome power. None of this power, however, is wasted on others; Werther, like Rousseau, feeds on himself. My "soul is the mirror of Infinite God," Werther confesses, "but I am ruined by it. I succumb to its magnificence" (25). Notice, incidentally, that this passage is especially effective in revealing Werther's self-divisiveness. In the translation that I have been citing, Catherine Hutter renders Werther's words in the first person, but in reality Goethe has Werther refer to himself in the second person. A modified translation of the full passage would read: "when it grows light before my eyes and the world</page><page sequence="12">26 Tobin Siebers around me and the sky above come to rest wholly within my soul like a beloved, I am filled often with yearning and think, if only you could express it all on paper, everything that is housed so richly and warmly within you, so that it might be the mirror of your soul as your soul is the mirror of Infinite God...ah, my dear friend...but I am ruined by it. I succumb to its magnificence" (25). In effect, the "I" gives birth to an alien half, a second person within it, whose power and god-like qualities both belong to the self and defeat it. To be ruined by one's magnificence is to dramatize one's own genius. The force of this account did not escape the great admirer of Goethe, Gérard de Nerval, whose novella, Aurélia, features a man competing with his double for the affections of his beloved, and whose own self-image is best rendered by the fatal motto, "Je suis l'autre." Genius for the Romantic generation was, of course, always a species of fatality; but we need to question why Romantic genius must attract chaos and pain. Werther underscores the relation between genius and persecution by enacting the process by which a sense of victimization serves fame and intellectual difference. In fact, nearly every one of Werther's statements on genius follows a scene with suicidal or persecutory overtones. In one episode, Werther stumbles on a beautiful landscape and decides to sketch it. His hand mimics his vision perfectly but without any effort on his part, giving him reason to think that genius always surrenders itself to Nature. Indeed, to him, Nature and genius are raging and destructive forces. Would you like to know, Werther asks William, "why genius so rarely breaks its bonds, why it so seldom bursts upon us like a raging torrent to shatter our astounded souls? My friend, it is because of the sober gentlemen who reside on either side of the river, whose precious little summerhouses, tulip beds, and vegetable gardens would be ruined by it, and who know so well how to build dams and divert all such threatening danger in good time" (31). On another occasion, Werther tries to threaten Albert by pressing the mouth of a pistol against his own forehead. Albert lectures him, calling suicide foolishness and madness; "I simply cannot imagine," he explains, "how a man could be so foolish as to shoot himself." Werther, however, grows more incensed. "Oh you sensible people," he cries. "Passion. Inebriation. Madness....I have been drunk more than once, and my passion borders on 'madness, and I regret neither. Because, in my own way, I have learned to understand that all exceptional people who have created something great, something that seemed impossible, have been decried as drunkards or madmen" (58). In his own way, Werther has come to understand something about the relationship of genius to madness, suicide and the violence of sensible people. Marginality has become part of the representation of genius, and one cannot aspire to artistic uniqueness without playing the part, but this very aspiration means that one desires to be mad, suicidal or the victim of intolerance and hatred. The central problem of Werther, then, turns on the affirmation of the self through its negation. The novel repeatedly plays out this process by placing</page><page sequence="13">The Werther Effect 27 an accent on metaphors of the self and its annihilation. These metaphors most often belong to culture at large, but Goethe systematically collects them with an eye to strengthening our vision of Werther's marginality. Usually they are tied in some way to violence, but there exist other marginal images that serve to distinguish the individuals associated with them. Werther's body, we saw, is not a body but a shell to be discarded. Like the view of the self in Lacanian and some ego psychology, Werther's ego seems a prison or enclosure. This is the armored self found throughout Romanticism, in which the self takes on the character of a fortress, a wound or a scab, so burdened is it by injury and victimization. Goethe's own "machinations" on suicide in Dichtung und Wahrheit also use this metaphor. He insists that one kills a machine with a machine, which explains why the unnatural act of killing oneself always turns to "mechanical devices" to put the design into action. Falling on one's sword, as Ajax does, uses the dead weight of one's body as a weapon to meet the point; and the pistol, the most mechanical device of all, "assures quick action with no exertion." All these devices are "external aids," according to Goethe, "enemies with whom man forms an alliance against himself' (Selected Writings 145). The metaphor of the artificial or mechanical self is especially suggestive during a period when industrialization is coming into power; it marginalizes the self by allying it with inhuman devices, but it also appropriates their raw power and difference. Indeed, to ally one's body with the machine is a fantasy whose value for self-representation is demonstrated most successfully in that off shoot of the Romantic fantastic called science fiction, where we discover innumerable images of body and machine conjoined and always as a means to represent ultimate uniqueness, hyperbolic good or evil, and dreams of unchallengeable power. Another use of metaphor found in Werther involves the association of difference and childhood. The metaphor of the child would seem at first glance to offer little to the Romantic self, but it generates, in fact, the required view of the self and its antithesis. Werther consistently allies himself with and compares himself to children because their marginal status in society offers him a way to achieve his aspirations. Children are surrounded in contradiction: they are naturally helpless, but they mirror the helplessness of adults. Little "children," Werther says, "do not know what they want, but no one likes to admit that grown men...can be ruled, just like a child, by cookies, cake, and rod" (28). Moreover, children are selfish and wild in the extreme; yet Werther sees their self-assertiveness as "simple outbursts" (32). Finally, for Werther, children belong to the cult of feeling. We "should treat children as God treats us," Werther resolves, "when He lets us go our way in a transport of delightful illusions." Consequently, it means something when Werther exclaims to William, "we are children!" or "Oh William, what a child I am!" (49). Werther compares himself to children in order to appropriate their unique position in society. The effect of this appropriation is nowhere more apparent than in the</page><page sequence="14">28 Tobin Siebers episode surrounding the children's game played by adults. Lotte instigates the game of "numbers," in which the players must anticipate their number as she pats them on the head. Whoever hesitates or says the wrong number gets a box on the ears. The adults form a circle and some purse their lips and wriggle in happy anticipation of a smacking. Werther is the best narrator in these matters: Lotte "walked the circle with her arms outstretched....Then she began to move faster, and someone missed...ptch !...a box on the ears. That made the fellow sitting next to him laugh...ptch ! ...he got one, too. And faster and faster. I was boxed on the ears twice, and with secret delight felt that she had boxed my ears harder than any of the others" (40). The game for children is a good-natured display of discipline and punishment, and we should not make too much out of it. We should not fail to notice, however, that the episode provides a perfect model for Werther's adulterous strategies. His relationship to Lotte sets him apart, and whenever he transgresses the rules, he receives the great distinction of having his ears boxed the hardest. He rises out of the general crowd, winning this position through injury and transgression. In short, Werther's relationship to Lotte guarantees that he will have a way to distinguish himself from everyone else. Rousseau came to understand that too much personal difference spells disaster, but his followers did not hesitate to embark on the fateful journey. Either they allied themselves with suffering to win distinction, or they discovered that their personal distinction cut them off from the rest of humanity. If consciousness individualizes itself beyond a certain point, it separates itself too radically from other people. It creates nothingness within by creating it without. Activity gives way to passivity, as artists stress their own inner life and melancholy. Amour propre, in Rousseau's terms, supersedes amour de soi or the desire for self-preservation. Likewise, the only meaningful object of reflection is lively melancholy and morbid joy, where death resembles a voluptuous lapse into the infinite. Spiritual isolation becomes a shroud, through which the artist-suicide no longer wishes to see human beings but Nature and God. This is "the disease of the infinite," of which Dürkheim speaks in his analysis of Lamartine's Raphäel (278). Love of Nature apparently justifies suicide, for it enables the Romantic artist to release himself or herself into Nature and to mingle with it. If the self is mechanical, it appears, we must remake it by sacrificing ourselves to that anthropomorphic god called Nature. In fact, however, this action reveals nothing except a self objectified, and a Nature personified. The transports of Nature prevalent during Romanticism, then, belong to the transports of delightful illusions. Natural supernaturalism reveals itself to be a game of voodoo in which objects are substituted for human beings in the mistaken belief that some magic will be the result. Modern criticism has, of course, attacked the undue association between Nature and human feeling under the name of the "pathetic fallacy," but this concept does not go far enough. Although critics understand that human beings see weather and Nature as symbols of their inner turmoil, they have not recognized the</page><page sequence="15">The Werther Effect 29 fact that most natural descriptions in the novels of this period enact the drama of Romantic agony. Natural description both sets the mood of isolation and self-injury for characters and becomes an active means of expressing the social landscape that the Romantic protagonist occupies. We like to believe that the realistic landscape painting of Romanticism expresses a love of Nature and the world, but these paintings often act out a desperate drama in which a solitary entity—a leafless tree, a stone, a church, or a minuscule figure—struggles to distinguish itself against a general background of natural formations. The resting point for the eye, the spot to which the viewer always returns in these paintings, expresses the aspiration of the solitary to attract again and again our attention and to stand out from his or her surroundings. Goethe's use of Ossian may provide a case in point. It is somewhat remarkable that anyone ever believed in the literary hoax; so Romantic is the text that it could only have been a "modern" invention. As Werther's condition declines, Ossian takes Homer's place in his esteem, and the long readings of Ossian, of course, provide much of the atmosphere of the novel. Werther and Lotte cannot play out their emotions in any other way, and so Ossian comes to symbolize their intense feelings. It is obvious why Werther adores Ossian: the text overflows with desolate images and outcries of suffering. It is not at all certain, however, why Lotte should find these descriptions so moving. Clearly, she is not entirely an "innocent" figure but as much a sphinx as a Madonna in Goethe's usage. Whatever the reason, her participation adds fuel to Werther's already excessive passions, while the readings themselves affect Werther because they so successfully serve his self-representation. They also play his game, translating injury into personal distinction and general melodrama. The readings are too long to cite in their entirety, but if we keep in mind that they take up many pages in Werther, we will have some idea of the couple's as well as Goethe's devotion to Ossian. Here is a truncated version of Colma's solitary lament, which the couple reads before Werther's suicide: COLMA: Night has fallen. I am alone and lost on the storm-swept hill. The wind howls down the canyon; no hut protects me from the rain. I have been abandoned on this stormy hill....But I must needs sit here on the rocky banks of the stream, alone. Stream and storm roar, and I cannot hear the voice of my beloved....There is the rock, and there is the tree, and here is the rushing stream. Oh, where has my Salgar lost his way?...I sit in my misery, bathed in my tears, and wait doggedly for the morn. Dig the grave of the dead, my friends, but do not cover it until I am come. Like a dream, my life leaves me—how can I remain behind? Here, beside the stream in the echoing rocks, I shall dwell with my friends.... (113-15) Some parts of the passage read as if they were a description of a Romantic painting—by Caspar David Friedrich, for example. Unlike such paintings, however, this passage provides the narrative that viewers may only imagine—</page><page sequence="16">30 Tobin Siebers indeed, that they must imagine in order to have a satisfactory esthetic experience of the art work. The Ossian quotation tells us why we find a young woman, alone, set out from a background of natural objects, and it tells us what she desires. Moreover, her voice tells us that these objects also are solitary. She contests with them in a struggle for difference, in which she wishes to make her way through their interference to reach, in this case, her beloved. Yet she remains in isolation, set apart, until she can stand it no longer and begins to fantasize her own death as a way of joining someone whom she now presumes to be dead. Like Echo of the classical fable, she intends to be absorbed into the natural landscape and to dwell there with the spirit of Nature. How many Romantic heroines and heroes have expressed this same desire! We should not be surprised, then, that landscapes in Romantic art are haunted by human emotions and aspirations and that they serve so well to map out the desires of characters. These landscapes are charged with the desire for and loss of individual difference. Goethe's use of various metaphors of marginality, of natural description, and of Ossian lends a moody and fatalistic atmosphere to his novel. These evocations act as scenarios for Werther's claims of persecution. Nevertheless, the scene that ends by having the most effect on readers is written by Werther himself. Werther is a poète manqué, of course, and his attempts demonstrate little artistic talent: his only real artistic achievements are a handful of sketches and his translation of Ossian. His diary, however, does include what must be called his "masterpiece," and, appropriately, this masterpiece is a suicide note addressed to Lotte. Several strange factors surrounding the farewell letter are worth remarking from the outset. First, Goethe intersperses the suicide note with other episodes—meetings with people and the readings of Ossian—so that its unveiling in the novel consumes many pages. It also takes Werther several days to compose the letter, and the dates are significant for his claims to uniqueness. The opening entry of the letter is dated December 21st, after which the dating of the entries breaks down; it is clear, however, that Werther's intention is to shoot himself as close to Christmas as possible. Some critics have interpreted this timing as an indication that Werther wishes to give his life to Lotte as a Christmas present. Christmas is a dramatic occasion for someone who wants to represent his or her status as victim. To choose to die on the day when Christ was born is to make a statement about one's relationship to the system called Christianity, and it reveals another attempt to appropriate the victimary status of a cultural figure. Moreover, it is probably no accident that Werther both shoots himself and dies at the meridian, thereby demonstrating once again his liminal status. Second and more important, the suicide letter is read before the action takes place. We are allowed to "discover," so to speak, Werther's suicide note in advance, and this fact lends it even more power and suspense. We should not forget that this reversal is deliberate and quite necessary to the esthetics of the scene of persecution. It is no accident that the letter precedes</page><page sequence="17">The Werther Effect 31 the act in a novel that stresses at every moment that self-destruction is the product of esthetic aspirations; nor is it an accident that this device is used in a Romantic novel, for Romanticism takes its creative force from the estheticization of the victim's position. The situation is almost analogous to Goethe's relation to Rousseau. Rousseau's suffering precedes his representation of it and in some ways makes the representation possible. Goethe does not need to suffer in order to write his novel. The poetics of suffering in both Goethe's life and writing precedes and displaces the act of suffering, and only Werther must die. The text of the suicide note itself, as one would expect, exists to record Werther's suffering. Yet there are suicide notes and there are suicide notes, and Werther's letter clearly strives to be a work of art. It is emblematic of the confusion between the ethical and the esthetic dimensions of suicide that one cannot decide whether the esthetic quality of the letter derives from some intrinsic aspect of Werther's writing or from the moral nature of the action that it forecasts. What is undebatable about the note, however, is Werther's consistent aligning of persecution and literary tropes. He will represent himself in any way that he can to justify his self-destructive action, and his note systematically collects images that serve this intention. The letter paints Werther as sacrificial lamb, as adulterous villain, as sinner, as Christ and as the victim of a jealous husband. The opening entry of the note presents in litany form Werther's desire to die, thereby introducing the religious motif that will guide his self representations. The phrase, "I want to die," tolls four times in the first paragraph. Ironically, Werther writes that he is composing the "note without any romantic exaggeration" (109), whereas it is precisely on a Romantic context that his representations depend for their affect and logic. He describes himself as the recipient of a thousand blows and as the place of a thousand perspectives. At first, he is to be sacrificed and then he expresses his desire to make himself a sacrifice: "I sacrifice myself for you" (110). The logic of sacrifice is indeed critical for Werther's act; it is not the pagan variety, in which a victim is killed by a priest but the Christian variety, in which the victim sacrifices himself or herself. In pagan sacrifice, the death of the victim attests to the existence of a powerful deity, whereas in Christian sacrifice the victim ends by being divine; and it is surely Werther's intention to achieve this god-like autonomy. Sacrifices of this kind are crucial to the Romantic cult of self, for they muster all attention to the individual. Werther can at times call himself a villain and a sinner; he may say that his motivation for suicide is to seek forgiveness. These are, however, all metfns of attracting attention to himself. In the end, he expects to meet his maker and to be honored and comforted by him: "I go on ahead to my Father. To Him I will complain, and He will comfort me until you come, and I fly to meet you and enfold you and remain at your side in the sight of Infinite God in one eternal embrace" (121). Consequently, Werther does not hesitate to drink of the terrible cup; he is</page><page sequence="18">32 Tobin Siebers a Christ who does not suffer the Passion but gladly accepts to die: "Here, Lotte...see, it does not make me shudder to grasp the cold and terrible cup from which I shall drink the transport of death." The point of this sacrifice is not to return him to a community of believers. Rather, he is destined to remain forever alone and marginal. Indeed, Werther requests that his body be buried in isolation from the other graves: "It would be too much to expect a faithful Christian to lie beside a poor unfortunate like me. Oh, how I wish you could bury me by the wayside or in a lonely valley, so that priest and Levite might bless themselves as they pass the stone marker and the Samaritan could shed a tear there" (126). We need to stress the importance of this request. Although it was extremely likely that his body would be set apart because of customs regarding suicides, Werther strives to bend custom to his will, thereby empowering himself and ensuring his own self-sufficiency. The last entries display Werther's great generosity in death. He forgives those who have trespassed against him. He gains Christ-like power, and even forgives Albert. Perhaps this is because Albert lends him his pistols. Werther's note requesting the pistols arrives in the middle of an unpleasant scene between Lotte and her husband—who is in a foul mood, brought on by traveling too much, bad roads, unhappy tidings, and, no doubt, by Werther's constant pestering of Lotte. When Werther's request arrives, then, Albert casually surrenders the pistols, as Lotte's heart sinks. Albert is presented only once in a negative light in the novel, and it is crucial that it be in the scene in which he gives his pistols to the suicidal Werther. Werther has earlier launched a diatribe against the idea of "Husband," and now this husband apparently seeks "revenge" against the transgressor of his family. The scene obscures Werther's egotistical motives and presents him once more as a victim. Werther's generosity in death, therefore, attains its full meaning only as a counterpoint to Albert's "generosity" in surrendering his pistols. Werther plays the forgiving victim to Albert's unthinking and casual victimizer—and thus he dies. As Werther's entry breaks off for the last time, the novel adopts the third person form characteristic of the second part. Werther writes The Sorrows of Young Werther, it seems, with the help of an editor. Yet our glimpse of the editor is limited. It is only in the second part and at the conclusion that he surfaces. The editor continues the narrative and presents the details of Werther's death and burial as well as the reactions of his friends. Despite the arguments of Eric Blackall and Benjamin Bennett for the similarity between the perspectives of Werther and the editor, I would submit that the two perspectives present a stark contrast. The editor is almost Stendhalian in his economy and terseness. Goethe avoids any lengthy discussion of Werther's last moments, or rather his last moments have taken up the entire text, so that the end needs no elaboration. Indeed, as I have been suggesting, Goethe's representation of the suffering suicide does not really need this end because it takes its force from an esthetic system available to him. Thus, the editor writes, "At twelve noon, Werther died" (127).</page><page sequence="19">The Werther Effect 33 Although supposedly an understanding friend—one who comprehends emotions such as Werther experiences—the editor produces a text that is surprisingly condensed and unemotional. His dry and critical prose contrasts sharply with Werther's letter to Lotte and implies, it seems, a criticism of suicide. What is the effect of this conclusion? Does it strive to salvage an optimistic world view and to condemn suicide as a desperate and insane act? Or do the editor's criticisms mirror Werther's own self-destructive urges? If the latter is true, the novel as a whole turns against itself and takes on the double aspect given to Werther's personality: Werther, the novel and the man, are both killed by themselves. "What is man made of," we may ask ourselves with Werther, "that he may reproach himself?" (23). It would be necessary to introduce the issue of self-criticism to appreciate fully what the editor's remarks bring to Goethe's project. For the moment, it suffices to notice that the editor's comments bear witness to the success of Werther's self-representation. Werther's arrangements, the editor explains, silence those attending his funeral. Albert cannot walk behind the bier, and people fear for Lotte's life. Werther is entombed apart, and no priest attends him. No one surrounds him who might interfere with his claim to difference. In short, Werther's action (Werther now being a term that reveals our inability to distinguish between the novel and the character) has the desired effect: Werther attains uniqueness. Whereas those egoistic suicides who try to use self-destruction to monumentalize themselves in the real world almost always fail to attain their goal, Werther does achieve a monumental status in the world of letters. This success derives from the superior power of "esthetics" to organize our sentiments, and its ultimate effect is best judged within the past history of literature and in its future. The success or failure of Werther in the continuing history of literature will rely not on how powerfully readers identify with Werther but on whether they can imagine a position similar to Goethe's: Goethe identified with a character whose beautiful individuality comes from imagining himself as a victim, but he rejected this character as a model for himself. For the esthetics of the novel as a genre—its affective power— will exist as a possibility only as long as there are readers who both identify with characters and resist the temptation to become them.
