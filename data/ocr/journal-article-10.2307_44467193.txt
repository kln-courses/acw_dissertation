DuPont, and Lawrence M. Patrick Wayne State University ABSTRACT A series of rear impact tests of varying severity was performed using a mini pick-up truck with an instrumented Hybrid III dummy at the driver position. Head, neck and chest loads were monitored. The severities of these loads from an injury standpoint were assessed using biomechanically based re- ference criteria that are particularly suit- able for the Hybrid III. The glass in- stallation performed well as a head re- straint. Glass fracture from head impact was achieved only when the glass was predamaged, with surface scratches on the outer (tensile) side. The amazing strength and flexibility of tempered glass and the dramatic reduction in strength caused by small surface scratches are demonstrated. PICK-UP TRUCKS for several years have often been available with a conventional type cab or with an extended, "crew cab" design where there is space for additional passeng- ers or cargo within the cab, behind the front seat. While most all extended-cab trucks have provided front seat head restraints , in conventional cabs such restraints have com- monly been offered only in conjunction with optional, upgraded interior trim packages. (High-back bucket seats are a common ex- ample.) An obvious explanation for these de- sign trends is that the conventional cab rear window offers a measure of head re- straint and thereby precludes the need for utilizing precious cab interior longitu- dinal space for s eat back-mount ed head restraints. With extended-cab occupant packaging the front seatback is not in close proximity to the rear window, con- sequently means other than the window glass are required if head restraint is to be provided. Large occupants find front seat space to be marginal even in full-size domes- tic pick-ups; the sitiuation becomes more critical in the so-called mini pick-ups that have gained widespread popularity in recent years. An effective head restraint should reduce the incidence and severity of neck hyperextension (or rearward bending) over a range of rear-impact collision severities by applying a non-injurious restraining force to the back of the head. (For a number of reasons, it is not realistic to suggest that head restraints should eliminate all hyper- extension injuries.) Furthermore, the re- straint should provide the above function without creating significant safety hazards in other collision modes or significantly compromising the intended function and utili- ty of the vehicle. The effectiveness of the rear window glass in providing head restraint was evaluated for a typical production mini pick-up truck with a conventional type cab. This evaluation was carried-out by first establishing quantitative criteria for assessing the severity of loads applied to the head and (indirectly) to the neck in the subject impact environment. Secondly, full- scale simulated rear-impact collisions were conducted in the laboratory using a suitably- instrumented Hybrid III anthropomorphic dummy in the driver position of the truck. Finally, the data collected in these tests were compared with the injury criteria, thereby enabling conclusions as to the effectiveness of the glass as a restraint. 6.834 0096-736X/ 85/ 9306-0834$02 • 50 Copyright 1983 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">INSTRUMENTED DUMMY The Hybrid III anthropomorphic dummy (1)* was selected as the best known dummy for use in this test program. Of particular importance, the dynamic mechanical response characteristics of the neck in flexion and extension bending are biomechanically based (2). Furthermore, the Hybrid III head is a carry-over from the GM ATD 502 dummy and has realistic geometric and interial properties. Its dynamic re- sponse for free-fall impacts of the fore- head against a rigid, flat surface are based on biomechanical data. These head per- formance criteria have been documented by its developers (3). Of particular im- portance for the use of the dummy in this program, the thickness of the simulated flesh of the Hybrid III head is uniform over the entire skull area. This suggests that the mechanical response of the Hybrid III head for blows to the occipital (rear) region is realistic, since there is evidence that the human head responds in about the same fashion regardless of whether impact is to the front, side or rear (4). Finally, the Hybrid III has a humanlike "slouched" vehicle seated posture and the base of the neck can be adjusted relative to the torso to enable a realistic head orientation relative to the vehicle (1). Instrumentation installed in the dummy for this program enabled monitoring of head and chest accelerations and the bending moment , axial force and shear force at the occipital condyles (or head-neck junction). Details are provided in Table 1. All ac- celerometers were Endevco (R) model 2264. The neck transducer was manufactured by R. A. Denton, Inc. INTERPRETING HEAD ACCELERATIONS Conceptually, a so-called "injury criterion" is a predictive relationship that correlates applied loading to resulting injury. When the criterion has been develop- ed based on human subjects it may be applied directly only in cases where the test subject (typically a dummy) has an acceptable level of biofidelity of dynamic mechanical re- sponse characteristics in the anatomical region where the criterion is applied. The Head Injury Criterion (HIC) has been a popular scheme for predicting the con- sequences of the human head sustaining translational acceleration profiles. There is no need to describe this criterion to the vast majority of anticipated readers of this Paper; however, for those wishing background information Reference (5) should be consulted.

Percent of Population Expected to Experience AIS &gt;4 Brain Injury Due to Frontal Head Impact As A Function of HIC Number. (From Ref. 6) numbers in excess of 1000 s have been judged to be undesirable. Recently a new, more sophisticated approach to analyzing the biomechanical data base for HIC has emerged (6) . The new approach acknowledges that there is variability in human tolerance among individuals and provides a correlation of HIC-number to percent probability of brain injury greater than or equal to AIS = 4. This is depicted in Figure 1. The figure is intuitively satisfying, but it is cautioned that review of this approach by the scientific community is incomplete at this writing. While the Head Injury Criterion has widely been applied regardless of the direction of the blow to the head, the biomechanical data base is for frontal (forehead) impacts. There is no true con- sensus as to acceptable (i.e. noninjurious) HIC-number magnitudes for other impact di- rections; however, most appear to feel that tolerance is a maximum for forehead blows. Brain injury has also been postulated to correlate to head angular acceleration. Most research has concentrated on angular accelerations directed such that sagittal planes rotate about left-right axes (as one would observe for blows to the front or back of the head) . Ommaya and others have long been active in this research. A recent paper by Ommaya (7) offers a "completely speculative" criterion for cerebral con- cussion in man based on scaling of subhuman primate data and the assumption of a linear, elastic undamped single degree-of-freedom system for correlating angular accelerations to angular velocities. Considering this state-of-the-art, it does not seem prudent to utilize angular acceleration as an injury predictor at this time.

Mertz and Patrick (8) tested embalmed adult male human cadaver subjects in a seated posture with their torsos tightly strapped to the seatback. The seat was mounted on a deceleration-type impact sled. With a forward-facing seat , one cadaver sustained a deceleration causing neck flexion sufficiently violent that the e- quivalent* bending moment at the occipital condyles reached a magnitude of 190 N.m. Autopsy revealed that there was no cervical ligament or bone damage as a result of this loading. It is of interest that at the instant of this peak moment there was also a peak shear force at the occipital condyles of 2.0 kN. With a test subject facing rearward on the impact sled, neck extension occurred during deceleration. One cadaver sustained neck extension of sufficient violence that the bending moment at the occipital condyles reached a magnitude of 33.4 N.m. Minor ligament damage between the third and fourth cervical vertebrae resulted. This cadaver was considerably smaller than a 50th per- centile male. Scaling techniques were ap- plied to compute an equivalent 50th per- centile value of 57 N.m. The researchers cautioned that there is no guarantee that muscle injury will not occur at the above levels of flexion and extension loading. Information regarding neck tolerance for axial compression is available from the research of Mertz, Hodgson, Thomas and Nyquist (9). The study involved laboratory simula- tions of impact conditions associated with the incidence of serious neck injuries to high school football players as a result of the so-called "spearing" maneuver. The Hybrid III dummy was used. After consider- able testing and analyses a plot of axial compressive neck force, as a function of its time duration, was developed (Figure 2). This was considered to be the line of de- marcation for the typical adult male (not high school football player) above which there is a "potential for significant neck injury due to axial compressive loading." In Figure 2 the 1.1 kN "threshold line" (for long time durations) stems from aircraft ejection seat research reported by Stapp (11) where the "upward seat ejection safe limit" was suggested to be 20 G. For a helmeted head this implies an axial compressive neck force of about 1.1 kN. An injury reference criterion for neck axial tension is available from the research of Nyquist, Begeman, King and Mertz (10).

One test condition correlated to a 14% probability of an AIS 1 maximum injury severity. The neck axial tensile force ver- sus time data have been analyzed in a similar manner to that for axial compression, de- scribed above. The results are illustrated in Figure 3, and as for tension, represent the demarcation line above which there is a potential for significant neck injury to a typical adult. The figure indicates that axial tensile forces up to 1.1 kN can be tolerated for long time durations. This aspect of the demarcation line stems from the research of Mertz and Patrick (8) where a volunteer was able to subject himself to 1.13 kN without injury. An injury reference criterion for neck shear force in the anterior-posterior direc- tions can also be established using the data of references (10) and (8). A completely analagous procedure to the analysis for axial tension leads to the result il- lustrated in Figure 4. Again, data from the test condition correlating to a 14% pro- bability of AIS 1 injury have been used (10). The long time duration portion of the</page><page sequence="5">6.838 G. W. NYQUIST, ET AL. line of demarcation in Figure 4 stems from the work of Mertz and Patrick (8) where it was demonstrated that a volunteer could tolerate a static shear force of 850 N directed either anteriorally or posterior- ally. While the shear force in the tests of Ref. (10) was directed such that the neck pushed posteriorally on the head, the re- ference criterion of Figure 4 is judged to be acceptable for anteriorally-directed shear force as well, based on anatomical considerations. A finger of bone (the dens) protrudes upward from the second cervical vertebra into the opening between the an- terior and posterior arches of the first cervical vertebra. While the dens is in direct proximity of the anterior arch, there is considerable space between it and the posterior arch. This alignment is maintained by the so-called transverse ligament, which spans across the posterior aspect of the dens, holding it forward against the an- terior arch. Under shear loading such as that present in the tests described in reference (10) the dens pushes against the ligament, straining to move away from the anterior arch, toward the spinal cord. For pure shear loading, the ligament is judged to be the weakest component in the neck structure. Consequently, Figure 4 may be adopted as a conservative injury reference criterion for neck shear forces in both directions. It will be particularly con- servative for shear loads where the neck pushes forward on the head. * FRONT-TO-BACK OR BACK-TO-FRONT 4000 B 8 POTENTIAL FOR OIONIFICANT ft 3100 NECK INJURY 0UE TO AXIAL * 1000 COMPRESSIVE L0A0IN0 ^^^1300 S 1000 a 5 NECK INJURY ^^^hhmbr£°° im0 X UNLIKELY _l ■ I J£ SM 1000 ■ I SM o 10 to M AO M DURATION OF L0A0IN« OVER SIVEN FORCE LEVEL - MILLISECONDS Figure 4.

This type of installation is widely used, and is satisfactory from a performance standpoint. Fig. 5 is a photo- graph from the rear of the vehicle showing the glass installation. Figure 5. Typical Glass Installation. CHARACTERISTICS OF GLASS AND SEAL Tempered glass is used almost exclusively in this country and abroad for rear and side windows in trucks and automobiles. It is considerably stronger than annealed glass and breaks into relatively small particles with edges that are not as sharp as those of annealed glass. Due to its greater strength, tempered glass can with- stand stresses induced by slamming doors, etc and in the case of truck rear windows , can survive cargo impacts to a greater extent than annealed glass. Increased strength is achieved by inducing compression stresses on the two glass surfaces. Glass is weak in tension and strong in compression. By pre- stressing the layers of glass near the sur- face into compression, when a bending load is applied the convex (tension) side is in compression initially, so the induced bending stress must reach the quiescent compression stress before the surface layer goes into tension. In other words, the bending stress on the tension side must be greater than the inherent compressive stress before the glass will fracture. Tempering is achieved by rapidly cooling the two surfaces of the glass with a series of air jets. This causes the surfaces to cool and contract while the interior is still relatively hot. As the interior then cools and contracts it shrinks, causing the surface to go into compression. Glass is generally considered to be tempered if the surface compression is greater than 70 mPa. Tempered automotive glass usually has a considerably higher compressive stress with 170 mPa not uncommon. Glass and seals used in this program were purchased from a vehicle dealer to</page><page sequence="6">Figure 6. Rubber Seal Cross Section. TRUCK REAR WINDOW 6.839 insure that they were the same as those installed at the factory (Fig. 5). The cross section of the seal (Fig. 6) is the shape of an asymmetric H. For installation the seal is first placed on the glass, followed by installation of a cord between uprights of the H, around the periphery. The glass and seal are then held against the outside of the window opening while the cord is pulled from inside. As the cord is pulled out of the groove in the seal, it pulls the inside upright over the pinch weld of the window frame to complete the installation. STATIC STRENGTH OF REAR WINDOW GLASS Static strength of the glass was de- termined by a three-point bending test as shown in Fig. 7. The glass was placed on two wooden fulcrums spaced 1.02 m apart on a rigid platform mounted on the base of a universal testing machine. The load was applied to the glass at the center of the span through a 10 mm diameter rod (covered with 2 mm of soft plastic) mounted on a rigid crossbar. The axis of the rod was parallel to the fulcrums. A force trans- ducer, connected to a tape recorder, was mounted between the testing machine cross head and the crossbar. The plastic covered rod loaded the glass to produce a linearly varying bending moment that started at zero at each fulcrum and increased to a maximum at the center, directly under the point of loading. The stress change (b&amp;) at the surface of the glass at fracture as a result of an applied force (P) was calculated using the classical strength of materials formula (MC)/I which for the particular geometry in this case leads to the expression bo m 373.6 P kPa where P is expressed in Newtons. Two static tests were conducted. The first was performed using the glass from later-described dynamic test Nos. 3 through 7. This glass fractured at an applied load of 449 N or a surface stress change of 167.7 MPa. For this test the glass was oriented with the outside surface (as mounted in the truck) facing downward on the fulcrums so it would be in tension during the static loading. A head impact from the inside would result in tension on the outside. Static Test No. 2 was conducted with a new piece of glass taken directly from the sealed plastic container applied by the manufacturer. However, prior to testing, the tension side of the glass was scratched with finger pressure applied to a No. 16 grit silicon carbide abrasive paper. One swipe was made across the glass in each direction under the loading area, parallel to the loading rod. Furthermore, several scratches parallel to the long axis of the glass under the loading area were added. The scratches appeared similar to those seen in glass after long, rough usage in a vehicle. In static Test No. 2 the glass broke at a load of 302 N or a stress change of 112.8 MPa. This 33 percent decrease in stress change at fracture as a result of scratching illustrates the possible strength reduction in tempered glass that can result from surface damage. In both static tests the glass broke into thousands of small particles with di- mensions approximating the glass thickness. They were typical in size and shape of broken tempered glass. Figure 7. Glass During Static Test Showing 90 mm Displacement Without Fracture. DYNAMIC CRASH SIMULATION FACILITY The dynamic tests were conducted on WHAM III ( Wayne Horizontal Accelerator Mechanism ) which consists of a sled propelled by a 20 m stroke pneumatic cylinder. The truck was modified slightly by the addition of a 100 mm diameter steel tube "bumper" attached by steel channel sections to the rear frame rails. This tube was in turn attached to the back of the sled with U-bolts. Thus the truck was towed in reverse by the sled up to pre- determined velocity. The sled and truck were then stopped in a predetermined distance by a hydraulic snubber to simulate the accelera- tions experienced in a rear-impact collision.</page><page sequence="7">6.840 G. W. NYQUIST, ET AL. The Hybrid III dummy was seated in the driver position with the hands lightly taped to the steering wheel. The seat was adjusted to the full-rear position (seatback upper crossbar in contact with rear wall of cab). For Tests 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 9 the back of the dummy head was 100 mm from the glass , simu- lating a normal seated posture, while in Tests 5, 6 and 7 the dummy was deliberately seated leaning forward (up to 485 mm head-to- glass) to maximize the head impact severity. Truck velocity changes ranged from 15.0 to 25.3 km/h with a constant 190 mm stopping distance. Setup details are listed in Table 2. High-speed cinematography was utilized to provide visual documentation of the dummy kinematics relative to the vehicle during the simulated collisions. In all tests a lateral, onboard camera was mounted at the passenger side door opening, perpendicular to the dummy motion. This provided a good view of the head closing-in and impacting the rear window glass. A forward-facing onboard camera mounted at the left, rear top area of the pick-up cargo box was also utilized in all cases. It provided good coverage to document that lateral motions of the dummy were negligible. Furthermore, it afforded a view of the back of the dummy's head pressing against the glass, as well as dramatic coverage of the fracturing of the glass and subsequent dispersal of particles as the head drove them rearward in the one fracture-producing test. A stationary (offboard) lateral camera was included in the final two tests, as well as a hand-held real-time camera to provide a panoramic overview of the simulated collision event. A stopping distance of 190 mm was utilized throughout the test program. This distance represents an approximation of the forward displacement the truck would be expected to sustain while undergoing its velocity change upon being struck in the rear, while at rest, by a typical full-size domestic early-seventies passenger car traveling at approximately 16 km/h. Tests at higher velocities with this same 190 mm stopping distance represent far more severe acceleration profiles (and consequently higher head-to-glass relative velocities) than would be expected in a typical field collision where the truck sustained such a velocity change. TEST RESULTS A series of nine impact tests was con- ducted. Table 2 provides a summary of the impact conditions, rear window hardware and resulting damage to the window installation as a consequence of head impact to the glass. The initial point of contact of the back of the head to the glass (determined from high-speed films) is also listed. Figure 8 illustrates a typical dummy in- stallation in the vehicle prior to impact, and Figure 9 is a typical example of the deceleration profile of the vehicle. In the lower severity impacts (such as those of Tests 1 and 8) there was essential- ly no damage to the vehicle (other than at the rear window area) as a result of in- ertial loading of the structural members due to the mass of the vehicle itself or as a result of occupant loading rearward through the seat. The one exception is that at such severities the lower crossbar of the seatback frame was noted to sustain permanent rearward deformation of about 60 mm directly behind the dummy. At the higher severity impacts (Tests 6, 7 and 9) significant vehicle struc- tural deformations were beginning to appear as a result of both inertial loading from the vehicle mass and occupant loading of the cab rear wall through the seatback. The rear frame rails sustained sufficient permanent deformation to cause a modest convex longi- tudinal mode of bending of the cargo box load floor. Furthermore, the seatback had pushed rearward against the cab rear wall with sufficient force to cause beam buckling of the window sill structure and concomitant rearward bowing of the sheet metal below the sill. While the permanent deformation of the wall had a magnitude of only about 30 mm, dynamically the amplitude had been sufficient to initiate rearward bending permanent de- formation of the forward end of the cargo box. These results were observed for each of the two trucks (same manufacturer and model year) evaluated in this test program. Figure 8. Typical Dummy Installation in Vehicle. Figure 9.

While there is insufficient space to include all of the individual data traces, a few examples are provided for the first test. Figures 10, 11, 12 and 13 show the temporal profiles for head resultant acceleration and neck axial force, shear force and bending moment , respectively. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS The results suggest that the higher severity vehicle impacts (nominally 25 km/h velocity change with a vehicle displacement of 190 mm) were approaching the maximum realizable rear impact severity from the standpoint of an occupant, since gross structural yielding (with a concomitant decrease in truck cab acceleration during Figure 10. Resultant Acceleration at Head C. G. (Test No. 1) Figure 11. Neck Axial Force. (Test No. 1) Figure 12. Neck Shear Force. (Test No. 1) Figure 13. Neck Bending Moment. (Test No. 1) the time that this velocity change occurs) appeared to be close at hand. Under this near-maximum severity condition, even with the test dummy initially leaning forward (Tests 6 and 7) so that the head-to-glass impact velocity would be maximized, fracture of the rear window glass was not achieved. On the other hand, glass with scratches on the external surface (Test 8) fractured readily at 17.5 km/h even though the head was only 100 mm away prior to vehicle de- celeration. This same piece of glass, prior to scratching, had survived at 23.8 km/h in Test 2. This is consistent with the earlier described static tests, where scratches on tempered glass had a dramatic effect on its load-carrying capability. Regarding the structural performance of the vehicle, while our primary interest in this paper is to report on the performance of the rear window glass installation as a head restraint , it is worth noting that the loading to the occupant was mitigated as a result of seat- back and cab rear wall elastic and plastic</page><page sequence="11">6.844 G. W. NYQUIST, ET AL. deformations. These deformations occurred without weld separations, etc, thus provid- ing effective use of the structure for increasing the distance over which the occupant undergoes the inevitable velocity change. All of the tests were performed with the seat adjusted in its rear-most position, in which case the seatback upper crossbar was in contact with the rear wall of the cab. This leads one to question what would occur in a test with the seat in one of its more forward positions, where presumably the rear window would offer less restraint against neck hyperextension. While no data are at hand, it is speculated that the results would be similar to those for tests where the dummy was initially leaning forward. It is thought that the seatback would yield rearward, as a result of upper torso loading, prior to the development of significant neck extension. Seatback ramping (i.e. torso sliding upward along the reclined seatback) never occurred in this test program. This may be attributed to two features of the design. First, the seatback was initially steep (i.e. near to being vertical) compared to typical passenger cars. Secondly, yielding of the seatback lower crossbar at moderate levels of occupant loading provided a mechanism to orient the seatback (locally, behind the occupant) even closer to vertical during a rear-impact event. This latter phenomenon would have a signifi- cant effect in mitigating any tendency for ramping as the seatback bends rearward in cases where the seat is forward on the track, since the rearward displacement of the lower torso relative to the seat assembly as a result of lower crossbar deformation is considerable. This tends to keep the torso in an upright posture. The dummy loads summarized in Table 3 may be compared with the injury reference criteria discussed earlier in the Paper. The largest head HIC-number attained during the program was 223 s for Test No. 9, where the vehicle impact severity was among the highest and the rear window rubber seal was cemented (an abnormal condition) to both the glass and the window frame in an effort to provide a more rigidly affixed glass that would more likely fracture and/or produce a higher severity of head impact. Even so, the HIC- number reached only 22 percent of the commonly-accepted allowable limit of 1000 s. Referring to Figure 1, a value of 223 s correlates to an AIS 4 (or greater) injury probability of well below one-percent , for blows to the forehead. There is no evidence known to the Authors to suggest that human tolerance to occipital blows is so dramatical- ly lower than that for forehead blows that the HIC-numbers of Table 3 provide any reason for concern. While it is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss chest loading, in passing it is mentioned that the chest data of Table 3 do not constitute reason for alarm based on commonly-accepted evaluation criteria. The bending moment peaks listed in Table 3 are all below the earlier-discussed re- ference values of 190 N.m flexion and 57 N.m extension. The peak moment of 56 N.m ex- tension for Test No. 6 is the only value that comes close to reaching the reference value. Test No. 6 was the highest-severity vehicle impact , and reference to the data traces indicated that this peak occurred in con- nection with a relatively short-duration spike. Furthermore, the neck shear force at this instant was only about 400 N, and was of short duration. This is far below the earlier-described tolerance value for short duration forces (Figure 4) and is a signifi- cant point of interest in conjunction with the extension bending moment, since one theory regarding the occurrence of vertebral dislocations is that high shear loads are necessary simultaneously with high bending moments. (Combined loading is discussed in more detail later.) All of the neck shear force peak values of Table 3 are well below the long-duration limiting value of 850 N in Figure 4. While some of the axial tension and compression force peaks exceed the long-duration limiting value of 1.1 kN (Figures 2,3) they in all cases are associated with waveformes that fall well within the "safe" regions. It is interesting to note from Tables 2 and 3 that partial or cbmplete separation of the seal (and glass) from the window frame did not lead to high neck loads. Apparently, as a result of its inertia, the glass continues to restrain the head while it is being pushed rearward. Significant levels of seal separation never occurred at test speeds below 21 km/h. This is a significant impact severity, in excess of that when identical vehicles of this type collide with a closing speed of 42 km/h. The state-of-the-art in assessing the liklihood of various combinations of simul- taneous loads on the neck to cause injury is in its infancy. At this time no objective, quantitative criteria are available for such determinations. For lack of better criteria, one can suggest that simultaneous bending moments , axial forces and shear forces that are each near the limiting magnitudes, discussed earlier herein, should be avoided. Such high-severity simultaneous loadings did not occur in this test series. CONCLUSIONS The following conclusions are offered based on observations made during the course of this research. Their applicability is limited to the type of vehicle environment evaluated in this program, and should not be</page><page sequence="12">TRUCK REAR WINDOW 6.845 extrapolated to other environments without exercising careful biomechanical engineering judgement. 1. The rear window installation provided an effective contact surface for the head. Head injury as a consequence of impact to the glass is not to be expected for those of normal tolerance, based on presently - accepted tolerance criteria. 2. Up to the highest vehicle rear impact severity evaluated in this research (which appears to provide nearly the maximum possible impact severity for the occupants) the individual neck axial force, shear force and bending moment injury reference criteria were not exceeded. Furthermore, from the standpoint of combined loading, none of these loads were simultaneously near their limiting magnitudes. 3. On the basis of Conclusions 1 and 2, the rear window glass installation is judged to have performed acceptably as a head restraint. 4. Vehicle deformations in proximity of the occupant (seatback, cab rear wall and cargo box forward wall) as a result of occupant loading provided an effective safety feature. These deformations provided signi- ficant increases in the distances over which the occupant sustained the inevitable velo- city changes, thus mitigating the occupant's acceleration magnitudes. 5. Scratches on the exterior surface of the tempered rear window glass significantly reduce its load carrying capability. Glass fracture as a result of head impact was achieved only following the application of scratches (in proximity to the head contact point) with a no. 16 silicon carbide abrasive. 6. The Hybrid III dummy, featuring a load transducer at the head-neck junction, provided an effective means for objectively evaluating the performance of the rear window installa- tion as a head restraint.
