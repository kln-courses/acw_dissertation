<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NEW LATIN PSALTER: AN EXEGETICAL COMMENTARY1 VIII- PSALMS 16 AND 17 Ernest Lussier Ps. 16 A Just and Innocent Man Implores God's Help against Powerful Enemies The title classifies this Psalm as a prayer of David. The pursuit of David in the desert of Maon by Saul and his men (1 Sam. 23:25-26) might well be the occasion supposed in the Psalm. The Davidic origin is cor- roborated by the close relation that exists between this Psalm and Ps. 15.2 The danger, however, in Ps. 15 is chiefly moral; here David is pur- sued by pitiless foes. There is special interest in this Psalm because it deals with the problem of the suffering of the just and broaches the subject of the resurrection of the body and of the beatific vision. David, sure of the integrity of his life, appeals to the omniscient God for justice (w. 1-5). He implores God's help against his enemies (w. 6-9a), and describes their virulence (9b-12). He reiterates his prayer for God's judgment on men who are interested only in the things of this world, and finally voices his hope of seeing God's face (w. 13-15). David's appeal for justice is couched in the bold language of a good conscience, the indispensable condition of earnest prayer (vv. 1-5). V. 1. The cry clamorem is to be understood literally. The Oriental scruples not to use in prayer, shrill, piercing cries expressive of deep emo- tion. The Psalmist is acutely aware that his conscience is clear and that there is no hypocrisy in his prayer. He bases his petition on the omnis- cience of an impartial God, who from His judgment throne in heaven will pass sentence (v. 2). V. 3. The calm solitude of the night is proverbially the time for self- examination (4:5), a time when men appear as they really are (35:5). David is willing to submit to God's scrutiny, to be tried, as it were, by fire in the crucible. In thought, word (v. 3), or deed (v. 4) he has nothing to fear from such a test since he has avoided the example of evil men. God's commandments have always been his rule and his strength (w. 4-5). The ways and the tracks3 are the duties marked out by God. 1 Cf. Catholic Biblical Quarterly , IX (1947) pp. 226-228. 2 The same expressions occur in both Psalms (15:1, 16:8a; 15:1, 16:6a; 15:5b, 16:5a), as also the same ideas (15:8b; 16:7b; 15:11, 16:15). * The Hebrew word for semitis ( ma'gal ) refers literally to tracks made by wagon wheels. 82</page><page sequence="2">The New Latin Psalter 83 After protesting his integrity David invokes God, full of confidence that he will be heard (v. 6). He prays Him to show His wonderful loving- kindness, asking for a special intervention in his behalf as is implied in the word mirabilem (v. 7). He is greatly in need but can rely on God's al- mighty power. Those who seek refuge at God's right, the place of safety (Ps. 15:8), are saved. V. 8. Two beautiful figures describe God's protective care. The pupil of the eye is the center of the organ of vision and therefore is specially precious and specially protected by nature. The apple of the eye there- fore stands for what is most tender and dear, and consequently is guarded with the greatest care (Deut. 32:10). The metaphor of the mother bird sheltering her young under her wings is another Old Testament favorite (Ps. 35:8, 56:2). Christ's allusion to the hen with her brood (Mt. 23:37) comes naturally to one's mind. V. 9b. His foes encircle him with murderous intent. Their hearts are closed to pity and their words dripping with contemptuous arrogance (v. 10). Moral obtuseness is described as a heart enclosed by fat. Vv. 11-13. They surround him watching intently for an opportunity to destroy him. Like wild beasts they approach their prey stealthily, prowling around with slow steps and awaiting a favorable opportunity. The lion is a frequent simile for enemies (7:3, 9B:9). The parallel line (12v) stresses the vigor and fierceness of the foes by referring to a young lion. David now presses the contrast between the contentment of his enemies with material aims and pleasures and his own longing for the closest com- munion with God (13-15). V. 13. The figure of the lion is kept up from verse 12. May God arise, strike the springing lion, and lay him low. V. 14. God Himself is the portion of the godly (16:5), but David's enemies are content with the material and transitory things of this life. According to the New Testament terminology, they are of the world (Jn. 15:19), children of the world (Lk. 16:18); they mind the things of the earth (Phil. 3:19), which passes away (ICor. 7:31). Their wickedness is all the greater because of their ingratitude, for it is from God Himself that they have received everything, blessings sufficient for themselves and their children's children. V. 15. David does not envy the material happiness of his foes; his gaze reaches higher. He is confident that the righteousness which he treasures will finally gain him admittance into the presence of God, where, after his death (cf. Ps. 75:6, Dan. 12:2), he hopes to enjoy the beatifying vision of God (cf. Ps. 15:10-11). This interpretation is confirmed by the implied contrast with verse 14b ( haec vita)} 4 Ita Cales, Bird, Boylan, Lagrange (R.

Yet, we like to stress that it is not substantially different from our own, the difference being merely in the brightness of the revealing light. Liturgical Use Verse 8 is used very aptly as a versicle every night at compline. The Psalm is also used frequently in the Roman missal, especially during Lent. Ps. 17 David's Thanksgiving for Salvation and Victory The title states that the Psalm originally belonged to the choirmaster's collection, and it adds that David, the servant of Yahweh, sang these words to God on the day that God rescued him from the power of all his enemies and from the power of Saul (cf. 2 Kgs. 22:1). The poem appears with many but unimportant variants in 2 Kgs. 22:2- 51, where it is explicitly attributed to David. The Biblical Commission consequently mentions Ps. 17 among those whose Davidic authorship cannot be denied.6 Ps. 17 may well be assigned to the period of peace described in 2 Kgs. 7:lff.6 David had just triumphed over the Philistines and many Aramaic peoples, but had not committed the crimes against Urias, which darkened the last years of his reign. Hence the free and joyous tone of our Psalm and its bold assertions of integrity. The Psalm may be divided into two parts. In the first (vv. 2-31), the divine intervention is praised in a general way. After an introduction, in which he praises God as his helper (w. 2-4), David describes the ex- treme peril in which he was (w. 5-7). Then, poetically under the figure of a theophany (w. 8-16), he tells how God delivered him from enemies who were too strong for him (w. 17-20). Finally, he shows that he was saved because of his integrity, for God rescues the just but humiliates the proud (vv. 21-31). The second part (vv. 32-46) has about the same ideas. God has given David strength and skill for war (vv. 32-35). He helped him in the actual struggle (vv. 36-39), put the enemies to flight (vv. 40- 43), and made him king over his people and supreme among the surround- ing nations (vv. 44-46). In the epilogue (w. 47-51) we have a recapitula- tion of all God's benefits and a renewed expression of gratitude. The Psalm is a magnificient piece of poetry, especially in the theophany (vv. 8-16). 6 Denziger, Enchiridion Symbolorum. (Freiburg. Breisgau; Herder) n. 2133. 6 2 Kgs. ch. 21-24 is an appendix to the book and interrupts the course of the history of David's reign. It is made up of various material for which no suitable place could be found elsewhere.</page><page sequence="4">The New Latin Psalter 85 In the introductory prelude (vv. 2-4) various figures are heaped oiie upon another to express all that God has proved Himself to be to David. The opening invocation (v. 2) is surely one of the noblest utterances of the Old Testament and perhaps the highest point reached by Old Testament devotion. V. 3. God is a cliff, a fortress, a rock, a shield, a horn, a stronghold. These metaphors were, no doubt, suggested to David by his wanderings in the wilderness (1 Kgs. ch. 23-24). Engaddi, in particular, abounds in cliffs and caves and natural strongholds. Cliff and rock are frequently used in the Old Testament to describe the strength, faithfulness, and un- changeableness of God (Ps. 18:15; Deut. 32:4, 15, 18, 31). The horns of animals, especially wild oxen, often stand figuratively in the Bible for irresistible strength. Verse 4a sums up all the titles proclaiming God worthy of all praise. David is fully convinced that God is faithful to answer prayer. He is sure of being saved whenever he calls to Yahweh (4). Vv. 5-7. The perils to which he was exposed receive a highly figurative and impressive description. They are' pictured as waves that break on him and sweep him away, as destructive torrents that threaten to engulf him (v. 5). Death and Sheol are like hunters who entangle him in their nets and enmesh him in their snares (v. 6). In his plight he called repea- tedly to Yahweh, and God, from His palace-temple in heaven, where He sits enthroned, heard the cry of distress (7). Vv. 8-16. The intervention of God against David's enemies is pre- sented as a theophany. Ever since the experience at Sinai (Ex. 19: 16- 18), a terrific storm remained the favorite metaphor of Hebrew writers to represent an appearance or an intervention of God on earth. There are many such descriptions in Scripture (Ps. 28, 96, Jud. 5:4-5, Hab. Ch. 3). Here the phenomena of earthquake and thunderstorm are used to ex- press God's anger, judgment, and punishment of the enemies. We witness first the earthquake (v. 8, cf. also v. 16), then the distant lightning (v. 9), the gathering darkness of the storm (w, 10-12), and the final outburst of all its fury (w. 13-16). V. 8. The earth is imagined as a vast building. It sways and quakes till the very mountains quiver before God's anger, the justice which moves Him to judgment. V. 9. By a bold anthropomorphism God is represented as a panting and snorting infuriated animal. Smoke fumes through His nostrils, His breath is like a scorching fire which makes blazing coals of whatever it reaches. Fire is the constant emblem of God's consuming wrath, and here is sug- gested by the distant lightning. The dark storm clouds hanging low over the earth are pictured as God's footstool and symbolize the mystery and awfulness of His coming (10).</page><page sequence="5">86 The New Latin Psalter God swoops down upon the wings of the wind, as it were, on flying cherubim (II).7 The clouds and the winds constitute God's throne chariot on which He descends to earth, while the darkness of the dense rain clouds shrouds His appalling majesty (12). Cherubim supported the mercy-seat or cover- ing of the Ark (Ex. 37 :8-9, 2 Kgs. 6 :2) upon which rested the Shekinah or mystic presence of God in the cloud of glory (Ex. 25:22, 3 Kgs. 8:10-11, Hebr. 9:5). God is then frequently (Ps. 79:2, 89:1) presented as riding upon the cherubim as upon a living throne.8 The flashes of lightning are described as the brightness of God's face, which kindles live coals (13); the thunder is the terrifying voice of the Most High, the title of God as supreme Master of the universe (14). God shoots His arrows, an abundance of lightning flashes, and puts the enemies (cf. v. 4) to flight (15). In verse 16 the phenomena of the earthquake or hurricane are again (cf. v. 8) described. At the threat of Yahweh, at the blast of His wrath, the waters of the sea retreat, its bed is seen, and the earth's foundations are laid bare. The whole description (8-16) underlines God's great majesty and power. The deliverance is now described (w. 17-20). God reached down and caught hold of the sinking man, and drew him out of the engulfing waters (cf. v. 5), the peril to which he was exposed (v. 17). Verse 18 discards figures; David was rescued from a very powerful enemy and from haters far too strong for him. The reference to Saul and his partisans is quite transparent. V. 19. Without God's help David could not possibly have escaped. But Yahweh became his stay and led him from the straits of peril to the open space of safety (cf. Ps. 4:2). God saved David because He loved His faithful servant (v. 20). This becomes the leading thought of the rest of the Psalm. Vv. 21-24. David insists that he was saved because of the integrity of his life, and his testimony is corroborated by that of God (3 Kgs. 14:8) and of history (3 Kgs. 11-4, 15:5). This, of course, refers not to absolute in- nocence, sinless righteousness, but to the general tenor of David's life. Even his great sin was followed by swift repentance (2 Kgs. 12:13). Much of verse 21 is repeated in verse 25. Sin is described as a separation from God (22b). Verses 25-28 lay down in bold and striking form the law of God's deal- ings with men. God's action is and must be conditioned by man's attitude toward Him. The pious man (chasid cf. Ps. 4:3), the one who practices dutiful love toward God and his neighbor, will himself experience God's 7 Cherub here is a collective singular. 8 On cherubim cf. Dhorme and Vincent, "Les Chérubins," Revue Biblique , vol. 35 (1926) pp. 328-358, 481-495; see especially p. 488.</page><page sequence="6">The New Latin Psalter 87 lovingkindness.9 Single hearted devotion will find in God a response of unfaltering fidelity (26). V. 27. The pure are those who seek God with purity of intention and simplicity of purpose. God shows Himself at one with them, illuminating and encouraging them. Mt. 5 :8 gives an excellent commentary of this idea. The crafty man ( versutum ) is the one whose moral character is distorted. Providence sooner or later crosses the one who is at cross purposes with righteousness. His plans will be frustrated and his wickedness punished (v. 27b). The proud especially will be punished whereas the humble will be blessed (v. 28). The general principles enunciated in verses 25-28 have been verified in David's case (vv. 29-31). God lights his lamp and makes his darkness shine (v. 29). The figure of light or darkness for prosperity or adversity, physical as here or moral as elsewhere especially in Saint John, this figure is common in Scripture, and one of the forms it takes is that of the lamp. In a well-ordered house a lamp burned all night as a sign of life and pros- perity; its extinction marked calamity (Prov. 31:18). By God's help David charges against hostile troops and scales fortress walls (v. 30) (cf. 1 Kgs. 30:8-10, 2 Kgs. 5:6-8). God's providential ways are flawless; His promises refined like pure gold or silver (Ps. 11:7) with- out the dross of uncertainty or insincerity; His defense sure (v. 31). The second part of the poem (vv. 32-46) develops the same ideas as the first. All that he is, David owes to God alone. God gave him physical strength and skill for war (vv. 32-35), yet it was not these gifts which saved the king and made him victorious; it was Yahweh's care and help (w. 36-39) which gave him victory over all his enemies (vv. 40-46). Yahweh alone is to be feared and reverenced, He alone is a sure refuge (v. 32). He has guided David with strength and cleared the path before him, removing all the obstacles which might have hindered him in the com- plete accomplishment of his special vocation (33). The gathering of the robe with a belt was a necessary preparation for work (Prov. 31 :17). Here the cincture is strength, clearly the symbol of resolute and energetic action. God made his king swift and sure-footed as a deer, and set him firmly on the heights, the mountain stronghold essential for the possession of the land (v. 34). He trained his hands for battle, till David could bend a bow of bronze (v. 35). The ability to bend a metal bow stands as a sign of surpassing strength.10 9 The new Latin translation eliminates the occasion for distorting this text, as was done too frequently when preachers had the Vulgate before their eyes : Cum saneio sanctus eris et cum 'perverso perverteris. The text has no allusion to the good or bad effects of good or bad company, an idea partly expressed by St. Paul, 1 Cor. 15:33. 10 Homer s Odyssey, book 21, line 409, mentions Ulysses bow which the hero alone could bend.</page><page sequence="7">88 The New Latin Psalter God shielded the Psalmist with His aid. It was God's strong right hand which stopped David from falling, God's condescension which changed a humble shepherd boy into a great king (36). God cleared the road before His servant, giving him the power to advance with firm, unwavering steps (v. 37). David was thus enabled to chase his foes and overtake them. He never turned back until he had destroyed them completely (v. 38). They were so crushed that they lay prostrate under his feet (vv. 39-40). Yahweh scattered those who hated His king (v. 41). They cried to Him for help but got no answer (v. 42). They were dispersed like dust before the wind and trampled down like mud in the street (v. 43). The mention of Yahweh seems to show that David has Hebrew enemies in mind. He- brews are still in question in v. 44a; the transition to foreigners is made in v. 44b. God has not only freed His king from civil disorders, but also made him supreme among the neighboring peoples (v. 44). Nations from afar (cf. 2 Kgs. 8:9) sent in messages of submission at the mere report of David's prowess and conquests. They came cringing to him, and pale with fright, crept trembling from their fortresses (w. 45-46). The epilogue (w. 47-51), a grateful recapitulation of God's benefits, serves as a doxology. Long live Yahweh, and may He be glorified with praise (v. 47). He has avenged His servant and subjected the peoples to him (v. 48), delivering him in particular from a violent man (v. 49). This last remark is naturally regarded as a reference to Saul, as in v. 18a. No- tice that the power of avenging evil is a divine prerogative (Ps. 93:1), and has in it no personal vindictiveness; its only object is the vindication of righteousness and integrity. V. 50. David Will not confine within the narrow limits of Israel the cele- bration of God's faithfulness. This verse is quoted in Rom. 15:9 as fore- shadowing the call of the Gentiles. V. 51. God has given great victories to His king and shown him great kindness. This is a sample of the special care which He will take of David's dynasty forever. David thus sums up the lessons of his life in the light of the great promise made to him by Nathan (2 Kgs. 7:12-16). These last words which reach forward to the Messias, the son of David, suggest that the whole poem is messianic in its typical sense. The just and innocent David hunted down and persecuted by his enemies and finally victorious over them, easily brings to our mind David's distinguished ancestor, the one in whom David was blessed by God.11 Liturgical Use This long Psalm is recited in the breviary only in its rank, on Monday at Matins. Several verses are used in the Roman missal. 11 Ita Cales, Fillion, Lusseau-Collomb, Pannier, Weber.</page></plain_text>
