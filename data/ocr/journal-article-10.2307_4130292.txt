In the limited critical literature on Browne's natural his- tory, this author is generally seen as stumbling towards a zoological idiom and clearing away the emblematic 'clutter' of earlier writers on natural history-Gesner, Aldrovandi, Topsell or Franzius. This essay proposes that Browne is working with a more complex set of co-ordinates in his thought, beyond his experimental inclinations and his Aristote- lian assumptions. It will explore the extent to which his studies of animals emerge from, and duplicate, the presumptions of his biblical hermeneutics, and it will suggest that Browne regularly exports terms from scriptural exegesis-the categories of the literal, the figurative, and the emblematic-into his investigations of the natural world. Keywords Thomas Browne (1605-1682), 17th century natural history, natural history and biblical exe- gesis, 17th century science and literature Wolfgang Franzius, writing in his 1612 Historia animalium sacra, notes certain analogies between the habits of scholars and those of bears. A bear, as any Renaissance naturalist would know, gives birth to a mere fleshy lump, which it must then lick into the shape of a cub. *) Earlier versions of this essay were presented at the European Science Foundation meeting in Nijmegen and the Emphasis Seminar, London.

Bear licking a cub into shape, from Horapollo, De sacris notis et sculpturis libri duo [= Hieroglyphica] (Paris: Jacques Kerver, 1551), p. 180; the engraving, attributed to Jean Cousin, is taken over from the 1543 French translation of Horapollo's text. Franzius observes the equivalent practice in "scholastic and Philosophi- cal life ... thus it is most commonly amongst scholars, the first thing that is put out is not so polite and well digested as the next is." Having 'dis- covered' the analogy, Franzius goes on to locate nine other similarities between bears and scholars (all instantly recognisable), for example: "as a Bear loveth Caves and Dens, thus scholars love retiredness and secrecy." "As a Bear when he is tyed to a stake, will still be walking round it; thus the Scholar delighteth to be in his study and among his Books, spending all his time there."' Every aspect of the bear's natural history-its hunt- ing, its reproduction, its anatomy and its habitat-is subject to such allegoresis. This systematic patterning derives from a world-view where analogies and resemblances are reliable categories of thought. The story of the decline of this intellectual outlook is a familiar one in the history of ideas. John Ray famously prefaced his Ornithology (1678) with a rejec- tion of this approach to animals, a rejection that is often taken as a '~ Wolfgang Franzius (Frantze), Historia animalium sacra (Wittenberg, 1612), trans. N.W., The History ofBrutes (London, 1670), 60. Franzius notes also that the Bible com- pares bears to the Persian monarchy, and on this basis he embarks on a crop of analogies to demonstrate the ways in which this is true. Bears are said to suffer frequently from sore eyes, so the Persians lack 'insight', having "very little skill or insight in Military affairs," 59.</page><page sequence="3">K.

He, together with his co-author, Francis Wil- loughby, has ...wholly omitted what we find in other Authors concerning Homonymous and Syn- onymous words, or the divers names of Birds, Hieroglyphics, Emblems, Morals, Fables, Presages or ought else appertaining to Divinity, Ethics, Grammar, or any sort of Humane Learning.2 The programme that Ray sets out here has been seen as a liberating moment for scientific thought, that ridding oneself of the emblematic somehow 'releases' the conditions for proper observation. This essay explores the nature of animals in Thomas Browne's Pseudo- doxia epidemica (1646) and his relation to emblematic writers such as Franzius. It argues that his extensive writings on animals reveal a com- plex and largely unexpected approach to the natural world, and it explores the extent to which hermeneutical questions are at the forefront of the discussion of natural history. Browne is impressively anomalous: a doctor, a natural historian, a biblical exegete, an antiquarian theorist, experimenter and vivisectionist. These various identities do not even manifest themselves in separate and distinct works, but are rather super- imposed upon each other within single texts, most notably within Pseu- dodoxia epidemica, a text that has consistently baffled attempts to place it within Browne's oeuvre. It is his most ambitious work, monumental in scope and continually updated through its six editions in Browne's life- time. It is the work upon which his scientific reputation is most solidly based, with its repeated experimentalism, its engagement with natural history and its fitful Baconianism, but it is also a work that ranges well beyond natural philosophy, occasionally venturing into the mystical- sceptic voice of The Garden of Cyrus, and frequently addressing the reli- gious conundra of Religio medici. So wide a range of approaches and the diversity of subject matter found in Pseudodoxia is not, however, testa- ment only to his personal idiosyncrasies, but also to the fluid and unset- tled nature of the various philosophical and methodological practices 2) John Ray and Francis Willoughby, The Ornithology of Francis Willughby [sic] (Lon- don, 1678), preface, sig.

Browne, in such a view, is stumbling towards a zoologi- cal idiom, which he partly attains and partly fails to attain. His account of vulgar and learned errors relating to animals ranges from the empirical to the fantastical, from anatomical precision to discussions "Of the piss- ing of toads," "Of the unicorn's horn" or "That the Chameleon lives only by air," and they have been collectively described as looking like "titles for a set of limericks by Edward Lear."4 The primary argument presented here is that while Browne does, by and large, exclude the iconographical and emblematic elements of the animals he discusses, the 'biological' is not the residual frame of reference, emerging in the absence of "hiero- glyphs, emblems and morals." Much of what is ascribed to his empirical impulses in natural history arises rather from a set of exegetical concerns, and I will trace the arguments of certain contemporaries who assessed and attacked him on precisely these hermeneutic grounds. The essay goes on to look at the symbiotic relationship between his interpretative strat- egies in natural history and in biblical exposition. Together these argu- ments serve to complicate ideas and models of what constitutes 'old' and 'new' science, and the inadequacy of such terms. The intellectual framework in which affinities, analogies and resem- blances constitute a serious mode of thought was described by Michel Foucault as the 'Renaissance episteme'. William Ashworth, adding some historical flesh to Foucault's much maligned skeleton periodisation, 3) The recent work by Claire Preston is a wonderful account ofBrowne's output, but deals with Pseudodoxia in terms of its structure rather than its labyrinthine contents, see Claire Preston, Thomas Browne and the Writing ofEarly Modern Science (Cambridge, 2005).

The entire semiotic field of an animal comes together, including its iconographic and moral 'meaning'. To embark on the mere physical description in isolation from other facets of the animal would constitute a neglect of the full discur- sive meaning of the animal. Browne is taken as an early example of those who have cleared away the cumbersome overload of information regard- ing animals: Browne clearly has a different view of nature from Aldrovandi; he is uninterested in aphorisms or emblems that are not true ... he subjected the literary tradition to the test of empirical evidence ... For Browne, animal symbolism was no longer a part of the study of nature, because it had no basis in truth. " For Ashworth, Browne is differentiated from these earlier approaches to natural history on the grounds of his 'antiquarian sensibility', whereby animals shared a stage in the seventeenth-century Wunderkammer with coins, artifacts and rarities, and become thereby susceptible to similar modes of investigation.7 5) William B.

Killeen /Early Science and Medicine 12 (2007) 1-27 While it may be right that Browne has pared away the 'emblems, mor- als and fables' however, the creature remaining in his pages is far from the sleekly anatomical animal suggested by accounts of Browne that focus on his modernity. At least one contemporary response to Pseudo- doxia sees it as wholly enmeshed in Renaissance natural history. Alexan- der Ross, in his Arcana Microcosmi (1652), accuses Browne of taking much of his animal material from Wolfgang Franzius' text, translated as The History ofBrutes, a work which at a glance would appear so very dif- ferent from Pseudodoxia that it seems worth pursuing what similarity Ross saw between them.8 Ross says: The doctor quarrels with some pictures ... but for this he hath not great reason; for Franzius (de animalib.) to whom he is beholden for much of his matter, tels him that this and divers other pictures are rather Hieroglyphical and Emblematic then truly historicall.9 This is, I think, an important complaint that suggests Browne is almost deliberately misinterpreting his material, that he is failing as an exegete, and that he is a bad reader of the hieroglyphic and emblematic forms that he finds in Franzius. It is important because these terms-the emblematic and the historical-are ones that Browne so frequently uses in exploring error. He makes great play in the early chapters of Pseudo- doxia on the exegetical ineptitude of the vulgar rabble, and their inability to discern the higher levels of scriptural meaning: And so from this ground in the Lecture of holy Scripture, their apprehensions, are commonly confined unto the literall sence of the text, from whence have ensued [1928-1931] (London, 1964), vol. 3.

For not attaining the deuteroscopy, and sec- ond intention of the words, they are faine to omit the superconsequencies, coher- encies, figures, or tropologies, and are not sometime perswaded by fire beyond their literalities.'0 Within the context of the first book of Pseudodoxia, this distinction of literal and 'deuteroscopic' levels of meaning refers to biblical exegesis and the ongoing battles over misuse of and misinterpretation of the Bible, a topic whose political and intellectual ramifications are extensive in the period of the civil war and scientific revolution-interpretation of the Bible always carries a social charge in the era, and this remains true when the terms of exegesis, its analytical tools, are exported into other disci- plines. For Browne, the practice of mistaking the 'deuteroscopy' (a term encompassing allegorical, hieroglyphical and emblematic understand- ing) for the literal meaning is one that pervades his account of error and animals. That error in disciplines as diverse as natural history and scrip- tural exegesis should have the same root is by no means coincidental-the adaptability and prestige of biblical exegesis as a tool of enquiry made it a distinctly attractive mode of thought for early modern natural philoso- phy." Ross' criticism of Browne, then, is less evidence of scientific backwardness than it is typical of the hermeneutic concerns that perme- ate natural philosophy in the period. To establish what Ross has in mind in the quotation above and to establish the validity of his complaint, it is useful to compare Browne's practice with an emblematist such as Fran- zius, whom Browne is usually firmly distinguished from. Their respective accounts of the elephant is a useful place to begin, demonstrating, as it does, Browne at his most modern and Franzius at his most emblematic. Franzius' Natural History spans from the anatomically detailed to the whimsically fantastic with only a minimal critical evaluation on how 10) See, e.g. Pseudodoxia, 1.3 (p. 16). 'Deuteroscopy' was perceived as being a specifically exegetical term in the annotations of Dean Christopher Wren (the father of the archi- tect) to Pseudodoxia, who glosses the word as meaning the levels of the 'fourfold method' beyond the literal, i.e. the allegorical, tropological and anagogical. These annotations are quoted extensively in Sir Thomas Browne's Works, ed. Simon Wilkin (1835-1836), II: 194. 1) This is evident in a forthcoming collection of essays on the inter-relations of exegesis and science, Kevin Killeen and Peter Forshaw (eds.), The Word and the World: Biblical Exegesis and Early Modern Science (Basingstoke, 2007).</page><page sequence="8">8 K. Killeen /Early Science and Medicine 12 (2007) 1-27 is accounted for in terms of humors and physiology; the dragon, being of a hot nature, enjoys sucking the cooling blood of the elephant, although the gluttonous nature of dragons leads them to "drink untill they burst themselves" or till the elephant falls on the dragon, killing it.'4 Edward Topsell's account is similarly graphic: the Dragons being not ignorant that the Elephants feed upon the fruits and leaves of green trees, do secretly convey themselves into them or to the tops of rocks: cov- ering their hinder parts with leaves ... when the Elephant cometh to crop the top of the tree, she leapeth into his face and diggeth out his eyes, and because that revenge of malice is too little to satisfie a Serpent, she twineth her gable like body about the throat of the amazed Elephant, and so strangleth him to death.15 The evident gendering in such a passage, with her twining her gable-like body around the elephant, hints at the homiletic uses of animals, a topic on which there remains much to be said. Similar moralised accounts occur in John Swan's 1635 hexameron Speculum Mundi or in John John- ston's 1678 Description ofthe Nature ofFour-Footed Beasts.16 Browne's elephant, in contrast, is a set-piece case study of the laws of mammalian anatomy, with not a dragon in sight. Against the 'vulgar' and 'fruitful recurrence' of the twin errors that an elephant has no joints and is unable to lie down, Browne sets out the logical and physiological impossibility of such a belief: 14) Franzius, History ofBrutes, 26. 15) Topsell,History ofFour-footed Beasts, 156. 16) The inclusion of such stories invites reading on the emblematic level, even where it does not signpost itself as such, nor draw any moral conclusion. Unlike Franzius' bare account, John Swan in his 1630s hexameron makes the fabular content of the story somewhat explicit: "A fit emblem this of those who fall whilst they suck the bloud of others, and perish in such gains as are purchased by the harms of those whom they strive to subvert'," John Swan, Speculum Mundi, or a Glass Representing the Face of the World, Whereunto is Added a Discourse of the Creation Together wth a Consideration of Such Things as are Pertinent to Each Dayes Work (Cambridge, 1635), 433. John Johnston, too, a writer cited by Ashworth along with Browne as being one of the earliest natural histo- rians to have purged his work of the fabular, includes the enmity of the elephant and dragon, telling us how the dragon knots itself to its huge prey, or "hides his head in one of the Elephants nostrils:' stopping his breath; John Johnston (Joannes Jonstonus), A Description ofthe Nature ofFour-Footed Beasts, trans.

'true' a fact is. Discussing the elephant, he examines a breathtaking range of material on the biblical Behemoth, its size and strength, its mild tem- perament, its habits and habitat, its cleanliness and parental care, along with a detailed account of how best to hunt, capture and tame the ele- phant. Also included is the kind of anthropomorphic anecdote that so characterises Renaissance natural history. Franzius tells us that "if an Ele- phant be to go to Sea, he will not enter into the ship, unless the master of the ship will swear he shall return again.""2 Topsell, similarly, includes the gloriously random fact the "many times upon the leaves of trees he [the elephant] devoureth Chameleons, whereby he is poisoned and dyeth, if he eat not immediately a wild olive."3 The encyclopaedias of the emblematic writers are omnivorous, devouring every anecdote about the animal. There is, moreover, a seemingly endless elaboration upon these anecdotes. The antipathy between the elephant and dragon, for example, 12) Franzius, History ofBrutes, 22.

Pseudodoxia has pared away much of the 'extraneous' material found in the emblematists. It goes on to support its case on various other grounds-empirical, philological and with the Aristotelian argument of its being "contrary unto the generall contrivance of nature":' Ought we to suppose then that Browne has gone beyond the emblematist compilations of animal lore, that he is more dis- criminating about the truth of facts in natural history? Against this, his apparently credulous entertaining of the idea of elephants talking might be noted, although this may plausibly be seen as Browne's being 'defi- antly paradoxical' or displaying 'disingenuous seriousness'. Brian Cummings, in a recent article, sees Browne's rehearsal of such ideas as calculated 'red herrings' designed to alert the reader to the "affront to human reason" which he is busy perpetrating. 18" However, I would want to change the terms of the question here, and to suggest that the issue of Browne's perspicuity or credulousness is itself the red herring-the question of what he 'believed' is wrongly predi- cated on the idea that the emblematists themselves had a rigid, and for that matter credulous, idea of what was 'true' or that they were largely unable to distinguish between the real and the preposterous. The rambling and random assemblage of animal lore in Gesner or Franzius should not necessarily suggest that levels of meaning (the 'true' or the 'fabular') were indistinguishable in the minds of emblematic natu- 17) Pseudodoxia, 160-161. 18) "That some elephants have not only written whole sentences, as kAlian ocularly testifi- eth, but have also spoken ... wee doe not conceive impossible ...

Killeen /Early Science and Medicine 12 (2007) 1-27 11 ral historians. Charles Raven, in his mid twentieth-century account of natural history, complains of Topsell, for examples, that he has "little aptitude for weighing evidence."19 However, this fundamentally misrep- resents the mode of presentation in emblematic writing, and its human- ist drive to copia. While writers may not signpost the 'true' as a distinct category, there is ample evidence that they could and did distinguish. Regarding the proverbial belief that a mother bear licks its cub into shape, for example, Franzius notes that Scaliger had anatomised preg- nant bears and discovered full-formed cubs, and-just as Browne will show-he argues that the idea of a thick 'skin' or membrane being licked off at birth seems a more accurate account of the truth.20 Having appar- ently disposed of the belief that a bear licks its cub into shape, however, Franzius returns it, in its original form, a few pages on. The bear, we now learn, in the quote I began with, does lick the animal into shape, in so far as it corresponds to the scholarly practice (apparently) of putting out incomplete work which needs still to be licked into shape. First, Franzius demonstrates the belief is not true, but then repeats it, with no proviso or qualification. We might of course take this as evidence of Franzius as a chaotic thinker, but that, I think, misses the point. The return of the belief is possible because it is serving as something of a different currency, when providing emblematic, heuristic or poetic meaning. A myth, an anecdote or a moral lesson from an animal earns its place in a sixteenth- century natural history not because it is 'true' but by virtue of humanist inclusivity, in the urge to collate, encyclopedically, all available facets of an animal's 'history'. Here is Browne explaining why the cub must come forth fully formed, with his curious rhetorical mixture of medical terminology and ornate poetics: ...not only the Dam, but the younglings play their parts, and the cause and act of exclusion proceedeth from them both: for the exclusion of animals is not meerly passive like that of egges, nor the totall action of delivery to be imputed unto the mother; but the first attempt beginneth from the Infant, which at the accomplished 19) Charles Raven, English Naturalistsfrom Neckam to Ray: A Study of the Making of the Modern World (Cambridge, 1947), 221. 20) Franzius, 7he History ofBrutes, 55</page><page sequence="12">12 K. Killeen /Early Science and Medicine 12 (2007) 1-27 period attempteth to change his mansion, and struggling to come forth, dilacerates and breakes those parts which restrained him before.21 Here again we seem to be in the presence of a mind-set utterly different from the emblematists, an urge to anatomical accuracy and truth. How- ever, the evident lack of belief in the story of an unformed bear among writers who nevertheless repeat the tale points to a certain rhetorical chi- canery in Browne-not in relation to his account of bears, which, for all its florid terminology (the bear "attempteth to change his mansion") is flawlessly accurate, but a chicanery in that everybody, it seems, already acknowledges that it is only a figure of speech. When even that master emblematist and copyist, Topsell, denies the belief-he tells us that "the truth is most evidently otherwise," and similar denials are to be found in Jonston, Gesner and Hakewill-it suggests that Browne is not beating out the path of truth, but that he is equally involved with the textual col- lusion by which beast lore retains its 'value' even while being acknowledged false. Browne's apparent errors-and I think this is gener- ally true ofPseudodoxia epidemica--arrive already corrected, so to speak.22 To restate the error is not to drive it away, but to participate in the humanist textual traditions of Franzius and Topsell, a tradition, we might say, which 'performs' rather than 'believes' its errors. Browne is being dis- ingenuous in setting up as genuine battles-for-truth matters so widely acknowledged to be false, which do not really have any 'currency'. It is in this respect that the endlessly irate Alexander Ross compares Browne with Franzius, in the quotation I introduced earlier, and his complaints are perhaps more perceptive than many critics will allow him. His claim is not that Pseudodoxia is poor natural history, or that he is simply 'wrong' about his animal errors, but rather that Browne's strategy in writing about animals shows him to be a bad reader of natural history, of exegetical ineptitude. Ross accuses Browne of failing to negotiate properly the various strata of literal and allegorical meaning within his 21) Pseudodoxia, 3.6 (p. 179). 22) Robin Robbins, in his edition of Browne's Pseudodoxia, notes in that work, for exam- ple, "some 100 echoes" of Hakewill's Apologie, with its list of ancient errors (Pseudodoxia, xxi). See George Hakewill, An Apologie of the Power and Providence of God in the Gov- ernment of the World, or an Examination and Censure of the Common Error touching Natures Perpetuall and Universall Decay (Oxford, 1627).</page><page sequence="13">K. Killeen /Early Science andMedicine 12 (2007) 1-27 13 sources, in particular of Franzius, "to whom he is beholden for much of his matter," who "tels him that this and divers other pictures are rather Hieroglyphical and Emblematic then truly historicall."23 This distinction between the hieroglyphical-emblematic and the historical is significant since Browne repeatedly locates the source of errors in the failure of lit- eral-minded critics to distinguish between allegorical or hieroglyphic meaning and the literal. These categories serve for both natural history and biblical exegesis, and Browne reprimands in both cases the poor exe- getical practice when things "symbolically intended are literally received."24 This is one of the notions which resound through Pseu- dodoxia, that error consists of "translating symbolic figures into real verities."25 So, for example, the Griffin for Browne was originally a hiero- glyph, "a symbolical phancy," standing as an allegory for "the properties of a Guardian, or any person entrusted; the eares implying attention, the wings celerity of execution" and so on, or alternatively, "It is also an Embleme of valour and magnanimity, as being compounded of the Eagle and the Lion." However, this figurative conceit was taken literally and the reality of the animal came to be accepted, according to Browne, even though "if examined by the doctrine of animals, the invention is mon- strous."26 Browne claims, as so often, that the discerning reader must know when to bring secondary, figurative levels of interpretation into play, and that error is the result of vulgar exegetical ineptitude. Ross, responding to such claims of exegetical propriety, suggests that Browne, for all his erudition, is operating a kind of bad faith in so wil- fully mis-representing the sources of his errors, in presuming they are speaking literally when they are not. In particular Ross seeks to redeem Aristotle. He tells us of Browne: "I confesse in his Book he shows much reading and learning'," but that he should not "fasten upon those ancient sages from whom we have our knowledge, more errors than they were guilty of."27 So, in the case of the bear, Ross attacks not Browne's factual claims, but his posturing as a soldier at the frontier of knowledge.

Now upon this to inferre that the ancients meant the young Bears were not at all formed or articulated, till they be licked by their dams is ridiculous: For who will say those wise men were so ignorant, as to think the outward action of the tongue could perform that which could not be effected by the plastick and formative power in the matrix.28 Similarly, in the case of the elephant, Ross claims that Browne has simply misunderstood, or guilefully misrepresented, what the ancients meant: "They meant their joints were stiffe and not so easily flexible as those of other animals."29 Ross chides Browne for being too literal in his under- standing of natural history, of refusing to take the expressions and metaphors of the 'ancients' in a "soft and flexible sense:' a phrase Browne uses in the preface to Religio Medici to beg the reader's indulgence.30 Ross has, in turn, aroused the wrath of generations of Browne scholars for his temerity. Joan Bennett criticises him, saying: "Ross tries to convict Browne of confusing hieroglyphs and emblems with records of fact."31 But this is not what Ross is doing. Browne is being accused in Arcana Microcosmi not of being an inadequate natural historian, of getting his facts wrong, but of being a bad exegete, an unsubtle reader of the litera- ture on animals and of failing to distinguish between the literal and the figurative in the natural historians he reads. Given that these are terms borrowed from biblical exegesis, the charge becomes all the more serious within the context of early modern England with its sensitivities over misuse of exegesis. Debates about old and new science tend to see experimental inclina- tion as the crucial litmus test of modernity, but for both Browne and 28) Ibid., 116. 29) Ibid., 152. 30) Browne,Religio medici, To the Reader.

Killeen /Early Science and Medicine 12 (2007) 1-27 15 Ross, at least as important are a set of questions on reading practices, dis- cerning what constitutes a licit approach to natural history. For Ross, Browne is guilty of the very thing he claims lies at the root of error-just as the 'vulgar' make their errors by failing to discern when a belief is figu- rative and when literal, being unable to distinguish the "deuterosocopy and second intention of the words," so too Browne fails to realise when Franzius or Aristotle are writing emblematically and utilising criteria other than the literal. He acts, according to Ross, as though the emblem- atic animal anecdotes one finds on the pages of Franzius are necessarily evidence of gullibility, whereas for Ross, they represent a particular her- meneutic, which Browne almost wilfully misrepresents. Whether Browne is guilty of such misrepresentation is open to debate, and it should be noted that Browne pays extensive attention to the idea of the hieroglyph and its 'debasement' into literal understanding.32 What is important for my argument is that the debate between Browne and Ross does not represent the poles of old and new science. If the argument here holds, it is particularly satisfying to find Alexan- der Ross being right on something. Ross is a figure whose reputation as pedant, nitpicker and stick-in-the-mud Aristotelian has earned him near- universal derision, since Hobbes' description of him as a 'perpetual barker'.33 Ross has functioned, according to Adrian Johns, as a "stock 32) Instances of errors citied by Browne as hieroglyphics, for example, include: dove (168), beaver (171), bear (178), cockatrice (182), basilisk (186), phoenix (204), viper (225), hieroglyphic diet (267), ring finger (301), dogdays (354), pelican (367), Moses (391), goat (433), apple (538). Egyptian hieroglyphs are also dealt with in their own chapter, 5.20 (pp. 419-20). The provenance and explication of hieroglyphs was something of a Renaissance vogue, following Pierius' edition of the putative fifth-century Horapollo, whom Browne refers to, as 'Orus Apollo', Pseudodoxia, 3.16 (p. 225). 33) SeeJames M. Wise, Sir Thomas Browne's Religio Medici and Two Seventeenth Century Critics (Missouri, 1973), a book-length attack on Ross. The epithet is taken from Hobbes' response to Ross' Leviathan Drawn out with a Hooke (London, 1653). William Dunn calls him the "absurd Alexander Ross," Dunn, Sir Thomas Browne, A Study in Religious Philosophy (Minneapolis, 1950), 150; John Knott calls him the "prickly Alex- ander Ross," in his "Sir Thomas Browne and the Labyrinth of Truth," in Patrides (ed.), Approaches, 19-30, at 20; Leonard Nathanson terms him full of "self-righteous vitupera- tion"; Nathanson, The Strategy of Truth: A Study ofSir 7Thomas Browne (Chicago, 1967), 74; In Bennett, Sir Thomas Browne, 134, he appears as wholly 'confused'.

Ross's output is massive on an incomparable range of subjects, and, as Adrian Johns puts it, somewhat sympathetically: "Unfortunately ... Ross was destined to take the losing side of every sin- gle issue he addressed."35 He is indeed always wrong, almost without fail, so to find an instance to the contrary, to sense that for once he may be right in his criticisms of Browne is heartening. Insulting God: Providence and Its Mechanisms What constitutes a significant 'error' for Browne? Up till now, I have argued that Browne is rehearsing 'errors' that everyone knows are wrong. Such a claim for the humanist scholar and natural historian as voracious consumer is not to say that the work was entirely indiscriminate, but merely that categories of fact-verses-fiction do not structure the natural histories produced in the era.36 Browne's approach to error, as it is char- tion: "his arguments opposing the new scientific ideas revealed a complete ignorance ... of the elementary principles on which all science is founded ... Ross was the last voluble champion of bigoted Aristotelianism in an age that was rapidly moving away from the old scholastic philosophy," Astronomical Thought in Renaissance England: A Study of English Scientific Writingfrom 1500-1645 (Baltimore, 1937), 277, 282. This judgment is quoted (approvingly) in Wise, Browne, 148. Perhaps the most remarkable leap made on the basis of his griping tones is the conclusion reached by numerous critics that Ross was a 'puritan', which seems to function as critical shorthand for 'rather unpleasant'. Characterisations of him as 'puritan' include for example Knott, "Labyrinth of Truth," 23, for whom Ross is part of "the puritan multitude,' and Wise, Browne, 122-168. Nathanson, Strategy of Truth, 65, 74. In fact, Ross was himself denounced as a papist and preached in favour of Laud's "Beauty of Holiness," see Johns, Prudence and Ped- antry, 34. He "retaliated by mounting a second attack on the 'theeves' desecrating the church's 'beautie' and its 'altar'." 34) Adrian Johns, "Prudence and Pedantry in Early Modern Cosmology: The Trade of Al Ross:' History of Science, 36 (1998), 23-59, at 23-24.

Killeen /Early Science andMedicine 12 (2007) 1-27 17 acterised by Ross, fails to acknowledge the sheer inclusivity of the humanist canon, the traditions of exhaustive, scholarly copia, with its textual collusion, in which the hand-me-downs of knowledge are just as acceptable if they are negative as positive. Browne is in one sense a part of this textual collusion, repeating enjoyably unlikely errors, except that he implies his sources are less alert than he to the erroneous status of the beliefs. In this respect it is worth thinking ofPseudodoxia less with an eye to how sharply empirical or reasonable Browne is, than to question why certain errors are serious enough to merit inclusion. Browne's criterion for inclusion is not, at core, whether a belief is false-that alone is not sufficient. The nature of the errors in Browne's 'epidemic' is perhaps made clearer by contrasting them with some from Topsell that did not qualify as vulgar errors. Topsell tells us, for example, that ... if a woman be in sore travail of childe-birthe, let a stone or arrow which hath killed a Man, a Bear or a Bore, be throwne over the house wherein the woman is, and she shall be eased of her pain ... The right eye of a Bear dryed to powder, and hung around childrens necks in a little bag, driveth away the terror of dreams, and both the eyes whole, bound to a mans left arm, easeth a quartain Ague.37 That such errors are ignored by Browne suggests that his text is not intended to be a general minesweeping of falsity. Some errors are clearly more grievous than others.38 Throughout Pseudodoxia, the prime crite- rion seems to be whether the belief serves to denigrate the 'ergonomics' the French Renaissance (Oxford, 1979). On this practice of the humanist natural histori- ans of the sixteenth and seventeenth century, see Ashworth, Emblematic World View. 37) Topsell,History ofFour-footedBeasts, 33-34.

Killeen /Early Science and Medicine 12 (2007) 1-27 of nature, the providential design of animals. Here too, however, there is a distinct concern with scriptural exegesis in how Browne negotiates his errors. If my anachronistic phrase the 'ergonomics' of nature conjures up images of well-designed car seats rather than well-designed animals, I use it because of an ambiguity in the notion of God's 'providence, the term much used in the natural history of the seventeenth century to talk about animals. For Browne, too, 'providence' is a governing refrain of Pseudo- doxia, that nature is providentially or ergonomically structured to allow for no wastage of design and that any account of the natural world that suggests redundant features must be faulty. For example, when Browne addresses the error that the chameleon feeds on air, he refers the anatom- ical dispute to the principle of providential design for its solution. For first, there are found in this animall, the guts, the stomach and other parts offi- call unto nutrition, which were its aliment the empty reception of ayre, their provi- sions had beene superfluous; Now the wisdom of Nature abhorring superfluities, and effecting nothing in vaine, unto the intention of these operations, respectively contriveth the organs; and therefore where we finde such Instruments, wee may with strictness expect their actions, and where we discover them not, wee may with safety conclude the non intention of their operations.39 If the chameleon ate air, then its digestive apparatus would be superflu- ous, and God or Nature could be accused of wastefulness. Browne goes on with an anatomical survey of the mouth which proves that the cha- meleon must eat solids: "beside the remarkable teeth, the tongue of this animall is a second argument to overthrow this ayrie nutrication."40 The tongue is either for producing sound or taste. As chameleons are mute and air tasteless, the use of the tongue "seemeth contrived for prey" with its "mucous and slymy extremity":' Therefore, from observation of the part, it is proved that they eat solid material. These remarkable argu- ments wholly bypass the animal, with the proof emerging from logical necessity; not that an animal must eat to survive, but that, if the air-belief were true, it would possess superfluous bodily parts. Browne has solved the error without reference to the animal, although he tells us, "it is again 39) Pseudodoxia, 3.21 (p. 243). 40) Ibid., 244.</page><page sequence="19">K. Killeen /Early Science andMedicine 12 (2007) 1-27 19 controulable by experience" and he makes reference to Peiresc and Scal- iger, which might, with some justification, be thought of as reliable scientific testimony, as 'virtual witnessing'. We might note, however, that the chameleon is another case in which the error arrives already cor- rected-with Topsell reporting Scaliger's account of the chameleon eating a fly.41 Browne's scientific modernity has often been allied to his reporting of experiment, though it remains, I would contend, secondary throughout Pseudodoxia, valuable as a mode of confirmation but not in itself a suffi- cient practice, even while Browne is a frequent anatomist and vivisec- tionist. To test if glass is poisonous, Browne grinds some up and feeds "dogs above a dram thereof, subtilly powdered in butter and paste, with- out any visible disturbance." He tests a frog's ability to withstand drown- ing: "I find not the experiment answerable; for fastening one about a span under water, it lived almost six days." To confirm Henry Power's finding that snails have eyes "asserted by the help of exquisite Glases" Browne undertakes to "sindge the top thereof with Aqua Fortis, or other corrosive water." Or again, to discover the effects of digestion, "So rusty iron crammed downe the throat of a Cock, will become terse and cleare againe in its gizard."42 But he is also skeptical about the reliability of experiments. Commenting on Francis Bacon's 'Histories' and scientific practice, he says: "Nor is it to be taken strictly which is delivered by the learned Lord Verulam, and referred unto further experiment" (regarding methods to assess precisely the weight of dead bodies). In response to another of Bacon's experiments on the dissolution of iron in aquafortis, Browne tells us: "Hereof we made triall in Scales of good exactnesse, where in if there be a defect, or such as will not turne upon quarter graines, there may be frequent mistakes in experiments of this nature."43 41) Topsell,History ofFour-footed Beasts, 673 42) Pseudodoxia, Dogs experiment (123), Frogs (213), Snails (239), Cock (253). 43) Pseudodoxia, 316-7; see Francis Bacon, Sylva sylvarum, Experiment 789 (London, 1628), 198. Browne's investigation into whether the body weighs more after breathing in (or with a full bladder) is also duplicated by Ross: "I answer, that I could never find this experiment true, though I have made trial:, in Arcana Microcosmi, 100. John Robin- son, another contemporary who authored a response to Pseudodoxia, includes a perti- nent phrasing in response to this, which should put us on our guard as to what precisely was meant by 'experiment'. He tells us of "an ocular Experiment of mine own" in which</page><page sequence="20">20 K. Killeen /Early Science and Medicine 12 (2007) 1-27 Recent studies in the history of science have been less inclined to equate experimentation as, in itself, the benchmark of modernity, following Shapin and Schaffer's Leviathan and the Air Pump, which focused on Hobbes' rationalist denial of experimentation as a valid source of knowl- edge. Rose-Mary Sargent in her work on Boyle's experimentation notes similarly, "that the boundaries set up by Boyle and his contemporaries were not self-evident."" In Pseudodoxia, too, the practice of determining error and truth is not based, at core, on experimentation, which is for Browne conducted in a somewhat haphazard fashion, for all that his mantra of "reason, experiment and authority" is cited as a distinguishing feature of Browne's modernity. It was, in many ways, something of a com- monplace, used also by Alexander Ross and interestingly modified by Jan Amos Comenius, for example, into a founding trio of "sense, reason and scripture."45 Browne, like Ross, conducts experiments almost wholly at the level of confirmation and so as to deny specific facts. Experiment does not underpin his epistemology in any sense, even while he uses and reports it regularly. More important in Pseudodoxia is Browne's focus on beliefs which undermine the providence of God in the design of nature. The idea of the Phoenix "infringeth the Benediction of God concerning multiplica- tion."416 The viper's eating its way out of its mother is "injurious unto the providence of Nature ... and frustrates the great Benediction of God."47 Moles being blind neglects "the providence of this provision" (of eyes).48 Browne is utterly consistent in his reliance on this Galenic (though also Aristotelian) idea that nature does nothing in vain.

[its] excellence of construction."50 In Religio medici, Browne tells us that "in some things there appears to mee as much divinity in Galen his Books De usu partium as in Suarez Metaphysicks," and likewise in Pseudodoxia, Browne conjectures that the loss of the entire humanist canon "where- with our memories being stuffed, our inventions become Pedantic" would be "no losse like that of Galens Library:' a reference to his lost books, destroyed by fire in AD 192.51 Galen is significant for Browne for his model of bodily economy and his underlying theological premise that such ergonomic design could proceed only from God. This is a model that Browne pursues relentlessly in his investigations into animals. In many ways, the curious logic of Browne's argumentation is also dis- tinctly Aristotelian and scholastic, with its emphasis on universal and necessary truths and the subordinate role of empirical evidence. Browne repeatedly uses variations on the formula that "God has proposed the world unto our disputation."52 This tellingly scholastic formulation, in which the natural world is primed for syllogism, sits oddly with Browne's reputation as a consummate figure of modernity, an experimenter, a hunter-down of error and a scourge of slavish adherence to authority. They are roles often seen as antithetical, which can be simultaneously maintained only with some difficulty. However, I want to suggest a third co-ordinate needs to be added into his scientific approach, that is, the role of the Scriptures in his epistemology. To argue for the biblical indebtedness and the Aristotelianism of a seventeenth-century writer might seem to cast him into the whiggish pit of infamy and to banish him from the annals of modernity. But that is not what I intend: I want to suggest that what is at stake in his amalgam of methodologies are the parameters of early modern science, and the manner in which experi- 49) Kenelm Digby, Observations Upon Religio Medici (London, 1643), 24. 50) Galen, On the Usefulness of the Parts of the Body (De usu partium), trans.

Killeen /Early Science and Medicine 12 (2007) 1-27 ment along with Galenic and Aristotelian providentialism are repeatedly assimilated into Browne's scriptural and exegetical priorities. His approach to 'providence' can usefully be distinguished, however, from that of 'physico-theology' which similarly concerns itself, in some ways, with the intricacy and perfection of nature, studied in order to reveal God's handiwork. So for Walter Charleton, the complexity of the body in anatomy reveals a glimpse of God: "when we dissect them, prie into the Entrals, and there survey the almost infinite multitude of organs, principal and subordinate ... all unanimously conspiring to conserve the aeconomy of that Form."53 John Ray's 'physico-theology' surveys the innate knowledge of animals in, for example, nest building, to assert the idea of God's hand in nature.54 Browne, however, performs a contrary strategy, and it seems an important distinction that has not been made in the critical literature. His use of providence is presented not as the out- come of his anatomical observations, as with Ray, but rather as the prem- ise, from which to establish 'facts' of nature. Where Ray's work is a rhapsody of God's design, Browne uses providence as a syllogistic key to solve disputed questions and to establish matters of fact, employing syl- logisms of the order: God would not permit superfluity. A chameleon's tongue would be superfluous if it did not eat. Therefore a chameleon eats. Moreover and importantly, for Browne there is an almost interchange- able status of 'facts' from the natural world and tenets from scripture. They function with roughly equivalent epistemological value. There is a symbiotic interpretative relationship between the bible and nature, so that correct natural philosophy should successfully and coherently expli- cate the bible, while scriptural exegesis should be admitted to arbitrate on disputed questions of nature. Scripture and the natural world are read in an apparently smooth continuum. 53) Walter Charleton, The Darkness ofAtheism dispelled by the Light ofNature: A Physico- Theologicall Treatise (London, 1652), 55. 54) John Ray, The Wisdom of God Manifested in the Works of the Creation (London, 1691). Ray's text is perhaps the best-known exposition of this frequently repeated notion: the knowledge of God from the observation of nature, and the detailed use of observation to substantiate the argument for God from design.

Browne investigates, for example, the twin, intertwined, beliefs "That the female Viper in the act of generation bites off the head of the male, in revenge whereof the young ones eate through the womb and belly of the female.""s His response, as one comes to expect, is that the idea is both "repugnant unto experience and reason" and moreover it is "injuri- ous unto the providence of Nature." It is repugnant, however, not because it is fairly horrible, but because the belief would threaten the internal consistency of scripture, with its unacceptable notion that the female: must regularly perish by multiplication, and these be the fruits of fructifying in the Viper; it cannot be said that God did blesse, but curse this animall; upon thy belly shalt thou goe, and dust shalt thou eat all thy life, was not so great a punishment unto the Serpent after the fall, as encrease, be fruitful and multiply, was before. This were to confound the maledictions of God, and translate the curse of the Woman upon the Serpent; that is, in doloreparies, in sorrow shalt thou bring forth.'6 The point with Browne is rarely dogged scripturalism, of the 'for the bible tells me so' variety. Something more subtle is at play in the quasi- legal logic here. Browne argues that the disputed natural history, how a viper gives birth, must be wrong because it can be shown to engender s) Pseudodoxia, 3.16 (p. 220). 56) Ibid., 220-21.</page><page sequence="24">24 K. Killeen /Early Science and Medicine 12 (2007) 1-27 poor exegesis. The belief meets with something of a legal objection, that if God's 'punishment' of the snake were less severe than the divine 'bless- ing' to be fruitful, it would make God seem unjust. Scripture's curses must be evident, proportional and exemplary. The belief that the female viper is eaten by her young must be wrong for Browne not because he observes it to be, but because it makes God's design seem unfair. A fur- ther contrast is made with Eve: if the belief were true, then the viper's ordinary birth process-with its matricide-would be a harsher sentence than Eve's particular punishment. Browne concludes therefore that it cannot be true. The most remarkable feature of Browne's logic in this chapter is the syllogistic interaction between text and world, and the ability of both to function as logical propositions, with little distinction between textual and natural objects. Nor is Browne simply equating the 'laws of nature' and the 'laws of God'. Rather, there is an interaction where the laws of nature are permitted into scriptural exegesis, and con- versely, the scripture can arbitrate over a disputed point in natural history.57 Browne presumes a procedural, syllogistic equivalence between the logical value of a scriptural tenet, a philosophical premise and a natu- ral fact. My final illustration of this shifts from natural history to medicine and looks at Browne's most famous or notorious text, on the question of whether Adam and Eve should be depicted with navels or smooth-bel- lied, that most wonderful paradigm of nonsense." Earlier, I cited a critic who held Browne to be engaging in 'defiantly paradoxical' stances, per- petrating his deliberate 'affront to human reason' in discussing if ele- phants can talk, and we might suspect that the same is occurring here, when Browne argues against belly buttons. But I suspect that for all Browne's irony and humour, that this is not the purpose here-there is rather a curious melancholy to the chapter. Browne argues it is impious to think "that in the first and most accom- plished peece, the Creator affected superfluities." This is attended by one of Browne's medical digressions, in the stunning and sumptuous prose 57) This process of treating the tenets of scripture as material on firmer foundations than empirical evidence is far from unique to Browne. See for example, the influential work of Edward Stillingfleet, Origines Sacrae, or a Rational Account of the Grounds of Chris- tian Faith (London, 1680), Book III, Chapter 6, "Of the excellency of the Scripture." 58) Pseudodoxia, 5.5 (pp. 377-379).</page><page sequence="25">K. Killeen /Early Science and Medicine 12 (2007) 1-27 25 that he remarkably derives from matters of gynaecology, embryology and anatomy. He describes the workings and the cutting of the umbilical cord "from whence ensueth that tortuosity or complicated nodosity we usually call the navel." As the navel is "subsequent unto generation":' post- partum, Adam, not being born of the womb, would therefore not need one."9 To suppose, however, the presence of a superfluous navel impugns God, nature affecting no superfluities, as Browne tells us. To imagine that Adam did possess a navel would be akin to supposing that he under- went "those notable alterations in the vessells of the heart, which the Infant suffereth after birth" and God, of course, would not be con- strained by such quotidian birth processes. If this 'proof', so to speak, constitutes the goal of Browne's medical-theological hypothesis, how- ever, it does not represent the end of the conceit. Appropriating gynae- cology into the service of theological metaphor, Browne announces that Adam has "no other wombe then that of his proper principles." In the greater cause of proper literality, we must dispense with Adam's belly button, but Browne plays, almost allegorises, on this lack: All the Navell therefore and conjunctive part we can suppose in Adam, was his dependency on his Maker, and the connexion he must needs have unto heaven ... an umbilicality even with God himself.60 From the somewhat stark insistence that a depiction of Adam and Eve must adhere to the strictest and most literal mimesis, Browne then embarks on something of an umbilical fantasy, the 'umbilicality' of all creatures to God, the universe being composed in a maypole of billions of interwoven umbilical threads from God down to every creature. Every animal-and Browne is unusual in including man among the animals- has "one linke and common connexion, one generall ligament ... whereby although they ... seem to be at loose, yet doe they hold a continuity with 59) Cf. alsoReligio medici, 152 on "the man without a navell." Alexander Ross comments, reasonably, that navels serve as decoration (he is after all discussing pictures), that Browne: "quarels with the pictures of Adam and Eve with navels, accounting those parts in them useless superfluities ... The navell, which is the centre of the body, was not use- lesse or superfluous in Adam and Eve, because they were ornaments, without which the belly had been deformed"' Arcana Microcosmi, 157. 60) Pseudodoxia, 5.5 (p.378).</page><page sequence="26">26 K. Killeen /Early Science and Medicine 12 (2007) 1-27 their Maker." In this maypole of creation, however, the threat of apoca- lypse is always present, and is evoked in wonderful (though creepy) imagery of God as his own midwife, cutting the cord not to release the 'child' into life, but to send it into the oblivion of chaos: Which catenation or conserving union when ever his pleasure shall divide, let goe or separate, they shall fall from their existence, essence and operations; in briefe, they must retire unto their primitive nothing, and shrinke into their Chaos again. Browne's complex umbilical and apocalyptic parable is produced as something of an allegory dependant on Adam's lack of navel, which he takes to be a mere natural 'fact' evident from the need to read the bible in a purely literal and medical manner. We might suppose Browne's case to be a matter of irredeemable pedantry-Samuel Butler lampoons the topic in Hudibras in just such a fashion.6' Alternatively, it might be argued that Browne is engaged in an elaborate poetic conceit of our umbilical link to God, that he 'knows' whether Adam had a navel is a nonsense topic, another red herring, the 'truth' of which is wholly sub- servient to the poetic value. However, such an explanation, that Browne is being merely playful, neglects the extent to which his exegetical prac- tice is often stark in its literalism, for all that he may condemn over-literal readings of the bible. Consistently, Browne places the natural world in propositional equivalence to the bible. The significance of this complex negotiation, the sacred and the profane being used as mutual guarantors, is that neither discursive realm is ever paramount, the locus of fixed authority. They must continually appeal to each other for confirmation. This essay, then, has traced two primary exegetical impulses in Browne's Pseudodoxia; firstly the engagement with the literal and emblematic levels of reading natural phenomena, and secondly, the use of scriptural and natural phenomena as interactive and equivalent data 61) SamuelButler,Hudibras, ed. A.R. Waller (Cambridge, 1905), Canto 1.1 (p. 8). Inter- estingly, we have Browne's response to this collected as an occasional piece, Upon Read- ing Hudibras. Browne seems not to have seen any fun being poked at himself, but merely notes that: "The way of Burlesque Poems is very Ancient, for there was a ludicrous mock way of transferring Verses of famous Poets into a Jocose Sense and Argument, and they were called ... Parodixe; divers Examples of which are to be found in AthenXus." Browne, Upon Reading Hudibras, Keynes, Works, III: 245.</page><page sequence="27">K.

This is by no means the only path to modernity-it may indeed be a fairly idiosyn- cratic one, but it does offer an alternative model for the emergence of natural history, other than the still all-too-current narrative of nascent empiricism overcoming ingrained and intellectually stultifying forms of biblical literalism or Aristotelianism.</page></plain_text>
