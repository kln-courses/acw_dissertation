Introduction The Nandi (ndqntt) live in the highlands of Western Kenya. Their language belongs to the Southern Nilotic group of the Nilotic languages (of the Eastern Sudanic branch of the Chari-Nile family). In former times they herded cattle, practised shifting agriculture and rustled livestock from neighbouring ethnic groups. The Nandi are perhaps unusual among the East African cattle pastoralists in that they have a remarkably strong involvement with their past history and have developed a number of institu- tions which attest to and facilitate this.1 In this article we will focus on one of these, the practice of spirit reincarnation. The discussion will pro- vide an interesting alternative to conventional Chet A. Creider, Ph.D. (Univ. of Minnesota, 1973), 1973 Assistant Prof. Dept. of Anthropology, at Univ. of Western Ontario; 1977 Associate Prof., tenured; 1983 Chair- man of Department; 1984 - Professor -fieldwork was done in the Central Andes (1965/66 and 1967), New Mexico (1969), Western Kenya (1970/72, 1979/80), Canadian Arctic (1976); studies on facial and vocal communication in Cynopithecus niger at the Y erkes Regional Primate Center (1968); - areas of academic specialization: anthropology, linguistics (phonet- ics, phonology, syntax, discourse, nonverbal behaviour; African languages, Inuktitut); - publications include: An Introduction to the Nandi Language (1981); Studies in Kalenjin Nominal Tonology (1982), and many articles in journals and books. Jane Tapsubei Creider, wife of Chet A. Creider, is a born Nandi. She received an extremely traditional upbring- ing as a Nandi and so has a deep and thorough-going knowledge of traditional Nandi culture. 1 Contrast Gulliver (1955: 104-123) who describes the social structure of the nearby Jie as a "timeless structure" and uses the term "structural amnesia" in connection with processes by which actual genealogical connections are forgotten. understandings of what biography and history- are . First let us briefly mention some other institutions which illustrate the Nandi involve- ment with the past. 2. Age-Sets (sg. ípintà, pl. ípinwéek) The Nandi age-set system is relatively well- known to anthropologists (Huntingford 1953), and only a few important features will be discuss- ed here. Its most distinctive characteristic is that it is cyclic with a fairly long cycle (ca. 105 years). There are seven age-sets in all ordered as follows: Kimnyìkee, Nyàanki, Maayna, Chuuma, Saawe, Kipkàaymety Kdqpléelach. All male children born during an approxi- mately fifteen year interval belong to one set. At the end of the fifteen years, a new set (the next one in order) begins, and for the next fifteen years all men born belong to it. When all seven sets have been utilized, the cycle begins all over again. A man keeps his age-set throughout his life as he passes through the various age-grades of Nandi society (laakwa "child," muren "warrior," and paayàa "elder"). The age-sets have nicknames which recall deeds and characteristics of the men in the age-sets in previous cycles. For example, the men of the Saawe age-set are known as: saawey- eek aap mardar ma aap Kipsãpaay "the Saawe's who ignored (i. e., rushed through) a fire in the place of Kipsápaay" (i. e., are rash and precipi- tous). In addition it is common practice to date events with reference to the cycle. 3. Ng'óoki (Sin) As might be expected from their orientation towards the past, Nandi did not believe in the</page><page sequence="2">538 Jane Tapsubei Creider and Chet A. Creider existence of a heaven and a hell - other worlds in which individuals could be punished or rewarded for sins they had committed or for good behav- iour during their life on earth. There was, however, a very well developed sense of sin (ng'óokì), and along with it a mechanism by which a sin which an individual committed would be punished by having misfortune fall, genera- tions later, on the individual's descendants. This mechanism undoubtedly had a deterrent effect upon potential wrongdoers, but from our point of view here, it is of interest as another mechanism by which the past is brought forward into the present - another exemplification of the Nandi sense of history. Those misdeeds which fell under the category of ng'óokì were essentially those which caused another individual to suffer unjust- ly. For example, two men might rustle some cattle together, and one man keep all of the cattle which were taken, pending a later division of them. If the man who kept the cattle lied and said later that the cattle had died, the other man might become suspicious. He could place a conditional curse on the suspected man - to take effect only if the suspicion was well-founded. Generations later, misfortune (such as the death of children) would be visited upon his descendants. These latter would make inquiries, and the curse would be recalled. The affected family would then seek out the family of the man who was wronged and ask forgiveness. Ng'óokì is basically passed on through agnates. If a woman committed a sin, its effects would be passed through her sons to their children, etc. 4. Kinship Terminology The Nandi kinship terminological system is of the Iroquois (bifurcate-merging) type. Two features of it are of interest here: the relatively large number of generations which are terminol- ogically distinguished, and the widespread use of reciprocal terms across generations. The follow- ing chart shows these features for some of basic consanguineal terms. +4 méchekwéréet +3 kuuka (m.), kóokó (f.) +2 akuy (m.), kóokó (f.) + 1 4pé (Fa&gt; FaBr), éeyoo (Mo, MoSi), máamá (MoBr), séenke (FaSi) 0 tûpchéet (sibling), ng'eetaqp éeyoo (Br, FaBrSo, MoSiSo), ceepéeyoo (Si, MoSiDa, FaBrDa) -1 laakwéet " (child), wèeríit (So), cheeptà (Da) " -2 akúy, kóokó -3 móchokóréet -4 méchekwéréet The cross-generational reciprocals function to "bring the old into the present" and to "take the present back to the old." 5. Other Cultural Patterns Related to Time In this section are listed a number of minor Nandi practices which seem related to the general thesis that past time is important to Nandi. a) Degrees of past tense Although the Nandi language does not obli- gatorily distinguish between present and future time, it has elaborated three degrees of past tense: hodiernal, hesternal, and distant. A Nandi speaker must choose between one of three tense prefixes when speaking of an event that took place in the past. ka(a)- signals that the event took place today, kqo- that it took place yesterday (or yesteryear, etc.), kn- that it took place in the more distant past. b) General involvement with the past It is difficult to document this systematically, but we are struck, as an English speaker and a Nandi speaker, by the contrast between the large amount of time one of us spends thinking and talking about the future versus the large amount of time the other spends remembering and talking about the past. It is worth mentioning in this connection that the Nandi verb for basic mental activity, kiipwâat covers the semantic areas of "to think" and "to remember" in English. c) Time line reversal In contrast to the near-universal tendency of speakers to order events in time in such a way that Anthropos 79.1984</page><page sequence="3">The Past in the Present 539 they follow the "time line" (past, present, future), Nandi speakers tend to prefer a reverse ordering, starting with the event or time which is "further on" and ending with the prior event (i. e., looking backwards). For example, "my holiday leave goes from December 30 to December 10." A date is often given 1983, December 16. 6. Spirit Reincarnation Let us now turn to a discussion of spirit reincarnation as worked out by the Nandi. When an individual died in Nandi, his spirit (sg. àaiintèt, pl. ãaíik) remained in association with his people (i. e., those of his lineage). Wherever the people moved, the spirit moved too. The association was normally one which continued the basic pattern for treatment of elders in Nandi society: elders were accorded respect and in return conferred blessing. If the individual had not had good experiences with his people, however, he might cause them quite a bit of trouble as a spirit. In such a case the spirit might even refuse to be called back as described below. The Nandi felt that spirits who were called back were gentle. The kùureneét system is the practice of spirit reincarnation through the giving of the name of a deceased agnate to a newly-born child. From the moment a child is born there is speculation as to its identity (i.e., which ancestor it is), and between two weeks to a month after its birth there is a ceremony (kíkuuréy Iqqkwéet "the child is called") where the child is asked by a grandmoth- er from the father's family if it is so-and-so. If it is, it sneezes, micturates or hiccoughs as a sign and looks happy. The grandmother at this point recounts to all present significant elements in the recalled person's life. The child's identity must be determined or it will die. The name of the ancestor is called kùurenéet (pl. kúurénúutík) from the verb keekúur "to call." It is said that the ancestor is "called." Henceforth the child is known by the name of the ancestor, and indeed, is felt to be the ancestor. Kúurénúutík are only given within a lineage,2 and the system greatly facilitates "lineage memory" as not only the name, but many events in the life of the ancestor are passed on. The following is a small fragment of the lineage founded by a Kqqny (Mt. Elgon Masai) immigrant to Nandi sometime in the latter half of the nineteenth century named Kipúsyô. Note both the great depth of the lineage, and the number of kúurénúutík identified with a(k). Kipúsyô I [ Cheepkàae Cheemng'ôok Kipeelyáa | | | (Kipárnô) Kimáastyâany Cheepítyêny Kipúsyô (k) i - ^ r^ 1 1 Kiprootuuk Kipkéynô Kipúsyô (k) Kipsérêm Kimáastyâany (k) Cheepkàae (k) Kipúsyô (k) Kipárnô (k) ""I children (at present) The system permeates Nandi life to an amaz- ing extent. Individuals are not only normally addressed by the kùurenéet names, but are thought of as being who their namesakes were. Living individuals assume the network of kin relations that their ancestor had. This often leads to situations which are extremely confusing for an outsider: e. g., a man may call his son (named after a deceased brother of the man's father) "father," and the child may call his father "my child." But what is important is that it is not just a name which is involved, but a whole person with his/her strengths and frailties, abilities as a fighter, decision-maker, keeper or loser of cattle, lover, etc. 7. Teknonymy The Nandi concern for the individual in the past contrasts strongly with the structured lack of concern with past individuals as biographical figures (or even as nothing more than genitors) described by H. and C. Geertz (1964). In that article the practice of teknonymy is seen as a key element in a cultural pattern in which genealogical 2 The sole exception is that a woman's name may be called in her husband's lineage (in her son's children or her husband's brothers' children, etc.). In this case the woman's name is known as kóokó "grandmother." A woman's brothers can also call her back, and in this case she is known as séenke "father's sister." Anthropos 79.1984</page><page sequence="4">540 Jane Tapsubei Creider and Chet A. Creider information is systematically rendered unrecover- able. Since the Nandi also practise teknonymy it will be of some interest to examine the details of Nandi practice here to see how they fit with the general pattern of concern for retaining the recoverability of the past. In the first place, there is a technical difference between Nandi and Balinese teknonymy. In Bali a person in the course of his life goes through a number of distinct teknonyms: mother of -, grandmother of -, great-grandmother of -. This has the function of identifying generational strata effectively, but it also results in the loss of information concerning direct genealogical link- ages, and hence contributes to "genealogical amnesia." In Nandi, on the other hand, an individual is generally known throughout life by one teknonym.3 This difference between Bali and Nandi, however, is of little significance when compared to the thorough-going way in which teknonymy and spirit reincarnation are integrated together. Just as a child is called by his spirit name with high frequency, the child's parents will be called mother/father of - (whatever the kùurenéet name is). Furthermore, when a woman marries she "enters" the lineage of her husband by being given the name of the mother of the spirit who is expected to return as her first child, i. e., she is given a past genealogical position as a mother of an ancestor. It often happens that her first child is the expected spirit, in which case she simply keeps the name she has already been given. If not, she adopts the name of "mother" of (whoever the spirit actually is). In sum, Nandi teknonymy, far from contributing to genealogical amnesia, has the opposite effect. 8. Comparison with the Nuer The specificity with which Nandi cultural institutions point to a sense of history can be seen by a comparison with the Nuer, a closely related people both culturally and linguistically. We are fortunate in having a thoughtful treatment of the Nuer sense of time and history by Evans- Pritchard (1939). The Nuer were pastoralists who also practised simple millet horticulture and who raided surrounding peoples for their cattle. The Nuer are like the Nandi in not using a chronol- ogical time (dividing time into equally-spaced intervals) but rather using an event time - establishing dates with reference to years in which particularly significant events took place. Evans- Pritchard, however, states, In the course of time these names of years are forgotten and all events beyond the limits of this crude historical reckoning fade into the dim vista of ne-walke, long ago. Historical time, in this sense of an order of events, probably never goes back among the Nuer more than fifty years and the farther back from the present day the sparser and vaguer become its points of reference (1939: 210). And more generally it may be noted that just as Nandi institutions and practices seem to conspire to present a sense of time depth, so do cognate Nuer institutions conspire to achieve a shallow- ness of time-reckoning. A simple, but not insignificant, point is that the Nuer language has no terms higher than grandparent for reckoning precise genealogical distance. (Nandi, it will be remembered, has mono-morphemic terms for both great-grand- parent and great-great-parent.) An age-set system is found with the Nuer also, and it is roughly similar in function. There is a crucial difference, however, and that is that the Nuer age-set system is not cyclical. Evans- Pritchard states that Nuer generally know only the latest of the sets the members of which are all dead (1939: 211), so that the presence of the age-set system does not significantly extend Nuer time sense beyond that of the memory of living persons. Although the Nuer have spirits, there is no spirit reincarnation. Evans-Pritchard remarks that the Nuer "are little interested in the ghosts of the dead When people 'disappear' - Nuer avoid using the word 'die' - only one thing is certain, that they have departed for good" (1956: 159). Again, although it is possible, as it is with the Nandi, for departed Nuer to affect through curses living Nuer, this type of curse does not operate 3 For both Bali and Nandi the actual situation is more complicated, but the difference still remains: in Bali under unusual circumstances an individual may retain his/her first teknonym. In Nandi under unusual (but occurring) circum- stances a person may become known as "grandmother of-" (kóokóop -). Anthropos 79.1984</page><page sequence="5">The Past in the Present 541 across large generational distances. Evans-Prit- chard distinguishes between cien ("ghostly ven- geance," a kind of generalized curse) and biit (a more specific curse). Of the former he states (1956: 175), "it is only those who have recently departed who avenge themselves on the living." With respect to biit, Evans-Pritchard discusses two classes of its use. First, it may be used by living against the living, and second, it may be used in mythical accounts of the origin of a custom (1956: 168). Related to this usage are occasional instances where a curse continues to be in effect after the death of the immediate particip- ants. Evans-Pritchard gives an example of a man cursed by his father to never marry. The man did not marry, but had two sons by a widow. At his death he left ten cattle for one of these to marry in his name. The cattle all died, and this was interpreted as due to the effect of the curse continuing after the man's death. The Nuer practice of cursing, then, is significantly different from the Nandi precisely in the area of the time span over which a curse can have effect. It does not appear possible for a curse to skip over generations in Nuer, and in general a curse is only operative between immediately dead and the living. Finally, in his lengthy discussion of the mechanisms responsible for the shallowness of lineage generation depth, Evans-Pritchard notes, "It is evident that after five or six generations the names of ancestors become lost" (1939: 213). The Nuer and the Nandi are both cattle-keeping pastoralists and share à distant genetic relation- ship linguistically. It is thus possible to compare them with respect to a number of quite specific cultural practices. The fact that in each instance - kinship terminology, age-sets, spirit reincarna- tion, sin and cursing, and lineage depth - the Nuer practise results in a shallow time depth and the Nandi one in a deep time depth, lends impressive support to our thesis.4 9. The Unique Character of the Nandi Sense of Time5 Let us begin by seeing what the Nandi system isn't. The philosopher Bergson (1927 [1889], 1975[1922]) characterized what might be called "experiential time" - the subjective sense of duration, not as something measured externally with spatial coordinates, but as something felt or experienced. The linguist Whorf (1956) argued that the Hopi (speaking a language of the Uto- Aztecan family) had this sense of the passage of time, with events in the immediate past present most distinctly and vividly and with more distant events crowded together and less vivid. In con- trast, speakers of English had "lineal time" - time felt as an unending line, divided into equal intervals and extending from the past into the future. The anthropologist Dorothy Lee, like Whorf, also argued that some cultures lack the Western notion of time as a straight line progres- sion, and cited the Trobrianders as a principal example (1959). Whorf felt in addition that the grammar of English somehow imposed its sense of time on its speakers. We would prefer to say that while English speakers, just like speakers of Hopi and Trobriand, have a sense of "experiential time," a dominant feature of Western European culture (including English) is its systematic utili- zation of "lineal time." Another time-sense is cyclical time (Leach 1961) with events repeating themselves at recur- ring intervals. Probably the most developed sense of this "cyclical" time is found in Java where there are many cycles of different length, and important dates are determined in part by the conjunction of time units from different cycles (Becker 1977). While anthropologists and linguists are cer- tainly correct insofar as they are pointing out that different cultures may emphasize one rather than another of these three time senses, we think it should also be clearly understood that all three senses of time are probably human universais. Human memory is presumably very much the 4 With respect to the factors considered here, the Tiv (Bohannan 1953) are very similar to the Nuer, as are the Ngoni (Barnes 1951). It is interesting that all three peoples have strong fissionai or centrifugal tendencies in their social organization. The Nandi, in contrast, despite the absence of a central political organization, exhibit no such tendencies. Feuding, for example, was absent. See section 10 below for further discussion. 5 There is a large philosophical literature on time. Fraser (1966) and Sherover (1975) are convenient anthol- ogies. Anthropos 79.1984</page><page sequence="6">542 Jane Tapsubei Creider and Chet A. Creider same everywhere so that "experiential" time is probably a human psychological universal. There are so many cyclical natural phenomena, that again the sense of time as cyclic must also be universal. Perhaps the weakest case is for the universality of linear time. However, we think that there are everywhere a sufficient number of non-recurring events which have a directionality to them (even such simple things as the process of aging or a journey from one place to another occurring through time) that this too is a universal of human experience. In further support of this one can note that the vast majority of human languages employ spatial metaphors (which are basically lineal) for the description of temporal experience. The fact that experiential, cyclic, and lineal time are universal in no way detracts from the interest that particular cultural elaborations of one of these have, but it allows us to note one of the ways in which the Nandi sense of time is different from all three: it is not so obviously grounded in everyday experience. It is a combination of cyclical and lineal time in such a way that the past is brought into the present and made literally a living part of it. While the Nandi sense of time utilizes the notion of a cycle, it is different from most cyclical systems. First with regard to the ipinwéek note that the cycle is extremely long (105 years versus a year or less for most "clear" cycles). While there is a feeling that the members of a given age-set will be similar in character to their 105 year ago predecessors, this is in no way guaranteed, and people are quick to note the difference if there seems to be one. In addition the events of the past are different from the events of the present and everyone knows that. Rather, the system functions to aid in recalling the past. With the küurenéet system the presence of a cycle is even less clear. Although names are recycled, this is not an event that occurs with cyclic regularity. Again what is important is the way the past persons are brought into the present and made memorable by the perpetuation of their existence. Note that with "clear" cyclic events there is no bringing forward of the past - this year's Christmas is not felt to be last year's Christmas in any way. 10. Discussion We want to suggest that the kùurenéet system is a way of "doing" history, and especially that variety of history which is biography. If we examine traditional Nandi society we see that there were not many avenues available to develop and retain a sense of history and individual biography. The people were mobile pastoralists with no fixed attachment of individuals or groups to land. Descent groups were not corporate and could not hold land. There was very little occupa- tional specialization. Since all individuals were equal there was no incentive to make the history of one particular series of individuals (e. g., kings) equivalent in some sense to the history of the whole people. Neither the corporate social insti- tutions nor the individual genealogical specialists which are often found in societies with more fixed relationships to land were present. The dead were not buried so that their corporeal presence could serve as a pedigree to the past, nor were death monuments of any sort erected. Writing was of course not known. In this context the Nandi institutions we have discussed serve admirably for the task of keeping track of history. By making the past a part of the everyday interactional present, it is not simply remembered, but is continually made real and relived. In the absence of any means of keeping literal chronologies, the reconstructability of the past is always ensured. This system undoubtedly had some practical benefits. For the Nandi as a whole their focus on the past and strong sense of history undoubtedly fostered a strong sense of identity and unity. Perhaps because of this they were spared the internecine warfare that wracked Masai society in the 19th century and were able to stand as lords of their own chosen domain, resisting not only all other African groups, but also the attempts of Arab slave traders to enter their lands, and even for a time the attempts of the British (Matson 1972). What is most remarkable about the Nandi way of doing history is the thorough-going way in which it is consonant with the basic Nandi value of the equivalent worth of every individual. Where every life is considered to be potentially equivalent in worth to every other, it is only natural that everyone gets a biography. Although Anthropos 79.1984</page><page sequence="7">The Past in the Present 543 individual Nandi were richer in cattle or children, luckier in war, wiser in council, etc. than other Nandi, there was no tendency for these individu- als to get called back more than their proportion- ate share. While it is easy to conceive of what is effected by the Nandi system as a logical con- sequence of their values, it is not so easy to conceive of a way to do this, and the Nandi solution must be recognized as a model of cultural ingenuity. The contrast with our own system, where only a few individuals get biographies, is very clear, but what is even more interesting is the view of history which is implied. It is extremely difficult for us to conceive of a history which is totally "decentralized." We have no trouble with the image of a decentralized polity, and we are of course familiar with differing historical accounts of the "same" events, but not even Borges, with his infinities of histories (1956), manages to transcend this illusion of "sameness" of history. For the Nandi lack of centralization was a reality, not an idea, and it was only natural that when they developed a strong sense of history it would be one which was equally decentralized. The Nandi had no overall history, only the multiply-overlap- ping life histories of individuals.6 Any resemblance between the title of this article and that of Bloch (1977) is coincidental. There is no similarity between the process we discuss here and the subject matter of Bloch's well-known article. Abstract. - H. and C. Geertz analyzed teknonymy in Balias a means of producing genealogical amnesia. We look at an intricate cultural device for producing the opposite -for maintaining not just a genealogical record but as complete a record as possible of previous lives lived in a culture. The pastoralist Kalenjin peoples of East Africa are well known for having a system of spirit reincarnation wherein each child is identified at birth with (interpreted as being) a deceased member of his/her kin group. This paper provides a descrip- tion of the system as it is found with the Nandi and attempts to understand its place in Nandi cultural organization. In particular, one can contrast the egalitarian Nandi system where everyone çets a biography with practices found in less thorough-goingly egalitarian societies. [Kenya, Nandi, Spirit reincarnation, Kinship terminology, Teknonymy, Time] 6 Finally, let us make a comment about the relationship of the Nandi system to religion. The kùurenéet system undoubtedly solved a dilemma that is solved by the religious system in other cultures: that of the fate of those social existences of the past, and hence of one's own self. The system itself, however, was not part of Nandi religious beliefs. These beliefs centered around the sun and focused primarily on productivity and fertility. The sun was basically non-anthropomorphic. Although addressed often by the Nandi, it was never endowed with human-like traits. In contrast, not only Christianity, but many other religions are, in a practical sense at least (we are not theologians), centred around the biography of a single founder individual.
