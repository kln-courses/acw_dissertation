Studies on angiopathy due to carbon disulf ide: Retinopathy and index of exposure dosages. Scand. j. work environ. &amp; health 4 (1978) 151^-158. The occur- rences of retinopathy (microaneurysms/small dot hemorrhages) and the coded resting and postexercise ECG findings suggestive of coronary heart disease (CHD) were studied among 420 Japanese male workers exposed to carbon disulfide and 390 men not exposed to such a solvent. Retinopathy was detected in 24.4 Â°/o of the exposed group and in 3.8 % of the nonexposed group by color fundus photography. Among workers of the former group there was a significant correlation between retinopathy prevalences and the index of exposure dosages (r = 0.925, P &lt; 0.01). However, cor- relation between the prevalence of retinopathy and duration of exposure was not so high (r = 0.647, 0.10 &lt; P &lt; 0.25). The occurrences of coded resting and postexercise "coronary" ECG findings were not related to the index of exposure dosages. Some risk factors for CHD such as total serum cholesterol, triglycerides, beta-lipoproteins, blood pressure, obesity, and skinfold thickness were simultaneously studied. But these variables did not prove to be important in the development of angiopathy due to carbon disulfide, especially the so-called retinopathia sulfocarbonica. Key words: blood lipids, carbon disulfide, exercise elect rocardiography, exposure dosage index, retinal microaneurysms/small dot hemorrhages, retinopathia sulfo- carbonica, skinfold thickness. In order to clarify questions regarding geographic differences in the develop- ment of angiopathy due to carbon disul- fide, teams of scientists in Finland, the German Democratic Republic, and Japan have started epidemiologic studies on a 1 Department of Hygiene, Medical School, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan. 2 Department of Anatomy, Hyogo College of Medicine, Nishinomiya, Hyogo, Japan. 3 Department of Ophthalmology, Medical School, Osaka University, Osaka, Japan. 4 Asahikasei Co., Ltd., Nobeoka, Miyazaki, Japan.

The main objectives of these studies are to observe (a) whether evidence of microangiopathy, especially the so-called retinopathia sulfocarbonica, occurs in European carbon disulfide workers, (b) whether evidence of macro- angiopathy, especially coronary heart dis- ease (CHD) attributable to carbon disul- fide, is found in Japanese workers, and (c) whether geographic differences in patterns of angiopathy exist, and, if so, to determine why. Comparisons have already been made of Finnish and Japanese results of electro- cardiographic (ECG) (12) and ophthalmo- logical (10) examinations. It was found that (a) the prevalences of coronary ECG findings and reported anginal chest pains 151</page><page sequence="2">Table 1. Age distribution of the exposed and nonexposed groups. .

In this paper, the overall results ob- tained during the first year of study in Japan are presented. We analyzed the retinal findings, ECG abnormalities, obe- sity, blood pressure, blood lipids (including total serum cholesterol, triglycerides and beta-lipoproteins), and triceps and subscapular skinfolds in relation to the past exposure histories of the workers and put special emphasis on the relation- ship between retinopathy and the index of exposure dosages. MATERIAL AND METHODS The number of workers included in the study were 420 men exposed to carbon disulfide in a rayon filament factory and 390 nonexposed men from a nearby cuprammonium rayon factory. The age distributions of the two groups are shown in table 1. The subjects, whose ages ranged between 35 and 54 years, were randomly selected from their respective population pools. Their medical histories were not taken into consideration in the selection. The medical examinations included the following: (a) personal history concerning occupa- tion, diseases, and smoking habits (b) subjective symptoms on carbon di- sulfide intoxication: headache, feeling of heavy headedness, sleeplessness, restlessness, forgetfulness, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, impotence, loss of appetite or stomach symptoms, headache during work, feeling of heavy headedness during work, feel- ing of tiredness or "shibire (numb- ness)" in the legs, and neuralgia (c) standardized angina and infarction questionnaire (d) blood pressure (e) blood lipids: total serum cholesterol, triglycerides and beta-lipoproteins (f) color fundus photography (g) electrocardiographic examination be- fore and after exercise on a bicycle ergometer (h) anthropometric measurements: body weight, body height, and triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses All the workers fasted for at least 12 h before undergoing the examinations. When the medical histories were recorded, fac- tors of possible importance for the devel- opment of vascular lesions, such as hyper- tension, cardiovascular diseases, nephro- pathy, athero- or arterosclerosis, and dia- betes mellitus, were emphasized. The workers were interviewed for an accurate occupational history concerning exposure to carbon disulfide, and the data were rechecked against their employment records. The nonexposed workers were also questioned with respect to subjective symptoms indicative of carbon disulfide intoxication. Our questions were mainly related to the 13 items already listed. An analysis of the symptoms was made in the same manner as that described in our previous paper (2), i.e., two points were given for "feeling of tiredness or 'shibire (numbness)' in the legs" and "neuralgia," and one point for each of the other 11 symptoms. Then the total score of the reported subjective symptoms was calcu- lated for every worker. Thus the total score was weighted towards symptoms of peripheral nerve involvement, which would be important in the diagnosis of chronic carbon disulfide poisoning. The history of chest pain was recorded with the aid of Rose's questionnaire (7, 13), which allowed for the classification of reported symptoms according to the sever- ity and probability of coronary etiology, i.e., typical, possible, and probable angina 152</page><page sequence="3">pectoris. The results of reported angina peotoris in the Japanese study have been described elsewhere (12). The examination included measurements of other variables that many studies sug- gest to be major risk factors for CHD, namely, smoking habits, blood pressure, blood lipids, obesity and skinfolds. Que- ries regarding smoking habits were made by questionnaire, the results of which have already been reported (12). Blood pressure measurements were made according to a standard procedure with a sphygmomanometer and a stetho- scope. Blood pressures were measured by the same observer for both groups after the subjects had rested for at least 15 min. Methods for measuring total serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and beta-lipo- proteins in blood drawn from an antecubi- tal vein were as follows: cholesterol, Zak- Henly method (4, 14); triglycerides, acetyl- acetone method (1); and beta-lipoproteins, immunocrit method (Hyland) (3). All the blood lipids of fresh serum were measured in duplicate. Commercial Versatol con- trols were also measured daily to eliminate systematic differences within the labo- ratory. A well-trained investigator (S. K.) car- ried out the anthropometric measurements including height, weight and subcutaneous skinfold thicknesses (triceps and sub- scapular regions). A Harpenden type of caliper was used for the measurement of skinfolds. Additional measurements, such as arm circumference, sitting height, shoulder girdle diameter, pelvic girdle diameter, bone size, etc., were simultane- ously performed according to Martin's methods (6). The obesity index (relative body weight) was calculated from the present weight and height, as described in our previous report (12). The body- build and the relative body weight ap- peared to be the same for both the exposed and the referent group. Color fundus photography was carried out for 418 exposed and 390 nonexposed subjects. (For two exposed workers it was contraindicated because of glaucoma.) The methods of the examination have been described in detail elsewhere (10). An ophthalmologist (H.T.) read and analyzed the photographs. Microaneurysms and/or small dot hemorrhages, which are the main findings of so-called retinopathia sulfocarbonica, were recorded. The ECG response of 406 exposed and 377 nonexposed subjects to single-load submaximal exercise was determined dur- ing bicycle ergometry. Excluded were those who did not complete the exercise test and those who were considered medically or physiologically unfit to undergo such stress. The methods of the examination, the reading, and the meth- ods of coding the ECG tracings have been reported earlier (12). Statistical significance was determined by the t test for the quantitative paired comparisons and the chi-square test for the qualitative paired comparisons. Cor- relation coefficients (r) were calculated for the retinopathy prevalence rates and re- spective exposure category averages; for determining the significance, the t statistic was used. Table 2.

Before 1955, the time-weighted carbon disulfide levels in the spinning rooms had varied between 15 and 30 ppm, and after 1955 between 5 and 15 ppm. More details concerning the toxic envi- ronment of the plant have been given earlier (12). The index of exposure dosages (El) was calculated for every worker from his work history, the time-weighted carbon disul- fide concentrations being the criterion. The calculation formula used for the El was the same as Hernberg's (5). The distribution of the duration of exposure to carbon disulfide and the El are shown in tables 2 and 3. The mean value of the exposure duration was 17.0 years, and that of the El 162.5.

The El and the prevalences of workers with retinopathy snowed a highly signifi- cant correlation, as shown in fig. 1 (r = 0.925, p &lt; 0.01). On the other hand, the correlation coefficient between duration of exposure and the prevalences was not so high, as seen in fig. 2 (r = 0.647, 0.10 &lt; P &lt; 0.25). Table 7 shows the prevalences of the isolated Minnesota codes of the resting and postexercise ECGs accepted as indicative of myocardial ischemia. There was no relationship between each of the preva- lences of the isolated Minnesota codes and the El, nor were there differences between the exposed and nonexposed groups. In neither the exposed nor the nonex- posed group were differences observed in the mean values of the obesity index, skinfolds, blood lipids, and blood pressure of the workers with retinopathy as com- pared to those without retinopathy (table 8). DISCUSSION The noteworthy finding in the study was that the prevalences of retinopathy showed a significantly high correlation with the index of exposure dosages; there was a clear dose-response relationship. In general, making a quantitative as- sessment of the dose or even of accumu- lated exposure is especially difficult for long-term exposure. For the estimation of the dose, the index of exposure dosages was calculated from carbon disulfide con- centration data that were available since the commencement of rayon production in the plant and from the work history of every worker at exposure sites. We found that using the El was better than using the duration of exposure for estimat- ing the actual dosage of past exposure, because the El reflected changes in ex- posure levels of individual workers dur- ing the course of employment. In our past epidemiologic studies re- garding retinal changes due to carbon disulfide (8, 9), the duration of exposure, i.e., the length of service in the toxic environment, was used as an estimate of the dose. From the application of the as- sessment based on duration of exposure a steady increase in retinopathy was evident among workers with less than 20 years of exposure in direct relationships to the length of exposure, but among workers exposed for more than 20 years a decrease in retinopathy prevalence was noted. At the time of our previous studies (8, 9), we had attributed the decrease ito drops in exposure levels in terms of intensity and time, due to changes in job specifications and positions in the course of the workers' history. Fortunately in our current study sufficient data concern- ing the concentration of carbon disulfide were obtained to enable us to base our assessment on the El rather than on dura- tion of exposure, the latter now being considered less refined than the former. In a previous paper (8), we reported that exposure to carbon disulfide for more than 5 years had caused retinopathy as an early symptom of chronic carbon disulfide poisoning, at least under existing exposure conditions in Japanese rayon viscose factories. As to the index of exposure dosages, it can be said that an El of 50 is a significant point in the development of retinopathy due to carbon disulfide, as seen in fig. 1. Roughly speaking, standards 5 ppm of carbon disulfide X 10 years of exposure, 10 ppm X 5 years or 20 ppm X 2.5 years, based on concentration and time, can be considered sufficiently safe for protecting workers from carbon disulfide poisoning. The pathogenesis for retinopathy caused by carbon disulfide is still unknown. We have been studying the association be- tween disturbance in glucose metabolism (diabetes mellitus) and carbon disulfide exposure for many years. However, deci- sive evidence has not yet been ob- tained from past experimental/epidemio- logic studies. In the study, blood lipids, blood pressure, obesity, and other varia- bles were checked for a relationship with angiopathy due to carbon disulfide. Pre- viously most of these variables were suggested to be major risk factors for CHD and were related to carbon disulfide ex- posure too. But our present study did not 157</page><page sequence="8">reveal any direct association between car- bon disulfide exposure and these factors. Thus it can be concluded that long-term exposure to a relatively low level of car- bon disulfide does not cause disturbances in lipid metabolism (cholesterol, triglyc- erides and beta-lipoproteins) or hyperten- sion. In other words, in the development of angiopathy due ito carbon disulfide, blood lipids and blood pressure are of no significance, at least in Japanese workers. The Finnish and Japanese ophthalmo- logic examinations have clearly shown that the prevalence of retinopathy among the Japanese carbon disulfide workers was exceedingly high, whereas the correspond- ing prevalences among the nonexposed Japanese and Finns were of the expected order (10). At present we have no evi- dence to explain why there is such a great difference in the development of retino- pathy. We may only suggest that mem- bers of the two ethnic groups vary in response to carbon disulfide exposure. On the other hand, English (11) and Finnish (5) mortality/morbidity studies have made clear the high risk of carbon disulfide exposure to CHD/coronary death. However, in the Japanese carbon disulfide workers a high prevalence of CHD has not yet been observed, i.e., as far as ECG abnormalities suggestive of CHD or re- ported angina pectoris are concerned (12). In this context, we may have more defini- tive answers in the future, after the CHD mortality/morbidity studies which are being undertaken in two cohorts formed by our present Japanese groups have been completed. A comparative epidemiologic study by our counterparts in Germany may also shed light on the reasons for such geographic differences in the devel- opment of micro- and macroangiopathies due to carbon disulfide.
