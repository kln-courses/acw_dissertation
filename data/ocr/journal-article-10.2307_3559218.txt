Human interactions with the environment, unlike those of other primates, are based on a belief in cause and effect, and this led to technology. Experiments requiring simple manipulations of the environment show that chimpanzees do not have concepts of causes or forces. Children, by contrast, have causal beliefs as a developmental primitive, and these can be demonstrated even in infants. It is proposed that the evolution of causal thinking was essential for the development of tool use, as it is not possible to make a complex tool without understanding cause and effect. This was a great evolutionary adaptive advantage. The evolution of language may have been linked to the same process. It has been technology that resulted from causal beliefs, not social interaction, that has driven human evolution. Keywords: causal belief; evolution; tools; animals; children 1. Introduction Technology, the ability to deliberately manipulate the environment to improve chances of survival, is a fundamental characteristic of humans. Early technology owed nothing to science, and science only began to have an influence as recently as the late 18th century (Wolpert 1993). Technology was originally the result largely of imaginative trial and error. In order to practice technology, a belief in cause and effect in relation to physical objects was absolutely essential, and how this belief arose is a central problem in understanding human evolution. While we all have a common-sense understanding about what we mean by belief, the word 'belief' is not easy to define (Schacter &amp; Scarry 2000). Neither philosophers nor scientists have succeeded in making the concept any clearer. The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary defines belief as 'mental assent to or acceptance of a proposition, statement, or fact, as true, on the ground of authority or evidence'. Distinguishing belief from knowledge is not easy. One does not believe that this is a page in a scientific journal: it is knowledge about the world. In general, belief is about things that affect our lives, and about which there is some understanding. Belief is essential for making sense of the world and explaining the causes of events that are important for us. It is also about moral issues, good and evil actions and people. A characteristic of belief, unlike common knowledge, is that it always graded with respect to our confidence in it: has a true and false value-how right or wrong it is.

Wolpert comes close to knowledge-for those who have seen ghosts, that is knowledge, to the others it is unbelievable. A major feature of belief is that it is used to guide how we behave and so is at the very core of our existence. One can think of it as an explanatory tool. When one refers to someone having a belief we think we can reliably predict how that belief will determine their behaviour in particular instances. This view is called the intentional stance. This also implies that the person is aware of their own beliefs. In 1739, David Hume put forward his doctrine about causality. Our idea of causal- ity, he argued, is that there is a necessary connection among things, particularly actions. However, this connection cannot be observed directly, and can only be inferred from observing one event always following another. He thus argued that a causal relationship inferred from such observations cannot be inferred rationally. This is a problem for philosophers alone, as it is obvious what the cause is if I cut my hand with a knife. And that is why Hume was wrong. For, as Premack (Dickinson &amp; Shanks 1995) has pointed out, there are two classes of causal beliefs. One based, as Hume suggested, on one event being linked to another and which can be called weak or 'arbitrary', for there need not be any obvious connection between them, like switching on a light. Animals can learn connections by the pairing of events. The other, which is uniquely human, is strong or 'natural' causality, and is programmed into our brains so that we develop a concept of forces acting on objects as will be described below. A key question is how this belief evolved. Belief is a property of the brain, but what is the ultimate function of the brain itself? Just one, to control movement of the body, so this must be at the core of any attempt to understand the origins of causal belief. Movement was present in the cells which gave rise to multicellular organisms some 3000 million years ago. They could move either with whip-like structures, flagella and cilia, that are a bit like oars, or by amoeboid movement, the cells extending processes at their advancing end and then pulling themselves to where these attach. This movement was a great advantage in finding food, dispersal to new sites, and escape from predators. A key point is that the protein molecules that produced these movements are the precursors of all muscle cells. Muscle-like cells are found in all animals, including primitive ones such as hydra, a small fresh-water creature with just two layers of cells arranged in the form of a tube, which uses the movement of its tentacles to capture prey. In animals such as flatworms and molluscs, muscles are well developed and the ability to move is a characteristic of almost all animals. One only has to think of forms as diverse as earthworms and squirrels. Again this ability to move is funda- mental to animal life-not just finding food and shelter but the ability to escape from enemies. And this is where brains come from. The first evidence for brain-like precursors is the collection of nerves controlling movement, such as the crawling of earthworms or flatworms. Getting the muscles to contract in the right order was a critical evolutionary advance and required the evolution of nerves. Here we find the nerve circuits that excite muscles in the right order and are the precursors of brains. The first advantage of the ability to move was probably dispersal and access to new habitats. Further advantages then opened up, such as finding food and avoiding danger. For the first time it became necessary to perceive the nature of the envi- ronment in order to decide when and where to move. There was a need for senses. Light-sensitive cells are present among single-cell organisms, so it is not too diffi- cult to imagine light coming to control movement. Later came the eye, and other Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A (2003)</page><page sequence="3">Causal belief and the origins of technology 1711 sensory systems that detected touch, sound, temperature and odour. All these had and have but one function: to control movement. Organisms were thereby enabled to begin altering their immediate environment, for example, by building nests. Emo- tions developed to help ready the organism for appropriate motor responses like flight or attack. And that is why plants do not have brains. Plants are very successful but they do not need brains, for they neither move significantly nor, more importantly, do they exert significant forces to alter their environment. There is no human or animal emotion that is not ultimately expressed as move- ment. In fact the argument is almost a truism: for what else is human behaviour? Sense organs have but one function, to help decide how animals should move. The evolution of the brain that gave us beliefs is no more than an expansion of the original circuits that controlled movement in our ancient animal ancestors. Once the brain developed, it took on other functions, such as those related to homeostasis, like hor- monal release and temperature regulation. Thus, I propose that consciousness (in the sense that we have an internal model of what we are doing and can decide how to behave) has only one ultimate function and that is to control bodily movements, and causal beliefs are crucial for making tools and technology. 2. Primates Causal understanding is unique to humans: the weight of a falling rock clearly 'forces' the log to splinter. How did this ability to have causal beliefs evolve, for animals do not have such beliefs? There are of course cognitive similarities between human and mammalian and especially primate cognition: primates remember their local environment, take novel detours, follow object movement, recognize similarities and have some insight into problem solving. They also recognize individuals, predict their behaviour, and form alliances. However, they have a little understanding of intention- ality of other animals and only a glimmer of understanding the causal relationships between inanimate objects. They do not view the world in terms of underlying 'forces' that are fundamental to human thinking. They do not understand the world in inten- tional or causal terms (Povinelli 2000; Tomasello 1999). Non-human primates do not understand the causal relation between their acts and the outcomes they experience. Apes, for example, cannot select an appropriate tool for a simple physical manip- ulation without extensive teaching. They also neither point, hold up objects nor offer objects. Yet gorillas eat thistle and other awkward plants which require skilled manual manipulation and there is some tool use by other primates. Povinelli (2000) has done experiments that show that, while many abilities of humans and other primates to perceive and move are similar, primates such as chimpanzees do not have concepts of variable causes to explain interaction between objects. One might have thought that Wolfgang Kohler's experiments with chim- panzees showed just the opposite. His chimpanzees, some 80 years ago, could some- times, perhaps with some training, stack boxes on top of each other to get a banana nailed to the ceiling. But Kohler himself acknowledged that the chimpanzees had no knowledge of the forces involved. For example, they would try to place one box on another along its diagonal edge and, if stones were placed on the ground so that the box toppled over, they never removed the stones. In an experiment by Povinelli's group, apes could choose one of two rake tools to obtain a food reward. The choice was between dragging food along a solid surface, or Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A (2003)</page><page sequence="4">1712 L. Wolpert dragging it over a large hole into which the food would fall. Only one of six apes was successful and this solitary success may have been due to chance at the first trial, although the apes did eventually learn by trial and error. They also did badly with an inverted two-prong rake that could not move the food, and on tests with flimsy tools. Again, when required to get a banana by pulling on a rope they could not distinguish between a rope just lying on or merely very close to the banana and a rope that was actually tied to the banana. They showed no appreciation of physical connection as distinct from mere contact. It should be recognized that Povinelli's work is a little controversial and has been criticized by Hauser (2001). In another series of key experiments, primates were set the task of using a stick to push food out of a clear tube. The tools were of various sizes, some being too short, too thick or too flexible. An understanding of basic forces should enable an individual to choose the right tool. Apes can do it, but only after much trial and error. In another test there was a small trap under part of the tube and to get the food the subject needed to push the food from that end of the tube that avoided the trap. Chimpanzees failed to do better than just chance over 70 trials. Then, eventually, when the animals had learned to do it, the tube was rotated through 180' and so the trap was not on top and had no effect on getting the food. But they continued to push the food away from the trap. By contrast, children aged between two and three understood what to do from the earliest trials. Again, male macaques, separated by a wire fence from apples, prodded the apples with sticks, but had great difficulty appreciating that the touch must result in moving the apple nearer. They required 50 sessions of 30 minutes. Young children did it almost at once. However, the chimpanzee Kanzi, a bonobo ape, showed remarkable skills. It learned to create and use stone tools to gain access to food, to cut a rope, and it could make stone flakes and evaluate them after observing a human striking two rocks together. On its own, it created flakes by throwing one rock on to another on the ground, suggesting that he may indeed have a concept of force. It is not clear whether apes poking sticks into termite mounds and so extracting them is imitation or learned by trial and error. But it is clear that, whatever understanding this may involve, it is not generalizable to other situations. It is not that chimpanzees lack visual imagination or are unable to learn quite complex tasks by trial and error, but they do not reason about things. They have, for example, no concept of force, and even worse, no concept of causality. They do appreciate that contact is necessary in using a tool to get food, but will focus only on the contact and not the force it generates on the target object. A hook at the end of the stick is not perceived as a means of getting the reward. One may illustrate the differences in chimpanzee and human thinking with the claim that an ape seeing the wind blowing and shaking a branch till the fruit falls would never learn from this to shake the branch to get the fruit. What may seem to be weak or 'arbitrary' causal knowledge in non-human primates is actually the result of associative learning: that a particular event is frequently followed by another one. Many repetitions are usually necessary, as when a rat learns to press a lever for food rewards. By contrast, strong 'natural' causal knowledge is based on interpretation and may relate to events widely separated in time or space: damage to the car brakes is understood to later lead to an accident. Chicks were fed in a 'looking-glass' world in which, when they moved towards the bowl of food, it retreated, but came to them if they moved away. They never learned to adapt to Phil. Tnans. R. Soc. Lond. A (2003)</page><page sequence="5">Causal belief and the origins of technology 1713 this situation. However, Dickinson &amp; Shanks (1995) take a different view and argue that the human capacity or goal-directed action is shared with other animals and, more specifically, with the laboratory rat. They also claim a concordance between human causal judgments and a rat's goal: directed actions. Thus, they argue that the actions of rats in pressing a lever to obtain different kinds of food, some of which causes them to become ill, cannot be explained by stimulus/reinforcement learning. By contrast, Kummer (1995) argues that strong causal beliefs are almost entirely restricted to humans but the origins can be seen in primates. There is, for example, some evidence that wild chimpanzees use sticks and stones as weapons against other males or other apes like baboons or humans. Tool use is considered below. Also Premack's chimpanzee, Sarah, showed some understanding of causality; when shown a sequence with one of the pictures missing-for example, apple, blank, cut apple- and then being offered several alternatives like knife, pencil, glass of water, it could choose the correct one: knife (Premack &amp; Premack 2002). 3. Strong causal belief is a developmental primitive in humans Causal belief is regarded by developmental psychologists as a developmental primi- tive: it is a fundamental feature of children's development and behaviour (Corrigan &amp; Denton 1996). An explanatory drive is at the core of a child's development and is as important as the drive for sex or food. They want to understand what is happening in the world around them. This drive consumes children in their first three years. There is a gap of some eight months in the developing infant's ability to go from understanding that an object can be retrieved by pulling on the cloth on which it is resting, to retrieving the object with a stick; the former develops at ca. 10 months. At this early stage they do not use a hooked stick to get a toy unless it is already placed on the hook. At 18 months they manage it well. They have moved from believing that two objects must have a point of contact between them to using their knowledge to put the tool in contact with the object (Baillargeon et al. 1996); they will use a 'tool', a rake, to pull a toy out of reach towards them. Leslie (1996) has proposed that infants just a few months old already perceive the world as composed of cohesive solid bodies that keep much the same form when stationary or moving. In addition, they have a special system in their brains (a module perhaps) for mapping the 'energy' of these objects, some measure of their mechanical properties which can be likened to the concept of force. This concept gradually develops and is consistently present at two to three years. At this age, children know that a moving object-a ball-can make another move on impact. It is this concept of mechanics which may be the key brain property that originally evolved in early humans. Babies, one year old, already point at things: something no ape, child or adult, ever does. They do this to get a toy before they can talk. It may mean that they know that some other person can also see what they see. Babies learn that their own movements can cause motion. If a ribbon is tied to the baby's foot and the other end tied to a mobile, they rapidly learn to kick and so make the mobile turn; a week later they will remember how to do it. Think how hard this is for apes. By three and four they can provide explanations for simple mechanical devices and how balls rolling down a system of tubes will behave. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A (2003)</page><page sequence="6">1714 L. Wolpert Autistic children have difficulty in understanding other people's minds but, with the genetically based Williams disorder, it is incomprehension of the physical world that is so disabling. This provides an important example of how genes control devel- opment of the brain so that humans do come to understand physical causality. The best example of this relates to language for which there is strong evidence for brain structures that control and promote language learning (Pinker 1995). 4. Tools What served as the prime mover in the evolution of the human brain-technology or social behaviour-and what were the adaptive advantages that led to the evolution of causal beliefs? A key issue is the relationship between language, tool use and causal beliefs; there may have been a mutual positive synergy between all three, possibly linked by the development of tool use (Gibson &amp; Ingold 1993). A distinguishing feature of hominid tool use, compared with that by apes, is the use of secondary tools, i.e. tools that were made by the use of another tool. Thus, even simple stone tools require a hammer stone. It may be, however, that stone hammers, like those used by chimpanzees to break hard-shelled fruits or nuts, were then used to shape rocks into cutting tools. The evolutionary advantage of causal beliefs, obvious even in young children as well as in all adults, may be related to the making of complex tools. I suggest the key factor is that one cannot make a complex tool without a concept of cause and effect. By complex I mean a tool that has a well-characterized form for the use to which it will be put and, even more importantly, any tool made out of two pieces put together, like a spear with a stone head. It is only with causal beliefs that technology became possible, and it was technology-the ability to physically interact with the environment-that made life easier. Just consider things as simple as the basket and the wheel. The adaptive evolutionary advantage in making tools was enormous. Premack &amp; Premack (2002) are among the very few to ask key questions like: what causes an individual to have a belief and how did belief evolve? They claim that such questions are unanswerable, but give no real argument for this. They suspect-believe-that believing and knowing are pseudo-concepts, but suggest that an exchange of information between two or more individuals is required for belief, which would completely eliminate our beliefs about physical causes gained from our own experience. They argue that perception and memory can lead directly to action without any intermediate role governed by belief. Yet they propose what they call conviction. One possibility they suggest is that belief came in the context of personal action, although they seem to prefer its origin in the social domain but are quite unclear as to how this occurred. However, strong support for my view comes from Kenneth Oakley (1949), who, over 50 years ago, made the point very clearly: 'modern civilization owes its form to machine-tools, driven by mechanical energy; yet these perform in complicated ways only the same basic operations as the simple equipment in the tool-bag of Stone Age man: percussion, cutting, scraping, piercing, and moulding'. These men must have had mental images of what they were trying to achieve, and thus Oakley argued that 'human culture in all its diversity is the outcome of this capacity for conceptual thinking...'. How right he was. Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A (2003)</page><page sequence="7">Causal belief and the origins of technology 1715 Darwin was insistent on the continuity of mental skills as observed in chimpanzees, in using sticks to get ants, for example. But he was forced to concede to the Duke of Argyll, who claimed that 'the fashioning of an implement for a special purpose is absolutely peculiar to humans'. This ability is fundamental to my ideas about beliefs and their origins. 'It is the technological path that we humans took that has separated us most profoundly from our primate ancestry and from our extant primate relatives. Our technological adaptation has been shaping our evolutionary trajectory in crucial ways for the past several million years' (Schick &amp; Toth 1993). Julian Huxley claimed in 1941 that 'there is no essential difference between man's conscious use of a chipped flint as an implement and his design of the most elaborate machine...'. Tool use was probably the most important adaptation in human evolution. Note how this view, to which I am committed, differs from those who put the emphasis on social relations. Tomasello (1999) believes that the normal processes of biological evolution- genetic variation and natural selection-could have created, one by one, each of the cognitive skills necessary for complex tool use, language and complex social organization. Is 250 000 years not enough? He believes the answer lies in cultural transmission. This applies in particular to tool use and language, and so the key, in his view, is the evolution of a new form of social cognition. Humans identify with other humans more than apes do with other apes. Natural tools as used by apes are sticks or stones, but a tool modified intentionally is an artefact. Chimpanzees do show some evidence for this by trimming twigs to use as simple tools. Monkeys and chimpanzees place thick-skinned or armoured fruits on an 'anvil' of stone and smash them open with another stone or a heavy branch. But there is no evidence in the wild of them modifying the stones, though they do leave their 'hammers' behind near the fruit trees and return to use them the following day. Chimpanzees can climb fruit trees with long sharp thorns by ripping off the bark from a tree and using pieces as sandals to protect their feet. At a height where there is much fruit, a chimpanzee may take some bark to use as a comfortable seat. The nut-cracking technique of the Tai chimpanzee requires ca. 10 years of practice to master. There is good evidence that chimpanzees can recognize themselves when they look in a mirror: they pull faces, pick at their teeth and ears, they explore themselves. This may help them with tool use, as it distinguishes their action from that of the tool and this ability could have been an early step on the pathway to causal belief by humans. Other animals that engage in tool use include: the mud wasp, which holds a tiny pebble in its jaws to tamp down mud in nest-building; finches on the Galapagos Islands that use a cactus spine to probe for termites; the Egyptian vulture which drops rocks onto ostrich eggs to break them, and others which use stones to crack open clams. But most impressive is the tool selectivity of the New Caledonian crow, which enables it to get food out of a pipe using small sticks (Chappell &amp; Kacelnik 2002). The earliest Homo appeared ca. 1.8 million years ago. Manual dexterity required sensory and motor changes in the brain. Its size gradually increased to that seen in Neanderthals 300 000 years ago. H. sapiens emerged as recently as ca. 150 000 years ago. The human hand differs rather little from that of some apes but it has a longer thumb and less-curved finger bones. It is capable, unlike that of any other primate, of opposing the thumb with all the other fingers; it has both a power grip and a precision one--it can be used to wield a club or thread a needle. The early hominid Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A (2003)</page><page sequence="8">1716 L. Wolpert hand had a short thumb, and the gorilla has a hand very similar to that of the human, but never uses tools. Apes do have a thumb that can be brought into contact with the index finger, but have difficulty bringing it right across the hand in the way we do each time we grasp a hammer. Of course, freeing the hands from walking with the evolution of bipedalism was a crucial advance. The modern human brain might have evolved as a consequence of an increase in tool use, the brain being the last organ to evolve. A key fossil was Lucy, 3 million years old, who was bipedal, with a hand different from that of apes, and a small brain; she was an australopithecine. H. sapiens only emerged 100 000 years ago, with a brain that had increased in size from ca. 500 to 1300 cm3. The frontal neocortex has undergone the largest expansion; the granular prefrontal region, which is related to association, and the agranular premotor area have become six times larger than the primary motor area, whereas in the monkey they are of similar size (Berthelet &amp; Chevaillon 1993). It is in the premotor area where the commands for motor activity are elaborated. The prefrontal cortex and its regulatory loops are traditionally thought to reduce interference and help concentration and planning. Thus, frontal-lobe damage can lead to compulsive grasping or inability to use a tool, while understanding its function. Motor-cortex control over motor capacities of the upper limb in humans has become extensive and there are direct connections to the lower motor neurons. Both manual and vocal skills depend on programmed sequences in these regions. How could the earliest stone tool technologies have evolved? One possibility is that early humans, using stones in a manner similar to chimpanzees to crack nuts, could have smashed the stone by mistake and been impressed by the sharpness of such fragments. Perhaps they cut their hand by mistake. This could have opened up the possibility of using the flakes themselves as tools for cutting. Early humans were probably more involved in scavenging than in hunting. Perhaps they used stones firstly to chase away carnivores and dogs from their prey, and then as tools to cut up the body. Tool-making ancestors had to be competent field geologists in recognizing which rocks were suitable for tool making. Some 2 million years ago, humans had acquired the not inconsiderable skill of making stone tools. Even for a modern human, it requires several hours to become proficient at making such tools. A carefully con- trolled sharp glancing blow is required to initiate a fracture when making the tool. To achieve the symmetry and form of the hand axe, a concept of cause and effect was certainly necessary and present. Great care has to be taken in the initial selection of the stone and in detaching the flakes. Even the most successfully trained chimpanzee, Kanzi, showed expertise well below those early humans after months of training. Around 1.5 million years ago, larger and more standardized tools were made, the so-called Acheulean, named after a site in France, corresponding to the early Pleistocene geological period. The human skulls from this period are larger and adults probably walked erect. The distinctive features of these tools, such as hand axes, are that they are pear shaped, flattened, with sharp edges. There were also what can be thought of as picks and cleavers. These can be difficult to make. Later ones were beautifully symmetrical. The next million years saw a gradual shift from large hand axes and cleavers to smaller tools made of flakes. There is also evidence that they were hafted, that is, fitted onto a stick or handle. This was a major advance, because, I wish to argue, one cannot make such a tool (joining quite different pieces together) without under- Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A (2003)</page><page sequence="9">Causal belief and the origins of technology 1717 standing the concept of cause and effect. One would have to understand that the two pieces serve different purposes and to imagine how the tool could be used. One could not discover such a composite tool by chance. It was the beginning of the tech- nological revolution that actually make us human and then drove human evolution. It should thus come as no surprise that it was at this stage that humans mastered fire, for cooking and warmth. Early hominids also transported materials, food and stones over distances over more than 10 km; chimpanzees do not do so. Tools were also used for digging for underground roots, tubers and corms. Tools would have been essential also for working the skins of animals into clothing, blankets, water containers and carrying devices. The earliest evidence for such use dates back ca. 300 000 years. Fire, and how to spark it, presents a severe problem. Sparks from stones or rubbing wood together? Again the idea of cause and effect was an essential prerequisite. Over the last 40 000 years, bone, antler and ivory were fashioned as tools, particularly for making pointed tools as in spears and harpoons. About 20 000 years ago, bows and arrows made their appearance, together with needles and sewing. No animal uses a container to carry food or water, though a captive chimp has been reported to use a coconut shell to carry water. Pots and bags are totally human. There have been many solutions as to how to interact with the environment in useful and quite simple ways, all of which require a concept of cause and effect. Consider, for, example 'simple' tools such as digging sticks that humans use in a complex way. Humans also spend hours tracking game, which clearly requires causal thinking (Kaplan et al. 2001). Planning ahead is essential, and trackers also needed an understanding of the environment they lived in, of both animals and plants. They probably used anthropomorphic models to predict how animals would behave; this is true of modern hunters. Casual ethnographic observation supports the generalization that fruit collection is easily learned, extraction skills require more time to develop, and hunting is the most difficult. It is clear that human hunting differs qualitatively from hunting by other animals. Unlike most animals, which either sit and wait to ambush prey or use stealth and pursuit techniques, human hunters use a wealth of information to make context-specific decisions, both during the search phase of hunting and after prey is encountered. Kaplan et al. (2001) propose that hunting, as practised by humans, but not necessarily by other predators, is difficult to learn and requires many years of experience. Their observations of hunters in groups of different sizes suggested that it is not marksmanship but the knowledge of prey behaviour and of remote signs of that behaviour, such as tracks and vocalizations, that are the most challenging features. What then was the crucial change in evolution that led to causal thinking and the ability to make tools and to interact with the environment: effectively the ori- gin of technology? The relationship in evolution between tool use, causal thinking and language is an interesting but difficult problem; one might have served to haul along the others. It is striking that tool use and language both appear in children at an age of ca. 18 months. All three involve what Calvin (1993) has referred to as 'stringing things together'. Most theories see language as a help to learning how tools are used and made. But it is recognized that tools and language share some critical features: rule-governed behaviour and common sequencing neurology. Human tech- nology involves cooperation with others; individuals do not make tools alone. This is true today of the Aborigines. Calvin proposes an interesting possibility related to throwing. He examines the idea that throwing evolved to capture game. It pro- Phil. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. A (2003)</page><page sequence="10">1718 L. Wolpert vided action at a distance, and improved accuracy and distance would have been adaptive evolutionary steps. There could have been a transition from sticks to stones to a fast hand axe which might spin and inflict serious damage. Throwing required improved control of arm movements for accuracy, and throwing for hunting became linked to pointing, a key early gesture. Then pointing could have become associated with vocal grunts. Moreover, movements of the arm could distinguish predator from prey. Language may have had its origins in motor control. Evolution cannot invent something quite new but can only tinker with what is already there. As has been argued, the neurological basis of motor control has very similar features to the syntax of language. Just consider how the same muscles ('words') can be activated in an astonishing variety of movements ('sentences') (Lieberman 1999). But what were the changes in the brain that enabled all this great advance to occur? Human manipulative skills are not much greater than those in apes but differ in how they are used. Primate grooming requires considerable motor skill, each hair being cleaned separately. Apes can trace writing but they do not use motor skills in the same way as humans do, and this is genetically determined because it is an intrinsic property of the brain. The key difference lies not just in the increase in brain size but in the way the brain is organized in relation to motor control. There has to be both analysis and reflection as to what to do and then the ability to do it, and this involves new cognitive processes. This is associated with the significant enlargement of the associative areas of the frontal neocortex. The human motor cortex has many more synapses and the cerebellum is much larger. Also the motor cortex has many direct contacts with motor neurons, and so the relay is direct. The view proposed here is very different from those who argue that it was human social interactions that drove human evolution (Dunbar 1996). There is a correlation in primates between group size and the size of the neocortex in the brain. However, it is hard to see how improved social interaction and understanding could have been adaptive without causal understanding, in, for example, hunting. 5. Conclusions A strong case can be made that a key step in the evolution of humans, which made them different from other primates, was the acquisition of causal beliefs. Without such beliefs it would not have been possible for technology, which is the main driver of human evolution, to develop. Causal beliefs are essential for making complex tools and planning ahead and all other mammals, including non-human primates, lack these abilities. That infants and children develop causal beliefs during their infancy shows that they have a strong genetic basis, though the neurological mechanisms involved are not yet known. Explaining the relationship between causal beliefs and the evolution of language, and changes in cognition and brain structure, remains a tantalizing problem.
