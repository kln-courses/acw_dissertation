Printed in Great Britain On the distribution of bare infinitive complements in English1 ANITA MITTWOCH Department of English, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem (Received 21 March I989; revised i i September I989) This paper explores the fit between syntax and semantics in one small corner of English. It addresses two related questions: To what extent is the distribution of bare infinitive (BI) complements, as in (i) and (2) below, semantically motivated? (i) I saw/heard Mary slam the door. (2) I made/let John cross the street. And what is the function of infinitival to? The main characteristics of BI complements to be discussed are (a) their potential for negation; (b) their potential for independent temporal specification; (c) their veridicality, that is the question whether the existence of the state of affairs denoted by the BI complement is entailed by the sentence as a whole. The paper is organized as follows: Section I deals with perception verb sentences like (i) according to the three characteristics mentioned above. Section 2 compares perception verb complements with NP + full infinitival VP structures. Section 3 discusses periphrastic causative verb sentences like (2). Section 4 disgresses to a fourth characteristic of both types of sentences, namely the constraint against matrix passivization. Section 5 discusses the function of infinitival to and goes on to a partial explanation for the distribution of BIs. An appendix to the paper speculates on why modals take BIs. The bracketing of sentences like (i) and (2) is controversial. In this paper I shall adopt the view, argued for in Stowell (I98I), that the sequences Mary slam the door in (i) and John cross the street in (2) are syntactic constituents, and I shall use the term complement for this sequence. For arguments against this position, see Williams (I980) and Chierchia (I984). [i] The first draft of this paper was written five years ago, and I am grateful to Neil Smith for his comments on it. Thanks also to Shalom Lappin for drawing my attention to the paper by Higginbotham and to Joseph Taglicht for much valuable discussion. I have also benefited from unpublished work by Edit Doron. Finally I wish to thank Nigel Vincent and two anonymous JL reviewers for their detailed and helpful comments on a previous version. 103</page><page sequence="2">ANITA MITTWOCH I. BARE INFINITIVES AFTER PERCEPTION VERBS I shall take it for granted that the NP + BI structure after perception verbs denotes an event rather than a fact or proposition as do ordinary finite or to- infinitival sentential complements (cf. Vendler, I967 b; Higginbotham, I983). This is most obviously shown by two considerations. First, compare: (3) I saw Mary cross the street. (4) I saw that Mary crossed the street. (4) does not mean the same as (3); it does not entail that I saw Mary when she crossed the street, that I was an eye-witness to an event. There is a much nearer paraphrase relationship between (3) and an event nominalizion like those in (5): (5) (a) I saw Mary's crossing of the street. (b) I saw a crossing of the street by Mary. (For event nominalizations see Vendler, I967a, Chapter 6 and I967b). Second, at least one perception verb taking a BI does not take a that-clause at all, as (6) and (7) demonstrate. (6) I watched her mend the boiler. (7) *1 watched that she mended the boiler. In what follows I shall adopt Higginbotham's (I983) analysis of such sentences (itself based on Davidson's I967 analysis of action (event) sentences), according to which events are individuals and arguments of the verbs used to describe them. Thus, (8) would be analyzed as in (9): (8) Mary leaves. (9) [3x: x is an event] leave (Mary, x). The motivation for Davidson's analysis was to display what he calls the logical form of action sentences and, in particular, to make it possible to analyze adverbials as predicates on the event argument. Higginbotham essentially treats a formula like (9) with its existential quantifier as a device for individualizing events and thus making them analogous to quantified NPs, so that (io) would be analyzed as (i I): (IO) John sees Mary leave. (iI) [3x: x is an event &amp; leave (Mary, x)] John sees x. I.I. To begin with I want to raise the questions: what exactly is meant by 'event' as the denotation of BI complements after perception verbs? Is 'event' merely opposed to 'fact' or 'proposition', or is it also opposed to 'state', i.e. non-dynamic situation? The most typical state verbs, those incompatible with the progressive like know, want, own, denote states not perceptible by the senses; hence their non-occurrence in perception verb 104</page><page sequence="3">BARE INFINITIVE COMPLEMENTS complements is irrelevant. But the unacceptability of (12) from Declerck (I98I) is suggestive: (I2) I saw him resemble his father. Furthermore, even states like those in (13) and (14) are excluded: (I 3) I saw the lamp stand in the corner. (I4) I noticed the picture hang on the wall. Next I turn to 'activity' sentences in the sense of Vendler (I967), activities being processes, like those denoted by the complements in the sentences below, that do not have culminations: (I 5) I saw the arms of the windmill turn. (i6) I heard the air-conditioner hum. (I7) I watched the leaves dance in the wind. These are somewhat odd on a straightforward activity reading, but, unlike (I 2) to (I4), they have an acceptable inchoative reading. (They also have an anthropomorphic activity reading, to be explained shortly.) Typical, unproblematic BIs after perception verbs denote events in the narrow sense - as this term is used in Mourelatos (1978) and Lyons (I977) - subsuming Vendler's accomplishments, defined as processes that culminate in an end- point like 'crossing a street', and achievements, which are supposed to be instantaneous like 'reaching the finishing-line' and (with some idealization) ' slamming the door'. (Inchoative readings create achievements, hence events.) The picture is however complicated by the fact that sentences like those below are also acceptable even on non-inchoative readings: (i 8) I saw John sit in his usual place. (i9) I heard him hum to himself contentedly. (20) I watched the children play hide-and-seek in the yard. It appears that any state or activity that can be interpreted volitionally licenses a BI complement; hence also the anthropomorphic readings of (I5) to (I 7). (I4) and (I5) and the unacceptable readings of (i5) to (I 7) become good if the BI is replaced by the -ing form, as in: (2 I) I saw the lamp standing in the corner. (22) I saw the arms of the windmill turning. Where both forms are available, namely for event predications, the difference corresponds to that between progressive and non-progressive. Compare, for example, (3), repeated below as (23), with (24): (23) I saw her cross the street. (24) I saw her crossing the street. (See also Quirk et al., I986, and Declerck, I98I.) 105</page><page sequence="4">ANITA MITTWOCH The requirement that BI complements after perception verbs must be interpreted as events can be further illustrated by examples in which a situation that is strictly speaking static is described metaphorically in dynamic terms, as: (25) The valley narrows to a precipitous gorge. (26) The road widens to a dual carriage-way. Now consider these examples after a perception verb: (27) I saw the valley narrow to a narrow gorge. (28) I saw the road widen to a dual carriage-way. I think that (27) and (28) are good on condition that they describe a situation in which the viewer was him/herself in motion, so that the situation denoted by the complement was perceived as dynamic and therefore as an event, as in the following modified and contextualized version of (27), suggested by Nigel Vincent: (27') As you drive along, you'll be surprised at the way you can see the valley narrow to a precipitous gorge. They seem to me inappropriate if used to represent a stationary viewer looking down on the scene from some commanding height. How is the restriction on the aspectual properties of the complement to be represented? Higginbotham suggests that only 'transient' as opposed to stative predicates contain the extra quantifiable argument place, and that this accounts for the anomaly of (29) I saw John own a house. If this is correct,2 the exclusion of states could easily be extended to activities, since both of these aspectual classes share the 'subinterval' property, that is the property that any subinterval for which a sentence A is true is itself an interval for which it is true (cf. Mourelatos, I978). Note that these two aspectual classes have been compared to uncountable, (homogeneously referring) NPs, which cannot be straightforwardly represented with the existential quantifier (cf. Mourelatos, I978, and references cited there). On general empirical grounds it is, however, questionable whether the restriction of the Davidsonian programme to events in the narrow sense can [2] Neale (I988), in a general critique of Higginbotham's analysis, challenges the 'anomaly' (his quotes) of (29), claiming that its oddity is purely pragmatic, and goes on to suggest contexts in which it might have 'a perfectly sensible reading', for example as part of a report of a fast-moving, high-stakes poker game. I think that, granted that (29) could indeed be thus used, nothing follows from the example, since, as noted above, aspectual classes can be switched. For examples of such switches, cf. Mittwoch (1980, I988). A similar mechanism is of course independently needed for nouns in order to account for familiar examples like a coffee and some (sm) apple. Io6</page><page sequence="5">BARE INFINITIVE COMPLEMENTS be maintained. For there are certainly activity nominalizations like John's singing of spirituals. Moreover, one of Davidson's main arguments for his programme, namely that, as mentioned above, many adverbials are logically predicated of the event argument, would surely apply with equal force to activities. Indeed, many states are sufficiently transient to admit delimitation by temporal adverbials, as for example: (30) John owned a house last year. Parsons (I985) puts forward a set of rules which quantifies over states as well as events, etc., as follows: (3I) If B is a NAME and A is a VP, then BA is an untensed CL and: if A is a Process or Stative VP then (BA)* = AeAt[A*(e) &amp; Agent (B*, e) &amp; Hold e, t)]; otherwise, if A is an Event VP then (BA)*= AeAt[A*(e) &amp; Agent (B*, e) &amp; Cul (e, t)]. In other words, CL (clause) translates into the logical symbolism as a relation between eventualities (a cover name for the Vendlerian classes) and moments of time. The exclusion of states in perception verb complements is stipulated explicitly in his rules for these complements: (32) If B is a perceptual VERB and A is a nonstative tenseless CL, then BA is a VP, and (BA)* = Ae [B*(e) &amp; (Ee') (Et')[A*(eYt') &amp; Object (e'e)]]. This seems to me to be along the right lines. (In Mittwoch, I988, I found it necessary to similarly restrict the aspectual classes of the sentences that can be within the scope of the perfect and progressive operators). I suggest that BI complements be restricted not merely to non-statives but to events in the narrow sense. Since the grammar must in any case provide a mechanism by which verbs belonging basically to one aspectual category can be switched to another, examples like (i8) to (20) should pose no special problem. 1.2. I now turn to the question: can the BI complement be negated? Higginbotham shows that, on the event analysis of perception verb complements, (io) with a negated BI, as in (33) (33) John sees Mary not leave. cannot be assigned a coherent scope (as sentence negation) since neither of the following would give the correct reading: (34) (a) - [ax: leave (Mary, x)] John sees x. (b) [3x: (leave (Mary, x))] John sees x. (33) according to Higginbotham is synonymous with: (35) John sees Mary stay. with the implication either that Mary refrained from leaving, that there was 107</page><page sequence="6">ANITA MITTWOCH something deliberate and premeditated about her not leaving, or that she was at least expected by someone to leave. Higginbotham concludes from this evidence that the negation inside a BI complement, as in (33), 'is generally interpreted as combining with the VP to produce an antonymic predicate, not- VP'. This would make it a non-finite equivalent of what for finite clauses is usually called VP negation (Dowty, I979: 348) or predication negation (Taglicht, I984: I3I), a type of constituent negation that does not affect the polarity of the sentence, as in you can simply not leave, can't you? Granted that the negation is (33) could only be verbal negation, such sentences are still highly problematic. To begin with let me point out that, with verbs denoting perception other than sight, VP negatiqn produces sentences that are simply grotesque (which need not of course prevent speakers from using them ironically), as for example: (36) I heard the baby not cry. (37) I felt the wasp not sting me. Examples with watch are no better: (38) I watched the baby not eat his porridge. (39) I watched Bill not win the race. Examples with see and inanimate objects are equally impossible: (40) I saw the ice not melt. Note that for all these examples it might very well be the case that someone would expect the event denied in the complement to occur. We are left with examples like (33), and even these strike me as at best borderline, denizens of some limbo region between the grammatical and the deviant. (I might add that in five years of looking out for real-life utterances of such sentences I have not, to the best of my knowledge, encountered a single example, not even one meant ironically; they seem to be confined to the laboratory conditions of linguistic research). The reason why sentences with negated BI complements are not fully grammatical is intuitively as follows. Though the failure to act in a situation where one is expected to act may itself constitute a kind of act - significantly we speak of acts of omission, for which one may be held legally and morally accountable - such an act is hardly in itself a visible event. This also applies to (35). But there is also a further reason to take issue with Higginbotham's analysis, namely that aspectually negative VPs, like negated sentences, come out as stative (see Mittwoch, I977a, I988). This can be demonstrated by relatively clear cases of such VPs, namely when they occur within the scope of certain modals (see Dowty, I979; Taglicht, I983). Consider: (41) You can leave until Friday. (42) You can not leave until Friday. IO8</page><page sequence="7">BARE INFINITIVE COMPLEMENTS The interpretation of (4I) can only be that indicated in (43 a); it cannot have the representation in (43 b), since leave is a punctual verb and cannot be in the scope of a durational adverbial: (43) (a) until Friday (Poss (leave (you))) (b) Poss (until Friday (leave (you))) The interpretation of (42) can be as in (44 a) or (44b) with the latter representing VP negation (unambiguous in You can simply not leave until Friday with heavy stress on not) and semantically equivalent to you can stay till Friday: (44) (a) -(until Friday (Poss (leave (you)))) (b) Poss (until Friday (-(leave (you)))) (I ignore representations in which the durational has scope over the modal operator). The fact that (you) not leave can be in the scope of a durational adverbial shows that it is not an event expression. Thus too we can have a sensible reading for (45a) but not for (45b): (45) (a) Rather than not leave until Friday I shall go now. (b) Rather than leave until Friday I shall go now. If, as I have argued, negative VPs always form state expressions, it follows that expressions denoting events do not strictly speaking have antonyms.3 1.3. As regards property (b) of BIs, their potential for independent temporal specification, it should be obvious that the event and its perception must be simultaneous. If a time is specified, as in (46) I saw Mary leave at five. five is the time both of Mary's leaving and of my seeing what I saw. Syntactically, the adverbial could modify either the matrix or the embedded VP; semantically it makes no difference since the readings corresponding to the two structures entail each other. (A semantic distinction can arise if the adverbial is in the form of a clause whose subject can be controlled either from the matrix or from the complement: (47) I saw Mary put the key under the mat before leaving. (47) is ambiguous between a reading in which I left and a reading in which Mary did). It may be thought that with modern technology the event and its perception could be separated in time if it is perceived in a reproduction. Consider: (48) Last night I saw Armstrong land on the moon. [3] Pace Chisholm (I97I). See additional footnote 3 on page 129. IO9</page><page sequence="8">ANITA MITTWOCH I cannot use this sentence in I989 to report that I saw a repeat screening of the event in question on television. I could however have used this sentence in I969, which shows that it is not the circumstance that the event was seen indirectly that is at fault. Why then can one say (49) Last night I saw a star explode. when we know that the explosion occurred millions of years ago? The difference is, I think, that the time of my perceiving the event is in fact the time when it became perceptible on earth.4 The above remarks also apply mutatis mutandis to durational and frequency adverbials. I shall first look at examples like (i6) to (i8) above, with complements denoting activities plus durational phrases, as: (50) I saw John sit in his usual place for half an hour. Here half an hour is clearly the length of the interval covering the situations denoted by both predications. If the complement denotes an event situation, as in (5I, it can only be interpreted iteratively. (5i) I saw Mary leave/cross the street for half an hour. If there is a frequency adverbial and the complement denotes two separate events, that is events that cannot normally be interpreted as parts of one complex event, as: (52) I saw Mary leave twice. [4] The view that I have put forward here is the common-sense view, and may not find favour with philosophers. After writing the above I found that Parsons (I985) gives a rule and translation for untensed complements of see which 'does not require that the time of the seeing be identical with the time of the running [the event seen in Parson's formula - AM]. This is because it is possible to see (hear, notice ...) someone run at a time that is later than the time at which the running takes place, because of the delay in light or sound reaching the percipient. If precognition is possible, an event may even be seen before it occurs. The fortune teller who says I see you marrying a rich man, may be guilty of fraud, bad science, or even violations of our conceptual scheme, but the sentence is well-formed, and it has a clear meaning, and it does not say that the marriage is taking place at the time of the seeing.' In a footnote Parsons adds: 'This may be a different notion of seeing than the normal one, but the verb in question does enter into the construction discussed.' For a start, let us notice that the example has an -ing form in the complement. This may, in fact, be a different form from the construction found with perception verbs, since -ing form complements are also found with imagine. Declerck (i982) gives reasons for distinguishing three different kinds of what he calls participial perception verb complements. But if Parson's example is meant as a report of physical perception, then what the fortune teller reports seeing, say, in the crystal ball is a present event which he/she believes to foreshadow a future one. Since time is invisible (ignoring such factors as the difference between day and night, the height of the sun, bare versus green trees, etc., or the presence of a calendar on the wall) as well as inaudible, the complement cannot have a separate temporal specification. The fortune teller cannot say (i) I see you marry a rich man next year. (ii) I hear a bomb explode tomorrow. IIO</page><page sequence="9">BARE INFINITIVE COMPLEMENTS then the matrix must, I think, be interpreted as denoting two separate occasions of perception, though these in their turn may be part of a complex event, as when (52) is uttered by a policeman on a 'stake-out'. Similarly for conjoined complements: (53) In London I heard the Philharmonia play Mahler's Fourth and the LPO 'Das Lied von der Erde'. In the absence of a frequency or durational adverbial the matrix and the complement can both be interpreted semelfactively or iteratively; it is impossible for one to be iterative and the other semelfactive. The requirement that the matrix and the complement must be assigned the same temporal index carries the consequence that perfect have is excluded from the complement; (54) is ill-formed: (54) *I saw Mary have left. I.4. The existence of the state of affairs denoted by the BI predication is entailed by the sentence as a whole (veridicality). Thus, for (55) to be true it must be true that John played the Kreutzer sonata: (55) I heard John play the Kreutzer sonata. (This does not, of course, apply if the matrix is itself in the scope of an intensional operator or negation.) 2. COMPARISON WITH OTHER STRUCTURES I shall now proceed to a comparison between the BI predications after perception verbs on the one hand and the complements of typical 'object- control' (OC) verbs and typical 'Exceptional case-marking' (ECM) verbs on the other. Typical OC verbs denote illocutionary or perlocutionary acts, e.g. advise, persuade. Typical ECM verbs are verbs of propositional attitude, e.g. consider, expect or illocutionary verbs like declare. Both types are followed by what Higginbotham (I983) calls a 'supported' predication, namely the sequence NP to VP. Some verbs that are followed by this sequence do not belong to either of these semantic categories, e.g. cause, force, enable, allow. I shall come back to these in Section 3. As regards characteristic (a), both classes of verbs freely permit negation in the complement. It is unnecessary to give examples. Regarding characteristic (b), for typical OC verbs the envisaged situation referred to in the complement would be subsequent to that of the matrix and its time can be specified independently. For typical ECM verbs the temporal reference of I I I</page><page sequence="10">ANITA MITTWOCH the complement is independent of that of the matrix.5 However, expect with a complement denoting a dynamic situation is an exception; the situation would be subsequent to the expecting, as in: (56) The weatherman expects it to rain. Regarding characteristic (c) for OC verbs, there is no entailment relationship between the whole sentence and the complement. Among ECM verbs there is one factive, know, and a few positive entailers, like prove; but for most verbs in this category there is, again, no entailment relationship between the matrix and the complement. All three characteristics are illustrated for an OC verb in (57) and for an ECM verb in (58): (57) Yesterday morning he told me not to come in the afternoon, but I went all the same. (58) He considered the terms of the contract not to have been fulfilled, but he was wrong. 3. BARE INFINITIVES AFTER MAKE, LET, ETC. Perception verbs form a clearly demarcated semantic class. Not only is there one-to-one correspondence between membership of the class and the syntactic property of taking a BI to denote a perceived event, but the meaning of each member of the class is relatively fixed when it occurs before a BI. The second group of verbs taking BI complements is more problematic inasmuch as neither of these conditions is met. This group comprises periphrastic causatives, but not all such causatives take BIs; the most prominent members of the group, make and let, have near-paraphrases taking full infinitives, and help takes both constructions. Moreover make and let have a range of overlapping meanings. In this section I shall follow a different order from that adopted in Section I. I shall begin by discussing the meanings of make and let at some length and go on to the question of negated complements. I shall then discuss characteristics (c) and (b) (in that order) for all the verbs in the group. [5] Strictly speaking the above remark applies only to the most deeply embedded complement, the one containing the lexical verb. ECM verbs take complements that are either stative, or contain the aspectual markers progressive or perfect: (i) They believed him to be a murderer. (ii) They believed him to be serving a life sentence. (iii) They believed him to have killed John. (iv) *They believed him to kill John. (iv) is ill-formed unless one can envisage a habitual killing of John. For stative and progressive complements the temporal reference of the complement is clearly simultaneous with that of the matrix. If one regards perfect have as an operator evaluated at a moment anchored in the context, then the reference of perfect complements would also be simultaneous with that of the matrix (cf. Mittwoch, I988). I12</page><page sequence="11">BARE INFINITIVE COMPLEMENTS 3.'. Make, when followed by the BI, has two distinct uses. The first can be paraphrased by 'cause', as in (59), or by 'force' in the sense of 'cause' with the added element of overcoming resistance, as in (60): (59) The rain made the mushrooms come out. (6o) The famine made people sell their dearest possessions to buy food. It will be recalled that cause and force were among the ECM verbs that are neither illocutionary nor verbs of propositional attitude. I shall come back to them later in this section. The second use is like 'force' but with a subject denoting a person who is understood to exert direct pressure on the denotee of the object, which must be animate: (6i) She made me clean the floor. These senses are distinguished syntactically for make (though not forforce) in that only the second permits anaphoric ellipsis of the embedded VP ('Null Complement Anaphora'): (62) Why did you clean the floor? Because she made me. (63) Why did she sell her jewellery? *Because the famine made her. Furthermore, corresponding to (6I), but not (59) and (60), there is a passive with a full infinitive: (64) I was made to clean the floor (by her). (65) ?The mushrooms were made to come out (by the rain). I shall come back to the passive in section 4.6 Let + BI has a range of uses illustrated below: (66) The clear airflow tape with 'see-through' perforations lets the wound breathe. (Printed on box of sticking plaster.) (67) A small vent near the ceiling lets the smoke escape. (68) She let him talk (without interrupting him). (69) She let him stay at home yesterday. In all four cases, allow or permit with full infinitive is a possible paraphrase, though it should be noted that unlike these verbs let cannot be used performatively. In (66) and (69), as well as in (68) without the bracketed phrase, let can also be paraphrased with does/did not prevent ... from, although the paraphrase is only partial, as will become apparent below. In (66) it is of course the constitution rather than the presence of the tape which [6] These differences could reflect a structural difference. It is tempting to say that in structures like (6i) the NP following make is an argument of the verb, so that the structure would be like the one found after object control verbs, whereas in sentences like (59) the sequence NP + (BI) VP is a constituent. Cf. also examples (70) and (7i) below. In Mittwoch (I977 b) I argued that the verb allow can enter both 'Equi' and 'Raising' constructions. I 3</page><page sequence="12">ANITA MITTWOCH does not prevent the wound from breathing. For (67), this paraphrase will not work; the meaning is that without the vent the smoke could not escape.7 Again, in examples with subjects denoting persons the BI phrase can sometimes be omitted under null complement anaphora: (70) He wanted to stay home but she wouldn't let him. (7I) ?He wanted to talk but she wouldn't let him; she kept on interrupting him. For (66) and (67) null complement anaphora is impossible, as readers can verify for themselves. 3.2. Causative make does not normally permit a negative complement in any of its senses.8 The following examples are all pretty bad: (72) The dry weather made the mushrooms not come out. (73) Spraying flowers with water makes them not wilt. (74) The recession made people not spend money on luxuries. (75) She made me not go to the party. Examples with let are, if anything, even worse, with the possible exception of the last one below: (76) The bandage lets the wound not get dirty. (77) A small vent lets the smoke not build up in the room. (78) By unplugging the phone she let him not be disturbed. (79) He let him not go to school. Sentences corresponding to the above in French are rejected by the speakers [71 The meaning of let seems to me to be much more problematic than that of make, and the relationship between the two verbs is far from straightforward. The meaning that I gave in the text for (67), namely that without the vent the smoke could not escape, would (almost?) fit Lewis's (1973) account of causality in terms of counterfactuals. Sometimes the difference between the two verbs seems to turn simply on what is the most natural, expected course of events. Thus make seems more appropriate in (i), let in (ii): (i) The pressure makes the water flow uphill. (ii) The gentle downward slope lets the water drain off. Lobner (I987) includes let and make among lexicalized duality groups; the relationship between them is supposed to be analogous to that between the determiners some and all, with prevent/keep ...from functioning as a third member, analogous to no. (The fourth member, analogous to some ... not is not lexicalized.) His example is: (iii) She let him pay. (iv) She made him pay. (v) She kept him from paying. But sentences with let and make seem to have identical entailments (see Section 3.3 below). I suspect that the difference between the two verbs may be a matter of conventional implicature. In earlier English let had a use in which it was equivalent to cause; this use survives today only in the combination let ... know in the sense of 'inform'. [81 See page 129 for footnote 8. I 14</page><page sequence="13">BARE INFINITIVE COMPLEMENTS I have consulted; Gueron and Hoekstra (I988: 48) star the French equivalent of (79): (8o) I1 le laisse ne pas aller 'a l'ecole. For German McKay (I985: I3-I4) cites a doubly negated sentence as grammatical: (8 I) Mein Vater aber lasst mich nicht beim Sportsfest nicht mitmachen. My father won't allow me not to take part in the sportsday. and finds (82a) ambiguous between the readings (82b) and (82c): (82) (a) Er lIsst sie die Prufung nicht machen. (b) He doesn't make her take the exam. (c) He makes her not take the exam. (Both examples are attributed to Huber.) However, the subordinate clause in (83) is given only the interpretation with matrix negation: (83) Weil er sie das Buch nicht lesen liess... Since he didn't let her read the book... Notice that in all these examples lassen (which can correspond to let or make) has the deontic sense. As far as I can judge, the French example is the worst; this is presumably connected with the fact that French does not have VP negation as a marked option in main clauses: *vous pouvez ne pas aller. In Section I, I argued that a negated complement of perception verbs just does not make sense. The question arises whether the same applies to the complements of causatives. To begin with, let me point out that with these verbs there is no restriction on the situation type of the complement. Statives are permitted, as shown by (84) and (69) repeated as (85): (84) The dry climate makes me prefer Jerusalem to Tel Aviv. (85) She let him stay at home. Insofar as the constraint against negatives in perception verb complements is connected with the independently needed constraint against their being stative, this reason is absent for causatives. The question therefore reduces to: (a) Do the complements of causatives denote events? (b) If so, does it make sense to talk about negative events being caused? Both questions are addressed by Vendler (I967a), who uses a series of linguistic tests on the verb cause to establish that, as he puts it, the term Y in the formula 'X causes Y' must denote an event or process rather than a fact. (In Vendler I967 b he includes states as well.) The term Yin the formula can be a simple NP like the collapse of the Germans, a gerundive construction with of like John's firing of the gun or an NP + infinitive sequence like John to fire the gun. The tests mainly concern the impossibility of gerundive constructions like John/John's firing the gun (Acc-ing or Poss-ing) or their II5</page><page sequence="14">ANITA MITTWOCH perfect counterpart John/John's having fired the gun in Y position. Another test concerns negation. Vendler's example is a passive sentence with the term Y in subject position: (86) *His not seeing the red light was caused by dense fog. Vendler adduces the negative in this example as an additional reason for the eventhood of Y, but the argument is vitiated by the fact that the negative occurs in one of the independently banned gerundive constructions. (As Vendler points out elsewhere, gerundives like John's firing of the gun cannot be negated, and neither, of course, can NPs like the collapse of the Germans.) We must therefore try an infinitive complement of cause, and here the evidence is less clear: (87) The dense fog caused him not to see the red light. Most people find (87) well-formed, though the preferred way of expressing its meaning is of course (88) The dense fog prevented him from seeing the red light. Could it be that Vendler was wrong about infinitive complements after cause, and that they do not after all denote events? I think that this is unlikely. It seems more likely that he was mistaken about the negation test and that ' non-events' ('failures' in Davidson, I967 b; 'omissions' in Lewis, I973) can, marginally, be caused. When we come to the complements of allow the evidence supports Vendler more clearly. The examples below, formed by replacing let by allow in (76) to (78), are all bad: (89) The bandage allows the wound not to get dirty. (go) A small vent allows the smoke not to build up in the room. (9I) By unplugging the telephone she allowed him not to be disturbed. Only the example with permissive allow is tolerable: (92) She allowed him not to go to school. In view of the semantic relationship between cause and allow these examples can be taken as evidence for the eventhood of the complement. A further argument will be mentioned in Section 4. I shall not go into details about the other two verbs in this class except to note that they cannot be followed by negated complements either: (93) The teacher had us not use a dictionary. (94) I helped him not set the table. Note that help with a to-infinitive, which differs from help+BI in that the iI6</page><page sequence="15">BARE INFINITIVE COMPLEMENTS referent of the subject does not have to be a direct participant in the action, permits a negated complement :9 (95) His faith helped him not to despair. 3.3. For all the verbs in the group there is an entailment relationship between the whole sentence and the complement (characteristic (c)). Thus in each of the following pairs the first member entails the second: (96) (a) The rain made the mushrooms come out. (b) The mushrooms came out. (97) (a) She let him stay at home yesterday. (b) He stayed at home yesterday. (98) (a) She had him wash the dishes. (b) He washed the dishes. (99) (a) She helped him wash the dishes. (b) He was the main participant in the action of washing the dishes. The contrast between let and allow or permit is particularly striking in this respect. In my judgment (IOO) is not contradictory but (IOI) is: (ioo) She allowed him to stay at home yesterday but he chose to go to school all the same. (ioi) She let him stay at home yesterday but he chose to go to school all the same. If this is correct it indicates that not only is let not performative but it does not even, strictly speaking, convey a report of an illocutionary act. Note also that if we substitute not prevent ... from in these examples the resulting sentence is not contradictory either: (102) She did not prevent him from staying at home but he chose to go to school all the same. Regarding characteristic (c) there is, however, this difference between perception and causative verb complements. For the former the event denoted by the complement exists independently of its perception by a perceiver. For the latter it is the occurrence of the event that is at issue; the complement is resultative. 3.4. Characteristic (b) presents more of a problem. Does the event denoted by the BI complement have to be exactly contemporaneous with that denoted by the whole sentence? I shall confine the discussion to make and let. Let us first look at examples where the referent of the subject exerts/fails to exert [91 I owe this point to Edit Doron. I "7</page><page sequence="16">ANITA MITTWOCH pressure on the referent of the second NP. The following examples are clearly deviant: (I03) Last night she made/let him go tomorrow. I am less sure about sentences where the complement is interpreted as iterative: (I04) They made us get up at five every morning. Does the matrix verb also have to be interpreted as iterated? I think not. Let us now consider examples where the subject is abstract. (105) The frost in July made coffee prices rise in January. If the subject NP is regarded, with Davidson (I967 b), as an event, then clearly the cause in this case precedes that which is caused. According to Vendler (I967 a and b), however, the subject of cause - and hence presumably of make - denotes not an event but a fact in such cases, and facts are not located in time at all. Hence the question of the temporal relationship between the matrix subject and the complement would simply not arise for such examples. I shall not take a stand on this question and shall therefore leave it open. 4. THE CONSTRAINT AGAINST PASSIVE. It is well-known that sentences like (i) do not passivize: (IO6) Mary was seen/heard slam the door. Sometimes a full infinitival passive is available: (I07) Mary was seen/heard to slam the door. but even this form is heavily restricted. First, it seems to be natural only if the subject of the infinitive refers to a person or some other agent that normally participates in events: (io8) (a) The locomotive was seen to run down the hill and crash into the bridge. (b) ?The flood waters were seen to tear down the bridge. Second, with hear there seems to be a constraint that the sound perceived must be naturally associated with, and attributable to, the referent of the infinitival subject: (IO9) She was heard to mutter a curse under her breath/sing the national anthem as opposed to (IIO): (i io) ?The branch was heard to snap. ii8</page><page sequence="17">BARE INFINITIVE COMPLEMENTS Third, with some perception verbs the passive is quite impossible: (I I I) *John was watched to build a boat. As noted above, make+ BI complement does not passivize either, and neither does let (except in frozen expressions like let go): (I I2) *She was made clean the floor (II 3) *The smoke is let escape. What is even more remarkable (and has not been commented on, to my knowledge) is that cause, although it takes a full infinitive, does not passivize either. Corresponding to (II4 a) we do not get (I I4 b): (I 4) (a) The inflation caused prices to rise. (b) *Prices were caused to rise (by the inflation). Note also the following contrast: (II5) (a) Aspirin lowers body temperature (b) Aspirin causes body temperature to drop. (c) Body temperature is lowered by aspirin. (d) *Body temperature is caused to drop by aspirin.1" Allow has a passive in its deontic sense, though even this is usually, perhaps always, a statal passive: (i I6) She was allowed to stay out till Io p.m. Causative allow does not passivize: (II7) (a) The accumulated fat allows the bird to travel long distances without stopping for food. (b) *The bird is allowed to travel long distances by the accumulated fat. Assuming, as seems reasonable, that the constraint against (I I 5d) and (I I 7b) is essentially the same as that against (II2) and (II 3), these data provide [io] In a corpus-based study, Huddleston (1970) cites, without comment: (i) When a nerve impulse reaches the synaptic knob, some of the vesicles are caused to eject the transmitter substance into the synaptic cleft. The example sounds bad to my ear. One of the JL reviewers finds no difference between (ii) and (iii), both of them being 'stylistically odd because of the "indirect causation" interpretation': (ii) Prince Charles caused the plans to be rejected. (iii) The plans were caused to be rejected by Prince Charles He/she also mentions inscriptions on monuments like (iv) This obelisk was caused to be erected by the Duke of Denver in memory of his gamekeeper. For this example cause might well be equivalent to something like order. I I9</page><page sequence="18">ANITA MITTWOCH further evidence for Vendler's thesis that the complements of periphrastic causatives denote events. I know of two attempts to account for the constraint against passives of perception verb sentences with BI complements." Williams (1983) proposes a purely syntactic solution, a filter banning the sequence V VP where VP has certain specified features (and the intervening trace is 'invisible', i.e. an np trace). This filter is analogous to Ross's 'double -ing' constraint, and the two are in fact combined in Williams's account. Higginbotham explains the anomaly of sentences like (io6) by showing that on the event analysis, together with the assumption that there is a syntactic level of Logical Form (LF), it could not be assigned a coherent reading at this level. The argument goes as follows: Since BI complements are non-clausal ('unsupported' in his terminology), they cannot appear as embedded clauses at LF (as can the complement of expect, for example). They can, however, undergo the scope-assignment role of quantified phrases at this level, so that John saw Mary leave will come out as (i I 8) [[Mary leave][John saw t]] where t is the trace of the fronted Mary leave, and on the individual event analysis it will eventually come out as (i I9) [3x: leave (Mary, x)] John saw x. A passive sentence like John was seen leave would have the S-structure in (I20), with t the trace of John. (i20) John was seen [t leave] At LF the structure would be (I2i) [[t leave][John was seen t']] where t' is the trace of t leave. 'But (I2I) is not well-formed on two counts. First the trace t of John is not within the scope of its antecedent. Second, and still more significant, the matrix of (I2I), namely (122): (I22) John was seen t with t not the trace of John, is not well-formed either, no more than is (I23) John was seen Mary. The passive of a perceptual report is in consequence ungrammatical.' (Higginbotham, I983: 123-4) Higginbotham also offers an explanation for the grammaticality of the passive with full infinitive. His example, [i i] A third account, by Bennis &amp; Hoekstra (1989), reached me too late for incorporation in this paper. I20</page><page sequence="19">BARE INFINITIVE COMPLEMENTS (I24) John was seen to leave. would have the structure (I25) [John was seen [t to leave]] with t the trace of John. 'But in this case, since the embedded clause is supported, it can serve as argument to the verb see. No further application of scope assignment is required, and the LF-representation of (I25), abstracting from irrelevant details, is just (125) itself, which is well-formed. Our analysis would predict that (I24) has only an epistemic interpretation, in other words that it amounts to 'Somebody saw that John left'. This prediction is borne out, I believe' (Higginbotham, I983: 124). To begin with, I want to take issue with Higginbotham's judgment in the last paragraph. If the interpretation of the complement in the passive sentence were necessarily epistemic, one would in fact expect (I26) ?John was seen to have left. Moreover, this analysis would predict that complement negation should be considerably better in a passive sentence than in an active one: (I27) John was seen not to leave. I do not think that this is the case. Aside from this point, to which I shall come back shortly, Higginbotham's account provides an explanation for something that is merely described by Williams's filter, namely that in BI complements the subject and predicate cannot be prised apart other than by wh-movement (though in fairness to Williams it should be conceded that (I I2) and (I I3) are indeed considerably worse than (I I 5d) and (I I 7b), so that the difference may in part be a matter of syntax only). As such, Higginbotham's account seems to me to provide a more promising approach. However, his use of the absence of to as a cast- iron test for the event interpretation of the complement means that he cannot explain the constraint involved in cause and allow passives any more than Williams can. The account needs to be modified so that the event interpretation as such would block passive. As regards passive sentences like (I 24), it may well be that the existence of this construction in English is connected with the fact that English also has a construction in which full infinitive complements have an epistemic (propositional) interpretation (as with believe type verbs). French and German, which have perception verb complements analogous to the English construction but which lack epistemic (ECM) infinitival complements, have no passives analogous to (I24). Furthermore, even in English such passives have a much narrower distribution than the corresponding active sentences, as I showed above. Thus the relationship between the active and the passive sentences is not straightforward; and it may be that passives like (I24) are 121</page><page sequence="20">ANITA MITTWOCH, somehow parasitic on the full infinitive construction with epistemic interpretation.12 Similarly, passive sentences like (64) might be influenced by the construction with force. 5. BARE INFINITIVES AND THE FUNCTION OF TO In this section I shall endeavour to provide an explanation for the existence (or survival) of BI complements in English by looking at the function of infinitival to. 5. I. It is today widely accepted among generative linguists that infinitival to functions syntactically like an auxiliary verb. This can be seen, for example, by the phenomenon of VP ellipsis as in (128): (I28) (a) I will./I have./I am./I do. (b) I want to. and by the position of the italicized elements in (I29): (129) (a) We have all taken part in the play. (b) I can really recommend it. (c) We want to all take part in the play. (d) We are in a position to really recommend it. Now one of the functions of the English auxiliaries is to act as carriers for sentence polarity, i.e. to serve as prop for the attachment of negation, and to receive contrastive stress signalling positive polarity. This is most obviously shown by the phenomenon of dummy do (cf. Gazdar et al., I982, Pullum, I983). As regards negation, to is exceptional only in usually following the negative rather than preceding it; but its function in negation can be clearly seen from data like the following: (I30) (a) I persuaded him to. (b) I persuaded him. (c) I persuaded him not to. (d) *1 persuaded him not."3 [121 Jespersen (1940: 280) mentions an epistemic use of see+ full infinitive, usually be, as in (i) Seeing flight to be impossible, he surrendered. This strikes me as somewhat archaic. [I 3] Not on its own occurs as a pro-form for a negative tensed clause, as in I hope not, I think not. This use of not is confined to answers to questions; it would not be appropriate in contexts like (i) John thinks that it will rain, but I think not. (ii) It rained after all though I had hoped not. (iii) They got drawn into the dispute after all, though they had hoped not. Note that in (iii) not to would just about be possible. 122</page><page sequence="21">BARE INFINITIVE COMPLEMENTS These facts, are particularly remarkable inasmuch as the constraint involved, in its present strong form, is fairly recent. Jespersen (1940: 338) cites examples analogous to (I 3od) from the first two decades of the twentieth century, e.g. (I 3I) Are you really going to speak? I ask you not. To as a marker of positive polarity appears in the following example, taken from Zwicky &amp; Levin (I980): (I32) I wouldn't be upset not to be chosen but, on the other hand, I wouldn't be upset to be chosen. Thus it seems quite plausible that one of the reasons why the two classes of verbs discussed in the previous sections govern BIs is that on semantic grounds their complements either cannot be negated, as with perception verbs, or such negation is problematic, as with causatives.14 5.2. What about characteristics (b) and (c)? Could the to of the full infinitive have any connection with the temporal interpretation of the complement of which it forms part and with the fact that this complement is usually non- entailed? My answer to this question will be more speculative and more guarded. It can be shown on purely syntactic grounds that to is not simply a member of the class of auxiliaries but that it is to be grouped specifically with the modal auxiliaries. Like the modals and dummy do it governs the BI. Like the modals but unlike do it can be followed by the perfect auxiliary have and by progressive, passive and copular be. As regards the temporal properties of to infinitives, recall that for typical control verbs the event denoted by the infinitive phrase is subsequent to that denoted by the matrix. The same is true for modals in their root senses. The VP following root can, may, must is usually interpreted as subsequent to the ability, obligation, etc, expressed by the modal at least for event VPs, though separate temporal specification is rather restricted. What I am suggesting is that to with control verbs may have a vestige of future meaning. One, admittedly rather slight, piece of evidence in favour of this proposal is historical. Infinitive to derives from the homophonous preposition which [1 4] Pullum actually uses negative placement as an argument for treating to as an auxiliary verb. He regards not to go as analogous to not having gone, the generalization being that not precedes non-finite verbs. In that case examples like the following would presumably have to be treated as verbal or inner VP negation: (i) He managed to not spill any. (ii) I would prefer to not go. I do not find the analogy drawn by Pullum altogether convincing, and suspect that the reason for the normal order not to lies in prosodic factors which are not, as yet, fully understood. See Zwicky (I980), Zwicky &amp; Levin (I980) and for a recent treatment Pollock (I989). I23</page><page sequence="22">ANITA MITTWOCH signifies that the NP to which it is attached denotes a goal of motion, and the first use of infinitival to in the development of English (and of analogous prepositions in other languages) is found in constructions in which it still has its directional meaning, especially in purpose clauses after verbs of motion (cf. Jespersen, I940). The extension of to to control constructions can be explained by the fact that the future is commonly viewed in localistic terms as positioned in front of us, as a permanently receding goal of motion.'5 A suggestion along these lines is already found in Bock (I93I), with the rider that this diachronic fact still plays some part in contemporary English. And indeed the connection between to infinitives and future meaning can be seen in present-day English in their use in 'result' clauses like (I33) I arrived early only to find the place deserted. and, especially, in their use in newspaper headlines as markers of predicted events, as in: (I34) Fuel prices to rise next week. The 'future' meaning of infinitival to is relevant only to control verbs. Characteristic (c) differentiates both control and ECM verbs from perception verbs and causatives, and a comparison with modals is again relevant. Modality is closely connected with the absence of 'actuality' (Palmer, I983); in particular modal sentences usually do not entail their non-modal counterparts. Indeed, even the 'future' meaning of the complements of root modals and control verbs may be thought of as one aspect of non-actuality. For ECM verbs, which in some ways resemble the epistemic uses of the modals, the to of the infinitival complement would then signal only the non- entailment of the complement. 16 In this connection it is surely significant that [I5] Stowell (I98I) locates the future interpretation of infinitives in COMP. He argues that a) infinitives that function as control complements (the try and persuade class), as well as infinitive purpose clauses, contain a COMP position, whereas Raising and ECM complements do not. b) infinitive clauses have tense just in case they have COMP, the tense being 'unrealized' or 'possible future'. c) the COMP position is the locus of tense operators at some level of grammatical representation (he leaves open the question whether this level is DS or LF). In my proposal the future interpretation of (some) infinitive clauses is associated not with COMP but with to. Stowell's proposal is faced with two kinds of counter-examples. As noted above, expect, an ECM verb, can take a complement that is interpreted as future; on the other hand several control verbs, e.g. manage, can not. In my proposal, modal interpretation is only one of the functions of to, the others being to signal non-veridicality and to carry negation. Gueron and Hoekstra (I988) claim (rather strangely, in my view) that to in ECM constructions functions as an inflectional tense morpheme which T-marks (= tense marks) the complement verb. [i6] The same would apply to infinitival clauses in subject and predicate position: (i) To know her is to love her. (ii) For John to plead ignorance is preposterous. (i) does not entail that anybody actually knows or loves her, and (ii) does not entail that John is pleading or has pleaded ignorance. 124</page><page sequence="23">BARE INFINITIVE COMPLEMENTS ECM constructions are comparatively rare cross-linguistically, and that they entered the English language comparatively late - in the fourteenth century according to Bock (I93I). (Strictly speaking, they re-entered English at that time, since there was a similar construction in Old English, which had fallen out of use.) 5.3. I have argued that properties (a)-(c) provide an explanation for the existence of BI complements in English. Is this explanation, at least for causatives, not vitiated by the fact that some causatives take full infinitives? Is there a semantic explanation for the ambivalent behaviour of causatives regarded as a class? There are a number of differences between perception and causative verb complements which point to possible answers to this question, alone or in combination. We have seen that the status of negative events is different in the two cases - they can more easily be envisaged as being caused than as being perceived. It may also be that property (b) is responsible, that is if we agree with those philosophers who believe that the subject of cause denotes an event, which normally precedes the event denoted by the complement. Finally, as noted at the end of Section 3.3, the truth of the complement predication of causatives is asserted rather than taken for granted. As regards the difference between cause and make, allow and let, one might invoke history; there may be something in the fact that all the causative BI verbs belong to the Anglo-Saxon part of the vocabulary, whereas cause and allow do not. It is noteworthy, however, that make actually vacillated for a long time - until this century, in fact (witness the Biblical He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.) There must, therefore, be some additional reason why the BI won out. I can only speculate that it is connected with the fact that make, unlike cause, also takes other kinds of 'small clauses', such as those below: (I 35) (a) You make me angry. (b) They made him their leader. Similarly, the difference between let and allow is not only that let is never an illocutionary verb but also that it takes structures like (136) They let him loose/in/out. 5.4. In the days when linguists were arguing about the question whether morphemes are always meaningful, infinitival to was adduced as a paradigm example of a meaningless morpheme. And indeed, on the principle that meaning implies choice, the occurrence of to in any one particular sentence does not (with negligible exceptions) carry meaning. But when we look at constructions rather than sentences exemplifying these constructions the picture is different. Even in frameworks that continue to be based on the idea criticized in Jackendoff (I987) 'that the creative capacity of the grammar is I25</page><page sequence="24">ANITA MITTWOCH invested in the syntax' and that semantics is an interpretative component, it is now recognized that the selectional properties of verbs (and other heads of phrases) derive basically from their meaning. The term 's-selection' (= semantic selection) for subcategorization (number of arguments and their theta-roles) speaks for itself. Pesetzky (I982), basing himself on work by Jane Grimshaw, has also argued that 'c-selection' (categorial selection) derives from s-selection (and case theory) and that it can be eliminated by means of the notion Canonical Structural Representation (CSR) and the Context Principle, which states that (I 37) If a predicate s-selects a semantic category C, then it c-selects (subcategorizes) CSR(C). Thus the CSR for propositional arguments is said to be clause (CP).1" We might then say that the CSR for event arguments is the structure NP BI-VP, or simply a maximal projection of VP (with the NP subject its specifier); and, furthermore, that this choice of structure is not arbitrary but motivated by the semantic properties of those arguments - there would simply be no need for an auxiliary slot (or slots).'8 Such a move would also account for the fact, remarked on by Higginbotham (I983), McKay (I985) and others, that, cross- linguistically, perception and causative verbs often pattern together (as well as sharing features with the modals, to be discussed in the Appendix). This kind of explanation may, nevertheless, be thought a bit of a luxury. It would be difficult to incorporate in any formal account, at least for causatives, since the data are so messy, and it clearly cannot come instead of a syntactic account. The differences in distribution remain syntactic facts, and as Palmer (I983) says: 'If we incorporate a semantic explanation for what are firm grammatical [i.e. syntactic - AM] constraints into the linguistic description there will be redundancy - for the semantic explanation is not essential if the grammar accounts for the restrictions'. Nevertheless, such an explanation may be satisfying inasmuch as it helps to eliminate the arbitrariness, the quality of 'brute facts', from syntactic phenomena.'9 1I7] But note that this principle does not tell us whether infinitival constructions (IPs?) are optionally available as alternatives to tensed clauses (CPs) for propositional arguments of verbs (he declared/* said the wine to be excellent) or adjectives (she is likely/* probable to be late). [I8] Pollock (I989) splits the traditional TG Aux or Infl category into three different categories: Tense, Negation, Agreement. Bennis and Hoekstra (I989), who adopt this analysis, suggest that BI complements are Agreement Phrases. These authors reflect the trend in recent TG analyses to account for the syntactic difference between full and bare infinitives by postulating different phrasal categories for them and relating these to semantic differences. By contrast Chierchia (I984: 2I8 f), who treats all infinitives - full and bare - as properties, has no explanation for the difference and no account of the function of to (see especially p. 247). [I9] It is thus, as pointed out by Nigel Vincent, very much in the spirit of Bolinger's search for meaning in syntax. See, for example, Bolinger (1977). The semantic distinctions that Bolinger is usually concerned with turn on discourse meaning; in the present case we are dealing with logical meaning. 126</page><page sequence="25">BARE INFINITIVE COMPLEMENTS Moreover, the findings of this paper are by no means unparalleled in this respect. Other examples that spring to mind include: the choice of morphological case in case languages; selection for the indirect object construction in English (* he explained me the problem); the choice between the auxiliaries corresponding to have and be for the perfect and other so-called ' unaccusative' phenomena in a number of familiar European languages; the choice between ser and estar (both translating 'be') in Spanish, etc. In all these cases the semantics goes a long way but not all the way in explaining syntactic distribution. If we do not find a niche for the semantic correlates of the syntax somewhere in the grammar, we are in danger of impoverishing our overall account of how language works. APPENDIX Why do the modals take BIs? The negation-carrying function of to cannot be the explanation in this case; the modals themselves are normally the syntactic carriers of negation even in cases where logically it is the complement that is negated, as with epistemic may. This is shown by the tag in (138) John may not be eligible, and neither may Bill. Complement negation after a modal, that is to say what I referred to as VP negation above, as in (I39), is a very marked option: (I39) You may simply not go. This explanation might, however be vitiated on the grounds of circularity. Conceivably it is absence of to that causes the modal to take over the function of carrying negation, thus producing a mismatch between the syntax and the semantics. The main answer to the question lies, I suggest, in the modal character of to. The grammar must in any case include a constraint against two modals in sequence in order to rule out examples like (140) *If John agreed to baby-sit, we would can go. (Strictly speaking the constraint applies to one modal governing another, since, as pointed out by a JL reviewer, a modal which occurs in a subordinate clause and is followed by VP ellipsis can precede another modal: anyone who can should see this film.) It might be thought that such a constraint is unnecessary in view of the independently needed constraint that the modals must be tensed. Otherwise we would generate not only (I40) but also (I4I) *She hopes to can win. (I42) *Her generosity made me can go to university. But such a constraint, though necessary, is not sufficient. In some dialects I27</page><page sequence="26">ANITA MITTWOCH ought and used exhibit main verb behaviour not only in governing to (as for all dialects) but in taking dummy do for subject auxiliary inversion and negation: (I43) Did he ought to do that? (44) He didn't use(d) to do that. Yet for many speakers of such dialects these forms are still barred from following another modal: (I45) *Might he ought to do that? (146) *He can't possibly use(d) to do that. (Cf. Pullum &amp; Wilson I977.) It has also been suggested that the reason for the ungrammaticality of (1408142) is simply that the modals are morphologically defective; just as they lack the inflected third person singular and the -ing form, so they lack the base (or BI) form (McCawley I97I, Pullum &amp; Wilson I977). But this is suspicious; for the base form, if it existed, would be indistinguishable morphologically from the form that actually exists for present tense modals. Moreover, as shown by (I43) and (144), the modals ought and used, which are historically past tense forms, can actually function as the base form in some dialects. And am to is often included with the modals precisely because it occurs only in tensed forms; yet am in its other uses certainly does not lack a base form. I suggest therefore that the modals govern the BI because otherwise there would be two modals -or rather two members of a class subsuming the modals and to -in sequence. The objection that some modals do in fact govern a to infinitive (ought, used and modal am) can be countered by the observation that the ban on modals in sequence is not an absolute one either, witness (147)(a) He wouldn't dare say that to my face. (b) No newspaper would dare publish his denial. In these examples dare shows modal characteristics precisely in governing the BI: compare He dared to say that to my face. Yet it is governed by another modal.20 [20] Dare is also marginally possible after a lexical verb taking a BI complement: (i) She helped him dare stand up for himself. Several non-standard dialects, notably Scots, permit double modals, especially with can as the second: (ii) The manager will can tell you. (iii) He'll no can come this week. The examples are from Brown and Millar (I980). Can is also attested dialectally as occurring in the gerund and in a to infinitive: (iv) Nobody seems to can do it. It might be thought that in such dialects can is simply a main verb that selects for a BI. However Brown (ms) lists at least two features, namely VP deletion and quantifier floating, according to which an occurrence of can after another modal can still display auxiliary-like behaviour. 128</page><page sequence="27">BARE INFINITIVE COMPLEMENTS There is thus strong evidence that the syntax is responsible for the morphological gap rather than the other way round. The question arises whether here too the syntax is itself driven by the semantics. As far as a sequence of two tensed modals is concerned, the answer may well be a qualified yes, as argued by Palmer in the paper cited above. His argument does not however carry over to the sequence tensed modal + to; the constraint against this sequence seems to be entirely syntactic. I have said nothing in this appendix on the meaning of the BI complements of modals. It is likely that, as suggested by an anonymous reviewer, the complements of epistemic modals denote propositions, which would of course present us with another syntax-semantics mismatch, in this case with the reverse of the cause, allow case where full infinitives seem to denote events. The complements of root modals would presumably denote 'eventualities' (events, processes or states). Nor have I dealt with the question of the meaning of the complements of to in full infinitival constructions, where also it may turn out that similar constructions mask dissimilar meanings. I leave this topic to further research. Author's address: Department of English, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem Mount Scopus 91go5 Jerusalem Israel ADDITIONAL FOOTNOTES [3] Pace Chisholm (197I).-I know of two other structures denoting events that cannot be negated. One, which I mentioned in Mittwoch (I988), is the complement of the existential use of the perfect. In (i) (i) John has not taken a second helping. the negative must have scope over the perfect. With narrow-scope negation the sentence would mean: 'There has been at least one occasion when John did not take a second helping', but this is hardly a possible reading of the sentence. The reason is that the existential perfect takes an event complement. The second structure denotes actions, which are a special type of events. Consider (ii) He carefully shut the door before telling me this. In (ii) the adverb relates to the doing of the action rather than the way it is done. If we negate (ii) the result is ill-formed: (iii) He carefully didn't shut the door before telling me this. Instead of (iii), the language has a verb of 'non-action': (iv) He carefully refrained from shutting the door before telling me this. [8] I have seen one counter-example with make: (i) Instinct made them not waste the peeling of their apple. (from D. H. Lawrence: The Rainbow) and have caught myself saying (ii) ... if they can make the professors not lose face. Both would be examples of VP negation, but I do not find them grammatical. I also 129 5 LIN 26</page><page sequence="28">ANITA MITTWOCH disagree with Kayne's (I984) judgment that (iii) and (iv) can have narrow scope for nobody: (iii) Please God make nobody be at her birthday party. (iv) Don't let nobody be at her birthday party. If any speakers do get the narrow-scope reading, then I suspect that they interpret (iii) as Please God make it happen that nobody will be at her birthday party and similarly with (iv). In that case the complement would be propositional. REFERENCES Bennis, H. &amp; Hoekstra, T. (I989). Why Kaatje was not heard sing a song.
