<plain_text><page sequence="1">V.--ENGLISH THOUGHT IN THE 18TH CENTURY? BESIDES the remarkable work whose name is placed at the head of this article, two other important contributions have recently been made to the history of philosophical thinking in England. ;Professor Kuno Fischer has taken his old monograph on Francis _ Bacon (known to English readers since 1857 in Mr. Oxenford's translation), and so recast and enlarged it as to give not only a more adequate representation of Bacon as a man and thinker, but an account of the development of the 'Philosophy of Experience' as far as Hume, no longer quite too meagre to stand as a side-piece to that history of Modern Philosophy which he has traced on a great scale from Descartes through Spinoza and Leibnitz to Kant and his successors. The book in its new form appeared in 1875, and in the same year, by a curious coinci- dence, the late M. de Remusat, who had before followed close on Fischer with an independent monograph on Bacon, came forward with a History of Philosophy in ;England from Bacon to Locke.+ There is evidence of genuine research in this work, * History of English Thought in the Eighteenth Century, by LESLIE STEPHAN 2 vols.

On the presenit occasion it is simply mentioned, because of the period which it seeks to compass. Where M. de Re6musat leaves off, there Mr. Leslie Stephen in his brilliant volumes may be said to take up the tale; and, though there could not well be a greater difference in the spirit and scope of, the two works, there is much in the later history that may be better understood for the careful record of the earlier time which we owe to a foreign hand. Much as he has to say about philosophers and their work, great and small, Mr. Stephen has not written or professed to write a History of Philosophy in the stricter sense, His aim and even his method of constructing the book are disclosed with the utmost candour. It was his first object to trace systemati- cally and in full detail the course of Religious Thought from 1688 to 1750, the period defined and rapidly sketched in Mr. Pattison's well-known essay. Lechler, more than thirty years ago, gave an adequate account of the Deists proper, but did not concern himirself, save incidentally, with their orthodox oppon- ents, though these (as Mr. Pattison sought particularly to impress) betrayed the same general tendencies of thought. It accordingly seemed necessary to Mr. Stephen to trace back the common theological tendencies of the age to the philosophical ideas then prevalent; and upon this there was an interest in showing how the principles accepted in philosophy and theology were applied to practice in the sphere of moral and political thought, or, again, reflected in the imaginative literature of the tine. As thus explained, the scope of the book is of course very different from that of a technical History of Philosophy, and it is in fact so comprehensive that almost everything appears to be included in the author's survey of thought or intellectual activity in the century, except the work of special science. Is he justified in giving to the word Thought at once such an extension and such a restriction, as to include in the same treatise with thinkers like Locke and Hume and Butler, poets and novelists and preachers like Burns and Fielding and Wesley, to the exclusion of scientific inquirers like Newton or Black or Hunter? Mr. Stephen, though himself doubting whether his title is not too ambitious, evidently is guided by some definite principle in determining the scope and limits of his work; and perhaps it may be gathered, in default of more express statement, from the beginning of his last chapter where he passes, after dealing successively with philosophers, theo- logians moralists and publicists, to the delineation of what he</page><page sequence="3">354 Englisht Thought in the 18th Century. calls the 'Characteristics' of the age. The literature of a people, we are told, may be disposed under three heads: (1) his- torical, which records facts and sumamarises or amplifies existing knowledge; (2) speculative, which discusses the truth of the theories binding knowledge together; and (3) imaginative, which utters the emotions generated by the conditions in which mnen are or believe themselves to be placed. Here, Science is either excluded from Literature altogether as a technical pursuit, Qr it is included ina the wider sense -of History, which regards nature in all its varied aspects as well as man. In either case, since History itself is not brought within Mr. Stephen's scheme, Science as the sum of existing positive knowledge about the world is naturally excluded. But besides the properly philo- sophic thought which seeks rationally to co-ordinate the variety of human knowledge with a view more or less direct to practical conduct, it is natural to consider the imaginative syntlhesis, since by this (as he urges) is determined the action of the majority of mankind, and farther (as he mnight have added) because the philosophical synthesis, not being in the same way verifiable as the generalisations of positive science, must always contain an element of subjective sentiment allying it to ima- ginative literature. If some such view was present to Mr. Stephen's mind, there is not wanting a good reason for the limita- tion of subjects in his book; while, on the other hand, his readers ,may be glad that he has so far widened his scheme as to give them , in his well and often brilliantly written pages, a varied picture of national thought and feeling alive with human interest, instead of the abstract and one-featured record, apt to ba misleading, which History of Philosophy commonly is. Nor in this case at least is good literary effect procured at the expense of careful research. The one objection, perhaps, in point of form, that can be brought against the book as a History of Thought, is the unequal prominence given to the phases of religious as compared with philosophical opinion,-if it is not too ungracious to say so, when Mr. Stephen has implied in his ingenuous preface that, but for his interest in the religious movements, we might not have had from hinm a view of the century at all. In Mr. Stephen's view one figure stands forward at the beginning, and re-appears towering above all others in every scene of the history. -Whether it be the philosophy, or the theology, or the morals, or the politics of the century that is under review, the decisive word, representing the last outcome of what was in men's minds, is always uttered by Hume. Half- way through the century dogmatic speculation about the super- natural ceased of a sudden: Hume had spoken, and ever after-</page><page sequence="4">English Thought in the 18th century. 355 wards those who were concerned to save the conclusions of metaphysical philosophy had- no choice but to try for them by another road. About the same. time the hot theological warfare that had filled the world with clamour for two generations died away: Hume had sprung a mine that sent into the air both deists who were not Christians, and Christian apologists who were but deists. It took fifty years from the time of Locke before the utilitarian ethics, so congenial to the national mind, got a definite philosophical expression-from Hume. Hume left-nothing unsaid which the acutest intellect could say about political philosophy so long as men were supposed independent atoms, and there was no thought of organic evolution or serious consideration of historical development. And if the historical spirit began to awake in the second half of the century, in pre- paration for the work of the age to come, even in this forward movement Hume too had part. When we remember, besides, who it was that almost disowned the rugged work of his strong youth, and desired to be judged by the fastidiously polished but less,searching essays of his priine, we see with what reason Mr. Stephen may take Hume as quite the representative thinker of a century quick with intellectual activity, only not the deepest. Should we try, farther, to gain a comprehensive view of the whole course of thought in the century, as it presents itself to Mr. Stephen, the spectacle resolves itself into a number of scenes which, described in very general terms, are these: (1) A move- ment of determined philosophical criticism lasting fifty years or more from Locke to Hume, destructive of the whole edifice of speculative metaphysic reared by Descartes and his followers in the 17th century, but neither itself constructive nor exciting (in England), while the century lasted, any philosophical con- struction of real and permanent importance. (2) A rationalistic movement in religion, prepared in the 17th century, and follow- ing naturally from the principles of Protestantism, at first promoted by the influence of the current philosophical ideas, yet in the end suppressed by the advance of philosophical opinion, orvchanged into a 'historical investigation of the external evidences for a supernatural revelation. (3) A movement to find a rational ground for moral action, by way of supplement to the weakened force of the theol-ogical sanction, or as a substitute for it when altogether rejected. (4) A corresponding movement, less earnastly maintained, to explain on rational principles the social and political relations subsisting between jmen, upon the decay of the notion of supernatural ordinance. (5) Within this last movement, a special determination towards economic inquiry. (6) Finally, a varied literary movement, at first reflecting very faithfully the dominant philosophical</page><page sequence="5">356 English Thought in the 18th Century. and religious conceptions, but afterwards, as these became effete without begetting others, opening out into new lines of sentiment which anticipated the rational thought and inquiry of the coming time. It is not possible, in short compass, to do anything like justice to the working out of so comprehensive a scheme as this of Mr. Stephen's, but as the philosophical and ethical move- ments, which are of special interest to the readers of this journal, happen to be rather compendiously treated, we may look a little more closely at his view of these. The dogmatic philosophy which the 'English Criticism' broke down was the metaphysical system inaugurated by Des- cartes, and, according to Mr. Stephen (though the point is never very clearly established and is rather doubtful), the same system, with its abstract assumptions and deductive method, -dominated the minds of the chief English rationalists in religion, whether orthodox or deistical. He therefore begins with a short account of the Cartesian philosophy. He makes no reference to Bacon, and but incidental reference to Hobbes, the great English thinkers of the 17th century, and this may appear strange; yet there is reason for the omission. Bacon and Hobbes were, each in his generation and in his own way, true representatives of the English spirit in philosophy, but it was not till Locke aban- doned any such attempt as either of theirs to construct an objec- tive system of universal knowledge, and threw himself upon a critical investigation of the mind's powers, that England joined properly in the modern philosophical movement of Europe. It is true that Descartes himself, the great leader of the movement, had sought, from his philosophical starting-point, to work out also an explanation of the concrete phenomena of nature. Before the end of the 17th century, however, the attempt was practi- call'y discredited by the advance of positive physical science from- the time of Galileo; and Locke showed a true appreciation of the Zeitgeist, when, in an age that produced " such inasters as the great Huygenius and the incomparable Mr. Newton, with some other of that strain," he thought it "ambition enough to be employed as an under-labourer in clearing the ground a little, and removing some of the rubbish that lies in the way to knowledge". In words of too great modesty, we have here from Locke himself a statement of the true work of philosophy in modern times, and we see how in him English philosophical thought comes into relation with the general European move- ment which, however, diverted by this or that speculative genius, has always been directed to the fundamental inquiry as to the ground and limits of knowledge. In particular, the Cartesian philosophy was an attempt to found certainty of</page><page sequence="6">English Thought in the 18th Century. 357 knowledge upon the immediate deliverances of adult con- sciousness, without consideration of the sources and develop- ment of knowledge, and in respect of mnethod sought to proceed by way of rational deduction in constructing a fabric of meta- physical doctrine. This was exactly what Locke set himself from the very foundation to oppose. That the question of the validity and limits of knowledge must depend upon an inquiry into its origin and development was his deepest philosophical conviction; and though, as Mr. Stephen well points out, he and his successors till Hume were really at one with the Cartesians in restricting the inquiry to the consciousness of the individual as known by introspection, and had not a different conception of the meaning of real existence, yet the difference of method could not but lead to very different conclusions. How far Locke himself applied the critical solvent to the system of dogirtatic metaphysics and how, with diverse aims, it was farther applied by Berkeley and Hume, is clearly and vigorously set forth in general lines by iMr. Stephen. The result was what we know- that rational speculation by itself, apart from experience, was stripped of all authority. Mr. Stephen, having always more than an antiquarian interest in his subject-being, in fact, for an historian, too much rather than too little apt to sit in judgment, as well as set forth and explain-is especially careful to consider the attitude of Hume, so as to find a way out of the deadlock to which the great doubter seemed to bring all human inquiry, while shattering the system of speculative metaphysic. He finds that Hume's point of view was essentially artificial; that he did not think of the mind of the individual in its true relation to the social organism-as moulded by influences quite different from the disjointed and haphazard sense-impressioiis out of which he supposed the whole fabric of intellectual consciousness had ever ainew to be reared by and for each person; that he had no historical sense, much less a glimmer of that scientific notion of the evolution of all organic life which since then has so profoundly affected the work of philosophical interpretation. The criticism, though not very elaborate, is, as far as it goes, admirably conducted, and is an attempt of a kind that has been too seldom made by sympathisers with Hume's philosophical spirit to maintain it intelligently in the altered state of human knowledge since his time. As such, Mr. Stephen's judgment deserves the attention of those cham- pions of a different philosophy, who seem to think that a textual sifting of the writings- of Locke aild Hurne, revealing manifold inconsistelncies and defects of thought, is the most effective way of dealing a death-blow to the cause of Experientialism at the present day. But-in exhibiting Hume as the hero of a philoso-</page><page sequence="7">358 English nought in the 18th Century. phic movement which effectually accomplished a work of destruc- tion yet did it from principles which could lead to no construc- tive result, so that only after a long lapse of years and by means of varied research in history and special science was there gra- dually formed, in these latter days, something like an adequate experiential philosophy-Mr. Stephen has not given sufficient promninence to one very marked phase of English intellectual in- quiry in the 18th century, and has thus been led to do some in- justice, if not to Hume's predecessors, at least to his contem- poraries and successors within the century. Psychology, if it is viewed as science, has yet an exceptional standing in relation to philosophy, and cannot be neglected in a history of philoso- phic thought in England, where it has been so steadily cultivated without being too carefully discriminated from philosophy proper. Now Mr. Stephen, in his exposition, nowhere gives much atten- tion to the progress of psychology, though this was very remark- able within the century; and hence he fails to assign due iu- portance to one in particular of Hurne's contemporaries-David Hartley. His somewhat disparaging estimate of Reid, in the last generation of the ceiltury, miglht also have been relieved by an allowance of serious purpose as a psychological inquirer to one who himself achieved something, and moved others to achieve more. It should be well understood that Locke's work, the beginning of all that followed in England, had two sides which, however telated to one another, may be cleaily distinguished, and were in fact the occasion of two different lines of development in English thought. Essentially a philosopher in his concern for the general problem of knowledge, he sought for the solution of it in a psychological spirit, and he was the first who expressly took up this position. He differed from his predecessors, not only in his philosophical conclusion, but from all of them-even his own countryman Hobbes-in putting forward the psycholo- gical question of the growth of knowledge as the first to be answered. And however undeveloped his own psychology was, it soon appeared from what followed how effectively he had given an impulse to new inquiry. Berkeley did not only philosophise after the manner of Locke, showing, with the special theological purpose that moved him, how all knowledge was based on expe- rience, and that no experience could be assigned portending an absolute existence of nmatter: he began in his New Theory of Vision the work of special psychological investigation after the manner of positive science. Even Hume, though his lasting im- portance consists in his properly philosophical activity, set out at the begiinning with the distinctly psychological aim of found- ino, a " science of man " on " experience and observation " like</page><page sequence="8">Rnglish Thought in the 18th Century. 359 " the other sciences," or, as he also expressed it, of making an " application of experimental philosophy to inoral subjects," as it had already been made to physical nature. Now what Hume thus professed to do, but diverging into the critico-philosophical vein left for the most part undonle, this Hartley expressly essayed and carried througll, however he may have also sought to com- bine therewith anl extraneous (ethical and religious) purpose; and he did it as followilig out the work of Locke in the spirit of Newton. If Locke, Berkeley anid Hume are a series represent- ing the natural development of English philosophical thinking at the time, Locke, Berkeley and Hartley are another series re- presenting a movement of psychological inquiry then begun and destined to become ever broader and deeper. And the second series is certainly not the least importanit when we look beyond the century to what followed. The most characteristic English work of the later time has been donie in the track of Hartley rather than of Hume. This is true even of the work, not psy- chological, of the younger Mill, who, though he presented as a logical theory of positive science a doctrine allied to Hume's negative philosophy, did not borrow it from Hume, but rather worked it out independently as the proper philosophical comple- ment to the psychology of Hartley and his father, Hartley's close adherenlt. It is still more true of the psychological work of the so-called Associationists, James Mill and his successors, whether of the straiter sect of iiidividualists, or of the broader persuasion inspire(d with the doctrine of evoluition. The note of English psychology thus far has been the study of mental phenomenia in relation with physiological conditions (wherever these can be made manifest), and this without express metaphysical assump- tion, or even to the exclusion of metaphysical assumption, as in the positive sciences generally, whose advance has depenlded on their being thus pursued. To Hartley, more than any other, it is due that the science of miind has been brought (on the side on which it can be brought) into relation with physiology, and it is too little recognised with what extraordinary inisight he antici- pated some, of the most important results now established in pllysiological psychology; while, if it cannot be equally said that he steered clear of nmetaphysical assumptions at the beginning, it may be affirmed that his positive doctrine of mental acquimition i,s developed withouit the least reference to thein. To speak of him, as Mr. Stephen does, as a materialist, because he takes account of physical conditions throughout, is no more fitting, than it would be to use the same terin of any scientific psycho- logist of the present time; or, if he is so described beeause he supposed the consciousness of the individual to result wholly from a grouping of incidental experiences, the term is no mnore appli-.</page><page sequence="9">360 Eqnglish Thought in the 18th Century. cable to him than to Locke. Curiously incoherent as are the parts of his general philosophic system (if philosophic it can be called), his psychology stands as one of the most remarkable in- tellectual productions of the 18th century, destined later, if not at the time, to have the deepest influence upon 'English Thought'. Passing now to the Moralists, we find Mr. Stephen's exposi- tion guided by one main conception. So long, he maintains, as theology was a vital belief in the world and preserved a suffi- cient infusion of the anthropomorphic element, it afforded a complete and satisfactory answer to the common questions of ethics-what is meant by 'ought' and ' goodness' and what are the motives that induce us to be good. Nor did the inquiry into the nature of our moral sentiments naturally suggest itself; the only moral inquiry likely to flourish was casuistry, or the discussion as to the details of tllat legal code whose origin and sanctions were abundantly clear. But wider specutlations as to morality inevitably occurred as soon as the vision of God became faint. It was growing faint in the 17th century when Hobbes could venture to put the bold questions he did. It had become so faint in the 18th century that men stood in face of a strictly practical issue: How was morality to survive theology? Hence the outburst of ethical inquiry by such a multitude of thinkers. Mr. Stephen ranges thein under three main heads: (1) the In- tellectual School of Clark, Wollaston and Price; (2) the Common Sense School of Butler, Hutchesoin and Reid; (3) the Utilitarian School, founding on Locke and comprehending such different representatives as Hume, Waterland, Tucker and Paley. Shaftesbury and Mandeville are at the same time treated inci- dentally at considerable length, as representing extreme phases of the recoil from the abstract metaphysics of the intellectualists; and a separate section is farther given to Hartley and Adam Smith, because of their different atternpts to trace the psycholo- gical genesis or derivation of the moral faculty in man. In these ethical sections, Mr. Stephen never loses his hold upon the reader's attention, and not seldom he appears, perhaps, at his best both as a writer and as a philosophical critic. Especially when he has to deal- with Hume, the exposition becomes masterly, and there is a very striking argument against looking for the root of morality in such an individualistic psychology as that beyond which all Huine's acuteness never carried him. Mr. Stephen's way of putting the alternative position is to say that the ethical problem cannot be solved except on the basis of a scientific sociology, but, whether called sociology or a truer psychology that refuses to look at the mental development of the individual apart fromi the social medium into which he is born, the basis is that which inust be chosen by any clear-</page><page sequence="10">English Thought in the 18th Century. 361 sighted experientialist at the present day. After Hume, the thinker wlho here as a moralist, or elsewhere as a philosophic theologian, receives most worthy appreciation from Mr. Stephen, is Butler. The serious, not to say sombre, mood of the man, oppressed with a sense of the dire reality of existence in an op- timistic age, strikes a sympathetic chord ill the mind of his critic, anid evokes a response whose strength is hardly weakened by their speculative difference of opinion as to the supernatural. Of Mr. Stephen's other estimates, that of Samuel Clarke is among the most successful. Like Butler, Clarke falls to be treated at two places, in his different characters of theologian and moralist, and both must be consulted for the judgment of him in either capacity. Mr. Stephen compares him, by a very happy inspira- tion, to another famous Cambridge doctor, better known in these days but not more prominent as an intellectual figure than Clarke was in his time-namely, Whewell. Clarke's distinction, while bred under English conditions and holding in great part by native authorities in science and philosophy, was that he had drunk also at foreigni springs, and knew at once how far it became an English theologian to go with outlandish speculative philosophers and when it was necessary to stop or even to lift up his voice against their wayward aberratiolls. Mr. Stephen rather overstates his dependence on Descartes, or overlooks his dependence on Newton and his relation to Locke. There is also some want of precision in the passage referred to (Vol. I., p. 119), where Leibnitz is specially named as the thinker to whom Clarke stood " in the same sort of relation which Whewell occu- pied to modern German philosophers" (meaning Kant). But, all the same, the comparison remains a very felicitous one, and the remark which follows, that " in softening the foreign doctrines to suit English tastes he succeeds in enervating them without makinig them substantially more reasonable," while throwing a real light upon Clarke, is a good instance of Mr. Stephen's power, displayed throughout his volumes, of dropping observations that strike home in regard to thinkers not so far removed a,s those of the 18th century. However, as a history of ethical speculation in England at the time, Mr. Stephen's review of the moralists strikes one as defec- tive in several ways. No explanation is offered of the remarkable fact that the philosophical activity of the English mind was directed so predominantly into the line of ethical speculation, not slackening here even when about the middle of the century intellectual speculation was struck with sudden collapse. The review is also too abruptly ended and is more abruptly begun; in particular, no attempt being made at the beginning to show the relation in which the different ethical efforts of the 18th</page><page sequence="11">362 English Thought in the 18th Centuiey. century stood to earlier English efforts in the 17th. Again, by classing together under the one head of 'Utilitarians,' moralists so differen-t as Hume on the one hand, and Locke, Waterland, Tucker and Paley on the other, the common prejudice against Utilitarianism, as if it were a- system of selfishness, tends to be confirmed. And the principle itself which guides the whole exposition-that the philosophical inquiry into the grounds of right action was determined by the weakening of the religious salnction-seenms to come short of expressing the facts, both first and last, or even is rather obviously at variance with some of them. The strong point of the English mind in theoretical philosophy, as Mr. Stephen remarks early in his work, is its vigorous grasp of facts, its weakness is its comparative indifference to logical symmetry. Not less characteristic has been the English habit of thinking always with some view to practice, and making the theory of practice its chief philosophical concern. Far back in the days of the Middle Age, when the Church drew to itself the intellectual service of all the western peoples, and there was but one philosophy-Christian and European, the national tendency above all things to moralise already betrayed itself in English Schoolmen like John of Salisbury, and Roger Bacon anticipated that conception of knowledge as subservient to human practice which another Bacon is supposed to have first disclosed to the world.* The later utterance by Francis Bacon, coinciding with the beginning of the modern era of philosophical thought when the nations each went their own way, was indeed so peculiarly impressive that his countrymen are not unnaturally thought to have been ever since bound by its spell; but it is nearer the truth to see in the great preacher of Induction only the representative for the time of the national habit of thinking. Hobbes, who owed nothing to Bacon and took nothing from him, was not less practically minded in his deductive speculations, having never absent from his view the regulation of human conduct in society even when dealing with the most general aspects of knowledge. Nor was Locke, who owed no more to Hobbes thani Hobbes tom Bacon, but with sturdy originality worked out his inquiry into human knowledge as an English counterpiece to the Cartesian philosophy reigning abroad, a whit behind either in -his recognition of morality as " the proper science and business of mankind in general," while the useful arts should be the concern of special experts in default of a * The- relation of the later to the earlier Bacon is shortly but effec- tively indicated in the Introductory Lecture delivered by Prof. Adamson at Owens College in October last: Roger Bacon; T'he Philosophy of Science in the Middle Ages.

Berkeley, again, speculated with a moral or religious, at all events a directly practical, object in view; and Hume's moral philosophy remains the most serious, as by himself it was the most cherished, of his achievements. What a moralising vein pervades the general literature of our country, to the sacrifice of artistic aim, has not seldom been remarked, though it has never been more forcibly exhibited than by Mr. Stephen himself in describing the literary activity proper of the period. It is intelligible, then, or at least it is not surprising, how varied anid .constantly renewed should have been the attemlpts by English thinkers of the 18th century, smaller as well as greater, to determine the reason and aims of human conduct, and how they should have been continued at a time when abstract metaphysical inquiry became paralysed; more especially since the psycholo- gical impulse, which has told so markedly on the developmenit of ethical thought in England, went on (as we have seeil) steadily gathering streingth, unaffected if not re-inforced by the circum-, stanlces of the philosophical dead-block. With such a determination of the English mind towards practical philosophy, even as exhibited in the 18th century only, it is in any case hardly to be expected that then for the first time ethical inquiry should all of a sudden begin; and yet this, it must be said, is the rather misleading impression given by Mr. Stephen's chapter on the moralists. It is true he alludes at starting to Hobbes's bold speculations on morality launched in the middle of the previous century, but he does not suggest, as in the interest of historical understanding he might even have impressed, the fact that some of the most characteristic ethical positions of the later time were already taken up at the earlier. For example,the so-called Intellectual School of Clarke,Wollaston, and Price (of which, by the way, the shortcomings are much more effectively exposed than its serious scientific import is acknow- ledged) is treated without apy reference to Cudworth; though Cudworth, besides enunciating all the most distinctive doctrines of the school-as Price, by borrowing wholesale from him rather than from Clarke, allows-was the author even of the " magnilo- que.nt trick of language about the eternal and immutable nature of things" which Mr. Stephen declares to be the sole relic that survived its decay. It is also a real omissioin, in tracing the origin of Utilitarianism, whether in its stricter sense or in the looser sense of Hedonismn adopted in the heading of Mr. .Stephen's section, to make no reference to Cumberland, who has been not untruly described as the first philosophical moralist that appeared in this country, and who certainly did (to whatever dreary extent) reason about the grounds of human conduct in</page><page sequence="13">364 ELnglish Thought in the 18th Century. the spirit considered most essentially English. If a period is to be understood historically, it must not be taken too strictly, at least a parte prc; and unfortunately it is just in dealing with the moral philosophers that Mr. Stephen confines himself with exceptional rigour to his century, thereby not a little reducing the value of the very part of his work that otherwise comes nearest to fulfilling the conditions of a history of, philo- sophical thought. It is impossible also not to regret the confusion caused by classing under the one head of Utilitarianism all those moralists who in any way make the rule of right depend-ent on the pro- motion of happiness. Of course, this use of the term may be justified, because, in strictness, it applies equally to the selfish pursuit of one's own happiness and to the conscious regard for the good of all; but nobody knows better than Mr. Stephen, or indeed has better set forth on the whole, the distinctive character of that ethical view which was lifted at once into importance by the genius of Hume, and has later become so identified with the English name in practical philosophy. Neither in a theo- retic nor in any other point of view is justice done to Hume's serious attempt to find a rational explanation of morality when he is ranked with theological moralists like Waterland, who solve all difficulties by direct resort to the supernatural sanction, or even with Locke, who in a more round-about and uncertain way has recourse to the same constraining authority. How greatly concerned Hume was to prove the natural existence in man of altruistic sentiments is so clearly apprehended and plainly set forth by Mr. Stephen, that from him at least we have a right to expect no such indiscriminate classing as may tend to obscure the most fundamental distinction. Not only, however, is the loose classification made, but, in his eagerness to show how much better the system of altruistic (but depenident) morality can now be based, we find Mr. Stephen carried to the length of -committing an injustice. When he says that " later writers of the Benthamist school generally show a reluctalnce, as did Ben- tham himself, to admit the possibility of a perfectly disinterested emotion " (ii. p. 105), he says what it would be difficult to make good of any later utilitarian of philosophical standing. And speaking of Bentham, it is surely by an arbitrary exclusion that the author of the Principles of Morals and Legislation (written before the year 1780) is referred to the present century. Though there is truth in the remark that " the history of Utilitarianism, as an active force" belongs to the 19th century, at least as re- gards civil legislationl, yet nothing is more characteristic of the history of English thought in the 18th century, than that in the last generation of it there should have been formulated thosE prin-</page><page sequence="14">English Thought in1 the 18th entury. 365 ciples of public and private right of which so revolutionary an application was destined in time to be made. Nor if it should be granted that Bentham's utilitarianism, as an attempt to base morality upon observation, reduces it " to a mere chaos of empi- rical doctrines" as much as Hume's, is this anything but a reason for associating it with the work of the 18th century. There would be more reason, indeed, from Mr. Stephen's point of view, in referring even the younger Mill to the 18th, than in taking tlhe opposite course with his great master in politics and morals. A few re-marks, in conicluision, seemed called for on that con- ception which, if it can hardly be said in fact to guide, yet stands in the front of Mr. Stephen's treatmient of the moral philosophers. Were the manifold ethical theories that sprang up in the century all so many attempts to find a secular rule of human conduict in default of the decayed or decaying influence of theological precepts? The notion undoubtedly fits some of the facts and involves a general truth. Ethics, so prominent a department of the ancient philosophical systems, was of all the inore obvious subjects of rationial speculation the least cultivated when, after the long centuries of faith without thinking, the Christian doctors of the Middle Age be anr to thinl about their faith. Not that the practical rule of life was made a matter of no concern ; but it had beein provided so expressly by -super- natural authority that there could be no question except as to how it should be applied in the varying circuimstances of the lhuman lot. Henice -all such reasoning as there was about human conduct assumed the form anid the name of Moral Theology, while the complementary doctrine of Natural Theoloay was but a part, however large, of the theoretic philosophy of the time. Theology stood for the whole of practical philosophy; anid thus in no directioni-not eveni that of positive physical science-could the modern spirit, when it awoke, break away more decisively from the bondage of Scholasticism than by enterinig on the path of ethical inquiry. Every great ethical system that has since been given to the world has truly been an attempt to find a strictly rational law of conduct. - Such were the systems of Spinoza -and Kant, and such also was the system of Hume. Such even, as Mr. Stephen miight fairly contend, was the character of some of the minor ethical doctrines whiclh he passes unider review. But -hardly will his readers carry away the impression that the- English moralists of the 18th century generally had reached the stagre of philosophical detachment from the old theological basis. Had the "vision of God" become faint in Butler-Butler to whom conscieence was truly the voice of a supernatural judge, and whose psychology was the controversial buttress of his ethics rather than its philoso- &gt;24</page><page sequence="15">.366 Philosophy in France. phical foundation? Was Clarke the less a Schoolrnan in spirit because he lived in the days of Newton, an-d affected the form of scientific demonistration ? Or was Paley satisfied that the truth should be told without the fear of hell and the hope of heaven ? Mr. Stephen must drop out of view all but two or three of his English moralists before he can see in the 18th cerntury the clear beginnings of that determined search for a naturalistic ground of ethics which is being, pursued in the 19th, but which not even now is admitted without protest and resistanice. The truth, perhaps, is that Mr. Stephen, who is always as much a critic as an historian alnd, what is more, a critical thinker anxiously concerned about the speculative issues of his own time, has been somewhlat over-ready to see the present in the past, and to reckon with the long-departed as if they were adversaries or allies. This fault, if it is one, he can best expiate by writing another work, that not only will give better scope for the exercise of his special faculty but will be the more valuable according as he gives it free play and does not scruple, while tracing the currents of opinion, to direct them to the utmost of his power. Let hiin give us that critical' History of Eniglish Thought in the Nineteenth Century which the very defects as well as the excellences of his present volumes mark hiin out as signally able to essay.
