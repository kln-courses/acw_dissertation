Almost unsurpassed in interest to both layman and scholar is the site of Troy, "the actual citadel-if there ever was one-that came to be immortalized, magnified, and gilded with poetic glamor, in the Iliad" (General Introduction, Vol. I, p. 5), the stronghold of north- western Anatolia in the Bronze Age which holds the key to relations between east and west at that crucial period in the history of Mediterranean civilization. No justifica- tion was needed, therefore, when the University of Cin- cinnati Expedition set themselves in 1932 to reexamine 2 See E. H.

The seven cam- paigns through 1938 more than justified their hopes: "a nearly full series of 'certified' material was secured, yielding new evidence for an understanding and differ- entiation of the successive Trojan settlements, and pro- viding a broader foundation for dating than was hereto- fore available," (ibid., p. 7). Even as the exploration represented the finest achievements in the development of archaeological methods of investigation, so the pub- lication of the results is a model of the most meticulous, sound, and thorough excavation report, furnishing, as it does, all the information, verbal, numerical, and pic- torial, that scholars could want regarding the successive strata. So strong, in fact, has been the sense of respon- sibility of the authors to record as completely and ac- curately as possible, for all future time, evidence of such great significance, that they have permitted themselves the minimum of that interpretation which was one of their objectives and which these scholars are so pre- eminently qualified to offer. Any scholar in the future who wishes to work directly with any part of the mate- rial may use these volumes with complete confidence that he has before him the next best to the site and the mate- rial themselves. Further advances in Bronze Age study will only add to the understanding of the material: the foundations are firmly established here. The scholar or student, however, who has anxiously awaited answers to general questions regarding the history, culture, and foreign relations of Troy will be a trifle disappointed; but he will have his appetite whetted for a general in- terpretation of the results, which, it is earnestly hoped, will follow the detailed report in the four volumes announced. The first two volumes include, beside the General In- troduction, the Early Bronze Age represented by settle- ments I-V, each with its several phases. The remarkable continuity of the culture in this period of a millennium or more is its most striking characteristic. A gradual development in architecture, pottery, and other artifacts can be clearly traced, and the absence of either a break in traditions or sudden innovations is evidence against "the arrival of new cultural factors from abroad" (Vol. II, p. vii). "The lasting power of persistent local tradition, virtually unaffected by alien influences" (ibid.) is attested by the analytical survey of the material from the thirty phases of Troy I-V. After the General Introduction, in which appear a statement of the organization of the expedition and its objectives, brief accounts of the campaigns year by year, disposition of the objects found, an explanation of the division into settlements and phases, and a description of the plan of the whole publication, each numbered settlement is treated as a unit, the First and Second in Volume I, the Third, Fourth, and Fifth in Volume II. The scheme is the same for each: an introduction sum- marizes previous excavations, gives a statement of the areas examined by the Cincinnati Expedition, formulates characteristics of the settlement and analyses the evi- dence for external relations and chronology (these sec- tions are most valuable for the general reader), then classifies the material found by means of tables and de- scriptive lists of types and shapes, generously illustrated with photographs and drawings. There follows for each phase a detailed description of the character of the stratum and its architectural remains, with a catalogue of the objects found. Space permits only the briefest outline of some of the most striking characteristics of each period. Troy I was founded as a fortified seat of the rulers who con- trolled northwestern Asia Minor; it retained its royal character, with ambitious walls of stone, spacious houses of stone and crude brick, and the beginnings of the vigorous local pottery, through ten phases which, to judge from comparison of finds with other Aegean mate- rial, must have begun ca. 3000 B.c. and continued to ca. 2600 B.C. The fortification walls of the eight (in con- trast to Dorpfeld's three) phases of Troy II follow the same general development begun in Troy I; the massive walls with flanking towers were expanded, remodelled, and strengthened in successive stages; in the final one the whole settlement was destroyed by fire. It was in IIc that the great megaron was built and that the char- acteristic Trojan vase, the two-handled goblet called depas amnphikypellon by Schliemann, began its career, which was to extend "through... thirteen successive phases ..., each marked by new architectural construc- tions" (Vol. I, p. 209) into Troy V. This continuity over a long period is characteristic of many Trojan vase shapes; pottery and other objects join with architecture, both military and domestic, in emphasizing the constantly evolving local culture of Troy in the Early Bronze Age. Troy III had previously been considered an insig- nificant successor to the burned city, but the Cincinnati Expedition has provided for the first time a certified series of objects which unquestionably belong to Troy III and reveal it as much "more than a wretched village" (Vol. II, p. 5) which was oriented differently from its predecessors but carried on their traditions at the same time that it made innovations along the lines already established. The all-stone house walls, often still stand- ing to a height of more than 2 meters, are strikingly dis- tinct from the architectural remains of other early periods. The most characteristic ceramic innovation of the period is the anthropomorphic jar with plastic face, knobs for breasts, and winglike projections for arms; otherwise the pottery "is almost indistinguishable from that of the later phases of Troy II" (Vol. II, p. 6). Troy III, when it made outside contacts, seems to have turned westward as its predecessors had done. Dating of this settlement of probably a century's duration can</page><page sequence="3">56 THE CLASSICAL WEEKLY only be tentative, but must still be "well before the end of the third millennium" (Vol. II, p. 10). Troy IV also emerges as a very different picture from that portrayed by previous excavations. It is now clear that it covered the entire mound and was probably en- closed by a wall. In the five phases the houses revert to the crude brick on stone foundations of Troy II, but they are of a new type and include a most significant innovation, a domed oven. The great number of deer bones and horns emphasizes the importance of the chase in Trojan life of the time. A greater variety of shapes characterizes the pottery. Although walls assigned by Dorpfeld to Troy V must now be associated with the beginnings of the Sixth Settle- ment, Troy V remains an important settlement covering nearly as large an area as Troy VI. Again, there was no break with the past, but definite progress may be noted, especially in greater orderliness and spaciousness of house plans aind interior arrangements, in more skillful crafts- manship and precision in the miscellaneous objects, in the production of real bronze, and above all in the devel- opment in pottery where "in the local Trojan fabrics an unmistakable elegance manifests itself in a fairly wide range of wares and forms" (Vol. II, p. 223), which still proclaim themselves as direct descendants of the ceramic tradition that can be followed without a break from the First Settlement. Relations with the west, continued, but on a smaller scale, and connections with Anatolia and the east, and with Cyprus, show that Troy V must have been contemporary with the end of the Early Bronze Age in the Aegean and on the Greek mainland. It seems to have met its end as a result of the same movement that inaugurated the Middle Bronze Age in Greece and coin- cided with the beginning of the Hittite domination in cen- tral and southern Anatolia. "In the present unsettled state of chronological studies" the authors cling to the provi- sional dating which "would fix the end of the Trojan Early Bronze Age at about 1900 B.C." (Vol. II, p. 229). The admirable quality as well as the generous quantity of photographs, drawings, and tables complements the clarity and precision of the text to give an excavation re- port which commands for the authors at once the admira- tion, the envy, and the gratitude of their colleagues.1 Lucy T.
