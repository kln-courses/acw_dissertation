Arrhythmia in 'Continuous' Change Catherine Perlés Published online: 24 October 2012 © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2012 Abstract This contribution is centered on the question of tempi of change and the possibility of defining ternary scales of changes in a long archaeological sequence, which could match F. Braudel's interpretative framework. Although I had recently considered a ternary scale of change to be a satisfactory framework even for a single category of artifacts, further analyses for this volume, on a longer time scale, revealed it as an intellectual construct that entirely depends on the choice of criteria. In addition, observed arrhythmia in change between two sets of data from the Franchthi Cave (Greece), chipped stone assemblages and ornaments, demonstrate the difficulty of defining global phases of change within a continuous sequence. In turn, this raises the fundamental problem of the choice of proxies used to define the prehistoric cultural entities whose transformations we seek to understand. Keywords Tempi of change • Braudel • Arrhythmia • Cultural proxies Introduction The guest editors of this volume invited us, among other venues, to take up Fernand Braudel's ternary rimescale in order to characterize the nature of change in prehistoric societies (Roux and Courty, this volume). The whole history of mankind is but a history of change, and understanding its mechanisms is understanding how we came to be what we are. In this respect, Braudel's model is assuredly one that had raised important hopes among archaeologists (e.g., Bintliff 1991; Knapp 1992; Smith 1992). In this scheme, the long term relates to geohistory, to structural societal change and stable world views, the medium term characterizes circumstantial change affecting economy, demog- raphy or specific areas, and the short term refers to singular events (Braudel 1979).

By concentrating on the apparently simpler question of tempi of change in a given archaeological sequence, I shall question these two assumptions. Since the guest editors also invited us to make explicit our reasoning in the apprehension of change in past societies, I shall first briefly summarize how I shifted, while changing scales of observation, from a simple dichotomous view of change through time - as either continuous or discontinuous - to a more subtle model, formally similar F. Braudel's three-tiered timescale. I will then show why, while working for this symposium and confronting change in different behavioral domains within the same archaeological sequence, this latter scheme appeared to me as a mere intellectual construct, entirely depending on the criteria I chose to define scales of change. Any number of scales can indeed be defined within a 'continuous' sequence for each category of artifact or behavioral domain, and these are rarely congruent. Comparison between the tempi of change in lithics and ornaments at the Franchthi Cave (Greece), no matter how many scales of change I devised, show pronounced arrhythmia before and after a major discontinuity, the transition from the Mesolithic to the Neolithic. This leads me to question the possibility of defining global scales of change within a more or less continuous occupational sequence, and, more funda- mentally, to question the choice of proxies (and, in particular, artifacts) traditionally used to define prehistoric cultures, societies, or technocomplexes. In other words, this leads me to question, at least for relatively ancient periods, the way we define the very entities within which we search to interpret cultural continuity and discontinuity. Temporal or Genetic Continuity The concepts of continuity and discontinuity are used in our field according to different definitions. The evolutionist sense, adopted by the editors of this volume, relates to the genetic aspect of change: continuous change takes place through continuous learning and transmission between generations and peers, while discon- tinuous change denotes a break in transmission and population replacement or new socio-economic structures (Collard et al. 2006; Roux and Courty, this volume). This distinction is paralleled by Braudel's definition of historical times: the long-term societal changes correspond to 'discontinuous change', and the medium-term cir- cumstantial changes correspond to 'continuous change'. As I and others have done before, however, (e.g., Bailey 1981, 1983, 2007; Bintliff 1991; Chazan 1995; Knapp 1992; Stahl 1993), I will here primarily rely on a second, temporal, sense: continuous change takes place regularly through time, with inde- pendent transformations in the varied domains of human activity, while discontinuous change follows periods of stasis (or equilibrium) and affects several spheres of activity at the same time. Although the guest editors consider the temporal use of the continuity/discontinuity as descriptive rather than explanatory, in opposition to the evolutionist one (Roux and Courty, this volume, p. XX), I consider the issue equally important. Far from being purely descriptive, it relates directly to how human societies function and transform ß Springer</page><page sequence="3">Tempi of Change. Arrhythmia in 'Continuous' Change 283 themselves, thus also to mechanisms of change. Temporally continuous or discontinuous views of change, as they are expressed in the scientific literature in particular for periods of 'transition', rest on different - and usually implicit - paradigms of how human soci- eties function and evolve (Perlés 1998). A temporally continuous conception of change relies on a gradualist paradigm, whereby each sphere of human activities can evolve independently from the others, at its own rhythm, with gradual transformations due to successive innovations or borrowings. In contrast, a temporally discontinuous con- ception of time relies on a systemic paradigm, whereby feedback mechanisms limit the range of possible change until a disruption of the equilibrium - an economic or social crisis, for instance - entails simultaneous transformations in several spheres of social and economic activities (e.g., Bar-Yosef 1998; Bar-Yosef and Belfer-Cohen 1992). These two conceptions of cultural change closely parallel two conceptions of biological evolution, respectively Neo-Darwinism and the theory of Punctuated Equilibriums (Eldredge and Gould 1972 in Eldredge 1985; Gould and Eldredge 1977). It will be noted that, just as the two conceptions of cultural change rest on different assumptions about how societies function, the two biological theories also rest on different conceptions of how organisms develop and what defines a species. Defining change as temporally continuous or discontinuous, however, depends on the scale of observation (see Bailey 2007 for a discussion on 'time perspectivism'; Collard and Shennan 2000). Against the background of mankind's evolution, the transition from the Epipaleolithic to the Neolithic, i.e., the 'Neolithization process', appears as a marked discontinuity. In contrast, when it is studied for itself, at the scale of a few millennia, it then appears gradual. The same holds true for the transition from the Middle to the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe, and both transitions have indeed been taken as paradigmatic examples of both gradual and abrupt societal transformations (Guillomet-Malmassari 2009; Smith 1992). Gradual change is best perceived on a small timescale, whereas the systemic effects that define temporal discontinuities are best perceived from a very long timescale. Despite my inclination to view change as systemic (e.g., Perlés 1987b), basic studies of lithic assemblages rapidly forced me to accept that systemic effects were far from the norm, whether one considered a single or several categories of artefacts, a small or a large timescale. Independent, gradual changes proved to be far more frequent provided our sequences were not truncated by depositional hiatuses. It took me much longer to question the simple gradualism, or linearity, I had assumed to be the norm within 'continuous change'. Yet, my study of the Neolithic chipped stones assemblages from Franchthi Cave, in Greece, finally convinced me of the inadequacy of my own model of change: transformations in these assemblages were all but gradual and linear. A subtler model had to be introduced, formally similar to Braudel's three-tiered scale of change. Introducing the Long, Medium and Short Term The Franchthi Cave and Paralia,1 excavated from 1967 to 1979 under the direction of T. W. Jacobsen of Indiana University, offers an exceptionally long and rich sequence spanning the Upper Palaeolithic, the Mesolithic, and the Neolithic (Jacobsen and 1 The Paralia refers to the open-air Neolithic settlement below the cave's opening. Springer</page><page sequence="4">284 Perlés Farrand 1 987). Whereas the definition of discrete phases in the lithic assemblages of the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic posed no problem, in large part because the various phases of occupation were separated by depositional hiatuses, it took me a long time to realize that a conceptual framework based on three encased Remboîtées") timescales was required to account for the different rhythms of change in the Neolithic assemblages. The long, medium and short scales of change then became the rather unusual basis for the structure of a book on lithic assemblages (Perlés 2004). Changes in the modalities of preparation for the detachment of pressure obsidian blades defined the longer timescale, with two "periods" of about two millennia each. Within each period, several "phases" were defined by typological criteria (Early, Middle, Late and Final Neolithic), while variations in the exploitation of raw materials - obsidian, honey flint, local resources - defined a number of "subphases" within each phase (Fig. 1). Each level of temporal division also corresponded to a different spatial scale: the longer the time range, the wider the spatial extension of the criteria that defined it, and vice versa. Rhythms of change thus differed according to the criteria examined: there was no intrinsic rhythm of change for the lithic assemblage as a whole. On the other hand, the three-tiered scheme derived from the analysis of the data elegantly echoed Braudel's framework, and potentially led the way to interpretations in term of societal and economic change. Questioning the Three-tiered Timescale Major problems arose, however, when I decided, for this volume, to extend the temporal scope of the study and to introduce other categories of artefacts in the narrative. Let us now compare changes in lithic assemblages and changes in ornament assemblages over the whole sequence, from the beginning of the Upper Palaeolithic to the end of the Neolithic. Other categories of data could have been used for that purpose, but ornaments and lithics will suffice to demonstrate the difficulty of defining congruent periods of stability and change within a single archaeological sequence, as well as the determining effects of the choice of criteria.

Arrhythmia in 'Continuous' Change 285 A General Phasing for the Lithic Assemblage: How Many Scales of Change? Obviously, the criteria I had used to define the longer-term changes in the Neolithic lithic assemblages, the way force was applied for the detachment of blades, could not be used for the ornaments. In order to use a common denominator to define changes on the long timescale in both categories of artefacts, I had to devise a new criterion, i.e., the presence/absence of generic typological categories (such as backed bladelets, backed points, microliths, transverse arrowheads, pointed arrowheads, perforated shells, geo- metric beads, etc.). This introduces de facto another scale of change in the study of lithic transformations (Fig. 2) and forces us to depart from the elegance of a three-tiered model. The way force is applied to detach flakes and blades becomes the iongest-scale', with three periods of very unequal duration since the Upper Palaeolithic and the Mesolithic are grouped together when the much briefer Neolithic is divided into two periods. On the 'long-term' timescale, now defined by the generic typology of the lithic assemblages, three main divisions are defined in the Palaeolithic, assigned to three macro-regional technocomplexes, the Aurignacian, the Gravettian, and the Epigravet- tian. The Mesolithic is again divided into three, in accordance with the presence/absence of microliths, but these divisions do not relate to already individualized technocom- plexes (Perlés 1990). Finally, the Neolithic is also divided into three time periods on the basis of arrowheads typology (why always three?), which correspond to the classical broad phasing of the Greek Neolithic (Perlés 2004). The middle-term scale, defined by detailed lithic typology, allows for the defini- tion of six phases in the Palaeolithic, one for the Aurignacian, two for the Gravettian, and three for the Epigravettian, of three phases in the Mesolithic, and six again in the Neolithic. Finally, ' subphases ' had been individualized on the basis of raw material Fig. 2 Continuity and change in the lithic assemblages of the Franchthi Cave from the beginning of the Upper Palaeolithic to the Final Neolithic.

By individualizing four scales of change, we do not only depart formally from a Braudelian model but also conceptually. The discontinuities on the two longest time- scales can no longer be all interpreted - even tentatively - as major societal transforma- tions or population replacement. Conversely, population replacement has been suggested at different scales of our scheme. On the 'longest-term timescale', the major discontinuity between the Mesolithic and the Neolithic can indeed be considered as the reflection of a colonisation by Near Eastern groups. It corresponds to the introduction of a complete 'Neolithic package' including all the domesticates, permanent architecture, polished stone tools, new bone tools, weaving and spinning equipment, seals, figurines, etc. (Perlés 2001, 2010b). On the other hand, the discontinuity between the Palaeolithic and the Mesolithic, also interpreted by some as denoting demie replacement (Runnels 1995, 2003, contra Perlés 1990), does not show on this scale, but on the 'long-term' timescale only. On this long-term scale, the discontinuity between the Aurignacian and the Gravettian is also traditionally assigned to demie replacement, but not the disconti- nuity between the Gravettian and the Epigravettian. Similarly, I have argued that the marked changes within the Mesolithic assemblages were the result of functional differ- ences within a single tradition and not of "cultural breaks" (Perlés 1990). Finally, the three phases of the Neolithic are nowadays considered as denoting socio-economic transformations within local groups, (Demoule et al. 1988; Demoule and Perlés 1993; Vitelli 1993, 1999), although the study of ornaments will lead us to question this assumption. Discontinuities on the two longest timescale identified on the basis of lithic assemb- lages, according to - classical - typological criteria, thus coincide sometimes, but not always, with what are considered to be changes in social structure, or demie replace- ments. Given that we are here dealing with a single category of artefacts and not with complete regional assemblages, this imperfect fit will come as no surprise. On the contrary, all discontinuities specific to the medium- or short-term scales are interpreted as changes within stable populations, in accordance with the Braudelian model. Depend- ing on the specific instance considered, they can be related to various causal factors such as environmental change (Stiner and Munro 201 1), changes in status of the site (Perlés 2010a), or functional shifts (Perlés 1990), etc. The introduction of the ornaments in the scenario, will, however, lead us to question several of these interpretations. The Ornaments: A Very Different Process of Change The author undertook a complete study of the Franchthi ornaments a few years ago, in collaboration with Marian Vanhaeren2 for the Palaeolithic and the Mesolithic, of Sandrine Bonnardin3 for the Neolithic, and Patrick Pion4 for specific categories of shell ornaments (see Douka et al. 201 1; Perlés and Vanhaeren 2009).

Arrhythmia in 'Continuous' Change 287 mostly comprises perforated (non-edible) sea shells in the Palaeolithic and the Mesolithic, and a wide variety of geometric beads and pendants in the Neolithic, made from stone, shell, clay, and bone. They are assumed to have been used to ornate bodies, garments, and possibly objects. The analysis of this very large assemblage - more than 14,000 specimens - is still in progress, but a very different picture is already emerging. The longest timescale, defined for lithics on the basis of how force was applied, is irrelevant for ornaments. We shall thus directly address the following scale, the 'long- term'. If we retain as a criterion for long-term change the generic types of ornaments, the Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic show remarkable stability over a period of ca. 30 millennia, despite important changes in the subsistence basis, mode of occupation of the site, and, as we have seen, lithic assemblages. The Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic constitute a single long-term period defined by the predominance of shell ornaments, the same choice of species - mostly Cy elope sp., Columbella rustica and Dentalium sp. (Fig. 3) - and by a very restricted range of types. Significantly, the assemblages do not include other classical ornaments for the period also locally available, such as perforated teeth, bone and stone pendants, either completely absent here or only very sporadically present. As stated above, this limited spectrum is unrelated to the economic basis and mode of occupation of the cave: it persists throughout hunting halts in the Early Upper Palaeolithic, longer-term occupations based on extensive collecting of snails in part of the Late Upper Palaeolithic, intensive collecting of plants in the Lower Mesolithic associated with a funerary use of the cave, intensive tuna fishing in the Upper Mesolithic, etc. Comparison with the rich Aurignacian ornaments assemblage at nearby Klissoura Cave highlights the idiosyncrasy of the Franchthi assemblages (Stiner 2010). Continuity between the Late Upper Palaeolithic and the Mesolithic is also observable in manufacturing techniques, with heat treatment to intentionally modify the color of about a third of the Cyclope neritea (Perlés and Vanhaeren 2010), and with unusual elongated perforations on these same Cyclope (Fig. 3). At a more detailed typological level, on the medium-term scale, the presence of Homalopoma sanguineum in the first three lithic phases defines a first ornamental phase, the introduction of Columbella rustica defines a second, Epigravettian one, and a few perforated pebbles individualize the Lower Mesolithic (Fig. 3). Subphases, corresponding to the shorter-term timescale, will be eventually defined by using quantitative variations, but they are not completely settled at this stage of the analysis. Comparison of the phasing given by the lithic assemblages and the ornaments for the Palaeolithic and the Mesolithic, whether in the long- or the medium-term (Fig. 4), reveals major discrepancies. The discontinuities observed in the lithics on the long-term scale are not reflected in the ornaments. On the medium-term scale, there are no perceptible differences in the ornaments between the Aurignacian (UP 1) and the Gravettian (UP 2 and 3), although the Aurignacian and the Gravettian are traditionally considered as two different technocomplexes, carried by different populations. There are also strong elements of continuity between the Late Upper Palaeolithic and the Mesolithic, when such a sharp break is witnessed in the lithic assemblages that a replacement of population has even been suggested (Runnels 1995, 2003; but see Perlés 1990). In the background of these well-defined and homogeneous Palaeolithic and Me- solithic ornamental assemblages, the Neolithic ones immediately appear as radically â Springer</page><page sequence="8">288 Perles Fig. 3 Palaeolithic and Mesolithic ornaments from the Franchthi Cave.

The discontinuity between the Mesolithic and the Neolithic is the only one that is marked in both categories of material and at all levels of analysis. In order to reflect this common opposition between the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic assemblages on the one hand and the Neolithic ones on the other hand, one has to add yet another scale of change and other criteria. For the lithics, these would reflect the differences in conception between mobile hunter-gatherers toolkits, based on domestic production and a structuring role of weapons, and sedentary toolkits, based on specialized production and the minor role of weapons in lithic technology. This very long-term scale of change is paralleled in the ornaments by the conceptual opposition between natural shapes in the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic, and the predominance of the geometric shapes in the Neolithic (Fig. 5). As stated above, this break corresponds to major societal changes, with the probable arrival of Neolithic colonists from the Near East (Perlés 2001, 2010).

Arrhythmia in "Continuous* Change 291 and pendants in the Initial Neolithic is real, or merely an artefact of sample size. Early and Middle Neolithic ornaments are characterized by the variety of raw materials, including steatite, serpentinite, chlorite, marble, coral, Spondylus gaedoporus , Gly- cymeris glycymeris , and baked clay, by the variety of shapes, dimensions, colours and techniques of manufacturing. No two beads and pendants are exactly alike (Fig. 6). At a more detailed typological level, on the medium-term scale, the Early Neolithic can be distinguished from the Middle Neolithic by the presence of Cerastoderma disc beads, no longer produced in the Middle Neolithic. Here again, quantitative varia- tions allow the definition of a shorter-term scale, with several subphases. Late Neolithic ornaments come as a sharp and unexpected contrast (Fig. 7): pendants have virtually disappeared, and the ornaments consist predominantly of tiny black or white disc beads, very standardized in shape and dimensions (2-3 mm). The identification of the raw material - fired steatite, unfired steatite, baked clay, Fig. 7 Late Neolithic beads, made from: Spondylus gaederopus beads (first row), Cerastoderma glaucum (second row), Pinna nobilis (third row), fired steatite (fourth and fifth rows), steatite, serpentinite and micaschist (sixth and seventh rows), marble (eighth row), clay (ninth row) and unidentified raw material (bottom row).

Finally, the Final Neolithic witnesses another conceptual break: geometric beads virtually disappear and there is now a clear focus on natural shapes: pendants on perforated pebbles, naturally worn Cer - ithium fragments, and perforated Cyclope and Columbella (Fig. 8). As for earlier periods, both the long- and the medium-term scales in the Neolithic ornament phasing demonstrate clear discrepancies compared to the lithic phasing. In one case at least, the problem is reversed vis-à-vis the Palaeolithic and the Mesolithic: where continuity is observed in the lithics on the long-term scale between the Late and Final Neolithic, the ornaments show a marked conceptual break. Discussion The discrepancies in the continuities/discontinuities observable between our two categories of data, which would have been multiplied if I had added other categories such as subsistence practices, bone tools, or pottery, lead me to question a number of assumptions underlying this study, and studies of change in general.

Arrhythmia in 'Continuous' Change 293 First, the analysis I have presented shows that the tempi (rhythms) of change that we can identify in the archaeological record depend on the choice of the criteria we use to define them. Successive attempts at defining the rhythms of change of lithics and ornaments at Franchthi, based on slightly different criteria, led me to modify the long-, medium- and short-term scales for each category of data. As stated above, a ternary timescale had "imposed itself' on me when studying the Neolithic lithic assemblages, but a longer time perspective, including the Palaeolithic and the Meso- lithic, already necessitated the addition of a new timescale, and yet another one was suggested by comparisons with the ornaments. As I have experimented when pre- paring this paper, I can actually define any number of encased scales of change within a given category of remains, depending on the number and nature of the criteria I decide to include. By choosing the right criteria, it is probably possible to devise a ternary timescale of change in any category of archaeological material, but the latter would no more be a reflection of the 'reality' than a binary or quaternary scale, for instance. The conception, choice of raw material, and methods and techniques of production, are all susceptible to be transformed at different tempi, even if limited systemic effects may constrain the rhythms of change. Transformations may be 'gradual', but they are all but linear. Second, as other contributors to this volume emphasize (see, for instance, Kuhn, this volume), even if we can define various rhythms of change according to the criteria we use, it remains difficult, and sometimes impossible, to define rhythms of change valid for several categories of data. In most cases of continuous sequences of occupation, discrete tempi of change will render the definition of global rhythms of change fruitless, whichever the scale of analysis. This may seem contradicted by the ease with which diachronic phases are commonly defined in the archaeological record and by the frequency of sharp discontinuities recorded in Palaeolithic (or Neolithic) sequences. In some cases, the latter do correspond to the phylogenetic definition of discontinuities, i.e., replacement of population, or to rapid systemic transformations. However, synchronous change in several or all categories of data, especially when it embraces environmental as well as anthropogenic data, certainly reflects depositional hiatuses more often than it reflects sudden replacements of populations (Farrand 1993). For "early" periods at least, continuous records are rare, thus obscuring the actual arrhythmia of change between different categories of artefacts or behavioural domains. The arrhythmia of change raises in turn the problem of the criteria we use for defining archaeological "cultures" or technocomplexes, and therefore societal conti- nuities and discontinuities (see Fig. 9 for a synoptic view of the construct). Even acknowledging that archaeological cultures bear little relationship with anthropolog- ical cultures but simply define stable associations of shared, learnt behaviors, the problem remains. For instance, in the Palaeolithic and the Mesolithic, lithic assemb- lages have always constituted the main basis of the definition of the "cultural" entities (Bon 2009; Guillomet-Malmassari 2009), whose succession is deemed to reflect the long-term rhythm of the Braudelian model (see Roux and Courty, this volume). However, on the long-term time scale at Franchthi, where, according to traditional interpretative frameworks, the specialist of lithics could see a succession of presumed Ô Springer</page><page sequence="14">294 Pcrlčs cultural discontinuities, the specialist of ornaments sees clear cultural continuity.5 Depending on the proxies one chooses to use, the long-term history of the Franchthi Cave Upper Palaeolithic/Mesolithic occupation sequence would reflect several pop- ulation replacements,6 each presumably corresponding to specific social structures, or, on the contrary, a surprising continuity in traditions, symbols, and, therefore, population. The results presented here rest on the analysis of a single site, but the long ornamental sequence of Riparo Mochi (Italy), for instance, show a similar stable conception, cross-cutting Aurignacian, Gravettian, and Epigravettian layers (Stiner 1999). The problem, in addition, is not specific to the confrontation between lithic and ornamental assemblages: similar discrepancies between the definition of Gravet- tian phases or facies based on lithic assemblages and on bone tool assemblages have been recently brought to light by Laurent Klaric and Nejma Goûtas (oral presentation, March 2010). A reverse situation obtains for the Neolithic at Franchthi, where the Late Neolithic shows an unexpected break in the conception of ornaments. This conceptual break leads to question the cultural continuity between the Middle and Late Neolithic recently argued for (Demoule et al. 1988; Vitelli 1993, 1999), and invites the re- evaluation of the concomitant transformations in lithic technology and pottery. Could the old - and old-fashioned - theories concerning the arrival of new populations in Greece at the beginning of the Late Neolithic (Milojčič 1949) have some grounds after all? Similarly, it invites the questioning of the continuity between the Late and Final Neolithic, whose important differences have been attributed to economic shifts rather than cultural change or demie replacement (e.g., Johnson 1996; Renfrew 1972; Runnels and van Andel 1987). Here again, Franchthi is not the only instance where ornaments suggest disconti- nuities when other proxies do not. In our case, the discontinuity was diachronic. In others, in can be spatial. Newell and his collaborators found, through the analysis of ornaments in the European Mesolithic, regional groups that did not coincide with the groups defined on the basis of the lithic assemblages (Newell et al. 1990). Where bone and stone tool assemblages showed overall homogeneity in Europe, Vanhaeren and d'Errico brought to light a clear regional patterning of Aurignacian ornaments, which they actually interpreted as an expression of distinct ethno-linguistic groups (Vanhaeren and d'Errico 2006). Conclusion Which, then, are the criteria that we can use in order to define contexts in which continuous transmission takes place or, on the contrary, define the long-term, societal, change? The editors have stated that: "Studying social discontinuity first of all implies characterizing the cultural practices over the long term and in order to do 5 It is by pure chance that the two specialists happen to be the same person, but this at least should limit the risk of individual variations in the perception of timcscales and importance of changes. 6 I did not in fact interpret all discontinuities in terms of demie replacement in my initial work the Franchthi lithics, but also explored the potential factors in several instances of what I considered as continuous change (e.g., Perles 1990, 1992). But a case by case discussion would be beyond the scope of the present contribution. Springer</page><page sequence="15">Tempi of Change.

What do we do when ornaments contradict the macro-regional groups and their geographic or temporal boundaries defined in large part (but not only) by the lithic productions? Considering the social and symbolic load of ornaments, as opposed to the functional requirements lithic tools and weapons have to answer, I would be tempted to consider ornaments as a better criterion for defining "cultural continuity" than lithics. Braudel himself includes stable world views ("mentalités") in the definition of long-term structures (Bintliff 1991; Braudel 1979), and ornaments are an expression of these world views. However, weapons in particular are also invested with important symbolic affects and social roles (Bon 2009; Pétrequin and Pétrequin 1990) and are certainly part of a group's "word view". So is, undoubtedly, the rich portable and parietal art of the Madgalenian in southwestern France, that, again, allows for the individualization of regional groups clearly different from the vast entities defined by the chipped stone tools or bone tools (e.g., Bourdier 2010; Mazière and Buret 2010). As I stated in the beginning of this paper, I have for a long time shared the interest of the guest editors for understanding how human societies transform themselves through time, and the various mechanisms underlying these transformations. However, in order to define how "societies transform themselves", we first have to define these "societies". The outcome of my analysis is that we are, nowadays, better equipped to describe the processes of change and to understand the mechanisms of cultural change that we are equipped to define the social entities within which such changes operate. Despite isolated attempts at overcoming a framework inherited from the early twentieth century^ we are still working on abstract taxonomie classifications that probably bear little actual rela- tionship to the "structural features" that define human societies. One may thus doubt of the relevance of such entities as 'the' Magdalenian to investigate continuity and disconti- nuities within what should be a 'homogeneous macro-regional collection of social groups sharing similar structural features', according to the above-mentioned definition. Devising models that would enable us recognise, at different scales, actual human groups and interaction networks, should be a priority on our agenda. The whole palaeosociology of Europe's Palaeolithic and Neolithic could probably be completely redefined by using new sets of proxies, and not primarily stone tools or pottery, respectively. Admittedly, the better chronological resolution for the Neolithic, and the fact that pottery has been shown to bear complex but definite relationships with either linguistic, ethnic or geographical groups (e.g., Gelbert 2003; Gosselain 1998), would probably entail less drastic revisions. It is indeed clear that not all categories of remains bear the same weight for the definition of social groups and yield the same information in terms of societal change, and I suspect I have chosen here two extreme examples. In the Palaeolithic and the Mesolithic, the lithic technology is heavily determined by the production of weapons, which may change and spread rapidly over vast regions for simple reasons of efficiency, without any necessary impact on social structures. In contrast, traditional ornaments conceptions may well be maintained over very long periods of time despite transformations in social structures. To go beyond personal intuition and embrace a larger set of potential proxies, however, would necessitate specifically designed anthropological fieldwork and analyses of Ô Springer</page><page sequence="17">Tempi of Change. Arrhythmia in 'Continuous' Change 297 large databases (see Collard et al. 2006) to evaluate their relevance for the study of social change. In the meantime, the temporal definition of continuity versus discontinuity, which allows discussions on genetic continuity but does not require a predefínition of the social groups within which change is taking place, nor a predefined conception of the number of scales of change, remains, in my view, more adapted to the Palaeolithic, the Mesolithic, and, in large part, also the Neolithic. If transformations in human societies are a mix of independent innovations in specific domains, "rapid" changes corresponding to the adaptation of cultural systems to new equilibriums, and also stochastic or catastrophic events (Bintliff 1997; van der Leeuw and McGlade 1997), our primary task should be to distinguish these various phenomena in the palimpsest of change represented by our "data", rather than impose on them arbitrary rhythms of change and innovation. If several tempi of change can be identified in single technical production such as stone tools and weapons, others again if one introduces symbolic productions such as ornaments, how many different rhythms of change should we expect when whole societies are considered? In particular, why would societal trans- formations necessary follow a ternary temporality, just as we have - according to Occidental thought - a past, present, and future, and just as we tend - still in Occi- dental thought - to divide time into Early, Middle, and Late?
