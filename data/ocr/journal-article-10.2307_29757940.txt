<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NEW TRENDS OF MODERN SCIENCE {Continued from our last). Matters are now beginning to make us suspi? cious, for on all the other occasions when the calculation has pointed to the possibility of something existing, it has always been found that it does indeed exist. Let us leave aside the case of Le Verrier, whose calculations had led him to note not so much the possibility as the certainty that a planet must exist in a cer? tain position to explain the deviation of Uranus, a forecast that was subsequently confirmed by the discovery of Neptune. But when Maxwell perceived that the electro-magnetic disturban? ces should be propagated in conformity with an equation equal to that for sound waves, the conclusion was reached that electro-magnetic waves might exist, and afterwards they were found by Hertz to exist in reality. The same thing has happened with Dirac's equations which led him to foresee the possibility of the existence of positive electrons, afterwards ascertained to be a fact; and the same thing has happened in a hundred other cases. There? fore, the fact that the calculation brings us up against the possibility of certain new solu? tions, those of the cc advanced potentials ? now found in all fields of enquiry, and not only in that of light, leads us spontaneously to ask whether by chance the corresponding phenomena, strange as they may seem, may not really exist in nature. And this is what I have been trying to clear up. (J) I have set myself the task of finding out whether these phenomena, represented by the cc advanced potentials ?, and therefore formed by &lt;c con? verging waves ?, which I have therefore called Syntropie phenomena, really exist. But in order to recognise them in the world that sur rounds us, we had first to determine what are the characteristic properties these Syntropie phenomena should have, properties which had therefore to be deduced from the fact that they would be represented by the solutions of the advanced potentials. Now these advanced potentials were already known as mathematical solutions of certain equations, but what was completely lacking was their interpretation in reality, which seemed at first sight to be quite inaccessible. But on reflecting that a change in the time direction transformed the well known solutions of the cc retarded ? potentials into those of the c( advanced ? potentials, and vice-versa, it has been fairly easy to reach a very simple rule by which to obtain the more interesting properties of these hypothetical Syntropie phenomena. All that had to be done, indeed, was to study the properties of the phe? nomena so far observed and explained, re? presented by ccretardedj) potentials, and there? fore formed by ? diverging y&gt; waves, (the so called &lt;( entropic ? phenomena), and then to suppose that time was running backwards, to obtain immediately from each of them the image of a possible Syntropie phenomenon, the so-called dual phenomenon of the entropic phenomenon observed (this method of enquiry is known as the principle of duality, based on the reversal of the time direction). By apply? ing this method it has been easily seen that unlike the ordinary entropic phenomena, which have their motor centre, i.e. their cause (the source of the divergent waves) in the past, these hypothetical Syntropie phenomena should instead have their motor centre in the future. We should thus have, so to say, a motor centre that attracts the phenomenon (sucks the waves converging towards it) and which would there? fore present itself to the observer as a future t1) See my work: ? Principi di una teoria unitaria del mondo fisico e biologico ?, Soc. ed. Humanitas Nova? Rome, 1944. 94</page><page sequence="2">aim. In other words, the Syntropie phenomena, instead of being governed by a principle of mechanical causality (as are the entropic phe? nomena) would seem to be governed by a prin? ciple of finality, that is to say they evolve towards a purpose, and in this, we seem to fijid their essential characteristic. Moreover, in the case of entropic pheno? mena, formed by divergent waves that are constantly getting more and more mixed, the so-called principle of entropy, or of general levelling down, holds good. Then, in the case of Syntropie phenomena, the reversal of time should lead to quite contrary results; that is to say that these would be phenomena which, with the passage of time, would go towards ever more marked differences, which means that in their case a principle of ever greater differentiation would hold good, being in a certain sense the opposite of that of entropy. Moreover, it would be impossible to produce any of these Syntropie phenomena in the la? boratory; they would, that is to say, be inacces? sible to the Galilean or experimental method, which consists precisely in such reproduction. It is indeed possible to reproduce phenomena whose cause is in the past (entropic ones) by producing that cause and then observing the course of the phenomena themselves; but how can we reproduce phenomena that have their motor centre in the future on which we cannot lay our hands? But it is just when we think of phenomena that cannot be reproduced in the laboratory that our thought is irresistibly directed towards a vast category of phenomena of the greatest interest, the phenomena of life. On the other hand, it is precisely in living beings that we find also the other properties characteristic of Syntropie phenomena. It is indeed in the growth of a living being that we can note an ever more marked differentiation. We pass from the simple to the complex by a process of differentiation into ever more com? plex organs for attaining future endsy the eye for seeing, the ear for hearing, etc. We then note that the most inexplicable phenomena of life can be easily explained if we will only admit that they are precisely those Syntropie phenomena whose existence is suggested to us by mathematical calculation and of which it gives us the features that coincide at all points with the facts observed. This does not mean of course that all vital phenomena are Syn? tropie; many of them, those for which so far we have had mechanical or physical explana? tions, are certainly entropic. It only means that not the whole of life can be explained by ordinary (entropic) physios and chemistry^ as there is always a Syntropie part, the finalistic one, which is moreover the really interesting one. This runs counter to the traditional scientific mentality, but this is no fault of ours. Are we to renounce the possibility of understanding what life is? And here an enquiry is not out of place: does science consist only in a col? lection of methods and rules, or does it aim at something higher ? It is true that the Wiener (now the Chicago) circle wishes to make science consist of ? physicalism only ?, i.e. of a set of formulas and receipts for making sci? ence. This is all very well for classifying what has been done so far, and we should certainly not despise the work that has been needed for the definitive arrangement of existing material and of the present types of problems. But is it right to say that this is the furthest we can go? That science goes no further? These are things that are of too great interest; when faced with the mystery of life and with the possi? bility of throwing light on it, it is not possible to stop. Other material, and above all other methods, that go beyond those usually pres? cribed, will have to be elaborated, wherewith to try to penetrate into this immense new world hitherto unknown, of Syntropie phenomena. Meantime it should be noted that the expla? nation of a phenomenon does not consist me? rely in its description and classification, but in the discovery of the laws that govern it. And it is precisely for this purpose that, fol? lowing the method of Galileo, we reproduce the phenomenon in the laboratory in order to ascertain whether the law that we suggest is or is not true. And in the case of Syntropie phenomena, to which Galileo's experimental method is not directly applicable, another new method ap? pears spontaneously which is suited for dis? covering the laws that govern them, even if, as we have seen, they cannot be reproduced in the laboratory. If symmetry exists on the two sides of time, then what we can do, as we are unable to reproduce a Syntropie phenomenon, is to ob? serve its progress and seek to discover the real law which will always be represented by an undulatory equation, relativistically invari? ant, which will therefore allow of both the types of solutions above mentioned, the retard? ed and the advanced potentials. Then to verify this law of the Syntropie phenomenon 95</page><page sequence="3">observed, we need only check it, by reversed time, on the dual entropic phenomenon, which is, in a certain sense, the negative copy of the original phenomenon (the tifne being reversed) but which offers the advantage that it can be reproduced in the laboratory according to the usual Galilean method. The method now pro? posed for the study of Syntropie phenomena, known as &lt;c the method of dual experimenta? tion ?, consists therefore in the study, by the usual method of Galileo, of the dual (entropic) phenomenon; that is to say it consists in trying to reproduce and describe by an appropriate law (i.e. undulatory equation) this negative copy of the phenomenon, i.e. the phenomenon as it would be were time reversed; this is pos? sible as the law sought for (the symmetric equation) is the same for both the phenomena. We thus reach an explanation of life which, on the one hand implies no new special agent (? vital force )&gt;), for the Syntropie phenomena obey the same laws and equations as those governing mechanical, physical phenomena, i.e. entropic ones; while, on the other hand, it calls attention to differences that are much deeper than those of any vital force. In? deed, in the case of life it is no longer a matter of forces or other causes; the essential differ? ence is that there are no longer causes but ends. We thus reach one single synthesis of the whole sensible universe, which it seems interesting and only natural to call cc the unitary theory of the physical and biological world y&gt;. The importance of this new trend in the research of Syntropie phenomena, represented by advanced potentials, will be readily un? derstood. It may be said that there is one half of the Universe, so far unknown, that is open? ing before us. This half necessarily escaped the attention of the Galilean method, for all we reproduce and observe in the laboratory always consists of entropic phenomena, pro? duced by causes. It is therefore obvious that Syntropie phenomena can never be found in the laboratory. Therefore, for three centu? ries we have studied that part of the Universe which can be mathematically represented by retarded potentials; now we must study the other, represented by advanced potentials. And we may expect that to this latter half be? long precisely those mysteries of life in which we are most directly concerned. Let us, for instance, reflect for an instant on psychic facts. If we observe all our actions, it. is evident that they are always set going by a future aim. We are therefore in the very field of those Syntropie phenomena of which I have just been speaking. It is perhaps for this reason that a great psychologist, Piaget of Geneva, has taken an interest in the unexpected horizons that are opened up by the consideration of advanced potentials. Moreover, von Laue before him, and more recently Louis de Broglie, the ini? tiator of undulatory mechanics, had already shown an interest in such enquiries, which open a new world in the natural sciences, that of finality which is in a certain sense the op? posite of the far more familiar world of me? chanical causality. Thanks to these researches, finalism, the principle of finality, is fully entitled to enter the domain of science, for that portion of the Universe formed by Syntropie phenomena, and it enters it with the same right with which the principle of causality has always been accepted there, for they are both the logical and neces? sary consequences &lt;? standing on the same plane in virtue of symmetry ? of the structure of the fundamental undulatory equations that represent the true laws of the Universe. Ill And we have now reached the last point of our exposition, and perhaps the most in? teresting: the necessary modification of our conception of existence. Indeed, what we have so far said gives rise immediately to a natural objection, an important observation that has been made about the above theory on Syntropie phenomena. It is this: You say that there are phenomena (Syntropie ones) that are determin? ed by the future, moved by a future purpose. But how can it be that a future entity, some? thing therefore that does not yet exist, can affect the present, can act on now existing things? The objection would indeed seem a serious one, and this is perhaps the probably unconscious reason why the advanced poten? tials have not so far been taken into conside? ration. But let us examine the matter a little more closely, and then a natural answer pre? sents itself. You have not until now marvelled at the fact that past entities, that is to say past cc causes ?, should determine present facts, and yet these passed entities, that no longer exist make themselves felt, and to what an extent! on things now present and existing! Why therefore should you marvel that fu? ture entities should react on the present ones? 96</page><page sequence="4">These act, by the law of symmetry, on both sides of time, exactly as do the cc causes y&gt; that are past. I must say, however, that if such a reply may silence the objector, it does not of course silence me ; it has indeed given me much food for thought on many things. The fact that past causes, that have now disappeared, can affect existing things, is indeed no less difficult to understand, and one cannot see how it can throw light on the other fact, which is that future ends may affect present conduct. It is only the force of habit that makes the action of causes seem natural to us, but there are really questions, internal processes in our mode of thinking, such as those now referred to, which make themselves manifest in ways anything but evident on the occasion of radical upheavals that modify what is repre? sented and tacitly accepted. And in the present case, if we undertake to examine how such a question can be solved, we perceive that even if no account be taken of advanced poten? tials, or of Syntropie phenomena, or of fina lism, the mere theory of relativity makes an immediate demand for the revision of our notion of existence, which will eliminate the drawbacks above stated. How do we conceive existing things? A first point is at once evident. The notion of exist? ence, at least that entertained by those of us who deal with science, and more precisely with the science of nature, must have an objective significance, that is to say it must be indepen? dent of the observer; if this essential requisite of objectivity is waived, the facts themselves, the very things that exist, and are the objects of science, would lose their significance. On the other hand, let us consider the theory of relativity, and more precisely the theory of restricted relativity, now generally accepted. The troubles arise right here. According to the common notion of existence, we consider present things as existing. We say that past things no longer exist; we say that future things do not yet exist. We therefore connect this attribute of existence only to present things, that is to say contemporary things. Those things exist that, at this instant, are in some point of space. But viewed from the standpoint of relativity, the contemporaneousness of things depends for an observer on whether he is moving or not. Consider indeed another observer, who is mov? ing with a certain speed in relation to me. You will then readily see, on the basis of Lorentz's transformation by which I pass from my position to his, that the events, the things that are in front of us, going in the direction of our motion, and which are contemporaneous for me, and therefore existing, are for him shifted to a past time; therefore this observer will maintain that those things no longer exist for him, while, on the other hand, they do exist for me. So also the things behind us, and which are for me present, and therefore exist, are for him future, are placed in a future time (as can be seen at once from Lo rentz's formula) and therefore do not yet exist for him. The only things that exist for both are those situated in a plane perpendicular to the direction of the movement, and which pass through the point of coincidence of the two observers But then by combining several observers in motion, it is easy, according to their several directions, to convince oneself that agreement on existence would be had in one case only: I myself, here, in this instant; while all the rest ceases to have an objective existence. Evidently then, our notion of existence is logically speaking absurd, if relativity be taken into account. You may have it out with Ein? stein if you like, or with the facts that rela? tivity explains, but if these facts be true, and if they are correctly explained by the theory of relativity, as all the most eminent physicists believe, there can be no doubt about what we have said. How then can we reaequire an objective notion of existence? We can agree on a negative conception, denying those things, the existence of which is denied by another observer; and in that case nothing will exist except I myself, here, in this moment; or else one may agree on the affirmative and consider as existing those things that another observer tells me exist, even if he be in motion in res? pect to me. I would point out, moreover, that this is the traditional scientific praxis, which is that of agreeing on the affirmative. This indeed is the basis on which science works, accepting contributions from all. It is an eminently social work, built up by a common effort. So then the only path that remains open, if all objective reality is not to be denied, and with it the very object of the natural sciences themselves, is that of agreeing on the affir? mative. All things exist which any other reli? able observer tells me exist. But in this case, (l) See my article; Relativit? e concetto di esistenza ? in the book ? I problem! filosofici del mondo moderno ?t Ed. Studium Christi, Rome, 1948. 97</page><page sequence="5">duly availing myself of the motion of other observers who are contemporaneous, and therefore existing for me, we find that events that for me are already past or yet to come, may be contemporaneous for them and there? fore may exist. But as we have already agreed on the affir? mative, the only possible conclusion we can come to is that of admitting the existence of all, present, past and future. The conclusion is unexceptionable and inevitable if the notion of existence is to be objective, and if the theory of relativity be true. The only notion of exist? ence that can be logically deduced from these premises is therefore this: the past, the pre? sent and the future all exist together. Thus we see themes of enthralling interest and supreme importance germinating within the field of science. They are themes that affect our deepest feelings, such as those deal? ing with the problem of life aiid death itself. When, indeed, we are present at the death of a loved one it seems to us, in conformity with the common notions of existence, that we have seen a being pass over into nothing, into the non-existence of past things, and that he is no more; but if everything exists, including the past, we must then say that it is not so, that this is only an anthropomorphic impression, fearful above all to those who witness it! For he who dies does not fall into inexistence, for nothing is lost of that which was and of that which will be, because all entities, all the things of this world, remain localised in a zone of space and of time, which may become in? accessible to us (that is to say with which we, owing to our structure, can no longer com? municate by means of our senses) but not for this do they cease to exist. Those who are dis? mayed by these radical subversions of our present notions of the Universe may indeed give a hasty reply, saying that such questions are foreign to science because they are far removed from ordinary scientific \c methods ? without reflecting however, that new methods can and must be worked out to meet the needs of new fields and new horizons. And even should we wish to fix, as we have seen, the columns of Hercules of science by accepting methods that are to be held definitive, it should be noted that, as has happened so many other times in the history of human thought, it will not be the decrees issued by certain groups or schools that will stop the advance beyond cer? tain given frontiers, that will fix for them certain methods and limit their yearning for knowledge, their desire to know so many other things, to penetrate the essence of life and death itself, for these problems interest them too closely. And if it be true that these ques? tions cannot be solved by the traditional me? thods, then it is no less true that modern sci? ence is devising others more suitable; and questions of method will certain not make man cease from enquiring into things that are perhaps the most interesting that in the history of the world have ever come within the com? pass of his mind.
