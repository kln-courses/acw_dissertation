<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 15 On affirmation, rejection and accommodation  of the world in Greek and Indian religion Matylda Obryk Since its coinage by Jaspers, scholars have been looking for an explanation  for the changes that Indian and Greek cultures (and many others) seem to have  gone through in the so-called Axial Age.1 This is the time in which the so-called  Greek Enlightenment and the Upaniṣadic turn in Indian philosophy took place  (roughly a period of several centuries from the eighth to the second century bce).  I will apply to this development a typology coined by Roy Wallis, a sociologist  working on new religious movements in the 1980s. Wallis analyses par excel- lence new religious movements from a static perspective. However, his typology  might be understood even more broadly and provide a frame within which even  the dynamics of the development of cultures may find a plausible explanation.  We will also see that light on the similarities between Axial Age developments  may be shed by an Indian concept of human development2 concerning the atti- tudes of humans towards their environment in a widest possible sense. We  should also note from the beginning that in the most ancient cultures there is  no way to draw a sharp distinction between the secular and religious spheres of  life, and therefore issues of both religious and philosophical character will be  discussed in parallel here.3 Wallis divides religious movements into three categories according to their  attitudes towards the values and settings of the surrounding world. Wallis’s first  category is the world-affirming type wherein the world is being embraced and  accepted as it appears in order to achieve goals that are immanently connected   1 Jaspers 1949: passim.   2 That the Indian philosophy includes three paths to salvation (karma-marga, jñana-marga  and bhakti-marga) is widely known (Sikora 2002: 15). Within the Vaishnava Bengali tra- dition there is to be spotted a notion of the progress from one to the other (see below).  3 Cf. McPherran 1996: 20.

They reject  the values and mind-sets that derive from the world, and very often strongly  renounce and negate all that comes from the world of senses.5 And finally the  third type is the world-accommodating type wherein the world is understood and  moulded in such a way that it has to be neither rejected nor fully embraced but  just seen from a new perspective or engaged in a new attitude.6 Wallis’ concern is with the attitudes towards the values of the society  wherein a particular movement develops. However, a case could be made for  widening the perspective so as to examine the attitudes towards the world and  its components. The question of the main relation (either affirming, rejecting or  accommodating) of each philosophy or religious movement to the world will be  therefore central. The Indian paradigm As already mentioned, those three attitudes towards the world correspond to a  paradigm found in the Indian scriptures. The Vedas contain a vast amount of  different instructions. The first portion of them (the Ṛg-, Sāma-, Atharva- and  Yajur-veda which make up about 90 per cent of the Veda) pertain to the path  of karma and are therefore technically speaking karma-kāṇḍa. The oldest text  (the Ṛgveda) is traditionally dated back to bce 1450–1350 and the whole Vedic  period spans a time frame of roughly 1,000 years.7 Karma-kāṇḍa is the science  of ritualistic acts and sacrifices, and aims at controlling the gods, who then  become bound by the very performance of the rituals to act as requested by the  worshippers. For instance in the Śatapatha Brāhmaṇa (the brāhmaṇas are the part of the  Veda that describes rituals) it is said: And when he offers in the morning before sunrise, then he produces that (sun-child)  and, having become a light, it rises shining. But, assuredly, it would not rise, were he  not to make that offering: this is why he performs that offering. (ŚB 2.3.1, 5) The aim of the ritual is therefore to make the world – through the medium of  diverse divinities – function according to one’s needs and desires. The performer  of the ritual is considered to have power over the world. The ritual is used as  a somewhat mechanical technology that ensures the world’s functioning: the   4 Wallis 1984: 20–35.  5 Wallis 1984: 9–20.  6 Wallis 1984: 35–9.  7 Witzel 2003: 68.

The polytheistic structure of the divine sphere is on this path immanently  embedded into the concept of rituals.8 The ultimate goal of performing these  sacrifices appears therefore to be a ‘happy life’ that is basically understood as  having better opportunities for enjoyment. On this path the heavenly planets,  which in their depictions vividly resemble Western ideas of paradise, are the  highest goal.9 Within this realm the environment and the world are used as a  tool for achieving one’s own ends and are therefore accepted as they appear. The  main characteristics of this path are therefore rituals aimed at satisfying different  divinities in order to achieve one’s personal goals. The divinities are prevalently  regarded as being immanent, embedded in this very sphere of the world where  the humans dwell, and resemble humans in almost all personal features. They  therefore enable human beings to establish a relationship with them similar to  that with the powerful personalities of this world (cf. the personal relationship of  Odysseus with Athena in Homer’s Odyssey). This path and its outlook resemble  Wallis’ world-affirming type. Another portion of the Veda deals with the liberation that is to be achieved  on the path of cultivating knowledge about the suffering that derives from the  very contact with the world.10 The Upaniṣads are the main source for this path,  called jñāna. The Upaniṣads are a part of the Vedas, but in them the philo- sophical attempt at understanding the world became prominent, and they are  commonly regarded as being anti-ritualistic. Traditionally they are dated to the  period of bce 800–200, which corresponds smoothly with the Jasperian Axial  Age and the rationalistic revolution in Greece.11 As simply being in this world  is considered to be the cause of suffering, adherents to this path claim it is nec- essary to free oneself from the bondage of this world. This liberation is to be  achieved through the cessation of all karma. Karma means action and therefore  work. The law of karma dictates that every action enforces a reaction: as long as  there is action, a reaction in the form of either enjoyment or suffering will follow.  As long as a reaction is to be experienced, the living entity is bound to remain in  the world and always pursue a new body after the previous one has worn out. As  the path of karma is par excellence action and therefore produces reactions (even   8 Siegel 1978: 420.  9 Cf. Keith 1925: 581. 10 For the Upaniṣads as the main literature for the person pursuing the jñana-path, cf. Aruni  Upaniṣad 7; Olivelle 1992: 228 n10; Olivelle 2014: 10. For the conflict of the values  between the ritualistic (Brahminic/karmic) and the renouncer path ( jñana-marga) of the  Hindu tradition see Olivelle 2003: passim, esp. 275–7. 11 Cf. Witzel 2003: 83–6. Olivelle points to the fact that any dating of the Upaniṣads is  as stable as a house of cards (2014: 12). But this roughly dated period of six centuries   corresponds with the opinion of most scholars.

On the  path of jñāna the goal is considered to be lasting12 and transcendental (liberation  from the world), and therefore it cannot be achieved by mundane means.13 On  this path the search for the divine reaches into transcendence and is achieved  through the means of rejection. The concept of divinity becomes increasingly  impersonal. The yoga path sees the iśvara, god, as being totally distinct from  nature and removed from everyday experience. The concept of brahman, as the  supreme force is called in jñāna, is pantheistic in its outline. Finally the Sāṃkhya  school and then the Buddhist school arrive at a somewhat atheistic conception  of the divine. They arrive at the notion that the supreme is Nothing.14 This is a  perfected rejection that corresponds clearly with Wallis’ second type. Finally, there is the path of reconciliation. Reconciliation comes from the  realisation of the fact that negation is ultimately bound to what is negated (to say  non-A, one first has to think of A) and therefore it cannot lead to the Absolute.  Furthermore, the realisation that the rejection demanded by jñāna is ultimately a  false renunciation15 leads to the path of upāsanā (which means meditation, as this  is the process of getting into contact with a new type of divine) as Ramanuja16  called it – or in later literature – bhakti (devotion). The bhakti reconciliation  entails an engagement with the world and its components – for instance the para- 12 The reactions enjoyed or suffered on the karma-path are regarded as temporal and com- pared to a bank account that can simply be used up.  13 Or even described by any mundane means. Therefore the definition by negation is preva- lent on this path. Similar notions occur in the KaU 1.2.10: ‘By non-permanent works the  Permanent is not obtained’, or MuU 1.2.7: ‘Frail indeed are those boats, the sacrifices’.  Therefore the injunction is to seek jñana: MuU 1.2, 12.13: ‘Let a Brahmana, after he has  examined all these worlds that are gained by works, acquire freedom from all desires. What  is not made cannot be gained by what is made . . .’ 14 Cf. Siegel 1978: 420. 15 Bhaktirasāmṛta Sindhu, by a seventeenth-century author of the Bengali Vishnuite tradition,  Rupa Goswami, makes the distinction between right and wrong renunciation: anāsaktasya  viṣayān yathārham upayuñjataḥ / nirbandhaḥ kṛṣṇa-sambandhe yuktaṁ vairāgyam ucyate  (‘Things should be accepted for the Lord’s service and not for one’s personal sense grati- fication. If one accepts something without attachment and accepts it because it is related to  Krishna [Supreme God], one’s renunciation is called yukta-vairāgya.’) . . . prāpañcikatayā  buddhyā hari-sambandhi-vastunaḥ / mumukṣubhiḥ parityāgo vairāgyam phalgu kathyate  (‘When persons eager to achieve liberation renounce things related to the Supreme God,  thinking them to be material, their renunciation is called incomplete’ (Bhaktivedanta Swami  2004, CC. Madhya 19.170–1, quoting Bhaktirasamrta Sindhu 1.2.255–6). 16 Ramanuja, a theologian of the Sri Vishnuite tradition of the eleventh/twelfth century,  makes in his commentary on the first verse of the Vedanta Sūtra the point that ultimately  the goal is to achieve happiness that in turn is to be found only when desires cease. This  cessation of desires is only possible when the senses are properly engaged in meditation  that is combined with work for the sake of the Supreme (Thibaut 1904: 18).

As bhakti encompasses a service towards the  Supreme that is ultimately a symptom of a developing genuine loving relationship  with the divine, it encourages a highly personal attitude towards the divinity.19  Interestingly, Wallis also recognised that the personal feature is a special charac- teristic of the accommodating type of religious movements. The personal aspect  of the third type will also become central in our discussion of its Greek equivalent. The Hindu Vaishnava tradition of Bengal (Caitanyaite) claims that all  cultures move along a progression: from karma, the world-affirming, through  jñāna, the world-rejection, to upāsanā, or bhakti, the world-accommodating  worldview.20 An illustration of this progression can be found on a micro-scale in  the Bhagavad Gītā, the central Hindu scripture. The Gītā is the key part of the  Mahābhārata, an Indian epic that narrates the story of the conflict between two  factions of one family: the Kurus and the Pandavas. The sons of two brothers –  Dhṛtaraṣtra and Pandu – fight over the kingdom on the battlefield of Kurukṣetra.  Just before the battle starts, Arjuna, one of the Pandavas and commander in chief  of the Pandava army, asks his chariot driver, who happens to be Krishna (the  Supreme God as becomes clear in due course) to drive him into the midst of the  armies so he can have a look at his opponents. Seeing on the other side his cous- ins, grandfather and teacher, Arjuna breaks down and lays aside his bow (BG  1.46). He presents arguments for his desired withdrawal from the battlefield, but  Krishna instructs him and explains in roughly 700 verses both the ultimate goal  of life and the real and proper relationship of a human being to both the world  and the Supreme. 17 About the transcendence and immanence of God on the path of bhakti (especially its late  Bengali version of the Caitanyaites): ‘God had to be transcendent because He was too great  to be limited, and he had to be immanent, distinct from the self and personal, because He  demanded love, passionate love’ (Siegel 1978: 422). 18 On the highest stages of spiritual understanding on this path this liberation is solely a  by-product of the love of God. And the attainment of that love is the real aim and goal of  every bhakta (follower on the path of bhakti). On this path the revival of a dormant rela- tionship with the Supreme Person is the goal and means by which all happiness is to be  achieved (Siegel 1978: 422). 19 Raj Singh 2006: 19. 20 Correctly understood, bhagavat-dharma, as presented in the Bengali tradition by its  prophet Caitanya and explicated by his followers Sanatana, Rupa and Jiva, is the all-inclu- sive religion, the religion of religion, in that it gives us a fruitful framework for grasping the  whole range of human spiritual endeavours, both in their successes and their failures (from  an email conversation with William Deadwyler aka Ravindra Svarupa Dasa, a scholar and  practitioner of the bhakti path, from 14 October 2014; cf. also Deadwyler 1987: passim).  SEAFORD PRINT.indd   239 16/06/2016   08:18 </page> <page sequence="6"> 240 Matylda Obryk Gītā illustrates here a specific development. Dhṛtaraṣtra, the chief enemy  of the Pandavas, is violating justice and the social order and therefore stands  for sinful action. Arjuna, responding to the situation and having just suffered  from a breakdown, tries to find the right response to the given circumstances.  However, he considers restoring righteousness to be an action of the same type  as violating it: he claims that it would be equal to performing duties with the  goal of enjoying the fruits of action (BG 1.31). He rejects therefore the path of  karma, the world-affirming process, and turns out of frustration and despair, to  the opposite, which is considered to be higher by the scriptures themselves (BG  2.5).21 He wants to renounce (reject) everything and head for the forest to live  by begging. However, ultimately Krishna assures him that the path of rejection  is not going to bring him full peace and satisfaction. The whole Bhagavad Gītā  consists of Krishna persuading Arjuna to take to the path of accommodating his  duties in the world in order to engage everything in the service of the Supreme,  Krishna himself.22 Therefore the tension between work as understood by Arjuna  as being karma, and knowledge as a reflection of the cessation of action ( jñāna),  makes up the whole of the Bhagavad Gītā.23 This is in fact the very same progression: Arjuna first considers (and rejects)  the path of karma – performing one’s duties in order to enjoy the kingdom – and  consequently feels attracted to the path of jñāna, the path of rejection, and tries  renounce all his life and duties. It takes Krishna 700 verses to explain to him the  value of reconciliation of both of them, bhakti, for an even higher purpose: ser- vice to the Supreme. And that promises him the ultimate fulfilment. This development can also be discerned in a historical perspective. The  Vedic period emphasised karma-mīmāṃsā or karma-kāṇḍa,24 followed by the  rise of uttara-mīmāṃsā (also called Vedānta) which makes up the Upaniṣadic  21 The question of the value of each path can be found as well in the Bhagavad Gītā itself. In  the beginning of chapter 5 Arjuna asks about the difference between jñāna and bhakti: ‘O  Krishna, first of all you ask me to renounce work (karma), and then again you recommend  work with devotion. Now will you kindly tell me definitely which of the two is more bene- ficial?’ And Krishna answers: ‘The renunciation of work ( jñāna) and work in devotion are  both good for liberation. But, of the two, work in devotional service is better than renunci- ation of work’ (BG 5.1–2). Further (5.3) it is stated that only one who is free from dualities  of accepting and renouncing is completely liberated. Only one who has transcended the  path of affirmation and rejection is truly free. 22 This is most clearly stated in the last instruction Krishna gives to Arjuna (BG 18.66):  sarva-dharmān parityaja, mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja / ahaṁ tvāṁ sarva-pāpebhyo,  mokṣayiṣyāmi mā śucaḥ (‘Abandon all varieties of dharma and just surrender unto Me. I  shall deliver you from all sinful reactions. Do not fear.’). 23 This tension is repeatedly voiced in the Gītā: the beginnings of chapter 3, 5 and 12. 24 The Vedas in the traditional understanding encompass the Ṛg, Sāma and Yajur Veda and  are called śruti; in Sanskrit: revealed scriptures (the root śru means to hear).

Greek thought and culture seem to move  along the path of ritualistic state religion with the immanent gods of the myths  (corresponding to the karma-path); in the next step the rituals and gods meet with  a scientific rejection ( jñāna); finally there is a specific reconciliation of both,  which can be traced for instance in the personal religion of Socrates or the the- urgy of the Neoplatonists, both of which have a strong personal attitude towards  the (nevertheless) transcendental divinity (upāsanā or bhakti).26 Polis religion The religion of the polis provides a frame for the social structure and simulta- neously, through rituals and sacrifices, claims to win control over the gods, who  are therefore bound to perform according to the requests of their worshippers.27 Sacrifices played a central role in the life of every Greek citizen. They pro- vided a timeframe, leisure and opportunity to accentuate one’s social position,  and – last but not least – the rare portion of sacrificial meat in the assembly of  the feasters. Attendance at and the performance of such sacrifices were the cen- tral practices of the religion. Not orthodoxy, therefore, but orthopraxy was the  criterion for being a good citizen and person.28 The family altar and hearth was  the centre of the micro-cosmos, as the city temples were the centres of civic life.  Sacrifices were performed because they were a part of the inherited family tra- dition, and violating this tradition was considered to be a major breach of one’s  25 Krishna in the Bhagavad Gītā (2.45) considers the three Vedas to be the core of the kar- ma-kāṇḍa path. However, Olivelle (2014: 3) claims that the Upaniṣads are the major ancient  influence on Hinduism. The progression from one path to the other is marked clearly in the  commentary of Bhaktivedanta Swami on BG 2.45: ‘When the activities for sense gratifica- tion, namely the karma-kāṇḍa chapter, are finished, then the chance for spiritual realisation  is offered in the form of the Upaniṣads, which are part of different Vedas.’  26 For a similar depiction of this kind of progression – at least chronological – note Bruit  Zaidmann and Schmitt Pantel 1992: 233–4. 27 Sourvinou-Inwood 2000: 24. 28 Bruit Zaidman and Schmitt Pantel (1992: 27) stress that not the acceptance of a specific  dogma or belief was what held the community together but rather the right performance of  ritual. The Vedic period with its rituals is also called the phase of orthopraxy (cf. Witzel  2003: 86).  SEAFORD PRINT.indd   241 16/06/2016   08:18 </page> <page sequence="8"> 242 Matylda Obryk duties. But besides their importance in perpetuating tradition, the rituals seem to  have had a tangible outcome that was widely believed in and apparently experi- enced: prosperity both on the micro and the macro scale. Isocrates speaks about the outcomes of the performed sacrifices with firm  confidence: καὶ πρῶτον μὲν τὰ περὶ τοὺς θεοὺς . . . οὐκ ἀνομάλως οὐδ ̓ ἀτάκτως οὔτ ̓ ἐθεράπευον  οὔτ ̓ ὠργίαζον· . . . καὶ γὰρ τοι καὶ τὰ παρὰ τῶν θεῶν οὐκ ἐμπλήκτως οὐδὲ ταραχωδῶς  αὐτοῖς ςυνέβαινεν, ἀλλ ̓ εὐκαίρως καὶ πρὸς τὴν ἐργαςίαν τῆς χώρας καὶ πρὸς τὴν  ςυγκομιδὴν τῶν καρπῶν. (Isocrates Areopagiticus 29–30) First of all as to their conduct towards the gods they were not erratic or irregular in  their worship of them or in the celebration of their rites; . . . And so also the gifts of  the gods were visited upon them, not fitfully or capriciously, but seasonably both  for the ploughing of the land and for the ingathering of its fruits. (trans. G. Norlin) The performance of sacrifices, then, was necessarily one of the most important  obligations of every citizen. And, if done properly, the results were supposed to  be immediately tangible: the gods provided their gift in the forms of rain and dry  weather according to the needs of their dependants. Not only the weather depended on the performance of sacrifices. So did the  well-being of whole states. We hear from Lysias that due to the strict following  of laws the ancestors managed to bring forth a prosperous city. The state’s good  fortune depends solely on the rituals (τὰ ἱερά): οἱ τοίνυν πρόγονοι τὰ ἐκ τῶν κύρβεων θύοντες μεγίςτην καὶ εὐδαιμονεςτάτην  τῶν Ἑλληνίδων τὴν πόλιν παρέδοςαν, ὥςτε ἄξιον ἡμῖν τὰς αὐτὰς ἐκείνοις θυςίας  ποιεῖςθαι, καὶ εἰ μηδὲν δι ̓ ἄλλο, τῆς τύχης ἕνεκα τῆς ἐξ ἐκείνων τῶν ἱερῶν  γεγενημένης. (Lysias 30.18) Now our ancestors, by sacrificing in accordance with the tablets, have handed down  to us a city superior in greatness and prosperity to any other in Greece; so that it  behoves us to perform the same sacrifices as they did, if for no other reason than that  of the success, which has resulted from those rites. (trans. W. R. M. Lamb) One must (as Lysias himself insists) sacrifice according to the tradition of  the homeland in order to assure its prosperity: ὅςτις ἀξιῶ πρῶτον μὲν κατὰ τὰ πάτρια θύειν, ἔπειτα ἂ μᾶλλον ςυμφέρει τῇ πόλει  (Lysias 30.19). First that our sacrifices be performed according to our ancestral rules, and second  that they be those which tend to promote the interests of the city. (trans. W. R. M.  Lamb)29 29 These results are also the ultimate proof for the very existence of gods. By sacrificing  according to the tradition one gets what one wanted. It follows that someone has to be there  to be able to grant these benedictions (cf. Parker 2011: 3). SEAFORD PRINT.indd   242 16/06/2016   08:18 </page> <page sequence="9"> On affirmation, rejection and accommodation 243 This process seems to be rather mechanistic: one has to perform a certain  action in order to achieve the desired result.30 There is no room for consideration  of the inner attitude. The action itself is the key to the result. Therefore, it clearly  resembles in this particular feature the path of karma of the Indian tradition.31 In  both cultures the rituals are employed to reach one’s own ends and goals, which  are understood as gaining prosperity for oneself and the city one was born in. The  environment and the rituals have their role and function solely in the context of  earthly existence and are directed towards divinities, who are considered to be  immanent and personal. All these characteristics hint at the similarity between  this form of Greek religion and the Indian phase of karma. Philosophical rejection Relatively early on in the development of Greek thought there seems to occur a  departure from the mythological view of the world and the at times all-too-human  gods and strictly ritualistic approach to divinity. This rejection is mainly connected  with the philosophical search for the one primordial element. This one primordial  element takes the place of the manifold Olympus of the polytheistic religion. The earliest extant explicit critique of the traditional view starts with  Xenophanes, who dismisses the anthropomorphic images of the gods and seeks  after a transcendent (or monistic) god. A god who is unlike anything humans can  experience on earth. Xenophanes dismisses in regard to gods everything that is  based on everyday experience and pleads for an uncompromising monism that  quite vividly resembles the Upaniṣadic tradition. In the following famous lines,  he criticises the traditional views on gods as being relative and dependent on the  given circumstances of the people creating them: ἀλλ ̓ οἱ βροτοὶ δοκέουςι γεννᾶςθαι θεοὺς, τὴν ςφετέρην δ ̓ ἐςθῆτα ἔχειν φωνήν τε δὲμας τε. (21 DK B14) But mortals suppose that gods are born, wear their own clothes and have a voice and body. ἀλλ ̓ εἰ χεῖρας ἔχον βόες &lt;ἵπποι τ ̓&gt; ἠὲ λέοντες ἤ γράψαι χείρεςςι καὶ ἔργα τελεῖν ἅπερ ἄνδρες, ἵπποι μέν θ ̓ ἵπποιςι βόες δέ τε βουςὶν ὁμοίας καί &lt;κε&gt; θεῶν ἰδέας ἔγραφον καὶ ςώματ ̓ ἐποίουν τοιαῦθ ̓ οἵόν περ καὐτοι δέμας εἴχον &lt;ἕκαςτοι&gt; (B15) 30 Apparently it worked as well the other way around: Suetonius tells that after the death of  Germanicus the temples of the gods were destroyed, for they (the gods) did not provide the  requested protection for the beloved Germanicus (Suetonius Life of Caligula 5). 31 This way of practising religion is encoded in the famous Latin phrase commenting on the  religious attitudes of Romans: do ut des (‘I give that you may give’: cf. Rüpke 2007: 149).

Αἰθίοπές τε &lt;θεούς ςφετέρους&gt; ςιμοὺς μέλανάς τε Θρῇκές τε γλαυκοὺς καὶ πυρρούς &lt;φασι πέλεςθαι&gt; (B16) Aithiopians say that their gods are snub-nosed and black, Thracians that they are blue-eyed and red-haired. (trans. J. H. Lesher) Having rejected the traditional gods, he presents a constructive theology of a  strict monism that resembles the Upaniṣadic view. Xenophanes claims that god  is transcendent, completely unlike men: εἷς θεός, ἐν δὲ θεοῖςι καὶ ἀνθρώποιςι  μέγιςτος / οὔτι δέμας θνητοῖςιν ὁμοίιος οὔδε νόημα, ‘One god is greatest among  gods and men, / not at all like mortals in body or in thought’ (B23); that he does  not have the necessity to move, as he moves the universe by his thought (B25–6);  and that he sees, thinks and hears in his wholeness (B24). This divinity appears to  be so different from the traditional gods that no relationship is possible between  him (it?) and the world as such.32 Besides Xenophanes there were other philosophers who tended towards  monism. Heraclitus for instance talks about the One God through opposites in a  way that marks vividly the monistic approach – a breach from earthly dualism:33 ὁ θεὸς ἡμέρη εὐφρόνη, χειμὼν θέρος, πόλεμος εἰρήνη, κόρος λιμός· ἀλλοιοῦται δὲ  ὅκωςπερ πῦρ ὁπόταν ςυμμιγῆ̣ θυώμαςιν ὀνομάζεται καθ ̓ ἡδονὴν ἑκάςτου [πῦρ].  (22 DK B67) God is day and night, winter and summer, war and peace, plenty and want. But he is  changed, just as when incense is mingled with incense, but named according to the  pleasure of each.

Feyerabend 1987: 16. 33 Interestingly, such a definition through opposites is also found in the Isopaniṣad Mantra  5: tad ejati tan naijati / tad dūre tad v antike / tad antar asya sarvasya / tad u sarvasyāsya  bāhyataḥ (‘The Supreme Lord walks and does not walk. He is far away, but He is very near  as well. He is within everything, and yet He is outside of everything.’) And 8: sa paryagāc  chukram akāyam avraṇam / asnāviram śuddham apāpa-viddham / kavir manīṣī paribhūḥ  svayambhūr / yāthātathyato‚ rthān vyadadhāc chāśvatibhyaḥ samābhyaḥ (‘Such a person  must factually know the greatest of all, the Personality of Godhead, who is unembodied,  omniscient, beyond reproach, without veins, pure and uncontaminated, the self-sufficient  philosopher who has been fulfilling everyone’s desire since time immemorial.’) (trans.  A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami).  34 Here god is so much unlike men that any meaningful talk about him is impossible. The  Platonic Parmenides (134e 2–4) makes the point very clear and marks the first step towards  SEAFORD PRINT.indd   244 16/06/2016   08:18 </page> <page sequence="11"> On affirmation, rejection and accommodation 245 Xenophanes and Heraclitus both claimed that there is one god. But this  divinity took on different shapes in the hands of the various philosophers.  Interestingly, out of similar considerations the Upaniṣads arrived at the (almost  pantheistic) notion that everything is spirit (brahman). The Ionian philosophers  and their followers deified the elements of nature: water, fire, air and so on. In  that way the philosophers did not reject the idea of divinity but acknowledged  that basically everything may be of divine nature. This notion was further devel- oped by Anaxagoras, who saw the ἀρχή in the Mind and – having deified it  – arrived at a strongly impersonal image of a deity.35 However, the gods were not rejected without taking into consideration the  rituals that go along with them. Heraclitus criticises for instance the practice of  prayer in front of images of the deity and compares it to having a conversation  with or trying to talk to houses without understanding the true nature of gods  (cf. B5). The idea of there being a true nature of the gods is a hint that they are  considered by him not as immanent, belonging to the earthly realm, but rather as  coming from a different dimension. Plato goes a step further and calls sacrifices bribery.36 However, this Platonic  view, and the resulting notion that the attitude of the worshipper is far more  important than the sacrifice itself, points towards an attempt at a personal rela- tionship with the divinity and therefore to the next step in the development: the  level of reconciliation (see below). This turn to a monistic but rather impersonal view of the now transcendent  divinity, coupled with the notion of its ineffability in comparison to the myth- ological gods suited to narrative, is a shared step in the development of Greek  and Indian thought. Interestingly, they happened roughly in the same time-span  (the earliest Upaniṣads are dated around 600–500 bce; the Greek explosion of  [so-called] rationalism starts around the same time). Among the sages of the East this particular development is connected with  a kind of frustration deriving from the realisation that the happiness achieved  through the means of traditional religion is impermanent and shallow. The  immediate reason for the Greek development is difficult to discern, although we  the development of apophatic theology: ἀλλὰ ὁμοίως ἡμεῖς τ ̓ ἐκείνων οὐκ ἄρχομεν τῇ  παρ ̓ ἡμῖν ἀρχῇ οὐδὲ γιγνώςκομεν τοῦ θείου οὐδὲν τῇ ἡμετέρᾳ ἐπιςτήμῃ (‘we do not rule  the gods with our authority, nor do we know anything of the divine with our knowledge’  – trans. H. N. Fowler). 35 Cf. Price 1999: 129 and Muir 1985: 196. 36 Leg. 10.885b 7–9: ‘. . . or he believes that they (scil. the gods) are easily to be won over  when bribed by offerings and prayers’ (trans. R. G. Bury). Apparently Saint Paul had  exactly the same criticism of this kind of religious behaviour. Businesslike religion, he  claimed, has nothing to do with spirituality or developing a loving attitude towards the  divine (Romans 4: 4). SEAFORD PRINT.indd   245 16/06/2016   08:18 </page> <page sequence="12"> 246 Matylda Obryk can detect a similar frustration about the all-too-human relations with the gods  and a longing for an all-encompassing explanation of the world and a monistic  yet transcendent dimension. Reconciliation: towards a personal religion The third and last step in the development, which is represented in the Indian  tradition by bhakti, is characterised through an attempt at establishing personal  contact with the divinity by means of loving or devotional service towards god.  This service consists of engaging the world in the worship of the Supreme. On  this path it is not one’s own satisfaction and pleasure that are central, but the  pleasure of the divine. Within the Greek tradition it will be possible to detect  similar reflections. Besides calling traditional sacrifices bribery, Plato stressed that through the  means of ritual and incantation one can win power.37 Plato makes a strong case  that those who perform these kinds of rituals in order to achieve their own goals  are hypocritical criminals hiding their utmost impiety under the semblance of  religious behaviour (εἰρωνικοί; Leg. 10.908e1): they do not pay attention to the  divine but just want their desires fulfilled. In simply doing some business with  the gods they do not seek a deeper relationship with them (Leg. 10.908e–909c).  He also recognised that it was not the rituals per se that were reproachable but  the attitudes of the performers of the sacrifice. He stressed in a passage of the  Laws that men have to commune with the gods continually in order to achieve  real happiness in life: τῷ μὲν ἀγαθῷ θύειν καὶ προςομιλεῖν ἀεὶ τοῖς θεοῖς εὐχαῖς καὶ ἀναθήμαςιν καὶ  ςυμπάςῃ θεραπείᾳ θεῶν κάλλιςτον καὶ ἄριςτον καὶ ἀνυςιμώτατον πρὸς τὸν  εὐδαίμονα βίον καὶ δὴ καὶ διαφερόντως πρέπον. (Leg. 4.716d) To engage in sacrifice and commune with the gods continually, by prayers and offer- ings and devotions of every kind, is a thing most noble and good and helpful towards  the happy life, and superlatively fitting also for the good person. (trans. R. G. Bury) Against the tradition of polis religion Plato claims that in the course of the sacri- fice performance what is crucial is not the ritual itself but rather the attitude of the  sacrificer. He opts for rituals to be performed primarily for the sake of the gods  themselves. The satisfaction and happiness of the people who perform those  acts is seen as a by-product of the satisfaction of the gods. Being lovingly wor- shipped, the gods ensure through their goodwill and gratitude that their subjects  37 Republic 2.364b 6–8: ‘begging priests and soothsayers go to rich men’s doors and make  them believe that they by means of sacrifices and incantations have accumulated a treasure  of power from the gods’ (trans. P. Shorey). SEAFORD PRINT.indd   246 16/06/2016   08:18 </page> <page sequence="13"> On affirmation, rejection and accommodation 247 are provided with all that is needed (Leg. 11.931a). The ritual begins therefore  to cease to be a business-like enterprise. It rather appears to be a symptom of a  budding relationship with the divine. A similar notion is found in Porphyry, who is in the first place concerned  with the ways to please the gods and claims that they are not as much satisfied  with abundant meat offerings (for the people probably have in mind mostly the  feast afterwards) as with offerings of the first fruits done in a devotional attitude  (Porphyry De Abstinentia 2.16).38 And even more so it is not the sacrifice itself  that is the key process of worship but the contemplation of god, as Porphyry  claims along with Pythagoreans.39 Meditation as central to religious practice is  found also in Apuleius. Lucius, after having been transformed back into human  form, promises Isis, his saviour, that he will enclose her image in his heart – the  very meaning of a meditative relationship: ergo quod solum potest religiosus quidem, sed pauper alioquin, efficere curabo:  divinos tuos vultus numenque sanctissimum intra pectoris mei secreta conditum  perpetuo custodiens imaginabor. (Apuleius Metamorphoses 11.25) Howbeit as a good religious person, and according to my poor estate, I will do what I  may: I will always keep Thy divine appearance in remembrance, and close the imag- ination of Thy most holy godhead within my heart. (trans. W. Adlington). However, this kind of personal religious commitment is rarely institutional- ised or widespread in Greece.40 As we have already mentioned, orthopraxy was  considered to be the crucial element of the polis religion. In the early days it was  in particular Orphics (and Pythagoreans) who demanded personal involvement,  and offered in exchange a religious identity.41 Renunciation (especially of meat),  coupled with a personal commitment to the deity, provided a revolutionary  aspect in religious life: externally and internally encompassing commitment. The philosophical longing for a monistic and transcendent divinity – which  we recognised as characteristic on the jñāna-path of Indian thought – is also  38 Price (1999: 140) notes that Porphyry is an example of an extreme spiritualisation of   conventional piety. 39 Price 1999: 140. 40 In the Indian tradition there is also a notion of a pyramid when it comes to the distribution  of each of the paths in the society. For all three paths, despite being put in an order of devel- opment, coexist with each other. The first one, karma-path, is acknowledged as having the  most followers and the bhakti-path the least, as it is as well connected with a somewhat  higher demand on the individual development.   41 Price 1999: 141. Dodds called the Orphics and Pythagoreans ‘Puritans’ and world-  renunciants in the sense that they had strict rules of conduct and believed strongly in  purification as the main goal of life: ‘Purity, rather than justice, has become the cardinal  means of  salvation’ (1951: 154). SEAFORD PRINT.indd   247 16/06/2016   08:18 </page> <page sequence="14"> 248 Matylda Obryk present in this type, but with an interesting personal twist. This can be seen in  the person of Socrates, who made traditional offerings42 but at the same time  carefully listened to what he called to daimonion. Muir claims that Socrates  recognised in it a being who has supreme wisdom and intelligence and is respon- sible for the order of the world, and that this divinity has much in common with  Anaxagoras’ idea of the Mind as the controlling power of the universe.43 Socrates  admitted to having been in his youth a disciple of Anaxagoras, but rejected him  as he was dissatisfied with looking solely into Nature herself without inquir- ing about the duties and roles of human beings (Plato Phaedo 97d). Socrates  acknowledged therefore the achievements of the Ionian philosophers of Nature  but tended to go further – investigating not only the question of how we should  live but also the supreme power behind the realities described by the philoso- phers of nature (cf. Phaedo 98c–99d: Socrates’ second voyage). Therefore, it  seems that in Socrates (as in Arjuna in the Gītā) there can be detected a kind of  development from one level of religious experience to the next. This interesting merging of the philosophical and religious approaches finds  its most striking example in the Neoplatonic theurgy. Iamblichus states in de  mysteriis that not reason but ritual, some unspeakable act beyond comprehen- sion, is the means for attaining salvation, which is understood to be a union with  the divinity: . . . οὐδὲ γαρ ἡ ἔννοια ςυνάπτει τοῖς θεοῖς τοὺς θεουργούς· ἐπεὶ τί ἐκώλυε τοὺς  θεωρητικῶς φιλοςοφοῦντας ἔχειν τὴν θεουργικὴν ἕνωςιν πρὸς τοὺς θεοὺς; νῦν  δ ̓ οὐκ ἔχει τό γε ἀληθὲς οὕτως· ἀλλ ̓ ἡ τῶν ἔργων τῶν ἀρρήτων καὶ ὑπὲρ πᾶςαν  νόηςιν θεοπρεπῶς ἐνεργουμένων τελεςιουργία ἥ τε τῶν νοουμένων τοῖς θεοῖς  μόνον ςυμβόλων ἀφθέγκτων δύναμις ἐντίθηςι τὴν θεουργικὴν ἕνωςιν. (Iamblichus  De Mysteriis 96, 13 Parthey) It is not thought that links the theurgist with the gods: what would hinder those  who are theoretical philosophers from enjoying theurgic union with gods? But the  situation is not so: it is the accomplishment of acts not to be divulged and beyond  all conception, and the power of the unutterable symbols, understood solely by the  gods, which establishes theurgic union. (trans. E. C. Clarke / J. M. Dillon / J. P.  Hershbell) Apparently the ritual of the theurgist is of a different kind than that of traditional  religion. The theurgist, as the name suggests (θεός and ἔργον), does not talk  about the gods but rather acts upon them. Dodds points out that whereas the  deeds in the environment of the polis aimed at worldly and oftentimes profane  ends, here the same ritual is not abandoned but engaged in a different way. It per- 42 Cf. the famous ‘we owe a cock to Asklepios’ (Plato Phaedo 118a) and the statement of  Xenophon about his religious behaviour conforming with the ways of his fellow citizens  (Memorabilia 1.1–3). 43 Muir 1985: 208–9. SEAFORD PRINT.indd   248 16/06/2016   08:18 </page> <page sequence="15"> On affirmation, rejection and accommodation 249 tains to the solely religious ends of satisfying the divine or achieving a mystical  theurgic union with the gods – ἕνωςις.44 Theurgy also used highly sophisticated magical enchantments to animate  the statues of gods, which was considered the highest level of deity worship.  Theurgists developed these techniques to such a point that they claimed to be  able to ask the deities for oracles and in that way free themselves from fate45 and  ensure for themselves τῆς ψυχῆς ἀπαθανατιςμός (‘the immortalisation of the  soul‘: Proclus Commentary on Plato’s Republic 1.152, 10). So the performance  of the ritual and religious acts had a different aim than that of the common state  religion: the goal was not prosperity and fulfilment of immediate desires but  rather liberation in the experienced union with the beloved divinity.46 Theurgy  thus ‘may be described more simply as magic applied to a religious purpose and  resting on a supposed revelation of a religious character’, as Dodds puts it.47 This form of worship of the gods and engagement in a ritual with a strictly  religious purpose of pleasing the gods is comparable with what we have seen  described as bhakti in the Indian tradition. Theurgy, combining philosophical  reflection, the search for a transcendent divinity, and ritual directed at a personal  god who is to be pleased, is the closest the Greek tradition gets to the Indian  version of the third step of the development. Conclusion The notion of the Axial Age puts a spell on thinkers and scholars of various creeds  and denominations. Diverse reasons for the parallel developments in the greatest  cultures of the world between the eighth and the third centuries bce have been put  forward.48 The Indian paradigm of a progression from karma through jñāna to  upāsanā (or bhakti) seems to have its counterpart in Greek culture. 44 Dodds 1951: 291. 45 οὐ γὰρ ὑφ ̓ εἱμαρτὴν ἀγέλην πίπτουςι θεουργοί (Chaldean Oracles, p. 59 Kr.): ‘the theur- gists do not fall under the fate-fixed mass of people’. 46 Of course we hear as well famous stories about producing thunderstorms in order to  save the Roman army (cf. Suidas s.v. Ἰουλιανός) or even ending pestilence (cf. reference  in Dodds 1951: 301), which might remind us of the traditional (in our scheme) karma  approach to ritual. Using the ritual and worship for profane ends and not as a means to  please the divine has in fact nothing to do with the path of real theurgy (in our scheme  bhakti) as presented in Iamblichus. This development or abuse of theurgical acts might be  considered a deterioration of their pure purpose as they were developed in the first place for  the sake of establishing a meaningful relationship with the divine.  47 Dodds 1951: 291. 48 For instance the theory that universal philosophies came into being in universal and   multi-cultured empires (Christian 2004: 319) or the view that coinage had a decisive influ- ence on the development of new ways of thinking (Graeber 2011, drawing on Seaford 2004).  SEAFORD PRINT.indd   249 16/06/2016   08:18 </page> <page sequence="16"> 250 Matylda Obryk Greek culture moves along the path from a mythological understanding  of the world, through a rationalistic one, towards an attempt at an apparent  reconciliation between the two. The elements of each step are consistent with  the characteristics of the Indian counterpart. Immanent polytheistic gods and  the rituals designed to control them correspond with the first step (karma) of the  Indian development. The search for a primordial monistic force underlying the  universe and the ways of expressing it (apophatic theology) is analogous with  the Upaniṣadic attempts at achieving jñāna. Finally the third step of the Indian  paradigm, the bhakti stage, seems to have some elements that are analogous with  the Neoplatonistic theurgy (and to some extent with the personal development  of Socrates). The Indian paradigm offers yet another approach to the question of the  development of cultures. In its Vaishnava Bengali version it even claims a uni- versality as it points out that not only individuals (cf. Arjuna in the Bhagavad  Gītā) but whole cultures go through an affirming, rejecting and then finally  accommodating phase in their development. From that perspective the changes  that different cultures underwent at the point of the so-called Axial Age would  be just a natural development from the first to the next step. The third step would  then still await its Jaspers to name it. SEAFORD PRINT.indd   250 16/06/2016   08:18 </page> </plain_text>
