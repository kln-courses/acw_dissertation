<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EFFECTS OF AMBIENT TEMPERATURE AND POPULATION DENSITY ON AGGRESSION IN TWO INBRED STRAINS OF MICE, MUS MUSCULUS by GARY GREENBERG 1)2) (Kansas State University, Kansas, U.S.A.) (With 3 Figures) (Rec. I5-VII-I97I) This investigation was prompted by the results of a study of thermal stress and crowding in humans in which volunteers were subjected to high temperatures in groups of 48 (ROHLES, I967). The size of the experimental room permitted each individual only 0.56 m2 (6 ft2) of floor space. Under these conditions the subjects displayed ".. . continual arguing, needling, agitating, jibing, fist-fighting, threatening, and even an attempted knifing [p. 59]." This behavior was absent at lower temperatures and under less crowded conditions. Thus, in this study, temperature and population density apparently set the stage for aggression in humans. This suggests that environmental conditions can be effective in eliciting and maintaining aggression. A recent study showed that ambient temperature can influence some behavior in mice, although observations of aggression were not made (ANDERSON, WERBOFF &amp; LES, 1968). In fact, the literature is curiously lacking in this respect. One early report ,(SCOTT &amp; FREDERIC- SON, I95I) suggested that there was no difference in aggression in mice subjected to temperatures of Io.o°C (5o°F) and 2I.I°C (7o°F), and that there was reduced aggression at "high temperatures," although no figures were given. This would indicate that temperature tends to be unimportant in the regulation of aggression, a conclusion clearly at odds with the ob- servations of ROHLES (1967). Of course, a species difference may be responsible for the contradictory nature of these two reports. Another environmental stimulus for aggression appears to be crowding, or I) This paper is based on a dissertation submitted in partial fulfillment of the require- ments for the Ph. D. degree.

SOUTHWICK (I955) reported that house mice displayed more aggression in high than in low population densities. Monkeys also increase their aggressiveness when available space is decreased (SOUTH- WICK, I967). In this study fighting within a colony increased in frequency and intensity when a partition cutting the size of the colony cage in half was erected. Similar results have been noted for pigeons (WILLIS, I966) and rats (ULRICH, I966). It would appear, then, that temperature and population density are two important environmental determinants of aggression. Furthermore, as sug- gested by ANDERSON et al. (I968), the interaction of these variables should not be overlooked when studying their effects on behavior. ROHLES' (1967) observations led to the formulation of an hypothesis which stated that the temperature-population density interaction might serve to lower thresholds for aggressiveness. The present experiment was designed to examine the validity of that hypothesis by subjecting mice from aggressive and non-aggressive strains to temperatures of i8.3°C, 2I.I°C, 26.7°C, 32.2°C, or 35.o°C (65°F, 7o°F, 8o°F, 9o°F, 95°F) and crowding them, in groups of eight, into a o0.09, 0.2I, or 0.38 m2 (I, 2.25, or 4ft2) enclosure. The mice were observed for three io min. periods during a Ioo min. stay in the enclosures. During the observation periods the number of times each animal bit another was recorded. Biting, then, following AZRIN (1967), was the index of aggression. METHOD Subj ects. The Ss were 240 male mice, Mus musculus, obtained from the Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine. Htalf (I20) were from the aggressive C57BL/IoJ strain and half (I20) were from the non-aggressive A/J strain. These are highly inbred strains of mice and are known for their relative aggressiveness and timidity (GREEN, I968). All Ss were approximately 30 days old when received in the laboratory and 60 days old when the experi- ment was begun. Design. The experiment employed a 5 X 3 X 2 X 3 factorial with (a) five tem- peratures (I8.3°C, 2I.I°C, 26.7°C, 32.2°C, and 35.o°C), (b) three population densities (8 Ss in a o.09, 0.2i, and 0.38 m2 enclosure), (c) two strains of mice (C57BL/IoJ and A/J), and (d) three IO min. observation periods (30, 60, and go90 min. after the beginning of testing). I20</page><page sequence="3">AMBIENT TEMPERATURE, POPULATION DENSITY AND AGGRESSION 121 Apparatus. The apparatus included equipment for controlling the environment and for monitoring the aggressive behavior of the mice. Three o.9I m (3 ft) high white enclosures measuring 0.30 m X 0.30 m (I ft X I ft), 0.46 m X 0.46 m (I.5 ft X I.5 ft), and o.6I m X 0.6I m (2 ft X 2 ft) were used as test enclosures in which the behavior of the Ss was observed. These en- closures were used to vary the population density and were housed in a Sherer-Gillette Controlled Environment Room (Model # CER 8o1) which permitted the control of temperature, humidity, and light conditions. The monitoring equipment, which consisted of a Dage RGS-II (Model # IOI472- 03) Vidicon Television Camera equipped with a Soliger 25 mm fl.9 lens (Model # 17516), was mounted directly above the test enclosure. The camera was wired to an Ampex 7000 Video Tape Recorder and a Contac 2I" In- dustrial Monitor (Model # WVA 2i/C). The recorder and the monitor were located at the experimenter's station outside the environmental room. P r oc e dur e. When received in the laboratory Ss were placed in individual standard laboratory mouse cages with ad lib. food and water available at all times. The Ss were remained isolated in these cages for 30 days. At approximately 60 days of age Ss randomly assigned to one of 15 treatment conditions depending on their strain. The Ss within each group were then housed in the environ- mental room (still in their individual cages) for 22 hours to adapt to the experimental temperature. The relative humidity was 40% and the lights were always on in the environmental room. Ten hours later all food was removed from the cages so that all Ss were 12 hours food deprived at the time of testing. At the end of the adaptation period Ss were marked on their dorsal surfaces for identification purposes (a white opaque felt-tipped marking pen was used to mark the black C57BL/IoJ Ss and a black pen was used for the white A/J Ss) and placed in the test enclosures in groups of eight. Testing was then begun. Video recordings of Io min. duration were made of the groups after they had been in the enclosures for 30, 60, and go min. Thus, Ss were observed for a total of 30 min. during the Ioo min. they were together in the enclosures. These recordings were coded and stored for later scoring. All groups were tested at approximately the same time of day (between 9-I2 AM). The order of temperature and density combinations was selected from a table of random numbers. There were 15 such combinations for the two strains making a total of 30 treatment conditions. The video record-</page><page sequence="4">GARY GREENBERG ings were coded with a five-digit number (randomly selected) to partially control for experimenter bias during scoring. In this way E was unaware of the temperature conditions when scoring the data. Population density and strain could not be disguised and were apparent. In scoring aggression E watched each S individually for the three IO min. observation periods in each treatment condition and counted only actual bites made by an S to any part of the body of another animal. Ten 10 min. periods were chosen at random for rescoring to test for the objectivity of this measure. RESULTS The animals were observed separately and the number of times each bit another was counted. The mean number of bites per animal was thus used as the measure of aggression. Since the raw score attained by many animals was zero the data were subjected to a square root transformation. The Ag- gression Scores (mean number of bites/S) in the figures and table below and the means referred to below reflect the transformation of the data. The difference between the two mouse strains was, as expected, highly significant (F = 43.375, df = 1I/2IO, p &lt;.oi). The Neuman-Keuls Studen- tized Range statistic indicated that the C57BL/IoJ strain was more aggres- sive than the A/J strain at all temperature except 35°C (p &lt;.oi in all instances). This relationship is shown in Figure i along with the significant temperature effect displayed by the two strains (F = 2.957, df = 4/210, p &lt;.02) over all three observation periods. The functions in the figure show that aggression was low at i8.3°C and at 35°C, but increased as the tem- perature increased from I8.3°C to 32.2°C (to 26.7°C for the A/J strain). .2.0- A/ m -o- C57 - 0 1.5- z \ o \ - 1.0- &lt; 0.5- 0 65 70 80 90 95 (18.3) (21.1) (26.7) (32.2) (35.0) TEMPERATURE °F (°C) Fig. I.

There were, however, some significant interactions involving population density. The population density-temperature interaction was significant (F = 3.842, df = 8/2IO, p &lt;.oi) over all three observation periods. This interaction is shown in Figure 2 which presents a different set of functions for each of three observation periods. The data are presented this way because the three way population density-temperature-observation period interaction was also sig- nificant (F =- 1.71, df = I6/420, p &lt;.05).

These generalizations were clearest in the first io min. observation period, as the figure shows, and seemed to become in- creasingly weak from the first to the third observation period. In fact, in the third observation period all differences seem to be somewhat attenuated. Since aggression decreased from the first to the third observation period in both strains (F - 6.412, df = 2/420, p &lt;.oi) it would appear that the best indication of the effects of the manipulations made here can be given by considering behavior in the first period only, before the animals had a chance to organize a social hierarchy or adapt to the experimental environment. The only significant differences in amounts of aggression scored in the first observation period (Figure 2) were at 32.2°C in the 0.38 m2 and o.o9 m2 enclosures, the Aggression Scores (AS) being 0.552 and 2.948, respect- ively (p &lt;.oi) and in the 0.2I m2 (AS = 1.377) and 0.09 m2 enclosures (p&lt;.oi); and at 35°C in the 0.38 m2 and 0.2I m2 enclosures (AS== 1.622 and 0.410, respectively; p &lt;.05) and in the 0.38 m2 and 0.09 m2 (AS == 0.416) enclosures (p &lt;.05). The unusual or different shape of the function for the 0.38 m2 enclosure is interesting and will be discussed in further detail below. The interaction of population density with observation periods was also significant (F = 6.476, df = 4.420, p &lt;.01). This interaction is shown in Figure 3 which indicates that aggression decreased over the three ob- servation periods in two of the three enclosures. As in Figure 2, the function * - 1 SQ. FT.

This suggests that something about that particular sized enclosure disrupted the behavior under consideration here. The above mentioned, and expected, strain difference is further de- monstrated by the data in Table i which ranks Aggression Scores attained TABLE i Ranked Aggression Scores attained by the two strains at 2I.i°C, 26.7°C, and 32.2°C.

As the table indicates there was a tendency for the C57BL/ioJ strain to be most aggressive in the smallest enclosure and least aggressive in the largest enclosure, regardless of temperature. A Spearman Rank Corre- lation Coefficient computation showed this to be a reliable relationship (r, =- +.84, p &lt;.oI). On the other hand, the A/J strain seemed to be more aggressive at the higher temperatures than at the lower temperatures, regard- less of enclosure size. This was not, however, a significantly reliable relation- ship, although the correlation coefficient was suggestive (r- = +.47). To test the objectivity of the criterion of aggression (biting) io obser- vation periods were chosen at random for rescoring and a Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient was computed for the first and second scores of those IO periods. The resulting correlation coefficient was highly significant (r == +.967, p &lt;.oi). In addition, the difference between first and second scores for those periods was translated into a percentage figure which was less than 3%. Thus, the criterion was deemed reliable.</page><page sequence="8">GARY GREENBERG DISCUSSION Even the casual observer can discern important behavioral differences between the two mouse strains used here. The C57BL/ioJ strain is frisky, nervous, extremely active, and quick to vocalize; on the other hand, the A/J strain is somewhat lethargic and passive. Since aggression is brought about by stimulation, and since C57BL/IoJ mice are both hyper-active and hyper- reactive (GREEN, I968) it is suggested that the observed differences in aggressive behavior between the two strains can be attributed to these behavioral differences. An important finding of this study, then, was the confirmation of the relative aggressiveness and non-aggressiveness of the mouse strains that served as subjects. However, the paucity of interactions between the strains and other variables suggests that the aggression of the two strains varied in similar ways; that is, the aggression of both strains was brought under the control of the variables studied here. For example, aggression of both strains was related to the ambient temperature as Figure i illustrated. The absence of a strain- temperature interaction suggested that as temperature increased there was a corresponding increase in the aggression of both strains. At the extreme temperatures aggression was low, a finding that can be explained by the fact that cold induces heat-conserving activities and heat induces heat-reducing activities. At I8.3°C huddling was observed in both strains, and at 35°C many animals were often seen licking their paws, rubbing their ears and fur (apparently spreading saliva for the coolness provided via the evaporation of the saliva), and otherwise remaining inactive stretched out along the walls of the enclosure. Since animals can reduce heat production by lowering their metabolic rates through reductions in their activity the behavior of the mice at the highest temperature was highly adaptive. All of these behaviors are appropriate for heat conservation and reduction (GELINEO, I964; SCHMIDT-NIELSEN, I964), but more important, they are incompatible with fighting. Despite the great difference in the level of aggression displayed by the two strains the presence of a temperature effect in both strains casts doubt on ROHLES' (1967) suggestion that the hypothesized temperature-population density effect is peculiar to aggressive-prone animals and lends considerable support to the present hypothesis of a general effect. A similar conclusion (of a general temperature effect) was hinted at by ULRICH (I966) who indicated that increasing the temperature of the floor of a chamber increased the frequency, duration, and intensity of aggressive encounters between rats observed in the chamber. I26</page><page sequence="9">AMBIENT TEMPERATURE, POPULATION DENSITY AND AGGRESSION 127 The present study also demonstrated the role of population density on aggression although it was the interaction of temperature and observation period with population density that was significant. As a main effect it made little difference, statistically, what the density was - animals of both strains were as likely to fight as much in one enclosure as in another. Evidence suggesting the presence of a density effect on aggression already exists, although the reported effect is more than likely a physiological one. Increases in population density tend to increase the size of some glands such as the adrenals and thyroid, and decrease the size of others such as the gonads (ANDERSON, et al., I968; CHRISTIAN, I955; SOUTHWICK &amp; BLAND, I959; THIESSEN &amp; ROGERS, I96I). It was pointed out above that these physiological changes can alter the aggressiveness of animals of several species. However, these changes are observed only after prolonged periods of crowding and are not usually recordable after brief periods such as the o100 minutes in the present experiment. A very large density effect should therefore not have been anticipated, and was not observed. There was, however, a significant interaction between population density and temperature. It is suggested that this was primarily due to the proximity of the animals in the various sized enclosures and not to the influence of physiological factors. While no data were collected of the activity of the mice, E's notes indicated that there was a tendency for increased activity at the temperatures resulting in the most aggression. There was also a tendency for the animals to fight most in the 0.09 m2 enclosure, least in the 0.38 m2 enclosure, and moderately in the 0.2I m2 enclosure when the temperature was 2I.I°C, 26.7°C, and 32.2°C (Figure 2). This seems to lend plausability to the suggestion that fighting is made easier if an aggressor animal can locate a victim. Apparently, the close quarters of the o.o9 m2 enclosure facilitated the maintenance of aggressive contacts and as the enclosure in- creased in area it became accordingly more difficult to maintain those con- tacts. This conclusion is supported by the lower aggression scores in the large enclosures. It has already been mentioned that in two instances aggression in the 0.38 m2 enclosure was somewhat different from aggression in the two smaller enclosures (Figures 2 &amp; 3). This was probably due to the large size of that particular enclosure which obviously disrupted or interferred with aggressive behavior. The large area involved could limit aggression by making contacts between animals less likely to occur than in smaller enclosures, or by providing victims with better opportunities to escape from, and maintain that escape, aggressor animals. The ease or difficulty an aggressor S had in locating, reaching and maintaining contact with a sub-</page><page sequence="10">128 GARY GREENBERG ordinate S may have been a function of the chance proximity of the animals in that large enclosure, and could be related to perceptual factors. This suggested proximity and perceptual effect was anticipated earlier by ULRICH (I966), among others, who noted that rats fought more in small chambers than they did in large chambers after the administration of painful shock. This result was attributed by ULRICH to the proximity of the rats in the two chambers. Moreover, WILLIS (I966), in a study of aggression in pigeons, pointed out that, "It would appear that a meaningful generalization concerning fighting and space should specify the visual properties of the space [p. 316]." Another factor relating space and fighting alludes to ideas of territoriality and personal space. It is known that intrusions by males into the territories of other male conspecifics results in aggression on the part of the resident of the territory (MARLER &amp; HAMILTON, I966; TINBERGEN, 1953); it has also been established that mice form and defend such territories (DAVIS, 1958; MACKINTOSH, I970), and that small animals (e.g., mice) form small territories (HEDIGER, I950). It is conceivable that the confined space of the smallest enclosure used here made intrusions into another S's territory or personal space unavoidable. This would account for the high incidence of aggression in the small enclosure used here. Increasing the area of the en- closure could reduce the probability of those intrusions resulting in a decrease in aggressive incidents in the larger enclosures, which was observed in the C57BL/IoJ strain here '(Table I). Admittedly, it may be stretching the concept of territoriality to imply that mice can establish territories within the short confinement period in this study. There is also the possibility of being anthropomorphic by postulating the existence of so human a trait as a personal space around animals such as mice, although it is clear that some animals do have their own "individual distance" tolerances (HEDIGER, I950). Nevertheless, such analyses may have some merit in light of HEDIGER'S suggestion that "Greater living density, where the animals have less room to spread out increases social quarrels to the extent of open anti-social behavior [I950, p. 25]." Finally, aggression of both strains decreased from the first to the third observation period. That is, both strains fought more at the beginning of their IOO min. stays in the enclosures than at the end of those stays. There is nothing surprising about this result since strange animals thrust together in a group begin the task of organizing a social hierarchy almost immediately (GUHL, I962). The groups used here were initially disorganized units by virtue of the fact that all Ss in them had limited social experience after weaning and were isolated strangers before being assigned to the groups.</page><page sequence="11">AMBIENT TEMPERATURE, POPULATION DENSITY AND AGGRESSION 129 This is important since BRONSON (I963) has suggested that it is often easy to confuse pure density and behavioral organization effects in a short-term grouping of animals. Moreover, all accounts of socialization processes refer to a time consuming and dynamic activity and not to an instantaneous one (GUHL, i962; SCOTT, I960). The above comments lead directly to the conclusion that aggression can be brought under the control of stimulation such as is provided by the am- bient temperature and population density of the environment an organism happens to be in. The generality of this result was demonstrated by the presence of these effects in two genetically distinct mouse strains. To be sure, the results of the population density manipulation were somewhat muddled, attesting to the complexity of aggressive behavior. If the two en- vironmental stimuli investigated here can bring aggression under control so may others such as food and water deprivation, diet composition, circadian variables, etc. Further research may provide important clues for the regulation of aggression in all animals, including man. SUMMARY I. 240 Male mice from the aggressive C57BL/Io5 strain and non-aggressive A/J strain were subjected to temperatures of I8.3°C, 2I.I°C, 26.7°C, 32.2°C or 35°C for 24 hours. 2. The mice were then crowded in groups of 8 into enclosures with floor areas of 0.09, 0.2I, or 0.38 m2. 3. The frequency of aggression acts (biting frequency) was recorded for each animal 30, 6o, and go90 min. after being put in the enclosures. 4. Aggression was lowest at I8.3°C and 35°C and tended to increase as the temperature increased from I8.3°C to 32.2°C. 5. There appeared to be more aggression in the more crowded conditions than in the less crowded conditions. 6. The results were attributed to metabolic changes induced by increasing temperature and to perceptual and proximity effects resulting from increasing population density.
