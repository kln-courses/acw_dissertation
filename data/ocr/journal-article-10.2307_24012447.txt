<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PIETY OF SAMUEL RUTHERFORD (C. 1621-1661) A neglected feature of Seventeenth Century Scottish Calvinism by J. K. Cameron St. Andrews Scotland, unlike England and the Netherlands, can lay no claim to distinction on account of its mystical writers, although Henry Scougal (c. 1650-1678), the author of a minor classic The Life of God in the Soul of Man (London, 1667), deserves to be much better known than he is. Samuel Rutherford, the subject of this essay is today best remembered for his theological and political writings, including Lex Rex, a powerful defence of the political rights of the people; for his leadership in the Covenanting movement in its opposition to State domination in religion; and for his participation in the Westminster Assembly of Divines as one of the non voting Scottish commissioners. He was, however, the author of an exten sive collection of letters of spiritual counsel, that for long enjoyed a wide popularity both in Scotland and on the continent. Rutherford's Letters first appeared from the press in 1664 under the title foshua Redivivus or Mr Rutherford's Letters. Neither the printer's name nor place of publication is mentioned, but it is believed that, like so many of Rutherford's works, this first edition was printed and published in Rotter dam, having been collected and edited by his former amanuensis Robert McWard, at that time a minister at Rotterdam1. A Dutch translation was published at Flushing ten years later. In succeeding centuries right up to the end of the 19th century the collecting of letters from Rutherford was vigorously pursued. They appeared in new enlarged editions and were translated into several languages. The now Standard English edition, by the Scottish evangelical A. A. Bonnar, the latest printing of which was published in 1891, contains some 365 letters compared with the 284 of the first Rotterdam edition. According to my latest information the number of editions that have been printed in Holland is twelve, the most recent being published in 1973. Almost all of Rutherford's other works have in 1 Short-Title Catalogue of Books Printed in England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, and British America, and of English Books printed in other Countries 1641-1700, D.

Rutherford received his education at the University of Edinburgh, was ordained to the ministry and inducted to the extensive rural parish of An woth in the South West of Scotland in 1627. Apart from two years spent as an exile in Aberdeen on account of his non-conformity to episcopacy and his attacks upon the Arminianism of the prevailing episiopalian party he remained at Anwoth exercising his pastorai ministry until his appoint ment as Primarius Professor of Divinity in St Andrews in 1639 and later as Principal of St Mary's College, a post which he did not effectively fulfill until at least 1645. In 1648 and again in 1651 he declined calls to pro fessorial chairs in the Low Countries, first at Hardenwyck and second at Utrecht. On his appointment to St Andrews University he made it a con dition of his acceptance that he be allowed to continue to exercise a pastorai ministry and that he be permitted to preach regularly. Thus, as well as being professor and principal he became one of the parish ministers of the city. He died in office in 1661 3. The popularity accorded to his Letters at various times in both Great Britain and in the Netherlands will to many readers seem hard to explain, whereas their languishing in virtual obscurity in Scotland in the 20th cen tury will be readily understood and given wholehearted approval. It should in fairness be pointed out that their popularity was even in the 18th century not unquestioned — to some critics they were 'fit only for old wives'. If, however, the Letters are read with a sympathetic eye and if an attempt is made to keep in mind the age for which they were written (an age in many essential ways so different from our own) they will provide the reader with an insight into a feature of Scottish religious history that has been much overlooked and perhaps into an aspect of the Calvinist tradition that has been too readily discounted. At the outset it must be admitted that for the genera! reader today the form of expression is hardly attractive, although it would have been perfectly acceptable to many of the great mystical writers in the mediaeval catholic tradition. The form in which Rutherford expressed his devotion and piety it must be stressed largely resulted from the contemporary Catholic and Reformed doctrine of the Bible as containing the Word of 7 A comprehensive list of Rutherford's works translated into Dutch and published in the Netherlands is given in Front Alladie to Young: A Bibliography of English, most Puritan Works translated UT Dutch Languagc, compiled by J. van der Haar, volume I, Veenendaal, 1980 pp. 116-117.

This 'spiritualisation' led Rutherford, to use as had St Bernard the biblical 'love' language of the Song of Songs in order to describe the rela tionship between Christ and the believer and indeed to do so almost to the exclusion of all other forms of interpretation. For example, in a letter in 1629 to a lady who, along with her husband, was leaving his parish (a lady with whom he later correspond regularly), he wrote 'I trust ye are so betrothed in marriage to the true Christ that ye will not give your love to any false Christ. Ye know not how soon your marriage day will come ... ye are well lodged ... if ye can in faith lean down your head upon the breast of Jesus Christ ... It is a sweet soul-sleep to lie in the arms of Christ; for his breath is very sweet4. Another example may be taken from a letter to the same lady in the following year. He wrote 'it were good to come oft into terms of speech with God, both in prayer and in the hearing of the Word. For this is the house of wine, where ye meet with your well beloved. Here it is where he kisseth you with the kisses of his mouth, and where ye feel the smell of his garments; and they have indeed a most frag ment and glorious smell. Ye must, I say, wait upon him and be often com muning with him, whose lips are as lilies dropping sweet-smelling myrrh, and by the moving thereof he will assuage your grief, for the Christ that saveth you is a speaking Christ; the Church knoweth him by his voice (Song II, 8) and can discern his tongue amongst a thousand5.' Many quotations could be given, but these examples will serve as evidence of the nature of his religious language, a language that makes Rutherford's piety 'honied' and unacceptable. But language apart, what was Rutherford's message? The key to much of his thinking and writing is to be found in his intense pastoral concern. Above all he regarded himself as primarily a minister of the Gospel en trusted with the curë of souls in what was for him a deeply depressing human situation. The generally harsh conditions of life in 17th century Scotland, which was no respector of social standing or class status, form the essential background to much of his spiritual teaching. When reading his letters or his sermons it is necessary to keep in mind the ever present physical and material suffering which accompanied, and at times tended 4 Letters p. 43. 5 Letters p. 47.</page><page sequence="4">156 J. K. CAMERON to overwhelm daily life, not to mention the political and religious conflict at national level. In his ministry Rutherford sought to set that suffering in a biblical context and to help his parishioners and his correspondents and not at least himself to use that experience to spiritual advantage and growth in grace. Rutherford's piety maintains that not only must man expect affliction in this world but that he must also welcome it. 'Welcome every rod of Christ, for I find not in the whole Book of God a greater note of the child of God than to fall down and kiss the feet of angry God'6. The Christian must believe and fully accept that God has a reason for his suffering and his affliction. God must also be seen in all man's tribulations. 'The wicked may hold the bitter cup to your head, but God mixes it, and there is no poison in it'7. 'We are on the way to heaven under the Lord's crosses ... rejoice and be glad to bear the reproaches of Christ'8. This is an often recurring theme and is characteristically expressed in one of his sermons that was in 1668 translated into Dutch. 'The saints have a Life-rent Tack (a life-time lease) of the cross of Christ, while we are here [it is] ay ill weather, ever the cross ... Let us prepare, for tears will follow us to heaven, unto the very entry into the door, our face shall be wet, for we get out of this life sad and groaning for this miserable life'. Yet he con tinues 'Rejoice, in heaven there is never a greeting bairn [crying child] ... God has a napkin to dicht their faces. It is the laughing, rejoicing peo ple that God destroys' 9. Those who shrug off and laugh at the world's sor rows and suffering are the ones abandoned by God. The Christian attitude to suffering is to welcome it and to triumph over it and over this world. The spiritual life is one of bearing crosses; this is no less needful than daily food. It brings communion with Christ. 'If ye would have pres ent comfort under the cross be much in prayer, for at that time your faith kisseth Christ and he kisseth the soul10.' This attitude to the sufferings of the physical world is counterbalanced by a very real sense of the world to come. Rutherford seeks to encourage in his readers an eager anticipation of the new birth, the new life, that the believer will one day experience, of the place where 'the soul shall feast and banquet for ever upon the glorious sight of the incomprehensible Trinity and where it shall see the fair face of the man Christ, even the Letters p. 55.

There is in Ruterhford's letters more than a tracé of what can only be described as mysticism. He tells the reader 'If ye can but say that ye long earnestly to be carried up thither (and I hope you cannot for shame deny him the honour of having wrought that desire in your soul) then hath the Lord given you an earnest ... His honour and his great court in heaven hath not made him forget his poor friends on earth ... He doth desire you company. Take him for the old Christ and say "O it is so; He is not changed but I am changed.12." ' Belief in the world to come determines the Christian's attitude to this world in which there is so much sorrow and suffering. The Christian has always 'one foot loose from the earth13'; one foot here and the other in the life to come, so that we leave off wanting for things in this world and long for the next. Nevertheless for Rutherford there has to be a more positive, a less negative, attitude to this world. True, there is at times a neo-Platonist strain as for example when he refers on more than one occasion to the body as 'a clay prison house'14. He is, however, no traditional ascetic. He does not advocate neglect of the body; he has no place for mortification of the flesh as a spiritual exercise. 'Remember you are in the body, and it is the lodging house; and you may not without offending the Lord suffer the old walls of that house to fall down through want of necessary food. Your body is the dweiling place of the Spirit, and therefore for the love that you carry to the sweet guest, give due regard to the house of clay. When he looseth the walls, why not "Welcome, Lord Jesus" ... but it is a fearful sin in us to hurt the body by fasting ... for the house is not our own. The Bridegroom is with you yet, so fast that also you may feast and rejoice in him 15.' This is a particu larly Reformed feature of his piety. The consciousness of the presence of Christ, which in life is always fleeting and fragmentary, is arguably the dominant theme in his piety. He is constantly referring to the individuals experience of Christ. 'It is little to see Christ in a book as men do the world in a card [map], They talk Christ by the book and the tongue and no more, but to come nigh Christ and hause him and embrace him is another thing16.' Rutherford 11 Letters p. 68. 12 Letters pp. 67ff. 13 Letters p. 68, 72. 14 E.g. Letters p. 80. 15 Letters pp. 84f. 16 Letters pp. 148f.</page><page sequence="6">158 J. K. CAMERON repeatedly wrote that he often doubted the presence of Christ, became depressed and disputed whether or not he had ever known anything of Christianity but the individual characters of the word, yet he had also ex perienced those times when 'the Lord commeth with a fair hour.' Then he could write 'My prison is a palace to me and Christ's banqueting house.' Yet like many a saint and mystic he found it 'hard wrestling to play fair with Christ and to keep good quarters with him and to love in integrity and life and to keep a constant course of sound and solid daily communion with Christ17.' He wrote in Christ Dying and Drawing Sinners to Himself 'We desire a never interrupted presence and sense of God so we have to learn 'that clouds alter not the sunlight, coverings change not Christ ... The Lord Jesus is more within than we can enjoy of him in his love-expressions; he loses none of his imminent sweetness under his wise withdrawings' '8. The presence of God with his own is a constant theme. That it is grounded in God's love is at the heart of Rutherford's religious belief and experience, and it is that belief which links him with some of the mystics of the past. He wrote 'The presence of God with his own makes God and them to be as one by God's union of love.' Gods love is the air, the ele ment we live in, in the highest new Jerusalem.' 'Christ our Redeemer is a mass of love and chooseth to dweil in a heart paved with love and meekness' '9. Consciously or not Rutherford echoed St Bernard when he wrote 'Ye shall find it your only happiness in this life to love nothing for itself but only God for himself ... Our love to him should begin on earth as it shall be in heaven ... if ye can win to this love, the field is won20.' It is sometimes said, and perhaps with some justification, that Scottish Calvinism of the 17 th and 18th centuries was spiritually arid and highly intellectual, that it appealed to the mind rather than to the heart. It is true that its classical and symbolic statements, to name but two, the Westminster Con/ession of Faith and the Shorter Catechism in the making of which Ruther ford took a leading role, can be fairly characterised as such. Yet this is but one side of Calvinism. Rutherford would stoutly claim that the piety which overflowed in his works, and which was one of an intensely prac tical nature is entiely in accord with these confessional documents. If he were called upon to justify the highly anthropomorphic form of its expres 17 Letters p. 172. 18 Translated into Dutch in 1917.

The answer embodies an element of doctrine which primarily is intended to emphasise tradi tional Trinitarian orthodoxy, and yet at the same time emphasises an essential element in Christian faith that was often in danger of being lost sight of in Calvinist theology. The Question "Who is the Redeemer of God's elect? is give the answer: "The only Redeemer of God's elect is the Lord Jesus Christ, who being the eternal son of God became man, and so was and continueth to be God and man in two distinct natures, and one per son forever." This continuity of the human nature as well as the divine is, I believe, Rutherford's justification in part for his presentation of the Jesus of his faith in essentially human terms and for the expression of his piety in ways that evoke some of the deepest of human emotions. This characteristic was significantly noted in his own day by an English mer chant visitor who has left us an interesting glimpse of the two ministers of the town. They represent the two facets of contemporary Scottish Calvinism. He wrote "I went to St Andrew's where I heard a sweet majestic-looking man, [Robert Blair, one of the ministers of the Parish Church] and he showed me the majesty of God. After him I heard a little fair man [Rutherford] and he showed me the loveliness of Christ."</page></plain_text>
