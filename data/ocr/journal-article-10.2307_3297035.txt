<plain_text><page sequence="1">Virgil's Poem of the Earth: Studies in the Georgics. By MICHAEL C. J. PUTNAM. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1979. Pp.xiii + 336. $20.00 To Michael Putnam's third book on Virgil we can bring some expectations that will not be disappointed. More in the German thematic symbolist tradition of Poschl than the symbolist/structuralist school of Otis, he is past master at pellucid and concise exposition of a passage (e.g. the sun-signs leading to mention of Tithonus [67], and the Libyans and Scythians, [208-10]), at elucidating parallels (as the storms of Books 1 and 2[125]), symbolic unities (the comparison of trees and flames in Book 2 [121-22]), and the use of sources (the plague in Virgil and Lucretius [221] and the comparison of Aristaeus and Achilles [282-84]) that significantly extend our understanding of Virgil's craft. But we also bring to a book-length study of the Georgics the expectation of some treatment of the poem's general unity and structure, the principal concern of those who have written on the poem from Burck to Otis. Such is not to be found here, and if one comes away with a higher appreciation of Virgil's poetic skills, one will gain no clearer view of the poem as a whole. The nature of the book beggars summary, but I shall try to touch the main points. Putnam begins by telling us what the Georgics is and what it is not. Coming between the Eclogues and the Aeneid, it is a way station between the literal primitivism of a pastoral existence .. and the supposedly civilized example of primal Roman man, modeling history as it was and is to be lived. Man must descend from the hills and curb his nomadic instincts by existing close to the land and experiencing the stability this intimacy fosters before he can form the civic aggregates that lend force to his pretensions toward empire. "(4-5) The poem is not essentially didactic, nor a call back to the glories of the Italian soil and the moral values of old Rome, nor purely descriptive or escapist, for these are incompatible with Virgil's pessimistic outlook: "Outer nature's negative indifference to man's situation can only be partially altered by man who, with continuous effort and the constant imposition of order on her chaos, can expand her rhythms to embrace growth as well as decay, creation as well as destruction "(7). For Putnam, the Georgics is a symbolic path to self-fulfillment: "The civilization of the nature that we see depends on the cultivation of our inner selves"(13), that is, "our mental attitudes [are in the] guise of soils, plants, animals, and bees"(15). The poem assumes the didactic guise because knowledge, particularly of nature, gives man "the means of self-control necessary for managing his psyche "(8), and man has more to fear from himself than from nature's "negative relentlessness" (80). Book 1, the most pessimistic of the poem, shows man unsuccessfully mediating sky and earth, for try as man will, "our treacherous world [is] beyond any human help"(26). The "georgic man" or "georgic artist" (77) imposes a harmonious order on the land by struggle, much as Octavian, the "historical man" (80), orders the political state. The general theme of Book 1 is that of "turning, " both the positive turning of the soil by farmers, which effects the "artistic" purpose of molding nature into patterns, and the negative overturning of society by Octavian (75-76), who bears the same</page><page sequence="2">372 APRIL-MAY relationship to political man as agricultural man does to the earth (14), being "but a version of the farmer whose power is more universal "(77). Bacchus presides over the slightly more positive Book 2 as "orderer and disorderer, at once the necessary companion of Apollo and his unruly antagonist"(158). Again, man is evil and nature is moody (162-63), but the book as a whole is a "comedy" that "abstracts us genially from life's immediate bitterness only to reveal in the end, by a series of contextual contrasts, a highly serious side"(84). Some optimism is possible (99), and Virgil reverses the negative portrayal of the storm in Book 1 to show the helpful concord of earth and heaven in Book 2 (125): and the loosed horses of Book 1 are here under control (164). O fbrtunatos nimium . . . is Virgil's fantasy of control, for control of something implies the middle ground of moderation or restraint of one's own impulses: "The georgic existence is an historical mean between distant past and present, wilderness and city living, which in itself advocates an ethic of moderation precariously balanced between primitivism and hypersophistication, between the old barbarism of no art and the new decadence of art misused. " (142) In the prologue to Book 3 Virgil describes himself as a twin conqueror: 1) a metaphorical general who has taken as his spoils the Muses of Helicon, thus defeating Hesiod, and 2) as the man who can cheat death through poetry. The temple is the "symbol for a higher, grander poetic stance, " a combination of epic and pastoral (168). "Virgil's grand design" in 3 is "to detail how first sexuality and then death, eros and thanatos, are universals under whose domineering shadow lie beast and man alike, and to contrast this perception with the immortal strivings of the opening "(201). Two cycles reach their fulfillment at the end of the book: the second half had begun with the farmer attempting to prevent illness in his herds, and the book ends with the uncontrollable plague: the book as a whole began with Virgil's claims of victory over death and ends with the victory of death (231-33). In Book 4 the georgic artist comes into prominence by further refining the existence of the bees from its already highly organized state (247-48). The life of the bees, which precludes learning and independent action (263), is the opposite of Orpheus', which is the paragon of the poetic life. Aristaeus, the ideal of the georgic artist (276-77) learns by a three-part aristeia the nature of life and thus the nature of himself. The theme is that life lived at the extremities of behavior is bad, and indeed, "Aristaeus survives where Orpheus ... does not, because he can balance his humanness with his immortal pedigree so as to exert mind on matter and create an additional form of art that brightens our world "(321). The final message is encouraging: "With the proper prayer and sacrifice we can not only appease the divine spirits immanent in the natural world, we can refresh moribund aspects of nature and improve life in the doing"(318). Neither Libyan sands nor Ionian billows are more numerous than the host of insights and clever elucidations found here, all of which beg discussion and admiration. Putnam is at his best when he calls a passage "brilliant" as he does on 61 (Nisus-Scylla), 78(1.509-14), 198-99 (bull-battle of 3.258-63), and 213-15 (snakes of 3.414-39). He is particularly good on parallels with the Aeneid, especially on the bees in Geo. 4 and Aen. 1 (256) although in some cases (e.g. pp. 285 and 293), one would hardly realize that the Georgics was written first. Sometimes his brightest passages are accompanied by flights of inference and speculation: as when the oak becomes linear time (120), or the dying bull represents the demise of the georgic landscape(224). The reader may go along for the ride if he chooses. In larger terms, we can see that the strengths of Putnam's method have their concomitant weaknesses. If this book often reads like a collection of perceptive articles</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL 373 rather than a patiently argued case (or like one of the recent novels composed of connected short stories), we blame Putnam's infrequent concern for the carefully marked structure of the poem, the exquisite arrangement of agricultural lore and legend that builds to a poetic climax in each book and leads ultimately to the Aristaeus epyllion. To disregard this matter is to sidestep the great question that has troubled readers of the poem since Servius. It is one thing to analyze perceptively the proem to Book 3 (165-73), but we should be made aware that there is also a long proem to Book I to which this relates, as well as the long concluding digressions in each book (as opposed to 2 and 4, which have short introductions and short "signature" conclusions). How does, for example, the success of Aristaeus in following the gods' instructions compare with man's failure to do so at the end of Book 1? Putnam is so good when he does discuss these matters of structure, as the relationship of the two halves of Book 3, for instance, that one only wishes he would bring his talents to bear on these questions more often. In addition, the concentration on individual episodes seems to bring more or less the same critical tone (usually portentous and pessimistic) to each passage, thereby obscuring Virgil's modulation of tone from one passage to the next. It should not be forgotten that Virgil began the Georgics in the year following the publication of Varro's De Re Rustica, which, like the Georgics (pace Putnam p. 5), portrays the full variety of the farmer's life in didactic guise, not unmindful of current political turmoil (e.g. the tragic end of their host in Book 1). Rustic wit, the sense of wonder at nature's plenty and variety, the astonishment at the luxurious tastes of the urban rich (the raison d' etre of Book 3), and the esprit de corps of those enlisted in the campaign against the soil not only cut the laborious description of soil types and grain varieties, but give a fuller depiction of rustic life. It is surely the variety of nature, contemplated at leisure, that Virgil emulates in numerous homely or charming "digressions," which are especially rich in Geo. 2., particularly the frolicking birds in the pools of Cayster, the farmer's celebration of their happy harvests, the abundance of Italy, and so on. Often when an avowed pessimist argues with an inveterate optimist, the former will claim for himself the title of "realist" and indeed for Putnam, it is Virgil's realism that makes him a pessimist (30, 34, 142, but see 99). But to say this, even in the twentieth century, is to fail to flesh out Virgil's achievement and his view of realism, which is a moderation between the extremes, and lies behind what is to me (but not to Putnam) a very clear rejection of Lucretian pessimism in Book 2 (there is no mention of Lucretius in the discussion of 2.458-74 and 503-12) and a positive, realistic ending. The most grievous example I find is the decidedly mock heroic descriptions of the bees, particularly the bee-battles, which derive their humor from anthropomorphism and which, as Putnam rightly says, reflect man's relationship to the deities. He gets the meaning, but misses the tone and is all solemn, when most readers are smiling (e.g. at the Callimachean bee-traveller, p. 247). The book has additional deficiencies not found in Putnam's previous work. Some translations need care: importunae does not mean "oppressive" at 1.470, but "ominous" or "unseasonable"(69); caeci at 3.210 does not mean "dark" but "reckless" (190, but see 199); to say "dyed the color of glass" is nonsensical to modems and misses the sea-green quality of hyali saturofucata colore at 4.335 (278). Swine, not men, eat acorns at 1.520 (9) and he makes much of the Cyclopes' "imprisonment, " which Virgil does not mention (257). There are signs of haste: he confuses "imminent" with "immanent" (19, 135, but see 189), and writes "poem" for "book" (68, 78, but see 202) and "evolution" for "growth" (130). Articles are missing on pp. 115, 147, and 150. With reluctance I must mention some representative self-indulgences of style such as extreme literalism like "autopsy" for "Virgil's personal experience" (39), oxymora like "change unchangeably" (43), and "preternaturally back-sliding nature" (123),</page><page sequence="4">374 APRIL-MAY redundancies like "interassociate" (192) and "overmastered" (200) that tend to distract the reader from the author's point. This is then a perceptive, valuable, often brilliant but severe book, unrelieved of Virgil's pessimistic aspects and without that moderation between extremes of emotion that so characterizes the poem and its author. Were the Georgics as gloomy and solemn as Putnam allows, it would not be the great and popular poem it has been. Were we in a Burmese prison camp, or were we Robert Herrick in Stevenson's Ebb Tide, we would be moved by this paean to "the perfection of civilization as Virgil sees it, [which] occurred long ago, at a moment when georgic continuities and linear history merged in the Roman past, when human ethics and the courage demanded by agriculture complemented each other" (9-10) in a way that urban scholars do not see. I wish Putnam's skills could also be applied to the larger scheme of the poem, where one is governed more by the momentum of Virgil's intentions and less by what critical ideas, however important, one brings to it.
