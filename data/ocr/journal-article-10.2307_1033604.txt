<plain_text><page sequence="1">Alternative Views of Big Business Goals and Purposes By HAROLD L. JOHNSON ABSTRACT: Instead of profit maximization as a single goal of big business, organization-theory, game-theory, and behavioral- science views indicate that the objectives of modern enterprise are plural and complex. Organization theory emphasizes the coalition character of big business, suggesting that with many participants comes variety in goals. Games in theory and in experiment reveal that players often carry to circumstances of rivalry and bargaining ideas of fairness and mutual restraint. The normative aspects of business affairs and changing role expectations concerning big business make available a be- havioral basis for discussion of nonprofit goals. These views of business goals offer analytical frameworks by which social responsibility and ethics can be studied. Such behavior thus is not an odd mutation in a world of profit maximization. It reflects the coalition dimension of big business and the social environment in which decisions are made. To complicate things, these models also indicate the importance of profit, efficiency, and innovation goals in business, confronting par- ticipants in big business and the people of the United States with dilemmas of choice. These choices are serious, for with them comes simultaneous impact upon the institutional ar- rangements of the American economy. Harold L.

Economists studying "big business" or oligopoly markets, the market habitat of most big businesses, have concluded that, in these circum- stances, the profit-maximization assump- tion is either meaningless, too crude, or in error. Economists have found that, in industries where there is interdepend- ence among firms or where there is free- dom of action within the loose confines of the market, the profit-maximization assumption is a rather poor analytical device. But, if many students of big business no longer equate large firms and profit maximization in a one-to-one sort of way, what do they put in the place of this idea? What alternative models are there of the goals of the large firm? Where do more broad corporate goals take us in the United States? Down the road to socialism, toward a more responsible economy, or to a twentieth- century feudalism? The answers to these questions are the subject matter of this paper, with the last two ques- tions, however, raised more than an- swered. The paper focuses on the under- standings or conclusions concerning motivations or goals arising out of organ- ization-theory, game-theory, and be- havioral-science approaches to the large business enterprise. Thus, this paper primarily probes what is rather than what should be concerning business be- havior. The question of whether the large corporation should or should not have the goal characteristics described here is left to other contributors to this volume-though finally it is left with the citizens of the United States. What these understandings of the firm indicate concerning ethics in business and so- cially responsible business behavior is discussed. Some of the implications of what is concerning corporate objectives are examined at the close of the piece. AN ORGANIZATION-THEORY MODEL 1 The view that profits are the only goal of big business faces difficulty in awareness that the corporation is a per- son only in legal theory. Lawyers, for their purposes, may conceive of the corporation as an artificial person, but, for the purposes of explanation and pre- diction of corporate behavior, this seems to be a faulty beginning. One analyst has noted the "error in anthropomorph- ism" in constructing a model of the cor- poration simply in the image of individ- ual man. The organizational character of the enterprise seems to require a different definition. Organization theory views the enterprise as made up of many participants, such as suppliers, the many categories of employees, ex- ecutives, dealers, and stockholders. A business organization consists of partly conflicting, partly complementary par- ticipants or interest groups. It does not possess a single mind, "conscience," or set of motivations as does an individ- ual, for it is, in an organization-theory model, a coalition of many individuals and groups. The monetary and non- monetary inducements necessary to en- sure the participation of these individ- uals and groups make organization ob- jectives a miscellany of goals. The "side payments" to coalition members in the form of democratic supervision of labor force or fairness to dealers and suppliers shape, and indeed are a part 1This model is that of Chester I.

The web of contractual relationships between sup- pliers and national mail-order establish- ments indicates that fair and equitable arrangements are a part of the "price" for participation of manufacturers in the mail-order business. Stockholders with profit goals, of course, may be important members of contemporary enterprise, but, in this model, top executives are more strategic participants. Executives bring their own goals to the organization and they act as "peak co-ordinators" of the firm, facilitating bargaining and negotiation between other participants. In this model, executives act as brokers, so to speak, between the various members of the organization. In traditional legal and economic theory, this rich and com- plex pattern of goals is homogenized into the purposes of stockholders through the terms of legal contract. This, how- ever, seems to be an unsatisfactory solu- tion, judging from ample evidence in American industry that such a trans- formation of objectives does not take place. The objectives of big business, then, are conceived of here as varied rather than monolithic and as shaped by inter- actions of many participants in flexible coalition rather than being only profits to owners. To go on, the goals of organization arrived at in a coalition manner take a "satisficing" rather than maximizing form. This feature of or- ganizational goals can be seen by first looking at the objectives of individuals. According to psychologists, individuals have target aspirations which they seek to achieve. These aspiration levels are influenced by past performance in rela- tion to goals, past aspiration levels, and by comparison with others in similar circumstances and conditions. Aspira- tion levels, furthermore, tend to change only slowly in face of achievement above or below target. Individuals and groups playing the game of life tend to take as acceptable or "good enough" activi- ties or relationships which meet or exceed their aspiration levels. In the language of operations research, in the real world, feasibility rather than opti- mality tests generally are used to gauge behavior. Maximization of goals is left aside be- cause of the "bounded rationality" con- ditions under which individuals operate and because of the "suboptimization" consequences of optimizing a single goal out of a goal set. To explain this bit of jargon, the individual follows a satis- ficing approach because he does not know enough concerning his possible strategies or the state of the world to optimize his goals. He is rational in a partial or bounded sort of way. If the goals of individuals are plural rather than single, optimization of one goal often results in losses with other ob- jectives. Maximization of one goal means other important objectives cannot be met satisfactorily, the result being a "suboptimizing" with some goals and with over-all satisfaction. The individ- ual must, just as the housewife in the supermarket, balance his "expenditures" on objectives, getting something of all and thereby hopefully getting the great- est total satisfaction. Organization theorists by and large have transplanted these insights con- cerning the individual to an organization context. They posit that the miscellany of goals arising out of the coalitions called big business exist in aspira- tion-level, satisficing terms rather than in maximization. The goals of people in business concerning profits, sales, employee relations, growth, social re- sponsibility, and market shares are sub- ject to tests of "good enough" or feasi- bility rather than maximization. This view of corporate objectives helps explain why conflict between par- ticipants seeking different things from 3</page><page sequence="4">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY organization is not greater than it usually is. With goals subject to feasi- bility rather than optimality checks, the organization has a greater range of action in which the goals of many par- ticipants are satisfied. Conflict is par- tially side-stepped by the fact that the enterprise at any one time attends only to those objectives in which it is falling short. Particular goals receive attention only when achievement falls below target levels. Only in rare instances with many large firms-in deep reces- sion, for example-would the goals and interests of many participants fail to be met, opening to serious conflict. Much of the time, conflict remains latent as the focus is on different goals at different points in time. Not often are the goals of enterprise examined all at once. It is useful to see that the organiza- tion-theory view of firm objectives cuts in two directions. It is probably dis- appointing to those who believe that, by definition, the large corporation is a money machine. But it also must dis- appoint those who come equipped with a naive view of business ethics. This model indicates that profits assuredly are one of the goals of business organiza- tion and that, under certain conditions, will be a vital goal. The door is hardly opened to the proposition that the large business enterprise is an eleemosynary institution dispensing gifts and charity to one and all. It seems clear that one of the goals of the firm relates to profits as a total amount or a percent- age return on investment or sales. It is significant, though, that many com- pany officials, instead of talking and acting in terms of optimum profits, operate in terms of target rates of profits. This bears some resemblance to the organization-theory model of how goals are established and pursued. In circumstances such as a general reces- sion, new rivals in a market, or with changing consumer tastes, profit ob- jectives may be the most crucial of a goal set. This view, on the other hand, offers a framework for discussing ethics in business. Some critics have argued that talk of ethics in commerce is inevitably at the level of glittering generality, pleasing to the ear but without real content. The organization-theory model is a way of analyzing ethical or respon- sible behavior. Some of the participants in enterprise are the custodians of ethical or socially responsible practice. Labor unions and individuals as em- ployees have, as part of the nonmone- tary requisites for joining an enterprise, items often classified as ethical business behavior. A full elaboration of such items would be too time consuming to describe here. It is enough to note that the humanization of the work environment, safe working conditions, freedom from harsh and arbitrary super- vision, and proper notice of change in methods and place of work are part of the nonmonetary inducements necessary to get employees in twentieth-century America. In the case of retail dealers linked with national manufacturers, the nonmonetary requirements for participa- tion are seen in the developing system of law and contract between automobile dealers and the manufacturers. Com- mercial practices labeled as socially responsible can be viewed as part of the nonmonetary inducements necessary to secure participation of various people in the firm. Nonprofit behavior can be handled not as an odd mutation in a world of profit maximization but as an integral part of the goals of business organization. To indicate that this model is more than a few interesting hunches, there have been a number of efforts to test its basic propositions. These tests have been made in the traditional languages of economics and in the newer tech- 4</page><page sequence="5">ALTERNATIVE VIEWS OF BIG BUSINESS niques of computer simulation.2 While these studies are not conclusive, they indicate that the model can be subject to various validation procedures. A GAME-THEORY VIEW It may seem at first sight a fool's errand to use game theory as a basis for discussing ethics in big business. Talk of pay-offs, strategies, and malevo- lent foes who are seeking to do each other in seems out of harmony with such a discussion. To be sure, the idea of profit maximization gets short shrift in a game-theory model, for in the dynam- ics of rivalry survival appears to be a basic objective. Profits, market share, responsible practice, and cash in the bank are relegated to the status of means in a grand strategy to stay alive. But, in many games in theory, in actual experiment, and in the real world, the players-instead of being brutish, nasty antagonists-are individuals open to the possibilities of co-operation, fair play, mutual restraint, and live and let live. Parenthetically, investigators in game theory are at work exploring under what circumstances conflict and co- operation arise, and in studying the basic structure of co-operative games. In co-operative games of both theory and fact, neither profit maximization nor the goal of "do the other fellow in" is an appropriate way of characterizing the motivation or objectives of in- dividuals. Of course, often in many games players get together tacitly or overtly for mutual benefit, with this co-opera- tion to the disadvantage of parties out- 2 See, for example, R. M. Cyert and J. G. March, "Organizational Factors in the Theory of Oligopoly," Quarterly Journal of Economics, February 1956; Melvin W. Reder, "A Recon- sideration of the Marginal Productivity The- ory," Journal of Political Economy, Vol. 55 (1947), pp. 450-458; and R. M. Cyert and J. G. March, "Models in a Behavioral Theory of the Firm," Behavioral Science, April 1959. side the game or to the community at large. This is a criticism of the bargain- ing between labor and management in major industries in America or of the tacit co-operation between rival business firms to avoid price cutting. These comments remind us that sometimes the substitution of industry or group benefit for individual self-interest leaves ob- jectives well short of the highest and best! The co-operation and mutual sharing between members of a gang of juvenile delinquents to carry out may- hem, robbery, and murder does not seem altogether to fit the description of proper ethical behavior! Game theory, however, makes avail- able insights in addition to the proposi- tions that co-operation among players and a philosophy of mutual restraint may change economic rivalry from dog- eat-dog to a policy of live-and-let-live. These additional insights are derived from game experiments in bargaining carried out by a number of inves- tigators.3 These games reveal that many players bring to conflict and bargaining situations ideas of fairness and equity which influence their deci- sions. Contrary to the themes of maximum pursuit of self-interest, many individuals are reluctant to push their position to the utmost when they pos- sess the power to do so. They are in- terested in results which are fair and equitable. Principles of split the dif- ference and pursuit of justice have been found in games where the advantage would seem to lie in different kinds of policies. These developments in game theory point to an economic motivation and behavior more complex than the assumptions of narrow self-interest. But where do such motivations, purposes, and objectives come from? One an- 3 See the article by Ward Edwards, "Be- havioral Decision Theory," Annual Review of Psychology, Vol. 12 (1961), pp. 490-493, for a summary of these developments. 5</page><page sequence="6">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY swer to this question lies in the proposi- tions to which the discussion now turns. A BEHAVIORAL VIEW It is undoubtedly trite and obvious beyond excuse to describe human beings as social animals, but perhaps some may forget that this cliche extends also to big-business executives! According to behavioral scientists, businessmen, as the rest of society, grow up in social relationships which give them a reason- ably well-organized set of attitudes, concepts, and values concerning physical and social reality. The development of a "self" or personality arises out of the interrelationships into which the individ- ual is thrust, with family, peer groups, schools, churches, and mass media so- cializing him. Without such social re- lationships, the individual is a virtual beast rather than a human being. He is directed and influenced by social cir- cumstances, but they help make him into a person. By a behavioral model, people in a real sense are like electronic computers in that social and cultural circumstances "program" them so that they react in particular ways of doing and thinking about things. By this framework, the motivation of people, businessmen included, is shaped and formed by the social relations in which they exist. The flow of communication in which individuals inevitably exist as children and as adults relates to both facts and to norms. We learn what is from what is not, and we also learn about what ought to be rather than what ought not to be. In the language of this model, individuals, by taking up a pattern of attitudes and values, internalize a nor- mative frame at the level of conscience. Attitudes and norms give an ethical dimension to life, indicating a group consensus of what should or should not be done in particular situations. This view of behavior should not be dismissed as relevant only to matters of social custom, dress, or eating habits, for big business as an organization and businessmen as individuals live in a social environment. There are many norms concerning business action. Many businessmen seek to "give people their money's worth," partially because com- petition forces them to but also because the customs and norms of America sug- gest that to be proper commercial prac- tice. Businessmen strive with rivals, but norms and laws prevent them from bombing competitors, running them down with automobiles, or from getting customers with promises of free opium. Changing social norms concerning busi- ness are apparent in procedures to dampen the adverse effects on employees and communities of automation and plant shifts. The relative success of people-centered in contrast with process- centered supervision of employees and the preference for a boss who is a boss but who does not act like it reflect par- ticular social norms of business. A behavioral view of business action and attitudes is related to game-theory and organization-theory approaches. The normative circumstances in which business takes place influence the size and character of the pay-offs in the game and the number of strategies available to the players. Some people do not use dynamite to dispose of rivals because the sanctions or negative pay- offs with this course of action are so severe. With businessmen who have norms at the level of conscience, such strategies are not even included in their statement of the game matrix. Because of the psychological constraints laid on them by particular norms, executives do not even conceive of many strategies. Some may choose alternatives other than violence not because of conscience but because of the heavy sanctions of public disapproval and the hangman's noose! Thus the whole structure and 6</page><page sequence="7">ALTERNATIVE VIEWS OF BIG BUSINESS play of the business game in real life are influenced by the social environment in which it is played. Increasingly, busi- nessmen have an explicit awareness of this elementary but crucial point. Pur- suit of fairness and equity in the experi- mental games-and, in real life, bargain- ing between rivals-flows out of the social milieu in which the players have been programed, to use once more the computer language. It is clear, also, that many of the nonmonetary induce- ments to secure customers, employees, dealers, and suppliers in the coalition of large business enterprise reflect social norms of America concerning business practice. The behavioral model is sometimes addressed in terms of role theory. A role lays out for the individual-or for the organization, if it is possible to think of a role for big business in contem- porary culture-expected goals and ex- pected ways of achieving goals in the position or job which he occupies. In fact, it is in the specific prescriptions of a particular role that general social norms are focused and get their meaning. Social values and attitudes as vague as justice and equality are precise in the role requirements of ample notice to employees and communities before transfer to other cities, the "open door" policy of the executive suite, and the grievance procedures for disputes be- tween automobile dealers and the manu- facturers. The behavioral basis of business is illustrated both in studies by scholars and by episodes reported in the public press. The recent furor over steel pricing, the Katy railroad controversy in 1957, and the debate over the closure of a textile mill in Nashua, New Hamp- shire in 1948 demonstrate the impact of the social environment upon business. In a more scholarly setting, a sociologist has traced out in the steel-distribution industry the varying norms and motiva- tions of businessmen in established con- cerns and in the transient firms of the industry.4 Rensis Likert and his col- leagues at the University of Michigan have reported in many studies about the influence of American values upon man- agement practice.5 But what does all this mean con- cerning corporate or business goals? What does this framework suggest about ethics in business? It reminds us that, in some degree, the objectives and mo- tives of executives are social in origin. The goals and purposes of big business do not well up either out of instincts of altruism or out of monetary self- interest. They are framed by the social circumstances of business. Ethics in business do not rest altogether in the imaginations of public-relations advisers. A behavioral framework indicates that the value-laden concepts of ethics and social responsibility can be translated into the analytical concepts of sociology and social psychology. Nonprofit goals thus involve relatively little magic or mystery, for they reflect changing norms or a changing role prescription for the big-business executive. This model suggests, further, that the meaning of social responsibility is not given by businessmen alone. A com- munity or social consensus helps in- dicate what the goals and purposes of big business must be. Some critics of a "corporate-conscience philosophy" have characterized it as a twentieth-century laissez faire in which executives alone specify the content of such a conscience. A behavioral view indicates that a social consensus is involved in describing the goals and purposes of modern business. Of course, managers are not speechless 4 Louis Kriesberg, "Occupational Control Among Steel Distributors," American Journal of Sociology, Vol. 61 (November 1955), pp. 203-212. 5See, for example, Rensis Likert, New Patterns of Management (New York: Mc- Graw-Hill Book Company, 1961). 7</page><page sequence="8">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY in the dialogue and debate about the make-up of business purposes and goals, but they are hedged about and directed by this social consensus. Some com- panies and managers have learned this the hard way. In a competitive-market model, the firm is constrained by market forces; in a behavioral view, it is also limited by a social definition of the business role. We have here an analytical base for approaching the study of ethical busi- ness behavior, placing this vague notion under the scrutiny of analysis. The model hardly suggests, on the other hand, that, in contemporary America, profits, efficiency, and cost cutting are excluded from the purposes of big busi- ness. Indeed, in America, corporate executives and the enterprises which they co-ordinate are expected to pursue profit goals, efficiency, innovation, and cost minimization. These items are key elements in the pattern of American business. There are nonprofit aspects to the business role, but, in an enter- prise system, strong emphasis remains on pursuit of profits, economy with scarce resources, and watching the dollar. A behavioral model does not indicate that the executive has been made over in the image of Santa Claus. But, to complicate life for those who desire simple answers, this framework indicates that the modern executive is not styled after Scrooge or the robber baron of yesteryear. Decisions of sales, cost, price, capital budgeting, and employee relations are made within a social milieu which affects considerably the style and manner in which such decisions are made. To recognize this is not to make big business into Santa Claus nor is it to forget the basic function of business in American society. Another insight is available, em- phasizing the complexity of probing at business behavior and motivation. So- cial norms and roles are elaborated both in the community-at-large and in the small groups in which individuals par- ticipate. Often these sources of norms prescribe similar kinds of values and behavior, but, on occasion, the norms of small groups conflict with those of society. This is most obvious in a con- trast of the normative pressures of a juvenile gang or an organization of gangsters with those of society. It may be apparent also when the norms of labor unions or business trade associa- tions are measured by social goals and norms. Norms shaping big business thus come from society and from the particular industry and market settings in which companies operate. Often the norms from these sources coincide, but they may conflict. The relatively in- sulated atmosphere of a group of oligop- olists may develop norms and rules of the game more suited to the interests of the small group than to those of outside parties. Industry attitudes concerning price cutting, advertising, and innova- tion may vary from general norms on these matters. Thus, a behavioral view emphasizes that not all normative or "ethical" behavior will be that outlined by the general interest. SUMMARY With the organization-theory, game- theory, and behavioral models of this paper, an emphasis is upon a mixed package of motivations, purposes, and goals. The goals and membership of the large corporation are varied. Bargain- ing and conflict in real and experimental games goes on, but often within a fence of moral restraint and fairness. The norms and roles of big business include a conglomeration of profits, efficiency, democratic human relations, freedom, and justice. Big business is not cast in the simple molds of profit maximiza- tion or of pursuit of public welfare. An economist would be practically 8</page><page sequence="9">ALTERNATIVE VIEWS OF BIG BUSINESS derelict in his duty without pointing to the problems of conflict and com- plementarity which this mixture of goals and motivation creates for us all. Executives, other participants in enter- prise, and the total citizenry have the difficult task of choosing out of this mix- ture of business means and ends-when many of the choices have commingled in them gains and costs in terms of other purposes of big business. The task is made more serious with the awareness that, as these choices are made, there is simultaneous impact on the institutional fabric of the American economic order. Judging from the choices made thus far, these institutional changes will not take us to a twentieth-century version of laissez faire nor down the road to doctrinaire socialism. Americans have shown an awareness of the dangers of "suboptimization" in which marked suc- cess with one purpose or objective is purchased at the cost of nonfulfillment of other important goals. To hazard a guess on the future, Americans will con- tinue to fashion in their choices of what they want big business to be a mixed, pragmatic version of contem- porary capitalism. 9</page></plain_text>
