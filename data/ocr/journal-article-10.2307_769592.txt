<plain_text><page sequence="1">HERBERT LEADER HAWKINS 1887-1968 Elected F.R.S. 1937 HERBERT LEADER HAWKINS died in Reading on 29 December 1968, having lived and worked there all his life. Spatially, he travelled little prior to visiting the West Indies in his retirement. Intellectually, he was a noted voyageur. Adventurous of mind, kindly, young in heart, vividly imaginative and telling a superb tale, he radiated a genuinely joyful dedication to geology. Outwardly, this inner liveliness beamed through a merry twinkle of eye and ready humour-robust or ribald, sensitive or elegant according to the occasion, which he seldom mistimed or misjudged. A consummate actor on life's stage, he was for ever transmitting a message or moral. Its essence was, I think, that the materials of scientific enquiry should be loved as well as enjoyed, that feed-back from scientific endeavour to the individual and community mattered pre-eminently; that somewhere behind it all there was a meaning. With him, generations learned to question, as well as respect, things held sacred. Physically and sartorially Hawkins was the epitome of a contemporary geologist: nimble of gait, wiry, walrus-moustached, unfashionably long- haired, brown-booted and attired in brown tweed hat, jacket and baggy trousers. In thirty years, whatever the function, I saw him dressed otherwise only once. He was working at the laboratory bench in white tie and tails, donned before breakfast. Not a countryman, he was some townmen's idea of one, loving and exuding the kindlier aspects of the countryside. He was determined, and could be obstinate. Troubled by arthritis when a young man, he abandoned doctors' advice, bought a bike and, in his own words, "ground down the offending crystals" through months of ensuing agony. That said, it is not easy to infer what motivated Hawkins. Loved by many, he was known to few. Ambition was not a driving force, for he never sought advancement or power or prestige; and he rejected the second. He was honoured by many: by the devoted amateur, the privileged, the humble, the eminent. Recognition and adulation he unashamedly enjoyed, though curiously surprised by them. Such events came to him, not he to them; quietly, he did what he wanted to do. What determined his choices of research, his changes of direction or preoccupation, was often unclear. The original work he did was not always that which most needed doing, nor was it always that for which he was best suited. Rather, it seemed, he was 815 21</page><page sequence="2">* - -</page><page sequence="3">Biographical Memoirs motivated by affection for the materials themselves: for the beauty of a sea- urchin, love of a stretch of countryside like the Vale of Kingsclere. His Quaker upbringing influenced him all his long life. Respecting sincere beliefs and disbeliefs of many kinds, he never wore his own faith on his lapel. Indeed, he tilted at the "arrogance of faith, deeming to know all the answers". Born in Reading on 1 June 1887, Hawkins attended Reading School and Kendal Grammar School. At the age of fifteen he was deeply influenced by attending a Geologists' Association field excursion to Reading and meeting William Whitaker there. In 1905 he won, from Kendal, a classical scholar- ship to Manchester University. Throughout his life he enjoyed reading classical literature in the original. But at Manchester he established a precedent by transferring to geology. Under Professor W. Boyd Dawkins most of the instruction was carried out by B. Hobson, a dedicated teacher. Hawkins recalled meeting his professor only three times. On the second and third occasions he had to be re-introduced. Each led to a 'week-end' invitation, one to conger-fishing off Peel, the other to see a reservoir sited by Dawkins which was "leaking like a sieve". In later years Hawkins, similarly unable to remember people's names, developed ingenious ways of discovering them without asking the direct question. Hobson's demonstrator at Manchester was H. G. A. Hickling, with whom Hawkins became a lifelong friend. Another friendship forged in those days was with D. M. S. Watson, then researching in the neighbouring Zoology Department. (Thirty years later, Watson's daughter Janet studied under Hawkins.) The intellectual world of these three young men must have been primarily a palaeontological-stratigraphical one, sustained by the momentum of evolutionary theory perhaps enlivened by the contemporary rise of genetics. 'Missing links' were very much the fashion, and hunting for them a major preoccupation. PALAEONTOLOGICAL RESEARCH Significant in Hawkins's development were the Manchester degree examinations of 1908. The external examiner in geology was Dr F. A. Bather of the British Museum, a leading echinoderm specialist. As the only candidate, Hawkins was treated to a long and warmly personal viva concerned mainly with new and puzzling echinoderm material from the Ordovician of Girvan, which Bather had brought with him. Hawkins emerged with a First, the first Mark Stirrup Palaeontological Scholarship, and much encouragement towards fossil Echinodermata. Two years' research on this group led to the Manchester M.Sc. in 1910. The title of his thesis is unknown, but it may have been that of his first paper (1909), reporting the discovery of a jaw apparatus in Discoidea cylindrica. Further work on these lines concerned Conulus, but modern cleaning techniques now show that the young palaeontologist was unlucky enough to have been misled by a 'doctored' specimen with teeth inserted from a living species. 316</page><page sequence="4">Herbert Leader Hawkins Fired by evolutionary concepts, Hawkins vigorously joined the search for morphological series capable of being interpreted as evolutionary lineages. Appointed Acting Lecturer in Geology (part-time) at University College Reading during January 1909 while still a Manchester research student, he was apparently made a full-time Lecturer the following October. Over the next twenty years he found scope for carrying out single-handed much important research on the echinoids. The Echinoidea had long attracted palaeontologists through their beauty, complexity and, according to some, key position in the invertebrate- chordate transition. Hawkins, using new techniques (etching, dyeing, optical), unusual powers of observation and a surgeon's dissecting skill, went further. He was interested in the whole animal and the animal's view of the world, and he planted some of the seeds of what is now palaeoecology. But time and the geobiological climate were not right. The need for more precise morphology, combined with universal emphases on evolution and 'species mongering', drowned his quiet reminders that fossils were once living creatures with fascinating problems of their own. Persistently, he concentrated on fundamental palaeontology and never succumbed to the taxonomic excesses of the day. Hawkins was soon captivated by the Holectypoida. These, the least irregular of the 'irregular echinoids', show stages in the migration of the periproct from the margin of the disk, via the posterior interambulacrum, to well below the ambitus. Hawkins thus became intensely preoccupied with the evolution of irregular from regular echinoids. He was particularly fascinated by the restoration of the apical disk after the periproct had left it. The year 1912 saw his first lengthy publication on the morphology, evolution and classification of the Holectypoida. During 1917-1922 no less than thirteen studies appeared, treating various members of the order and their allies. Discoidea still interested him (1917), for not only was its replaced fifth genital plate in the apical disk imperforate, but its internal buttresses seemed to anticipate Clypeaster. Publication of a Philosophical Transactions paper in 1919 was the high-water mark of his palaeontological career. Sadly, it was also a culmination. Concerned with the evolution of the holectypoid ambulacrum, Hawkins introduced a new order of accuracy into the description of fossil echinoids. His plating diagrams and lucid explanation of 'plate crushing' were widely influential. The paper helped to revive interest in plating structure, and is still a classic of penetration and presenta- tion. Hawkins's publications during this period were beautifully written and (as always) artistically illustrated by his own hand. Basic English, stencils, draughtsmen and photographers were not for him. Each composition echoes his oral eloquence and his ability to weave an interesting story out of the most humdrum data. Hence his work was quickly absorbed into general biological knowledge, sometimes when better examples were passed over. Lessons can be learned today by re-reading such monographs as those on the 317</page><page sequence="5">Biographical Memoirs fossil Holectypoida. Together, they comprised a substantial contribution to science and formed the supporting matter for his D.Sc. Manchester, which was awarded in 1920 (main thesis: 'The morphology and evolution of the ambulacrum in the Echinoidea Holectypoida'). Their impact on contem- porary palaeontology was summarized in 1921 by the President of the Geological Society of London (R. D. Oldham) who, when presenting Hawking with a moiety of the Lyell Fund, said: "These papers, illustrated by exact and beautifully clear drawings from your own pen, have been charac- terized by keenness of observation, based on manipulative skill, by originality of method combined with attention to the work of previous authors, and by a breadth of view which enabled you to coordinate the facts under definite hypotheses." On the taxonomic side, Hawkins described Mesozoic and younger echi- noids from Nigeria (1912), Australia (1916), Persia (1922), Jamaica (1923, 1924, 1927), Fiji (1934) and Somaliland (1935). He did significant work on Palaeozoic echinoderms, reporting the first British occurrences of Hyattechinus and Lepidocidaris (1935) and describing the remarkable Carboniferous Cravenechinus (1946). In collaboration with Miss S. M. Hampton he produced the first satisfactory reconstructions of the distorted flexible Echinocystis and Paleodiscus (1927). The specimens were excavated from the Silurian of Leintwardine in a small-scale quarrying operation. Hawkins was a staunch defender of the echinoid nature of the enigmatic Bothriocidaris. Recent opinion tends towards his view. By the early 1920s Hawkins had seemed poised for a major work on the whole Echinoidea, fossil and living. But it was not to be. Many influences conspired to thwart him. In 1920 he was elected Professor of Geology at Reading and became more affected by the problems of a rapidly-growing Department and thrusting University College. His liking for field research and field teaching mounted and he took on more external responsibilities. Thus he became a notable leader of excursions for the Geologists' Association and the Reading Natural History Society. He had an extraordinary ability to whip up and maintain enthusiasms in the worst conditions and dullest terrain. Concurrently, his geological interests broadened and the philo- sophical aspects of geology took up more of his time and devotion. By the 1930s Hawkins had become intensely interested in Reading's local geology. Combined with the increasing output of echinoid research by palaeontologists and zoologists and a disinclination to sit indoors doing bibliographical work, this resulted in the hoped-for magnum opus slipping from his grasp. World War II sealed its fate, and the museum showcases housing his 'card-index' of foolscape strips were quietly cleared. Hawkins's real echinoid swan-song was delivered in 1934, with the publication of an important monograph in the Philosophical Transactions on the lantern and girdle. The presidential address to the Geological Society of London in 1943 was essentially an expansion of much that had already been stated briefly in his textbook (Invertebrate palaeontology) 23 years before. Partly a didactic 318</page><page sequence="6">Herbert Leader Hawkins lecture on echinoid structure, it embodied a personal expression of faith in particular aspects of evolutionary theory. Looking back over Hawkins's career, Mr R. V. Melville (Chief Palaeon- tologist, Institute of Geological Sciences) writes: "He never thought of himself as a taxonomist, although his descrip- tions of new and known species of echinoids are models of completeness and scholarly attention to previous work. The classification of echinoids current in his active days was too weak in its phylogenetic basis to satisfy him. He therefore turned his attention to a study of the evolution- ary changes in each of the main structural components of the echinoid skeleton, and in this he succeeded triumphantly. He believed that a thorough understanding of these changes was an indispensable preliminary to a phylogenetic classification, but he was content to leave the construction of such a classification to others. Thus, even if Th. Mortensen had not written his massive Monograph of the Echinoidea (Copenhagen, 1928-1951), it is doubtful whether Hawkins would have provided a substitute. Nevertheless his approach to an understanding of the echinoids, which in a sense embodied unconsciously the concept of mosaic evolution, supplanted for all time the iconographic methods of most of his predecessors and had a profound influence on the compilers of the volumes of the Treatise of invertebrate palaeontology dealing with the Echinoidea (University of Kansas Press, 1961). It is for thus giving a new depth and orientation to taxonomic study in this group that he will be longest remembered." STRATIGRAPHY AND MAPPING Hawkins's interest in local geology was rekindled in the late 1920s by his growing affection for the beautiful Vale of Kingsclere and its structure, with which he had long wrestled. Fanned by D'Arcy Exploration's deep boring, which tested his predictions (1937-1938), and inflamed by the Metropolitan Water Board's programme for a projected reservoir in the Enborne Valley (1947-1952), it became an intense preoccupation. His mapping and structural analysis of the northern limb of the Kings- clere pericline (reported 1939) record continued physical vigour, immense liking for meticulous detail and deep pleasure in combining all kinds of field-evidence. So many auger-heads broke beneath his dexterous twist that he frequently spoke of "sowing dragons' teeth". In 1942 he summarized his reflections on the geological history of southern England. His work on the Chalk and Lower Tertiaries (1955) was useful, but chiefly of local interest. The Enborne Valley work also contributed to knowledge of Pleistocene permafrost behaviour (reported in 1953). During this period he spent many hours drafting and copying maps, using his characteristic 'dotting' tech- nique; and shaping cubes and other crystal forms out of lumps of chalk. Geological friends up and down the country were puzzled. On the one hand, there was a man evidently enjoying himself, working on a job that 319</page><page sequence="7">320 Biographical Memoirs (as he modestly said) "any fool could do". On the other, there was a man wasting his palaeontological talent. Years later, it transpired that his consulting fees had been paid into a special account of the Reading Geology Department. PHILOSOPHICAL ASPECTS OF GEOLOGY Another preoccupation, becoming more insistent in the 1920s as his palaeontological activity declined, was the conviction that palaeontology had something worthwhile to say in the human field. Always fond of debate, he wrote as beautifully as he spoke. Whatever the reader's generation or views, his scientific and non-scientific writings seldom fail to charm. Typical was 'In defence of Bothriocidaris' (1929), a lethal yet courteous dismemberment of an opponent conducted in the best tradition of gentlemanly Victorian debate. His argument with C. T. Trechmann (1923, 1924), over the age of certain limestones in Jamaica, is on both sides a model of good manners in scientific controversy. Hawkins was a superb speaker. Bred in the Quaker tradition, he had a beautifully modulated voice and an actor's instinctive timing (he once wrote a play for Jantaculum). His discourses were judicious blends of drama, parable, analogy and metaphor. Being more in the nature of teleological sermons than lectures, they nearly always had a 'moral'. He enjoyed analogy and this invaded and abetted his growing tendency to philosophize. Early intimations are seen in his graceful article, 'The charm of Palaeontology', published in 1913. Later, between the wars, his maturing reflections on life and humanity began to appear in print. Those of a palaeontological nature, such as 'Crises in evolution' (1927) and 'Which matters most, heredity or environment?' (1933), made little impact on geology or biology. Owing perhaps to a lack of formal zoological training, Hawkins had not kept abreast of developments in evolutionary theory, genetics and ecology. His insistence on 'orthogenesis' as a process in itself (rather than a description) became increasingly unacceptable. But his reflections on Man in the time-continuum of geology were more effective, even ruffling some academics' self-deception during those euphoric pre-war years. Beginning locally, his message spread further afield. 'A palaeontologist looks at life', his presidential address to the Cotteswold Naturalists' Field Club, was printed in 1930. Achieving a national forum in 1936, he spoke to Section C of the British Association on 'Palaeontology and humanity' and evoked editorial comment in Nature. Two years later, his superb Alexander Pedler Lecture, 'Humanity in geological perspective', was also published by the British Association. It had earlier been acclaimed by the South-Eastern Union of Scientific Societies, and was widely read. The ripple of interest spread overseas and the Smithsonian Institute reprinted the lecture in full in its Report for 1939. Hawkins had a vision of what was coming from war and war's long-term aftermath. These lectures represented his personal intervention. He spoke as</page><page sequence="8">Herbert Leader Hawkins 321 non-violent prophet and intellectual, appealing for reason through a long- range view of Man's environment, internal and external. Hawkins saw in the palaeontological life-curves of extinct creatures direly possible fates of Man. He could also envisage salvation (or immortality) through the "biologically new qualities of love and compassion. Intelligence by itself", he urged, "merely leads to quicker (though cleverer) ways to perdition than other animals have invented." During those bewildering years, Hawkins's compelling oratory and felicitous prose should have generated more thought than they did. When war came his response was quick and vigorous, like that of so many academics. Appointed Geological Adviser to Civil Defence Area VI in 1939, he initiated a rapid survey of sand and gravel resources, for sandbags and so on. Through the ensuing years he never spared himself, though in his middle fifties. The abortive campaign over the Taplow Chalk phosphate is well known. Tougher jobs, such as air-raid wardening, are matters of local history. Wardening gave ample scope for his morale-boosting humour. Many an A.R.P. post was enlivened by his stream of anecdotes: hilarious, impossible, or ridiculous, but every so often interlarded with subtle reminders of what really mattered. Those were occasions when the twinkle in his eye turned to a glitter. At no time in his long life would Hawkins condone the cheap or the wanton, the fake or the cruel. I saw him lose his temper only twice-once over the mindless (but youthful) use of a shot-gun during a field class. He fervently believed in the sanctity of life, and loathed the destruction resulting from "man's smart-alecness and arrogance" UNIVERSITY TEACHING AND ADMINISTRATION Hawkins's part-time appointment at Reading in 1909 arose from an emergency created by two students wishing to take the London Intermediate Examination in Geology. For a time he 'commuted' between Manchester and Reading, spending four days a week researching in one and one day teaching in the other. He claimed to have travelled between the two towns by every possible route, including the Severn tunnel. When given a full-time post at Reading, he first had a room in the Zoology Department and taught everything there, from 'external London' to agricultural service courses, until joined by A. R. Dwerryhouse in 1921. The breadth of this teaching accounted for Hawkins's extraordinary erudition in all fields of geology. Thirty years later, more specialized colleagues were still seeking his advice over their work. A recalcitrant mineral in thin section? "Let's try it on the Prof." Moustaches adjusted, hands behind back ("Only a fool crosses his nicols"), Hawkins looked down the microscope and, in due time, pronounced "Try allophane". It was. By 1920 his reputation as a teacher, researcher and man who got things done led to his appointment as Professor of Geology. This was significant, because lack of money severely limited the number of</page><page sequence="9">Biographical Memoirs senior posts in the University College, and departments often had to make do with a 'Lecturer in Charge'. Over the next decade Hawkins established the broad and deep foundations on which, in the '30s, the Geology Department began to boom. For long inconveniently split between several parts of the London Road campus, it nevertheless acquired the necessary materials, books, apparatus and traditions which (as later institutions have sadly found) do not appear in a night. Delicious stories abound of how Hawkins "acquired, annexed or just stole" (his words) the rich collections of teaching and research materials, rare books, maps and reprints that the Department inherits today. He had an indefinable (and unconscious) quality that made people want to give him things and do things for him. The early and unusual William Smith map of 1815? "Oh, a woman came in from Slough and left it on the table." The Bours Collection of Tertiary fossils from classic sites in the Paris basin (now built over) was sent by a Frenchman inspired by the Entente Cordiale. Part of the second Beccles Collection (with Lyell's specimens of rainprints from the Bay of Fundy presented to Mantell) was bought from the Salvation Army, and the great Bradley Collection "just fell into my lap". Greenough's map (perhaps the finest extant) and memoir cost the Department a few pounds, Lhuyd's Lithophylacii Britannici ichnographia sixpence, and others such as Dr. Syntax and Murchison's Silurian System (first editions) nothing at all. For many there is no known history. How, for example, did Hawkins come to possess Phillips's copy of the Geology of rorkshire presented to William Smith (his uncle) complete with dedicatory letter ? One story must be told more fully. In May 1929 Miss S. R. Courtauld, a lifelong acquaintance of Hawkins, was ill in bed and asked him to visit her. Following the usual courtly exchanges he was taking his leave when Miss Courtauld called him back from the doorway and requested him to take from the dressing table a "small piece of paper to help build a temple for your beautiful fossils". The fossils were Hawkins's exquisite dissections with which he had often delighted her. Miss Courtauld had recently been impressed by two brachiopods, so painstakingly freed from their matrices with brush and needle that the long delicate spines stood clear (Acanthothiris) and the hinge articulated (Cyclothyris). The 'piece of paper' was a ?6000 cheque. Later, she made other donations of ?3000 for the 'temple' and ?2000 for equipment. Hawkins's charming and efficient pavilion, embellished like others in those days by the gardeners' art, lasted until 1966. It still stands, inherited by the Microbiology Department. In the 1930s it was peopled by a lecturer, a demonstrator and students whose enthusiasm created a highly stimulating environment. With a first-year class of 30, and General and Special classes following after that, it was substantial for the times. Hawkinsian instinct and vice-chancellorial perspicacity (T. F. Sibly was himself a geologist) led to the appointments of L. R. Wager for petrology and mineralogy (1929) and Miss P. S. Walder (a former Reading student) for demonstrating and 322</page><page sequence="10">Herbert Leader Hawkins sedimentary petrology (1930). Wager's most important work (Skaargard, Everest) was done while at Reading, and owed much to Hawkins's support and understanding. Thus Hawkins laid the foundations of Departmental repute in major fields other than his own. After the Second World War he engineered a notable advance in the undergraduate teaching programme by establishing geophysics as a major part of the Special syllabus. Twenty years later this development budded off a separate degree course in solid-earth geophysics. As a teacher of the young and of the "young in heart" (his phrase for the amateur) Hawkins excelled. He had a superb ability for winning over uncommitted students intent on reading other subjects. This accounted for the steady recruitment into the more advanced classes during those lean years. Some of his conversions would have been embarrassing today, for Hawkins did not discriminate. A dedicated convert with fervour but little ability was as welcome to geology as any other. Devotion to the subject, educative development of the whole man, were the things that mattered in those days. At any time he would stop what he was doing to help the serious student or the amateur, however trivial the request. No schoolboy ever brought the dullest flint in vain. Rather he went away inspired by it, or by Hawkins's intensely personal view thereof. Many a time-waster (as one has heard them called by others) subsequently contributed to science in his own right. Others merely led richer lives. Was that not, as Hawkins said, his main job of work? Happiest in the field, Hawkins spared no pains in the most unpromising terrain. Around Reading there were no 'gravel deserts' for him; only rivers mercilessly competing among themselves, hunters making do with berries and roots, lowering skies over the ice-fields beyond Oxford, sometimes perhaps as close as Goring? In formal lectures and on field classes Hawkins had, as Professor F. Hodson (one of his students) said, "a profound ability to reduce the funda- mentals of a subject to a few graphic words". Many will recall his reduction of the structural pattern of Britain to a herring bone "with" (as Hodson writes): "the spine stretching from the Shetlands to the western Mendips, the ribs displaying a Caledonoid trend to the west and a Charnian pattern to the east." Professor P. C. Sylvester-Bradley (another student) recalls that: "His ability was to fire the imagination, and it was especially in the first year and in the field that he was so successful." Mr R. V. Melville remembers fellow-students of widely diverse future careers lovingly reciting once-heard but unforgettable passages from Hawkins's lectures. Professor E. A. Vincent and I, freshers straight from school in October 1936, were initiated into the mysteries of global petrology with: "Would you assume, from pus in a boil on your skin, that your insides were made of the same material?" In November, sedimentary petrology was equally arresting: "The Burning Cliff at Ringstead burns only in the rain. This is because the water gets at the sulphide of iron, forming sulphuric acid and green vitriol; and the heat 323</page><page sequence="11">324 Biographical Memoirs produced, going beyond the flashpoint of the oil, lights it." Thermodynamic analogies had no dangers: "Perfection is death. Nothing happens." Hawkins's lectures to more advanced classes and his role as a research supervisor were not so successful. Having in principle planted the seeds of scepticism and free discussion, he was not adept at tending the delicate growths. Basically, his habits of oral argument through analogy, hyperbole, over-simplification, teleology and anthropomorphism, his defence by rhetoric, and his authoritative approach through the 'sermon', failed. Except for the occasional use of an out-dated table of strata Hawkins never used notes. Advanced classes hungry for up-to-date news, views (with references) and injections of basic science felt they never really got them. Belonging to an older academic tradition, Hawkins was more concerned to preach human wisdom through geology than to produce students with a vocational title to a career in the subject such as the time demanded. Field-classes were largely field demonstrations amplified by beautiful hand-drawn large-scale maps prepared by Hawkins before the party left Reading. Junior members of the staff assisted in these classes, which were largely run by 'the Prof.' himself. It was not until 1938 that Wager, of Greenland and Everest, was permitted to lead his own field 'expedition' [sic] to Arran. Some colleagues were able to loosen Hawkins up and evoke the superb best in him. One was Dr Gilbert Wilson of Imperial College, who deputized for Wager during his absence on Everest (1933) and in Green- land (1935-1936). During the second period Wilson introduced the students to the principles of field mapping in the area around Osmington Mills. Equally matched in oratorical and dramatic skills, the two friends staged many a field 'performance' which, besides being a riot, had high teaching value. Wilson with his gusto and sketch-pad, Hawkins with his fiery imagi- nation and eloquent persuasion, were complementary. Some field days and evening discourses were topped off by Hawkins's accomplished playing on the piano. Administratively, Hawkins's activity was extremely simple, or nil. In the Geology Department he mostly relied on others, not by delegation but through their own intervention. Outside, he was no advocate for geology and seldom intervened in Senate or Faculty Board discussions. Yet, as always, buildings, equipment, money, fell into his lap. Colleagues, like public benefactors, seemed unable to resist his appearance of simple uncompetitive helplessness. During 1936-1940 he was Dean of the Science Faculty. Induction of 'freshers' to their courses and tutors was by eight words neatly pencilled on strips of foolscap four lines deep, torn off as each student knocked at his door. Between visits he entered up the eight words on another sheet and returned to complete absorption in the work he was doing. Periodically, over the years his laboratory-office became so full (he was an avid collector) that he could only hang his hat in it each morning and then work in the teaching laboratories. These were times when his colleagues had forcibly to 'clean him out'.</page><page sequence="12">Herbert Leader Hawkins APPLIED GEOLOGY Knowledge was for its own sake; but could be useful within carefully chosen limits. Many a small farmer, builder and site engineer had reason to bless Hawkins's advice, freely given. "Payment in pure knowledge" was more than enough. But when money could not be avoided (as with the Metro- politan Water Board) it was accepted-and passed secretly to the Geology Department. Subtle means were then in order for squeezing the last drop of pure knowledge out of the project. Had not some of the Enborne bores been deepened (slightly but unnecessarily) how much should we have known about the real 'inside-the-hill' geology of the Enborne Valley? Decalcifica- tion hides much from "the field-surveyor with his trowel and auger". Hawkins was made a consulting geologist to the Thames Valley Water Board in 1961. He was always deeply concerned over the need for a national water policy. Gaily campaigning against the rising frequency of "bath taking" he repeatedly averred the necessity for "preserving the skin's natural oils". At nearly eighty, he spoke out strongly in person and on television against the proposal to "top up the Thames" periodically from underground sources, and wrote last on water supplies (1965). HONOURS Hawkins received wide recognition in his lifetime. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1937 (and chaired round the cloisters by his students), received the Foulerton Award of the Geologists' Association in 1936, a moiety of the Lyell Fund of the Geological Society of London in 1921 and their Lyell Medal in 1940, made President of that Society from 1941 to 1943, President of the Palaeontographical Society from 1943 to 1965, President of the Geologists' Association from 1938 to 1940 and an Honorary Member of the latter from 1949. He retired from the Chair of Geology at Reading in 1952 and was made Professor Emeritus. His eightieth birthday was cele- brated with a special issue of the Proceedings of the Geologists' Association (1967, 78, 1-240) comprising articles written by former students and associates. More modest compliments thrilled him just as much, particularly his presi- dentships of the Cotteswold Naturalists' Field Club (1929-1931), South- Eastern Union of Scientific Societies (1934, 1958) and Section C of the British Association (1936). For fourteen years after his retirement he remained president of the students' Geology Club and delivered an annual address. Hawkins was married twice. In 1912 he married Amy Mitchell and they had two sons and a daughter. One son became an oil geologist after taking a degree under his father, and subsequently went on the stage. Following the death of his first wife (1953) Hawkins married, in 1955, Sibyl Marion Hampton (co-author of the 1927 paper) who survives him. From meticulous pre-occupation with specialized palaeontology Hawkins emerged to paint a broad canvas at a time when this was unfashionable. He 325</page><page sequence="13">326 Biographical Memoirs hoped for a new 'Theory of the Earth', but did not live to see it. His era was one of increasing factual indigestion between simplifying theories. Yet his lectures during ths '30s foreshadowed much. More than most, he saw the grandeur and beauty of the earth, and enriched people's lives with the personal thrill of it. His vision of the biological world, seen at the height of his creative powers in 1920 (Invertebrate palaeontology, p. 212), reflects much of what he thought and felt and was: 'It is perhaps perilously hypothetical, but at least in accord with present knowledge, to suggest that the course of evolution can be likened to a flowing tide. One wave after another rears its crest and falls in ruin-each one rushes up the beach, only to slip back, and yield place to another which may sweep farther or fall short. Amid the welter of advance and retreat-the roar of the oncoming breaker and the hiss of its shattered recoil-it is hard to see that any lasting progress is achieved. But behind the seeming futility of each foredoomed effort, steadily and invincibly the tide is coming in.' The photographs are Mr R. A. Barker and Mr J. L. Watkins. P. ALLEN BIBLIOGRAPHY 1909.
