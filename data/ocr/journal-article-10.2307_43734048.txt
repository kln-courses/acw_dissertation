<plain_text><page sequence="1">Weaving cultural identities on trans- Asiatic networks: Upper Thai-Malay Peninsula - an early socio-political landscape 1 Bérénice Bellina-Pryce2 &amp; Praon Silapanth3 Issues The motivations and mechanisms of increasing social complexity and cultural exchange are major issues of anthropological and archaeological research. Because the origins of complex societies comprise multiple facets, these topics have been approached via an array of specific inquiries into ecology, exchange, economic or political organisation, etc. In Southeast Asia, more than a century of endeavour has been put into interpreting historical sources to address state formation, and the often concomitant issue of urbanism. These issues have generally been included within the broad scenario of "Indianisation", a long-lasting socio-economic exchange process that resulted in shared cultural features between certain South Asian and Southeast Asian societies. Researchers commonly consider the emergence of fully fledged 'Indianised Southeast Asian states' from the mid-first millennium AD as the strongest, and at the same time earliest, evidence of this process. There has been a preponderance 1. We wish to express our sincere gratitude to the following scholars who have contributed valuable insights on Khao Sam Kaeo artefacts and/or this text.

During the last three decades, research on insular and peninsular early Indianised maritime polities has flourished, fuelled by new insights provided by excavations. These include Funan at Oc Eo and Angkor Borei in the Mekong delta (Manguin 2004, Stark 2003, Stark et al. 1999), Go Cam, a site of the polity of Linyi and Tra Kieu, the ancient capital of Champa in Central Vietnam (Glover &amp; Yamagata 1995; Nguyen Kim Dung et al. 2006; Yamagata 2007), Tarumanagara and Batujaya in West Java (Manguin &amp; Agustijanto 2006), Srivijaya in Sumatra (Manguin 1993; 2002), and Kota Kapur on the Bangka Island (Lucas et al. 1998). Considered to have been an active relay in the cultural process (Jacq-Hergoualc'h 1990: 77; O'Connor 1972: 39-40) and to have yielded some of the earliest evidence most commonly agreed upon, Thai- Malay Peninsula historical polities have benefitted from comparatively plentiful and vigorous research, such as those in the regions of Chaiya (the ancient Panpan), Nakhon Si Thammarat (the ancient Tambralinga ), Pattani (the ancient Langkasuka), Satingpra and Kedah amongts others (for most recent ones see Allen 1990; 1991; 1997; Jacq-Hergoualc'h 2002; Stargardt 1983) (Figure 1). Figure 1: Map of archaeological sites on the Thai-Malay Peninsula (G.M)</page><page sequence="3">Weaving cultural identities on trans-Asiatic networks 259 This historically and economically-oriented research has left two major aspects of the cultural process under-investigated. - The first one resulting from a lack of proper investigation, is the socio- political structures of late prehistoric Southeast Asian settlements, which remain poorly defined. This weakness seriously restrains any attempt to comprehend the development of late prehistoric societies into fully-fledged Indianised historical polities and cities. Addressing cultural change, here in the frame of trans-Asiatic exchange, requires us to first characterise the specific natures of indigenous societies that made them welcome certain changes in response to foreign interactions (Renfrew 1 982: 6). A combination of factors can be suggested to explain the paucity of data on late prehistoric societies. Firstly, it could be due to a lack of awareness of newly developed methods for analysing the apparently mute late prehistoric material culture. These products, both landscapes and artefacts, are mainly characterised by the absence of major monumental works (e.g. temples), and a similar dearth of statues and aesthetically valued ceramics. Secondly, as a corollary to the first reason, the absence of monuments, and the tendency of early archaeologists to record only (imported and familiar) statuary and aesthetically valued artefacts, while ignoring local (unfamiliar) elements that might also reflect socio-political advances, has historically led to a trend of considering the late prehistoric period as insignificant for understanding the processes of development. Consequently, when excavating sites thought to relate to textually-attested historical polities, full attention to the preceding late prehistoric occupation has not always been forthcoming, with the result that the prehistoric part of the sequence is regarded as a muted prelude, to be overshadowed by the magnificence yet to come. Thirdly, the lack of data for late prehistoric social structures can be explained in part by a preference for the excavation of burial sites (Stark 2006); sites that sometimes yield "spectacular" artefacts such as gold, glass and hard stone ornaments. To our knowledge, with the exception of Co Loa in northern Vietnam which is considered to have been established in the 3rd c. BC (Wheatley 1983: 91-4), few actual prehistoric settlements of the early centuries AD have been investigated outside Northeastern Thailand (at Noen U-Loke, Higham 2004: 63; O'Reilly 2000) and Cambodia (Mimotian sites in the south-eastern provinces, neighbouring Vietnam, Albrecht et al, 2000). Consequently, the following issues need to be fully addressed: 1 . What was the nature, dimension and environment of late prehistoric settlements, and how were they selected and modified? 2. What was the internal organisation of the site? Were there social (ethnic/ hierarchical) or professional quarters, and if so, how did they interconnect? 3. Externally, how were these sites integrated within regional and inter-regional networks, and what was the nature of these relations (domination versus egalitarian, dependent versus self-sufficient, etc)? - The second under-investigated aspect are socio-technical systems. The low interest in these stems from the functionalist perspective traditionally employed by historians and archaeologists which usually equates a product's significance with its use. So far, in Southeast Asia, exchange products have merely been interpreted in terms of commercial goods and/or political currencies. As an example of the latter, Junker suggested that rulers of early coastal Philippine polities controlled goods and their production as a means to direct interpolity exchange (Junker 1994; 2002).</page><page sequence="4">260 Bérénice Bellina-Pryce &amp; Praon Silapanth This view follows from the idea that rulers of maritime Southeast Asian polities constantly needed to cement networks of loyalties (Wolters 1999), both external ones composed of different hierarchical networks between similarly complex and developed socio-political systems, and internal, hierarchical networks that included the less complex inland groups who provide the raw materials and goods needed for export (Bronson 1977; Christie 1990; Junker 1994, 2002; Manguin 2000). As in many other regions, craft industries have mainly been approached with physico- chemical analyses. Ideally intending to trace routes or indirect contacts between regions, these composition-focused types of studies have too often been conducted alone, resulting in a narrow view of craft items as simply exchanged items and thus neglecting their human and social layout. Indeed, the social information contained in artefacts has not been adequately considered in Southeast Asia; their materiality represents both conscious and unconscious expressions of values and beliefs specific to social groups, as evidenced in the technological choices made during manufacture and use (Costin 2001; Gosselain 2000; Hodder 1986; Lemonnier 1983, 1992; Wobst 1977). It is now widely acknowledged that craftspersons play an active part in fashioning their worlds, producing and reproducing social and cultural forms (Schortman &amp; Urban 2004). In a Southeast Asian context, only recently has the craftperson's role been recognised in the socio-political developments that took place in the frame of South and Southeast Asian exchange (Bellina 2003, 2007). Investigating socio-technical systems as a means of characterising socio-political development is a line of research which has proliferated over the last two decades. In Asia, this approach has been used for Harappan cities (Roux et al. 2000; Vīdāle 1 989; Tosi 1984), the Vijayanagar Empire (Sinopoli &amp; Morisson 1995), Northern China (Underhill 1996), and the Pacific (Earle 1987). In comparison, the articulation of social and political developments, and the organisation of production have been addressed in Southeast Asia by only a few researchers, including the following: Bellina (2003, 2005, 2007); Bronson (1992); Junker (1990, 1993, 1994, 2002); and, with a different perspective rejecting the idea of hierarchy, White (1995); White &amp; Pigott (1996). Socio-technical systems are embedded within multiple cultural domains (social, political, economic, ritual and ideational), and are therefore as much the product of social and political phenomenon as they are a causal factor. In fashioning their tangible world, social groups produce, use and exchange material culture that expresses and promotes their specific affiliations and interactions (Costin 2001; Schortman 2004). Addressing how culturally meaningful objects and their production systems interplay with the concentration of power and social differentiation is yet to be understood in Southeast Asian contexts. The requisite first steps are to examine the organisation of production, distribution and consumption in different craft industries and investigate how they correlate with the other evidence for political and social differentiation in spatial settings through time. The Khao Sam Kaeo Archaeological Mission's questions This archaeological programme aims to reconstitute the early phases of a technical, economic, and cultural exchange process that extended over more than twenty-five centuries, and participated in shaping South and Southeast Asian cultural identities.</page><page sequence="5">Weaving cultural identities on trans-Asiatic networks 261 To that end, the archaeological programme here presented intends to define the sequence of early socio-cultural developments on the Thai-Malay Peninsula, a region taken as pivotal in trans- Asiatic exchanges, with a focus on the interplay of complex societies' productions involved in these exchanges. Here, we specifically refer to the "productions" of anthropomorphic landscapes and socio-technical systems. Our approach is intended to evaluate how trans- Asiatic exchanges affected the political, economic and social landscape of the Peninsula, and concurrently to ascertain more precisely what role the peninsular region played in these exchanges. To address these issues, the archaeological programme investigates the site of Khao Sam Kaeo, a late prehistoric settlement and production centre of the Upper Thai-Malay Peninsula, the earliest known site in the area to have been involved in the trans-Asiatic exchange. The Khao Sam Kaeo Archaeological Mission's programme This introductory paper reviews the main physical factors contributing to the patterning of settlements and networks in the Thai-Malay Peninsula and summarises what is currently known for the late prehistoric period. Next, it discusses some of Khao Sam Kaeo's peculiarities that make it an especially relevant site to address the issues raised above. We then introduce the main objectives and methods for research at the site, as well as the specialist studies involved in this multi-disciplinary programme. The paper ends with a synopsis of the results obtained after three seasons of survey and excavation. The "Khao Sam Kaeo Archaeological Mission" is a Franco-Thai collaboration between the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS), Silpakorn University (Bangkok), the École française d'Extrême-Orient (EFEO), and the Bureau des Recherches Géologiques et Minières (BRGM). Geographical factors and the development of early Thai-Malay Peninsula settlements and networks The Thai-Malay Peninsula may have had a pivotal role in exchange processes because of its geographical location on inter-regional networks, and its physical and cultural characteristics. Peninsula societies appear to have received and redistributed different material and cultural features from both the east and the Indian sub-continent. The settlement pattern of the Kra Isthmus has been partly shaped by its physical environment, such as the monsoon winds, the distribution of agricultural lands and mineral resources, and the location of overland and maritime routes: both the sailing patterns imposed by the periodic monsoon winds and the locations of overland passes played roles in the development of exchange networks (Jacq-Hergoualc'h 2002; O'Connor 1972: 13). For the mariners and merchants of the trans-Asiatic network, either the Thai-Malay Peninsula or the east coast of Sumatra constituted a necessary stop-over that could extend over several months (while waiting for a change of wind direction, undertaking boat repairs, etc). Relay stations developed to allow ships to off-load their cargoes and to pick up goods. Exploiting and deriving advantage from various physical landscapes and ecosystems, social groups took different developmental paths. On the Isthmus, most significant exchange-related polities in the narrowest part of the Peninsula were established on the eastern coast where hillslope fields were available for cultivation of rainfed crops, and sheltered</page><page sequence="6">262 Bérénice Bellina-Pryce &amp; Praon Silapanth harbours existed. Sediments and soils eventually eroded downslope from inland fields that were over-used, to become redeposited along the coast, forming, initially, a narrow fringing strip of soil that was too acidic to be arable. But eventually, after centuries of continued deposition, the coastal fringe became a broad, arable, coastal plain, so that, by ca. A.D. 1400-1500, exchange centres along the east coast of peninsular Thailand, and others along the west coast of Malaysia, benefited from the availability of broad coastal rice-growing plains capable of supplying food to significant populations (Allen 1990, 1991, 1997). Possessing hillslope fields but lacking even a narrow coastal plain, populations on the Bay of Bengal side took advantage of navigational constraints that made this region a practical stop-over. Populations on the eastern coast managed to develop attractive and favourable feeder points, not only providing staple goods, but also participating in long-distance exchange of goods of local, regional and inter-regional origins. Those goods stemmed from various ecosystems: agricultural and mineral resources from inland and upland areas, faunai and floral products from the interior tropical forest, and the series of long-distance exchanged goods listed by Wheatley (1959) from both local and foreign areas. Some of these valuable items were produced by local craft centres, which were using local or imported raw materials and techniques, and involved local craft specialists as well as possibly foreign craftsmen (Bellina 2002, 2003, 2007). The use of trans-peninsular routes is another factor whose significance has been much disputed (for an overview, see Jacq-Hergoualc'h 2002: 30-50). The similarities in materials found at sites located on both sides of the coasts have been interpreted as positive evidence for the use of trans-peninsular routes using rivers and portages. Early supporters of their use argued that they considerably reduced distances, especially across the Isthmus (Wales 1935: 16-17). Opponents considered the use of rivers striking longitudinally across the Peninsula difficult to navigate, given the great variability of their water levels (Peacock 1979: 200-201). Most researchers though agree that their use probably varied through time, depending on the ease of river navigation compared with that of maritime navigation at a given time, and that land routes were generally difficult and dangerous, which probably restricted their use to the transport of valuable, perishable and easily carried products such as timber. The available evidence from peninsular harbour sites such as Pengkalan Bujang, farther south in Kedah, suggests that maritime routes were preferred for heavy, bulky or fragile products such as ceramics (Jacq-Hergoualc'h 2002: 30-50; Manguin 1983). Though these physical characteristics surely account for the settlement pattern in historical times, it remains to be determined if this pattern varied in some parts of the Peninsula at other times and, if so, how and why. To answer these questions requires first to uncover what was the pattern for the early periods, a pattern as yet unknown; as a matter of fact, to date, few sites involved in inter-regional exchange prior to the mid- 1st millennium AD when maritime polities emerged, have been reported. The documented sites were restricted to the glass- and hard stone ornament producing centres of Khuan Lukpad on the west coast near Krabi (Bronson 1990; Veraprasert 1992), and Kuala Selinsing on the west coast in Perak, Malaysia (for the most recent work at Kuala Selinsing, see Shuhaimi 1 99 1 ). Despite not being precisely dated, they developed from the very late centuries BC through the early centuries AD. These</page><page sequence="7">Weaving cultural identities on trans-Asiatic networks 263 sites were interpreted as small local centres that provided specific products to other, more important sites that were directly exposed to foreign tradesmen. According to Leong Sau Heng's categories (1990), these small coastal or inland riverine sites, that she called "Feeding points", supplied landing places and foodstuffs that were then transported by local residents to coastal centres to be loaded onto foreign merchants' ships. Figure 2: Map 2. Khao Sam Kaeo in the Kra Isthmus The upper part of the Peninsula comprised of the regions stretching from the province of Petchaburi to the Kra Isthmus, where the province of Chumphon is to the east and Ranong lies to the west, was considered not to have been involved in any of these major processes that have been described for contemporary sites located elsewhere (Figure 2). The archaeological map of the area remained blank until the 1980s when the late prehistoric site of Khao Sam Kaeo, located on the east coast of the Kra Isthmus (Chumphon province) was first reported (Srisuchat 1986: I, 388-396; 1989; 1993: 131-43). This inland site lies beside the Tha Taphao river at the narrowest part of the Thai-Malay Peninsula; short portages to the headwaters of the Tha Taphao river and navigation of a series of small streams could have provided a link from the east coast to the Kraburi estuary on the Bay of Bengal (Jacq-Hergoualc'h 2002: 44; Wheatley 1961: xxvi). The seeming isolation of this site is questionable. It appears to us that the limited archaeological research so far undertaken on both sides of the Upper Peninsula and in the interior of the Isthmus of Kra, together with the earliest emphasis on historically-oriented research partly accounts for this situation and for the apparent</page><page sequence="8">264 Bérénice Bellina-Pryce &amp; Praon Silapanth lack of evidence for the region's early involvement in trans-Asiatic exchange. Another feasible reason could be that the use of this part of the Peninsula was restricted to the earliest period, an explanation in accordance with Wheatley's suggestion that sea routes superseded the trans-peninsular ones in the 1st c. BC, for possibly political reasons (1961: 12). Khao Sam Kaeo's peculiarities: a relevant site The recent research described in this dossier has yielded evidence that pleads for the significant involvement of the Upper Thai-Malay Peninsula region in the earliest trans-Asiatic networks. Firstly, several characteristic artefacts from sites in the area, some interpreted as prestige goods similar to those found in a number of late prehistoric Southeast Asian sites, indicate the Upper Peninsula's early involvement in regional and inter-regional exchange (Bellina 2002; Bellina &amp; Silapanth 2006). Secondly, current investigations at two sites located in the vicinity of the Rra Isthmus, Khao Sam Kaeo and Phu Khao Thong (Boonyarit, personal communication and observations) yield two further points of interest. The first is that they have both produced some of the just-mentioned Southeast Asian prestige goods that were involved in regional and inter-regional exchange during the late prehistoric and early historic periods. The second is that the production of these artefacts involves complex technologies that are usually considered to have been transferred to Southeast Asia and that includes at least one that surely stems from a South Asian tradition. Hence, excavations and survey can provide data to address questions related to the transfer of complex technologies along the trans- Asiatic routes, considering those as embedded in social, political, economic, ritual and ideational spheres of the societies producing and receiving them. Therefore, investigating a settlement whose craft systems were involved in early trans-Asiatic networks appears especially relevant as a means for investigating the role the Upper Peninsula played in transferring not only products but also cultural features, and for evaluating to what extent exchange participated in shaping the settlement's own cultural landscapes as well as those of the societies to which it was connected. Research objectives, methods and specialists This multi-disciplinary research project combines a study of the settlement and of its palaeo-environment with an analysis of the onsite craft production systems. Some of these craft goods were involved in trans- Asiatic networks (ceramics, glass, stone ornaments and metallurgical artefacts). The objectives are to: 1 . Define the late prehistoric settlement of Khao Sam Kaeo and its involvement in regional and inter-regional exchange networks, i.e., to produce an archaeological map displaying the means of circulation and links between sites, at local, regional and inter-regional levels. To that end, the project intends to define Khao Sam Kaeo's natural and anthropomorphic landscapes and in this perspective to address the nature of the settlement, defining its: - morphology and size according to natural and built boundaries, - organisation by investigating the spatial and social distribution of the different human activities and how those were inter-connected, - chronological sequence.</page><page sequence="9">Weaving cultural identities on trans-Asiatic networks 265 The study of the human landscape should also address the following issues: - What was the nature of the landscape the late prehistoric/early historic population of Khao Sam Kaeo selected to settle? How did Khao Sam Kaeo's people modify the landscape and why? What does landscape modification tell us about their activities (agriculture, craft industries, mineral exploitation)? Did the site's occupants perceive themselves as a community and express their identity with physical means (earthworks and moats or ditches)? - Does the human landscape inform us about social differentiation, i.e. were there different social groups within the site, as quarters could indicate, and how do they relate? Were there major landscape modifications such as hydraulic systems (tanks, dams, drainage and other systems) and ramparts, etc., that could be interpreted as indicating political centralisation? - Can we observe variations in the site's organisation though time? If so, can we relate them to any internal or external factors (e.g. changes in the interaction network, in resource exploitation, in production types)? To understand the role of the site and the region, the research will also address issues of their regional and inter-regional integration. - Regional integration: Archaeological sites (in similar or distinct ecozones) and possible ancient transportation linkages in the Chumphon-Ranong region will be located in order to assess the development of the regional economic and political landscape. - Inter-regional integration: The evidence from Khao Sam Kaeo will be compared with late prehistoric settlements in Central Thailand to the North, Vietnam to the East and the Indian subcontinent to the West. To sum up, investigating the development sequence of the anthropomorphic landscape aims at determining social structures and their evolution in connection to trans-Asiatic networks. Methods: this research combines an array of disciplines: survey, remote sensing, GIS, archaeobotany, geology and sedimentology. Survey is based on remote sensing (study of satellite and aerial imagery) and is combined with ground survey checking with small scale excavations (2x2m test pits) and sediment analysis. Remote sensing studies based on the interpretation of aerial and satellite imagery are carried out by R Silapanth, G. Kozminsky and N. Baghdadi (BRGM). As part of the palaeo-environmental evolution programme, an archaeobotanical study has been initiated to investigate the subsistence base of the settlement and whether new subsistence behaviours can be observed. If so, do they relate to dietary change (e.g. the introduction of new crops, and if so from where) or to the exploitation of the natural flora (horticulture or collection of forest products such as precious woods and resin) for exchange? As for the fauna, so far almost no faunai remains have been recovered due to the soil's acidity. The analysis of the archaeobotanical remains (anthracology, coprolythes, palynology, etc.) has just begun and is carried out by Cristina Castillo (UCL, Institute of Archaeology). The resin collected is analysed by Professor Jacques Connan (Laboratoire de Géochimie Bioorganique, Pau).</page><page sequence="10">266 Bérénice Bellina-Pryce &amp; Praon Silapanth 2. Explore the social structure and cultural changes in the different social groups involved in trans-Asiatic networks by investigating the on-site craft systems' organisation. Technological analyses will focus on the industries. To that end, the project intends to locate the different identified on-site craft production centers and to define them by characterising the following: - Their nature, by identifying the different stages of the production line, the so-called "chaîne opératoire technique". What were the technologies that were selected? If those did not result from local innovation, what is their origin, and what was the spatial and chronological sequence for their transfer? Can the means for the transfer be suggested (e.g., circulation of specialists)? - Their quality, by evaluating the technological skills involved; - The nature and origin of the raw materials used, by determining if they were locally produced or imported and, if imported, at which stage did they arrive at Khao Sam Kaeo (as raw material or as half-finished artefacts) and from where; - The possible destination(s) of the finished products: were they responding to local values and/or were they possibly adapted to specific regional or inter-regional demands? How were these technologies adapted to fulfil the different social groups' requirements, and did these changes entail major organisational changes? How did those technologies and their specialists express the social identities both of the users and the manufacturers? Results of the analyses may indicate the mechanisms of complex technological transfers along trans-Asiatic networks and amongst the social groups involved and their significance. In other words, craft systems will be investigated to determine the development sequence of cultural exchange among the different social groups involved. Methods: the different socio-technical systems specialists are as follow: Ph. Bouvet (Paris X) is carrying out a study of the early ceramics of South and Southeast Asian exchange, focusing on the corpus from Khao Sam Kaeo (see Bouvet, this volume). Metallurgical materials are studied by T. O. Pryce (UCL, Institute of Archaeology, London) (see Pryce et al., this volume). Glass ornaments are studied by James Lankton and L. Dussubieux (see Lankton et al., this volume). J. Lankton is carrying out major element analyses at the Wolfson Archaeological Laboratory of the Institute of Archaeology of London (UCL). Trace elements analyses are done by L. Dussubieux at the Department of Anthropology, Field Museum of Natural History (Chicago). Finally, hard stone industries are investigated by B. Bellina; she collaborates with J. Lankton for glass beads worked with lapidary techniques and with Hsiao-chun Hung (Australian National University, Canberra) and Yoshiyuki Iizuka (Academia Sinica, Taiwan) for nephrite material (Hsiao-chun et al. 2007). Only some results of the first part of this two-pronged programme are summarised in this paper. Some of the specialists cited above present the result of palaeo- environmental and craft studies in separate articles. Though still at an initial stage (except for hard stone industry), these technological studies have already yielded original information on the nature and development of the trans-Asiatic related industries and on the cultural interactions they allow us to infer (the regional and inter-regional integration of Khao Sam Kaeo).</page><page sequence="11">Weaving cultural identities on trans-Asiatic networks 267 Khao Sam Kaeo settlement: Research results Three campaigns have been carried out at Khao Sam Kaeo. The archaeological features observed on the site during our field survey and the test pits opened are recorded on a topographic map in progress (Figure 3). In total, 8 1 test pits have been excavated (324 m2 excavated): 27 on Hill 1, 17 on Hill 2, 16 on Hill 3 and 21 on Hill 4. Because of the extent of the site and its dense vegetation, only the western part of Hills 1, 2 and 4 have been investigated. At Hill 3, the eastern slopes have also been investigated. Figure 3: Temporary archaeological map (season 2007)</page><page sequence="12">268 Bérénice Bellina-Pryce &amp; Praon Silapanth Morphology and Size of the Settlement Our survey and excavations have provided information on the settlement's morphology and size and help us to start interpreting the interaction between the landscape and the settlement; in other words, it is now possible to discuss the extent to which the natural landscape constrained the settlement and conversely how the population landscaped Khao Sam Kaeo. Determining the communal involvement of inhabitants in their settlement may also help us to evaluate their sense of community. Geologically, the site consists of four hills whose summit heights average 30 m above sea level. They are separated by ravines oriented North-South (20°) and East- West (110°). The tops of the hills are relatively flat, forming plateaux; summit plateau size ranges between 150 x 150 m and 200 x 200 m. The resulting landscape is an area divided into several sub-rectangular units. Hills constituted a safe area for settlement; remote sensing has revealed that the surrounding lowlands were subjected to flooding in antiquity. Khao Sam Kaeo was never a coastal site, but it always has been connected to the sea via the Tha Tapao River, whose channel has changed several times. The settlement's distinguishing features On the western side, the river Tha Tapao forms both a natural boundary and a protective border. In the eastern part of the site, survey and excavations uncovered 17 earth embankments (called "walls" for simplicity). Other walls are partially discernable at the eastern end of the site. More might exist, but those areas have not been investigated yet given the extent of the site and the density of the forest cover. Of the 1 7 walls located since 2005, 9 have been excavated and proved to be man- made. We distinguished two types of such earthworks: those on hills and plateaux and flanked with ditches that limit areas of the site and are interpreted as ramparts; those located in the bottom of Valleys 1 and 3 which could be parts of a hydraulic system. • Ramparts This type of embankment was built using a mixture of lateritic soil, pebbles and gravel extracted by digging into the decomposed bedrock, thus producing a ditch beside the wall. Hills 1 and 2 Wall 1 and Wall 2 traverse Hill 1 and Hill 2 respectively (Figure 4). Excavation of the ditch of Wall 1 showed that it had been cut up to 1 .20 m into the bedrock and that a small drainage was further cut in the middle. Two occupation layers prior to the construction of the wall were found.</page><page sequence="13">Weaving cultural identities on trans-Asiatic networks 269 Figure 4: Rampart 1 on Hill 1 (test pits 21-22 -30 and 39) Despite modern disturbance, interpretation of the structure suggests the probable ancient morphology of the wall and its ditch. The current height of the wall is about lm (between 8.40 m-9.40 m). The depth of the ditch is 1.20 m. According to their profile, the original height can be estimated to have been at least 4.20 m. The total length of the set of Walls 1 and 2 measures 490 m; these walls enclose the southern part of the settlement on its eastern edge, the western one being naturally delimited by the Tha Tapao river. Topographic mapping emphasised two minor elevated irregularities about 30 m east of Wall 1 and running more or less parallel to it. Formerly thought to be geological features, their excavation in 2007 revealed that Walls 12 and 17 are probably a pair of very eroded walls with a central ditch (Figure 5).</page><page sequence="14">270 Bérénice Bellina-Pryce &amp; Praon Silapanth Figure 5: Ramparts 12 and 17 on Hill 1 (test pits 80-81) Their poor condition is partly due to severe modern disturbance but may also result from their being older than Walls 1 and 2. Unfortunately, their excavation did not provide dateable materials to test this hypothesis. The assumption that they predate Walls 1 and 2 is based not only on their morphology but also on the accounts of villagers who often reported important finds from this part of Hill 1. Amongst these finds were three Dong Son drums found within a single pit. The presence of artefacts outside the area enclosed by Wall 1 might be better understood if Walls 12 and 17 correspond to a boundary preceding the one delimited by Wall 1 . Hill 3 Excavations revealed that the eastern plateau of Hill 3 was surrounded by a system of walls and ditches (Walls 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 13, and 14) (Figure 6).</page><page sequence="15">Weaving cultural identities on trans-Asiatic networks 271 Figure 6: Ramparts 5 and 8 and their profile on the eastern plateau on the top of Hill 3 (test pits 38, 40 and 43) Test pits located in three different sections of Wall 8 revealed that it had been built over another eroded structure, Wall 15. Between these walls were occupation layers and related structures (a posthole and a terrace), both associated with industrial remains, first from iron-forging and later from hard stone ornament production. Wall 5's ditch is located 4 m east of Wall 5, in the middle of a natural ravine running alongside Test pit (TP) 38. Its excavation showed that a drain had been cut into the bedrock, and that different phases represent different phases of use, abandonment and repair. During its latest phase, the moat was filled to make a convenient path towards the east, with an opening made in Wall 5, i.e., to form a sort of gate. This ditch was dug taking advantage of a natural geological feature, a ravine that was cut deeply into the slope and artificially deepened on the plateau.</page><page sequence="16">272 Bérénice Bellina-Pryce &amp; Praon Silapanth In summary, the eastern plateau of Hill 3 is delimited by a system of walls and ditches, and by twin walls on the east and western side, resulting in a rectangular area of about 160 m long x 95 m wide, an area of around 1 .5 hectares. The western plateau has not been investigated yet. Hill 4 Excavation carried out in 2007 on the western part of the top of Hill 4, revealed a wall and its ditch (Wall 11). Thought to have been built using the same technique as similar structures, Wall 1 1 and its ditch show a different pattern: they are partially geological features. At the foot of the hill, the elevated feature and the ravine running alongside are geological features, whilst those on the plateau, and an additional one (Wall 16), have been constructed. This evidence suggests that natural features played a role in determining the location of some of the earthworks. Ramparts: summary and dating evidence The general pattern for rampart elevation at Khao Sam Kaeo seems to be: twin walls separated by a ditch on gentle slopes and plateaux, a single wall and ditch on steep slopes, and no walls at all on very steep slopes. As for their morphology, we have recovered no evidence for the use of wooden palisades or other perishable structures on the tops of the embankments; this is not surprising, as the erosion of upper layers would make their survival unlikely. This type of rampart constructed from earth excavated from an adjacent ditch has possible correlates from the Indian subcontinent. Comparable earthworks are present during the earliest stages in Nagarjunakonda, in Andhra Pradesh ( Indian Archaeology, a Review 1957-1958: 5), at Rajgir in Bihar at the 6th-5th c. BC {Indian Archaeology, a Review 1961-62: 7-8, 1962-65: 5-6) and at Sisupalgarh in Orissa (Lal 1949). We still need to determine if all of the embankments at Khao Sam Kaeo were man-made, as well as their chronological sequence. Different phases are represented, with renovation and construction of additional walls built beside or above others, resulting in shifts in the surrounding walls. Attempts to date these features using charcoal have been unsuccessful. The organic remains found in the upper layers of decomposed bedrock that had been used to build the walls belong to a period prior to Khao Sam Kaeo's occupation (example: TP 40, WK 18767: 6568±42 BP, Cal BC(5570- 5470)) 4. Consequently, it is not possible yet to create a chronological sequence for these features. However, their dating is suggested by absolute date ranges for associated occupation layers. Wall 1 was found to overlie two occupation layers, for which 3 calibrated radiocarbon dates provide a very early 4th-2nd c. BC chronological range (Wk 16804, Wk 16803 and WK 16805)5.

Regarding their use, besides being urban hallmarks, the most likely practical purpose for the walls located on the hills is a defensive one, but perhaps also to protect against flooding. • Embankments that may be parts of an hydraulic system The second type of wall, located in valleys, is shorter and nowadays interrupted in the centre. Five walls of this type were recorded: Wall 3 in Valley 1 ; and Walls 6, 9, and 17 in Valley 3 (as well as part of what we currently call Wall 7). Excavation of Wall 3 established that its central part had been built of compact sand alternating with layers of gravel and pebbles (Figure 7). The outer edges of the wall were reinforced with large pebbles, most likely to strengthen those areas where water still flows. The structure directly overlies the natural clay deposit. The morphology and composition of this structure differs from those located on the hills and so probably did its role.

Nowadays, it is about 3 m heigh and 15m long; it could have been used to retain monsoon waters flowing out of the hills from ravines and ditches, to create a water tank upstream (to the east). Meanwhile, it could also have trapped sediments, preventing the silting-in of the western part of the valley. Its excavation evidenced an accumulation of about 1 . 1 Om of alluvial deposits since the antique period. Such a water reservoir could have had several purposes: - domestic, for fresh water; - agricultural, in particular for paddy fields; - defensive, water constituting an obstacle on the eastern part of the site; - as a mooring place for embarkations. In addition, during the monsoon seasons, this large dam could have been used also to allow the passage between the hills. We have not yet been able to directly date this structure but investigations are ongoing. Settlement extent and size Evidence Determining whether specific areas were settled or not, i.e., if the material found in a given area is indeed in situ, is not an easy task at Khao Sam Kaeo. The site environment is subject to severe erosion from rains and cyclones, besides modern disturbances. Careful geological consideration, combined with meticulous excavation, are required to determine whether the materials found result from occupation in situ or may have eroded from another area. Settled areas and their related structures are evidenced by terraces, floors, pathways, wells, small walls, drainages and postholes. Inhabitants raised structures on plateaux and gentle slopes. Communal and domestic terraces were built to create level areas on slopes. Like ramparts, they were made from a mixture of gravel, pebbles and lateritic soil. Two communal terraces have been located so far. The first was set up at the base of Hill 1, on a gentle slope bordering Valley 1. Within this large terrace, a canal had been cut to drain waters flowing from Hill 1 and from Wall 1 's ditch. Above this large terrace a series of footpaths were observable. Remains of two structures (walls) built in pisé, i.e., a mix of gravel and clay were found on this terrace, as well as on that bordering Valley 1 at the southern base of Hill 2 (Figure 8). On both sides of these pisé walls, which have been renovated on several occasions, internal and external floors have accumulated, each composed of a mix of gravel and small pebbles. Most domestic structures were established on piles driven into individual terraces built the same way as the communal ones. Habitations show different occupation layers, as evidenced by successive floors, some of them composed of gravel, and by remains of postholes and hearths (Figure 9).</page><page sequence="19">Weaving cultural identities on trans-Asiatic networks 275 Figure 8: Structure and its occupation layers - a wall built in pisé on a platform at the bottom end of the southern piedmont of Hill 2 (test pit 41) Figure 9: Habitation on the eastern plateau of Hill 3 (test pit 35)</page><page sequence="20">276 Bérénice Bellina-Pryce &amp; Praon Silapanth Limits Occupation seems to have been largely restricted to areas within the walls, but further investigations are needed to confirm this result, especially on the eastern parts of all hills, where more ramparts may exist. At Khao Sam Kaeo, as at some South Asian settlements of the early historic period (ex: Sisupalgarh, Lal 1949: 64), habitations have been found outside the wall-enclosed space. In Southeast Asia, stupas can be located outside the walled settlement as evidenced on the Dvaravati sites of U-Thong andNakhon Pathom. This might be the case for the almost-flat area located east of Wall 5's ditch, on the eastern plateau of Hill 3. This area was occupied, as indicated by modern disturbances and through local villager interviews; later filling of the ditch was probably undertaken to allow the passage between the two zones. Do the habitations set up outside the known surrounding walls correspond to different quarters associated with distinct social groups or do they belong to different periods? Do inhabited zones located outside ramparts correspond to extensions of the settlement during later periods? Another alternative is that those inhabitated zones were delimited by other walls not yet uncovered. More investigations are required to answer these questions. Another small hill to the north (Hill 5, off the archaeological map), where a few sherds have been reported, is still to be investigated. Given the extent of the site and its difficult environment, large areas remain unsurveyed. However, villagers interviewed have not reported finding significant remains outside the area described above. More interviews and excavations are required to check this definition of the settlement's extent. Size To estimate the site's dimensions, two types of zones were taken into account: firstly, clearly defined zones enclosed by walls (e.g., the eastern plateau of Hill 3); and secondly, areas situated in the vicinities of plateaux and on the slopes and which have yielded materials that may not represent actual habitation. Due to the fact that erosion is especially severe in this environment, archaeological remains found in those areas are not considered to be in their original locations (in primary depositional status); they may have been redeposited here after eroding from locations upslope. Based on the preliminary archaeological map, the size of the site can be estimated at 54 hectares. Settlement morphology Excavations demonstrated that the settlement's morphology results from natural, landscaped and fully human-constructed boundaries. To the west, the site is delimited by the Tha Tapao river, to the east, parts of the four hills are traversed and plateaux are enclosed by a series of earthen embankments (single or twin) and their associated ditches, which are, in part, landscaped geological features (ravines). Perhaps because all the ramparts may not have been found, the encircling walls do not yet form a distinguishable shape. So far, the series of walls recovered do not produce a linear and uninterrupted pattern comparable to contemporary city wall</page><page sequence="21">Weaving cultural identities on trans-Asiatic networks Til patterns in Indian cities such as Sisupalgarh, Mahastangarh, Saheth-Maheth, etc (Erdosy 1995; Smith 2003). Craft Activity Locations The hills were not only used for habitation, but also for some of the craft activities. Glass industry So far, two zones for glass working, especially for bracelets and lapidary glass beads, have been identified. These are located on the flat lowlands near the river, at the southern and western base of Hill 2. Of note are some "trumpet-like" iron objects found on the top of Hill 4 during our survey. These could be remains of tools, known as lada, which would have been used to produce glass tubes for the drawn glass beadmaking industry in southern India (see Lankton et al., this volume; Pryce et al., this volume). Hard stone industry (both chalcedony and nephrite) Evidence for hard stone ornament production has been found in two different contexts. The first one includes the flat lands close to the river at the southern and western base of Hill 2; there, the evidence is associated with that of glass- working. The second context includes the summit of Hills 3 and 4, both very disturbed. On Hill 3, production evidence is scattered in different areas of the eastern plateaux whilst on Hill 4 it seems to be more concentrated in the northern part. Of the 7 radiocarbon dates from glass and stone ornament industrial contexts, 6 fit within a very consistent time frame, between the 4th and 2nd c. BC. Charcoal samples gave a late date range, 6th-7th c. AD (TP29-US5, Wk 18762: 1507±47 BP, Cal AD (430-640 AD), but these are likely to be intrusive as the samples were collected close to the surface. To us, it appears unlikely that the same glass production survived in this same place for more than a millennium. Iron industry Iron slag and artefacts were unearthed in several of our test pits and also lie scattered across the site, suggesting the production (and/or repair) and use of a range of common tool types (Pryce et al., this volume). For this industry, charcoal was sampled from two layers providing smithing evidence. In the previously mentioned pit on the western plateau of Hill 3, the occupation layer between Walls 8 and 15, which also contains iron-smithing debris, provided a 4th-2nd c. BC date range (Wk 1 8769: 2223±3 1 BP, Cal BC (390-200)). In</page><page sequence="22">278 Bérénice Bellina-Pryce &amp; Praon Silapanth another test pit on Hill 3's western plateau, a layer that yielded elevated quantities of slag and a few crucibles produced a similar date range (TP77 US2, Wk 21178)7. Ceramics No evidence of ceramic production such as kilns and wasters has been recovered. Noteworthy is the differential distribution of foreign-related ceramic types, both Indian-related and Chinese-related ceramics (in the latter case, of Han tradition), across the site (Figure 10). In 2007, excavations and survey on Hills 3 and 4 yielded several sherds of Han-related pottery, representing an eastern external link; the evidence for this link is strengthened by metal artefacts such as the fragment of a bronze mirror, an arrow-head and a "swallowtail" bronze axe (Pryce et al., this volume), as well as by the Dong Son drums found by villagers on Hill 1 which could have been manufactured even earlier. Figure 10: Western Han sherds from Khao Sam Kaeo, season 2007. Distribution of craft workshops within the site At this stage, it is too early to determine whether the distribution of craft areas results from a specific organisation of production or from different periods. Two specific findings appear all the more striking. The first is that the glass industry is apparently restricted to flat zones at the base of Hill 2 close to the river. The fire risk related to high-temperature glass-working does not alone explain the necessity to work outside habitation areas; evidence for metallurgical activities, which also use high-temperature furnaces was found on hills associated with habitation contexts. A need for proximity to water as a manufacturing requirement 7. Wk 2 1 1 78: 2 1 84±35 BP, Cal BC(380- 1 60).</page><page sequence="23">Weaving cultural identities on trans-Asiatic networks 279 or as a means for the transport of raw materials and finished products does not seem an adequate argument, as both hard stone and possibly metal industries also use water, but did not always locate near the river. Although the combined stone and glass working workshop is located near the river, other stone-working workshops occupy the summits of Hills 3 and 4, and both iron workshops are located on Hill 3's western and eastern plateaux. A second peculiarity is the discovery of both glass and hard stone ornament craft remains in the same context. Besides the fact that the two manufacturing processes are very different, ethnographic evidence shows that the two industries are also traditionally very distinct in terms of social groups (Francis 2002). A possible explanation may lie in the type of ornament produced: bracelets and lapidary glass beads. Lapidary glass beads and hard stone ones share some manufacturing stages (Bellina 2005: 54-55; Bellina &amp; Silapanth 2006: 386-389). Burial places Our excavations uncovered two burials: one that could be securely assigned to the late prehistoric settlement, and one belonging to an earlier occupation. The first one is a funerary urn excavated in the northern edge of Valley 3 and containing the cremated bones of two children. The burial produced a 4th-2nd c. BC calibrated radiocarbon date range (Wk 211 75) 8. The skeletal remains suggest that one child was possibly aged 11-15 years old and the other 0-2 years old9. The second burial, encountered in a layer below those associated with the glass bracelet and stone ornament-working activities, was exposed in a test pit located at the western base of Hill 2 (TP 29); it produced sherds associated with two stone axes (one knapped, the other one polished). Several polished stone axes and big pots said to have been associated with ashes and fine ornaments, were found by villagers and crew members in an area at the base of Hill 2. Unfortunately, modern pits fully disturb this area, and no archaeological excavations can be carried out there. Water reservoir: potential mooring places? Further investigations are required to check whether, as the landscape and remote- sensing interpretations suggest, Valley 1 and potentially Valley 3 were flooded in Antiquity and, if so, whether they were possibly used as landing places. So far, test pits and geological drillings show that Valley 1 might have been flooded. Its edges, where some glass and semi-precious stone craft activities took place, seem to have been occasionally flooded. It is possible that Wall 3, located upstream, might have been used to control the water level as well as to prevent silt from filling the landing place. A possible use that needs to be checked is whether this valley, connected to the Tha Thapao river, might have been used as a mooring for small vessels accessing the Tha Thapao river to deliver foreign or other goods brought upstream from the coast (e.g., ceramics) and to pick up local goods to be transported downstream. 8.

However, of 18 radiocarbon dates, 14 place the site in the very early 4th to 2nd c. BC time bracket, a period that probably corresponds with the most activity (Figure 11). , , Figure 11: 14C diagram Except for two dates processed on samples collected within the embankments (decomposed bedrock), that produced dates that are too early (Wk 18766 and Wk 18767) 10, the earliest excavated evidence for "occupation" derives from a probable burial offering of two axes (mentioned above) which was radiocarbon-dated to the 1 8th- 1 7th c. BC (Wk 18763) n. Several other small and large (up to 30 cm) stone axes have also been recovered in flat areas near the river. Certain ceramic types and seals that can be dated on the basis of stylistic elements suggest that the site was also inhabited in the early centuries AD but was perhaps less active. Four inscribed seals and a bicolor stone sphere, two of them engraved with animal or anthropomorphic figures, were shown to us by villagers (Figure 12). 10. These samples correspond to TP40-US7, WK 18766: 8412±42 BP, Cal BC(7580-7350) and Wk 18767: 6568±42 BP, Cal BC(5570- 5470). 11.

AD (Bellina 2002; Bellina &amp; Silapanth 2006: 384-385). Two of the other three seals and the bicolour sphere all display the genitive forms of names in Prakrit language, written in an early Brahmi script that was used from the 1st c. BC to the 1st c. AD. The first one, a green stone seal inscribed in a 1st c. BC-AD Brahmi script, is translated by Peter Skilling (École française d'Extrême-Orient) and Oskar von Hinüber (Freiburg University) as follow: "Kapanasa", genitive of the name "Kapana", so "property of Kapana" (Figure 12-1) (personal communication 1 7.02.07). The second seal is a green stone rectangular seal. R. Salomon (Washington University) has identified the first three syllables "i-si-da-"; for the next syllable, of which only the lower part remains, he suggested to read "ta". The four syllables create "isidata", a frequent Indian name equivalent to the Sanskrit "r.s.idatta" (Figure 12-2). Salomon specifies that if the genitive was intended, as is usually the case for inscriptions on seals, one should read "isidata(*sa)" (personal communication to B. Bellina 19.05.06). The third seal is a four-sided rectangular red stone seal bearing an inscription that cannot yet be translated and an anthropomorphic representation that may be a deity (Figure 12-3). The bicolor stone sphere is also inscribed in Brahmi (Figure 12-4). Professor Iravatham (epigraphist of the State Department of Archaeology, Tamil Nadu) suggests that the first two characters of the inscription are: "ma-Tha" and that "the reading 'ma-Tha-ha' means 'of MaTTha', probably a personal name". "MaTTa (maTTha)" means literally 'polished, burnished, pure'(PTS Pali-English Dictionary). However the word may be a personal name, as suggested by the genitive ending. The genitive ending "-ha" would indicate that the</page><page sequence="26">282 Bérénice Bellina-Pryce &amp; Praon Silapanth language is Sinhala-Prakrit. But this leads to two problems: (a) Aspirates including "Tha" seldom occur in Sri Lankan Brahmi inscriptions of this period ; (b) The word "maTTa" (MaTTha) is not attested in Sri Lanka Brahmi inscriptions" (personal communication 22-04-2007). Discussion: Khao Sam Kaeo as an early urban settlement Three campaigns of survey and excavation at Khao Sam Kaeo allow us to present preliminary settlement-based inferences regarding social organisation of a late prehistoric settlement in peninsular Thailand that was involved in trans- Asiatic exchange. Combining the results drawn from the socio-technological systems analysed by the project specialists and presented in this dossier will refine the interpretations presented below. The investigation of Khao Sam Kaeo provides evidence to fuel discussions on the origins of urbanisation and centralisation in maritime Southeast Asia, and in correlating these processes within the trans- Asiatic exchange framework. The prevailing image of large Indianised urban sites suddenly appearing during the mid- 1st millennium AD, apparently without local precedents, is likely to have been distorted greatly, given the paucity of investigations at late prehistoric settlements. The extent to which Khao Sam Kaeo's population selected, landscaped and organised their environment prompts the discussion of urbanising trends at the site. It seems reasonable to consider that Khao Sam Kaeo's founders not only selected a suitable environment for living but also chose a landscape that could be modified to provide defence and water management. The topography was exploited to make the most of its productive potential. There are clear indications of trans- generational investments in the scale of the communal earthworks. Excavation has uncovered evidence for terrace and rampart maintenance, during different periods, followed by prolonged abandonment, and subsequent reconstruction of earthworks above or adjacent to the original structures. Without doubt, our understanding of the developmental sequence, and more specifically the different earthwork and occupation phases, would benefit from more absolute dating and an improved geomorphological understanding of the dynamic local environment. At present, based on 14 radiocarbon dates, the early 4th to 2nd c. BC time span (with a possible extension to the 1st c. BC/AD, as suggested by the seals) corresponds to the period of greatest activity at the site. The substantial dimensions of Khao Sam Kaeo, and the shocking damage done by looting, precludes against meaningful quantitative estimation of population levels, and the extent of landscape modification, or the scale of craft production. Although problematic, ongoing research will attempt to investigate these issues. As a late prehistoric settlement, Khao Sam Kaeo is remarkably large and its earthwork system complex. Internal organisation is so far evidenced by the differential location of activities; possible occupation areas outside the ramparts and variable artefact distributions could reflect distinct social zoning or land use</page><page sequence="27">Weaving cultural identities on trans-Asiatic networks 283 that changed through time. This latter issue is a major focus of the project's ongoing technological analysis. As it is true for some other Southeast Asian late prehistoric sites, Khao Sam Kaeo is located near a river system and has drainage channels to mitigate the effects of flooding. However, the complex site configuration and earthwork system distinguishes Khao Sam Kaeo from its peers. Bearing in mind their different environment, the morphologies of many studied late prehistoric sites differ greatly from Khao Sam Kaeo. In Northeastern Thailand and Northern Cambodia, the earthworks at later sites consist of circular banks and ditches, which in some cases may correspond to engineered paleo-river channels (Moore 1988; O'Reilly 2000). In contrast, Khao Sam Kaeo displays morphological and organisational features that can be compared to those of some mid- 1st millennium AD Southeast Asian Indianised urban settlements. Similarities between Khao Sam Kaeo and such sites include the incorporation of the river as part of the site's circumference, earthen embankments (possibly topped with wooden palisades) that enclose different areas, and water management that may have included water tanks within and/or beyond the walled areas (see for comparison Mudar 1999: 6; Quaritch- Wales 1969; Saraya 1992: 135; Vallibhotama 1992: 123-125). At the present stage of our investigation, we estimate that the total area of the settlement is about 54 hectares, very slightly exceeding the range known for well-dated late prehistoric sites in Northeastern Thailand. For comparison, sizes for the latter range from 18 to 50 hectares. In contrast, the areas of mid- 1st millennium AD sites in the Mekong delta (Oc Eo with about 300 hectares) and the Pyu sites in Burma ranged from 222 to 300 hectares (Stark 2006: 417). Dvaravati moated sites in the central plains of Thailand were generally less than 47 hectares but could reach 350 hectares; Nakhon Pathom with its estimated 602 hectares being an exception (Mudar 1999: 7-8). In South Asia, data concerning the morphology, size, structure, and network integration of early historic urban settlements are still sparse. Besides the lack of comprehensive surveys conducted to date, the changes made during long- term occupations (and thus tell formation) of settlements greatly limits what we can learn about their earliest phases. The dimensions of mid- 1st millennium BC South Asian settlements are rarely reported. From the mid- 1st millennium BC on, early walled cities proliferated, especially in the north (Smith 2003: 274-75). As at Khao Sam Kaeo, the earliest components of South Asian ramparts consist of earthen structures, each constructed of fill excavated from an adjacent ditch; only later were these ramparts topped with brick or stone (Smith 2003: 279; Conningham &amp; Allchin 1995: 167). Earthwork shape varies as each walled city adapted to its local landscape. No careful planning of cities predating the Mauryan period has so far been reported, with the exception of Sisupalgarh in Orissa (Erdosy 1995: 111). The internal organisation of domestic and industrial locales around ceremonial and administrative centres, considered in part or in whole characteristic of "cities", is absent from the archaeological and historical record for South Asian cities of the mid- 1st millennium BC (Erdosy 1995; Allchin 1995; Conningham &amp; Allchin 1995; Smith 2003: 278-279). To our knowledge, contextual information on craft activities</page><page sequence="28">284 Bérénice Bellina-Pryce &amp; Praon Silapanth is lacking in the literature for later periods as well. Morrison urges the need to locate and study the craft production (production/consumption) in Early Historical South Asian sites as it is a major component of local economies without which trading and cultural networks cannot be understood (1997: 103). In the current absence of data and following a Marxist paradigm, Erdosy argued that if Arthasastras ' requirements for a politically highly controlled production and distribution had been followed, one might expect these activities to concentrate in easily controlled areas (Erdosy 1 995 : 1 1 1 - 1 1 2). At Khao Sam Kaeo, current research seems to indicate that the craft areas were enclosed either by walls or by the river. However, further investigation and especially additional survey of the surrounding area will be required to ascertain whether this distribution is systematic or not. Little research has so far been focused on the local and regional networks integration of late prehistoric settlements either in South Asia (Smith 2003: 276- 277) or in Southeast Asia. As for the integration of Khao Sam Kaeo within local and regional networks, to date, no archaeological site has been reported in the vicinity (radius 20 km); the absence of neighbouring settlements cannot be explained at the present time and actually seems unlikely. However, survey at a local and regional level is still in its initial stages. Urban growth implies a population capable of producing sufficient surplus to support its specialists. What was Khao Sam Kaeo's agro-ecosystem? Was it able to produce surplus and if so, can we evaluate its capacity to support regional and inter-regional networks? Did the settlement rely on a rural hinterland to fulfil its agrarian needs? If so, what was the extent of these lands (immediately adjacent or not), and was Khao Sam Kaeo exerting control over them? Whether Khao Sam Kaeo was connected to inland communities that could supply mineral and forest materials for exchange is one of the questions yet to be addressed. Khao Sam Kaeo is located at the end of several possible trans-peninsular routes, forming a node that could have facilitated the control of upstream and downstream (river or sea) interactions. Some of these routes link tin-rich areas to sites yielding early evidence of trans-Asiatic interaction, such as Phu Khao Thong. Considering Khao Sam Kaeo's landscaped environment as an expression of communal investment allows us to infer some aspects of its social organisation. Labour-intensive architecture can be argued to demonstrate a level of organisational ability; the direction and/or control of a large workforce is manifested in the construction and maintenance of the site's large structures, which are as much the embodiment of social decisions as they are symptoms and/or catalysts of increasing complexity (O'Reilly 2000: 13). Communal architecture enshrines the symbolic values of the community that created it. The landscaped environment and civil architecture both bear witness to centuries of civic investment; for its residents, the landscape and architecture constituted a means for exhibiting the strength of a settlement that was actively integrated in regional and large inter-regional networks. Representing civic trans-generational investment, the earthworks display a sense of shared identity for urban residents (Smith 2003). Research is at too early a stage to determine whether these collective works were centrally planned or not, or what they suggest about the political organisation of Khao Sam Kaeo society. We are making</page><page sequence="29">Weaving cultural identities on trans-Asiatic networks 285 efforts to quantify the volume of the earthworks, and thus generate an approximation for the time that was probably involved in producing them. Nonetheless, it will remain hard to evaluate annual erosion and maintenance factors, and experiments will never provide satisfactory results in short term conditions. An extremely erosive climate was likely a determining factor in this part of the Peninsula, nine months of rain, without considering dramatic typhoons, required constant maintenance for earthworks located on slopes. Excavations have revealed successive repairs. The settlement of slopes and hilltops at Khao Sam Kaeo probably necessitated continual investment in flood defences. Nowadays, the hills are used only for rubber plantations and the people live in the valleys, although they are regularly flooded. Perhaps this behaviour reflects long-term experience of the local environment and suggests one of the reasons for the site's abandonment. More broadly, could the aggressive local environment and climate partly account for a non-persisting settlement pattern? Would Khao Sam Kaeo's type of environment only have shortly been selected by some of the late prehistoric coastal populations of the Upper Peninsula involved in early trans- Asiatic exchange? We can inquire as to whether the defence and/or flood-protection abilities of the hills could have constituted the settlement's weak point, and whether the failure of the earthworks to protect may have been one of the reasons for the site's abandonment when, for various undetermined reasons, the sense of communal investments' necessity was lost. To sum up, if one concurs that Khao Sam Kaeo shares comparable urbanisation evidence with that from mid- 1st millennium BC South Asian urban settlements, and to mid- 1st millennium AD Indianised Southeast Asian cities, then it follows that Khao Sam Kaeo can be considered an early urban settlement. We cannot directly compare Southeast Asian sites to Indian ones where subsequent occupations have in the known cases produced too many changes to allow access to evidence representing the earliest mid- 1st millennium BC settlements (Smith 2003). Bearing in mind the limited work so far conducted at mid- 1st millennium BC settlements, however, we are confident that no other contemporaneous Southeast Asian site has yielded as much evidence for urbanisation as Khao Sam Kaeo. Whether it is accepted that this evidence bears some Indian imprints is a matter for further discourse. Obviously, we also need to take into account the results of the socio-technical systems studies still to be completed and to follow thereafter. The debate will focus on the nature of evidence on which grounds we consider cultural exchange with South Asia to be meaningful. If only traditional arguments, i.e. presence of Indian religious statues, temples and writings are to be accepted, then there is an even more difficult dilemma: even in contemporary South Asia, these are not to be found. In the mid- 1st millennium BC, to our knowledge, no one has ever unearthed a Brahmanical temple or Buddhist stupa in an urban context. Furthermore, in South Asia prior to the Gupta period (from the 4th c. AD), who knows what a Hindu temple is? In this period, most of the regions now labelled as South Asian were themselves under-going the "Indianisation" process. Defining cultural exchange during the late prehistoric period and how those interactions</page><page sequence="30">286 Bérénice Bellina-Pryce &amp; Praon Silapanth participated in building the Southeast Asian cultural environment should therefore take into account these restrictions in South Asia itself. Evidence supports the assertion that Khao Sam Kaeo was a significant early polity bearing signs of urbanisation and possibly centralisation, and one involved in trans-Asiatic exchange. It is conceivable that some of these processes bear Indianised imprints. The Upper Kra Isthmus appears therefore to have played a prominent role in the burgeoning early trans- Asiatic economic and cultural networks of the mid- 1 st millennium BC. The following specialist studies in this volume present preliminary conclusions to interpret the economic and cultural interaction spheres of the Upper Peninsula. Technological analyses already provide original data allowing us to reconstruct some of the early transfers of complex technologies coming from South Asian, Southeast Asian, East Asian and Chinese horizons (Han China) and to infer some aspects of their social dimension.
