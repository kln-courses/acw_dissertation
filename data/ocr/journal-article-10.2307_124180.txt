<plain_text><page sequence="1">The iconography of power among the Classic Maya Joyce Marcus Introduction One of the most absorbing research problems in archaeology has been the origins of the so-called 'pristine' states (Fried I967: I:rI) - those which arose independently out of simpler societies. The Classic Maya civilization of Mesoamerica (A.D. 300-900) is a case in point. Although the Maya arose in the context of other emergent Mesoamerican states - the Zapotec, Teotihuacan, and others - most specialists are convinced that the Maya must be understood in their own terms, rather than merely by influence or stimulation from Central Mexico. One of the major differences between states and the simpler chiefdom societies which preceded them (Service 1962) is in the exercise of power. While chiefdoms have a strong development of hereditary inequality, they do not show true stratification - the existence of a professional ruling class whose kin-ties with the common people have been severed (Sanders and Price I968). And while some chiefs do have the power of life and death over their subjects, states have far more power in areas like waging war, levying taxes, drafting soldiers, and exacting tribute. States in fact have a monopoly of legitimized governmental power which represents a quantum leap over that of chiefdoms. There is some reason to believe, however, that neither chiefdoms nor the rulers of emerging archaic states really had all the power they thought they needed for per- manence and invulnerability. We see this in their expansion and contraction, their boundaries continually oscillating relative to neighbouring and competing states. We see it conveyed also, I believe, in their iconography. For the emergent states - and perhaps some high chiefdoms as well - were preoccupied with power when it came to the production of monumental works of art. So strong is this theme that one almost suspects the archaic states were using propaganda to impress their subjects and their contemporaries with their power and degree of stratification. Perhaps these emer- gent civilizations needed such displays of power precisely because they did not yet have truly effective institutionalized powers. The Maya, like many archaic states, communicated through conventionalized sym- bols and iconography the non-egalitarian relationships and unequal powers of their members. Persons in positions of authority were often juxtaposed with persons occupying low-status positions; the contrast in dress and paraphernalia communicated their differential access to power and additionally served to sanctify the extant: hierarchy. Rulers could sanctify their position by claiming direct descent from ancestral figures</page><page sequence="2">84 Joyce Marcus (which might be actual or mythical) or from deities. Sanctified myth or legend becomes history, and history in turn may be manipulated by the ruler to establish or maintain his position or claim to the throne. The establishment, preservation, and maintenance of legitimized power seems to be a fundamental goal in stabilizing the office of rulership in a differentiated or hierarchical structure. In this paper I will restrict myself to three topics: the way the Maya ruling class used iconography and writing to establish its credentials; the way they contrasted conqueror and conquered; and the way realism was employed to distinguish the ruler from the ruled. Political power in the Maya region The Maya Indians occupied nearly all of what is now Guatemala and British Honduras; the sections of Honduras and El Salvador which are adjacent to the eastern border of Guatemala; and the states of Yucatain, Quintana Roo, Campeche and large sections of Tabasco and Chiapas in Mexico (see fig. 25). The 'Classic' Period of the Maya is defined as the span of time during which they produced carved stone monuments with Long Count dates, i.e. roughly A.D. 25o-900oo1 Although the majority of Maya monuments are stelae (free-standing stone monu- ments) which depict an individual ruler, there are important lintels, staircases, altars and panels which portray other individuals and express other themes. At least one of these themes communicates the power of the Maya ruler by juxtaposing him with captive figures. Morley and Morley (1938: I3) define a captive figure as: those subsidiary figures, generally though not always bound, in attitudes of degrada- tion (used as pedestals for the principal figures or with hair grasped by the principal figure etc.) or of supplication (kneeling before principal figures etc.) These captive figures or prisoners serve as a symbol of submission to the power of the A Long Count date consists of five units: the number of baktuns (144,000 days), the number of katuns (7,200 days), the number of tuns (360 days), the number of uinals (2o days), and the number of kins (I day). A typical Long Count date (e.g. 9.I2.8.14.0) would be tran- scribed as follows: 9 x I44,000 1,296,ooo days 12 X 7,200 86,400 days 8 x 36o 2,880 days 14 x 20 280 days 0x x o days 1,385,560 days The total number equals the days that have elapsed since a day in 3113 B.C., the base date of Maya chronology.</page><page sequence="3">Plate I Power symbols in the Meroitic south: the temples at Naqa.

Drawing: N. Pyne ruler. Such themes can be grouped into a minimum of three categories which serve to exemplify differential access to power: A. Prisoners as secondary figures Morley and Morley (I938: I2-13) set up subdivisions within this category as follows: I Captive figure behind and at the level of the feet of the principal figure II Captive figure as direct support for the principal figure IV Captive figure in the panel below the principal figure To these categories Satterthwaite (MS.: i) has added three more categories which he noted only at the site of Tikal: V Captive figure on top of round altar, with principal figure on associated stela VI Four captives on periphery of round altar, principal figure on associated stela (as known, only with Type V on top of same altar) VII Captive on top of column altar, no known association with a principal figure Category A (Prisoners as secondary figures) has the widest distribution and the longest duration in all the Classic Maya centres. The captive figure which appears behind the feet of the principal figure (type I) is the earliest form and it is thought to be con- fined to the site of Tikal, where it may be present on five monuments. This type I captive figure is also present on the Leyden Plaque which (among other criteria) led</page><page sequence="8">86 Joyce Marcus Morley and Morley to assign it to Tikal as its place of manufacture. Although type I captive figures appear on some of the earliest monuments at Tikal, this type is also present on the last monument erected at Tikal (Stela i in A.D. 869). The type II captive is particularly common at Naranjo and at north-eastern Peten sites, but it is also known from sites in Campeche and Quintana Roo. Both male and female members of the ruling family appear standing directly on type II captive figures. Elite females appear with type II captives at a few sites, e.g. Naranjo, Coba and Calakmul (Maler I908; Proskouriakoff I964; Ruppert and Denison 1943). Type IV captives also occur with both male and female royalty. Captives of types II and IV seem to occur only on monuments of Late Classic Period date, i.e. A.D. 600-9oo. The captives of type IV (see plate 4) appear at at least ten sites, primarily in the southern Peten and in the Yucatan peninsula. All the prisoners in Category A serve to illustrate the wide distribution of this power symbol and the lengthy duration of the theme - nearly 600 years - in recorded Maya history. Since we have noted that both male and female elite members are shown standing on prisoners, this motif suggests the differential power of the whole ruling class or the royal family and contrasts it with the degraded captive. The pedestal captive figure is a powerful visual image; it operates as a general symbol of power (conqueror or captor v. the conquered or the captive). It may indicate either a specific subjugated people, or a named captive who serves as the physical support of a named royal personage (male or female). Few of the pedestal captives have associated personal names, which may in- crease the likelihood that they represent a defeated town or people, rather than a specific individual. B. Prisoners in the main composition or narrative scene: memorials of conquest For Category B (Prisoners in the main composition or narrative scene: Memorials of Conquest) I have used Morley and Morley's type III, and have added others to it. Captives in Category B include: Type I Captive figure kneeling in front of or behind the principal figure Type II Captive figure sitting in front of the principal figure Type III Captive figure falling back near the principal figure The important event of taking a prisoner always involves male rulers who are dressed in 'warrior' garb, which usually includes a spear held in the right hand and a shield held in the left hand. Captives in Category B usually have several of the following character- istics: (a) they may be held by their hair; (b) they may be bound with rope or cord; (c) they usually have their head lifted upwards gazing at the 'warrior'; (d) the captive may show submission by placing his left hand on his right shoulder (although the reverse is known), or (e) the captive may show submission by touching the flexible shield held by the ruler in 'warrior' garb. These memorials of conquest never involve women as principal characters, although occasionally a woman is shown in the background looking on at the 'capture' (see below). The prisoners in Category B are participants in narrative scenes, in contrast to Category A, where the captives were merely general symbols of power and were not part of the main composition. The prisoners in scenes of conquest, like those in</page><page sequence="9">The iconography of power among the Classic Maya 87 Category A, are often bound with rope, are scantily clad, and are devoid of all symbols of rank and power. In contrast with the prisoners in Category A, prisoners in narrative scenes often have hieroglyphs incised or carved on their thigh or shoulder (see plate 5). These short individualized captions rarely exceed two hieroglyphs; these inscriptions apparently refer to the personal names of individuals captured in battle. Place names or emblem glyphs (Berlin 1958) are associated with the name of the ruler, but emblem glyphs do not occur with these prisoners (see plate 6). It therefore seems likely that their names are personal - not referring to a specific town or people - and that those prisoners who lack incised glyphs were not important enough to be named. In addition to the spear and shield, the ruler-captor may wear a special headdress (incorporating the Mexican year sign and Tlaloc; see for example Lintel 8 from Yax- chilan in Maler 1903) evident in plate 4, or a special shawl (see plate 6). Less frequently a ruler may be shown with a handaxe or a hafted knife (flint or obsidian) such as on Stela I at Balancan-Morales or Lintel 8 at Yaxchilan. Occasionally, an incised 'name' appearing on the body of the captive also appears in the carved hieroglyphic text accompanying the scene. Proskouriakoff (I963: 150) has isolated the Capture glyph (plate 6) which is also usually associated with scenes of capture. Proskouriakoff has noted that the Capture glyph often precedes the name of the prisoner mentioned in the text, which can then be linked to the prisoner in the narrative scene below by the identifying glyph(s) incised on his body. Therefore, we have a replica- tion in text and image: in the hieroglyphic text Ruler X captures Captive Y and in the visual image Ruler X is shown capturing Captive Y. Scenes showing memorials of conquest are present at a select number of Maya sites. Scenes of capture or triumphs of the military are particularly conspicuous at sites near the Usumacinta river, such as Balancan-Morales, Piedras Negras, El Cayo, La Mar, Yaxchilan, and Bonampak. In contrast to Category A (in which captives are unnamed, not included in the main scene, and serve as pedestals for the ruler), the captives in Category B are portrayals of individuals taken in battle. Although royal women are shown standing on prisoners, they are never shown taking captives or holding spears. A royal woman may occasionally be shown holding the shield and helmet for the ruler at her side (e.g. Lintel 26 at Yaxchilan, Proskouriakoff I964). In these cases she might be turning over the war apparel of a captured ruler, or more likely aiding a ruler (her husband?) in his dressing before battle. Such memorials of conquest are particularly common during the eighth century (A.D. 700-800); all of the Usumacinta 'river cities' ceased to erect monuments before A.D. 830. Given the geographical location of these river towns - which lie on the western frontier of the Maya region and are subject to intrusion of distant groups via the Usumacinta drainage system - the bellicose character of their monuments is perhaps not unexpected. Let me add, however, that all captives shown on these monuments have the typical Classic Maya appearance, and they do not appear to constitute a different ethnic group. C. Outdoor galleries Perhaps the greatest displays of power by the Maya occur in their Outdoor Galleries, which constitute my Category C. These Outdoor Galleries are compositions of several</page><page sequence="10">88 Joyce Marcus slabs of stone, all individually carved. Type I consists of Prisoner Staircases, in which recumbent prisoners are portrayed with associated texts; the prisoners may appear on either the riser or the tread of the individual steps. These prisoner staircases also consti- tute a powerful visual and physical pun, in that the steps (and hence the prisoners) are literally trod upon by anyone ascending the staircase. Type II Outdoor Galleries consist of Grouped Prisoners kneeling on individual slabs, which are then assembled into a monumental composition. Few Maya sites have hieroglyphic staircases; examples occur at Copian, Dos Pilas, Tamarindito and Yaxchilan (Morley 92zo; Greene, Rands and Graham 1972; see plates 7, 8). Prisoner staircases often contain information about conquests by several different persons - thereby serving a different function from stelae, which usually record informa- tion concerning the events and feats associated with a single ruler. We might say that prisoner staircases reveal the military exploits witnessed by the site where they appear. Prisoner staircases constitute partial 'site histories', while stelae present 'life' histories of dynastic members. The most famous hieroglyphic staircase is known from Copan. The stairway is composed of sixty-three steps and is Io m. wide. The risers of these steps are carved with nearly 2,500 glyphs. In the centre of every twelfth step are seated anthropomorphic figures, and along the risers of some steps are recumbent prisoners which are similar to the prisoners on the staircases at Dos Pilas and Tamarindito. Captives appear on the staircase at Copan, but they are absent from all other sculpture at Copan. The exceed- ingly few depictions of prisoners in the south-eastern region may reflect the more stable conditions which prevailed there. Copain and other sites in Honduras represent the eastern frontier of the Classic Maya area, and the populations to the east and south offered little threat to the eastern Maya centres. On the other hand, as we have seen, the populations living to the west and north of the Maya river cities were probably a threat for some time. A gallery of Grouped Prisoners (type II) is known from just one Maya centre - Palenque. There, groups of kneeling prisoners are found within the patios (open court- yards) of Palace Houses A and C (de la Fuente I965: 130; Kubler 1962: 79). Prisoners in House A are in groups of five and four each. Those prisoners which serve as the ramps for the stairway have hieroglyphs carved on the front of their loincloths. These short texts frequently commence with a date (Calendar Round), which may correspond to the date of a battle in which the prisoner was captured. In House C, the slabs portraying prisoners alternate with niches which have short texts (four hieroglyphs) which may contain information about the prisoners. It seems noteworthy that the prisoners with hieroglyphs carved on their loincloths (those that flank the stairway) are also the prisoners who wear the most paraphernalia indicative of high rank - usually wearing earplugs, wristlets, necklaces, and headdresses. Therefore, we have differentiation within the line of prisoners; those with hieroglyphs and status paraphernalia may be chiefs or officers of another community, and those scantily clad and lacking identifying captions may be lesser townsmen or villagers.</page><page sequence="11">The iconography of power among the Classic Maya 89 Comparisons with Monte Alban At the Zapotec site of Monte Alban in the valley of Oaxaca (fig. 25) Outdoor Galleries are also known. The famous 'Gallery of the Danzantes' (located in the south-western part of the main plaza) illustrates the Zapotec display of power. These 'rubbery' figures appear on individual slabs; some figures were originally grouped into a planned composi- tion (fig. 26). The figures in the lowest row (i) are often accompanied by very short &lt;7?XS gL 4 1(4; ? (100 2, '. ~\ I I -- Figure 26 Gallery of the Danzantes dates to 450 B.C. This drawing represents the original arrangement of the prisoners. The danzantes in the bottom row are the most important prisoners in the gallery; they are associated with hieroglyphs, special hairstyles or necklaces. The original drawing was made in the field by Agustin Villagra in 1938. Drawing: N. Pyne hieroglyphic captions; these figures might be analogous to the Palenque prisoners which were accompanied by hieroglyphs carved on their loincloths or in associated niches. Note that all the figures in the lowest row are looking to their left; the next higher row (2) consists of horizontal or recumbent figures. The third row includes figures which all face to their right, and the top row again consists of recumbent figures. The second and fourth rows are composed of much smaller stones than the vertical figures in rows i and 3. There are over 3Io danzantes. Various interpretations for them have been suggested: some scholars have interpreted them as swimmers (Villagra I939: 155), as dancers (as the Spanish word implies), or as victims of a variety of pathologies (Davalos Hurtado I95I). All of these speculations seem to be totally unfounded. The interpretation pre- sented by Michael Coe (I962: 95) appears to be most consistent with what we know about early Mesoamerican civilizations. He suggests that:</page><page sequence="12">go Joyce Marcus the distorted pose of the limbs, the open mouth and closed eyes indicate that these [danzantes] are corpses, undoubtedly chiefs or kings slain by the earliest rulers of Monte Alban. Since we find similar configurations or galleries in the Maya lowlands, Monte Alban may well have provided a prototype for the conventionalized display of prisoners and general symbols of power. On ceramic and architectural grounds the danzantes in this planned gallery can be dated to the Monte Alban I period, i.e. 450 B.C. (Caso 1947: 7). A large proportion of carved danzantes are re-used in structures of later date, but the danzante gallery presents fairly conclusive evidence that the configuration drawn in fig. 26 was the original plan for at least some of the danzantes. Other similarities to the Maya can be listed: the danzantes are nude or scantily clad; some of the more important prisoners (those with special hairstyles or wearing a neck- lace etc.) are associated with hieroglyphic captions; they are awkward in their position; they are grouped into monumental galleries open to the air; they occur on the risers of steps leading to important public or religious buildings (see plate 9). The danzantes or prisoner slabs which appear on the staircases at Monte Albain are probably re-used, and the structures they are associated with are of different dates, e.g. System M (dating to A.D. 700 at the latest), and the Building of the danzantes (Monte Alban I or 450 B.c.). These prisoners at Monte Alban were also 'trod upon'. The earlier date for these Oaxaca monuments suggests that Prisoner Galleries and perhaps even Prisoner Staircases may not have originated in the Maya area. At any rate, the themes of conquest and the desire to display power tie the two regions together. It is noteworthy that the 3 10 or more danzantes which appear during Monte Alban I constitute 80% of the total monument record from that site. In other words, it was during the initial occupation of Monte Alban that the effort devoted to carving monu- mental figures was the greatest. This early effort probably coincides with the time when the rulers of Monte Albain would have felt the greatest need to legitimize their power and sanctify their position. Perhaps by creating a large gallery of prisoners, they were able to convince both their enemies and their own population of their power, although it was not yet institutionalized or completely effective. During Monte Alban II there are approximately forty carved stones which have been interpreted as 'conquest slabs' (Caso I947). During Period IlIA there are less than twenty monuments known, but the majority of these stelae involve bound prisoners (see Stela 3 in fig. 27). Two possible trends are therefore apparent: (I) the dominant theme throughout Monte Alban's history was the display of power by portraying bound or slain prisoners, but (2) through time there seems to be a marked.decrease in the effort expended for monumental works of art expressing themes of militarism. The estab- lishment or legitimization of the elite of Monte Alban was perhaps expressed most abundantly by the 3o10 danzantes, the largest single corpus of monuments known any- where in the Pre-Classic period in Mesoamerica. Stela 3, set in the wall of the South Platform at Monte Alban and dating to Period IIIA (fig. 27), depicts an important prisoner with arms bound with cord behind his back. He is wearing an opossum (?) mask and standing on a place glyph (Caso I947). The associated dates and hieroglyphs may contain information about his name, the date of</page><page sequence="13">The iconography of power among the Classic Maya 91 Figure 27 Stela 3 from Monte Alban, Oaxaca dates to c. A.D. 300. A masked prisoner is shown with his arms bound behind his back. The associated hieroglyphs contain dates and perhaps names. The prisoner is standing on a place glyph which presumably conveys his place of origin. (After Caso 1928: fig. 32.) Drawing: N. Pyne. 227 x xo6 cm. his capture and his place of origin. Prisoners on Period IIIA stelae at Monte Alban were probably important officers of subject or enemy towns, and were clearly of higher rank than the danzantes, who were often unnamed and devoid of all symbols of rank and power. One strong contrast between the Zapotec and the Maya is the lack of stelae dedicated to local Monte Alban rulers (possible exceptions being stelae i and 4; Caso 1928). One possible explanation might be that the need for displaying military power preoccupied the Zapotec more than the need to portray rulers. The Maya on the other hand show a greater preoccupation with listing the ancestral ties of the claimant to the throne, i.e. legitimizing the ruler, and with presenting his major political and military feats.</page><page sequence="14">92 Joyce Marcus The artistic conventions for the Maya ruler The Classic theme of the Maya monuments is the portrayal of individual rulers (Pros- kouriakoff 1950: 4) accompanied by a hieroglyphic text which usually provides us with historical information (i.e. when the ruler was born, when he acceded to the throne etc.) and sometimes brief reports about his military triumphs, e.g. 'captor of . Through Proskouriakoff's study (I960) we also know that the office of rulership was hereditary, and that many of the so-called 'astronomical' texts actually constitute dynas- tic history. However, we can also learn a great deal about the symbolic paraphernalia of the Maya rulers by contrasting their garb with that of the individuals they have captured or hold as prisoners. The ruler usually has a very conventionalized face (although the conven- tion varies from area to area) characterized by serenity, formality and rigidity. This is in conspicuous contrast to the prisoners who are often grimacing, contorted, tense and generally expressive of suspended struggle. The serenity and formality of the office of rulership is pronounced and emphasized when the ruler is juxtaposed with a struggling captive. If there is any evidence for individual portraiture in Maya art, it is the prisoners rather than the rulers who seem likely candidates. We do know who some of the Maya rulers are, but not from their individual facial features. Only after we have associated each ruler with a particular hieroglyphic 'name' and noted perhaps his distinctive headdress, are we likely to recognize him in other contexts. Without the hieroglyphic texts, associated dates and events, it would be extremely difficult to prove that two individuals on two different monuments were the same ruler; clearly, individuality or photographic likeness was not desired. The artist was less restrained by convention when he set his efforts to carving the prisoners, whose anguished expression (plate 5) and acts of struggle (e.g. Lintel 8, Yaxchilan) serve to underscore the restrained and royal carriage of the Maya ruler. Conclusions i Themes of prisoners or military triumphs characterize early Mesoamerican states, perhaps especially during periods when they wished to appear in possession of powers which in fact were not yet completely secure and institutionally effective. 2 Visual puns were a favourite device used by the Maya and Zapotec to communicate the power of the ruling class. Prisoners were often in the lower register of the stela, were depicted as the direct support of rulers, or were literally trod upon when they appeared on the risers or treads of staircases. 3 The contrast between the serene and formal pose of the well-attired ruler and the grimacing, scantily-clad captive perhaps serves as a model of the Maya's differentiated hierarchical structure. There is gradation or ranking indicated in the presentation of prisoners as well, perhaps indicating captured rulers v. captured townsmen or villagers. 4 Hieroglyphic writing seems to caption and replicate the information conveyed in portrayals of conquest.</page><page sequence="15">The iconography of power among the Classic Maya 93 Acknowledgements I would especially like to thank Merle Greene for supplying me with plates 4 to 8, which are photographs of her rubbings that appear in Maya Sculpture from the Southern Lowlands, Highlands, and Pacific Piedmont (Greene, Rands and Graham, 1972).
