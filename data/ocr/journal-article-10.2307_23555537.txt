<plain_text><page sequence="1">THEOLOGICAL CORRECTNESS: COGNITIVE CON STRAINT AND THE STUDY OF RELIGION Justin L. Barrett In both natural and religious thinking, people have multiple versions of the same concepts that may be contradictory. In the domain of religious concepts, these multiple levels of representation in single individuals may be termed "Theological Correctness. " Versions of religious concepts range from fairly simple or concrete to very complex and abstract. Selection of the concept to be used in any given context is largely dependent on the cognitive processing demands of the task. In tasks in which there is great demand to draw quick and rich inferences, a basic concept comprised largely of intuitive knowledge, is used. In tasks in which there is less demand, as when one is slowly and carefully reflecting on one's knowledge, more complicated, intuition violating theoretical concepts may be drawn upon. In the domain of religious concepts these concepts closely match traditional theology and so may be termed theological concepts. Implications for data gathering and theorizing in the study of religion are discussed. Finally, these observations suggest the importance of insights from cognitive science for the study of religion. 1. Introduction Scientists have taught us that the earth spins on its axis while revolv ing around the sun. We all "know" this on some level. But how many of us, scientists or not, use this knowledge when figuring where the sun will be at dusk? We don't estimate the relative location of the sun by calculating the earth's rotation and how much we will move. Rather, we solve the problem quite easily by pretending (and, at some level, actually believing) the sun does the moving. Similarly, how many of us who work with computers talk to them, shout at them, and think they're out to get us or just don't like us; even though we know perfectly well the computer is not an intentional being? These examples illustrate a well-known but little-discussed phe nomenon in academic circles: what we say we think and know and what we think and know in real-time problem solving sometimes are two entirely different things. The simplest explanation of this incon sistency is cognitive constraint, usually in the form of processing limi Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 1999 Method &amp; Theory in the Study of Relimon 11,325-339</page><page sequence="2">326 JUSTIN L. BARRETT tations. Understanding the sun as moving makes it computationally easier to estimate future relative locations of the sun than under standing or mentally representing us as moving relative to it. In the case of computers, sometimes their inexplicable actions are quickly and easily explained by representing them as intentional agents like humans. Thinking through the complexities of a computer's hard ware, software, and inputs may yield a more precise explanation for its "strange behavior," but coming to a satisfactory explanation is much slower and cognitively burdensome. People have built-in cognitive biases that make some concepts and causal relationships easier to use than others (Sperber, Premack and Premack 1995). The consequence, in many cases, is parallel levels of understanding or representation of the same phenomenon that may be contradictory: the theoretical level and the basic level; the level used in formal discourse and careful reflection, and the level used on the-fly to solve problems quickly. If these same cognitive biases operate on religious concepts (which they do), then the same parallel, potentially contradictory, represen tations may appear in religious thought (which they do). If religious knowledge is like other knowledge, it will have a theoretical or theo logical level of representation and a basic level of representation. I term the coexistence of multiple levels of representations of religious concepts or relations "Theological Correctness" or "T.C.," because when beliefs about God or other religious concepts are reflected on, they tend to be reported as more similar to dominant theological dogma, than the gut-level, basic concepts used in more mundane behavior.1 I propose one may think of religious concepts as lying on a con tinuum of abstractness or cognitive complexity. Orthodox theological dogma of a tradition or culture (typically) anchors the complex end of the continuum. On the simple or concrete end is naive intuitive knowledge about things in the world and the causal relationships that govern them. In between these endpoints lie religious concepts as actually represented by individuals and groups of individuals. They range between the two anchors depending on the cognitive demands 1 The distinction between basic and theological concepts should not be confused with the distinction between good and bad theology or between what the clergy think versus what the laity think. Basic and theological versions of the same concepts are likely to be used by all members of a religious community depending on the context and ability to deal with cognitive demands of the context.</page><page sequence="3">THEOLOGICAL CORRECTNESS 327 of a particular context. Theological concepts, near the theological dogma end, are concepts with less time-intensive cognitive demands. Basic religious concepts, near the intuitive knowledge end, are con cepts used to solve problems quickly when efficiency is needed be cause of task demands. This continuum is illustrated in Figure 1.

Evidence for theological correctness Anecdotal observations suggesting theological correctness (T.C.) per meate religious life. Among Christians, God is simultaneously non physical, formless, and omnipresent; but also occasionally thought of as an old man living in the clouds, as these statements from devout Protestants reveal: "When I pray? Well, I normally, I just think about like ... a human being, like a typical human being, long hair and the beard, and I think of on a cloud up in Heaven, and just, like, listening." "I just kind of always picture God as like an old man, you know, white hair ... kind of old, I mean, but I know that's not true." (Barrett and VanOrman 1996: 44) That God is conceptualized as having a single physical location is also suggested by the not uncommon practice of directing prayers for God to the sky, as if God lives up there. I have even heard God referred to as the "Big Guy in the sky." Contradictions regarding God's properties may extend beyond physicality if the following anecdote is at all generalizable. In the course of therapy, psychologist Ana Maria Rizzuto had the opportu</page><page sequence="4">328 JUSTIN L. BARRETT nity to observe a contradiction in how a priest represented God along personality or dispositional dimensions: To my amazement some of his words about his father coincided with his earlier description of his God. However, as a well-educated priest, he spoke of God as loving, caring and as having ail the attributes ascribed to him by Roman Catholic theology as a good father. I real ized that my unusual patient was caught between two contradictory representations of his God. The God of the priest was loving, patient, and gende. The God of the man was critical, stern, and demanding. (Rizzuto 1980: 118) Parallel, incongruent concepts of the Christian God might not be the only religious concepts that have multiple levels of representation. An acquaintance of mine once perturbed her family by insisting on driv ing far out of her way to pray for a sick dog. While she "knows," theologically, that prayer efficacy in healing is not dependent on proximity with the sick individual, on a gut or basic level she could not help but "know" that being in the same room and physically contacting ("laying hands on") the sick animal would be more potent. Likewise, a Calvinist friend who is a theological determinist when it comes to religious conversion, was involved for several years in an evangelistic ministry, trying to persuade others to follow Jesus—act ing and representing the people she worked with as if they actually have any freedom in the matter. Fortunately, such anecdotes are not the only evidence for T.C. Recent experimental studies support the claim that religious con cepts, like non-religious ones, are subject to cognitive constraints con sistent with intuitive or folk knowledge, the consequence of this con straint being a chasm between theological concepts and basic concepts. In contexts that demand using a god concept for rapid generation of inferences or predictions, the abstract, theological properties of gods that characterize reflective discourse disappear (Barrett 1998; Barrett and Keil 1996; Barrett and VanOrman 1996). In these experiments adult participants of several faith traditions in the United States and India were asked to use their concepts of the divine to comprehend and remember short stories about one of a number of gods (varying with faith tradition). How participants misremembered the narratives to resolve ambiguities was taken as a measure of the god concept used. For example, one story was: A boy was swimming alone in a swift and rocky river. The boy got his left leg caught between two large, gray rocks and couldn't get out.</page><page sequence="5">THEOLOGICAL CORRECTNESS 329 Branches of trees kept bumping into him as they hurried past. He thought he was going to drown and so he began to struggle and pray. Though God was answering another prayer in another part of the world when the boy started praying, before long God responded by pushing one of the rocks so the boy could get his leg out. The boy struggled to the river bank and fell over exhausted.2 Subjects whose basic god concept is anthropomorphic might infer that God finished answering one prayer before attending to the boy. If so, they would tend to misreport that this is actually what the story said. Subjects using a god concept in which God performs many tasks simultaneously would be unlikely to report that the story said God finished answering one prayer before saving the boy. It is just as likely that God rescued the boy while answering the other prayer. The results of the narrative comprehension task suggested that, when processing stories, adults tend to use a concept of God having few abstract, "god-like" properties. Rather, participants quite readily attributed to God properties such as having a limited focus of atten tion, having fallible perceptual systems, not knowing everything, and having a single location in space and time. In contrast, when these same participants were asked to reflect on what properties they be lieved God has using questionnaires, they reverted back to the theo logically correct, abstract: God is all-knowing, has infallible percep tion, has no single physical location, has unlimited attention, and so forth. Slightly modifying the cognitive demands of the task by re minding participants of their beliefs in theologically correct proper ties lessened the tendency to discard the T.C. properties in favor of a more anthropomorphic concept. Control experiments successfully ruled out artifacts of the narratives as the cause of the differences between self-reported concepts and concepts used to process the nar ratives. When cognitive demands were grossly simplified, the errors disappeared (Barrett and Keil 1996, Experiment 2). These data suggest that the processing demands of a context might, in part, influence how abstract, or cognitively cumbersome, a concept can be. Much as how scientific knowledge is frequently pared-down or abandoned in real-time, everyday problem solving, theological concepts are simplified for processing efficiency when needed. 2 For Hindu subjects in India, "God" was replaced by "Shiva," "Krishna," "Brah man," or "Vishnu." No differences were detected among these different forms.</page><page sequence="6">330 JUSTIN L. BARRETT 3. Why does theological correctness exist? The anecdotal and experimental evidence taken together strongly support the conclusion that theological correctness is a real phenom enon in religious concepts. Individuals and groups may simultane ously hold at least two different levels of the same religious concept (e.g., concept of God), even if these versions are incongruent or con tradictory. The theological level is more similar to traditionally held theology than the basic level and is used in contemplative discourse. The basic level is used automatically, without reflection, to solve problems and do work in everyday activities. But why T.C.? Why not use the same concept regardless of context? Advances in the field of cognitive development have recently im plicated enormous stores of naive or intuitive knowledge that people of all cultures studied have by early childhood regarding the proper ties of different classes of things (e.g., artifacts, animals, persons) and different modes of causal explanation (e.g., mechanistic, social; Hirschfeld and Gelman 1994; Sperber, Premack and Premack 1995). These elaborate cognitive structures bias the formation of concepts and processing of information, even if concepts are fantastic or novel (Ward 1994). For instance, once people identify something as an animal, they will intuitively assume that it was born, is developing, has nutritional needs, moves, has major sense organs, and has inter nal parts that make it go. They don't have to explicitly encode any of these properties. They are a part of human naive biological knowl edge (Simons and Keil 1995). By filling in all of this information without having to find it out by experience, intuitive cognitive struc tures efficiently inform concepts. However, these structures also con strain concepts. If someone does happen across an animal that does not move or have major sense organs, he or she might fail to (cor rectly) identify it as an animal, or might incorrectly assume that it does move. Similarly, religious concepts the world over are informed and con strained by intuitive knowledge (Boyer 1994). For example, since gods are intentional agents, willful initiators of action, the default assumptions used to conceptualize them is intuitive knowledge about agents, or naive psychology (Lawson and McCauley 1990). So it is no surprise that the basic concepts of participants in the experiments sketched above were found to reflect many of the assumptions of human agents—the prototypical intentional agent.</page><page sequence="7">THEOLOGICAL CORRECTNESS 331 Religious concepts only differ cognitively from ordinary concepts by a few minor violations of intuitive assumptions (Boyer 1994, 1995). While making religious concepts more salient (Sperber 1994), these violations of intuitive assumptions put particular strain on processing systems. For example, intuitive knowledge of animals in cludes that animals struggle to stay alive. Encountering the concept of an animal that does not care about survival disrupts intuitive thought about what motivates animal behavior. A normal animal threatened by mortal danger will typically flee or fight in order to survive. But what of this new animal? The uncertainties in predicting or explaining behaviors and characteristics presented by nonintuitive properties, the inferential gaps, force more complicated, more delib erate processing of information. Increasing the cognitive burden of conceptualizing a thing by vio lating intuitive assumptions carries a price in all contexts, but it is especially serious when a situation demands quick and efficient inter pretation, information gathering, or prediction. In processing tasks, such as a narrative comprehension task, when concepts are used to do cognitive work, concepts that have intuitive violations, as religious concepts often do, will be difficult to maintain consistently. Thus, many of the nonintuitive elements might be ignored for the sake of processing efficiency. In slowed-down, reflective tasks that ask for commentary on a concept instead of use of a concept, the non intuitive features may be maintained. The consequence is theological correctness. In the case of concepts of God, many theologies teach about a god that violates many intuitive assumptions: an actor with no physical properties, an agent with no attentional or perceptual limitations, a "living" being that can never die and is outside historical time. These types of properties make for difficult inference generation in many everyday, information processing tasks. So, the theological God con cept is simplified into something more manageable: the basic con cept, with all of its mundane, intuitive properties, like a person. Likewise, in thought about the natural world, science has offered us many cognitively complex and sometimes counterintuitive expla nations of the way things are. The slow, steady, systematic nature of scientific and philosophical inquiry makes these concepts possible. But in real-time problem solving—as when quickly trying to estimate the sun's position at 4:30 p.m.—scientific knowledge is often too cumbersome to use and so basic knowledge of a phenomenon is used instead.</page><page sequence="8">332 JUSTIN L. BARRETT Referring back to the continuum in Figure 1, basic concepts and theological concepts can be understood as differing not only in de gree of similarity to theological tradition and in degree of complexity, but also in degree of the demands of the context in which they are used. In situations in which few if any inferences need to be drawn, and those that are drawn can be done slowly and carefully, the concept used will be more T. C. In contexts that demand immediate inference generation, concepts will be less T. C. and more similar to intuitive knowledge. Along this dimension, the differences are quan titative. Different cognitive tasks have graded differences in demand; demand produced by the nature of the task and by context factors such as physiological states of persons, distractions, urgency of situa tion, and having to perform multiple tasks at the same time. Thus, the line between theological concepts and basic concepts is hazy. 4. Implications of theological correctness for the scientific study of religion 4.1 Potential for misrepresentation ofphenomena Suppose some scholars wanted to know what I think about the na ture of a computer. Since I know computers are complicated elec tronic machines that are programmed with particular instructions, I might talk about how computers are tools that do what they are told. Their only sources of input are the keyboard and other electronic channels such as a disk drive. They have no senses, emotions, desires, or thoughts of their own. Based on these data, the inquiring scholars might be able to tell a fairly coherent story about how I understand computers; but based on what I told them, they would have the story wrong in some important ways, and not because I tried to deceive them. On a particularly hectic morning, I might talk to my compu ter, ask it questions, shout at it, and so forth. I will implicitly attribute to it desires, perception, and thoughts of its own. A complete account of how I understand computers must take this real-time interaction into account. At some level, in some situations, I represent my com puter as an intentional agent, much like a person. Likewise, when seeking a full understanding of an individual's or group of individuals' religious understandings, scholars must get be yond reflective reports of belief, including texts, and systematically observe how religious concepts are used to shape action, generate predictions, and undergird explanations. Focus on just the theologi</page><page sequence="9">THEOLOGICAL CORRECTNESS 333 cal level could lead to serious distortions of which concepts are actu ally important in everyday life. Now suppose that another group of scholars wants to know what my son knows about the physical properties of a baseball in flight. My young son will not be able to tell them much. But would it be correct to conclude my son knows nothing about the physical proper ties of a baseball? Hardly. He knows that a ball will move on a continuous inertial path. He knows that a ball will not pass through a stationary solid object of a sufficient mass. He knows a ball will eventually fall to the ground. How do I know he knows so much about the physical properties of a baseball in flight? Because carefully controlled experiments have revealed that infants know this much about physical objects (Spelke, Phillips, and Woodward 1995). While young children and adults often cannot articulate their knowledge, their ability to solve problems, their reactions to seemingly impossible states of affairs, and their actions in everyday tasks provide evidence of this tacit knowledge. In order for my son to successfully catch or hit a baseball, he must know some things about its physical proper ties. Neglecting this behavioral evidence would grossly distort an ac count of what he knows about physical objects in flight. Reflective, theoretical knowledge is not the only type of relevant knowledge. Again, the lesson for the study of religion is straightforward. Schol ars who study religion run the risk of underestimating or oversimpli fying religious knowledge if they do not take into account basic level conceptualizations. A dearth of reflectively accessible knowledge does not entail simple or vacuous basic level religious concepts. Much that is known or taught is never stated explicitly. It does not need to be stated because intuitive assumptions fill in the gaps (Sperber 1996). On the other hand, considering only basic level concepts runs some of the same risks. It could be concluded wrongly that a group of people have much more explicit theological knowledge than they actually do. Similarly, if the basic and theological levels contradict each other, any generalizations made by looking solely at basic level concepts will not do justice to understanding a group's sincere theo logical confessions. Both levels are important for a complete under standing of an individual's or a group's religious beliefs and understandings. Failing to take into account Theological Correctness may also in appropriately lead to the conclusion that individuals or groups have a wildly inconsistent theological system. Contradictions commonly oc</page><page sequence="10">334 JUSTIN L. BARRETT cur in the representation of religious concepts in a single community or individual. For example, many North American Christians main tain that God is formless and omnipresent but then speak of God (and reason about God) as if God is sitting on a throne in the sky. While these occurrences could be explained by simply having an inconsistent system of thought, poor understanding of what is ortho dox, or social pressures, another potential explanation in some situa tions is Theological Correctness. Depending on the cognitive de mands of a task and the cognitive resources individuals have available to deal with the demands, the concept may appear radically different. 4.2 Potential for misleading comparisons Considering both levels of conceptualization could also prevent erro neous comparisons between groups or individuals. When doing com parative religion by focusing on the theological level of understand ing, one runs the risk of overestimating differences across faiths, cultures, generations, and individuals. Not only are reflective state ments about religious beliefs highly pressured by tradition, occasion, and audience, but they also obscure potential similarities in basic concepts. For example, clearly differences between how the gods of Hinduism are understood by Hindus and how the God of Christian ity is understood by Christians are numerous on the theological level. However, when reading a story about a god, both Hindus and Chris tians appear to use strikingly similar concepts (Barrett 1998). Since they are tied to intuitive knowledge, basic level concepts are more stable across groups than are theological concepts. The flip-side is underestimating the importance of differences in religious concepts across groups and individuals by ignoring theological concepts. Comparative studies can also suffer by mistakenly comparing the theological level of one group or tradition with the basic level of another, and concluding that one faith has more concrete or anthro pomorphic beliefs than another. Again, using devotional Hinduism as an example, Christians have long ridiculed Hindus for their elabo rate use of concrete images, citing this as evidence that Hindus wor ship human-like gods and not the true Supreme Being who is wholly different from the created world and cannot be represented by hu man-like forms (Mukherji 1947). This comparison is drawn from an examination of Hindu basic level concepts and Christian theological</page><page sequence="11">THEOLOGICAL CORRECTNESS 335 level concepts: comparing apples with oranges. Taking into account T.C., it may be that Christians and Hindus typically conceptualize gods quite similarly—anthropomorphically—on the basic level; and on the theological level the chief difference is over how acceptable it is to concretely depict the Wholly Other in natural forms. A fair comparison must be consistent with level of analysis. 4.3 Need to use appropriate data for the level in question Another implication of T.C. is the necessity to specify which level is being studied and to use data appropriate to the level. Just as it is misleading to take the stated beliefs and practices of theologians or clergy as representative of all believers, statements about beliefs should not be used to make observations about what people think in other contexts. Measuring theological level concepts is relatively straightforward. Just ask. By definition, theological concepts are directly accessible through self-report, questionnaires, surveys, and recording discourse. As with any communication, potential biases due to context effects should be taken into account, and these problems should not be trivialized. However, barring these problems, all of the verbal sources of data listed above are appropriate evidence for falsifying theories pertaining to theological level concepts in groups and individuals. Appropriate data for exploring basic level concepts may come from any number of techniques that measure features of concepts while they are in use. These tasks may include nearly any situation in which people are not asked to merely reflect on their concepts. The narrative comprehension task fits this description because it requires participants to use their concepts of God to understand and remem ber the narratives. Other ways to study basic level god concepts might be carefully observing and analyzing the types of actions peo ple ask God to perform through prayer and asking people to create stories about God. Sometimes measures of basic concepts may use verbal or written responses. In exploring basic understandings of prayer, asking how individuals might pray in carefully constructed situations might serve as a suitable measure. For learning about people's intuitive notions about rituals one might ask for judgments of ritual efficacy for a variety of hypothetical actions (e.g., Barrett and Lawson 1999). Note that measures may use verbal or written responses from individuals</page><page sequence="12">336 JUSTIN L. BARRETT as long as what is being asked is not a direct reflection on what their concepts are. While not ideal, it is acceptable to ask how one might pray when confronted with a hungry-looking bear in a forest, but asking directly what petitionary prayer is used taps the theological level of conceptualization. Developing these measures is an ongoing struggle but worth the effort if we are to gain a more complete and accurate understanding of religious ideas and practices. 4.4 Theological correctness and social distribution of concepts The distribution and spread of beliefs, belief systems, and religious practices may be influenced by a large number of social, political, and geographical factors. This is not news. Cognition also non-trivi ally constrains which religious ideas and practices are successfully spread and transmitted in which contexts (Boyer 1994; Sperber 1996). For example, information consistent with culturally informed schema more accurately survives transmission than anti-schematic information (Bartlett 1932; Bransford and McCarrell 1974). More simply, information with familiar concepts, organization, and themes is more easily remembered and passed on. Culturally informed schema may just be the most obvious way individual cognition informs transmission. As noted above, develop mental psychologists have discovered vast amounts of evidence that under normal developmental conditions young children, apparently independent of culture but not experience, acquire sets of intuitive knowledge structures that undergird concept formation (Keil 1989). If one encounters events or ideas that too radically counter the biases of these knowledge structures, memory for the events or ideas are likely to be poor. These concepts will have less probability of surviv ing transmission (Sperber 1994; Boyer 1995). To illustrate: a dog that can be in more than one place at a time, never requires nourishment to survive, and can only remember things that never happened, is a concept that is unlikely to survive in any culture because it violates intuitive assumptions about bounded physical objects, living things, and psychological beings. What T. C. adds to these observations about cognitive constraint is that religious concepts with a large number of nonintuitive features will be more successfully transmitted in contexts of low cognitive demand or in situations that provide many memory aids. That is, successful transmission of concepts will vary depending on the gen</page><page sequence="13">THEOLOGICAL CORRECTNESS 337 eral cognitive demands of the transmission context. If a person tries to master a concept slowly, using a carefully written text with helpful illustrations, reasonably accurate transmission may be likely. The same information presented quickly, orally, with many background distractions, while the receiver is performing multiple other tasks, is less likely to be transmitted successfully. That much is fairly straight forward. What T. C. predicts is that excessive nonintuitive compo nents of the information being presented is what will be lost first. The dog that can be in more than one place at a time, never requires nourishment to survive, and can only remember things that never happened is likely to be reduced to something like a dog that has a single location, rarely requires nourishment, and has a peculiar memory systems ("but I don't quite remember how it was unique To rescue complicated religious concepts from being pared down during transmission because of cognitive demands, memory aids may become institutionalized in a religious system. For example, cultures that transmit important but complicated religious concepts during rituals might make the rituals extremely frequent so as to successfully transmit the otherwise vulnerable concepts. Alternatively, they might create an environment that is extremely arousing since great stress facilitates accurate memory of events (Whitehouse 1995, 1996). An other handy mnemonic is to write the complicated stuff down; thus religious texts are important. 4.5 Need for cognitive theories If basic level concepts are tied to intuitive knowledge, theories of religious concepts and actions will greatly benefit from the growing body of research on intuitive knowledge—the cognitive development of concepts and categories. Understanding how human cognition is biased to entertain some concepts over others, for instance, is one piece of any account of why some religious concepts are entertained over others. Understanding why people conceive of supernatural cau sation the way they do is prefaced on why people conceive of any causation the way they do. Understanding why people think about God they way they do is informed by an understanding of why people think about any intentional being the way they do. Fortu nately, the importance of cognitive science in the study of religion has not been completely neglected: Pascal Boyer's cognitive account of</page><page sequence="14">338 JUSTIN L. BARRETT how intuitive knowledge structures help select which religious con cepts will be transmitted from generation to generation; Stewart Guthrie's cognitive account of how the attribution of natural events to the activity of gods; and E. Thomas Lawson and Robert McCauley's theory for how cognitive structures inform ritual prac tices model how cognitive theories might be fashioned (Boyer 1994; Guthrie 1993; Lawson and McCauley 1990). 5. Conclusion Often, scholars of religion implicitly assume overly simplistic and inaccurate models of human minds. More sophisticated understand ings of human cognition is needed to prevent errors in data gathering and theory development. In both natural and religious thinking, people have multiple levels of representation or conceptualization that may be contradictory. These concepts range from fairly simple or concrete to very complex and abstract. Selection of the concept to be used in any given context is largely dependent on the cognitive processing demands of the task. In tasks in which there is great demand to draw quick and precise inferences, a basic concept, comprised largely of intuitive knowledge is used. In tasks in which there is less demand, as when one is slowly and carefully reflecting on one's knowledge, more complicated, intui tion-violating theoretical concepts may be drawn upon. In the do main of religious concepts these concepts closely match traditional theology and so may be termed theological concepts. Any theory that attempts to explain religious concepts must account for the presence of these multiple levels of explanation, or risk gross distortions of the phenomena under scrutiny. Finally, these observations suggest the importance of insights from cognitive science on the study of religion. Calvin College References Barrett, Justin L. (1998).
