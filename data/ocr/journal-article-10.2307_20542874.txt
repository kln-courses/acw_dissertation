On the migration period, Gowland compares the variability of age and gender between late Roman and early Anglo-Saxon cemeteries. Objects interpreted previously as asserting ethnic identity may in fact have related more closely to age and gender identity. Williams (in Archaeological Review from Cambridge) stresses the theatrical quality of early burial rites; emotive gestures, such as the breaking of weapons, played a role in what may well have been regarded as a strongly transformative ritual. In a complementary piece (in Anglo-Saxon Studies in Archaeology and History), he suggests a specific role for tweezers and razors among grave goods; notably widespread in cremations of young adults, the deposition of such items by mourners may have effected symbolic mediation between the living and the dead. Fern observes the quite widespread inclusion of horse remains in early funerary practices. Their role in cremations occurs at a wide range of social levels, unprecedented elsewhere in Europe. The place-name element hearg, conventionally inter preted as 'pagan temple' or 'sanctuary', is reassessed by Semple. Correlating with only limited early medieval archaeological evidence, such place-names seem rather to have denoted sites with a deeper, Iron Age or earlier history, which were topographically distinctive. On the location of early funerary sites, Brookes links the distribution in Kent with route ways, particularly those of Roman origin. The driving priority may have been the visibility of funerary monuments in a predominantly wooded landscape. Stoodley traces the chro nology of two cemeteries at Portway, Andover; rather than a consequence of conversion, the shift to the new cemetery at Portway West may have represented an effort to demarcate a territorial boundary. Several items report the excavation of early cemeteries. That by Patrick et al. concerns a sixth-century inhumation cemetery at Gunthorpe, Peterborough; Dickinson describes a site of similar characteristics at Quarrington, near Sleaford. The mixed rite cemetery at Alwalton, near Peterborough, is interpreted by Gibson as possibly reflecting use by two separate communities. Newton reports a small group of burials, probably from the end of the conversion period, at Barnwell Road, Cambridge. The stratification of burial in the later Anglo-Saxon period continues to receive atten tion. Buckberry explores the wide range of practices which could elevate a grave's status, from special coffins to grave covers and markers. Certain high-status cemeteries, such as those at York, Gloucester or Winchester, exhibited this range to the full, with a far higher percentage of more elaborate graves. Holloway examines burials that included a layer of charcoal at deposition; possibly associated with purity or cleanliness, the practice was again most common at high-status urban minsters. Cherryson highlights the high level of grave disturbance in the later Anglo-Saxon period when compared with the reverence for funerary sites in the seventh and eighth centuries. The pattern may be best explained by evolving restrictions on burial rights which had the effect of centralizing burial, as well as ? Economic History Society 2009.

Hadley notes a parallel trend in the tendency for certain rural cemeteries to become abandoned, perhaps reflecting a shift from ephemeral, non-churchyard burials to sites associated with minsters and thegnly churches. Buckberry and Hadley reinterpret the long-lived cemetery at Walkington Wold in east Yorkshire as an execution cemetery, elevating its importance, as the only known example from northern England. The pattern of 'Viking' burials with grave goods is reassessed by Harrison: conventionally interpreted as bearing transient features, associated with sea routes, their distribution shows a stronger relationship with indigenous sites, and may reflect negotiation at local level with existing communities. On towns and trade, Hodges reviews the impact of archaeological discoveries on the understanding of early urban sites. At Hamwic and Lundenwic one-fifth of all pottery finds were Frankish imports; the distribution of cattle bones suggests a well-managed system of livestock distribution. The evidence for Mercian fortified places is reassessed by Bassett. Strata at Hereford, Tamworth, and Winchcombe are interpreted as indicating ramparts and defensive ditches of middle Saxon date, which might well been replicated at other unex cavated midlands centres. Such a wider network would also have fulfilled administrative and economic functions, acting as a means of political control. McLeod examines the logistics of provisioning Viking armies in the ninth century. Food obtained by peace treaty and from captured royal vills would have supplemented instances of direct seizure, sup porting the case for armies of substantial size. Fleming amasses considerable evidence for the use and exchange of silk in the later Anglo-Saxon period, primarily in contexts of clothing and display. The trading network extended as far as Byzantium and Syria; its scale attests to the strength of elite conspicuous consumption. Related patterns are observed by Gautier, suggesting an important role for deer parks as an aristocratic resource before the Norman Conquest. With examples used by the Godwine family, hunting emerges as an area of more continuous elite practice. On landscape and settlement, Griffith and Wilkes highlight the preponderance of place names implying a maritime perspective in the South Hams region of Devon. The pattern suggests Anglo-Saxon inhabitants accustomed to travelling by sea along the coast. Harding notes the high incidence of the place-name elements 'carr' and 'holm' in the Wirral, consistent with large-scale Norse immigration to the area in the early tenth century. Spoerry and Hinman report a sunken-featured building and other early medieval elements at Fowlmere, Cambridgeshire. Kenyon and Watts describe a sequence of two substantial enclosures at Lower Slaughter, Gloucestershire. Of middle and late Saxon date, the findings correlate with charter evidence for a royal estate-centre. In the area of law, Jurasinski reinterprets a section of King Athelberht's code to describe penalties for blows struck as slaps. A concern with the visibility of such injuries suggests that the offence had particular associations with disgrace. Rabin reviews the evidence for individuals as advocate in Anglo-Saxon legal disputes. The role involved intercession on behalf of a party who tended to be of lesser or vulnerable status, though the practice seems to have intensified from the late tenth century onwards. In recorded instances, such action often required deft interplay between customary practice and written documentation. Lavelle examines the property holding of king's wives in the later Anglo-Saxon period. The charter evidence relates not to queenly demesne but to land granted to individual wives, often as widows. The overlapping careers of royal women supports a picture of fluidity and complexity. On coinage, Metcalf supplies a catalogue of runic 'sceatta' coins of types Rl and R2, suggesting London as the best option for a possible minting site. Lyons and Mackay catalogue the coinage of the West Saxon king, Athelred (865-71), highlighting the impor tance of the late 860s in the extension of pragmatic monetary union with Mercia. Clarke and Symons study the limited output of the later Anglo-Saxon mint of Aylesbury. Screen reassesses references to coinage in Anglo-Saxon law-codes in the light of recent research. ?

Curiously, pronouncements against false coin in the late tenth century do not coincide with any marked increase in surviving forgeries. Reviewing the circulation of imported coins in Ireland, Wales, the Isle of Man, and north Britain before the striking of coinage at Dublin at the end of the tenth century, Blackburn sheds new light on exchange in these regions. Imported coins were not unknown before the Viking period, but the effect of the Vikings in western Britain was to encourage a new currency system based on weighed bullion, with a limited role for coin. Over time, practices shifted towards the dominance of coinage, but in north Britain metalwork remained dominant, with coin use perhaps restricted to certain Scandinavian communities. In all areas, however, coinage was far less abundant, and circulated less actively, than in England. References (date of publication is 2007 unless otherwise stated) Bassett, S., 'Divide and rule?

SCHOFIELD Aberystwyth University Jones offers a carefully crafted and suitably full appreciation of Harold Fox, who died in 2007. Jones's detailed portrayal includes a good deal of discussion of Fox's chief research interests and of his main projects, and is supported by a full chronology of his published works. One of Fox's last pieces of work to be published, a study of the Exe and Dart estuaries in Devon, illustrates a number of his passions, including an abiding interest in the landscape of the south-west and its coastline, as well, of course, as the peopling of that landscape. In his article, Fox examines three different ways in which estuaries were moulded by their histories. Those who lived along their banks in the middle ages, as Fox illustrates neatly, effected changes through their preoccupations with fisheries, with forti fication of accessible estuaries and with a concentration of places of worship. Clark engages directly and in broad terms with major themes in economic history, especially discussion of the motors of economic and social change. In an article that may well generate some further debate on the nature of wage in England over six centuries, from the thirteenth to the nineteenth, as well as the population history of the period, he presents three wage series for farm workers: the nominal wage series, the likely product of a day's labour, and the purchasing power in terms of consumption of a day's wage. Clark argues that his estimates of likely product from a day's labour suggest that labour may have generated more and better purchasing opportunities than has hitherto been assumed to have been the case. In the medieval context, this has implications for discussion of medieval population movement, as well as of the standard of living. That said, the author is also at pains to stress the exceptional weakness of the marginal productivity of wage in some of the most difficult years, including the famine years of the early fourteenth century. Clark, in fact, argues that the determinant of wage productivity and its variation in this period was population, and the relative impact of mortality and fertility rather than an endogenous factor such as technological change. Also in terms of population studies of the middle ages, Theilmann and Cate offer an effective and very useful review of recent discussion of the epidemiology of the Black Death and the potentially intractable problems associated with its identification. They conclude that evidence for a thoughtful combination of science and historical investigation is of greater benefit for future study than the slavish pursuit aimed at the identification of any single disease. Lordship and the management of estate resources continue to be themes of importance in the journal literature. Henry Eastry, prior of Christ Church Canterbury in the late thirteenth century, oversaw a reorganization of the estate which, as Adams describes, included a restructured demesne at Westwell, Kent. Substantial building work on the (C Economic History Society 2009 Economic History Review, 62, 1 (2009)</page><page sequence="5">REVIEW OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE 157 demesne at Westwell in the late thirteenth century included construction of a hall, a solar, a grange, dovecotes, and gardens. This, in turn, encouraged a further process of growth, the author suggests, to the development of the modern settlement. In a compelling account of the use of marshland in different parts of England and, for the greater part, in the twelfth century, Gardiner argues for a sophisticated and multi-various use of marshland that predates a 'retreat to the margin' in the thirteenth and early fourteenth century. In different parts of the country this management of the marsh involved both lords and local commu nities, the influence of the latter far more evident in eastern England. In the Fens (unlike in Romney Marsh, where the administration of the marsh was organized relatively early), strong local communities competed for the resources of the marsh well into the thirteenth century. N. Smith describes, through a combination of documentary evidence and material gleaned from field-walking, the changing use of cattle farms, or vaccaries, in Sowersby, Yorkshire, in the early fourteenth century. The author charts their decline, as lords opted first to lease the lactage of the vaccaries and, subsequently, to convert subdivided vaccaries into arable. D. Smith, in his discussion of the Berkeley Castle muniments, includes comment on the management and administration of the Berkeley estates in the middle ages. Laurie, offering a different perspective on one aspect of the lordly economy, suggests two distinct sources for the materials used in the construction of the Benedictine Abbey of Abbotsbury, Dorset, including sand taken from Chesil Beach, some 15 miles north-west of the abbey. Investment by local lords in their property is also described by Brady and Biddulph who report the excavation of a substantial water-course, later in-filled with various materials in the twelfth and early thirteenth century. It is suggested here that the channel was part of a water-management system, feeding the moat at Edenbridge manor, and its construction may be consistent with a general campaign in the construction of moated manor houses. Parker et al. describe, in an extensive discussion, recent work at the site of the Cistercian abbey of Cleeve, including an extensive survey of the remaining buildings and its masonry and woodwork, as well as reporting on the result of recent excavations. Among the many valuable insights here, the excavations have revealed a good deal of imported pottery from the later middle ages, suggesting Cleeve was a consumer of imported goods, including foodstuffs and medicines. The construction of the moated manor house at Baddesley Clinton, Warwickshire, is discussed by Alcock and Meeson, who suggest a significant building campaign in the thirteenth century on an earlier, twelfth-century, moated site. This was followed by further building and elaboration in the fifteenth century under the stewardship of the new owners, the Bromes, a local family of lawyers, Justices, and MPs. Building accounts also survive for 1457-8 and add further detail to the structural evidence for the fifteenth-century work. Further refurbishment continued into the early modern period and, as Alcock and Meeson report, the work on the house continued to reflect contemporary preoccupations with space and comfort, as well as the physical representa tion of social distinction. Discussion by Buxton of the base cruck house at Westcourt Farm, Wiltshire, almost certainly constructed in the early fourteenth century for the local lord, William de Harden, includes consideration of the high-quality timber roofing from the early fourteenth century, and the employment of Arabic assembly marks. The latter, when combined with other contemporary evidence of high-quality roofing in the area, are suggestive of the presence in the region of an educated and highly skilled craftsman working with local high status clients. Stephenson, in three articles in the same issue of the Montgomeryshire Collections, examines various aspects of lordship in Powys in the thirteenth century. In sequence, the author discusses, first, evidence for dispute over territory and lordship in the region in the second half of the thirteenth century. One of the protagonists in that dispute, Gruffudd ap Gwenwynwyn, the lord of southern Powys, also features in Stephenson's second article which considers, through examination of qualitative and archaeological ? Economic History Society 2009 Economic History Review, 62, 1 (2009)</page><page sequence="6">158 REVIEW OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE sources, efforts made to restructure Powis Castle in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries. While charting the political history of the mid-Wales lordship in the period, in the last of the three articles, Stephenson offers much that is of relevance to socio-economic discussion of lordship in his consideration of the administrative history of the territories and the relations between territorial lords and the freemen, uchelwyr, of the territorial subdivisions of the lordship, the commotes. The same is also true of Hartland's study of English lordship in Ireland in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries which, through a close study of particular lordships, suggests that relations between English lords and their Irish counterparts were malleable and responsive to the territorial and political ambitions of both parties. Changes in the management of the demesnes in the later middle ages and especially the leasing of demesnes are considered in more than one study. Dyer offers an exceptionally detailed biography of a fifteenth-century demesne lessee, Robert Parman of Chevington (Suffolk), who lived during the first three-quarters of that century. Parman's career exemplifies the kind of successful peasant lessee who came to dominate parts of the countryside in the fifteenth century, his kind possibly resented by those, such as the abbey of Bury of St Edmunds with whom Parman dealt frequently and from whom he leased a great deal of his land, who no longer enjoyed the same kind of dominion over them. Also in the fifteenth-century, Taylor examines the management of their estates by the Catesbys, whose properties were scattered about the Warwickshire/Northamptonshire border. Taylor, reviewing his material (chiefly mid-century manorial accounts) in relation to previous discussion of later medieval seigneurial economies, suggests that there is little evidence for an aggressive engagement with the market. Instead, the Catesby family tended to opt for an economic activity dominated by their own consumption needs and in response to any advantageous opportunities that might arise. Aldsworth's report on an early fifteenth century barn at Steyning, West Sussex, reveals, through dendrochronological analysis, that the barn was constructed from timber felled in 1404-5, just after it passed from Fecamp Abbey into the hands of the Cornwall family. The barn's construction and dating is closely considered. An introduction by Rogerson to reports based upon the field-walking of two Norfolk settlements describes the contribution of the late A. Davison to Norfolk landscape studies and is followed by Davison's reports from his final two pieces of fieldwork. These include descriptions of medieval pottery found at Godwick and some suggestion of the retreat and decline of a small settlement established on poor soil. Beeston Paul, the second subject of Davison's field-walking, reveals little in the way of medieval pottery but may suggest some degree of adjustment in the use of the land across the medieval period. Hale reports that a recent archaeological campaign at the Ministry of Defence site at Otterburn has revealed, inter alia, a good deal of medieval settlement evidence, including extensive pottery finds and corn drying kilns. The author notes that the presence of the kilns further illustrates both that grain production was once significant in the region and that it was carried out on a scale that passed beyond immediate consumption needs. Shepherd proposes a view of landscape development for a region of Britain, the north-east of Scotland, less familiar to students of the medieval British economy as well as to the study of landscape history. The author argues that field-systems in the region reflect a variety of influences, including the laying out, in the twelfth century, of midlands-style open-fields followed by a process of post-plague enclosure. Landscape also features in Partida's discussion of the early modern development of fox hunting, which includes a good deal of discussion of deer hunting in the middle ages and illustrates the persistence of medieval hunting landscapes. The nature of the landscape in Rockingham Forest c. 1300 is reconstructed and mapped in order to help establish this continuity and the point is also made that, from the first, medieval parks were far from being fixed entities. Parks also feature in Laundon's discussion of fish ponds in Northamptonshire. Harningworth Park, established in the early thirteenth century, ? Economic History Society 2009 Economic History Review, 62, 1 (2009)</page><page sequence="7">REVIEW OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE 159 includes fish ponds which, the author suggests, may be medieval in origin. Anthony et al. suggest that evidence for a circular building at Thornecombe, Dorset, may indicate the presence of a shepherd's hut or single isolated farmstead. Aspects of the economic life of the gentry are revealed by Beadle and Richmond who transcribe a rare survival from the Paston family's estate and household papers, a good number of which are known to have survived until the eighteenth century. The roll of expenses recorded here (from BL Add. MS 17,246) includes details of a range of out goings for John Paston I, including gifts, hospitality, and travelling expenses, especially those incurred as a result of his business dealings. Trade and the dealings of the gentry also feature in Arden's discussion of the Ardernes of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The family, from Warwickshire, acquired land in Northamptonshire. While chiefly an account of the succession of the family's estate, there is also comment on outlawry and the family's financial dealings, which included the credit arrangements of Thomas Arderne in the late thirteenth century with one Hugh of Vienna. Tracy shows how the will of William Pykenham, a Suffolk pluralist and lawyer, as well as his legacy of building, offers insight into his charitable and intellectual activity in addition to his investment in architecture. Sir William Plumpton, variously sheriff and Justice of the Peace across Yorkshire, Derbyshire, and Nottinghamshire, as well as steward to the Honour of Knaresborough, was also a significant local landholder during a period of intense political upheaval in the fifteenth century. Wilcock's discussion of Plumpton's career touches a good deal on issues of estate management as well as regional power politics. Crook charts a dispute over landed estates, and more particularly parkland, at Laxton, Nottinghamshire, in the later thirteenth century. The vigorous dispute, between two Nottinghamshire families, the Lexingtons and the Everinghams, involved, in the persons of John and Robert of Lexington, some of the leading figures in law and central government. Gentry involvement at Wye in support of the rising during the Peasants' Revolt, is discussed by De Saxe, who also explores the events and the parties to the rising in detail. Rebellion in the early thirteenth century is discussed by Latimer who, in assessing the regional dimension of the rising against John and his officers in 1215-17, draws some distinctions between opposition in the south-west, in the Welsh Marches, and also places these in the context of earlier work on northern opposition to the reign. One distinctive feature is the relative importance of a collective approach to the threat of royal incursion by county society in the south-west, something less evident in the Welsh marches where, perhaps as a result of the different nature of lordship, individual grievances were more to the fore. Law and administration continue to make some significant appearances in the periodical literature. Hagger presents a fourteenth-century excerpt from what was undoubtedly one of the earliest Pipe rolls and one that predates by six years the earliest extant roll (from 1130). Some of the content is consistent with that found in the later rolls, including exemptions for payment of danegeld. Karn describes the 'reconstruction' of the Exchequer in the mid-twelfth century, after the disruption of the reign of Stephen; the development of the Exchequer in this period witnessed a significant step towards the unified financial administration of the kingdom, organized increasingly from Westminster. Cohn's discus sion of labour law in later medieval western Europe is a detailed survey of legislation in a variety of contexts, including later medieval England. Cohn argues that a simple and general explanation for the causes of labour legislation cannot be applied; instead, the legislation appears to have responded to the varieties of post-plague environment as experienced across western Europe. In the English case, to follow Cohn, it was a continu ing post-plague anxiety about labour rather than the strict application of a demographic or economic model that occasioned the response, which was characterized by an increasingly aggressive legislative programme in the second half of the fourteenth century and into the early fifteenth century. ? Economic History Society 2009 Economic History Review, 62, 1 (2009)</page><page sequence="8">160 REVIEW OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE Phillips explores what she identifies as the particularly masculine focus of later medieval English sumptuary legislation. Insisting that the legislation reveals attempts to reflect the changing nature of 'homosociality', the author chooses to focus more on the social and cultural aspects of sumptuary law than on their economic purpose, though the latter factor is also acknowledged. Ward provides a detailed assessment of the Hundred Rolls for Kent and illustrates the ways in which jurors, responding to the enquiries of Edward I's commissioners, sought to emphasize the particular nature of Kentish custom, not least the tenurial difference epitomized by gavelkind. Regional particularities of a different kind are discussed by Butler whose analysis of the reporting of suicides by jurors in the coroners' rolls and in eyre rolls encourages her to the view that jurors exhibited some significant regional difference in their willingness to report suicide, an outcome replete with negative financial, moral, and religious connotations in the middle ages. Two articles consider the nature of office-holding and its relevance for careers and social status within two northern local contexts. Martinez discusses office-holding in the Palati nate of Lancashire and the career paths available to members of local society. While the Palatinate did not offer substantial career routes, it did offer swift and effective access to royal justice within the county, a feature of significance for the operation of the region's economy. Holford offers a discussion of office-holding, this time in the liberty of Durham for the century from 1241. He sets out the administrative structure of the liberty in the period and discusses careerism and opportunity therein, concluding that while the liberty offered only limited opportunity for advancement within the laity, those few who gained from its administrative advanced considerably and retained their positions, suggesting that here at least local administration was, for some at least, a significant feature of careerism and social mobility. The urban economy is explored this year in a number of different contexts and with a variety of disciplinary approaches. Edwards identifies pottery and waste evidence from Maidstone in the medieval period, with the majority of evidence dateable to the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The results suggest a medieval use of the excavated area as waste-pits, and the finds are deemed consistent with the activity of a developed market town in this period. Baker et al. include discussion of the market place in Shrewsbury, as well as the early modern market hall. The authors consider the thirteenth-century origins of the market and its later thirteenth-century reorganization within the medieval town. The 1261 reorganization and the creation of the market square are revealed to have followed a process of wetland reclamation. Urban development is also described by Evans and Thorpe in their account of the erection of new buildings in Norwich, beginning in the late eleventh and twelfth centuries, with further phases of building in the late twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and then fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The authors suggest that proximity to the waterfront at Norwich encouraged these developments, especially in relation to the economic vitality of the region. Investment in local building campaigns is a theme also explored in other contexts. A fifteenth-century rebuilding programme at Llansteffan church, Carmarthenshire, along with the church's wall-paintings and present conservation work, are discussed by Rees and Oldenbourg. The article includes interesting reference to the late fourteenth-century tithe accounts for the parish, as well as reflection on some of the possible sources of finance for the medieval rebuilding, which may have included lordship and the local population. Lilleshall Abbey's role in the early history of the borough of Welshpool in the thirteenth century is discussed by Barton, who outlines the establish ment of burgage plots and also considers relations between the town and local lordship, including a detailed discussion of the problems of the early fourteenth century. An appendix to the article calendars grants of land from Lilleshall Abbey to townspeople in the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries. An example of a face pot, described by Makepeace and Cumberpatch and discovered during a campaign of field-walking, may shed some light on the rural pottery industry in ?) Economic History Society 2009 Economic History Review, 62, 1 (2009)</page><page sequence="9">REVIEW OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE 161 medieval Derbyshire. The authors suggest that the pot may have been used in rites of passage rituals but acknowledge that other interpretations are also possible. Maintaining the themes of pottery and face pots, Spavold and Brown report the discovery of late medieval/early modern (post-1450) Cistercian ware atTicknall, which is taken as evidence for a potters' site where mugs (of the kind known as 'tygs') and decorated vessels were made. The authors also note an instance of what may be 'the earliest English mask decoration' on one of the vessels. Semple describes tile-making at Borough Green, known as le Berghe in the middle ages. The author describes evidence for a localized community of tile-makers and their families, and offers details on individual families and their land holding in the later middle ages and early modern period. Lastly, in terms of this discussion of durable items of consumption, sundials feature in more than one report this year, including Le Pard's description of two new finds at Studland and Thornford in Dorset. Williams also discusses Kentish scratch-dials, with 135 examples noted for the county. Household and family appear in a number of different contexts. A significant discussion of the range of approaches to the urban household in the later middle ages is undertaken by Jones et al., scholars of the medieval household at York. In a substantial overview, the authors tackle a number of interdisciplinary themes, including the contemporary concept of family and household and the problems and possibilities of terminology. The article includes a series of socio-economic themes familiar from the past study of the medieval family, including the family and law, the demography of the family, and discussion of the impact of mobility and to parenting. In addition, sections are devoted to perspectives that have also established significant historiographical foundations, including the nature of reading within the family and the family as a basis of memory. Elite peasant households and the role of the more substantial peasants within their communities are discussed by Schofield, who offers an overview of discussion of rural elites in the medieval English village, reflecting upon the nature of their families and households, as well as the bases of the power of peasant elites and the economic and social strategies employed by them. A household of a different kind is described by Carpenter, who employs the earliest surviving of the king's household accounts, those for Henry III, to examine the range of information offered on the day-to-day management of the royal household, including royal hospitality and the treatment of the poor. Kerr offers a further perspective on the household by considering the courtesy due to guests by their noble hosts in the twelfth century. Review ing a series of prescribed forms of behaviour in greeting and receiving guests, the author explores the perceived norms of good hospitality in this period. Self-representation within and beyond religious households is discussed by Fizzard. Gender identity in clothing, a theme which also arises in Phillips's discussion of sumptuary legislation as mentioned above, features large in Fizzard's discussion of Augustinian clothing, and the contemporary debate surrounding canonical clothing and footwear in the later middle ages. Self representation of a different kind is examined by Lee, who discusses oath-taking by urban officers in the later medieval town, and Bristol in particular. He suggests that oaths, undertaken on entry into office, chiefly served to emphasize distinctions of rank and interest within the urban setting, encouraging the perpetuation of an entrenched authority. The economic dealings of peasant women are considered by Thornton, who examines court and account roll evidence for female activity in later medieval Northamptonshire. He discusses a range of economic activity, including the holding and transfer of land, commercial and semi-commercial brewing, and credit relations. Thornton also offers an analysis of female litigants and suggests that most female litigants acting, or seeming to act, alone were from relatively advantaged peasant backgrounds. He also detects some apparent growth in hostility towards women during the fifteenth century, possibly a reflection of a perceived increase in social regulation in local courts. Noy argues, through a case study of Winslow, that leyrwite evidence in the manor court encourages a view that premarital sexual activity affected all social groups within the village, but that lords tended to ?

The lord, it is suggested, may have seen this as potential for raising court revenue. Female litigants in the later medieval church courts are discussed by Goldberg, who sets out to test the proposition that the courts were less inclined to support female litigants; in short that they were 'institutionally sexist'. He argues, through an examination of the consistory court at York, that, in fact, canon law seems to have been applied with little or no regard for differences of gender. Where distinctions were applied to the disadvantage of women it was in the world beyond canon law and the consistory court, prejudices against participation which may also have limited the number of female litigants within the church court itself. Cavell (in Transactions of the Royal Historical Society) places the role of aristocratic widows in marcher society on a firmer footing, illustrating the range of political and economic interaction, including the management of their estates, engaged in by widows in the Welsh march, and chiefly in the later thirteenth century. In a further discussion of Shropshire widows (in Thirteenth-Century England), Cavell also examines the burial of noblewomen in the same marcher society, a discussion which, as well as suggesting that marcher noble women enjoyed a significant degree of personal choice in these matters, includes consid eration of pre-mortem burial arrangements and donation to religious communities. In additional to study of the institutional and administrative structures of the Church, the historical investigation of lay piety remains a significant branch of the socio-economic history of medieval England. Thomas pursues lay piety back into the 'long twelfth century' and surveys, inter alia, lay donations to churches and monasteries, the distribution of charity, as well as some relatively few insights into parish life. He argues for an involved and wide-reaching piety in many ways consistent with the later medieval history of lay pious expression. Similar evidence for the assimilation of Christian teaching in the decades before and after the Fourth Lateran Council is offered by McKenna. Examining a number of Welsh poems, of the form 'songs/poems to God' (canulawdl i Dduw), from the mid twelfth to the mid-thirteenth century, the author explores approaches to the penitential practice of the Church and its absorption within the poetic tradition of high and later medieval Wales. Hamilton considers the relationship of Church and secular lordship in high and late medieval Scotland, chiefly through an examination of the earls of Dunbar and their dealings with the Church, including the donation of portions of their estates for the establishment of churches and chapels. Hoskin publishes an account roll for the York Paternoster Gild, from the end of the fourteenth century. The roll lists over 150 members of the gild, both male and female, as well as the gild's income and expenditure. A main, but not sole, responsibility of the gild was the performance of the Paternoster play, as funded by the gild members. Crassons examines the Last Judgement pageant at York in the later middle ages. This pageant was supported and performed by the Mercers' Guild, a powerful body in late medieval York whose charter expresses the association of commerce and charitable giving in a manner that appears ordered and bound by contemporary views of the limits of appropriate charitable donation. This, Crassons argues, stands in some contrast to the more liberal view of poverty and charity evident in the Last Judgement pageant, and exposes some of the contradictions within contemporary definitions of communal and Christian society in the period. Themes which have appeared elsewhere in the journal literature for this year, including self-representation, and the establishment of discrete identities for social and economic groups, also features in discussion of lay piety, as Jurkowski's research into the social status of Lollards illustrates. Jurkowski considers the social and economic background of Lollards living and practising their faith on either side of the Norfolk/Suffolk border in the early to mid-fifteenth century, with particular reference to those identified in the court books of the bishop of Norwich in the 1420s and 1430s. Interestingly, she associates Lollardy in the region with membership of village elites and sees, in their engagement with Lollardy and its doctrine of self-reliance, a confident reflection of their own self-identity.

The author argues, from the archaeological evidence, for a wider social use of chantry chapels than has always been supposed, with features such as squints and the evidence of sight lines here identified as deliberately established in order to encourage a communal view of the celebration of the Eucharist. Grave covers in the form of upright markers and recumbent slabs are a significant feature of the surviving medieval landscape in the North Riding. As McClain describes, slabs carry different emblems, reflecting a range of activity, including trades and crafts, including cloth-work, smelting, and carpentry. A chronology of emblematic devices suggests, inter alia, an increase in emblems representative of trade in the high and late middle ages, as well as some aping of earlier elite forms of representation.

(iii) 1500-1700 HENRY FRENCH University of Exeter The most striking aspect of the year's periodical literature was not so much its thematic variation, although this was (as ever) considerable, but rather an unexpected prevalence of a particular methodology: the micro-study, or its more anthropologically-informed cousin, 'thick description'. This year, studies of this type have been conducted in the fields of legal history; the poor law; popular politics and protest; demography; economic thought; medi cine and early science; and agrarian change. However, to some extent this trend was counterbalanced by a handful of lucid, wide-ranging, synoptic articles that took on some of the biggest themes in economic and social history in this period. To deal with the latter category first, perhaps the most important of these overviews was Clark's hypothesis about the relationship between farm wages, population, and economic growth in England from the thirteenth to the nineteenth centuries, published in this journal. Clark suggests, first, that the 'basic tenets of the Malthusian model of pre industrial society' applied in England into the seventeenth century, with improvements in agricultural efficiency resulting in the ability to sustain higher levels of population, rather than higher per capita incomes. Secondly, he argues that improvements in agricultural productivity from the mid-seventeenth century 'allowed population to grow without depressing real wages', although he notes the striking finding that the value of real wages measured against all consumption goods was 15 per cent higher in the fifteenth century than in 1860. Clark's intensive study deserves to be balanced against Smith's synoptic piece which charts the evolution of the Malthusian model within historical demography, from the Annalistes to the Cambridge Group, and contrasts the demographic histories of France and England. In France, a homeostatic Malthusian model of 'prudential' checks on population growth appears to explain long-term trends. In England, although falling real wages in the later sixteenth century may have contributed to the 'closure of the nuptiality valve', Smith argues that there is 'little evidence of a long-term relationship between real wages and life expectancies'. While Smith agrees with Clark on a step-change in English real wages in the century after 1650, he suggests that exogenous factors intruded on the English experience, notably the demographic and economic growth of London, and the migration of 400,000 young men to colonies across the Atlantic. These exogenous factors lead Smith to question 'the dynamic equilibrium model of population and economy', and to ask for consideration of political and institutional developments, such as migration and emigration, poor law, and the fiscal-military state. He warns that the penchant among demographers for 'repeti tive regularities over the very long term' risks developing models that are 'immobile' in practice. This hypothesis receives some support from the modelling of Wagner et al. They contest the English demographic orthodoxy of a weak link between real income and mortality levels over the early modern period. Picking up on modern studies of levels of ?) Economic History Society 2009 Economic History Review, 62, 1 (2009)</page><page sequence="14">166 REVIEW OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE household health and nutrition, they suggest that there was a positive correlation between a household production function and life expectancy in the sixteenth century (perhaps from more salubrious housing), but that this was undercut by the negative effects of urbanization until the inception of public health reforms in the mid-nineteenth century. The growth of the professions was another large-scale development of the period surveyed this year. O'Day argues that the most important change was the growth in the early sixteenth century of the Ciceronian ideal of education to produce 'active citizenship', not the contemplative life. While this change was most visible among the expanding ranks of gentry undergraduates after 1560, O'Day suggests that these values were shared by learned professionals, as they gained preferment in grammar schools, the clergy, medicine, and the law, and imparted these norms to their successors. In particular, she shows that by the 1 620s, the university degree had become a basic recruitment credential for entry to the clergy. The growing significance of such credentials homogenized members of these groups, but also separated them from the bulk of the population, and other parts of the elite, and resulted in the rise of the professionally trained 'expert'. S. M. Cooper explores the educational role of 'professional' governesses, and other 'amateur' servants to the households in which they worked. She highlights this hidden, but pervasive, aspect of education by investigating it in household correspondence and diaries from the period. This interpretation wins some support from Dwyer's analysis of the rise of the expert witness in English civil law. Dwyer argues that from the later seventeenth century civil courts were well used to calling on those whose occupational or educational credentials gave their testimony privileged status. The first 'expert' witnesses were grammarians, used to explain Latin in the fifteenth-century common law courts. While Dwyer refutes notions of a linear progression from court-appointed 'neutral' experts to party-appointed 'expert witnesses', by the early eighteenth century she notes 'a clear inclination to hear certain types of opinion only from expert witnesses', as ultimate sources of authority. The two other overviews concern aspects of gender history. Pollock explores the role of honour in notions of elite behaviour and gender identity, while Erickson provides a useful reminder of the problems of assessing female property ownership in English source materials. Pollock's analysis dispels the idea that elite 'honour culture' in this period can be construed simply as 'violence for men and sexual chastity for women'. Instead, she emphasizes that 'honor resided in social relationships, and peacekeeping strategies were a fundamental part of it'. From this, she draws the important implication that because the maintenance of honour was linked as much to restraint as to violence, women participated in this process by defending their own and their family's honour, and by 'coaching elite men on how to be suitable patriarchs'. By stressing that restraint, resolution, and reputa tion were essential ingredients of honour, Pollock reinstates women, and non-violent strategies, into English elite culture in this period. Erickson considers the unexpected implications of the relatively weak legal rights that English women exercised over their real and personal estates. Helpfully, she explains this by reference to a series of examples relating to the main categories of testamentary, personal, financial, and business records. Married women enjoyed few formal rights to property, and there were few formal rules governing the apportionment of property in marriage or bequests. However, she emphasizes that this often produced female activism rather than passivity, as women proved or defended highly varied private contracts, and participated in capital markets, precisely because of 'England's peculiar lack of guardian ship for single women'. This point is explored in more detail by Spicksley's splendidly titled article ('Fly with a duck in thy mouth'). Examining 1,165 single women's probate inven tories, she finds that credit was ubiquitous among female testators. The amount lent by these women was from ?20 to L40 per capita in the years before 1640, increasing to 1J60-80 per capita after 1660, enough for a sufficient 'living' income of ?5 per annum. Spicksley argues that single women of middling status were 'more deeply embedded in the ?)

Biggs also examines women's testamen tary behaviour in a case study of Northamptonshire, finding that women were less con strained than men by dynastic expectations, and bequeathed personal property to a wide range of family members. However, she still finds a concentration on the nuclear family, and relatively little recognition of all non-kin. Postles (in Transactions of the Leicester Archaeological &amp; Historical Society) provides a brief but useful insight into the pitfalls of using early sixteenth-century wills, particularly by illustrating the chronological uneven ness of their survival. Dils looks at rural credit relations more broadly by examining a neglected source, the court books for Shrivenham Hundred, Oxfordshire, which dealt with debts worth less than ?2, mainly for goods, processed foodstuffs, and cloth. Common law restrictions on married women's property rights ensured that there were few female plaintiffs, but this study offers a rare insight into credit relations within the lifetime, rather than through post-mortem inventory analyses. The persistence of families is considered by several other studies. Razzell and Spence examined long-term trends in child and adult mortality in London, emphasizing Smith's observations about the broader impact of metropolitan death rates. They conclude that infant and child mortality rates doubled in the capital between the sixteenth and eighteenth centuries, so that by 1750 two-thirds of children died before the age of five. By contrast, adult mortality rates, although high, remained stable through the early modern period, and social status had little effect on child or adult mortality. Takahashi compares family continuity in early modern Willingham (Cambridgeshire) with Kami-shiojiri (Nagano, Japan). Population turned over at twice the rate in the former than it did in the latter, so that less than one-fifth of surnames survived in the Cambridgeshire fen village from the 1520s to the 1720s. Stable surnames belonged 'disproportionately to those families who were comparatively prosperous throughout the period'. By contrast, Japanese family struc tures were larger and much more complex, and the powers of overlords ensured that geographical mobility was restricted. Gritt explores the effects of a more disruptive force (crisis mortality) in the Lancashire village of Broughton in 1667, 1670, and 1672. He finds that an excess of deaths produced a fracturing of families, and higher rates of marriage/ re-marriage, rather than an influx of immigrants. The resultant increase in births lowered the age profile of the settlement, but increased vulnerability to childhood diseases. Despite these shocks, average household size remained very small (only 3.6) in 1676, and 'complex' family structures were rare and transitory. Healey, meanwhile, looks at the turnover of landowning families further north, in Grasmere, from the sixteenth to early nineteenth centuries. Despite the historical stereotype of the persistent customary tenant 'statesmen' in the Lakes, the number of farms halved between the sixteenth and late eighteenth centuries, and the estates of richer yeomen farmers expanded. Again, the families of the larger tenants were the most likely to endure, but Healey depicts a land market in the Lakes that was more dynamic than in supposedly 'capitalist' East Anglia at this time. Powell's study of Beddgelert in Snowdonia echoes this message of dynamism in the upland agrarian economy. She finds a prosperous, market-oriented cattle and sheep breeding economy, linked to national supply networks, based on rational calculation of future demand. This resulted in increased personal estate valuations, indicating that upland pastoral farming was much more prosperous than lowland arable production (but with rents being higher, too). The picture on the estate of the (largely arable) Mains of Castle Lyon on the sheltered northern side of the Tay estuary in the later seventeenth century was more mixed, primarily because of dramatic harvest fluctuations. Young emphasizes the importance of crop diversification, but also the gradual but consistent increase in yields between the 1670s and early 1690s. If the famine years after 1694 are discounted, yield ratios improved 45 per cent for all grains. The famine had long-lasting effects, but Young ?

More generally, rural studies considered territorial and spatial themes. Postles (in J7ournal of Historical Geography) illustrates the multi-faceted uses and meanings of the church porch: conduit between profane and sacred worlds; place of penance; dispute; legal agreement; charitable relief; and exclusion. Whyte's subtle reconstruction of contemporary understandings of parish boundaries suggests that in an age before comprehensive mapping, parish boundaries were still subject to dispute, and held in tension between legal records and popular memory. Where we envisage invisible lines stretching across the countryside, she argues that contemporaries imagined boundaries 'as nodal points in the landscape', as they processed between them. This causes her to question whether 'agrarian capitalism' really alienated people from the landscape, because enclosed landscapes still had boundaries that had to be remembered. Blomley devotes attention to the material history of the physical agent of enclosure, the quick-set hedge. He illustrates how the planting of hedges restricted access, delimited rights, and changed the human dynamics of the landscape. However, many seventeenth-century commentators celebrated the hedge, as the creator of a better-ordered landscape, and as a bringer of 'amity' by settling disputes between neighbours. Two papers explore aspects of one of the biggest landscape transformations of the early modern period, the draining of the Fens. K(nittl's detailed analysis argues that Cornelius Vermuyden was sidelined early in the process by powerful creditors who were unhappy with his performance (and probity) in earlier works. Instead, she suggests that the Earl of Bedford called in existing expertise among the Commissioners of Sewers and drew on 'the collective wisdom of the fen community'. However, Bedford fell foul of Charles I's unrealistic schemes to expand royal revenues in 1638, and the project was upgraded to produce permanent arable lands (and unpopular enclosures), rather than summer pastures favoured by the fen dwellers. Chisholm explores the effects of drainage on river navigation after Vermuyden's resumption of activities in 1649. He suggests that, contrary to contem porary opinion, water transport was not hindered by the new sluices and channels on the Ouse, and most of the complaints came from towns suffering from this competition. Articles on industrial archaeology and manufacturing technology in this period were in relatively short supply. Belford's report on the restoration of sluice systems at Coal brookdale demonstrates that the basic layout of pools and culverts was established in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Page surveys the remains of the charcoal-fuelled ironworking industries in Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire, and suggests that Hugh Gundy may have conducted experiments with coke-firing as early as the 1 620s at one site. Plackett describes Edmond Custis' bizarre seventeenth-century attempt to blow up wrecks in the mouth of the Tyne, commemorated in a print by Wenceslaus Hollar. (The effort simply succeeded in distributing these hazards more widely.) Finally, Hayward provides a plausible explanation for Henry VIII's well-known capacity to see red. Her analysis of his Great Wardrobe accounts shows that, in fact, 'red was used sparingly by the king to create a specific effect', on holidays and at the coronation. Otherwise, Henry wore a lot of black, as he had as a child. By contrast, studies in urban history abounded, particularly of immigrant and religious communities. Esser's study of the reception of Walloon migrant 'strangers' into English towns (particularly Norwich) emphasizes the cooperation among migrants, civic leaders, and central government in order to diffuse local tensions, and reap the economic benefit of the incomers' textile skills. In the sixteenth century, local and central government were keen that immigrants organize themselves into corporate bodies to regulate worship, trade, and moral discipline, so that it was easier to deal collectively with these groups and surmount the language barrier. This system only broke down when a new wave of Huguenot migration produced a different administrative imperative, towards assimilation ?

Hankins's study of early seventeenth-century Colchester corroborates this, showing how the town's authorities tried to reconcile the interests of English and 'Dutch' cloth producers. Central government intervention came only, Hankins argues, when local authorities became too associated with the interests of English producers in the later 1620s. Jackson's study of Reading in the same period reveals a less optimistic interpretation of local power. The town's charter allowed a narrow and increasingly elderly clique of wealthy clothiers to rule between 1620 and 1640. They were unaccountable to the body of freemen, which made it extremely difficult for the latter to challenge their serious mishandling of a huge charitable bequest by a London draper. They built a workhouse to employ the poor in the cloth-trade, which never succeeded, and was subject to two Privy Council enquiries in the 1630s, without significant penalties for those responsible. People were not the only items of overseas origin to come to early modern towns. Two archaeological reports demonstrate the diversity and vibrancy of international trade into Southampton and London in this period. First, Gutierrez's report on the Portuguese coarsewares deposited in Southampton emphasizes the ubiquity of this brick-red, quartz impregnated pottery, used in Iberian trade. Found across 100 south-coast, London, and Irish sites, 'consumption' of this pottery may even have been literal, as it was supposedly crushed and eaten for its health-giving properties in Spain and Portugal. Second, as Pearce shows, there were no reports of this among the much wider diversity of pottery deposited at Bombay Wharf in Rotherhithe. This emphasized the extent of London trade in the period 1630-80, with items from Surrey-Hampshire, Delft, Portugal, Seville, the Rhine, and northern Italy being identified. Urban archaeology also disclosed other hidden social history of the period. Bashford and Sibun's excavation of the Quaker burial ground at IKingston-upon Thames corroborates two more conventional studies of the lives of early Quakers. The excavation uncovered 360 burials, from 1664 to 1819, revealing 'a remarkably healthy post-medieval population', with few diseases associated with poor living conditions, poor diet, or heavy repetitive manual labour. Bashford and Sibun's conclusion that these findings 'mirror the historical picture of a thriving, generally middle-class mercantile community' therefore fits with Dixon's London study, and (to a lesser extent) Lacock's investigation of the Gloucester Quaker community in the later seventeenth century. While Dixon notes the gradual integration of Quakers into wider parochial communities, he presents a more complex, and perhaps less optimistic, picture. Service by Quakers in local office could indicate inclusion, but it could also reflect religious rivalry by other means. Similarly, Lacock finds that the Gloucester Quakers were less prosperous than the histori cal stereotype, and suffered a decline in membership in the long run because of their desire to preserve spiritual endogamy. Urban religion also featured in Bearman's study of the Reformation process in Stratford upon-Avon. Detailed urban studies of the social profile of participants in the Reformation remain relatively rare, but Bearman shows how the process of institutional reform, specifi cally the dissolution of dominant religious guilds and the creation of a new borough corporation, created an elite with vested financial interests in reform, even if it took another one or two generations for them to become enthusiastic Protestants. Lee's study of Bristol explores another, overlooked aspect of civic government that took on more menacing significance in the sixteenth century: civic oath-taking (and breaking). He argues against the current orthodoxy that oaths simply cemented corporate identity, by illustrating how they could also be exclusive, embodying divisions in the body politic, creating 'a politics of inclusion and exclusion'. These corporate divisions are evident in Sleigh-Johnson's inves tigation of the Merchant Tailors' company in Elizabeth's reign, particularly the distinction between the 'yeomanry' and the ordinary freemen. The yeomen formed a prosperous, highly visible 'company-within-a-company', whose power, wealth, and collective interests drew them away from those of the rank-and-file. Bolton's research into the 25 trading ?

They survived the dislocation of the Civil War siege and its disease-ridden aftermath, but suffered after 1680 from a breakdown of occupational demarcations, and efforts to restrict membership in order to limit charitable liabilities. Meanwhile, Withington gives attention to more informal association, by considering alternative meanings of the early modern notion of 'company': that is, the social and cultural practices, norms, and transgressions in operation in gatherings of people and alcohol. He argues that, although most evidence of this is found in the random misbehaviour recorded in assault cases, it is the 'politics', rituals, and cultural understandings revealed by these patterns that have been overlooked and which merit further study. Although social zoning was not a pronounced phenomenon within English towns and cities in this period, Baer's article on early London shopping exchanges reads like the pre-history of the 'West End'. He examines the impact of these new early modern 'malls', from Gresham's 'Royal Exchange' of the 1570s, to the two (less successful) post Restoration exchanges built off the Strand. When they began, Exchanges offered a novel and different retail experience, away from street bustle and crime. By the end of the seventeenth century, they had become seedy (the Middle Exchange quickly gained the sobriquet 'The whore's nest') and out-of-date. In their heyday, though, Exchanges were places in which to see and be seen. Warren explores the material background to the literary stereotype of the fashionable female shopper and socialite in early Stuart Westminster. He argues that social critics focused only on a minority, 'wives and widows of prominent officials' and courtiers, whose extravagances overshadowed the considerable genteel poverty, sober social and religious networks, and financial prudence that characterized many of the female householders in the streets around Westminster in the 1620s and 1630s. As Smith's discussion points out, such prosperity eventually found a faint echo in the provinces, and Grant's study of small towns in Hampshire in the later seventeenth and eighteenth century stresses that better transport communications were crucial to unlocking profits from local agriculture, in order to connect the area's arable (particularly malt) output to regional, metropolitan, and international trade networks. The ramifications of these networks could be highly surprising. Mandelblatt's article explores these in relation to the Irish salt beef trade, and offers an unexpected insight into a forgotten economic relationship. Irish salt beef was the staple foodstuff (and protein source) of the FrenchWest Indies, and by the early eighteenth century the French colonies accounted for 40-60 per cent of total Irish beef production. This turned Cork into an industrial-scale meat pro cessing and barrelling centre, fuelled a pastoral farming expansion, and tied Ireland firmly into the transatlantic slave economy. Elsewhere, two articles by Boulton move from the general to the particular in investi gating the experience of ordinary life in London in the later seventeenth century. In Family and Community History, he examines the parish nursing system in the populous, expanding parish of St Martin's-in-the-Fields, showing that half the extraordinary expenditure went on nursing for the sick poor, and most of that was concentrated in the hands offive nurses, who often received more than ?200 each per annum. The system grew with the parish after 1660, becoming more systematic from the 1 690s, before being replaced with in-door relief in a parish workhouse in 1725. Boulton's study in Continuity and Change pieces together the life of John Bedford, parish clerk of St Dionis Backchurch, whose elaborate will reveals an ordinary life punctuated by involvement in two of the century's dramas: the Ulster Rebellion of 1641, and the Great Fire of 1666. This document illuminates a hidden world of personal and credit networks across the Irish Sea, and Bedford's enduring parochial loyalty to St Dionis. Boulton reminds us that 'even apparently humble residents might often transcend . .. the bounds of street, neighbourhood, City Company, parish, county or even nation'. ?? Economic History Society 2009 Economic History Reviewv, 62, 1 (2009)</page><page sequence="19">REVIEW OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE 171 More generally, there was a resurgence of interest in crime and the law. Bayman tackled one recent area of expansion: literary representations of crime and criminals. Focusing on the supposedly practical, 'factual' descriptions of the Elizabethan criminal underworld found in 'cony-catching' pamphlets, she emphasizes that these publications were compet ing for credibility in a literary market place. This competition implicated increasingly such pamphlets in the process of criminal trickery, as they operated 'through (fraudulent) claims to credit and credibility, just like the rogues'. Rowberry navigated sparse legal records to describe violent crime and homicide in early Tudor Herefordshire, a county with a reputation for relative lawlessness. He shows that this reputation was based largely on the county's proximity to the Marches. Disputes were actually marked by considerable restraint and extensive popular legal knowledge, so that the situation in Hereford did not deviate significantly from other parts of England. Later metropolitan crime received further attention. Concentrating on the 1690s, Tosney demonstrated that women were quite heavily involved in coining (clipping and recasting specie): some 46 per cent of those indicted in London were women, and over four-fifths of those found guilty were sentenced to death. Although most of this activity was carried out by individuals, Tosney also finds evidence of female involvement in (even management of) more organized clipping gangs. Dabhoiwala investigates another metropolitan phenomenon of the 1 690s, 'Societies for the Reformation of Manners'. Although they enjoyed wide membership, prosecutions were generally the work of a small core of about 50 active members, and a group of salaried informers and agents. The net effect of all this was not greater civic activism, but rather 'to place metropolitan policing on a more mercenary footing'. Two articles by Langeluddecke examine parish officers, the volunteer officials charged with attempting to hold together the early modern state. In Historical Research, Langeliuddecke analyses the social profile of parish officers in the 1 630s, arguing that although these officers were drawn into enforcing some of the Caroline regime's unpopular policies, there was neither a generalized nor increasing reluctance to serve. Through a survey of nearly 500 officers in this decade, he argues that office-holding may have been 'more egalitarian than has been assumed'. His other study (in J7ournal of British Studies), on local efforts to collect ship money, indicates that these officers could express passive and active hostility to unpopular measures. Disputing revisionist claims about the 'success' of ship money collection, Langeliddecke shows how payment rates slowed down considerably after 1635. He argues that the tax 'collapsed because the opposition of the people resulted in a breakdown of the local government agencies involved in its enforcement'. As noted above, this exploration of the relationships between the micro and the macro levels of historical experience pervades a number of this year's studies. Como's in-depth analysis of the origins of popular radicalism in pre- 1642 London gets down to the forensic examination of type-faces, tracing the use of a series of Dutch-made capitals in a number of radical political and religious texts in the late 1 630s, culminating in their reappearance in early Leveller tracts in 1644. Through this painstaking reconstruction, Como describes the printers and pamphleteers that made up this chain of connections, and demonstrates that CivilWar radicalism had roots in anti-Episcopal, pro-Scots publications from 1638-9. In the same period, Walter examines popular politics in the Essex village of Radwinter, in the form of the travails of high-flying Laudian cleric Richard Drake, whose elaborate theological and liturgical views were lost on an increasingly alienated congregation. Walter demonstrates how this brought the larger contemporary issues of the fate of the Reforma tion, the power of the monarchy, and the role of popular agency into the parish. At the other end of the country, Hopper details the problems of another Caroline supporter, Sir Francis Wortley, in the face of large-scale poaching in his deer park near Barnsley. Hopper shows how Wortley's affinity with Charles I's cause in 1642 stemmed from his attempts to prevent deer-stealing, his consequent paranoia about social and religious 'disorder', and his personal authoritarianism. He also demonstrates that this poaching had an overtly political (C Economic History Society 2009 Economic History Review, 62, 1 (2009)</page><page sequence="20">172 REVIEW OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE edge, showing dislike of an unpopular landlord, who was associated directly with the policies of an increasingly unpopular regime. Holmes's reconstruction of the case of John Prigeon provides an even more detailed illustration of the murky interplay between local and national power politics in the 1 630s. An unsavoury mix of censorious church official and hypocritical womanizer, Prigeon became embroiled in a feud with another ecclesiastical officer in the diocese of Lincoln in the late 1 620s. The bishop, John Williams, was drawn in, and Holmes charts skilfully how the minor feud in the archdeaconry of Leicester ended up 10 years later with Williams fined CI0,000 and imprisoned in the Tower at the king's pleasure, and illustrates the cynical political and legal manoeuvres behind the bishop's destruction. Gaskill describes closely another court case, that of the Salisbury 'witch', Anne Bodenham, in the early 1650s. He traces its roots to Bodenham's earlier career as servant to the notorious physician and occultist, Dr John Lambe, conjurer and confident of the Duke of Buckingham. Gaskill weaves together the elements of court intrigue, sorcery, local reputation, contemporary print culture, and religious belief to demonstrate that 'witch-trials . . . were intricately plotted human dramas' that cannot be encapsulated fully by functionalist explanations. On witchcraft more generally, Sharpe charts beliefs on the Isle of Man, showing their similarity to Irish, Scots, and Welsh beliefs and the relative absence of the 'concept of the malefic witch'. The threat of the witch may have been diluted among the Manx by the persistence of ideas about counter-magic, and the fear of other malevolent spirits-fairies. Mirroring the popularity of micro-level studies were publications on individual historical protagonists. As ever, analyses of economic thought in this period tended to focus on the same cohort of well-known 'political arithmeticians', notably William Petty and Dudley North. However, three papers added new dimensions. Choksy's study discusses North's early tract describing the impact of Turkish recoinage on the bullion value of coin, and the relationship between the supply of specie and aggregate price levels. Choksy draws out the systematic nature of North's thought and demonstrates that his time as a Levant Company factor gave him practical, first-hand knowledge of the international bullion, specie, and commodity markets, on which he based his later Discourses upon trade (1691). Matthews adds a twist to this discussion, by highlightingWelsh contributions to pre-classical political economy, notably the early work on coinage by the lawyer, Rice Vaughan, who anticipated North in suggesting relationships between the volume of coinage in circulation and the general level of prices. McCormick returns to Petty, to argue that 'political arithmetic before 1688 was not social science but social engineering'. He asserts that the content of Petty's 'projects' of large-scale migration to and from Ireland were influenced directly by political imperatives, in which Petty treated confessional and national identities as mutable, because he was blithely unconcerned about the nature of those identities himself. He suggests that only after 1689 was 'political arithmetic' gradually shorn of its direct political objectives (although no one seems to have explained this to Gregory IKing). Ironically, Whelan's research provides a concrete example of one such migration, the effort to get Huguenot refugees to settle in Ireland in the 1680s. The policy of planting a skilled, industrious, prosperous Protestant population was masterminded by the Duke of Ormond; however, it fell foul of settlers' reluctance to conform to the Church of Ireland, and local resentment of immigrants. Slack, meanwhile, considers the economic thought of John Houghton and Nicholas Barbon, and their unconventional defences of luxury and consumption in the 1670s and 1680s. Both interpreted conspicuous spending as a spur to industry, emulation, and achievement. Both did so because they were heavily dependent on such spending for their livelihoods (as luxury import merchant and speculative builder respectively). However, Slack argues that their writing had deeper historical significance, contesting the idea of zero-sum international trade, or finite economic potential, and depicting 'happiness' in terms of maximum utility that prefigured the Scottish 'School', and later assumptions ?

If the rise of the legislative was one check on the power of the Crown, he argues forcefully that it was equally important that Parliament became 'the financial master of the executive' after 1690, auditing spending for the first time, as well as granting taxation income. The history of science provided further micro-level insights into the careers of a variety of seventeenth-century figures. Hunter explores the origins of Robert Boyle's influential methodology for natural philosophy, in which subjects were arranged under various linked 'heads'. He suggests that Boyle's 'innovation' of 1664-6 had its origins in the Royal Society's information-gathering questionnaires of the early 1660s, and its desire for 'the compilation of comparable documents'. Bennett sheds light on the role of another early member of the Royal Society, John Aubrey. Aubrey is best remembered as the 'maggotie headed' author of the miscellaneous Brief lives. Bennett shows that although his gullibility and enthusiasm for lost causes made him the archetype of the eccentric 'virtuosi', his biographical sketches were a serious attempt to record 'hints', both to the deeper character of their subjects and also to provide materials for a 'national biography' of the intellectuals of his era. Ratcliff illuminates the career of a less well-known figure of this era, the courtier-inventor Samuel Morland. Morland controlled postal surveillance under Cromwell and Charles II, and gained a reputation as a hydraulic engineer, but was also responsible for the design of two early calculating machines. These increased his favour with Charles II, and drew him into a long-distance patronage relationship with Duke Cosimo de Medici of Florence, who was not, in other respects, an enthusiast for science. McVaugh, meanwhile, charts the professional relationships between surgeon Richard Wiseman, author of a Restoration book of medical case histories, and two of his most important collaborators: the physicians Francis Prujean and Walter Needham. These relationships were very different, but show how the occupational barriers between surgery and 'physic' could be dissolved in practice. Dickson's research into the medical marginalia of the seventeenth-century physician-poet Henry Vaughan reveals further aspects of prac tice life at this time. He shows that despite Vaughan's translations of avant-gard Paracelsian texts, he maintained traditional Galenic humoral medicine in his own rural practice. Cambers considers the phenomenon of memoirs and diary keeping more generally in the seventeenth century, tracing the evolution of the form from the 1580s to the post Restoration era. In contrast to many studies, in which the growth of 'Puritan' diary-keeping is related to a growth in 'individualism', Cambers suggests that spiritual diaries were written to be read by others, even communally, in a form of'scribal publication' that helped draw together religious adherents. This helps restate the communal and external dimen sions of the social history of religion in this period. Certainly, the Presbyterian cleric Richard Baxter believed that a problem shared was a problem halved. T. Cooper uses Baxter's voluminous, and self-obsessed, religious tracts to illustrate Baxter's many and various medical complaints, which persisted despite the attentions of 36 different physicians. Cooper shows how the physician was a constant motif for God in Baxter's work, and how illness was the catalyst for his transformation into a best-selling religious writer. However, these travails also had their more amusing aspects. Baxter's most recurring complaint was 'that Imbecility and Flatulency of my Stomach'. Driven to despair, he swallowed a gold bullet, worth 20-30 shillings. This was only dislodged by fasting and prayer, but unfortunately, in the words of the old joke, it produced very little change.

The irrationality of investors continues to exercise historians of financial markets. The London and Amsterdam markets were integrated closely before the middle of the eigh teenth century, but it has been thought that the London market itself was not. Marco and Malle-Sabouret examine the issue, arguing that the apparent inefficiencies observed some times in the London market arise from an incorrect understanding of India bonds. Such bonds were nominally short-term instruments, but were in practice long-term and con tained put and call options. What appears to be irrational behaviour and a lack of market integration results from a misinterpretation of the properties of the bonds themselves and erroneous valuations of their yields. The interpretation of investment evidence is also taken up by Shea, who, in a lively comment, takes issue with conclusions reached by Dale et al. ('Financial markets can go mad', Economic History Review, LVIII (2005), pp. 233-71) about irrational investor behaviour during the South Sea Bubble. Shea points out their failure to understand fully the legal standing and enforceability of the subscription shares upon which they relied. Their method of data selection resulted in a subset that was overly favourable to their conclusions. Dale et al.'s response is that Shea's own analysis of the standing of the shares is defective, although they admit room for further research. The Bubble Act of 1720 led to a proliferation of private underwriting centred on the Lloyd's coffee house, which later benefited from a boom in marine insurance during the French Wars. The evolution of marine insurance in the wake of the Act is also examined. By the time the Act was repealed in 1824, argues Kingston, Lloyd's had grown a structure sophisticated enough to survive competition from new joint-stock corporations. By con trast, the American marine insurance market had not been restricted in the wake of independence. This resulted in a sharp decline in American private underwriting and the domination of corporations. Edmund Burke's protracted prosecution of Warren Hastings (head of the East India Company) and his staunch objection to the company's monopoly are explored by Murray. Burke's opposition to the corporate body might appear at first contradictory but Murray contrasts Burkean organic conservatism with a conception of the corporate body as 'a hideously undifferentiated mass, where the head is taken for the whole' (p. 66) permitting a more nuanced understanding of Burke's attitudes towards the growth of the modern liberal state. Stern, meanwhile, examines the early history of the company's interests in St Helena, and Nechtman highlights the resentment felt by many Britons towards returning Nabobs whose wealth, it was thought, increased the prices of consumer goods. Bowen extends this theme by charting the careers of the elite command ers of East Indiamen between 1760 and 1813 who were instrumental in forging connec tions between Europe and Asia and who were engaged in lucrative private trading activities within the monopolistic structure of their employer. Cuenca-Esteban argues, contrary to some recent scholarship, that the East India Company was effective in serving the national interest during the French Wars. Prakash, meanwhile, examines the trading networks of English merchants in the Western Indian Ocean in the 1720s and 1730s based on the private papers of the Governor of Bombay. The system of company registration and limited liability enacted in Britain in 1855-6 had long been embodied in Scots law. In that respect, Scots law was 'different and better' than its English counterpart (H. A. Shannon, 'The coming of general limited liability', Economic History, 11 (1931), p. 267 n.2.). Freeman et al. (in English Historical Review), ?C Economic History Society 2009 Economnic History Reviewv, 62, 1 (2009)</page><page sequence="25">REVIEW OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE 177 while acknowledging the greater levels of uncertainty experienced by English unincorpo rated companies before the mid-nineteenth century, claim that the supposed advantages of the Scots system have been exaggerated. Stasavage, meanwhile, examines the question of whether constitutional changes in the wake of the Glorious Revolution improved govern ment access to credit. Although the events of 1688 led to a revolution in public finances, the process was not consolidated until almost three decades later and is more appropriately correlated with the 'Whig supremacy' which, unlike the Tory administration, was more closely associated with government creditors. Recent interest in the ownership and market structure of utilities, meanwhile, is complemented by Tynan's discussion of the divergent views of Nassau Senior and J. S. Mill over London's water supply in the 1830s and 1840s. Senior argued that entry and increasing competition among the London companies would limit price increases as demand increased, whereas Mill saw the water industry as a natural monopoly with entrants attempting merely to share monopoly profits. Political economy continues to spark much debate. Adam Smith's conception of price adjustments in relation to supply and demand and its influence on later general equilib rium theories is discussed by Aspromourgos, while Ahmad provides an appraisal of Lord Lauderdale's early nineteenth-century critique of the Wealth of nations (1776). Craig Keller traces the roots of the Chicago-Austrian school of modern economic thought to Smith's idea that the market will provide solutions to ethical problems, while Groenewegen examines how Alfred Marshall employed Smith's ideas in his own writing. 'New view' interpretations of David Ricardo's writings on wages come under fire from Peach, who provides a study of the reception of such ideas by contemporaries. Ricardo himself did not regard 'new-view' analysis as an important feature of his political economy. Hollander, by contrast, wonders whether the evidence offered by Peach is sufficient to sustain such claims (see also Peach's rejoinder). Meanwhile, de Boyer des Roches reminds us that it was Henry Thornton (1760-1815), rather than Ricardo, who had originated the classical theory of the exchange rate and that Ricardo had actually rejected the idea. Thornton's theory of central banking during the monetary instability of the Napoleonic Wars is charted by Mesonnier. The idea of using the Bank of England's discount rate as an instrument of monetary regulation, it is argued, provided the foundations for the modern understanding of monetary policy. Chiapello, meanwhile, evaluates the influence of accounting practices on economic thought, while Donoghue discusses early attempts by William Thornton (1813-80) to resolve important social problems such as overpopulation, poverty, the poor laws, and Irish land reform using classical economics. The importance of free trade principles in the campaign to repeal stamp duty on newspapers is highlighted by Oats and Sadler, while LoPatin-Lummis reopens the long-running debate over the importance of the 1832 Reform Act with an examination of the contemporary question of whether rate paying or property should form the basic franchise qualification. Finally, Mathias contrib utes a thoughtful assessment of the importance of Defoe's Robinson Crusoe (1719) to the history of economic thought insofar as it offers a model of economic man striving to maximzse living conditions. Crusoe's story (which ran to at least 587 editions before 1900) foreshadowed the value system of the improving entrepreneurs of the industrial revolution. Debates about role of useful knowledge during the industrial revolution figure promi nently. History of Science contributes nearly a hundred pages to a discussion of the implications of Joel Mokyr's Gifts of Athena (2002). Berg provides a concise critique of Mokyr's arguments, while Hilaire-Perez focuses on the conceptual division between 'knowing and doing', stressing the importance of artisanal innovation and technology as functions of public culture. Stewart, in a study of early laboratories, meanwhile, traces the convergence of experimental and industrial interests to the eighteenth century and to elite institutions where scholars such as Davy and Hadley acknowledged the practical applica tions of natural philosophy. Bruland explores the processes of selection and development of useful knowledge during the industrial revolution and argues that social resistance to ? Economic History Society 2009 Economic History Review, 62, 1 (2009)</page><page sequence="26">178 REVIEW OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE technological innovation can be viewed as entirely rational. Mokyr himself restates a central tenet of his treatise, that the technology and efficiency of cotton mills, mines, and shipyards were intimately connected with experimentation, mathematics, and observation, while Jacob offers evidence of how such interconnections might have found their practical application among late eighteenth-century Leeds textiles manufactories. Elsewhere, Howsam et al. provide a concise study of nineteenth-century schoolbooks on classics, mathematics, science, and literature, and Murphy uncovers an unpublished manuscript by the eighteenth-century economist Joseph Massie, thought to have been the outline of a textbook intended for use in Britain's first business school and containing important contributions in the fields of price theory, the role of money, and the rate of interest. Glaisyer, meanwhile, widens our knowledge of financial print culture and the growth of markets by exploring the burgeoning early eighteenth-century market in texts offering advice on interest payments, the main focus being John Castaing's Interest book (1700). Such publications were crucial for business users and suppliers of credit during the 'financial revolution' as well as providing information on government borrowing. Other, informal, modes of transmission of scientific knowledge such as 'talking shop' remained strong, argues Secord, despite the rise of a specialist disciplinary print culture during the nineteenth century-a theme echoed in Barnes's discussion of time and space in midlands Enlightenment thought. Finally, Unwin and Unwin explore the subscriptions to fund the 'great battery' at the Royal Institution in 1808-9 and provide a discussion of early nineteenth-century funding for electrochemical research. Research into coal and cotton remains strong. Clark and Jacks point to sharply differing views over the importance of coal to the industrial revolution. Scholars such as T. S. Ashton, Roy Church, Kenneth Pomeranz, and E. A. Wrigley have afforded coal a crucial role, but recent cliometric studies have downplayed its importance. The authors find in favour of the latter group: productivity growth in coal during the industrial revolution was extremely modest and the conclusions of Wrigley and Pomeranz are 'just speculations'. They conclude that '[w]ithout coal, water power, wind power and firewood alone would have served the energy needs of the industrial revolution economy' (p. 66), although it has to be said that the counterfactual arguments employed appear less than clear. However, new evidence analysed by Bielenberg and Solar provides an unprecedented level of infor mation on the rise and decline of the Irish cotton industry. By the beginning of the nineteenth century, the industry had benefited in technical, organizational, and marketing terms from the British industrial revolution and its workforce had grown to around 30,000. The industry did not enter an absolute decline until the early 1830s, much later than has been thought hitherto. Schwarz, meanwhile, revives a number of issues identified by Eric Hobsbawm in Labouring men (1968), in particular the relationship between piece-rate and time-rate payments of wages in a labour market undergoing rapid diversification. The positions of servants and apprentices for whom the relationship between effort and wages was indirect are also explored. The maritime economy receives abundant coverage. Freeman et al. (in Business History) add to the literature on the coastal trade by throwing light on its governance and the role of innovation in the transition from sail to steam. Nineteenth-century coastal firms led the way in steam-powered shipping and were relatively unhindered by the refuelling problems encountered by inefficient early ocean-going steamers. The coastal trade fostered the first joint-stock companies in the steamship sector. Armstrong and Williams, meanwhile, con tinue their exploration of early steamships by assessing their importance as agents of British modernization before the mid-nineteenth century and Stammers investigates the management of the port of Liverpool leading up to the opening of the first dock in 1715. The British navy in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries contained incentive and promotion structures reminiscent of the tournament-based incentives of many modern corporations, argue Benjamin and Thornberg, and one consequence of this was a highly (C Economic History Society 2009 Economic History Review, 62, 1 (2009)</page><page sequence="27">REVIEW OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE 179 skewed pay structure in the navy compared with the flatter structures on merchant ships. It is common knowledge that throughout the Napoleonic Wars, smugglers operated with vigour across the English Channel. Daly focuses on English coastal communities involved in the flow of contraband during the wars and charts the decline of smuggling in the wake of the Royal Navy blockade of 1817 and the establishment of the National Coast Guard in 1822. Maudlin, meanwhile, charts the pioneering activities of the British Fisheries Society in planning fishing villages in northern Scotland in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, while Barke compares the surprisingly divergent economies and labour forces of two ostensibly similar north-east coastal communities in the mid-nineteenth century, and Revill focuses on the efforts of the engineer William Jessop between 1781 and 1791 to make the Trent River navigable. Finally, McEwen and Werritty gauge the social, economic, and environmental impact of the 'Muckle Spate', a catastrophic flood of 1829 in north-east Scotland which led to eight deaths and the destitution of more than 280 families. The bicentenary of the abolition of the slave trade is marked by a plethora of articles. Despite the British dominance of the eighteenth-century trade in African slaves, the extent to which parliamentary activity influenced the growing eighteenth-century trade has been relatively under-researched. Pettigrew examines parliamentary involvement in the trade between the 1680s and 1714, while Brown looks at the role of parliamentary inquiries: first, in the post- 1688 period, when the question of which interests should have a right to participate in the African trade; and, latterly, during the abolitionist challenges of the decades leading up to 1807, stressing a shift in emphasis from questions of the organization of public finance to ones of human morality. Drescher takes this issue further in examining the dramatic change in both parliamentary and public opinion in the decades following American independence, highlighting, in particular, some of the difficulties encountered in translating public pressure and petitioning into law. Meanwhile, Richardson revisits the 'decline thesis', prevalent since the 1940s, which argued that it was economic factors (relating chiefly to the decline of British West Indian planters and the inefficiency of the slave system) rather than humanitarianism that led ultimately to the Abolition Act. There is little evidence to support the decline thesis, as the planter class was as wealthy in 1807 as it had been in the wake of the War of Independence. The success of abolition shows that the abolitionists were able to reconcile their own humanitarian beliefs with the prosperity of planters and an emergent ethical political economy. In a related study, Rupprecht (in History Workshop J7ournal) traces the ways in which the central argument of Eric Williams's Capitalism and slavery (1944)-that the slave trade provided a major source of capital for early industrialization has informed the present-day drive to procure slavery reparations. Draper, meanwhile, traces the absentee owners of slaves through the records of the Commissioners of Slave Compensation, showing that more than half of the ?20 million in compensation granted to owners of Caribbean slaves under the 1833 Act went to British beneficiaries. Chater, meanwhile, examines wills, diaries, letters, newspapers, and coroners' inquests to examine the position of black people in England before the Abolition Act, while Bressey charts their fortunes in the wake of the Act. The murder of approximately 130 slaves on board the slave ship the Zong in 1781 receives special attention. Krikler highlights the role of Lord Mansfield, the Chief Justice, who justified the killing on the grounds of absolute necessity (due to an outbreak of dysentery and a severe water shortage on board) and lent support to an insurance claim by the ship's owners. Oldham, meanwhile, examines the standard Lloyd's marine policy and the special adaptations for slave cargo, and J. Webster explains how the hearings into the case in 1783 affected marine insurance law relating to 'human cargoes' and provided a focus for campaigning individuals who later played leading roles in the abolitionist movement. Both Rupprecht (in Journal of Legal History) and Armstrong discuss the extent to which the Zong case was later transformed and mytholo gized in the propaganda documents of abolitionists; and McKenzie provides an interesting ?D Economic History Society 2009 Economic History Review, 62, 1 (2009)</page><page sequence="28">180 REVIEW OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE analysis of the ways in which abolitionist rhetoric was employed in Yorkshire elections of 1806 and 1807 to discredit candidates who sought mechanization of the local wool industry. Finally, the intriguing question of whether eighteenth-century Scottish colliers can be compared with slaves is discussed by Lord, who appears to be unaware of an earlier informative article on that topic by P. E. H. Hair ('Slavery and liberty: the case of the Scottish colliers', Slavery and Abolition, 21 (2000), pp. 136-51). The complex world of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century consumption continues to intrigue scholars. The 'calico crisis' in the years preceding the Calico Act of 1821 affected attitudes towards the consumption patterns and morality of female servants. Wigston Smith explains how, by the second decade of the eighteenth century, imported calicoes were seen as a threat to an already depressed English woollen industry. The decline in trade and the high male unemployment rate were blamed on the consumption patterns of domestic servants, although the campaign against the importation of Indian calicoes highlighted, unwittingly, the growing power of the female consumer. Popp investigates the itinerary of an English hardware factor, showing how commercial travelling was well established by the early nineteenth century and played an important integrative role in the early industrial economy, while Stobart examines the role of retailers in eighteenth-century rural Cheshire between 1660 and 1760, a period when the region was undergoing signifi cant economic growth and diversification. The uses of textiles in west midlands gentry homes between 1780 and 1848 are discussed in Ponsonby's study of probate inventories. Berg and Clifford, meanwhile, analyse a large collection of trade cards. Such cards were superior to newspaper advertising in their use of textual and visual imagery and provide a challenge to the assumption that pre-nineteenth century advertising was primitive. Trade cards, therefore, deserve an important position in histories of consumer culture and advertising. Hannis explores Defoe's consumer journalism, while Mitchell discusses the role of eighteenth-century fairs in promoting a variety of local financial transactions, marketing, and retailing activities. By the nineteenth century, their importance had declined, as consumers switched their preference to fixed-shop retailers and as local authorities came to regard fairs increasingly as a nuisance. Beresford and Unsworth, meanwhile, provide a very thorough investigation of archives and maps to chart the early development and growth of the office district of Leeds in the century to 1861. Eighteenth-century crime and disorder, and its reporting, are covered in several articles. Snell investigates the type and frequency of crime reporting in an eighteenth-century Kentish newspaper, while Morgan and Rushton explore the interaction of domestic and colonial debates over crime and punishment. A shift in the reporting of crimes from early eighteenth-century printed sources to newspaper reports is observed by P. King, who concludes that the latter were often 'multi-vocal, sporadic, brief and sometimes chaotic' (p. 76); Devereaux, similarly, examines the collapse of the Old Bailey sessions papers between 1770 and 1800. The role of the English legislature between 1803 and 1861 in standardizing and codifying offences against the person is investigated by Handler. The attempt to introduce universal standards of conduct was, in practice, subject to wide ranging interpretations by the courts themselves. The eighteenth century generally saw a decline in interpersonal crime, but in Portsmouth, as Warner et al. show from an analysis of more than 7,000 assaults committed between 1700 and 1781, there was little significant change in the incidence of violence, largely due to its atypical social structure. Meanwhile, Poole analyses Bristol's reputation as a hotbed of sodomy, together with the difficulties encountered by the local judiciary in the 1730s in securing convictions, and Barrie analyses the political and social struggles of the 1830s and 1840s that led to the decline of the Glasgow Police Commission. Much of the history of domestic violence has focused predominantly on violence between men and women. G. Smith seeks to widen the scope of such studies to include abuse of children, servants, and apprentices. Problems of evidence abound, since much 'c Economic History Society 2009 Economic History Reviewv, 62, 1 (2009)</page><page sequence="29">REVIEW OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE 181 violence was regarded at the time as an integral function of day-to-day discipline. Cases of domestic violence in Hanoverian London are routinely absent from sources such as the Old Bailey sessions papers, and Smith discusses the use of alternative sources drawn from the records of the court of King's Bench, police and magistrates' reports, and archives of charitable institutions for the children of the poor. Gray, too, observes that almost all research on the treatment of crime by the courts has been based on records of the higher courts: evidence of case resolution in the summary court records has never been fully exploited. Reports of coroners' inquests are essential sources for the study of the history of violent death, argues Fisher, but levels of murder, suicide, and accidents may be signifi cantly under recorded in such sources because of a variety of pressures and restrictions under which coroners operated in the 1 840s and 1 850s. Radical disorder receives attention from Swift, who throws light on a neglected aspect of the policing of Chartist disturbances-the employment of special constables-whose powers were extended by a statute of 1831 which permitted Justices of the Peace to appoint as many as they deemed sufficient to maintain public order. Custer, meanwhile, gets to grips with what Anna Clark has called the 'fatal flaws of misogyny and patriarchy' (The struggle for the breeches: gender and the making of the British working-class, 1995, p. 271) which have obscured the role of women in English working-class radicalism between 1770 and 1820; and Blackstock focuses on the 'Tommy Downshires', an early nineteenth-century Ulster protest group, suggesting that not all such groups were sectarian in nature. Interest in agriculture and agricultural society remains buoyant. Brunt provides an analysis of the use of off-farm manures during the industrial revolution. Most off-farm nitrogenous fertilizers were forms of industrial or urban waste and their availability was, therefore, related closely to the spread of industrialization. The use of such waste in agriculture was widespread by 1700, but enjoyed only modest growth thereafter up to the mid-nineteenth century. Nonetheless, such sources of manure increased grain yields during that period by up to 20 per cent. Before the introduction of artificial fertilizers, guano provided farmers with an excellent balance of phosphates, potash, and nitrogen, and Cordle discusses the remarkable level of cooperation between agriculturalists and the navy in achieving its importation in the mid-nineteenth century. McKichan examines the proprietorship of a Highland estate (Seaforth) during the first phase of clearance, while S. Webster examines the role of land agents for English landed estates between 1770 and 1850, suggesting that their role was concerned predominantly with financial, legal, and political matters rather than day-to-day management issues. Burnette's study of female work on some south-western farms shows that mothers of bastard children, along with widows, were far less likely to be employed as agricultural labourers than were middle-aged married women, while Ganev provides a tantalizing insight into the sexual behaviour of milkmaids and ploughboys in eighteenth-century England. Studies of poverty focus upon institutions and agency. C. Smith continues her analysis of the administration of the Northampton General Lunatic Atsylum, stressing the con tinuing importance of subscriptions and highlighting the success of local authorities in evading responsibility for funding asylums in the wake of the prescriptive Lunacy Acts, 1845. Williams, meanwhile, uncovers a valuable archive of child health records from Northampton Infirmary that provides an insight into the infirmary environment and the treatment of sick children in the mid-eighteenth century. The foundation of the London Magdalen Hospital for Penitent Prostitutes in the 1750s is characterized by Peace as part of a Whiggish discourse of improvement in which bankers and merchants who supported the project could 'assert a truce between virtue and commerce' (p. 126), while S. King examines the rhetoric of pauper letters from Essex, Northamptonshire, and Lancashire to throw further light on the experiences of the sick poor a relatively under-researched group compared with others dependent upon the poor law. Healey adds to the current debate about the extent to which the poor could influence policy on relief by highlighting ? Economic History Society 2009 Economic History Review, 62, 1 (2009)</page><page sequence="30">182 REVIEW OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE the attempts in the early eighteenth-century of a north Lancashire widow to increase her level of parish relief (and the manoeuvrings of the overseers in their attempts to prevent it), and Handley scrutinizes the administration of the poor law in mid-nineteenth-century Chester. The Thompsonian idea of the Speenhamland system as the embodiment of an older 'moral economy' is revived by Jones for the period after the FrenchWars.The 'Swing' disturbances of the 1830s were rooted in an atmosphere of consensus and within a 'complex web of local social relations that took its most visible and concrete form at the vestry table' (p. 287): the progenitors of the poor law reforms of 1834 understood this very well. A central aspect of the ideology underpinning the dismantling of the moral economy was the attempt to abolish any form of outdoor relief. In this context, Wells questions the assertion by Broad (in Agricultural History Review, 2000) that the Poor Law Commission disposed compulsorily of much publicly-owned social housing after 1834. Although the Commission was charged with the sale of such property, decisions about the disposal of parish housing was subject ultimately, according to statute, to a ballot of local property owners. Lyle continues her exploitation of the Rural Queries elicited by the Poor Law Commission in 1832, mapping regional agricultural wage variations and restating the extreme localism of parish relief payments under the old poor law. Local magistrates calculated maintenance payments to mothers of bastard children in direct proportion to the local agricultural wage. Wall, meanwhile, examines tax assessments to measure the proportions of taxpayers who were either widows or unmarried women compared with male taxpayers in the adult population. Health and population studies provide much discussion of the basic variables of demo graphic change. Woods compares evidence from lying-in hospitals with wider demographic statistics to throw further light on the factors affecting fetal health, suggesting that stillbirth levels might be set against evidence of maternal mortality in order to assess better the effectiveness of midwifery. There were significant advances in practice during the eigh teenth century (probably due to a wider diffusion of midwifery textbooks and the use of forceps), though there was 'very little improvement thereafter until the late 1930s' (p. 757). A reconsideration of the overarching categories used conventionally to describe the modern epidemiological transition is urged by Condrau and Worboys. The assumption of a simple decline in infectious diseases is thrown into question by a recent government report suggesting that the category accounted for only 33 per cent of deaths in the period 1848-72, while two-thirds of deaths were attributed to non-infectious disease or unknown causes. Mooney, however, has taken issue with elements of that interpretation, arguing among other things that the levels of infectious disease accepted by Condrau and Worboys arise from an excessively narrow set of definitions. The true proportion of mortality from infectious disease in large centres of population probably reached 50 per cent. Meanwhile, Hunter examines sanitary improvements in Berwick-upon-Tweed in the wake of the cholera epidemic of 1848-9. Responses to epidemics were essentially reactive, though they did ultimately help to facilitate public health reforms. Komlos, meanwhile, compares the heights of both rich and poor English youths in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, noting that the heights of the poor declined most dramatically in the late eighteenth century and again during the 1 830s and 1 840s, lending support to a pessimistic view of living standards among the very poor during the industrial revolution. The average height of the English rich, meanwhile, was only an inch shorter than the present-day United States average. Comeau, meanwhile, demonstrates the persistence of gender influ ences on cancer classifications in nineteenth-century Britain, and Miller and Hochberg use demographic, administrative, and commercial data to illuminate Ireland's pre-famine colonial past. The first act for the registration of births, deaths, and marriages was passed for England andWales in 1836, but not for Scotland until 1854.This delay has not been explained fully. Cameron explores eight earlier bills for Scottish registration and ascribes their failure to the @ Economic History Society 2009 Economic History Review, 62, 1 (2009)</page><page sequence="31">REVIEW OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE 183 objection of the Scottish churches to particular clauses relating to the provision of new administrative facilities, the payment of registrars, and reform of the marriage laws. Paradoxically, when finally enacted, the Scottish legislation resulted in a much greater level of detail in the registers. Despite a substantial literature on nineteenth-century census enumerators, little is known about the registrars themselves. Mills et al. examine the appointment in 1837 of two registrars of births and deaths, highlighting how the registra tion system worked at the local level, while Nicolini uses a vector auto regression to suggest that endogenous adjustment of population to real wages (central to Malthus's systemati zation of the demographic regime) operated only until the seventeenth century. Finally, Wrigley extends John Rickman's attempts in the 1 830s to construct estimates of eighteenth-century English county populations and shows that it is possible, certainly for the later eighteenth century, to produce more accurate estimates, at both county and hundred level. Such work has important implications for current research on the relation ship between occupation structure and economic growth in eighteenth- and nineteenth century England.

(v) 1850-1945 MARIK FREEMAN and JULIAN GREAVES University of Glasgow; University of Birmingham Two themes stand out particularly in this year's economic history journals: the costs and benefits of empire and the nature of corporate governance in Britain. Other important topics include: comparative economic performance; the future direction of business history; the economics of warfare; and the workings of the labour market. In the social and cultural history of the period, leisure, sport, and social policy again feature heavily, while new directions are proposed in both urban and rural history. Global economic integration post-1870 was again prominent in the periodical literature but there are fewer pieces on Britain's relations with Europe and North America and rather more on interactions with Asia, Africa, and (to a lesser degree) Australasia. Jeffrey ( Economic History Society 2009 Economic History Review, 62, 1 (2009)</page><page sequence="35">REVIEW OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE 187 Williamson's work on globalization inspires a special issue of the Australian Economic History Review but the resulting case study evidence gives only partial support to his theories on trade expansion leading to relative factor price convergence. Austin, in a piece on pre-1940 British Ghana, is typical of most contributors in also highlighting institutional changes (affecting land, labour, and technology patterns) that reshaped agriculture. In Ghana's case, this facilitated the growth of cash crops like cocoa and sugar. Of course, trying to measure the 'imperial effect' on overall trade patterns is fraught with difficulty, but Magee attempts this for Britain using a gravity model. He finds the pull effects were not as great as might be expected when compared to other factors like income growth, but they operated most strongly between the 1920s and 1950s. Several articles challenge Niall Fergusson's view that the effects of British colonial investment were positive. Huff samples eight tropical countries and argues that before 1939, borrowing was unnecessarily constrained by the reluctance of colonial authorities to levy tax, a view endorsed by Bigon's case study of the Lagos tramway system where under-funding precipitated closure. Booth's survey of European colonialism in south-east Asia also points to under-investment, particularly in relatively rich dependencies like Malaya, although the money that was spent did have positive consequences for growth. Of course, there was no guarantee that more active state management would deliver better results. Indeed, the interwar years saw some notable disappointments in this regard. Ewer offers a damning verdict on the empire airmail scheme between Britain and Australia in the 1930s, while Powell shows why proposals to harness imperial forestry resources after 1920 came to little. Articles on non-imperial aspects of the international economy were less numerous. There is some interesting material on the role of the London capital markets in financing investment in China in the 70 years before the Second World War in Goetzmann et al., while Coleman examines pre-1914 gold movements between New York, Paris, and London, questioning the use of relative price data as a proxy for transaction costs, while Foreman-Peck et al. argue that Britain and the US had little to gain from international tariff cooperation in the 1930s, as it was domestic policy errors that made the world slump so severe. Other transnational work focuses either on comparative economic performance or on war-related themes. Taking the comparative aspect first, Prados de la Escosura analyses European economic development since 1850, to discern whether individual countries have followed a common development model. Some support is given to Ger schenkron's theory that latecomers tend to have higher investment rates, less productive agriculture, and more interventionist governments. Huberman and Minns demonstrate that the tendency for North Americans to work longer hours than their European coun terparts dates back to at least the late nineteenth century. Meanwhile, two new studies published in the IJournal of Economic History confirm the long-term similarity of Anglo German productivity in manufacturing. Broadberry and Burhop attempt to reconcile benchmark and time series data for the period 1875-1938, while Fremdling et al. focus specifically on the mid- 1930s, offering a new dataset on German value added. Both studies confirm that considerable differences existed at the individual industry level and refine previous estimates in this regard. Turning to war-related topics, Imlay offers a comparison with France rather than Germany in coming to a generally favourable verdict on British rearmament in the 1930s, while Caruana and Rockoff examine the effectiveness of Allied oil sanctions in curbing Spain's pro-German inclinations in the 1940s. Switching to the First World War, Eloranta models the military budgets of 16 major powers before 1914 and offers the intriguing suggestion that under-spending by Britain and America inadvertently encouraged weaker economic powers to engage in a competitive arms race which might otherwise have been avoided. In the war period itself, Greenhalgh claims that ultimate Allied victory was delayed by inadequate Anglo-French cooperation in the munitions sphere, while Nason and Vahey reassess Britain's domestic financing of the war effort. - Economic History Society 2009 Economic History Review, 62, 1 (2009)</page><page sequence="36">188 REVIEW OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE This proved to be another significant year for business history and indeed its flagship journal, now expanded to six issues a year. The new Business History editorial team of Charles Harvey and John Wilson set out their intention to give the discipline a more rigorous methodological edge, moving it closer to the mainstream social sciences. However, this proposed repositioning is not to everyone's taste. Some business historians clearly fear that a craving for wider recognition, particularly in a business school context, will only occur at the expense of rigorous historical enquiry. It is on this basis that Lloyd-Jones and Lewis cross swords with Toms and Wilson over previous attempts by the latter to model British corporate behaviour. Whatever the future holds, many fruitful lines of enquiry were pursued, particularly in the fields of corporate governance and business ethics. Hannah (in Business History) continues to overturn previously accepted wisdom on large firms, showing that by 1900 the divorce between corporate ownership and control was more pronounced in Britain and France than in the US. Elsewhere (in Enterprise and Society), he surveys the London Stock Exchange in 1900, arguing that by contemporary standards it offered a fairly efficient framework of corporate governance. A high level of institutional development, readily available expertise, and relative transparency all played a part. The result was a reasonable balance between flexibility and shareholder protection without too much legal codification. Many of Hannah's generalizations are tested in some way by specialized work elsewhere. Brayshay et al. sample a dozen London-based multinational enterprises in 1899-1900 and 1929-30, uncovering hundreds of interlocking directorships with other firms. In their view, this underlines the depth and sophistication of British corporate capitalism, a point that also emerges from McKercher and Enjamio's study of British financial consortia operating in Cuba before 1914 and Lees's analysis of Penang Rubber Estates Ltd, a London-based free-standing company trading in Malaya in the same period. It is one of the key safeguard mechanisms for shareholders and creditors, namely the rise of the company accountant, which interests Anderson et al. They show how membership screening by the newly created Institute of Chartered Accountancy helped define the nature of expertise in that profession in the late nineteenth century. Cooper, meanwhile, examines early attempts to define goodwill on company books. Another protection mechanism, namely trust, is addressed by Crump et al., who use an obscure H. G. Wells novel (The wife of Sir Isaac Harman, 1914) to try and gain insights into pre-1914 business ethics, and by Benson, who questions the link between public standing and private morality in the late Victorian/ Edwardian era. His study of a notorious Wolverhampton publican family suggests that deviant social behaviour was not necessarily fatal to a business reputation unless com pounded by actual financial difficulties. Several articles paint British corporate governance and accountability in a somewhat less favourable light than Hannah. Guinnane et al. argue that the civil law business codes of France and Germany actually gave smaller firms more options than the common law systems of Britain and the US. Crafts et al. highlight the scope for agency problems and inter-firm collusion, blaming this for the poor productivity performance of Britain's rail companies in the second half of the nineteenth century. Similarly, Scott and Newton argue that limited competition between the clearing banks after the First World War hindered institutional innovation in small-firm finance. Misplaced trust could also lead to fraudulent activity, and three lesser-known financial scandals feature in the literature. Taylor recounts the Royal British Bank collapse of 1856; Crumplin charts the downfall of the Isle of Man bank Dumbell's in the 1890s; while Cox recounts the abortive attempt by Tobacco Securities Trust to corner the pepper market in the 1930s. Finally, of course, business systems were not immune from politics. O'Rourke demonstrates how nationalism and sectarianism hindered the formation of efficient milk cooperatives in Ireland before 1914, while Greaves considers how the real or imagined machinations of governments distracted British ship owners from their underlying competitive weaknesses in the 1930s. ?? Economic History Society 2009 Economic History Review, 62, 1 (2009)</page><page sequence="37">REVIEW OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE 189 Only a few of the other numerous business-related articles can be mentioned here. Rose and Carnevali examine the expanding markets for boys' clothing and jewellery respectively in the nineteenth century, showing how fashion and mass production were used in tandem to expand sales. Barnett explains how two popular novelists tried to breathe life into the ailing British film industry after the FirstWorld War, while Milne looks at the early business use of telephones. Finally, Honeyman reviews the place of gender in British business history, a theme also prominent in Robertson et al.'s examination of the use of music in the workplace at Cadbury and Rowntree. A number of articles focus on labour market behaviour, but there is no dominant theme. Long and Ferrie use census data to track long-term changes in British and American occupational mobility, concluding that while American society was more fluid in the late nineteenth century, the two countries had largely converged by the mid-twentieth. Hatton finds that, since 1871, periods of rapid productivity growth in Britain have tended to react favourably on unemployment levels, but this only partially explains long-term trends in joblessness. Elsewhere Seltzer and Frank analyse the internal labour market at Williams Deacon's Bank; Hart re-examines female rates of pay in engineering factories during the Second World War; and Blackburn charts the rocky history of British minimum wage legislation since 1909. Urban life and culture is the subject of a number of articles, often focusing on the relationships between economic and socio-political change. Suburbs feature in two. In an important survey of suburban history, McManus and Ethington propose a new research agenda centred on the evolution, rather than the creation, of suburbs. The built environ ment, landscape, social relations, and cultures of suburbs change in ways that are as yet imperfectly understood. French calls for more research into nineteenth-century suburban life, with his examination of Surbiton between 1851 and 1891 emphasizing the heteroge neity of the community in terms of origins and male employment patterns, as well as the growing importance of female domestic service. Surbiton became increasingly middle class over time, but retained a large population of skilled and semi-skilled workers who served the community's needs. In a rather different vein, Ziegler analyses journalistic representations of the City of London in the nineteenth century the place and the economic life that it represented-to illustrate the 'delicate interaction of processes of cultural and economic change'. The depopulation of the City and the growth of financial capitalism were widely and critically represented in a range of periodicals and newspapers. Associational life is also considered widely. Roberts examines ceremonies marking the opening of new water supplies in nineteenth-century towns, seeing these rituals as signifi cant aspects of the burgeoning civic culture of the period. Ceremonies fostered civic unity, which had often been fractured because of the contested nature of the municipal politics of water. Focusing on Grimsby, Shinner explores the relationship between infrastructural development, social structure, and urban politics in an expanding town in the nineteenth century, showing how middle-class identity was shaped by political participation rather than by the wider forms of social and philanthropic activity that characterized many urban communities. Looking at interwar Britain, McCarthy examines middle-class associational culture, concentrating on the British Legion, the National Federation of Women's Insti tutes, Rotary International, and the League of Nations Union. This article challenges the argument that such movements represented a depoliticization of social life, and hence bolstered informal Conservatism, and emphasizes the importance of non-political volun tary organization in the culture of the period. For the nineteenth century, Morgan dis cusses the culture and politics of testimonials, arguing that these gifts and associated rituals embodied a variety of motivations: for example, testimonials from workers to factory owners fulfilled more complex functions than simply symbolizing worker deference. The identity and scope of rural history is being reconsidered on both sides of the Atlantic, as demonstrated by a special issue of Agricultural History on 'New directions in ? Economic History Society 2009 Economic History Review, 62, 1 (2009)</page><page sequence="38">190 REVIEW OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE rural history', and by Burchardt in the Historical _Journal. Burchardt surveys English agricultural and rural historiography over the last century. He criticizes the long-standing tendency to conflate the histories of agriculture and the countryside a tendency still easily discernible, even among many of the best rural historians-and explores the parallel historiography of 'ruralism', arguing that this strand of the literature should move away from its current high-cultural fixations and draw on a larger range of sources to create a 'social history of the rural idyll'. Rural paternalism is discussed in three articles. In a local study of Holton-le-Moor in north Lincolnshire in the early twentieth century, Olney discusses the role of a landowner in a 'closed' village community, identifying a blend of paternalism and communitarianism in his outlook, which may have been shared widely among the smaller gentry. Hattersley focuses on education in rural Northumberland in the second half of the nineteenth century, linking the involvement of the local gentry in the support and management of schools to the receipt of government grants and to wider patterns of local philanthropy and social leadership. Moses discusses the survival and growth of farm service in the East Riding ofYorkshire in the later nineteenth century, while pointing out that some of the paternalistic aspects of the system declined, particularly the practice of masters and men living under the same roof. Reacting to these developments, the increasingly socially engaged Anglican clergy advanced a powerful critique of the social consequences of the nomadic lives and unregulated activities of farm servants. Short and Godfrey offer a detailed analysis of the Edwardian 'land campaign' at Arundel in Sussex, using a micro-historical approach to illustrate the localized and fragmented nature of the controversy, and the relationship between national debates and local circumstances. Public health was an important theme of the social policy historiography. Sanitary inspection is the subject of an article by Crook that emphasizes the professionalization of inspection in the nineteenth century in the context of scientific developments and the increased interventionism of the local state. However, liberalism set cultural limits to interventionism in the form of a culture of civility and respect for private property that informed the activities of sanitary inspectors. Zweiniger-Bargielowska examines the health education campaigns of the New Health Society, established in 1925, which advocated healthy eating, exercise, and better personal hygiene. The Society focused on personal morality and was reluctant to acknowledge the relationship between poverty and ill health. Other articles address local case studies. Hanley, in a study of drainage in mid-nineteenth century NVhitechapel, focuses on the financing of sanitary reform and the resultant com plexities of the relationship between local and central government, as well as the crucial role that could be played by the judiciary in cases of rating. MacLachlan examines the campaigns against private slaughterhouses in nineteenth-century London, and the successful efforts of butchers' organizations to preserve them. Richardson describes the response of the Uppingham (Rutland) rural sanitary authority and local medical opinion to the typhoid outbreaks of 1875-7, and the relationship of the local authority to the recently established Local Government Board. Clark examines the 'refuse revolution' in Torquay, in a case study of changes in waste disposal in the late nineteenth century. The introduction of a refuse destructor was presented as an embodiment of modernity, but its location and environmental impact provoked local opposition. These concerns prefigured the decline of incineration as a method of waste disposal in the twentieth century. Ritvo examines another environmental controversy, that occasioned by the attempt of Manches ter City Council to build a reservoir in the Lake District, and concludes that the strengths and weaknesses of the (unsuccessful) case for the defence of the landscape have echoes in contemporary environmentalism. The role of professionals and other groups in social policy and related activities was also a notable theme. Nottingham discusses the history of the 'insecure professionals'-schoolteachers, nurses, and social workers of various kinds who occupied a distinctive space in the social hierarchy, on low incomes and with uncertain professional ?)

Focusing on the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, Nottingham shows how these professions tried to become less 'insecure' by achieving the status of the higher professions, but do not achieve all the defining features of the latter, resulting in a 'limited autonomy'. Another 'insecure profession' was that of the school attendance officer. Sheldon shows that, in the first half of the twentieth century, there was an identifiable shift in their role, from one of policing to one centred on welfare, but that there were limits to this change, and to the extent to which communities abandoned their hostility to school attendance officers. McDermid discusses the career of Grace Paterson, honorary secretary of the Glasgow School of Cookery and a long-standing member of Glasgow's school board. Paterson personified the professionalized form of philanthropy and social service that characterized this period, and had an important civic role, albeit one that is often hidden in the surviving sources. Logan reconsiders the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act, 1919, which historians have often considered ineffective, and shows that, in combi nation with a vigorous feminist campaign, it led to a rapid increase in the representation of women on magistrates' benches in England and Wales. This was a key development in the promotion of 'equal citizenship' in the interwar period. One of these early female magis trates was the influential socialist economist Barbara Wootton, whose early life as an 'activist academic' is described by Jacobs. Wootton was a key figure in the development of the economics of planning between the wars. Finally, Perriton draws attention to the British Federation of Business and Professional Women, established in 1935, recovering the history of a little-known women's organization, and arguing that it can be considered feminist in its aims and approaches; Perriton uses the modern term 'femocracy' to describe these women's activities. Leisure and sport again featured heavily in the literature. Kennedy and Kennedy draw attention to the large number of Irish football teams formed in Liverpool in the late nineteenth century, none of which became large professional clubs. This 'retardation' is explained by the relative indifference of the Irish Catholic hierarchy and nationalist politicians in the city, and of the accommodation of the Irish into other clubs, especially Everton and Liverpool FC. In a special issue of the International Journal of the History of Sport on swimming, Love examines the growth of municipal swimming facilities under the provisions of the Baths and Washhouses Acts in the later nineteenth century, showing that swimming 'had become a notable feature of life in English cities' by 1914. Johnes examines pigeon racing, undermining the notion that this was a solely working-class leisure activity, and illustrating the multiple cultural meanings of the pastime. Lack of money and other material constraints restricted many working-class men's participation. Kay establishes the popularity of sporting and other leisure pursuits among women's suffrage activists, showing that many led active lives beyond their campaigning activities. The cinema in London before the First World War is the subject of an article by McKernan, who analyses the geographical spread of the early cinemas, and recovers the experience of attending, emphasizing the low prices and continuous showings that characterized this period. Low admission prices are also discussed by James, who examines Miners' Institute cinemas in south Wales in the 1930s. These provided a focus for the community in addition to their entertainment functions. Popular films often featured resolute individuals overcoming challenging circumstances, although comedies-and many British films were also shown. Bailey notes that the music hall underwent a revival in the 1930s, and discusses its changing role in popular culture and national identity. Four articles by Huggins consider sport, society, and the cinema in interwar Britain. In the J7ournal of Social History, he examines increasingly tolerant public and legislative attitudes towards betting, and the emergence of new opportunities to bet, such as grey hound racing and the football pools. He argues that the wide social appeal of betting undermines histories of leisure that focus on class differences. In Contemporary British History, Huggins analyses the BBC's sport coverage, showing how an early focus on elite ?) Economic History Society 2009 Economic History Review, 62, 1 (2009)</page><page sequence="40">192 REVIEW OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE sports gave way to a wider mix in the 1 930s. The promotion of a 'national' sporting culture was affected by the relationship between the BBC and other organizations, especially sports' governing bodies. In the International J7ournal of the History of Sport, Huggins shows how the portrayal of football in cinema newsreels promoted a conservative version of sport, class relations, and nationhood, and urges greater use of newsreels by historians. In the Women's History Review, he explains how newsreel coverage of women's sport extended the visibility of women's sporting activity, but at the same time perpetuated a conservative view of women's social roles by diminishing their achievements in comparison to those of men. Finally, three articles in the Sociological Review examine the early history of the disci pline. Goldman challenges long-standing arguments that British sociology failed, or was 'absent', compared with other countries. He asserts that sociological debates informed many aspects of academic and political debate in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and that this very success militated against the establishment of a separate academic discipline in Britain. Studholme argues that Patrick Geddes should be seen as an important environmental sociologist, and dismisses recent critiques of his work as anach ronistic and unfair. She identifies similarities with Durkheim, especially in Geddes's earlier work, on which his ideas about 'civics' were based. Scott and Husbands describe the establishment of the Sociological Society and Sociological Review by Victor Branford, and suggest that Branford's sociological ideas remain relevant today, and that, in particular, the social survey embodied the public role of the sociologist, which was intimately connected with social reconstruction.

That said, we begin with the history of economic thought, in which Hodgson argues for a modern revival of Veblenian institu tional and evolutionary economics. De La Grandville thinks that the potential of the Solow growth model has yet to be fully tapped. Murphy looks again at the celebrated Cambridge capital controversy of the 1950s and 1960s, while Fontaine explores the way in which postwar economists accepted that selfishness and self-reliance alone cannot achieve social cohesion. Turning more specifically to economic history, David examines the implications of non-ergodic path-dependence dynamics for economic policy analysis and for public policy affecting endogenous technological change and institutional evolution. Nelson thinks that, despite recent and widespread fascination with the role of institutions in economic change, it is unlikely that we will identify a single small set of institutions that are necessary or sufficient to support economic productivity and growth. Nonetheless, he thinks the exer cise could help us understand better how institutions promote growth. A fascinating study by Epstein et al. suggests that golden age trade patterns helped to create middle- and high-income clusters of economies, but that similar trade patterns (dominated by the rich economies) do not seem to explain their perpetuation thereafter. Crafts explores the way in which America's large initial postwar productivity advantage was eroded by rapid European catch-up growth, evaluating claims that the latter was subsequently undermined by weak competition and by excessive regulation and taxation. Coutts and Norman investigate the extent to which the increased integration of UK industry into global competition modified the pricing of UK-produced goods in domestic markets. Matthews questions the notion that British manufacturing did not fail in the years between 1950 and 1973. A timely analysis of UK money demand in the period 1873-2001 by Nielson confirms a significant link between excess money and inflation. Gurkaynak et al. provide us with the Federal Reserve Board's daily Treasury yield curve estimates from 1961. In the world of international currency markets, Eichengreen and Hatase examine Japan's ending of its currency peg in 1971, concluding that a rapidly-growing, export-oriented economy can safely exit a peg for a managed float despite the presence of capital controls and the absence of sophisticated foreign currency forward markets. A fascinating and very detailed analysis by Oliver and Hamilton of the defence of sterling in the five years after the 1967 devaluation outlines contingency plans for blocking the sterling balances, discussions with the US on the reform of the international monetary system, and the preparations made for floating the pound after the collapse of the Bretton Woods settlement in 1972.

Phillips discusses industrial relations in coal mining and dock-working in the 1960s and 1970s. His article treads familiar ground, but is a timely reminder of the role that economic contingencies can play in shaping industrial conflict. Lastly, Barwell and Schweitzer find that real rigidities in UK wage setting between 1978 and 1998 were more prevalent than nominal rigidities, and that in down-turns firms dealt with such rigidities by laying off workers. As last year, this was a busy year in business history. While business historians have examined the role of acquisitions in the postwar restructuring of the advanced economies, the historical and management literatures have been poorly integrated. Jones addresses some of the issues in his case study of Unilever's use of acquisitions to build the world's largest ice cream and tea businesses. Turning to rather less successful stories, two illumi nating articles consider company failures. McGovern analyses the decline of Dunlop, arguing that its protected home market and anti-competitive strategies contributed to management complacency and inertia that left it poorly placed to cope with increased competition after the mid-1 950s.Then, focusing on a firm that represented one of the most spectacular of all postwar company failures, followed by an equally spectacular revival, D. Smith examines Rolls Royce's development of its civil aerospace business since 1945. Studies of wholesaling are uncommon, but this year we have two: Manton notes that in 1945 the Labour Party was determined to nationalize the wholesaling industry and considers why it remained in private hands; and Quinn and Sparks explore the evolution of grocery wholesaling in Ireland and Britain since 1930, noting that the evolutionary pathways here differ from those seen in manufacturing. In financial services, Batiz-Lazo and Wardley examine technological innovation and mechanization by British banks and building societies; Billings and Capie use archival evidence to demonstrate that banks maintained much higher levels of capital in the half-century before 1970 than implied by their published accounts, without reduced or less risky lending; and Austin and Uche examine the causes and consequences of the collusion between Barclays and the Bank of British West Africa in that region. Also in West Africa, Decker notes that British businesses created a publicity strategy in the 1950s that couched their presence in terms of a positive contribution to newly independent states' development, modernity, and industrialization, but, with the passage of time, felt compelled to 'Africanize' their corporate image. Turning to the transport industry, Crompton uses the Port of London Authority and London Transport as historical comparators in examining the British government's replacement of Railtrack with a not-for-profit company, Network Rail. Offer discusses information asymmetries in the context of the Akerlof 'lemons' model, seeing the marked difference between the price of new and virtually new cars in the 1950s and 1960s as explained largely by dealer warranties. Boschma and Wenting consider the importance of location to the success of UK car manufacturers, suggesting that spinoff dynamics, agglom eration economies, and time of entry had a significant effect on survival rates. Then, concentrating on a single car plant, Gilmour provides a fascinating study of industrial relations at Linwood using local and national union records. Gilmour's article is one of several on postwar British industrial relations. For example, McKinley and Quinn consider the transformation of relations between employers and unions in commercial television since 1979. Their insightful article charts the ways in which the destruction of the entrenched power of craft unions by the employers at once Balkanized the industry and, ironically, weakened its market power. Union attitudes towards European immigrants have rarely been studied in a postwar context and Phillips et al. address this in their study of the Lancashire cotton industry between 1946 and 1951. Likewise, the political significance of legislation in the 1960s and 1970s giving greater rights to workers has been little explored. Whiting's interesting discussion suggests that it sought both to recognize the complexity of work in a modern society and preserve ? Economic History Society 2009 Economic History Review, 62, 1 (2009)</page><page sequence="45">REVIEW OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE 197 managerial authority. Ultimately, however, he finds that the reforms served a Conservative agenda via individualized contracts of employment and marginalized trade unions. In a busy year in the history of science and technology, we begin with Sch6n's analysis of the role of industrial innovation in relation to traditional and new growth theories on post-1950 convergence/divergence among advanced capitalist economies. Elsewhere, in a study of the first transatlantic telephone cable, Hills sets out to demonstrate how regula tion, markets, and technology can be intertwined; and Clarke considers the use made by the Colonial Office of scientific research funding in its attempt to restore the credibility of colonial policy by stimulating colonial development. Two fascinating studies examine research and development. Horrocks reminds us that the foreign-owned R&amp;D laboratories in the UK have long served as sites for international scientific and technological collaboration and exchange, thus demonstrating that cross border industrial research networks are far from a new phenomenon. Then, in a case study of R&amp;D in the electronics revolution, Hyungsub examines RCA in the late 1940s, when the firm deliberately broke down the boundary between the laboratory and the factory. Within a decade, however, RCA was utterly compartmentalized and Hyungsub places this shift in the context of broader changes in US political economy, such as postwar demobilization, military funding for industrial R&amp;D, antitrust consent decrees, and rapid technical change. Finally, we are all familiar with Solow's famous IT productivity paradox, but the focus tends to be on the productivity effects of IT rather than on its own productivity growth. Nordhaus analyses computer performance over the last century and a half, highlighting its phenomenal increase and the major break in trend around the Second World War. In the process, he demonstrates that performance-based measures produce price declines markedly larger than those reported in official statistics. Turning now to political economy, Goodfriend surveys developments in monetary policy since the disarray of the 1970s, and considers how an apparent working consensus on the core principles of monetary policy subsequently emerged. Assessing the politicization of postwar British monetary policy, Burnham argues that a distinction needs to be drawn between Treasury influence and alleged ministerial interventions for short-term political gain. O'Hara considers why attempts by the government in the 1950s and 1960s to improve Britain's official economic statistics were not more successful. In a special issue of Contemporary British History on the 1964 general election, Fielding questions the extent to which Labour's electioneering marked a break with the past, seeing the party's election strategy as in most respects merely venturing slightly further down a Gaitskellite road. Tomlinson suggests that Labour's focus on economic modernization owed more to declinism among political elites than popular concerns, with voters worrying more about inflation than growth. Wrigley highlights the 1964 Rookes v. Barnard judge ment as encouraging trade unions to mobilize their members to vote Labour. Moving forward in time, Thomas looks at the long-term impact of the 1978-9 'winter of discontent' on British politics. Sillars examines the history of the Thatcherite 'right to buy' initiative. Tomlinson (in British Politics) emphasizes the importance of economic 'decline' as a Thatcherite electoral trope in 1979 and 1983, but is highly critical of the economic policies implemented to reverse it. In an intriguing article, Clift and Tomlin son challenge the assumed exhaustion of the Keynesian political economic paradigm, arguing that, although New Labour explicitly renounced 'fine tuning', its redesign of Britain's macroeconomic policy framework and institutions created a capacity for 'coarse tuning'. Turning to foreign policy, Marsh uses Iran's nationalization of its oil industry in the early 1950s to argue that the UK and US governments found the major oil companies to be indispensable in addressing the crisis, but that this served to impose de facto limits on Anglo-American 'crude diplomacy'. S. C. Smith explores the attempted incorporation of Malta into the UK in the 1950s, noting that Whitehall's enthusiasm waned as the costs of (C Economic History Society 2009 Economic History Review, 62, 1 (2009)</page><page sequence="46">198 REVIEW OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE extending the welfare state to the Maltese sank in. Additionally, Strange explores the political economy of British trade union policy towards the European Economic Commu nity in the 1960s and 1970s. We move on now to social history. Gregg et al. suggest that maternity rights had a profound effect on employment, but one that was of most benefit to the better educated and higher paid. Changes in the roles of women within society and the family are explored in Lees-Maffei's analysis of how domestic advisers responded to the disappearance of servants by assuming the need for women to multi-task, not by reapportioning work to other family members. How and where couples met in twentieth-century Britain is the subject of investigation by Lampard, with continuities as striking as changes. The power dynamics of such romantic encounters are examined by Langhamer, who argues that they continued to reflect a male breadwinner model while dominant discourses of romantic love contained men and women within heterosexual monogamous marriage. In a persuasive analysis, Francis sees a postwar 'flight from commitment' by men within an imagined male world epitomized by fantasized adventure narratives in cinema, fiction, and war memoir. Mort looks at striptease, seeking to shift the analysis by providing a closely textured study and long-range history of the changing relationship between sexuality and commerce in London. Turning from profane to sacred matters, Brown argues that, while the secular ization of Britain is often seen as both relentless and relatively painless, it was in fact sudden and culturally shocking. Harris and Spence consider religious revivalism and argue that it was part of a shift towards new configurations of religiosity, not the last gasp of old-fashioned Christianity. Turning to cultural history, Wickberg argues that for the past 25 years the new cultural history has contained within it two broad impulses or interpretive directions: a movement from social history to cultural history that has replaced the primacy of social experience with the primacy of discursive representation; and, he suggests, alongside this shift a 'history of sensibilities' has emerged that owes as much to the 'old' cultural history as to the 'new'. The cultural history of consumerism has been a lively research topic for some years now. Schwarzkopf considers the reception given to the Austro-American market and consumer researcher Ernest Dichter when he arrived in London in the 1960s. British market researchers proved resistant to his ideas about how to use psychoanalysis to research the 'hidden' motivations of consumers, thus demonstrating that cultural barriers to the transfer of marketing practices across cultures can include local professional elites as well as civil society and pressure groups. Hilton (in Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science) notes that consumption became a political project, with gov ernments across the world working to promote a vision of consumer society based around affluence for all rather than choice and luxury for the few. Elsewhere (in Social History), Hilton explores the nature of activism in a consumer society by offering a case study of comparative-testing consumer movement organizations in both the developed and devel oping world. It was a thin year for histories of welfare and of medicine. In the former category, a fascinating piece by Taylor and Rogaly mines a rich seam of archival material on what we now term the 'underclass', dissects contemporary debates about 'problem' families, and explores the postwar experience of deprivation before poverty's 'rediscovery' in the mid 1960s. In the latter, the 1962 Hospital Plan is often seen as the pinnacle of NHS command and control, but Biddle documents a shift from optimism to anger as it became clear that high expectations would not be fulfilled and, in the process, reveals the extent to which implementation was a matter for negotiation at the local level. In writing relevant to particular countries within the British Isles, Johnes explores the processes that led to the creation of the county of South Glamorgan. Widely seen as an artificial creation designed to give the Conservatives a presence in South Welsh local government, for Johnes its real problem was the practical challenge of establishing a new i7.J Economic History Society 2009 Econontlic History Reviewc, 62, 1 (2009)</page><page sequence="47">REVIEW OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE 199 local authority from scratch. Elsewhere, Jamison argues that Westminster, determined to replace the Polaris nuclear deterrent, consistently advertised and exaggerated the pro gramme's employment opportunities in Scotland. Brownlow suggests that links between those awarding government grants in N. Ireland and those receiving them, coupled with the lack of an industrial policy seeking to move resources from declining to new industries, were significant contributors to the province's poor economic performance in the golden age. Finally, Foster considers the forces and events behind dramatic and unforeseen recent change since the 1970s in the Republic of Ireland's politics, economics, cultural influences, religious profession, and gender roles. In urban history, the received view of postwar reconstruction suggests a fairly swift and harmonious development and implementation of plans conceived and driven forward by one or two key individuals. Essex and Brayshay's study of the reconstruction of Plymouth highlights the fact that such plans required many actors and interests with different agendas to implement them. Once initial postwar reconstruction was over, the inner residential districts of London began to be transformed by a phenomenon that did not then have a name but which was later termed 'gentrification', a process investigated by Moran (in J7ournal of Urban History). Elsewhere (in Cultural &amp; Social History), Moran investigates the cultural and political meanings of everyday landscapes in postwar Britain. He identifies a striking continuity at the general level of debate, with a persistent preference for the local and traditional against centralized modernity or globalized anonymity, a belief in clear distinctions between urban and rural, and profound disdain for suburbia and for its spread. Lastly, the history of suburbs has lately received much scholarly attention. Taking stock, McManus and Ethington propose that suburban development should be examined in the context both of the metropolises to which they were attached and of changes in the lives of suburban residents. Finally, we turn to methodological issues. A thoughtful review article by Blaazer con siders the implications of globalization for the practice of history. He concludes that the sacrifice of the nation state as an heuristic would be as grievous a loss as the sacrifice of class has been, though he argues that using recent insights into the historical dynamics of globalization could enhance our understanding of political ideas, money, markets, and, not least, globalization itself. Wasserstrom, while acknowledging big changes in the practice of history over the past 40 years, is struck by an obvious continuity in that the discipline remains rooted in a readiness to show 'creative disrespect' for accepted hierarchies of all sorts. Nonetheless, one major change has been the hollowing out of economic history and some ambivalence about its relationship with economics. Demeulemeester and Diebolt see cliometrics as the means by which history can be injected back into economics. Elsewhere, however, Weintraub warns that historians of economics have essentially lost their battle to be taken seriously by economists, and that the result has been a collapse in the field's institutional vigour. We end, however, by identifying an important lacuna in our present understanding of postwar Britain. In discussing the periodization of 'contemporary history' Caplan claims that the absence of clear national turning points in Britain, or at least ones we are willing to confront, makes for dull history. However, is Caplan right to talk about an absence of such turning points? Plainly Lowe thinks not. He argues persuasively that contemporary British historians cannot avoid the huge 'sea change' in the 1970s, but that they have barely begun to get to grips with this crucial decade. There is a huge research agenda here for contemporary historians of all stripes. References (date of publication is 2007 unless otherwise stated) Austin, G. and Uche, C.
