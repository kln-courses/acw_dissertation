<plain_text><page sequence="1">George Tyrrell in America William L. Portier Since John Henry Newman laid down his pen, we have had no Catholic writer in English superior to Father Tyrrell in originality of thought, fertility of expression, and an all per vading sense of religion.1 Though he resisted it, George Tyrrell was often compared to John Henry Newman. The above lines could have been written by many in England, but instead they came from Tyrrell's admirers in the United States. At the beginning of the twentieth century, English-speaking Catholics lived in a small intellectual world confined to a few pub lishing houses and a handful of journals. So in 1905, when the New York Review's, editors introduced Tyrrell's first contribution, they could presume that their readers were already familiar with his work. Between 1891 and 1906, Tyrrell published more than twenty articles in Catholic periodicals in the United States. Between 1899 and 1907, Maude Petre (1863-1942), Tyrrell's close friend and biographer and a theologian in her own right, published twelve articles in the United States. In addition to reading his journal articles, Catholics in the United States also made up a significant portion of the English-language market for Tyrrell's books. His first book, Nova et Vetera, appeared in 1897. The publisher, Longmans, Green, and Com pany of London, sold 1,417 copies of the book to their New York office between pub lication and 1905. Between 1898 and 1905, Longmans sold 2,092 copies of Hard Say ings, Tyrrell's second book, to the New York office. External Religion (1899) was probably more popular in the United States than Tyrrell's first two books; unfortunately the Longmans' ledgers are incomplete, and there is no record of its sales in the United States.2 Beginning with Nova et Vetera in 1897 and concluding with his excommunica tion in October 1907, the range of Catholic periodicals, from the popular Ave Maria to 1.

Catholic Historian the scholarly Catholic University Bulletin, reviewed Tyrrell's books regularly. After a brief biographical introduction, this article will chronicle Tyrrell's reception in the United States. Tyrrell's Life George Tyrrell was born in Dublin on 6 February 1861. His father died shortly before Tyrrell's birth, leaving his mother with no money and three children. After a vagabond life with his mother, Tyrrell entered the Roman Catholic Church in 1879 and the Jesuit novitiate in London the following year at the age of nineteen. He studied phi losophy at Stonyhurst and then spent three years teaching on the island of Malta. He described his sympathies at this time as "with those only who were in that sort of dark ness and need from which I believed, or hoped, the Catholic religion had delivered me." The "or hoped" foreshadows Tyrrell's future. With nothing less than "the gain ing of the modern mind to Christ" as his goal, he studied theology at St. Beuno's in North Wales and was ordained a priest on 20 September 1891. After his tertianship, he worked for a year as a parish priest among the Catholic poor in St. Helen's, Lancashire. In 1894 he was sent to teach philosophy to Jesuit scholastics at St. Mary's Hall, Stony hurst.3 At this time, Tyrrell was deep into what Maude Petre called his phase of "militant orthodoxy." In 1879, the same year Tyrrell entered the Church, Pope Leo XIII launched the Thomistic revival with his encyclical Aeterni Patris. Tyrrell's devotion to Roman Thomism led to accusations that he was turning young Jesuits into Dominicans. In 1896 he was sent to London to work on the writing staff of the Jesuit periodical the Month. This move roughly coincided with a new phase in Tyrrell's thinking, which Petre called "mediating liberalism." His articles in the Month introduced Tyrrell to a wider Catholic public, and his increasing popularity as a spiritual director and retreat master occasioned the books that established him, in both England and the United States, as a leading spiritual writer and apologist. In 1899 Tyrrell published two articles that signal the dual aspect of the third and final phase of his thought. In "The Relation of Theology to Devotion," we meet a chas tened neoscholastic whose ministry has taught him the truth of the ancient maxim attributed to Prosper of Aquitaine, "Lex orandi, lex credendi" (As you pray, so you be lieve). Tyrrell identifies the lex orandi as "the Christian religion as lived by its con sistent professors_Devotion and religion existed before theology, in the way that art existed before art criticism."4 This sense of religious living's priority over theology 3.

This last phase of thought also had a dark edge. In "A Perverted Devotion," published in the Weekly Register in December 1899, we meet a provocateur growing increasingly disgruntled at authority's attempts to censor him. Tyrrell's critique of popular notions about eternal punishment was sent to Rome. Tension with Jesuit superiors in Rome mounted. Tyrrell gave his last retreat in July 1900. Attending the conference was the thirty-seven-year-old provincial superior of the Filles de Marie, Maude Petre. The close friendship that began at this retreat would continue until Tyrrell's death; he entrusted his literary papers to Petre. As boldly unconventional by Edwardian standards as it was incredibly chaste by our own, their collaboration is one of the great stories of twentieth-century theology.5 In August 1900 Tyrrell moved from London to a rural parish in Richmond, Yorkshire. On 29 Decem ber 1900 the English hierarchy's joint pastoral letter made a Vatican-inspired strike at liberalism. Tyrrell's spirits continued to sour. At this time, he was digesting the results of historical-critical study of the New Testament and Christian origins. He wrote fever ishly at Richmond but chafed under both Jesuit and diocesan censorship. "I could get nothing through two iron walls, not even the Pater Noster if it were in my own hand writing."6 Frustrated, he turned to pseudonymous writing and confessed a certain "charm" in its "furtiveness."7 Tyrrell had already written to the Jesuit general about his possible separation from the society. His pseudonymous writing precipitated his dismissal in February 1906. No bishop in England wanted Tyrrell in his diocese. Pope Pius X condemned modernism in his encyclical Pascendi dominici gregis on 8 September 1907. On 22 October 1907, after his letters opposing Pascendi were published in the Times of London, Tyrrell was forbidden to approach the sacraments. Tyrrell died of kidney disease on 16 July 1909 at Petre's home in the village of Storrington, Sussex. He was only forty-eight. Petre, Henri Bremond, and Baron Fried rich von Hugel were with him. Before he died Bremond gave him absolution, and he said the prayers for the dead and spoke at Tyrrell's grave site in the Anglican cemetery at Storrington. Because the bishop could find no evidence that Tyrrell had retracted his opposition to Pascendi and in spite of the fact that he had received the sacraments before he died, Tyrrell was refused a Catholic burial. To recount baldly the facts of his life is to wonder if Tyrrell were not a petulant but often charming malcontent with an ecclesiastical death wish. In reading a text such as "The Relation of Theology to Devotion" is to enter the presence of a first-rate mind and to be spiritually engaged by a large and recognizably human soul.8 Readers in the 5.

Catholic Historian United States embraced Tyrrell as one who brought the faith to life, but that welcome is now forgotten. Though no one in this country ever used the word modernism before Pascendi introduced it in 1907, Tyrrell is now remembered here only as a modernist.9 It was not always so, however; Tyrrell's American reception included at least two phases. By the end of the first phase, which lasted from 1891 to 1899, he was the most popular spiritual writer writing in English. During the second phase, lasting from 1899 to 1907, his conflicts with Church authority made him increasingly suspect and even tually a liability to the ecclesiastics who had disseminated his work. Tyrrell's American Reception Phase 1:1891-1899 American Catholic Quarterly Review Philadelphia's American Catholic Quarterly Review was the premier Catholic jour nal in the United States; it reported a circulation of 7,500 in 1910.10 James A. Corcoran (1820-1889) founded the journal after Brownson's Quarterly Review ceased publica tion in 1876. Jesuit writers from the Month often contributed to the American Catholic Quarterly Review. Tyrrell was introduced to America in its pages as a thirty-year-old Jesuit seminarian when Richard Clarke, S.J., editor of the Month, submitted an essay Tyrrell had written during his theological studies. Published anonymously in 1891 as "Aquinas Resuscitatus," the article proposed curricular and methodological changes for the renewal of Thomism called for in Aeterni Patris.11 After his assignment to the Month in 1896, Tyrrell published three more essays in the American Catholic Quar terly Review. They reflect his shift from "militant orthodoxy" to "mediating liberal ism."12 The third article, "The Church and Scholasticism," signals the beginning of Tyrrell's critique of scholasticism. The American Catholic Quarterly Review also publicized Tyrrell's books in the United States. It reviewed Nova et Vetera, Informal Meditations for Times of Spiritual Dryness (1897) and a series on the saints Tyrrell was editing in 1898 and 1899.13 When 9.

Turner, who praised Tyrrell as a writer "whose name is a guarantee of excellence.'"14 After the controversy over "A Perverted Devotion," Tyrrell disappeared from the pages of the American Catholic Quarterly Review. Its last mention of him, in a review of The Faith of the Millions, concludes with the familiar invocation of Newman: "no one since Newman has appealed more strongly to cultivated minds."15 American Ecclesiastical Review/Ecclesiastical Review As substantive as the American Catholic Quarterly Review but more pastoral, the American Ecclesiastical Review was a notch below its Philadelphia neighbor on the prestige chain. Its founding editor, Herman Heuser (1851-1933), a student of James Corcoran, taught scripture at St. Charles Seminary. Despite his image as "conserva tive," Heuser opened his review to a range of perspectives. Between 1896 and 1898 he published four articles by Alfred Loisy on synoptic exegesis, but he had a predilection for Tyrrell and continued to publish his work even after Tyrrell's conflicts with Church authority became public. Heuser wrote a glowing review of Nova et Vetera. Drawn by Tyrrell's spiritually in vigorating talent for approaching traditional theological subjects from unanticipated angles, he wrote, "There is a keenness to his steel which arises from the originality of his method, or rather from his individuality, because he does not follow any of the popular forms of systematic meditation."16 Heuser published Tyrrell's first contribution in the next issue of the journal. Tyrrell's first two articles represent "mediating liberal ism."17 His next contribution broke new ground. He sent it to Heuser in the fall of 1899 with the following remarks: I am sending you what was to have been an introductory essay to a commentary on S. Ig natius' "Contemplatio amoris." The latter I see no prospect of finishing yet the former has cost me so much thought and labor that I don't like to shelve it indefinitely. You might cut it up into a series of articles for the A.E.R. or else for ACQ. with which I understand you are in alliance.18 Heuser took the manuscript and turned it into a three-part series entitled "The True and False Mysticism" that ran from October through December 1899.

Catholic Historian spirit as "The Relation of Theology and Devotion," the articles reflect discussion with von Hiigel on the comparative natures of Buddhist and Christian mysticism. True con templation seeks the way to God through creatures rather than world renunciation. Ignatian immersion in creation jostles with post-Kantian interiority. The last article in the series includes a beautiful commentary on the Benedicite from Daniel 3, which is used in Sunday morning prayer.19 Ave Maria Tyrrell also caught the eye of another Catholic editor in the United States, Daniel E. Hudson, C.S.C., of Notre Dame's popular devotional and literary magazine, Ave Maria. As part of the first truly mass medium in the United States, Ave Maria brought Tyrrell to a large readership. By 1900 its circulation had swelled to 22,500.20 From 1897 through 1906, Hudson's reviews and comments enthusiastically recommended Tyrrell to his subscribers. Though relatively brief, Hudson's reviews always included substantive excerpts. During the 1890s he reviewed Nova et Vetera (1897), Hard Say ings (1898), and External Religion (1899).21 External Religion During Lent 1899 Tyrrell gave a series of talks to Catholic undergraduates at Ox ford. Even as he criticized the danger of formalism, he took an incarnational approach to Christianity, in which the visible embodies the invisible. Later the same year, he published these talks as External Religion: Its Use and Abuse. With this book Tyrrell achieved among American Catholics of the 1890s the stature of Thomas Merton in the 1950s and 1960s and Henri Nouwen in the 1980s. No contemporary spiritual writer was more popular. "Blessings on teachers who tell the truth like Father Tyrrell." With this prayer, Hudson concluded his spirited review of External Religion. Heuser outdid Hudson, comparing Tyrrell with biblical Wisdom. "Wisdom says: 'Venite, filii, audite me, timo rem Domini docebo vos.' So, too, in fact says our author."22 External Religion was the first of Tyrrell's books the scholarly Catholic University Bulletin chose to review.23 Tyrrell's approach to the relationship between the visible and invisible in External Re ligion recalled Paulist founder Isaac Hecker's (1819-1888) account of the relationship between the life of the Holy Spirit in the soul and the outer working of the same Spirit in the Church. This parallel struck a young Paulist, Joseph McSorley (1874-1963), who celebrated Tyrrell's External Religion in the first of more than forty articles he 19.

In one brief passage, McSorley connected Hecker and Tyrrell explicitly.24 Within about a year of this article, McSorley, or MacSorly as Tyrrell usually referred to him, was functioning as Tyrrell's "literary agent" in the United States. Joseph McSorley as Tyrrell's Literary Agent In 1899, at the age of twenty-five, Joseph McSorley went to Washington, D.C. to teach dogmatic theology at the Paulist college on the campus of Catholic University. He had joined the Paulists in 1891, the year after Walter Elliott's Life of Father Hecker appeared. Like Polycarp, who had seen John who had seen the Lord, McSorley became the disciple of Elliott, who had been Hecker's disciple. He probably helped Elliott and Abbe Felix Klein with the French edition of Life of Father Hecker. He saw the book precipitate the Americanist crisis in France and read the pope's reference to it in Testem Benevolentiae (1899). McSorley lived for eighty-nine years and was a Paulist father for 24.

Appearing less than a year after Testem Benevolentiae, his article on Ex ternal Religion was an initial step in a lifelong campaign to clear the names of Hecker and Elliott; in this case, he attempted to do so by associating Hecker's teaching with one of the most popular spiritual writers of the day. Tyrrell's letters to Heuser and Hudson, as well as McSorley's letters to Hudson and John Burke, editor of the Catholic World, provide ample evidence for an extensive Tyrrell-McSorley correspondence. McSorley ordered that his correspondence be de stroyed at his death, and although one archival box survives, it does not contain any letters from Tyrrell. How McSorley came to serve as Tyrrell's American agent is un clear. When Tyrrell wrote to Heuser in October 1899, he was handling this aspect of his career himself, but within a year or so McSorley was representing him in the United States. Perhaps McSorley's October 1899 article "How We Abuse Religion" occa sioned the change. In any case, it is clear that McSorley associated the Hecker tradition in apologetics and spirituality with Tyrrell's work.25 Just as French critics of the Life of Father Hecker had connected Hecker with the "method of immanence," so McSorley was struck by the affinity of Tyrrell's method with that of Hecker. "Heckerisme" was in the air of 1899. Discussing the Jesuits' future with Henri Bremond, Tyrrell called St. Ignatius Loyola the "sixteenth-century Hecker."26 Tyrrell's references to Hecker corre spond to Felix Klein's picture of him as a paradigm of the charismatic religious founder and priest of the future. This is part of the setting for the connection between Tyrrell and McSorley. Tyrrell and McSorley's correspondence with Hudson, Heuser, and John Burke clar ifies the kind of work McSorley did for Tyrrell. Responding to a question from Hudson, Tyrrell explains, "As to the titles I must trust to Fr. MacSorly. Since I don't know which articles he has sent you. He very kindly acts for me in America, else the long post delays cause inconveniences."27 McSorley's letters to Hudson confirm that he was acting on Tyrrell's behalf. Hudson's query had been prompted by a letter from McSor ley telling him that Tyrrell had authorized publication of separate articles under his name in Ave Maria. "That's good news, isn't it?," McSorley wrote. "I wish he'd do the same for the CW. [Catholic World] but as he has not proposed it, I fancy we've too bad a name with his [illegible] to make anything of the sort possible." Sounding like a man with a mission, McSorley concluded: "However, the essential thing is that the ideas be set circulating."28 Tyrrell instructed Heuser to deal with McSorley "as my plenipo 25.

After 1899 his ecclesiastical credibility began to erode, and eventually his name was no longer a "guarantee of excellence." During his Richmond exile, from 1900 to 1905, Tyrrell's difficulties with censorship increased. Early on he concluded that a collection of previously approved essays stood the best chance of passing the censors. In 1901 he published the collection in two volumes as The Faith of the Millions. It included four essays that originally appeared in the U.S. journals. Tyrrell's American audience quickly absorbed his latest offering, but it failed to match his earlier books in sales. Between 1901 and 1905, Longmans London sold less than nine hundred copies of each volume to its New York office. News of the contro versy surrounding Tyrrell had drifted across the Atlantic. Hudson found it "regrettable that one should think it necessary to state whether a priest-author belongs to the Liberal or Conservative school of thought." He used a passage from one of the book's essays, "Liberal Catholicism," to answer the question of Tyrrell's liberalism and concluded with this defense of the author: "Father Tyrrell is one of the most competent of those who assume to speak in the name of their Catholic brethren, and the charm of his style is such as to engage and keep the interest of readers of all schools of thought."31 Tyrrell's association with the Paulist journal the Catholic World began in 1901. Hecker founded the Catholic World in 1865 and modeled it on the Atlantic Monthly. In the wake of Americanism, its quality declined significantly. The Catholic World, Mc Sorley had to admit, "is not the organ of Fr. Hecker's opinions, as it stands now, except in a very limited way."32 It improved dramatically after John Burke took over as editor in 1904, however, and prior to that, McSorley had done his best to raise its quality. One reason for McSorley's willingness to serve as Tyrrell's agent was probably his desire to 29. Tyrrell to Heuser, Richmond, York, 10 September 1905, PAHRC, Heuser Papers, Box 8, Folder 99. 30.

Catholic Historian have Tyrrell write for the Catholic World. Tyrrell wrote his first article for the Catholic World in January 1901 under the signature "E. F. G." Barely concealed beneath the ini tials, Tyrrell argued against those who would treat as dogma the opinions of a particular school for a "certain Christian agnosticism."33 Shortly thereafter, Tyrrell reported to von Hugel that he was in correspondence with a young priest in the United States who kept him "aw couranf with affairs there.34 In April 1901 McSorley wrote an article-length commentary on a chapter from Bre mond's UInquietude Religieuse, in which he linked Newman and Hecker. On the last page of the article, he compared Tyrrell and Bremond to Newman and Pascal.35 Tyrrell bristled at the comparison with Newman. Such hyperbole could only add to his ec clesiastical woes. "The American eulogy," he wrote to Bremond, "is simply disastrous. To be mentioned in the same breath with Newman is to be dwarfed by contrast; it is like putting a fly in the focus of a burning glass. But no one minds the Catholic World."36 Despite his pique, Tyrrell did not break contact with the Paulist journal. Maude Petre had written an article that used Tyrrell's essay "Poet and Mystic" as a basis for her treatment of the reconciliation of holiness and human affection. Tyrrell told Petre he liked the essay enormously and advised her to send it to the Catholic World. This began a long association in which the Catholic World published nine ar ticles by Petre between 1902 and 1907.37 Oil and Wine In spring 1900 Tyrrell finished a collection of essays entitled Oil and Wine. After two years of attempting to get the book through both Jesuit and diocesan censors, Tyrrell was convinced that publishing under his own name was now virtually impos sible. In December 1902 Heuser published an article he later learned was part of an already existing book, namely Oil and Wine?% So tight was Tyrrell's double censorship that this article was the last he published in the United States until September 1905, just months before his dismissal from the Jesuits. McSorley's main service to Tyrrell during this period consisted in his attempts to have Oil and Wine published as a whole or in parts. 33. E. F.

George Tyrrell, "God in Us," Ecclesiastical Review 1 (December 1902): 592-608. This became chapter 41 of Oil and Wine.</page><page sequence="11">George Tyrrell in America 79 Maude Petre wrote of Oil and Wine that it "strikes so deep as to cause a kind of pain." She identified its theme as "the human soul, upheld by God in the midst of im mensity, and struggling forth from loneliness and separation to union with all things and with him." Gabriel Daly described Oil and Wine as the most deeply immanent of Tyrrell's works: "In many respects, it is his most finely conceived and elegantly written work, spiritual in intent and non-polemical in execution."39 Tyrrell desperately wanted it published, but the two-year controversy left him embittered and in possession of up to two hundred copies of the book that he had printed for private distribution. Tyrrell's correspondence with Heuser and Hudson in late 1902 indicates his plan for circumventing the censors. He would publish the contraband in America chapter by chapter. After the essays had appeared separately, the book would be easier to publish in America. McSorley was to carry out this plan and must have sent chapters to Heuser in fall 1902. With the appearance of "God in Us" in December 1902, the plan seemed to be working. But Tyrrell's 28 December letter to Hudson indicates that Heuser balked at publishing any more of what he now took to be an already existing book. Tyrrell began his letter to Hudson with a misleading account of the book's fate. All these articles [that McSorley had sent to Hudson] were to have been published a year ago in a volume which received the approbation of our own S.J. censors; but at the last minute when the book was in print the Cardinal claimed a right of re-censorship as a con dition of his Imprimatur?quite a new departure, which wd. have created an awkward precedent?and so I withdrew it. Our provincial thought it wd. be unwise to apply to an other English bishop, or to publish the book anywhere immediately. But by the time it has come out in fragments it will be quite safe to publish it in America where these fragments will have appeared. Heuser had objected that the essays were already part of a book, but Tyrrell assured Hudson that it was a privately printed book and that only eight copies had been sent to the United States. I printed a few copies to circulate among my personal friends but only 8 have got or will get into America. I mention this, as Fr. Heuser of the A.E.R. seems for some (to me) incomprehensible reason to find in it an objection to publishing it in his periodical. When the book is published, I will of course say that such and such sections were first published in the Ave Maria, etc. I am very glad indeed to think that by means of the Ave Maria I shall be able to reach many whom else I had never reached. I don't know whether we could come to an arrangement by which you [C?] have the right of re-publishing both the Ave Maria articles and the others which make up the volume. As the plates are in exis tence it wd. seem a pity not to utilise them. However that is all in the vague at present. The great thing is to get as much of the book published as possible.40 39.

Catholic Historian Desperate to publish Oil and Wine, Tyrrell deceived his American supporters. Nei ther Hudson, Heuser , nor McSorley knew that a frustrated Tyrrell had won approval from Jesuit censors by threatening to publish the book anonymously. Nor did Tyrrell tell them that Cardinal Herbert Vaughan had not simply demanded a right of re censorship; he had also read the book himself and sent it on to Rome where it had been rejected by Roman censors.41 Tyrrell wrote directly to Heuser in January with an ab breviated version of what he had told Hudson. He claimed that the book had been printed with the approval of Jesuit censors and that he had withdrawn it when Cardinal Vaughan claimed a right of re-censorship. Nor was it judged advisable to apply to some other English bishop but rather to wait a bit and then publish in America. I took 100 copies to give to my personal friends. Of these I sh. be surprised if even three or four would even see the A.E.R. If they did, they would know the circumstances and never imagine you were reprinting published matter. I thought if a few of the articles first appeared in American periodicals their subsequent ap pearance there in book-form would seem more natural. Tyrrell then to explained to Heuser why he had received this material from McSorley instead of from Tyrrell himself. It was only because my good friend Fr. MacS. was on the spot &amp; was much interested that the book sh. see the light that I asked him to negotiate w/ you and with others to get as much of it into print in article form as might be possible. The post-intervals between this and America are such as to make business by letter tedious and unsatisfactory. Moreover I am a busy man and glad when anyone takes correspondence out of my hands. I may also add that as I am some ?48 out of pocket by the non-publication of the book I am anxious to get wherewithal to meet my printer's bill. I write all this only to defend myself against what seems a strongly crooked interpretation of very simple matters. Until now I have always found the A.E.R. very satisfactory to deal with &amp; never dreamt the interpretation your agent has construed as an offence.42 Tyrrell's plan had an additional wrinkle. McSorley was the likely recipient of the copies of Oil and Wine Tyrrell told Hudson (eight copies) and Heuser (four copies) that he had sent to the United States. Earlier in 1902, before he had followed up on Mc Sorley's letters to Heuser and Hudson, Tyrrell reported some good news to von Hiigel: "Bishop Spalding told my Paulist friend Joseph MacSorly he would write the preface to Oil and Wine if I chose to publish it in America of which I am technically free to do 41. On the Oil and Wine episode, see Schultenover, George Tyrrell, 167-82. 42. Tyrrell to Heuser, Richmond, 28 January 1903, PAHRC, Heuser Papers, Box 8, Folder 99.</page><page sequence="13">George Tyrrell in America 81 any day."43 This letter suggests that, simultaneous with his efforts to place individual chapters, McSorley had also been looking for an American bishop to give the Impri matur to Oil and Wine. One of the few intellectuals among American bishops, Spalding was a good friend of the Paulists. While Rome was considering Spalding's nomination for the archdiocese of Chicago, however, one of his former "wards," Elizabeth Cald well, denounced him in a letter to the Vatican for impropriety in his relationship with her sister Gwendolin. She threatened to expose Spalding if he were made archbishop of Chicago. The Propagande took these allegations with sufficient seriousness that Spalding remained bishop of Peoria.44 As a result of the "Chicago affair," by the fall of 1902 Spalding was in no position to grant his Imprimatur to Tyrrell's book. Thus, Tyrrell fell back on the plan to publish Oil and Wine in fragments. After Hudson had apparently agreed to the plan, however, he received a hurried letter from Tyrrell telling him not to print any of the chapters McSorley had sent. Bishop Farley of New York may give an Imprimatur to my poor book; I have sent it to him today. As Longmans of N.Y. are anxious to publish it. Will you hold off for the pre sent the publication of any further extracts from it, till we see. Should I be able to publish the book at once I will make restitution to the Ave Maria and run a fresh series through its pages so far as you have room for it.45 Tyrrell's correspondence with von Hiigel establishes that a copy of Oil and Wine had come into the hands of James F. Driscoll (1859-1922), most likely from McSorley. During the previous academic year (1901-1902), McSorley and Driscoll both taught on the campus of Catholic University. (They would later collaborate on the New York Review.) At the time of Tyrrell sending him Oil and Wine, Driscoll was rector of Far ley's St. Joseph's Seminary at Dunwoodie, Yonkers, New York. On 10 October 1903 Tyrrell told von Hiigel that Driscoll had written to ask him for fifty copies of Oil and Wine to distribute to his seminarians.46 Since Tyrrell wrote to Hudson in February, the book probably came into Driscoll's hands considerably before Tyrrell told von Hiigel of Driscoll's request. Trained in Paris at the Institut Catholique and in Rome under Henri Hyvernat, Driscoll, like his colleague Francis Gigot, was proficient in all the languages necessary to do and evaluate serious work in biblical studies. He was also a member of the exclu sive New York Oriental Club. Driscoll destroyed most of his correspondence, but by using the Tyrrell-von Hiigel correspondence as well as two surviving letters from 43. Tyrrell to von Hugel, 10 July 1902, as cited by Michael J.

Commenting on a photograph of Driscoll, he wrote: How strangely fresh and boyish our Yankee brethren are. I wish they had more discipline and less wisdom. There is something shoddy in . . . their finest textures. Driscoll is per haps the best of the lot. How he stands as a Forscher I am not competent to say. However he is full of youth and enthusiasm and seems to infect [?] his younger alumni with his spirit. How the bishop of New York trusts his seminarians. ... I do not know.

When Tyrrell reported this to von Hugel, he also mentioned that fifty copies of the book had been dispatched to Driscoll as requested.49 McSorley's efforts to secure an Ameri can Imprimatur for Oil and Wine had failed. Despite Tyrrell's plan, only one chapter, "God in the Soul," ever appeared in print in the United States. Lex Orandi In the summer of 1903, with the attempts to publish Oil and Wine in the United States still under way, Tyrrell managed to get a book past his dual English censors. Combining sections from two pseudonymous works of the Richmond period, Lex Orandi recalled the priorities Tyrrell had stated in "The Relation of Theology to Devo tion."50 Longmans shipped 936 copies of Lex Orandi to New York in 1903-4. Readers in the United States had not seen a book from Tyrrell since 1901 and only two articles since 1899. Lex Orandfs theologically sophisticated reception by American readers is inconsistent with conventional wisdom about the primitive state of theology in the United States at this time. Denouncing the book as unorthodox, a "certain editor in the west"?probably Gerald B. Phelan of the Western Watchman?began discussion about the book in early 1904. By April four other journals had reviewed Lex Orandi. Implicitly acknowledging the book's controversial nature, Hudson pronounced its essays "among the most thought-provoking deliverances of the last decade" and com pared them to Bishop Spalding's as "a delight to the cultivated taste." Though he did not hide his own enthusiasm, Hudson discouraged readers who were not "intellectual" or of "cultivated taste." "[A] book by Father Tyrrell is not precisely the pastime of a drowsy summer's day."51 Heuser located the book's power "in its revelation of the reli gious implications of man's nature as actually constituted by God, i.e., in and for the supernatural." Though he advised against reading the book in a "spirit of metaphysical criticism," Heuser spent most of his review on questions that arose once "the spell of exaltation the work is almost sure to evoke has subsided." He concluded, however, that after all the objections had been "hunted out" they would not dislodge the "affective apologetic" from "the place of honor it claims when bearing the regal mien and dress in which Father Tyrrell has presented it."52 Heuser's rejection of the contraband chapters from Oil and Wine had not dimmed his enthusiasm for Tyrrell. In addition to his own review, he also published two lengthy articles on Lex Orandi by his colleague Francis P. Siegfried (c. 1851-1927). Siegfried taught philosophy at St. Charles Seminary. A Thomist who had read and absorbed Maurice Blondel's 1896 "Letter on Apologetics," he was Tyrrell's most learned and eloquent interpreter in the United States. As heavily involved in formation work as 49. Tyrrell to von Hiigel, 20 February 1904, as cited in DeVito, New York Review, 206. 50. On Lex Orandi, see Schultenover, George Tyrrell, 240-45. 51.

Catholic Historian Tyrrell, Siegfried appreciated his power to make the spiritual life real for his readers. Defending the book's theological intrinsicalness, to which Heuser had drawn attention, Siegfried's first article argued that Tyrrell's affective apologetic not only worked with but was compatible with the supernatural character of revealed Christianity. He sym pathetically explained Tyrrell's claim that the "spiritual life of man, as it has been de facto uniformly from the beginning, and as alone it is known to us experimentally, is exigent of Grace and Glory; is exigent not merely of religion, but of 'supernatural' re ligion, of Christianity." One cannot read Siegfried's articles on Tyrrell without con cluding that he understood the issues raised by Tyrrell's theology as well as anyone could.53 The Jesuit Messenger did not share Siegfried's enthusiasm for their confrere. The anonymous reviewer defended the book's orthodoxy against the Western Watchman but found it lacking "simplicity, the real charm of spiritual writing, and for this reason even the many novel and suggestive passages it contains fail to impress the reader." The reviewer found it "jarring" to read of "revelation as the 'epoch-making super normal experiences of God-inspired prophetic souls.'"54 Siegfried took the Messen ger's opening reference to "a seminary professor in the east who had grown enthusias tic over this book" as a license to respond in detail, and Heuser gave him the space to do so. "Of those writing in the new apologetic vein," Siegfried claimed, "no one has done better work than the author of Lex Orandi." He went on to contextualize and ex plain every phrase from the book that the Messenger had criticized. The Catholic University Bulletin pronounced Lex Orandi "perhaps the most stimulating of Father Tyrrell's contributions to the literature of theology."55 It was Siegfried, however, in his response to the Messenger's comment about simplicity, who best captured Tyrrell's at traction for his American audience: "He has seen through the mechanism of philosophy and theology, transcended their technicalities, interpreted these in terms of life, and reset them in the warm, living tissues of individual consciousness."56 The Soul's Orbit and San Francisco Tyrrell's early books were based on his retreat work. In Hard Sayings, for example, Heuser heard "the melody of the 'Exercises' of St. Ignatius, like an echo from Manresa, helping us to understand what reason alone would misinterpret, since wisdom comes through the heart as much as through the mind."57 The lex orandi most basic to Tyr rell's thought was the Spiritual Exercises as he had learned to pray them. In his strug gle to liberate Jesuit spirituality from Jesuit theology, he enlisted post-Kantian thought and contemporary biblical scholarship. At times the former threatened to dissolve his 53.

In darker moments the latter appeared as some "critical Longi nus" ready "to thrust his spear into the heart of the Gospel."58 The Exercises lie beneath Tyrrell's later conception of revelation as a profound experience of prophetic vision within the original recipients. Its appeal to the imagination, emotions, and will, as well as to the mind, recalls the desired effect of Ignatian meditation on the mysteries of Christ's life. That in the closing months of the nineteenth century Tyrrell was at work on a manuscript on the Spiritual Exercises comes as no surprise. His relations with the Jesuits grew increasingly conflicted, however, and just before Christmas 1899, Tyrrell burned the manuscript. Published under the name of M. D. Petre in 1904, The Soul's Orbit is Tyrrell and Petre's attempt to salvage something of this project. The book occasioned contact between Tyrrell and two bishops who offered him incardination as he moved toward separation from the Jesuits. One was Mercier of Bel gium, and the other was Archbishop Patrick Riordan (1841-1914), classmate of John Spalding at Louvain and Americanist ally of John Ireland and John Keane. Riordan first read The Soul's Orbit in 1904 and must have contacted Tyrrell shortly thereafter. Some time in 1905 Riordan offered Tyrrell sanctuary in the Archdiocese of San Fran cisco. Tyrrell replied to Riordan that the Jesuit general had made it fairly clear that I am to be secularized under somewhat onerous &amp; vexatious conditions &amp; that as soon as my disgrace can no longer compromise the Society I am to be the object of some sort of ecclesiastical censure. Unless I can get some very solid assurance against this menace I will certainly not risk bringing myself into possibly embarrassing relations with one so kind as Your Grace had proved. In that case, they must dismiss me on their initiative; &amp; either provide me with a bishop or leave me in a state of suspension. I will not mention Your Grace's offer to them. Should I obtain a guarantee of peaceful inten tions I may turn to you again; but assurances from diplomats are not easy to trust.59 Tyrrell's claim that he did not want to embarrass the archbishop was probably true, and he also could not imagine leaving England for the United States and the geographi cal isolation of San Francisco. The day before he responded to Riordan's offer, Tyrrell told Bremond that living in California would be impossible: "By the way, the Arch bishop of San Francisco accepted me; but I think he expected I would go over there and work for him?an impossible plan."60 In the fall of 1906, after his dismissal from the Jesuits, Tyrrell received another offer from the United States. This one came from Maria Longworth Storer, wife of an 58. The Longinus metaphor is from Tyrrell to Bremond, 31 December 1901, as cited in Schultenover, George Tyrrell, 183. 59.

Catholic Historian American diplomat and a close friend of John Ireland. After offering financial help if he should need it, Storer invited Tyrrell to come to the United States and offered to pay for the trip. Again, Tyrrell demurred. And now it is true I should thank you for your most generous and liberal offer of financial help, which I rather defer than decline to accept. I had already thought of an American trip to see my many warm friends over there; but on reflection I felt that this was not the time or occasion. It might look like a beating-up of adherents and sympathisers or an at tempt to make a little faction against authorities. Also, I know how my American friends would forget all prudence and go out of their way to identify themselves with me, and how much harm they might thereby do themselves to no purpose. My great difficulty has been to prevent some of my clerical friends from committing ecclesiastical suicide for my sake and so drowning two instead of one. If the storm should subside and I should ever become comparatively respectable enough to attempt such a tour without harm to others I will not hesitate to ask you to help me should I be in straits at the time. At present I am going to spend the winter as a paying guest with some friends in England and shall probably go about very little, if at all, so that I have no reason to anticipate pecuniary pressure.61 Despite his significant literary presence in the United States, Tyrrell would never set foot on its shores. He was a creature of Europe. Tyrrell's Last Months as a Jesuit "Semper Eadem" Tyrrell's last article for the Month, appeared in January 1904. The editors rejected the second installment of what was to be a two-part article. Both Jesuit and diocesan superiors treated him as a loose cannon. His five-year sojourn in "the wilds of Yorkshire" suited both sides.62 By 1905 any article signed by Tyrrell had little chance of publication in an English Catholic journal. Across the Atlantic, his stature as an ecclesiastical irritant had yet to match its English proportions. Tyrrell had been moving for years toward separation from the Jesuits. An article in the Milanese Corriere della Sera on 1 January 1906 precipitated his dismissal in the following month. The article cited an anonymous "Letter to a Professor of Anthro pology" written and privately circulated by Tyrrell at the end of 1903. In the ensuing 61.

Later in 1906 Tyrrell defended his conduct with A Much-Abused Letter. Between 1906 and 1907 Longmans sold 833 copies of it in the United States. Even Tyrrell admitted that the episode had a "scandalous" effect on those who had come to know and trust him through his writing alone.63 After reading A Much-Abused Letter, Walter Elliott warned John Burke against a review in the Catho lic World. "I am decidedly of the opinion that it is a book calculated to do much harm, wrong toned as to Catholic faith, and even bordering on defiance of church authority."64 As Tyrrell's relationship with the Jesuits careened toward its dissolution in the last months of 1905, editors James Driscoll, Herman Heuser, and John Burke published a total of seven Tyrrell articles. News of his dismissal and the circumstances surrounding it, however, all but ended his already tenuous welcome in American Catholic journals. His last American article appeared in the first issue of the Harvard Theological Review.65 The New York Review Driscoll and Francis P. Duffy launched the New York Review with the June-July 1905 issue. His nose to the wind, Driscoll chose Wilfrid Ward to write the lead article. Tyrrell's first article, a long book review, appeared in the August-September issue, and Driscoll published Tyrrell's second contribution in the third issue.66 Both articles later appeared in Through Scylla and Charybdis (1907). Tyrrell wrote to Driscoll in January 1906 informing him of his impending separation from the Jesuits and registering his satisfaction with the New York Review: "I had hoped ere this to send you another con tribution; but you will understand now why I hesitate lest my name should bring discredit on your review rather than credit." He thanked Driscoll for his continuing support: "Need I say what a solid comfort such a friendship as yours is to me in these difficult times. There are not many one can count on for foul weather friends."67 After Tyrrell's dismissal from the Jesuits, Archbishop Farley banned him from writing for the Review. Tyrrell wrote to von Hiigel, "The Archbishop has forbidden them to admit anything from me; and so they published Bremond's eulogy of me in stead."68 Tyrrell asked Driscoll to publicize his situation as a priest without a bishop. 63.

With his ecclesiastical career almost finished, he had only four years to live. Despite Tyrrell's interest and support, the Review itself contributed little to establishing his reputation in the United States. Nor was Driscoll the only American editor to support Tyrrell after his dismissal from the Je suits. Daniel Hudson wrote a strongly worded plea for Tyrrell's "considerate treatment at the hands of Catholic writers."70 From Freiburg im Breisgau, where he had gone with Bremond to work on Lex Credendi, Tyrrell wrote to thank Hudson for his "kind word in the Ave Maria (quoted in the Tablet)?kind and discreet."

During the summer of 1905 Tyrrell corresponded with Heuser about a series of articles entitled "The Spirit of Christ." Tyrrell was too controversial for the Ecclesiastical Review, but Heuser had recently started the Dol phin, a short-lived spin-off journal for the laity. There he published a three-part article by Tyrrell, which was part of a longer series that Tyrrell described as "a study of the Spirit of Christ as embodied in the Pater Noster. That prayer, I take it, is the Lex Orandi on which the Lex Credendi is founded." Unsure that Heuser could publish all the arti cles, Tyrrell suggested he take "each on its own merits."72 McSorley served as Tyrrell's agent for this series. In a letter dated 10 September 1905 Tyrrell explained McSorley's role to Heuser, as well as his own precarious posi tion. As it might possibly influence your willingness to go on with the series, I think I should tell you sub sigello that I have long felt my position as a progressive Catholic to be very embarrassing &amp; unfair to so avowedly conservative &amp; almost anti-progressive an order as the S.J. &amp; have been for 18 months trying to negotiate an amicable &amp; pacific divorce. Should that be effected (&amp; it will be with a good deal of sincere regret on both sides) it might well deter some of your more decidedly pro-Jesuit readers; &amp; for that reason I did not like to tie you to the series but asked Mac S. to dole out each bit as wanted. The CW. reader, as a class, would be less sensitive to the objection that might be created for the E.R. readers by such a divorce were it to occur. My arrangement was dictated by no want of confidence in you but simply by an anticipation for the possible difficulties of your po sition. I will ask MacS. to send you the sections in hand; &amp; if, under the circumstances, you do not want them, you can return them to him. They finish Part I (i.e., the Introduc tion to the exposition of the Pater Noster which is the substance of the work); &amp; will probably occupy 2 or 3 numbers of the Dolphin. Tyrrell asked Heuser not to "allude to my situation in writing to Fr.

Tyrrell called the Our Father "at once the deepest and most succinct ex pression of the Spirit and Life of Christ" and "the norm of all pure prayer and of all pure belief," simultaneosly the lex orandi and the lex credendi.

Catholic Historian the 'explicitation' of what is latent in the Pater Noster."14 Tyrrell's presumption of the "necessary flaw of anthropomorphism, and even materialism, which must always vitiate our efforts to represent things spiritual," drew an eight-page response from a reader in Antigonish, Nova Scotia. Its author, Alexander MacDonald, was the editor of the Antigonish Casket. MacDonald took exception to Tyrrell's "unsound psychology" as "tending to discredit spiritual things." Since the Dolphin had ceased publication at the end of 1905, Heuser printed MacDonald's scholastic critique of Tyrrell in the Ec clesiastical Review, and he gave Tyrrell an opportunity to defend himself. Written shortly before he left Richmond, Tyrrell's response was his final contribution to the Ecclesiastical Review.15 The Dolphin's demise left only the Catholic World open to Tyrrell in his last days as a Jesuit. In September 1905 John Burke printed the second half of "Semper Eadem," which had been rejected earlier by the Month. Ever dissatisfied with the Catholic World, Tyrrell complained that they had changed a word in the article's title.76 His second signed article for the Catholic World appeared in November 1905.77 Tyrrell continued working on the series on the Pater Noster that he had described to Heuser the previous summer and sent the articles to McSorley. McSorley sent the first article to Burke in November 1905. In accord with Fr. Tyrrell's instructions I am sending you a MS., which will be followed by others; in fact the next installment is in my hand but not yet read and corrected. I can't say how many are coming. Incidentally it's a series?&amp; fine stuff if I can judge, better for the C.W.'s purpose than the last, or possibly the last 2 from GT's pen.78 Burke ran the first article in January while Tyrrell was corresponding with Luis Martin about the letter in the Corriere della Sera.19 On 25 February McSorley sent Burke "two further chapters of the 'Prayer of Christ.'" On the same day, McSorley re ceived a card from Tyrrell asking him to return the "remainder of the MSS?which I presume means all not yet published." Tyrrell wanted to "put the whole series in Long mans' hands at once." By this time, unknown to McSorley and Burke, Tyrrell had been dismissed from the Jesuits and was at work on Lex Credendi, of which the Dolphin and Catholic World series would comprise about half. McSorley, however, wanted to make sure that the Catholic World published as many of the articles as possible before they appeared in a book. He proposed a plan to Burke. 74.

He explained it to Burke as due to "his failing to repudiate sufficiently certain utter ances attributed to him in the Carriere della Sera." Tyrrell was anxious about the fate of his manuscripts, and McSorley said he would "start them at once." Burke must have agreed to McSorley's earlier proposal. Regarding Tyrrell's articles, he told Burke, I fancy that he wanted to give you a chance to decline to continue the series &amp; that if you wish to print them, he will consent and send you rest in time to anticipate Longmans. But as his letter puts a new face on the matter I shall not transmit yr. request unless you tell me to again.81 Burke printed the March installment of Tyrrell's series. On 16 March McSorley sent him a copy of the "original letter which was cited in the Italian paper and thus caused the row over Tyrrell" on the condition that Burke keep it confidential (this was Tyrrell's anonymous "Letter to a Professor of Anthropology" soon to become A Much-Abused Letter). "My advice?almost my precept?to you is this. Read it carefully: wait a week and think, and then read it again."82 On 26 March McSorley wrote to Burke and rec ommended that he "close the series with the March installment." He enclosed a card from Tyrrell and advised, "What he says is true?prudence will suggest his disappear ance for the present. They are after him in some of the French (S.J.) papers now." Three days later McSorley wrote to Burke: "Pity you did not remove the letters from Father Tyrrell's name or at least attach a note to say that the Ms. was signed as when you re ceived it. But it doesn't matter much."83 Burke ran the April installment of "The Prayer of Christ" under the name George Tyrrell, SJ. Lex Credendi Lex Credendi arrived in the United States in spring of 1906. Unfortunately, Long mans' ledgers give no record of its American sales. Henri Bremond wrote "Father Tyrrell as an Apologist" to promote Lex Credendi, and McSorley arranged for it to ap pear in the April-June 1906 issue of the New York Review. By this time Tyrrell's 80.

Catholic Historian opinion of the Catholic World had changed. He told Bremond, "MacSorly [sic] has got your art[icle] on me into the New York Review. I wish the Catholic World had the courage to take it."84 James Driscoll and Francis Duffy, editors of the Review, intro duced the article by assuring their readers that Bremond "finds in the latest work of our most distinguished English apologist, certain evidences that he is firm in the faith once delivered to the saints." Bremond located Lex Credendi on a line of development that began with Newman and reached a critical moment with Maurice Blondel. Tyr rell's book marked "a stage in the progress of this idea." According to Bremond, Tyrrell "minds his steps carefully and never loses sight of the rule of faith."85 After Bremond's article in the New York Review appeared, four meaty reviews of Lex Credendi appeared in the United States within months of its publication. The Messenger found Tyrrell's language "confusing" and "obscure," giving away too much to the "Pragmatists." The reviewer objected to Tyrrell's union of faith and love and of fered a list of misleading expressions.86 The Catholic World's book review editor, James J. Fox, countered by concluding his review with a long citation from the May issue of the Month. The generous English Jesuit found Lex Credendi "an altogether worthy continuation of previous work published with full theological censorship and ecclesiastical sanction."87 McSorley's last service to Tyrrell was a long defense of Lex Credendi in the New York Review. Convinced that spiritual development took priority over apologetic argu ment in meeting intellectual difficulties, he identified the book's key question as "Have I the spirit of Christ?" If so, McSorley wrote, the soul is "safe, no matter what con fusion may occur in things of the intellect: for to have put on the spirit of Christ is to be in a condition essentially incompatible with anything like real unfaith or formal sin." He praised Tyrrell's study of the Our Father as "a very precious addition to the litera ture of spiritual teaching" and acknowledged his "mastery, we might say supremacy" among contemporary spiritual writers. Who else writes on the problems of the spiritual life with so wide a view, so sure an analysis, so secure an exposition, so attractive a style! Such qualities indeed have become practically identified with his name; and the multitude who thank him for their first in troduction to sane, vigorous, wholesome, honest, noble, practical ideals of religion are neither injured nor disturbed if they meet passages in which only an expert could discover the opportunity for damaging misinterpretation. McSorley urged readers not to allow recent controversy to prejudice them. Hasty sus picion or censure risked "quenching the flame of love within our own souls and turning the steps of others away from the Kingdom of God."88 84.

With McSorley, he recognized Tyrrell's audience as "that growing class of earnestly religious persons who, wearied with the quarrellings of minds, are more eager for the living waters of life rather than for the vessels of doctrine." McSorley bracketed questions about the comparative merits of the old apologetic and the method of immanence. Siegfried argued for the compatibility and complementarity of St. Thomas's primarily ontological method and Tyrrell's "primarily psychological" one. In terms of order, "Lex Credendi is the Summa read backwards." St. Thomas moves from God to self and then to Christ. Tyrrell moves from Christ to self and then to God. As an experiment, Siegfried suggested applying Tyrrell's method to a prayer of St. Thomas. Even as Father Tyrrell invites you to study the spirit of Christ and the truths of faith as re vealed in the "Our Father," so you might study the spirit and fundamental teaching of St. Thomas in that characteristic prayer by which he was wont to gain light for his vision of life whilst building the Summa: "Concede mihi, misericors Deus, quae tibi placita sunt ardenter concupiscere, prudenter investigare, veraciter agnoscere et perfecte adimplere ad laudem et gloriam nominis tui." What is this but the petition to enter through love (ar denter concupiscere) into vision and faith (veraciter agnoscere), that love and vision may energize in conduct (perfecte adimplere)?the order of the Summa transposed, and the order of Lex Credendi exactly repeated? St. Thomas, according to Siegfried, interpreted the faith primarily, though not ex clusively, intellectually. Tyrrell "reinterprets the truths of faith from the standpoint of will, as the intellectual response, clothed in sense-derived imagery, to the soul's deep est movement and craving?that of love, adhesion, possession." Responding to MacDonald's critique of the Dolphin articles, Siegfried concluded with an account of Tyrrell's writings on the "hopeless materialism" of language. The student who has thoroughly mastered the Thirteenth Question of the Summa will be best prepared to appreciate the philosophy of Lex Orandi and Lex Credendi. But let me say, in conclusion, that if ever language has laid aside its sensuous opaqueness, it is that of the works just mentioned.89 Readers are left to wonder if Siegfried really intended to include the Summa in his reference to the works "just mentioned" and so to join St. Thomas Aquinas and George Tyrrell together in a class by themselves. The final American review of Lex Credendi appeared in the Catholic University Bulletin at about the time Tyrrell was deprived of the sacraments. The author, Michael J. Ryan (1863-1935), taught philosophy at St. Bernard's Seminary in Rochester, New York. Much had changed in the year since the book first appeared, and Ryan was sym 89. Francis P.

He concluded his review with a prayer. Nearly a century later, it stands as a token of the Catholic clergy's farewell to one whose writing had stirred many among them for the better part of two decades. Tyrrell ended the preface to Lex Credendi with a familiar prayer from the Imitation of Christ, hoping that the "great calm" it evoked would follow "the sharp winter of healthy criticism" in biblical studies and theology: "After the winter cometh summer, after the night the day returneth, after the storm cometh a great calm." Maude Petre's memorial card bore the same prayer when she died in 1942. Ryan lamented a misprint in the prayer's Latin form. "We call attention to it here because it is a pity that such a heart-touching sentence should have been spoiled, and because it expresses our feelings toward the distinguished apologist." Ryan cited the prayer in its correct Latin form and concluded, "May these things be his! will be the prayer of those who criticise his works from their quiet shores, as much as of any of the troubled souls whom he has saved from greater trouble or helped to attain peace."90 Tyrrell's Death As the inscription on Tyrrell's tombstone reads, he died on 15 July 1909 "Fortified by the rites of the Church." Nevertheless, he was refused a Catholic burial. His burial in the Anglican cemetery at Storrington caused much discussion among Catholics in England and North America. Most of the American journals in which Tyrrell had pub lished had made public submissions to Pascendi. Tyrrell's public opposition to the encyclical had placed him beyond the pale, and Catholics debated whether he had died there. At the beginning of 1909, America succeeded the Messenger as the Jesuit pub lication in the United States During the summer and fall of 1909, America reported regularly on the discussion surrounding Tyrrell's death and burial. Discussion of Vaffaire Tyrrell continued sporadically in America until the appearance of Petre's Au tobiography and Life of George Tyrrell in 1912. On 24 July 1909 America carried an announcement of Tyrrell's death and an obitu ary. The obituary catalogued his intellectual and moral failings. Both pieces blamed Tyrrell's friends for Bishop Peter Amigo's decision to refuse him a Catholic burial. "Could the dying priest have spoken for himself, would he have retracted his errors? Perhaps; but unfortunately those about him were interested in having it appear that even in death he favored their heresy, and they are responsible for his non-Catholic burial."91 What McSorley, Siegfried, Hudson, Driscoll, Duffy, Riordan, and the rest of Tyr rell's circle thought of this we do not know. Herman Heuser, however, did not keep silent. His article, "Father Tyrrell's Dying Convictions," intoned the ritual invocation 90. Michael J.

Heuser also defended Bishop Amigo's decision and blamed Petre and von Hugel for the fact that Tyrrell had made no retraction. They, he argued, "were not the ones naturally at this crisis to interpret him justly." He ended his reflections with a prayer from Newman that expressed sentiments he thought his friends should have tried to arouse in Tyrrell as he died. Heuser did not completely abandon his old correspondent, however. His comments convey how, in the days before the introduction of the term modernism, Tyrrell had touched American readers as a spiritual writer and apologist. Heuser urged that "rude judgments" about Tyrrell's fate be tempered by the memory of his long service to the Church, "the twenty-five years during which the bright and unpretending priest helped many a soul unto salvation by his preaching, prayer, and writing of such teaching as is contained in Hard Sayings, Faith of the Millions, and Nova et Vetera." Heuser could not believe that God would have refused Tyrrell's plea for mercy: If, as would be but natural, there went forth from him a cry for mercy at the approach of the day of final reckoning, may we doubt that God answered it, and that the application of the Precious Blood in the Sacraments of Penance and Extreme Unction which he received was unto him a promise of salvation?92 92.
