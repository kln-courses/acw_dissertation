Wallace Published online: 3 December 2008 © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008 Abstract This paper analyzes the reasons for which the incorporeal ultimate reality called the "Gnostic Body" (jñanakáya) is categorized as a "body" in the Kâlacakra tradition. It examines the diverse ways in which the body imagery is applied to ultimate reality within this tradition. Although conceptions of the Gnostic Body (jñana-kaya) as a special category of the Buddha-body have been included in all of the unexcelled yoga-tantras (anuttara-yoga-tantras), they are most exten sively elaborated upon in the Kâlacakra literature. For this reason, the analysis is primarily based on the Indian Kâlacakratantra literary corpus (11th century) (From among the Kâlacakratantra literature, I consulted the Kâlacakratrantra with the Vimalaprabhâ, Nâropâ's Sekoddesatîkâ, Sâdhuputra's Sekoddesatipanï, and the Sadahgayoga of Anupamaraksita.) and to the closely related Mañjusrí nâmasarngïti, Ravisrïjfiâna's commentary on the MañjusnnámasamgTti, the AmrtakanikâtippanT, and Vibhuticandra's subcommentary Amrtakanikodyotan ibandha (12th—13th centuries). In so doing, it will bring forth the evaluative and classificatory usages of the term jñana-kaya in the aforementioned sources, and the analysis is concerned with both the heuristic and provocative functions of their discourses. It also addresses the interpretative framework through which the Kâlacakra tradition constructs the notions of embodiment and suggests that Bud dhist esoteric discourse can be useful in demonstrating that the concept of a body can be understood as a broader category that extends from a physical body, to an immaterial perceptible form, and to the pure nondual awareness. An analysis of the multileveled constructions of the Gnostic Body (jñana-kaya) in the Indian Vajrayâna tradition opens new questions and new avenues of investigation with respect to critical assessments of the rubric of the "body," while bringing to light new models of embodiment.

Wallace Keywords Gnostic body • Bliss ■ Gnosis • Reflection of Emptiness • Realm of experience • Habitus Introduction In the Kâlacakra tradition, the Buddha's body (buddha-kâya) is characterized as having two aspects—absolute and phenomenal—in accordance with the Mahâyâna Buddhist doctrine of two truths: the ultimate and conventional. Depending upon the context in which a particular aspect is emphasized, the formless, absolute body of the Buddha is referred to by various names such as the jñana-kaya (Gnostic Body), sahaja-kâya, or sahaja-tanu (Innate Body), the mahâsukha-kâya (Body of Sublime Bliss), and the visuddha-kaya (Pure Body).1 It is conceived as a defining character istic (laksana) of all Buddha-bodies and as the essence (hrdaya) of all the Buddhas.2 In Indian Buddhist literature in general, the term kaya is frequently used to convey various variations of similar meanings such as body, heap, accumulation, world, and multitude. As we will see, in the Kâlacakra tradition, the term kâya conveys almost all of the aforementioned meanings when referring to either the phenomenal manifestations of the Gnostic Body or to its ultimate aspects. However, it also carries the meaning of a habitus. The Gnostic Body is said to transcend the material nature of atoms due to its freedom from spiritual ignorance (avidya) and resultant mental obscurations, which are the basis of corporeality. On account of being free from corporeal form, it is sheer luminosity (prabhâsitva).3 As such, it is devoid of shape, thought, and verbal expression. In other words, being ultimately unmanifest (avyakta) and beyond the domain of the sense-faculties, it is not a condition for objectification. While this view of the immateriality of the Buddha's absolute body accords with the Mahâyâna's view of nirvana without remainder (niropâdhi-nirvâna), it is supplemented elsewhere by the Buddhist tantric interpretation of emptiness. The classical Mahâyâna's interpretation of emptiness as the absence of inherent exis tence (nihsvabhâva), or as wisdom that perceives phenomenal and personal iden titylessness, is here extended to include the absence of material constituents of the mind-body complex. When the Gnostic Body is characterized as having a "form of 1 The Vimalaprabhâ commentary on the Kâlacakratantra (1994, v. 107, p. 202): advayam jñanam samvrtyâ suddhakáyah sahajakaya ityarthah. 2 The Amrtakanikodyotanibandha of Vibhûticandra (1994, p. 115): paramáksarajñánam vaksyamânam sarvetyâdi buddhânâm hrdayabhülam iti sarvatathagatajnànakâyatvâd mañjusriyah bodhisattvanáñ ca yato vikalpaklesâ bodhisattvânâm te vikalpâs ca paramâksare savâsanânirundhyanta iti. 3 The Vimalaprabhâ commentary on the Kâlacakratantra (1986. p. 23): buddhatvam nâma samsâravâsanâcittam iti/ prakrtiprabhâsvaram tad eva samsâravâsanârahitam.

In the context of yogic experience, the phrase "form of emptiness," or "empty form" (sünya-bimba) refers to a non-conceptualized appearance (âbhâsa) of one's own mind, which spontaneously emerges in empty space as 10 sequential signs (inimitta) of smoke, mirage, fireflies, and so on.4 This non-conceptualized appear ance is a result of the gradual eradication of mental obscurations and dissolution of the material constituents of the body through the practice of the six-phased yoga (sadahga-yoga). In the initial phase of the practice, the appearance of the empty form is seen with the physical eyes. Eventually, through progressive attainment of extrasensory perception, Bodhisattva stages, and full and perfect awakening (,samyaksambodhi), the yogi perceives the form of emptiness with a mental eye—with the divine eye (divya-caksu), Buddha-eye, wisdom-eye (prajña-caksu), and with the eye of gnosis (jñana-caksu).5 The space-element (âkâsa-dhâtu) in which the appearance of the form of emptiness arises is called a "pure atom" (suddhânu). Here, the word "atom" does not designate an irreducible material unit, but is used as a metaphor for the 12 Grounds (bhümis) achieved on the path to Buddhahood. The yogi's achievement of the 12 Grounds is marked by the purification of the five psychophysical aggregates (skandhas), elements (jmahâbhûtas), and sense-bases (ayatanas) from mental obscurations (cittâvaraná). On account of this purification, the yogi's material constituents vanish and the state of being in which all phenomena become of the same taste (sama-rasa) is actualized.6 The empty space that remains after a material substratum of the body has vanished is metaphorically called the "pure atom," or a "bindu 4 Ten daytime and nighttime signs are the signs of smoke, mirage, fireflies, a lamp, a flame, the moon, the sun, the supreme form, and a bindu. 5 The Sa4ahgayoga of Anupamaraksita (2000, pp. 95-96): atra prathamam mâmsacaksusâ yogy adikarmiko visva&lt;bimba&gt;m pasyaty abhijñábhir vina/ tato divyacaksusâ pasyaty abhijñavadhivasál/ tato buddhacaksusâ pasyati vîtarâgâvadhivasatahJ tatah prajñacaksusñ pasyati bodhisattvâvadhi vasâl'/ tato jñünacaksusa pasyati samyaksambuddhâvadhiciltavasât sarvopaddhivinirmukta iti/ evam tathagatasya pañcacaksümsi mâmsâdlny &lt;uktâni&gt; sünyatadarsanam prati/ anye sattvâh sünyatadarsanavisaye jâtyandhâ iti tattvabhâvanâniyamah. 6 The Vimalaprabhá commentary on the Kâlacakratantra (1994.

Wallace It is called a "bindu" because in the advanced stages of the practice, the form of emptiness is said to appear to the yogi as a bindu, from whose center radiates the "universal form" (visva-bimba), described as the body (rüpa) of the five unob scured (niràvarana) and imperishable (aksara) psychophysical aggregates (skan dha), or as a Buddha-body. While the form of emptiness is perceptible to the yogi in this fashion, others engrossed in the dualistic mode of perception are said to see only empty space, like persons blind from birth. Although the form of emptiness is ultimately shapeless, it is nevertheless a form that is detected through the absence of apprehended phenomena. However, the Gnostic Body of purified psychophysical aggregates transcends the duality of form and formlessness: it is not characterized by material form because it is devoid of atomic particles, and it is not characterized by form lessness because it has emptiness (sünyatü) as its form. Since emptiness is inseparable from space, its form is the endless space in which myriads of its own reflections emerge and cease. Therefore, the form of emptiness is also called "emptiness that is endowed will all aspects" (sarvakâra-sûnyatâ). Being all pervading like space and endowed with all aspects, the Gnostic Body is insep arable from its appearances (âbhâsa)—namely, the three worlds (traidhatu kâbhâsa) and the three times.7 It is for this reason that its appearance is called the "universal form" (visva-bimba). However, although the Gnostic Body is endowed with all aspects, it is ultimately devoid of any aspects. Moreover, owing to its unhindered pervasiveness, the Gnostic Body abides in the diverse bodies of beings. As it is nondual from the sublime bliss (mahâ-sukha) of nirvana, which is present in the bodies of all beings in the form of sensual bliss, it is considered to be the Innate Body (sahaja-kâya) of both the Buddhas and all embodied beings. Thus, while essentially bodiless, it is inseparable from the diverse bodies of beings throughout samsara, although ultimately remaining unaffected by them. Therefore, one is advised to attend to the phenomenal world in the same way one attends to the image of the Buddha created for the sake of worship.8 In this regard, the Gnostic Body can be considered a body in the sense that it is a limitless, space-like form encompassing all appearances within itself and a habitat of the corporeal world. For this reason, it is at times referred to as a bodiless (ananga) body. The Gnostic Body as a Realm of Gnosis Due to the fact that the Gnostic Body is ultimately devoid of corporality and yet endowed with all forms, its appearances are considered similar to the images in a 7 See the Sekoddesatika of Nâropa (2006.

Since the images appearing in a prognostic mirror are not reflections of actual objects that are external to the mirror, their cause is immaterial and they themselves are insubstantial. Similarly, the appearances of the Gnostic Body in the mirror of emptiness, in which all phenomena are at display, are illusory and insubstantial, for they have no existence outside that mirror. They are a mere reflection of emptiness (sûnyatâ-bimba), which is inherently non-arisen although it has a form. Thus, one could say that Gnostic Body, which has emptiness as its form, is at the same time a mirror and an array of the reflections of non-existing objects in the mirror. As such it ultimately exceeds any perception. While all of the appearances in the mirror of emptiness arise and cease, the Gnostic Body itself neither arises nor ceases.9 Although its wisdom aspect is pri mordially non-arisen, its method, or compassion aspect, is perpetually arisen, for it can be known by every individual as a nirmânakâya and a sambhogakaya. On the other hand, its empty form is not non-existent because it has arisen from space, and its imperishable bliss is not existent because it has arisen from the non-conceptu alized and illusion-like, empty form.10 Thus, the Gnostic Body transcends the categories of existence and non-existence in the same way as the image in a prognostic mirror escapes such a classification. If the image that is perceived by a virgin in a prognostic mirror were existent, the virgin would see a reflection of her face instead of some other image. If the image perceived by her were non-existent, 9 The Sekoddesattkâ of Nâropâ (2006, pp. 198-200): bimbasya sarvâkârasvacittâbhàsasyâbhûva ucchedo nâsiU ... abhâvâc chûnyât kevalâmalanabhastalâd eva pratyâtmavedyasya tryadhvat raidhâtukapratibhâsasyotpatteh/ .. .ata eva rûpârupavinirmukta ityucyate/ pratisenâyâm hi dapranâdyupalabhyamânasarirâyâm na rupalaksanam paramânudravyasandohâbhâvânn ârûpalaksanam upalabhyamânasya durapakramatvât/ tasmân na bimbam bhavam samsâram âyâti nirvânam ucchedam âyâti nâksaram.

A. Wallace she would be able to see nonexistent things such as the hare's horn, and the like, but this is not the case.11 Moreover, just as the virgin does not see the image in a prognostic mirror with her physical eyes that are covered by blinders, so the empty form of the Gnostic Body cannot be perceived by visual sense-faculty. It is perceptible only to the mind because it is nothing other than the reflection of one's own mind, since the mind is able to perceive its own reflection due to its innate luminosity; and this very luminosity of the mind is said to be an appearance of the other three Buddha bodies.12 Therefore, even though illusory forms of the Buddha-bodies such as limitless nirmânakâyas and sambhogakâyas may function as the object of cog nition for others, they are ultimately not a phenomenon separate from the mind that cognizes them. In this context, the term jñana-káya seems to designate the "realm of gnosis," or "the realm of mind," which cannot be explained ontologically but only in terms of its appearances and their functions. The Gnostic Body as a Collection of Bliss and Gnosis Furthermore, an appearance of the form of emptiness is said to be the cause of the imperishable bliss (aksara-sukha) attained through the accumulation of 21,600 moments of bliss, which, in turn, gives rise to the gnosis (jñana) of the perfection of wisdom (prajña-páramita). The indivisible unity of these two—emptiness and bliss—is termed the Gnostic Body (jñana-káya) and defined as the embodiment (.kayatva) of the gnosis of all the Tathâgatas.13 The term kâya here clearly sub sumes the meaning of a "collection," suggesting that the phrase jñana-káya is to be interpreted here as a "set of bliss and gnosis." This Kâlacakra tradition's view of a corporeal body as an extension of the afflictive and cognitive obscurations implies that even the mind and body that are characterized by physicality are not two opposing principles but extensions and expressions of each other. As indicated in the Sekoddesatlkâ, the psychophysical aggregates, elements, and sense-bases (ayatana) are nothing other than incidental 11 The Sekoddesatipant of Sadhuputra (1997. vs. 33-34, pp. 123-124): yadi pasyati sadrüpam svamukham kim rta pasyati/ yadi pasyaty asadrüpant sasasrhgam katham na ca// yadi lâvad vastu pratibhâti tadâ katham darpane samnihitam kumârikâyâ &lt;mu&gt;kham vid yamânam eva na pratibhâti/ asad vastv api na pratibhâti/ atyantâbhâvalaksanasasavisânasy âpratigamyamânatvât/ na pasyaty anyacaksurbhyâm svacaksurbhyâm na pasyatiZ drsyamânam ajâtam tu kumâryâ jâtakam yathâ// anyacaksurbhyâm iti lalâtâdibhâvâbhyâm svacaksurbhyâm na pasyati andhapatapracchâdi tatvât. 12 The Amrtakanikodyotanibandha of Vibhüticandra (1994. p. 152): dhâtugotram prakrtis cittasya prabhâsvaretyukte/... prabhâsvarâd eva kâyatrayaprathanât/ sahajodaye ksaranâsambhavâd avyayah/ anyam apeksya yogivisayah svayam bhavati akrtrimatvât sahajah. 13 The Amrtakanikodyotanibandha of Vibhüticandra (1994, p. 115): sarvatathâgatakâyajnânatvât.

This view provides a reason for which it can spontaneously appear as a reflection of the yogf s own mind in the form of various signs (nimitta).15 The mind and its reflection are said to be nondual, like the moon and the moonlight.16 Just as an eye can see its own reflection in a mirror, so the yogis apprehending mind (grâhaka-citta), which is wisdom (prajña) that knows the emptiness of all phenomena, sees its own reflection, which is the apprehended mind (grahya-citta) and characterized by the emptiness endowed with all aspects (sarvâkâropeta-sûnyatâ). The mind's perception of its empty form (sünya-bimba) is defined as self-awareness (sva samvedana). This self-awareness is said to result in the gnosis of imperishable bliss (aksara-sukha), which is metaphorically called the "face of the Buddha" (,buddha-vaktra), or "the face of gnosis" (jñana-vaktra). Being free from the habitual propensities of samsara (samsâra-vâsanâ), the gnosis of imperishable bliss liberates the mind from its obscurations and facilitates the arising of the new. imperishable psychophysical aggregates. The experience of the gnosis that is aware of its blissful nature is no longer contingent on the physical body. The newly emerged psychophysical aggregates, which are mutually pervasive and indistinguishable due to their immateriality, make up the Gnostic Body. This means that the Gnostic Body is not just a mere transcendence of the mind-body complex characterized by materiality but also the manifestation of its purified aspect. Thus, at the full and perfect awakening, the mind-body complex is not eliminated but only sublimated. This explains why the Gnostic Body is considered capable of functioning as the fundamental source of the unlimited capacities of the body, speech, and mind that manifest as various Buddha-bodies. This, perhaps, in part explains why in Vajrayâna discourse in general, mind-body imagery is projected onto ultimate reality itself, whose mind-body complex is interpreted such that emptiness is its form and the imperishable bliss is its the mind. 14 The Sekkodesatîkâ of Nâropâ (2006. pp. 201-202): iha hi yad vaktavyam mürkhaih paramânusandohâtmakaih skandhadhâtvâyatanair vina cittamâtrena prajñajñanam svasamvedyam na bhavati tan na/ kasmât/ âgantukacittavâsanâvasât/ iha skandhadhâtvâyatanam nâmâgantuka cittavâsanâ. 15 The Kâlacakratantra (1994, Chap. 5, v. 116d): sarvâkâram svacittam visayavirahitam nâparam citlam eva. 16 The Sadangayoga of Anupamaraksita (2000, p. 113): ajâtasyâniruddhasya yaj jñeyasyeha darsanamJ tat svacittasya nànyasya bâhyajneyavibhâgatah// The Sekoddesatipanï of Sâdhuputra (1997, v. 24, p. 122): asyaiva sâdhanam kuryât pratibhâsair acintitaih/ dhûmâdibhir nimittais taih prajñábimbair nabhahsamaihJ/ asyeti sarvaprapancarahitakâyacatustayaikalolrbhûtânuttaramahâsukhasvabhâvasya vajra sattvasya prajñábimbair nirvikalpánutlaraprajñásvarüpaprajñápratibhásákárais ca candrac andrikevâbhinnaih. Ô Springer</page><page sequence="8">52 V. A. Wallace On the basis of this, it was possible for the Kâlacakra tradition to personify the gnosis of sublime bliss as the Àdibuddha Kâlacakra. The mutual pervasiveness of emptiness and bliss, of gnosis (jñana) and the object of gnosis (jñeya), as ulti mate aspects of the mind and body is figuratively depicted as a couple in sexual union—Kâlacakra and Visvamâtâ. Their nonduality is conceived as a neuter gendered state (napumsaka-pada).17 This characterization is to point out not only the nonduality of the Buddha's mind and body but also to indicate ultimate reality as transcending any gender defining characteristics. It is said that although the Gnostic Body is often referred to as male because of its relation to the lineage of sages (rsis) through whom it historically emanated itself in the human world, in reality, it is neither male nor female, for it is ultimately unmanifest (avyakta). This conception of the omnipresent Gnostic Body as evading the gender-based classifications has provided the foundation for the androgynous model of humanity, social order, and the cosmos as a whole, which permeates this tantric system in various ways.18 The Gnostic Body encompasses various types of gnosis. It is the body of the gnosis of conventional reality (samvrti-jñana), which sees all phenomena as being similar to an illusion; and it is the body of the gnosis of ultimate reality (paramártha-jñana), which is the non-perception (anupalambha) of any dhar mas.19 It is also understood as a bearer (dhrk) of the vajra of gnosis of the four types of bliss (ânanda) inseparable from the manifestations of the four bodies of the Buddha. Hence, it is called the "Vajra-holder" (vajradhara) and is charac terized as a collection of the four drops of gnosis (jñcLna-bindu-samüha). Thus, in this context, the phrase jñana-kaya is a body in so far as it is understood as an agglomerate of multifaceted knowledge. However, since the four drops of gnosis are present in their impure aspects as minute, physical bindus ("drops") within four cakras of the embodied beings, the Gnostic Body is also an embodied human being in its phenomenal expression. The Gnostic Body as a Realm of Experience As mentioned earlier, Gnostic Body transcends the conceptual classifications of the subject of knowledge and the object of knowledge, because it does not apprehend external phenomena, but everywhere sees only itself. Therefore, it is a unified state of knowledge (jñana) and the object of knowledge (jñeya), which is achieved through the realization of the identitylessness (nairâtmya) of one's own mind, in which the apprehending mind (grâhaka-citta), or wisdom, has merged into the 17 The Sekoddesatîkâ of Nâropa (2006, p. 194): akàrasambhavah samyaksambuddhah prajño pâyâtmako vajrasattvo napumsakapadam sahajakâya ityucyate jñánajñeyátmako hetuphalayor abhedatvât/ sa ca kâlacakrabhagavân paramâksarah sukhapadam. 18 The Sekoddesatippanî of Sâdhuputra Srïdharânanda (1997, v. 151, p. 281: bimbam na bhâvam âyâti nâpi nirvânam aksaram/ anyonyâlingitam sântam napumsakapadam paramll 19 The Amrtakanikodyotanibandha of Vibhuticandra (1994, p. 128): jñánakáya jñanabindavahj samvrtijñanam mSyopamabhâvabodhah/ paramárthajñánam san'adharamânupalambhah.

In this regard, here too, the Gnostic Body, consisting of the unified sublime bliss and gnosis, is understood as a body in the sense that it is a realm pervaded by bliss and cognitive experience. It is said that this immaterial, luminous gnosis can be still considered a "body" (kaya) owing to the pervasiveness of its bliss (sukha-caryatva),20 which radiates limitless emana tions of bliss throughout the entire cosmos. It is on account of its blissful nature that the Gnostic Body is also called the "Body of Sublime Bliss" (mahâsukha-kâya). The Body of Sublime Bliss is experienced in three different ways in accordance with different levels of the spiritual conditions of beings. In the case of ordinary people (prthag-jana), who engage in sexual bliss with emission, it is experienced as an impure (samala) body. Âcâryas experience it as their stainless (nirmala) bodies, and in the case of Buddhas, it is experienced as a completely stainless (vimala) body of the undifferentiated bliss and emptiness.21 Thus, although it is ultimately pure and incorporeal, it does not escape the possibility of being experienced as impure and corporeal. Considered as the all-pervasive sublime bliss and the realm of absolute space (dharma-dhâtu), it is interpreted as a cause of the origination of all other Buddha-bodies and is accordingly termed "the progenitor (prajapati) of the Bud dhas22" and the "Great Body (maha-kâya) of all the Buddhas." Thus, it is the ultimate source of both samsara and nirvana: with regard to the former, it is a realm of experiences within the physical body; and in terms of the latter, it is a realm of space-embodied bliss. Thus in each instance, it is considered a body (kaya) on account of being a domain of experience. The Gnostic Body, known also as Innate Body (sahaja-kaya), is identified as a gnosis-vajra characterized by compassion. Therefore, it is also referred to as a pure yoga (visuddha-yoga), or as a vajra-yoga, consisting of wisdom and method. Owing to the destruction of the fourth (turya) state of the mind, it is purified by means of liberation through emptiness (sünyata-vimoksa), or by a gnosis that apprehends both emptiness as an absence of inherent existence (nihsvabhava) and the emptiness of the past and the future.23 Although this innate, Gnostic Body is a single unitary reality, it is said to manifest in four different ways.

It is the integrated body iyuganaddha-kâyà), in which ultimate and conventional realities are unified.25 This dharmakâya is the translucent sambhogakâya, which is a reflected image (prat ibimba) comprised of wisdom that knows the past and future of beings, and of the method that teaches them by means of unarticulated sounds that issue from it. Be cause it is devoid of the prânic winds associated with a physical body, its sounds are like an echo, devoid of verbal expressions, and are present everywhere. To violent beings, the sambhogakâya appears as the dark Heruka or as the ferocious Vajrab hairava in order to tame them. It appears as Vairocana in order to train the deluded, as Ratnasambhava to show generosity to the suffering, as Amitâbha to train impassioned beings, and as Amoghasiddhi to destroy the demons of obstacles (vighna).26 In order to mature sentient beings, this sambhogakâya becomes a nirmânakâya.

Although its emanations are inseparable from various phenomena, they are not physical bodies (rüpakáya). Just as the body of a person who appears in a dream is a projection of the dreamer's mind, so the nirmânakâyas are mere projections of the habitual propensities of the minds (citta-vâsanâ) of ordinary beings. Although incorporeal, each of these bodies is androgynous in that each can project an anthropomorphic form through which it appears as simultaneously male and female to beings on different planes of existence. Thus, all perceptible forms of the Gnostic Body exist only in relation to other sentient beings and not in and of themselves.27 The Gnostic Body as a Set of Esoteric Teachings and Practices The immateriality of all the manifestations of the Buddha-bodies is strongly emphasized throughout the Kâlacakra literature, for if the Buddhas were physical bodies, they would meet their end when their material forms are vanished. The misconception of the nirmânakâyas as physical forms is said to result from the incomprehension of the profound Buddha-dharma. This misconception is consid ered detrimental to one's spiritual progress, for it leads one to "deviant" practices. Those who misconceive the Buddha's emanations in this way are said to become overcome by delusion and hope that their putrid bodies will become Buddha's bodies in this life. They go for instruction to inauthentic teachers, ingest the five ambrosias (iamrta) in the hope of making their bodies ageless and immortal, and in hope of becoming the Varjasattva himself. They believe that one should actually kill beings by means of a samâdhi focused on a wrathful deity; and they lie, steal, and take other men's wives. Others, taking the words of evil tantric masters (âcâryas) as their authority, believe that one should follow the path of ten non-virtues by means of deity-yoga. They ingest substances that are not ritually purified and transformed into ambrosia and thereby ineffective in bringing about the qualities of Buddhahood.28 27 The Sekoddesattkâ of Nâropâ (2006, v. 151 and the commentary, pp. 198-199): bimbain na bhavam âyâti nâpi nirvânam aksaramJ anyonyâlingitam sântam napumsakapadam paramJ/ anyonyâlingitam sântam avikârlndriyavikârarahitatvât'/ idam evobhayâtmakam napumsa kapadam kevalaprajñopáyapaksayor abhâvat. 28 The Vimalaprabhâttkâ commentary on the Kâlacakratantra (1994, Chap. 5, pp. 71-72): ato bhgavato vacanâd riipakâyo bhagavàn na bhavati sarvabuddhânâm samâjitatvât/ yadi rûpakâyâ buddhâh tadâ paramânurûpenâpi mïlanam na syâd itil vâkyam srutvâ tathâpi sattvà bhagavatoktam gambhlrodâradharmam parïksayitvà na grhnanti buddhatvâya gurum ca parïksayitva nârâdhayanti mahâmitrkhâ lobhâbhibhûtâ santa ihaiva janamny asmâkam pûtisarïram buddhasarîram bha visyatïty âsâlubdhâ akalyânamitrasamsargâd asadgurûpadesâd iha vairocanâdîni pancâmrtâni gokudahanâdipalâni bhaksyâni svabhâvasuddhâni tathâgate noktâniV ebhir bhaksitaih sarlram ajarâmaram bhavisyati vajrasattvo 'pi varado bhavisyatîtil anyatra vajrakule krodharâjasamâdhinâ prânino ghâtyâhJ khadgakule 'moghasiddhisamâdhinà 'satyam vaktavyam/ ratnakule vairocanasamâdhinâ parasvam hâryatn/ padmakule 'mitâbha samâdhinâ parastrï grâhyà/ cakrakule vairocanasamâdhinâ pancâmrtapalâni bhaksânîyânïti/ apare 'pi dasâkusaladharmapathâ devatâyogena yoginâ kartavyâ itil evam dustâcâryavacanam pra mânlkrtya dasâkusalân karmapathân kurvanti asodhitâny abodhitâny apradïpitâny anamrtïkrtâni bhaksyantil tâni ca bhaksitâni pancâmrtâni na tesâm bhaksakânâm buddhatvagunadâyakâni bha vanttti tathâgatavacanâprabhodhatvâd iti. â Springer</page><page sequence="12">56 V. A. Wallace When the secret Vajrayâna is properly understood, one knows the Vajrayâna to be itself the unified state of the body, speech, and mind,29 which results from bliss and gives rise to the gnosis of bliss. Vajrayâna itself is said to be the Gnostic Body for a number of reasons. The gnosis of sublime bliss is such that it expands (tanyate) as a great tantra (mahâtantra), as an extended discourse (prabandha);30 and the sounds and meanings of its mantras are nothing other than the sublime bliss of the Gnostic Body, which protects the mind of the yogi.31 Thus, here, the Gnostic Body is considered to be a body in the sense of being a set of esoteric teachings and practices that have issued from it, point to it, and lead one to its realization. The Gnostic Body as a Habitus of All Divine Forms Since there is nothing separate from the Gnostic Body, one is told that even various nirguna and saguna divine forms, which are sought after and worshipped by the proponents of the Brâhmanic tradition, are contained in it. The Gnostic Body is a knower of brahman (brahma-vid), as its blissful gnosis is declared to be brahman on the basis of the statement that the nature of brahman is bliss (ânando bra hmano r ftp am).32 In that regard, the Gnostic Body is characterized as liberation (moksa), the fourth pursuit of men. It is also said to be the Brahma of the Brâhmanas, for it is the body of sublime passion and the nature of Brahma's four faces, characterized by the four Divine Abidings (brahmavihâras). It is the very nature of Visnu, Râhu, Indra, Tryambaka, and other deities,33 although unrecog nized as such by the Brâhmanic sages who consider the older Vedic Dharma to be 29 The Amrtakanika of Ravisrîjfiâna (1994. p. 4): guhyam sravakapratyekabuddhayanayor uttaram vajrayânam kâyavâkcittajnânaikalolïbhûto vâ tatra mahâsukharûpatayâ râjata iti guhyarât. 30 The Amrtakanika of Ravisrîjfiâna (1994, p. 8): mâyâjâle mâyâjâlâbhisambodhilaksane tanyate vyutpñdyata iti tantram/ . . . mahâtantram mahâsukhajnânam ity arthahl uktañ ca tantram prabandham âkhyâtam samsâram tantram isyate/ tantram guhyam rahasySkhyam uttaram tantram ucyate// 31 The Vimalaprabhâ commentary on the Kâlacakratantra (1994.

Thus, as the ultimate body of all Buddhist and Brâmanic deities, the Gnostic Body is understood as a habitat of all divine forms. The Gnostic Body as a Social Habitus of Gnosis We are told, the Buddhas abide in their empty form (sünya-bimba) whether they enter the mother's womb in order to mature ordinary people, whether they arise in a heaven to eliminate the ego-grasping (ahamkâra-grahana) of the Sràvakas dwelling in heavens, or whether they manifest in the syllable evam in order to establish the great Bodhisattvas—such as Subhüti, Maitreya, and others—in com plete and perfect Buddhahood, instructing them in the fourth, Gnostic Body.35 Thus, the Gnostic Body is not to be seen as static, for although peaceful (santa), it is continually operative through its luminosity, bliss, and compassion. The phenomenal aspect of the Gnostic Body—whether cosmic, social, or indi vidual—is an appearance of spiritual ignorance whereby one perceives a material form where there is none and identifies it as "I" or "mine." A phenomenal body is not a thing in and of itself, but rather a series of experiential events taking place in con 34 See the Vimalaprabhâ commentary' on the Kàlacakratantra (Chap. 5, 1994, p. 95): atha brah marslnâm dustavacanam iha prâgvedadharmah sahajah pascat sarvajñadesito dharmah krtakah / tasmâd vedadharmo jyesta iti. 35 The Kâlacarkatantra and the Vimalaprabhâ (1994.

Until the mental obscurations are removed and the material nature of the mind-body complex sublimated, the phenomenal manifestations of the Gnostic Body are experienced as the source of bondage and suffering on account of grasping onto them as real. Just as a human being is a phenomenal aspect of the unitary Gnostic Body, which has the capacity for transformation, so is human society. Social hierarchies based on social class and blood lineages are rooted in the ignorance of social ego, with its attachments to class distinctions, race, and social status. When a social hierarchical order is deconstructed through the uprooting of the social ignorance, and when a new integrated society is constituted, the Gnostic Body is instantiated in the from of a social body united by gnosis. In this regard, the Gnostic Body is a body in the sense of a social habitus of gnosis. Even though the Kâlacakra tradition's discourse on the Gnostic Body points to liberation as freedom from a corporeal body and to spiritual progress as a process of disembodiment, it does not propound a duality between the corporeal body and the immaterial Gnostic body. The corporeal body is able to function as a soteriological instrument through which liberation is achieved only because its ultimate nature does not rest in the transitory psychophysical aggregates and incidental mental obscur ations but in the all-encompassing gnosis of bliss. Thus, as we have already seen, the Gnostic Body is at the same time immaterial and corporeal. Conclusion In concluding reflections, I would like to point to the broader theoretical implications of this analysis of constructions of the Gnostic Body in this tantric tradition. Its various interpretative characterizations of the Gnostic Body show that not only the material form that provides the basis for physical experiences can be considered a body but also the domain of mental experiences. According to the Kâlacakra litera ture, empty space can be taken as a grand body. An event, in which knowledge and the object of knowledge are non-differentiated can also be a body, and so too can pure bliss be a body. As indicated earlier in this paper, this model of embodiment chal lenges the prevailing views of what makes up a body by introducing new categories of embodiment and expanding the existing definitions of the body. One can also say that while the Kâlacakra tradition takes up the body as a useful category for structuring its practice and constructing its complex theory, it ends deconstructing the entire category by positing the Gnostic Body as inconceivable and inexpressible ultimate reality that transcends any categorizations. The tradition seems to suggest that being an experiential reality, the Gnostic Body cannot be reduced to any definition but can be only experienced.36 Since the Gnostic Body can mean a wide variety of different things, it gives way to different conceptualizations, 36 The Sekoddesatippani of Sâdhuputra Srîdharânanda (1997, v. 137, p. 26): evam na sakyate vaktum samadhirathitaih sukhamJ samadhBv aksaram prâpya svato vetti mahâsukham// Ô Springer</page><page sequence="15">Why is the Bodiless (ahanga) Gnostic Body (jñcina-kaya) Considered a Body? 59 none of which is able to encompass it in its entirety.37 Likewise, when grasped in cognitive terms, it is difficult to definitely determine what the Gnostic Body actually is, for it can be anything and everything, and ultimately it is neither a thing nor an absence of the thing, only an experience. In this way, the Kâlacakra tradition's exposition of the Gnostic Body confronts us with a paradoxical need to apprehend in cognitive terms that which by nature evades any cognition, and yet, it itself is self 38 cognizant.
