<plain_text><page sequence="1">7 STONE ROWS IN THE SOUTH OF IRELAND By Sean ? Nuall?in, m.r.i.a. Ordnance Survey Office, Phoenix Park, Dublin [Received 19June 1987. Read 16 March 1988. Published 30 December 1988.] ABSTRACT The Cork-Kerry type of stone rows consist of short lines of free-standing orthostats set along a general north-east-south-west axis. The number of stones employed varies from two to six and the rows range from almost 2m to over 13m in length. Two categories are distinguished, those with two stones and those with three to six stones. One hundred and seventy examples are known, all save six being in the counties of Cork and Kerry. A catalogue and plans of the rows are presented. The morphology, associa tions, distribution and early Bronze Age dating of the monuments are considered, and their context and function analysed. A final section discusses related monuments in Ireland, Great Britain and the Armorican peninsula. Introduction This paper continues a series which makes available a corpus of the free standing megalithic monuments of Cork, Kerry and nearby counties in the southern part of Ireland (? Nuall?in 1978; 1984a; 1984b). The present work deals with the stone rows of the region, of which 170 examples are known. These can be divided into two categories: those with three to six stones (rows) and those represented by two stones (pairs). The 91 pairs listed in the catalogue are confined to the counties of Cork and Kerry, as are 73 of the 79 rows. Single rows are recorded in the adjoining counties of Clare, Limerick, Tipperary and Waterford, and in nearby counties Kilkenny and Wexford. A third group is represented by twelve further pairs which may fall within either of the above categories or be the remains of other types of monuments. In the account which follows, the monuments are referred to by their townland names followed by their numbers in the catalogue. Of the 182 monuments listed in the catalogue, all save seventeen are shown on one or other edition of the Ordnance Survey (O.S.) six-inch maps, usually under the name 'Gall?in' or 'Gallauns' (i.e. standing stones). Sixty-nine are described or mentioned in the literature prior to 1986 and, of these, 28 are listed in Conlon's survey of the megalithic monuments in the northern portion of County Cork (1916; 1917; 1918). Few accurate plans or elevations have been published in the past, but the present survey provides drawings for all those listed in the catalogue with the exception of four destroyed Cork monuments, Tooreenglanahee (no. 3), Barrahaurin (no. 13), Carrigadrohid (no. 103) and Caum (no. 104), and two others in the same county, Glandine (no. 78) and Knocks (no. 133), where concealment of the stones precluded a plan. The greater part of the fieldwork for this paper was undertaken by the Archaeological Branch of the Ordnance Survey during the period 1973-7 and a further twenty or so examples came to our attention over the succeeding years. Meanwhile Ann Lynch had completed her study of the morphological, astronomi The subvention granted by the Ordnance Survey towards the cost of publication of this paper is gratefully acknowledged by the Royal Irish Academy.

Excavations have taken place at two pairs of stones and at two stone rows. The pair at Kealkill (no. 119), Co. Cork, formed part of a complex which included a five-stone circle and a radial-stone cairn (? R?ord?in 1939) and, like the other pair at Carrigadrohid (no. 103) in the same county (Fahy 1957), it yielded no finds. The excavation evidence from the stone rows at Cashelkeelty (no. 69), Co. Kerry, and Maughanasilly (no. 33), Co. Cork, formed an important component of Lynch's research in the south-west. The Cashelkeelty row stood beside the remains of a five-stone circle which contained a cremation burial. Finds from the vicinity of the stone row included two flint arrowheads which could point to a late Neolithic/ early Bronze Age date. The single artifact recovered from the excavation at Maughanasilly (no. 33) was a thumb-shaped flint scraper. Morphology and associations A Cork-Kerry-type stone row consists of a line of free-standing orthostats set along a general north-east/south-west axis. The stones are of megalilhic proportions and the number employed varies from two to six. The rows range in length from about 2m in some examples with two stones to 13.40m at Castlenalact (no. 36) which has four massive stones. The tallest stone in a row is usually at one end, more often than not at the south-west, and the other stones may sometimes decrease in height as they approach the opposite end of the row. The stones are not set with their long axes in precise alignment and indeed in many instances serious deviations occur. The rows are occasionally found in close proximity to stone circles, boulder-burials, cairns and enclosures. Monuments composed of free-standing orthostats are especially vulnerable and it has to be accepted that some rows may have had a greater number of stones than is at present apparent. However, since just over half of the Cork-Kerry type are represented by two stones, it would seem likely that pairs of stones were an important part of the repertoire of the builders and this is supported by the evidence from Kealkill (no. 119) (? R?ord?in 1939) and Carrigadrohid (no. 103) (Fahy 1957) where the excavations revealed no futher sockets. There was no indication at Maughanasilly (no. 33) that the row there had ever consisted of more than the five erect stones now present (Lynch 1981, 69), though at Cashelkeelty (no. 69) the socket of a missing stone was located to the east of the three still standing (Lynch 1981, 66). Rows of three to six stones Seventy-nine rows consist of three or more orthostats. Those with three stones, of which there are 53, are by far the commonest type, followed by rows of four stones with fifteen examples. Seven examples have five stones and there are four with six stones. The rows range in length from the small three-stone example at Currakeal (no. 31), which is 2.70m long, to the largest, Castlenalact (no. 36), where the four tall stones extend over a distance of 13.40m. There does not appear to be any relationship between the length of the rows and the number of stones employed; e.g. the three-stone example at Gneeves (no. 4) is 8.30m long while that at Reananerree (no. 22), with six stones, is only 7.20m. The gaps between the stones vary from 20cm at Reananerree (no. 22) to 3.90m at Doory (no. 64) (Fig.lb).</page><page sequence="3">? Nuall?in?Stone rows 181 The stones employed are normally rectangular slabs or pillar-like stones though blocky boulders are found at a few sites. In the majority of cases the heights of the stones are greater than their lengths. Most are set with their long axes roughly in line though marked deviations in alignment do occur, e.g. Castlenalact (no. 36). At one example, Gneeves (no. 4), the three stones are set with their long axes at right angles to the east-west line made by the stones. In many cases the stones are roughly graded in height with the tallest stone at one end. Thirty-eight examples have the tallest stone towards the west while in twenty the tallest stone is towards the east. The position is summarised in the following table. Table 1?Position of tallest stone in row Between Rows with West end-stones East Unknown Total 3 stones 26 3 12 12 53 4 stones 8 - 5 114 5 stones 2 12 2 7 6 stones 2-1 25 Totals 38 4 20 17 79 The lowest stone is not invariably at one end and indeed in ten three-stone rows it stands in the middle. A number of four-stone examples consist of two pairs, each with a tall and short stone, e.g. Ardrah (no. 40) and Kildreelig (no. 67). The six-stone example at Beenalaght (no. 12) has tall stones at either end with the adjoining stones decreasing in height towards the middle. A similar profile is evident in the four-stone examples at Cabragh (no. 16) and Castlenalact (no. 36). In fact in only nineteen rows can it be said that the stones decrease in height from one end to the other. The heights of the stones vary considerably from row to row, though at individual sites they generally fall within a limited range. Thus at Gortyleahy (no. 23) the stones are 1.40m, 1.25m and lm high, while at Ardamore (no. 60) the stones are 3.20m, 2.05m and 2.50m high. The tops of the stones may be straight, sloped or gabled in outline but curved profiles are seldom, if ever, present. Five-stone circles occur in close proximity to three stone rows (Table 2). The massive row at Cabragh (no. 16) stands 6m to the south-east of its circle while the row at Cashelkeelty (no. 69) is less than 2m to the south of that circle. The row at Canrooska (no. 30) stands about 4m to the south of the circle there and 7m beyond this again is a low cairn. The great stones at Cabragh (no. 16) dominate the circle, while the taller of the stones at Cashelkeelty (no. 69) and Canrooska (no. 30) rise well above the stones of the nearby circles. Rows of three or more stones are not known in the vicinity of multiple-stone circles though pairs of stones occur at two of these circles (see below). Two probable associations of stone rows with boulder-burials were recognised during the present survey. Some 24m to the north of the row of three stones at Dromteewakeen (no. 63) is a boulder, 1.60m in maximum dimension, resting above four or more low stones. This seems to be a boulder-burial but its true nature cannot be verified until the enveloping peat is removed. The complex at Clonglaskan (no. 45) is difficult to interpret but seems to include a row of three tall stones and one, if not two, boulder-burials.</page><page sequence="4">182 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Table 2?Alphabetical list of 79 rows of three or more stones and their associated monuments Townland and No. of county Catalogue no. stones in row Associated monuments Ardamore (Ke.)

Kerbed cairn Outlying monolith (Co-Cork, Ke.=Kerry, Cl.=Clare, Li.=Limerick, Ti.=Tipperary, Ki.=Kilkenny, Wx.=Wexford, Wt.=Waterford) Enclosures of uncertain nature occur near four stone rows. That at Derrynagree (no. 32) is 18m from the stone row and consists of a bank 1.50m high surrounding a raised area some 9m in diameter. At Gortacloghane (no. 65) an enclosure, about 5.50m in diameter, defined by five or six erect stones and a number of flat or fallen slabs, stands within 2m of the row and appears to be ancient. An enclosure, perhaps also ancient, is situated about 8m to the west of the row at Gortnagulla (no. 61). This consists of stones, up to 1.20m in maximum dimension, laid flat and enclosing an area about 3m in diameter. The enclosure beside the stone row at Garrough (no. 68) could be the ruins of a hut or perhaps a kiln. This consists of a bank, up to 1.50m wide, enclosing an area about 4m in diameter. Some of these structures may be broadly contemporary with their associated rows but the occurrence of ring-forts near the stone rows at Beal Middle (no. 57), Lissaclarig West (no. 53) and the site of the destroyed fort at Tomdeely North (no. 72) would seem to be fortuitous. The ruins of cairns are found close to two stone rows. An arc of six low stones together with a number of loose slabs stands 2m to the north of the row at Maulinward (no. 52). These stones appear to represent a cairn about 5m in diameter. The second example is at Dooneens (no. 19) where four, low, set stones</page><page sequence="6">184 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy and some loose slabs appear to represent the remains of a small cairn with radially set stones (? Nuall?in 1984b, no. 12). Monoliths are associated with three rows. At Tooreen West (no. 74) the monolith stands 2.10m to the west of the row of four stones. A different arrangement occurs at Doory (no. 64) where a monolith, 2.05m high, stands in line with and 15.50m to the south-west of the three-stone row. There would seem to be a deliberate disposition of monolith and row here, though whether or not the two are contemporary remains a matter for conjecture. While there is some reason to infer that monuments occurring in close proximity at sites stich as Cashelkeelty (no. 69) or Canrooska (no. 30) are likely to be more or less contemporary, such an inference is more difficult to stistain at sites with more widely separated monuments. An extreme example occurs at Ardamore (no. 60) where a tall monolith, bearing cup and ring markings, stands 59m to the north east of the row of three tall stones. Pairs of stones One hundred and three monuments consisting of two stones were identified during the survey and at these the stones were found to stand apart at distances ranging from 55cm to 9.40m. The histogram (Fig. la) illustrates the range of gaps at the 72 examples where both stones are erect or where their original distance apart is otherwise known. Since the greatest gap recorded between stones in the rows with three to six stones is 3.90m (Fig. lb), it was thought proper that examples which appreciably exceeded that measurement should be treated as a group apart. The gap exceeds 4.15m in nine examples and these anomalous pairs are treated separately in the next section, as is the problematic monument at Kilcullen (no. 165). At 31 other pairs one or both stones are prostrate or are known to be missing. In 29 instances the stones are less than 3.85m apart and, on the assumption that fallen stones lie close to their original positions, these too are regarded as normal. The other two, with gaps of 6.80m and 7.50m, are assigned to the anomalous group. The 91 pairs dealt with here range in length from 1.90m at Ballinvarrig (no. 101) and Ceancullig (no. 129) to 5.20m at Ballyhalwick (no. 123). The stones, in general, are similar in size and shape to those in the rows. An exceptionally tall stone, 5.30m high, was present at Kealkill (no. 119) but otherwise the range in height is from 3.60m and 3.25m at Coolcoulaghta (no. 136) to lm and 70cm at Kilmore (no. 138). Again, the stones are set with their long axes roughly in line though in one case, Rathcool (no. 141), more precise alignment is evident. In a few instances a stone is set with its long axis at right angles to the line indicated by its fellow, e.g. Coolcoulaghta (no. 136). In the majority of cases the pairs consist of a taller and a shorter stone. At 31 examples the taller stone is towards the south-west, at 24 towards the north-east, and at four others the stones are level. At the remaining 32 sites the position of the taller stone is unknown or uncertain. At two pairs, Gurteenard (no. 76) and Reask (no. 144), the usual north-east-south-west custom of orientation, discussed below, is not observed. At the former the taller stone is at the north-west and at the latter it stands at the south-east. Associations of pairs of stones with multiple-stone circles are rare (Table 3). The two massive stones at Lissyviggeen (no. 154) stand outside a bank which encircles a small circle of seven stones. Another possible association occurs at Glantane East, Co. Cork (? Nuall?in 1984a, no. 2). Here a slab, exceeding 5m in</page><page sequence="7">?

The original positions of these slabs are uncertain but it seems likely that they were erect at one time and may have formed a pair. Associations with five-stone circles are a little more numerous. At Clodagh (no. 131) a pair of low stones stands to the west of the circle, while the pair at Baurgorm (no. 126) is situated to the south of that circle. The pairs at Knocknakilla (no. 82), Knockraheen (no. 89) and Kealkill (no. 119) occur in complexes each containing a five-stone circle and a radial-stone cairn.</page><page sequence="8">186 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Boulder-burial (Two pairs of stones at this site) Five-stone circle Table 3?Alphabetical list of 91 pairs of stones and their associated monuments Townland and county Catalogue no.

The pair at Mill Little (no. 118) is part of a complex containing two or possibly three boulder-burials and a five-stone circle, while the pairs at Curraghawaddra (no. 92), Teernahillane (no. 124) and Ballycommane (no. 137) are accompanied by single boulder-burials. A single monolith stands 7.50m to the north-east of the row at Newcastle (no. 98) and roughly in line with it. A similar juxtaposition is found at Meenahony (no. 84) though here the monolith is 58.5m from the other stones and is not set in line with them. These associations are paralleled at the multiple-stone rows at Doory (no. 64) and Ardamore (no. 60). As indicated above, the monolith at the latter bears a series of cup and ring markings and so does one of the pair of fallen stones at Milltown (no. 149), situated about 10km to the west. [G8]</page><page sequence="10">188 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy Anomalous pairs of stones Twelve examples are placed in this category. The pair at Kilcullen South (no. 165) stands 27m to the west of a large oval earthwork and is remarkably similar to two of the three stones marking the entrance to an almost obliterated burial enclosure at Oughtihery (? R?ord?in 1979, 148) almost 4km to the north-east (Fig. 66). It was thought best to exclude this monument from the main list. At the other pairs the gaps between the stones, where both are erect (Fig. la), vary from 5.15m at Glandine (no. 161), which is 6.50m in overall length, to 9.40m at Drumlave (no. 168) where the stones span a total distance of 11m. Six of these examples are aligned in a general north-east-south-west direction and at all save one the tallest stone is at the north-cast. The other two examples are aligned in the opposite direction and in both the tallest stone is to the south-east. Two of the three pairs where one of the stones is prostrate seem also to have been aligned north-west-south-east. Some of the monuments in this group may be complete but the possibility that any one could be the remains of a more complex structure cannot be excluded. Two examples are associated with other structures (Table 4). A five-stone circle stands 3.50m from the eastern stone at Glanbrack (no. 170) while the ruins of two huts of unknown date lie 5m from the western stone at Drumlave (no. 168).

The procedure adopted was to join centre points (determined by intersecting diagonals) of the last erect stones at either end of a row or of both stones in the case of pairs. This method makes no claim to precision but does produce a picture of the general splay of orientation present in each group. Of the 79 rows of three or more stones, 69 retain a minimum of two erect stones thus allowing an approximate determination of their general alignment. The diagram in Fig. 2a exhibits a splay of 92? for 65 examples centred on a north-east south-west axis and extending from 187? to 279? at the west. The other four rows are Comillane (no. 56) at 350?, Kippagh (no. 6) at 355?, Tomdeely North (no. 72) at 357? and Fermoyle (no. 176) at 358?.</page><page sequence="11">?

Orientation diagram, stone pairs in counties Cork and Kerry.</page><page sequence="12">190 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy The alignments of sixty pairs of stones where both stones were erect at the time of survey are shown on the diagram in Fig. 2b. Again, apart from two examples, their splay of 82? is centred on a north-east-south-west axis extending from 186? to 268? at the west. The other examples, Reask (no. 144) at 144? and Gurteenard (no. 76) at 320?, appear to represent deviations from the norm, but the possibility that they may be the remains of other types of monuments cannot be excluded. The alignment of the pair at Knocks (no. 133) also falls within the general north east-south-west splay, but it was not feasible to obtain a compass reading here. In the case of 26 further examples a single stone remains erect at each and the indications are that, apart from one example, Kilcullen South (no. 97), the alignments of these too fall within the same splay. Taking the stone rows and pairs as a unified series it can be said that of the 129 examples where it has been possible to ascertain the orientation, all save six examples fall within a splay of 93? centred on a north-east-south-west axis and extending from 186? to 279? at the west. This is remarkably similar to the pattern of orientation established for the stone circles of Cork and Kerry where the centres of the axial stones in the 59 examples with definable axes lie between 186? and 293? (? Nuall?in 1984a, 5). The stone rows and pairs then, like the stone circles, are so built that their long axes indicate a general alignment on the sectors of the heavens in which the sun rises and sets, and both series tend,to group in a position indicating a winter rather than a summer position for the sun. A somewhat similar custom is observed by the 460 or so Irish wedge tombs, all of which are placed with their entrances to the west of the north/south line. Distribution The distribution of the Munster stone rows is concentrated in Cork and Kerry but extends beyond into six nearby counties, Clare, Tipperary, Limerick, Waterford, Wexford and Kilkenny, each of which contains a single example with three or more stones. It will be immediately apparent from the maps (Figs 3a and 3b) that the distribution of the rows and pairs of stones is largely coincident in Cork and Kerry. Together they occupy much the same general region as do the stone circles (Figs 4a and 4b), though the rows extend beyond the ambit of the circles into the peninsulas of Iveragh and Dingle. Concentrations are found in three areas where stone circles occur in some profusion: the highlands flanking the basin of the River Lee, the Beara peninsula, and the hinterland of Bantry Bay. In contrast, they are found only on the periphery of the group of circles in the Clonakilty area, while there is but one example, the row of three stones at Dromatouk (no. 66), among the circles at the inner end of the Kenmare River. Neither rows nor circles are found at the end of the Mizen Head peninsula, an area occupied by the wedge tomb people. In general, it can be said that the rows and pairs, like the five-stone circles, have a largely inland distribution. Neverthe less rows or pairs are present in all the coastal copper-bearing areas where stone circles occur, while isolated examples are found elsewhere, near the deposits at Coad Mountain, Clear Island, and Glandore (Jackson 1979, 108-9). Stone circles and boulder-burials do not appear to have any special siting customs and this is also true of the rows and pairs. Some, like the row of four stones at Kildreelig (no. 67), are prominently situated on high ground, while others such as the pairs at Keilnascarta (nos 127 and 128) are on rather featureless land. The majority are situated at altitudes ranging from 100 to 900 feet above sea level: four pairs and three rows are situated below 100 feet while five pairs and one</page><page sequence="13">? Nuall?in?Stone rozos 191 row are between altitudes of 1000 and 1300 feet. Table 5 shows the altitude preferences of the rows and pairs with, for comparative purposes, those of the stone circles, boulder-burials and wedge tombs in Cork and Kerry. The table incorporates data from 38 recently identified monuments: twenty wedge tombs, eight boulder-burials and ten stone circles.

The boulder-burials, for the most part, occupy low-lying coastal areas and their distribution is very different to that of the five-stone circles, the majority of which are inland with all save two situated above the 300 foot contour (O Nuall?in 1978, 79). In contrast to their smaller relatives, the multiple-stone circles predominate in coastal areas (O Nuall?in 1984a, 8) and twenty examples lie below the 300 foot contour. Some rows and pairs occur along the coast though the greater number lie inland. The rows extend more or less evenly tip to the 1000 foot contour while the pairs, though reaching above the 1200 foot contour, are found in considerable numbers at the lower altitudes where 63.7% of the 91 examples lie below 500 feet. The occupancy of the higher lands with their thinner, better-drained soils may indicate an interest in stock-raising. On a national basis it has been shown that 32% of the 422 wedge tombs then known were located between the 600 and 900 foot contours (? Nuall?in 1983, 84). In the Cork/Kerry region 43.4% of the wedge tombs are between the 600 and 900 foot contours, and this compares with 29.1% for the stone circles and 25% for the rows and pairs combined. Context, dating and function Context The Cork/Kerry-type stone rows have a number of features in common with the stone circles of the region: 1. they are composed of free-standing megaliths set apart rather than contiguously; 2. the stones are roughly graded in height;</page><page sequence="14">192 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy \ s* DINGLE BAY CO.

It is evident, then, that the rows and circles are closely related elements of the one tradition. If, as now seems likely, the vast majority of the single standing stones in the region are shown to be further constituents of that same tradition, then this great complex of monuments, together with the associated boulder-burials and cairns, would represent an intense and widespread exploitation of the lands and resources of southern Munster in prehistoric times. Dating The close association of rows or pairs with stone circles at ten sites suggests that the rows should date to the late Neolithic/early Bronze Age period, and this is borne out by the recovery of the leaf-shaped arrowhead and a barbed and tanged example from the vicinity of the stone row at Cashelkeelty (no. 69) (Lynch 1981, 67). However, the stratigraphie evidence is considered to indicate that the row was erected before the nearby stone circle and a late Bronze Age date of c. 1000 b.c. has been suggested for its construction (Lynch 1981, 18, 66). Two radiocarbon determinations from charcoal found within the Cashelkeelty stone circle (Lynch 1981, 64-9) were returned as 2920 ? 60 b.p. (GrN-9173) and 2665 ? 50 b.p. (GrN-9172), and suggest that the circle was erected during the period 970-715 b.c. These dates are later than might be expected and would seem to be inconsistent with the archaeological context indicated by the arrowheads found near the stone row. Determinations from charcoal found in the vicinity of two other stone rows are somewhat more satisfactory. Two identical determinations from the Maughanasilly site (no. 33), returned as 3265 ? 55 b.p. (GrN-9280 and GrN-9281), indicate that the row was erected in 1315 ? 55 b.c., while a date of 3330 ? 50 b.p. (GrN-9346) or 1380 ? 50 b.c. from a charcoal spread near the Dromatouk row (no. 66) may be related to the period of use of that monument (Lynch 1981, 73). Function The function of the stone rows remains unknown. The few excavations at Irish sites have provided little evidence and the excavations at the stone row and circle at Cholwichtown, on Dartmoor (Eogan 1964), were also inconclusive. However, the frequent association of stone rows in these islands with cairns and stone circles, from which there is increasing evidence for burial, does suggest some sort of funerary or commemorative role for such rows. In Ireland the presence of boulder-burials near six stone rows or pairs supports this view, while the discovery of a grave-like, slab-covered pit close to the row at Cashelkeelty (no. 69) (Lynch 1981, 66) may also be significant. It has been said that some pairs of standing stones represented figures o? deities (Macalister 1928, 105-6) or may have been of cult significance (? Riord?in 1979, 148), while Davies (1939b, 169-70) considered certain pairs of stones in the</page><page sequence="17">? Nuall?in?Stone rows 195 north of Ireland to be anthropomorphic with male and female connotations. The Cork/Kerry pairs are clearly rudimentary rows, and while a cult significance could be appropriate for pairs and rows in general there is little or no evidence to sustain the other suggestions. Irish and foreign relationships Ireland Two major concentrations of stone rows, each reflecting the architectural style of the stone circles of their respective regions, exist in Ireland (Figs 5a and 5b), the Munster rows and a mid-Ulster group (Davies 1939a). Most of the Ulster rows, like the circles they accompany, are composed of numerous small stones, set close together and seldom exceeding lm in height. They are frequently set tangentially to circles and can run to 30m or more in length. Rows and circles are often set in clusters and are sometimes accompanied by cairns, cists and monoliths, e.g. Drumskinny, Co. Fermanagh (Waterman 1964), and Beaghmore (Pilcher 1969; 1975), Castledamph (Davies 1938) and Copney Hill (Foley 1983), all in County Tyrone. There are few significant finds from the vicinity of the Ulster rows but radiocarbon determinations from the Beaghmore excavations are available. The initial determinations yielded a time bracket of from 1935 ? 55 b.c. (UB-11) to 775 ? 55 b.c. (UB.163) for cairn 10 (Pilcher 1969, 76), and a date of 1605 ? 45 b.c. (UB-23) for charcoal associated with a hoard of flint cores found close to the stone row associated with circles F and G (Pilcher 1969, 80). Later conservation work at the site uncovered a hearth 'just to the NE' of the row adjoining cairn 6, together with 65 flint flakes, a scraper and two sherds of decayed pottery. Charcoal from the hearth has yielded a determination of 2185 ? 80 b.c. (UB-603) (Pilcher 1975) which would be in accord with the Neolithic pottery discovered by May (1953) at two hearths within circle C. An important feature of the Beaghmore complex is the presence of a number of short rows of three or four tall stones, again set tangentially to the circles, and remarkably similar in appearance to those of Munster. Similar rows, sometimes accompanying circles, have been noted sporadically throughout the stone circle distribution in mid-Ulster and also in the east of the province (Davies 1939a, 6-14 and map, fig. 1), while isolated rows at Shantemon, Co. Cavan (H464 076) (? R?ord?in 1979, 147), and Barnes Lower, Co. Donegal (Lacy 1983, 77), may be related to the series. The occurrence of such rows suggests affinities with the Munster series. Recent fieldwork in the Connemara region of north-west Galway, undertaken by Michael Gibbons, Jim Higgins and Tim Robinson, has brought to light another, though much smaller, series of stone rows, pairs and monoliths (Gibbins and Higgins 1988, 64, 66). A row of six stones at Derryinver (L684 611), near Clifden, had already been recorded by Killanin (1953-4, 98-9) who noted a nearby arrangement of three stones which could now be interpreted as the remains of a five-stone circle of Cork/Kerry type. Two of the four newly identified rows are also in the Clifden area. One is a row of four stones (two of quartz) at Crocknaraw (L664 561) and the other a row of three stones, accompanied by a monolith, at Sheeauns (L625 581). Some 15km to the east, in Gleninagh (L815 552), a row of six quartz conglomerates stands beside a kettle-hole, and on the opposite side of the Maumturk Mountains, at Poundcarton (L887 553) in Glenlusk, is a row of four stones, two prostrate, all of quartz. In the same valley and further to the east, in Knockaunbaun, is a pair of stones, again of quartz. [G9]</page><page sequence="18">^v ^ 0&gt; CLIFDEN\?i_ ?_ &gt; SOUTH MUNSTER GROUP ? Ox 3: A. k/*' / a Fig. 5?a. Map of stone circles in Ireland, b. Map of stone rows in Ireland.</page><page sequence="19">? Nuall?in?Stone rows 197 Pairs of stones are more common near Clifden. One with an outlying monolith at Streamstown (L647 535) has been described by Ormsby (1913-14). A pair of quartz stones, uncovered during turf-cutting, stands on the summit of Crocknaraw (L658 557), and there are other possible examples at Attigoddaun (L590 576), Cloonderavon (L667 571) and Sheeauns (L629 584), where an erect stone and a nearby boulder are each of quartz. The inventory for the region must also include a monument at Oorid (L925 450) near Maam Cross. Here, prominently situated on top of a hill and incorporated in a fence, are two uprights and a prostrate stone. The status of these is uncertain though they may represent a pair or a row of three stones. The County Galway rows are quite like the Cork/Kerry series though most are aligned roughly north-south in marked contrast to the standard north-east-south west arrangement of the Munster rows and pairs. The presence of a five-stone circle near the Derryinver row, if verified, would suggest even closer affinities between the two groups. A coastal extension northwards from the Clifden rows seems indicated by the presence of a row of five stones, one prostrate, at Killadangan on the southern shore of Clew Bay (de Valera and ? Nuall?in 1964, 98-9). There are a number of monoliths near this row and a link with the Clifden monuments may be represented by another small group of monoliths near Killadoon on the south-west coast of Mayo. Great Britain An interim map of British stone rows appeared in a recent study of the Dartmoor rows in Devonshire (Emmett 1979, 108) and, as might be expected from the Irish evidence, their distribution is rather similar to that of the stone circles (Burl 1976, 9). The chalklands of the south-east are devoid of examples of either type of monument, while elsewhere land above 300m is generally avoided. The rows are divided into four convenient classes (Emmett 1979, 109). Classes I and II embrace long rows which may be single, double ('avenues') or more complex lines, sometimes associated with barrows, cairns, stone circles or monoliths. These classes include the concentrations on Dartmoor (Emmett 1979) and Exmoor (Grinsell 1970, 189-90), isolated examples in Wales (e.g. Burl 1976, 262) and Cumbria (Burl 1976, 153), and a group in the extreme north-east of Scotland, some of which are complex fan-shaped monuments (RCAHM-S 1911a; 1911b; Mercer 1982-3, 53-7). Class HI consists of 'single, isolated rows, less than ten stones, often widely spaced and over 1.5m high', while the twenty scattered rows constituting class IV, though often associated with cairns, differ from the other types. The 39 British examples of Emmett's class III, to which he assigns the Cork/Kerry rows, extend from Cornwall northwards to the Isle of Lewis in the Hebrides, but the majority are concentrated on the coastal lands of south-west Scotland with an inland extension through Perthshire towards Aberdeen (Fig. 6). Examples akin to the Munster rows are present among the Scottish examples, e.g. Ballochroy, Kintyre (RCAHM-S 1971, 46-7), Ballymeanoch, Mid-Argyll (Morris 1977, 55-6), Achnancarnanan, Islay (RCAHM-S 1984, 63), and Drumgoyach, Stirlingshire (Feacham 1963, 87), but the precise relationship of these and isolated examples elsewhere, e.g. 'Harolds Stones', Trelleck, Gwent (Crawford 1925, 209-10), to the Cork/Kerry series cannot be elucidated without further study. As far as is known there are no examples situated in the immediate vicinity of stone circles.</page><page sequence="20">198 Proceedings of the Royal Irish A cademy Fig. 6?Map of single isolated British rows with less than ten stones, often widely spaced and over 1.5m high (after Emmett 1979, 108-9). Pairs of stones do not seem to be common in Britain and indeed some of the published examples are of widely separated stones which could well be the survivors of longer rows. Examples are found in Cornwall, The Pipers' and The Drift Stones' (Barnatt 1982, 226-7, 232-3), near the Gors Four stone circle in Pembrokeshire (Grimes 1963, 145), at the Lacra complex in Cumberland (Thomas 1976, 71) and in Scotland at Drumcloch, Colonsay (RCAHM-S 1984, 68). A concentration occurs in central Perthshire where the majority of the 26 examples catalogued (Stewart 1966, 140-5) are of stones set apart at distances ranging from 1.5m to 4.4m. Two types are present, those where the long axes of the stones are roughly parallel and others where the stones are set in line, usually along an east-west axis. Some of the latter group may be related to the Cork/ Kerry series and indeed an Irish connection has been suggested on the basis that the weight of the distribution of the Scottish pairs lies to the west (Stewart 1966, 140). A more substantial link between Perthshire and south Munster is indicated by the presence of Four-Poster monuments in both regions (Burl 1976, 191-5; ? Nuall?in 1984b, 63-5). Two of the Perthshire Four-Posters are actually accompanied by pairs of stones (Burl 1976, 202) and while this type of association is not found in Ireland four of the six examples there do have outlying monoliths (? Nuall?in 1984b, 69-71, nos 1, 4, 5 and 6). Another of the Perthshire pairs, at the excavated Croft Moraig site (Piggott and Simpson 1971), stands outside a bank</page><page sequence="21">? Nuall?in?Stone rows 199 encompassing a small stone circle and the excavators have compared their site with that at Lissyviggeen, Co. Kerry (no. 154) (? Nuall?in 1984a, no. 38), where a similar juxtaposition of monuments occurs. These affinities can hardly be fortuitous and despite the great distance involved?some 500miles?recall the morphological similarities between the stone circles of Cork and Kerry and those of Aberdeenshire (? Nuall?in 1975, 115; Burl 1976, 213). Connections between the two regions need not be direct since Burl has pointed out (1976, 213) that the stone circle at Torhouskie, Wigtownshire, and some Four-Posters such as the Four Stones, near Walton in central Wales, could provide intermediate stages. This linkage is reinforced by the recent identification of a Four-Poster at Robinstown Great in the south-east of Ireland (? Nuall?in 1984b, no. 6). Brittany The single standing stones (menhirs), stone rows and megalithic enclosures (cromlechs) which abound in Brittany constitute perhaps the greatest assemblage of free-standing ritual monuments in Atlantic Europe. It has been suggested that the 1000 to 1200 surviving menhirs may indicate an original total of 3000 to 5000 for the Armorican peninsula (Hibbs 1984, 294). Simple and complex stone rows are said to number about one hundred (Giot et al 1979, 413) but many more may have been destroyed. The number of enclosures is uncertain. Some of these stand alone but others, notably those in the Carnac region, are attached to long stone rows. Finds from the foot of menhirs and from stone rows (Giot 1960, 117-18, 125) indicate a span of use which could stretch from middle Neolithic to middle Bronze Age times. Recent excavations at Alignements du Moulin, Ille-et-Vilaine, summarised by Burl (1985, 91-2), show that activity at individual sites may also have taken place over the same long period. It has been suggested that the Breton enclosures may have been the counter parts and perhaps even the progenitors of the British and Irish stone circles (? Nuall?in 1984a, 10). The Breton enclosures take a variety of forms. Oval, near circular, horseshoe and quadrilateral shapes are represented, and in some cases the ring of stones is doubled. All are 50m or more in maximum dimension though some are much larger, e.g. the eastern enclosure at Menee (Burl 1985, 158). The only excavated site is at Er Lannic (Le Rouzic 1930) where the northern ring, apparently of late Neolithic date, has been linked with the larger stone circles of Britain and Ireland (Burl 1976, 130-6). Even closer ties with the monuments of these islands may be indicated by Breton complexes such as Menee and Kerlescan near Carnac (Burl 1985, 155-8, 139-42) and Landaoudec on the Crozon peninsula (Le Pontois 1929, 115-16) where rows and enclosures are conjoined. Similar juxtapositions of rows and stone circles occur in Britain, e.g. Cholwichtown, Devonshire (Eogan 1964), and Callinish, Isle of Lewis (Burl 1976, 148-55), and are a commonplace in mid-Ulster, e.g. Beaghmore, Co. Tyrone (Pilcher 1969), while in south Munster short rows or pairs and circles, though not actually conjoined, sometimes stand within several metres of each other. Apart from the long and often complex stone rows, such as the famous examples near Carnac, there are short, simple monuments in Brittany, some with as few as two or three stones (Hibbs 1984, 294-5). It should be stressed, though, that many rows have been mutilated and it is always possible that particular examples could be the remains of longer rows. Among the few short rows described in the literature is that at Kerfland, in Finist?re (Giot et al 1979, 415; Burl 1985, 60). This row of three tall stones might not be out of place in an Irish</page><page sequence="22">200 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy context but in the absence of a definitive survey of the short Breton rows it would be imprudent to draw further comparisons with the Cork/Kerry series. It can be said, however, that concentrations of short rows and pairs of stones, similar to those of Munster, do not appear to be present in Brittany and that such examples as do exist there must number considerably less than the hundred or so rows of all types estimated for that province. The great numbers of free-standing megalithic monuments in Brittany are matched by similar though smaller assemblages across the sea in Devon and Cornwall (Fox 1964, 55-68; Barnatt 1982) and in the south-west of Ireland (O Nuall?in 1984b, 63). The components of each series differ in some respects, but common to the three regions are concentrations of single standing stones, stone rows of various types and megalithic enclosures?'cromlechs'?in Brittany and stone circles in Britain and Ireland. The occurrence of such complexes must surely be indicative of related traditions, and this view is strengthened by the presence of contiguous or closely associated rows and enclosures in each group. Dating evidence is sparse but present indications are that the free-standing megalithic monuments of the three regions flourished during late Neolithic/early Bronze Age times. Sea routes between Brittany and south-west England and Ireland, established by earlier megalithic tomb-builders, may well have been used by Breton metal prospectors. Thus the discovery of tin in Devon and Cornwall (Fox 1964, 21-4) and copper in south-west Ireland (Jackson 1979, 107-21) and subsequent emigration from Brittany could well account for the concentrations of early Bronze Age free-standing monuments in those maritime regions. Catalogue of sites The catalogue is in four parts: part 1 contains rows with three to six stones, part 2 those represented by two stones, and part 3 pairs of stones which may fall within either of the above categories or be the remains of other types of monuments. Part 4 contains ten additional Cork/Kerry monuments, four rows and six pairs, which were brought to our attention towards the end of the work. In all parts the County Cork sites are followed by those in County Kerry and, in the case of the first part, the Kerry sites are followed by those in the nearby counties arranged alphabetically. The sites are numbered according to the sequence of the Ordnance Survey six-inch sheets and the headings of the descriptions are arranged as follows. The number of the site is followed by the townland name and the number of the Ordnance Survey six-inch sheet. Then comes the map name, if any, as it appears on the latest edition of the six-inch sheet. In cases where the site is not marked, coordinates are given from the western and southern margins of the six-inch sheets. This is followed by the National Grid reference and the height above Ordnance Survey Datum expressed by the values of the contours which lie immediately above and below the sites. The plans were surveyed and drawn at a scale of 1:100 and, with the exception of Fig. 56, are reproduced here at a standard scale of approximately 1:145. The position of true north is indicated by an arrow. The tall stones at Eightercua, near Waterville, Co. Kerry, are omitted from the catalogue. These stand on the perimeter of a demolished stone fort, and since stones of megalithic proportions are sometimes found marking the entrances to ancient enclosures, e.g. Oughtihery, Co. Cork (Fig. 62) (? R?ord?in 1979, 148), their status must remain in doubt. The Eightercua monument has been fully described by P. J. Lynch (1902) and a new plan of the stones is published here (Fig. 62).</page><page sequence="23">i* A?SSNAWLLA KU??&gt; 47. SCARTBAUN 9. GLANTAN? EAST ILJ2L_ 31.

A large oval earthwork lies 27m to the west and we were informed by the landowner that this had been used as a burial place. The two slender stones here stand 3m apart and are inclined slightly towards each other. The stones are remarkably similar to a pair marking the entrance to a large cillin at Oughtihery near Rylane (? R?ord?in 1979, 148) (Fig. 62) and because of this they are excluded from the main list. 166. Trawnamaddree, 105, 'Gallauns' (1902), W019 559, 100-200 Fig. 66 One erect and one fallen stone on pasture-land in the basin of the Owvane River, about 9km north-east of Bantry.

Garryduff, 54, 'Gallan' (1936), W904 854, 500-600 Fig. 34 Three stones on flat pasture-land 3.5km north-north-west of Clonmult village. The site commands an extensive outlook eastwards across rolling arable land. The ground around the stones has been worn away by cattle and small packing-stones are exposed at all three. The stone at the north-east is quite loose and will soon fall. 175. Farranamanagh, 129, 'Gallan' (1901), V825 385, 200-300 Fig. 34 One erect and two prostrate stones on the southern side of the Sheeps Head peninsula about 12.5km south-west of Durrus.

Fermoyle, 88f not shown (1896), 52.7cm, 33.6cm, V 453 724, 100-200, Fig. 35 On gently-sloping pasture above the lowlands of the Derreen River. The site looks northwards across Portmagee Channel to Valencia Island and Doulas Head. The row here seems to have consisted of three stones, two of which survive. According to the landowner the missing stone was removed after a cow was trapped between it and its neighbour. We were unable to establish the actual site of this stone but the landowner's story was confirmed by an elderly local man. Pairs County Cork 177.

One is said to have been struck by lightning and now lies prostrate. An unrecorded monolith stands 150m to the east of this pair. It measures 1.50m by 1 m by 1.80m high and is aligned north-north-east/south-south-w?st. County Kerry 180. Teeromoyle, 70, 'Gallauns' (1895), V 571 823, 400-500 Fig. 51 On sloping pasture-land above the basin of the River Ferta about 10km north east of Caherciveen. The O.S. Memoranda of 1845 records the following description: '. . . a huge standing stone or flag 6ft wide at bottom gradually tapering to a point at top and is 7ft high (ancient) and adjoining it there is a square stone 7ft high (ancient) . . .'. The larger of these stones is missing. The survivor measures 80cm by 50cm and is 2.20m high. Though it is not known how far apart the stones stood, the use of the word 'adjoining' in the O.S. description suggests that the monument is the remains of a standard Cork/Kerry-type pair. 181. Kimego East, 79, not shown (1896), 48.8cm, 52.8cm, V 450 808 Fig. 51 On pasture-land on a hillside overlooking Portmagee Channel about 2.5km north-west of Caherciveen. One stone here lies prostrate. The position of the second is marked by a stump standing 3m to the east. This measures 1.10m by 45cm by 1,45m high. The upper part of this stone lies 1.20m to the south. When intact this stone may have been about 4.90m in height. 182. Canburrin, 80, 'Gallaun' (1896), V 504 773, 300-400 Fig. 50 On pasture-land on a hillside above the basin of the Carhan river. One stone here is in situ but leans heavily to the south-east. The second stone lies beside the first and is partly concealed in the ground.
