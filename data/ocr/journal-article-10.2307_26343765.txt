<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> PERSPECTIVES ON TERRORISM Volume 12, Issue 1 which consists of a crisis of confidence stage, a conflict of legitimacy stage, an upswing in political action (i.e.  violence) stage, and the final stage, the crisis of legitimacy, in which the activists make a complete transfor- mation into violence. This theory is then applied by the author to examine whether and how the eco-militant  organizations and groups followed the Sprinzak trajectory into violence. To examine this thesis, following the  introductory overview, the book discusses the nature and trajectories of groups such as the Animal Liberation  Front, Earth First!, the Earth Liberation Front, and the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society. The author con- cludes that “While time will tell if Sprinzak’s conception of political violence is correct and ecoterrorist groups  will progress to the third ‘crisis of legitimacy’ stage, with the exception of the ALF there appears little evidence  to date that the groups examined, except in isolated instances, have reached that threshold.” (p. 308). He ends  the book on a warning note that if these activists perceive an imminent “global environmental catastrophe or a  perception that the problem of anthropomorphic climate change is not being suitably addressed, and despair- ing of mainstream political solutions, they may choose to adopt violence against fellow humans as a legitimate  tactic.” (p. 308). This book is an important contribution to the literature on eco-terrorism and the application  of radicalization theories to explaining possible trajectories into violence.

Nielsen, Deadly Clerics: Blocked Ambition and the Paths to Jihad (New York, NY: Cambridge Uni- versity Press, 2017), pp., US $ 94.99 [Hardcover], US $ 29.99 [Paperback], ISBN: 978-1-1084-0405-1. This account explores the academic culture of jihadist clerics in general, and the factors that drive them to turn  to such a religiously extremist theology at early points in their careers. To explain their pathway to becoming  leading advocates of extremist violence, the author tests the hypothesis, which is adapted from Ted Robert  Gurr’s notion of “relative deprivation,” that, for clerics turned jihadists, the mechanism of blocked academic  ambition early on in their careers within established Muslim religious institutions plays a major role in their  adopting militant jihadism. As the author writes in the book’s blurb, which well summarizes his argument,  “As long as clerics’ academic ambitions remain attainable, they are unlikely to espouse violent jihad. Clerics  who are forced out of academia are more likely to turn to jihad for two reasons: jihadist ideas are attractive  to those who see the system as turning against them, and preaching a jihad ideology can help these outsider  clerics attract supporters and funds.” To test this hypothesis, the author utilizes evidence from sources such as  large-scale statistical analysis of texts and network data obtained from the Internet, case studies of clerics’ lives,  and ethnographic participant observations at sites in Cairo, Egypt. Despite the book’s excellent application of  qualitative and quantitative methodologies to generate new findings, the author’s thesis can be questioned,  since it ignores the fact that some of the clerics under examination may have been blocked academically due to  their own professional shortcomings and that their turn to jihadist militancy was due to their susceptibility to  be drawn to extremism in the form of such imperialistic ideologies to begin with. The author’s conclusion can  also be questioned as utopian when he writes that a successful counter-radicalization program should be based  on co-opting such extremist-inclined clerics as opposed to arresting and imprisoning them, since it would pro- vide them “with access to better educational networks and, ultimately, the possibility for fulfilling and secure  career prospects.” (p. 177). The book’s appendices include valuable syllabi of instructional materials on jihadi  theology and the methodology used by the author to conduct his empirical research.

This is an important selection of writings by leading anarchist theorists over the past 150 years. As explained  by the volume’s original editor, anarchists believe “in a society in which all individuals can do whatever they  choose, except interfere with the ability of other individuals to do what they choose. This ideal is called anarchy,  from the Greek anarchia, meaning absence of government” (p. 2). Besides this meaning, anarchy “is also used  to mean unsettled government, disorderly government, or government at its crudest in the form of intimida- ISSN  2334-3745 109 February 2018 </page> <page sequence="2"> PERSPECTIVES ON TERRORISM Volume 12, Issue 1 tion by marauding gangs (“military anarchy”)” (p. 3). Anarchism is also associated with terrorism, with the  tactic of terrorism used anarchists, with the editor pointing out that “Only a small minority of terrorists have  ever been anarchists, and only a small minority of anarchists have ever been terrorists” (p. 5). In another im- portant distinction, the editor points out that anarchists include pacifists, advocates of class violence, atheists,  and mystics. The rest of the volume consists of selections by leading anarchists ideologues such as Peter Kro- potkin, Errico Malatesta, Emma Goldman, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon as well as others.  Deepak Tripathi, Breeding Ground: Afghanistan and the Origins of Islamist Terrorism (Washington, DC: Poto- mac Books, Inc., 2011), 256 pp., US $ 26.95 [Hardcover], ISBN: 978-1-5979-7530-8. This book’s objective is to trace the origins of Islamist violence during the Afghan conflict and explore its im- pact on the phenomenon of such terrorism abroad. To examine these issues, the author first discusses three  leading theoretical driving forces behind terrorism in terms of rational choice (e.g., the adoption of violence as  a chosen strategy to achieve a group’s goals), psychological factors (e.g., the choice of violence is rooted in an  individual’s psychological system), and structural factors (e.g., external causes in the environment, such as po- litical, cultural, social, and economic factors are, crucial in driving individuals to embark on terrorist warfare).  Following a discussion of Afghanistan under pro-Soviet rule and its overthrow by the United States-backed  mujahideen, the account shifts into an analysis of the nature of the Taliban, the evolution of the Taliban – Paki- stani ISI alliance, Taliban rule over Afghanistan, and the evolution of al Qaida in Afghanistan. The concluding  chapter discusses how the three theoretical driving forces behind terrorism played out in Afghanistan, with an  insightful observation that all three were not only present, but cumulatively produced a deteriorating society  characterized by a violent culture “in which violence permeates all levels of society and becomes part of human  thinking, behavior, and way of life.” (p. 137). These driving forces need to be understood, the author points out  that “Effective counterterrorism efforts require an understanding of the culture, society, and local conditions,  together with an institutional arrangement that enjoys broad consent in society.” (p. 141). In a prescient obser- vation, the author concludes that “In the absence of a coordinated strategy, the thought of victory in the war  against terror is a triumph of hope over reality.” (p. 141). The book’s appendices include a useful chronology  of the Afghan conflicts from 1978 to 2001 and a bibliographical essay on leading books that cover the Afghan  conflicts.

Charles Webel and Mark Tomass (Eds.), Assessing the War on Terror: Western and Middle Eastern Perspectives  (New York, NY: Routledge, 2017), 308 pp., US $ 155.00 [Hardcover], ISBN: 978-1-1382-0456-0. The contributors to this edited volume examine the effectiveness and ethical basis of the Western governments’  strategies and tactics in the global war on terrorism (GWOT) since 9/11 within the framework of “official  mainstream constructions of ‘terrorists,” ‘terrorism,” and “counterterrorism’ as powerful rhetorical frames used  to sell the GWOT and the justifications for initiating and continuing it.” (p. 1). Within this context, some of  the key questions examined by the volume’s contributors include how  terrorism is defined, how and why  individuals in the West are radicalized, what are effective counterterrorism and antiterrorism strategies, what  have been the “human and financial costs” of the GWOT, is it possible to negotiate with terrorist groups such  as the Taliban, al Qaida, and ISIS,  and how do terrorist groups end. To examine these issues, the volume is  divided into four parts, with each part introduced by a short chapter by Mark Tomass, the co-editor. The  four parts discuss topics such as Part I’s “Framing and Assessing the War on Terror” (including a chapter by  Noam Chomsky on “The Evil Scourge of Terrorism”); Part II’s “Hearing From the Victims of Terror-Inflicted  Regions” (including a chapter by Sher Mohammed Khan on “Winning the Hearts and Minds of the Pashtuns  of Afghanistan and Northwest Pakistan with Altruism, Public Health and Development, Not by Terrorism and  Counterterrorism”); Part III’s “Calculating the Costs of the War on Terror” (including chapters on how ethical  and effective is the GWOT and Laurie Calhoun’s “Terror From Above and Within: The Hidden Cultural and  Political Costs of Lethal Drones”); and Part IV’s “Analyzing, Negotiating With, and Ending Terror Groups”  ISSN  2334-3745 110 February 2018 </page> </plain_text>
