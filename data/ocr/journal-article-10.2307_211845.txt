<plain_text><page sequence="1">GEOGRAPHICAL RECORD NORTH AMERICA A NOTE ON ELEVATED STRANDLINES OF FROBISHER BAY, BAFFIN ISLAND. As a member of the Baird Baffin Island Expedition (see P. D. Baird: Baffin Island Expedition, I950: A Preliminary Report, Arctic, Vol. 3, I950, pp. I3I-I49), the writer traversed Frobisher Bay twice by ship and once by air. Neither there nor in any of the other numerous bays (or, strictly speaking, fiords) along the east coast of Baffin Island, where there are many strandlines, was he convinced that these features necessarily represent sea levels or uplift of the land (cf. Sherman A. Wengerd: Elevated Strandlines of Frobisher Bay, Baffin Island, Canadian Arctic, Geogr. Rev., Vol. 4I, I95I, pp. 622-637). These bays and fiords, which cut through the high east-coast mountains, were probably excavated by large glaciers issuing from a vast icecap that once covered the whole of western Baflin Island and extended westward across Foxe Basin. Indeed, the situation must have been rather like that in Greenland today, with high mountains fringing an icecap which rests on low ground. The mountains probably prevent such a thick mass of ice from spreading plastically and assist its nourishment. The Barnes Ice Cap is possibly the last remnant of the continental ice sheet left on Baflin Island (P. D. Baird and W. H. Ward: The Glaciological Studies of the Baffin Island Expedition, I950,Joiirn. of Glaciology, Vol. 2, I952, pp. 2-23). When the icecap waned and the fiords were no longer charged with its ice, the high- land ice of the east-coast mountains, still high enough to be nourished, seems to have taken control of the water levels in the fiords. There is evidence in at least a few places that glaciers from the highland ice spread across the fiords, damming up their inner waters and giving rise to strandlines. It is worthy of note that the glaciers from the Grin- nell ice, which enter Frobisher Bay, have retreated noticeably in historic times. H. Mulli (Erkundungsfahrt nach Norden, Berge der Welt, Vol. 6, I95I, pp. II9-I30) has described one fiord, Stewart Valley, north of Clyde Post, where even today the fiord is dammed into two lakes by two glaciers, and where advances and retreats of the glacial tongues have produced several fiord strandlines. In near-by fiords submerged terminal moraines in front of partly blocking glaciers suggest that similar situations may have existed at one time. With local retreats and advances of these lateral damming glaciers, it is, moreover, not inconceivable that sea water has been let into the inner parts of the fiords and sub- sequently elevated (at least to moderate altitudes) by a glacier advance and summer melt- water, without any change in sea level. It would be interesting to know whether this possibility has been considered as an alternative explanation for some of the strandlines in Frobisher Bay and, indeed, in other countries where similar conditions are possible.- W. H. WARD GLACIER FLUCTUATION IN BRITISH COLUMBIA. During the past quarter of a century steady progress has been made in the unraveling of late-glacial and postglacial history through a study of glacier fluctuations, birth and death of lakes, permutations of vegetation, and, most elusive of all but fundamental, climatic change. For all but the last</page><page sequence="2">652 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW there is tangible evidence; our knowledge of climatic change rests upon inferences drawn largely from the fields noted above and from changes in sea level, dunes, river terraces, growth of deltas, volcanic horizons, and the geothermic gradient. Individual contributions, whatever the field, are necessarily local in scope, and the more numerous and widely distributed they are, the surer are inferences based on them. It is now a fairly safe assump- tion that during the periods so far studied the major climatic trends have been world- wide, and no source of evidence for this has been more satisfying than the records of glacier changes that have been worked out in many parts of the world. W. H. Mathews, in a recent field study in southern British Columbia, has added another to the list of case histories (Historic and Prehistoric Fluctuations of Alpine Glaciers in the Mount Garibaldi Map-Area, Southwestern British Columbia,Journ. of Geol., Vol. 59, I95I, pp. 357-380). The area investigated is moderate in altitude (highest peak 8787 feet) and with a moderate development of alpine glaciers. During the last climax of continental glaciation the area was buried beneath the ice of the Cordilleran sheet to an altitude greater than 7200 feet. The general direction of movement was a few degrees west of south. The highest summits probably projected and acted as centers from which ice flowed radially, merging into that of the main sheet. An unusual feature of late Pleistocene time was extruding lava in actual contact with the ice. Two such flows seem to have been ponded against glacier margins to a depth of at least 8oo feet. In recounting the glacial history the author works backward. Recession from a forest trim line marking a very recent ice maximum is evident here, as it is almost everywhere else in the glaciated mountains of northwestern North America. The latest maximum is believed, from tree-ring counts and comparisons in the "barren zone" and the adjoining mature forest, to have occurred about i 86o. Evidence from two glaciers strongly suggests an earlier maximum at some time during the first half of the eighteenth century. Mathews' work adds new evidence to the large amount already accumulated on the "xerothermic period," "thermal maximum," or "climatic optimum." (Can we not consign to oblivion the last, absurdly anthropomorphic expression and devise an appel- lation that is truly descriptive and strictly objective?) Various dates and durations have been assigned to this phase of postglacial time. Mathews, from his own work and that of others within the region covered by the Cordilleran ice sheet, offers the following historic sequence. During the period of general deglaciation alpine glaciers, contrary to the com- mon assumption, were of little importance; after the disappearance of the main masses, in which stagnation played an important role, they remained as local tongues or complexes in a state of severe contraction. Intensity of glaciation comparable to that of the present was reattained not more than four centuries ago. Here the author's own concrete evidence is slender, but where evidence of any sort is scarce each bit must be used and weighed. A delta is being built by a meltwater stream in a small lake that has been in existence since the disappearance of the Cordilleran ice. The topography is such that meltwater flow in this direction is possible only while the contributing glacier is expanded beyond a certain limit. Measurement of delta growth during the period I928-I947 indicates that about four centuries have sufficed for its construction. Mathews' conclusions are best given in his own words: "That Helm Glacier was more extensive than in I947 for a century or two after the disappearance of Cordilleran ice is not inconceivable; but a single period, of about four centuries' duration, culminating in the climaxes of the early I700's and mid-</page><page sequence="3">GEOGRAPHICAL RECORD 653 I800's, seems more reasonable. This recent advanced condition, stemming apparently from widespread climatic conditions, was almost certainly shared for a comparable period of time by the other glaciers of the map-area." The date, four centuries ago, is of course important for Helm Glacier alone; the cooling-off trend that followed the thermal maximum probably began many centuries before. Extreme glacial contraction and the climatic moderation that caused it thus came early. It follows that the postglacial phase of comparatively high temperatures and small- ness of glaciers must have covered much, perhaps most, of postglacial time. The cooling off, with consequent re-expansion of glaciers, at a rate unknown, reached its climax during the last few centuries.-WILLIAM S. COOPER HAIL IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES. The problem of hail has been given considerable attention by geographers, Weather Bureau meteorologists, agronomists, hail-insurance investigators, and others, generally with a view to better understanding of hail incidence and of crop and property damage. More recently, however, commercial- airline meteorologists have studied the problem with a different objective in mind- airline operations. In a recent article H. T. Harrison and W. B. Beckwith of United Airlines (Studies on the Distribution and Forecasting of Hail in Western United States, Bull. Amner. Meteorol. Soc., Vol. 32, I95I, PP. II9-I3I) attempt to shed more light on the distribution and frequency of hailstorms of all types and to investigate forecasting possi- bilities in greater detail. Included is a study of hail in the Denver area during the I949 hail season (May through September), carried out by use of special observing stations and by detailed synoptic analysis of weather maps for all days on which hail occurred. These data were supplemented by hail damage statistics from four transcontinental airlines and by data on hail crop damage insurance rates from all counties of Is states in the Great Plains and adjacent areas. Unfortunately, the study resulted in few new findings on the geographical distri- bution of hail. No conclusion is reached on the lack of coincidence of maximum hail and thunderstorm'frequencies, though it was found that the western Great Plains and the east- ern slopes of the Rockies "have the highest hail-thunderstorm ratio in the country." The authors conclude that "point frequency of hail over Western United States is of little value in determining relative exposures to hail" and that "frequency of hail in a metropolitan area such as Denver is at least ten times as great as random point frequency within that area." Partly contradicting this, however, is the statement that "over level country [i.e. the Great Plains] the spot data will normally be fairly representative." Rates on hail crop insurance in the Great Plains and adjacent states were found to range from I 5 per cent of insured risk in the western plains to 2 per cent in the Missouri Valley; hence it would seem that actual hail evidence is several times greater in the former than in the latter. This has been borne out by other studies, such as those by the present writer (Hail as a Factor in the Regional Climatology of the United States, Geogr. Rev., Vol. 32, I942, PP. 47I-475; Hail in American Agriculture, Econ. Geogr., Vol. i8, I942, PP. 363-378). However, as these studies indicate, a high degree of crop risk does not neces- sarily coincide with a high hail frequency. Risk is based on many factors, such as type of crops, susceptibility of crops to hail, damage at different stages of growth, type of weather following hailstorms (as related to crop revival), northward migration of the hail belt</page><page sequence="4">654 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW as related to crop growth and harvest dates, sizes of hailstorms and hailstones, and amount of wind accompanying the storms. It may well be therefore that a combination of these factors is just as important in producing high hail risk as is high hail incidence. Both airline and insurance experience indicates that the maximum exposure of aircraft to hail damage in flight occurs in an area some 500 miles wide extending from Texas to Canada; the time of maximum exposure is early spring in the south and late spring and early summer for the middle and northern routes. This could have been pre- dicted: the hail-thunderstorm ratio is higher in this belt than anywhere else in the country. An analysis of diurnal variation (Hoyt Lemons: Semimonthly Distribution of Hail in the United States, Monthly Weather Rev., Vol. 7I, I943, pp. II5-I22) points to an earlier hour of maximum frequency at Denver (I2:30 p. m. to 3:30 p. m.) than previously reported for the western United States (4:30 p. m. to 5:30 p. m.). Hail is predominantly a post-cold-front phenomenon and probably occurs to some extent with all thunder- storms during their growth stage in the Denver area. Only hailstones of an inch or more in diameter are dangerous to aircraft. Despite careful analyses of weather maps for days with hail, attempts to correlate hail occurrence with frontal condition, height of its freezing level, lapse rates, and other phenomena give little promise of techniques for predicting hail on the ground or aloft from aircraft in flight. Thus "the outlook is . .. discouraging for the airway and terminal forecaster. . . The burden of responsibility in avoiding damaging hail rests largely on the pilot himself." "Airborne radar storm detection equipment offers the greatest hope of avoiding damaging hail in flight."-HoYT LEMONS EUROPE LOST VILLAGES AND OPEN FIELDS IN ENGLAND. Economic historians in England have been giving increasing attention to the material remains of former periods. Their studies have been particularly fruitful in the sphere of medieval settlement and agriculture. In I938 the Orwins (C. S. and C. S. Orwin: The Open Fields [Oxford, I938]) drew attention to the need for a practical study of the medieval plow and its behavior in different types of soil, explaining that the open-field system, with its intermixed strips, owed as much to the geography and technology of the Middle Ages as to the legal and social institutions of the Anglo-Saxons. In a series of articles M. W. Beresford has shed much light on the agricultural systems of medieval England. We have long been familiar with the sixteenth-century estate maps on which the open-field strips are distinguished. Beresford points out (Ridge and Furrow and the Open Fields, Econ. Hist. Rev., Ser. 2, Vol. I, I948, pp. 34-45) that this is not the only evidence of the former existence of strip cultivation; in many parts of England the fields have faint, regular undulations-ridges and depressions or furrows, closely spaced and straight or slightly curved. "The ridge-and-furrow pattern visible in many Midland fields, and elsewhere, is in fact the pattern of the strips of the open field, fossilized as it were, and unobliterated by the newer alignment of hedges or by the ploughing demands of three wars." The study of air photographs and careful field mapping of the strips have made possible the reconstruction of the medieval field system of many villages. At the same time fields have been revealed that depend on no existing village. Faint undulations have been</page><page sequence="5">GEOGRAPHICAL RECORD 655 discovered that belonged to villages now lost (M. W. Beresford: Maps and the Medieval Landscape, Antiqtuity, Vol. 24, 1950, pp. II4-II8). The disappearance of whole villages during the agrarian revolution of the sixteenth century has been confirmed by contemporary documents. A commission of Henry VIII, dated I 5I7, lamented that large estates were being sown to grass and given over to sheep or deer, "whereby the ... towns, hamlets and places are not only brought to desolation, but also the houses and buildings of the same are brought to so great ruin, that no vestige of the same at the present is left" (Patent Roll, 9 Henry VIII, quoted in A. E. Bland, P. A. Brown, and R. H. Tawney: English Economic History: Select Documents [London, 1930], pp. 262-264). Vestiges have nevertheless remained, to be discovered by Mr. Beresford and other historians of rural England. In another article (The Lost Villages of Medieval England, Geogr. Joulri;., Vol. I17, 195I, PP. I29-149), summarizing present knowledge of the "lost villages," Mr. Beresford lists the clues he followed in the search: records of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries; documentary evidence of the former payment of poll tax from areas now depopulated and uncultivated; the existence of a medieval church or parish without a village; local legends and field names; and, above all, the study of the soil, with or without maps and air photographs. It is too early to attempt an estimate of the total number of lost villages, but I46 have been counted in Lincolnshire alone. The landscape of parts of England underwent a profound change during the enclosure movement. First-class agricultural land remained under the plow, and its villages continued to be populous. Low-grade land was already under pasture. But the marginal lands of intermediate quality, in the Wolds and the "grassy shires" of the Midlands, experienced the greatest change. Here the "find" of lost villages is largest, and here, under the grass sward, there survives in greatest abundance the ridge- and-furrow abandoned by the medieval plowman when he was driven from his land by an enclosing landlord. A warning has recently been given by E. Kerridge against a too ready acceptance of Beresford's equation of present ridge-and-furrow with medieval open fields (Ridge and Furrow and Agrarian History, Econ. Hist. Rev., Ser. 2, Vol. 4, I95I, pp. I4-36). Much of the ridge-and-furrow, Kerridge claims, is attributable to the modern plowman of the golden age of English farming and to the need for soil drainage. "Most of the ridge and furrow to be seen in the English countryside today is the result of fairly recent ploughing, not so much medieval as nineteenth century, and mostly in enclosures." No doubt Beres- ford exaggerates and weakens his case by his emphatic attribution of all ridge-and-furrow to the medieval open fields, but against the equally extreme view of Kerridge many a lost village surrounded by its strips lies in silent protest.-NORMAN J. G. POUNDS YIELD OF CEREALS IN FINLAND AND THE RECENT CLIMATIC FLUCTU- ATION. A positive correlation between crop yields and temperature trends in Finland has been established as a result of analysis of grain yields (Ilmari Hustich: Yield of Cereals in Finland and the Recent Climatic Fluctuation, Fetnnia, Vol. 73, No. 3, I950-I95I, pp. 1-32). The cereals analyzed are rye, barley, and oats since i86i, and wheat since I877; greatest reliability of statistics is for the period I92I to I939. The positive trend in crop yields during the twenties and thirties paralleled a rise in average temperatures, most decided for August-September, but definite also for June-July.</page><page sequence="6">656 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW Improved methods of cultivation, greater availability of tractors, the use of improved varieties of field crops, and the increasing use of commercial fertilizer all played a part in accounting for the significant increases in yields from I92I to I939. However, the positive temperature trend during that period is regarded as of primary importance in explaining the positive yield trend. The moderate decreases in yields since I940, which occurred simultaneously with the difficult war and postwar conditions, also corresponded to slight downward trends in temperatures. Yield increases have been especially pronounced in the northern crop-producing areas of Finland, where high yields are dependent on positive temperature trends to a higher degree than in the southern areas. Temperature-yield correlations of rye and barley show "r" values of o.66 ? o.og for the northern province of Oulu, as compared with 0.44 ? o.ii for the southern province of Nyland. For barley and potatoes, the contrast between north and south is even more indicative: o.8i ? 0.05 for Oulu, compared with 0.I7 ? 0.I4 for Nyland. One reason for the high correlation in the north is the long day, which allows an extended assimilation time. Thus, when the summer temperature is favorable, a larger production of assimilates occurs in a short growth season. On the other hand, in years of low growing-season temperatures the situation is reversed, and yields are correspondingly low. Temperature becomes the main limiting factor to crop production. Yields are more stable, seasonal variability is less, in the southern crop-producing areas of Finland than in the northern. To use Hustich's terminology, the "hazard coeffi- cients" increase from south to north. This is pointed out not only for seasonal yields of crops but also in the radial growth series for spruce. The coefficient of variability for the period i886-i936 was I2 per cent for southern Finland, as compared with i8 per cent for northern Finland. Corresponding figures for pine were I8 and 23 per cent. In a study of the yields of field crops in the states of the Mississippi Valley, variability was shown to increase from east to west, with the approach of the dry plains (K. HI. W. Klages: Geographical Distribution of Variability in the Yields of Field Crops in the States of the Mississippi Valley, Ecology, Vol. II, I930, pp. 293-306). In other words, in the Mississippi Valley study lack of moisture, or seasonal deviation in the availability of moisture, was found to be the chief climatic factor in yield variations, whereas in Hustich's study of Finland variability is shown to increase from south to north, and growing- season temperatures are found to be the primary limiting factor to crop production.- K. H. W. KLAGES THE BASIS OF UNDERDEVELOPMENT IN SARDINIA. In sharp contrast with the rest of Italy, Sardinia's chief obstacle to economic development and prosperity has been underpopulation. The early development of Sardinia is recounted in a study by Mario Pinna of the Sinis Peninsula, on the central west coast (La penisola del Sinis, Contribluti alla Geografia della Sardegna [Section I], Istituto di Geografia, Universita degli Studi di Cagliari, Sassari, I95 I). Pinna traces the stages of development from the nuraghi, the mas- sive fortified dwellings built in the Bronze Age, to the occupation first by the Phoenicians, then by the Carthaginians, and finally by the Romans. Peace, security, and the develop- ment of maritime trade came under Roman protection and provided the island with a long period of prosperity.</page><page sequence="7">GEOGRAPHICAL RECORD 657 But with the fall of the Roman Empire, the fortunes of Sardinia changed. Beginning in the early Middle Ages, and continuing for many centuries, pirates invaded the island repeatedly, though they never gained a permanent foothold. In the struggle many people were massacred and others fled into the interior, leaving the coasts and lowlands virtually uninhabited. The low, swampy coastal plain was a natural breeding ground for the anophe- les mosquito, and the consequent prevalence of malaria not only drove people away from the coastal plain but also retarded resettlement in times of peace. Repeated decimation of the population through famine and epidemics was another factor in Sardinia's lack of development. Angela Asole (Variazioni di popolazione nella Barbagia di Ollolai, ibid. [Section 11], I95I) notes that in i68o one-third of the population of Sardinia perished as the result of a crop failure and that in the years i854 to I856 a cholera epidemic took a high toll. Toward the end of the nineteenth century, Sardinians began to emigrate to America in order to escape the continuous hardships. Although these emigrants contributed financially to their homeland, the loss of labor was a serious setback in the growth of the island's economy. Though all these factors combined to keep the total population low, the early necessity for abandoning the lowlands created seemingly anomalous population densities in various parts of Sardinia. Today 86 per cent of the population are settled between 2ooo and 3300 feet, and the coast and lowlands, the most fertile parts of the island, are uninhabited or insufficiently developed. Within the last century there has been a return movement toward lower elevations and the coast, but it has been too gradual to be of benefit yet. The problem of coastal settlement, principally in connection with fishing, is dis- cussed by Alberto Mori (La Pesca Marritima in Sardegna, [Istituto di Geografia, Universita degli Studi di Cagliari, Sassari, T950]). Though fish abound in Sardinian waters, sea fishing has not been profitable. On the one hand, the coastal population, sparse and impoverished, lacks capital for improvement of fishing boats and equipment; on the other hand, there has been a reckless exploitation of fish in the banks around the island by both resident and migrant fishermen. Since the eighteenth century, fishermen from the Italian mainland, particularly from the Ligurian coast and the Naples area, and also some from Spain, have come to settle along the Sardinian west coast; indeed, they represent the main element of population there. The most recent addition of fishermen is the group which immigrated with their families from the Istrian Peninsula when that part of Italy was incorporated into Yugoslavia after World War II. Tunnies, anchovies, sardines, and lob- sters are the chief fish caught. Lobster fishing, which began with the decline of coral fishing toward the end of the nineteenth century, has become one of the most important commercial activities because of the demand in Continental markets such as Rome, Naples, and Marseilles. Other problems of Sardinia resulting in large measure from the depopulation are discussed by Gavino Alivna (II problema demografico-economico della Sardegna Centro- Settentrionale [Rotary Internazionale, 870 Distretto, Sassari, I951]), who points out that as compared with analogous Mediterranean areas, Sardinia has proportionately more pastureland and less cultivated land. Much of the fertile lowlands and lower slopes, extensive and accessible, has remained in pasture despite the fact that crops such as wheat and other grains, grapes, olives, and cork would bring high yields. The cultivated areas</page><page sequence="8">658 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW are at higher elevations where the greatest density of rural settlement occurs. There crops are grown in the vicinity of villages, regardless of whether or not soils and slopes are suitable for cultivation; yields are therefore low. The island also has considerable wealth in mineral resources-principally lead, zinc, iron, manganese, and coal-but at present mines are in operation only in the southwest and southeast. Drastic but well-planned reforms are needed to better the economic plight of Sardinia. Because inland connections as well as those with the mainland are insufficient for the expansion envisaged, improvements in transportation and communication are a prime requisite. The fishing industry would benefit from a threefold program: planned settle- ments of fishermen, assistance in modernizing boats and equipment, and conservation laws to prohibit the use of explosives and to restrict exploitation. It has been estimated that the island could support more than twice its present population of three million. Experienced farmers from the overpopulated Italian mainland should be induced to settle on the potentially fertile but now underpopulated lowlands. Pasture must be decreased, and field and tree crops increased. Little has been done to utilize water resources for irri- gation and generation of hydroelectric power, though, according to Alivia, some 250,000 acres could be put under cultivation if irrigated. Mining could be expanded to include mineral deposits in the northwest and the excellent building stone in the north-central area. In the existing mines methods and management need improvement. Widespread immi- gration would increase both the labor pool and the demand for manufactured products. Existing industries-canning, metallurgical, chemical, and miscellaneous manufacturing -would thus expand along with the development of new ones, stimulating both domestic trade and trade with the mainland. Lastly, Sardinia would do well to develop a profitable tourist industry, based on its scenic attractions of mountains and sea, and on its historical monuments and sites.-GUIDo G. WEIGEND AFRICA SOCIAL PROBLEMS IN THE GOLD COAST. The technology and material goods of Europe and America have been quickly accepted in West Africa, along with a large part of the administrative machinery imposed from without. But ideas and social institutions have not been received with the same assimilative zeal. Elements of the traditional culture and social organization persist side by side with Western ideas and values. Conflicts in culture values have arisen between patrilineal and matrilineal inheritance, Christianity and local religions, individualism and traditional family obligations, and elective municipal government and tribal loyalties. A considerable insight into social problems of the growing Europeanized urban centers of West Africa may be found in a survey of social conditions in the main port of the Gold Coast by K. A. Busia (Report on a Social Survey of Sekondi-Takoradi [London, I950]). Size alone does not make a city Westernized: Ibadan has had a population of nearly half a million for more than a century. Nor is racial composition the dominant factor. At the time of Busia's study, Sekondi-Takoradi had a non-African population of only 807 (mostly British, but with some Syrians, Lebanese, Swiss, and others) in a total of 44,130. Functionally, Sekondi-Takoradi is organized along European lines. The municipality owes its growth and importance to three interrelated developments: gold mining, the railway, and Takoradi Harbor. The Gold Coast census recognizes 62 tribal divisions for</page><page sequence="9">GEOGRAPHICAL RECORD 659 the whole country, and every one is represented in the twin towns. This heterogeneity, coupled with the towns' functions, has been basic to their Europeanization. Sekondi-Takoradi has long been a social sore spot in the Gold Coast, with juvenile delinquency a particularly sensitive symptom. A study of 34 general cases from the local juvenile court showed that 24 offenders had been to school, but only two of them had gone beyond Standard III-or about the fifth grade. Twenty-five described themselves as Christians, four as Muslims, and five as pagans. Only six came from the local Ahanta tribe; five came from as far away as Nigeria. Half of the cases involved stealing, but in a majority the crime charged was relatively insignificant; many children were brought into court as "care and protection cases" -an indication of the disintegration of the family structure. Among the causes for delinquency were separation of parents (but rarely ending in formal divorce); the husband having to work such hours as to miss seeing his family; repudiation of family responsibility (a phenomenon virtually unknown in African villages); and other breakdowns in the system of extended family relationships. Some of the boys had come so far that no relative could be found. One weak point in the assimi- lative process from African village to European city is the shift from matrilineal inheritance -with consequent derivation of one's civil, jural, and property rights in society through one's maternal kinsmen-to the common Western concept of the role of the father in relation to his offspring.-EDWIN S. MUNGER WORLD AS A WHOLE AND LARGER PARTS SOVIET ECONOMIC PROSPECTS. With the objective of evaluating Soviet economic potentials by 1970, three dozen American economists specializing in Soviet economics met at Columbia University's Arden House, May 23-25, I952, under the sponsorship of the Joint Committee on Slavic Studies of the Social Science Research Council and the American Council of Learned Societies. Two geographers were included, Chauncy D. Harris and George B. Cressey. The conference made no attempt to prepare conclusions, and the following comments represent individual judgments only. The gross national production of the U.S.S.R. during the I930's was about equal to that of the United States during the latter half of the nineteenth century. More impor- tant, the current Soviet gross national production is increasing at the rate of 6.5 to 7 per cent a year, as compared with 2.0 to 2.5 per cent in the United States. However, this phenomenal rate of expansion of Soviet industry will probably slacken by 1970, owing to the decreasing supply of labor that can be released from the farm, the declining techno- logical advantage previously enjoyed by the U.S.S.R. as a backward state able to copy techniques from the West, and the lack of adequate capital. It is estimated that in I939 Soviet industrial labor was 40 per cent as productive as American labor, and that by I970 Soviet productivity per worker may reach 49 to 65 per cent of labor productivity in the United States. About 20 per cent of the national income is currently devoted to military requirements, but military production in I952 is far below the peak reached during World War II. Although by American standards the Soviet Union is backward, its efficiency is comparable with that of some European countries; further, it is graduating 5o,ooo engineers a year. To underestimate the country's potential would be a fatal blunder.</page><page sequence="10">66o THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW Although Soviet mineral reserves are large, there are serious problems. It is estimated that high-grade Krivoi Rog iron ore will largely be gone by I970; Magnitogorsk ore is of increasingly poor quality, and the high-grade ore will probably be exhausted by I975. Coking coal presents a growing difficulty. Coal is hauled long distances, and an average of 20 per cent of the power is used for transport. Many of the thicker coal seams in the Donets Basin have been mined out, so that by I970, according to one estimate, the average thickness will diminish from I.O to o.6 meter. On the agricultural side, Soviet food output must match or exceed the projected increase in population. It is thought that only the present farm labor force will be avail- able, since all population increase to I970 is likely to be assigned to industry. With a 2 per cent annual increase in agricultural productivity and a I.5 per cent increase in popu- lation, the farms could release five million workers to factories by I970. Additional labor can be made available only through excessive capital investment. Several of the countries recently added to the Soviet orbit are deficit areas, which the Union will be obliged to support. The over-all objective withinN the satellites is an inte- grated economy from Vladivostok to Prague, with the same blueprints, machinery, railroad gauge, and engineering standards. This will require time, and the prospects for strength are only modest. Stories told outside the conference sessions illustrate the way in which one may infer conditions within the U.S.S.R. The Soviet press has recently given much publicity to a newly completed highway from Moscow to Simferopol, with conspicuous attention to the fact that gasoline stations are available every 200 kilometers. The papers have carried a detailed account of a motor trip made by one family. For 30 or 40 kilometers before reaching the first station, the conversation centered on whether there would be any gasoline available. The station was taken for granted, but the relief was great when the attendant actually reported a supply. Other stories on newly established gasoline stations add that "hereafter trucks will not need to carry supplies for the round trip." Apropos of the fact that passenger cars arn gradually becoming available for private individuals, one writer to the editor ccmments that now one can spend Sunday in the country, but that it is necessary to waste all morning getting the car to run. "Wouldn't it be a good idea to establish a few garages to repair cars, say one in each large city?" Black-market operations continue, to such an extent that it is profitable for air travelers to bring oranges to Mos- cow from the Crimea and the Ukraine and sell the fruit for enough to pay the cost of their plane fare.-GEORGE B. CRESSEY ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY PORTS: THEIR HINTERLANDS AND "FORELANDS." It has been aptly said by G. H. J. Daysh that "while port geography has not been entirely neglected, it has received but sporadic attention by geographers" (Preliminary Report of the Commission on In- dustrial Ports: Introduction, Tijdschr. voor Econ. en Sociale Geogr., Vol. 42, I95I, pp. 345-346). This statement becomes all the more evident when attention is turned to the concept of interrelationship between the port, its hinterland, and what might be termed its "foreland." The existence of such an interrelationship is not disputed. The character and growth of a port play a substantial role in the development and prosperity of the hinterland, and, conversely, a hinterland will provide stimuli to port activity and port</page><page sequence="11">GEOGRAPHICAL RECORD 66i industry. Both in turn are intimately connected with maritime factors. Thus, in terms of the present economic picture, changes in the ocean trade and transportation patterns resulting from World War II and postwar conflicts have made formerly well-established trading areas inaccessible, while, simultaneously, new horizons have opened up. Demands and production within certain trade orbits, inclusive of port hinterland areas, have changed as a result of political doctrine, economic necessity, or social pressures. These changes are closely tied in with the fluctuation in the functional emphasis and mean- ing of ports that has affected not only the economic prosperity of each immediate port area but also the port's relationship to the hinterland and the stability of the hinterland in either a positive or a negative way. The concept of port-hinterland relationships is extremely variable and has been interpreted and analyzed in divergent ways. W. E. Boerman, in the report cited above (The Need for Special Examination of Particular Aspects of Port Geography, ibid., pp. 347-349), suggests that "it is the hinterland combined with transport links, that gives the key to growth of port trade and development of port industries. No port structure can be understood when not seen together with its 'hinterland.' " A different approach has been taken by French authors in the periodical Revue de "La Porte Oceane." In "La notion d'arriere-pays en economie portuaire" (Vol. 6, No. 68, December, I950) A. Vigarie maintains that the concept of the hinterland has become vague and obscure in modern times because of increasingly significant relationships evolving between the port and its maritime connections. This idea is carried further in a series of articles by Marcel Amphoux, the principal spokesman on the problem in the Revue. He too stresses the preponderant influence of the sea on port development, remarking that people commonly think of the port as their window to the sea (Cadre geographique et fonctions portuaires, Vol. 6, No. 65, September, I950). This attitude in itself over- emphasizes the importance of the hinterland. Actually, he argues, the port is more signi- ficant as a window from the sea to the land. To illustrate his theory that sea connections are much more necessary to port development than land connections, he cites Marseilles, which can be classified among the world's greatest ports even though it has no hinterland and its connections with the interior are poor. With the opening of the Suez Canal, the conquest of Algeria, and the establishment of the colonial empire, Marseilles found itself in an ideal location to become the empire port. It created strong maritime ties but at the same time performed a national function, the influence of which extends throughout the country. Dunkirk, on the other hand, with a rich and well-developed hinterland, suffered greatly because of its less well-established ties with the outside, in combination with un- favorable physical factors, such as depth and accessibility. In another article (Geographie portuaire et economie portuaire, Vol. 7, No. 70, February, I95I), M. Amphoux maintains that the hinterland emerges as an important factor only in the transportation of bulk products in tramps. Because of the heavy and expensive land transport required by such cargoes, the choice of a port of entry depends on the nearness of the market and the ease and cheapness of land transportation. Mer- chandise shipped on regularly scheduled liners depends not so much on land transportation as on factors such as maritime routes and port facilities and services. Tramp shipping has been declining in importance, while it has become more and more customary to utilize regular maritime routes; at the same time the size of merchant ships has constantly in-</page><page sequence="12">662 THE GEOGRAPHICAL REVIEW creased, with the result that there has been an increasingly greater concentration of ship- ping in fewer and larger ports. Consequently, the significance of the hinterland in relation to the port has, in Amphoux's opinion, rapidly declined. Thus, in a port study, according to Amphoux, the hinterland will be found to have a definitely secondary role because of its restricted relationship to the port. The pre- ponderant influence comes from such outside forces as the convergence of major maritime routes on the port, frequency of calls by vessels, possibility and readiness of maritime connections, accessibility of the port, availability of port facilities and services, speed of turnaround, financial resources for, and interest in, overseas investment, and the like. All interact to influence the choice of the port and therefore its greatness.-GUIDO G. WEIGEND GEOGRAPHICAL NEWS MEDINA CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION. The hundredth anniversary of the birth ofJose Toribio Medina (I852-I930), the well-known Chilean scholar, will be celebrated November 6-8, I952, in Washington, D. C., at the Medina Centennial Celebration, organized by the Pan American Union. A symposium of papers devoted to Medina's contributions to Americanist studies will be read, and the celebration will also be marked by the visit to the United States of the Chilean historian Guillermo Feliu Cruz. Sr. Cruz will deliver the principal address at the inaugural ceremony. The American Geographical Society is among the 27 organizations sponsoring the Medina Centennial. Although primarily known as a bibliographer and historian, the Chilean scholar also contributed widely to the fields of geography, cartography, pale- ography, numismatics, anthropology, natural history, literary criticism, philology, and linguistics. The symposium on his work will be held alternately in the Pan American Union's Hall of the Americas and the Library of Congress's Coolidge Auditorium. The proceedings of the celebration will be published.-D.L.W. MEETINGS AND EVENTS. The summer of I952 has been an unusually stimulating one for geographers, offering several meetings and events of extraordinary interest. Among these were the Third Pan American Consultation on Geography, held in Washington, D. C., fromJuly 25 to August 4; the centennial celebrations of the American Geographical Society on August 4, 5, and 6 in New York; the joint annual meetings of the Association of American Geographers and the National Council of Geography Teachers in Wash- ington on August 6 and 7; and finally, in culmination, the Seventeenth International Geographical Congress, also in Washington, from August 8 to I 5. A more detailed report on all these events will appear in the next issue of the Geographical Review.</page></plain_text>
