The au- thor worked as a Catholic priest in Japan for twenty years, during which he experienced Zen through dialogue and through contacts with Zen "rosh." His message is that Christian- ity can use the techniques of Zen for the renewal of meditation. He emphasizes the tech-</page><page sequence="2">676 JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF RELIGION niques of Zen, namely: (a) wordless and imageless meditation; (b) the recitation of Christian words and phrase, and the thinking of nothing as super-thinking; (c) bodily positions; (d) rhythmical breath and mind control during meditation; (e) prayer (medita- tion) by the guru or rosh, not only for individuals but also for the community; and (f) Koan, the solving of practical problems not through logic but through transcendent intui- tion. He also recommends the physical environment of Zen to Christianity, e.g., medita- tion halls which would be pervaded with "scripture and liturgy and the atmosphere of faith." Johnston claims that the dualistic Christian West needs some of the monism of Zen. He says that the dualistic concept of God who is "there" and not "here" can lead to the "God-is-dead" atheism of our time. For Johnston, a full Christian experience must accept both dualism and monism, for which the mystic East can provide much insight. The void, the emptiness of Zen, is precisely the place to find Christ, according to John- ston. He finds the mystery of Christianity, illustrated in passages from the Gospels, to be equivalent to the void of Zen. The objective of Christian Zen, of course, is enlightenment. Johnston lists three levels of enlightenment which can result from the addition of Zen meditation to Christianity. The first is a basic sort that is universal and is typified by the revelation which might result from reading Plato. Second is a specifically Judeo-Christian experience such as that of Paul on the road to Damascus. And third is that of conversion or "metanoia" - the central religious experience of the gospel. It is not surprising that Johnston shows more interest in the growing Pentecostal movement in the Catholic church than on the political activism movement. The absence of conceptualization in Zen recalled for Johnston the mysticism of such Christians as Eckhart and provided a new guide for Christians in the art of prayer. John- ston applies Zen techniques to Christianity with no sacrifice of Christian aspects. How- ever, the fundamental problem of traditional Zen's having no center, except oneself, whereas Christian Zen is called upon to be Christ-centered, i.e., "other-power" rather than "self- power" oriented, is not fully resolved in this book. Johnston's monistic approach to Christianity seems to have been much influenced by Suzuki's argument for a monistic concept of the Christian God. He also appears to have been influenced by Morton's contention that Christianity was historically monistic, by Tillich's "ground of being," and by the rejection of an anthropomorphic concept of God by such authors as J. A. T. Robinson. Johnston's argument for a monistic view of the Christian God provides a good basis for further study and argument, but seems oversimplified and unconvincing as presented in this work. Another shortcoming of this book is Johnston's attributing the origin of Zen to early Buddhism and the Gita, whereas in fact Zen originated in China, through Hui-neng and other masters, influenced by the natural aspects of Taoism and the practical aspects of Confucianism, as well as by Hua-yen School, etc. These historical aspects are not adequately discussed.
