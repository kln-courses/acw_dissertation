<plain_text><page sequence="1">KEVIN NEWMARK For When the Time Comes: Poetry, Prose, Mourning Das, meine Damen und Herren, hat keinen ein für allemal feststehen den Namen, aber ich glaube, es ist. . . die Dichtung. That, ladies and gentlemen, has no once-and-for-all fixed name, but I believe, it is . . . poetry. —Paul Celan, The Meridian When it comes to the time of poetry, what do we know? There was a time, for instance, when it may have made sense to speak of "The Yale School" as a collective force within the field of poetic studies. Today, of course, such a designation would appear less obvious and meaningful; in effect, anachronistic. In the case of "The Yale School," then, the time may have come to distinguish as sharply as possible between today and the past, precisely in order to separate the present from the past, and for the sake of the future.1 Time passes, things change. Considered from this perspective, time seems a natural enough sub ject for any reflection on lyric poetry. The elegy would be inconceivable without a reference to time's passage and the irreversible changes that such lapses in time inevitably bring with them—the disappearance of those we have known if nothing else. But even the ode and the idyll have a tendency to situate the present—as well as the future—with respect to another time that can be described and remembered for what it was, or else for what it might have been but was not. The question therefore imposes itself: what is the relation between time and poetry?2 1. For a well-informed, light-hearted, and insightful discussion of "The Yale School," see Andrzej Warminski's "Interview. Deconstruction at Yale," Material In scriptions: Rhetorical Reading in Practice and Theory (Edinburgh: Edinburgh Univer sity Press, 2013), especially 222-31. 2. It is worth noting that Jonathan Culler, seeking to identify apostrophe as the principal characteristic of lyric poetry, takes his first textual example from Lamartine's YFS 125/126, Time for Baudelaire (Poetry, Theory, History), ed. Burt, Marder, and Newmark, © 2014 by Yale University. 200</page><page sequence="2">KEVIN NEWMARK 201 Is the relation primarily thematic, time being one possible topic among others, though one that, as in the case of elegy, will often enough be dictated by the choice of genre, which may in turn result from the in tellectual or affective disposition of the poet? How would a reading of Baudelaire's "Le cygne,"3 for example, contribute to an understanding of what time is and how it functions poetically? The answer emerges at least in part from the way the question has to be asked. Poetry takes time, or at least it demands time, it asks for time to be given to it. But poetry does not take time coercively, or one-sidedly, without involving all kinds of mediations, negotiations, ruses. Rather, it takes time insofar as it needs time, which time it does not possess on its own or by itself. Standing in need of time, po etry finds itself in a state of unrelieved neediness, and so it is reduced to pleading; it is forced to beg others for its time. Without being given time, it is self-evident that poetry can neither be written nor read. Time is therefore not, or not only, and especially not first of all, a formal or thematic topic for consideration within poetry, since such topics could not come into being for poetry without a prior invest ment of time in the writing and reading of poetry. In this sense as well one could legitimately say that it is only by virtue of taking time away from everything except writing and reading that poetry is also able to make time for topics like time to become objects of poetic and critical thought. Whence, the incipit of "Le cygne": "Andromaque, je pense à vous!" Have we ever stopped to take the measure of the numberless pos sibilities this amazing beginning gives us to think? Does it not go out of its way to associate the act of poetry with the very possibility of thought? The poem originates in an apostrophe to a figure that is not present, but isn't this vocative call to the absent other para digmatic for all lyric poetry? What else would we call "poetry" if "Le lac," a poem that begins by inscribing the address to the lake within a décor of time, "sur l'océan des âges," which it then follows with a direct address to time: "O temps, suspends ton vol ..." And he concludes his essay by invoking Baudelaire's "À une passante," a lyric in which, as Elissa Marder has shown, the enigma of time's passage remains indissociably linked to the feminine figure addressed by the poem's apostrophe; they "cling" to each other for dear life, as it were.

All translations are my own.</page><page sequence="3">202 Yale French Studies not this apostrophe to the other that is not there? And what follows the call in this poem is just as remarkable and therefore deserving of thought as the call itself. The apostrophe marks the beginning of the poem and sends it on its way. By the same token, it signals the beginning of time for the poem: the time of the poem insofar and for as long as time is given to it; the time that is taken by the poem for whatever might happen in the wake of the originary apostrophe. The time of the poem, beginning with the apostrophe, is separated from everything else in the rest of the poem by a comma. After this comma, on the far side of the apostrophe, time begins again as the setting into place of a relation between self and other that is claimed by the subject as . . . thinking: "Andromaque, je pense à vous!" Fol lowing the establishment of this relation between self and other that is thinking, an entire world along with its history will appear: from ancient Greece to modern Europe and passing by way of Rome. The archive of this history projects itself beneath the covering of the sky and against the backdrop of the animal kingdom,- it includes several key stages of the social and political evolution by which its history is indelibly marked: the institution of marriage; rivalry, militarism and warfare; maritime travel and exploration; the economics of colonial ism; urban planning, landscaping, and architecture as well as the la bor forces required by them,- the establishment of national museums made possible by the development of aesthetic values as well as by revolutionary events. Without losing any of its specificity, does "Le cygne" not also speak for all other poems as well? Does it not suggest in this way that without the inaugural apostrophe of poetry there would be no time or history—for the self, for the other, and for think ing them together alongside the proliferation of their differences? The response to such far-reaching questions should neither be taken for granted nor given too quickly. But one thing becomes clear from even a preliminary glance at the poem. "Le cygne" would have nothing to give, could never offer anything for thinking the relation between poetry, time, and thought: 1 ) if the one who as a consequence of sign ing it we now know as Baudelaire had not taken the time to inscribe the poem's call, and 2) until such time as we respond to whatever this inscription calls us to read, until we allow the poem to take our time in reflecting on what it says about poetry, time, and thought.4 4. The paradoxical structure of giving and taking time that can be derived from reading "Le cygne" is associated by Jacques Derrida with both the gift and the poem,</page><page sequence="4">KEVIN NEWMARK 203 Now it just so happens that one of the most noticeable things that "Le cygne" gives every reader to think about is the topic of time as loss and mourning: "... nothing in my melancholy/ Has budged . . . I think of . . . you, Andromache, fallen from the arms of a mighty husband . . . Bent in ecstasy over an empty tomb ... I think of . . . whoever has lost that which cannot be recovered . . . ever!" (1:86-87) What the poem thus gives us time for thinking about is what, through time, is taken away from us, a thinking of precisely what we have trouble holding onto and keeping, which is to say, time itself as well as whatever happens within its elusive margins. Is it merely a coinci dence that the structural composition of "Le cygne"—an apostrophic call followed by the appearance of an "I" that declares itself capable of thinking about and addressing itself to a "you"—is articulated in this way with the themes of disappearance, loss, and mourning? The anecdotal evidence that Baudelaire associated the time of his own historical moment with death and mourning is well known. In a few famous lines from the chapter of his "Salon of 1846" called "Con cerning the Heroism of Modern Life," Baudelaire suggests that the only suitable color to be worn in modernity is black, "the symbol of a perpetual mourning" perfectly adapted to the omnipresence of death in the modern epoch.5 In a prose poem called "The Widows," the narrator goes even further, declaring loss to be the common source of both poetic and philosophical thought: "It is especially toward such dark and hidden places that the poet and the philosopher are likely to direct their attention, for it is here that they are sure to find nourish ment. ... They feel irresistibly drawn toward everything that is weak, ruined, afflicted, orphaned" (1:292).6 By employing a symbol to char acterize the way poets and philosophers alike exploit the loss of life to sustain their own discourse—"Il y a là une pâture certaine" (It is there that they can always find "good grazing," i.e. food for thought)—the narrator of the prose poem underscores the restorative function of with the gift as poem and as a certain poetics belonging to all narrative, including that of philosophical discourse, or thought. See, Jacques Derrida, Given Time: I. Counterfeit Money, tr. Peggy Kamuf (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1992), especially 40-44. 5. "Salon de 1846," Œuvres complètes, vol. 2, ed. Claude Pichois (Paris: Galli mard, Bibliothèque de la Pléiade, 1976), 2:494. Further references to this volume will appear in the text. All translations are my own. 6. It would be fruitful to compare the narrator to the author, who in his 1862 re view of Les misérables, uses a similar but non-identical formulation to describe Hugo: "... the poet is steadfast in his tender friendship for all that is weak, solitary, afflicted; for all that is orphaned: a paternal tendency" (2:217).</page><page sequence="5">204 Yale French Studies such symbols within Baudelaire's critical and poetic writings. It is certainly no accident that one of the most rigorous literary and philo sophical responses to "Le cygne," Proust's In Search of Lost Time, is able to conclude its seemingly endless narrative peregrinations only at the moment Marcel claims to discover a theory of the symbol that would be adequate to the impossible task of recovering all the time that he loses struggling to avoid facing the declaration made in "Le cygne" about its unrecoverability. It may be a commonplace to sug gest that both poetic constructions and philosophical systems offer compensations for a loss of natural immediacy (which they also serve to bring about). But that doesn't make the commonplace any less te nacious or effective in concealing the possibly illusory nature of the compensations it continues to endorse (and offer). If the passing of time—and therefore the coming of death—remains truly insuperable on its own terms, then the attempt to turn this loss into a compensa tory gain by translating it into the combined terms of aesthetic ex perience and cognitive thought, would constitute an equally insuper able temptation for every experience of thinking. Such, at any rate, seems to be the conclusion at which Paul de Man arrives in an essay on the lyric from the early 1980s, and which takes its examples from Baudelaire.7 Because the theme of time as death and mourning plays an integral role in the reception of Baudelaire's modernity, de Man has to pay attention to it when in the course of his analysis he reads the sonnet "Obsession." Nor will de Man fail to note that the theme can and should be understood as an aesthetic and epistemological recuperation of the ultimate loss of time entailed by death. Consciousness, to the extent that it includes consciousness of the phenomenal world, must combine aesthetic and cognitive ele ments from the start. To be self-conscious, de Man reminds us, means to construct a spatial container for consciousness by situating it in side one's own body. This "union of aesthetic with epistemological properties" that is carried out by the mediation of self-consciousness, de Man then adds, also "implies its negation" (256). How, exactly, one should ask, does the union of aesthetic with epistemological proper ties that is accomplished by self-consciousness imply its negation? 7. See, Paul de Man, "Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric," The Rhetoric of Romanticism (New York: Columbia University Press, 1984), 239-62. Further refer ences to this essay will appear in the text.</page><page sequence="6">KEVIN NEWMARK 205 The answer is not given explicitly at that point in de Man s essay, but it is easy enough to supply it on the basis of the ensuing argu ment. The self as a spatial container enclosing the mind is not by itself sufficient to account for what de Man calls "the enigma of con sciousness," much less for its negation (259). The negation of the self as the articulation of mind and body occurs in Baudelaire's poem—as it occurs in the philosophical tradition as well—when the space of representation is forced to acknowledge its inscription within the di mension of time, which involves change as both appearance and dis appearance: "But the shadows are themselves canvases/ Where, gush ing from my eye by the thousands, live/ Departed beings with familiar gazes" ("Obsession," 1:76). What the eye—whose homonymie value in English just happens to suggest the desired coordination of sensu ous and intellectual light—actually "sees" when it accedes to con sciousness is not the phenomenal world in its all immediate presence. Rather, the experience of space that becomes accessible to the self as self-consciousness is necessarily saturated in time. De Man compares such space to the sound chamber of a violin since the void that it is on its own can be perceived only through the temporal rhythm of its "vibrations," an analogy offering an apt gloss of the poem's first qua train, which compares the human heart—another figure for the union of aesthetic and epistemological properties—to "chambers of eternal mourning filled with vibrating death-rattles from long ago" (1:75).8 If space can be compared to a sensuous container for the workings of the mind, then time would be the principle of entropy to which that system of thought remains subject. De Man's reading of "Obsession" thus confirms the familiar char acterization of Baudelaire's modernity as a time of loss and destitu tion. Modernity would be the historical moment when lyric poetry makes time for mourning—aesthetically and epistemologically—the ravages of time that it brings so vividly into view. What is more, these losses seem to find compensation in the poetic treatment that nour ishes critical and philosophical thought precisely by recalling the 8. Mallarmé pays tribute to Baudelaire when he uses the same image to negate Baudelaire's negation by making the sound chamber signify a highly tentative birth instead of a series of recollected deaths: "Au creux néant musicien/ .. . Filial on aurait pu naître." (In the hollow musical nothing/ . . . Filial, one might have been born.). See Mallarmé's sonnet, "Une dentelle s'abolit...Œuvres complètes, vol. 1, ed. Bertrand Marchai (Paris: Gallimard, Bibliothèque de la Pléiade, 1998), 1:42-43. My translation.</page><page sequence="7">206 Yale French Studies phenomenon of loss to our attention. For to recall loss to conscious ness is also to recall consciousness to its own power of recollection, a power without which it could not come into being. "Obsession" works, de Man concludes; it accomplishes the labor of mourning it assigns itself by virtue of the faculty of memory, a mental faculty that works to keep whatever has been lost to time. The anguished tonal ity of the sonnet cannot conceal the magnitude of its achievement. The subject who speaks in "Obsession" says that he would prefer not to remember those he has known and who have disappeared before him,- but this affective reaction is itself proof of the effective power of recollection. Through recollection he is able to preserve those who are no longer there but who remain nonetheless the object of his con sciousness: "departed beings with familiar gazes" now "live" thanks to an inner eye of memory. The desire to forget and be rid of the past is perhaps an even more conclusive demonstration of the capacity to hold onto it than the desire to remember, since we desire to forget only that with which we are truly familiar, what we understand suf ficiently well to judge worth the effort of forgetting. This pattern of "mourning," however, as a recuperation of lost presence by aesthetic and epistemological means, even where it ap pears, as here, in the mode of denial, is precisely what de Man will put into question at the end of his essay. With his signature brio, de Man calls this kind of mourning "deluded," part of a defensive strat egy that relies upon "nostalgia" to recover what it only pretended no longer to possess. Nostalgia is in fact a displaced name for recovery since it always implies a clear consciousness of the loss it suffers and mourns,- the poem offers an aesthetic object to a philosophical speculation that replaces the representation of absence with its cogni tion. Whether the subject tries to flee from this consciousness, as in "Obsession," or seeks to prolong it, as in "Le cygne," makes little dif ference in terms of the underlying ability to reflect self-consciously on it. In both poems, the experience of loss seems ultimately to be transformed into a source of relative plenitude. The "accursed heart" that beats in "Obsession" beats to the rhythm of sights and sounds recalled all too vividly from a disappeared world; when the "cygne" acquires speech to complain about its fate, it speaks with a "heart" that remains "filled with the splendid lake of its birth." It is this rhythm of nostalgia, moreover, vibrating dolefully in "Obsession" and coursing thoughtfully through "Le cygne," that de</page><page sequence="8">KEVIN NEWMARK 207 Man associates with lyric poetry in general.9 Considered from this point of view, de Man goes on to suggest, generic terms like "lyric" and historical period-terms like "modernity" function together as terms of "resistance," and what they resist is the way actual his tory has to occur. By giving voice to loss, the lyric attempts to initi ate a temporal process of mourning that could eventually succeed in understanding it. "True 'mourning,'" de Man concludes, "is less deluded. The most it can do is to allow for non-comprehension ..." (262). The use of quotation marks around the word mourning here is remarkable. De Man does not put quotation marks around the word true; he does not speak of "true" mourning. Rather, by writing "true 'mourning,'" de Man suggests an important difference at the heart of mourning itself, as though it could be true that there were two kinds of mourning, each true enough in its own way.10 True mourning, as de Man reads it, parries the experience of loss by artfully transforming it into a source of reflection for consciousness. As the overt theme in "Obsession," mourning is in fact described as a dialectical move ment that begins by constructing a spatial enclosure for absence—the "chambers of eternal mourning" mentioned in the first stanza of the sonnet and located within the living. Over the following stanzas, that inner space of emptiness is made into an external object of contem plation and possible comprehension. Thanks to aesthetic devices of representation, a void is converted into plenitude, projected onto vis ible "canvases on which live .. . thousands and thousands of departed ones." The lyric, considered as articulated sound or song, celebrates its power to replace loss with intelligible images that commemorate 9. This description of the two poems refers to their thematic dimension alone and does not take into account any potentially disruptive elements in their composi tion. De Man's own reading of "Obsession" is careful to inscribe the theme of nostalgia within rhetorical structures that would no longer be compatible with a successful, lyrical mourning. The uneasy relation between narrative themes and poetic structures is precisely what makes the name "poetry" so difficult to define in either formal or historical terms. 10. Derrida draws attention to de Man's use of quotation marks in this instance in Mémoires: for Paul de Man (New York: Columbia University Press, Revised Edition, 1989), 29-32. The quotation marks may also indicate a citation—and a translation—of the way "mourning" functions in Walter Benjamin's Trauerspiel book, Origin of the German Mourning Play (known in English under the title of The Origin of German Tragic Drama). Benjamin's name is not mentioned in de Man's essay, but Benjamin's readings of Baudelaire constitute an indirect reference for everything de Man says, as if de Man's essay were also a response addressed to Benjamin's writings.</page><page sequence="9">208 Yale French Studies it. True mourning, on the other hand, would somehow not succeed in moving beyond mourning in this way; it would keep mourning suspended, interrupted, caught in an act that remains graphically, be cause typo-graphically, incomplete and therefore uncomprehended. Paul de Man's "mourning" does not recall to consciousness some thing that, lost in time, could one day be recovered through recol lection. Rather, "mourning" for Paul de Man would incessantly call memory back to a time of loss without identifiable content, an in stant of radical forgetting that no consciousness could hope to absorb through representation and understanding. The relation between Baudelaire's lyric and prose poetry has been a lively source of critical speculation since at least the 1960s,11 though it would be fair to say that the main interest of the cumulative effort at contextualization and exegesis lies in the inconclusiveness of its results rather than in the establishment of any consensus or ground rules. One of the more fruitful methodological techniques consists in the dubious hypothesis that the prose poems are more "allegorical" (and thus obscure) than the verse poems. Whereas the verse poems seem to refer to what they actually describe, the prose poems describe only in order to refer to something that does not appear inside the frame of their narrative, such as the allegorical principle that deter mines their mode of signification. One has little difficulty in identify ing "allegory" as a crucial component of "Le cygne," since the poem speaks directly of allegory as the best means for referring to all the losses it is in the process of recounting: "tout pour moi devient allé gorie, " everything becomes allegory for me. But it seems much more difficult to circumscribe the referent of a prose poem like "The Bad Glazier"; the topic of broken glass does not appear on its own to merit poetic treatment, but there is nothing within the narrative descrip tion of smashed glass that would reliably anchor its signifying func tion to any other meaning. From there, it is but a short step to con 11. The dates in question can be misleading; especially if it is Baudelaire's "crit ical speculation" that accounts for the productivity of this relationship in the first place. Mallarmé suspected this by making it into a principle of his own writing, and Valéry confirmed it by declaring that prose was inessential for Baudelaire. Already in the 1920s and 30s, Walter Benjamin insisted on the necessity of taking the relationship into account in any reading of Baudelaire.</page><page sequence="10">KEVIN NEWMARK 209 sider that the poem in prose, without having to describe itself, might nonetheless refer to itself. The broken glass can be taken allegori cally, a deflected figure for the shattered ideal of formal consistency that occurs whenever prose is put—or in the case of "The Bad Gla zier" when it is dropped—into poetry.12 What the glass in the poem ultimately makes "visible" is the destruction of its own transparency as meaningful form. The hypothesis is dubious not because prose po etry is not thoroughly allegorical; far from it. It is dubious because, by calling the prose poetry "more" allegorical than the verse poetry, it wittingly or unwittingly implies that the allegorical dimension of texts might be accurately identified and then measured in compara tive degrees, something that is far from certain. For once the refer ence to allegory intervenes, there is no reason not to suppose that the verse poems aren't every bit as allegorical—or more so—than the prose poems. The passer of counterfeit money who passes through "La fausse monnaie" can always pass into an allegorical figure for the lyrical voice of Les fleurs du mal. And when this happens, the term "allegory" put into circulation by the speaker of "Le cygne" begins to function just as aberrantly as the fake coin given to the poor beg gar—who, in addition to naming the true "beggar," can also refer, allegorically, to the erstwhile "friend," the fictional narrator, and the actual reader—of the prose poem. The allegorical reference, like the counterfeit coin to which it is related, is at once fecund and barren: it can always generate new systems of value and signification that were not there beforehand; but lacking any resources of its own, it can nei ther regulate the semantic errancy it makes possible nor prevent its erratic movements from suddenly grinding to a halt. That under such circumstances "economics" was bound to emerge as a privileged site for Baudelaire's prose poetry might therefore have even more to do with the poetics of allegory than with the prosaic context of nineteenth-century market capitalism in which the prose poems just happened to be written. Whatever else can be said about the relation of lyric to prose poetry in Baudelaire, one thing at least is certain: it can become fully legible only by considering together and in their complex interdependence its economic themes and its 12. The metaphorical meanings can be variously distributed among the different figures in the story without changing the irreversible direction of its allegorical move ment: the thematic narrative of "The Bad Glazier" lends itself equally well to reading the shattering of form that occurs when the ethereal attributes of poetry are allowed to fall to the prosaic level of purely mechanical devices and codes.</page><page sequence="11">210 Yale French Studies allegorical character.13 Which is another way of saying that in Bau delaire the relation of prose to lyric poetry will have to depend on a principle of exchange that is at once poetic and prosaic; but since it is a principle of oblique and therefore lopsided exchange, the ensuing losses and gains will always, though never in exactly the same man ner, disclose a bottom line of allegorical discrepancies rather than symbolic equivalences. There can be no better way of appraising the potential barrenness or fecundity of that rather peremptory theoretical conclusion than to apply it to reading one of Baudelaire's own texts. "Les yeux des pauvres" deserves attention on a number of ac counts. The narrator describes how he and his feminine companion sit comfortably at the table of a luxurious new café on the corner of one of Paris's brand-new boulevards while a poor man stands in the roadway with his two children, staring at the scene of conspicuous consumption from which they are excluded (1:317-19). The text can be taken first of all, in the immediate context of "Obsession," as a variation on the theme of looking that is so prevalent in Baudelaire's lyric poetry. The "regards familiers" that conclude the sonnet refer to the familiar looks belonging to the dear departed, those who have become "poor" as a result of having been deprived of a world they may at one time have enjoyed as personal property. The poor eyes in the prose poem are the eyes of the poor, eyes belonging to those who look at a socio-economic world that even in life does not belong to them. It is as though the wish expressed in "Obsession"—"I seek emptiness, obscurity, and nudity"—had been granted in "Les yeux des pauvres," though in a prosaic mode of economic indigence with which the speaker of the poem now comes uncomfortably face to face. One is also reminded of the exchange of "regards" that occurs in "A une passante," since the prose poem also contains a shared look between the speaker and his feminine companion. But whereas the glance in the sonnet gives the speaker the sensation of being "sud denly reborn," the eyes of the companion in "Les yeux des pauvres" fail to offer the self-reflection the speaker is hoping to find in them. By making the prose poem "look" at the lyric verse in this way, moreover, a change in temporal patterns becomes discernible as 13. This imperative was articulated by Walter Benjamin—against the canonical tendency established by Valéry. See, especially, Benjamin, "The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire" and "Central Park," Selected Writings, vol. 4, ed. Michael W. Jennings (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2003).</page><page sequence="12">KEVIN NEWMARK 211 well. In both "À une passante" and "Obsession" time is articulated as a passage from past presence to present absence; though it is in the now of that absence that the lyric voice speaks in assured tones about its knowledge regarding what is no longer immediately pres ent for perception. What appears phenomenally in time—incarnated as both what is most and least familiar—disappears in the blink of an eye, though that disappearance allows for its re-appearance in both description and cognition. The lyric poems supply the subjective af fect most suited to this transitory character of time's passage: regret. The regret can be directed either toward the known ("Obsession") or the unknown ("À une passante), and it can take the form of a desire to recall ("À une passante") or to forget ("Obsession"). But as we know from "To the Reader," the affect of regret, like that of nostal gia, can always become a source of replenishment: "And we nourish our lovable regrets,/ The way beggars provide sustenance to their vermin" (1:5). The analogy is telling precisely to the extent that the poverty of these "beggars" in verse remains metaphorical. When the poor materialize in their own right in "Les yeux des pauvres," time is no longer structured the same way: nothing about them "passes" from presence to absence in order to re-appear in recollec tion, since nothing essential about them allows itself to appear in the first place. "Poverty," which is what they incarnate only through their lack of "properties," cannot be made perceivable as a pleni tude that then passes away,- for the same reason it is not so easily replaced by description or cognition. The affect in the prose poem is thus not regret (much less boredom), but rather shame. What, then, does "Les yeux des pauvres" tell us about this difference between a time of regret and a time of shame? And would this difference have anything to say about mourning, or rather what Paul de Man calls "true 'mourning'"? Shame makes its appearance in "Les yeux des pauvres" at the mo ment the narrator turns away from the poor and notices the clut tered table at which he and his companion have been refreshing themselves. Juxtaposing the destitution of the poor to his own abun dance, the narrator acknowledges feeling shame at the sight of plen tiful glassware set out before him: "... I felt a little ashamed of our glasses and carafes ..." The diminutive qualifier, "un peu honteux," draws even more attention to the shame, since it makes one wonder if the narrator knows what he is talking about: can someone who</page><page sequence="13">212 Yale French Studies reels only a little ashamed really know what shame is?1* lhat shame functions in this text as a displaced symptom for a more far-reaching deficiency of knowledge, and not only about shame, becomes clearer when the narrator completes his thought: "I felt a little ashamed of our glasses and carafes, greater than our thirst." It turns out that the narrator is not just comparing what he possesses to what the poor are lacking, in other words, money to buy whatever one wants. With an added twist, he turns what is plain to see, a plethora of glasses and carafes, into a rhetorical figure for something else entirely, which he calls thirst. In this way, the narrator suggests that the glasses and ca rafes, beyond serving as ordinary metonyms for the beverages poured at nineteenth-century Parisian cafés, can also serve to make visible "thirst," that invisible cause of his spending time and money in order to satisfy it. There is something excessive, "plus grands," the narra tor admits, about these glasses and carafes, though the excess on view is itself lacking in determination—is it perceptible in their number or size, in the possibility that their contents haven't been fully con sumed? The glassware may allow the narrator's "thirst" to be seen and thus in some sense known; but what kind of "knowledge" is that if the form of its expression remains forever inadequate to the speci ficity of its content? The economic disparity between rich and poor is straightforward by comparison. It is nakedly visible and can be known in terms of the clear distinction between those who stand before and those who sit at the café; those who can only look at what they cannot buy and those who can always buy what they no longer desire even to see, never mind to have and use. But the narrator makes the knowledge of this disparity between rich and poor depend on another, more problematic discrepancy when he points to the analogical inadequacy of the glass ware to convey its hidden meaning. The problem with the spectacle staged on the café table is not, or not just, the overabundance, signi fied by the "plus grands" glasses and carafes set out in plain view for rich and poor alike. The problem is the "thirst," notre soif, with which that visible excess has to be articulated, for it names a peculiar 14. The locus classicus of the articulation of shame with knowledge is the book of Genesis: the crucial difference between the uncovered and covered nakedness of Adam and Eve passes by way of their (forbidden| accession to knowledge through the fall. To know shame always involves a deficiency of which knowledge is the (defective) effect. See Genesis 2:25 and 3:7.</page><page sequence="14">KEVIN NEWMARK 213 kind of lack—or penury—that ultimately displays a radical inacces sibility to either aesthetic or cognitive determinations. One easily sees—or believes one sees—that the narrator is ashamed before the gaze of the poor because they can so easily see how the wasteful consumerism of the café economy in which he is ensconced contributes directly or indirectly to the socio-political dis enfranchisement of the class of poor to which they belong. What is less obvious is that the shameful knowledge the narrator claims to possess about the economic disparity in which he continues to par ticipate also conceals a non-knowledge that may prove even more shameful for his unquestioned assumptions regarding understanding and mastery. For where has anyone ever seen—or, for that matter, heard, smelled, touched, or tasted—their own, never mind someone else's "thirst"? By linking the expression of his shame to the figurai discrepancy between the glass containers and his thirst, the narrator inadvertently—that is to say, allegorically—points to the unreliable grounds of his own knowledge about everything, and not just about social, economic, erotic, and gustatory matters. In order for his thirst to appear as the visual spectacle that he claims it to be, he has to have recourse to some kind of material container inside which its inacces sibility can be made available to perception by the eyes—of the rich as well as of the poor. The verbal "verres et carafes" that will have been necessary to bring the lack named thirst into view will therefore always be "greater" than the thirst precisely to the extent that thirst is nothing but lack. One can indeed know that one "has" thirst, but that knowledge is definitive proof of its own incapacity to slake it. If "thirst" it is, then it is always a thirst for something else, something that it does not possess, including and especially when it is a thirst for knowledge. What the narrator of "Les yeux des pauvres" can say only allegorically, and therefore without knowing it, is that his shame over the glassware laid out on the table is a sign of what he doesn't know, and therefore cannot say directly, about his "own" thirst, in other words, the driving force behind all that he is and all that he does, which includes exercising his prerogatives over all that he owns. The difference between regret and shame—as they are inscribed in the interplay between lyric and prose poetry by Baudelaire—has to do with the difference between a determination of time as sequential duration and a determination of time as a series of instantaneous and discontinuous points. Although both determinations of time involve</page><page sequence="15">214 Yale French Studies memory as loss and mourning, they remain irreducible to each other. The time of regret—thematized openly in "Obsession," "Le cygne," and "À une passante"—is a time that attempts to recollect an ex perience of past presence in the mode of loss, though only in order to regain what it has lost by recognizing in mourning an increase of its own consciousness and understanding. The time of shame, on the other hand—the deflected effect of an indiscernable force in "Les yeux des pauvres"—can do nothing with recollection. It begins its "mourning" anew each time by forgetting everything but the dispro portionate signs of its thirst, by which it is reminded over and again only of what it lacks: a lack of that which in its thirst it can neither have nor know—and that is its shame. It would be a shame of a slightly different sort, however, to leave things there, since it risks giving the misleading impression that Baudelaire's lyric poetry would be more narrative in nature than the prose poems. It could be that the main interest of the prose poetry is to remind us that the narrative elements appearing in figurai guise in the verse poetry are not the whole story. Clearly, at least part of the narrator's thirst has to with narrative, since the moment of shame is itself merely one instant in the encapsulating story that he tells. That story, however, turns out to be a story about time, and it tells, or rather shows how prose narrative is constantly interrupted by the non-narrative instants from which it has to be composed, despite the narrator's best efforts to keep those moments contained within the frame of his own narrative prose. The main source of these in terruptions seems to come from the narrator's feminine companion, who displays a tendency to puncture each of the narrative sequences proposed by the poem's speaker, leaving the text in a state of dis crete fragments. The text uses versions of both mimesis and diegesis to recount retrospectively how the narrator and his companion had spent the entire day together, though the declared result of this time shared is estrangement rather than the communion of souls that had been promised. The long day that seemed short to the narrator has on the contrary tired out his companion, leading to their coming to rest at the café as the day approaches its end.15 Just as the narrator tries 15. For a subtle and astute reading of the "day" in "Les yeux des pauvres/' see E. S. Burt's "Out of Time" in this volume. Like its companion-piece in verse, "À une passante," the prose poem is not only about time, it may also be taken as an address, deflected and thus allegorical, to time. The grammatical status of "today" at the end of the first line—"Ah! you want to know why I hate you today" (1:317)—provided only</page><page sequence="16">KEVIN NEWMARK 215 to initiate a new story, responding to the staring eyes of the poor by lending them a voice with which to describe and admire the privi leged position he occupies at the café, he is stymied once again by his companion. Before he is able to connect the speech he ascribes to the eyes of the poor to the thoughts he hopes to find in his partner's eyes, a different response is generated on her part to those blank eyes. This response, insisting on the eyes' unbearable void, is wholly incompati ble with the aesthetic discourse the narrator had tried to impose upon them. Not only is the narrator not encouraged to develop his story, he is instructed to have the source of his story-telling, the paupers and their wide-open eyes, removed from the scene, which suddenly stops there. The most peculiar aspect of the text involves what comes next. Following the citation directing the narrator to have the poor family taken out of the scene, and pre-supposed by the incipit of the narra tion as its raison d'être, there is a blank space in the text. This empti ness is marked by the incipit as a final request, neither reported nor quoted anywhere by the text, that the narrator furnish an explanation for why he hates his companion, today. Without this request, forever missing from the text proper, the prose poem would not have come into existence as the descriptive explanation that, today, it purports to be for the feminine form that shadows the narrator's every step. The historical occurrence of the poem thus depends on a demand for speech nowhere present to it but to which it declares itself totally indebted; it refers only by responding to a call that in the now of its own time lies mute as well as invisible. The text is in this way deprived, bereft, separated absolutely from whatever power made it want to speak in the first place. For all these reasons, this poem in prose can be called a text of "mourning." It "mourns" the absence of an originary address to which it owes itself as response—though the mourning here does not replace that open space with any kind of intelligibility. For the text is careful in its very first lines to refer its speech to a desire for knowledge that it says it will not be able to satisfy: "... you want to know why I hate you today. It would no doubt be more difficult for you to understand than for me to explain it." The response thus remembers a demand that is not there, but it that one pauses for an instant before it, can be taken as a noun as well as an adverb. Time, like the feminine companion, has no fixed identity: it is both necessary for the narrator's experience to take place and wholly inaccessible to that experience.</page><page sequence="17">216 Yale French Studies does so in a mode that cannot be called recuperative. To keep such a blank space in memory without lending it representational content or subjecting it to cognitive recollection, the text suggests, would be to recognize its absolute impermeability. After declaring its incapac ity to meet the demand for knowledge and comprehension to which it remains nonetheless obliged, the text continues: "... It would no doubt be more difficult for you to understand [why I hate you today] than for me to explain it; for you are, I believe, the most perfect ex ample of feminine impermeability that could ever be encountered" [car vous êtes, je crois, le plus bel exemple de l'imperméabilité fémi nine qui se puisse rencontrer). To remember what is encountered as truly impermeable to recuperation and recollection—in other words forgetting—would to be "mourn" it in a mode that is just as readily called "hating" as "loving," since in both cases, as also in shame, the subject who responds to it cannot know or control what he is experiencing. Under such circumstances, it would make little sense to insist on piercing the "impermeability" of this blank demand for a response by identifying it with a particular object of "mourning": a man, two men, a woman, all women, the poet's muse—or even, especially, those poor eyes that steadfastly address the narrator of the prose poem without ever speaking intelligibly to him. All one could say is that the "im permeable" encounter to which the poem in prose responds is quali fied by the narrator with the adjective "feminine," meaning that it is the attribute of impermeability that conditions the meaning of femi ninity here rather than the other way around. Is there, in conclusion, nothing else to say about this anonymous and impermeable encounter toward which the prose poem turns it self in "mourning"? It is perhaps not entirely fortuitous that the rhe torical structure of the frame enclosing the prose poem's narrative is apostrophe: "Ah! you want to know why I hate you today" (1:317). The text's apostrophic opening feigns to restore another address, the demand of another, already wanting for knowledge and explanation, which is not forthcoming. Apostrophe is the trope of direct address, but in this case the address of the apostrophe is a response to an apos trophic call from elsewhere that is not allowed to appear in its own name. The poem in prose thus turns itself away from a direct repre sentation of the apostrophe to which it nonetheless owes its exis tence; it does so by leaving open a space for the apostrophe that is not included in the time of its own narration. That space of apostrophe</page><page sequence="18">KEVIN NEWMARK 217 now looks out and stares blankly at whoever attempts to read "Les yeux des pauvres." It brings to mind, without giving it a fixed name or shape, the impermeability of every call in the instant before it has been identified, interrogated, explained, recollected or understood in narrative terms: in other words before or at the beginning of the world. That space is "poetry" in the state of pure trope; it introduces a time of "mourning" for an encounter forever deprived of determi nate sense. It is certainly not poetry as voice or song, but rather the voiceless call that opens the measure of all time. Baudelaire's poem in prose is therefore not prosaic because it lacks poetry; on the contrary, it becomes true "prose" only in the instant that it makes room—in other words, leaves time—to remember and thus to "mourn" the po etic trace of impermeability it now carries within it.</page></plain_text>
