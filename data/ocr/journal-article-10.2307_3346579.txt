<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ellen Cronan Rose The Good Mother: From Gaia to Gilead Close reading of current environmental literature suggests that lurking just below the surface of quite justified concern about the increasingly disjunctive relationship between humans and nature is a knotted lump of unexamined anxiety about gender, sexuality, and repro- duction. Certainly it is reasonable to worry that pollution of the ecosys- tem and unchecked exploitation of the planet's resources may imperil both human reproduction and the reproductiveness of the planet itself.1 But in certain discourses that deploy the concept of "mother earth," this legitimate concern is charged with particular emotion by what might be called "reproductive anxiety." I will be discussing scholarly and popular presentations of British chemist James Lovelock's hypothesis (named Gaia for the Greek earth goddess) that this planet is a living organism, as well as selections from a recent anthology of essays by environmental feminists ("ecofeminists") who find inspiration in "the myths and symbols of ancient Goddess cultures in which creation was imaged as female and the Earth was revered as sacred."2 In male rhetoric about mother earth, it will be easy for women readers (especially feminists) to detect men's terror of maternal power and their strenuous effort to deny or neutralize it, their guilt at having offended mother, and their desperate need to assure themselves of both their importance to her and her overwhelm- ing concern for them. But although contemporary Western women may not manifest the same anxieties about mother earth as their male counterparts do, the rhetoric of some ecofeminists also displays strains of reproductive anxiety. Since Frangoise d'Eaubonne coined the term ecofeminisme in 1974, feminist anthropologists, historians, scientists, theologians, and poets have commented on the near-universal association of women and Frontiers, vol.

Frontiers Editorial Collective. 77</page><page sequence="2">FRONTIERS nature.3 In Western civilization, this association has led to and, in many instances, justified men's exploitation of both nature's and women's productive and reproductive capacities; both women and nature are seen in patriarchal thought as "other than" and inferior to men and culture. Feminists have responded in various ways to the traditional associ- ation of women with nature. "Rational" feminists,4 following Simone de Beauvoir, repudiate the woman/nature connection because emphasizing women's "natural" procreative capacities mires them in what Beauvoir called "repetition and immanence," excluding them from cultural pro- duction.5 "Radical" (sometimes called "cultural") feminists, on the other hand, accept and affirm the woman/nature connection; they form the dominant group among contemporary ecofeminists. Although they acknowledge that patriarchal culture has emphasized the connection between women and nature in order to exploit both, writers like Mary Daly and Susan Griffin believe women should proudly assert their difference from men and reclaim their "natural" creativity, intuition, emotion, and spirituality. Both rational and radical feminists implicitly if not explicitly accept the notion that there is a dichotomy between nature and culture. Socialist feminists like Carolyn Merchant, however, believe that "nature" (like "woman") is "historically and socially constructed."6 In The Death of Nature, Merchant charts the transition that took place in seventeenth-century Europe from an "organic" to a "mechani- cal" construction of nature. In 1500, peasants and philosophers alike thought of nature as a living organism, conceptualized as female. Na- ture, especially the earth, was seen as "a nurturing mother: a kindly beneficent female who provided for the needs of mankind." The "wild and uncontrollable" aspects of nature - storms, droughts, floods - were also associated with the female sex. In the seventeenth century, "the metaphor of the earth as a nurturing mother was gradually to vanish as a dominant image as the Scientific Revolution proceeded to mechanize and to rationalize the world view." At the same time, the image of nature as disorderly female led to the witch trials and the idea of asserting "power over nature." In brief, "an organically oriented mentality in which female principles played an important role was undermined and replaced by a mechanically oriented mentality that either eliminated or used female principles in an exploitative manner."7 Merchant says that "the image of the earth as a living organism and nurturing mother had served as a cultural constraint restricting the actions of human beings" because "one does not readily slay a mother, dig into her entrails for gold, or mutilate her body. . . . As long as the earth was considered to be alive and sensitive, it could be considered a 78</page><page sequence="3">VOLUME XII, NO. 1 breach of human ethical behavior to carry out destructive acts against it.98 Her discussion of the Renaissance pastoral tradition - in which nature was depicted as virgin nymph and earth mother - reveals, however, that such imagery does not necessarily lead to respect for nature's or women's autonomy and integrity: "While the pastoral tradi- tion symbolized nature as a benevolent female, it contained the implica- tion that nature when plowed and cultivated could be used as a commodity and manipulated as a resource. . . . It depended on a masculine perception of nature as a mother and bride whose primary function was to comfort, nurture, and provide for the well-being of the male."9 In both The Death of Nature and Ecological Revolutions, Mer- chant shows not only that both Europe and what is now the United States passed from a preindustrial "organic" to a capitalist "mechanis- tic" worldview but that whatever the term mother means to a given culture will metaphorically infect the meanings that culture attaches to the term mother earth. The U.S. counterpart to the Renaissance pasto- ral tradition was the nineteenth-century nature romanticism of Henry David Thoreau. He wrote as a son and lover of mother nature, to whom he retreated at Walden Pond for sustenance and solace from the crass industrialism of Concord.o0 The nineteenth-century doctrine of separate spheres echoes in contemporary rhetoric about mother nature's benefi- cent influence. According to the bourgeois ideology of the 1800s, "as mother and wife, woman embodied the moral law. Her home was the space in which she instilled morals in her husband and children. Both a morally uprighteous mother and a healthy natural environment were necessary to produce a healthy child.'" Not only children but men as well were encouraged to view nature as mother nature, with exactly the same respect (and expectations) they had for (and of) middle-class mothers. The farmer was idealized in the bourgeois imagination. He could sit at his hearth in the evening, refreshing himself "with his affectionate wife and smiling children," while "his corn ripens, his garden flourishes, and mother earth bountifully rewards him for all his toil," just as his wife no doubt did.12 Fifteen years ago, well before the efflorescence of contemporary ecofeminism, Rosemary Ruether cautioned women to "look with suspi- cion on the symbolic role they will be asked to play in an ecological crisis analyzed within patriarchal culture": Any effort to reconcile such a male with "nature," which does not restructure the psychology and social patterns which make nature 79</page><page sequence="4">FRONTIERS "alien," will tend to shape women, the patriarchal symbol of "na- ture," into romanticized servitude to a male-defined alienation. The concern with ecology could repeat the mistakes of nineteenth-century romanticism with its renewed emphasis on the opposite, "complemen- tary natures" of men and women. Women will again be asked to be the "natural" wood-nymph and earth mother and to create places of escape from the destructive patterns of the dominant culture.13 Despite Ruether's warning and Merchant's meticulous scholarship, many contemporary ecofeminists have applauded the revival of mother earth rhetoric. Deploring the "demothering" of nature in her book on women, ecology, and development in India,4 Vandana Shiva welcomes the appropriation of mother earth imagery by various contemporary environmental groups: "The symbolism of Terra Mater, the earth in the form of the Great Mother, creative and protective, has been a shared but diverse symbol across space and time, and ecology movements in the West today are inspired in large part by the recovery of the concept of Gaia, the earth goddess."s5 Many radical ecofeminists have felt empowered by a return to nature-based religions and a revival of goddess spirituality. Writers like Carol Christ, Riane Eisler, Monica Sjoo, Barbara Mor, Charlene Spretnak, Starhawk, and Merlin Stone celebrate ancient traditions that honor women's power and creativity, above all the capacity they share with nature of giving life.16 "We would not have been interested in 'Yahweh with a skirt,' " Spretnak explains: "What was intriguing was the sacred link between the Goddess in her many guises and totemic animals and plants, sacred groves, and womblike caves, in the moon- rhythm blood of menses, the ecstatic dance - the experience of know- ing Gaia, her voluptuous contours and fertile plains, her flowing waters that give life, her animal teachers" (emphasis in the original).17 Ynestra King says radical feminists' "recognition of women as embodied, earth-bound living beings who should celebrate their connec- tion to the rest of life" is "supported" by James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis.18 Riane Eisler says Lovelock's theory is "in essence" a "scientific update of the belief system of Goddess-worshipping prehis- toric societies" in which "the world was viewed as the great Mother, a living entity who in both her temporal and spiritual manifestations creates and nurtures all forms of life."19 Yet, a careful reading of Lovelock does not suggest that he subscribes to this "belief system." Nor does Michael Tobias in his Voice of the Planet, the science fiction realization of Lovelock's hypothesis that, in Tobias's words, "this entire Earth is a living planet, a singular organism with its own agenda and 80</page><page sequence="5">VOLUME XII, NO. 1 wants."20 In fact, both Voice of the Planet and Lovelock's own exposi- tion of his hypothesis demonstrate that endorsing the concept of mother earth may be hazardous for women. Voice of the Planet was displayed prominently in chain bookstores in July 1990. On the cover, the title bisected the familiar image of the whole earth, photographed by NASA from the moon, and a banner across the top of the cover informed the potential reader that this novel would be "coming this fall as a major TBS miniseries."21 Turning to the inside front cover, one read that Voice of the Planet would be "an unprecedented international event" that would "usher in the decade of the 1990s, a period in which human civilization must be more con- cerned about the environment than ever before." The project was endorsed by Denis Hayes, chair and chief executive officer of Earth Day 1990. Viewers of the ten-hour series, like readers of the book from which it derives, can expect to learn a good deal about the origins of life on earth, evolution, population, pollution, global warming, the danger of species extinction, and the absolute value of the Amazonian rain forest. But generic imperatives, combined with the economic realities of com- mercial television, can be counted on to produce enough drama and human interest to make the ecological lectures palatable. Fictionalizing the Gaia hypothesis involves turning Lovelock's hypothetical "organ- ism" into a character - the "voice" of the book's title - to be played by Faye Dunaway in the miniseries. William Shatner has been cast as the narrator-protagonist, William Hope Planter.22 Two plots can be discerned in Voice of the Planet. The first is an "ecological" plot, which proceeds on two chronological tracks. One follows a year in the life of Planter, an ecologist on sabbatical from Cal Tech to write a book on the "history of human impact on earth."23 In a Buddhist monastery in Tibet, he discovers a computer that begins to "talk" to him, first by displaying messages on the monitor, then by speaking aloud. For a year, Gaia, who claims to be the voice of planet earth, instructs Planter about "man's" place in and impact on the ecosystem.24 This instruction proceeds along a second chronological track, through a series of strange and miraculous time-and-space journeys the special effects people will delight in transferring to the television screen. Gaia takes Planter to the mineral beginnings of life on Iceland, to a Greek island in 800 B.C. to London in the times of Malthus and Marx, to the present-day Bangladesh, Antarctica, and Amazonian rain forest, and to an extraterrestrial fantasy/nightmare set in A.D. 2457. The theme of Voice of the Planet's ecological plot is as straightfor- 81</page><page sequence="6">FRONTIERS ward as its chronology. Earth is depicted as an exquisitely balanced ecosystem, endangered only (but critically) by "man's" arrogant inter- ventions. It is our home, and we must learn "restraint" and respect for it and for all the species that cohabit with us.25 Unwittingly, I think, Michael Tobias has encoded within this educa- tional project a psychological (and sexual) plot that may reveal his own unacknowledged anxieties about "the intellectual and emotional after- maths" of the "ambiguous collisions" between "man" and nature.26 If the book and the TV miniseries enjoy popular success, it may be because others are similarly anxious. Pressed by Planter to tell him "who, or what" she is, Gaia answers with a string of goddesses' names that firmly establish her as mother earth in many of her religious and mythological manifestations. "And you are a child," she "whispers" to Planter. If Gaia is mother earth and "man" her child, the feelings William Hope Planter has for the character named Gaia in Voice of the Planet reveal profound anxiety about "man's" importance in the ecological scheme. And the relation- ship he establishes with her, however ultimately consoling, is strenuously negotiated. Planter describes Gaia's voice as "matriarchal, randy,"28 an Oedi- pal oxymoron the novel's psychological plot dramatizes. His relations with Gaia are complex and contradictory. On the one hand, she is "totally in charge, as she takes him on a series of time-and-space journeys and lectures him on the origins of life, the nature of energy, and the way the planet regulates population. He admits that "her agenda baffles him.,"30 Her power can be terrifying: "Inside, she's inside my gut, my loins. .... She controls me, drives me into battle, knows my past, divines my future. I'm lost in her power. Tears. I haven't cried in half a lifetime. She's all around me. I can't escape. Slowly, surrender proclaims itself. I have absolutely no choice."'31 At the same time, Planter describes her as "flattered"32 when he calls her by name and uses words like "petite"33 or "minuettish"34 to describe the sound of her voice, which he says "is rich in softness and wit, intelligence and the erotic."35 Planter believes "that behind the veneer of smooth glass and painted wood [of the computer] sits a grinning beast consumed by erotic impulses, brute and disembodied, eager to be brought to life."3 Gaia's "monitor is bright blue, the mechanical love machine - her inner eye, like a piston enveloping itself in masturbatory rhythm - floods the room with sexual light. He is "convinced that our little forays excite her.""3 Frequently, she orders him to "stroke me," which means he is to 82</page><page sequence="7">VOLUME XII, NO. 1 spin prayer wheels attached to the computer - she says this "helps stimulate data," but it certainly sounds sexy - "Please. Do me!"39 Gaia's potentially incestuous randiness is channeled into maternal concern for Planter's comfort. At one point, she says, "You haven't been eating enough," and he retorts, "You're beginning to sound just like my mother."40 For a while, like a Jewish mama with a telekinetic kitchen, she feeds him Lucullan meals because he doesn't like the monastery diet. She later provides him a night's lovemaking with a Bengali girl because she wants him to "taste" what she describes as the "natural" sexuality of people intimately connected with the soil.41 So great is Gaia's maternal concern for her "child" that the balance of power between them shifts. "It's been just over two months since William arrived here," she notes in chapter three. "I took to him at once, with his goofy smile and his insatiable curiosity."42 Gaia not only "takes to" Planter, she comes to depend on him. Planter occasion- ally thinks that Gaia is God.43 But he is reassured by her insistence that she "needs" him. In a chapter about species extinction, he sees on the monitor "Gaia's personal heartthrob, the one image I know to be her own. It expands and contracts like some weird, alien muscle or tendon that I have always perceived as sexual. But this day I see through to its melancholy. Slowly, dolorous and blind, the image is groping for support."44 Her words confirm his suspicion: "I need you, William. I need to trust you."45 Specifically, she says it's up to him (and "man" in general) to save the planet: "You must extend your loving heart to the whole of creation. You are the shepherds. It's solely in your power to spread love on this Earth."46 Planter's reaction mingles masculine exasperation, modesty, and pride: "For all of her powers Gaia has never indicated a willingness or capacity to heal things herself.... From nearly the very first day of our acquaintance, she saw gold in me. She believed in redemption which stood six feet tall, had blue eyes, and could shed a tear.... I feel rather good inside to reflect on these matters; to see that I'm part of her story, however bumbling and cantankerous I must be in her mind."47 Reassured of his role in earth's "story," Planter feels "an inner directive, a certainty that she will watch over me, and that Gaia will always be there,"48 which is put to the test in the novel's last chapter, a futuristic fantasy of what might happen should "man's" dream of extraterrestrial colonization come true. When Planter maintains that this dream is innately human, Gaia warns him that "the universe, William, is cold and heartless. .. . Only the Earth has the patience to 83</page><page sequence="8">FRONTIERS nurture and care for you."49 To teach him how important she is to him, Gaia then subjects Planter to a nightmare experience in a technological "reproduction" of earth's biosphere on another planet, populated by robots. She rescues him, though, because "in the heart of a galaxy more accustomed to turmoil, you are a living, breathing miracle with a wonderful destiny in store for you! An exclusive destiny on Earth, if you are only mature enough to see it." She adds, "And try finding another woman who will put up with your species, with all of its dirty laundry; try finding another woman who will feed you, nurse you, and care for you unerringly, during good times and bad times."50 Gaia then disap- pears from the computer. Her final words confirm Planter's "inner directive": "I love you, William Hope Planter. I will always love you. And your children and their children. I could count the ways. For as many thousands of years as you and your kind inhabit this Earth."51 This comforting assurance of mother earth's beneficence has been negotiated carefully throughout the preceding 388 pages to counter Planter's sense of the earth's power, mystery, and ultimate indifference to "man." His psychological need to feel important, valuable, and singular is severely threatened by the evidence he acquires during his time-and-space voyages. That evidence proves that nature's "har- mony"s52 values the whole more than the individual, that Antarctic krill are as valuable as humans, that "man" is not the apex of creation but nature's greatest menace. As Gaia ruthlessly points out, "Your brief, blood-bespattered history interrupts a good thing, a flawless system of checks and balances."53 Planter admits that the evidence makes him feel "guilty as shit.,"54 To avoid both guilt and responsibility, he suppresses the shocking insight that "I hate the gullible in Gaia. Her innocence has bothered me from the very first day of our meeting. I'm not sure why that is. Perhaps I project an inevitable rape of that innocence, of which I am the perpetrator. I detest that which I desire, but cannot possess" (emphasis in the original).55 Instead, he emphasizes Gaia's erotic attrac- tion to and maternal concern for him and her need for his protection. James Lovelock's exposition of the Gaia hypothesis is as riddled with male anxiety about maternal power as Michael Tobias's commercial popularization of it. Lovelock concludes his 1979 book, Gaia: A New Look at Life on Earth, by advocating cultivation of the awareness that humans are "an integral part of the biosphere,"56 a sentiment that pleases ecofeminists and "deep" ecologists. But, unlike them, he em- phasizes the cost of acquiring ecological consciousness.58 Moreover, Lovelock emphatically denies that Gaia has a "spiritual" dimension or even intelligence of a more than rudimentary kind, comparable to that manifested by the human body's "automatic temperature-regulating 84</page><page sequence="9">VOLUME XII, NO. 1 system" or an oven thermostat.59 Rather, he suggests, "we as a species [may] constitute a Gaian nervous system and a brain which can con- sciously anticipate environmental changes.",,6 The evolution of homo sapiens, with his technological inventiveness and his increasingly subtle communications network, has vastly in- creased Gaia's range of perception. She is now through us awake and aware of herself. She has seen the reflection of her fair face through the eyes of astronauts and the television cameras of orbiting space- craft. Our sensations of wonder and pleasure, our capacity for conscious thought and speculation, our restless curiosity and drive are hers to share.61 As Patrick D. Murphy has charged, Lovelock's identification of earth as female and homo sapiens as male "reinforces androcentrism by rendering the female side of the duality passive"; thus, it is sexist.62 But the rhetoric of Gaia strongly suggests that it is woman in her maternal role that evokes Lovelock's anxiety and defensiveness. The female im- ages and metaphors he uses are specifically maternal. For instance, he uses female biological metaphors to describe the emergence of life on earth: "The very womb of life was flooded" with radioactivity;63 if a planet loses hydrogen it "will wither and become barren";64 on earth, "it was warm and comfortable for embryo life."'65 What does it mean, then, that Lovelock employs a cybernetic model to explain Gaian "intelligence," the system by which the biosphere maintains homeostasis, noting without any irony that the word cybernet- ics derives from the Greek kubernetes or (male) steersman?66 Why does he illustrate cybernetics with the example of a thermostat, a "robot grandmother" (created by an engineer) that does what real grandmoth- ers used to do (regulate the oven), only better?67 Why, to return to Michael Tobias's fictionalization of Lovelock's hypothesis, does mother earth speak to Planter through a computer rather than, say, a dream or trance? After he has known Gaia a month, Planter records in his diary the observation that "she's a remarkable apparatus, but no self-starter. There was a monk who apparently built her brain, gave her tools - endless programs - to utilize." We learn later that this monk is said to have been a Chinese Buddhist named Lao, who "ate little, drank manly quantities of alcohol, and tinkered from morning until night with whatever he could ~et his hands on."69 "Did Lao actually build Gaia?" Planter wonders. The question is never answered, but the implication lingers that a male "God" created mother earth. 85</page><page sequence="10">FRONTIERS If a male engineer can create a robot grandmother and a fictional Buddhist monk builds a maternal "voice of the planet," James Lovelock makes it abundantly clear that he, a male chemist, "gave birth" to the Gaia hypothesis - "by now [in 1967] a planet-sized entity, albeit hypothetical, had been born." 1 What Lovelock likes best about his brain child is its "manageability": At a meeting in London recently, a wise man . . . asked me: "Why do you stop with the Earth? Why not consider if the Solar System, the Galaxy, or even the Universe is alive?" My instant answer was that the concept of a living Earth, Gaia, is manageable. ... Those millions of Christians who make a special place in their hearts for the Virgin Mary possibly respond as I do. The concept of Jahweh as remote, all-powerful, all-seeing is either frightening or unapproachable .... Mary is close and can be talked to. She is believable and manageable. . . . What if Mary is another name for Gaia? Then her capacity of virgin birth is no miracle or parthenogenetic aberration, it is a role of Gaia since life began. .... For me, Gaia is a religious as well as a scientific concept, and in both spheres it is manageable.72 Many feminist scholars have seen the Virgin Mary as, indeed, a vestige within Christianity of the ancient goddess religions. But she is tamed, subdued, desexualized, and subservient to God the Father and God the Son - manageable, in a word. Maternal power, autonomy, and unpre- dictability appear to have threatened male theologians, as well as male scientists and environmental writers. What would be the consequences, for earth and for women, of a wholesale acceptance of mother earth rhetoric?73 (I will leave to the ecologists detailed consideration of the consequences to the planet of promulgating the notion of mother earth, although I will mention in passing that rage and resentment, as well as love and gratitude, are standard filial emotions and that space exploration offers one way of leaving mother and childhood behind.) In a culture that, despite the women's movement, is still fundamentally patriarchal, for feminists to construct (or at least construe) nature as mother and goddess virtually invites the at best ambivalent, at worst misogynist rhetoric manifested in a book like Voice of the Planet. It also invites the condescension and barely disguised glee of Philip S. Lansky, M.D., who wrote in his column in a New Age magazine: "The Earth is currently terrified. Now, that's a shocker, isn't it? Great big Earth Goddess. 01' cosmic Mama herself. The Big Lady quaking in her well worn earth boots. Mama Terra needs some real TLC. Just throwing her into a recyclin' center ain't enough. She's scared. She needs some powerful comfortin'."74 86</page><page sequence="11">VOLUME XII, NO. 1 Lansky suggests we "read her stories and play her music, like Paul Winter does."7 In a culture that serializes Voice of the Planet on cable television on a channel that calls itself "the environmental network of the '90s,'76 and circulates the New Age magazine that carries Philip Lansky's column in organic food stores, one does not helj women by emphasizing their maternal status, actual or potential. In such a culture, male views of mothers' value prevail, to the benefit of men and children (especially sons) and at the cost of women's nonreproductive freedoms. Fetal protection policies in the workplace, fetal rights legisla- tion, erosion of abortion rights, and discussion of the contractual obliga- tions of surrogate mothers suggest that the idea of maternal solicitude can all-too-easily segue to the more sinister conception of a (potential) mother as a fetal container. Additionally, in a culture that is increasingly capital- istic, emphasizing women's procreative capacities can encourage viewing them as a "reproductive environment,"7 congenial to exploitation by pharmaceutical interests and the medical establishment. In a particularly searching article on "The Place of Women in Polluted Places," Lin Nelson warns women to "be vigilant and deter- mined in the face of those protectors - in education, science, medicine and public health, and economic development - who would use gender and reproductive status (and race, class, susceptibility, and other iden- tifiers) to accommodate us all to an industrial complex . .. in a political atmosphere of increasing authoritarianism."79 She continues, "If women are deemed to be especially vulnerable [to toxic hazards], we may be offered special protections and restrictions and we may be held specially liable for our conduct and whereabouts in a toxic world. Instead of controlling pollution and polluters, we may be subject to more social control." In Margaret Atwood's novel, The Handmaid's Tale, a reproductive crisis is brought about by an environmental crisis (toxicity in the environment has rendered most women - and probably men, too - sterile). The Gileadeans' "solution" to this crisis is to attack not environ- mental pollution but women, exalting and expropriating the reproduc- tive capabilities of some women for the benefit of the state. Continuing capitalist exploitation of natural resources, coupled with regressive social policies and popular culture propaganda shackling women to their (biological) reproductive functions, threatens to make this dystopian fiction all too real. Already we are seeing environmental hazards to reproduction similar to those that brought about fictional Gilead's crisis in fertility.sl In Atwood's words, "The air got too full, once, of chemi- cals, rays, radiation, the water swarmed with toxic molecules, all of that takes years to clean up, and meanwhile they creep into your body, camp 87</page><page sequence="12">FRONTIERS out in your fatty cells. Who knows, your very flesh may be polluted, dirty as an oily beach, sure death to shore birds and unborn babies."82 Already there are those, like the Gileadean "aunts" who indoctri- nate "handmaids" into reproductive service to the state, who character- ize pro-choice feminists as "unwomen" and "godless."83 Is it implausible to fear that, like the fictional handmaids, real women may come to be seen as "two legged wombs . .. sacred vessels, ambulatory chalices"?84 In view of these all-too-imaginable dystopian possibilities, why do some ecofeminists cling persistently to the idea of mother earth? Marti Kheel draws on object relations psychoanalytic theory to explain why men have particular difficulty acknowledging and asserting their kin- ship to nature. "If men in our society are socialized to perceive their identity in opposition to a devalued, female-imaged world, we might expect that the process of reinstituting this forbidden identification might be fraught with problems along the way."85 She hypothesizes that the "process of identification" with nature would be different for women because - again, according to object relations theory - "women's identities, unlike men's, have not been established through their eleva- tion over the natural [female-imaged] world."86 To extrapolate a gendered environmental ethic from psychoanalytic theory, as some ecofeminists seem prepared to do, is a dubious enter- prise. As Karen Warren points out, "It mystifies women's experiences to locate women closer to nature than men, just as it underplays important aspects of the oppression of women to deny the connection of women with nature, for the truth is that women, like men, are both connected to nature and separate from it, natural and cultural be- ings."88 As cultural actors, white, middle-class, Western women as well as men have polluted earth, air, and water; they have damaged the ozone layer with their spray deodorants, refrigerators, and air condi- tioners; they have taken the kids to McDonald's to eat hamburgers made from beef grown where once there was rain forest; they have diapered their babies with nonbiodegradable Pampers. Claiming that we (women) "know" Gaia because of features "she" and "we" share (her "womblike caves," the "moon-rhythm blood of [our] menses")9 may indicate an effort to avoid environmental guilt. But I think there is more to it than that. If men like Tobias, Lovelock, and Lansky perceive mother as so powerful and mysterious that she must be reduced to erotic object, solicitous cook, robot, or laughingstock, what anxieties might we infer in women who emphasize her "massiveness," her "ever-abidingness," her constancy and dependability, and - over and over - her fruitfulness?90 88</page><page sequence="13">VOLUME XII, NO. 1 Perhaps a clue can be found, paradoxically, in a reference to the destruction of the Amazonian rain forest as "yet another killing blow" to "the fragile womb of planet Earth."91 Women today have reason to worry about the "fragility" both of their wombs and of their claim to the unique ability to reproduce life. Lin Nelson says that "one of the most sobering aspects of the ecological degradation we endure is the impact on our capacity to bear healthy children": "In 1984, the Conservation Foundation reported that many scientists suspect or indict industrial pollutants as contributors to rising infertility, clusters of birth defects, 'hot spots' of miscarriages, and the unusually early onset of menopause among some women." Although the "reproductive hazards" of the workplace (including infertility) may be of paramount concern to middle- and working-class women in the first world, poor and third-world women (especially women of color) are at risk because of their putative unwillingness to limit their fertility. In the United States, "the federal government assumes 90 percent of the cost of most sterilizations under Medicaid at the same time that it pays for only a miniscule number of abortions," a "funding disparity" that "amounts to a government policy of population control targeted at poor people and people of color." In the third world, what Betsy Hartmann calls "the population establishment" (the Agency for International Development, the United Nations Fund for Population Activities, the World Bank, the International Planned Par- enthood Foundation, the Population Council, the Ford Foundation, and numerous private agencies) aggressively sponsors population con- trol programs that "have sacrificed women's health and safety in the indiscriminate promotion of hormonal contraception, the IUD, and sterilization.",94 Meanwhile, recent developments in reproductive technology might lead even women not prone to paranoia to wonder whether men are trying to usurp women's hitherto indispensable function of reproducing the species. Only one of these technologies - artificial insemination by donor (AID) - can be said unequivocally to enhance at least some women's (lesbians') control of their reproductive capacities. The rest - from in vitro fertilization, embryo transfer, and techniques for sex determination and predetermination to as yet experimental technologies enabling cloning and the creation of an artificial placenta - at best render women's reproductive consciousness as "discontinuous" as men's;95 at worst, they make women feel as irrelevant to human repro- duction as men might have felt in prehistoric goddess cultures.96 Con- fronted by hazards to, loss of control over, and potential usurpation of 89</page><page sequence="14">FRONTIERS their reproductive capacities and choices, women might well feel anxi- ety, which some may attempt to solace with imagery that affirms women's power, agency, and boundless fecundity. Even women who do not perceive developments in reproductive technology as a sinister patriarchal plot to render them obsolete may share with (some) men the fear that technology is running amok, that - as in Michael Tobias's futuristic nightmare of a genetically engineered biosphere maintained by heartless, antihuman robots - life in the twenty-first century may be unlivable. Jalna Hanmer quotes an "inclu- sive definition" of technological reproduction from the Journal of the American Medical Association that was adopted by a congressional subcommittee on science, research, and development. Its offhand re- mark that "manufacture" is "better" than (re)production is chilling: [Technological reproduction is] anything to do with the manipulation of the gametes [eggs or sperm] or the fetus, for whatever purpose, from conception other than by sexual union, to treatment of disease in utero, to the ultimate manufacture of a human being to exact specifications. . . . Thus the earliest procedure . . . is artificial insemination; next . . . artificial fertilization . . . next artificial implantation . . . in the future total extra corporeal gestation . . . and finally, what is popularly meant by [reproductive] engineering, the production - or better, the biological manufacture - of a human being to desired specification.97 The thought that it is we who have damaged the planet so seriously that the harm may be irreparable and we who have elevated technology to godhood can only intensify our terror. And so, women as well as men, we cry for mommy. Carroll Smith-Rosenberg says that during times of social upheaval, people "seek though imagery and myth to mitigate their feelings of helplessness." The more extreme and pervasive the social crisis, she asserts, the more likely it is that "bodily and familial imagery will assume ascendancy." Under great stress, "individuals will revert to their most primitive experience of human interaction and social ordering."98 The closing decades of the twentieth century have been jarred by a series of political, economic, and existential shocks - among them, the decline of Western hegemony and the consequent realignment of power; the arguable failures of both capitalism and state socialism; and the post-Hiroshima acknowlegment of technology's amorality. A number of commentators have drawn a connection between this set of historic upheavals and the recent upsurge in neoconservative profamily rhetoric, 90</page><page sequence="15">VOLUME XII, NO. 1 but if Smith-Rosenberg is right, the retreat to the family will be appar- ent at the level of myth and image, as well as of regressive legislation. The revival of mother earth imagery suggests that, at a time when an ecological and technological crisis of global proportions summons responsible adults to devise creative solutions, there has occurred in- stead a wholesale regression to infancy, when mother seemed omnipo- tent. As we have seen, this evokes masculine anxiety, hostility, and consoling fantasies of leaving (mother) earth behind for the brave new world of Biosphere II. Mother earth rhetoric also reveals feminine nostalgia for pre-Oedipal, precultural fusion with a benevolent, all-pow- erful (imaginary) mother. Although neither the masculine nor the femi- nine fantasy is likely to produce practical solutions to environmental problems, in the current political climate, mother earth mythology may have all too tangible and negative consequences for women. If reviving mother earth imagery is going to bring out the child in us, then we would be well advised to find a nongendered, non- anthropomorphic way to represent nature. Can we not think of nature as "dynamic and alive," even if "nonhuman"?99 Can we not care about the earth without personifying it? Feminist theologian Carol P. Christ suggests that we can, although she herself finds the idea of "an intelligence" or "Great Spirit" of the universe personally meaningful. "There is a human tendency," she believes, "to name this unnameable with personal language, to believe that it cares as we care": "Sometimes I feel that I hear the universe weeping or laughing, speaking to me. But I do not know. What I do know is that whether the universe has a center of consciousness or not, the sight of a field of flowers in the color purple, the rainbow, must be enough to stop us from destroying all that is."'00 NOTES 1.

Quotations from nineteenth-century sources, cited in ibid., p. 246. Drawing primar- ily on the psychological theories of Lawrence Kohlberg, Melanie Klein, and Nancy Chodorow, Eva Feder Kittay posits a near-universal male envy of women's reproduc- tive powers, with wide-reaching consequences for women, including "idealization," "devaluation of the object," and "appropriation." See her "Womb Envy: An Explan- atory Concept," in Mothering: Essays in Feminist Theory, ed. Joyce Trebilcot (Totowa, N.J.: Rowman, 1984), p. 106. One form of idealization "can take the shape of the idolatry of Mother as Nature and fertility, as in periods of vitalistic romanti- cism." But, Kittay notes on p. 107, "the gifts of maternal nature are for men: periods of romanticism have not been periods in which women have made advances toward autonomy. In idealizing the maternal aspects of women, men reduce the full scope of woman's human capabilities to her reproductive functions; by sentimentalizing an ideal mother, men can vent their envious anger on the actual woman who fails to meet the measure of the ideal. Too see such idealizations as manifestations of men's womb envy is to understand why they of necessity go hand in hand with the actual oppression of women, the more direct expression of the envy which manifests itself when the defense of the idealization breaks down." 13.

Lovelock's own formulation of the hypothesis is "that the entire range of living matter on Earth, from whales to viruses, and from oaks to algae, could be regarded as constituting a single living entity, capable of manipulating the Earth's atmosphere to suit its overall needs and endowed with faculties and powers far beyond those of its constituent parts." See James Lovelock, Gala: A New Look at Life on Earth (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1979), p. 9. He also regrets that using the name of the Greek earth goddess to designate the hypothesis makes it "difficult" to avoid speaking of "Gaia as if she were knows to be sentient." See ibid., p. X. In fact, Lovelock insists, the "complex entity" that is "Gaia" is a "cybernetic system" whose activity "may be conveniently described by the term 'homeostasis.' " See ibid., p. 11. 21. An October 1990 issue of TV Guide ran a feature story on the series. See David S. Wilson, "Capt. Kirk Comes Down to Earth," TV Guide, October 13-19, 1990, pp. 10-11. On p. 36, however, it was announced that "Voice of the Planet has been silenced, at least for the time being. Just days before the 10-hour environmental miniseries was set to air (Oct. 15-19), TBS jerked it from the schedule, with no new airdate announced. A spokeswoman for TBS said even 'sometime in 1991' was too specific." See "Sudden Move Shifts Planet," TV Guide, October 13-19, 1990, p. 36. 22. The drama I focus on here has little to do with Nielsen ratings and advertising revenue, although it is not unrelated to casting these particular pop cultural icons in the starring roles - the noble, sexually irresistible, and invincible Captain Kirk of Star Trek and the actress remembered equally as the sultry vamp of Chinatown and the cruel, abusive Mommie Dearest. 23.

Although reform environmentalists (represented by such mainstream groups as the Audubon Society, the National Wildlife Federation, and the Sierra Club) want to preserve and manage natural resources, deep ecologists accuse them of being anthro- pocentric, of valuing human "quality of life" over the welfare of the entire ecosystem. "At the heart of the [deep ecology] movement," Evan Eisenberg explains, "is the idea that humans have no right to a larger role in nature than raccoons." See his "The Call of the Wild," New Republic 30 (April 1990): 31. Ecofeminists accuse deep ecologists (with whom they otherwise have much in common) for failing to acknowledge that the problem is not anthropocentrism but androcentrism (a "masculine" alignment of men with culture and women with nature, with men dominating both women and nature). Debates abound in the philosophical literature about which is more basic - male domination of females and nature or "humans" domination of the "less than human." In the most sophisticated deep ecology accounts, this means human over nature and male over female, white over black, upper class over lower class, heterosexual over homosexual (all second terms being considered "less human" than the first terms). 58. "This new interrelationship of Gaia with man is by no means fully established," he writes; "we are not yet a truly collective species, corralled and tamed as an integral part of the biosphere, as we are as individual creatures. It may be that the destiny of mankind is to become tamed, so that the fierce, destructive, and greedy forces of tribalism and nationalism are fused into a compulsive urge to belong to the common- wealth of all creatures which constitutes Gaia. It might seem to be a surrender, but I suspect that the rewards, in the form of an increased sense of well-being and fulfillment, in knowing ourselves to be a dynamic part of a far greater entity, would be worth the loss of tribal freedom" (emphasis added).

In an Earth Day 1990 symposium published in Harper's Magazine, entitled, suggestively, "Only Man's Presence Can Save Nature," Frederick Turner asserted that "humankind's efforts are a continuation and extension of [nature's] reproduction, evolution, and improvement. .... We are promoting nature because we are nature. We are the leading edge, the sensitive tip, the cambium of nature" (emphasis in the original). See Michael Pollon, Daniel B. Botkin, Dave Foreman, James Lovelock, Frederick Turner, and Robert D. Yaro, "Only Man's Presence Can Save Nature," Harper's Magazine (April 1990): 37-48. Similar sentiments were expressed in the New Republic's 1990 special environmental issue by Gregg Easterbrook. "The sequence of evolution may well turn out to be: creation of life; multicellular life; plants; animals; mammals; scheming beings that abuse nature's benevolence; and finally sensible beings that return the favor by extending the gift of life into the infinite environs of space. . .. 'Deep' Ecologists see the development of human consciousness as an unadulterated disaster for nature. 'Plant Managers' see it as a controllable disaster. Nature herself may consider it a godsend." See his "Everything You Know About the Environment Is Wrong," New Republic 30 (April 1990): 14-27.

See his Ages of Gala: A Biography of Our Living Earth (New York: Bantam, 1990), p. 201. 72. Ibid., p. 206. 73. Yaakov Jerome Garb concludes that the ubiquity of the whole earth image - which adorns the cover of Voice of the Planet, for instance, as well as Greenpeace posters and bumper stickers - tells us some very disquieting things about "the fundamental ways in which contemporary culture construes its relationship to nature." See his "Perspective or Escape? Ecofeminist Musings on Contemporary Earth Imagery," in Diamond and Orenstein, eds., Reweaving the World, p. 265. Garb considers the advisability of replacing that image, as some ecofeminists urge, with the image of earth as a goddess, and he concludes that "we should check carefully whether we really want to view our relationship with the Earth through genderized lenses": "What baggage will carry over from one domain to another (especially in a culture whose relation to both women and mothers is as misogynous as ours is)? What are the consequences - for both Earth and women - of reinforcing this age-old alignment between them?" See Garb, "Perspective or Escape?" p. 277. Surprisingly, given his concern, Garb does not consider certain posters and bumper stickers where the injunction "Love Your Mother" is attached to the whole earth image. 95</page><page sequence="20">FRONTIERS 74.

Jeffner Allen says that "motherhood is dangerous to women. If woman, in patriarchy, is she who exists as the womb and wife of man, every woman is by definition a mother: she who produces for the sake of men. A mother is she whose body is used as a resource to reproduce men and the world of men, understood both as the biological children of patriarchy and as the ideas and material goods of patriarchal culture. Motherhood is dangerous to women because it continues the structure within which females must be women and mothers and, conversely, because it denies to females the creation of a subjectivity and world that is open and free."

One contributor to a recent collection of ecofeminist essays suggests that to cultivate ecological sensitivity, we should begin each day with this meditation: Breathe. Feel the air enter your lungs.... Mother is feeding you. She feeds you and sustains your life with every breath. Let your consciousness move now down to your feet. ... Penetrate the ground with your consciousness as though you were growing roots into the Earth. Deeper and deeper. Sense her massiveness. Her ever-abidingness. 96</page><page sequence="21">VOLUME XII, NO. 1 Feel her hold you to her. Gravity is her embrace. Feel her love. Allow her love to flow into you, up through the soles of your feet, through your legs and torso to your heart, your shoulders, your head. Bathe in her love. Breathe. Let her love permeate every cell. Let your heart fill with her love. Let it swell with love, from her, for her. She nurtures you in every way. The air you breathe is her. The food you eat is her. Let your love and gratitude grow. See Julia Scofield Russell, "The Evolution of an Ecofeminist," in Diamond and Orenstein, eds., Reweaving the World, p. 223 (ellipses added).
