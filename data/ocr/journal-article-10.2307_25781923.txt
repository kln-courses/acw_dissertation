<plain_text><page sequence="1">BECKETT AND PHILOSOPHY, 1928-1938 Matthew Feldman This article argues that the direct relationship between 'Beckett and philosophy' - meaning Samuel Beckett's struggle with Western philosophy as it influenced his poetics and outlook - lasted only a decade, from 1928 to 1938. The methodology deployed in support of this account is established at the outset: falsifiability. Such a 'modified essentialism' allows for an empirically-grounded theorising that is of substantial assistance in tracing Beckett's intellectual 'debts.' The falsifiable position taken here, then, contends that Beckett's self-education in the European philosophical tradition can be divided into three stages which, in turn, closely correspond to Beckett's artistic and intellectual development in the later 1920s and 1930s. As this article revisits Beckett's relationship with philosophy, it is useful to start out by revisiting two quotations that are equally familiar and misleading. Ten years after the Unnamable's savaging of philosophical "college quips" - "They must consider me sufficiently stupefied with all their balls about being and existing" (Beckett 1979, 320) - Beckett further effaced his relationship with philosophy by claiming an ignorance many critics have found difficult to square with his art. And indeed, even if the specifics of his remarks are broadly accurate, the strong implication that Beckett was a philosophical novice must be regarded as untenable: Have contemporary philosophers had any influence on your thought? -1 never read philosophers. Why not? -1 never understand anything they write. All the same, people have wondered if the existentialists' problem of being may afford a key to your works. - There's no key or problem. I wouldn't have had any reason to write my novels if I could have expressed their subject in philosophic terms. (SB to Gabriel D'Aubarede, 16 Feb. 1961, qtd. in Graver and Federman, 217)</page><page sequence="2">164 Matthew Feldman One cannot speak anymore of being, one must speak only of the mess. When Heidegger and Sartre speak of a contrast between being and existence, they may be right, I don't know, but their language is too philosophical for me. I am not a philosopher. One can only speak of what is in front of him, and that now is simply the mess. (SB to Tom Driver, Summer 1961, qtd. in Graver and Federman, 219) Beckett's evasion over whether or not philosophers have actually influenced his thought is underscored by the ambiguity of 'read,' serving both present and past tenses. It will be argued here that, while it may be fairly said that Beckett was not reading philosophers for influence in the present tense by 1961, he had certainly read, and derived sizeable influence from, philosophy in the past tense. Undertaken over ten years of essentially self-directed study between 1928 and 1938, this was a time in Beckett's life when the contrast between being and existence, for example, was not at all too philosophical to engage with. In fact, in the context of this themed volume on "Samuel Beckett's Debts and Legacies," it bears remem bering that the study of Western philosophy served a 'debt' of substantial measure over this formative period of Beckett's artistic development. Before substantiating these claims by recounting Beckett's direct relationship with philosophy in the interwar years, however, an aside is necessary at the outset regarding the methodological approach undertaken here, that of 'falsifiability.' In doing so, I again appeal to Karl Popper's deductive approach to evidence - at its most basic, the "purely logical" possibility of refuting an argument - which he saw as the decisive principle in increasing humanistic knowledge, a self-reflective practice he called, later in life, "modified essentialism": The fundamental difference between my approach and the approach for which I long ago introduced the label 'inductivist' is that I lay stress on negative arguments, such as negative instances or counter-examples, refutations, and attempted refutations - in short, criticism - while the inductivist lays stress on 'positive instances', from which he draws 'non-demonstrative inferences,' and which he hopes will guarantee the 'reliability' of the conclusions of these inferences.1</page><page sequence="3">Beckett and Philosophy, 1928-1938 165 Transposed into literary terms, I have argued (2009b) that a methodological critique of what constitutes 'evidence' in Beckett Studies, in turn, raises the following questions: i) Does a falsifiable approach to the task of generating empirical knowledge of a given subject have any place in the study of literature? ii) What kind of responsibility does the literary critic have toward historical contextualisation or 'facts'? iii) What makes one theory of Beckett's art more heuristically useful, or one containing greater 'explanatory power,' than another? iv) Is there a difference between advancing empirical knowledge of Beckett and his works, and critically exploring a 'Beckettian' contemporary world? For Popper, "how to adjudicate or decide among competing theories or beliefs leads [...] to the problem of distinguishing between, or of demarcating, rational theories and irrational beliefs" (1985, 161-62). More to the point, one of Popper's major achievements was in offering a template for constructing theories - not a theory itself per se (at least 'theory' as these are normally construed by all but radical sceptics like Fritz Mauthner, nihilists like Gorgias of Leontini, and perhaps the more counterfactual of postmodern critics). Albeit long overdue, his general position reminds literary studies that it too is a humanistic discipline, one where it is always preferable to theorise from a position of empirical accuracy rather than arguing in an "uncritical manner"; to seek arguments able to be disproved rather than simply finding verification in accordance with one's preferred readings, or outlook, or politics: A Marxist could not look at a newspaper without finding verifying evidence of the class struggle on every page, from the leaders to the advertisements; and he also would find it, especially, in what the paper failed to say. And a psychoanalyst, whether Freudian or Adlerian, assuredly would tell you that he finds his theories daily, even hourly, verified by his clinical observations. But were these theories testable? Were these analyses really better tested than, say, the frequently 'verified' horoscopes of the astrologers? What conceivable event would falsify them in the</page><page sequence="4">166 Matthew Feldman eyes of their adherents? Was not every conceivable event a 'verification'? It was precisely this fact - that they always fitted, that they were always 'verified' - which impressed their adherents. It began to dawn on me that this apparent strength was in fact a weakness, and that all these 'verificationists' were too cheap to count as arguments. The method of looking for verifications seemed to me unsound - indeed, it seemed to me to be the typical method of a pseudo-science. I realized the need for distinguishing this method as clearly as possible from that other method - that is, the method of criticism, the method of looking for falsifying instances. (Popper 1983, 162-63) Having gestured at this interpretative approach, to quote from Beckett's unpublished article late August 1938, "Les Deux Besoins," "let's get on with falsifying." As "The Two Needs" is one of the chronological bookends of this article (see Pilling 2006, 81), it is worth recalling Beckett's conclusion on that holy reasoning, this slippery and dangerous place. Nothing less resembles the creative process than these convulsions of enraged vermin, propulsed in spasms of judgment towards a rotting election. For in the enthymemes of art, it's the conclusions which are lacking, not the premisses. Pending new advice. (Beckett 1984, 57; private translation) By the autumn of 1938, exhausted of external advice, Beckett had come to view reason as inimical to his artistic process. And with this realisation - along with the critical shift to writing in French (evidenced in both the unpublished "Les Deux Besoins" article and the "Petit Sot" series of poems) - Beckett had returned full-circle to his position of ten years earlier: engaging with philosophy was no longer a necessity for his artistic purposes. However, the key difference between 1928 and 1938 was that Beckett had come to this artistic insight via a position of knowledge instead of philosophical superficiality; or better still, through the embrace of what Fritz Mauthner termed "learned ignorance" (qtd. in Janik and Toulmin 1973, 126). The falsifiable argument here, in short, is that the influence of philosophy upon Beckett was a short and intense affair, one that both started and ended</page><page sequence="5">Beckett and Philosophy, 1928-1938 167 in interwar Paris. Of course, philosophical themes were to recur across Beckett's oeuvre again and again, right up to his death in 1989. But these were artistic reformulations of the work he had done in the pivotal decade leading to the outbreak of war in Europe. Thereafter, Beckett's philosophical development ceased, and only philosophical reinfor cement is in extant evidence - such as a rereading of Arthur Schopenhauer in the late 1970s/early 1980s "Sottisier" Notebook, or more contentiously, his later reading of Ludwig Wittgenstein.2 Yet as The Philosophy of Samuel Beckett emphasises, this need not preclude a separate area of study; namely, consideration of Beckett as a kind of philosopher-poet. At the outset of his 2002 monograph, John Calder argues, for example, that "Beckett was the last of the great stoics" (1). In terms of outlook, this may well be spot on; certainly many scholars have recognised it as a keystone of Beckett's humanistic temperament. Yet as I have been trying to suggest thus far, this general question of philosophical outlook is a matter separate from 'Beckett and philosophy,' strictly speaking. The latter relationship - in terms drawn from Beckett's 1932-33 "Philosophy Notes" - may be better characterised as one of scepticism rather than stoicism: Stoicism a return to Socratic position via the cynics. Practical virtue implies a certain positive disposition of the soul. Whereas cynics emphasised negative aspect of Sage's well-being (independence of health, wealth, etc.), Stoics emphasised positive aspect (ultra-joyfill &amp; -sorrowful tranquillity). [... But sceptics] resist the seducements to opinion and action. He knows that nothing can be affirmed as to phenomena, that no opinion may be assented to, and so restrains himself from judgment, and thereby from action. In the suspension of judgment he finds imperturbability, rest within himself, ataraxy. The sceptics were called "The Suspenders."3 By coming to his own sceptical position of 'learned ignorance' with regard to philosophy - precisely through a sustained period of philosophical self-education - Beckett had reached what was to become the most profound armistice with Western Philosophy in modern literature. To again quote from Beckett's transcriptions from the critical summer months of 1938, one of the inspirations for this "self</page><page sequence="6">168 Matthew Feldman destruction of the metaphorical," Fritz Mauthner, had this to say about what he regarded as the greatest form of "epistemological nominalism": Whatever the human may dare to do through superhuman strength in order to discover truth, he always finds only himself, a human truth, an anthropomorphic picture of the world. The last word of thought can only be the negative act, the self-destruction of anthropomorphism, the insight into the profound wisdom of Vico: not everything is intelligible to men.4 Vico was, of course, one of the very first philosophers the 22-year old Beckett was to consult upon arriving in France as an English lecteur at the Ecole Normale in November 1928. The early celebration of James Joyce, leading to the 1929 "Dante...Bruno. Vico.. Joyce," ensured that these Italian demolishers of dialectical contraries (such as speed and rest) were Beckett's first real, if superficial, engagement with philosophy. This point has been made in Deirdre Bair's 1978 biography, where Beckett, in a letter of 24 October 1974, "stressed he did not study philosophy" prior to leaving Ireland: "Because he had not taken a philosophy course at Trinity College, which he felt was a serious defect in his education, he set out on what he thought was a systematic schedule of readings" (Bair, 96, 694). Eclipsing Beckett's fleeting interest in Descartes evident in the first half of 1930, and indeed returned to all of his life thereafter, was Schopenhauer. This was so much the case that Mark Nixon, for one, already detected an "aesthetic of unhappiness" in the Proust monograph sent to Chatto &amp; Windus at the end of that year. While Beckett, as he wrote to MacGreevy on 25[?] July 1930, doubtless found Schopen hauer's "intellectual justification of unhappiness" (2009, 33) of no small personal interest, his engagement went still further intellectually (Nixon, 69). For one of Schopenhauer's great concerns was to be taken up by Beckett in the ensuing eight years of philosophical study, tirelessly set out, for example, in the opening pages of the World as Will and Representation, volume 2: Subjective and objective do not form a continuum. That of which we are immediately conscious is bounded by the skin, or rather by the extreme ends of the nerves proceeding from the cerebral system. Beyond this lies a world of which we have no other knowledge than that gained through pictures in our mind. Now the</page><page sequence="7">Beckett and Philosophy, 1928-1938 169 question is whether and to what extent a world existing indepen dently corresponds to these pictures. (2: 10) More than any other issue, this was the backbone for Beckett's ensuing philosophical thinking to 1938; namely, the relationship between subject and object. Much of this engagement has been impressively covered in Erik Tonning's Samuel Beckett's Abstract Drama (30ff), and only certain features will be recounted here in turning to that meaty period of Beckett and philosophy: the 1930s. Stirring above this clashing of philosophical dialectics, now taking on real significance, were seemingly superficial changes to the style of what Beckett called, in summer 1931, "the old demon of note-snatching" (qtd. in Pilling 1999, xiii). Correspondingly, Beckett's relationship with philosophy may be argued to have gone through three distinct, if overlapping, stages - as registered across his "Interwar Notes." The first phase of Beckett's philosophical development seems to have petered out around the completion of Dream of Fair to Middling Women in summer 1932, as Beckett was moving away from James Joyce. Dirk Van Hulle has aptly described Beckett's process at this time as intellectual treasure hunting for what he has dubbed "linguistic oddities" (2006, 285). Emphatically bearing this out is John Pilling's edited Beckett's Dream Notebook, composed by Beckett between 1930 and 1931 from a melange of sources. On the whole, very few philosophical sources are in evidence here, even with a generous definition of 'philosophy' embracing St. Augustine's Confessions and Robert Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy. Other 'philosophical' texts noted from this explicitly Joycean period and recycled for Dream - and, as Pilling shows, sometimes for More Pricks than Kicks - include surveys such as W. R. Inge's Christian Mysticism, and interestingly, the final text noted (excluding Tennyson/Chaucer poems from which the abortive book's title is derived), the far more philosophically-directed, indeed Nietzschean, 1930 edition of Jules de Gaultier's From Kant to Nietzsche, giving especial attention to the "relation between object &amp; its representation, between the stimulus &amp; molecular disturbance, between percipi and percipere" (qtd. in Pilling 1999, 165). To be sure, the vexing relation between subject and object persisted in Beckett's notes beyond the completion of Dream in summer 1932. At this point, a post-Joycean period of systematic summarisation seems to have commenced with a trip to England in</page><page sequence="8">170 Matthew Feldman July-August 1932, when Beckett first read in the British Library. Again depending on how widely one wishes to contextualise this second phase, Beckett's synoptic readings over the next four years were of more structured note-taking extended to a variety of subjects, revealed by such texts as R. H. Wilenski's An Introduction to Dutch Art, John G. Robertson's A History of German Literature, and Robert Woodworth's Contemporary Schools of Psychology. For present purposes, however, nothing rivals the 267 folios - mostly recto and verso - comprising Beckett's "Philosophy Notes," likely ranging from summer 1932 to later 1933. Betraying a deep interest in the formation of these philosophical dualisms in the Western canon, two of Beckett's three texts specifically covered, in detail, the origins of Western Philosophy: the entirety of John Burnet's 1914 Greek Philosophy, Part I: Thales to Plato, and Archibald Alexander's 1907 A Short History of Philosophy - at least until he tired of Alexander's prosaic account in the second century A.D. Yet from the era of the Alexandrians (e.g. Justin Martyr and St. Ignatius) right up until Nietzsche, Beckett's knowledge of Western philosophy was mediated by one book, perhaps one of a handful of those most significant to Beckett's development, Wilhelm Windelband's revised 1901 A History of Philosophy. Unlike Alexander's narrative, Windelband's lively writing recounts something of a philosophical story that is "a connected and interrelated whole"; meaning that in "some direction and in every fashion every philosophy has striven to reach, over a more or less extensive field, a formulation in conception of the material given in the world and in life. [...] How conceptions and forms have been coined, in which we all, in every-day life as well as in the particular sciences, think and judge the world of our experience" (Windelband, x, 9-10). Needless to say, this is a locating of subject-object relations at the very core of Western philosophy, one born "out of the conceptions which the Greek mind wrested from the concrete reality found in Nature and human life," and to which, for Windelband, only Immanuel Kant has rivalled since Greek antiquity. In turn, Beckett devoted 13 recto and verso sides to Windelband's 14 pages (537-50) setting out his view of Kant's greatest contribution: "the only object of human knowledge is experience, i.e. phenomenal experience. The distinction prevailing since Plato between noumena and phenomena has no meaning. Knowledge of things in themselves through 'sheer reason,' extension beyond experience, is a chimera." Indeed, for Windelband,</page><page sequence="9">Beckett and Philosophy, 1928-1938 171 questions of epistemology and concept formation were the very marks of Kant's genius, providing no less than the fundamental antithesis between Kant and Greek theory of knowledge, which had prevailed up till that time in its view of the "objects" as given independently of thought. Kant the first to discover that the objects of thought are themselves the products of thought. [...] Kant proceeds from antithesis between activity of the understanding and sensuous perception. Categorical thinking rela tes the data of perception so that every phenomena is conditioned by other phenomena. [...] Thus the relation between sensibility and understanding involving necessary but insoluble problems. (TCD MS 10967/225v-228r, corresponding to Windelband, 543-49) The information gleaned from the absolutely pivotal Windelband also crucially prepared Beckett for the final phase of his "Interwar Notes"; that of verbatim transcription. Thus, for example, the earliest extant, lengthy transcriptions are taken in January-April 1936 from Arnold Geulincx's complete works - edited by J. P. N. Land between 1891 and 1893 as Arnold Geulincx Opera Philosophica - who was previously identified as an unfairly obscured, if hugely iconoclastic, contributor to the subject-object discussion structuring Western philosophy: The ultimate "cause" for causal connection between stimuli and sensations, purpose and action, is God. This is Occasionalism. This furthest developed in Ethics of Geulincx [...] Geulincx reduces self-activity to immanent mental activity of man. The "autology" or inspectio sui is not only epistemological starting point, it is also ethical conclusion of his system. Man has nothing to do in outer world. Ubi nihil vales, ibi nihil velis.5 This is the first place where this famous formulation occurs in Beckett's hand, later quoted in a letter to Sighle Kennedy of 1967 and reprinted in Disjecta. This book was of a lifetime's service to Beckett, if indirectly mediated through his "Philosophy Notes." For instance, the famous epigraph to chapter 6 of Murphy, describing that eponymous character's mind, is based upon a footnote to Windelband's discussion</page><page sequence="10">172 Matthew Feldman of post-Cartesianism, forming the "ethical part of the Spinozistic system as amor intellectualis quo deus se ipsum amaf (410). Returning to an earlier point, it is worth pausing here to again note that Descartes's descendants were of far greater philosophical interest - and of far more durable and demonstrable influence - than that of the pastiched protagonist from the 1930 "Whoroscope." Alongside Geulincx's discussion of humility, for example, Tonning justly locates another "surprisingly central figure" in Beckett's philosophical development from this period: Gottfried Leibniz (203ff). Though described as a "great cod" to Thomas MacGreevy when first encountered two years earlier (Beckett 2009, 172), by December 1935 and the midway point in the writing of Murphy, it seems, Beckett's Leibniz (or better, Beckett's Leibniz as mediated by the centripetal neo Kantian, Wilhelm Windelband) appears to have nonetheless helped suture philosophy and psychoanalysis around a "windowless monad" of self-contained, individual consciousness. As Tonning's extensive coverage of this still under-appreciated influence from Beckett's interwar years adjudges, "monads are thus condemned to endless, unfulfilled striving," in a sort of philosophical shorthand for Beckett's sense of psychological anomie, so heightened during his two years of thrice-weekly psychotherapy with Wilfred Bion at this time (qtd. in Tonning, 213; see also Katrin Wehling-Giorgi's contribution to this volume). Moreover, citations from the very different post-Cartesians Blaise Pascal and Baruch Spinoza also appear in the "Whoroscope" Notebook - Beckett's commonplace book from the 1930s, a key intellectual repository for entries on art and philosophy - with entries for the latter deriving from several different sources.6 As another letter to MacGreevy (of 19 September 1936) reveals, it was Spinoza and "his contemporaries" (the Anglophone title of a French text Beckett consulted at this time) that piqued Beckett's interest at the time. Indeed, he even felt so moved as to report "a glimpse of Spinoza as a solution &amp; a salvation" - itself later personalised as the "Spinoza formulation - solution congruence" in a "German Diary" entry from the next year.7 Many of these entries from the Spinozan milieu, in turn, have little to do with Descartes's famed, if unresolved, philosophical relationship of mind to body. For what appears to have attracted Beckett at this time were the differing and, interestingly, subsequent, philosophical struggles with questions over how the mind could adequately represent the world outside it. Whether in the ideas of Nicholas Malebranche,</page><page sequence="11">Beckett and Philosophy, 1928-1938 173 Leibniz, Geulincx or Spinoza, it seems, the post-Cartesians were variously pointing to the interplay of mind and matter, of a perceiving subject, that Beckett was himself struggling with, as he duly copied into his "Whoroscope" Notebook: "Whence it is clearly to be seen, that measure, time and number, are merely modes of thinking, or, rather, of imagining'; and again, "a circle is different from the idea of a circle ... nor is the idea of a body that body itself."8 In the months following the completion of Murphy in summer 1936, Beckett's jottings were largely confined to his six volumes of "German Diaries" taken during his travels in Nazi Germany from October 1936 to April 1937. Yet even whilst travelling abroad in the mid-1930s, the subject-object problematic was not far from his mind, whether in terms of recording a conversation about "the fence between the big and little worlds" in October 1936, or notes on Franz Marc's "subject, predicate, object relations" in painting in mid-November 1936, and so on (qtd. in Feldman 2009a, 26). Yet after returning from Germany, it seems, Beckett's "Whoroscope" Notebook formed the central notebook of choice for many of these transcriptions - all far shorter than the 15,000 words of elliptical Latin taken, in ascending order, from Geulincx's Questions Concerning Disputations, Metaphysics, and of most importance, his Ethics (on the latter, see David Tucker's contribution to this volume). This final stage in Beckett's reading and note-taking in philosophy may be said to last from Winter 1936 to Summer 1938. But importantly and also differently than before, Beckett's verbatim transcriptions not only extend to quotations from canonical philosophers - like the above say, or quotations from Spinoza's Ethics and by David Hume and Kant in Ernst Cassirer's biography of the latter, Kant's Life and Thought - they also extend to Beckett's philosophical contemporaries. Although he died slightly earlier, in 1923, this assertion can also embrace Beckett's notes on Fritz Mauthner's "Critique of Knowledge," first encountered around May 1938, as John Pilling has convincingly established. Again the interest in subjectivity and external phenomena is a thread connecting Mauthner to the philosophical readings engaging Beckett over the decade previously. Perhaps because he was, like Geulincx, an abiding philosophical interest of Beckett's, verbatim transcriptions from Mauthner's Contributions to a Critique of Language are actually typed up from a section in volume 2, Concerning Linguistics, itself the most important part of the most thumbed of Mauthner's three, extensive volumes (ten of eleven of Beckett's</page><page sequence="12">174 Matthew Feldman lengthy quotations from Mauthner's work derive from volume 2). This section is especially concerned with Kant's critique of reason, and is tellingly called "History of Philosophy: The Self-Destruction of the Metaphorical": Kant has guided the world up to the present. He knows - admittedly only as far as the critique of language aspects are concerned - that human concepts are always attached to pictorial ideas, that until we get to the recognition of the world of reality, the thing-in-itself, we will never make progress, because our thinking - as we can call it without any constraint - is metaphoric, anthropocentric. Kant does not deserve the smallest credit that through the overwhelming pronouncement of Locke's ideas he showed the way for the new investigation of the human sensory organs. One could on the basis of Kant's works put together an unassailable critical theory of knowledge of 'not knowing,' and even more liberated one as that of the once famous 'docta ignorantia' of Nicolaus Cusanus. In his negative thinking Kant is already the destroyer of everything; we bow before the intellect which in its strongest hours started the gigantic work, which in the form of the de-construction of language or of thought was necessary. But Kant's last worldview is still nevertheless only that of a period of transition; or perhaps it was especially his recognition of his gigantic power which misled him to permit the negative act to be followed by a positive system. He certainly stands in relation to absolute reason as Count Mirabeau does in relation to absolute monarchy.9 Almost certainly overlapping in time - John Pilling has suggested mid 1938 (2004, 42-44) - Mauthner's argument is followed by Beckett's returning to Jules de Gaultier in his "Whoroscope" Notebook. Interes tingly, the translated passage on Kant below is not of the same character as the Dream entry of seven years earlier; this too is a verbatim transcription: Now the great work of Kant, accomplished in the fifty pages of the TRANSCENDENTAL AESTHETIC, consists in his having demonstrated that space and time do not on the one hand, have substantial reality and that, on the other hand, they are not</page><page sequence="13">Beckett and Philosophy, 1928-1938 175 properties of the object either; that, on the contrary, they belong to the knowing subject and that they are the forms of this subject's sensibility. (qtd. in Feldman, 2009a, 29) At the same time, for Beckett's own aesthetic - roughly halfway between the completion of Murphy and the start of Watt - the matter seems to have come to a head. In his only published review from these critical months in 1938, "Intercessions by Denis Devlin," for example, the "severed" relation of subject and object is mooted as "the absolute predicament of particular human identity"; moreover, "the distinction is not idle, for it is from the failure to make it that proceed the common rejection as 'obscure' of most that is significant in modern music, painting, and literature" (Beckett 1984, 91). This is reformulated in the unpublished "Les Deux Besoins," as I suggested earlier, in much the same way: The side and diagonal, two needs, two essences, the being which is the need and the necessity for it being so, the irrational hell from which is raised a cry of blanks, the series of pure questions, the work. If its permitted in a similar way to speak of an effective principle, it's not, thanked be God and Poincare, that which governs the petitions to principle in science and the crossed logos of theology, which feed the storms of affirmative and negative farts whence have come and continue to come those crappy a posteriosis of Spirit and Matter which form despair of savage peoples. These go forward with blasts of 'yes' and 'no' like a detonating shell, until truth blows up. Another. Irreversible. Dead and wounded bear witness to the fact. (Beckett 1984, 56-57; private translation) Apparently concluding Beckett's struggle with philosophy in mid 1938 are two of the shortest entries in the "Whoroscope" Notebook, essentially aide-memoires taken from Jean-Paul Sartre's MA Dissertation, published as L Imagination by Alcon in 1936. These are "noeme" and "noese" (Pilling 2004, 46), deriving from Sartre's rendering: "The concrete psychic reality is to be called noesis, and the indwelling meaning, noema. For example, 'perceived-blossoming tree' is the noema of the perception I now have of it" (138-39).</page><page sequence="14">176 Matthew Feldman Imagination, which Beckett likely read in mid-193 8 - just after finding Nausea "extraordinarily good" in a letter to Thomas MacGreevy of 26 May 1938 (Beckett 2009, 626) - builds up a sus tained critique, over eight chapters, of the perceptual image in Western philosophy as having "harboured implicitly a whole metaphysics." This schism between subjective consciousness and its perceptually-intended object could, however, be countered by a "an entirely new theory of images," one based on Edmund HusserPs 1913 Ideas, for "the observations he makes there are of the highest order" (Sartre, 131). As Beckett then read from Imagination's final chapter, "The Phenomenology of Husserl," from the vantage point offered by Husserlian phenomenology: "An image too, is an image of something": For having put the world 'between parentheses,' the phenomenologist does not lose it. The distinction 'consciousness / world' loses its meaning, and the line is now drawn differently [...]. The problem becomes that of finding motives for forming 'matter' into a mental image rather than into a perception [...]. Husserl blazed the trail, and no study of images can afford to ignore the wealth of insights he provided. We know now that we must start afresh, setting aside all the prephenomenological literature, and attempting above all to attain an intuitive vision of the intentional structure of the image. It also becomes necessary to raise the novel and subtle question of the relations between mental images and 'physical' images (paintings, photographs, etc.) (138, 141, 143) In fact, both Sartre's philosophical Imagination and his literary Nausea may be seen as tentative critiques of Edmund Husserl's theory of phenomenological intentionality (later extended in Sartre's 1940 LTmaginaire, recently translated as The Imaginary). Seemingly as a personal defence for turning to literature as a way of expressing his philosophical revelation, Sartre concludes his first philosophical study by averring: "The way is open for a phenomenological psychology" (143). And this, in effect, represents the final evidence of Beckett's philosophical struggle with the relation between subject and object, and thereby, of 'Beckett and philosophy.' For Beckett by 1938, it may be argued, Western philosophy had fully served its didactic purpose. Henceforth, while clearly drawing upon material already accumulated</page><page sequence="15">Beckett and Philosophy, 1928-1938 177 over the past decade, in future only those thinkers with whom Beckett felt an affinity seem to be revisited. In terms of Beckett's fiction from the interwar years, his three phases of note-taking seem to correspond to changes in his own approach. Thus, Western philosophy is only gaudily marshalled in Dream of Fair to Middling Women and its sequels More Pricks Than Kicks and the unpublished story "Echo's Bones," if for no other reason than that Beckett dipped into eclectic texts - seemingly at times, nearly at random - in order to get what he called his quota of "butin verbal" for his first novel. By the writing of Murphy, synoptic texts on the history of philosophy are clearly in structural evidence, as Chris Ackerley has shown in his excellent companion text, Demented Particulars. But the writing of Murphy had stalled by Christmastime 1935, and it appears that - no longer content with philosophical summarising - Beckett's lengthy transcriptions from Geulincx in early 1936 helped to get his first published novel moving again. By the time Beckett had later encountered Mauthner, Sartre and Husserl in mid-1938, such philosophical buttressing had been turned into, as it were, interior decorating. Transcriptions of decreasing length show Beckett resolving, or refusing, or reforming, the philosophical lacunae between perceiving subject and Thing-In-Itself that had been such a hallmark of Western philosophy prior to Husserl. Here, perhaps, is where the most influential author of the twentieth century met the most influential philosophy of the twentieth century, bringing Beckett's reflections over subject-object relations to an apparent close. For it was at this point Beckett turned to writing in French, composing the "Petit sot" series of poems which, Knowlson reports, show him "consciously reaching towards a greater simplicity and directness, freeing himself from too much complexity of form and expression [... and] show him already evolving in 1938-9 specifically into a French writer" (295). If these poems may indeed be considered early forays into the writing of direct phenomenological experience, the same may be said of the Human Wishes notes and play fragment (reprinted in Disjecta), which can be similarly said to foreshadow Beckett evolving into a specifically dramatic writer. It would seem that these 'failures' between 1938 and 1941, then, were to be the first, tenuous steps in writing 'post-philosophically.' Returning full circle to The Unnamable, only pages after laughing at his earlier "college quips" the narrator notes, "I'm the tympanum, on the one hand the mind, on the other the world, I don't belong to either" (1979, 352). Perhaps this image, then, represents Beckett's response to the subject-object</page><page sequence="16">178 Matthew Feldman dichotomy, and to the philosophy he had earlier studied, if only to later efface, continuing, "perhaps that's what I feel, an outside and an inside and me in the middle, perhaps that's what I am, the thing that divides the world in two, on the one side the outside, on the other the inside, that can be thin as foil, I'm neither one side nor the other, I'm in the middle, I'm the partition, I've two surfaces and no thickness, perhaps that's what I feel." Notes 1. Popper, Objective Knowledge, 197, 20, which further notes: "We can sometimes say of two competing theories, A and B, that in the light of the state of the critical discussion at the time t, and the empirical evidence (test statements) available at the discussion, the theory A is preferable to, or better corroborated than, the theory 2?" (19). 2. For references to Schopenhauer in Beckett's "Sottisier" Notebook, see UoR MS 2901, 25-26 (University of Reading, Beckett International Foundation). In respect of Ludwig Wittgenstein, the jury is still out in terms of whether the former had any textual influence on the latter's postwar works. Beckett is known to have had several of Wittgenstein's texts in his library at his death, and he noted in a letter to Barbara Bray of 18 Jan. 1979 that he was reading Wittgenstein "with interest." 3.

Beckett's reading of, and about, Spinoza between 1933 and 1938 has yet to receive sustained comment by Beckett scholars. However, Beckett appears to have read selections of, at the very least, "Treatise on the Correction of the Understanding," noting Spinoza's first rule of life in his "Whoroscope" Notebook: "To speak in a manner comprehensible to the vulgar," 60v., corresponding, in Spinoza's Ethics and "De Intellectus Emendatione," ed. Ernest Rhys (J.M. Dent &amp; Sons: London, n.d. [1910]), to p. 231. Beckett also consulted, at the minimum, parts of the Ethica and Charles Appuhn's edited French-Latin edition of Spinoza's Ethics (Paris: Gamier 1934); as well as Leon Brunschvicg's Spinoza etses contemporains (Paris: Alcan, 1923).</page><page sequence="17">Beckett and Philosophy, 1928-193 8 179 7.
