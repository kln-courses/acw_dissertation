Copyright ? 1996 Cambridge University Press DOUGLAS HEDLEY PANTHEISM, TRINITARIAN THEISM AND THE IDEA OF UNITY: REFLECTIONS ON THE CHRISTIAN CONCEPT OF GOD The whole of philosophy is the systematic specification of unity (Hegel). There has been a striking revival of ' classical ' metaphysics in recent years. The ancient Greek interest in the arch? has been pursued in novel ways in recent Anglo-American philosophy of religion. The arch? does not denote a temporal beginning but rather the source of being and the relationship of this to lower orders of being.1 Instances of this are the modal versions of the ontological argument, ' perfect God ' theology, and inductive versions of the proofs of God's existence. Recently a philosopher has produced a sophis? ticated defence of pantheism. In his stimulating and important book Pan? theism: A Non-theistic Concept of Deity (London: Routledge, 1994) Michael Levine writes in conscious opposition to the overtly theistic and Christian contemporary philosophy of religion of Notre Dame or Oxford. Levine wishes to produce a philosophically sophisticated and religiously satisfying alternative to theism ; he seeks to give a philosophical defence of pantheism, and indicates some of the confusion pertaining to the traditional theistic views of pantheism. My reflections in this essay are largely historical, but the salient point is philosophical. Philosophers often invoke historical positions as part of a contemporary proposal ; very often muddled perceptions of the past distort the argument. I wish to offer reflections upon the concepts of unity and pantheism and the Christian doctrine of the Trinity in the belief that thinking rigorously about positions in the philosophy of religion demands some degree of accuracy concerning the genesis artfl structure of these ideas. I do not wish to consider Levine's book in any detail, but I do wish to consider his assumption that the historical background of 'pan? theism' includes philosophers like Plotinus and Hegel as well as the Stoics and Spinoza. This, I believe, is a sleight of hand. Coleridge once remarked ' I am sure that two very different meanings if not more lurk in the word, One'.2 The historical designation of Plotinus or Hegel as ' pantheists ' rests often on little more than overlooking the very different meanings in the word 'one'. Coleridge is implicitly thinking in the passage quoted of the doctrine 1 Lloyd Gerson, God and Greek Philosophy : Studies in the Early History of Natural Theology (London : Routledge, 1994). 2 S. T. Coleridge Collected Motes (London: Routledge, 1961), 11, 2332.</page><page sequence="2">62 DOUGLAS HEDLEY of the Trinity where ' multitude &amp; division are not (o mystery) necessarily subversive of unity'. The very definition of the Godhead by the Christian councils as one substance and three persons has evidently determined the specifically Christian view of the Divine unity. This interest leads to more sophisticated concept of God than some advocates or critics of the Christian religion admit. I agree with Michael Levine's concern to present pantheism as a genuine metaphysical and spiritual option. I further agree that pantheism cannot be merely the identification of God with the world, but we should distinguish between the crude identification of God and the world and a subtle pantheistic view of some higher though immanent unifying force. We shall call these: CP the belief that the entire cosmos just is, i.e. is strictly identical with, the divine: 'pan' is 'theos'. and SP the belief in a higher unifying force which is both impersonal and immanent within the cosmos. What Levine fails to state is the corresponding difference between a crude theism and a more subtle account. Let us call these: CT a wholly good and omnipotent personal transcendent agent. as opposed to a belief in ST a transcendent creative unity who may or may not be deemed personal. The sharp difference is between crude pantheism (CP) and crude theism (CT). Yet very few philosophers have been interested in either CP or CT. CP is virtual atheism and CT is too anthropomorphic. The real debate is between a subtle pantheism (SP) which proposes a unifying but immanent force worthy of worship and a subtle theism (ST) which proposes a casual relationship between a transcendent unity and the cosmos. Now that we have perhaps reshaped the issue as between SP and ST, we can return to our reflections upon Michael Levine's defence of pantheism. Michael Levine is evidently correct to insist that the higher unity of SP can be the object of genuine worship and the source of a genuinely religious ethics, and to distinguish SP from CP. Yet much of the force of his book is derived from confusing CT with ST. That is to say, I disagree radically with Levine's insistence upon including metaphysically subtle theists amongst the pantheists. There is an irony in the fact that a genuine pantheist like Levine should invoke the names of Plotinus and Hegel. That these two thinkers should be regarded as 'pantheists' is due more to the stigma of the term than real philosophical tenets. This is quickly obvious when one considers that</page><page sequence="3">CHRISTIAN CONCEPT OF GOD 63 Plotinus was severely critical of Stoic pantheism as the position of an opposing school. Further Hegel - for all his Spinozism - was a radical critic of Spinoza's substance-monism and the vitalistic monism of older German Spinozistic contemporaries like Herder and Goethe, and wished to rehabili? tate the idea of God as absolute subject: as the great I AM of Exodus 3.14.3 I say this because Levine, like Thomas McFarland in his book Coleridge and the Pantheist Tradition, pursues a view of Neoplatonism as 'pantheistic' which has been current since the early Enlightenment. This is a widespread and misleading mistake. It does not aid our understanding of the past, and I do not think it helps us in the effort to produce a just case for theism. Anselm or Descartes were working with a largely Neoplatonist metaphysics ; and not because they failed to see the inherent 'pantheism' involved. The impression of pantheism is produced by the attempt of metaphysicians to try to provide a rational (non-mythical) cosmogony. Yet this is a problem faced by Chris? tian as well as by pagan Platonists. Indeed, through the transmission of Proclus' theory of causality in the Liber de Causis, Albertus Magnus, Thomas Aquinas, Meister Eckhart, and Nicholas of Cusa all use the concept of emanation in order to explain creation in terms which are not hopelessly anthropomorphic. St Thomas is nonetheless a most unlikely pantheist!4 One may, of course, wish to claim that the positions of say Plotinus or Hegel do not stand up to scrutiny, and that the transcendence or the personality of the One or Absolute collapses into something akin to pantheism. Such a criticism is at a different level, and can barely be con? sidered here. We simply wish to observe that the designation 'pantheist' should be based upon genuinely philosophical intelligible grounds. If we have reason for thinking that Plotinus or Hegel are not pantheists in the sense of the belief SP, but perhaps not theists in the sense of ST we should nevertheless avoid the designation 'pantheism' and speak of monism instead. Here the problem is not merely conceptual wooliness. It is not nominally true to speak of the 'pantheist tradition', i.e. in the sense that F. D. Maurice, Stalin, Hitler and Harold Wilson were, and called themselves, 'socialists' and are thus in some very vague sense part of a 'Socialist Tradition'. The problem is rather that the accusation rests upon a philosophical mistake. Though Plotinus and Hegel were concerned with the idea of unity as the central concept of philosophy, they were not concerned to present a meta? physics of a pantheistic unity. 3 See my article 'Coleridge's Speculative Mysticism', Heythrop Journal, October 1994, vol. 35, no. 4, pp. 421-439 4 W.

Thomas McFarland's book is the only large scale discussion of pantheism from a historical perspective and Michael Levine readily admits his dependence upon McFarland's work. McFarland's book suits Levine's purposes because McFarland has a very broad conception of who were pantheists, based largely on German 18th and 19th century scholarship. This very broad view of the ' Pantheist Tradition ' enables Levine to invoke a large number of famous philosophers from Plotinus to Hegel as members of his philosophical camp. The problem is that there simply is no 'Pantheist Tradition' of the sort described by McFarland. Because 'Pantheism' has largely been a term of condemnation in the past, a term with which a historian or Churchman might wield some real influence, there is no doubt that nearly all those thinkers described by McFarland were in fact accused of pantheism. Let us consider the instance of the alleged Neoplatonic 'pantheism'. This fairly common assertion that Neoplatonism is a pantheist metaphysics is largely rooted in the hostility towards the philosophy of late Antiquity engendered by Enlightenment histories of philosophy. The word 'pantheism' was coined by the notorious John Toland in 1705, and5 Johann Jacob Brucker's Historia critica philosophiae (1742) presents the Platonici as superstitious and irrational pantheists. Brucker laid the foundation of the still common assumption that the Neoplatonists were esoterics and not philosophers, and were part of an undercurrent of barely rational 'wisdom' which inspired secret societies and poets rather than mainstream philosophical metaphysicians. In opposition to this Enlightened rejection of late Platonic Schw?rmerei, Hegel saw Neoplatonism, especially Proclus, as the culmination of the specu? lative tendency in Greek philosophy. There is a strong sense in which the creative philosophical element in Neoplatonic metaphysics was manifested by the revival of Neoplatonic themes in German Idealism ; particularly in Hegel and Schelling.6 Hegel's pupil, the T?binger Hegelian, Eduard Zeller followed his master to the extent that he saw the history of philosophy as a history of systems. He nevertheless replaced the dialectical view of Neoplato? nism with a ' Romantic ' organic model of the history of philosophy as a series of periods of immaturity, fruition and decline.7 Neoplatonism was for 5 McFarland, Coleridge and the Pantheist Tradition (Oxford: OUP, 1969), pp. 266 if. 6 Beierwaltes, Piatonismus und Idealismus (Frankfurt: Klostermann), pp. 67-82; 154-187. 7 Zeller was a pupil of the T?bingen Hegelian F. C Baur.</page><page sequence="5">CHRISTIAN CONCEPT OF GOD 65 Zeller a period of sterile decline. The centre of this system is the concept of Emanation. Zeller stamps Plotinus' philosophy as an 'emanation system.' McFarland takes up - somewhat uncritically - the Zeller view of Neo? platonism and confuses Spinozistic monism with Neoplatonist metaphysics.8 The manifold oddities of McFarland's Coleridge interpretation are irre? levant here,9 but one central aspect of his book is the idea of a ' Pantheist Tradition' in which the Platonists play a central role. The soi disant 'Pan? theist Tradition' consists of Neoplatonists, the medieval mystics, Bruno, Spinoza and the German Idealists. For all of these the concept of the unity is central, but that does not entail that they are all pantheists. I shall take Spinoza to be a pantheist in precisely the sense in which Michael Levine wishes to present pantheism: as both a philosophically rigorous and spiri? tually satisfying doctrine. Spinoza's strong Stoic roots make such a desig? nation meaningful. The view that the Neoplatonists, Christian mystics or the German Idealists were all part of an essentially pantheist tradition is, how? ever, either untenable or highly debatable. Even Eduard Zeller was careful to avoid the suggestion that Plotinus's thought constitutes simple pantheism. He describes Plotinus's philosophy as ' dynamic ' pantheism because it is based upon the communication of the power of the One. This is the causal principle of Neoplatonism which assumes that the cause is superior to the effect. Nonetheless, the designations ' emana? tion' or 'pantheism' are misleading expressions.10 Spinoza regards God as one substance which manifests itself in modes and attributes. All extension and thought is God in the sense that the ' all ' consists of the attributes of God. This Stoic view is quite different from Plotinus' view of the One as entirely ITSELF. Hence Boethius' Neoplatonic definition of God as ipsum esse.11 The ' all ' for Plotinus is not the ' One ' even though the ' all ' presupposes an underlying unity. The radical transcendence of the Principle is incom? patible with pantheism. If we press the issue of the 'personality' of God, it is clear that traditional theism's use of the concept 'Being' to designate God is far removed from the anthropomorphism of thinking of the arche as straightforwardly a transcendent perfect agent. The philosophical radicality and power of Spinoza's position is entirely obscured when one assumes that the Neoplatonist position is pantheist. The genius of Spinoza lies in his transformation of much Neoplatonic thinking into a naturalistic, deterministic and pantheistic philosophy.12 The creation and preservation of the universe by a transcendent arche is abolished ; the Christian (Neo) Platonic distinction between God's ideas, finite thoughts and 8 In support of his view of the 'pantheist tradition', McFarland writes: 'we may invoke the authority of Eduard Zeller's great scholarship...'

A pantheist and the theist will part ways in their views of the nature of'mind.' The Stoics were materialists, and for all his rationalism, Spinoza taught that modes of thought and physical reality are essentially one. Like the Stoics, Spinoza accords sense and imagination a much higher role than Descartes or the Platonists. Spinoza's view of a priori knowledge is natura? listic. Whereas geometry is associated with innateness by the Platonists like Proclus or Descartes, Spinoza is much closer to Hobbes on this point. Spinoza held that a priori knowledge can be explained without reference to innate notions but by reference to sense, memory and imagination. Descartes' view of the real distinction between mind and body and his emphasis upon pure intellect, and his appeal to the Divine will is precisely in accord with his theistic-Neoplatonic view of a unitary spiritual cause of the universe. Spinoza's appeal to the senses, rejection of a real distinction between body and mind, rejection of Divine purpose and personality, attribution of ex? tension to God, and his determinism are in accord with a pantheistic (and broadly Stoic) metaphysics.13 The link between metaphysics and ethics is a further reason why the concept of ' emanation ' is misleading. In late Antiquity philosophy had a much stronger ethical or even spiritual component than it does in the modern academic environment. The Stoic looks at the world and tries to see the Divine will and providence in the chain of cause and effect and tries to attain a nobler bearing through the perception of the unifying but immanent world force. The Platonist looks beyond the physical world into the intelligible realm and tries to explain the inadequacies of the cosmos through various models of privation of the good, free will, or the nature of matter. The Stoic ethic of bearing fate with gratitude and fortitude, and the Platonist ethics of attaining God-likeness by 'fleeing to another place' reflects the respective emphasis upon Divine immanence and Divine transcendence.14 The Plato? nist and the Christian share the common conviction that God is in a strong sense separate from the world and that the good life entails establishing the right relationship to the transcendent source. Philosophy, for both Platonist and Christian, is linked to soteriology.15 The German Idealists are much closer to pantheism than the Neopla? tonists because of the influence of Spinoza. There are various other factors which lead to pantheistic tendencies. The strong biological emphasis in their thinking encourages Schelling to position quasi organic polarities in the 13 P. O.

Hence he should exclude the Platonists from the pantheist camp.</page><page sequence="7">CHRISTIAN CONCEPT OF GOD 67 Godhead.16 Furthermore, history plays a much stronger role than is possible for the Neoplatonists : Hegel's God, or the God of the later Schelling, requires the historical development in order to realize himself- an absurdity for Plotinus. Nonetheless, it is far from clear that the German Idealists are pantheists in any meaningful sense of the word. In contrast to the Neopla? tonists, Hegel and Schelling insist upon the personality of the Principle.17 Schelling has affinities to pantheism in his positing of' natural ' polarities in the Divine and Hegel in his link between the Absolute and the historical process; both thinkers tend towards an emphasis upon Divine immanence which is quite un-Platonic; yet in both cases the emphasis upon the per? sonality of the principle does not cohere with the impersonal principle of pantheism. The Stoic Cleanthes uses the image of the Governor of the cosmos but this should not be taken literally; it is a personification. The German idealists, on the contrary, were deeply concerned with the resolution of personality and infinity of the Absolute. Whereas the neo-Spinozists, such as Herder, Goethe and the early Fichte, rejected the idea of the personality of the Absolute on the grounds that personality implies finitude, and is hence inappropriate for the Absolute, both Schelling and Hegel were concerned to develop a concept of unlimited or infinite personality through a revival of the dogma of Trinity. The 'otherness' required for the personal being of God is placed within the Godhead. For Hegel and Schelling the idea that the arche is reflexive is the great central idea of metaphysics, and they stand in the tradition of reflection upon Exodus 3.14 'i am who i am' which interprets the biblical sentence in the light of Platonic-Aristotelian idea of the Divine mind in connection with the biblical conviction of the personality of God.18 This emphasis upon the self-consciousness of the arch? or Absolute is barely compatible with a meaningful concept of pantheism. Hegel was fascinated by the dogma of the Trinity in connection with Plato's Parmenides, Sophist and Timaeus. The fascination did not rest upon an obscure and esoteric preoccupation with triads but upon the idea of the arch? as reflexive unity: in the fulfilment of St John's insistence that God is Spirit or that thought is not alien to the arch? but constitutive for the nature of the arch?. It is Hegel's conviction that Christian Trinitarian theology produced the decisive development in Western metaphysics by combining the Platonic idea of the Good as the causal Principle of the cosmos and the Aristotelian idea of the Principle or arch? as reflexivity.19 16 I am thinking in particular of Schelling's Freiheitschrift of 1809. 17 Freiheitschrift 379/380 'Denn nur Pers?nliches kann Pers?nliches heilen, und Gott mu? Mensch werden, damit der Mensch wieder zu Gott komme.' For Hegel see Vorlesung ?ber die Philosophie der Religion, m (Hamburg: Meiner, 1966) p. 57, 'Gott ist Geist...d.i. Subjektivit?t, unendliche Pers?nlichkeit.' See F.

(Decline and Fall, II; p. 301) We can observe both the deep affinity and yet essential difference between Platonist philosophers and Christian theology by considering the link be? tween the idea of Divine simplicity or reflexivity and creation in Augustine's thoughts on creation. Gibbon is quite correct to see the underlying issue in Trinitarian metaphysics as the relation of the arch? to creation, and to see that for the Christian theologians the Logos was 'particularly considered under the more accessible character of the Son of an Eternal Father, and the Creator and Governor of the world.' (Decline and Fall, II; p. 301) This link between the Platonic Logos and the idea of creation may seem prima facie philologically illicit or theologically perilous ; the gulf between 'creation' and 'emanation' is, after all, the standard (theological) textbook difference between the Christian and the pagan Platonist cosmogony. Yet this is a difference which Augustine was not particularly sensitive to. If we look at the Confessions we find that Augustine is quite averse to an anthro? pomorphic view of creation. How did you make heaven and earth? Clearly it was not in heaven or on earth that you made them. Nor was it in the air or beneath the sea, because these are part of the domain of heaven and earth. Nor was it in the universe that you made the universe, because until the universe was made there was no place where it could be made. Nor did you have in your hand any matter from which you could make heaven and earth, for where could you have obtained matter which you had not created, in order to use it as a material for making something else.... It must therefore be that you spoke and they were made. In your Word alone you created them. (Conf XI, ?5) In the beginning was the Word : In principio erat Verbum. The latin word 'principium' is the translation of the Greek metaphysical term arch?. In your Word means 'in your principle'. The Christian conviction that the world is the creation of God is linked to the Greek idea of the arch? which is Spiritual i.e. immaterial and which is the causal ground of material being. Certainly, Augustine wishes to avoid the impression that creation can be understood as 20 Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (London: Everyman, 1993), 11, p. 300-301.</page><page sequence="9">CHRISTIAN CONCEPT OF GOD 69 a divine 'making' rather on the model of human manufacture; the creation in principio, in the ' Word ', is not in space or time. The model which Augustine uses is that of a (timeless) speaking or seeing: the supposed etymological root of theos in theorein made the sight imagery very attractive.21 In accordance with Platonic cosmogony, we find in Augustine reflections on creation the idea of a noetic production which bears a very remote resemblance to human making.22 It is certainly hard to say that we have a flat rejection of the Greek model of ' emanation ' in Augustine's thoughts on creation in the Confessions. The soi distant theory of emanation (some scholars suggest that it is an ' unphilo sophical' concept23) can mean that the arch? flows out of itself and, by emptying itself, produces reality. On this view all reality is really identical with its source. This pantheistic model is utterly opposed to the Platonist cosmogony. All the great Platonists from Plotinus to Proclus insist that the arch? is not reduced in any respect by its production of inferior realms but remains entire. Plotinus expresses the transcendence of the Principle so radically that he says that the One gives what it does not 'have'. The One produces plurality and thereby gives or produces something which it does not 'have', i.e. plurality.24 The term 'emanation' suggests that the One becomes the world through a self emptying, and this is an idea which the Platonists expressly reject. Emanation is sometimes taken to mean a necessary as opposed to a free creation. Yet it would actually be quite false to contrast the mechanical overflow of the Principle or arch? into the cosmos in Platonism with the Christian view of the freely willed creation. On the contrary, for the Neopla? tonist the cosmos is totally dependent upon its producing source like a mirror image upon the existence of the mirror. The dependence is monocausal : Proclus uses the language of'giving'.25 The images of the fountain, light or seed, and the metaphors of unfolding or outflowing are meant to express the production of the cosmos from creative plenitude of the transcendent arch? rather than the inexorable and mechanistic production. It has been argued 21 Cf. Ilona Opelt, 'Christianisierung Heidnischer Etymologien', Jahrbuch, f. Antike und Christentum 2, 1959- 70-79 22 The locus classicus of contemplative creation is Plotinus, in, 8 (30). See J. N.

A profound common basis between Christian and Platonist cosmogony was the Timaeus, which contains a view of the creation of the cosmos - unlike Aristotle's cosmology.27 Por? phyry interpreted the Timaeus in such a way that the Demiurge creates matter, and he was followed by Proclus.28 The idea that everything comes from God is not an exclusively Christian or Jewish conviction but has a perfectly good Greek pedegree. Augustine meditates upon the meaning of creatio in principio as creatio ex nihilo: 'You were, and besides you nothing was. From nothing, then, you created heaven and earth.' (Conf. XII, 7) Creatio ex nihilo is a denial of pre-existent materials but also a reinforcing of the equally (from Plotinus and Porphyry onwards) Platonic idea that ' everything comes from God'. If there was to be a first, in order to be the vehicle for all these composite forms, what can have been its origin? It can only have derived from you, for all things have their origin in you. (Conf. ?XII, 7) Let us compare this with the Neoplatonic cosmogony. This is based upon the idea of the principle or arch? as the prius of all being and, nonetheless, remaining in itself. This is the idea which the images of emanation should convey: the production of the lower from the higher.29 TWO CONCEPTS OF UNITY The Stoic idea of a unifying principle is that of an immanent force. The famous hymn to Zeus by Cleanthes is a typical instance of a thoughtful and genuinely religious pantheism. The Platonist has two models of unity, and neither of these are pantheistic. The first model is that of the One. The One is 'all' in the sense that 'all' is a product of it's causal power. One cannot maintain that 'all' is the One because the One-as pure Unity is beyond being. The universe is a hierarchy of degrees of reality pointing to an Absolute which transcends all being and is absolutely autonomous. The One 26 E.

Yet the issue of the eternity of the world and the issue of the emanation of the lower from the higher can be quite intelligibly divided as logically separate ideas. To posit an affinity between Christian and pagan on the issue of emanation does not mean that Christian Platonists affirmed the eternity of the world.</page><page sequence="11">CHRISTIAN CONCEPT OF GOD 71 is complete in itself; independent not just with respect to the natural but also to the intelligible world. The negative theology of Plotinus serves to empha? size the exalted autonomy of the One which is directly related to its causal power. As the principle and source of all, and as the ground and principle of all categorical determination, the One is without form and determination : the One is infinite power and goodness. There are differences between the Neoplatonist philosophers as to how this pure unity should be interpreted. In his earlier writings Plotinus seems to suggest that some sort of super consciousness is compatible with this Unity, and in the great treatise on Free Will and the Will of the One VI 8 (39) he speaks of the will 'as it were' of the One. This suggestion is radically rejected by Proclus who is adamant that the One is ' beyond ' thought, will or awareness. The second model of unity in Neoplatonism is that of the Divine Intellect. This is the highest form of relational or reflexive unity. The paradigm is the second principle of Parmenides and Aristotle's God as ' thought thinking itself. Plotinus uses the symbol of light to explain this second form of unity: the ideas in the Intellect are thoroughly transparent. The ideas are many and yet unitary in that they constitute translucent unity. Here being and thought are one. Although manifold the ideas are in no sense dispersed. The unity of the ideas is a unity in diversity. We have two Neoplatonic models of Divine unity.30 First, the causal source of all being which remains above all itself. As such it is pure unity. Secondly, we have the inferior level of Divine unity in the reflexive thought of the Intellect. Christian Trinitarian theology telescoped these two models of unity into one and thereby made the principle of the arch? into a reflexive principle.31 The Trinitarian God is the causal ground of all being who remains, nonetheless, transcendent. (Hence the problems of the Church Fathers with the notion of the suffering of the Godhead.) Simultaneously, as it were, the Father begets eternally the Son and thinks himself in the Son or Logos and through the Spirit. The Word cannot be divided from the Father : He is God himself as Berkeley and Coleridge put it : the Son is the 'alterity' of the Father. The concept of 'alterity' is meant to avoid the strong sense of difference implied by the word 'other'. The Son, the Word, is not other than the Father but, as the councils said, consubstantial. It must therefore be that you spoke and they were made. In your Word alone you created them. (Conf. XI, ?5). The Word cannot be divided from the Father : the world was created in the Word means that it was created from the plenitude of the ideas, from the Divine self-consciousness. The generation of the Son is the inner eternal self explication of the arch? which must precede the creation of the cosmos. The 30 I am being slightly loose in my terminology.

The pagan Platonists insisted upon the utter simplicity of the arch? or principle ; Plotinus slightly ambiguously and Proclus drastically. The Christian Plato? nists like Augustine insist that the arch? is in some sense relational, and that the plurality of the cosmos has its roots in relational unity of the arch?. The world was created in principio means that the procession of the Godhead precedes logically the production of the world. Hence the idea of the radical simplicity of the arch? h rejected and the two models of unity sketched above are united into a single vision of the Tri-une Godhead. God is spirit (John. 4.24) as such is autos and heteros. With this model the Christian Platonist can maintain two central aspects of Christian belief against the pagan Platonists within the framework of Greek metaphysics. Firstly, the creation of the world is not necessary: the generation of the Son and the return of the Spirit is necessary but the cosmos is the secondary product of the abundant goodness of the Godhead, and not, certainly not, a necessary process. On the other hand, the world is certainly not difactum brutum, an error or a fall, but is implicit in the self-consciousness of the arch?. The questio vexata of the pagan Platonists is why, given the transcendent and absolute simplicity and autonomy of the One, the inferior realm of the manifold should come into and remain in existence. The Christian view of a consubstantial procession within the Godhead provides a link between the eternal life of the Godhead and the realm of finite being, a link which is massively reinforced by the conviction of the historical incarnation of the Word.33 PANTHEISM AND TRINITY If we consider the debates between Christian and pagan Platonism the controversy seems to be less about an Emanations system, or a Personal Creator God, as a difference in the idea of the simplicity of the arch?. The models of unity which the Church Fathers employed were largely those of Neopla? tonism even if the Neoplatonist scheme was the object of attack. Hence, it is a rather academic debate whether homoousios was a rejection of the threefold Platonic subordinationism : Hen, Nus, Psych? and hence a rejection of the pre Nicean harmony of Platonic and Christian thinking. 34 It certainly does not 32 Colin Gunton's insistence that Augustine's view of creation is barely informed by Trinitarian categories seems to me very puzzling. See The Promise of Trinitarian Theology (Edinburgh: T. T. Clark, 1991), pp. 31-57. Interestingly, Gunton also refers approvingly to McFarland's highly eccentric opus magnum : Coleridge and the Pantheist Tradition. 33 J.

This is the reason why such an adamant Platonist as Marius Victorinus attacked Arianism with Platonist tools; although the subordi nationism of Arianism seemed prima facie closer to the hypostasis doctrine of Neoplatonic Divinity. A clandesdine adherence to Platonic triads was just not necessary for Christian Platonism. A superstitious and unthinking rev? erence of triads or to an identification of the Neoplatonic hypostases with the Divine Trinity of Christian theology has often been thought to be the motivation for much Platonic Trinitarianism. Yet not even Ficino believed that the triads of the pagan Platonists could be simply identified with the Christian trinity.35 The relevant triads are the noetic triads: triads within the Divine Intellect.36 One of the problems at this point rests in the Neoplatonic view of divinity. Apart from the general Greek tendency to regard divinity as a predicate, it is an issue as to what one might regard as the Neoplatonic God. Rist has pointed out that Plotinus tends to consider the Nus as God, although the One seems closer to the Christian idea of the Divine as simultaneously absolutely transcendent and yet penetrating or suffusing the entire cosmos. Platonism endowed Christian thinkers with a theistic instrumentarium and the resources for its own view of God as a spiritual co-inherence; Christian theology combined the idea of the transcendent causal principle with the model of the reflexive arch? born of the telescoping of the One and the Nus. This is why the Trinity is not a additional dogma but an essential component of the genuinely Christian concept of God. It is certainly no accident that the doctrine of the Trinity has tended to be a topic of interest to philosophers and theologians of a Platonist hue (Eriugena, Meister Eckhart, Nicholas of Cusa, Ficino, Cudworth, Coleridge etc.). The distinction between the theism of the Christians and the Platonici lies not in the distinction between a pantheistic emanation and a personal creation but between the absolute simplicity of the arch? and the reflexive nature of the arch? in the doctrine of the Trinity. Thus the Trinity should not be seen as a doctrinal oddity but as the centre of the Christian metaphysical vision. Joseph Priestley, the great 18th century scientist and necessitarian phil? osopher, was convinced that the doctrine of the Trinity was a corruption of the original Christian faith introduced by those Church Fathers who favoured a second God or Nus. Priestley ridiculed 'Austin's' insistence that if the Platonists had changed a few words they would have become Christians. 35 Michael J. B. Allen, 'Marsilio Ficino on Plato, the Neoplatonists and the Christian Doctrine of the Trinity' Renaissance Quarterly 37 (1984), 555-84. 36 On the noetic triad see M. J. Edwards, 'Porphyry and the Intelligible Triad', in Journal of Hellenic Studies, ex (1990, 14-25.</page><page sequence="14">74 DOUGLAS HEDLEY He says, that 'he learned in some books of the Platonists, translated into Latin, though not in so many words, the doctrine of the Logos, as contained in the introduction to the Gospel of John; that it was with God, and was God, and the world was made by it, etc. but not the doctrine of the incarnation'. Priestley notes that these Church Fathers took their admiration too far especially as ' regards the doctrine of ideas and the Divine intellect, nous or logos', in which the greatest absurdity is to be found.37 The Socinian or Unitarian attack is clearly motivated by the conviction that Greek philosophy was an unnecessary addition to an already complete Gospel, an addition motivated by the desire to conform to the intellectual tendencies of the age and which resulted in a corruption of the pristine Gospel. The Socinianism of writers like Priestley inherited the medieval distinction between philosophy and theology and the Nominalistic-Reformation hos? tility to speculative philosophy. Not surprisingly, Unitarianism could neither understand nor appreciate the vision of philosophy in Augustine or in the Greek Fathers. This anti-Hellenism was combined with a sincere and (I believe) often justified suspicion of the legal metaphors of redemption em? ployed by the Western Church, Catholic or Reformed, whereby redemption is seen in terms of legal transactions between persons of the Trinity. Har nack's hellenization thesis in his Dogmengeschichte is essentially a late product of the Socinian wing of the Reformation. And perhaps Hegel's revival of the doctrine of the Trinity was a genuine exploration of Augustinian ideas : particularly the conviction that God is essentially reflexive Spirit. There is an irony in the fact that the great critic of Neoplatonism as an Emanationssystem, Zeller, was a pupil of the German Proclus : Hegel. Enlightenment scholarship was deeply rooted in the criticism of traditional Christian dogmas, and classical scholarship was largely the preserve of clergymen. When one considers criticism of Neoplatonism as a decadent form of Greek philosophy, as an Emanationssystem and as a form of pantheism, it is difficult not to suspect that the feelings of the Enlightened distaste for dogmatic speculation and the strong sentiments of the Unitarian pastor play a very strong role. The criticism of the baneful influence of Greek meta? physical speculation has its roots in the Enlightened criticism of the dogma of the Trinity and hence the Dehellenizing programme of writers such as Priestley or Harnack is really rooted in the rejection of the dogma of the Trinity. Socinians wished to show that certain dogmas were an accretion derived from Greek metaphysics. As a result it was thought necessary to demonstrate the essential incompatibility of Greek and Hebrew thought.38 If this is correct, much of the hostility toward Neoplatonism including the verdict o? pantheism is rooted in the critique of the Christian dogmas in the 37 J.

Mohr, 1990), ni, p. 779 ff.</page><page sequence="15">CHRISTIAN CONCEPT OF GOD 75 Enlightenment, particularly the dogma of the Trinity rather than a philo? sophical judgement. The revival of Trinitarian thought in the nineteenth cen? tury was after all, a product of a semi Spinozist who was a great admirer of Platonic theology: Hegel. This perhaps suggests that the term 'pantheism' is much more a product of theological invective than philosophical and philological analysis. It is often not very surprising that theologians in? fluenced by the theological positivism of Dialectical theology are quick to condemn pagan notions of emanation. This is more an outright rejection of the claims of Athens than theological reflection. If our suspicion that much of the attack on Alexandrine metaphysics, pantheism, emanation etc. was largely motivated by an attack upon the Christian concept of God as the reflexive arch?, is correct, we should be careful to distinguish between pan? theism as a specific metaphysical position and pantheism as a mere term of abuse. CONCLUSION Let us return to our starting point. Given his desire to refute Schopenhauer's thought that pantheism is polite atheism, Michael Levine invokes a number of philosophers as pantheists who either are not pantheists or who at the very least cannot be described as such in any unqualified sense. Since analytic philosophers of religion have started to consider the wealth of philosophical thought within Christian theology it is well worth reflecting upon our preconceptions. We started this essay by making a preliminary distinction between CT 'crude theism' and ST 'subtle theism'. We are now in a position to develop this intuition into a reflection upon the meaningful (rather than purely polemic) historical divisions between philosophical theologians. There are, I suggest, four major models of thought about the Principle or arche'in Western metaphysics : (A) The Neoplatonic-theistic view of a hierarchy of being points to a transcendent unity as perfect being and perhaps personal insofar as this is compatible with the absolute autonomy and self sufficiency of the Principle. This is the view of Plotinus, Anselm and Descartes. God is esse ipsum. God may or may not be thought of as 'personal'. Anselm evidently thinks of God as personal; Plotinus concedes the possibility; and Proclus rules the possibility out of court. (B) The Stoic or Spinozistic view of an immanent cosmic unifying force which is properly the object of worship without being regarded as transcen? dent or as in any sense personal. Both the Stoics and Spinoza felt that the personal language of hymns or Scripture was strictly false but a useful concession to the needs of the imagination or the unlearned. (C) The Deistic view of God: not as esse ipsum but as ens (albeit the most perfect) ; i.e. an entity without the world, a clockmaker. Paley is the most</page><page sequence="16">76 DOUGLAS HEDLEY famous instance of this view of God. This is the opposite of pantheism, but it is not a very attractive option. It is spiritually a rather barren option because it divorces God from his creation, and by divorcing the Divine from the terrestial realm, it robs God of his infinity. (D) The German Idealist mixture of'A' and 'B'. The world is necessary for the realization of the personal Principle. Process theology belongs to this group. This is more clearly pantheistic than ' A ' or ' C ' ; although not because the Idealist or Process theologian rejects the idea of the personality of God. In some senses, both find the concept of Divine Personality easier to accom? modate than the Christian Platonist; the Platonist's resolve to uphold the Divine transcendence militate against any straightforward use of the concept of Person with all its associations of mutability, finitude etc. Theists, i.e. adherents of A, may or may not hold to the simplicity or the reflexivity of the Principle. This has wide ranging implications for the relation of God to world but these implications are not such that we should overlook the central difference between the pagan platonic theist and the pantheist. Pantheism is incompatible with the Christian religion but theism is not the prerogative of the Christian philosopher. On the contrary, the concepts of unity employed by Christian theologians reveal the extent of the debt to, and the difference from, Neoplatonic philosophy through the fusion of the two main concepts of unity into the model of the Tri-une Godhead. We have seen that for Augustine creation is rooted in the eternal procession of the Son from the Father as the mundus intelligibilis. The eternal begetting of the Word - an idea which is unintelligible without Greek metaphysics and the consideration of'identity' and 'difference' ? was the issue which Gibbon regarded as the darkest corner of Patristic thought ; if this begetting is the presupposition of the creation of the world on a Christian account, we cannot be satisfied by any facile opposition between the Hellenistic idea of ema? nation and the Christian concept of creation. Yet if that is true, we must reconsider which philosophers we are prepared to designate 'theists'. I do not believe that C, i.e. God as a finite entity without the world, and B, i.e. the pantheistic position of God as all inclusive impersonal unity, are strictly 'Christian' options at all. I think the real choice for the Christian theologian or philosopher is between A and D, i.e. the broadly (neo) Platonist concept and the Idealist-cum-Process theology idea of God. As we have noted, Christian theology developed through its dogmatic speculations a rich vision of the Principle as essentially reflexive ; in oppo? sition to the strict simplicity of the Neoplatonic One. This was the great opposition between Christian and pagan Platonist. As soon as we start to consider the issue of theism or pantheism within a Christian theological context, we are led inexorably to the strictly dogmatic issue of the Trin? itarian Godhead. The concept of inner Trinitarian generation tended to reinforce the anti-pantheism of the Platonists rather than oppose it. The</page><page sequence="17">CHRISTIAN CONCEPT OF GOD 77 dogma of the Trinity, for example, depends for much of its content upon pagan philosophical ideas. We can see this clearly in Augustine's speculations on creation, where he is quite unabashed in his use of Platonist tenets. Augustine's concept of God is based upon the idea of a hierarchy of being pointing to a transcendent unity: what we have called 'A'. His acceptance of this Platonic theism actually militated against his taking pantheism very seriously. His differences with the Platonists were centred upon the incar? nation and (hence) the immanent nature of the Godhead ; not upon cos? mogony as such.39 More significantly, we cannot speak of the philosophical concept of God within the Christian tradition without reference to the much maligned dogma of the Trinity.40 Institut f?r Systematische Theologie, Fakult?t der Evangelischen Theologie, Ludwigs-Maximillians- Universit?t M?nchen, 8oygg M?nchen, Germany 39 Contra Priestley and Harnack see C J.
