<plain_text><page sequence="1">RETROCAUSATION AND THE FORMAL ASSIMILATION OF CLASSICAL ELECTRODYNAMICS TO NEWTONIAN MECHANICS: A REPLY TO NISSIM-SABAT'S "ON GRUNBAUM AND RETROCAUSATION9"* ADOLF GRUNBAUM AND ALLEN I. JANIS University of Pittsburgh Dirac's classical electrodynamics countenances "preaccelerations" of charged particles at a time t as mathematical functions of external forces applied after the time t. These preaccelerations have been interpreted as evidence for physical retrocausation upon assuming that, in electrodynamics no less than in Newton's second law, external forces sustain an asymmetric causal relation to accelerations. And this retrocausal interpretation has just been defended against the critiques in (Griinbaum 1976), (Griinbaum and Janis, 1977 and 1978) by appeal to the formal assimilation of the electrodynamic laws of motion to Newton's second law. It is argued below that this latest defense of the retrocausal interpretation is even more ill-founded than the prior ones in the literature. 1. Introduction. In the preceding article, Nissim-Sabat takes issue extensively with an initial paper on "The Myth of Retrocausation in Classical Electrodynamics" (Griinbaum, 1976), and with a follow-up paper coauthored by Griinbaum and Janis (1977). We find Nissim- Sabat's account of our views incredibly undisciplined. Hence it will be expeditious to give a recapitulation of the salient tenets of Grunbaum (1976) and Griinbaum and Janis (1977) as a point of departure for this reply to him. Let "C" denote the asymmetric relation "is the cause or a cause of," while "E" denotes its asymmetric converse "is the effect or an effect of." Consider either punctal or spatio-temporally extended events x and y. Then we may say of x that it is causally connected with y when xEy no less than when xCy. And furthermore, we have reason to allow that events y and z are causally connected with each other even when neitheryCz noryEz. Hence if we denote the symmetric relation of causal connectedness by "CC," we can say that the disjunction xCy v xEy is a sufficient but not a necessary condition for xCCy. Clearly, the asymmetric causal relation C is logically stronger than the symmetric causal relation CC: xCy unilaterally entails xCCy. *Received July 1978; revised October 1978.

Copyright ? 1979 by the Philosophy of Science Association. 136</page><page sequence="2">RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS As in Griinbaum (1976, p. 166), we denote the asymmetric temporal relations "x is earlier than y" and "y is later than x" respectively by "x &lt;ty" and "y &gt;t x." Turning to (spatio-temporally extended) events E, and E2, we symbolize the claim that E2 retrocauses E or that E2 produces EI retrocausally by "E2 R E1." And we explicate this claim as follows: E2R El iff both E2 C E andE2 &gt;t E . For example, just this is the construal of retrocausation in the papers by John Earman that are criticized in Griinbaum (1976) and Griinbaum and Janis (1977). And quite generally, this is the received construal to which our papers have been addressed. It is crucial to note at once that, since E2 CC E1 is much weaker than E2 C E1, the conjunction E2 CC E1 and E2&gt;, E is not at all sufficient to assure that E2 R E1. Thus, assume E2 &gt;t E1 and that an electrodynamic equation permits us to retrodict the occurrence of E 1 from the later occurrence of E2. Then even if this retrodictability were to legitimate the inference that E2 CC El, it would hardly also vouchsafe the stronger conclusion that E2R El. Next, let us summarize the mathematical specifics relevant to the retrocausal interpretation of classical electrodynamics, starting with the non-relativistic theory. We shall denote derivatives of a given physical property with respect to the time t by appropriate numbers of dots over the letter representing the property. And if m is the mass of a particle with charge e, and c is the velocity of light, then we shall put = (2/3)(e2/mc3) so that e is a time-interval which is called "the relaxation time" of the particle. In the particular case of an electron, E is the very short time-interval (=6 x 10-24 sec) required by a light ray to traverse a distance equal to two-thirds of the classical electron radius. If the charged particle is constrained to move in one dimension and is acted upon by a net external force f(t) independent of its velocity v and of its position, then its equation of motion is given by the Abraham- Lorentz law, which states that (1) m(v - ev) =f(t) When the external force is an explicit function of position, an exact solution of the equation of motion can be obtained for only a small number of space-dependent forces. Clearly, this equation of motion (1) for a charged particle of mass m subject to a net external force f(t) differs on its left-hand side from the corresponding Newtonian 137</page><page sequence="3">ADOLF GRUNBAUM AND ALLEN I. JANIS equation for an uncharged mass particle by the presence of the so-called "radiative reaction" term mevl, which involves the time-derivative of the acceleration i, i.e., a third time-derivative of the position of the particle. In the extremely special case in which the net external force on a neutral Newtonian mass particle is not of the formf(t) and just happens to depend on v, the Newtonian equation would then happen to involve such a third time-derivative. The general solution of Eq. (1) is as follows: (2) v(t) = e/E [e-to/E v(to) -- e' / f(t')dt' It will be noted that the presence of a time derivative of the acceleration v(t) in the Abraham-Lorentz law of Eq. (1) makes for the presence in its general solution (2) of a constant of integration which involves as a factor an initial acceleration (to). And Dirac pointed out that unless this initial acceleration in Eq. (2) has the particular value eto/E r (3) v (to) = e- ' f(t' )dt' Em J the following consequence will ensue from Eq. (2): For any and all external force functions f(t), the absolute value of the acceleration (t) at time t will approach infinity (oo) as t-&gt; oo. Having postulated that there are in fact no such "runaway" accelerations in nature, Dirac therefore imposed the particular initial acceleration specified by Eq. (3). But the conjunction of (3) with the Abraham-Lorentz law of Eq. (1) or with Eq. (2) entails the non-relativistic Diracian integro-differen- tial equation: et/E 0 (4) v(t)= e f(t')dt' Em t We shall sometimes refer to this Eq. (4) as "Dirac's temporally non-local equation." By the same token, we shall speak of the Abraham-Lorentz law of Eq. (1) as being a temporally "local" or "instantaneous" equation. Corresponding locutions will be used to refer to the relativistic counterparts of Eqs. (4) and (1) below. Eq. (4) has an important consequence in regard to the duration of preaccelerations which has been overlooked in some quarters. Thus consider an electron that has never been subjected to a force until a pulse of electromagnetic radiation first reaches it at a time T: As one of us stressed in (Griinbaum 1976, p. 195), if the integral from 138</page><page sequence="4">RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS Tto oo in Eq. (4) is non-zero, then "the electron has been preaccelerating throughout the entire infinite past before T, even though the amount of the preacceleration was appreciable for only a very short time." In the relativistic version of classical electrodynamics, the Abraham- Lorentz ("AL") equation (1) is supplanted by the Dirac-Lorentz ("DL") equation, which we may write in the form (5) m(v' - Evi) = K&gt;(t) where me (6) K"(t) =f (t) - 2-- V v`V c and f'(t) is the four-force that would arise from any combination of an incident electromagnetic field and other external forces. The usual summation convention with respect to repeated indices has been employed in Eq. (6). Just as Eq. (1), when coupled with a prohibition of "runaway" solutions, leads to the integro-differential equation (4), so also analogously Eq. (5), when coupled with a prohibition of "runaway" solutions, leads to the integro-differential equation et/ r (7) v (t )= e-t / K (t' )dt' em t According to the retrocausal interpretation of Eq. (4), the external forces f(t') corresponding to the time interval t &lt; t'&lt; ooc after t are collectively the asymmetric cause of the particle's preacceleration at the time t. For the sake of brevity, we shall symbolize this claim as follows: f(t')[t' &gt; t] R v(t). Hence, in the case of our example of the electron, the retrocausalist is claiming that the electron's preacceleration during the entire infinite past before T is retrocaused by the external forces f(t') acting collectively during the later times t' &gt; T. Mutatis mutandis, in the relativistic theory, the retrocausal interpretation can be put elliptically by saying that in virtue of Eq. (7), it is K' (t') [t' t ] which retrocauses v'&gt;(t). Griinbaum (1976) argued that the stated retrocausal interpretations of the above Eqs. (4) and (7) are false on the basis of the following set of considerations: If the respective mathematical linkages between f(t') and v (t), and between KJ(t' ) and v ' (t), in the integro-differential Eqs. (4) and (7) are to signify at least the symmetric causal connect- edness of acceleration with the corresponding kind of "force," Eqs. 139</page><page sequence="5">ADOLF GRUNBAUM AND ALLEN I. JANIS (4) and (7) need to have the nomic status of being a full-fledged law within their own respective theories. In and of itself, a mere mathemat- ical linkage is not automatically a full-blown law. But within the respective contexts of the given theories, Eqs. (4) and (7) have only a nomically lesser status despite being respectively asserted to qualify as physically true: Their nomic status is that of the conjunction of an "accidentally" true, nonlawlike, merely de facto boundary condition with a fully lawlike differential equation of motion. And if the specified kind of force thus does not even stand in the symmetric causal relation CC to the acceleration, it fails a fortiori to sustain the asymmetric causal relation C. Finally, since f(t') [t' &gt; t] C v(t) and K (t')[t' &gt; t] C i (t) are therefore respectively false within the causal ontolo- gies of their respective theories, the retrocausal interpretations of Eqs. (4) and (7) are likewise each false. Yet in Griinbaum (1976, p. 197) it was envisioned that the Diracian Eqs. (4) and (7) might somehow be shown to be full-fledged laws after all. In that case, our denial that, in either equation, the pertinent later force(s) and the preacceleration stand in the symmetric causal relation CC would not be justified after all. It was noted, however, that if this symmetric causal connectedness is now granted, it would hardly suffice to guarantee that furthermore the pertinent kind of force does sustain the asymmetric causal relation to the acceleration, as needed if this force is to stand in the asymmetric retrocausal relation R to the acceleration. Hence the proponents of the retrocausal interpretation were specifically challenged (Grunbaum 1976, p. 197) to show how-as between the pertinent kind of force and the acceleration-non-anthropomorphic criteria can single out the relevant force uniquely as causing the acceleration rather than vice versa, if they are granted that the Diracian mathematical linkage between them is indeed a full-fledged law. In our paper (1977), we showed that this challenge to demonstrate the stated required causal asymmetry was not met at all by John Earman's attempt to ground the causal asymmetry in question on the following alleged asymmetry of physical determination: In the temporally non-local Diracian Eqs. (4) and (7), the relevant kind of force uniquely determines the acceleration, but not conversely. For in our (1977) discussion we showed in mathematical detail for the case of Eq. (4) that insofar as any asymmetric determining role is played by one of these two physical entities vis-a-vis the other, it is the acceleration that asymmetrically determines or "dominates" the external force, instead of conversely! Hence the appeal to Earman's proposed dominance criterion of causal asymmetry boomerangs to the detriment of his construal of the retrocausal interpretation, since 140</page><page sequence="6">RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS the latter requires that it be the force which asymmetrically causes the acceleration. 2. The Causal Role of Forces and the Instantiation of Newton's Second Law of Motion by the Laws of Electrodynamics. Although (Griinbaum 1976) does deny that the external electrodynamic forcef(t') is causally linked to the charged particle's "acceleration," this paper specifically points out (pp. 195-196, item (c)) that the force in question is indeed causally connected to "the CHANGE in the time-weighted (not just time-dependent) acceleration." Hence Nissim-Sabat fabricated a straw man in the opening sentence of his Abstract by speaking very misleadingly of "Griinbaum's claim that the Abraham-Lorentz (AL) and Dirac-Lorentz (DL) equations have no bearing on causality." And as we shall now proceed to show, Nissim-Sabat's principal defense of the retrocausal interpretation of Eqs. (4) and (7) against the critiques given in Griinbaum (1976) and Grunbaum and Janis (1977) is vitiated by an equally slipshod neglect of attention to the specific relata that have been alleged to retrocause the preaccelerations (t) and v (t). Nissim-Sabat assumes that, in Newton's second law of motion F = ma, the force F does stand in the asymmetric causal relation C to the acceleration a. And claiming the derivability of the AL and DL equations (1) and (5) from Newton's second law, his principal defense of the retrocausal interpretation is that the AL and DL equations "should obey the same causality conditions as Newton's law" (Abstract). Thus he writes (section 3): "Griinbaum neglects one crucial fact: The Abraham-Lorentz equation is derivedfrom Newton's second order equation (or its relativistic, but still second order in time, equivalent)" [italics in original]. On the strength of this alleged derivability, Nissim-Sabat wants to gainsay the following contention of ours, which is defended at length in Grunbaum (1976, pp. 179-190): The AL law does not vouchsafe the existence of a causal linkage C between the external force f(t) and the acceleration v(t), just as Newton's second law provides no foundation for a causal dependence of a non-zero velocity as such on a non-zero external force. But Nissim-Sabat makes egregiously slipshod use of the notion of "causality condition" and/or of "derivability" from Newton's second law, as will emerge from our appraisal of the following two invocations (i) and (ii) of such derivability to buttress the stated retrocausal interpretations of Eqs. (4) and (7): (i) In section 3, Nissim-Sabat cites Jackson's phrase "the Newton equation of motion for the Abraham-Lorentz model" (1975, p. 790) as authority for the derivability of the pre-relativistic AL law (1) from Newton's F= mv. And immediately thereafter, Nissim-Sabat 141</page><page sequence="7">ADOLF GRUNBAUM AND ALLEN I. JANIS declares (section 3): "It is on this basis that physicists expect whatever causal connections between force and acceleration obtain for Newton's equation will obtain for the AL equation as well." (ii) In his Appendix, he offers a derivation of the relativistic DL law (5) from the relativistic counterpart of the formally Newtonian schema F = md. And on the strength of that putative derivation, he argues in his section 9 that in the context of the DL law, "we must expect the same causal relationship between force and accelera- tion as in Newtonian physics." As he sees it, the latter conclusion, in turn, then legitimates the retrocausal interpretation of Eq. (7). Now the fundamental issue posed by Nissim-Sabat's invocations (i) and (ii) of derivability from Newton's F = mv is whether he has shown the following: Such derivability as actually exists guarantees that the respective specified relata to which the retrocausal interpreta- tions of Eqs. (4) and (7) pertain do sustain the relation C. We shall contend against Nissim-Sabat's stated arguments (i) and (ii) that he has failed altogether to furnish the demonstration just stated. When offering our critique of his arguments (i) and (ii), brevity will be served by speaking of "the causal specificity of the retrocausal interpretation" to convey the following cardinal fact: Using Eqs. (4) and (7) as its premisses, the specific relata of which the retrocausal interpretation of preacceleration predicates the retrocausal relation R, and thereby the asymmetric causal relation C, are the respective ordered pairs {f(t')[t' t], v(t))-where f(t') is the external force!-and {(K(t')[t' &gt; t], v (t)}, where K (t') is the particular quantity specified by Eq. (6). Let us now examine, in turn, Nissim-Sabat's arguments (i) and (ii). (i). When Nissim-Sabat adduced Jackson's phrase "The Newton equation of motion for the Abraham-Lorentz model," he neglected a crucial point: Jackson obtained the A L-law (1) by avowedly modifying (1975, pp. 783-784) "the Newton equation of motion." Specifically, Jackson (1975, p. 783) denotes the net external force vector by "Fe," and writes "the Newton equation of motion" in vector form as (8) m = Fext But Jackson explicitly notes (p. 783) that, in the case of an accelerating point charge which emits radiation, one allows for the effect of that emission on its motion as follows: "we modify the Newton equation (17.5) [i.e., our Eq. (8) here] by adding a radiative reaction force Frad." And then Jackson carries out this modification by writing: (9) mv = Fext + Frad. 142</page><page sequence="8">RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS Thereupon (p. 784) he identifies Frad as (10) Frad m Tv, where his "T" is the "e" of our notation. Yet he cautions soon thereafter (p. 786) that this identification of Fad "while plausible, is certainly not rigorous or fundamental." And he had noted earlier (p. 782) that only for phenomena whose duration is of the order of his r (our e) "will we expect radiative effects to play a crucial role" (italics in original). Finally (p. 784), by substituting (10) in (9), he obtains what he calls "The modified equation of motion," which he writes as (11) m(v - /v) = Fext, Jackson points out that this equation is known as the AL-equation of motion. And clearly this is the vector form of our AL Eq. (1), since our net external force f(t) is the magnitude of Jackson's vector FeXt while our "E" is his "r." Hence we shall speak of Eq. (11) no less than of Eq. (1) as "the AL equation." As is evident from Jackson's account, the AL Eq. (11) for a charged particle is logically incompatible with Newton's Eq. (8), instead of being deducible from the latter! Clearly even the extremely special case in which the F xt of the Newtonian Eq. (8) just happens to be proportional to v can hardly vouchsafe Nissim-Sabat's invocation in his section 3 of Jackson's treatment to claim the deducibility of Eq. (11) from Eq. (8). Thus, insofar as Jackson obtained the AL equation from Newton's law itself, it was patently not by "derivation" in the deductive sense, but rather by a modification that might also be viewed as a kind of formal assimilation: Whatever turns out to be equal to mv is then held to be the "total force" on the particle, as distinct from the net external force Fext, which is the net impressed force of Newton's second law in the case of a particle. In particular, as was stressed in Griinbaum (1976, p. 181) and is evident from Eq. (2), the relation of determination sustained by the external force to the acceleration in Newton's Eq. (8) is not sustained at all by their counterparts in the AL law. Hence Nissim-Sabat cannot possibly be entitled to invoke Jackson's "derivation" as a basis for the following inference: If Fe,x Cv is granted for the case of Newton's Eq. (8), then the same asymmetric causal relation is also guaranteed to obtain between their electrodynamic counterparts in the A L Eq. (11). Afortiori, the "derivation" in question cannot gainsay our contention (Grunbaum 1976, pp. 179-190) that the AL law provides no foundation for such a causal relation between the particular relata Fext and v(t). In short, Nissim-Sabat overlooks that whatever the relata of such causal 143</page><page sequence="9">ADOLF GRUNBAUM AND ALLEN I. JANIS relations as are actually vouchsafed by the AL Eq. (11), Jackson's "derivation" of the latter equation is patently not such as to deliver via Eq. (11) the causal relation C between the specific electrodynamic quantities Fext and v of that equation. And yet it is the latter specific relational claim which is required in Nissim-Sabat's argument to sustain the retrocausal interpretation of Eq. (4). Using our earlier abbreviatory parlance, we can say that Nissim-Sabat's argument (i) was cavalierly heedless of the "causal specificity" of the retrocausal interpretation. Of course, once it is assumed that the acceleration of a charged particle does have an asymmetric dynamic cause, this assumption will legitimate an inquiry into the cause of a given acceleration. But unless and until Nissim-Sabat can justify this assumption in the case of the AL Eq. (11) for the specific relata he has in mind, his explicit demand (in his section 5, A) for the cause of the value of the initial acceleration v(to) in the AL solution (2) rests on a wholly unfounded presupposition. Having nonetheless accepted this presupposition on the strength of his fallacious "derivability" argument, he finds himself driven to see a "paradox" in the vector form of our Eq. (2) when he writes (section 5, A): A) Equation (2) is most interesting in that the acceleration at to is to be specified independently of the AL equation. As we indicated above this is a paradox for the AL equation is derived from F = md and thus we must ask what causes this acceleration insofar as all the forces are already included in the AL equation. Though the "paradox" allegedly posed by Eq. (2) is of Nissim- Sabat's own creation, his statement of it bespeaks his initial suspicion that there may be a non-sequitur that vitiates his central thesis. Yet he altogether fails to come to grips with the latter difficulty when he proceeds to explain how he proposes to dissolve the supposed paradox: He points out irrelevantly that there is genuine empirical warrant for the Diracian boundary condition (3). And (3) does specify the value of the initial acceleration v(to) that had "paradoxically" been left as an undetermined constant of integration in the solution (2) of the AL differential Eq. (1) of motion. But the empirical credentials of Eq. (3) are irrelevant as a basis for dissolving the "paradox" for the following reason: If Nissim- Sabat's causal argument from derivability had been sound, no such lacuna of causal determination of the acceleration should characterize Eq. (2) when taken by itself. And hence there should be no need at all to resort to the empirically well-founded initial condition (3) to provide the missing specificity for v(to). Thus, the granted empirical warrant for Eq. (3) cannot fill the logical 144</page><page sequence="10">RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS hiatus in the non-sequitur vitiating his derivability argument for concluding that Fext C v in the AL equation. Yet he then invokes this conclusion in his section 5 to affirm the retrocausal interpretation of Eq. (4) after having correctly obtained Eq. (4) from the conjunction of (2) and (3). Let us briefly return to his invocation of the fact that Jackson (1975, p. 790) spoke of "the Newton equation of motion for the Abraham-Lorentz model." And let us recall that Jackson issued a disclaimer of rigor (1975, p. 786) regarding the expression (10) for Frad, which he used when modifying Newton's Eq. (8) to obtain the AL law (11). Then we can see how Jackson's more rigorous treatment in (1975, section 17.3, pp. 786-790) exhibits the Jacksonian "deriva- tion" of the AL law invoked by Nissim-Sabat to be an approximation to an infinite series. And that infinite series, in turn, constitutes a more rigorous modification of Newton's Eq. (8) than is constituted by the AL equation itself. Jackson (1975, p. 786) now writes Newton's equation of motion in the form dp/dt = Fext where p is the particle's linear momentum my, so that dp/dt = mi But, as Jackson then shows (section 17.3), in the electrodynamic model of Abraham and Lorentz, the value of dp/dt that needs to be equated to Fext is not at all mv; instead, it is given by an infinite series (1975, p. 789, Eq. (17.28)) whose first two terms are-in our own notation-(4/3)mv - mev. Thus, it is only upon neglecting the terms containing third and higher time-derivatives of v that Jackson (p. 790) obtains "the Newton equation of motion for the Abraham- Lorentz model," which is the same as the AL equation (11) to within "the strange factor of 4/3 multiplying the electromagnetic mass." (ii). This brings us to the second of Nissim-Sabat's attempted vindications of the retrocausal interpretation: In his section 9, he invokes the preservation of causal relations under his derivation of the relativistic DL-law of our Eqs. (5) and (6) from the four-dimensional counterpart of Newton's second law. (His derivation itself is given in his Appendix.) The aim of his appeal to this preservation of causal relations is as follows: He hopes thereby to refute our contention that the DL-law provides no foundation for the particular causal claim K (t) C v&gt;. We base this contention of unfoundedness on precisely the same grounds, mutatis mutandis, as those we set forth in (Grunbaum 1976, pp. 179-190) for maintaining that the AL-law of Eq. (1) does not warrant the causal assertion f(t) C v. And by thus countering that the DL-law does sustain the causal thesis K'(t) C i after all, 145</page><page sequence="11">ADOLF GRUNBAUM AND ALLEN I. JANIS Nissim-Sabat hopes to clear the way for then, in turn, doing the following: Adducing the latter causal thesis to justify the retrocausal interpretation of the relativistic Eq. (7). In short, to vindicate this affirmation of retrocausation, Nissim-Sabat invokes causality-pres- ervation in his section 9 as follows: He adduces his "Newtonian" derivation of the DL-law as his basis for concluding that "we must expect the same causal relationship between force and acceleration as in Newtonian physics." But we shall argue that here Nissim-Sabat trades on a grossly ambiguous use of the tantalizingly non-specific term "force," when he reasons that, by this appeal to causality-preservation, he has actually demonstrated the following: In the DL-law, the specific quantity K (t) stands in the causal relation C to v 7(t), a specific causal claim crucial to his vindication of the retrocausal interpretation of Eq. (7). Thus it will turn out that his invocation of causality-preservation is vitiated by his blithe disregard for the causal specificity essential to the retrocausal interpretation at issue. To characterize the point of departure of Nissim-Sabat's derivation of the DL-law, we suppose that the vector equation J= mv is taken to express the following construal of Newton's second law of motion: Instead of being confined to being the net external force Fext of Jackson's aforementioned reading, ~is more inclusively the "total force." In this vein, Nissim-Sabat asks us to consider the four-dimen- sional counterpart of = mv, which we shall write as J-m- mv`(t- = 1,2,3,4). Clearly, even on this liberalized construal, Newton's law can hardly be held to vouchsafe the deducibility of the DL-law (5) until and unless we are given a further premiss that expresses the total four-force as a function of some other physical quantities. Nissim-Sabat's derivation (Appendix) takes cognizance of the need for such an additional premiss by arguing that this premiss ought to be (12) J = mE iV +f' (t) - (me/c2) 2 v = me ev' + K&gt;(t). Once Eq. (12) is granted, the DL-law of our Eqs. (5) and (6) clearly follows from - = mv C. For our purposes here, we shall not question the justification that Nissim-Sabat offers for Eq. (12). And moreover, we shall even grant him that he is entitled to claim preservation of causality under his derivation of the DL-law if this preservation is explicitly understood in the following sense: Given that ~C v in Newton's law, then the total four-force F of Eq. (12) likewise stands in the causal relation Cto v&gt;. 146</page><page sequence="12">RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS But, having taken all of this as granted at least for argument's sake, we hasten to point out emphatically that the conclusion YV C vF is still a far cry from the desired result K" C v&gt;, which Nissim-Sabat urgently needs, if the derivability invoked in his section 9 is to sustain the retrocausal interpretation of Eq. (7): Since K' differs from l, the kind of causality-preservation that we just granted him for the F of Eq. (12) as a whole is patently insufficient to underwrite the claim K' C v&gt;, which was to be deduced. Hence it is urgent that we ask on just what grounds Nissim-Sabat claims to have demonstrated the followingfurther thesis of "special- ized causality-preservation": If F" C v on the strength of Newton's law, then the DL-law guarantees via Eq. (12) that K (t) C v . Perhaps he assumed tacitly that, in virtue of the composition of F' given in Eq. (12), F C v~ guarantees each of the following particular causal assertions: (a) mevi C 1v, (b)f/(t) C v,' (c) (me/c2)v2 V w C v, , and (d) K (t) C v . If he did not assume such general "distributivity" of asymmetric causation under the decomposition of 9 given by Eq. (12), how can he have singled out K '(t) in particular from the right-hand side of Eq. (12) to infer (d)? Clearly, in the absence of further argument, such singling out simply begs the question at issue in his second attempted vindication of the retrocausal inter- pretation. On the other hand, let us suppose that he did not thus single out K'(t) question-beggingly. Instead, assume that he rests the stated further thesis of specialized causality-preservation on the distributivity of asymmetric causation under any decomposition of F, such as the decomposition given by Eq. (12). Given the latter construal of his reasoning, we are prompted to make two critical comments as follows: 1. The stated distributivity of causation is at best undemonstrated. And thus Nissim-Sabat's second attempted vindication lacks the cogency to achieve the following objective of his paper: To refute our aforementioned detailed charge that the DL-law simply provides no foundation for the claim K'(t) C v&gt;(t). Indeed, there is even nothing in his second proposed vindication that serves more weakly to undermine our justification for charging such unfoundedness. 2. We go beyond maintaining that Nissim-Sabat has failed to demonstrate the stated distributivity of causation under a decomposi- tion of the "total force" r-. Specifically, we shall now try to argue as follows: Even in the original context of Newton's law F= mv, such distributivity of causation is quite dubious, because it yields consequences that, at leastprimafacie, just do not make causal sense. Turning to Newton's second law, we can decompose its 3-by 147</page><page sequence="13">ADOLF GRUNBAUM AND ALLEN I. JANIS writing '= (-A- A) + A, where A is quite arbitrary to within merely having the dimensions of a force. Then we can clearly rewrite Newton's -= mv equivalently in the form m = (r- A) + A. For example, we can write mY = [oF- (1/3)mv] + (1/3)mw Now, as throughout, assume that SC v. If Nissim-Sabat does invoke the stated distributivity of causation, then he is claiming warrant for inferring both [J- (1/3)mv] C v, and (1/3)m v C v, where (1/3)mv is just an arbitrary constituent of the total force . Thus, the latter of these two conclusions tells us that a "constituent force" proportional to none other than the acceleration itself stands in the asymmetric causal relation C to that very acceleration! In other words, a physical quantity proportional to the particle's accelera- tion at the time t is held to influence the particle physically to have (or acquire) the very acceleration that it does have at t. We submit that such a conclusion is rendered absurd by its utter trivialization of the causal relation C. More generally, regardless of whether one restricts A to quantities pertaining to the particle involved or not, it seems absurd to conclude from S C v that, for any arbitrary A within the restriction in question, A C v and (F-- A) C v. But let us suppose that the latter doubts were deemed insufficient to discredit the stated distributivity of causation. Even then it would remain that Nissim-Sabat's vindication of the retrocausal interpretation of Eq. (7) was quite unsuccessful as follows: His derivation of the DL-law from F = mz" does not suffice to show that K"(t) C v" over and above F C v . Mere causality-preservation with respect to the ." of Eq. (12) as a whole does not assure furthermore the aforestated specialized causality-preservation that is indispensable to his vindication of the retrocausal thesis. 3. Nissim-Sabat's Additional Arguments for the Retrocausal Interpreta- tion. As if his unwarranted inference of K"(t) C v " were not enough, Nissim-Sabat proceeds to chide us in his section 9 for failure to have drawn the following allegedly "obvious" conclusion from our 148</page><page sequence="14">RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS Eqs. (7) and (6), which are jointly equivalent to his Eq. (11): "There is retrocausation between the acceleration at times later than t and the acceleration at t." In our notation, the equation on which Nissim-Sabat rests this new allegation of retrocausation, i.e., his (11), is the following: e t , me (13) v&gt;`(t)= et/ f(t')---2 v2(t')v (t) )dt Em t c In his section 9, he leads up to the purportedly obvious new conclusion of retrocausation by means of the following assertions: 1) Since the acceleration v enters on the right-hand side of our Eq. (13) no less than on its left side, this equation is not a solution for lv(t). 2) "No less than a complete knowledge of the acceleration for all times later than t is necessary for the determination of the acceleration at t." 3) "Griinbaum and Janis stop here and thus they fail to draw an obvious conclusion." We shall now comment on each of these three claims in turn. 1. As Nissim-Sabat acknowledges, in our (1977, p. 481), we adduced claim 1) as one of the premisses for showing the following: "Earman's assertion that the force dominates the acceleration is thus even less warranted in the relativistic case than in the non-relativistic one." 2. Nissim-Sabat's second premiss is, as it stands, not only undemon- strated but is quite insufficient for his purpose, even if it is true. Let us see first why we claim it to be undemonstrated despite the prima facie plausibility that Nissim-Sabat garnered for it from the form of our Eq. (13), which is his Eq. (11). What Eq. (13) above does show is that in that particular form of asserting its content, the values of v((t')[t' &gt; t] are required mathematically on its right-hand side for the unique determination of v (t) on its left side. But, since the same variable v occurs on both sides of Eq. (13), it does not necessarily follow that, in every logically equivalent reformulation of that equation, the values of (t') [t' &gt; t] are required for unique determination. Yet Nissim- Sabat's second premiss maintains that there is the latter kind of requiredness, which we shall call "requiredness simpliciter." A quite elementary example of two logically equivalent forms of the assertion made by a given equation will now illustrate that Nissim-Sabat's prima facie plausibility of requiredness is not tanta- mount to requiredness simpliciter when the same variable occurs on both sides of the given form of an equation. Consider the equation 149</page><page sequence="15">ADOLF GRUNBAUM AND ALLEN I. JANIS (14) x(t) = x o+ x(t')dt ifferentiation of tis equation with respect to t leads to the differential equation i = x, which is readily integrated by separation of variables to give (15) x(t) = xe't where the constant of integration has been set equal to xo in order to agree with the condition x(0) = xo that follows from Eq. (14). Conversely, one could start with Eq. (15) and derive from it the differential equation x = x. Formal integration of both sides,of this latter equation between the limits of 0 and t, together with the condition x(O) = xo that follows from Eq. (15), then yields Eq. (14). Thus Eqs. (14) and (15) are logically equivalent. Now consider values of t in Eq. (14) prior to t = 0. Then one might paraphrase Nissim-Sabat's assertion about Eq. (13) and say the following: In order to determine x at t it is necessary to know x for all later times up to 0. Yet one would hardly be warranted in making such an assertion about Eq. (15). By the same token, we suppose that, if there is an equation equivalent to Eq. (13) but giving an explicit solution for the acceleration at time t, Nissim-Sabat would surely not wish to adduce that hypothet- ical equation to claim the need for knowing the subsequent values of the acceleration in order to determine v'l(t). We do not know the conditions under which it is possible to find such an equation equivalent to Eq. (13). It seems to us, however, that in order to demonstrate Nissim-Sabat's second premiss it would be necessary to show that such an equation does not exist for any force function 9- (t). So much for Nissim-Sabat's failure to demon- strate his second premiss. We now proceed to argue that his premiss 2) is quite insufficient for his purpose, even if it is true as it stands. In order to do so, we note first that his purpose in invoking the stated requirement for the unique determination of v3(t) is as follows: He wants to use the premiss "The set X of values of v 1 is mathematically required for the unique determination of v&gt;(t)" to vouchsafe the conclusion that the physical realization of the values in X is the asymmetric cause of ivl(t). In particular, if also the values in X are physically realized after the value v '(t), then he wants to be able to infer that this realization asymmetrically retrocauses iv (t). Now suppose for argument's sake that the premiss 2) above is demonstrable simpliciter as stated. Even then, Nissim-Sabat would first have to show at least the following: Within the class of the values of v3 (t')-and/ or within 150</page><page sequence="16">RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS the class of subsets of these values-the relation of being-required-for- unique-determination is such as to yield the asymmetry of the retro- causal relation, which the stated requiredness relation is intended to undergird. Instead of having furnished this urgent demonstration, Nissim-Sabat blithely took its feasibility for granted. But imagine that he could furnish this proof. Even then it would still be open to question whether the hypothesizedly asymmetric relation of being- required-for-unique-mathematical-determination is sufficient to assure the fulfillment of the causal asymmetry needed for retrocausation. 3. We never affirmed his premiss 2) of requiredness as stated by him, but only premiss 1). Hence it was highly misleading for him to have said right after stating his premiss 2) that "Griinbaum and Janis stop here." It is now evident that we had abundant reason for refraining from drawing the purported "obvious" new conclusion of retrocausation that Nissim-Sabat chides us for not having drawn. But in subsection C of his section 5, he adduces our own results (1977) on "dominance" relations between v(t) andf(t) to offer yet another defense of the retrocausal interpretation of preacceleration. We regret to have to say that we find this particular defense to be a mere exercise in misleading futility as we shall now explain. Nissim-Sabat writes (section 5, C): The paper by Griinbaum and Janis [the reference given here is to our (1977)] suggests yet another way of looking at the question of causality in the AL equation. They introduce the concept of "dominance" . . in equation (1) the acceleration v,(t) dominates the force. At this point, we recall the remarks by Earman quoted in section (2): "If there is any paradigm case of causation, it is the force as a cause of acceleration." We see that here the effect, the acceleration, [asymmetrically] determines the cause, the force, a situation which one ought [sic!] to classify as "retrocausation." Insofar as Eq. (1)-as distinct from Eq. (4)-is concerned, the pertinent upshot of our account (1977, pp. 478-480) of the dominance of the acceleration over the external force f(t) can be summarized more carefully than in Nissim-Sabat's statement as follows: Assume that the acceleration v(t) is given at every instant of the "doubly infinite" time interval - oo &lt; t &lt; + oo and that at every moment of this interval, the acceleration function has a well-defined time-deriva- tive v(t). Furthermore, let it be understood that our impending statements pertain to the specified doubly infinite time interval. It then follows from Eq. (1) that the values of the force f(t) are 151</page><page sequence="17">ADOLF GRUNBAUM AND ALLEN I. JANIS uniquely determined by the acceleration at every instant t. On the other hand, if instead we are given the values off(t) at every moment, then the value of i(t) is not at all uniquely determined for even one single instant, let alone for every such moment! Moreover, if we are given the values of v(t) and of iv(t) at just one instant t, then Eq. (1) tells us that the value off(t) at t is uniquely determined. Thus, not only doesf(t)failto dominate v (t), but v(t) indeed dominates f(t). Now turn to our last quotation from Nissim-Sabat. And recall that, as we have argued, at least in the context of the AL-law, he is not entitled to claim that the force asymmetrically causes the acceleration. But clearly, if one does take this claim of causal asymmetry for granted, then the temporally non-local Eq. (4)-as distinct from the AL Eq. (1)-does warrant the retrocausal interpretation of pre- acceleration without any further ado. For in Eq. (4), the assumedly asymmetric cause can indeed be physically realized after its putative effect. Instead of thus invoking Eq. (4), Nissim-Sabat has invited us to draw the following inference: Since the putative effect does dominate the avowed cause in the temporally local (instantaneous) AL equation, as summarized above from our (1977), this situation is of a kind "which one ought to classify as 'retrocausation.'" In short, he is undaunted by our demonstration that Earman's proposed dominance explication of asymmetric causation boomeranged qua attempted vindication of the retrocausal interpretation. And, as we shall now see, he resorts to a quite misleading terminological gambit as a means of snatching victory for backward electrodynamic causation out of the jaws of this defeat of its alleged vindication. Let "E2" denote the (extended) event of the physical instantiation of the putative cause (the force), while "E" denotes the corresponding instantiation of the supposed effect (the acceleration), our subscripts having been chosen advisedly. How then are we to fathom Nissim-Sabat's inference that on the strength of the stated dominance of E, (the acceleration) over E2 (the force) in the temporally instantaneous Eq. (1), the claim E2 C E 1 is to license the conclusion that E2 R E I ? The latter retrocausal assertion requires that E2 &gt;t E , i.e., that the occurrence E of the acceleration temporally precedes the application E2 of the force. Of course, in the temporally non-instantaneous Eq. (4)-as distinct from the temporally local AL Eq. (1)-this temporal relation of precedence is affirmed. But this is wholly beside the point, since Nissim-Sabat purports to justify a retrocausal interpretation of the temporally local AL Eq. (1) rather than of the non-local Eq. (4). As we noted early in section 1, what is "retro" in the received meaning of "retrocausa- 152</page><page sequence="18">RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS tion" is that the order of cause and effect with respect to temporal precedence is the reverse (opposite) of their order with respect to the causal relation C. It is an altogether misleading idiosyncratic abuse of already preempted language to propose fulfilling the "retro" requirement of "retrocausation" by substituting an asymmetric relation of determination for the asymmetric relation of temporal precedence. Hence it is simply unavailing to Nissim-Sabat's proposed classification of the asymmetric determination of the presumed cause (the force) by the effect (the acceleration) as a case of "retrocausation" that the following is true: The order of acceleration and force with respect to the relation of asymmetric determination is indeed the reverse of their putative order with respect to the causal relation C. And, in any case, no such misleading terminological gambit can serve to gainsay our critique of the received retrocausal interpretation of preaccelera- tion. We conclude that Nissim-Sabat has frivolously traded on an abuse of the term "retrocausation," when claiming that the dominance of acceleration over force in Eq. (1) warrants a retrocausal interpretation of that AL-law. Yet he presumably had this "non-confining" usage of "retrocausation" in mind, when he complained in the last paragraph of his section 1 that the sloppy definition he there fabricates as Griinbaum's is "much too confining." This complaint occurs as the conclusion of the following tissue of falsehoods, which he states thus (end of his section 1): The question which remains, and the one to which Grunbaum addresses himself exclusively is whether these [AL and DL] equations allow one to conceive of retrocausation. Although the argument may seem academic (for no one can deny that purely ad hoc retrocausal equations can be written) it is still very much worth pursuing for it sheds much light on physical theory. Before we undertake a thorough analysis of Griinbaum's work, we must state what we understand Grunbaum means by "retro- causation." Retrocausation obtains if the force at time t2 uniquely determines the acceleration at time t1 with tI earlier than t2, such determination being made by means of a scientific "law" without the imposition of "boundary conditions." This definition is much too confining as we shall see, and we doubt that this is what Earman had in mind in the papers Grunbaum is criticizing. These irritatingly slipshod formulations prompt the following com- ments. 1. If retrocausation is physically possible then it must also be logically possible, though not conversely. Hence anyone who addresses 153</page><page sequence="19">ADOLF GRUNBAUM AND ALLEN I. JANIS the question of physical possibility thereby is also dealing with the issue of logical possibility, but not conversely. As is made abundantly clear in the concluding section II of our (1977) as well as in the concluding paragraph of section 1 in Griinbaum (1976), these papers addressed the following question of physical possibility of retrocausa- tion: Assuming that either the non-relativistic or relativistic version of classical electrodynamics is physically true, does the preacceleration phenomenon predicted by the version in question constitute a bona fide actual case of retrocausation? Clearly, if the answer were affirma- tive, the logical possibility or conceivability of retrocausation would follow as a weaker consequence. Hence it is false to say that the question to which Griinbaum addresses himself exclusively is whether the A L and DL equations "allow" one to "conceive of retrocausation". The various philosophers who do deny even the logical possibility of retrocausation on the ground of conceptual incoherence will be interested to learn from Nissim-Sabat that "no one can deny that purely ad hoc retrocausal equations can be written" and that the argument concerning the logical possibility of retrocausation therefore "may seem academic." As was emphasized in Grunbaum (1976, pp. 181-189) by reference to the example of Newtonian retrodictability of pre-velocities from subsequently applied forces, retrodictive equa- tions do not carry such retrocausal significance as they may have on their sleeves: It needs to be shown that their retrodictive assertions also do have retrocausal significance, instead of assuming with Nissim-Sabat that retrodictiveness is tantamount to retrocausality without any further ado. The aforementioned illustration of the retrodictability of pre-velocities (Griinbaum 1976, pp. 181-189) is a telling counterexample to this naive claim of sufficiency. Hence, contrary to Nissim-Sabat, the mere ad hoc concoctability of retrodictive equations does not suffice to establish even the mere conceivability of retrocausation. 2. Nissim-Sabat fails to see that the definition of "retrocausation" given in our section 1 above had never been at issue in either Griinbaum (1976) or Griinbaum and Janis (1977) between ourselves and any of the advocates of the retrocausal interpretation of preaccelerations. Only the credentials of the latter interpretation were under contention: The question was and is whether classical electrodynamics can be justifiably claimed to furnish a bonafide or actual physical illustration of the agreed construal of "retrocausation" upon taking it for granted that either Eq. (4) or Eq. (7) is physically true. As one of us has written: Hence, if the Abraham-Lorentz and Lorentz-Dirac equations are 154</page><page sequence="20">RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS to be disallowed as laws of motion, then the issue posed by the retrocausal interpretation of the Diracian equations clearly does not even arise! Thus, my concern in this essay is only with the soundness of that interpretation, once it is assumed that the Abraham-Lorentz and Lorentz-Dirac equations are electrodynami- cally pertinent laws of motion. (Griinbaum 1976, p. 171) Now Nissim-Sabat maintains at the start of his section 1 that the classical AL and DL equations indeed ought to be disallowed as laws of motion. But his principal reason for this judgment is the following demonstratedly false assertion: These pre-quantum laws predict preaccelerations whose duration is only of the order of 10-23 sec., a time interval so short that "quantum effects already predominate for time intervals which are a billion times longer," so that "extrapo- lating a classical equation to such time intervals" is silly. But there can be no question of any such temporal extrapolation: As we recalled in section 1 above from Griinbaum (1976, p. 195), at least in the non-relativistic theory, an electron can have a non-zero preacceleration throughout an infinite past time, even though the amount of its preacceleration will be "appreciable" for only the very short time adduced by Nissim-Sabat. Hence, at least in the case of the pre-rela- tivistic version, the durations of the preaccelerations in fact counte- nanced by the theory cannot serve to impugn the physical relevance of the classical theory. And as for the relativistic theory, note first that in Eq. (7) the so-called "effective force" K(t') [t' &gt; t] plays the same formal role-qua determinant of the preacceleration-as is played in the non-relativistic Eq. (4) by the external forcef(t') [t' &gt; t]. Presumably for just this reason, the retrocausal interpretation of Eq. (7) has focused on the purportedly asymmetric causal role of K'(t')[t' &gt; t] rather than on the external force fJ(t')[t' &gt; t], which is only a constituent of K'(t')[t' &gt; t]. Yet, if one does thus focus on Kx(t')[t' &gt; t], then the incorrectness of Nissim-Sabat's thesis of the evanescence of any and all preacceleration becomes evident in the relativistic theory by the very reasoning that enabled us to point out its falsity (Griinbaum 1976, p. 195) for the non-relativistic theory: Just as in Eq. (4) an impulsive external force f(t') that is first applied at t' = T can retrodict a non-zero preacceleration for all earlier times t' such that -oo &lt; t' &lt; T, so also in Eq. (7) a similarly applied impulsive "effective force" K'(t') will do likewise for the infinite past before T. But if the relativistic preacceleration is to be related more complica- tedly to the application of the external force f (t')[t' &gt; t I, then we must point out the following: Nissim-Sabat has hardly shown that 155</page><page sequence="21">ADOLF GRUNBAUM AND ALLEN I. JANIS preaccelerations cannot have durations exceeding considerably the time intervals during which quantum phenomena become paramount, or even be of infinite duration. Incidentally, the preacceleration yielded by the theory for the case of an impulsive force does not derive, as Nissim-Sabat would have it, from the AL-law (1) (or DL-law (5)) alone, but from the stronger integro-differential Eq. (4) (or Eq. (7)). Nissim-Sabat's gross conflation of the definition of "retrocausation" on the one hand with the statement of the retrocausal interpretation of electrodynamic preacceleration phenomena on the other, vitiates his avowed understanding of "what . .. Grinbaum means by 'retro- causation."' His formulation of the latter meaning is a caricature: It saddles one of us with assent to a unique determination criterion of causality that is even too weak to contain the asymmetry requirement of Earman's dominance criterion for causal asymmetry, which we had not endorsed anyway. The only extent to which Nissim-Sabat's formulation does depict our views correctly here is as follows: In the appraisal of the retrocausal interpretation given in Grunbaum (1976), we had enunciated the pure lawlikeness of the mathematical linkage between events as a necessary condition for their causal connectedness (CC). Having caricatured "what . . . Griinbaum means by 'retrocausa- tion,"' Nissim-Sabat feels prompted to object that the alleged "defini- tion" is "much too confining" and that we can be presumed to have been arguing at cross purposes with Earman. But it is patent that the "definition" of retrocausation was never under contention between us and Earman. Instead of arguing at cross purposes with him or with other defenders of the retrocausal interpretation, we did join the issue in regard to the soundness of that interpretation. Obviously, the appraisal of that soundness turns, in part, on the necessary and/or sufficient conditions for asserting that f(t') [t' &gt; t] or K"(t') [t' &gt; t] respectively sustain the asymmetric causal relation C to v (t) or v (t). The thesis of Griinbaum (1976) was that Eqs. (4) and (7) violate one such necessary condition and that, in any case, no non-anthropomor- phic sufficient condition had been articulated by the proponents of the retrocausal interpretation of these equations. And the burden of our (1977) was that if one were to accept Earman'sparticular criterion of dominance as sufficient for causal asymmetry, then this criterion boomerangs and hence is unavailing for the retrocausal interpretation. As we pointed out in section 1, and will see further in section 4 below, the use we made in Griinbaum (1976) of pure lawlikeness to indict the retrocausal interpretation-for violating a necessary condition for causal connectedness-may indeed be open to question. 156</page><page sequence="22">RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS But if it is thus open to question, what is thereby undermined is only the strong charge of falsity against that interpretation, not the weaker charge of unfoundedness. And thus the retrocausal interpreta- tion still stands indicted as gratuitous. 4. The Import of Blurring the Distinction Between Laws and Boundary (Initial) Conditions. We have made the following comment on our Eq. (13) above: Although Dirac's prescription of the value of v (t ) is a universal statement by holding alike for all charged mass particles, its status within his theory is clearly that of an "accidental" rather than lawlike universal, since it specifies the value of a mere constant of integration within the fundamental equation of motion. (Grun- baum 1976, p. 186) This statement has two features relevant here: (1) It appeals to "the difference between a presumably lawlike (or nomic) universal statement and a universal assertion which, if true, is presumed to hold only 'accidentally,' as it were" (Griinbaum 1976, p. 176), (2) it predicates the classification of Eq. (3) as a non-lawlike, defacto, only "acciden- tally" true statement on the fact that Eq. (3) is a boundary condition specified by the value of a mere constant of integration within the fundamental equation of motion. In our most recent paper, we sought to clarify further just why Eq. (3) is not purely lawlike as follows: Some philosophers have maintained that the mere universality of a statement is not sufficient to make it purely lawlike, because there are universal statements which, if true, are merely "acciden- tally" true by happenstance, as it were. For by contrast to lawlike universal assertions, the merely de facto ones do not assert the impossibility but only the accidental nonactuality of exceptions to them [footnote omitted]. We are inclined to think that in the context of a dynamical theory such as Dirac's, which deals with types of processes that are repeatedly exemplified, the distinction between a law and a defacto boundary condition is not blurred, and that even when the specification of the value of a constant of integration is asserted to apply universally, as in the case of Eq. (3), it still fails to qualify as purely lawlike. (Griinbaum and Janis 1978, p. 340) The reader will recall from our summary in section I above how Griinbaum (1976) invoked the attribution of non-lawlikeness to Eq. (3)-and to its relativistic counterpart-to level the charge of falsity 157</page><page sequence="23">ADOLF GRUNBAUM AND ALLEN I. JANIS against the retrocausal interpretation of Eqs. (4) and (7). But now suppose that the following could be shown: (a) The famil- iar distinction between lawlikeness and the mere happenstance fact- likeness of boundary conditions is fundamentally blurred, not only in cosmology (cf. Grunbaum 1976, p. 176) but also in the context of classical electrodynamics, where a universal boundary condition is specified by the value of a constant of integration, and accordingly (b) Eq. (4) or (7) does qualify as a full-fledged law after all within classical electrodynamic theory. How damaging would this be to our theses in Griinbaum (1976) and our (1977)? Clearly, even if successful, such a demonstration could not be detrimental at all to our argument in our (1977), which was that Earman's dominance criterion for asymmetric causation has failed to sustain the retrocausal interpreta- tion. For there we posited the lawlikeness of Eq. (7) when we wrote: In thus charging that his [Earman's] defense of electrodynamic retrocausation is ill-founded, we grant-for the sake of our argument here-the following assumption explicitly stated by Earman: The Diracian mathematical dependence of acceleration on the time-integral of the "effective force" function not only is physically true but also has the nomic status of being a full-fledged law. (Griinbaum and Janis 1977, pp. 475-476) What the putative success of the hypothetical demonstration of lawlikeness for Eqs. (4) or (7) would accomplish, however, is the following: It would undermine the particular reason given in Grunbaum (1976) for the falsity of the retrocausal interpretation, yet without at all militating against its actual falsity. And thus our contention in Griinbaum (1976) and our (1977) that electrodynamic retrocausation is at best gratuitous would still remain fully intact. But have Nissim-Sabat's considerations in his sections 4 and 8 furnished a cogent demonstration that either Eq. (4) or Eq. (7) are lawlike after all? We find that his assertions are philosophically untutored, quite unclear or simply gratuitous. Amazingly enough, he does not understand the following elementary point about the characterization of the assertedly actual value of a constant of integration as being "contingent" or "accidental," in contrast to being "lawlike": To say that v (to) does have the value specified by Eq. (3), for example, but is thus contingent or "accidental" patently is not to gainsay its empirical correctness in the least. On the contrary, to say that a particular boundary condition is physically realized is plainly to affirm it or to claim empirical warrant for it. Thus, by claiming that Eq. (3) is non-lawlike, we no more impugn 158</page><page sequence="24">RETROCAUSATION IN ELECTRODYNAMICS its physical truth or its experimental warrant than we cast aspersions on the empirical credentials of Eq. (1) by classifying the latter as lawlike. Unaware of this commonplace, Nissim-Sabat completely overlooks throughout his sections 4 and 8 that the empirical soundness of Eq. (3) was nowhere questioned in Griinbaum (1976) or our (1977), the sole issue having been its lawlikeness. Hence there is no point at all in the pseudo-antithesis expressed by the following untutored statement of his (section 4): "The boundary conditions imposed at infinity [via the requirement of Eq. (3)] are not 'accidental' as Griinbaum maintains. They reflect our knowledge of the universe." In his section 5, it is therefore totally off the mark for him to offer the presumed experimental support for Eq. (3) as "an immediate reply" to the characterization of Eq. (3) as "non- lawlike," a characterization affirmed in what he lists there as the two "salient points" of Griinbaum (1976). Incidentally, he omits a crucial third salient point made in Griinbaum (1976, p. 197). In the context of the AL equation, the asymmetric affirmation f(t) C v is wholly gratuitous, and yet precisely this affirmation is indispensable to the retrocausal interpretation. The examples he gives in his sections 4 and 8 from other physical theories irrelevantly harp on the red herring of physical applicability (empirical soundness). Or they are altogether too obscurely argued to enable us to discern just how they could be held to show the following: In the context of classical electrodynamics, no less than in the other theories adduced in the examples, the distinction between laws and specifications of constants of integration by boundary conditions is blurred, such that the latter enjoy nomic parity with the avowed "laws," instead of being merely de facto, non-lawlike physical truths. Indeed, we challenge Nissim-Sabat to give us an alternative formula- tion of classical electrodynamics satisfying the following concluding pronouncement of his section 8: "Very often different formulations of the same theory are available and what appears as a law in one formulation may be imposed as a boundary condition in another formulation." 5. Conclusion. We eschew dealing with a host of other allegations in which Nissim-Sabat plays fast and loose with our views. Their utter lack of rigor is perhaps epitomized by the way in which he dealt in his section 6 with (Griinbaum 1976, pp. 188-189). In the latter pages, we had elaborated on the following claims of ours: (i) Newton's second law alone vouchsafes the equation 159</page><page sequence="25">ADOLF GRUNBAUM AND ALLEN I. JANIS dI v = - F(t')dt', vo m to which shows that a non-zero time-integral of the force fails to qualify as either a necessary or a sufficient condition for a particle's possession of a non-zero VELOCITY as such at any one given time t. Instead, a non-zero time-integral of the force is by itself a lawfully necessary and sufficient condition for the endurance of a non-zero CHANGE of velocity or acceleration by a given kind of particle, and hence (ii) Newton's law repudiates the rival neo-Aristotelian assumption that a non-zero velocity is causally dependent as such on the action of a non-zero force. To impugn the ramifications of this contention, Nissim-Sabat offers several objections (section 6) which are typified by the following ludicrous piece de resistance: "Would an accusation of neo-Aristote- lianism aimed at a state trooper deter him from giving me a speeding ticket as he finds me behind the wheel of a 100 mph auto, albeit a 100 mph constant speed?" Some of the very recent physical literature features articles advocat- ing the abandonment of the Diracian electrodynamics (Herrera 1977) on the following avowed grounds: (a) The Eqs. (4) and (7) allegedly do sustain the retrocausal interpretation, but (b) retrocausation is held to be conceptually "unsatisfactory." In our (1976), (1977), and (1978) discussions, we maintained that there is no warrant for premiss (a) of this rationale for proposing to supplant the Diracian Eqs. (5) and (7) by rival equations of motion. And here we have argued that Nissim-Sabat's paper has offered nothing cogent to gainsay our critique of the retrocausal interpretation.
