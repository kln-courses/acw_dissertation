<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS OF BOOKS. Thze Origin and Development of the Moral Ideas. By EDWARD WESTERMARCK. In Two Volumes. Vol. II. Macmillan and Co., Limited, London, i908. -pp. xv, 852. The first volume of this work was reviewed in Volume XVI of this journal, pp. 70 if. In that review attention was devoted mainly to the ethical theory of the author. It might seem strange that such a work as this should be considered from the point of view of theory rather than as presenting the facts of the moral life among ' primitive,' archaic, and modern peoples. It is evident, however, that the author has not intended merely to collect facts. The passage from the pref- ace to the former volume, quoted in the previous review, makes this obvious and the concluding chapter of the present volume confirms this statement if confirmation is necessary: " We have completed our task. Only a few words will be added to emphasise the leading features of our theory of the moral consciousness and to point out some general conclusions which may be drawn as regards its evolution" (II, p. 738). ' The leading features' of this theory have been sum- marized in the former review, and it is unnecessary to repeat them here. What preeminently differentiates the theory from others is not so much its contents as the method in which the author has presented it. " Any attempt to discover the nature and origin of the moral consciousness must necessarily take into account the moral ideas of mankind at large. And though painfully conscious of the incom- pleteness of the present treatise, I think I may confidently ask, with reference to its fundamental thesis, whether any other theory of the moral consciousness has ever been subjected to an equally comprehen- sive test " (II, p. 742). Every candid reader who is acquainted with the literature of the subject can give only one answer to this question. There has never been any attempt to establish a moral theory on facts gathered from such a wide range of time and space as Westermarck's attempt; and the result is that the work deserves to rank among the world's greatest scientific books; in its own branch of science it has no peer, and is not likely to find one for a long time to come. But even if we had here merely a compilation of facts it would be invaluable. The indefatigable industry and the splendid competence of the author are written on every page. While the author himself 429</page><page sequence="2">430 7ZE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XVIII. would be the last man to claim that he has examined every nook and cranny of his subject, one is tempted to say that only the nooks and crannies remain unexplored; and of these surprisingly many have been brought to the light. It was not, however, the purpose of Westermarck to go into the minutiae of moral conduct. He restricts himself " to the more important modes of conduct with which the moral conscious- ness of mankind is concerned. These modes of conduct may be con- veniently divided into six groups. The first group includes such acts, forbearances, and omissions as directly concern the interests of other men, their life or bodily integrity, their freedom, honour, property, and so forth. The second includes such acts, forbearances, and omis- sions as chiefly concern a man's own welfare, such as suicide, temper- ance, asceticism. The third group, which partly coincides with, but partly differs from, both the first and the second, refers to the sexual relations of men. The fourth includes their conduct towards the lower animals; the fifth, their conduct towards dead persons; the sixth, their conduct towards beings, real or imaginary, that they regard as supernatural. We shall examine each of these groups separately, in the above order. And, not being content with a mere description of facts, we shall try to discover the principle which lies at the bottom of the moral judgment in each particular case " (I, p. 328). This is of course a most comprehensive task; but it might well be questioned whether it would not have been desirable to include a seventh group, dealing with men's conduct and moral judgments in respect of ideal and impersonal interests, of which art is a conspicuous example. One does not like to find fault with an author who has done so much, just be- cause he did not undertake to do more; but one can only express regret that he did not crown his task by an account of the facts and the principles involved in this by no means unimportant branch of morality. Westermarck is a writer to whom the reader is willing to increase his obligations. It will be manifestly impossible to set forth here the author's results even in any one of the divisions of his study. The first group receives naturally the largest attention; the latter half of the first volume and almost one third of the second are devoted to its consideration. From the point of view of theory the most important chapter in this section is the thirty-fourth, on " The Origin and Development of the Altru- istic Sentiment," Vol. II, pp. I86-2.28. Here he of course first treats of the maternal affection, and propounds a theory which might have been expected from the author of the view that the repugnance to incest is due to an instinct not based on blood relationship but on</page><page sequence="3">No. 4.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 43I social geography. Propinquity-during infancy and adolescence, while it blunts the sexual appetite, arouses altruistic affection. The love of offspring is not due to the physiological relationship between mother and child; nor is it due merely to the appeal of the weak and helpless, as such, to the feminine heart. " To account for the maternal senti- ment we must therefore assume the existence of some other stimulus besides the signs of helplessness, which produces, or at least strengthens, the instinctive motor response in the mother. This stimulus, so far as I can see, is rooted in the external relationship in which the offspring from the beginning stand to the mother. She is in close prox- imity to her helpless young from their tenderest age; and she loves them because they are to her a cause of pleasure " (II, p. i89). By the same token, where the father comes into contact with his child he evinces paternal affection. "The stimuli to which the paternal in- stinct responds are apparently derived from the same circumstances as those which call into activity the maternal instinct, that is, the helpless - ness and the nearness of the offspring. Wherever this instinct exists, the father is near his young from the beginning, living together with the mother " (II, p. I 90). The tie which binds parent and child, like that which binds father and mother, is "developed through natural selection " (II, p. i9i), but the " tendency to feel some attachment to a being which has been the cause of pleasure . . . is undoubtedly at the bottom of " both parental and conjugal affection (II, p. i 9I). In addition to parental, conjugal, filial, and fraternal attachment, Wes- termarck recognizes also the gregarious instinct in human beings; and this instinct has likewise developed under the influence of natural se- lection. But man was not originally gregarious; " the kind of food man subsisted upon, together with the large quantities of it which he wanted, formed in olden times a hindrance to a true gregarious man- ner of living, except perhaps in some unusually rich places " (II, p. i96). The development of tools and the discovery of the art of making fire removed this obstacle. " In short, man gradually found out new ways of earning his living and more and more emanci- pated himself from direct dependence on surrounding nature. The chief obstacle to a gregarious life was by this means surmounted, and the advantages of such a life were considerable " (II, p. i96). "When gregariousness became an advantage to man, he would feel inclined to remain with those with whom he was living even after the family had fulfilled its object, - the preservation of the helpless offspring. And he would be induced to do so not only from egoistic considerations, but by an instinct which, owing to its usefulness, would</page><page sequence="4">432 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REPYEW. [VOL. XVIII. gradually develop, practically within the limits of kinship, - the gre- garious instinct" (II, pp. I96-7). Thus clans and hordes arose. While this account is rather guarded, still it appears that Westermarck believes that instincts arise, as well as develop, because they are useful. But here the reviewer is not sure -that he understands the author aright. But whatever may be the origin of the instincts involved, there is no question that the author lays as much emphasis on local proximity as on actual kinship in determining the direction of altruism. " Kinship certainly gives rise to special rights and duties, but when unsupported by local proximity it loses much of its social force (II, p. 202). " Nay, even where kinship constitutes a tie between persons belonging to dif- ferent local groups, its social force is ultimately derived not merely from the idea of a common origin, but from near relatives' habit of living together. Men became gregarious by remaining in the circle where they were born; if, instead of keeping together with their kindred, they had preferred to isolate themselves or to unite with strangers, there would certainly be no blood-bond at all " (p. 203). In fact " the social force in kinship " is of " derivative origin "; this " accounts for its formal character, when personal intercourse is wanting; it may enjoin duties, but hardly inspires much affection. If in modern society much less importance is attached to kinship than at earlier stages of civilisation, this is largely due to the fact that rela- tives, except the nearest, have little communication with each other. And if, as Aristotle observes, friendship between kinsfolk varies according to the degree of relationship, it does so in the first instance on account of the varying intimacy of their mutual intercourse " (II, p. 204). It will thus appear to the reader, from the few quotations I have given, that Westermarck consistently lays great emphasis on closeness and constancy of social contact as giving direction to the altruistic instinct, as against the centrifugal action of early intimacy in matters of sexual instinct. The influence of a common religion in adding strength to a com- munity cannot be denied, "but it seems that its national importance has often been over-rated. . It sometimes seems as if the national spirit of a people rather influenced its religion than was influenced by it. Patriotism has even succeeded in nationalizing the greatest enemy of nationalities, Christianity, and has well nigh revived the old notion of a national god, whose chief business is to look after his own people and, especially, to fight its battles " (II, p. 226). But in spite of in- fluences making for exclusiveness, there is a gradually widening action of altruism. " People of different nationalities feel that in spite of all</page><page sequence="5">No. 4.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 433 dissimilarities between them there is much that they have in com- mon; and frequent intercourse makes the differences less marked, or obliterates many of them altogether. There can be no doubt that this process will go on in the future " (II, p. 228). Rarely does one find a writer on ethical subjects so free from pre- possessions as Westermarck is; but at least in one instance it seems to me that he evinces a strong prejudice which warps his judgment. When he declines to accept the views of Messrs. Spencer, Gillen, Fison and Howitt in regard to the existence of group-marriage among the Australians he seems to show a surprising predilection for theory over fact. It is quite true that we must distinguish " between state- ments based on direct observation and the observer's interpretation of the stated facts " (II, p. 396) ; but it seems here as if an aversion to the recognition of group-marriage had blinded the author to the signif- icance of the facts stated, especially as they exist among the Arunta tribe. It may be that group-marriage is a " residuary legatee of the old theory of promiscuity "; but it not seldom happens that false theories leave valid legacies; such theories may direct attention to facts that otherwise might have long remained unobserved; and when once the facts are observed, it is not necessary to throw them over just because the theory which led to their recognition has been dis- carded. It may be wrong " to view the early history of mankind through Australian spectacles " ; and of course " the most ardent ad- vocate of Australian group marriage should remember that the exist- ence of kangurus in Australia does not prove that there were once 'kangurus in England " (II, p. 396);'but the opponent of group- marriage should in his turn remember that the non-existence of kan- gurus in England does not disprove their existence in Australia. Of course they may not exist, but the final authority on the subject is the testimony of those who have seen them, and not of those who have an aversion to them. Westermarck surely does not deserve the appel- lation of " ethnologist of the study " ; but one cannot but think that if his studies had not made him familiar with the perversity of the theory of promiscuity which builds so much on group-marriage, he would have been more willing to recognize group-marriage as a fact. Westermarck's treatment of the sixth group of moral facts, those concerning religion, is most admirable. The subject is one in which foregone conclusions are rife; but here we have a calm and unbiased statement of facts and a most reasonable interpretation of them. That it will be acceptable to all readers is of course not to be expected; but that in time it will help to clear the atmosphere in</page><page sequence="6">434 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVIII. these parts is not too much to hope. Its strictures upon Christianity will of course arouse much antagonism, but what he says is something that Christians may very profitably take to heart, for criticism is some- thing that even religion cannot well dispense with in these days. Westermarck defines religion as " a belief in and a regardful atti- tude towards a supernatural being on whom man feels himself depend- ent and to whose will he makes appeal in his worship. Super- natural mechanical power, on the other hand, is applied in magic. He who performs a purely magical act utilises such power without making any appeal at all to the will of a supernatural being " (II, p. 584). The distinction between the natural and the supernatural is not always clear; but even the savage " certainly sees a difference between events of everyday occurrence or ordinary objects of nature and other events or objects which fill him with mysterious awe " (II, p. 582). " That mystery is the essential characteristic of supernatural beings is proved by innumerable facts " (II, p. 586), linguistic and ethnographical. "Man's belief in supernatural agents, then, is an attempt to explain strange and mysterious phenomena which suggest a volitional cause. The assumed cause is the will of a supernatural being" (II, p. 594). Anthropomorphism arises from the impossi- bility of imagining a will without a mind or a mind without a body, and from the tendency to attribute personality to the supernatural (II, pp. 594-7). This view of the origin of the belief in the supernatural includes the ghost-and-dream theory of the origin of religion, for ghosts and dreams are uncanny appearances which arouse awe and de- mand explanation; but it regards ghosts and dreams as only two in- stances of a large class of awe-inspiring phenomena which provoke the theory of the supernatural. Religion, probably from rezigare, has been commonly assumed to imply that man felt himself tied to his god. " But I venture to believe that the connection between them allows of another and more natural interpretation - that it was not the man who was tied by the god, but the god who was tied by the man " (II, p. 584). Here follow various references to actual prac- tices of literally tying supernatural beings and refusing to unbind them until they give their blessing. Genesis XXXII, 24-32, is om- mitted from consideration here. Westermarck makes out a strong case in a matter that is at best one of conjecture. Supernatural beings are not originally regarded as supporters of the moral order, or at least not generally so regarded. " As men are con- cerned about the conduct of their fellow men toward their gods, so gods are in many cases concerned about men's conduct towards one</page><page sequence="7">No. 4.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 435 another - disapproving of vice and punishing the wicked, approving of virtue and rewarding the good. But this is by no means a universal characteristic of gods. It is a quality attributed to certain deities only and, as it seems, in most instances slowly acquired " (II, p. 663). " I can find no solid foundation for the statements made by recent writers that 'the historical beginning of all morality is to be found in religion,' " etc. (II, p. 696). "We have seen that the gods of uncivilised races are to a very large extent of a malevolent charac- ter, that they as a rule take little interest in any kind of human con- duct which does not affect their own welfare, and that, if they show any signs of moral feelings, they may be guardians either of tribal customs in general or only of some special branch of morality. Among peoples of a higher culture, again, the gods are on the whole benevolent to mankind, when duly propitiated. They by preference resent offences committed against themselves personally, but they also avenge social wrongs of various kinds, they are superintendents of human justice, and are even represented as the originators and sus- tainers of the whole moral order of the world. The gods have thus experienced a gradual change for the better; until at last they are described as ideals of moral perfection, even though, when more closely scrutinised, their goodness and notions of justice are found to differ materially from what is deemed good and just in the case of men" (II, p. 728). "The belief in a god who acts as a guardian of worldly morality undoubtedly gives emphasis to its rules " (II, p. 734). " But on the other hand there are also certain circumstances which considerably detract from the influence of the religious sanction when compared with other sanctions of morality " (II, pp. 734-5). " The frequent assumption that the moral law would hardly command obedi- ence without the belief in retribution beyond the grave is contradicted by an overwhelming array of facts " ( II, p. 735). " Most religions contain an element which constitutes a real peril to the morality of their votaries. They have introduced a new kind of duties -duties towards gods; - and, as we have noticed above, even where religion has entered into close union with worldly morality, much greater importance has been attached to ceremonies or worship or niceties of belief than to good behaviour towards fellow men. . . . It should also be remembered that the religious sanction of moral rules only too often leads to an external observance of these rules from purely selfish motives. Christianity itself has, essentially, been regarded as a means of gain- ing a blessed hereafter. As for its influence upon the moral life of its adherents I agree with Professor Hobhouse that its chief strength lies</page><page sequence="8">436 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XVIII. not in its abstract doctrines but in the simple personal following of Christ. In moral education example plays a more important part than precept. But even in this respect Christianity has unfortunately little reason to boast of its achievements " (II, pp. 736-7). Westermarck's treatment of his sources in general inspires the ut- most confidence of the reader. But in one passage it appears that he has been misled by a trick of speech. I have not been able to verify my impression in this matter by referring to the originals quoted; but the quotations themselves suggest that there has been a misunderstand- ing of them. " Moreover, on discovering that we have been deceived, we have the humiliating feeling that another person has impertinently made our conduct subject to his will. This is a wound on our pride, a blot on our honour. Francis I. of France laid it down as a principle, ' that the lie was never to be put up with without satisfaction, but by a base-born fellow.' 'The lie,' says Sainte-Palaye, ' has always been considered the most fatal and irreparable affront that a man of hon- our could receive' " (II, p. iio). Does 'the lie ' here referred to mean the lie told to one or the lie imputed to one? Westermarck evidently thinks it means the former. Seventy-eight pages of bibliography, most carefully compiled, and twenty-eight pages of subject-index complete the work. I wish I could in this review take up more of the interesting points discussed by the author; but the book is too great a book to review with any satisfaction. I may close by saying that not its least claim to greatness is that the layman can read it with as much interest and profit as the expert finds in it. It should have a wide and enduring circulation. No one after this will have a right to discuss questions of ethical theory who has not made himself acquainted with its contents. Many of us will feel obliged to read it over and over again.
