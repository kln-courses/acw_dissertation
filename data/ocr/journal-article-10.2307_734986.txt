<plain_text><page sequence="1">Die Bulhnenwerke von Leosv Janadek. By Tibor Kneif, pp. 84. (Universal, Vienna &amp; London, 1975, ?4.50-) It is not clear what aims this monograph pursues. It is not the usual opera guide, and it assumes in the reader a knowledge of the plot of each of Janacek's nine stage works. Nor is it a study in depth dealing with the dramatic and musical features of each work in turn. And it is too pedes- trian in approach and too complex in style to pass as a collection of pense'es. One has the suspicion that its origin was in a thesis, now refur- bished for publication as a book. Tibor Kneif evidently has an intimate knowledge of the scores, but he has nothing new to say about the music, except that he shows more clearly than before Janacek's growth as a musical dramatist achieving his ripe maturity in the last ten years or so of hI s life. Whether his relationship with Kamilla Stoesslova could to some extent be made responsible for the extraordinary flourishing of his genius in his final decade, it is impossible to say. (Like Bruckner, Janacek was a late developer.) Inevitably, Kneif has to rehearse the characteristics of JanAcek's style-the influence of Moravian folksongs, his speech-melody (modelled on Mussorgsky's example), the constant (varied and unvaried) repetition of an identical motive, the predilection for small metric units, his peculiar orchestration, which favours treble and bass at the expense of the middle texture kept deliberately thin and often hardly audible, and so on. Some of these points are illustrated by, on the whole, well chosen music examples. There is more interest to be found in Kneif's comparisons of the original literary sources with the libretti drawn from them, and there is the suggestion that the composer's alterations in the story usually served to improve its dramatic character. Due emphasis is laid on the important part Max Brod played in JanAcek's career as his literary adviser and German translator. For instance, in the composer's anthropomorphic animal opera, The Cunning Little Vixen, Brod made more of the implied parallel between the Vixen and the gypsy girl 170</page><page sequence="2">Ternyka than was the case in the Czech version. And Brod's title Jenufa is from the point of view of an international public certainly preferable to the Czech Jeji Pastorkyna-'Her Foster-Daughter', though it suppresses the fact that the Kostelnitza plays almost as important a role as Jenufa, which is hinted at in Janaekc's original title. We are also made aware of a certain insensitivity on JanAcek's part to the dramatic and literary qualities of the text (as, for instance, in Mr. Brouc'ek) and of some defi- ciency in the musical setting. Perhaps the most arresting chapter is the introductory one on Janacek's creative methods. Like Mussorgsky, Janacek was essentially a dilettante who in each new work had technically to start from scratch, as it were. Though he had had a proper training as an organist in Prague and studied theory and composition first in Brno, then Leipzig and (for a short while) in Vienna, he seemed to evince little interest in systematic, methodical studies. In his early years he scarcely realised the importance of sound craftsmanship as the intermediary between the idea and its adequate representation on paper. It would appear that this neglect was largely deliberate and dictated by his urge to avoid conventions and strike out into the unknown. That this contributed appreciably to Jan6cek's robust originality (as it did in Mussorgsky) is certain. Yet practically all his life Janacek was pursued by self-doubt and felt himself to be a provincial, parochial Moravian composer, if compared with the elegant, mundane and polished Prague school of Bohemian musicians. Janacek's dilettantism showed in a number of other things. Thus he would allow, without any sign of protest, various conductors to 'improve' his scores, the best-known case being the alterations made by Karel Kovairovic in Jenufa. Furthermore, as often as not he would compose straight into full score, so that when he later felt that new ideas had to be added and developments of a motive changed, the full score had to be rewritten-an incredible waste of time and energy. Interesting from a psychological point of view is the fact that in order to work himself into a creative mood, Jana.Rek would hammer away at the piano, for hours on end, at one and the same idea which indeed became the leading one in a given section. Kneif interprets this as a dramatic means whereby he wanted to suggest the intense self-centredness of the majority of his operatic characters. In his theories too Janacek would venture out on very thin ice. For instance, in his 'Complete Harmony' (i 9i2; I920) he argued that all conceivable progressions, even those between wholly unrelated chords, were justified, and cited as his support Helmholtz's discovery that a chord reverberates into the next by a tenth of its original volume, a phenomenon which, according to Janacek, created a harmonic 'chaos' to be imitated in practice. Janawcek also resorted to abstruse descriptions of established musical facts; when a pupil once asked him about the kind of sound created by a given chord, the composer's reply was 'like the rustle of fire'. Poetic, true, but not of much use to a pupil. There is a useful calendar of Janacek's life and works, a select biblio- graphy of Czech and German literature, but no index.
