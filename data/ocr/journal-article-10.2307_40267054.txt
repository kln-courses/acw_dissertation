<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tiivuaxco and its cognates: a note on Simonides, fr. 508 Page By Michael Clarke, Maynooth Abstract: Simonides (fr. 508 Page) sings of a windless season, "when Zeus mvoaxTii twenty-four days". The rare verb mvoooco / mvooxco refers to giving advice or imparting wisdom, but this does not fit the present context. I argue that mvooxco is closely related to Tiveco, and that both verbs answer to a subtle semantic unity rooted in the belief that breathing is part of the process of thought. Con- sequently the verb antvoooco (also very rare) refers indeterminately to the loss of consciousness or of breath. By changing the word-division I read àmvuaxr|i, so that Zeus "loses his breath for twenty-four days". The proposal is then defended in both religious and lexical terms. I believe1 there is an interesting corruption in the text of this isolated fragment of a victory ode, which survives as a quotation in Aristotle's discussion of the nesting habits of the fabulous birds called halcyons (HA v8.542b4). Here is the text in D.L. Page's edition2: . . . cbç cmôtav Xei|i8Qiov xatà uf|va mvuaxrii Zeèç Tijxata xèooeqa xai ôéxa, Xa6àv£|iov ôé jiiv coqccv xaAiooaw èmxBôvioi ieQccv natôotQÔcpov tioixOuxç àXxoôvoç . . . The simile (as it seems to be) refers to the tradition that the halcyons were able to build their nests on the water because of a period of preternatural calm around the time of the solstice3. This is the XaGdvenoç; cûqoc, the season when there is no wind. The problem is the word mv6axr|i. A glance at the other attestations of this verb mvuoxco / mvuaaco will show that it does not fit here. 1 I am grateful to D.M.

The meaning must be that the order instructed or persuaded him to put Zeus to sleep - although this instance is doubtful because the tradition also attests èrtévocaev from èm-vuaaco, with the meaning that the plan "goaded me on"4. Otherwise, the first clear example is in Aeschylus' Persians, where the Chorus are ordered by Darius' ghost to urge Xerxes to wisdom, nivooxet eûXôyoioi vooOetfuiaatv (830); and later Calli- machus in his Hymn to Artemis recalls to the goddess how Heracles exhorted her to hunt large beasts rather than small ones, xeçôccXéon |i60coi ae mvuaxei (152). Twice in later literature the verb is used with reference to the imparting of deep spiritual ideas. In what seems to be a quotation from the Hieros Logos of Pythagoras, the sage is described as passing on wisdom that was imparted to Orpheus by his mother, naçà KaAÀiôjrnç; tfjç |it|tqôç èmvûa9r|5; and similarly an Orphie fragment describes Athene as the most skilled of the gods in teaching the arts of spinning, raXaaf|ïà % eçya mvûaaeiv6. We can now frame a rough definition: when I ntvoooco a person I advise them or make them wise or otherwise impart thought. This fits all the attestations that we have surveyed - including the example in the Iliad, if it is to be assigned to this verb. The reference to thought or wisdom is further corroborated by mvoaoco's close relatives: the adjective mvotôç, the noun 7iivotf| and the very rare verb ànivûaoco. To be mvuTÔç is to be wise by character (e.g., Od. 1.299, 4.211, 11.445, 20.131, 21.103, 23.361; Theognis 501)7, closely similar to being adxpQcov8. nivutf) is wisdom, the quality of concentrated thought (e. g., //. 7.289; Od. 20.71, 20.228)9, and ctmvoaaco refers to its absence: ôoxéeiç ôé not oox àmvûoaeiv (Od. 5.342, 6.258), "you seem to me 4 ém-voaacû is defended by R.

Turning back to Simonides, how could the observable meaning of mvoaaco express what Zeus does to bring about the À,a0àveu,oç coqcx? The answer hitherto offered has been that Zeus calms or assuages the weather: for example D.A. Campbell translates "Zeus admonishes fourteen days"11. But this is clearly unsatisfactory. The only way in which he could "admonish" the days woud be if Day were personified as the deity fHn,£QT) who is listed by Hesiod as one of the children of Night (Theogony 124). In our fragment that will not work, because the idea is of a series of particular days rather than a celestial divinity with a universal identity. Bergk12 defends mv6axT|i against various unsatisfactory emendations13 by claiming that its use here is "elegan- tia", but he does not explain what the elegance is or how it enables the word to convey a meaning. With greater frankness Page notes in his apparatus that it can only be justified as as "an almost incredible abuse of the word"14, and as far as I know no better explanation has been proposed. I suggest that the solution lies a little further afield, in the connexion between the mvoaaco group and the family of Jived), to breathe. In early Greek the action of inhaling, filling the lungs with air, is closely identified with mental activity, so that the key verb for wise thinking is TteTtvojiai, the perfect form of Ttveco15. Just as warriors filled with 10 Hesychius also lists mvupivny, mvooiç, but these are not attested di- rectly; and the adjective mvi)TÔ(pQoov and the abstract noun mvoTÔrrjÇ also survive, but only in Hellenistic and later sources, mvotôç, nivorr) and mvuTCKpQcov are surprisingly common in the Greek Anthology, and had evi- dently become learned archaisms: this is also implied by Plutarch, Moralia 797E. 11 In Greek Lyric 3 (Loeb Library, 1991). 12 Ad loc. in Poetae lyrici Graeci, ed. 4 (Leipzig 1882), vol. 3. 13 Bergk records tit6g&gt;xt|i, emjiUGTit, tavooaTji. 14 "Vocis abusione paene incredibili interpretantur", ad loc. in Poetae melia Graeci (Oxford 1962). 15 Philologists are not always willing to accept that Ttenvoum is related directly to nvéco [see esp. P. Chan traîne, Dictionnaire étymologique de la langue grecque (Paris 1960-80) and H. Frisk, Griechisches etymologisches Wôrterbuch (Heidelberg 1960-70) s.v.]. Their doubts seem to be grounded in nothing better than modern common sense (see esp. Chantraine ad fin.) and I see no reason to resist the conclusion that néTCVoum reflects Ttveoo in the same way that (for example) xé^oum reflects %É(ù [see E. Risch, Wortbildung der Homer- ischen Sprache (ed. 2, Berlin 1974), § 120a]. For defences of the connection of Ttvéco with 7i67ivi)(j,ai, and of both with the mvutôç group, see C.J.

Whether or not the (pQéveç are precisely identified with the lungs, they are definitely the major organ that lies behind the ribs16, and the activity of thinking, (pQOvéco, is intimately bound up with breathing17. Once this pattern is recognised it is easy to see how 7t67ivv)|iai stands in relation to Ttvéco: the (fossilised?) perfect form refers specifically to thinking as a result of inhaling, while the other forms of Ttveco refer to the physical act of gulping in air; and this narrowing of the semantic range in the perfect leads to the specially precise associations of the participle rteTtvojievoc;, as in familiar Homeric formulae like tôv 8' au TnA,é|iaxoç nenvv\ievoç àvtiov fjôôa (Od. 1.213, etc.). In turn it makes good semantic sense that this family should be related to the ntvoooco group: for example mvi)tf| is wisdom that enters the mental apparatus, (pQevaç . . . ïxEi (Od. 20.228), so that by the same token it is breath drawn into the breast18. Despite the unusual phonological development of the i in mv -, the etymological link is clear and accords very well with what we can observe of early Greek psychology19.

The link between the two groups is neatly exhibited in Cypriot proper names like nvutayôçaç and rivuTÔti|i,oç (cited by Ruijgh, loccit.), which bridge the gap between the stem of nveca and that of nivuxôç. The problem remains that simple anaptyxis is uncharacteristic of Greek and cannot be offered as a stopgap explanation of the i in -mvu-. However, T. Meissner has suggested to me that there is</page><page sequence="5">mvôaxco and its cognates 139 This is not the place for an exhaustive discussion of the unity between thought and breath in early Greek ideas, but I hope the reader will accept its general outline20. With this in mind we turn to the one Iliadic attestation of the negative verb ctmvooaco. Hector has been struck down in battle, and Zeus looks down on him as he lies gasping and vomiting blood: "Extoqcc ô' èv neôicoi ïôe xeiusvov, ôcuxpi S èxaÎQOi Tiaff, ô 8' àQyaXécûi e%e% ao9|iaTi kt\q àmvôoacov . . . (//. 15. 9-10) What does ht\q àmvûaacov mean here? On the strength of the instances that we have noted from the Odyssey, where amvooaco means to lack wisdom or to be foolish, at a pinch one might translate it as "unconscious" or "dazed", but that would miss the full meaning required by the context21. Let us trace Hector's experience. (To under- stand it fully it is necessary to recall. T. Jahn's important finding that in Homeric practice 9i)|iôç, v\xoq and ht\q act as alternative names for a single apparatus in the chest22.) Aias flung a huge boulder at Hector, it struck him on the breast and knocked him to the ground (//. 14.409-21). His comrades carried him away from the field groaning and gasping heavily, paçéot ctevàxovra (//. 14.432); they poured water on him, he regained his breath and looked around him, à^invovOî] xai àvéôQaxEV ô(p9aX|ioîatv (//. 14.436); then he collapsed again and swooned because the blow was still overcoming his consciousness, fiekoç ô' 8ti 9i)jiôv èôàuvct (//. 14.438-9). Later he recalls this by saying that he had breathed out this consciousness, (piA,ov d'tov tjtoq (//. a parallel in an alternation seen in forms in -vt|- that are attested for certain verbs, as xiqvt||j,i for xeQavvD^ii, rtiwnni for Ttetàvvi)p,i, axiôvnni for axeôàvvunt. Here the nasal infix should imply that the attested form comes from the zero-grade of the root: but there is no straightforward explanation of the form with i either as a development of that zero-grade or as an extension by levelling from the aorist form, which is normal e-grade in each case (see A.L. Sihler, New comparative grammar of Greek and Latin [Oxford 1995], § 473b). What we see, then, is the unexpected appearance of an i between the two consonants of a verb stem derived from a zero-grade, just as with our forms in -mvo-. The similarity is especially close in xtQvmu, with its sequence of stop + resonant. 20 The matter is fully discussed in my Flesh and spirit in the songs of Homer Oxford, 1999, ch. 4. 21 Janko ad loc. translates "insensible", which glosses over the problem by seizing on an English word that happens coincidentally to fit in two quite different senses both here and at Od 5.342, 6.258. 22 T. Jahn, Zum Wortfeld "Seele-Geist" in der Sprache Homers (= Zetemata 83, Munich 1987).</page><page sequence="6">140 Michael Clarke 15.252)23. This is the state he is in when he is ht\q àmvûaacov: he is groaning and gasping, by losing his breath he has lost consciousness, and the one experience implies the other. This is further confirmed when Zeus says that he is going to send Apollo to help Hector back to battle: he will again breathe battle-fury into him, amiç S è\inve\)o- T|iai jiévoç, so that he will forget the pains that trouble him in the organs of his breast, aï jxw teiQouai xatà cpQevaç (//. 15.60-61). Indeed when Apollo finds him he is gathering new consciousness, véov S eoayeiQeto Gouov (//. 15.240), in other words breathing normally. What this implies is that amvoaaco can be given a simple physiological meaning as well as a psychological one: when I ànivuaoa) I am unable to inhale, I lose my breath. I do not know whether this ambiguity between thinking and inhal- ing is active in fifth-century belief as it is in Homer. Nonetheless we can be confident that within the poetic tradition Simonides will have been versed in the full range of nuances of meaning encapsulated in Homeric words. Returning to our fragment, I propose that the word- division should be changed: . . . cbç ônôx ccv X8i|i8Qiov xatà ufiv' amvoaxrii Zeùç Tijiata téaaeQa xai 8exa . . . To justify meddling with the transmitted text in this way we need propose only that the semantic subleties of mvuaaco and ccmvoaaco had been forgotten by the time the word-divisions and punctuation marks were fixed in the text of Aristotle. If the emendation is right, Simonides' meaning is that Zeus "loses his breath", he ceases to blow the winds from the heavens for fourteen days. It is familiar that Zeus is not only a personal god but also the clear sky itself, and that as such he is the source of wind as well as other atmospheric phenom- ena24, but it is less obvious that the wind should be identified as his breath. This idea is comparatively rare in Greek literature, but it is securely attested. There is an interesting example in a lyric passage of the Iphigeneia at Aulis, where Iphigeneia wishes that Zeus had not blown contrary winds upon the Euripus: 23 aico is cognate with cct|hi and refers specifically to breathing: see Janko ad loc, and Chan traîne Dictionnaire s.v. 24 The fullest survey of Zeus in this aspect is still A.B. Cook, Zeus (Cam- bridge, 1914-40) 3.i 103-65.</page><page sequence="7">tuvooxcù and its cognates 141 . . . |xr|ô' àvraiocv EÙQincoi nveôaai 7io|X7iàv Zeuç, eiXiaacov aûçav âXkoiç âKkav Gvatcôv . . .

Although in many contexts a god might be said more vaguely to "breathe" on mortals in an abstract or spiritual sense, Zeus' physical identity implies that here he is literally and physically blowing wind from the sky, just as from Homer onwards he is the source and origin of thunder, lightning, storm, rain, dew and rainbows. The image of Zeùç nveï - or its opposite - is no more extravagant than Zeùç Cet (e. g., //. 12.25, Od 14.457), or Zeùç xtimeï (//. 7.479, 17.595, etc.), or Zeùç \a\kana teivei (//. 16.365), to name only a few of his celestial acts from Homeric examples. The comparative rarity of this attribu- tion of the wind to Zeus' breath is perhaps to be explained by the fact that it is never directly stated within the Homeric corpus, where he is said more vaguely to "rouse up" or "thrust forward" the wind, coQoev or I'aAAev25, but the blowing itself tends to be assigned to specific named winds26. The lack of Homeric authority might have discouraged the use of the image in later poetry. Nonetheless Zeus' role as sender of wind, with the cult-titles Oi)Qioç27and Eùàvejioç;28, is well enough attested to assure me that the image proposed for Simonides would have been quite possible in the heightened style of a choral ode. The vivid anthropomorphism gives the image an archaic grandeur - rather like the ancient belief parodied by Aristophanes in the Clouds, where Strepsiades' simple traditionalism has led him to assume than when "Zeus rains" he urinates through a sieve29. If the 25 See esp. Od. 12.313, 15.475, comparing the briefer allusion in Aiôç oùqoç (Od. 5.176, 15.297, h A p 427).

IL 2.145-6, Od. 9.67, 14.456-7, h A p 453. 27 Zeus is first addressed as oÙQie in Aeschylus' Supplices (594). Although this is not attested as a formal cult-title until much later (see Radke in PW IX A.1 [1961] 1024-8) it is striking that already in Homer the wind sent by Zeus is almost always called oùpoç (refs. in n. 25 above). 28 See Pausanias 3.13.8, and O. lessen in PWVLA (1907) 843. 29 Clouds 367-72.</page><page sequence="8">142 Michael Clarke emendation is right, the line not only improves our understanding of the mvoaaco family but also serves as a reminder that in the Archaic world-view divinity lurks behind the visible forms of nature in ways that nowadays can seem startling.</page></plain_text>
