At this his childhood in the région around Tepoztlan and Xochicalco, point I am referring to a feathered serpent (quetzalli-coatl), where he learned the religion of the Feathered Serpent. Later that was the link or mediator between the sky and the earth, he became a priest devoted to this deity and eventually adopted the living rain cloud that provided fertility (Soustelle 1994: the name of the god Quetzalcoatl. As an important ruler in the 159-160). With the passage of time, the feathered serpent was history of Tula (Tollan Xicocotitlan), he passed into legend personified and took human form as the god Quetzalcoatl. He identified with the image of the god (Sahagún 1975:195-196). was also known as Ehecatl (Wind) in his role as the precursor This merging makes it difificult to separate Quetzalcoatl from or announcer of the rain (Sahagún 1975:32; Motolinia 1971: the historical figure ofTopiltzin.2 13). Quetzalcoatl was also a dual deity representing the planet Düring the Epiclassic (650-900 ad) following the fall of Venus in its manifestations as morning and evening star. This Teotihuacan, Xochicalco flourished as a cosmopolitan city, is indicated according to Chavero (cited in Robelo 1951:239) probably inhabitated by Olmecas-Xicalancas, who also lived in the etymology of the word: quetzalli meaning "precious" in Cacaxtla and Cholula. Xochicalco was also influenced and coatl meaning "twin." The worship of Quetzalcoatl by other cultures, perhaps as a resuit of intense trade (Hirth diffüsed throughout Mesoamerica and was called by many 2000, Volume 1:194-209, 244-269).

Stylistic elementsfrom ElTajin, Tula and the Zapotees are also evident in the architecture (Sáenz 1962a: 41, 73-81; Hirth 2000, Volume 1:264-269). As I will show, based on the arguments of César Sáenz (1962b) and Román Piña Chan (1977:30), Xochicalco is precisely the place where the anthropomorphic version of the god Quetzalcoatl was born. I believe that the concept of Quetzalcoatl synthesizes a plurality of agrarian deities. Piña Chan (1977, 1989) identifies Xochicalco as the his torical Tamoanchan (Place of Création and Origin) and also as the place of the birth of the worship of Quetzalcoatl. López Austin (1994:80-83) criticizes Piña Chan's arguments saying that he accepted the mythical accounts narrated by Sahagún (1975:Ch.lO) as true. In addition, López Austin (ibid) finds several inconsistencies and contradictions in Piña Chan's arguments. While I tend to agree that Piña Chan's arguments are not sufficient to determine that Xochicalco is the historical Tamoanchan, I suspect that Piña Chan is right in his identifi cation of Quetzalcoatl as the figure that appears on the stelae of Xochicalco. The Stelae of Xochicalco Pasztory (1976:185-215) interprets the iconography of the three stelae as a theme of death and rebirth of the sun and corn in the annual agricultural cycle with the intervention of Tlaloc and a goddess of fertility. More recently, Virginia Smith (2000:83-101 ) proposes that the three stelae commemorate HHi specific political events related to kingship and warfare. She argues that the main figures in these stelae depict historical Fig. 2 Stela 3 found in Building A of Xochicalco. rulers with their calendrical names, while the carvings on the sides and back of the monuments portray events in their indi vidual lives.

Quetzalcoatl is often referred to This is a typical ornament of the god Quetzalcoatl both as as Nácxitl meaning "Four Feet" (Codex Vaticanus B: pl. 64; Ehecatl (Wind god) and as the planet Venus in its aspect as Codex Telleriano Remensis: pl. 19-20; Codex Borbonicus: morning star (Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli). At the top of the stela, 16; Codex Vindobonensis:49; Nicholson 2001:284; Brundage is the glyph 7 Reptile Eye that Caso (1967:164-165, AB CD 168-169) equates with the day 7 Ehecatl in the Aztec calendar. The Anales de Cuauhtitlan (1945:5) State that, "They said that their god created them out of 12 03^3) O.OO.Q fTTPi tai 11 ashes; and they attributed to Quetzalcoatl, sign of 7 Ehecatl (wind), the fact of having created them."3 The sign 7 Ehecatl, probably the date of his birth or création, appears to be identifying the figure on Stela 1 as Quetzalcoatl. In summary, the front of Stela 1 shows the appari tion of Quetzalcoatl as Venus the morning star (Tla huizcalpantecuhtli) emerging from the earth to begin the Venusian cycle in the east. It is important to keep in mind that Quetzalcoatl, the "feathered-serpent," is Venus and, therefore, has as we will see in a moment, a dual character (Piña Chan 1977:32). On the right side (Figure 4, side B), a series of calendrical and non-calendrical glyphs begin with a year bündle sign (like an initial series glyph), fol lowed by the days 6 Ollin and 9 Calli. Next is a Kan Cross glyph, a symbol of the Tlaloc/Venus warrior cult related to water, blood, and Venus events associ ated with warfare and bloodletting (Smith 2000:88). I consider the "Kan Cross" sign a written character and not a calendrical date because the four dots are inside the cartouche (Caso 1962:75; Smith 2000:88). The sequence ends with the dates 5 Acatl and 13 Tochtli.

The left side (Figure 4, side D) begins with the glyph 7 Stela 3 Tochtli accompanied by two feet that descend to a house that contains a personage resting on a mat.

At the same god descends to disappear in the Underworld, to emerge after time, according to Sahagún (1975:433) Quetzalcoatl was the a period of time as morning star again. It is interesting to note first god to see the sun rising in the east. Thus, Quetzalcoatl that the event narrated on this side, proceeds from 7 Tochtli (Venus) preceded, as Morning Star, the appearance of the sun to 7 Tochtli, a period of 260 days, that is also the duration and maintained a close affiliation with it. of the cycle of Venus as evening star.

The main reason to the concept of Tollan and denotes Xochicalco as a succes they counted the days of this star and gave it reverence and sor to the power and religious prestige of Teotihuacan. The sacrifices, was because these deceived people thought that Acatl is a reed that differs from the Tolli that is normally as oné of their main gods Quetzalcohuatl, when he died and left sociated with Tollan (Place of Reeds), but both grow together. this world became that shining star."4 A B C D In short, Stela 1 of Xochicalco narrâtes in a some what poetic way the venusian cycle: Quetzalcoatl's apparition as a morning star in the east (Tlahuizcal pantecuhtli, Lord of the Dawn), emerging from the Underworld; his journey across the sky for a period of time, and his conversion into the evening star (Xólotl, precious twin), who, after a time, would disappear in the west to Start again the cycle in the east (Sáenz 1962b: 47,50). This 584 day venusian cycle calculated by many Mesoamerican peoples was the inspiration for the création of Quetzalcoatl as a dual deity. As Motolinia noted in Central Mexico, the alternating periods of appearance of the planet as morning or evening star were 260 days, very close to the modem calculations of 263 days. Interestingly, the venusian cycle calcu lated by Maya astronomers in the Dresden Codex differs significantly from the other Mesoamerican calculations, probably for ritual purposes. The Maya calculated the cycle as: 236 days as moming star, 90 days of invisibility, 250 days as evening star fol lowed by 8 days of invisibility (Aveni 1980:85-86). In any case, the duality and transformations of the celestial body were represented by the images of Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli and Xólotl, avatars or expan sions of Nácxitl Quetzalcoatl.

Quetzalcoatl, transformed into one of his forms (Xolotl), enters to discover and conquer the maize, a meta phor of warfare. Stela 2 The interprétation of Stela 2 [Fig. 7] is more complex but I believe it is still related to Quetzalcoatl and his functions. On the front, [Fig. 7, side A] the glyph 7 Quiahuitl (rain or water) alludes to the god Tlaloc. Similar glyphic représentations are found on the west side of the palace of Tepantitla in Teotihua can and in Mixtee códices like the Nuttall, Colombino and Bodley (Sáenz 1962b:51,53). Below this, the image of Tlaloc wears a headdress with the "year sign" and plug ear fiares. He has the characteristic "goggle eyes" and a water lily sprouts from his fanged mouth. He is represented in the same way in the agricultural murais of Teotihuacan, in the Borgia Codex and in the second body of the northern side of the pyramid of the Feathered Serpent at Xochicalco (Sáenz 1962b:53). In the bottom register is a knotted band that holds a pectoral with typical Tlaloc features: the curled "moustache," the mouth with protruding five fangs and a bifid tongue. Here, Tlaloc is being impersonated by Quetzalcoatl who appears as Ehecatl (Wind), announcer and propitiator of rain (Sahagún 1975: 32). In this way Quetzalcoatl appropriâtes the agricultural attributes of Tlaloc like rain, the yearly cycle, the planting of maize, végétation, water, the calendar and other bénéficiai aspects for human beings (Pifia Chan 1977: 34). At the same time, this connection between Tlaloc and Quetzalcoatl réit érâtes the Tlaloc/Venus warrior cult so prévalent during the Fig. 6 Image of a handful of reeds that shows that Xochicalco is a Epiclassic period (Carlson 1991). Tollan (Photo: Manuel Aguilar). On the right side [Fig. 7, side B], the glyphs 7 Quiahuitl (rain) and 13 Acatl (reed) are followed by two descending feet, It should be remembered that Alvarado Tezozomoc (1980) a half figure with chalchihuitl on its ankles entering the earth, refers to Tollan either as a Toltzallan (tular) or Acatzallan and the glyph 7 Calli (house). As noted in the analysis of stela (cañaveral). In this sense, he appears to be using the words 1, the descending figure is an alternative représentation for as synonyms for Lugar de los Tules (Place of Reeds). Thus, Xólotl (Dresden Codex 1988:??). This sequence suggests an the link of Acatl with Tollan is possible. The identification association between the "precious twin" evening star and the of Xochicalco as a Tollan is reinforced by the depiction of a rain penetrating the earth as portrayed by Tlaloc on the front, handful of reeds in a relief on the Pyramid of the Feathered At the bottom of the back of the stela [Fig. 7, side C], is Serpent [Fig. 6] at the site.

In other words, the god is not only Venus, but synthesizes the functions and attributes of other agrarian deities that existed at the end of Teotihuacan's reign (Pina Chan 1977:35). This situation created a new, almost monotheistic re ligious conception, reminiscent of the introduction of the worship to Aton (sun) by the pharaoh Akhenaton in ancient Egypt. Xochicalco and Quetzalcoatl In conclusion I have argued that Xochicalco created the concept of the anthropomorphic god, Quetzal coatl. His depiction in architecture and sculpture used a kind of "interregional" system of glyph-like symbols synthesized from cultures like the Maya, Teotihuacan, Totonac, Zapotec, Toltec-Chichimec and Mixtec [Fig. 8]. Quetzalcoatl, as a dual deity re lated to the venusian cycle, was conceived as Nacxitl (four feet) that split into the Lord of the Dawn or morning star (Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli) and Precious Twin or evening star (Xolotl). He also participated in the creation of the Fifth Sun and humankind. He was associated with all those elements that benefited hu Fig. 7 Stela 2 (Drawing from Hirth 2000, Volume 2:24). mans: the invention of the calendar and agriculture, the arts, the intellectual and scientific knowledge. He as one of the animals that were looking for maize in Totonac synthesized the diverse attributes of several agrarian gods, creation myths (Gonzalez Torres 1991:111). This idea is becoming almost a paramount deity, consistent with the conceptual, architectural and sculptural His priests took the regalia and name of the god as they influence from El Tajin noted in Xochicalco (Saenz 1962a:41, propagated his cult in many regions of Mesoamerica.

In any case, this particular sequence, like the whole of Stela 2, symbol izes sacrifice as a means of ensuring the continuity of life, rebirth and fertility.

This account of the origin of Quetzalcoatl is supported by the local Folklore of the Tepoztlan area. Michatlauhco is a place of exubérant and magic beauty. Near the water spring where the myth says that the god was born, I found petroglyphs that represent the images of Tlaloc and Quetzalcoatl. I recommend strongly to visit this place, that requires a drive of 15 minutes from Tepoztlan to Amatlan and from there, a trip on foot of around 1.5 hours to reach the sacred spring. 2. For more detail on the philosophical implications and the history of the concept of Quetzalcoatl, I recommend: Hombre-Dios by Alfredo López Austin (1973), The Myth of Quetzalcoatl by Enrique Florescano (1995), and Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl: The Once and Future Lord of the Toltecs by Henry B.

La causa y razón por la que contaban los días por esta estrella y le hacían reverencia y sacrificio, era porque estos naturales engañados pensaban e creían que uno de los principales de sus dioses, llamado Topiltzin, y por otro nombre Quetzalcohuatl, cuando murió y de este mundo partió se tomó en aquella resplandeciente estrella."

RESUMEN: El propósito de este artículo es dar una interpretación iconográ fica de las tres estelas encontradas en la Estructura A de Xochicalco en 1962, y mostrar que la figura que aparece en ellas es el dios Quetzalcoatl. Al mismo tiempo señalar que en Xochicalco es donde se inició el culto a la version antropomorfa del dios "Sepiente Emplumada" que después se extenderá en los mundos Tolteca y Azteca. Como base de mi argumento utilizo las hipótesis emitidas por Román Piña Chan en sus libros de 1977 y 1989, re interpretadas junto con mis propias conclusiones. Al desenterrar y discutir viejas pero provocadoras ideas, estoy pretendiendo motivar una reflexión que lleve a nuevas propuestas. 138 mexicon • Vol. XXIV • Dezember 2002</page><page sequence="8">ZUSAMMENFASSUNG: Der vorliegende Beitrag untersucht die Ikono graphie der drei, 1962 vor Struktur Avon Xochicalco gefundenen Stelen. Der Verfasser versucht nachzuweisen, dass es sich dabei um Darstellungen des Gottes Quetzalcoatl handeln könne. Gleichzeitig argumentiert der Verfasser dass es Xochicalco gewesen sei, wo die Verehrung einer anthropomorphen Version des Gottes "Federschlange" seinen Anfang nahm. Von da aus habe sich der Kult bis in die toltekische und aztekische Welt verbreitet. Der Beitrag knüpft bei Beobachtungen von Pifla Chan aus den Jahren 1977 und 1989 an und verbindet sie mit neuen ikonographischen Lesungen der Stelen und ihrer Hieroglyphen.</page></plain_text>
