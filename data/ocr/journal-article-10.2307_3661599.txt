<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DUAL PURPOSE OF ANIMAL FARM BY PAUL KIRSCHNER After nearly sixty years debate continues over the ultimate political meaning of Animal Farm, owing partly to its use as propaganda, but also to Orwell's original purpose, which was artistic as well as political. This article concentrates on the former purpose. It shows how fictional rhetorical strategies inevitably led to a pessimistic conclusion contradicting Orwell's own political actions and opinions during the period 1936-46, and attributes that contradiction to the effect of Orwell's chosen literary genre, combining elements of the fable and the fairy tale. The subtitle, 'A Fairy Story', indicates a neglected aspect of Animal Farm-literary parody of the 'proletarian' fairy tale that thrived in the 1920s and 1930s in Germany, the United States, and, tepidly, in England. A rare example of such a tale from the 1930s is quoted in full as an archetype of the politicized children's stories Orwell may have been parodying: it displays striking rhetorical and structural parallels with Animal Farm. The appealing form of such stories, adopted by Orwell, interfered with the full and accurate expression of his political thought. Animal Farm owes both its power and its ambiguity to the force and autonomy of literature itself, today menaced more than ever by the 'gramophone mind' Orwell detested. Whoever feels the value of literature, whoever sees the central part it plays in the development of human history, must also see the life and death necessity of resisting totalitarianism, whether it is imposed on us from without or from within. There is some hope . . . that the liberal habit of mind, which thinks of truth as something outside yourself, something to be discovered, and not something that you can make up as you go along, will survive. (The Collected Essays, Journalism and Letters of George Orwell) When, a couple of years ago, Animal Farm was put on stage in China, the long uncertainty about its ultimate meaning should have been dispelled. It dated back to 1945, when William Empson warned Orwell that, since allegory 'inherently means more than the author means', his book might mean 'very different things to different readers'.1 Sure enough, English communists attacked Animal Farm as anti-Soviet, while a conservative chided Orwell for forgetting that private property is a prerequisite of personal freedom.2 Western propagandists hijacked the book after Orwell's death, but twenty years later George Woodcock found it showed the identity of governing-class interests everywhere, and by 1980 Bernard Crick had to caution against reading it as a 1 Letter to G. Orwell, 24 Aug. 1945 (Orwell Archive). Quoted in B. Crick, George Orwell: A Life (London, 1982), 491-2. Empson's young son called Animal Farm 'very strong Tory propaganda'. 2 Ibid. 489.

To show why, I shall explore Orwell's claim to have tried deliberately in Animal Farm 'to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole' (i. 29).s My purpose will be equally dual: first, to infer Orwell's purpose from his political views; secondly, to explain the built-in artistic contradictions that made Animal Farm fine meat for propagandists, and suggest how they may be, if not resolved, at least transcended. In fusing my own purposes, I shall not hesitate to evoke a social and intellectual ethos that today may seem quaintly archaic. I Defining his 'political' purpose in Animal Farm to the American critic Dwight Macdonald, Orwell showed he was no crusading anti-communist: I think that if the USSR were conquered by some foreign country the working classes everywhere would lose heart ... I wouldn't want to see the USSR destroyed and think it ought to be defended if necessary. But I want people to become disillusioned about it and to realize that they must build their own Socialist movement . . . and I want the existence of democratic Socialism in the West to exert a regenerative influence upon Russia.6 Orwell's artistic aim was to remedy what England lacked: 'a literature of disillusionment about the Soviet Union' (iii. 272). If we apply Tolstoy's definition of art (which includes Orwellian hallmarks of simplicity, clarity, and accessibility) as the evocation of a feeling once experienced so as to make others feel it, Orwell had to evoke his disillusion over the Russian failure to achieve what to English Conservatives was anathema: social equality. The disillusion is conveyed by continuous negation of what is being said, through wit, dramatized irony and intertextuality. The punning presentment of old Major as a 'prize Middle White boar' (p. 1)' makes a poor introduction to any speaker. His boast, 'I have had much time for thought as I lay alone in my stall, and I think I may say that I understand the nature of life on this earth as well as any animal now living' (p. 3), not only betrays woolly-minded, pigsty 3 See G.

Similarly, his personal resume, 'I am twelve years old and have had over four hundred children. Such is the natural life of a pig' (p. 5), makes it doubtful that social revolution can improve animal nature, and his optimistic prophecy that English fields 'Shall be trod by beasts alone' (p. 7) is unsettling. Major's axiom that 'All animals are comrades' is quickly exploded as the dogs chase the rats and then vote against accepting them as comrades, while the cat, who hasn't even listened, hedges her bets by voting on both sides. And with a blast from his shotgun, after which the whole farm is 'asleep in a moment' (p. 8), Jones completely deflates Major's oratory. Intertextually, Major unwittingly parodies Saint-Simon and Marx in calling Man 'the only creature that consumes without producing' (p. 4), since Man does produce, as the animals find when they have to trade with him. More ominously, Major's reference to animal life as 'miserable, laborious and short' (p. 3) echoes the famous verdict on human life as 'solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short' by Hobbes,8 whom Orwell saw as forecasting totalitarianism,9 and the name of Animal Farm's leader recalls a Dostoyevskian view that every- where there is always 'a first person and a second person. The first acts and the second takes .... In France there was a revolution and every one was executed. Napoleon came along and took everything. The revolution is the first person, and Napoleon the second person. But it turned out that the revolution became the second person and Napoleon became the first person.'10 The Battle of the Cowshed likewise evokes not only the failed Western interventions against the Soviets in 1918-20, but also the defeat of Europe by the French republic in 1792-5. The Battle of the Windmill rings a special bell: the repulse of the duke of Brunswick in 1792, following the Prussian bombardment that made the windmill of Valmy famous. More significantly, in 1802 Napoleon restored slavery, abolished by the Convention in 1794.

Trotsky seasons his History of the Russian Revolution and The Revolution Betrayed with references to Danton, Robespierre, and Bonapartism, calling Stalin's triumph 'The Soviet Thermidor'. In a dramatic debate between Lenin and Kerensky, Lenin demanded: '"Then let us have one of two things: either a bourgeois government with its plans for so-called social reform on paper ... or let us have . . . a Government of the proletariat, which had its parallel in 1792 in France."' Kerensky's reply was prophetic: "'We have been referred to 1792 as an example of how we should carry out the revolution of 1917. But how did the French republic of 1792 end? It turned into a base Imperialism, which set back the progress of democracy for many a long year. . . . You tell us that you fear reaction," he almost screamed; "you say that you want to strengthen our new-won freedom, and yet you propose to lead us the way of France in 1792. . . . Out of the fiery</page><page sequence="4">762 PAUL KIRSCHNER More obviously, the switch from Major's anthem 'Beasts of England' to the patriotic 'Animal Farm' parodies that from Lenin's internationalism to Stalin's 'Socialism in One Country'. The Rebellion, however, copies the February, not the October, Revolution. In a pamphlet12 Orwell marked 'very rare' and cited (iv. 85), Maxim Litvinov, the first Soviet ambassador to England, told how spontaneous protests by women in food queues led to riots in which Cossacks, then Guards, joined the people, so that 'before anyone was properly aware, the capital was in the hands of the workers and soldiers'.'" The Rebellion, sparked by Jones's failure to feed the animals, is similarly unplanned: they win the day 'almost before they knew what was happening' (p. 12). With history as his guide, Orwell divides the feelings that start a revolt from the ideology used afterwards to pervert it. Similarly, the spontaneous courage displayed in the Battle of the Cowshed is embalmed in the titles 'Animal Hero-First and Second Class': the first official nod to class distinction. Naturalistic description is at first whimsical (Clover, cradling ducklings maternally with her foreleg, 'had never quite got her figure back after her fourth foal', p. 2), but as the Commandments are chipped away and the pig- managers increasingly resemble farmers, the allegory requires balancing. Physical details, previously anthropomorphic, now remind us that Napoleon is a pig, since morally he begins to seem all too human. Snowball draws plans for the windmill ('with a piece of chalk gripped between the knuckles of his trotter, he would move rapidly to and fro . . . uttering little whimpers of excitement' (p. 33)), and Napoleon urinates over them. He signals his coup d'etat by 'a high-pitched whimper of a kind no one had ever heard him utter before' (p. 35). Animality is preserved by wordplay when Napoleon hires a human solicitor named Whymper-the sound, we now recognize, made by a pig. Disillusion is best transmitted by narration from the animals' point of view. When Muriel spells out the altered commandment 'No animal shall kill any other animal without cause' (p. 61), we find that the animals have forgotten the last two words of the original commandment. But are our memories better? Ransacking them, we feel the animals' fading hopes. And having been kept, like them, ignorant of their leader's manoeuvres, we share their shock at learning that Napoleon has sold the timber to Frederick and been cheated with forged banknotes. The aim isn't just to mimic the diplomatic minuet of West and East, each hoping Hitler would attack the other first; it is to make us share the animals' gradual conversion to Benjamin's view that their lot cannot improve-only worsen. Yet the very devices vindicating Benjamin's pessim- chaos that you wish to make will arise, like a Phoenix, a dictator"' (H. Pitcher, Witnesses of the Russian Revolution (London, 1994), 112-14). 12 M.

When, after their initial victory, we are told: 'Some hams hanging in the kitchen were taken out for burial' (p. 14), the humorous conceit is endearing; but deeper sympathy is gained by an inside view. After a new 'rebellion' is crushed (the word 'revolution', implying lasting change, is avoided) and the commandment against murder is broken, a view of the farm on a clear spring evening dissolves into the mind of Clover, lying on the knoll where she once fRted victory: If she herself had had any picture of the future, it had been of a society of animals set free from hunger and the whip, all equal, each working according to his capacity, the strong protecting the weak, as she had protected the lost brood of ducklings with her foreleg on the night of Major's speech. Instead-she did not know why-they had come to a time when no one dared speak his mind, when fierce, growling dogs roamed everywhere, and when you had to watch your comrades torn to pieces after confessing to shocking crimes. There was no thought of rebellion or disobedience in her mind. She knew that even as things were they were far better off than they had been in the days of Jones, and that before all else it was needful to prevent the return of the human beings. Whatever happened, she would remain faithful, work hard, carry out the orders that were given to her, and accept the leadership of Napoleon. But still, it was not for this that she and all the other animals had hoped and toiled. . . . Such were her thoughts, though she lacked the words to express them. (pp. 58-9) The inarticulate, duped by the articulate, have been evicted not from paradise, but from a dream of one: now the very idea of rebellion is dead. Disenchant- ment is complete before the end of the book, as Squealer proclaims victory over Frederick, and the loyal Boxer asks, 'What victory?' (p. 71), widening his chink of doubt over Snowball's 'crimes'. Yet to the last, the 'lower animals', now unable to remember better days, continue to hope. (Memory for them is the enemy of hope.) Literary form-their quality as animals-adds the deeper sadness of losers in the battle of evolution. II So pessimistic an outlook is belied by Orwell's own life and opinions during the years 1936-45. Benjamin's gloomy scepticism is sometimes attributed to Orwell's disillusionment with socialism after Stalinist treachery in Spain, covered up by the 'capitalist anti-Fascist press' (i. 318). The truth is just the opposite. Orwell had seen through the USSR long before Spain. In 1940 he wrote: 'All people who are morally sound have known since about 1931 [the peak of forced collectivization] that the Russian regime stinks' (i. 583). In 1947 he spoke of regarding it 'with plain horror' for 'quite 15 years' (iv. 355). Yet, two weeks before leaving Spain, after the Barcelona fighting and being wounded at the front, he declared: 'I . . . at last really believe in Socialism, which I never did before' (i. 301). In The Lion and the Unicorn (1941) Orwell advocated nationalization of land, mines, railways, banks, and big industries;</page><page sequence="6">764 PAUL KIRSCHNER income ceilings; classless education; and Dominion status for India. In 1946 he recalled: 'The Spanish war and other events in 1936-7 turned the scale and thereafter I knew where I stood. Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for democratic Socialism, as I understand it' (i. 28). 'Socialism' meant equality; not, as its enemies claimed, loss of liberty. On the contrary, 'the only regime which, in the long run, will dare to permit freedom of speech is a Socialist regime' (i. 373). 'Liberty' began with fairer income distribution: 'The glaring inequality of wealth that existed in England before the war must not be allowed to recur' (iii. 51). While rejecting 'the inherently mechanistic Marxist notion that if you make the necessary technical advance the moral advance will follow of itself' (i. 583), he defended Marx on novel grounds claiming that: the most important part of Marx's theory is contained in the saying: 'Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.' [Luke 12: 34] But before Marx developed it, what force had that saying had? Who had paid any attention to it? Who had inferred from it-what it certainly implies-that laws, religions and moral codes are all a superstructure built over existing property relations? It was Christ, according to the Gospel, who uttered the text, but it was Marx who brought it to life. And ever since he did so the motives of politicians, priests, judges, moralists and millionaires have been under the deepest suspicion-which, of course, is why they hate him so much. (iii. 121-2)14 Although by 'Communism' Orwell usually meant the Russian regime or its advocacy ('the "Communism" of the English intellectual is ... the patriotism of the deracinated' (i. 565)), he also used the word in an ideal sense: In mid-nineteenth-century America men felt themselves free and equal, were free and equal, so far as that is possible outside a society of pure Communism. (i. 547) One can accept, and most enlightened people would accept, the Communist thesis that pure freedom will only exist in a classless society, and that one is most nearly free when one is working to bring such a society about. (iv. 84) What he did not accept was 'the quite unfounded claim that the Communist Party is itself aiming at the establishment of the classless society and that in the U.S.S.R. this aim is actually on the way to being realized' (iv. 84). But while recognizing similarities in practice between Nazi and Soviet regimes, Orwell never equated fascism or Nazism with either socialism or communism. In 1936 he observed that, in reading Marxist literary criticism, 'even a quite intelligent outsider can be taken in by the vulgar lie, now so 14 He also gave new meaning to Marx's famous definition of religion: 'Marx did not say, at any rate in that place, that religion is merely a dope handed out from above; he said that it is something the people create for themselves to supply a need that he recognized to be a real one. "Religion is the sigh of the soul in a soulless world. Religion is the opium of the people." What is he saying except that man does not live by bread alone, that hatred is not enough, that a world worth living in cannot be founded on "realism" and machine-guns?' (ii. 33). Marxism meant that the question of man's place in the universe 'cannot be dealt with while the average human being's preoccupations are necessarily economic. It is all summed up in Marx's saying that after Socialism has arrived, human history can begin' (iii. 83).</page><page sequence="7">THE DUAL PURPOSE OF ANIMAL FARM 765 popular, that "Communism and Fascism are the same thing"' (i. 291). He saw German fascism as 'a form of capitalism that borrows from Socialism just such features as will make it efficient for war purposes' (ii. 101), and drew a basic distinction: the idea underlying Fascism is irreconcilably different from that which underlies Socialism. Socialism aims, ultimately, at a world-state of free and equal human beings. It takes the equality of human beings for granted. Nazism assumes just the opposite. The driving force behind the Nazi movement is the belief in human inequality, the superiority of Germans to all other races, the right of Germany to rule the world. (ii. 102) For Orwell, Stalinism was the betrayal of an ideal, Nazism the fulfilment of one. In 1937 he warned: 'Fascism after all is only a development of capitalism, and the mildest democracy, so-called, is liable to turn into Fascism when the pinch comes' (i. 318). The next year he joined the Independent Labour Party and gave his reasons: 'It is not possible for any thinking person to live in such a society as our own without wanting to change it. ... One has got to be actively a Socialist, not merely sympathetic to Socialism' (i. 374). The tendency to equate the sceptical Benjamin with Orwell therefore looks odd, until one notices that it is Benjamin who untypically comes galloping, braying at the top of his lungs, 'Come at once! They're taking Boxer away!' and that, as the animals stupidly wave goodbye to Boxer in the van, it is Benjamin who shouts: 'Fools! Do you not see what is written on the side of that van?... Do you not understand what that means? They are taking Boxer to the knacker's!' (pp. 81-2). The scene echoes the GPU's abduction of Trotsky, related by his wife: 'I shouted to the men who were carrying Lev D[avidovitch] down the stairs and demanded that they let out my sons, the elder of whom was to accompany us into exile. ... On the way down the stairs, Lvova rang all the door-bells, shouting: "They're carrying Comrade Trotsky away!"''" Internally, however, what matters is that Benjamin tells the animals what they cannot 'read' for themselves, as the author/narrator has been doing for us. By usurping authorial function, Benjamin suddenly becomes the author-not by prudently keeping silent, but by placing sympathy before safety. He becomes 'Orwell' when, through him, the 'author' suddenly seems to drop his mask and show where his heart lies. In portraying Stalinist betrayal, in fact, Orwell implicitly arraigns capitalism as well. Timothy Cook first remarked in print that Boxer's motto 'I will work harder' echoes that of the immigrant 'workhorse' Jurgis in Upton Sinclair's exposure of the Chicago meatpacking industry in The Jungle (1906).16 The echo is probably deliberate-Orwell once praised Sinclair's factual accuracy (i. 262)-but it is too simple to say, as Cook does, that Animal Farm is an 15 Leon Trotsky, My Life (New York, 1930), 541. 16 T. Cook, 'Upton Sinclair's The Jungle and Orwell's Animal Farm: A Relationship Explored', Modern Fiction Studies, 30/4 (Winter 1984), 696-703.</page><page sequence="8">766 PAUL KIRSCHNER 'answer to the hopeful message'17 of Sinclair's book, to which Jurgis listens only after the work accident that-analogously to Boxer's physical decline- puts him on the capitalist scrapheap. Cook skips Sinclair's most sensational revelation: the processing for sale as lard of workers who fell into the rendering vats-a cannibalistic touch paralleled in Animal Farm when the pigs buy a case of whisky with the money they get for Boxer, who fulfils Major's prediction that Jones will one day sell him to the knacker's. Boxer's fate, in other words, isn't specific to the USSR. Far from refuting socialism, Animal Farm shows that totalitarianism in socialist clothing ends in the very evils of capitalism that led Orwell in 1941 to consider socialism inevitable: 'The inefficiency of private capitalism has been proved all over Europe. Its injustice has been proved in the East End of London' (ii. 117). After writing Animal Farm he called capitalism 'doomed' and 'not worth saving anyway' (iii. 266). What Orwell discredited was not socialism but its sham: genuine progress, he believed, 'can only happen through increasing enlightenment, which means the continuous destruction of myths' (iv. 56). This has been the writer's task since Aristophanes, and in the 1940s it was not confined to exposing Russian communism. When, in 1949, Arthur Miller's naive free-enterprise idealist Willy Loman, sacked after thirty-four years by his former boss's son, belatedly discovered an unmarketable value-'You can't eat an orange and throw the peel away-a man is not a piece of fruit!'-Miller effectively demythologized his own country's economic system. Decades later he recalled how Columbia Pictures first weakened the movie Death ofa Salesman, then asked him to issue an anti-communist publicity statement and preface the film by interviews praising selling as a profession.18 On the other side of the ideological divide British publishers, kow-towing to left-wing readers and a wartime ally, similarly rejected Animal Farm. Orwell's proposed preface was prescient: For all I know, by the time this book is published my view of the Soviet regime may be the generally-accepted one. But what use would that be in itself? To exchange one orthodoxy for another is not necessarily an advance. The enemy is the gramophone mind, whether or not one agrees with the record that is being played at the moment. (p. 106) At the closing banquet Soviet tyranny mirrors its capitalist counterpart. Orwell claimed, however, that he meant to end not with a 'complete reconciliation of the pigs and the humans', but on 'a loud note of discord', 'for I wrote it immediately after the Teheran Conference which everybody thought had established the best possible relations between the USSR and the West. I personally did not believe that such good relations would last long; and, as events have shown, I wasn't far wrong' (p. 113). But if the banquet parodies Teheran, the shot that goes home is Pilkington's solidarity with Animal Farm's proprietors in extracting more work for less food than any 17 Cook, 'Sinclair's Jungle', 697. 18 Arthur Miller, Timebends: A Life (London, 1987), 315.</page><page sequence="9">THE DUAL PURPOSE OF ANIMAL FARM 767 other farmer in the country: 'If you have your lower animals to contend with ... we have our lower classes!' (p. 92). Whom 'we' stood for, Orwell made clear in 1942: The war has brought the class nature of their society very sharply home to English people, in two ways. First of all there is the unmistakable fact that all real power depends on class privilege. You can only get certain jobs if you have been to one of the right schools, and if you fail and have to be sacked, then somebody else from one of the right schools takes over, and so it continues. This may go unnoticed when things are prospering, but becomes obvious in moments of disaster. (ii. 241) Asked if he had intended a statement about revolution in general, Orwell said that he had meant that that kind of revolution (violent conspiratorial revolution, led by unconsciously power- hungry people) can only lead to a change of masters. I meant the moral to be that revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert and know how to chuck out their leaders as soon as the latter have done their job. The turning-point of the story was supposed to be when the pigs kept the milk and apples for themselves (Kronstadt). If the other animals had had the sense to put their foot down then, it would have been all right. . . . In the case of the Trotskyists ... they feel responsible for the events in the USSR up to about 1926 and have to assume that a sudden degeneration took place about that date, whereas I think the whole process was foreseeable-and was foreseen by a few people, e.g. Bertrand Russell-from the very nature of the Bolshevik party. What I was trying to say was, 'You can't have a revolution unless you make it for yourself; there is no such thing as a benevolent dictatorship.'19 So much for Eliot's dismissal of the 'positive point of view' in Animal Farm as 'generally Trotskyite'.20 Yet Orwell's own exegesis is uneasy, since the initial revolt, despite indoctrination by the pigs, is not conspiratorial but spon- taneous. It also begs vital questions. How can revolution be achieved? How should the 'masses' 'chuck out' leaders who have seized power? Lenin hoped- reckoning without Stalin-that education and mass participation would naturally follow a violent conspiratorial revolution-for him the only kind feasible. Similarly, Orwell assumed in 1940 that revolution would come automatically through winning the war, but later saw he had 'underrated the enormous strength of the forces of reaction' (iii. 339). He continued to back Russia 'because I think the U.S.S.R. cannot altogether escape its past and retains enough of the original ideas of the Revolution to make it a more hopeful phenomenon than Nazi Germany' (iii. 178), but he nailed the root cause of revolutionary failure: Throughout history, one revolution after another . . . has simply led to a change of masters, because no serious effort has been made to eliminate the power instinct.... In the minds of active revolutionaries, at any rate the ones who 'got there', the longing for 19 Letter to D. Macdonald, 5 Dec. 1946 (Yale).

Quoted in Crick, George Orwell, 458.</page><page sequence="10">768 PAUL KIRSCHNER a just society has always been fatally mixed up with the intention to secure power for themselves. (iv. 36) In this light, Eliot's cavil, 'after all, your pigs are far more intelligent than the other animals, and therefore the best qualified to run the farm . . . so that what was needed (someone might argue) was not more communism but more public-spirited pigs',21 looks cagily facetious. What was needed (someone might reply) was, precisely, real implementation of the ideal perverted by the self-serving pigs-something Eliot, with his personal investment in religious conservatism, would hardly have approved. Even Empson's objection that the Revolution appeared foredoomed is redundant: Orwell knew that 'all the seeds of evil were there from the start' (iv. 35). The depth of his disillusion is nevertheless a measure of his sympathy with the hopes betrayed. Fearing a sell-out of socialism by those waving its flag at home, he chose the Independent Labour Party because it alone provided 'the certainty that I would never be led up the garden path in the name of capitalist democracy' (i. 375). When Attlee took over in 1945 Orwell was on his guard: 'A Labour government may be said to mean business if it (a) nationalizes land, coal mines, railways, public utilities and banks, (b) offers India immediate Dominion Status (this is a minimum), and (c) purges the bureaucracy, the army, the diplomatic service, etc., so thoroughly as to forestall sabotage from the Right' (iii. 448). He faced the dilemma: 'Capitalism leads to dole queues, the scramble for markets, and war. Collectivism leads to concentration camps, leader worship, and war. There is no way out of this unless a planned economy can be somehow combined with the freedom of the intellect, which can only happen if the concept of right and wrong is restored to politics' (iii. 144). Yet he scorned the flattering unction of 'neo-pessimists': 'Men cannot be made better by act of Parliament; therefore I may as well go on drawing my dividends' (iii. 82). His answer was to 'dissociate Socialism from Utopianism' (iii. 83) and seek progress through failure itself: 'Perhaps some degree of suffering is ineradicable from human life, perhaps the choice before man is always a choice of evils, perhaps even the aim of Socialism is not to make the world perfect but to make it better. All revolutions are failures, but they are not all the same failure' (iii. 282). III None of this philosophy comes across in Animal Farm. In fact, Eliot's red herring highlights a troubling correlation. 'Class' in Animal Farm-unlike in England-is determined by native intelligence. It is 'the more intelligent animals' (p. 9) whose outlook is transformed by Major's speech. The pigs rule by brainpower ('The other animals understood how to vote, but could never 21 Quoted in Crick, George Orwell, 458.</page><page sequence="11">THE DUAL PURPOSE OF ANIMAL FARM 769 think of any resolutions of their own' (p. 19)). Except for the author's alter ego Benjamin, the pigs alone learn to read perfectly. On the other hand, the noble, selfless Boxer, who has 'no wish to take life, not even human life' (p. 28), is of 'stupid appearance' and 'not of first-rate intelligence' (p. 2). It is hard not to suspect that it is because he is stupid that he is good; that power-hunger must accompany intelligence-unless checked by an instinct of self-preservation (Benjamin, who can read as well as any pig, wisely abstains from doing so). Intelligence-aiming at power, safety, or animal comforts-itself becomes a satirical target. The Rebellion is at first beneficial (a detail professional anti- communists naturally ignored). The fault lies not in the theory but in the theorists. In the passage Orwell deemed crucial, the clever pigs, including both Napoleon and Snowball, privatize the milk and apples instead of sharing them out equally, arguing that they are brain workers and that Science has proved milk and apples necessary for their well-being, without which Jones will come again. A new class system is born based on biological inequality, its command- ments issued not by the sugar-candy religion of the preaching raven Moses, but by the intellectual religion of Science (Lenin's 'scientific socialism'). As their pilfered privileges coalesce, the pigs learn to walk on their hind legs, and accordingly teach the sheep to chant, 'Four legs good-two legs better', thereby hypostatizing managerial function into ruling-class status. The last altered commandment on the barn wall-that new English proverb 'All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others'-may come from Paradise Lost, when Eve decides that hiding her ill-gotten knowledge from Adam will render her 'more equal, and perhaps I A thing not undesirable, sometime Superior' (a professed aim of removing inequality masks a desire to reverse it). Crick cites Orwell's claim to have discovered 'the joy of mere words'22 reading Paradise Lost at Eton, and the attribution is apposite both to lost paradises and to intellectual power-seeking: it is the clever animals who become 'more equal'. This exaltation of brainwork follows allegorical logic rather than Soviet dogma. 'Even the most stubborn among the 'intellectuals', Litvinov predicted in 1918, 'will soon learn that, after all, the people is a much better master than the capitalist, and that a Socialist regime is likely to render them more happy than a bourgeois regime.'23 Animal Farm, however, inverts Hobbes's apology for absolutism: it is not equality of faculties that fosters dangerous 'equality of hope'24 but equality of hope that founders on unequal faculties. Empson saw the paradox: the effect of the farmyard, with its unescapable racial differences, is to suggest that the Russian scene had unescapable social differences too-so the metaphor suggests that the Russian revolution was always a pathetically impossible attempt. . . . the pigs can 22 Ibid. 123. 23 Litvinov, The Bolshevik Revolution, 54. 24 Hobbes, Leviathan, I. xiii (p. 84).</page><page sequence="12">770 PAUL KIRSCHNER turn into men, but the story is far from making one feel that any of the other animals could have turned into men ...25 The implication is probably the last thing Orwell intended: he, if anyone, knew that nothing suits a ruling class better than a genetic alibi. Rather, he meant that animalkind's dream of equality founders because the very brains needed to achieve it demand superior status: the power of reason becomes the reason of power. Stressing the pigs' cleverness may have been a swipe at British intellectuals, who alone accepted the 'ruthless ideologies of the Continent' and formed an 'island of bigotry amid the general vagueness' (iii. 31). In 1940 Orwell noted, 'The thing that frightens me about the modern intelligentsia is their inability to see that human society must be based on common decency, whatever the political and economic forms may be.' His 'chief hope' was the ordinary person's moral code: 'I have never had the slightest fear of a dictatorship of the proletariat. . . . But I admit to having a perfect horror of a dictatorship of theorists' (i. 582-3). After writing Animal Farm he called British intellectuals 'more totalitarian-minded than the common people' (iii. 143) and observed: 'In our country . .. it is the liberals who fear liberty and the intellectuals who want to do dirt on the intellect' (p. 107). The pigs' intellect, however, may also reflect a historical scruple. Orwell admitted that his knowledge of Russia consisted 'only of what can be learned by reading books and newspapers' (p. 111). One book he mentions respect- fully, John Reed's Ten Days That Shook the World (p. 170), mirrors the paradox of Animal Farm. Reed, also anti-intellectual but on other grounds, insists that the revolution was made by the masses; that the Bolsheviks were 'not rich in trained and educated men'.26 He identifies 'intellectuals' with the provisional government, citing a young woman's sneer at soldiers and work- men arriving at the Congress of Soviets: 'See how rough and ignorant they look!'27 When an anarchist calls the Bolsheviks 'common, rude, ignorant persons, without aesthetic sensibilities', Reed snorts: 'He was a real specimen of the Russian intelligentsia'. Yet, paradoxically, he hails 'great Lenin' as 'a leader purely by virtue of intellect; colourless, humourless, uncompromising and detached, without picturesque idiosyncrasies-but with the power of explaining profound ideas in simple terms, of analysing a concrete situation. And combined with shrewdness, the greatest intellectual audacity.'28 This kind of thing baffled British journalists. E. H. Wilson complained that Lenin frequently introduced 'political and economic conceptions which can hardly be intelligible to untrained minds'. Philips Price recalled him unflatter- ingly as 'a short man with a round head, small pig-like eyes, and close-cropped 25 Letter to G. Orwell, 24 Aug. 1945 (Orwell Archive).

One sat spellbound at his command of language and the passion of his denunciation. But when it was all over one felt inclined to scratch one's head and wonder what it was all about.'29 Robert Bruce Lockhart, in Memoirs of a British Agent, learned to respect Lenin's 'intellectual capacity', but at first was more impressed by 'his tremendous will-power, his relentless determination, and his lack of emotion. He furnished a complete antithesis to Trotsky ... Trotsky was a great organiser and a man of immense physical courage. But, morally, he was as incapable of standing against Lenin as a flea would be against an elephant.'30 Orwell's view of Lenin was hypothetical. In 1944 he generalized that 'all efforts to regenerate society by violent means lead to the cellars of the O.G.P.U. Lenin leads to Stalin, and would have come to resemble Stalin if he had happened to survive' (iii. 278). In 1946 he coupled Lenin with Cromwell as 'one of those politicians who win an undeserved reputation by dying prematurely. Had he lived, it is probable that he would either have been thrown out, like Trotsky,3' or would have kept himself in power by methods as barbarous, or nearly as barbarous, as those of Stalin' (iv. 200-1). This does not, nevertheless, make Napoleon a composite. Although Lockhart's simile fits Snowball and Napoleon, the latter prevails not by intellectual and moral ascendancy-no pig matches Lenin there-but by self-seeking cunning. Orwell specified his target by altering his text to Napoleon's advantage when the windmill is blown up, to be 'fair to J[oseph] S[talin], as he did stay in Moscow during the German advance' (iii. 407). If he bent over backwards to be fair to a 'disgusting murderer' (ii. 461), he might have felt a qualm in parodying the Revolution minus its mastermind. The clever pigs would make amends: if 'the symmetry of the story' (p. 113) meant leaving Lenin out, his distinguishing mark, at least, could be left in. IV In any case, Orwell was bound by the form he used, one responsible both for the contradictions of Animal Farm and for its permanent appeal. Initially, he described it as 'a kind of parable'.32 A parable makes a point, not fine distinctions, and a fable is also limited.33 It may be because Orwell felt 29 Quoted in Pitcher, Witnesses of the Russian Revolution, 110-11, 112. 30 R. H. B. Lockhart, Memoirs of a British Agent (London, 1932), 238. 31 Trotsky quotes Krupskaya in 1926: 'If Ilych were alive, he would probably already be in prison': The Revolution Betrayed (New York, 1995), 93-4. 32 M. Meyer, Not Prince Hamlet: Literary and Theatrical Memoirs (London, 1989), 68. 33 For example, even if Orwell had not stressed the pigs' cleverness they would still have had to dominate by intelligence, not education. Letemendia ('Revolution on Animal Farm', 17), however, breaches the metaphor in blaming the passivity of the animals on their brief lifespan and 'consequent shortness of their memory', and a class structure fixed by 'their immutable</page><page sequence="14">772 PAUL KIRSCHNER constricted by the parable form that he redefined his book as 'a little fairy story ... with a political meaning'34 and finally subtitled it 'A Fairy Story'. The misnomer merits attention. Animal Farm has none of the fairies, princes, witches, spells, magic transformations, or happy endings associated with the 'fairy story'.35 Once the metaphor is established, the rest is history. In fact, Animal Farm has been called a 'fable', defined as a 'brief, single episode' in which speaking animals, plants, objects, and humans metaphorically illustrate and satirize human conduct, although 'in practice it is occasionally rendered in terms of other generic forms: for instance as mirchen [folk tales] (e.g. "Little Red Riding Hood")'.36 Chesterton more acutely compared persons in a fable to algebraic abstractions or chess pieces, whereas the fairy tale absolutely revolves on the pivot of human personality. If no hero were there to fight the dragons, we should not even know that they were dragons. ... If there is no personal prince to find the Sleeping Beauty, she will simply sleep. Fables repose on quite the opposite idea; that everything is itself, and will in any case speak for itself. The wolf will always be wolfish; the fox will always be foxy.37 Animal Farm spans both genres: the sheep remain sheep; the dogs, dogs; the cat, a cat; but the pigs, horses, and donkey all display elements of 'human personality', although Benjamin's world-pessimism goes back to IEsop's fable 'The Oxen and the Butchers', in which an old ox stops his brothers from rising against the butchers, arguing that they at least cause no needless pain, but that, if they are killed, inexperienced slaughterers will replace them and inflict greater suffering: 'For you may be sure that, even though all the Butchers perish, mankind will never go without their beef.'38 'Fairy tale' of course may simply signify fantasy, but this hardly fits Animal Farm, which derives its authority precisely from historical events that are in turn illuminated by it. The subtitle points, therefore, to a parodic impulse, like that which the functions on the farm'. In fact, Benjamin, who stresses his longevity, is as passive as the others, and if they are all made victims of zoological limitations the meaning is lost. Their actions, fate, and differences in intelligence must be read as human. Lack of previous education is a common extrinsic factor, but when the pigs try to teach the animals to read, only Benjamin attains their proficiency-proving the pigs' inborn superiority. 34 Letter to Gollancz, 19 Mar. 1944, quoted in Crick, George Orwell, 452. 35 The 'fairy story' or conte defies, a term invented by educated women who in the 1690s gave literary polish to medieval and folk tales, does not have 'political' meaning, although Perrault used it to preach 'morals' endorsing the social order. (Perrault did not call his collection Contes de fies but Histoires ou contes du temps passe: Avec des moralites (Stories or Tales of Past Times: With Morals).) 36 D. M. Roemer, in M. E. Brown and B.

Arthur Rackham (London, 1975), 10. 38 Ibid. 72. Orwell, however, was modern in making his protagonist a community. A precedent was Mark Twain's 'The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg' (1899), in which a self-righteous town revises its motto 'Lead Us Not Into Temptation' to 'Lead Us Into Temptation', after its renowned honesty is shown to be skin-deep.</page><page sequence="15">THE DUAL PURPOSE OF ANIMAL FARM 773 Teheran conference inspired. But why parody a 'fairy story' for 'political' purposes? The answer may again lie in the springs of Orwell's inspiration. In his preface to the Ukrainian edition he mentions having seen a carthorse whipped and thinking that 'men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat' (p. 112), but this skirts the issue.39 Other suggested 'sources' are equally unconvincing.40 The parodic mode is more fertile. Parodies of magic tales go back to their inception, and fables have also been parodied,41 but Charles Dickens provided the precedent of fairy-tale parody at one remove. When George Cruikshank 'altered the text of a fairy story' to propagate 'doctrines of Total Abstinence, Prohibition of the sale of spirituous liquors, Free Trade, and Popular Education',42 Dickens vowed: Half playfully &amp; half seriously I mean to protest most strongly against alteration-for any purpose-of the beautiful little stories which are so tenderly &amp; humanly useful to us in these times when the world is too much with us, early &amp; late; and then to re-write Cinderella according to Total-abstinence, Peace Society, and Bloomer principles, and especially for their propagation.43 39 Orwell had already used the horse in an abandoned war novel, 'The Quick and the Dead', where an officer sadistically whips a dying horse named 'old Boxer', 'presumably in the retreat in 1918': Orwell Archive, 'Literary Notebook No. 1', pp. 14-15. 40 It has been claimed that Orwell was directly inspired by his own BBC adaptation of Ignazio Silone's 'The Fox', misleadingly called 'a political allegory set in a pig farm' (The Lost Writings, ed. West, 60). Formally it is not 'allegory', but a realistic story in which an anti-fascist Ticino peasant grows to like an injured Italian engineer brought into his house. When the engineer is identified as a local fascist spy the peasant humanely refuses to have him killed by a fellow anti- fascist, only to see him escape with documents leading to mass arrests of Italian workmen. The peasant emotionally identifies the treacherous spy with a prowling fox that has finally been trapped, and hacks it to bits. All the characters, fox included, are flesh and blood, and the story has no relation in form or content to Animal Farm. Crick (George Orwell, 459) more persuasively cites the 'influence' of Swift's Houyhnhnms, which Orwell regarded as having reached 'the highest stage of totalitarian organization' (iv. 252); but the dynamic of transformation, vital to Animal Farm, is absent from the Houyhnhnms' static world. 41 After 1698 contes de fies were criticized as extravagant and parodied on the stage: see G. Rouger, introduction to Contes de Perrault (Paris, 1967), p. xlviii. They were perennially parodied, e.g. by Voltaire in The White Bull (1773-4) and by George MacDonald in the 1860s and Oscar Wilde in the 1890s: see J. Zipes, Fairy Tales and the Art of Subversion: The Classical Genre for Children and the Process of Civilization (London, 1983), 104-11, 114-21. Orwell might have read Wilde's parody of the 'happy ending' (e.g. the 'Star Child' becomes a good king, yet 'ruled he not long ... And he who came after him ruled evilly'). James Thurber, whom Orwell admired (iii. 325), delightfully parodied the fable in Fables for Our Time (1940). In 'The Owl Who Was God' Thurber tells how birds and beasts come to worship the owl as God because he can see in the dark (assuming he can see as well in the daytime) and because by luck he answers questions correctly with the few monosyllables he knows. Blindly following him, the animals are hit by a truck in broad daylight, and many, including the owl, are killed. Thurber's moral is: 'You can fool too many of the people too much of the time': Vintage Thurber, 2 vols. (London, 1983), i. 159. 42 Charles Dickens, 'Frauds on the Fairies' (1854), in Miscellaneous Papers/Edwin Drood (London, n.d.), 202. 43 Quoted in H. Stone, Dickens and the Invisible World: Fairy-Tales, Fantasy and Novel-Making (New York, 1979), 2.</page><page sequence="16">774 PAUL KIRSCHNER Dickens kept his word. In 'Frauds on the Fairies' he denounced 'the intrusion of a Whole Hog of unwieldy dimensions into the fairy flower garden',44 adding a moralistic parody of 'Cinderella'. The same year he used fairy-tale imagery in Hard Times to attack education aimed solely at grooming the poor to serve the rich.4" Orwell may well have known 'Frauds on the Fairies'. During a five-month sanatorium cure in 1938 he kept Dickens's collected works in his room.46 In 1947 he himself contemplated a BBC version of 'Cinderella', calling it 'the tops so far as fairy tales go but ... too visual to be suitable for the air'. He imagined Cinderella as a wonderful singer unable to sing in tune (not a bad self-parody), and a godmother who cures her: 'One could make it quite comic with the wicked sisters singing in screeching voices' (iv. 318-19). Orwell's parodic idea sprang from technical necessities, but he knew that pastiche 'usually implies a real affection for the thing parodied' (iii. 193). Dickens parodied an abuse of the fairy tale. During the 1920s and 1930s children's stories in the Weimar Republic, the United States, and, to a lesser extent, England were again altered by a 'proletarian' or 'left-wing' slant to counter classic fairy tales seen as a tool of bourgeois socialization.47 Orwell at first thought of participating. In May 1940, after denouncing right-wing bias in boys' stories, he wrote to Robert Geoffrey Trease (author of a left-wing version of Robin Hood): 'this matter of intelligent fiction for kids is very important and I believe the time is approaching when it might be possible to do something about it'. Orwell, Trease recalled, had in mind some Leftish juvenile publishing scheme, pink in shade, perhaps backed by the T.U.C. or the Liberal News Chronicle. Not having read Homage to Catalonia, and being unaware of his disenchantment with the official Communist line, I did not fully appreciate his quip that, if Laurence and Wishart [Trease's left-wing publishers] did it, they would want books like 'boys of the Ogpu' or 'The Young Liquidators.' Later Trease realized that 'perhaps Orwell's quip had helped-that false history from the Right should not be countered with false history from the Left'.48 Whether Orwell feared that left-wing boys' stories would turn out like the communist tract quoted in his 'Boys' Weeklies' essay (i. 529), or whether he was chastened by Frank Richards's robust reply (i. 531-40),49 he dropped the 44 'Frauds on the Fairies', 201. 45 See A. Bony, 'Realite et imaginaire dans Hard Times', Etudes anglaises, 23/2 (Apr.-June 1970), 168-82. 46 Crick, George Orwell, 367. 47 See Zipes, Fairy Tales and the Art of Subversion, 135-64. 48 G.

I thank Nicholas Tucker for calling my attention to Trease and to The Adventures of the Little Pig (see below). 49 Richards viewed happiness in youth as the best preparation for later misery: 'At least, the poor kid will have had something!

In doing so, he may have been partly reacting in a Dickensian way to left- wing children's stories. One I recall vividly from my own childhood was the title story of a booklet by Helen Kay (pseud. Helen Colodny Goldfrank) called Battle in the Barnyard.50 The preface, 'To the Children of the Working Class', read: Dear Comrades: Once upon a time, a long long time ago, a book appeared called, 'Fairy Tales for Workers' Children.' But this was a long time ago, and the book has since run out of print. Now, we are starting anew. I offer this book as a challenge-a challenge to every reader to write for 'Us Kids.' These stories were penned when I was a 'Pioneer.' As a member of the Young Pioneers of America, I felt the need of such a children's book. Later, when I came to work with younger comrades, I even more clearly saw the demand for such stories. Today, the Pioneer movement is growing. . . . Farmers' children and kids of unemployed parents are rapidly joining our ranks. We must furnish them with our literature. I am glad to make this start. Several of these stories deal with real and living children. All tell of the class struggle. An older comrade told me some. Every one was written for you. I hope you'll like them. Comradely yours, HELEN KAY Kay's prototype was a collection of German 'proletarian' fairy tales by Hermynia Zur Mtihlen, translated and published in Chicago by the Daily Worker Press in 1925,51 and she saw herself as marching in the ranks of revolutionary history. (Note her claim to authority: 'An older comrade told me some'.) Paraphrase would not adequately convey the spirit of her story. I therefore give it in full: why should his fifteenth year be clouded by worrying about that in advance? He may, at thirty, get the sack-why tell him so at twelve?' Making children miserable was unjustifiable anyway, but 'the adult will be all the more miserable if he was miserable as a child' (i. 537). Richards's honest patriotism, anti-intellectualism, and affection for pre-1914 England would have appealed to the author of Coming up for Air. 50 New York: Workers Library Publishers, 1932. 51 Zipes, Fairy Tales and the Art ofSubversion, 154-5.

On this farm there lived at one time a happy colony of healthy chickens. Now the yard where these chickens lived was filled with very fertile soil. The rich ground contained a plentiful amount of worms upon which the chickens lived. There were long skinny worms, short stubby worms, and big fat worms. There were as many kinds of worms as there are people. Besides worms a great variety of caterpillars and bugs helped these chicks lead a healthy well-nourished life. In a corner of the yard where the chickens scratched away their time ran a refreshing spring. This spring was used by the chickens to quench their parched throats in the hot summer days. Many a happy day was passed by these roosters and hens. The chickens would rise with the sun, scratch for worms, drink water from the spring, cackling and crowing merrily all the while. The hens would lay eggs-and then tell the world about it in delight. 'Cut-cut-cut-ca-deh-cut!' they would cry. Just as if they were trying to say, 'I've laid an egg, the loveliest white egg!' The little downy chicks would play tag and leapfrog between their eating times, to while away the time until they in turn would grow up and become hens and roosters. The cocks would strut about the farm in their conceited manner, crowing and asking the world if it had not noticed their handsome plumage. 'Cock-a-doodle-do!' 'Am I not a handsome bird. Am I not. Am I not!' Then at the setting of the sun the chicken farm would become dark and silent- closed in the embrace of slumber. On this farm, however, there was one very sly ugly rooster, who had lost most of his fine feathers in his quarrels and fights with the other more sociable inmates of the farm. He would always take advantage of the young chicks. Being a very lazy fellow he would try to get out of doing his own scratching for worms. For instance, when a younger cock would dig up a dainty morsel from the rich loam, such as a lively young earthworm, this ugly monster would immediately pounce upon his comrade's dinner and gobble it all up. Yes, every single bit of it. This nasty habit made him very much hated by all the others on the farm. One day the entire colony was amazed. They were in fact so astonished at the sight before their eyes that words actually failed them. Even some of the more talkative hens who always had something to cackle about, couldn't find their tongues. Dear little comrades, it actually was an unusual sight, for there before their eyes, they saw for the first time this nasty rooster scratching away for worms! But what surprised them even more was that this greedy creature did not eat the worms he unearthed. He put them away. As many worms as he dug up he would lay in a pile on the ground. The inhabitants of the colony became nervous. Such a state of affairs was impossible. They were unable to understand it. Something had to be done about it. One evening at the setting of the sun, a huge mass meeting was called. It was advertised far and wide by the young cocks, who would perch themselves on high fences and, flapping their wings, would crow the order for the meeting. At this gathering the rooster was asked by the patriarchs and industrious hens of the colony, what the meaning of the huge pile of worms meant [sic]. The rooster promptly answered. 'Here, I have a huge pile of tasty bugs, catterpillars</page><page sequence="19">THE DUAL PURPOSE OF ANIMAL FARM 777 [sic], and worms .. .' He paused cleverly to let the audience take in the sight. 'If you will give me the corner of this yard where the spring runs-and allow me to keep it all to myself-I will give you in return that huge pile of food.' Without further thought the chicken community decided to do as the rooster bargained. His food was evenly divided among all the members of the village and in return he received that section of the yard where the cool spring ran. The chickens gossiped among themselves-telling each other how stupid the old rooster was to desire that bit of land in return for the delicious pile of eatables. After an hour or so everyone retired for the night. The sun set and the farm was dark and silent. The next morning the chickens arose as usual. The sun was up and shining brightly. The day became very hot and uncomfortable. The inmates of the farm grew very thirsty and as was their habit they strolled over to the spring to quench their thirst. However, as they came within reach of the precious water, the mean rooster arose and said: 'Cock-a-doodle-do! This spring does not belong to you. It's mine, you cannot drink here!' The thirsty chickens exclaimed, 'What do you mean, yours! It is everyone's.' The cock immediately answered, 'Didn't you sell it to me yesterday in return for the food that you have already eaten.' A young rebellious cock cried out, 'But we are thirsty. You cannot keep the water from us. We wish to drink.' The rooster replied, 'For every drink of water that you take out of my spring, I will in return take two worms!' Since the chickens were very thirsty they consented to this arrangement. The pile of worms which the old miserly cock reaped from the toil of the chickens began to grow by leaps and bounds. As a matter of fact it grew so large that he alone could not care for it. So he hired ten of the strongest young roosters on the farm to be his policemen. Their job was to take care of and to protect his hoard of worms. In return, he promised to give them enough water and food to live on, no more nor no less. No less-because he had to have strong husky well-nourished policemen to take care of and guard the surplus that he now lived upon. He would give them no more-because this wicked rooster wanted more and more for himself. This state of affairs went on for a long time. The chicken colony lost its usual happy satisfied expression. They did not crow as joyously as they did before. The young chickens were afraid to be merry. They were underfed and undernourished. They could no longer play without fear of disturbing the selfish cock. The hens could no longer lay good eggs, because they lacked food, and entertainment. They now had to labor from sunrise to sunset so that they could have enough food to live on, and enough food to give to the cruel rooster in return for the water that they so badly needed. The chicks who were born during this period were generally not strong enough to live. Most of them died and the tragic part was that those who did survive took the condition that now existed for granted. They thought it was impossible to live any other way. On the other hand the rooster grew bigger and fatter. His daughter also grew bigger and fatter. Neither had to work. They merely ate and played all day. They lived off the toil and sweat of their fellow chicks.</page><page sequence="20">778 PAUL KIRSCHNER Now, on the farm there was a duck, a very handsome graceful duck. He would waddle and quack all through the chicken farm. One day the rooster decided to marry his daughter to the duck, in order that she would become a duchess, and so be one of the nobility. The rooster went up to the duck and said, 'If you marry my daughter, and so make her a duchess, I will give you a share of my grounds and make you a partner in my food association. You will not have to scratch for your worms, but will live off the worms that the other chickens scratch up. You will lead a life of luxury and play, if you do this.' The duck agreed. And so they were married. They had little aristocratic duck-chicks born to lead lives of idleness. One day one of the roosters was tired of feeding the mean cock, and going hungry himself. He ran up single handed to the old miser and started to fight him. Of course, he was immediately killed by the police. This incident added to the suffering and to the downtrodden conditions of the other chickens. But they always remembered the brave young cock. Soon after this occurred, the ugly miser got another idea. He called over some more chickens. He told them that he would pay them more than the policeman if they would act as preachers. 'Your duty,' he said, 'is to tell the chickens to be submissive and obey me, the apostle of the lord in the heavens above. If they are submissive and do everything I and my family order them to do, when they die they will go to heaven, and there lead happy lives. But, if they rebel they will go down to the fires of hell and burn forever. The harder they work here on earth, the better time they will have in heaven.' As time went on the chickens slaved harder and harder, and the rooster grew richer and richer. They began to believe whatever the preacher chickens told them. They thought that conditions must always be as they are. That the greater amount of chickens should be poor and that a privileged few must live off the wealth that the poor chickens scratched up. One young and energetic cock who was deeply impressed by all the goings on, began to think. He thought and planned, and others helped him. Then they all decided that the only way to save the chickens of the farm, and themselves, from endless slavery was by driving out the selfish rooster, his daughter, the duchess, her husband, the duck, and the aristocratic duck-chicks, also their protectors, the policemen, and especially the preachers. Secret leaflets were printed and spread over the colony for the chickens to read and to learn the truth. Huge mass meetings were called and the exploited chicks were organized into battalions to drive out their oppressors. The chicken colony was in a state of excitement. If they won the battle they would again be free chickens. If they lost-no one wanted to think of that. They must win. And dear little comrades, they did win. They certainly were victorious. They drove the old rooster and his protectors out of their lives forever. The mean cock and his lazy good-for-nothing family were killed. The preachers and policemen fled from the farm. No one has ever heard of them since. Perhaps the wolves ate them. Now in the summer when the fields are green and the sunshine is golden in the country you can see the hens happily laying eggs, and the other chickens scratching away for worms. They have learned their lesson, and never again will anyone be able to trick them into slavery. The little chicks play tag and leap-frog in their merry way. You can hear them go 'Peep-peep-peep!' The roosters strut around the farm and crow, 'Cock-a- doodle-do!' The hens cry, 'Cluck-cluck-cluck!' They are all contented and equal.</page><page sequence="21">THE DUAL PURPOSE OF ANIMAL FARM 779 As far as I know, the only extant copy of Kay's booklet is in Harvard's Wiedner Library. A student of mine52 traced it for me twenty-five years ago: other libraries, he said, had 'removed' it during Senator Joe McCarthy's inquisition. On a fall evening in 1995 I visited the Wiedner and asked to see it. A guard, happily waiving the rules, took me down to the stacks, and there it was, its soft brown and buff cover as I had last seen it well over half a century before in the guest lounge of a holiday camp patronized by skilled low-paid workers. It was then (like myself) nine or ten years old, but still circulating. Like Combray from a teacup, a bygone hopeful ethos rose before my mental vision as I leafed through Kay's stories-'Bread', 'High Hat Ants', 'Strike Secret'-and saw what had worried librarians. In one story, 'Us Alley Kids', black and white children defying Jim Crow organized the poor of both races against exploitation: a threat that nearly materialized thirty years later in the last, 'integrated' march Martin Luther King was planning at the time he was murdered. By then Workers Library Publishers was long extinct.53 Today, the premise of Battle in the Barnyard is obsolete. As a Financial Times journalist sanguinely remarked: 'Long considered a basic right, water is now being looked at as a good investment.'54 The word 'Comrade' (which Orwell thought put people off socialism) needn't be banned, as it finally is on Animal Farm, for there is little risk of its use between members of contending national, religious, ethnic, linguistic, or sexual interest groups. In the new Russia the Song of the Volga Businessman proclaims the blessings brought to workers and pensioners by Soviet apparatchiks turned freebooting capitalists-giving Orwell's ending a prophetic resonance missing from Kay's.55 Yet, despite such progress, few 'great books' I have read since childhood have left me with as vivid a memory as Kay's, down to the cover drawing of the rout of the miserly rooster and his clan. That fact seems to me relevant to the enduring power of Animal Farm. The secret of Kay's impact on me as a child 52 Roger Webster. 53 I have tried unsuccessfully to trace Kay or another copyright-holder. 54 A. Mandel-Campbell, 'Water could make your cup runneth over', Financial Times, 16-17 Feb. 2002, 'Weekend' section, p. xxii. Private firms have acquired 85% of the world's water distribution (UBS Investment, July/Aug. 2001, p. 23). Although NGOs argue that privatization strikes the poorest and that water access should be free or charged at cost price, the World Water Forum does not recognize water as a 'basic human right'. The World Commission on Water, an arm of the World Bank, considers it a profitable resource, especially in poor countries (Le Monde, 24 Mar. 2000, p. 40). From the boardroom this looks ideal. If regulators menace profits, firms can invoke job losses. On the other hand, CEOs who boost the share price by sacking workers earn bigger bonuses, and if they have to be sacked in turn they are replaced, as in Orwell's day, by others like themselves, but rewarded for their failure beyond the wildest dreams of Orwell's contemporaries. Privatization, however, sparks conflict. Vivendi Environment was driven out of Tucuman Province, Argentina (International Herald Tribune, 27 Aug. 2002, p. 1). Another firm doubled the water price in Bolivia, provoking what has been called the world's first civil war over water (Le Point, 30 Aug. 2002, p. 87). Kay's far-fetched metaphor is today's fait divers. 55 'While millions of their countrymen suffered collapsing living standards, declining health and increasing alcoholism, a few [Russians] made enough money to join the ranks of the world's richest men' (Financial Times, 6/7 Apr. 2002, p. I).</page><page sequence="22">780 PAUL KIRSCHNER lay not in content but in form. Max Frisch once ascribed the peculiar force of marionettes to the fact that, unlike actors, they don't have to 'make believe', but are bodied forth as naked creations of the spirit."6 Animals representing humans operate similiarly.17 Like 'Battle in the Barnyard', Animal Farm gains force from elements of the fable and the magic folk tale while corresponding strictly to neither. Orwell's story structurally mirrors Kay's. Kay's idyllic prelude closed by a peaceful night's slumber precedes the insidious rise of a selfish capitalist tyrant, ultimately provoking conspiratorial revolt and a return to the idyllic status quo ante. Orwell's parodic utopian prelude is also followed by a peaceful night's sleep, but then by conspiracy and a rebellion paving the way for the insidious rise of a collectivist, ideological tyrant and even more hopeless oppression. Kay fares less well than Orwell in fusing artistic and political purpose. Beneath the communist catchwords, her nostalgia for a happy state of nature is closer to Rousseau than to Marx or Lenin, far from the open-ended stories of Zur Miihlen, whom she claimed as a model.58" Never- theless, the kinship between Orwell's story and Kay's is obvious: the collective protagonist, the gradual habituation to oppression, the word 'Comrade' used seductively by Kay, ironically by Orwell, and the calculated slippage from symbolic to direct statement (having established the young roosters as the miser's policemen Kay can say that the hungry rooster was 'killed by the police'; Orwell, after having Napoleon's dogs rip out the young pigs' throats in a metaphor conveying forced confession and execution, can credit Napoleon with the cry 'Death to humanity'). Both stories use preachers and private police, Orwell's more subtly. When Napoleon's private army of dogs wag their tails to their master, they remind us that a dog is Man's best friend. And when the preaching raven Moses, initially chased off the farm, later reappears, the pigs tolerate him, even giving him a daily gill of beer, as if to say 'Stick around, you may be needed.' This has been taken to symbolize Stalin's wartime entente with the Orthodox Church; more generally it reflects the potential convenience of religion to dictators (Hitler viewed his concordat with the Catholic Church as propitious for his war on Jews).59 Finally, if Orwell and Kay both play on words, Kay's duck-duchess and hens that 'always had something to cackle about' seem frivolous, whereas Orwell's ham-burial has dramatic point. In both stories the key word is 'equal', but Orwell's turns it upside down. 56 Max Frisch, 'Uber Marionetten', in Tagebuch 1946-1949 (Zurich, 1964), 154. 57 The Parisian craze for fables and literary contes de fees in the late 17th century coincided with one for marionettes (see Contes de Perrault, ed. Rouger, 293 n. 2). Perrault himself made the connection; dedicating 'Peau d'ine' he affirmed, 'Qu'en certains moments l'esprit le plus parfait I Peut aimer sans rougir jusqu'aux Marionettes'. (ibid. 57.) The most sensible Reason, he added, often wearied of its vigil and enjoyed dozing, ingeniously rocked by tales of Ogre and Fairy. 58 See Zipes, Fairy Tales and the Art of Subversion, 154-5. 59 See J.-D.

Was parody intended? In 1946 Orwell recognized, 'I am not able, and I do not want, completely to abandon the world-view that I acquired in childhood (i. 28). Magic tales, although escapist, were part of that world-view. In 1947, while contemplating a parody of 'Cinderella' and hoping for a re-broadcast of 'The Emperor's New Clothes', Orwell agreed to adapt 'Little Red Riding Hood' for the BBC's Children's Hour. Like Dickens, he would probably have resented the abuse of fairy tales for propaganda, which he detested.60 With his penchant for parody, he might well have regarded Animal Farm, once written, as a pastiche of left-wing children's literature. Whether he intended it as such is more conjectural. There is no evidence that he knew of Kay or Zur Miihlen, whose stories were not published in England. On the other hand, for an omnivorous reader with cosmopolitan left- wing contacts61 and a special interest in 'proletarian' literature and ephemeral writing-who had worked in 1934-5 in a Hampstead second-hand bookshop doing 'a good deal of business in children's books . . . rather horrible things' (i. 274),-nothing can be quite ruled out. In any case Orwell could have seen a mild strain of left-wing children's literature in the Cooperative Union's 'Cooperative Books for Young People': 'fairy plays' and stories envisaging factories where no worker was ever sacked owing to bad trade.62 In 1937, the 60 See P. Davison, ed. The Complete Works of George Orwell (London, 1998), viii. 116. According to George Woodcock, Orwell justified working for the BBC 'by contending that the right kind of man could at least make propaganda a little cleaner than it would otherwise have been . .. but he soon found there was in fact little he could do, and he left the BBC in disgust' (quoted in Crick, George Orwell, 418). (In Nineteen Eighty-Four Orwell named the Party's torture chamber, Room 101, after a BBC conference room.) For Orwell, a propagandist aimed not at truth but 'to do as much dirt on his opponent as possible' (iii. 262). Propaganda took 'just as much work as to write something you believe in, with the difference that the finished product is worthless (iii. 293). Yet he made one exception: 'I have always maintained that every artist is a propagandist. I don't mean a political propagandist. If he has any honesty or talent at all he cannot be that. Most political propaganda is a matter of telling lies, not only about the facts but about your own feelings. But every artist is a propagandist in the sense that he is trying, directly or indirectly, to impose a vision of life that seems to him desirable' (ii. 57). In Animal Farm Orwell does this by exposing the betrayal of such a vision. 61 Orwell contributed to Partisan Review from 1941 to 1946, and praised Dwight Macdonald's review Politics. By 1944 he had the New York address of Ruth Fischer (pseud. Elfriede Eisler, 1895-1961), the one-time General Secretary of the German Communist Party and author of Stalin and German Communism (iii. 334). Her hatred of Stalin-she never lost her admiration for Lenin-led her to denounce her brother Gerhart as an agent of the Comintern, and her other brother, the composer Hanns Eisler, as a communist 'in a philosophical sense' to the Un- American Activities Committee in 1947; this eventually led, in 1948, to Eisler's expulsion from the United States: E. Bentley (ed.), Thirty Years of Treason (London, 1971), 55 ff., 73. Among Orwell's papers in the British Library is a manuscript translation of a German socialist's eyewitness account of the fall of Berlin, other versions of which appeared in Fischer's newsletter 'The Network' (Nov.-Dec. 1945) and in Politics (Jan. 1946). Fischer visited Orwell on 17 June 1949 (iv. 565; confirmed to me by Peter Davison). 62 For example, J. R. Carling, Each for All: A Fairy Play in Three Scenes (1923); Winifred</page><page sequence="24">782 PAUL KIRSCHNER year in which Orwell said he first thought of Animal Farm, Gollancz's Left Book Club published both The Road to Wigan Pier and a left-wing children's book, The Adventures of the Little Pig and Other Stories by F. Le Gros and Ida Clark.63 Gollancz may have planted a seed.64 Orwell's political opinions were, besides, hardly original. Some had been inscribed in literary history by that versatile femme de lettres and nostalgic historian of rural manners George Sand during the revolution of 1848. Privately, Sand declared herself communist as people were Christian in the year 50 of our era. For me it is the ideal of advancing societies, the religion that will live a few centuries hence. Thus I cannot be tied by any of the present communist formulas, since all are rather dictatorial and think they can be set up without the aid of morals, habits and convictions. No religion is established by force. Publicly, she denounced elections organized in May 1848 against 'chimerical communists': If by communism you mean a conspiracy ready to try a grab for dictatorship ... we are not communists .... But if, by communism, you mean the desire and the will that, by all means lawful and admitted by the public conscience, the revolting inequality of extreme wealth and extreme poverty should hereby vanish to make way for the start of true equality, yes, we are communists and dare to tell you so.65 Like Orwell, she wanted a revolution preserving 'common decency'. Nor was Orwell alone on the left in condemning Russian communism. Whatever the seeds of Animal Farm they were encouraged to sprout by an anarchist pamphlet in his collection: The Russian Myth.66" Although George Young, Clouds and Sunshine: A Fairy Play (1922); L.

Some are in the British Library; others are in the Co-operative Union Library, Holyoake House, Hanover, Manchester, or appeared in its sales catalogue. 63 In the first two stories, a 'kindly robber' gives the little pig for Christmas a silver necklace stolen from a fat duchess. He tells the pig to give it to his mother, who complains she owes the farmer back rent: 'He's a cruel mean man. He does no work, and makes all the animals pay rent. The horse has to pay rent now for his stables and the fowls for their hen-house, and the cows for the cow-shed.' 'Good heavens,' said the little pig. 'But where do they get the money from?' His mother began to weep bitterly. 'It's very hard,' she said. 'The fowls have to take their eggs to market to raise the money and the cows have to take their milk and the horse has to carry loads to and fro for the neighbours.' (p. 28) 64 There were probably others. Trotsky's The Revolution Betrayed (1937) may have suggested the subject, and even an angle from which to treat it. Describing forced collectivization, Trotsky writes, 'But the most devastating hurricane hit the animal kingdom. The number of horses fell 55 per cent . . .' (p. 40). 65 Quoted in Andre Maurois, Lilia, ou la vie de George Sand (Verviers, Belgium, 1952), 372, 382 (my translation). 66 London: Freedom Press, 1941.</page><page sequence="25">THE DUAL PURPOSE OF ANIMAL FARM 783 Woodcock caught him out on the title, Orwell called it 'a terrific and very able anti-Soviet pamphlet' (ii. 210, 259). The cover read: To Communists and others, criticism of the Russian political and economic system is taboo. According to them, to criticise is to betray the 'Worker's State' and play into the hands of the capitalist class. But in this pamphlet we ask the question: is Russia a Socialist country?... If we define a Socialist State or Country as one in which inequality is abolished and where economic and political freedom exist, then it can be conclusively shown that none of these pre-requisites exist in Russia today. By clinging to their illusions; by looking to the Russian regime as the goal of the British workers; and by stubbornly refusing to face the facts, the Communist rank and file, however sincere they may be in their beliefs, are misleading the workers of this country. The Russian Myth anticipated the premise of Animal Farm: Bolshevist tactics wherever they are applied will always lead not to the emancipation of the workers from the chains which now enslave them, nor even to the dictatorship of the proletariat. They lead inevitably to the absolute or totalitarian state. By allowing power over the instruments of production to pass out of their own hands into those of a so-called revolutionary government, the workers will achieve not liberty but a slavery as bad or worse than that they sought to escape from.67 It distinguished true socialism from what the Bolsheviks had established: The propagandists of Marxism... urge State control of industry and agriculture as the aim of revolution. But Anarchists regards socialism as the emancipation of the workers from all the forces which fetter free development. ... To overthrow private capitalism only to enthrone State capitalism in its place will only appear progress to the blindest devotees of utopian gradualism.68 Three years earlier Orwell had asked, 'Is [Stalin's regime] Socialism, or is it a peculiarly vicious form of state-capitalism?' (i. 369). But he did not take the anarchist line that the call to defend the USSR 'made by the Communists, and echoed by Churchill and Roosevelt' was a call 'to defend the ruling clique in Russia': British and American imperialists have no interests in common with the soviet workers. .... The only way to aid the Russian workers is to fight unremittingly the class struggle here in England. Similarly, revolutionary struggle alone provides the only means of destroying German Nazism and Fascism. Only by fighting for the world revolution can the workers everywhere achieve freedom from poverty, tyranny and wars.. .69 In 1938 Orwell himself had called the slogan 'Guns before butter!' a dodge to deny wage rises: the workers' real enemies were 'those who try to trick them into identifying their interests with those of their exploiters, and into forgetting what every manual worker inwardly knows-that modern war is a racket' (i. 368). But when the bombs came he put first things first. By 1940 he was 'attacking pacifism for all [he] was worth' (ii. 34), and in 1941 he noted: 67 The Russian Myth, 26. 68 Ibid. 28-9. 69 Ibid. 30.</page><page sequence="26">784 PAUL KIRSCHNER 'The most interesting development of the anti-war front has been the interpretation [sic-a misprint for 'interpenetration': see Partisan Review, 8/1 (March-April 1941), 109] of the pacifist movement by Fascist ideas, especially antisemitism' (ii. 69). Orwell's moral force was his political independence: his denunciation, in windowpane-clear prose, of both private capitalism with its money-based class privilege and 'the shallow self-righteousness of the left-wing intelligentsia' (i. 587) holding up the train of the USSR's emperor's robes. Orwell's hatred of propaganda makes it all the more ironic that, within three years of his death, the CIA and the Foreign Office distributed doctored versions of his master- piece. A cartoon film vetted by the CIA's Psychological Strategy Board suppressed the closing parallel between capitalist and porcine exploitation. In the CIA's happy ending a counter-revolution deposed the pigs.70 The Foreign Office circulated a comic strip in which Old Major resembled Lenin.71 That Orwell should have had his purpose tampered with in the name of the 'free world' to shield a system for which he saw 'manifestly no future' (iv. 429) is, of course, disgusting. Yet Animal Farm only half fulfilled that purpose, since the pathos of the failure of a specific revolution implies a general statement about the impossibility of any revolution. This derives not from latent conservatism or a sour change of political colours,72 but from the very literary form that makes Animal Farm what Edmund Wilson once called 'long- range literature'. Preserving 'the symmetry of the story' meant synopsizing the oppression of the animals parodically and focusing on betrayal of their hopes after the Rebellion. Hence the final metamorphosis of the pigs may be read as just a parting shot at them, not necessarily as a backhander at capitalism as well. A serious account of hardships before the Rebellion, while still main- taining the link between organizing intelligence and ravenous power-hunger, would merely have divided the interest. But if, as the parable suggests, the alternative to private capitalism is 'Animalism', then better the devil you know. Orwell's conviction that capitalism was deservedly doomed was occulted by 70 See F. S. Saunders, Who Paid the Piper? The CIA and the Cultural Cold War (London, 1999), 293-5. Saunders remarks, 'Curiously, the critique of America's intelligence bureaucrats echoed the earlier concerns of T. S. Eliot and William Empson, both of whom had written to Orwell in 1944 [sic] to point out faults or inconsistencies in the central parable of Animal Farm.' Orwell's own 1946 BBC version keeps the last line and praise of more work for less food. Frederic is gone, and 'Farmer 1', who drops his aitches while Napoleon speaks like a gentleman, replaces Pilkington, thus audibly confusing pigs and humans: see P. Davison, The Complete Works of George Orwell, viii. 192. 71 See Guardian, 17 Mar. 1998, p. 7. 72 Three months after the publication of Animal Farm Orwell snubbed an invitation to speak on Yugoslavia for the League of European Freedom because it was 'an essentially Conservative body which claims to defend democracy in Europe but has nothing to say about British imperialism'. He explained: 'I belong to the Left and must work inside it, much as I hate Russian totalitarianism and its poisonous influence in this country' (iv. 49). Simon Leys deplores 'the persistent stupidity of a Left that, instead of at last beginning to read and understand [Orwell] had scandalously permitted the confiscation of its most powerful writer': Orwell, ou l'horreur de la politique (Paris, 1984), 46 (my translation).</page><page sequence="27">THE DUAL PURPOSE OF ANIMAL FARM 785 the design of Animal Farm, which, while raising it to the level of moral satire, simultaneously made it near-perfect material for propagandists of the status quo. If literary form hindered Orwell's political purpose, it also confirmed the existence of literature stripped of theories. In declaring that he had no fear of a dictatorship of the proletariat but a 'perfect horror of a dictatorship of theorists' Orwell affirmed his faith both in the moral code of ordinary people and in literature. If the dominant theorists of his day have withered, others now proliferate. They suggest that, since words do not perfectly represent reality, they can mean whatever you choose, with the corollary that searching for objective truth (and backing arguments by evidence) is pointless. The only criterion of truth becomes power, with carte blanche to anyone who can wield it. Others theorize that, since reading and writing are conditioned by sex, critical standards should differ for male and female authors. Imagination, once used to transcend sexual barriers, is expected to raise them. In the political and economic sphere, theorists proclaim that civilization has reached its ultimate perfection in unfettered capitalism, as Hegel thought it had in the state, while others 'deconstruct' literature into an expression of Western racism and imperialism. The fairy tale is again a battlefield for political, sociological, and psychological theorists" heedless of the grim admission by a famous political exile whom Orwell read with interest: 'Theory is not a note which you can present at any moment to reality for payment.'" Along with the stifling effect of totalitarianism on literature (ii. 163, iv. 88) one of Orwell's bugbears was the 'invasion of literature by politics' (iv. 464). Socialists had no monopoly of mental dishonesty. Rather, acceptance of any political discipline seems to be incompatible with literary integrity. This applies equally to movements like Pacifism and Personalism, which claim to be 73 See Zipes, Fairy Tales and the Art ofSubversion, 60 ff., 179 ff. Zur Mtihlen was rediscovered in Germany in the 1960s, starting a wave of 'counter-cultural' children's tales advocating collective control by workers of their labour. England and the United States preferred feminist fairy tales. Zipes, who has edited a volume of them (Don't Bet on the Prince (London, 1986)), welcomes the 'upsetting' effect of making Cinderella rebellious, or having Snow White organizing a band of robbers. Mercifully, however, he grants that 'it is extremely difficult to determine exactly what a child will absorb on an unconscious level' (Fairy Tales and the Art of Subversion, 191, 57). Orwell himself has drawn feminist fire, the charge being 'not that he treated women badly but that he portrayed them badly. In his novels, the female characters (including the mare in Animal Farm) are sketchy or vapid' (D. Honigmann, Financial Times, 1-2 June 2000, 'Weekend' section, p. v). If Comrade Orwell wronged Feminist Woman, feminists might recall Eileen Blair's part in Animal Farm. Eileen told how, unprecedentedly, her husband would read his day's work to her and welcome her criticisms and suggestions (Crick, George Orwell, 451). Her friends attributed the humour in the book to her influence (Shelden, The Authorised Biography, 408), and Orwell said that she had helped in planning it (iv. 131). Significantly, he asked her advice, perhaps to help him capture what he called in a broadcast 'the atmosphere of childhood' (The Lost Writings, ed. West, 88). She may deserve credit for the tone of the book, including such humorous touches as the mare's frivolous vanity. 74 The Revolution Betrayed, 109.</page><page sequence="28">786 PAUL KIRSCHNER outside the ordinary political struggle. Indeed, the mere sound of words ending in -ism seems to bring the smell of propaganda. Group loyalties are necessary, and yet they are poisonous to literature, so long as literature is the product of individuals. (iv. 468) Since both left and right have tried to annex Animal Farm, it is time literature put in its claim. Totalitarianism may seem less of a threat than in Orwell's day, but with a firm called 'Narration, Ltd' recruiting authors to write propaganda novels 'sponsored' by governments and companies,75 the literary nature of Animal Farm needs affirming. Its political ambiguities are irresolvable, but its universal moral satire emerges more strongly as the USSR fades from memory. In China, where the Communist Party has pragmatically equated private entrepreneurs with workers as a 'productive force' in an effort to broaden its sociological base (as Orwell told socialists to do in The Road to Wigan Pier), Animal Farm is unlikely to be taken either as a redundant attack on a defunct USSR or as an endorsement of a capitalist status quo, but simply as a warning against power-seekers wielding the jargon of theory to establish tyranny.76 To Orwell, who defined a real socialist as 'one who wishes . . . to see tyranny overthrown',77 this would have seemed a good symptom. In our theory-bemused West, however, the contradictions of Animal Farm may best be circumvented by reading it as literary counter-parody in the perennial struggle for the power to enchant. In his pastiche of a left-wing 'fairy story', Orwell fused artistic and political purpose to chase a twentieth-century Whole Hog out of the flower garden of children's literature. Geneva 75 Independent on Sunday, 1 Sept. 2002, p. 10. 76 The director-adapter Shang Chengjun was necessarily more diplomatic. His play opened near the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, where the Communist Party had just elected its new leaders with all the rigid conformism of Animal Farm. Mr Shang knew they might stop his play, but his comment was apt: 'Many people read the book narrow-mindedly ... Sure, [it] satirises the Soviet Union, but I think the phenomenon it describes suits every society and era. I don't want to make a judgment in this play-whether socialism or capitalism is good or not. What I want to express is that no matter which society people are in, if they want to be their own masters they have responsibilities and duties. If they are indifferent, lazy and don't want to vote, any social system will fail' (Financial Times, 16/17 Nov. 2002, p. 3). In Orwell's words, the people must know when to chuck out their leaders-but what if they lose faith in the efficacy of voting? 77 The Road to Wigan Pier (Harmondsworth, 1963), 194.</page></plain_text>
