<plain_text><page sequence="1">Systematics and Plant Population Biology' PETER H. RAVEN2 Abstract. A review of the current status of plant systematics at the population level indicates that confusion between the construction of a general-purpose classification and the observation of particular ge- netic, evolutionary or ecological features about plant populations has been severe and has tended to retard progress in these fields. The role of hybridization as an important feature of the adaptive system in what seems likely to be a majority of all plant genera has been underestimated seriously, partly because of the emphasis on the construction of a classifi- cation system with neatly delineated pigeonholes within which all popu- lations can be accommodated. Saltational speciation, with its emphasis on the differentiation of marginal populations, appears to be an impor- tant process in the evolution of many plant and animal groups. Gene flow in all plant groups that have been investigated is extremely local, and effective population size is therefore small to very small; thus, gene flow could not keep together populations of plants as the kinds of units recognized as species in the face of selection, and alternative explana- tions for the existence of the kinds of units recognized as species in nature must be formulated. The nature of species is so variable that their use in various kinds of models in population biology may not always be justified. The infusion of ecological insights into plant systematics, primarily a phenomenon of the last half of our century, is providing not only a rationale for many poorly understood character complexes in plants but also a cornerstone for the growing integrated field of plant population biology. Finally, the rapid destruction of the tropical forests, which will be essentially complete within 40 years, makes the formulation of the right sorts of nontaxonomic questions to ask in the tropics and the provision of sufficient funds to allow them to be asked a matter of extreme urgency. Systematists provide the system of classification that forms a basis for the organization of information of all kinds about plants and animals. As em- phasized below, however, a system of classification cannot be set up that reflects data of all kinds with equal fidelity. To a great extent, an historical overemphasis on the classifications that result from their studies has caused plant systematists to misconstrue or neglect altogether important aspects of plant population biology. If the main purpose of a series of investigations is to detect more or less discrete units in nature that can be given names, it is often true that very little else is accomplished, and much useful informa- 1 Supported by a series of grants from the National Science Foundation.

If the main purpose is the dis- covery of evolutionary, genetic, or ecological principles that govern the dynamics of plant populations, it then stands to reason that a more direct approach to these phenomena, one not primarily directed to the construc- tion of a classification, would be more fruitful. Plant systematics in the 1970's seems to have matured to the point at which it is generally under- stood that taxonomy provides a general-purpose classification, incorporating and summing up characters of many different kinds, which can serve as a sort of framework for the investigation of the biology of plant populations, but which should not be rebuilt every time a new special set of characteris- tics becomes available. There is no one "true" classification. Despite their preoccupation with delineating units in nature, systematists have been among the principal contributors to our understanding of the genetics, evolution, and ecology of plant populations. Many systematists will continue to study the full gamut of phenomena concerning the dynam- ics of populations, but it is now clear that it is important to separate con- ceptually the construction of general-purpose classifications from many other kinds of specific studies, even though the results of these studies may provide information useful for the construction of classifications. In the first section of this paper, I shall attempt to review why this is so; sub- sequently, I shall discuss the role of hybridization in plant populations, saltational speciation, the structure of populations, and the adaptive role of certain characters of plants. In this way I hope to convey my understand- ing of how plant systematics and an improved understanding of the many features of plant populations that have traditionally been the concern of plant systematists will contribute to the growing integrated discipline of plant population biology. THE NATURE OF SPECIES The classification of plants and animals is a fundamental human activity, and the properties common to folk classifications are now fairly well under- stood (Raven, et al., 1971). As Mayr (1942) has rightly pointed out, there were few difficulties with the recognition of discrete natural units when classifications were primarily local. The beginnings of the Age of Enlighten- ment, however, in the late seventeenth century in England, led to a desire to enlarge classifications to include all organisms, a tendency that was extended and elaborated by the French encyclopedists of the eighteenth century and, for that matter by Linnaeus himself, who believed, however, that there would be fewer than 50,000 species in the entire world. Although the genus is the fundamental unit of folk classifications (Raven et al., 1971), and was stabilized in its current usage for plants by Tournefort at the end of the seventeenth century, a preoccupation with the nature of species has characterized systematic botany for the past three centuries. The species was cast in its modern mold by John Ray (1686), who wrote "nulla certior occurit quam distincta propagatione ex semina"-in other</page><page sequence="3">286 SYSTEMATIC BOTANY [Volume 1 words, a species should breed true from seed, and if more than one occurred in the progeny of a single individual, they should be regarded as synony- mous. This was really the beginning of "population thinking," and it should perhaps not surprise us that it was devised by Ray, who travelled widely in continental Europe as well as in the British Isles and thereby came to know more species of plants than any of his predecessors. With variations at times, botanists have held much the same notion of what should be regarded as species ever since. Various definitions have been attempted. Lindley (1830) wrote, "A species is an assemblage of in- dividuals agreeing with each other in all essential characters of vegetation and fructification capable of reproduction by seed without change, breed- ing freely together and producing perfect seed from which progeny can be reared. Such are the true limits of a species." Herbert (1837) made it clear that the general opinion in his day was that if two entities produced fertile offspring they were to be regarded as conspecific. Herbert himself thought that the ability to hybridize, regardless of whether the hybrids were fertile or sterile, indicated that the two entities should be assigned to the same genus, but not necessarily to the same species. (For a modern evaluation of intergeneric hybridization in flowering plants, see Knobloch, 1972.) Herbert realized that if all interfertile entities were merged, a great many perfectly distinct species, judged on other criteria, would be merged. At about the same time, Gartner (1849), who made hundreds of interspecific crosses in plants, devised an "index of affinity," which he defined as the proportion of seeds produced in an interspecific cross to that produced in an intraspecific cross, and thus began the sorts of studies that are often termed biosystematic in our day. Thus when the "new Darwinism" was forged in the first half of the present century, it had been preceded by about 250 years of thought and experimentation on the nature of variation in plant populations, and a considerable body of information was available, starting with the results of Kolreuter (1761). The kind of understanding of the evolutionary processes achieved in such a masterful fashion by Dobzhansky (1935, 1937) led to unfortunate attempts to "define" species and thus to the so-called "bio- logical species definitions," although these have had a relatively limited influence in botany, owing to the ease with which their premises can be tested in plants and thus be shown to be of little utility. An outstanding analysis of the strictly limited applicability of the biological species concept to plants was that of Grant (1957), who assumed that these concepts were much more applicable to vertebrates. Further analysis has suggested that the concept is of limited applicability to any group of organisms (e.g., Ehrlich Sc Raven, 1969; Sokal gc Crovello, 1970). One can still find experimentally unfounded and misleading statements in the botanical literature based on an implicit or even explicit acceptance of such "definitions." For example, in their extremely useful and instruc- tive monograph of the cytogenetics of Avena, Rajhathy and Thomas (1974,</page><page sequence="4">1976] RAVEN: SYSTEMATICS AND PLANT POPULATION BIOLOGY 287 p. 65) state that "every biological species represents a single gene pool, some of which consist of several taxonomic species." To assume that the units that they consider biological species (on internal morphological consistency and crossibility between morphologically distinct units) are internally inter- fertile or otherwise share in the properties that have been adduced for "biological" species is only to conceal the facts, to mislead, and to make a comprehensive understanding of the oats or an appropriate breeding pro- gram for them less attainable than it would have been if this unit of clas- sification had not been introduced. A critical evaluation of the concept has been provided by Sokal and Crovello (1970), who agree with Davis and Heywood (1963) as to the nonoperational character of the term "potential" in all such definitions. For animals, Mayr (1940, 1942, 1965) defined species as "groups of actually or potentially interbreeding natural populations, which are repro- ductively isolated from other such groups." These definitions received much acceptance among zoologists, but have been tested only to a limited extent (cf. Ehrlich gc Raven, 1969). As Van Valen (1976) has emphasized, one will normally find the kind of units in nature that one expects to find. At about the same time that Mayr put forward his definition, a number of proposals were made for the replacement of the orthodox or classical treatment of plant species by experimental approaches. These included experimental taxonomy (Gregor, 1938; Clausen et al., 1940), the new systematics (Huxley, 1940), biosystematics (as "biosystematy," Camp gc Gilly, 1943), and genonomy (Epling, 1943). Clausen et al. (1939, 1940) proposed experimental definitions of taxonomic categories that they thought should replace the classical ones, but these definitions have not prevailed for a vari- ety of theoretical and practical reasons. As Keck (1957) himself later put it, "If a classification should have to depend upon the results of experiments in an experimental garden, it would prove to be intolerably cumbersome and would be summarily rejected." The kinds of difficulties he foresaw are exemplified by the situation in the taxonomic species Gilia inconspicua (Smith) Sweet and discussed by Grant (1964). The notion of using only internal barriers for species distinctions (Clausen et al., 1939), has been accepted by very few systematists, and was soon explicitly rejected by bota- nists such as Babcock (1947), Gates (1951), and others. By 1950, when Stebbins published his "Variation and Evolution in Plants," it had become clear that "descriptive taxonomy of the traditional sort" provided the most useful basis for evolutionary studies (Stebbins, 1950, p. 7; Clausen, 1951). Stebbins put the emphasis squarely on the in- vestigation of as many characteristics as possible and the pursuit of evolu- tionary studies for their own sake. He agreed with the great majority of botanists since the time of John Ray in recognizing species of morphological- geographical (ecological) units between which discontinuities exist in nature (cf. also Du Rietz, 1930). Concerning "biological" species, Stebbins (1950, p. 204) wrote that "the principal task of the experimental taxonomist should</page><page sequence="5">288 SYSTEMATIC BOTANY [Volume 1 be to study these situations and to spend as little time as possible discussing the definition of terms." Nevertheless, the period 1935-1960 in particular was marked by a "conflict of categories" (Heslop-Harrison, 1955) in which some workers attempted to substitute experimental criteria for morpho- logical-ecological ones in plant classification, and we are not yet completely free of the effects of this confusing and naive effort (Bennett, 1964). As Mason (1959) correctly stated, species, like other taxonomic cate- gories, are "definable universally only in the language of formal relations and not by the property of organisms." We should attempt to describe and understand the factors that underlie discontinuities in nature but must avoid the pitfall of confusing explanation with description. Classifications can always be modified in the light of additional information, whether this information be experimental or not; but correlations are necessary for a useful general-purpose taxonomy, one which best expresses relationships (Lewis, 1953; Mason, 1950; Davis gc Heywood, 1963). In an outstanding discussion of the nature of species in plants, Davis and Heywood (1963, especially pp. 89-98) make it clear that absolute experimental definitions of "species" are impossible. Taxonomy, a branch of classification in general, is continually being improved with the addition of information-Constance's (1964) "unending synthesis"-but a particular classification can never be experimentally verifiable, in logical terms, even though the facts involved in it can of course be tested. Johnson (1968) presented the arguments concerning this point very cogently. Turrill (1935, 1938a) early presented the concept of the continual incorporation of new kinds of information into the basic scheme of classification in his discussion of "alpha" and "omega" taxonomy (see also Johnson, 1968). Camp (1951) presented a similar point of view, but he also predicted that the traditional taxonomic categories would be replaced by others more precisely defined. The relative lack of utility of "special-purpose" classifications, in view of the limited number of characteristics that they reflect, was discussed early by Turrill (1938). In the construction of classification systems, or classifications for particu- lar groups, the systematist tends to search for relatively easily discernible but information-rich characters (Stafleu, 1969). This leads inevitably to his ignoring many other features that may be of crucial importance for evolutionary studies, as stressed by Stebbins (1950), but these often cannot be accommodated in a relatively simple classification scheme (Lewis, 1963). Data on these characters can now easily be stored and retrieved with com- puters and should be made available if determined. Useful methods have been developed by the numerical taxonomists for the evaluation of relation- ships to as precise a degree as may be desired. Most taxonomists do not utilize these methods, however, and they may even actively mistrust them, preferring to use only a few characters and intuition for their classifications. Realistically, in view of the very limited knowledge we have of all but a very few kinds of organisms (less than 1% perhaps), and the several million</page><page sequence="6">1976] RAVEN: SYSTEMATICS AND PLANT POPULATION BIOLOGY 289 which have not even been named, it is probably adequate in many cases at least to base general-purpose taxonomies on only a few well selected characteristics, in much the style with which Linnaeus employed sexual features to the classification of flowering plants, and with a reasonable expectation of information retrieval. The methods of numerical taxonomy will probably never be used for the classification of more than a few kinds of organisms, simply because, although the systematist believes he is order- ing the organisms he is classifying by degree of relationships, he actually does not need, in the vast majority of cases, to specify these relationships so precisely (Raven, 1974). In fact, for the general purposes of taxonomy, the accumulation of ad- ditional information may actually be more confusing than helpful in the production of a scheme of classification (cf. Ornduff, 1969b). There is apt to be a great overemphasis on the importance of newly discovered charac- teristics-such as cytogenetics in the 1940's and 1950's-particularly if they are nonvisual and add new insight, and consequently further distortion of the overall scheme of classification sometimes results. On the other hand, there are many important biological questions that can be answered only with the aid of mathematical analysis. These include, among many others, the degree of congruence between different sets of characters derived from the same organisms, which is of great evolutionary relevance, the average degree of difference between taxa in different groups, and the precise specification of niche. One may confidently predict that the major application of numerical taxonomic methods in the future will be outside the area of taxonomy. Experimental taxonomy, or biosystematics, on the other hand, is devoted to a study of evolution at the population level-population biology in the sense of Ehrlich and Holm (1962). It is likely that the term "biosystematics" has been used in so many different ways and with so many varying implica- tions (e.g., Stafleu, 1969) that it has outlived its usefulness (Johnson, 1970). A clearer recognition of the differing roles of taxonomy or system- atics and evolutionary/ecological studies as a branch of population biology, as advocated by Stebbins (1950, 1970), Davis and Heywood (1963), and many others, would be more conducive to further progress. For this reason, I disagree with the integration of classical and biosystem- atic approaches advocated by Merxmiiller (1970), since this will lead to a distortion of the aims and a lessening of the worth of the final product in both fields. Although systematists often study the genetic factors involved in the maintenance of species, these play no necessary role in classification (Davis gc Heywood, 1963, p. 417), and to overemphasize the construction of classifications as a result of such studies is often to ignore significant events at the population level (Ornduff, 1969b). Indeed, the preoccupation with classification and the recognition of taxonomic units may often tend to conceal the facts upon which such classifications are based, which are often discarded or left unpublished once a particular circumscription is accepted.</page><page sequence="7">290 SYSTEMATIC BOTANY [Volume 1 Since there is no universal definition of species or of any other taxonomic category, the taxonomy itself allows us to predict very little about the units classified at this level, which are in any case extremely diverse (Camp &amp;c Gilly, 1943; Valentine gc Love, 1958: Lewis, 1959; Vent, 1974), even though we may have a kind of false assurance that they share a number of biological properties in common. Merxmuiller (1970) has commented that it is strange that it is avowed students of evolution who insist on the "biological" species definitions, when they are just the ones who should know better. This is exactly why the acceptance of the "biological species" concept in the sense of Mayr (1965) or Dobzhansky (1972) is so apt to lead to a loss of information and a distortion of our perception of populations in nature, and why the point of view expressed by Stebbins (1950), Heslop-Harrison (1953), and others is operationally so much more sound: an investigation of the properties of populations, including their microevolution, using orthodox taxonomy as a basis. Heslop-Harrison (1953, p. 122) pointed out that the production of classifications is not a pyoper part of the aim of evolutionary or genetic investigation. Gregor (1947, p. 390) wrote that "the need at the moment is to overcome the almost subconscious desire to resolve infra-specific varia- tion into categories capable of being absorbed into the orthodox taxonomic system" and concluded that the results from genecological studies were best presented for their own sake rather than integrated into the basic general- purpose classification of biology. The attempt to make evolutionary studies yield results that could be presented in a rigid classification scheme is pre- cisely what led to the crisis in biosystematics in the 1950's and 1960's; the attempt was futile. Classical taxonomy has often been condemned by the advocates of the "biological" species concept as typological, but in fact it is no more and no less so than the application of any other category, be it gamodeme or eco- type, to natural variation (Ornduff, 1969b). Taxonomists focus their at- tention on herbarium specimens and types when they are forced to do so by a shortage of information, and not by choice. As Merxmiiller (1970) put it: "A conservative who today would try to work on insufficient ma- terials only, soon would be a laughingstock." Blackwelder (1964, p. 19) stated the same idea in different words: "All good classifications were and are based on all available data." In 1950 Stebbins clearly felt that the definition of species eventually might be improved to the point where it would be truly experimental, but this no longer appears to be a possi- bility. We can, however, discuss the sorts of patterns in nature that a majority of taxonomists would wish to recognize as species (Darlington, 1932, p. 481), as done for example by Du Rietz (1930) and exceptionally well by Davis and Heywood (1963). For about 300 years the classification and naming of ever-increasing numbers of kinds of organisms has provided a motive for biologists to discover new facts about these organisms; the pity is that so much information has been lost in the process. In our day, with</page><page sequence="8">1976] RAVEN: SYSTEMATICS AND PLANT POPULATION BIOLOGY 291 modern electronic data storage, this no longer need be the case, however. S. T. Cowan (1962) has written, "Just as no two observers see the same rain- bow, so no two biologists conceive exactly the same species." The facts that lead to the recognition of the species, however, are the same for everyone. In fact, there is a generally acceptable point of view about the kinds of morphological-ecological discontinuities that should separate species, and of .their existence in nature (cf. Rollins, 1952). Ultimately, it is based on what Cockayne and Allan (1927) called a "natural" or "field" taxonomy: what sorts of units are actually present in nature? A more recent expression of this point of view has been Mayr's (1942) very useful discrimination between allopatric and sympatric species, with the maintenance of morpho- logically distinct units growing together being taken as a biological fact of high importance. Among sedentary organisms, the application of these terms is of course more difficult (Mayr, 1947). What I am advocating is the use of the phenetic species concept of Sokal and Crovello (1970), which has in fact been traditional in botany in any case (Davis &amp;c Heywood, 1963). Plants tend to fall into two groups with respect to their population struc- ture (Stebbins, 1959a; Grant, 1958, 1971; Ehrendorfer, 1970; Burger, 1975; Raven, 1977). On the one hand, there are trees, shrubs, and many peren- nials, among which internal barriers to hybridization are often poorly developed or lacking altogether. Many of these are K-strategists that de- vote a relatively low proportion of their basic resources to reproduction (Gadgil gc Solbrig, 1972). They are separated by ecological, geographical, seasonal, and other factors but retain the ability to hybridize and produce novel recombinants to answer the needs of a changing environment (Steb- bins, 1950, 1959a, 1969b; Anderson &amp;c Stebbins, 1954; Raven, 1960, 1962). As Epling (1947) suggested, the ability to hybridize, rather than its limita- tion, may actually be selected for in such plants; we shall return to this subject below. In due course, it will be of great interest to make more exact comparisons between the degree of K- and r-selection characteristic of a particular group (e.g., Wilbur, 1976; Grubb, 1976) and the degree of hybridization (or gene flow) characteristic of that group. These compari- sons may eventually prove fruitful even within species, as suggested by Gadgil and Solbrig (1972) and emended by Hickman (1975). The second sort of population structure among the higher plants is what Stebbins (1950, p. 234) termed the "normal" sort; mainly annual herbs, in which internal barriers to hybridization often characterize the species, and are somewhat correlated with morphological distance between them. These are, relatively speaking, r-strategists (Gadgil gc Solbrig, 1972). As further studies have been conducted in such groups, barriers to hybridiza- tion have often been found to characterize populations also (Ornduff, 1969a). Gottlieb's (1971, especially Table 3) studies of hybrids within and between the diploid species of Stephanomeria provide an elegant example of the series of levels of interfertility that will be found to characterize many</page><page sequence="9">292 SYSTEMATIC BOTANY [Volume 1 groups when sufficient hybrids have been made. Mosquin's (1966) studies of Clarkia rhomboidea Douglas provide another excellent example, and in the annual tarweed genus Holocarpha (Clausen, 1951) even interpopula- tional crosses were intersterile. Obviously in annual and short-lived peren- nial herbs, with their much faster turnover, the presence of barriers to hybridization is a sine qua non for sympatric occurrence (Stebbins, 1950), and polyploidy is more frequent in such plants (Grant, 1956); in long-lived plants, for which replacement may occur much more slowly, and the re- cruitment of individuals into the populations may be much more highly selective, barriers to hybridization may actually be disadvantageous in the long run. Levin (1971) made the point that barriers to hybridization will, in any case, be recognized only if two differentiated populations come into contact in nature or are brought together in the experimental garden; until then, they are only characteristics of populations and potential barriers. Different characteristics are associated with the units recognized as species in different groups of plants. If we wish to limit the degree to which we are slaves to the erection, of a system of classification, and to learn more about the properties of populations, we must explicitly recognize this and jealously guard the facts that we learn about them. The confusion of microevolutionary studies with systematics during the past 40 years has tended to limit the former, with only a theoretical advantage to the latter in many cases. The same sort of reasoning applied below the level of species leads to the conclusion that only one sort of taxon, the subspecies, is adequate to express with as much precision as is possible in a formal system the kinds of relationships that occur at that level (Stebbins, 1950; Valentine &amp; Love, 1958). In concluding this section, I must re-emphasize the difficulties that the reaffirmation of the traditional (and only possible) usage of the term "species" poses for population genetics and ecology (Camp, 1951; Gilmour, 1951; cf. also Van Valen, 1976). If a "biological" species concept could be accepted, then it would be possible to view species as biological units of a sort that can be precisely defined, incorporated in models, and given a sort of equivalence. Although convenient, this view is biologically naive in the extreme. The kinds of evolutionary situations that gave rise to some 700 species of Drosophilidae in the Hawaiian Islands are not like those that have produced or that maintain the roughly 450 species of Quercus, or 40 species of Clarkia, let alone the continental species of Drosophilidae, and only with this explicit reservation can the morphological-ecological units involved be compared in a productive way. Studies of plant population biology in the future, to be maximally pro- ductive, must avoid slavish adherence to the construction of classifications, whether these are traditional or "biosystematic," and must emphasize above all the properties of the populations themselves, as experimentally deter- mined (cf. Sokal gc Crovello, 1970; Heywood, 1974). Whether the units concerned are species, ecotypes (Ornduff, 1969b, p. 111), or "cytodemes"</page><page sequence="10">1976] RAVEN: SYSTEMATICS AND PLANT POPULATION BIOLOGY 293 (Harberd, 1976; Heywood, 1976, p. 337-338), their recognition is apt to lead to a serious loss of information and a restriction of the possibility for further generalization. No one character (e.g., chromosome number: Love, 1962; Heywood, 1962) should be overemphasized at the cost of all others. It would be best for the progress of population biology if the concept "biological species" were abandoned and emphasis was placed squarely on processes occurring in natural populations (Stebbins, 1950; Epling Sc Catlin, 1950; Ehrlich S Holm, 1962; Merxmiiller, 1962; Bennett, 1964; Sokal Sc Crovello, 1970; Bocher, 1970; Raven, 1974; Heywood, 1974). The tax- onomic viewpoint is a highly biased one for the study of plant population biology: the recognition of units is made too important. A general clas- sification, incorporating as many features as possible, will provide the most useful framework for studies of all kinds (Turrill, 1938b; Stebbins, 1950; Davis Sc Heywood, 1963). THE EVOLUTIONARY SIGNIFICANCE OF HYBRIDIZATION It is ironic that our desire to classify so as to understand and to communi- cate has greatly limited ou'r understanding of plant populations. Constance (1951) pointed out that it is not considered fashionable to leave any prob- lems at the conclusion of a taxonomic study-to do so is to be judged less competent by one's peers regardless of the biological facts of the situation being studied. The taxonomist's desire to place all organic diversity into convenient pigeonholes long concealed the widespread occurrence of natural hybridization in plants; until no more than 40 years ago, it was commonly assumed that a more critical analysis would eliminate the suspected hybrids by classifying them correctly. Just how remarkable it was that the leading botanists of nineteenth-century Britain, for example, considered hybrids to be extremely rare in nature, if present at all, is demonstrated by recent studies of hybrids in the British flora (Stace, 1975a,b). In a flora of about 2200 species, at least 850 interspecific hybrid combinations are now known! The studies of Cockayne and Allan (summary, 1934), who found plant hybrids abundant in New Zealand, especially following forest fires and clearing, were so well documented that they, for a time, led to the sup- position that hybridization was more common in New Zealand than else- where. In a similar way, the suggestion of Briggs and Walters (1969), that hybridization and introgression are more common in the North American flora than in the European owing to the more recent disturbance of the former by man, appears to lack substance; there were simply more critical, and earlier, studies of these phenomena in North America than anywhere else. The studies of Edgar Anderson (1948, 1949, 1953) helped to increase interest in hybridization between plant species. At about the same time, Carl Epling (1947) suggested that the ability to hybridize and the con- sequent possibility for transspecific recombination might actually be advan- tageous to certain plant groups. In 1950, however, Stebbins still found the presence of strong interspecific barriers to hybridization to be the "normal" situation in plants, while providing abundant evidence to the contrary.</page><page sequence="11">294 SYSTEMATIC BOTANY [Volume 1 There still appears to be some sort of notion, perhaps fostered by the dogmas of zoological systematics, that hybrids are in some sense unimportant or undesirable deviations from the mainstream of evolution (cf. Wagner, 1970, p. 149). In a most interesting paper on the species concept in Quercus, Burger (1975) implicitly shares this view by discussing the oaks as if they were a very peculiar group because of their frequent production of hybrids. In fact, I believe this situation to be the prevalent one among flowering plants as a whole, as mentioned above. In Crassulaceae, for example, Uhl (1976) pointed out that most species hybridize readily, regardless of chromo- some number, and that some 165 species of four genera may be considered a single "comparium" biosystematically. Another situation of this sort has been reported in Aster (Avers, 1957). In considering these examples, it should be borne in mind that the presence of intermediates between two distinctive series of populations need not mean that differences between these are breaking down. The dif- ferentiation of plant populations occurs in response to the demands of the environment, and there are various possible explanations for such a situa- tion. In Arctostaphylos (Gottlieb, 1968), Ceanothus (Nobs, 1963), and Quercus (Tucker, 1952; Benson et al., 1967), as well as a number of other groups, the amount and character of the hybrids has been correlated directly with the habitat, hardly a surprising conclusion in view of the abundant evidence on ecotypic differentiation in plants. Also pertinent here is the concept of "compilospecies" such as Poa pratensis Linnaeus or Quercus alba Linnaeus which, while maintaining sufficient morphological and ecological consistency to continue to be recognized as a single species, achieve wide ranges by incorporating genetic material from other species with which they come into contact (Harlan gc de Wet, 1963; Clausen gc Hiesey, 1958; Hardin, 1975). In a number of groups, segregation has been shown to produce inter- sterile or ecologically differentiated derivative populations at the diploid level, both experimentally and in the field (Grant, 1958; Stebbins, 1959b, 1969a; Gottlieb, 1971). Lasthenia burkei (Greene) Greene provides a use- ful example of the apparent origin of a species by such a process, involving rather limited genetic differentiation (Ornduff, 1969c, 1976). In Elymus glaucus Buckley (Snyder, 1950, 1951; Stebbins, 1957), introgression from the related genus Sitanion appears to have provided at least part of the basis for the segregation of genetically isolated populations. In many instances, hybrids are more variable than either parent, and they often go beyond the limits of their parents in particular features (Steb- bins, 1969a). A particularly good example is that provided by the F2 gen- eration of the cross Linanthus androsaceus (Bentham) Greene x L. bicolor (Nuttall) Greene, in which plants with numbers of corolla lobes different from the five in each parent are frequent (Huether, 1966, 1968). Similarly, Clausen and Hiesey (1958) found that about half of the F2 progeny from the intersubspecific hybrid Potentilla glandulosa Lindley ssp. nevadensis</page><page sequence="12">1976] RAVEN: SYSTEMATICS AND PLANT POPULATION BIOLOGY 295 (Watson) Keck x ssp. ref lexa (Greene) Keck exceeded the performance of both parents at at least one of their transplant stations. Vickery (1972) demonstrated transgressive segregation in physiological features for inter- populational hybrids in Mimulus guttatus De Candolle. There are nu- merous other examples showing that hybridization in plants does provide an ample supply of variability on which natural selection may act (Levin, 1970b). Most experimental studies of plant populations have been carried out on the herbaceous groups of temperate regions-the very groups in which bar- riers to hybridization are most pronounced. In my opinion, the suggestion of Ehrendorfer (1970) that tropical woody plants may not form hybridizing complexes is highly unlikely, particularly in view of the great instability of tropical vegetation in the past million years; the point certainly needs investigation in the field in the tropics and in the southern hemisphere also (Raven, 1974). At any event, the sort of situation so beautifully documented by Nobs (1963) for Ceanothus sect. Cerastes, in which interfertile but morphologically/ecologically distinct species recombine in a kaleidoscopic fashion in response to the demands of a changing environment will, I be- lieve, prove to be the predominant one among angiosperms when more areas of the world are studied in this respect. Grant (1953) has proposed the term "homogamic complex" for such groups. On islands, or other areas with a restricted number of taxa evolving, the ability to hybridize may be especially important, as suggested by Rattenbury (1962) for the forest flora of New Zealand, Raven (1973) for the subalpine and alpine flora of New Zealand, and Carlquist (1966, 1974) for oceanic islands in general. The process has been beautifully documented for Scaevola (Gillett, 1966) and Bidens (Gillett gc Lim, 1970) in the Hawaiian Islands, with a model exposition of the taxonomic and evolutionary implica- tions. Such processes on islands might well occur in cycles correlated with climatic change (Ehrendorfer, 1959; Rattenbury, 1962). As Ornduff (1969b) pointed out, hybrid seed often may be produced abundantly in nature, but the hybrid individuals may fail to mature and thus not be detected as part of the standing populations. The control of the occurrence of hybrids in some species of Juncus has been well discussed by Stace (1975b). Many F1 hybrids are virtually identical with one of their parents, and when backcrossing has taken place, this situation is even more frequent (cf. Raven Sc Raven, 1976). For example, introgression in Typha cannot be demonstrated morphologically although biochemical studies have suggested its importance (Lee, 1975). Disturbance of the habitat (Ander- son, 1948) or changes in climate may allow hybrid individuals, normally present in the population only as seeds, to mature and alter the proportion of phenotypes in the resulting population. In general, as Stebbins (1950) and others have pointed out, the progeny of any outcrossing species as grown in the experimental garden are more variable than the established plants of the population from which they were derived, indicating a considerable</page><page sequence="13">296 SYSTEMATIC BOTANY [Volume 1 reservoir of evolutionary flexibility and suggesting that the matter of hybrids, discussed above, is a special case of this general property. A recent critical review by Heiser (1973) suggests that what he calls "dispersed introgression"-the incorporation of genes from one species into another and their spread over wide distances-may be relatively rare. In- deed, the concept of introgressive hybridization as such is closely linked to the notion that it is in some way "desirable" for the units recognized as species to remain distinct; and, if this be true, it is therefore necessary to find means for explaining the transfer of genetic material from one to another without disrupting the boundaries between them. A more general view of the evolutionary importance of hybridization as a means for gen- erating new variability and thus making possible progressive evolution in most groups of higher plants suggests that "introgressive hybridization" as originally proposed by Edgar Anderson may be a special case of a much more general phenomenon. Heiser (1973) pointed out that the most con- vincing cases of introgressive hybridization occur over short distances, this consistent with the very restricted extent of gene flow in plants (see below). Whether or not the term and concept "introgressive hybridization" will be useful in the future remains to be seen. In a number of genera, hybrids are sterile but propagate vegetatively, sometimes becoming more abundant than one or both of their parents (reviews: Stebbins, 1950; Davis gc Heywood, 1963). The yellow-flowered European species of Rorippa, for example, are a polyploid complex in which both sterile and fertile hybrids, some expanding their ranges as a result of human activity, play a role (Jonsell, 1968, 1975). A similar situation in Opuntia subg. Cylindropuntia has been described by Grant and Grant (1971a,b). Since a degree of fertility persists in most apomictic complexes, it is probably anthropomorphic to regard them as evolutionary dead ends (Ornduff, 1971). The taxonomic system itself and the desire to classify "species" undoubtedly plays a role here also. Polyploidy is an important evolutionary mechanism that characterizes perhaps half of all species of flowering plants (Grant, 1963). The ability of well differentiated entities to hybridize is more frequent among poly- ploids than among their diploid relatives (Stebbins, 1950; Grant, 1971), and Ehrendorfer (1959) has provided a stimulating discussion of the evo- lutionary consequences and ecological corollaries of this relationship. De- spite the accumulation of much new information (Dawson, 1962; Stebbins, 197 la), misconceptions among systematists persist concerning the origin and interpretation of polyploids, and very few naturally occurring polyploids have actually been resynthesized. In a recent critical review, Harlan and de Wet (1975) have shown that most polyploids arise as a result of the functioning of unreduced gametes, rather than by chromosome doubling in hybrid individuals. The control of chromosome pairing vs. the formation of multivalents has a simple genetic basis (Riley gc Chapman, 1958; Dawson, 1962; Kimber Sc Riley, 1963; Riley</page><page sequence="14">1976] RAVEN: SYSTEMATICS AND PLANT POPULATION BIOLOGY 297 gc Law, 1965; Ornduff, 1969b; Stebbins 1971a; Waines, 1976), and chromo- some pairing in polyploid individuals is not valid as a criterion for allo- ploidy vs. autoploidy (cf. de Wet S Harlan, 1972; Harberd, 1976. p. 55-56). Autopolyploidy, in a relative sense at least, is more frequent than is often assumed (Lewis, 1967; Ornduff, 1971) although interracial hybridization, giving rise to segmental allopolyploids in the sense of Stebbins (1950), may be important in the formation of most widespread and successful autopoly- ploids. Stebbins (1972) succeeded in establishing an artificially produced tetraploid of the perennial South African grass Ehrharta erecta Lamarck alongside the diploid in Berkeley, California, this providing one well docu- mented instance of the establishment of an autoploid. Hexaploids fre- quently arise directly from tetraploids by the functioning of a single un- reduced gamete; and whether or not they will form multivalents is unpredictable. The instance of Achillea in North America is most instruc- tive in this regard (Tyrl, 1975). Many hybrids that form bivalents, like the classical example of Primula kewensis Hort. (Digby, 1912), likewise give rise to polyploids which exclusively form bivalents. In ferns, any multi- valent formation is unusual, regardless of the origin of the polyploid, and pairing is rarely observed in hybrids between diploid species (Wagner, 1974). Despite these diverse patterns, publications are still appearing in which the consistent formation of bivalents is presented as evidence of alloploidy, the origin of hexaploids is misinterpreted, and incorrect general explanations of the formation of polyploids are given. Polyploids are not necessarily reproductively isolated, in an absolute sense, from their related diploids (Miintzing, 1937; Zohary Sc Nur, 1959; Stebbins Sc Zohary, 1959; Lewis, 1967; Ornduff, 1969b, 1971; Grant, 1963, 1971). There is, therefore, no theoretical and certainly no practical reason why they should automatically be separated from their diploid relatives taxonomically (Stebbins Sc Zohary, 1959; Heywood, 1962; Davis Sc Hey- wood, 1963; Mosquin, 1966; Lewis, 1967; Ornduff, 1969b). Polyploidy may be reversible, and polyploids can at times give rise to fertile derivatives with a reduced chromosome number (Raven &amp;c Thompson, 1964; Ornduff, 1969b; Rao, 1974; Venkateswarlu Sc Rao, 1975; Barclay, 1975). The evo- lutionary significance of this process, known as polyhaploidy, awaits evalu- ation, however. Even more fundamental to the assessment of relationships is the control of chromosome pairing at meiosis. Simple gene-systems controlling synapsis have been demonstrated in Crepis, Datura, and Lycopersicon (Riley Sc Law, 1965; Riley, 1966; Taylor, 1967; de Wet Sc Harlan, 1972), and the degree of chromosome pairing at meiosis is at best an unreliable and at worst a circular indication of degree of relatedness. Bivalent formation is rarely dependent upon homology alone (de Wet &amp;c Harlan, 1972; Harberd, 1976, p. 59-60), and, until we understand the structure of eukaryotic chromo- somes and the reasons for their forming bivalents, the whole definition of chromosome homology must remain circular, Overall phenetic similarity</page><page sequence="15">298 SYSTEMATIC BOTANY [Volume 1 probably provides a better index of relatedness than degree of chromosome pairing, since it reflects far more about the genomic similarity of two organisms. Nevertheless, the importance of chromosome pairing in evalu- ating the parentage of certain polyploids is obvious. In concluding this section on the role of hybridization in plant popula- tions, I re-emphasize the need for better analyses, preferably numerical ones like those of Jensen and Eshbaugh (1976a,b), in a nontaxonomic context. The taxonomic system, with its emphasis on classifying units, provides a very inadequate and misleading vehicle for the treatment of hybrids, and strong analytical methods must be found to overcome this deficiency. Nevertheless, it seems clear that the formation of hybrids is a consistent feature of the adaptive system in many, if not most, groups of plants, especially trees, shrubs, and long-lived perennials. SALTATIONAL SPECIATION In his discussion of the "founder principle," Mayr (1942, p. 237) pointed out that in peripheral isolates, the genetic constitution of the founding individual might have an important effect upon the differentia- tion of new populations. The potential role of genetic drift in such popu- lations has likewise been emphasized (e.g., Mayr, 1954; Stebbins, 1959b), and Waddington (1957) and Wallace (1959), among others, have pointed out that the very different genetic background in such populations could materially change the selective value of particular genes. Levin (1970a,c) has re-emphasized this possibility, discussing it in terms of the lack of buffered genetic systems that may arise under such conditions. Even in 1940, Wright (1940b) spoke of bottlenecks through which peripheral popu- lations might pass in reaching new adaptive peaks, but doubted that their isolation would be sufficient to account for this. The comprehensive theory of saltational speciation was developed by Lewis (1962, 1966, 1969, 1973) as a result of his studies of the California genus Clarkia. In a variable and fluctuating climate, occasional extreme reduction of population size may be associated with reorganization of the gene pool. This may give rise to a new population that is at once repro- ductively and spatially isolated from the parental population and endowed with characteristics whereby it may be uniquely successful in the new habitat. The requisite drastic changes in population size and even local extinction have been amply documented in Clarkia (e.g., Lewis, 1953, and the papers cited above). Similar fluctuations in population size and com- position have been recorded in Hesperolinon, another genus of annual plants in California in which saltational speciation may be important (Sharsmith, 1961). Since marginal populations often grow in edaphic situations unusual for the species as a whole, saltational speciation fre- quently gives rise to derivative species of narrow edaphic requirements (Raven, 1964). Saltational speciation among plants may be most important in annuals</page><page sequence="16">1976] RAVEN: SYSTEMATICS AND PLANT POPULATION BIOLOGY 299 with limited seed storage: in these, the genetic constitution of the popu- lation may change rapidly if it is reduced to a low number (Bartholomew et al., 1973). Thus it may make an especially important contribution to the proliferation of annual species in areas of Mediterranean climate. In perennials with a mechanism for dormancy, such as Delphinium in Cali- fornia (Lewis gc Epling, 1954, 1959), or in desert annuals like Linanthus parryae (Gray) Greene (Epling &amp;c Dobzhansky, 1942; Epling et al., 1960) or Camissonia sect. Chylismia (Raven, 1962), dormant genotypes may express themselves to "swamp" the effects of temporary changes owing to particu- larly unfavorable or unusual years (Kerster gc Levin, 1970; Gottlieb, 1973a, 1974b). On the other hand, self-pollination itself may reduce effective population size greatly and thus enhance isolation and consequent diver- gence (Wright, 1940b). Carson (1959, 1965) argued that marginal populations should be in general more homozygous than those located in more central areas. Re- cently, he suggested that speciation in the Hawaiian species of Drosophila may result from the dispersal of single fertilized female individuals, fol- lowed by a population flush in the new environment, with the genetic consequences outlined above (Carson, 1968, 1970, 1971, 1973; Dobzhansky, 1972). More recently, he generalized this system to the patterns of evolu- tion that are characteristic of archipelagos (Carson, 1975). The evolution of many plant groups, such as Epilobium in the subalpine and alpine regions of New Zealand, certainly appears to correspond to this mode (Raven, 1973; Raven &amp; Raven, 1976), which may account for the rapid proliferation of closely related interfertile species on islands in general. These species can hybridize with one another and thus produce a series of new recombinants to exploit the varied habitats of the island or archipelago and to bewilder the taxonomist who attempts to deal with them. The elegant studies of Nigella (Strid, 1970) and Erysimum sect. Cheiranthus (Snogerup, 1967a,b) on the islands of the Aegean indicate the differentiation of these groups too, in a series of small, marginal popu- lations. The possible role of "reproductive drift" in such situations has been discussed by Runemark (1969). In the annual plants of Mediterranean climates studied by Lewis and his associates, chromosomal differentiation leading to intersterility often re- sults from saltational speciation. Sterility barriers likewise separate the Hawaiian species of Drosophila, although these often do not differ chromo- somally from other species in the same series. Long-lived perennial and woody plants, on the other hand, apparently differentiate without changing chromosomally or differentiating to the point where they are intersterile, which is consistent with the nature of their adaptive systems in general. Annual plants are rare on oceanic islands, and so are barriers to hybridiza- tion between congeneric plant populations, regardless of their degree of morphological differentiation. Genetic differences between island species may be small compared with those between species of other regions, as</page><page sequence="17">300 SYSTEMATIC BOTANY [Volume 1 shown for Hawaiian Drosophilidae and for the annual composite Lasthenia (Ornduff, 1976), which occurs in a Mediterranean climate. Patterns of differentiation involving saltational speciation appear to be characteristic of Mediterranean and arid areas in general and to account in large measure for their enhanced species diversity. Similar processes may also have occurred during the initial period of radiation of plants (Smith- White, 1959) and animals into an increasingly arid Australia, and may help to account for the unusual diversity in chromosome numbers in woody plants there as suggested by Lewis (1966) although the patterns do not precisely coincide. It is also tempting to postulate similar patterns of radia- tion in connection with the diversification of early angiosperms, which are unusually diverse chromosomally for woody plants. Some of the more rapidly evolving groups of woody and perennial plants, such as legumes, are chromosomally variable and may provide excellent models for radia- tion of this sort. In the highlands and arid areas of West Gondwanaland (Axelrod, 1952; Raven gc Axelrod, 1974) the population structure of angio- sperms in the Early Cretaceous may well have been like that on archipelagos or in arid to subarid areas at present (Stebbins, 1974), and these plants may have experienced a similar explosion of evolutionary novelties by saltational speciation. THE STRUCTURE OF POPULATIONS Underlying all assumptions and definitions of the evolutionary system- atist is the notion of gene exchange, or gene flow, both within and between populations. Although Sewall Wright (1940a,b, 1943) early pointed out that effective population size is often much smaller than apparent popula- tion size, it is often tacitly assumed that we know a great deal about gene flow in nature. Indeed, one of the greatest difficulties with the "biological" species concept is the implicit assumption that because populations are morphologically similar, they are so because of the exchange of genetic material (Ehrlich gc Raven, 1969). Some of the most important advances in plant systematics, broadly conceived, will result from a heightened under- standing of the extent to which gene flow actually does occur and an appreciation of the way in which it may modify the characteristics of popu- lations. As suggested by Ehrlich and Raven (1969), an explanation of the reasons why populations of a given species remain similar in the face of very different local selection pressures may prove to be much more sig- nificant in the future than the much-emphasized question of how species remain distinct from one another (cf. also Van Valen, 1976). In a useful review of gene flow in seed plants, Levin and Kerster (1974, 1975) provided an outline of our present state of knowledge in this crucially important area. Both pollen and seed dispersal are either exclusively local or highly leptokurtic in all plant populations that have been examined in detail (Moore, 1976). Effective population size in plants is indeed small, and to be measured in areas of a few meters (Levin &amp; Kerster, 1969; Brad-</page><page sequence="18">1976] RAVEN: SYSTEMATICS AND PLANT POPULATION BIOLOGY 301 shaw, 1972); many animal populations appear to have a much larger effec- tive size. Geographic isolation, therefore, may not be particularly important in plants, and more attention must be paid to selection and to the nature of inertia to change in plant populations. Extremely local patterns of differentiation-such as those demonstrated by Erickson (1945) for Clematis fremontii S. Watson var. riehlii Erickson in the Ozarks, by Gregor and Lang (e.g., 1950) for Plantago maritirna Linnaeus, by Bradshaw (1959) and McNeilly (1968) for Agrostis tenuis Sibthorp, by Snaydon (1970) and Davies and Snaydon (1973a,b) for Anthoxanthum odoratum Linnaeus, and by Antonovics (this symposium)-will doubtless prove to be the rule, not the exception, as more and more groups of plants are investigated in comparable detail. Gene flow and effective population size are both larger in perennial than in annual species, judged from the review of Levin and Kerster (1974), but on the other hand, effective population size, as I have emphasized, is small to very small in all plant species that have been investigated. This observation raises a question concerning the sources of genetic variability available to plant populations: if they are as small as they now seem to be, the importance of hybridization would be heightened and its seeming prevalence among perennial and woody plant groups, discussed in the pre- ceding section, more readily understood. For the future, it will be important to amass more information about the dimension of gene flow in nature. Fluorescent dyes and other chemical markers, radioisotopes (e.g., Colwell, 1951), and neutron-activation analysis (Handel, 1976) have been used to the movement of pollen, and we stand to learn a great deal by the judicious application of these techniques. Seed transport and establishment are likewise of great importance, and there have been recent studies of significance in this area (e.g., Janzen, 1969; Beattie gc Lyons, 1975). Both pollen dispersal and seed dispersal are, of course, only a part of the expanding field of plant demography reviewed by Harper (1967), Harper and White (1970, 1974), Bradshaw (1972), and others. Botanists need to learn as much as their zoological counterparts about the age structure, turnover, genetics, and the operation of selection in the populations with which they are concerned. The studies of Schaal (1974, 1975; Schaal Sc Levin, 1976) on the long-lived perennial composite Liatris are particularly good examples of the sorts of studies that will lead to further progress and understanding of the properties of plant populations. FUTURE DIRECTIONS Special mention should be made of the study of enzyme polymorphisms as a means for understanding plant populations (Scandalios, 1969; Fincham, 1972; Johnson, 1973, 1974, 1975; Bryant, 1974; Ayala, 1975). Such poly- morphisms have been used to demonstrate heterozygote superiority in Avena (Marshall Re Allard, 1970) and in barley (Allard et al., 1972). In A. barbata Brotero (Hamrick Re Allard, 1972) and in Liatris (Schaal Sc Levin, 1976) very local differentiation has been demonstrated by means of enzyme</page><page sequence="19">302 SYSTEMATIC BOTANY [Volume 1 polymorphisms. Of particular interest have been a series of papers con- cerned with the estimation of degree of outcrossing vs. inbreeding in plants, using enzyme polymorphisms; examples include the studies of Avena (Marshall 8c Allard, 1970), Vulpia (Kannenberg 8c Allard, 1967), Leavenworthia (Solbrig, 1972), Lycopersicon (Rick 8c Fobes, 1975), and Eucalyptus (Brown et al., 1975). Enzyme polymorphisms have likewise been utilized to investigate the relationships between species and problems of their origin, as in diploid species of Brassica (Vaughan 8c Waite, 1967a), Lycopersicon (Rick et al., 1976), Stephanomeria (Gottlieb, 1973a, 1974b, 1975), Clarkia (Gottlieb, 1973b, 1974a); polyploid species of Agropyron (Hunziker, 1969) and Brassica (Vaughan 8c Waite, 1967b); and complex structural heterozygotes in Oenothera (Levin, 1975). For the future, one important question will concern the adaptive sig- nificance of the observed enzyme polymorphisms. Increasing levels of bio- chemical sophistication (e.g., Johnson, 1976) and the building of critical cross-links between the fields of plant physiological ecology, population genetics, and molecular biology probably will lead to an unequivocal reso- lution of this problem within the next five years. In my opinion, the in- creasing weight of evidence will demonstrate the operation of natural selection in maintaining these enzyme polymorphisms, and provide more and more evidence like McNaughton's (1974) for Typha. New approaches to the study of plant chromosomes will also provide valuable insight into the structure and functioning of plant populations in the future (Stebbins, 1966). First, the detailed study of chromosomes provides valuable evidence concerning the nature of, and levels of hetero- zygosity in, plant populations; for example, in Trillium (e.g., Kurabayashi, 1960; Fukuda, 1967, 1969; Fukuda 8c Channell, 1975). Now, the banding techniques for chromosomes, developed mostly with animal materials (Hsu, 1973), are being applied to plants such as Tulipa (Filion, 1974), Vicia faba Linnaeus (Dobel et al., 1973), and others (Vosa 8c Marchi, 1972; Greilhuber, 1973; Schweizer, 1973), with increasing success. As the techniques are established and worked out in relation to our increasing knowledge about the structure of eukaryotic chromosomes, better and better results should be obtained. Another fruitful approach, exemplified by papers on Anemone (Rothfels et al., 1966), Lolium (Rees &amp;c Jones, 1967), Allium (Jones 8c Rees, 1968), the Asteraceae-Anthemideae (Nagl 8c Ehrendorfer, 1974), and Luzula (Bar- low 8c Nevin, 1976) is concerned with the quantitative determination of DNA in plant chromosomes and the role of changes in DNA content in the evolution of various groups. Both in the paper cited on Anthemideae and in an analysis of another group of Asteraceae, Microseridinae (Price 8c Bachmann, 1975), evolutionary increases and decreases in DNA content have been demonstrated. Using similar methods, Stucky and Jackson (1975) demonstrated that species of Asteraceae-Astereae with gametic chromosome number of n = 9 have less DNA content than their relatives with n = 4 and</page><page sequence="20">1976] RAVEN: SYSTEMATICS AND PLANT POPULATION BIOLOGY 303 n = 5, supporting arguments that n = 9 and not n = 5 is the original basic chromosome number for the group. Ultimately, an improved understanding of the nature and extent of populations in plants will allow us to view such important evolutionary parameters as mating system more realistically (Stebbins, 1957; Baker, 1959; Allard, 1975; Jain, 1975, 1976). The discrete biotypes that often occur together in autogamous plants such as Clarkia (Lewis, 1953), Microseris (Chambers, 1955), and Bromus carinatus Hooker 8c Arnott (Harlan, 1945), and the apomictic races that coexist are simply enough understood; but what allows the recognition of morphologically and geographically defined species in such groups? In Senecio vulgaris Linnaeus, the plants become more and more highly outcrossing as the season progresses (Haskell, 1953); in Clarkia, they become more and more autogamous (Lewis, 1953). How are these systems established and maintained, and how do they affect the structure of the populations in which they occur? Modern methodology has now advanced to the point where these and many analogous questions may be attacked directly. A great deal more is known today about the adaptive role of various features of flowering plants than was available, for example, to Stebbins in 1950. In indicating directions for the future, it is appropriate to review briefly some of the areas concerned and to outline their importance. Mooney (this symposium) has given us an outstanding review of the current status of physiological plant ecology. As pointed out by Bradshaw (1972) and others, and reviewed above, extremely high local selection pres- sures appear to characterize plant populations, and these result in most groups in very local patterns of differentiation, often extending over a few meters at most. To give just a single example, plants of the self-incom- patible Ranunculus flammula Linnaeus that grow at lower levels on lake shores have been shown to be genetically differentiated from those that grow higher on the same shores and to produce more dissected leaves (Cook 8c Johnson, 1968); the number of carpels per flower ("clutch size") likewise has been shown to differ in some of the same populations (John- son Sc Cook, 1968). The ecological control of many of the features that vary within and between angiosperm populations is apt to be much more acute than suspected at present and is in fact the key to understanding the variability and evolution of plant populations (Kruckeberg, 1969a,b). To what extent is the placement of oak trees on a hillside related to the genotype of the specific individuals present? We are now able to discuss even such features as variation in photo- synthetic carbon fixation pathways in a systematic and ecological context (Cooper, 1975). Such pathways occasionally have been shown to vary within genera; e.g., Euphorbia (Webster et al., 1975) and Atriplex (Bjorkman et al., 1971). The geographic distribution and ecological role of C4 carbon fixation is now widely discussed (e.g., Teeri c Stowe, 1976), and has important systematic and evolutionary implications.</page><page sequence="21">304 SYSTEMATIC BOTANY [Volume 1 Many of the traditional morphological features used in plant systematics are now being understood in an ecological context (B6cher, 1963). Among these might be mentioned plant trichomes; Levin (1973) has provided a review of the function and distribution of these structures. Working with Passiflora adenopoda De Candolle, Gilbert (1971) demonstrated the de- fensive function of its hooked trichomes. In Encelia, the increasingly pubescent leaves that are produced during the hot, dry summers dra- matically reduce the photosynthetic rate (Ehleringer et al., 1976); these are differences between populations and also between species. Even the growth habit of trees is now being subjected to rigorous analysis with re- sults of outstanding interest (e.g., Halle 8c Oldeman, 1970; Horn, 1971; Oldeman, 1974). Seeds are being better understood in their role as the principal dispersal units in flowering plants and gymnosperms (Stebbins, 1970, 1971 b). Their size, shape, and chemical constituency have been considered by a number of authors and found to have clear ecological significance (e.g., Janzen, 1969, 1971; Janzen Re Orians, 1974). To give a recent specific example, Beattie and Lyons (1975) elegantly analyzed the complex interrelationships between ballastic seed dispersal and myrmecochory in Viola sect. Rostel- latae. On a continental scale, Berg (1975) demonstrated that some 10%; of the total flora of Australia-more than 1500 species-consists of angio- sperms in which the seeds are dispersed by ants. The existence of these myrmecochorous plants was previously unsuspected, and they are thought to have originated in situ in Australia with the spread of xeric climates in Neogene time. A recent collection of papers (Gilbert &amp; Raven, 1975) amply demonstrates the vigor of coevolutionary studies today (see also review: Meeuse, 1973). In one area, the role of secondary metabolites in plant defense is complex and has been the subject of hundreds of papers over the past decade; this role provides a raison d'etre for much of the field of phytochemistry, and when the connection is made more explicit (cf. Fraenkel, 1969; Seigler Re Price, 1976) we may hope for exciting advances in our understanding of this subject. The common utilization of different plant groups by specific insects or other herbivores, or by parasitic fungi, is often taken as evidence for relationship; but as pointed out by Ehrlich and Raven (1965), it should instead be taken as possible evidence of chemical similarity, which may or may not reflect common origin. One special field of coevolution, that involving pollination studies, has long been understood as the adaptive basis for variation in angiosperm flowers. Recently, an increased understanding of the role of the energetics of pollinators in structuring plant populations and in modifying the features of angiosperm flowers is deepening our appreciation of a variety of evo- lutionary phenomena (Heinrich &amp; Raven, 1972; Heinrich, 1975). Another exciting area, directly related to the functioning of pollination systems, concerns the adaptive significance of the various features of pollen; the</page><page sequence="22">1976] RAVEN: SYSTEMATICS AND PLANT POPULATION BIOLOGY 305 book edited by Ferguson and Muller (1976) gives some idea of the present vigor of this field. One particularly interesting special field of investigation involves para- sitic angiosperms. In the Scrophulariaceae, for example, the genotype of the parasitic plant is directly related to that of its host and is complexly involved in its survival (Atsatt, 1970) despite a relative lack of host speci- ficity (Weber, 1976). A series of parallel ecological races may characterize different genera and parts of genera within the group, and the whole system, in northeastern Europe at least, appears to have been affected greatly by human disturbance of natural habitats (Karlsson, 1974, 1976). Considering the prevalence of mycorrhiza and the complex interactions that occur with soil organisms, not to mention those that involve other angiosperms, one may agree with D. H. Lewis (1973, p. 151), that "individual plants and ani- mals . . . are, more often than not, symbiotic systems." Their situation in a given ecosystem, then, may often depend not only upon their own genotype but also upon the genotypes of other organisms with which they are more or less closely linked. DISCUSSION This is the most exciting time in history for the study of the dynamics of plant populations. Our level of sophistication in dealing with these populations, although limited, has never been higher; and the tools avail- able to us have never been more varied or powerful. Just as genetics in- fused the whole field of plant systematics and evolution with new insights and directions during the first half of the present century, so ecology is doing in the second (Snaydon, 1973). The process is dynamic and calls for direct attention to populations and their functioning in nature; it will be appropriate for many kinds of experimental studies in the field (Merx- muller, 1970) to test our hypotheses, which in so many areas of plant population biology rest upon such a slender base. For some three centuries, the construction of a system of classification into which all organisms could be fitted provided the main rationale for the study of these organisms by scientists. Although the description of previously undetected taxa has provided a powerful stimulus for the ex- ploration of poorly known regions of the world and formed the basis for lifetimes of study by thousands of botanists and zoologists, it does not in itself provide a sufficient basis for further advances in fundamental knowl- edge about the properties of populations (cf. Stebbins, 1950; Camp, 1951). Nor will the production of better and better schemes of classification, such as that implied by the illusory "biological species concept," help us in this effort. Instead, as pointed out by Ehrlich and Holm (1962) and others, we must forge a new science of plant (and animal) populations, speed up the process of fusion between formerly distinct disciplines, and find new ways to look at the structure of nature. This is a formidable task, but the rewards are likely to be enormous.</page><page sequence="23">306 SYSTEMATIC BOTANY [Volume 1 Three critical points are as follows: First, the nature of species is highly variable and the utility of the category in various theoretical approximations is limited and limited in a way that must be understood clearly or stand as a serious obstacle to progress. Second, a concerted effort must be made to determine the forces that do indeed hold together the morphological/ ecological units that we recognize as species (Ehrlich &amp;c Raven, 1969; Van Valen, 1976). There is no basis for assuming that "gene flow" plays any but a limited role in the process, and consequently an alternative explana- tion is urgently required. Third, we must devise experiments to give clearer insights into the functioning of individuals and populations in ecosystems, particularly with respect to such important new concepts as coevolution. Such studies have barely begun. In closing, I draw attention to the rapid destruction of the tropical forests, virtually all of which will have been cut by the end of this century, and to the particular importance of this destruction to students of popula- tion biology (Raven, 1977). Fully two-thirds of all species of plants and animals live in the tropics, and no more than a fifth of these have even been given Latin names. There is absolutely no way in which the patient sifting of information can produce inventories of tropical plants and animals upon which further progress in population biology can be based. It is of the utmost importance that such inventories be made at an accelerated rate while this is still possible, so that we can leave behind some record of tropical plants and animals for those who will follow us in the twenty-first century; but at the same time, whatever we need to know about the popula- tion biology of tropical plants and animals must be determined now, and directly, because the traditional methods of taxonomy will be unable to provide a base for these questions during the limited remaining time when they may still be asked.
