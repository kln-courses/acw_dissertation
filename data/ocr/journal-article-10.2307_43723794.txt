<plain_text><page sequence="1">Wright, G. Ernest, The Challenge of Israel's Faith (U. of Chicago Press: 1944). Pp. ix, 108. $1.50. This is an eloquent protest against the neglect into which the Old Testament has fallen, and an attempt to present the central themes</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 503 of Israelite faith as of value for present day readers. It is one of the most invigorating books to appear in some time. The author is pro- fessor of Old Testament history at the McCormick Theological Semi- nary, Chicago, and his little book is exactly the kind of book one would expect a good Protestant to write, and apparently he is a very good Protestant. He protests against the way preachers use the Scripture, "going to it, not to be taught by it, not to find in it criticism of their religion or of their system, but simply to find illustrations of this point or that" (p. 102). He protests against a diminishing use of the Old Testa- ment, which deserves a much closer scrutiny. He protests (and how rightly!) against the kind of grammatical, linguistic, historical ap- proach to the Bible that leaves the student unmoved, unreformed, and worst of all, ignorant of "the Word behind the words" (p. 13). He wants us to stop evading the issues, to study the unequivocal, clear-cut theology of the prophets, to face ourselves in the light of divine facts. God has made himself known, he says (and it is his theme), not pri- marily in ideas, but in events (p. 101). We shall now bring up and insist somewhat on certain points, not be- cause of any desire for destructive criticism on our part, but because these things are in our opinion defects which impair the value of what is otherwise an excellent, provocative book. In the first place, it seems that inspiration is not a theological notion, but should rather be essentially emotional ; the inspired book inspires readers (pp. 13-14). Thus an interesting equation is set up: Christ: Moses :: Luther : Christ. For Jesus, the Scriptures were authoritative and the word of God, "but at the same time he was able to pick and to choose and to add. There was in him an inner certainty about eternal truth which enabled him to use the written law as his authority and at the same time to be its critic. Turning to Martin Luther, we find the very same situation. . . Both approached the Bible by way of inward experience. . . 'Conscience is between us and the Bible - a conscience which it may be a duty to enlighten, but not a duty to disobey because God speaks to us through i≈• " (pp. 100-12 passim ). One finds oneself curious whether the next step will not logically terminate the equation with : as I to Luther, that is, that we too should choose what we would from the Scriptures, which would lead us once more to a private inter- pretation without the hindrance of any external restrictions. It is not as if we Catholics are uninterested in what the Word of God is for us right now ; the contrary is true. We believe firmly that "All scripture is inspired by God, and useful for teaching, for re- proving, for correcting, for instructing in justice; that the man of God may be perfect, equipped for every good work" (2 Tim. 3:16-17). But the Bible is not self-explanatory, nor does it constitute by itself a</page><page sequence="3">504 Book Reviews rule of Faith. Without the restrictions, and they are both few and utterly logical, besides being theological, interpretation will most cer- tainly go awry. It seems too that Mr. Wright here, implicitly at least, adores a sort of freedom, infinite freedom. This freedom is a wonderful thing; we want it too, but we adore God and reverence His Church. He how- ever wants to know "how can we be sure the Church tells us the truth. Because of the witness of the Scripture ? And then believe the Scrip- ture on the authority of the Church ? The author will have none of this vicious circle (p. 8) - and who would blame him - especially in view of the fact that "the Catholic church and all religious organizations have been guilty far too often of dogmatically claiming that the Bible says what we now know it does not say" (ibid). What these false dogmatic claims are is not stated. The reviewer also got the impression that Mr. Wright does not think too highly of ritual (e.g., pp. 42-44), although he concedes that the differences between the prophetic and priestly attitude in this regard can be exaggerated out of due proportion. To preserve that proportion, then, it should be stated that if ritual were to lead men to hate good and love evil (as opposed to "the essence of the Law according to the prophets" (Amos 5:15), i.e., to walk humbly before the Lord, hating evil and loving good), then it would be intrinsically evil and a thing to be pitilessly condemned. Actually of course it does no such thing. Ritual and the gestures of religious worship are not the goal of re- ligion, but they are a minimum of all religion. They are accidentals which safeguard the substance. Not to be exaggerated, neither are they to be minimized. Men cannot worship God as spirits, but only as men. "Most of us today who are trying to be good Christian theists, be- lieving in the living, intervening, personal God . . . actually live as though we were deists, really believing that God will not enter the details of daily life" (p. 55). It is refreshing to hear one outside the Church speaking so earnestly and definitely about God and His rights. The author believes that perhaps the secret of the vitality of Old Testament prophetic religion lay in its vivid anthropomorphism, and that we could use more of it today as a true answer to modern deism. There is indeed little in an abstract principle, or "God-idea," to stir the emotions or strike at the will (p. 67). But, then, is not ritual a kind of dramatic anthropomorphism? Why limit it to fragile words, when actions speak more loudly still when they are really a reflection of words ? The Challenge of Israel's Faith is the challenge of a personal but now superseded religion ; the challenge of Catholicism is that of a living Faith. These two things are not contradictory, for actually</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 505 nothing is more intensely personal than living Catholicism, which alone has fulfilled in it the promises made to Israel.
