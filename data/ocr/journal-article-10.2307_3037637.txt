ISBN: 0-670-85018-7. 1996. Few physicists are more philosophical than Richard Feynman. Lacking something better to read, I picked up Six Easy Pieces (1995. New York: Addison- Wesley) last week-the newly edited for mass con- sumption version of his still classic 1963 Lectures on Physics (Reading (MA): Addison-Wesley). In the course of covering the basics on atoms and subat- oms, matter and energy, Newtonian and quantum laws, Feynman pauses to put in a footnote that "Po- ets say science takes away from the beauty of the stars-mere globs of gas atoms. Nothing is 'mere.' I too can see the stars on a desert night, and feel them. But do I see less or more? . . . What is the pattern, or the meaning, or the why? It does not do harm to the mystery to know a little about it. For far more marvelous is the truth than any artists of the past imagined! . . . What men are poets who can speak of Jupiter if he were like a man, but if he is an immense spinning sphere of methane and ammo- nia must be silent?" (pp 59-60). In the last century,Johann Wolfgang von Goethe filled fourteen volumes with scientific work, some of which (like his Theory of Color, he held in high regard) has not stood the test of time-though Goethe left a few appreciated bits of poetry, from Werther to Faust, behind. A Renaissance man is hard to find. I, personally, have always been a little reluctant to give up the theory that Francis Bacon- the 16th-century chancellor to James I who, at the end of a full life, put together the Novum Organum and pushed for scientific empiricism-wrote Shake- speare's plays. But the evidence doesn't seem to have borne that out; and the point, after all, is that truth is not just more useful but also more deep and more beautiful than fiction. Richard Dawkins makes that point in Climbing Mount Improbable. He's devoted a lifetime to making it. The book starts with Dawkins's reflecting on a lit- erary lecture that he heard about the fig. That lec- ture invoked, among other things, the fig as insult, the fig as pudenda, how to eat a fig, "and, I rather think, 'the fig as text'" (p 1). None of it, as Dawkins</page><page sequence="2">DECEMBER 1997 NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 467 makes clear in the rest of his book, is anywhere near as glorious as the real-life color and complexity of a South American fig-a hanging garden filled with flowers and teeming with scheming and symbiotic wasps. " [T] he facts about figs [in sum] are at least as enthralling as anything ... in mythology or litera- ture" (p 278). In art, there is no subject like life. And, in this century, few have made art of life-peeled away the lovely, luminescent layers from the intricacies of embryology, to the forty variations on the path to vertebrate sight, to the extended phenotypic geom- etry of a spider's web-like Richard Dawkins. And here, as it's always been for Dawkins, the last layer of life is its most basic kernel. The point of life is the proliferation of genes. Dawkins's job, as he puts it explicitly in his pref- ace, is to " [t] ry to inspire everybody with the poetry of science." He does it exemplarily well. As much as any of us in 1997 can, Richard Dawkins comes close to being a Renaissance man. LAURA BETZIG, TheAdaptionist Program, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan and its beautifully executed illustrations showcase the most important points in sexual selection, includ- ing territoriality, sexual imprinting, experimental evidence for female choice, and much more. Some topics not immediately related to sexual selection, such as the evolution of sexuality or the advantage of two sexes, give the book added depth. However, these subjects are covered in lieu of more pertinent ones, most obviously the connection between dif- ferences in parental investment, and which sex in- vests more in courtship. Why are females choosy and males chosen? Also absent are the names of scientists other than Darwin. We realize that it would be inappropriate to document each author, but how can runaway se- lection be discussed without mentioning Fisher, or parental investment without Trivers? The reason for naming these people is not simply aggrandize- ment; in many cases the idea is inseparable from its originator. Furthermore, we believe that describing science as a collection of facts without referring to the people responsible for establishing those facts gives a false image of the scientific enterprise to an already scientifically confused public. In discussing sexual selection with general audi- ences, questions about human mate choice invari- ably pop up, so we applaud Gould and Gould for including a chapter on human mate selection. Un- fortunately, the views expressed are antiquated, and ignore recent developments in evolutionary psy- chology. Finally, this and other chapters are rife with anthropomorphism. Giant water bugs are "vi- cious," bark beetles "respectful." There is a fine line to walk here, and we understand the desire to make behavior accessible to the public, but it must be done without giving the impression that biologists view animals as little people with fur, feathers, or chitin.
