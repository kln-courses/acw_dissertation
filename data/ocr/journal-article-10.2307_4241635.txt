<plain_text><page sequence="1">t WESTERN ASIATIC SEALS IN THE WALTERS ART GALLERY By CYRUS H. GORDON iHE Near East glyptic collection in the Walters Art Gallery,1 Baltimore, has been virtually unknown except for the original 'Tarkondemos' seal rediscovered and published by Dr. Dorothy K. Hill (Archiv Orientatili, ix, 1937, 307-10).2 The collection, though numbering only 128 pieces, is interestingly varied. Unfortunately, there is no record of where any of the seals were found; all were purchased from dealers. The plaster impressions that have found their way into the Walters Art Gallery are included in this study. No information regarding the where- abouts of the originals is available. The literature on the glyptic art of Mesopotamia and the surrounding countries is large and very scattered. No one has attempted to compile a complete bibliography, and the best available list of publications is Von der Osten's.3 At present there is much scholarly activity focussed on the study of seals, as is exemplified by the recent and the forthcoming contributions of Frankfort,4 Herzfeld, Van Buren,5 et al. Strange as it seems, we are better informed on glyptics of the fourth and third millennia than on those of the second and first millennia (b.c.), thanks especially to the rich finds at the methodically excavated sites of Warka, Fara, Ur, Khafaji, Tall Asmar, &amp;c. The material from the Warka period to the Early Dynastic has been admirably treated by Moortgat,6 but later remains have been relatively neglected. However, Moortgat has helped dispel the darkness of the second millennium,7 and Herzfeld8 has done much to fix the chronology of the second millennium and later Assyrian seals by assembling the material dated by inscriptions. The glyptics of the highly problematic second millennium will be further clarified by the forthcoming publications of Schaeffer on the seals from Ras Shamra and of McEwan on those from Tall Judaideh, while Hittite seals and the reading of the hieroglyphs on them will be elucidated by the 200 seals recently unearthed at Bogazk?y. It is gratifying to report that No. 26 of the present collection provides a new fixed point in the difficult second millennium. 1 This study has been made possible by the interest and co-operation of Mr. C. Morgan Marshall, Director of the Walters Art Gallery, and his able staff. I am also deeply grateful to my colleagues, Professor Wm. F. Albright and Mr. A. Sachs, for their constant helpfulness. 2 For seal impressions on Old Assyrian tablets in the Gallery, see J. Lewy, Archives d* Histoire du Droit Oriental, ?, 1937, pi. li. 3 Oriental Institute Publications, xxii ( = Newell Collection), Chicago, X934, 168-90; continued in vol. xxxvii (= Brett Collection), 1936, pp. 62-70. 4 Frankfort is about to publish a general study on Meeopotamian glyptics. 5 Mrs. Van Buren is preparing a series of mono- graphs on 'fauna* for Analecta Orientalia. 6 Fr?he Bildkunst in Sumer (Mitteilungen der Vorderanatisch-aegyptischen Gesellschaft, XL, 3), 1935. 7 Die bildende Kunst des alten Orients und die Bergv?lker, Berlin, 1932. 8 Die Kunst des zweiten Jahrtausends in Vorder- asien (Archaeologische Mitteilungen aus Iran, vm, 1937, 103-60; rx. 1938, 1-79).</page><page sequence="2">4 CYRUS H. GORDON Progress is so rapid in the study of the ancient Near East that even the chronology of well-known periods may still be revolutionized. Using new inscriptional evidence from Mari, Thureau-Dangin has proved conclusively that Samsi-Adad I of Assyria and Ijammurabi of Babylonia were contem- poraries (Revue d'Assyriologie, xxxiv, 1937, 135--9). Albright holds that this synchronism necessitates a drastic reduction in the chronology of all Baby- lonian history prior to about 1500 B.c., giving us the following scheme (Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No. 69, Feb. 1938, 18-21): Beginning of the Early Dynastic Age . . . c. 3000 b.c. Fara period ........ c. 28th century Royal tombs of Ur . . . . . . c. 27th century Zur-NanSe ........ c. 2600 Dynasty of Akkad ....... c. 2500-2320 Third Dynasty of Ur . . c. 2210-2100 Dynasties of Isin and Larsa . . c. 2100- First Dynasty of Babylon . . . . . c. 1970-1670 Poebel's forthcoming publication of the Khorsabad Assyrian king-list is bound to throw new light on the subject. Meanwhile, I follow Albright's chronology. The seals known as * North Syrian'1 have an earlier beginning than is commonly thought. The goddess with raised hands (see ? 2, below), found in Nos. 38, 41 (cf. No. 54), is prominent in Babylon I seals. On Nos. 53 and 54 (Nos. 51-4 [cf. No. 50], characterized by the use of dotted circles, are contemporary with North Syrian seals though actually they are of Assyrian provenance and resemble Kirkuk glyptics) appears a god like 'Amurru* (? 1), who is associated with Babylon I art. The small jug (?1600) on No. 37 is typical of the Middle Bronze Age (median date, 1700). Furthermore, the impression of a North Syrian seal has been found on a Middle Bronze jar,2 so that North Syrian glyptics may accordingly begin as early as the eighteenth century. It is interesting to note that the impression on the jar portrays a hare, which is Egyptian (see Nos. 37, 44, Sec.) rather than Mesopotamian, as are so many features of this group in contradistinction to contemporary Assyrian art from Assur and Kirkuk. North Syrian glyptics were, for the most part, brought into being by a fusion of Egyptian and Old Assyrian elements, but how late the style persisted is hard to determine, and tentatively we may set its close somewhere after the end of the fifteenth century. Some definite solutions for the chronological problems of North Syrian art may be supplied in the near future when Dr. McEwan and Professor Ingholt publish seals of this class from stratified excavations, but so far the published material has come from dealers and hence nothing is known about exact provenance. The heroes depicted on Western Asiatic seals frequently wear belts, even when they are otherwise unclad (cf. Nos. 6-9, 30, 55, 88, &amp;c), and it is therefore likely that the belt may serve a purpose other than that of dress. 1 i.e. Moortgat'e 'nordeyriech'; often called 'Syro-Hittite'. 2 A. RowE, A Catalogue of Egyptian Scarabs (&amp;c.)i Cairo, 1936, pi. xxvi, S. 4.</page><page sequence="3">WESTERN ASIATIC SEALS IN THE WALTERS ART GALLERY 5 The clue is provided by No. 9, where Enkidu conveniently finds belts on the 'bull of heaven' for applying a wrestling grip, and it follows that the ancient Mesopotamians practised belt-wrestling?that is to say, the contestants wore belts on which the holds were taken much as in the glima of Iceland and Schwingen of Switzerland. When I communicated my explanation of the belt to Professor Albright, he checked my theory by the statuette of the wrestlers from Khafaji (Speiser, Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research, No. 67, Oct. 1937, 5, Fig. 4), where each combatant is clearly gripping the belt of the other, and so my thesis is confirmed. It is conceivable (though the point ought not to be pressed) that prominent belts fastened to garments (cf. Nos. 91, 92, 96, 114, 120) are sometimes meant for use in wrestling, as are the stout girdles worn with the Swiss Schwinghosen. We must bear in mind the possible discrepancy between the date of the theme of a seal and the time of execution of the particular seal (see Nos. 6-10) ; the glyptologist must cope with archaizing tendencies and imitations. The question of fakes is much the same. A modern fake with no resemblance to ancient Mesopotamian art will naturally not be included in this study, but a well-copied fake of an unpublished original is of definite value, pending the publication of the original. The reader should, of course, be warned that the seal in question may well be a forgery. I do not think, however, that the scholar should take it on himself to decide with finality that such and such a monument is a modern imitation without value, for a peculiar seal may belong to a little known or totally unknown category, and it may be only a matter of time until the suspected seal will prove to be genuine with copious analogues. Furthermore, an actual fake may be one of a long series manufactured by an active forger and it does the field a service to have the type exposed, and for these reasons I have included some seals that I suspect of being faked. In order to facilitate cross references to recurring features, I append the following list of selected elements with the numbers of the seals on which they are found : ? i.

(W[alters] A[rt] G[allery] 42.540.)1 Polished tan marble stamp. The seal is in the shape of a reclining calf. The compactness is admirable, for only the head protrudes from the general mass. The gem-cutter has indicated the curved horns, ears, mouth, tail, a fore-leg and a hind leg; note also the sockets, into which eyes were inlaid, and a cross under each foot to indicate the hoof. The stone is pierced from the middle of the back to the middle of the belly.2 This type of seal is regularly marked by good execution of the animal forming the seal, and by inferior workmanship of the scene to be stamped. The scene here consists of five large, long-tailed quadrupeds, one in each corner and one towards the centre. Round and among them are tiny quadrupeds and other nondescript creatures. The animals' bodies are made with the drill, and, where the animals are large enough, their torsos tend to be made by drilling three overlapping circles, which is the characteristic representation of animal bodies in the Jamdet Nasr period. 2. (WAG C65). Plaster impression of cylinder. The central figure is a nude hero with upright locks, who stands between a rampant bull (to the left) and a deer (?) that has long, curved horns. These animals look back toward the characteristically heavy-maned, gaping lions which attack them. On the lion that bites the bull's head can be seen the hair on the belly (shown by hatching). Another nude hero grasps this lion's long, raised tail, over which is a six-pointed star (see ? xxii). In front of each hero is an elongated space-filler. Period of Earlier Ur Cemetery.3 3. (WAG 42.434). Lapis lazuli cylinder. Crossed, gaping lions attack each a rampant deer. Between the lions' heads is a crescent mounted on a stand which is depicted by a vertical line over two horizontal lines. The lions' fore-paws are conventionalized to three parallel lines. The stag on the left looks back at the rampant leopard which also attacks him. The ibex (or wild goat) looks up helplessly with open mouth as if bellowing with fear. To relieve the monotony of exact antithesis, the artist has represented one lion as biting his victim's neck, but the other lion, not; and has one lion's tail appearing between the legs, while the other's is behind both legs. The general scene is common to the Early Dynastic and Akkadian periods. The leopard's head is made in the outline style of Early Dynastic art, but, on the other hand, the grimness and reality of the combat indicate Akkadian art.4 4. (WAG 42.436). Shell cylinder. The'Kish'hero (i.e. nude, bearded man with shoulder-length hair and flat cap) stands between and holds two (identical?) rampant ibexes, each of which looks back at the rampant, gaping lion that attacks it. The slightly curved, upright tails of the lions artistically limit the scene. The Kish hero is found only on seals from the time of the 1 Dimensions need not be given because the photographs are very nearly actual size. 2 All the seals in this collection are pierced. 3 Cf.

GORDON Later Ur Cemetery and Akkadian period (the technique is very similar in both periods). 5. (WAG 42.427). Shell cylinder. Two rampant lions, whose tails limit the scene as in No. 4, attack an ibex (on right) and a mouflon ( ?) which stand rampant, horns to horns and rump to rump. This is a badly engraved Akkadian seal. 6. (WAG C64). Plaster impression of cylinder. There are three pairs of upright figures. First pair: a naked hero holds a bull upside down by the tail and a hind leg. Second pair: a winged lion with the hindquarters of a bird (? xiv) bites the head of a deer. Under the deer, which is off the ground and looks behind it, are ten drilled dots which may depict (rather than mountainous land) the dung expelled from terror.1 Third pair: a lion bites the head of a deer that looks behind. The lion's mane (unlike that of winged lion) is represented like flounces (cf. Nos. 11-17, &amp;c). In all three groups hatching indicates the hair, feathers, and musculature of the animals. The theme is, for the most part, Akkadian, although the workmanship is probably later. 7. (WAG C63). Plaster impression of cylinder. There are three groups of upright figures (cf. No. 6). The left group is a lion biting the upper jaw of a male (bovine ?) quadruped that looks back at his attacker. The middle group consists of a nude, long-haired, long-bearded hero wearing only a belt, who seizes a lion by the neck and a fore-paw. The right pair is a lion attacked in front by Enkidu and behind by Gilgamesh. Both heroes wear triple belts. Enkidu is classically depicted as a bull below the waist and a man above the waist, except for bull's horns and ears. His body is a profile, but his well- bearded face looks to the front. He grasps the lion by the neck and a fore- paw. Gilgamesh, who, like Enkidu, is naked, has a long beard, and grips the lion's tail with a hand and leg. His head would hardly have been drawn thus by a third millennium artist, since Gilgamesh regularly faces front (not in profile as here, see ? v), and furthermore, his three side curls are misunder- stood and placed behind the head. Nor does the hero in the middle group look genuine. I am therefore inclined to consider this seal a partly accurate imitation of an original, of which the theme and date of execution are similar to those of No. 6. Note that the lions'1 manes and the hair of the victim in the left pair are closely paralleled in No. 6.2 8. (WAG 42.425.) Haematite cylinder. Between two eight-pointed stars (? xxii) is Gilgamesh (? v) typically delineated, wearing only a heavy belt and standing with body in profile, but his (shoulders and) bearded face in front view, so that the three curls on either side are visible. His muscles are effectively emphasized by deep cutting. He pulls away the rampant lion which bites the head of a kneeling hero, grasping the lion by the head and tail, and steps on a haunch. The kneeling hero wears a dress with crossed shoulder straps and a double belt. On the left is another rampant gaping lion menacing 1 Cf. Sennacherib's Taylor Prism, col. vi, line 21 Delitzsch, Assyrische Lesest?cke, Leipzig, 1912,75). 2 [Herzfeld informs me that my objections to the authenticity of this seal are not insurmountable.]</page><page sequence="7">WESTERN ASIATIC SEALS IN THE WALTERS ART GALLERY 9 the hero. The manes are engraved as flounces (see Nos. 6, 7). Three birds (? viii), two of which look backwards, and a fish (? x) fill the field. The scene is Akkadian, but the treatment is not standard. The birds resemble those commonly found on Ur III seals and perhaps this seal is (a later imitation [?] of) an Ur III representation of an Akkadian theme. 9. (WAG C18.) Plaster impression of cylinder. Enkidu (see No. 7), vanquishing the rampant 'bull of heaven', is repeated antithetically.1 He seizes the bull by the throat, and with the other hand is about to grip the belt around its belly, and to facilitate the hero's victory the bull has two triple belts, one round the belly and one under the front shoulders. Enkidu and the bull have identical heads. The engraver has taken pains to show the muscles of the haunch and the bristles on the tails. Between the antithetic groups is an encased pot (? xx) on a fluted stand (however, cf. No. 14). Between the left pair is a pot (? xx) ; between the right pair, a 'loop standard' (? xxix). Over a walking quadruped in miniature is the legend: dUTU (2) A-A, 'Sama?, Aya' (the Sun-god and his wife). The scene is of Akkadian origin, as is also the device of the miniature quadruped under the inscription, but the workmanship is of Ur III date or later. 10? (WAG C39.) Plaster impression of cylinder. Two pairs of rampant beasts form antithetic combats. On the left a gaping lion attacks a mouflon ( ?). On the right a gaping Kon with the wings, tail, and hind parts of a bird (? xiv) attacks a victim similar to the one on the left. The muscles on the victims haunches are indicated, while the strokes on their bellies may be ribs or multiple belts (cf. No. 9); the latter being suggested by the fact that the lion on the left is seizing the belt ( ?), and also the victim on the right has a neck belt ( ?) by which he is being seized. The 'neck belt' (or collar) of the left victim is not visible, because the seal was not pressed hard enough when the impression was made. The scene is delimited by the legend: dUTU (2) dA-A, 'Sama?, Aya'. Above is a star in a disk (sun) over a crescent (moon); cf. ? xxv. Between the antithetic groups are a pot (? xx) and a 'loop standard1 (? xxix). The theme and date of execution are the same as for No. 9. 11. (WAG 42.189.) Lapis lazuli cylinder with white quartz veins ; its gold roller is possibly modern. A bearded god wearing a flat cap sits on a covered chair (? xviii). His long robe with bordered top and bottom opens down the front and is suspended from the left shoulder, leaving the right shoulder bare and free. He salutes a bearded, flat-capped worshipper, who returns the salute and wears a robe much like the god's. A flounced-robed goddess, whose divinity is indicated by a many-horned crown, raises her hands in intercession and blessing (? ii). From the mural paintings of Mari2 we now know that the flounced robe was many-coloured. Before the god is an eight-pointed star within a crescent (? xxiv). Inscription: IN-ZU-ZU DUP-SAR (2) DUMU A-AG-GA-NA (3) ?R dN?-IR?-GAL, 'Inzuzu, the scribe, son of Aggan(a), servant of Nergal'. The scene is essentially of Ur III 1 Cf.

GORDON inspiration, but the workmanship may possibly be as late as Babylon I, when the goddess with the raised hands most frequently occurs. 12. (WAG Ci2 = Ci3.) Plaster impression of cylinder. A goddess wear- ing a many-horned crown and a long flounced robe hung from the left shoulder (cf. No. n) is seated on a chair (? xviii) with her feet resting on a low platform, holding a goblet (?) in her right hand. Two men with low, round hats on their heads and wearing long robes suspended from their left shoulders stand before her. The engraver shows clearly that the left arms of the goddess and men are covered to the wrist. The man nearest the goddess folds his hands in reverence, while the other man raises his right hand, hailing the goddess. Before the goddess is a crescent (? xxi) and a squat monkey (cf. No. 44). Between the men is a pot (? xx) and a 'loop standard' (? xxix). Inscription: Du(i)-ma-qum (2) mar na-bi-dEN-ZU (3) warad dMAR-TUy 'Dum?qum ( ?), son of Nabi-Sin, servant of Amurru'. The seal is of an Ur III type, but the workmanship, like the script, may be transitional between Ur III and Babylon I. 13. (WAG 42.437.) Haematite cylinder. Reception scene. A long- bearded god (of 'Amurru' type, see ? 1) stands on the right. He wears a crown of many horns and a long, vertically pleated robe fastened with a triple belt, holds a notched dagger (like that often held by Samas), and rests a foot on a foot-rest. The leg protruding from the opening in the front of the robe shows part of the short undergarment, whose texture is represented by cross- hatching. A cross-hatching with fewer horizontal lines may possibly indicate long stockings. The god receives a long-bearded devotee, wearing a round turban and a dress like the men's in No. 12, who greets the god with a raised hand. Between him and the god is a crescent (? xxi). To the left is the goddess with raised hands (? ii). Inscription: is-me-dEN-ZU (2) mar warad- dEN-ZU (3) wardum sa dEN-ZUy 'Ism?-Sin, son of Warad-Sin, servant of Sin'. Babylon I. 14. (WAG C15.) Plaster impression of cylinder. On the right is 'Amurru' (? i) somewhat different from the portrayal in No. 13. Here he has shoulder protrusions (now known from the Mari mural paintings1) and his dress has crossed shoulder-straps (cf. No. 8) and sleeves to the elbow. He holds a throwing-stick (cf. No. 33) in one hand and a lyre-like object in the other (however, cf. No. 9), and wears a sword by his side. His foot-rest is a miniature beast ( ? turtle or toad ?) which he holds by a cord tied to its mouth (see No. 24). Here 'Amurru' faces front, though his body is in profile. He greets a worshipper dressed in the short Amorite hunting-skirt with a pointed front, the latter holding a stick in one hand. Behind him is the goddess with the raised hands (? ii), with two bracelets visible on her left wrist. It should be noted that here, as in most of these seals (see Nos. 11-19, &amp;c), the shoulders tend to be in front view, even when the rest of the figure is in profile. The only frequent exception is the goddess, whose raised hands forced a different technique on the gem cutters.

The god (? i) is represented as in No. 13; so, too, the worshipper's clothing. Behind the worshipper stands the goddess with raised hands (? ii), and behind her is a man wearing a round turban and a hunting costume (cf. No. 14) and holding a throwing-stick. Perhaps the line hanging from his left elbow is a rope. Behind 'Amurru' is an attendant with a bare, shaven head standing on a double platform and holding a nail (?) in one hand and a basket in the other, and behind him is a throwing-stick. Between the god and worshipper is a four-pointed star in a disk over a crescent (? xxv). Between the worshipper and the goddess is a 'horse-head' standard fixed in the ground. 16. (WAG C14.) Plaster impression of cylinder. Offering scene. On the right is a bearded god holding a ring in his right hand. A bearded devotee in a round turban offers a kid to the god (cf. No. 15). Behind the devotee is another god with folded hands, and behind the latter stands a goddess raising one hand (cf. ? ii). Her face and shoulders are in front view, and she has a curl on either side of the head. All the deities are marked as such by the crown of many horns, and all the four personages wear the flounced robe. The male characters have their right shoulder bare, but both the shoulders of the goddess are covered. Between the characters are the following space- filling symbols : a six-pointed star in a disk over a crescent (? xxv) ; a tortoise ; a human-headed creature with the fore-legs of a lion and the body and tail of a fish, wearing a many-horned crown (body in profile, face front) ; inverted lotus (?, cf. Nos. 105, 119); a human head in profile (? xi); a fish (? x); a gaping lion with fish's tail and body; another fish (?); a human bearded head facing front, and wearing a crown of many horns (? xi); a grinning, grotesque head (of Humbaba?) facing front (? xi). 17. (WAG C6.) Plaster impression of cylinder. Double scene of recep- tion and offering. On the left is a worshipper in a turban and a long gown with rounded corners which opens in front and leaves the right shoulder bare. He offers a kid to 'Amurru' (? i). Between the god and worshipper are a crouching quadruped and a 'loop standard' (? xxix). To the far right is the turbaned devotee of the other scene clasping his hands and wearing a long, simple gown buttoned (?) down the front. He faces a god, who wears a flounced robe and holds up a pot in a holder in one hand and grasps a throwing-stick in the other (cf. no. 14). Between the god and the devotee are a rosette-star (? xxiii) and a lotus (? cf. no. 16), and between the gods' heads is a pot (? xx). All the characters have a knot of hair on the neck. The drill has been used extensively, e.g. on 'Amurru's' foot-rest, the rosette-star, and the stylized horned crowns of both gods. This group of seals (nos. 17-19) is a stylization of classical Babylon I seals (cf. nos. 13-15) and must therefore post-date the latter; perhaps Nos. 17-19 date from the second half of Babylon I.</page><page sequence="10">12 CYRUS H. GORDON 18. (WAG 04 = 05.) Plaster impression of cylinder. Offering scene. 'Amurru' and the worshipper who brings a kid are much the same as in No. 17. The goddess with the raised hands (? ii) has a different appearance here because her gown is simplified to a plain dress with a double hem along the base. Behind 'Amurru' is an attendant (cf. No. 15) with clasped hands, his dress being like that worn by the man on the far right in No. 17. Behind him is Gilgamesh (? v), whose distinguishing features (see No. 8) are preserved in spite of the stylization. In the space are a rosette-star (this time over a crescent), a crouching quadruped, a pot (indicated by two drillings), and a 'loop standard' (with a mace head on either end?), all much as in No. 17. The vertical line of drillings in front of Gilgamesh is difficult (= a stream of water ?*). 19. (WAG C9.) Plaster impression of cylinder. Double scene resembling No. 17. The left pair is a worshipper offering a kid (highly stylized by drill technique) to 'Amurru' (? i) with one hand, and saluting with the other. To the right is the goddess with raised hands (? ii) facing another figure wearing a long, flounced robe. In the space are ? star made by six lines radiating from a central drilling (? xxii), a 'loop standard' (? xxix), and an emblem (between the heads of the left pair) too faint for identification. 20. (WAG C68.) Plaster impression of cylinder. Two deities introduce a worshipper to Adad, the storm-god, each of the three gods being crowned with a pair of horns. Adad wears a double belt (with a short skirt?, cf. No. 23) and stands on a crouching lion, placing one foot on its back and one on its head. He extends a notched sword (?) in his right hand and holds a mace over his shoulder in his left. The introducing deities, who wear flounced robes, raise both hands, and behind them is the worshipper clad and posing like those in Nos. 12 and 13. The space is completely filled by a crescent (? xxi), a 'loop standard' (? xxix), and four 'bandy-legged' men (cf. No. 21), whose bodies are in front view, but their faces in profile. Their round turbans are marked with slanting lines ; their hands are raised as if in boxing ; each wears a double belt, and their genitals hang down prominently between their bent and widely separated knees. 21. (WAG C67.) Plaster impression of cylinder. Three naked men walk in single file, keeping the left hand on the waist. Those on the ends hold something in their right hands, while the one in the middle (whose double belt is visible) salutes by raising his right hand. Behind them is a 'bandy- legged' man like those in No. 20, except that his hands are clasped. Under him is a manikin in a long gown, whose pose is like that of the large central character. All the personages wear caps with slanting markings. 22. (WAG 040 = 041.) This seal is rolled up and down; not from side to side. Gilgamesh's (? v) conventional features are modified, but not obliter- ated by the drill technique (cf. No. 18). What he holds in his hands may be the pendant from his necklace (but cf. No. 18). A devotee, clad in a long dress and saluting with one hand, reaches in height only to Gilgamesh's waist. 1 Cf. Van Buren, Flowing Vase, Berlin, 1933.</page><page sequence="11">WESTERN ASIATIC SEALS IN THE WALTERS ART GALLERY 13 The pole with five dots on either side is a kind of standard or perhaps a stylized tree (?? xvi, xvii). On one side of Gilgamesh is an eight-pointed star (? xxii) much like that in No. 19; on the other is a rosette-star (? xxiii); cf. No. 8. 23. (WAG C72.) Plaster impression of cylinder. Adad stands on the back of a walking humped bull (cf. Nos. 38, 123) and holds the emblem of forked lightning (? xxviii) in one hand and an object of doubtful identity (but cf. No. 24) in the other. He is clad in a short skirt and crowned with a pair of horns (cf. No. 20). A pair of winged lions with bird's hind- quarters (? xiv) stand rampant in antithetic arrangement round an emble- matic pole, which they hold with both fore-paws, and the thinness of the two beasts is a very definite mark of their stylization. The pole, set in earth which is indicated by drillings, is topped by a rosette-star (? xxiii). The bottom of the scene is marked with two rows of dots between three horizontal lines. 24. (WAG C66.) Plaster impression of cylinder. The main scene is a bearded worshipper saluting a god. The god's dress and pose are 'Amurru's' (? i), but his foot-rest is Adad's bull (see No. 23), and he holds Adad's forked lightning (? xxviii) and a cord tied to the bull's mouth or nose (cf. No. 14) in one hand, and a dagger in the other. The subsidiary scene is in two registers separated by a line. Above, a rampant winged lion with bird's hind- quarters (? xiv) attacks a deer from behind and bites his head. Below, a lion is about to bite an antlered stag. 25. (WAG C 17.) Plaster impression of cylinder. A god sits (in Ur III fashion) on a covered chair (? xviii) set on a platform. He wears a round turban and a long robe with heavy, rolled edges, and his position in sitting raises part of the robe, showing a petticoat. This feature is suspicious, because short under-breeches were the fashion (e.g. No. 13). The questionable object in his hand may be due to the counterfeiter's misunderstanding of a disk and crescent over a goblet (cf. No. 29). A shaven-headed worshipper in a long robe stands before the god with clasped hands. The goddess with raised hands (? ii) anachronistically wears a jacket; cf. the jacket of Ahuramazda (? iv) and the 'Achaemenian hero' (? vi). Behind her is the most genuine part of the scene ; to wit, a bull with the emblem of forked lightning (? xxviii) with a fluted handle (cf. No. 9) on his back. A spurious, horned-crowned goddess, whose pose is like 'Amurru's' (? i) offers the bull an ear of corn. This seal is a composite imitation with most of the elements taken from Ur III and Babylon I art. 26. (WAG C20.) Plaster impression of cylinder. A lone figure in profile (crudely engraved with drillings for the globular headgear, eye, cheek, chignon, buttocks, and ankles) raises both hands (three fingers are indicated on each hand) as if blessing the inscription.

GORDON Samsuditana'. The importance of this seal lies in the fact that it is datable to the reign of Samsuditana (c. 1700-1670), the last king of Babylon I. It follows that about his time simple inscribed seals with free space (cf. Kassite seals, passim) were made with the aid of the drill. 27. (WAG C38.) Plaster impression of cylinder. 'Amurru' (?, see ? i), clad in the hunting-costume (see No. 14), is stylized by a late Babylon I technique. The lines on his hat may possibly be intended for simplified crown horns. He holds a mace in his right hand and faces the goddess with the raised hands (? ii). A crescent (? xxi) is between them. Legend: ib-ni- distar (2) mar e-ri-ib-dEN-ZU (3) warad dEN-ZUy 'Ibn?-t?tar, son of Er?b- Sin, servant of Sin'. The free space, the use of the drill (note especially the vertical drilling to show the form of the goddess's torso and leg), the pro- minence of the inscription, &amp;c, point to a date approximately the same as for No. 26. 28. (WAG C19.) Plaster impression of cylinder. The attitude of the character on the left is that of the goddess with the raised hands (? ii). The other two figures are bearded males, the one on the right saluting the other, who carries a throwing-stick. All three wear long gowns and round hats with brims (= stylized horned mitres?; cf. No. 27). The inscription is unin- telligible : AN SU (2) MU MU (3) MU KA MU.1 29. (WAG C 69.) Plaster impression of cylinder. A seated (? xviii) god (on a platform), wearing a long gown and a crown with two pairs of horns, welcomes his worshippers. He holds a cup (?, cf. No. 12) out in his right hand. Behind him is a snake ; before him kneels a manikin in a turban, who salutes the god with an uplifted hand. Behind the manikin two worshippers raise each a hand to greet the god. They wear longish gowns that have rounded edges and an opening in front, their gowns and turbans being marked with slant lines (cf. Nos. 12, 20, &amp;c). In front of the god is a cross (= star?) made by two pairs of parallel lines within a disk over a crescent (? xxv). To the left a man stands before a standard, which is on the back of a crouching quadruped. 30. (WAG C60.) Piaster impression of cylinder. The central figure is Gilgamesh (? v). To the left are animals; to the right, mythical creatures. The upper pair of animals sit antithetically with bodies toward each other, but facing backward, with curved horns, manes, and long ears, and their tails, curiously, have three terminations. Below these animals is a falling gazelle (?). The lower pair is composed of a gaping lion seizing an antlered stag rampant (cf. No. 24). On the upper right is a 'Hathoroid' head between two galloping human-headed bulls (cf. No. 9). Beneath them is a pair of Gilgamesh figures, who are running away from each other in antithetic arrangement. Below are two seated sphinxes (human-headed winged lions; cf. ? xiii) facing each other. To the right is a vertical row of ten human 1 The fact that an inscription is meaningless does not necessarily imply that it is a modern forgery.

Nearly all the animals have triple rings about their necks. The 'Hathoroid' head and the sphinxes betray Egyptian influence. This seal stands between the art of Babylon I and the 'North Syrian'. 31. (WAG 42.428.) Cylinder of vein breccia (probably composed of haematite and jasper). The bearded figure in profile, wearing a low cap and a long gown which opens down the front, raises a hand and faces the inscription (cf. No. 26) which is difficult. Line 1 probably contains the owner's name. Line 2 opens with DUMU (?, = m?r 'son') HU (?). Line 3 seems to read Sa LUGAL(})-ma, 'of the king'( ?). Line 4 is rather clearly a-mi-il, 'man'. Line 5 begins with AN SU (= ili-su 'his god'?). Line 6 is miml-ma ?-ul, 'anything not'. Line 7 looks like i-ma-ad(?)-di(?)-suy 'he will ???him'. Though neither the reading nor the interpretation is clear, the legend seems to be Akkadian (not Sumerian). This seal, with its long inscription and lone figure, is typically Kassite. 32. (WAG 42.490.) Obsidian (or basalt glass ?) cylinder with concave side and ends. A horse or unicorn (? ix) is about to jump on a bird (? viii), and a man much like the one in No. 31 salutes a stylized tree (? xvii). There is also a cluster of trees including a palm, a weeping willow (?), and some shrubs (? xvi). Over the horse (or unicorn ?) is a winged disk (? xxvi) ; under him a shrub. By the stylized tree is a cross duplicated on Kassite monuments.2 33. (WAG C74.) Plaster impression of cylinder. A hunter, naked to the waist, wears a short skirt and shoes. He is about to hurl a throwing-stick at two deer with long, curved horns, antithetically rampant over a thicket (? xvi). Each deer, holding a sprig in its mouth and looking backwards, has a double belt. Between them is a star like that in Nos. 19, 22. The drill is used to show the chest and other features of the hunter, for filling the field, and between the two cuneiform signs: DING IR DIN GIR.2 34. (WAG 42.412.) Haematite cylinder. A long-bearded god, wearing a round turban with slanting markings, sits on a covered chair (? xviii) and holds out a goblet (?) as a gesture of welcome to three deities crowned with a pair of horns, who raise both hands in salute. Only three fingers are indicated on each hand (cf. No. 26). The field is filled with a star in a disk over a crescent (? xxv), an eight-pointed star (? xxii), two 'loop standards' (? xxix), and three dots and two pots (? xx) made with the drill. The auxiliary scene is in two registers. Above, are two deities (like the three in the main scene) standing on either side of a lace-like symbol (= tree?), the one on the left folding his hands, the other saluting him with one hand.

GORDON robe covers one shoulder, while the minor deities are nude to the waist. In all details this is a classical Old Assyrian (= 'Cappadocian') seal. 35. (WAG C71.) Plaster impression of cylinder. A seated god, crowned with a pair of horns and dressed in a long gown, is offered a kid (?) by a man clad like the worshipper in No. 29. A manikin is at the god's feet (cf. No. 29), a plough (?) behind the god's head. Behind the man is a pair of crossed quadrupeds (cf. No. 67), one (at least) of which having horns. A turbaned human head (? xi) is underneath them. Over them stands a bull surrounded by seven drillings above (cf. ? xxvii) and one below it. Under his head is a turbaned human head (? xi). To the right a man (like the other man) stands on a crouching, gaping lion. 36. (WAG C57.) Plaster impression of cylinder. Presentation scene. A bearded god, wearing a turban with slanting markings and a flounced robe supported by shoulder-straps, sits on a chair (? xviii) holding a palm branch ( ? ; cf. No. 37) on his shoulder with his left hand. He welcomes his company by raising his right hand (with a goblet?). A seated manikin plays a lyre at the god's feet. The manikin wears a turban like that of the god and a long robe with a decorated top edge which leaves the right shoulder bare. A goddess, in a short dress (held up by shoulder-straps) and horned mitre (convention- alized to a 'top-hat'; cf. Nos. 39, 55), holds up an elongated emblem in each hand (the emblem on the right has two short protrusions at right angles to the main shaft) and introduces a long-haired woman (= figure on left in No. 29), with a gown like that of the manikin, to the god. An eight-pointed star over a crescent (? xxiv) and a 'loop standard' (? xxix) are in the field. The ancillary scene is the nude goddess standing on a bull's back. Her head and feet are in profile as in Nos. 38-40. She wears a belt and a V-necklace. Her puden- dum is accentuated, and she holds open a veil (or garland ?). Above her are a bird (? viii) (cf. the doves of Venus?), a human head (? xi), and an 'eye' (? xxx), which may actually be the female pudendum. The hats of the god and manikin have slanting markings. This seal is in some respects transitional between Babylon I and 'North Mesopotamian/Syrian' art. 37. (WAG 42.408.) Haematite cylinder. A long-haired woman holding a reed (fan) sits on a curved, low-backed chair (? xviii) set on a plain platform. Note the attempt at perspective, whereby three legs of the chair are depicted. The woman is dressed in a long robe with fringed neck and base and an opening down the front (or side ?). Behind her is a bearded attendant in a long gown which opens down the front where the edge is decorated so as to appear like a series of triangles. The top is fringed and a shoulder is left bare; cf. also the woman's dress. Before the woman is another woman in a long dress (its lower border like that of the first woman's robe) offering her a small, one- eared jug pointed at the base. In the field are an eight-pointed star (? xxii), a partly effaced elongated object, a 'loop standard' (? xxix), an ankh sign (? xxx), a hare's head ( ? ; cf. ? xi), and a smaller hare's head (?). The minor scene is in three registers separated from one another by lines. Above are two birds (? viii) flying antithetically on either side of an ankh sign. In the</page><page sequence="15">WESTERN ASIATIC SEALS IN THE WALTERS ART GALLERY 17 middle is a twisted rope design (? xxxiii). Below is a sitting sphinx (? xiii), over whose back is a hare's head (?). The jug, which can be placed about ?1600 B.c., dates the seal roughly. 38. (WAG 42.450.) Haematite cylinder. The nude goddess (? iii) stands on a humped bull's back (cf. 23, 123) and faces two male persons who approach her from opposite directions. Her representation as a 'Janus' is doubtless conceptual, for she is known to have but one face (see Nos. 36, 39, 40). As usual, in 'North Syrian' art, she holds open her veil (or garland?). To the left is a long-bearded hero, wearing only a pointed, horned crown and a short fringed skirt, his hair falling on his back in a long queue. He holds up a stick in his right hand and grasps an adze (?) in his left. Behind him is the goddess with the raised hands (? ii), whose stylized many-horned crown approximates a 'top-hat'. To the right is a bearded character clad in the costume regularly worn by men in these North Syrian seals ; to wit, a robe reaching below the knees, opening in front (showing the underkilts), with well-rounded edges, and prominently fringed below and also above where one shoulder is bare ; the hat is the round turban, in this case with slanting markings. The subsidiary scene is two manikins in profile (one raising a hand), wearing only long flounced skirts held up by double belts, who are separated by a twisted rope design (? xxxiii) from the flying bird (? viii) below. In the space are an ankh sign (? xxxi), a crescent (? xxi), a cross in a disk over a crescent (cf. ? xxv) and two stars (? xxii). Above and below are borders of twisted rope with a dot in each loop and a single line (cf. Nos. 39, 41, 45, 48) on either side of the rope design. 39. (WAG C52.) Plaster impression of cylinder. On the left is a god in a short skirt, who carries a mace in one hand and in the other extends a bow to a goddess. The latter wears a long flounced skirt and welcomes the god by raising a hand (cf. ? ii and No. 16). Both have the 'top-hat' conventional- ization of the horned crown (see Nos. 36, 38). Between them appears an altar (? xix) with cakes (?). The nude goddess (? iii) stands on the right. All three characters seem to have necklaces. The auxiliary scene is three march- ing, short-skirted manikins over three dotted twists of rope (? xxxiii) above a lion pouncing on a sitting animal which looks backwards. 40. (WAG 42.407.) Haematite cylinder. The central figure is the nude goddess (? iii). Two persons approach her, one on either side (cf. No. 38), the one on the left, whom she faces, wearing a conoidal, horned crown and a short dress. He hails the goddess with one hand and the artist, with con- summate lack of skill, has him holding a crooked staff in the other. On the right is a bare-headed man in a short dress (both short dresses have a triple border below; cf. in No. 39). He holds an elongated object with a peculiar crest (= snake or lotus?), and in the field are an animal's head (? xi), a hand (?, cf. Nos. 41, 46), and a lotus. The subsidiary scene is a crouching griffin (? xv) over a manikin, the latter being like those in No. 38, and his fingers, of which only the thumbs and index fingers are shown, because of the per- spective, are disproportionally large.</page><page sequence="16">i8 CYRUS H.

His (?) dress is long, with vertical pleats, a double border above the base and a double belt. The dress opens in front showing a heavily corrugated undergarment. He holds a lance in one hand, and behind him stands a small nude goddess (? iii; without veil/garland) in a round turban, holding her breasts. Behind her is a personage (= a beardless man ?) holding a throwing-stick, wearing a round turban and a gown much like that of the figure in No. 38 on the right. Here, however, the gown is somewhat longer, and a double belt is visible and the undergarment is like the winged deity's. On the left is inserted an ancillary scene of a crouching, gaping lion striking a crouching deer (?) with its paw above a twisted rope design (? xxxiii) over a sitting, winged sphinx (? xiii). To the left, but belong- ing to the main scene, is the goddess with the raised hands (? ii). All the large characters wear double necklaces. In the space are a hand and a large pole- standard. 42. (WAG 42.424.) Haematite cylinder. Introduction scene. A bearded god, wearing a many-horned tiara and a long robe (with fringed top and bottom) which leaves the right shoulder bare, sits on a low-backed, curved chair (? xviii). The god extends a goblet (?) in welcome. The introducer is represented conceptually as a 'Janus' (see No. 38) so as to face both parties but, unlike the goddess in No. 38, his feet point in opposite directions. He is bearded, wears a long, belted skirt with a fringed base, and holds a staff in each hand. The introduced character has wings like those in No. 41, a horned crown, and a double-belted skirt reaching below the knees. The upper part of the skirt has horizontal pleats and the lower, vertical pleats, the skirt opening in front to show the undergarment. He extends his right hand to salute the seated god and holds a short club (?) in his left. In front of the god are a disk over a crescent (cf. No. 61) and an altar (? xix) with cakes (?). 43. (WAG C56.) Plaster impression of cylinder. A god welcomes a man. The god is on a throne (? xviii) which has a lion's legs, and both the throne and the god's foot-rest are on a platform (for the god's dress, see Nos. 11, 12; for his turban, No. 11). He holds a crooked staff, and before him stands a long-horned wild goat rampant, looking backward. The horns are bound by two double bands (signifying that the animal is to be seized by the horns in combat ?), and behind it is a man like the one to the right in No. 38. A bracelet is on the wrist of his right hand raised to salute the god. Note also his necklace. The subsidiary scene portrays two running hares (?) above, and a gaping lion about to strike an antlered stag below. All the animals except the stag are marked with many rings round the neck, and in the case of the lion they represent the heavy mane. In the instance of the goat they are the collar by which the man holds him. 44. (WAG C70.) Plaster impression of cylinder. In the cartouche is a short-haired hero with wings (cf. No. 41) who wears a short skirt. Before him is a squat monkey (see No. 12), and behind him a 'loop standard'</page><page sequence="17">WESTERN ASIATIC SEALS IN THE WALTERS ART GALLERY 19 (? xxix).

To the right is a woman with long hair (as in Nos. 29, 36), wearing a long, flounced skirt and raising one hand (cf. No. 39). All the skirts have vertical pleats. In the field are a disk in a crescent (see No. 42), a flying bird (? viii), an eight-pointed star (? xxii), and an ankh-sign (? xxxi). All the figures and symbols are arranged with unusual symmetry. 45. (WAG 42.414.) Haematite cylinder. On both sides of a tripod altar (? xix) with cakes on it stand men in long gowns, fringed at the top and base and leaving one shoulder bare. Each man folds his hands. (Their heads are somewhat reminiscent of those of Ikhnaton's period.) To the right is a long- haired woman holding a fan (?). Her left hand is unnaturally elongated to the ground (cf. manikin in No. 40), and in front of her is an incense burner. In the field over the cakes are a three-line symbol, an eight-pointed star (? xxii), and a crescent (? xxi). The ancillary scene is a sitting griffin (? xv) raising a fore-paw over a twisted rope (? xxxiii) above another sitting griffin. 46. (WAG 42.410.) Haematite cylinder. Banquet scene. Two beardless men in long robes sit in chairs like those in Nos. 37, 42 and hold cups. Between them is an 'hour-glass' table (? xix) with cakes. The subsidiary scene is three long-skirted manikins (the first holds a staff) standing under a winged, tailed disk (? xxvi) beneath two hands. 47. (WAG 42.406.) Haematite cylinder. Offering scene. A bearded man dressed in a short skirt carries a kid on his shoulders to a nude goddess (? iii; without veil/garland as in No. 41), wearing a double necklace and double bands above the knees, and folding her hands. The toes of her shoes are turned up as in No. 38 and many Hittite monuments (and as in modern Anatolia and Kurdistan), and her hair is tied in a knot. Behind her is a bearded man lifting one hand and wearing a long robe which opens down the front and has rounded, fringed edges. The curved line near him is probably one end of his belt. Touching the top of the goddess's head is a winged disk (? xxvi), and in the field are two ankh-signs (? xxxi). The auxiliary scene is two winged sphinxes (? xiii), facing one another, over four long- skirted manikins, the first of whom raises one hand. Their skirts have fringed bases. 48. (WAG 42.411.) Haematite cylinder. Two men wearing long, belted skirts which open in front kneel on platforms (like that in No. 43) and hold standards on either side of a stylized tree (? xvii), which is topped by a winged, crossed disk (? xxvi). A bird (? viii) with spread wings is on either side of the base of the tree. The subsidiary motif which overlaps the main scene con- sists of a flying bird and a galloping quadruped separated by a line, over a twisted rope (? xxxiii) above a winged quadruped. 49.

Both characters wear round turbans. The parallel scene has two fighting lions with manes as in No. 43, one having a fore-paw on the head of the other which is about to spring. On the back of each lion kneels a winged, human-bodied (? xii) genius, the necks of both being maned like the lions. The one on the left has a lion's head, but the details of the other's head are not clear. The left one wears a long skirt which opens in front and has a fringed border. He folds his hands. The one on the right wears a long, belted, vertically pleated skirt opening down the front and suspended from a shoulder strap. He lifts one hand toward the stylized tree (? xvii). 50. (WAG C51.) Plaster impression of cylinder. The main scene con- sists of two nude figures holding a conventionalized tree ( ? ; cf. ?? xvi, xvii). The extensive use of the drill has greatly affected the style of this artistically inferior seal. Three dots form the foliage and one dot marks the base of the tree (?). The (female?) figure on the left has a full head of hair gathered on the top and the back of the head. The (male ?) figure on the right is kneeling, and his coiffure is designated by three dots on the top of his head. The ancillary theme consists of six overlapping double circles and a distorted lion ( ?) biting its prey. In the space are five dots. 51. (WAG C53.) Plaster impression of cylinder. A wild goat, couchant and looking backward, is attacked from before and behind by two lions. Above are eight dotted circles connected by lines (the use of dotted circles distinguishes the North Mesopotamian sub-group Nos. 50-4). Between the registers, and overlapping the repeated scenes, is a griffin (? xv). Dotted circles represent the eyes of all the animals, and jaws, knees, paws, hooves, ends of tails, &amp;c, are indicated by dots. In the field are a straight-horned animal's head (? xi), one (or two ?) fish (? x), a dotted circle, and many dots of varying size. 52. (WAG C54.) Plaster impression of cylinder. A bearded hero, wearing a long, vertically pleated dress and a round turban, holds a staff. Over his head are a flying bird (? viii), a fish (? x), and (by the latter) six dots forming a ?\ Under his staff is a rosette-star (? xxiii). The other scene is in three registers : above, a griffin (? xv) is about to attack a wild goat ; below, a lion is pouncing on another goat, the two groups running in opposite directions. In both cases the prey looks backwards (cf. passim). The middle register is the connected, dotted-circle design as in Nos. 51, 53. There is some overlapping of the scenes ; note the staff, rosette-star, bird, and ' Y' ; cf. No. 51. 53. (WAG C55.) Plaster impression of cylinder. 'Amurru' (stylized; see ? i) receives a worshipper. With 'Amurru's' emblem, cf. that in No. 14. The worshipper, who is clad much like the man in No. 41 (though the artist here gives much less detail), raises one hand to hail the god. By his neck are</page><page sequence="19">WESTERN ASIATIC SEALS IN THE WALTERS ART GALLERY 21 two tassels, and to the left stands the mediating priest (?) with folded hands, wearing a long robe which covers one shoulder. In the space is the head of a long-horned animal (cf. No. 51). The intrusive scene (cf. No. 41) in three registers consists of a griffin (? xv) over six connected dotted circles above a lion (or mastiff?) ; cf. No. 52. It is interesting to note that the lion is portrayed with two forelegs and one hind leg (see also griffin in No. 52 and left lion in No. 54). The combined scenes are delimited by a pot and 'loop standard' (cf. No. 10). 54. (WAG 42.488.) Cylinder of vein breccia ( = jasper in milky quartz with minor impurities). Two lions (note ring-manes as in No. 49) attack a wild goat (as in No. 51). A god, whose dress and pose are like 'Amurru's' (? i), stands on the back of one of the lions. (Theindividual horns of the god's crown are visible on close examination; contrast No. 53.) The symbol in the god's hand (cf. Nos. 14, 53) has here become tree-like. In the other hand he holds a throwing-stick (see Nos. 14, 28, &amp;c). Over a ladder design (cf. No. 34) with a dot in each section is a tree (?? xvi, xvii) with a wild goat rampant on each side. The god overlaps both registers (see No. 51). To the left is the goddess with the raised hands (? ii). Inscription: dIM-MU- A[D(i)]-AN (2) mar Aa-sur-BE (3) warad das-s?[r](?)y 'Adad-???[ ], son of Assur-b?l(?), servant of Assu[r](?)'. It appears that the inscription (of which the reading is not certain) preceded the engraving of the scene and the hind- quarters of a lion have been cut over part of the S?R-sign in line 3. 55. (WAG C61.) Plaster impression of cylinder. Two figures in long flounced robes sit facing each other on the humps of a Bactrian camel. This is probably the earliest known clear occurrence of the two-humped camel in art, and we may now assume the animal in Moortgat, Bergv?lker, pi. xi, No. 2 to be the Bactrian camel. This animal was new to the artist and hence the clumsiness of representation. The person sitting on the right holds up a cup. Under each foot of the camel is a snake. The camel seems to be tied by his mouth to the tail of a sitting lion which is striking the lion vanquished by Gilgamesh (? v) who locks the tail and one rear leg of his victim with both arms, holding up its hind quarters. He also has a scissors hold on the beast's head, and the combined grips enable him to twist the lion's body. A winged god (? xii) clad as in No. 42 looks on. A close examina- tion of his tiara shows that it is not a 'top-hat', but the many-horned crown, the individual horns being visible. The bowman over the camel's head wears only a double belt, and his hair is like that of the short-haired figures in Nos. 38-40, &amp;c. The crowded field also contains a winged, tailed disk (? xxvi), a walking, humped bull (cf. Nos. 23, 38, 123); a running, long- horned wild goat; a scorpion (cf. Nos. 34, 75, 98), three 'eyes' (? xxx), a dot and a lance-head (?). 56. (WAG 42.492.) Haematite scaraboid. A pair of chimera-sphinxes,1 wearing 'aprons', face each other. Above their gaping leonine heads are superimposed human heads with the conventionalized horned crown (cf. Cf. Hogarth, Carchemish, ?, 1914, pi. ?. 14.</page><page sequence="20">22 CYRUS H. GORDON No. 55) and chignon, and in the space are two dots and a circle (= sun disk?).1 57. (WAG 42.232.) Paste cylinder. On the left is a winged human-headed (?) quadruped (cf. No. 56; contemporaneous?), a lion (?) biting its tail. Behind the lion (?) is a long-horned wild goat. The field is filled with drillings. Above and below are identical borders, each composed of three horizontal lines with short slant lines between the two outer horizontals. 58. (WAG 42.532.) Steatite stamp (not fully pierced) in gold frame. A large, long-necked, winged quadruped faces a smaller deer with curving horns. The space is filled with objects of doubtful identity; e.g. an animal head (?, see ? xi) over the winged beast, a scorpion (?, see No. 55) over the deer, &amp;c. Th? deep cutting is similar to No. 57 (contemporary?). 59. (WAG C59.) Plaster impression of cylinder. A bull's head (? xi), with a dot over it, faces to the front. Under it is a rampant quadruped, look- ing backward and leaping off the ground (cf. No. 6). Under the figure to the right is a double 'S' (see Nos. 62, 66) and to the right is a rampant, long- horned deer looking backward (Nos. 43, 66). Next is a winged genius (? xii) with an animal's (ass's?) head standing over three contiguous dotted circles. To the right is a lion of the type in Nos. 51-4. Over him is a rosette-star (? xxiii). Above this is another (smaller) bull's head. A personage wearing a knee-length skirt touches both bulls' heads. All three anthropomorphic characters stand with body in front view, but with head and feet in profile. Their elbows are unnaturally rounded and on either side their hands touch the nearest animal or animal head. All three characters seem to have high heels. In the space are what look like a crescent (cf. ? xxi), a double crescent, and an inverted animal head. The scene is bordered above and below with a single line (cf. 60-3, 65, &amp;c). 60. (WAG 42.415.) Cylinder of black stone; gold tips probably faked. Two women sit on chairs (? xviii) with their knees drawn up and their legs apart. They hold something (flower? and sword?) in each hand. Between them, and touching the objects in their nearer hands, is a winged man (? xii) wearing a very short costume, his body being portrayed in front view, but his head and feet in profile (cf. Nos. 59, 64, &amp;c). Bordering the scene is a deer (or goat?) rampant looking backwards (for its body markings, cf. No. 62). Under it is an inverted ox-head (? xi) and over it a four-pointed symbol. Under one of the feet of one of the women is a rosette- star (? xxiii). 61. (WAG 42.423.) Cylinder of black stone. There are two pairs of people facing one another. Between one pair is an ibex, standing on its forelegs, and above its hind legs is a disk over a crescent (cf. No. 42). To the right is a figure in a long flounced skirt with a wing (? ; cf. ? xii) springing from his left shoulder, and he faces a man (in a long belted gown with vertical pleats), on whose left is a flying bird (? viii) over a rampant deer that looks 1 [Herzfeld is probably right in interpreting each 'chimera* as a combination of an entire winged man (wearing a dress) and a lion with forelegs out front.]</page><page sequence="21">WESTERN ASIATIC SEALS IN THE WALTERS ART GALLERY 23 backward (see Nos. 59, 60, &amp;c). The right figure of the other pair wears a long belted gown and has a wing (?) springing from his right shoulder. He faces a person in a belted dress, the front part of which ends above the knee while the back is long in swallow-tail fashion. Lines on either side and below his dress may indicate a cape. Behind him is an elongated object (sword?). All the characters have hair of about shoulder length. 62. (WAG 42.422.) Cylinder of shining black stone (?). There are two wasp-waisted, triangle-chested men with body in front view, but head and feet in profile (cf. Nos. 59, 60, 64, &amp;c). One of them holds a long-horned deer and a donkey (?; cf. No. 66) upside down. One man has a hair-band flying loose. Alongside the other is a triple cross ( = star?; cf. ? xxii) and what may be the head of a horned animal (? xi) conventionalized as an 'S' (cf. Nos. 59, 66). The drill is used for the men's palms, the heads, jaws, and hooves of the animals and for the space-filling dots. The attitudes (cf. the elbows in No. 59), body markings (cf. No. 59), the continuousness of the scene (Nos. 63, 64), the workmanship and general style all indicate one and the same provenance and date for this group. 63. (WAG C76.) Plaster impression of cylinder. A row of (female?) genii holding hands, facing frontwise. As usual the artist does not know how to represent feet in the front view and so here he has the genii standing in what I am compelled colloquially to call a 'Charlie Chaplin' style (cf. No. 42). The genii wear small knobbed crowns and have animal ears, horns, and wings (set high on the shoulders; cf. ? xii). Their gowns are long and have tight belts and a seam down the front, the sleeves of elbow length being very full. Between every two genii is a rosette-star (? xxiii). Below each pair of clasped hands is a head of a similar genius (? xi) on a long neck. The artist has engraved four identical groups, whereas he could have obtained the same effect by a single group to be repeated by rolling (cf. No. 64). 64. (WAG 42.433.) Bone cylinder. Two men, with their bodies frontwise, but heads and feet in profile (as in Nos. 59, 60, 62), hold a kid between them on either side. They are clad in long, belted gowns, of which the upper part is marked vertically and the lower part has slanting lines. The intervening space is free. The continuous frieze effect could have been obtained by one group instead of two (cf. No. 63). The shallow cutting is reminiscent of many Middle Assyrian seals such as No. 76 (contemporary?). [Herzfeld considers this seal a fake.] 65. (WAG 42.421.) Cylinder of same material as in No. 62. Two human figures are clad in long dresses with vertically marked shirts and horizontally marked skirts with two double seams down the front. Their pose is like that in No. 62. Their feet are quite large, they have hair-bands flying loose (cf. No. 62), and they hold hands. Between them is a griffin (? xv) courant, of which the near wing is shown below and the far wing above. This crude perspective is duplicated in the related No. 66. The seal is calcu- lated to give a continuous frieze effect (cf. Nos. 62-4). 66. (WAG C62.) Plaster impression of cylinder. There is a griffin like</page><page sequence="22">24 CYRUS H. GORDON that in No. 65, with its beak open. Behind it is a rearing donkey looking backward. Between them is the head of an animal with long horns, in the shape of an 'S' (cf. Nos. 59, 62). Under the donkey's forelegs is an adze- like object. Facing the donkey is an ibex, in front of which is an aquatic bird's head and under which is a donkey's (?) head (? xi) over two dotted twists of rope (? xxxiii). The ibex, donkey's head, and rope in three regis- ters are parallel to subsidiary scenes in the roughly contemporary 'North Syrian' seals. The way in which the donkey overlaps both scenes is to be compared with Nos. 52-4, &amp;c. 67. (WAG C27.) Plaster impression of cylinder. On the left is a man in profile carrying a mace on his shoulder. His shoes come above his ankles, he has bands ( ? ; see No. 47) above the knee, and he wears a short skirt with a triple belt, his double-bordered sleeves not quite reaching his elbows. Between his legs is a rosette-star (? xxiii), and before him is a vertical register of dotted twisted rope (?xxxiii), and then come two crossed lions supported by a stand. To the right is a man with his body facing to the front, but his head and feet in profile (see Nos. 59, 60, 64, 65) holding two quadrupeds rampant. The upper part of the left quadruped is obliterated, but the one on the right, which has wings and horns, is preserved all but the head. Under the latter beast is a ram's head (? xi) lying on its side, while above the beast is a running (not rising?for ruminants rise on the rear legs first) ibex (?). Between the heads of the men is a West Mediterranean (Aegean/Mycenean) inscription. 68. (WAG 42.496.) Cylinder of dark brown stone with (modern ?) gold tips. Two men in long robes stand on either side of a spear (cf. No. 34). Two winged sphinxes (? xiii) sit facing each other; over them is a spread eagle (? viii). Over the left sphinx is what may be a plough. In the space are several drillings and lines, the drill having been used extensively. 69. (WAG 57.1512) is the original Tarkondemos (Tarkummuwa?) seal; see Archiv Orient?lni, ix, pi. xxvi (opposite p. no). 70. (WAG 42.352.) Haematite stamp. While pictures of this seal have been published, none of them is clear,1 and our photograph is therefore of importance to Hittitologists. (I have consulted the well-known specialist in Hittite hieroglyphs, Dr. P. Meriggi, on Nos. 70-2, and he has kindly con- sented to my using the contents of his letter [dated May 30th, 1938] on con- dition that I state explicitly that virtually all readings must be regarded as tentative in view of our faulty knowledge at present. The interpretations of Nos. 70-2 are Meriggi 's, but I alone am responsible for any errors.) The first sign in the inner circle (at the top), hitherto misread as ha-r, now proves to be No. 346 of Meriggi, 'Listes des hi?rogl. hitt.' (Revue Hittite et Asianique, fase. 27, 1937, 85). To the right (to be read before the left in these seals, cf. No. 71) is nu/no over ffl (which means something like 'reign', see Listes, no). The outer ring contains many otherwise unknown signs, some of which may be (1) an older stage of the writing (before 1600), (2) archaizing forms of a later period, or quite possibly (3) not actually writing (e.g., the enthroned 1 See Hogarth, Hittite Seals, Oxford, 1920, 75, fig. 79.</page><page sequence="23">WESTERN ASIATIC SEALS IN THE WALTERS ART GALLERY 25 figure holding a sceptre). Though the figures face right, they follow each other from right to left. The first sign is probably m royal seal (?). Then, after the enthroned man with the sceptre, comes an animal sign (perhaps No. 124 of the Listes) which may begin the name of a city, for it is followed by the determinative ? city. The next sign, A great king, indicates that this is a royal seal dating from Hittite domination prior to 1200. Near the end of the legend the determinative for city occurs twice more, in the first instance under @ ( = an older form of @ ru ?). Before that is e and before that, la. Most of the other signs are not otherwise known; e.g. the three vessels (Listes, Nos. 338 a, 347 a, and 406 a, which is now to be corrected according to our photograph). 71. (WAG 52.264.) Brass (?) stamp. The inscription begins with the sign, apparently pd-r, between the two triangles, which are read lu(wa) seal. Then come the three strokes that serve as the ideogram for '3' or 'lord'; lord (to be read muwai) is indicated here. The third sign, at the bottom, is li (picture of a knife). To the right, under lu(wa) is pa (Listes, No. 176, hither- to virtually limited to the older inscription from Topada [eleventh century ?]). For the combination lu-pa (to the right), cf. Listes, 107. The last sign, under the left lu(wa), cannot yet be identified. Conjecturally, P?-r-..-il is a personal name, and if so, of a private individual, for no title is given. 72. (WAG 57.1513.) Iron (?) stamp. The three human figures among the twisted rope (? xxxiii) and spiral designs are not writing. The attitude of the standing man seems to be that of prayer, and therefore the seal may refer to a religious (not political) body or individual. The inner circle contains writing that is unfortunately not well preserved. 73. (WAG 54.2206.) Brass (?) stamp. Two walking quadrupeds are placed feet to feet. Seven dots are drilled around the edge (cf. ? xxvii). 74. (WAG 54.2207.) Brass (?) stamp. The central figure is a running deer (note curved horn and cloven hooves). In the field are the head of a bird with a curved beak on a long neck, a circle, and several crescents. 75. (WAG C75.) Plaster impression of cylinder. The scene includes three nude people, five standing quadrupeds, a scorpion (see Nos. 55, 58), a bird (?; cf. ? viii), a lotus (see Nos. 40, 105, 119), a six-pointed star, and two encircled five-pointed stars (? xxii). There is an attempt at composition; e.g. the n\an on the right is between and over antithetic animals and stars respectively, and, if the seal is inverted there is a somewhat similar antithetic arrangement around the group of two men. The workmanship is, however, so poor that the attempt is rather futile, and the piece has little artistic appeal.1 While the provenance may be either Syrian or Anatolian, the date is fixed roughly by a similar seal from level C at Tell Beit Mirsim (thirteenth century) ; cf. Albright, Annual of the American Schools of Oriental Research, xvii, 1938, pi. 33 and ? 80. 1 Cf. L. Delaporte, Catalogue du Mus?e Guimet: Cylindres orientaux, Paris, 1909, Nos. 128-35; R. F. S. Starr, Nuzi, 11, Cambridge (Mass.), 1937, pi. 119 ?.</page><page sequence="24">26 CYRUS H. GORDON 76. (WAG 42.413.) Cylinder of dark brown-stone. In the centre is a winged, tailed disk (? xxvi) over a stylized tree (? xvii; cf. No. 48). The 'antennae' (cf. Nos. 55, 87, &amp;c.) of the disk form a 'frame' round the tree. A bearded man, extending one hand and raising the other, stands on either side (the man on the right seems to be applying a cone for fertilization as in the later Assyrian reliefs). A similar man stands behind each of these and waves a diamond-shaped fan of woven stuff (probably reeds) on a long handle. Each of the four men wears a hat that may be described as a low fez and has a shock of hair falling on the shoulders. Their dresses are long, belted, short-sleeved, and fringed at the base and along the diagonal fold, and in three instances their swords may be seen, worn at their sides. The scene is limited by a crescent (? xxi) over a tree-like standard, and above is a herring-bone border. The seal is quite shallowly cut, as is characteristic of many Middle Assyrian seals. 77. (WAG 42.363.) Conoid stamp of light-weight blackish stone. Two large and two small stylized ibex are engraved in antithetic arrangement. This and No. 78 come from Syria-Palestine of the early first millennium. 78. (WAG 42.362.) Conoid stamp of volcanic tufa (lava). Two ibex with curved, notched horns are portrayed, one being about to mount the other which looks backwards. 79. (WAG C32.) Plaster impression of cylinder. Lion hunt. Two men, an archer and a driver, are in a chariot drawn by two horses (note two sets of reins). The archer has wounded one lion with an arrow which pierces its head, while another has been overcome and is being trampled by the steeds. The chariot is quite small and rolls on two six-spoked wheels with the axle nearly at the back of the chariot, and at its side is a spear set in a socket and also a quiver. The men, who wear only skirts and double belts, are bearded and their locks are gathered into a chignon. The horses are harnessed at the neck (not at the shoulders as nowadays) and the driver holds the reins short. To save space the artist has drawn the wounded lion just about touch- ing the horses. His attitude is rather human; note the anthropoid effect of the shoulders and forelegs, the paws being virtually hands. Date: ? 1150 B.c. 80. (WAG 42.435.) Cylinder of rose quartz. Presentation scene. A bearded man (a priest?) introduces a bearded, armed dignitary (= Assur?) to a seated goddess, whose high-backed throne has knobbed joints and knobs for decoration at the top and along the back (? xviii). She wears a crown and a long, plaited dress with a fringed base, and with one hand she welcomes the men, the other being stylized into a rosette-star (? xxiii). Before her is a stylized tree (? xvii). The introducer wears a long gown fringed at the base and middle and along the vest-like diagonal fold. The person introduced wears a crown and a long and partly flounced gown with a fringed base. He is equipped with weapons, including a bow, slung over his shoulders (see No. 81) and he holds an arrow in his hand. All the figures have chignons, and each raises one hand and extends the other (for this characteristic posture in Assyrian art, cf. Nos. 81-4). In the field are an eight-pointed star made by</page><page sequence="25">WESTERN ASIATIC SEALS IN THE WALTERS ART GALLERY 27 spokes radiating from a point (? xxii), a crescent (? xxi), two divine symbols (? xxxii), and drilled dots. This group, Nos. 80-4, is executed with much use of the drill. 81. (WAG O7 = C8.) Plaster impression of cylinder. This seal is much like the preceding. A god (Assur?) and a seated goddess are mounted on crouching quadrupeds (the left one has a forked tongue, a scorpion's tail and horns). The goddess's triple belt is clearer here than in No. 80. In this seal the god's pose shows his fringed undergarment, and there is a sword by his side and a mace in his hand. In the field note a bird (if the goddess is Ishtar, cf. the doves of Venus as in No. 36) and some archaic-looking pseudo- cuneiform signs. The scene is delimited by a crescent (? xxi) over free space. 82. (WAG 42.491.) Cylinder of banded (smoky, bluish, and neutral) chalcedony. A goddess sits on a chair (knobbed as in Nos. 80, 81). Her hands, one of which is crudely outlined, are in the characteristic position (see Nos. 80-4). A person stands with opened hands raised before her. To the right is a bearded man (being introduced?), who holds a large fish in either hand and places his foot on a third fish, the scales being brought out by cross-hatching (as is the lining of the fisherman's skirt). As is character- istic in these seals (especially Nos. 80-4), all the figures are represented with chignons. The fisherman's skirt is fringed along the curved edge and opens in front. The field is blank. 83. (WAG 42.451.) Cylinder of smoky chalcedony. This presentation scene has much in common with Nos. 80, 81 ; the chief difference is that here all the persons stand. Two women (or eunuchs ?) stand before the armed god (Assur?), the one on the right having both hands raised. She has a long gown with a fringed base (for the costume of the left woman, see Nos. 80, 81). The god's crown has two pairs of horns, and in this case he holds an axe. The filling for the space is much as in No. 81 (including pseudo-writing). Note also the winged, tailed disk (? xxvi) and the 'eye' (? xxx). 84. (WAG C36.) Plaster impression of cylinder. A bearded character welcomes a beardless person, who wears a sword and a thick belt. Both are clad in long, plain robes. To the right is a 'scorpion man' (above the waist, a bearded man ; below the waist a scorpion-tailed bird ; note the heavy belt ; cf. No. 88), carrying a pot (? xx) by a cord. All three wear round, brimmed turbans. In the field are a crescent (? xxi), two standards (cf. ? xxix), a triangle (= female pudendum i, showing that the beardless character is Ishtar?), three drillings and sibitti (? xxvii). 85. (WAG 42.444.) Cylinder of amethystine quartz. A rampant, scor- pion-tailed, winged, Gilgamesh-headed (? v) lion, the body of which is marked with cross hatching, seizes a rampant steed (? ix) by head and leg. The seal is engraved with more than average neatness of workmanship and design. The field is blank. Inscription: kunuk mMI-N[I]-(2)ia, 'the seal of Silliya'. The legend was inscribed after the scene was engraved ; note how ?[G] is placed at the upper right to make room for the wing. Dated ?1250 B.c. 86. (WAG 42.443.) Cylinder of rose quartz. A man on a galloping steed</page><page sequence="26">28 CYRUS H. GORDON (? ix) hunts an ostrich which looks backward in its flight. The horse is well made except for the head which has rather the appearance of a bird's head. The horse has triple bands round his neck and tail as well as trappings (three triply crossed straps) hanging down, one from the reins and one from each side. The hunter, who wears a sash streaming out behind, and has a full head of hair with a chignon, is about to hurl a lance. The artist shows both wings of the ostrich, the farther one being bent in front of the bird. Artisti- cally this seal is far superior to the famous ostrich seal of Urzana, king of Musasir.1 The inscription is problematic (Elamite?; cf. Weber, Altorien- talische Siegelbilder, Leipzig, 1920, No. 507). 87. (WAG C?o = Cu.) Plaster impression of cylinder. There are two parallel scenes. To the left a man worships (for position of hands, see Nos. 80-4) at a stylized tree (? xvii) that is surmounted by a winged, tailed disk (? xxvi). On the right, a hunter vanquishes a bull (note the musculature) by stepping on a hind knee and pulling back a horn. He holds a throwing-stick and has a dagger in his belt. Both men are bearded and wear long robes with fringed base and front opening. The field is blank. 88-. (WAG C35.) Plaster impression of cylinder. The 'scorpion man' (cf. No. 84) shoots arrows at a winged quadruped which looks back with its mouth open, as it flees on the mountains, two arrows having found their mark in its head and neck. Vegetation is depicted on both sides of the mountains, above which is a crescent (? xxi). Limiting the scene are a six-pointed star (? xxii) above, and a fleeing quadruped looking backwards below. 89. (WAG C21.) Plaster impression of cylinder. A bearded hero stands between two female winged sphinxes rampant (? xiii). He has a sword by his side and wears a plaited shirt, a thick belt, a flounced skirt which opens in front and a short underskirt, and he holds each sphinx by a fore-paw. The divinity of the sphinxes is shown by the horns protruding from the head- dress. The antithetic design is common, with some variation, to Nos. 89-94, 96. The space is blank. The scene is terminated by an Aramaic inscription: Ikpr, '(belonging) to Kapar(a)'. (The name Kapara is known from the Gozan [Tell Hal?f] sculptures.) The writing is like that of the Zinjirli inscriptions of the eighth century. 90. (WAG 42.442.) Cylinder of banded (white, red, and violet) agate. A hero with 'X' wings (? xii) stands between winged sphinxes rampant (? xiii), holding each by a fore-paw. All three have 'bobbed' hair and beards and wear round turbans. The hero wears short underkilts beneath a long robe with a fringed curved opening down the front. The top border, which is also fringed, leaves the right shoulder bare. The sphinxes have triple belts and their legs seem to be those of birds. In re-rolling the scene their tails touch. The space is blank. 91. (WAG 42.440.) Cylinder of green chalcedony. A winged hero (? xii; note skirt, as in? No. 89, and triple belt) stands between rampant sphinxes 1 See now Herzfeld, Archaeologische Mitteilungen aus Iran, ix, 35.</page><page sequence="27">WESTERN ASIATIC SEALS IN THE WALTERS ART GALLERY 29 (? xiii), one male, the other female. The hero's beard and chignon and the male sphinx's beard have three knots each. All but the hero's shoulders are in profile as in all of seals Nos. 89-96 except No. 90, where the wings are in front view, too. The body hair of both sphinxes is marked by lines, and in this and the following seals (Nos. 92-4) the drill has been used considerably. The scene is delimited by a winged, tailed disk (? xxvi ; note 'double mace' on top, as in No. 92, too) over a bird (? viii). 92. (WAG 42.430.) Cylinder of neutral chalcedony. This beautiful seal is remarkable for its clear detail. A kneeling hero (as usual bearded) is between winged steeds rampant (? ix), the three lines on his helmet being perhaps conventionalized horns. His hair falls inseverai curls on his shoulders, and a thick belt supports his vertically pleated skirt which opens in front showing underkilts of similar stuff. The two lines between his legs are probably a dagger worn by his side (see Nos. 84, 87, 95), even though actually the skirt would hide it from view. The horses have their heads turned backwards. In the field are a six-pointed star (? xxii) and a crescent (? xxi). The scene is terminated by a winged disk as in No. 91, by a sibitti (? xxvii), and by an 'eye' (? xxx). In re-rolling the cylinder the tails and hind hooves of the horses touch (cf. No. 89). Above and below is a line. 93. (WAG 42.432.) Cylinder of smoky chalcedony. The hero holds a winged sphinx (? xiii; note horn on crown as in No. 89) by the beard (as in No. 91) and an ostrich (? viii), which claws him, by the neck. The beards and chignons of the hero and sphinx are made with three drillings each, as in No. 91. For the hero's shirt, see No. 89 ; for his gown, No. 90. See No. 86 for the position of the ostrich's wings. In the space are a fish ( ? ; cf. ? ?) and an 'eye' (? xxx). The scene is terminated by a crescent (? xxi). 94. (WAG C37.) Plaster impression of cylinder. A winged hero (as in No. 91, though stylized here by the drill) grapples a rampant quadruped which looks away from him. Behind the hero are a crescent (? xxi), an 'eye' (? xxx), and a fish (?, as in No. 93). The scene is bordered by a (palm?) tree (?xvi)? 95. (WAG C35.) Plaster impression of cylinder. The scene is a lively portrayal of an archer hunting a griffin (? xv). The archer is bearded and has a full head of hair with a chignon, and wears a loin-cloth or short hunting skirt opening in front. A long sword is fixed in his double belt and a quiver is slung over his shoulder, and he kneels as he draws his bow; the griffin with 'X' wings (cf. No. 90) looks back with gaping mouth as it flees rampant. The human appearance of its forelegs and shoulders is reminiscent of No. 79. 96. (WAG C22.) Plaster impression of cylinder. A hero (like that in No. 89) holds a pair of rampant beasts by the neck. The beasts have lions' bodies with the wings and hind legs of a bird. The left one has straight horns. Under an eight-pointed star (? xxii) is a South Arabic inscription: \?mi)rby perhaps to be read 'Arabiyyu, a personal name meaning '(The) Arab'. (Professors Torrey and Obermann of Yale University are inclined</page><page sequence="28">3o CYRUS H. GORDON to read the first letter as m. In a kind communication Dr. Torrey proposes the reading M?rib?, 'pertaining to M?rib [the well-known city]'.)1 97. (WAG 42.431.) Shell cylinder. The atmosphere is supplied by a palm-tree laden with dates and surrounded by smaller plants (? xvi). In the grove, on stools without backs to them (? xvi), sit a woman and a bearded man facing each other. A bearded servant stands between them. All three raise a hand in greeting. The seated people wear flounced robes, while the servant is clad in one with vertical pleats, all the robes being long, covering both shoulders. All three have chignons and turbans. The woman's hat seems rather smaller and more pointed than the men's. In the field are a bird (? viii) and sibitti (? xxvii). This seal is strangely executed and may be a fake. 98. (WAG C33.) Plaster impression of cylinder. A galloping bull (?; or horned steed) is the central figure. Though he is in profile, the artist shows all four legs and both ears, but only one horn (is he therefore a unicorn?). The scorpion (see Nos. 55, 75) in a position to seize him from behind is reminiscent of the later Mithraic art portraying the scorpion seizing the bull's testicles. Also in the field are a crescent (? xxi), sibitti (? xxvii) over a line and dot, an 'eye' (? xxx), a star (? xxii), and two divine symbols (? xxxii) over a fish (? x). 99. (WAG 42.441.) Cylinder of partly greyish, partly brownish chalcedony with convex ends. A hero holds a rampant griffin (with a bird's hinder parts ; ? xv) and winged bull by the foreleg. The hero, in profile but with shoulders frontwise, has wavy hair on his head, beard and chignon, and is naked to the waist. His long skirt, fastened with a belt, has three swallow-tail flounces and is fringed along the front opening and base, the underkilts being fringed along the base. The drill has been used to indicate the genitalia (?) of the beasts, the mane and fore-paws of the griffin, and the calf of the hero's leg. The space is blank (cf. also Nos. 100, 101). 100. (WAG C28.) Plaster impression of cylinder. A hero captures a rampant griffin (? xv) which looks backward in its flight, his coiffure being like that in No. 99. His sleeveless robe hangs from both shoulders and has a low (almost 'V') neck, the curved base and swallow-tail flounces at the hip and knee being fringed; it opens in front showing the fringed underskirt. The hero holds a throwing-stick in his right hand and seizes the griffin's wing with his left. 101. (WAG C29.) Plaster impression of cylinder. A hero vanquishes a bull. His coiffure and dress (except for the angular base of his skirt) are as in No. 100, and, holding a mace in his right hand, he seizes the rampant bull which looks away from him. The beast's ribs and haunch muscles are represented by straight lines and its neck hair is shown by wavy lines. The space is blank. The inscription, which is to be read directly from the seal, is problematic and suspect. The first line reads AD ??? ? A A A BA B[A] ; the second begins with DING IR and ends with ZA. 1 [Professor Rhodokanakis considers 'rby the probable reading.]</page><page sequence="29">WESTERN ASIATIC SEALS IN THE WALTERS ART GALLERY 31 102. (WAG C31.) Plaster impression of cylinder. The only figure is a walking human-headed, winged bull. Like similar genii among the sculptures in Assyrian palaces, this one has a many-horned tiara and the ears of a bull. Lines mark the ribs, and some of the musculature is brought out with the drill. A crescent (? xxi) is the only symbol in the otherwise empty space. The inscription is suspect. Line one begins with sa m dPA-, 'belonging to (a man named) Nabu-?'. The last sign is ANm[e} perhaps to be read same, *heaven' or il?nim[e?] 'gods'. After a partly obliterated sign, line 2 reads MU(i)-NI-IK, which may stand for the personal name Sumu-libsi. After a destroyed sign, line 3 reads dmarduk. 103. (WAG C30.) Plaster impression of cylinder. Ishtar welcomes a devotee ; for their pose, cf. Nos. 80-4. Ishtar, as the war goddess, is encircled with a halo of maces, and another mace hangs from her side. She wears a crown with upright points, and her dress is like that of the man in No. 100, except for her plaited shirt. Her hair falls to her shoulders. The devotee is a woman with long, wavy hair, and her long robe has a plaited top and a checkered section above the fringed base. Between are two vertically pleated sections. The suspect inscription is to be read directly from the seal : SA KI ??? S? (2) LI ??? ???. Date ?700 b.c. 104. (WAG 42.429.) Cylinder of smoky and bluish chalcedony. A bearded man with a full head of hair and chignon, wearing a long, belted, vertically pleated, two-flounced robe with a fringed base, stands with both hands raised in reverence before an altar (? xix), on which a cake (?) is laid. Beyond are two divine symbols (? xxxii) on a stepped platform. Above are a crescent (? xxi) and an eight-pointed star (? xxii). Over a stylized tree (? xvii) is a winged, tailed disk (? xxvi) with finger-like markings on the antennae which suggest that the latter may stand for hands (cf. the 'hand- rays' emanating from the sun-disk of Ikhnaton). 105. (WAG C25.) Plaster impression of cylinder. The devotee is as in No. 104. He reveres Assur (cf. ? i ?) who is depicted to below the waist and set in a crescent. The god is bearded and has a knot of hair falling on his shoulders and wears a knobbed crown (as in Nos. 81, 83). (Note the cord that extends nearly the length of his back.) He raises one hand and holds a staff in the other. Under the crescent is a lotus (cf. Nos. 40, 119) in a semicircle with buds (or tassels?) for ends. To the left is a walking, horned beast (cf. the Ishtar Gate of Babylon) bearing two divine standards (? xxxii). In the field are an eight-pointed star (? xxii) and a knobbed cross (sword?). 106. (WAG C23.) Plaster impression of cylinder. Set in rectangular brackets, outside which is a palm-tree (? xvi), are two 'Achaemenian heroes' (? vi) placed antithetically about a stylized tree (? xvii). They have beards and chignons and wear the cidaris with the Achaemenian dress of pleated pantaloons gathered up the middle, and a jacket. Each raises one hand in reverence and in the other holds a small object (lotus or pomegranate?). Above is a winged, tailed disk (? xxvi). 107. (WAGC24.) Plaster impression of cylinder. Double mythical hunting</page><page sequence="30">32 CYRUS H. GORDON scene. To the right an 'Achaemenian hero' (? vi) grasps a rampant winged lion (? xiv) and holds a dagger ready in his right hand. To the left, enclosed in an oval, is Ahuramazda in Achaemenian garb (see No. 106) (note the buttons on his jacket). Above is a winged, tailed disk (? xxvi). Below, on each side, crouch bearded sphinxes (? xiii) wearing flat caps; on the left sphinx stands an 'Achaemenian hero' with a quiver on his shoulder, about to let fly an arrow at the rampant winged lion which stands on the other sphinx. Both lions have crests and body markings. The drill has been used in making the crests, claws and facial features of the beasts, the details of the heroes' faces and feet, the god's buttons and the object (cf. No. 106) in the god's hands. 108. (WAG 42.445.) Slightly barrel-shaped cylinder of agate. In the centre rectangle are four 'Achaemenian heroes' (? vi) portrayed down to the waist and arranged so as to form an 'X'. There is a scene above, another below and two on the side (the latter to be repeated for symmetry). Above: a kneeling hunter draws his bow to shoot at a bounding long-eared (or horned?) hare (?). The hunter wears a short skirt, opening in front and fastened with a belt (cf. No. 95), and has a beard and chignon. Below: a human-headed bird (see No. 118) raises its hands in adoration of the fire on an altar (? xix). The head is beardless (probably female) and the coiffure is like that of the hunter. Side: (1) two long-horned wild goats stand rampant with necks intertwined (see No. 109), and their tails end in two branches. (2) A bearded man wearing a long robe stands beyond a walking bull and hurls a spear into a rampant lion. 109. (WAG C73.) Plaster impression of cylinder. Two wild goats are intertwined as in No. 108. The panel contains four lines of pseudo-cunei- form signs.1 110. (WAG 42.153.) Scaraboid of incrusted chalcedony. A woman and a bearded man, raising their hands, revere a deity seated on a high, knobbed- backed throne (? xviii). The deity wears a long gown and a fez-like crown and has a chignon, and extends a hand to welcome his devotees. The latter wear long gowns, that of the man having fringes along the base and the swallow-tail flounce, and that of the woman slanting pleats. A crescent (? xxi) and a six-pointed star (? xxii) are in the field. Under the scene are two lines. 111. (WAG C43.) Plaster impression of stamp seal. A man (as in No. no) raises his hands to worship the two divine symbols which are set on a crouching beast's back (? xxxii). Above is a crescent (? xxi); below, a line. 112. (WAG C44.) Plaster impression of stamp. A man (as in Nos. no, in) stands before a flourishing (olive?) tree (? xvi). To the right is a palm- tree with a small plant on either side (cf. No. 97). Between the trees is a divine symbol (cf. ? xxxii). Beneath is a line. 113. (WAG C42.) Plaster impression of stamp. This crudely engraved scene shows a long-robed worshipper raising a hand in adoration of a stylized tree (? xvii), over which is a winged disk (? xxvi). 1 Cf. L. Delaporte, Catalogue des Cylindres (Louvre), p, 1923, pi. 94, No. 7.</page><page sequence="31">WESTERN ASIATIC SEALS IN THE WALTERS ART GALLERY 33 114. (WAG 42.446.) Conoid stamp of bluish banded chalcedony. A hunter with a wavy chignon, beard, and thick hair, wears a long dress, opening in front and fastened with a double belt, and having a sword by his side. With one hand he plunges a dagger into the belly of a rampant, gaping, crested, winged lion, the throat of which he grasps (see No. 107). 115. (WAG 42.489.) Stamp of bluish chalcedony. A bearded hunter (coiffure as in No. 114), in a short skirt with a fringe down the centre, has a throwing-stick ready in his right hand, as he seizes with his left a notched- horned ibex which looks away from him. In the field are an 'eye' (? xxx) and the cuneiform sign DINGIR, 'god' (to be read directly from the seal as in Nos. 101, 103). 116. (WAG C48.) Plaster impression of stamp seal. The scene is like Nos. 114, 115, 122. The hunter (coiffure as in Nos. 114, 115, &amp;c; dress as in No. 100, &amp;c.) is armed with a bow and quiver on his shoulder and a throwing-stick in his right hand. With his left he holds a hairy deer (?) which looks away from him as it kicks its captor (cf. Nos. 93, 122). In the field are an eight-pointed star (? xxii), an 'eye' (? xxx) and a cross with a circle on top (cf. Nos. 105, 118). 117. (WAG C47.) Plaster impression of stamp. Two characters wearing hats greet each other with both hands raised, both wearing long gowns with a fringed base. The one on the left has a double belt; the line behind him may represent a cape. The dot on his shoulder is the end of his hair. The drill has been used to indicate their cheeks, and ankles, the centre of the eight-pointed star (? xxii), the dots in the field, &amp;c. 118. (WAG C46.) Plaster impression of stamp. The creature is a human- headed, scorpion-tailed bird. Before it is a cross with a circular top (as in Nos. 105, 116) and above it a crescent (? xxi). 119. (WAG 42.447.) Stamp of milky chalcedony; base and two sides engraved. Base : on the right is a bearded hero with a chignon and wearing a low, conical cap. He holds one hand up and the other down. To the left is a gaping, horned animal-headed genius holding up a rod in one hand, clenching a mace in the other and wearing a sword by his side. Both wear knee-length dresses with weapons fixed in their belts. Side 1 (adoration of Assur) and side 2 (two divine symbols) contain between them most of what is in No. 105. The artist has made full use of the drill. 120. (WAG 42.448.) Scaraboid of light, banded chalcedony. Scene like Nos. 89-93. The hero, wearing a short skirt with a sword fixed in his belt, stands between gaping, rampant lions, holding each by a fore-paw. The line-border round the scene is discontinued for the length of the lions' tails. 121. (WAG 42.439.) Stamp of incrusted chalcedony. On either side of a tree is a fleecy ram (? xvi). They are in profile except for their curved horns, which are in front view. 122. (WAG 42.154.) Stamp of colourless and tan chalcedony. Scene like Nos. 114-16. An 'Achaemenian hero' (? vi), with a dagger ready in his right</page><page sequence="32">34 CYRUS H. GORDON hand, seizes the throat of a winged lion (? xiv) which claws him with a hind paw (cf. Nos. 93, 116). 123. (WAG 42.438?) Stamp of Chrysoprase (?). A buffalo, with shaggy hair on its belly, neck, and hump, stands in profile (except for the horns; cf. No. 121). A crescent (? xxi) and a six-pointed star (? xxii) are in the field. 124. (WAG 42.361.) Stamp of syenite (or rhyolite?). The bust of a bearded man, with head in profile and shoulders frontwise, is splendidly engraved. His hair is neatly combed and encircled by a jewelled band, and he wears earrings and a necklace. His robe fits over both shoulders and is ornamented with lines (encircling the shoulders) interrupted by double crosses. Over the head, between a crescent (? xxi) and a six-pointed star (? xxii) is the Pahlevi legend: 'pst'n ? yzdyn (apastan ? yazd?ri) 'trust in God'. I owe the reading of the inscription to Professor Ernst Herzfeld, who dates this seal at about 300 A.D. 125. (WAG C58.) Plaster impression of cylinder. Four men (one on a stand, another by a quadruped and two exchanging greetings) stand between posts. Nos. 125-7 are of questionable antiquity. 126. (WAG 42.181.) Cylinder of iron. Two men (behind each is a long- robed attendant with a spear) thrashing an encircled bird. 127. (WAG 42.431.) Cylinder of breccia. Upper register: a naked suppliant curtsies before a crowned seated figure, behind whom is a burning altar. Two attendants with spears are behind the suppliant. Lower register: a woman and a bearded man (armed with a spear and club) face a winged woman.1 1 Addendum: WAG 42.449 (no photograph given) is a red and blue breccia cylinder. The scene depicts a deity offering a nest (?) to a seated god. An attendant holds a mace (?) in one hand and a pot on a cord in the other. The seal looks like a forgery.</page><page sequence="33">PLATE II 7 (forgery)</page><page sequence="34">PLATE III 1'4!BV 15 17 19</page><page sequence="35">PLATE IV 23 24 25 (forgery) 26 27 id \ 28 (suspect) 29 30</page><page sequence="36">PLATE V 31 (suspect) 32 33 34 36 37 39 40</page><page sequence="37">PLATE VI 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 ?? f.? ? |?i\)U 49 5?</page><page sequence="38">PLATE VII Si \ -v* W t 52 53 54 ?
