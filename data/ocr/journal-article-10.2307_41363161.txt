<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHAPTER 2 7 Household Assemblages in Late Minoan UIC Crete: The Evidence from Karphi by Leslie Preston Day The site of Karphi, located on a high peak overlooking the Lasithi plain, remains one of the most thoroughly investigated settlements from the pe- riod of transition from the Bronze to Early Iron Ages on Crete (Fig. 27.1). Excavated from 1937-1939 by members of the British School at Athens under the direction of John Pendlebury,1 Karphi is frequently cited in dis- cussions of settlement plans as the last development of Minoan civilization or the beginning of the new Hellenic culture.2 The buildings were uncovered over a three-year period. In 1937, work concentrated on the Temple (room 1), although local workers also removed material from Mikre Koprana, a small peak to the east. In 1938, rooms 2-57 were uncovered, and 1939 saw the excavation of rooms 58-150. A report on the work appeared on the eve of World War II, but the ceramic study lagged behind because of difficulties in cleaning and mending the pottery; it was not actually published until 1960 by Mercy Money- Coutts Seiradaki.3 Excavation revealed an estimated 20%-33% of the settlement.4 Pendle- bury and his crew took great care with the excavation and interpretation 1.

I am also grateful to the American School of Classical Stud- ies at Athens for help with permits, to the directors of the British School, and especially to Colin Macdonald, the for- mer curator at Knossos, who provided work space and support during field work from 1994 through 1997. My thanks also go to Alexandra Karetsou and the staff of the Iraklion Archaeo- logical Museum for their assistance during that time. Financial support for the project was provided by the Institute for Aegean Prehistory and Wabash College. 2. The date of the settlement at Karphi has long been a source of con- troversy. The excavators termed it Intermediate between Late Minoan and Protogeometric (Pendlebury, Pendlebury, and Money-Coutts 1937- 1938, p. 140), and Pendlebury soon refined the date to Subminoan (Pendle- bury 1939, p. 309). After the publica- tion of the pottery, the settlement at Karphi was assigned by scholars to the later LM UIC period (Sackett, Pop- ham, and Warren 1965, pp. 280-282), although some, particularly Kanta (1980, pp. 5, 121) and Hallager (2000, pp. 173-174), have suggested that Karphi was founded at the beginning of LM IIIC and continued into the Subminoan period. A full publication of the pottery has recently appeared (Day 2011), but the chronological find- ings can be briefly stated as follows. While there is ample evidence in the fragments that came from under streets and houses that the settlement was founded in the LM IIIB-C transition, the majority of the whole or nearly complete vessels are late LM IIIC, con- sistent with the material from Kavousi (for Vronda and phase III at the Kastro, see Mook and Coulson 1997, pp. 359- 363; Day 1997, pp. 394-400) and the late LM IIIC phase at Sybrita/Thronos (D Agata 2003b, p. 29). A few vessels could be termed Subminoan in style. The tombs, however, although in use during the habitation of the site, con- tinued long after the Karphi settlement was abandoned, lasting into the Proto- geometric era. 3. Seiradaki 1960. 4.

Because the site has been known for so long, it is surprising that no household analysis has been made of Karphi.6 One reason has been the difficulty of reconstructing the original contents of the houses from the published accounts, and there are additional limitations. Although all the recognized objects were recorded and published,7 the pottery was not so systematically handled. In 1937, all fragments were saved, but in 1938 the excavators took the pottery down to Tzermiado and discarded a great deal of it there. In the last season, pottery was sorted on site, and although all of the fine ware was kept, the majority of the coarse vessels were thrown away on site without washing.8 Some of the information about the discarded pot- tery was recorded in the excavation notebook, and in 1939 the recognizable types of the various shapes were recorded (e.g., three dishes of type 2). 9 Thus, what is available for study is the result not only of site formation processes, but also of the decisions made by the excavators about the worth of the artifacts. All of the fine wares remain, in addition to whole or nearly complete coarse vessels, or any pieces that were deemed of interest. Since all of the pottery and fragments that were kept were inscribed with their findspots in ink, their place in the Karphi settlement can be reestablished. Regardless of the selectivity on the part of the excavators, a study of the pottery can provide only limited information about the daily activities of the inhabitants or the functions of rooms and buildings. First of all, as with any archaeological site that was not destroyed in a sudden catastrophe, the material found in a room does not accurately reflect what was there during the use of the building.10 The inhabitants seem to have taken many of their possessions with them when they abandoned Karphi at the end of Late Minoan (LM) IIIC, leaving the rest to be disturbed as the buildings slowly decayed.

A visitor will be at a loss to find any trace of the thoroughfares pictured in the plan; indeed, the publication informs the careful reader that nearly all of the paving had already been re- moved before excavation began (Pen- dlebury, Pendlebury, and Money- Coutts 1937-1938, p. 66). 6. Nowicki (1999a) has analyzed the published finds from LM IIIC Karphi to create a general picture of the eco- nomic situation of its people, but few others have looked thoroughly at the material, except for that relating to reli- gious ritual. For the analysis of religious material, see Gesell 1985, pp. 79-82; 2004, pp. 146-147; Rutkowski 1987; Prent 2005, pp. 137-146. 7. An inventory notebook that includes a brief sketch of each of the objects, along with measurements, identifications, and findspot, is in the archives of the British School at Athens, along with the excavation notebook. I am grateful to the Brit- ish School and its archivist, Amalia Kakisses, for permission to use the Karphi notebooks. 8. Seiradaki 1960, p. 1. 9. This listing of types is useful, but has limitations. Some of the types were not correctly identified; e.g., the type 2 jar (Seiradaki 1960, p. 6, fig. 3:2) is ac- tually a tripod cooking pot from the Temple with an unusual configuration of three handles, and it is not clear whether other vessels listed as belong- ing to this type had the same general profile, or whether the type is defined by the handles. 10. LaMotta and Schiffer (1999) outline the problems involved in depo- sitional processes. Allison (1999b, p. 6), Nevett (1999, p. 32), and Ault and Nevett (1999, pp. 43-44), how- ever, stress that one can gain some idea about room functions from the remains, and Glowacki (2002, 2004, 2007) undertook this process for LM IIIC Kavousi Vronda.</page><page sequence="4">ЗЮ LESLIE PRESTON DAY example, seem to have been removed; few whole or nearly complete deep bowls were found, mostly fragments broken earlier in the sites history. On the other hand, it is clear that the inhabitants abandoned their larger coarse vessels. The published account of the pottery, the information recorded in the notebooks, and the actual material still available in the Iraklion Mu- seum can provide some idea of what went on in the houses. The whole or nearly complete vessels give a partial picture of what was in use in the rooms in the last days of the settlement, while the more fragmentary vessels tell us about earlier usage. In this analysis, the pottery is divided into four categories based on function: vessels for consumption and display, for food preparation, for storage, and for special functions (see Figs. 27.2-27.7). Vessels for consumption and display include not only pottery that was used for eating and drinking, but also those pieces intended for display, whatever other functions they may have served. In this category are fine wares and most of the large number of decorated coarse wares that are assumed to have been used in social settings, either competitively or to assert community identity.11 The most ubiquitous shape is the deep bowl, which functioned as the chief drinking vessel, but may also have served for eating, perhaps for daily consumption as well as social occasions, given their numbers. The less common cups were also used for daily drinking, although they might also have served as ladles. Rather larger and more elaborately decorated are the kylikes and krat- ers. The LM IIIC kylix can be extremely large, and the shape may have played an important role in elite drinking rituals at both Karphi and Kavousi Vronda.12 Kraters are also abundant, and, while similar in shape to the deep bowls, they are much larger and generally more elaborately decorated. The function of kraters is not certain; the name suggests a large bowl for mixing water and wine in the Greek fashion, but there is currently no evidence to confirm this association. At Karphi, kraters are often found in association with large kylikes, and both may have been used in the elite drinking ritu- als, where their elaborate decoration would display the wealth and taste of the owner. The large and elaborately decorated mugs and tankards may also have been involved in similar display.13 Highly decorated pyxides and stirrup jars probably were also meant to display the taste, wealth, or status of the owners, while at the same time serving useful functions of small-scale storage. The pyxis is one of the pe- culiarities of the Karphi ceramic assemblage (e.g., Figs. 27.3:1, 27.5:3-6, 27.6:4, 5, 27.7:2); although known at other LM IIIC sites, the shape is not as plentiful elsewhere as at Karphi.14 Fine stirrup jars are generally small and have elaborate decoration, the finest examples with octopus motifs (e.g., Fig. 27.3:5). Perhaps they were used as fine oil containers, impres- sive during festive dining. The juglet or small amphora may have served a similar use in ordinary domestic circumstances, but these rarely carry elaborate decoration. One-handled, cylindrical-mouthed jugs are plenti- ful: the coarse and undecorated examples were used in ordinary domestic contexts, while the more elaborate and fine vessels were employed in social or religious circumstances.15 Much of the Karphi ceramic assemblage is made up of vessels used in the preparation of food, especially cooking; it is unclear what percentage of the whole is represented by this type of pottery because so much has 11. There is much evidence that festive dining and drinking rituals played an important role in the cul- tures of the Bronze Age in the Aegean (Wright 2004a), especially on Crete (Borgna 2004, pp. 142-150). 12.

The most common cooking vessels are tripod cooking pots and cooking dishes, but cooking jugs, flat trays, and lids are also found. Apparently absent are the flat-bottomed cooking jars or amphoras found at other LM IIIC sites.16 The tripod cookpot comes in a variety of shapes and sizes; most are the deep, two-handled collared jars (e.g., Fig. 27.4:14), but smaller tripods with vertical handles,17 tripod bowls (e.g., Fig. 27.6:15), and round-bottomed tripods also occur.18 The cooking dish is most com- mon, and it has a long history on Crete.19 These large dishes, with rims pinched out or pulled in and often with holes for draining, suggest a particular kind of cooking different from that done with tripods, perhaps involving frying or steaming rather than soups or stews; their large size may also suggest the preparation of greater quantities of food, perhaps for communal events. The dishes could be turned into small ovens with the addition of a lid of similar shape.20 While lids are not generally classed among cooking vessels, many of the LM IIIC lids are made of cooking fabrics and show traces of burning, and they may have been placed over the cookpots. The most common type of lid is a flat knobbed disk, often elaborately decorated on top (e.g., Figs. 27.5:11, 12, 27.7:3). The undersides of these lids show burning in a variety of patterns.21 Other types of vessels used in the preparation of food, but not cooking, include lekanai; these may have been used as plastic basins are used today for a variety of purposes, for mixing food but also for washing. Much of the pottery found on the site was clearly used for storage, probably primarily food storage, but also of other perishable goods. Pithoi are the largest storage jars, and they have been found in nearly every room on the site, with a few exceptions; several rooms have none at all, while some have such an extraordinary number (8-17) that the space must have served primarily for storage given the available area.22 Second to the pithos in popularity was the pithoid jar, a shape that is smaller and more open than the pithos and may have been used for storage of different material or for temporary storage.23 Other forms of storage vessels include coarse stirrup jars and amphoras. Finally, there are many other vessels, some used in rituals - such as the rhyton and possibly the hut urn - and others more utilitarian, such as scuttles/braziers for holding hot coals, a necessity in the harsh Karphi winter months. The kalathos (e.g., Figs. 27.2:11, 12,27.5:7, 8,27.6:10-13) is one of the most common forms of coarse pottery on the site, and indeed, it is frequent at most LM IIIC sites. Its ubiquity suggests a multitude of domestic functions, while its appearance in the Temple and other rooms 16. Hallager 2000, pp. 159-160. This shape may have been imported into Crete from the mainland; Tsipo- poulou (2004a, p. 115) sees it as Myce- naean. 17. Seiradaki 1960, p. 7, fig. 4:2. 18. Seiradaki 1960, p. 7, fig. 4:3.

Betancourt 1980, p. 7. 21. The undersides are burnt, either entirely, around the edges (as if over- hanging a smaller vessel), or sometimes only in the center (as if placed over a smaller vessel that contained burning material). Occasionally there is no sign of burning. 22. Particularly large quantities of pithoi and pithoid jars were found in К 22 in the Magazines (8), К 69 in the Central West Quarter (9), К 80 in the Priests House (8), К 121 in the Cliff Houses West (10 pithoi, 2 tripod pithoi, 5 pithoid jars), and in К 149 on Mikre Koprana (17 pithoi, 4 tripod pithoi, and 7 pithoid jars); these rooms must have been used largely for storage, and, at least in the case of two of them (K 69, К 80), there was less evidence of cooking than in most of the other rooms. 23. Nowicki 1999a, p. 149.</page><page sequence="12">3l8 LESLIE PRESTON DAY with ritual material, as well as in other LM UIC shrines, shows that at least one of its uses was related to cult activity.24 Burning occurred on most of the Karphi kalathoi, both outside and inside, so they must have been used in the fire or to hold some burning material. One example from К 102 contained carbonized olive pits. Other objects give us further information on the activities and func- tions of rooms. There is little to suggest industrial activity of any sort. Although there must have been a potters workshop, only a single fragment of a potters wheel was found and no kiln; the large quantity of misfired blue ware vessels found in the Temple, however, may represent wasters from a nearby kiln. Metal hoards have been seen as possible indicators of metallurgical activity,25 but they may equally well show wealth. The lead run-offs found in К 1 1 and К 12 of the Great House, however, do attest metallurgical activity there. Most buildings produced a small number of other objects: stone beads, bone or ivory pins, stone vessels and tools, and terracotta beads; these are not helpful in identifying room or building use, since many are portable and multifunctional. The many terracotta spools found on the site, however, may have served as loomweights.26 These appeared in many of the houses, but in such quantity (more than 15) in six rooms that we may suggest the presence of a loom.27 The spools found together were remarkably uniform in weight and size; smaller spools weighed between 25 and 50 g, the majority 30-40 g, and the larger ones 50-100 g. It is interesting that many of these hoards of spools came from rooms that were the largest in their buildings. Finally, cult equipment found in the buildings helps to distinguish areas of ritual on the site.28 The Temple was the largest and certainly the most important building devoted to ritual, with its large space, areas for com- munity assembly outside,29 and statues of goddesses with upraised arms.30 Two other areas that produced fragments of goddess figures (K 16-17, К 116) may have been smaller shrines in which similar rituals occurred, possibly at different times in the settlement s history. There are also rooms that were easily accessible from the streets and that contained offering stands or snake tubes (K 57, К 58) in which some sort of religious offer- ing occurred; К 57 has entrances from two streets, suggesting more public access. Other rooms produced animal and human figurines (especially К 85-87 and К 106), and К 27 had two elaborate anthropomorphic rhyta. Except for the buildings with the stands, rooms with cult equipment also 24. For kalathoi in LM UIC settle- ments, see Chalasmenos (Tsipopoulou 2004a, p. 115), Chania (Hallager 2000, p. 157); for ritual kalathoi, see Gesell 1999. 25. Wallace 2005, p. 259. 26. The excavators called these "spools," but they have also been re- ferred to as "bobbins" (Bruun-Lund- gren and Wiman 2000, p. 177) and reels (Evely 2000, p. 502); although they were common in the Early Bronze Age, they later disappeared from Cretan assemblages until LM III. Barber (1997) thinks they may have been used for a particular type of weav- ing, for belts. Rahmstorf (2005) has suggested that this type of loomweight represents Mycenaean influence on Crete in this late period. 27. Over 50 spools are recorded as having been found in К 110 in the Eastern Cliff Houses and 38 in К 102 in the Western Cliff Houses; 21 spools came from К 136 in the Eastern Quar- ter, 20 from К 27 in the Southern Houses, 19 from К 61 in the Priest's House, 18 from К 150 at Mikre Ko- prana, and 15 from К 91 in the South- ern Shelters. 28.

Despite an overall uniformity in assemblages across the site, individual houses can show differences, and three will be examined here in some detail: К 3/K 134 in the Barracks, К 22/K 23 in the Magazines, and К 110 in the Eastern Cliff Houses. All were chosen because they contained large quantities of whole or nearly complete pots, and each was dug in a different excavation season, thus representing a different sampling. THE BARRACKS: К 3/K 134 A long row of rooms excavated in 1937 comprises the Barracks. Each of the houses seems to consist of a single room, with the exception of room 3, which may be associated with a second space (K 134), possibly exterior. While К 3 produced a large kylix and several fine and coarse decorated jugs for consumption and display, there was an unusually large number of kalathoi (10) and only a few fragments of pithoi and pithoid jars (Fig. 27.2). The associated space К 134, on the other hand, contained a larger percentage of elaborate pottery for display and consumption, including a pyxis and two octopus stirrup jars (Fig. 27.3). No cooking ware was found in the space, but one pithos and a coarse stirrup jar indi- cate storage. THE MAGAZINES: К 22/K 23 A large complex on the southeast corner of the excavated area was uncov- ered in 1938 and was called the Magazines. Of particular interest here are two rooms (K 22, К 23) of the four-room structure, since they produced much nearly complete pottery (Figs. 27.4, 27.5); rooms К 29 and К 30 may not always have been part of the same structure, and only fragments were found there. Room К 23 was particularly rich in fine or decorated pottery, including an unusual krater (Fig. 27.4:1), a stirrup jar (Fig. 27.4:2), three decorated jugs (Fig. 27.4:3, 7, 11), and a thelastron (Fig. 27.4:4). Vessels for food preparation included a tripod (Fig. 27.4:14) and two cooking dishes. A large coarse oinochoe (Fig. 27.4:9), a coarse jug (Fig. 27.4:8), and a fragmentary basin may also fit into this category. Storage is represented by a large coarse stirrup jar (Fig. 27.4:10), a small baggy jar (Fig. 27.4:13), and fragments of both pithoi and pithoid jars. A large number of objects was also found (a fragment of a bronze bowl, some Neolithic axes, seven beads, and a pierced bone pommel), but they do not help determine the function of the room. Nine spools found in the room suggest weaving activities. The adjoining room (K 22) also produced much pottery. Some of it was for consumption and display, but there were few deep bowls and an exceptionally large number of elaborately decorated pyxides (Fig. 27.5:3-6). There was little cooking ware, but storage vessels were plentiful, including fragments of a coarse amphora and stirrup jar, eight pithoi, and one or two pithoid jars. Other pottery included a pair of kalathoi. Also recorded in the room were five spools.</page><page sequence="14">320 LESLIE PRESTON DAY CLIFF EAST: К 110 The Eastern Cliff Houses lie on the northern edge of the settlement, with four large unconnected rooms; these may be part of the same com- plex or separate houses, but without preserved doorways this is difficult to determine. Room К 110 produced a great amount of pottery in 1939 (Figs. 27.6, 27.7), with some interesting anomalies. One of the deep bowls has a unique molded design that seems to imitate an earlier palatial blossom bowl (Fig. 27.6:1). Many small vessels for pouring, including a small jug and two decorated stirrup jars (Fig. 27.6:3, 8, 9), were found in the room. There were also three pyxides (Figs. 27.6:4, 5, 27.7:2); one (Fig. 27.7:2) is very large and elaborately decorated with a variety of fringed motifs, and a fine conical lid (Fig. 27.7:1) may have belonged to it. Pottery for food preparation was scanty, but included an interesting small tripod bowl (Fig. 27.6:15). A coarse jar (Fig. 27.7:4) and a large octopus stirrup jar (Fig. 27.7:5) comprised the storage vessels, as well as fragments of six pithoi and six pithoid jars. Other vessels included a hut urn (Fig. 27.6:6), four kalathoi (Fig. 27.6:10-13), and a firebox (Fig. 27.6:14). The room was rich in other finds as well, including fragments of bronze, a bone handle, and a Middle Minoan stone bowl with a lid and a piece of obsidian within. The over 50 terracotta spools found in the room suggest weaving, and there are more than enough to indicate the presence of a loom. DISCUSSION Based on the ceramic evidence, we can conclude that household assem- blages in most of the buildings across Karphi were remarkably uniform. Some houses were larger, some were richer in finds, and many had ritual associations, but the presence of similar groupings of pottery suggests that the rooms were multifunctional and served the domestic needs of the inhabitants. As at Kavousi Vronda, the largest rooms in any given building showed the widest variety of functions, including weaving and possibly domestic ritual activity. A few buildings may have served specific functions; the Temple was clearly a religious building, the houses on Mikre Koprana produced much more cooking and storage pottery than other buildings, and room К 143 may have served as a food preparation area, possibly for one or more of the megarons of the Eastern Quarter.31 The largest buildings belonged to the elite (the Great House, the Priests House, the megarons). Although these houses produced material similar to the smaller buildings, they showed a greater proportion of the kylikes that may have accompanied elite drinking rituals, and the large amount of bronze found in the Great House suggests wealth or control of metallurgical resources by one of the elite groups. Special areas of the site were not apparently set aside for particular classes of society, however. Although there is a major building devoted to religious practices, there is also evidence for rituals performed in other areas of the site. The idea that there might have been different ethnic groups inhabiting different areas of the site is not born out by the ceramic evidence. 31. A similar situation can be found at Chalasmenos, where an entire area of the settlement has been identified as a food preparation area for the megarons; see Tsipopoulou 2005b, p. 332, and in this volume (Chap. 29).</page><page sequence="15">HOUSEHOLD ASSEMBLAGES IN LM IIIC CRETE 32I One is struck by the predominance of individual, self-sufficient house- holds at Karphi. Households stored quantities of food and other perishable items, the inhabitants cooked in a wide variety of vessels in the rooms, and the women probably spent time spinning and weaving. No specialized manufacturing areas have been recognized. Aside from the area outside the Temple, no spaces were clearly set aside for communal activities,32 al- though the "squares" (K 10, К 48) may have provided some space for such activities. To judge from the pottery, an important element of social life was the household display on festive occasions; some of the buildings may even have served as the special locus of competitive or communal rituals, whether civic or religious. 32.
