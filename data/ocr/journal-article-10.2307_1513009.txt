<plain_text><page sequence="1">Silver-and-Gold Moche Artifacts from Loma Negra, Peru DEBORAH SCHORSCH Associate Conservator, Sherman Fairchild Centerfor Objects Conservation, The Metropolitan Museum of Art INTRODUCTION OMPOSITE SILVER-AND-GOLD ORNAMENTS are known from various cultures throughout the ancient world; no culture in the Americas, how- ever, appears to have indulged a taste for this visual, and presumably symbolic, juxtaposition as frequently as the Moche of northern Peru (ca. A.D. 100-800) (Figure 1 ). The emergence of a large corpus of Moche metallic artifacts in the last three decades has allowed archaeologists as well as historians of art and technol- ogy to recognize the Moche culture as the source of some of the most sophisticated metalwork ever pro- duced in ancient America.' The particularly rich col- lection of Moche metalwork from Loma Negra in The Metropolitan Museum of Art serves as a fine starting point for investigations into the technical ingenuity that the Moche applied to the manufacture of these composite precious-metal ornaments. The exploitation of metal in Peru had its very mod- est beginnings in the Initial Period.2 The Early Horizon that followed was a period of pan-Andean unity based in part on what may have been the propagation of a religious cult identified with Chavin de Huantar, a major archaeological site in the northern highlands of Peru. Metalwork was still relatively rare during this period, and the extant artifacts are almost exclusively of gold. While Early Horizon objects entirely of silver are almost unknown, there are a few Chavin silver- and-gold pieces. The subsequent Early Intermediate Period, which is characterized by the development of regional cultures, witnessed the rise of the Moche peo- ple and their innovative metalworking practices. During the Early Intermediate Period the frequency and size of gold objects increased dramatically, and sil- ver as well as copper came into widespread use.3 The consistent exploitation of silver in ancient Peru has been traditionally associated with the Chimu, a north coast culture centered in the Moche Valley in the Late Intermediate Period, but this outdated per- ? The Metropolitan Museum of Art 1998 METROPOLITAN MUSEUM JOURNAL 33 ception was based both on the misattribution of known artifacts and on the lack of metalwork dating to earlier periods. For example, many of the silver, or partly sil- ver, objects formerly described as Chimu are now attributed to the Lambayeque culture (also called Sicin), which established itself in the valley of that name during the Middle Horizon. Other silver objects can be recognized as Vicfis, a culture nearly contem- porary to the Moche. Accidents of preservation and discovery can skew the archaeological record: in a review of the state of Peruvian archaeology in 1942 Figure i.

Rockefeller Memorial Collection, Gift of Hugh Smith, by exchange, 1970, 1978.412.243 Alfred Kroeber wrote that contrary to popular opinion silver was used by the Moche but stated his belief that early silver was rare.4 A few years later, in a chart sum- marizing the development of metallurgy in northern Peru, Samuel Lothrop described silver as present but rare in Chavin, Gallinazo, and Mochica (Moche) con- texts.5 As mentioned earlier, artifacts entirely of silver attributed to the Early Horizon Chavin culture are almost unknown, although there are a few examples of silver-and-gold composite pieces. Early Horizon metal- workers also used silver as an alloying metal: there are Chavin silver-based ternary alloys, where the three components are gold, silver and copper, which were used for solder,6 and other man-made gold-based ternary alloys were employed for the fabrication of metal sheet. Discoveries of the last forty years, having significant- ly increased the number of silver or partially silver arti- facts that can be attributed to the Vicuis and Moche cultures, demonstrate that the use of silver was so not uncommon in the Early Intermediate Period. An abun- dance of silver objects was recently found at a Moche site at Sipan.7 In addition to the solid-silver-sheet nose ornaments from Loma Negra (see MMA 1978.412.243; Figure 2), a considerable number of artifacts from Loma Negra were made from silvered-copper sheet.8 Again, one may mention the use by the Moche of ternary silver-based and intentionally alloyed ternary gold-based solders, as well as the intentional alloying of binary (gold-silver) alloys and ternary alloys (gold- silver-copper), the former for gilding copper sub- strates and the latter for use as sheet metal. LOMA NEGRA AND THE DISCOVERY OF MOCHE METALWORK The first opportunity to observe the enormous pro- ductivity and high level of expertise achieved by Moche metalworkers came in the late 196os when tomb rob- bers discovered and looted a rich burial site that came to be known as Loma Negra, in the Vicis region of the Piura Valley on the far north coast of Peru (Figure 1 ).9 During the early i 96os this area had been the focus of widespread illegal digging, and study of the objects recovered, supplemented by information gathered in professional salvage operations, led to the recognition of the Vicfis culture.'o Indigenous to the Piura River valley, the Vicfis culture has been dated to the first half of the Early Intermediate Period." Hundreds of arti- facts recovered in the Vicuis region, however, are attrib- uted to the Moche, a people who flourished in the fertile river valleys far to the south on the other side of the inhospitable Sechura Desert, from about A.D. 100 to 800. The intensive agricultural activity undertaken by the Moche supported a highly stratified society with widespread commercial contacts.'2 Still, the discovery of Moche artifacts on the north side of the desert, far from the Moche cultural sphere as it was then defined, raised many questions. The relationships between the local Vicis culture and this Moche "outpost," and between the Piura Valley sites and Moche culture as a whole, have been considered by various scholars, but much remains to be clarified.'3 In the early 197os a project to document the Loma Negra material was undertaken at the former Museum of Primitive Art in New York. At that time hundreds of objects attributed to Loma Negra were catalogued by Anne-Louise Schaffer, under the supervision ofJulie Jones, at that time curator of Precolumbian Art.14 Subsequently, the Museum of Primitive Art was closed, and in 1978 and 1979 its collections, along with the Loma Negra Archive, were transferred to the Metro- politan Museum, where they are now housed in its Department of the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas. The objects included in the Loma Negra Archive are almost exclusively metal, and nearly all were fashioned from hammered sheet, rather than cast.15 The large number of metal objects relative to ceramic finds was noted by Hans-Dietrich Disselhoff as typical of the Vic6s region,'6 but subsequent discoveries suggest that this may not be the case. When the archive was assem- bled, relatively few examples of other Moche works of art in metal were known, and archaeologists and art historians were perplexed by the new finds. 7 Not only were there no obvious parallels for certain individual 110</page><page sequence="3">objects or types of objects, the sheer number of metal finds from a single context was overwhelming and dif- ficult to explain.'8 Scholars were uncertain as to what type of site Loma Negra could represent because extremely metal-rich individual burials in the Andean region were largely unpublished. Recent excavations in the Lambayeque Valley at Sipan, and the discovery of a rich Moche tomb in the Jequetepeque Valley at a site called La Mina, are pro- viding analogous finds in terms of typology, style, qual- ity, quantity, methods of manufacture, and context.'9 In 1987 attention was drawn to a cluster of eroded adobe pyramids at Sipan known as Huaca Rajada, when a number of high-quality Moche artifacts began to appear on the Peruvian art market. At the site it was discovered that grave robbers had penetrated and loot- ed part of the burial of a high-status Moche male. Under the direction of Walter Alva of the Bruning Museum in the town of Lambayeque, the site has been the focus of ongoing scientific excavations and other significant tombs have been discovered.20 One year after the looting of the Sipan burial, grave robbers located an isolated elite tomb about fifty miles to the south at La Mina, near the site of Pacatnamu in the Jequetepeque Valley.21 While the tomb was subse- quently located and a salvage excavation undertaken, nearly all the precious-metal artifacts and sumptuous ceramics had already been removed.22 These new discoveries led to a reevaluation of the Loma Negra corpus, and in 1992 an exhibition entitled "Loma Negra-A Peruvian Lord's Tomb" was presented in The Metropolitan Museum of Art.23 Although their deposition context is lost, the Loma Negra artifacts can now be recognized as the grave goods of high-status Figure 3.

Rockefeller, 1979, 1979.206.1341,1342 Moche individuals buried in the Piura Valley.24 The colloquium/workshop "Andean Royal Tombs, Works of Art in Metal,"organized in conjunction with the exhibition, elicited further thought and discussion about Moche metalwork from Loma Negra, Sipan, and La Mina. Between 1979 and 1987 approximately four hun- dred artifacts documented in the Loma Negra Archive entered the collections of the Metropolitan Museum.25 Among these objects are a sizable group made from unalloyed copper, including "crescents"26 and a variety of relief plaques. Most of the artifacts-including per- sonal ornaments, small figures of animals (particularly insects and crustaceans), disk ornaments, anthropo- morphic and zoomorphic standards, and numerous relief plaques in a great variety of shapes-were made from gilded- or silvered-copper sheet. There are also more than twenty objects or fragments of objects, including plain and embellished nose ornaments, earflares, and flat or three-dimensional ornaments for attachment to substrates of other metals, that were made from solid gold sheet. A group of gold nose orna- ments and two small gold figures (Figure 3) that were probably not manufactured locally are also associated with the finds.27 There are also a number of silver objects, primarily nose ornaments (Figure 2), known from Loma Negra. It is, however, the artifacts that combine silver and gold components or silver and gold surfaces using a variety of mechanical and metallurgical processes that consti- tute the most striking finds from Loma Negra, Sipan, and La Mina. The composite objects from Loma Negra that combine gold and silver sheet rather than gilded or silvered surfaces are limited to nose ornaments and Figure 4.

Relative to the num- ber of composite silver-and-gold objects of Moche manufacture, much effort went into developing meth- ods used for combining the two metals. Several of these processes were already in use in Chavin times and many were employed simultaneously, if less frequently, byVicfs metalworkers; yet the innovative metallurgy of the Moche far exceeded the legacy they inherited, just as many of their technological innovations were not incorporated into the metalworking traditions of sub- sequent Andean cultures. Later Peruvian cultures con- tinued to express an interest in the juxtaposition of gold and silver but none appears to have pursued this goal with the refinement and resourcefulness dis- played by the Moche. Two mechanical and three metallurgical methods were employed in the manufacture of composite works from Loma Negra in the Metropolitan Museum (see Appendix).28 Three of these methods, and two addi- tional ones, were observed on objects from Sipan. Most of these seven techniques appear to have been used in the manufacture of the objects from La Mina and pos- sibly an eighth as well. Another method of combining gold and silver was used in the manufacture of an unprovenanced Moche nose ornament in the American Museum of Natural History, New York, and yet another method can be observed on an un- provenanced silver-and-gold figure of a llama in the Museo del Banco Wiese in Lima.29 In some instances a combination of mechanical and metallurgical pro- Figure 5.

The research presented here is based on detailed technical examinations of thirteen composite objects from Loma Negra in the Metropolitan Museum.30 The work was carried out in conjunction with an ongoing study of the Loma Negra corpus currently under way in the Sherman Fairchild Center for Objects Con- servation.31 The project was begun by Ellen Howe, ini- tially in preparation for the Loma Negra exhibition and the colloquium/workshop "Andean Royal Tombs, Works of Art in Metal." Moreover, several unprove- nanced Moche composite objects, and those attributed to other ancient Peruvian cultures, in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum, the American Museum of Natural History, New York, the National Museum of the American Indian, New York and Washington, D.C., and Dumbarton Oaks Research Library and Collections, Washington, D.C., were included in this investigation. These objects, as well as two nose ornaments attrib- uted to La Mina in a private collection, were examined under magnification and radiographed. Polished sec- tions of joins were studied using a metallographic microscope, and elemental analysis of the sections and of microsamples were carried out using an energy- dispersive x-ray spectrometer attached to a scanning electron microscope (EDS/SEM).32 Two of these sec- tions were also analyzed using wave-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (WDS) in conjunction with an electron microprobe.33 In addition, a significant number of composite silver-and-gold objects from Sipan were examined under magnification.

Rockefeller, 1979, 1979.206.1236 (photo: author) MECHANICAL JOINING METHODS In ancient times metal joins were executed using mechanical, adhesive, or metallurgical methods. Me- chanicaljoins are those where interlocking metal com- ponents are held in close physical proximity.34 The largest number of composite silver-and-gold artifacts from Loma Negra were joined mechanically, which is consistent with the finds from the site as a whole, as mechanicaljoining was the predominant method used to assemble the approximately four hundred Loma Negra artifacts in the Metropolitan Museum fashioned from gold, silver, copper, silvered-copper, and gilded- copper sheet.35 Mechanical joins are also found on composite silver-and-gold artifacts from Sipan36 and La Mina. I. The mechanical joins present on the Loma Negra objects generally rely on a series of rectangular tabs and slots; the tabs extend from the edges of one sheet of metal and are inserted into slots cut into a second sheet. For example, there are several nose ornaments made from hammered silver sheet with gold attach- ments. In one case a gold band with snails in low relief is joined in this manner to the bottom edge of the sil- ver component (Figures 5, 6). In a second example the silver substrate is overlaid with two mirror-image gold crayfish in low relief (Figures 7, 8). On all the composite nose ornaments in the Metro- politan Museum that were joined using mechanical means, the gold sheet was applied to or over the silver, but taken together with the objects of similar manu- Figure 8.

This flexibility can also be observed on the Loma Negra harpy eagle earflares (MMA 1979.206.1245,1246), each of which has a silver bird within a gold field (Figure 9),37 and the warrior earflares (MMA 1979.206.1241,1242), where the met- als used for image and ground are reversed (Figure o), and on the large disk ornaments discussed below. Mechanical joins were also used in the manufac- ture of the frontals from a pair of circular earflares divided between the Metropolitan Museum (MMA 1979.206.1240) and the National Museum of the American Indian (24/3543). Each frontal represents a silver spider in the center of a gold web (Figures 1 1, 12).38 The spiders are three-dimensional, each having been formed from two raised sheets of silver that were pressure-fitted.39 The legs are made from four round silver wires, each threaded through a pair of holes on opposite sides of the body (Figure 13). The wires were fitted into rectangular holes in the webs and flattened so as not to slip out, holding the spiders mechanically in place. Silver-and-gold objects of Chavin manufacture are rare, and none is known to have used mechanical join- ing methods. Although Vicus composite objects are relatively common, mechanical joins are rare.40 II. The second Moche method of combining gold and silver is similar to the first insofar as it involves the assembly and mechanical attachment of metal sheets using tabs and wires. However, in this case the sheets are of copper with gilded or silvered surfaces. Close examination of Loma Negra artifacts in the Museum that were assembled from copper-sheet components has revealed that a considerable number use both gilded-copper and silvered-copper sheets. Among these, the largest and the most impressive in terms of imagery are two disks that measure approxi- mately twenty-six and twenty-eight centimeters in diameter. These disks, along with eight others from Loma Negra in the Metropolitan Museum are part of a cohesive but enigmatic group of objects found thus far only in the Vicuis region. The disks have one or more hole(s) for suspension or attachment to a sup- port, but their function is unknown.4' As noted above, the use of gold and silver as both foreground and back- ground characterizes the disks. In the first case (MMA 1987.394.56) a background disk of "silvered" copper supports a gilded-copper owl assembled from several pieces of sheet (Figure 14). o Loma Negra Au * Moche Au % copper wt % copper / wt % gold - wt % silver - Figure 16. Ternary gold-silver-copper diagram plotting gold alloys from Loma Negra and other Moche contexts Copper corrosion products that have migrated from the substrate obscure much of the disk's surfaces, but in radiographs it is possible to see that the wings lack the tabs that held the other parts of the body in place and would have flapped freely when the disk was moved (Figure 15). Its head, created entirely in the round, is mounted on a metal rod inserted into the body and attached to its inner surface and would have rotated from side to side. The outer edge of the disk is covered by a rim made from gilded-copper sheet. The Figure 17. Disk ornament, Moche, from Loma Negra, Peru. Silvered- and gilded-copper sheet, Diam. 26.4 cm.

The gold surface layer examined in a section prepared from one of the attachment tabs on the owl contains 20.2 percent sil- ver;43 the ratio of gold to silver (ca. 4:1) is similar to that typically found in Moche ternary alloys (Figure 16).44 The so-called silvered layer of the background contains 43.7 percent silver and 56.3 percent gold. Alloys of the same compositions prepared as standards indicate that the juxtaposed metals were relatively sim- ilar in color.45 The second disk (MMA 1987.394.54), which is em- bellished with shell-and-stone inlay, represents a war- rior surmounted by a double-headed "moon creature" holding a prisoner by the hair in each of its jaws, all made from silvered-copper sheet* and mounted with tabs onto a gilded-copper disk (Figure 17). Here the rim, held in place by tabs and dangle wires, has a sil- vered surface. There are no moving parts other than a multitude of silvered-copper dangles.* With 25.8 per- cent silver, the ratio of gold to silver in the gilded layer of the background is lower (3:1) than found in the gold alloys typically used by the Moche; the silver-rich Figure 19.

In general, movement-be it tongues dangling from the jaws of foxes46 or the rotating owl head and flapping wings described above, combined with the lib- eral use of dangles of every description-played an integral part in Moche metalwork. It seems that the ability of ancient Andean peoples to appreciate subtle differences in the gold-silver spectrum was more high- ly developed than ours,47 but in the case of the two large gilded- and silvered-copper disks, the use of care- fully chosen gold-and-silver alloys similar in color placed in close juxtaposition would have animated the surfaces and complemented the viewer's perception of the physical movement and sound inherent in their construction.48 A third object constructed from mechanicallyjoined gilded- and silvered-copper sheets is a staff head (MMA 1979.206.1314) (Figure 18).49 From the surviving components it appears that a relatively thin sheet of sil- vered copper* was hammered to form a cylinder and fitted onto a wooden staff. Attached to one end of the cylinder are two gilded-copper plaques* worked in relief, each spanning one-half of its circumference. Copper nails held the plaques and sheet onto the wooden core.50 Thus far, this method of combining gold and silver has not been reported on objects from other Moche contexts, but closer examination of the material from Sipan and elsewhere may reveal their existence. This method appears not to have been popular with Vicis metalworkers.5' ADHESIVE JOINING METHODS III. Moche metalwork characteristically had inlays of nonmetallic materials, such as shell and stone. The in- lays were held in place with a natural resin bulked with an inorganic material to increase its viscosity (Figure 17).52 This adhesive method of attachment was also used for metal inlays and can be seen on, for example, a Loma Negra copper mask (MMA 1987.394.68) with eyes and teeth of gilded copper (Figure 19). Although there are no known Loma Negra composite silver-and- gold examples, several objects from Sipan were made using this adhesive joining method. Frequently illus- trated is one of several similar beads made from solid- gold sheet in the shape of a human head, whose eyes are inlaid with solid-silver scleras and lapis lazuli pupils (Figure 20). The silver inlays were cut or hammered to shape and adhered in place with resin. From Sipan there are also examples of gilded-copper sheet that was inlaid with solid-silver-sheet inlay (Figure 21).53 METALLURGICAL JOINING METHODS Metallurgical joins are those that bond metal compo- nents on an atomic scale to form a continuous piece, sometimes with the addition of an intermediate metal layer. Such joins are effective due to the interdiffusion of metal atoms within the two joined components, and generally require the application of heat. Heather 117</page><page sequence="10">Figure 22.

Lambayeque, Bruning Museum (photo from Alva and Donnan, Royal Tombs, fig. 223) Lechtman suggests that metallurgical joining tech- niques, such as soldering and brazing, were important stimuli to the development of alloys in the central Andes.54 IV. The overall examination of the artifacts from Loma Negra in the Metropolitan Museum revealed few instances of solder.55 A nose ornament representing spiders on a web (MMA 1979.206.1230) (Figure 22) is the only instance where solder was chosen to assemble silver and gold components.56 By contrast, solder appears to have been used more frequently on com- posite silver-and-gold artifacts from Sipan (Figure 23). Solder may have been used tojoin silver and gold com- ponents on two objects of the Early Horizon: a Chavin spoon with a man blowing into a conch shell in Dumbarton Oaks (B-440) (Figure 24)57 and a small Chavin pin in the National Museum of the American Indian (16/1971M) (Figure 25).58 Solder is rarely observed on silver-and-gold artifacts attributed to the Victis culture. The Loma Negra composite nose ornament on which solder was used consists of six gold spiders in low relief, each placed on an individual silver backplate, which was joined to the reverse of a rectangular gold grid (Figures 22, 26). The solder is readily visible in radiographs of the ornament; fully fused, it is evident from strings of fine radiotransparent bubbles present in radiopaque zones seen near the outlines of the spi- ders (Figure 27).

In fact, hammer-weld- ing seems to have been quite popular with Vicfis met- alworkers.64 Because only one hammer-welded object from Loma Negra was available for technical study, objects attributed to other ancient Peruvian cultures were examined in order to determine the physical L 1 Figure 38.

In addition to the Vicus nose ornaments and Chavin pectorals, a pair of earflares in the Metro- politan Museum (MMA 1979.206.1175-1177) (Fig- ure 35) attributed to the Moche culture and a pair of roundels in the American Museum of Natural History (41.2/6297) and a tupuin Dumbarton Oaks (B-472)65 attributed to the Lambayeque culture were also examined. A number of Vicus and Moche silver-and-gold com- posite nose ornaments were examined and radio- graphed at the Royal Ontario Museum in the mid- 1970s in conjunction with a traveling exhibition of metal artifacts in the Museo Oro del Peru.66 Tushing- ham, Franklin, and Toogood discounted soldering as a possible joining method and concluded that the orna- ments had been welded without the introduction of a filler metal. In the radiographs they noted sharp junc- tures between the components and proposed that the joins had been executed, without overlapping the gold and silver sheets and without much hammering, through the action of heat. The authors also men- tioned the presence of cracks along some of the joins but offered no explanation for their origin. In radiographs of the Loma Negra and Vicus nose ornaments, the Moche earflares, the Lambayeque roundels and tupu, and the Chavin pectorals, the cor- responding silver-and-gold components in each object exhibited drastically different opacities (Figures 36- 39), such as had been observed by Tushingham, Franklin, and Toogood in objects of similar manufac- ture.67 To confirm the supposition that these artifacts had been hammer-welded, metallographic sections were prepared from samples removed from joins on the Loma Negra nose ornament and from one of the Moche earflares. Pending further investigation, it appears that gold and silver sheets were assembled with slightly overlapped edges and alternately heated and hammered until adequate fusion occurred. Certainly in viewing these sections (Figures 40, 41) it is obvious that the silver and gold components had been overlapped prior to joining. The metal sheets that were used for the Loma Negra nose ornament are quite thin, measuring about 0.2 millimeter near the join, while the metal at the join is nearly twice as thick. The Moche earflares are made from substantially thicker gold and silver sheets, the edges of which appear to have been beveled at the overlap, so that the joins are approximately the same thickness as the indi- vidual starting sheets. The abrupt junction between the gold and silver sheets, with their dramatically dif- ferent radiopacities, tends to obscure features associ- ated with thejoins, but, in fact, a careful review of each 122</page><page sequence="15">hammer weld in the radiographs reveals a narrow zone where the gold and silver sheets overlap. As a rule porosity, which is generally associated with melting, was not observed. The Chavin pectorals, the only exceptions, had isolated pores along the joins. It is clear that the joins were annealed, because sub- stantial interdiffusion of the gold and silver can be observed in the metal sections at relatively low magni- fications; the distribution of the two metals on an atomic scale is confirmed with electron backscatter imaging and elemental dot mapping. On the section from the Moche earflare, in particular, long narrow peninsulas of gold penetrate the silver sheet on the other side of thejoin and vice versa, suggesting that the heating occurred repeatedly and in alternation with campaigns of hammering (Figure 41). Furthermore, there is evidence for considerable deformation by hammering, both at the joins and on the objects over- all, subsequent to joining. The broad area of overlap between the gold and silver sheets of the Loma Negra nose ornament (Figure 40), for example, is due to extensive hammering at the joins, while the similarity in the pattern of hammer blows and changes in thick- ness in the gold and silver components, visible in the radiographs, also suggest that the final shaping and finishing were carried out after the components were joined (Figure 36). The joining of the gold and silver sheets prior to shaping the artifacts could also be estab- lished for both Vicuis nose ornaments in the National Museum of the American Indian. In one case (15/894) (Figure 34), there is a vestigial strip of gold attached to the silver component, which indicates that the notch where the ornament was attached to the sep- tum was cut and shaped after the two metals had been joined and hammered to form a slightly ovoid disk (Figure 38). Cracks very close to the hammer-weldedjoins are vis- ible in the radiographs. Their position parallel to the joins suggests that the cracks are due not to inadequate fusion but rather to subsequent stress to the join. In fact, the irregular black voids visible in the section from a join on one of the Moche earflares are cracks, also seen in section, that probably resulted when the flat band consisting of the four hammer-welded sec- tions was hammered into a cylinder (Figure 41). The radiographic images of the two hammer-welded La Mina nose ornaments are significantly different from those of the various other hammer-welded objects that were radiographed in this study and by Tushingham, Franklin, and Toogood. When taken with evidence acquired through other means of exam- ination, these differences may point to a local variation in manufacture. For example, in correlating the radi- Figure 43. Drawing of silver-and-gold nose ornament in Figure 31, indicating sheet thicknesses (drawing by Barry Girsh) ographic images of the hammer-welded ornaments, such as the nose ornament from Loma Negra (Figure 36), the Moche earflares, the Chavin pectorals (Figure 37), and the Vicus nose ornaments (Figures 38, 39), with measurements of sheet thicknesses, it is obvious that the corresponding silver and gold components were made from silver and gold sheets of similar thick- ness. However, the error of assuming that the lack of marked differences in the radiopacity of the different metal components means that an object was not hammer-welded is illustrated by a nose ornament attributed to La Mina (Figure 31). From top to bot- tom, the piece consists of an oval silver field, a gold ser- pent with two human heads, and a row of silver trophy heads. Whereas preliminary macroscopic examination of the ornament suggested that it had been made from gold and silver sheets joined by hammer-welding, this conclusion was at first discounted because the radiopacity is fairly consistent throughout the orna- ment except where changes in thickness were created by the repousse and chasing, or on the edges, where it is obvious that the metal had been disproportionately thinned by hammering (Figure 42). The possibility that these ornaments had been made from gilded sil- ver was briefly considered and rejected as being incon- sistent with the radiographic evidence. Confirmed examples of gilded-silver Moche artifacts are extreme- ly rare.68 Subsequent examination of broken edges within the silver component and of a metallographic sample removed from an exterior gold edge proved defini- tively that the ornament was made from solid-gold and solid-silver sheets. Detailed caliper measurements of numerous sites on the La Mina nose ornament (Figure 123</page><page sequence="16">Figure 44. Nose ornament, Moche, from Loma Negra, Peru, Early Intermediate Period.

Wypyski and author) 43), together with the radiographs and visual exami- nation of the object and its section, suggest that it was hammer-welded from components of different thick- nesses. The silver sheet near the join is consistently thicker than the corresponding gold sheet, which might account for the fortuitously homogeneous radiopacity visible in the radiographs. A similar rela- tionship between the measured thicknesses of the gold and silver sheets and their relative radiopacities was observed in the examination of the second composite silver-and-gold nose ornament attributed to La Mina.

The background fields are silvered gold; the birds and borders are gold. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Michael C. Rockefeller Memorial Collection, Bequest of Nelson A. Rockefeller, 1979, 1979.206.1226 Close examination of two hammer-welded orna- ments from La Mina (see Figure 31) suggests that the following sequence of steps was used in their manu- facture. First, gold and silver sheets were joined by alternating heating and hammering. This was followed by the execution of the relief decoration. The metal along the joins was then selectively removed to create negative spaces and the ornament was trimmed. Hammering to finish the edges and the polishing were the final steps. Evidence that the joining of the two metals was a preliminary step can be seen along inter- nal and external edges of the ornament, where lengths of silver sheet have narrow gold borders, and vice versa. Analysis of the silver and gold components from the Loma Negra hammer-welded ornament indicated that both are debased.69 The composition of the gold sheet-which contains 19.3 percent silver and 5.2 per- cent copper-is typical for the Loma Negra gold alloys, as well as Moche gold in general (see Figure 16). The silver sheet contains 6.6 percent gold and 4.4 per- cent copper. Unfortunately this nose ornament was the only Loma Negra hammer-welded join available for analysis, but in all instances where silver-sheet samples from hammer-welded composite silver-and-gold arti- facts were analyzed, they were found to contain amounts of gold and copper equal to or greater than what was detected for the Loma Negra example. It is interesting to note that the silver used on composite objects that employ other metallurgical means of attachment, i.e., soldering or silvering, also contain considerable additions of gold and copper. 124</page><page sequence="17">The silver used for metallurgical joining processes differs distinctly in composition from the alloys used for Loma Negra artifacts without metallurgical joins. In the six cases where analyses were carried out on objects made entirely of silver sheet or on silver com- ponents mechanicallyjoined to gold sheet, three were quite pure (0.7-1.1 percent copper, with no gold detected). The other three were found to contain 2.0-3.6 percent copper with, in one case, an addition- al 1.3 percent gold (also see Appendix). The location and composition of silver sources used by the Moche have not, as yet, been investigated, but it is obvious that pure silver was available. It also seems quite likely that the Moche added gold and copper to silver to produce alloys not known to occur in nature,70 and that they chose specific natural and arti- ficial alloys for different cultural or practical reasons. In the six instances where the silver was employed in the manufacture of objects that do not have metallur- gical joins, one must assume that melting point or other working properties related to the application of heat were not factors in the choice of metal. Whereas the color of gold is altered by the presence of even small amounts of additional metals, changes in the color or sheen of silver are optically less evident even as moderate amounts of copper and gold are added.71 Therefore it is conceivable that color did not greatly affect the decisions concerning the alloying of the silver used for the Loma Negra hammer-welded nose ornament. The different degree or quality of pol- ish attainable on different alloys may have been a fac- tor, but this question has not been investigated. Although the reason for choosing (and probably preparing) the silver alloy is not clear, the metal must have had some combination of physical-including visual-and mechanical properties that made it suit- able for combining with gold. In most cases, the corresponding silver and gold components of the hammer-welded objects studied have relatively similar melting points; on the Loma Negra nose ornament the gold and silver components melt at 960? and 92o?C, respectively. How melting point might relate to the diffusion coefficients of the two metals at elevated temperatures, and the role of concentration gradients associated with specific pairs of alloys, remain to be considered. Other properties, such as the two metals' relative malleabilities, that might have affected their ability to maintain adequate physical proximity during heating may also have played a role in choosing the alloys.72 In view of the multitude of variables, it is interesting to consider the two pectorals in the American Museum of Natural History attributed to the Chavin culture (see Figre 32). Each pectoral consists of eight alter- nating gold and silver bands. Analysis of the bands indicates that they are all ternary alloys. The composi- tions of the artificially alloyed silver-rich bands on both ornaments are nearly identical, averaging about 54 percent silver, 39 percent gold, with the remainder copper. This alloy melts at about 950oC. The gold-rich bands on one of the pectorals (41.0/3706) average 67 percent gold, 20 percent silver, with the remainder copper,73 which melts at approximately 88o?C, while on the second piece (41.0/3707) the average compo- sition of three of the gold-rich bands is 78 percent gold, 13 percent silver, with the remainder copper. The alloy melts at about 950oC, or at the same tem- perature as the alloy used for the silver-rich bands.74 What is notable in the appearance of the pectorals is the similarity in the colors of the different alloys; the alternation of the bands is evident today because the silver-rich ones are tarnished; when viewing cleaned areas on the reverse of the pectorals or modern stan- dards replicating the alloys used, one recognizes what great forethought and effort went into joining eight bands of metal that to our eyes are barely distinguish- able visually.75 VI. There are two silvered-gold objects from Loma Negra in the Metropolitan Museum. The embellish- ment of Loma Negra objects through the application of silver onto a gold substrate was previously noted by Lapiner,76 and by Lechtman, Erlij, and BarryJr.,77 but this phenomenon is generally unreported for Peruvian artifacts.78 As a rule, silvered gold is rare in all cultural contexts because, if for no other reason, gold is gener- ally regarded as the more precious or high-status metal.79 Silver coatings on gold artifacts from Sipan and La Mina have not been confirmed thus far. The first of the two silvered-gold artifacts is a nose ornament (MMA 1979.206.1223) that represents the head of a man wearing a feathered headdress and sev- eral pieces of jewelry (Figure 44). Both the obverse and reverse surfaces are gold, but on the obverse cer- tain details-the earflares, the necklace, the headband, and the top border of the feathers-are silvered. The nose is a separate, raised sheet of gold attached me- chanically with tabs, and the man's nose ornament and the dangles were cut from a solid silver sheet. The ornament is inserted into the septum of the nose and the dangles are suspended from silver wires, which are rectangular in section. The second silvered-gold artifact (MMA 1979. 206. 1226) is a flat, curved band divided into ten trape- zoidal fields, each containing a bird shown in profile (Figure 45). The birds are executed in low relief and 125</page><page sequence="18">/ Figure 47. Polished section of silvered-gold sheet from nose ornament band in Figure 45, electron backscattered image; arrows indicate string of voids delineating interface between silver layer and gold substrate (photo: Mark T. Wypyski) the fields are surrounded by raised borders. Once again only gold is visible on the surface of the reverse; on the obverse the birds and the borders are gold and the trapezoidal fields are silvered. Along the top edge are eleven small tabs that were used to attach the sheet to the upper half of a nose ornament, and when com- plete, the object would have been comparable in appearance to the snail nose ornament discussed ear- lier (see Figure 5). Although visual examination and radiographic analysis were helpful in characterizing these orna- ments, proof for their manufacture from partially silvered-gold sheet was obtained from the examination of polished sections. Viewed in section, the silver layers on the anthropomorphic nose ornament and the bird relief band are fairly irregular in thickness, averaging one and three microns, respectively. Scanning electron microscope elemental x-ray maps, electron backscatter images, and electron microprobe traces across the sec- tions document the distribution of gold and silver (Figures 46-48). It is interesting to note a marked accumulation of silver in an angular irregularity on the surface of the gold in the section of the nose ornament (Figure 46).80 The structures observed in the etched metallo- graphic sections indicate that in a later or final stage of manufacture, these artifacts were reheated sufficiently for the heavily cold-worked grains of the gold substrate to recrystallize and a certain degree of diffusion to occur. Unfortunately the silver coatings are far too thin for one to observe grain structure when using a con- ventional metallographic microscope, or other fea- tures that may be present. ..* . . : .... . .? , . . * _ * .... . .. Figure 48. Electron microprobe analyses of silver, gold, and copper across section of silvered gold sheet from nose orna- ment in Figure 44 Electron microprobe line scans across the silver- gold interfaces carried out on both sections indicate that the zone of diffusion is quite broad, particularly in relation to the thickness of the silver layer. On the sec- tion from the anthropomorphic nose ornament, where the discrete silver layer averages three microns in thickness, diffusion of substantial amounts of silver into the gold substrate occurred to an approximate depth of eight microns (Figure 48).81 At this time it remains unclear how these silver coat- ings were applied. It is obvious that neither depletion plating, which was widely used in pre-conquest South America to gild and silver copper substrates, nor elec- trochemical replacement plating, the mechanism pro- posed by Lechtman for the gilding and silvering of copper sheet from Loma Negra, could have been used to produce silver layers on gold. Mechanical joining also seems unlikely. In the manufacture of the bird-relief band it is pos- sible to recognize the following steps: the relief detail was chased into a sheet of gold cut to approximate the final shape; the obverse was silvered and then the raised areas-the birds and the borders-were abrad- ed to reveal the gold beneath; the band was then cut to its proper size and attached with tabs to its corre- sponding top half. Evidence for these steps can be found in radiographs (Figure 49) and in a careful examination of the band's silvered and unsilvered sur- faces. The gold areas are somewhat less radiopaque than the silvered-gold areas, but because of its extreme thinness (ca. one micron) and the low atomic weight of silver relative to that of gold, the silver layer is not responsible for the increased radiopacity. Caliper mea- 126 /</page><page sequence="19">Figure 49. Radiograph of silvered-gold nose ornament band from Figure 45 (photo: author) surements indicate that the silvered-gold sheet is thick- er than the unsilvered sheet but by more than can be accounted for by the addition of one micron of silver. Some thinning of the raised areas, all of which are unsilvered gold, may be attributed to the chasing process, but other observations, including polishing scratches and small silver islands on the gold surfaces, suggest that the gold areas are thinner because they were abraded during the selective removal of patches of silver from an overall silver layer. Most convincing is the fact that the very top edge of the band and the tabs extending from it are silvered. If the silver layer had been applied locally, it is unlikely that a millimeter- wide strip adjacent to the gold border, or the tabs, would have been silvered; the presence of silver on the tabs implies that the layer had been applied to the entire obverse surface. Evidence of an overall applica- tion and selective removal of a silver layer on the anthropomorphic silvered-gold nose ornament was not observed. An interesting and as yet unexplained phenomenon is the presence of mercury on the surface of the bird- relief band. Whereas mercury gilding, also called fire or amalgam gilding, was widely used in many ancient and historic Old World contexts, its use on objects from pre-conquest Peru has never been confirmed.82 Amalgam silvering on gold is metallurgically possible, though it was rarely, if ever, carried out anywhere in the ancient world.83 There are sources of elemental mer- cury in Peru, but it is not clear that they were exploit- ed before the Spanish conquest.84 However, the mineral cinnabar, a mercuric sulfide with the formula HgS,, had widespread use as a pigment for painting and during burial seems occasionally to have been sprinkled in powdered form on bodies of deceased individuals, or on the grave goods that accompanied them in death.85 In any event, as indicated by electron microprobe analysis of the section from the bird-relief band, mer- cury is present both in the rather spongy silver surface layer and concentrated in visually discrete structures on the surface itself, where minute specks of gold can be observed as well (Figure 50). Minimal amounts of mercury were detected in the gold substrate. In situ x-ray diffraction analysis of the surface of the band and elemental analysis of the section proved unsuccessful in identifying a mercury-containing compound.86 Red pigment present on the surfaces of several pieces from Loma Negra has been identified as cinnabar, and it is possible that the mercury is due to the subsequent decay of cinnabar that had been sprinkled during buri- al onto the surface of the nose ornament to which this band belonged, or onto a neighboring object. The sub- limation of cinnabar, which occurs at 583?C, would pre- sumably leave a mercury residue on the surface; there is, however, nothing to suggest that the bird-relief band was heated after burial. Mercury independent of cinnabar was not detected on the silvered-gold nose ornament, nor on any other Moche object thus far analyzed. VII. There is an unprovenanced Moche nose orna- ment in the American Museum of Natural History (41.2/8676) that was also made from partially silvered gold (Figure 51). In this case, because of the poor preservation of the silver layer, it is possible in many areas to observe the formerly silvered gold substrate and to gauge the thickness of the silver layer, which is significantly greater than those present on the two Loma Negra ornaments. The differences observed in both the macroscopic and radiographic features of the unprovenanced silvered-gold nose ornament on one hand and the two Loma Negra pieces described above point to the use of different working methods that led to a similar result. It was noted above that the areas of silvered-gold sheet on the Loma Negra ornaments are slightly more radiopaque than gold areas, where it appears that a sil- ver layer was intentionally abraded away. Exactly the opposite is true for the unprovenanced nose orna- ment, where the silvered-gold areas are considerably less radiopaque than the plain gold sheet (Figure 52). The unsilvered gold substrate is approximately 0.18 millimeter thick, while in the formerly silvered areas, where the silver has been lost due to corrosion and probably from a cleaning undertaken after the orna- 127</page><page sequence="20">A B A I I Figure 50.

In this case it appears that the method of application involved the removal of gold from the surface before the application of the silver layer, rather than the application of an overall silver layer locally removed by abrasives. It is possible that the silver was applied as sheet and hammer-welded in place, or using a method related to the fusion and dif- fusion processes proposed by David Scott for the gild- Figure 51.

VIII. There is a single example of precious metal inlays secured using metallurgical means that can be observed on one of a pair of silver-and-gold scepters from tomb 1 at Sipan. The substrate is the solid cast- silver shaft.88 Gold has been inlaid in a series of spiral- ing channels cast and/or scored into two war clubs that Figure 52.

The surfaces of the gold inlays are globular and, for the most part, below the surface level of the silver substrate. In the few instances where the gold had been higher when first applied, it was smeared, apparently during manufacture, across the silver, so that the surfaces are now more or less flush. Minute amounts of gold were also applied to the con- vex silver surfaces of two "stones" shown in slings wrapped around the war clubs. In this case the gold does not appear globular, nor to have been set into a deep recess. It can be proposed that the gold inlay was applied in a semi-molten state, but a rigorous exami- nation is necessary in order to discover the precise methods of application of both the gold inlays and overlays; the method used for the latter may be related to that used to apply silver to a gold surface on the unprovenanced nose ornament in the American Museum of Natural History described above and, in any case represents a rare, if small-scale, occurrence of gilded silver in Peru that predates the Lambayeque culture. IX. One method for combining gold and silver used by the Moche seems, thus far, to be unique to La Mina. It appears on several similar gold zoomorphic trumpets, to which silver has been applied using two methods.89 One method is inlay, probably of the first type, using an organic adhesive, described for the Sipan material, and the second appears to involve the fusion of silver strips onto the surface of the gold. A full examination of the trumpets would be necessary to determine the precise details of their manufacture. DISCUSSION It is clear that the visualjuxtaposition of silver and gold was highly significant to the Moche. In addition to the use of gold and silver within a single composite work, gold and silver objects themselves were sometimes arranged to express a specific, dualistic relationship between the two metals. In Sipan tomb 1, excavated by the Bruning Museum, three pairs of objects in gold and silver versions-ingots, backflaps, and tumis- were placed on the proper right and proper left sides, respectively, of the deceased.9? A similar right-left arrangement of pairs of gold-and-silver backflaps and bells was found at Sipan in tomb 3, the burial of a man believed to have held a similar position in the Moche hierarchy, but in an earlier period.91 This phenome- non is thus far known only from Sipan because evi- dence for this type of arrangement, should it exist, can be ascertained only for artifacts obtained through excavation. The association of gold and silver with the right and left sides of the human body has also been observed on composite silver-and-gold objects, such as the famous peanut bead necklace from tomb 1 at Sipan (Figure 53) and on hammer-welded nose ornaments from Loma Negra (Figure 29) and Sipan,92 and nose ornaments attributed to the Vicuis culture (Figure 34).93 Whereas the finds at Sipan suggest that in bur- ial contexts at that site and/or for specific personages there was a symbolic association between gold and the right side of the human body, and silver with the left, compositionally most Moche composite objects are not bisected by a single vertical line of symmetry that separates two mirror-image fields of different color, nor are gold and silver limited to one side or the other of a central axis (see Figures 4, 5, 7, 9-1 1, 14, 17, 22, 31, 44, 45, 51).94 Viewed in terms of the effort and creativity that went into the manufacture of the composite artifacts dis- cussed in this article, one might suggest that the inter- est of the Moche in the visualjuxtaposition of gold and silver was unlimited. "Whyjuxtapose silver and gold on a single object?" "Why cover copper with a layer of gold?" "Why fashion an object of solid gold in one instance and the same object from gilt copper in another?" To these questions that Heather Lechtman posed while reflecting on the lectures presented at the colloquium/workshop "Andean Royal Tombs, Works of Art in Metal,"95 one might add: Why devise so many methods of manufacture to create a specific visual effect? Are these sumptuous ornaments the work of a people for whom innovation, or variety, or the mastery of the physical world through the manipulation of raw matter, was a value of cultural significance? A prelimi- nary examination of Vicus metalwork suggests that Vicus metalsmiths also depended on a considerable range of methods for combining gold and silver; per- haps this tendency or desire to juxtapose these metals embodies a specific level or quality of contact between the Moche and Vicus cultures; alternately, one might suggest that this technical and visual aesthetic is a development of the Early Intermediate Period in the north central Andes rather than a specifically Moche phenomenon. In considering this question one should look also to the composite silver-and-gold artifacts attributed to the problematic Frias culture, associated with a site of the same name in the highlands just northeast of Loma Negra and neighboring Vicus cul- ture sites and thought to be contemporaneous in date. Having adopted and developed these techniques, how did the Moche metalworker choose the method or methods that would be used in the manufacture of 129</page><page sequence="22">a specific object? The evidence from the existing cor- pus of Moche metalwork suggests that there are regional variations in the types of objects executed in gold and silver, just as one observes that certain meth- ods seem to be favored at one or another of the three main sites. What combination of various and interre- lated factors, such as date of manufacture, local tradi- tions, type and function of the artifact, social status of the owner, availability of resources, and working prop- erties of materials, formed a preference for one man- ufacturing method over another? Our hope is that, with further study and thought, we might begin to assign cultural values to the different technological processes used to create these objects and thereby might explain a particular confluence of artifact and manufacture. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I would like to thankJames H. Frantz, conservator-in- charge of the Sherman Fairchild Center for Objects Conservation of the MMA, for his ongoing generous support of my research. I am indebted to Julie Jones, Department of the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas, MMA, and to Ellen G. Howe and Richard E. Stone of the Sherman Fairchild Center, for their time and expertise, which were essential for the formulation and execution of this research. Samantha Alderson, Sarah Nunberg, and Leesa Vere-Stevens all provided information about the Loma Negra material gleaned in the course of the examinations and conservation treatments they undertook during their internships at the Sherman Fairchild Center; George S. Wheeler carried out the open architecture x-ray diffraction analysis; and Mark T. Wypyski carried out numerous analyses for this research, offered his expertise in their interpretation, and provided electron back-scatter images and elemental dot maps. Lawrence Becker of the Worcester Art Museum and Heidi King of the Department of the Arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas, MMA, repeatedly offered useful commentary and advice. Heather Lechtman of the Center for Materials Research for Archaeology and Ethnography at MIT provided much encouragement as well as stim- ulating discussion about Loma Negra and Sipan. In addition I must acknowledge an enormous debt to Lechtman's writings, which have established a theoret- ical basis for much of the contemplation that went into this article. I am grateful to Craig Morris, Judith Levinson, and Barbara Conklin (formerly) of the American Museum of Natural History; to Nancy Rosoff, Scott Merritt, and Mary Mooney of the National Museum of the American Indian; and to Elizabeth H. Boone and the late Carol Callaway, both formerly of Dumbarton Oaks, for generously facilitat- ing the examination and loan of Peruvian metalwork in their care. Richard Newman of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, carried out electron-microscopic analy- ses. Ulrike Bunte of the Linden-Museum Stuttgart, Staatliches Museum fur Volkerkunde, was kind enough to examine the Moche mask and its docu- mentation on a moment's notice. My thanks go also to Christopher B. Donnan of the Fowler Museum of Cultural History at the University of California at Los Angeles for providing access to the Moche Archive, for facilitating my examination of metalwork from Sipan, and for answering my many queries on Moche culture.

Lechtman, "Andean Value Systems and the Development of Prehistoric Metallurgy," Technology and Culture 25 (1984) pp. 1-36, esp. p. 15. 2. The following periods of central Andean prehistory and north- ern Peruvian cultures are discussed in this article: Initial Period (ca. 18oo-ca. 900 B.C.); Early Horizon (ca. 9oo-ca. 200 B.C.); Early Intermediate Period (ca. 200 B.C.-ca. A.D. 600); Middle Horizon (ca. A.D. 600-ca. lOOO); Late Intermediate Period (ca. looo-ca. 1475); Late Horizon (ca. 1475-1534). The dates defining these periods and cultures are under constant revision; those cited here are found in Richard W. Keatinge, preface in Peruvian Prehistory, Richard W. Keatinge, ed. (Cambridge, Mass., 1988) pp. xiii-xvii; for other recent chronologies, see Michael E. Moseley, The Incas and Their Ancestors (London, 1992) pp. 16-21; Heather N.

Bruhns, Ancient South America (Cambridge, Mass., 1994) pp. 7-14. 3. The development of copper metallurgy, and particularly sys- tems for gilding and silvering copper surfaces, while beyond the scope of this article, was a major technological development of the Early Intermediate Period. 4.

Lothrop also men- tions a few specimens of poorly documented Early Horizon Paracas silver said to have been found by Tello at Cerro Colorado in south- ern Peru; see Samuel K. Lothrop, "Gold and Silver from Southern Peru and Bolivia," Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland 67 (1937) pp. 305-325, esp. p. 306. Lechtman, in "Traditions and Style," p. 235, suggests that the use of silver dates at least as far back as ca. 700 B.C., at the beginning of the Early Horizon. The Gallinazo culture dates to the early years of the Early Intermediate Period and was centered in the Viri Valley, south of the Moche valley. 6. See notes 57, 60 below. 7.

Representative gilded- and silvered-copper objects from Loma Negra were studied by Heather N. Lechtman, Antonieta Erlij, and EdwardJ. BarryJr., who, in "New Perspectives on Moche Metallurgy: Techniques of Gilding Copper at Loma Negra, Northern Peru," American Antiquity 47 (1982) pp. 3-30, hypothesized the use of an electrochemical replacement plating method on all of the artifacts examined with the exception of a pair of earflares, see note 37 below; see also Heather N.

See, for example, Lechtman, "Traditions and Style," p. 344. Based on the paucity of cast objects found at Sipan, a metal-rich Moche site in Lambayeque Valley discovered in 1987, this does not seem remarkable. 16. Disselhoff, "Metallschmuck," p. 46. 17.

The first portion of the Loma Negra corpus accessioned by the MMA came from the Museum of Primitive Art in 1979 as part of the Nelson A. Rockefeller Bequest. Loma Negra objects formerly in the Arnold I. Goldberg collection were donated to the MMA in sev- eral phases, starting in 1980. A number of Loma Negra artifacts are illustrated in Lapiner, Pre-Columbian Art, nos. 347, 349-355, 357-361, 363, 365-369, 376-382,385-386, 388-397. 26. Crescent ornaments, which may be ceremonial axes, are known only from the Vicus region. Examples are illustrated in Disselhoff, "Metallschmuck," figs. 3-5, 8-io, 12, 15, 17, and in Lapiner, Pre-Columbian Art, nos. 347, 360, 361, 365. 27.Jones, "Welcome." 28. Nine additional composite objects or pairs of objects, and two components of gold that were used in composite constructions, all belonging to various private collections, were documented in the Loma Negra Archive in the early 1970s. Some composite silver-and- gold objects attributed to the Vicfis culture in catalogues of the Museo Oro del Peru are now thought to have come from Loma Negra; see Miguel Mujica Gallo, Catalogue Museo "Oro del Peri" (Lima, 1970) e.g., nos. 16, 17. One Loma Negra composite silver-and-gold nose ornament in a private collection appears in Lapiner, Pre- Columbian Art, no. 397. See also note 61 below. 29.

Wypyski on a Kevex model Delta IV energy-dispersive x-ray spectrometer with a modified Amray model ooo (16ooT) scanning electron microscope operat- ing at a voltage of 30 kV. The data were quantified with Kevex soft- ware using MAGIC IV ZAF corrections for standardless analysis and are reported in relative weight percentages of elements detected. 33. The analyses were carried out by Richard Newman on a Cameca electron beam microprobe equipped with a Tracor- Northern 5502 energy-dispersive x-ray fluorescence system with stage automation at the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences 133</page><page sequence="26">of Harvard University. The microprobe was calibrated with gold, sil- ver, copper, and cinnabar standards, and matrix corrections were carried out using ZAF (fundamental parameters) method. 34. Heather N. Lechtman and Arthur Steinberg, "BronzeJoining: A Study in Ancient Technology," in Art and Technology: A Symposium on Classical Bronzes, Suzannah Doeringer, David G. Mitten, and Arthur Steinberg, eds. (Cambridge, Mass., 1970) pp. 5-35. Mechanical joining processes are based on the production of metal components that can be hammered, crimped, bent, or tied in place, sometimes with the use of rivets, wires, and tabs. Two other possibilities exist: cast components can be designed so that they interlock after casting, orcomponents can be cast together. Moche composite gold-and-sil- ver artifacts were nearly always made from hammered rather than cast components, and only the first of the three mechanical meth- ods outlined by Lechtman and Steinberg has been observed. 35. See Lechtman et al., "New Perspectives," p. 7, and Lechtman, "Traditions and Style," pp. 360-362. The entirely silver objects sur- viving from Loma Negra are simple nose ornaments whose manu- facture did not require joining. 36. See Alva and Donnan, Royal Tombs, fig. 166. 37. The backplates of the frontals and the shafts are gilded- copper sheet, and the earflares are one of two pairs of objects from Loma Negra known to have depletion gilded components; Lechtman, "Andean Value Systems," fig. 5; Silvia A. Centeno and Deborah Schorsch, "The Charaterization of Gold Layers on Copper Artifacts from the Piura Valley (Peru) in the Early Intermediate Period," in Gilded Metals, Terry Drayman Weisser, ed. (forthcoming). 38. The MMA earflare frontal, while it was still in the Museum of Primitive Art, was described by Lapiner (Pre-Columbian Art, no. 380) as having a silvered-gold web, a misperception that probably arose from the presence of a grayish sulfide tarnish on the gold surface. 39. Pressure-fitting is a mechanical joining method that involves preparing metal-sheet components that can be hammered to fit tightly together without tabs, wires, etc. 40. An exception is a nose ornament in the National Museum of the American Indian ( 15/901) composed of a gold bead on a silver wire. 41. Most of the other eight disks from Loma Negra in the MMA are made of gilded copper. Two examples are illustrated in Lapiner, Pre-Columbian Art, nos. 363, 366. A number of disk ornaments not documented in the Loma Negra Archive are found in the American Museum of Natural History. 42. Surface layers on components marked with an asterisk were not analyzed. 43. This and other analyses of silvered and gilded surfaces pre- sumed to be applied by electrochemical deposition were normalized by the subtraction of copper, which, in such cases, would be present almost exclusively due to the migration of copper from the substrate during burial; see Centeno and Schorsch, "Oro y Plata." 44. The data plotted in Figure 16 derive from SEM analyses car- ried out at the MMA Sherman Fairchild Center for Objects Conservation and from published analyses that appear in Salvador Rovira, "Pre-Hispanic Goldwork from the Museo de America, Madrid: A New Set of Analysis," in Archaeometry of Pre-Columbian Sites and Artifacts: Proceedings of a Symposium Organized by the UCLA Institute of Archaeology and the Getty Conservation Institute, Los Angeles, March 23-2 7, 1992, David A. Scott and Pieter Meyers, eds. (Malibu, 1994) pp. 323-35o, and in Kroeber, Peruvian Archaeology, p. 132. For these and other analyses subsequently carried out at the Sherman Fairchild Center, see Schorsch et al., "Manufacture and Aesthetics." 45. See the Chavin pectorals discussed on page 125. 46. Jones, "Mochica," figs. 19, 20; Schorsch et al., "Manufacture and Aesthetics." 47. Heather Lechtman has written extensively about the signifi- cance of color in ancient Peruvian metalwork. 48. A similar effect, attained through the juxtaposition of plain and textured surfaces that have different reflective properties and therefore appear to be of slightly different colors, can be observed on a Loma Negra gilded-copper openwork disk, decorated with con- centric bands of sea creatures (MMA 1987.384.46); Schorsch et al., "Manufacture and Aesthetics." 49. The metal is erroneously described as copper sheet in Lecht- man et al., "New Perspectives," p. 6. 50. A sample of wood removed from the inside of this artifact pro- vided a carbon-14 date of A.D. 295 ? 95 years; Lechtman et al., "New Perspectives," p. 5. 51. A mask in a private collection attributed to the Vicfis culture is described as having been made from mirror-image gilded- and silvered-copper sheets joined with a metal "staple"; see Museum zu Allerheiligen, Idole Masken Menschen: Friihe Kulturen, Alte Welt und Neue Welt, exh. cat. (Schaffhausen, 1992) no. 5.18. 52. Attempts to identify natural resins used on artifacts from Loma Negra have thus far proved unsuccessful. 53. A method of inlay more familiar to students of Old World met- allurgy appears much later and becomes widespread in Peru only in Inka times. In that case the metal to be inlaid is formed or cut to size and hammered into existing channels; seeJulieJones, Art of Empire: The Inca ofPeru, exh. cat., Museum of Primitive Art (NewYork, 1964) fig. 38. 54. Heather N. Lechtman, "The Central Andes: Metallurgy with- out Iron," in Coming of the Age of Iron, Theodore Wertime andJames D. Muhly, eds. (New Haven, 1980) pp. 267-334, esp. p. 286; Lechtman, "Traditions and Style," p. 360. 55. Howe et al., "Technical Overview"; of the hundreds examined, nine individual objects or pairs of objects were found to have been joined with solder. With the exception of the silver-and-gold com- posite nose ornament discussed here, these examples were made from gold or gilded-copper sheet. As used in this essay, the term sol- dering refers to high-temperature, or hard, soldering, which is gen- erally referred to as brazing in the metallurgical industry; see Deborah Schorsch, "Copper Ewers of Early Dynastic and Old Kingdom Egypt-An Investigation of the Art of Smithing in Antiquity," Mitteilungen des Deutschen Archdologischen Instituts Abtei- lungKairo48 (1992) pp. 146-159, esp. p. 152. 56. Two composite nose ornaments not in the MMA that are known from photographs in the Loma Negra Archive are also likely to have been assembled with solder. 57. Solder was used to join some gold components to each other and may well also have been used for gold-to-silverjoins; Lechtman, "Bimetallic Effigy Spoon" (cat. entry), in Andean Art at Dumbarton Oaks I, pp. 55-66. 58. Samuel K. Lothrop, "Gold Ornaments of Chavin Style from Peru," American Antiquity 6 (1940-41) pp. 250-262, esp. pp. 258-260, pl. xxc. Solder is not visible in the radiographs of the pin, neither on gold-to-gold or gold-to-silver joins. The joins may have 134</page><page sequence="27">been produced by fusing, which is executed at elevated tempera- tures without the introduction of a filler metal. 59. Compare Lechtman, "Traditions and Style," p. 263. 60. A sample of the solder used tojoin one of the backplates to the web from the nose ornament was analyzed and found to contain 52.8% silver, 33.0% copper, and 14.2% gold. The composition of the solder used on the Loma Negra gilded-copper warrior figures is entire- ly different, containing 48.5% gold, 27.7% silver, and the remainder copper (Howe et al., "Technical Overview"). Copper-silver solders have also been noted on Moche gold objects (Lechtman et al., "New Perspectives," pp. 38-42), as has the use of both gold- and silver-based soldering alloys on Chavin gold (Lechtman, "The Central Andes," p. 286). At the present time there are too few analyses of Moche solders to compare with these data or to evaluate what combination of factors, aesthetic and practical, affected their formulation. 61. In addition, not included in the archive is a hammer-welded Loma Negra nose ornament in the American Museum of Natural History (41.2/6983). 62. Donnan, "Oro," figs. 127, 128, 130, 131. 63.

Objects were sampled on outer edges away from hammer- welded joins so that the analyses more or less reflect the metal as originally formulated and unaffected by diffusion that occurred at the joins. 70.

Preliminary hammer-welding replication experiments were undertaken by Robert Baines during his residency at the Sherman Fairchild Center. 73. This average is based on the analysis of three of the four gold- rich bands. 74. The fourth gold-rich band contains about 85% gold, which raises the melting point to approximately 975?C. 75. These pectorals are discussed by Lechtman in Benson, Dumbarton Oaks, p. 74 and no. 29. 76. Lapiner, Pre-Columbian Art, nos. 380, 393; see note 38. 77.

The famous mask from Huaca de la Luna in the Linden- Museum Stuttgart Staatliches Museum ffir Volkerkunde ( 119-156) is described in a recent publication as partially silvered gold; Donnan, "Oro," p. 124. The piece had been previously published by other scholars as gilded and painted copper (e.g., Jones, "Mochica," p. 70), which was reconfirmed by Ulrike Bunte of the Linden- Museum, who recently examined the mask (Bunte, personal com- munication with author). Visual examination of a specific type of composite silver-and-gold Vicus nose ornaments indicates that they were partially silvered, but as yet no analyses have been undertaken. There is a partially silvered gold bowl, attributed to the Huari culture of the Middle Horizon, in the Museo Nacional de Arqueologia, Antropologia y Historia in Lima. 79. P. Andrew Lins, "A History of Metal Coatings on Metals Pre- 1800 AD (unpublished manuscript, 1974; British Museum Depart- ment of Scientific Research Reference Library 669 [031]) p. 20, cites an unusual case of an oblong piece of gold wrapped in silver sheet from predynastic Egypt. Several authors have noted Chinese amalgam silvered bronzes that have a gold layer between the silver and the bronze. It has recently been suggested that the presence of a gold layer improves the adhesion of the silver; Kilian Anheuser, "An Investigation of Amalgam Gilding and Silvering on Metalwork" (Ph.D. diss., University of Oxford, 1996) p. 14. 80. The large patch of copper visible in the elemental dot map corresponds to the presence of copper corrosion products on the inner surfaces of the irregularity. 81. All microprobe analyses were carried out with a point beam. An area of approximately three microns in diameter generates the x-rays detected in a single analysis.Therefore, as most of the succes- sive points analyzed are only 0.5-2.0 microns apart, there is consid- erable overlap. 82.

In Moche burials traces of a red pigment that has not been analyzed are often found on the frontal bones and eye orbits of the deceased, and a unique case where the floor of a Moche tomb was covered with red pigment, also unidentified, was found in Sipan; Alva and Donnan, Royal Tombs, pp. 91, 215. 86. The scans were carried out on a Phillips 1710 open architec- ture diffractometer using copper radiation. No crystalline phases were detected. 87. David A.

For example, in tomb 2 at Sipan in the burial of a man who has been tentatively identified as a "Bird Priest," a gold-and-silver nose ornament and a composite backflap were placed so that their gold and silver halves corresponded to the right and left sides of the deceased's body; Alva and Donnan, Royal Tombs, pp. 148-160, 163-165, figs. 160 (left), 166. 93. Composite nose ornaments of this type are occasionally worn by Moche and Vicus personages represented in clay vessels; see Lapiner, Pre-Columbian Art, nos. 445, 451; Christopher B. Donnan, Ceramics of Ancient Peru (Los Angeles, 1992) cat. no. 121. 94. Furthermore, adherence to strict right and left placements of gold and silver artifacts, respectively, around the body of the deceased in burials is not observed. A pair of nose ornaments, one of gold and the second of silver, was found one on top of the other on the right side of the deceased's cranium, believed to be a "Warrior Priest," in tomb 3 at Sipan; Alva, Sipdn, figs. 72, 74. 95.
