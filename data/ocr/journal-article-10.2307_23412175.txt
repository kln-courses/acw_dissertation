<plain_text><page sequence="1">Carved and Painted Works of the Torricellis, West Sepik Province, Papua New Guinea Barry Craig South Australian Museum Abstract A chance discovery of some unfamiliar carved and painted objects in the collections of the South Aus tralian Museum prompted research into their prove nance and cultural context. Advice from various colleagues led to the uncovering of a little-known archive offield notes, photographs and film by E.A Briggs, a University of Sydney zoologist who walked through the western Torricelli Mountains in 1925-26. This archive, and clues provided by a tribal art col lector and dealer, led to a field trip by the author in 2002, using images and sequences from the Briggs film on a laptop computer to elicit comments about rare and unusual objects depicted in the photographs and film from informants in thirteen villages repre senting six of the Torricelli Phylum of Papuan lan guages. A review of sources of data available to me and email communications with colleagues who have conducted long-term research in the region indicate the existence during the first half of last century of a rich visual culture associated with complex ritual ac tivity that has now been supplanted by at least a nominal adherence to Christianity. In this paper I do not attempt to pursue a particular theoretical ap proach to the data but rather to gather examples of this visual culture and associated information, as few people have hitherto been aware of it. This survey es tablishes that the Torricelli peoples had a rich visual Fig. 1. Top to bottom: A. 18801 to 18803, Thomas col lection, SA Museum. 65, 72 and 89 cm long respec tively.

Future work can fur ther explore the cultural significance of the carvings and paintings reported in this paper and the relation ships between this and other cultures in the Sepik re gion. Introduction About fifteen years ago I was in the Foreign Ethnol ogy Store of the South Australian Museum looking for something when I came across three rather cruaeiy carvea ana pamtea soiiwooa oojects mat puzzled me (Fig. 1). I had not seen anything like tnese oeiore, eimer in museums or puDiications. 1 made a note of the registration numbers to see if the museum's records could throw light on their origin and runction. it turned out mat these were collected by Kenneth Thomas, an Adelaide man who was a pa troi omcer ror tne territory 01 New uuinea aaminis tration, 1927-34. He obtained them from the 'Central Wapi oi the Torncelh Mountains (West Sepik/San daun Province) during a patrol from his base at Aitape ana aescnoea tnem as carvings, usea in dances, worn by a string round the waist, ... in a sex dance . . . in all probability, phallic objects.

In lyyy I gave a paper on the I nomas collec tion at the sixth International Symposium of the Pa chic Ans Association at r îeia Museum in cmcago, which was subsequently published (Craig 2002). I hat paper provided as much intormation about the three carved objects and the female figure that I had at the time, including the fact that soon after the 1999 Symposium, John Friede provided me with a photo araoh (Tia. 3) taken bv Michael Hamson. a tribal art collector and dealer, of similar figures at the Gnau speaking village of Rauit, just over seven kilometers îast of Wititai. 1 his prompted me in zUUO to seek out Gilbert Lewis who did long-term research based at Rauit in the late 1960s. Thus began a conversation between myself, Bill Mitchell and Gilbert Lewis that sought to clarify the significance of the mysterious objects collected by Thomas and of those photo graphed and filmed by Briggs. I soon realized that it would be necessarv for me to an fn the Tnrrirelli vil lages with photographs, and sequences of the Briggs film, to discover what the people could recall of these hir&gt;rrc Phriotian miccinnarioc Knfk PofKnlip nnrl Protestant, had been active in the region since World War II so I was keen to use the most effective means .\j icuicvc imuiiiuuiuii duuui uujeuis anu piauuces :hat in all probability had been abandoned several iecades ago. 1 was able to view a copy of the Briggs film and the original Briggs diaries at the University of Sydney, and the Australian Film and Sound Archive provided ready access to a taped version of his film from which I was able to select sequences to get digi h7ed for çhnwincr nn a lantnn rnmnntpr Thn rliarips enabled me to trace Briggs's journey on a map (4 ik *'t o, a • n • i ' . 1 rx ^ a\ ,i t i i Lvint ouaitgiv^ otnts, /Aiiapc, iy-fz.) uiai 1 luuaicu among the Thomas papers,2 and identify where some of the cinematic images had been taken.

I have also been sent by Eric Coote, Gilbert Lewis and Bill Mitchell better copies of some of the Briggs photographs I had in 2002, and other images. I was also alerted to another article published by Briggs in 1927 that was particularly valuable for identifying villages where some of the photographs in that article were taken, and for information not in Briggs's diary.

Cultural Context For readers unfamiliar with Sepik ethnographies, it mav be helpful to orovide a sketch of the cultural context. In general, peoples in this region of northern New Guinea believe in the immanence of spirits, that their presence may be manifested in and through nat uiai piieiiumciia anu inuuccu lu îiiiiauii uiaueu ud jects. These spirits may be antagonistic, benign, or (&gt;nnrtûtiin1 nnrl ; t *-»/-» 11 1 ri a p r&gt; i ri tp tU r Various rituals, usually managed by men, were per formed to deal with these spirit manifestations, for protection and to harness their powers for good and sometimes for ill. Men tended to keep this ritual knowledge se cret from women and children. Stages of initiation of boys and young men involved a progressive introduc tion to and revelation of this secret ritual knowledge. tion of boys into this knowledge and into manhood, the rituals and the associated paraphernalia ('tam L/UlUllO f 1V/VJUHV t* 111V11 O VUll 11UUJV/ y 11UUJ LUI 1 i L/Ul Cil 1 in Tok Pisin). Such buildings were often larger than, and sometimes of different construction to, ordinary dwellings.

During ceremonies, the tigure was tied to a male performer's back. A second informant named the figure Mami ('grandmother'), an ancestor of Wititai, and con firmed that the string net bag (tanuk) contained magi cal substances. The spirit of the figure helped in knntmrt anrl xuorforp onrl /-v-f* young men through certain rituals requiring the blood of hunted animals or slain enemies to be rubbed on the figure to empower it. However, he said that the figure was not carried about by a performer but kept ni me men s nouse. mis particular ngure, me men said, was carved so long ago they didn't know the name of the carver. They did know the story of the :ircumstances of its removal from the village in 1932 by Kenneth Thomas when their men's cult house burnt down (Craig 2002:204-5).

In 2002 I was told that the spirit of the Sombat figure can cause illness and the ceremony involving the fig ure was to prevent illness, ooth Hamson and I were told that the figure was carried by a man on his back but Lewis could not confirm this fnersonal communi cation, 31 May 2011).

The figure was anointed with the blood of hunted animals; 'It makes us strong!' An informant from Eikili village (also Yil speakers) living at Yili (Elkei speakers) provided a different story. He said the female figures were called kwamkei. They were decorated with a string net bag and nassa shells, and hung up at the open front of the men's houses. They were used in a ceremony to cure illness. Unfortunately, the men at Tangei (Piokom, Briggs's Beerkom) who also are Elkei speakers, could not (or would not) provide any information about these female figures so the possible confusion of inagal and kwamkei was not resolved. The only scrap of information about female ligures from among the Olo speakers ot Central Wapi was from an old man at Wabutei, north of Fatima Catholic Mission. He claimed the figure represented a froe. was called fuve.i and was carried on a ner former's back during ceremonies to cure a spleen sickness.6 Two other figures (Fig. 8) were collected from the Lumi-Anguganak area by the late Sue T~\ _ _ 1 1 1 1 1 . . * 1 1 - . 1 * _ uttivti, wiiujt Jiuauanu was invuivtu 111 iiiaiaiia it search for the World Health Organization in the late 1950s.

Une is now in the hands ol an anonymous dealer and the other is in the St Louis Museum of Art. These two are quite similar in style and are likely to be from the same village and perhaps were carved by the same man. They share some features with the Rauit figures collected by Hamson. In all, I was able to trace eight of these fig ures, representing female spirits with names varying according to language, but with a common function of effectiveness in ritual for curing or preventing ill npcc anH/rvr fr\r cupppcc in a^rrlpnino hnntino finri warfare.

Female Figures on Flat Boards, and with Lizard Like Tails There were also other kinds of female figures. These are known only from Briggs's photographs and movie film taken at Beerkom (Piokom, now Tangei, Elkei speakers). The men at Tangei claimed they knew nothing about the flat oval board (Fig. 9, left) or those with lizard-like tails (Fig. 9, right), except 11</page><page sequence="8">that their fathers or grandfathers once owned them. ter, to the PNG National Museum.

An examole collected bv Lewis was named Biguri (Fig. 10, right). He was told they were brought out if Wanitap was performed (see above).

At unau-speaking Kauit, a minimalist ver sion of these figures has been collected by Michael -ïamson (see fig. J and Mg. IU, center).

This situation is likely :o be the same for neighboring peoples as well. Phallic Objects [ now return to the objects that provoked my interest in the peoples and cultures of the Torricellis in the first place, the objects from 'Central Wapi' that Ken neth Thomas described as 'carvings, used in dances, worn by a string round the waist, ... in a sex dance ■ •'(Fig. 1). Briggs photographed a man at hpiou (Olo speakers) wearing one of these objects (Fig. 14, left). At Miwautei (Epeou), I was told that they were :alieasiiDi ^wna KapoK tree; Decause uiey were :arved from that soft wood. The leaves on the young man's head (who was identified as Kibinau, grandfa ther of Stephan Sio) were of the 'tanget' plant (cordy line - file welfangei). In the Briggs film, he can be seen in a ring of dancers circling four 'devil fish turn buans'. He was described to me in Tok Pisin as a clown: 'Emi mekim fani [funny]'. At the Olo villages ofKupoam and Wilium, the term silbi was confirmed as well as the 'clown ing' role; the Kupoam men added that the different "*— -1—— ~ ^ "» J n *v\ II rat»a v\ ri *-+1 Elliot" tA different clans or families.

However, Lewis did record the use of uncarved r\nrr TfAiinrr ilauit men 'in rites to mark the completion of certain ;eremonies and the way the young men, wearing leaf iisguises, would burst out at night to scare women ind children' (personal communication, 31 May 2011). He remarks that people recalled this as for nerly serious and frightening; the performers were ;alled wivisi wolasi or mal at wolada (bad spirit). When he was doing fieldwork, in contrast, people &gt;aw it as 'fani' (funny, clowning). Briggs photographed thinner versions ot the Dlo silbi at Elkei-speaking Tebali (Fig. 14, right).

Bnggs photographed this assemblage (Mg. Oj ana published it in his 1927 article (p. 133). This may cor respond to the arrangements he photographed at Beerkom, and Lewis photographed at Rauit (Fig. 12). The phallic objects used by Ulo, Jbikei and Gnau peoples, and perhaps others, may be compared to the long or large gourd phallocrypts found among Upper Sepik and Border Mountains groups (see Gell 1971; Mitchell 1975).

There are two locations of Kapoam: one close to the present-day site of the Roman Catholic Mission, Fatima; the other is on the northern slopes of the Torricellis, about 14 kilometers south of Aitape. The evidence suggests that Thomas col lected the shield from the latter site (see Craig, Lewis and Mitchell 2008:245). 2 There was a map with the Briggs Diaries indicating the route of the 1925-26 expedition but 1 did not see that until I accessed a microfilm of those diaries in 2010. Before 1 departed for the field trip in 2002,1 was therefore not cer tain about the location of Epiyu (Epeu/Epiou/Epeyou) or Beerkom (Piokom), which were not printed on the 4-Mile map). 3 Although I constantly remind the reader of the language spoken by each village mentioned in this paper, I am not implying a strict correspondence between language and particular elements of culture. Rather, it is necessary to name the language where I am reporting vernacular termi nology. 4 I shall use single quotes around words in Tok Pisin and italics for vernacular terms. I have chosen to simplify the transcription of vernacular words to the nearest Australian English equivalent; readers should be aware that some vowels and consonants are not accurately represented by this convention (see Lewis 2000:xxi and Glossary for Gnau pronunciation and spellings). 5 It must be kept in mind that evidence that has emerged since 2002 has in some ways made me wiser after the event and the gaps in my field data reflect the higher level of ignorance I carried with me into the field. 6 There is rarely pain from enlargement of the spleen but a rupture would most likely be felt on the left side of the ab domen; it is not clear whether there is some connection here with the similar name of a ceremony (fuwei) to cure an illness manifesting as fever and pain on the right side of the abdomen (cf. McGregor 1976/82:23) which is more likely a sign of gall or liver problems, or appendicitis. 7 The relationship between lizard and pond was not ex plained; perhaps the lizard incarnates the spirit that dwells in the pond. 8 The epigastrium is the area of the abdomen just below the sternum. 9 The 1935 earthquake had a devastating effect throughout the Torricelli Mountains (McCarthy 1963:157-8). 101 was made aware of the massive doctoral thesis of Hooshang Philsooph (1980), based on fieldwork among the Au speakers of Puang village, too late to read through carefully but a quick search did not identify any informa tion of relevance to the carved and painted works dis cussed in this paper. No doubt Philsooph did record data of relevance that he has not yet published. iy</page></plain_text>
