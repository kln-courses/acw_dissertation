<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> On Public Intellectuals and Their  Conceptual Frameworks Maria Todorova As we bemoan the posited general social irrelevance of our humanistic dis- ciplines (humanities and social sciences alike), the role of public intellectu- als becomes crucial. They have simultaneously three hypostases: of scholars,  moral philosophers, and consummate communicators. When properly done,  their work should bridge the chasm between the ivory tower and the public.  Public intellectuals have been defi ned diff erently. There is the loft y and exact- ing portrayal of Edward Said, who demands of public intellectuals “a relent- less erudition,” “a sense of the dramatic and the insurgent,” being superior  in debate, devoid of pomposity, meeting with self-irony “the inescapable re- ality” that they will make no friends in high places: “It is a lonely condition,  yes, but it is always a better one than a gregarious tolerance for the way things  are.”1 Against this, there is the neutral, more encompassing, almost anodyne  depiction of Alan Lightman, devoid of any evaluation: “Such a person is oft en  trained in a particular discipline, such as linguistics, biology, history, eco- nomics, literary criticism, and who is on the faculty of a college or university.  When such a person decides to write and speak to a larger audience than their  professional colleagues, he or she becomes a ‘public intellectual.’”2 In his essay here, as well as his numerous public appearances and contri- butions, Timothy Snyder assumes the role of the public intellectual. While I  would have loved to see him claim the exciting part scripted by Said, there is  no doubt that he satisfi es Lightman’s criteria. But even in this minimal defi - nition, the role of the public intellectual is a very diffi  cult one, especially in  keeping the necessary equilibrium between the public and the intellectual.  Since Snyder indicates from the outset that he has engaged several dozen  times in the public sphere on the issue of the Ukrainian crisis, I will address  here the intellectual side of his essay, given that an academic journal such  as Slavic Review, even as it seeks to open up to current and relevant public  debates, (hopefully) still emphasizes the intellectual aspects. Implicitly, Snyder’s essay raises important questions about the relation- ship between scholarship and politics, between pundits and scholars, be- tween hyperspecialized discourse and rhetoric. Explicitly, it is structured in  a tripartite way. There is a conclusion that is used as a premise, linked by  a scholarly argument to provide the proof. In logic this is called circulus in  probando, that is, circular reasoning. What we have as a premise is a “true  revolution,” mass killing, Ukrainian revolutionaries dying for Europe, Rus- sian counterrevolutionaries, and a foreign imperial invasion. This leads to  a similar conclusion but on a higher pitch of acrimony and buttressed by a  1. Edward Said, Representation of the Intellectual: The Reith Lectures (New York,  1994), xviii. 2.

What is  ironic is that here this public intellectual does not follow the usual way one is  supposed to reach the public, namely, unwrapping a complex argument and  translating it in a way the public can grasp it while at the same time retain- ing the complexity and providing a moral compass. What we have instead is  a simple, not to say simplistic, argument, wrapped in an obfuscating schol- arly garb that allegedly legitimizes it, so that at the end we encounter the  same argument but also with a new theory and a “scholarly apparatus [that]  might help us get some purchase on the phenomena of revolution and war and  some distance from the alternative reality of propaganda, whose tropes can  otherwise serve as a tempting substitute for thought.” The claim is thus laid  for a scholarly contribution, which is off ered not to the broad public but to a  particular audience—the academic readers of Slavic Review. This response is  mainly addressed to this scholarly claim. In his theoretical proposition, Snyder off ers as an overall framework a  binary opposition between integration and disintegration, which, in a bold  conceptual leap, is translated into colonization and decolonization. These  are, then, the main categories with which he operates throughout his essay.  Let me deal consecutively with the two pairs of concepts. “A historical frame- work that permits Ukraine to be seen as a subject and an object of projects of  integration and disintegration, as a link between European and global his- tory,” Snyder asserts, will facilitate understanding of the present confl ict. “In- tegration and disintegration” is indeed the safer bet between the two pairs  of dichotomies, and Snyder wisely uses it in his title, mainly because it is  diffi  cult to specify it historically. It is general enough to be universally appli- cable. But, then, what does it tell us concretely? How is it diff erent from any  cyclical (or even helical) view, from other dualities like centralization versus  secession, conquest versus resistance, subjugation versus opposition, or the  “rise and fall” genre? The Romans integrated the Mediterranean world and  then disintegrated. Over several millennia China experienced several waves  of integration (expansion) and disintegration (contraction). The Incas exerted  imperial rule before they themselves were conquered by the Spanish. And this  can be argued ad  infi nitum with endless historical examples, so the exercise  becomes meaningless. Snyder’s model, which creates a breathing, global Gaia  between gasps of integration and disintegration, serves as a receptacle for  Ukraine, aiming at the present moment to achieve an integrative Hegelian  Aufh ebung into the EU. In a leap of faith (based on the assertion that European and global his- tory are separated by the word colonial), the dichotomy integration/disinte- gration morphs into colonization/decolonization. However, and here comes  Snyder’s claim to a theoretical contribution, decolonization does not begin  in  twentieth-century Asia, Africa, and Latin America but in Europe, more  </page> <page sequence="3"> 710 Slavic Review specifi cally, the Balkans. Not only do they pioneer decolonization, goes the  argument, but their model of nationalism becomes more signifi cant than the  French one. This argument surreptitiously reproduces the divide between a western  and eastern type of nationalism, explained in Snyder’s essay as the diff erence  between antiroyal and anti-imperial projects. Republicanism was in fact one  of the main characteristics of the Balkan national ideologies (with the excep- tion of the Serbs), and the fact that they all ended up as monarchies under  German princes or kings tells us more about the imposition of great power  politics on small states, as well as international considerations at large, than  about the specifi cities of a putative “Balkan model.” Furthermore, by positing  that the Balkan model succeeded as a method of disintegration but failed as  a method of reintegration (into what? The then existing Habsburg empire or  the rising German Reich? Or a Danubian and Balkan federation, which was  mostly espoused by socialists, an anathema in Europe at the time?), Snyder  unwittingly raises the negative specter of Kleinstaaterei. Some thirty years ago, in his famous Imagined Communities, Benedict An- derson proposed a modular theory of nationalism starting in Latin America.  In his important and deservedly acclaimed book, this is the one aspect that is  usually left  in oblivion or criticized. Snyder proposes essentially a new modu- lar theory of nationalism ex ovo Balcanico, so I am compelled to look more  closely into it. If the Balkans pioneered decolonization, then we have to accept ipso facto  the Ottoman empire as a colonial empire, and the whole argument hinges  on this premise. There is a whole body of literature dealing with issues of  understanding and defi ning the categories of empire and imperialism and of  colonial empire and colonialism, as well as the diff erences between them.  The cavalier attitude toward the distinction between imperial and colonial is  striking. Aft er all, a very diff erent theoretical framing is at stake in each case.  In fact, most careful theorists lament that they are oft en used interchange- ably.3 What specifi cally makes an empire a colonial empire? Or, if we take  colonization in its literal sense as settling a territory, is any empire (or by that  count, any state) colonial at its inception? This is not the place to go over these  debates, but the point is that they do exist, and a lot hinges on the particular  way of defi ning the terms. Most theorists resort to diff erentiating typologies of empire—maritime  versus land or contiguous, premodern versus modern, formal versus informal.  There is, however, an overwhelming consensus that modern European over- seas empires from the sixteenth century onward, usually defi ned as “colonial  empires,” do present a qualitatively new phenomenon, and this has to do with  industry, mercantilism, and capitalism: “The essential point is that although  European colonialisms involved a variety of techniques and patterns of domi- 3.

I am selecting a spe- cifi c scale of observation in order to reach a historically specifi c and informed  view, in which time-bound and place-bound specifi city counts. In the case of the Ottoman empire a number of features prevent us from  describing it as a modern colonial empire, with a partial exception vis-à-vis  the Arab provinces for the last, post-Tanzimat, decades of the empire, when  the Balkans had already seceded.6 First, there was no abyss or institutional,  legal distinction between metropole and dependencies. Second, there was no  previous stable entity that colonized. The Ottoman empire became an elabo- rate state machine and an empire in the course of shaping itself as an expand- ing polity, which was a whole in all its territories. Third, there was no ame- lioration complex, no civilizing-mission obsession comparable to the French  or English colonial projects (again, with the exception of the Arab provinces  in the empire’s fi nal decades). Fourth, there was no hegemonic cultural resi- due from the Ottoman empire equivalent to the linguistic and general cul- tural hegemony of English in the Indian subcontinent and elsewhere or of  French in Africa and Indochina. These factors also apply as a whole to the  Habsburgs.7 While the imperial and colonial status of the Romanov empire is  not disputed, it comes with important qualifi cations.8 On the other hand, both  4.

Subjectivity matters, aft er all. None  of the contemporaries in the Balkans under Ottoman rule felt they were in a  colonial positionality. The only ones that insisted on their semicolonial status  were the modernizing elites of the empire itself, as voiced by some of its intel- lectuals at the time as well as during the period of republican Turkey. There- fore, until recently, postcolonial studies has not really made a methodological  inroad in the Balkans or in eastern Europe as a whole, in contrast to Immanuel  Wallerstein’s world-systems theory, immensely popular in Greece and Turkey  and widely studied in some east European countries even before 1989. Thus, from my perspective, with neither a colony nor a colonizer in the  nineteenth-century Balkans, the employment of the concept decolonization is  gratuitous. The point here is not for me to impose my interpretation of history  as “true.” Rather, my insistence is on a minimum level of professional rigor that  is necessary for scholarship to thrive and progress. There are consequences to  a careless attitude to concepts. Imprecision and lack of meticulousness make  the concepts unworkable; this leads to misidentifi cations, misconceptions,  and errors. It means essentially a breach of the conventions of the histori- cal profession which precludes the critical engagement with other scholars’  work and the serious debates that can lead to the advancement of scholarship.  Admittedly, this defi nitional rigidity can be broken in order to open up space  for innovation, for new theoretical or conceptual moves. We have numerous  examples in this respect, with the rethinking of the notions of class, gender,  race, the social, the everyday, and so on, which have launched new perspec- tives and lines of inquiry and have ultimately advanced knowledge. Breaking up defi nitional rigidity can also be motivated by considerations  outside the strict advancement of scholarship, but that can come with a cogni- tive or ethical price. Thus, some scholars, in particular cultural critics, have  broadened the defi nitions of the colonial and postcolonial for specifi c pur- poses, most oft en so that they hinge on a larger universal theory.10 Granted,  one can use decolonization as a metaphor and a synonym for the struggle  against subjugation and exploitation, but this leads us into a methodologi- 9.

Why specifi cally decolonization is used over a quantity  of other analogues has mostly to do with its metaphorical and emancipatory  power, evoking the saintly specters of Mohandas Gandhi and Frantz Fanon. The emancipatory mantle of decolonization all too oft en serves as a cover  for the perpetual lament of self-victimization. In his article “Scottish Nation- alism and the Colonial Vision of Scotland,” Liam Connell examines the use  of postcolonial theory in relation to Scotland and fi nds strong similarities be- tween the explanations off ered by early twentieth-century nationalists and  modern literary criticism, which reproduces essentialist models of nation- ality.11 One can hear the same congruent overtones between nationalism and  postcolonialism when it comes to bemoaning eastern Europe’s colonial status  vis-à-vis the Ottomans or the Soviets. Ironically, the same argument about co- loniality has been revived today in some quarters of eastern Europe regarding  the EU. In highlighting their new common experience of marginality, some  east European intellectuals call for opening up categories that were hitherto  used almost exclusively to conceptualize the non-European experience. In  this vision, a postcolonial framework serves largely emancipatory goals; it  empowers east European intellectuals by propelling them into a paradigm  that now pretends to be operating in a universal language. As long as there is an explicit awareness and recognition of this pretense  to universality, the use of postcolonial studies’ models can be a legitimate  move. As scholars, we are (or should be) aware of the instrumentalization and  politicization of concepts. This awareness is what I fi nd regrettably absent  in Snyder’s essay. And the absence of this awareness does not only involve  the notion of decolonization, which I have analyzed at some length. There is  also the cavalier attitude to the category revolution. Which criteria serve to  distinguish a “true” revolution from its opposite? There are overgeneralized  pronouncements like France being less developed than Bohemia in the 1930s,  fl ying in the face of conventions about comparative history. Why is the most  industrial region, fi rst of an empire and later of a nation-state, compared to a  whole nation-state, France? Why not comparable regions like Île-de-France or  Pays de la Loire? How is “development” conceptualized and measured? The  assertion that the heart of the German-Soviet war, which stood at the center of  World War II, was about control over Ukraine might also raise some eyebrows.  So would the claim about “a long moment in European and Atlantic history  in which a certain order was thought to be durable and sovereignty taken for  granted.” A long moment since when? 1992? 1999? What exactly is “postmod- ern” about Russia’s public relations campaign? Are we being off ered a new  understanding of postmodernity? What is a “normal setting” for historical  concepts? Who decides normality? There is also inconsistency in the use of  labels. Why was Scotland’s referendum a “separatist” one and not a “decolo- nization”? And why are states that assert their economic interests necessarily  Russian “client states”? It is disappointing that a historian who has done a lot  to deconstruct nationalism in his previous work should present a monolithic,  11.

Finally, maintaining that Russia found “limited social support and  few committed allies beyond criminals and local right-wingers and Nazis”  in Luhans ́ k and Donets ́ k mirrors the Kremlin’s propaganda. We have come  full circle to what Snyder himself warns against: “the alternative reality of  propaganda, whose tropes can otherwise serve as a tempting substitute for  thought.” I am not skirting the issue of Ukraine. Suffi  ce it to say that my own bi- ases are very diff erent from Snyder’s, but this does not make them identical to  the Kremlin’s. It is, however, unacceptable to reduce complicated issues to a  Manichean parable and to neglect arguments extended by the likes of Robert  Skidelsky, John Mearsheimer, Henry Kissinger, Mary Dejevski, and Stephen  Cohen, though—or precisely because—they are in the minority. This does a  disservice to the academic readership, to the role of the public intellectual,  and, ultimately, to the cause of Ukraine. </page> </plain_text>
