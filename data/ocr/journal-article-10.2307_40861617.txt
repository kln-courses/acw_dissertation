<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARTA IN THE 1990s: THE CHALLENGE CONTINUES ROBERT T. GOLEMBIEWSKI University of Georgia INTRODUCTION The Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) beginning in the mid-1970s hosted a systematic application of Organ- ization Development values-cum-technology, and this article consti- tutes another expression of the interest that continues a decade after the still-expanding rail/bus system first went operational.1 Specifical- ly, this article assesses the persistence of the early shaping of MARTA by OD values (Golembiewski, 1979, esp. Vol. 1). In focus- ing on persistence of OD effects, this piece joins a slim literature (e.g. y beginning with Seashore and Bowers, 1970), and especially as related to public-sector OD efforts (e.g., Harman, 1975; Bruce, 1992). Updating the MARTA experience-to see what has lasted and what has decayed-faces real limitations. Much time has passed between the last observations in 1982-83 and the causal chasm re- quires interpretive tentativeness. Moreover, time-pressures largely limit this update to interviews with MARTA executives which need reinforcing detail from all levels. Nevertheless, countervailing attrac- tions encourage seeing what can be usefully done. Part of the moti- vation is personal. This author devoted much time to the develop- ment of the early MARTA and had little knowledge of the last 5 years or so of its history, but had anticipated along with MARTA's General Manager that MARTA would experience major challenges as it moved beyond start-up (Golembiewski and Kiepper, 1983a, 1983b). Technically, moreover, we lack longitudinal perspective on all OD efforts and especially in the public sector. Four emphases detail this updating. In turn, attention gets direct- ed at: -MARTA's approach to using OD values and approaches to</page><page sequence="2">(752) FAQ SUMMER 1994 achieve its tough objectives; - A brief introduction to the literature describing and evaluating MARTA; - Some mid-1980s concerns about MARTA's post-start-up fu- ture; and - The major focus of attention: an overview of MARTA in the 1990s, relying on interviews and survey items with top execu- tives. "NOT JUST ANOTHER PUBLIC AGENCY" The aspiration reflected in the heading encapsulates the spirit of MARTA's founding leadership and legitimated doing new things in novel ways with OD being a primary vehicle. Conventionally, the initial approach was to focus on interaction- to build at start-up in MARTA a regenerative cultural context for individual and group relationships. "Regenerative" here refers to a combination of four variables: high levels of openness, owning, and trust, along with low levels of risk. "Degenerative" relationships often exist in organiza- tions and, while they often merely bedevil everyday management, they would herniate a project like MARTA. In OD parlance, regen- erative interaction "empowers" by directing timely attention to real problems that can be dealt with in terms of valid data, while not only building agreement about solutions but also contributing to psycho- logical success (Golembiewski, 1979, Vol. 1, esp. pp. 1-103). Conventionally, over time, increasing but incomplete attention was devoted to MARTA to developing structures as well as policies and procedures compatible with regenerative systems (Golembiew- ski, 1988:95-123). These would at once reinforce regenerative inter- action while being supported by it. The total sense of it is a self- heightening and self-reinforcing spiral of individual and collective competence (Golembiewski, 1971, Vol. 1). Some make strong normative arguments for the values underly- ing OD approaches and techniques (e.g., Sashkin, 1984) but, in far larger part, no alternative existed for MARTA. Details appear elsewhere (Golembiewski and Kiepper, 1988:203-205), but for present purposes a limited list of broadly-environmental constraints suffices to make the point. In outline, among other requirements and in rapid succession, MARTA had to - Assemble a top-level team and several levels of management-</page><page sequence="3">FAQ SUMMER 1994 (153) from scarce labor pools, from diverse sources, and via national searches, while reflecting an unprecedented commitment to affirmative action; "Do much on-the-job development and training since many recruits would lack experience in either urban transit or in big- project management or both; "Assimilate an existing bus property with its often-recalcitrant culture and views of urban transit; - Transition between several overlapping modes with little waste motion- from design of a bus/rail system through construction and then to operation; - Respect very tight time-frames: MARTA would complete in a decade a project estimated as requiring other local public agencies 3-5 times as long to complete; - Operate under the pressure that the project likely would never be completed unless both time and dollar targets were met; - Discipline itself to uncertain as well as limited local and federal funding; - Operate without the power to tax or of eminent domain which required building excellent working relationships with numer- ous state and local governments and agencies; and - Adjust to daunting local cross-currents involving race and class, which had complex social, political, and economic ramifica- tions. These determinants suggest that MARTA had much on its plate. Technically, the challenge inhered in MARTA being the largest regional public works project since TVA days which had to be de- signed and brought on-stream by an ad hoc organization built largely from scratch by cadres of managers and professionals often lacking urban transit experience. MARTA largely had to "grow its own," as it were, because urban transit had been in grievous national decline at least since World War II, and its managerial cadres had been aging and shrinking. At the same time, MARTA's political context was turbulent. For example, a new black political leadership was coming into power in Atlanta, while the burgeoning suburbs included in the Authority's mandate remained white and upper income. Both proponents and opponents alike saw MARTA as the vehicle for changing the latter's virtually-homogeneous complexion by increasing metropolitan mobility. MARTA had to balance diverse interests, then, while .pml</page><page sequence="4">(154) FAQ SUMMER 1994 developing an organization that soon approximated and then ex- ceeded a 50/50 distribution of black/white employees, including substantial representations of minorities and females at all levels-on the board, among executives and managers, and throughout MARTA. MARTA AS EXEMPLAR OF PUBLIC MANAGEMENT MARTA's successful start-up-especially in the context of its multiple challenges and the many predictions of an organizational pratfall-drew considerable attention. Two basic reasons undergird this interest: -MARTA deliberately set out to build its system in nontradi- tional ways-indeed, it could succeed only in such ways due to strict time and budget constraints, and -MARTA stands unique among large transit projects world- wide in meeting both time and dollar targets. Much of the attention to MARTA can be labeled "popular" or "political," and sees the Authority as an exemplar of a management approach that deserves to be influential in the public-sector's future. For example, numerous outlets expressed that theme-for general readers, public-interest target groups, and professional readers (e.g., Sweet, 1983:937-949). And representatives of several public agen- cies-and especially UMTA or the Urban Mass Transit Administra- tion which provided vital funding for MARTA- ail-but universally portrayed the new rail-bus system as "class transportation, not mass transportation." In academic circles, much of the interest in MARTA was gener- ated by "insiders"-both individuals and teams, eager and perhaps over-anxious to verbalize the good news and deeds. Several mile- stones distinguish this insider interest. The mid-1970s efforts at system-building were summarized for a specialized audience (Golembiewski and Kiepper, 1976); a set of 17 case studies appeared in the early 1980s;2 two major retrospective articles appeared follow- ing the early openings of parts of the rail system (Golembiewski, 1983a, 1983b); a synthesis reflecting on programs like MARTA's appeared in the mid-1980s (Golembiewski, 1985); and a summary book on MARTA was written by the Authority's first General Manager and his prime external consultant (Golembiewski and</page><page sequence="5">FAQ SUMMER 1994 (155) Kiepper, 1988). In addition, various "externals" have monitored this scholarly attention by those closely associated with MARTA. At times this critical focus has been on the OD approaches relied on in MARTA (e.g., Denhardt, 1984, esp. pp. 101-107). Among those scholars focus- ing on the MARTA system, most consistent and constructive has been Gabris who both early (1983) and later (1991) has focused on the MARTA literature. The recent reprinting of the initial 1976 article on the MARTA program inspired Gabris' most recent retro- spective analysis. CIRCA MID-1980S In the aftermath of decade-long efforts that met both time and dollar targets in bringing on-line the core of the bus/rail system, two close observers surveyed the effects. One (the author) had resigned from MARTA over a basic difference with the other (General Manager Kiepper) who himself would soon leave to direct a much larger urban transit system which the author would also serve in a consulting role. For compelling reasons in addition to scientific curiosity, then, both men sought to gain perspective from MARTA on how to do it better the next time (Golembiewski and Kiepper, 1983b), based on the experiences and reactions of MARTA execu- tives (Golembiewski and Kiepper, 1983a). Their shared concerns centered around whether the OD infra- structure built over the preceding decade would last. Both men were conscious that their growing concerns might be influenced by their respective detachments from MARTA-already definite in one case, and growing into a relocation in the other. The GM and consultant sought to avoid a sour-grapes orientation, but nonetheless worried that a different MARTA might emerge after only a small (if signifi- cant) part of the regional transportation problem had been ad- dressed. In 1982-83, the prospects that MARTA would survive much in the original mold seemed daunting as eight summary points suggest. In no particular order of relevance, but with cumulative impact, MARTA faced: 1. A sharp reduction in federal funding which would inhibit if not preclude planned extensions beyond the system's core facilities; 2. Limits on local funding from a sales tax and fare-box receipts; 3. A flattening-out of effort by employees after a very energetic</page><page sequence="6">(156) FAQ SUMMER 1994 great-leap-forward, a resting plateau, if you will; 4. Major personnel losses at the top two or three levels of management, who had gained high visibility in urban transit as a result of MARTA's successes, and were assiduously (and successful- ly, as it turned out) courted by other properties-Miami, Houston, Los Angeles, Denver, and so on; 5. Replacements of any managerial losses, which would probably be lower-profile appointees with system-maintaining tendencies, as contrasted with system-building proclivities; 6. A tendency toward a creeping bureaucratization as a result of the growing relevance of bus/rail operations along with a corre- sponding shift from an entrepreneurial mode to more micro- management: 7. The growing prominence of internal staff units-e.g., audit and personnel- whose roles had been variously constrained by the several pushes to "build the railroad." The new balance was seen as shifting toward greater procedural regularity and "going by the book," in part due to external pressures from professional standards or federal authorities and in part also due to internal pressures to fine-tune the distribution of power within MARTA; and 8. For various reasons, the MARTA Board which was seen as interested in "pulling-in-the-reins," especially in connection with the General Manager who had gained considerable lee-way in the rush toward milestones involved in building the core of the system. All in all, then, the 1982-83 probabilities implied a greater preci- sion in getting things done and a refocusing of energies toward micro-management as well as a likely lowering of intensity. There might be more regularity and predictability in a steady-state mode, in sum, and less of the ebullience if not feistiness and rambunctious- ness of start-up. Depending on where one sat, these tendencies were differently viewed. To some, they augured the threat of the very bureaucratiza- tion that the original MARTA sought to avoid. To others, the expec- tations suggested a welcome stage in MARTA's maturation. TENTATIVE REALITIES IN THE 1990s These tendencies seem variously overstated and underspecified, given a set of interviews held in May 1991. Overall, the subtitle of this article catches the sense of that update: The Challenge Remains. So reads a home-made hanging on the wall of one of MARTA's</page><page sequence="7">FAQ SUMMER 1994 (157) back-hall offices; and so the interviews suggest it is in the 1990s. Three emphases provide the detail about this conclusion and the search underlying it. In turn, attention gets directed at: the motiva- tion for a 1990-91 check on the earlier predictions; a sketch of the diagnostic approach; and a summary of the dominant realities of MARTA circa 1991. A Dual Serendipity Two factors combined to motivate an updated description of MARTA. Thus, as it were, demand grew. Moreover, this ex- consultant completed several major assignments elsewhere and his personal need surfaced to have another close look at the MARTA for which he had worked over most of its founding decade. More- over, an invitation to present a convention paper came at about the same time that the Organization Development Journal proposed reprinting the 1976 summary of the MARTA start-up, along with a critical reaction to it. In sum, the scheduling gods aided and abetted the author's felt-need. On the supply-side, MARTA officials proved responsive to a suggested update. In part, this recognized days past, and today's offi- cials not only warmly welcomed the return of the prodigal son but also extended numerous courtesies to him. In part, also, the internal wheels at MARTA also were turning: an internal strategic planning exercise had just begun and, as fate would have it, officials saw themselves approaching an important-even critical- choice-point about MARTA's future. An external view might contribute to MARTA's just-beginning evaluation of how the Authority would position itself to face its fast-approaching future. Diagnostic Approaches The basic vehicle for diagnosis involves structured interviews with the MARTA Senior Staff-encompassing the new General Manager and the Assistant GMs reporting to him. Twelve interviews were held-11 with members of the Senior Staff and the other with a just- resigned official having close ties to MARTA over nearly 20 years. The interviews were scheduled for 1.5 or 2 hours but they often extended far beyond that. Indeed, one lasted for 5 hours, including dinner. Rapport was often pre-built. Three of the interviewed officials</page><page sequence="8">(158) FAQ SUMMER 1994 had served as executives during the ex-consultant's tenure, with two having extensive earlier involvement with him, and a fourth 1991 executive was a former student. Three other 1991 executives had various vantage points on the interviewer as MARTA consultant. Beyond this, it appears that the consultant's credibility and motives were the topics of several internal conversations between new execu- tives and those with substantial tenure. The interviews were semi-structured, recorded for later tran- scription. The flow and format emphasized: - The ex-consultant's role as a "visiting fireman" working on a convention paper rather than as a representative of MARTA; - A gentle opener: a request for the several "best things" about today's MARTA management, as well as the "things most needing improvement"; - What defined "success" or "failure" in today's MARTA and especially as reflected in the organization's epic myths and in their underlying ideals or values; - Assessments of the degrees to which these ideals or values got approached in practice; - MARTA myths or legends about the "early days" and especially about the first General Manager; - Comparisons of today's MARTA with a 1976 PAR article describing the efforts to induce an intended infrastructure (the article had been supplied several weeks earlier to all those interviewed and had been read or reread by most of them in preparation for their interviews); and - Reflections on the 1991 MARTA as compared with the in- terviewee's earlier experiences in the Authority, which were extensive in the case of one recent hire. In addition, MARTA officials responded to some standard questionnaire items which included: 1) items from the Likert Profile of Organizational Characteristics, which had been applied to MARTA several times over the interval 1975-82, and 2) items esti- mating the degree to which the present MARTA system was regen- erative or degenerative-high vs. low on owning, openness, risk, and trust. Various other inputs added to this data-base. Some officials volunteered written materials, for example, and the ex-consultant's meanderings through the corridors of MARTA's headquarters</page><page sequence="9">FAQ SUMMER 1994 (159) occasioned unexpected opportunities to cross-check reactions with old acquaintances or with those whose only contact with the days of the "long march" were through the 1975-82 grapevine or through the surviving reconstructions of that earlier time. Eight such meetings occurred-most accidental but a few fortuitous-on-purpose by those eager that a rounded view emerge. The expectations were not that these several sources would provide rigorous pre- vs. post-comparisons. Rather, the various cross-checkings would permit a relatively-informed, qualitative view of MARTA in the early 1990s-a kind of rough map of a complex territory. If tentative, the search might provide perspective on MARTA's trajectory between then and now, and (if more problem- atically) between now and the future. Some Dominant Realities Nine perspectives summarize the major features of the data- gathering. In general, they indicate that the 1982-83 expectations and probabilities are either inaccurate or lack specificity, on balance. 1. Funds Became Available. Perhaps paramountly, the expected closing of the financial spigot did not occur. That probability had been a major factor in the 1983 fear that MARTA would become a low-energy system. After an extended period of indeterminacy, substantial new funding made it possible for MARTA to undertake planned extensions of the core system and this work was ending around the time of the 1991 interviews. In fact, over the past eight years, MARTA received 21 percent of all federal funds available nationally for rail start-up. One cannot say unequivocally that the original MARTA infra- structure permitted taking optimal advantage of these new funding opportunities, but it clearly did not hurt. At the very least, MARTA's reputation for success was a large factor. 2. A New GM Takes Hold. Ken Gregor, who replaced MARTA's original GM Alan Kiepper, plays a major role in the inapplicability of the 1982-83 predictions. This conclusion rests on two sets of evidence. At the level of expectations, the early 1980s betting was that few influentials wanted a heroic, high-profile replacement for Kiepper. He was widely seen as holding MARTA together, often by the force of his will, but wide agreement also existed that the continuing costs of such a GM were too high. Hence, the common views that</page><page sequence="10">(160) FAQ SUMMER 1994 MARTA leadership and operations would take on more convention- al features. Consistently, Gregor- one of Kiepper's long-time assist- ants-announced his unwillingness to take on the GM role in his predecessor's hard-driving role. Once appointed, Gregor quickly grew into the GM's job in ways that reinforce MARTA's singularities and its OD infrastructure. Here it is possible to illustrate only some senses of the present point. Illustratively. Gregor has - A very strong "sense of team" which continues the early MARTA emphasis but without the cross-currents characteristic of earlier experience (Golembiewski and Kiepper, 1988:201- 315); - A personal style congenial to OD values: confrontive, less constrained by fear of failure than attracted to the payoffs of reasonable risks prudently taken, and so on (Ibid., 204-205, 211- 212); - Preserved the sense of a diverse but unified workforce: at last count, MARTA employees were 60 percent black and minori- ties; - A strong credit-sharing orientation along with a substantial capacity to "take the heat" generated by MARTA decisions, whether his own or those of subordinates operating under the broad delegations Gregor favors; - Blended strong emphases on "efficiency with economy" while earlier criticism often emphasized MARTA's propensity toward expensive analyses and studies as well as high-salaried executives; - A strong sense of the need to keep employees at all levels alive and committed as by encouraging delegation, discretion, and cross-training or job-switches to keep them from becoming "zombies" who have died at their work; - Kept alive the sense and reality of MARTA as a special kind of public agency with active, involved, and committed employees; - Maintained motivation while also holding rein on executive salaries as by internal promotions versus national searches, calculated risks in promotions, and successful reliance on developmental or cross-training opportunities, but perhaps especially by giving his AGMs substantial room for initiative and control; and - Dealt constructively with serious financial problems facing</page><page sequence="11">FAQ SUMMER 1994 (161) MARTA in the mid-1980s. Consider some details related especially to the last emphasis but relevant to all of them. Gregor was a "financial man" and the mid- 1980s MARTA required precisely this focus. In contrast, Kiepper focused on "building the railroad" with flush budgets and with a primary view to system effectiveness. Illustratively, given a different day-and-time, MARTA wage increases averaged 11.5 percent per year during 1972-81 but only 2.9 percent per year since 1982. Gre- gor's approach reveals the man's style. "The cupboard is empty," he later paraphrased his approach. "Folks, you've got to lower your expectations." (See also the later analysis of Likert Profile data.) 3. As the Twig was Bent? Several developments in the 1991 MARTA are consistent with the original OD initiatives, and these developments deserve illustration even though their roots must remain speculative. Hence the interrogative heading, despite the fact that interviews typically reflected definite trails of associations between then and now. Broadly, the pulse of life at MARTA seems to be moderated, but the essential high-energy character seems to remain. As one Assist- ant General Manager puts it: AGM: Well, one of the characteristics that I describe to people when I interview them for management jobs here is the dynamic pace of the organization. That was characteristic of it in the begin- ning years, and that is very much the style today. For a government bureaucracy, in many ways it operates on a day-to-day basis like a private organization. Interviewer: The early motto, you may remember, was "Not Just Another Public Agency." AGM: Many of us remember; and MARTA certainly isn't, in my opinion. In large part this pace reflects that MARTA is seen as a "mixed" organization. It is clearly public, but it also has flexibility as an Authority, faces substantial time-pressures, and sees a need to be client-oriented in a way that many organizations in the public sector are not, or do not care to be. Relatedly, the MARTA system circa 1991 shows major signs of the organizational flexibility that was the prime goal of the original MARTA. The internal political forcefield is shifting in significant ways- roughly, development has a lessening role as major construc- tion is moving toward completion while operations and audit assume</page><page sequence="12">(162) FAQ SUMMER 1994 growing significance. These changes were expected in the mid-1980s but their full impact was delayed by new funding. Significantly, these critical adjustments seem accepted as new environmental determinants to be dealt with cooperatively, on clear balance, rather than as motivators of conflict. Relatedly, various bus/rail activities have been shifted in ways that could have caused jurisdictional issues. In fact, today's executives speak of the "spirit of a matrix without its form." This flexibility may be severely challenged if MARTA seeks to expand its mandate. For example, one executive speaks of the "need for salespersons in MARTA over the next few years, just like the old days." The reference is to the entrepreneurial spirit characteristic of the original MARTA officialdom, both before the passage of the referendum authorizing the MARTA system and in the several years before the bus/rail system was in operation. (See also Dominant Reality #9 below.) Perhaps the clearest suggestion of past - &gt; present associations relates to the emphasis on the "team." This reflects the style of GM Gregor, but also has antecedents going back to the original organiza- tion-building exercises. As one GM notes: "Ken's style fosters teamwork. He insists on people being collaborative and understand- ing each other's point of view. His ego isn't large, and he doesn't like people to be mad at each other and to be destructive in the organiza- tion." Moreover, due to both socialization and perhaps especially selection, the present Senior Staffers have a "close fit" that reflects and reinforces Gregor's style. One AGM echoes the sentiments of virtually all colleagues in this exchange: AGM: We don't have the personalities that we once did. One for one as you meet these folks that you haven't met, you will find them trustworthy. They do have the best interests of the organization at heart. They in the long run want to work collaboratively for decisions that are good for MARTA. I don't know of any one of us that I could say doesn't fit that pattern. Interviewer: Of course, the critic would say, "Well, that's often true of organizations after the great leap forward." In the next stage, people emphasize managing the system, lubricating the system a bit. AGM: Yeah, we have a lot of people like that-practically the whole Senior Staff. The personality of the management group now is more in tune with, and more appropriate for, the maintenance of the organization. You know, rather than the first stages, which featured more in-fighting and stumbling toward the MARTA model that we</page><page sequence="13">FAQ SUMMER 1994 (163) now have pretty well-in-hand. Also noteworthy is an ongoing in-house planning initiative which implies an effort to tighten-up procedures, policies, and structures as a prelude to a possible later shift in mission-and-roles. Consistent with the OD efforts in the early MARTA to include all levels, includ- ing the Board (Golembiewski and Kiepper, 1976), this effort empha- sizes broad involvement, including that of union members at opera- tional levels. It is too early to estimate the effect of this exercise which may well be a precursor for a broader strategic planning initi- ative involving powerful external stakeholders. (See also point #9 below.) Several other MARTA activities also reflect the ongoing concern to avoid becoming "just another public agency." They can be noted briefly, with sparse explanatory comments: - The Board of Ethics continues, and robustly from all indica- tions, reflecting MARTA's thrust toward an open system- in this case, by aggressively evaluating the performance of its employees, exploring conflict of interest, and so on. - Various, efforts to continue to play a leading-edge role among regional agencies, which include initiatives related to customer- oriented behavior and attitudes at all MARTA levels as well as to quality assurance, building on earlier efforts (e.g., Bates, 1981). - A performance appraisal system linked to rewards for excep- tional contributions of as much as 7 percent per year. 4. The New Cadre: As expected, major personnel changes oc- curred at executive and managerial levels, as other organizations oriented their recruiting to MARTA's success. Compared to their predecessors, the new executives are more likely to be younger, female, and internal promotions. Specifically, only four executive holdovers from the mid-1980s were interviewed, and one of those had already shifted to a major role in Atlanta's Olympic Games. However, the dire consequences considered probable have not occurred. These include concerns that efficiency and effectiveness would suffer, any hard-won chemistry would be diluted, tendencies toward bureaucratization would be heightened, and energy levels would plummet. In fact, the dominant characterization of the 1990s MARTA executives seems a prevailing commitment to the "team" mode which</page><page sequence="14">(164) FAQ SUMMER 1994 contrasts with the rambunctiousness of earlier executives which so complicated early efforts toward a cohesive Senior Staff. Several interviews revealed real potential for divisiveness, but Senior Staff still seem willing to work with personal and organizational differ- ences because the present balance is acceptable, even desirable, under Gregor's evenhandedness. In some settings, the verbiage about "team" is window-dressing that merely submerges the expres- sion of real differences or that puts a collaborative face on a charge- of-the-light-brigade mentality. Neither case seems to apply to MARTA and certainly not in undiluted forms. As one executive notes of the present Senior Staff, in special connection with the emphasis on internal promotion: "I don't think that it's incestuous, but I do think there is a lot of compatibility between some of the older heads and some of the newer heads." This basic orientation no doubt has numerous explanations. Most obviously the system has taken essential shape which reduces the opportunities (or need) for sharp differences; the early MARTA executives also included several overt contenders for the general managership-which regenerative interaction encouraged- while neither the interviewees nor the author see a challemger in the present cadre; and so on. More subtle issues are also probably at work. The national searches in the earlier MARTA generated candidates who were more likely to be prominents with strong personal agendas whom- due to scarcity- MARTA was glad to have- even if fit was incom- plete or in question. Indeed, a major motivation of the MARTA OD efforts was to manage, or even transform, precisely such lack of personal congruence and to do so in tight time-frames. Willingness to be a team player gets more attention nowadays as the price of admission. Thus, one executive notes of himself that he finds MARTA congenial, but due to a prior fit rather than to socialization by the MARTA approach. His approach was "something I brought with me, always my style." The emphasis on internal promotions clearly also would inform judgments about prior-fit. Although there seem to be no major untoward consequences of this staffing pattern, a major test seems on the horizon. The ongoing strategic planning effort must constitute a major challenge for the present Senior Staff and a possible cutback due to a recent drop-off in sales tax revenues may also have divisive effects, Union contracts will also be renegotiated at 1991s end. 5. The "Older Heads": A substantial stability has characterized</page><page sequence="15">FAQ SUMMER 1994 (165) MARTA at many levels despite the expected flurry of losses around 1980-83. Gregor with 10 years of tenure as GM is now national dean in point of continuous service with a single property, and has been at MARTA for 19 years as a Senior Staffer. (GM tenure is 3-5 years, industry-wide.) Until quite recently, two others of similar tenure were Gregor's colleagues. Many others at lower levels have also "been around" but without "going stale." In part, this reflects the rapid transitioning that charac- terized much of the MARTA history. As one executive notes, "Probably for 10 to 15 years I felt that we never did anything twice." In addition, departures from the original MARTA senior cadre opened up developmental positions for those who were promoted early and stayed on. The result? One executive observed about the professional staff: You know, when we first started building the system, we had a lot of new people, a lot of new learning processes, a lot of mistakes that were made that had to be corrected, and so on. And we now have a seasoned group of engineers that are doing a crackerjack job. Note that MARTA turnover falls in the 6-7 percent range, which suggests the major attractions of employment in the Authority. This particular coin has another side. Consider this exchange concerning an AGM's comments about "things slowing down a bit, and bureaucracy ... getting worse": Interviewer: I have no way to make a firm judgment, but my sense is that most of your colleagues still think that MARTA's a pretty good public agency. A cut over- AGM: Yeah, definitely, definitely. It has retained its reputation. Very professional and on the cutting edge in transit, but- Interviewer: Reputation or realty? I am trying to smoke you out there. The "but" suggests you see some slippage from higher ground AGM: Oh, I do, I definitely do. I think we've been resting a little bit too much on our laurels. Another Senior Staffer sees it similarly, but with a bit of a twist appropriate to that AGM's turf. "Our ship is just a little more laid- back than when I first came on board." The AGM adds: "We are trying to energize it in the last year or so." It may be a matter of where one sits, in fact. As another AGM notes: Even though there are bureaucratic aspects of MARTA that have</page><page sequence="16">(166) PAQ SUMMER 1994 become necessary because we need good internal controls and to protect ourselves against audits in buying and contracting, I don't believe that we have become a large murky bureaucracy. You can still get things done ... There is a lot of delegation downward. I believe that there is a good level of authority at the manager level. And you know, MARTA's a very dynamic, fast-paced organization. That has never changed ... 6. Shared Aversion to "Bureaucracy." A dominant agreement among Senior Staffers concerns a desire- in several cases, a passion- to preserve the flexibility and managerial lightfootedness they associate with the early MARTA. GM Gregor possibly leads the charge in this matter, arguing with passion against "no-brainers" and "organizational zombies" who lack discretion and initiative. Opinions differ about what constitutes appropriate discretion, but all see MARTA's practices as providing unusual leeway. The anti-bureaucracy theme was dominant in the early OD ef- forts and, with some qualifications, that survives. Thus, some MARTA executives see a drift toward bureaucracy as inevitably growing, but as a force to be resisted so as to delay and dilute its impact. Others take a variety of positions, as exemplified by this differentiated view of one AGM: AGM: Yeah, it makes it more difficult to get things done. We are entrenched in reams and reams of administrative procedures. So we've become insecure-probably defensive to some extent-in what we do and how we go about doing things. Things are more regi- mented now. Interviewer: There's some good news and some bad news in that-right? So things have maybe slowed down a little bit- AGM: Exactly, exactly- Interviewer: -so they're easier to keep on top of now. On the other hand, they're more of a pain in the rear. AGM: Yeah. Interviewer: Which would you rather have? AGM: Oh, I guess the way it's going now is probably the best way. Yeah. From my personal perspective, I guess that it is. But for a young person coming into the organization- a new employee who wants to achieve, a high achiever-it must be terribly frustrating for him 7. A Helpful Board. All executives emphasize good relationships with the MARTA Board of Directors who are appointed by the City of Atlanta and several counties. Indeed, many executives note that</page><page sequence="17">FAQ SUMMER 1994 (167) Board relationships are the most attractive system feature, despite occasional public flare-ups. It was not always thus and major OD efforts sought a more satis- fying balance. The 1970-1980 tensions of moving toward an operat- ing bus/rail system often were intense and Board vigilance-and on occasion, vengeance- had many motivators. This understandable situation was exacerbated by the fact that some Board members came from counties that did not earmark sales tax receipts for MARTA but whose residents could free-ride on the system- as in driving their personal cars to MARTA park-and-ride facilities and then using the system. Hence consultant Golembiewski worked di- rectly with the Board and especially its chairman for several years on projects including reorganization and performance appraisal of the GM. Explanations for the present situation include success in changing the early unfavorable relationships and MARTA's reputation for managerial competence, but also extend beyond such factors. Thus MARTA has been fortunate in Board appointments, in general, who often have a policy vs. operational orientation. Others emphasize that no one wants to "muss the feathers of a truly-golden goose, let alone harm that goose." And most of the construction contracts, as well as the local enhancements associated with them, are past histo- ry. A major test of these Board/staff relationships may be in the future. MARTA may have to undergo a cutback due to falling sales tax revenues and this might encourage Board interest in many oper- ating details. Generally, GM Gregor has been successful in maintain- ing the view that staff responsibility implies substantial operational discretion within policy guidelines. 8. Gentle Perspective by the Numbers. The interviews also generated two quantitative estimates of the state of relationships in MARTA of 1991. These estimates help locate where MARTA is and, if with a real tentativeness, permit some gentle comparisons with where MARTA was. PROFILE OF ORGANIZATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS The earlier MARTA had made now-and-again use of Likert's (1967) instrument which, in its several forms, has several useful features. First, its several items are scored along a continuum of 20 equal-appearing intervals differentiated into four major systems of</page><page sequence="18">(168) FAQ SUMMER 1994 management: SCORES SYSTEM DESCRIPTIONS (1-5) System I Exploitive-Authoritative (6-10) System II Benevolent-Authoritative (11-15) System III Consultative (16-20) System IV Participative Group Second, each item is anchored by four brief descriptive state- ments, one statement for each system. Consider the item: At what level are decisions made? The four Likert systems are anchored by these descriptions, respectively: I. mostly at top; II. policy at top, some delegation; III, broad policy at top, more delegation; IV. throughout [the organization] but well integrated. Third, each item is scored twice. A Now score reflects an esti- mate of the existing condition and an Ideal score reflects a respond- ent's preference for what should exist. Efforts were made to avoid contamination of Ideal and Now in executive's responses. Thus respondents provided Ideal scores early in their interviews after the Profile approach was explained. Now scores were solicited much later in the interview, typically after a minimum of 30-45 minutes of discussion. If anything, the intervening questioning may have deflated Now scores. The 12 interviewees responded to five Likert items tapping four domains: Decisions, Goals, Control, and Motivation. Their Ideal scores average in the 13-15 range, which is to say mid- to upper- levels on System III. The Now scores have means of 9, plus or minus a tad, which is just within the upper boundary of System II. Although the point could be extended too far, some comparisons with earlier Likert scores could be suggestive. Briefly, several earlier distribu- tions of Likert scores can be characterized in these terms: - Ideal scores averaged at mid-levels of System IV and above - Now scores, before OD interventions, averaged in the 8-ΜΓ range - Now scores, after OD interventions, averaged well into System III or low System IV. Two tendencies seem apparent. The aspirations of today's MARTA executives reflected in Ideal scores are substantially more</page><page sequence="19">PAQ SUMMER 1994 (169) constrained than those of their predecessors of 10-15 years earlier. Moreover, Now scores seem clearly lower. No statistical tests were performed due to small group size. The profile scores in MARTA circa 1991 also reflect a very wide dispersion of scores which, in general, coincide with the tenures of Senior Staff. The longer the tenure, the higher are both Ideal and Now scores. It is worthy to note that 7 of the 12 interviewees in various ways drew attention to this difference between the "old guys" and the newer additions to the Senior Staff. About half of the execu- tives are newer appointees. Regenerative Interaction Interviewees were also asked to rate MARTA along the four dimensions thought to characterize individual and group relation- ships-openness, owning, risk, and trust as estimated along a 5-point scale anchored by High, Medium, and Low. Mean scores cluster around 3.2-3.5 which are substantially beyond the mid-point but certainly do not imply the "high" scores consistent with OD values and approaches. No direct comparisons with MARTA executives of 1975-85 can be made, however. The individual scores again reflect a dispersion associated with differences in tenure. MARTA is more regenerative for the longer- tenured Senior Staff. 9. An Apparently-Emerging Imperative. With the qualifications appropriate to all dynamic situations, MARTA in 1991 may well stand in deep need of the kind of culture and relationships built a decade earlier. Directly, the Authority faces a choice-point that will shape its future. In this author's terms, Choice I sees MARTA struggling to stay even-as a metropolitan transit authority serving (as it now does) Atlanta plus several of the metro counties. Choice II sees MARTA as enlarging its service area into the 8-county metro- politan area or even beyond. Directly, whatever the key choice, MARTA requires base- expansion which can occur in two ways. Modestly, MARTA can strive to increase ridership through such devices as encouraging businesses and governments within its present service boundaries to subsidize employee travel much as they subsidize parking for per- sonal cars. This strategy is inherently limited although it could help. MARTA's downtown Atlanta base is already degrading as business- es (and hence potential passengers) move outside the fixed reach of</page><page sequence="20">(170) FAQ SUMMER 1994 the core rail system. More aggressively, MARTA can seek extensions of its present system into the fast-growing suburbs. The market for mass transit burgeons with the metro area having grown by about 30 percent during 1980-89. Indeed, the fastest-growing U.S. county, Gwinnett, recently held a referendum about entering into a contract with MARTA. The referendum did not carry but it may be a harbinger of future extensions. MARTA officials, at Gwinnett's request, did not play an active role in the referendum. More expansively still, MARTA could seek authority to build new rail linkages into a re- gional network. These variants on base-expansion all imply political issues-in the less-expansive variants, local governments might resist, and in the most expansive variant, opposition from Georgia DOT seems probable, if not inevitable, and the support of its historic local stake- holders is often decisive. Not being "just another agency" can be a very useful reputation to maintain, whatever the base-expansion strategy. In an Armageddon view of the supporters, for example, MARTA would be folded into a state agency-most likely, Georgia DOT. The state presently has no coherent transportation policy with DOT remaining largely a de- partment of highways. However, Georgia's new governor seems to be seeking to redirect the DOT mission into transportation as broad- ly conceived. A successful June 1991 initiative by several major Georgia executive and legislative figures induced the retirement of the DOT head and arranged for his replacement by a more political- ly-responsive appointee without department roots. Atlanta officials would resist even well-connected covetousness directed at MARTA, but a reputation for efficiency as well as effectiveness would be a valuable adjunct to this built-in political support. Not coincidentally at all, funding for mass urban transit seems to have a suddenly-high priority in congressional circles. Funds to fuel an expansion of base apparently will be available in recently-unprec- edented volume. If this occurs, it will add zestful urgency to how and when MARTA decides to resolve its present choice-point. CONCLUSION Four major points fairly characterize this update, given its limita- tions. First, much of the policies and practices in the 1991 MARTA seems to this observer to have deep roots and suggests noteworthy</page><page sequence="21">FAQ SUMMER 1994 (171) persistence of early efforts in an OD mode, despite major Senior Staff turnover. Second, various serendipitous features also contributed to the present sense of "MARTA." The unexpected availability of federal funding clearly was of major moment, for example, as was the growing-into office of the present General Manager. Along with other factors, they served to blunt any major tendencies toward the dour 1982-83 probabilities. So one might argue that OD values and approaches were not subjected to a maximum test. Granted. But the last decade or so has contained a goodly share of difficulties and MARTA's systemic development has continued. Third, the quantitative data-given their clear limits-require major caveats about proposing that OD values have largely persisted in MARTA. To some, indeed, major tensions or even contradictions may seem to exist between the Profile data and much of the qualita- tive information reviewed above. For example, assume that MARTA's Board turns combative or even hostile in the face of state financial difficulties. The moderate scores on the Likert Profile and on the four components of regenerative interaction might then prove insufficient to inhibit a win-lose mentality from dominating, employ- ee discontent might flourish, General Manager Gregor might sub- stantially centralize and shorten the leashes on the other executives, and so on and on. This author's view has longer and short-term components. These estimates attempt to take into account his personal inclinations or biases. He does not see himself as emotionally tethered to MARTA, having resigned about a decade ago. Moreover, along with General Manager Kiepper, he foresaw in 1982-83 great difficulties for MARTA beyond start-up. So history seems a wash to him in this particular. As for now, MARTA remains a qualitatively-different experience for most others as well as for this author. So as meaningful as the clear downward drift in "the numbers" is, the dominating compari- son is that between today's MARTA and other public agencies, especially those in its niche nationwide and in its locality. As this author sees it, the advantage still remains with MARTA. As MARTA moves more explicitly into rounds of strategic plan- ning with multiple stakeholders about its future, and especially in an attempt at expansive base-building, appropriate concerns escalate. For example, this author reported to MARTA officialdom that reinforcement experiences for OD values seem strongly indicated, at</page><page sequence="22">(172) FAQ SUMMER 1994 a minimum. As the pressures mount in connection with several choice-points now facing the Authority, as they very likely will, the significance of underlying interpersonal and group relationships will be heightened. The numbers here suggest that real deterioration has occurred in both the Now and Ideal aspects of these relationships and this may negatively impact what gets done and especially how, particularly when it comes to aggressive choices about MARTA's near-future. An organization that "wants more" reasonably has to "give more." In general, such estimates of the health of underlying processes like those assessed here are leading indicators of commu- nication and decision-making difficulties. However, qualitative data suggest no clear and major eruptions of such difficulties as of October 1991. Fourth, MARTA now seems poised for what in OD jargon is referred to as a "new orbit," a "vision of discovery" (in Neely Gard- ner's words) or an "action research sequence." The full process will encompass a strategic plan built around what MARTA will aspire to become as the future unfolds. Basically, the earlier MARTA was more focused on relatively "internal" development, with the quotation marks referring not only to intra-Authority issues but also to the local policy environment as well as to limited state and federal stakeholders. In the immediate future, it appears, MARTA faces a basic choice. MARTA can remain in its historic frame and face a future of stability, at best, or more probably a continuing decline in its passen- ger-base with significant effects on Authority morale and aspirations. Or MARTA can choose various frame-breaking orientations to the future: to add to the passenger-base by expansion beyond its limited historic bases, and/or to add to its product-line beyond rail and bus services as by moving into other transportation modes or by various development activities along its present bus and rail corridors or at station sites. The point can be overdone, but the temptation is great to think of the choice-point in anthropomorphic maturational terms. Like people as they strive to "grow-up," MARTA faces the choice of standing-pat or development, of continuing to focus on a sense of the historic self or of refocusing in search of a broader sense of self (e.g., Hampden-Turner, 1966). The latter implies a risk and requires courage, of course, but it also represents the only alternative to decline and senescence. This "looking outward more and inward less," in Neely Gardner's words, characterizes a new "voyage of .pml</page><page sequence="23">FAQ SUMMER 1994 (173) discovery." It is premature to judge whether and how frame-breaking will occur, but two points seem clear enough. Thus, OD values and approaches imply an organic view of organizations and hence are tailor-made for the strategic planning that MARTA faces. The conceptual rationale has been developed in great detail (e.g., Jellinek and Literer, 1988) and operating models also exist (e.g., Golembiew- ski, Nethery, Shepherd, and Hilles, 1992). OD's relevance will cer- tainly be high if MARTA adopts a frame-breaking orientation. In different senses, the conclusion will also hold if the historic mission is maintained. For this choice would imply to many an acceptance of genteel decline, if not an abject failure to attempt to extend the MARTA model to service obvious state and regional needs. Will MARTA's cadre opt for an attempted steady-as-it-goes? No one knows. That may be the most attainable under then-prevailing political and economic conditions. Or, paradoxically, most MARTA employees could be so satisfied with their quality of worklife that they might resist any change, despite the probably-somber conse- quences of this choice. This raises the probability of the "failure of success," especially as MARTA's workforce ages as a dual result of low turnover and (at best) stable employment. Clearly, any MARTA frame-breaking will imply the test of the degree of persistence of OD values developed in the earlier MARTA, as well as of the degree to which they can be built upon. This highlights the significance of the apparent decreases in quanti- tative measures reviewed above. The existing levels may well be appropriate for the MARTA of today; these levels may also suffice if MARTA adopts a stand-pat posture for the future. But real con- cerns are appropriate about their appropriateness for frame- breaking in MARTA. This last condition will stress relationships between individuals and groups, probably severely, and no doubt would heighten the need for regenerative interaction. The apparently-contradictory alternatives would be high levels of conflict or low energy levels associated not only with low conflict but also with low aspirations. NOTES 1.
