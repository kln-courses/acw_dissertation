<plain_text><page sequence="1">Transdimensional relations: on human-spirit interaction in the Amazon DAN ROSENGREN Gothenburg University Animism has been a topic of interest for some time, and several innovative approaches challenging earlier conventional perspectives have been presented. Inspired by the recent thinking on this classical anthropological subject, this article explores conceptualizations of the human-spirit, or transdimensional, relationship central to any theory on animism. Drawing on fieldwork among the Matsigenka of the tropical lowlands of southeastern Peru, conceptions of and motivations for the interaction with spirits are examined. For a society that places high moral value on equality and conviviality, the emphasis on discrimination and hierarchical relations that is prominent in many studies is inappropriate. As an alternative more congenial to the Matsigenka ethos, the article stresses the convivial qualities of sharing and mutual trust. Both these virtues play down the importance of hierarchy and discrimination allowing us to understand what motivates the Matsigenka to enter into an often arduous and demanding relationship with spirits. Even though animism has been an object of anthropological study for more than a century, Philippe Descola (1992: 115) noted hardly more than a decade ago that animis- tic (or 'animic' as he prefers) systems were still badly known. Since then animism has been approached along new and provocative lines of thought. To Descola's own analy- ses of modes of relationship between humans and non-humans (e.g. 1992; 1996) have been added a number of studies from various perspectives (Arhem 1990; 1996a; 2001; Bird-David 1990; 1992; 1999; Stringer 1999; Viveiros de Castro 1992; 1998; 2004). In this rethinking of animism the theoretical focus has generally been on the interrelationship between humans and nature from the point of departure of what could be described as a 'holistic environmentalism' (Croll &amp; Parkin 1992: 34). In accordance, Viveiros de Castro's (1998) article on Amazonian perspectivism has been of importance for the recent reappraisal of animism. In this article he argues that various forms of beings share human subjectivity, producing a fundamental conformity that surpasses the significance of (ephemeral) physical differences. Although the new approaches to animism break with formerly conventional per- spectives, the relationship between humans and others, irrespective of whether they are natural or supernatural, is still largely seen from a dualistic point of view stressing difference and detachment. Focus is generally on how relations with the supernatural Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 12, 803-816 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="2">804 DAN ROSENGREN dimensions affect conditions in the sensate, or human, world. Associated with the argument are notions of 'familiarization,' 'other-making', and predation (Fausto 1999; Vilaga 2002; Viveiros de Castro 1992) and shamans taking a central position on the animistic stage. Shamanism is, accordingly, intimately connected to animistic world- views and Viveiros de Castro defines it as 'the capacity evinced by some individuals to cross ontological boundaries deliberately and adopt the perspective of nonhuman subjectivities in order to administer the relations between humans and nonhumans' (2004: 468). The mediation between that dimension of the world which can be immediately experienced by humans and those dimensions that are concealed to our ordinary senses is, thus, highly significant to people who confess to an animistic worldview. The importance given to the maintenance of relations with superhuman powers is indi- cated, for instance, by the common existence of a number of shamans in each local community. There are, moreover, a number of communities where the majority, at least of the men, maintain some contact with spirit beings. This condition suggests that shamanism in these cases cannot be reduced to the administration of 'transspecific' relations suggested in Viveiros de Castro's definition. Moreover, the assumed salience of calculated exchanges that seems to be inherent in this and other views on human-spirit, or transdimensional, relations also appears dubious. The insights gained from recon- sidering transdimensional relations suggest that there may also be other reasons than the administration of exchange relations that motivate people to set out on the often- times arduous and dangerous career as shaman. An examination of the nature and articulation of transdimensional relations is, thus, likely to produce insights not only into esoteric aspects of the human condition but also into conceptions of sociality. Presently I therefore ignore the question of the spirit beings' ontological nature in order to explore how indigenous Amazonians conceive of their interaction with this category of beings. On a more general level the query also addresses assumptions of hierarchy, separation, and predation as essential elements of animistic worldviews that often are taken for granted and as common among Amazonian societies. Perspectives on Amazonian human-spirit relations In his essay on animistic systems, Descola (1992) principally discusses the two anti- thetical Tukanoan and Jivaroan schemes, according to which the former stresses bal- anced reciprocity while the latter is based on negative reciprocity, which in this context signifies predation. Briefly Descola also mentions a third, Arawakan, scheme, which he describes (1992: 121) as based on a dualist principle separating the various beings who inhabit the cosmos into two distinct ontological domains which are posed against each other in a constant Manichean struggle between good and evil.' Relations within the two domains are, in contrast, not antagonistic. Accordingly, in the three animistic models that Descola discusses, a separation of humans and spirits constitutes a central trait. Amazon studies generally portray the indigenous peoples of the region as influenced by an egalitarian ethos which often is articulated in forms of reciprocity. At the same time, however, studies of transdimensional relations commonly underscore hierar- chical asymmetries associated with significant differences in the constitution of the various beings concerned. The crucial difference that distinguishes humans from superhumans consists in the powers that spirits possess and that humans covet. In the Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 12, 803-816 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="3">DAN ROSENGREN 805 ethnography of the Amazon, two modes of human-spirit relations prevail: either humans are seen as generally dominant using spirits and their powers to promote their own interests (e.g. W. Crocker &amp; J. Crocker 1994; Fausto 1999; M6traux 1941; Roe 1982), or, conversely, humans are depicted as subordinate with significant spirits requiring propitiations and offerings to be persuaded to act favourably and to fulfil their suppli- cations (e.g. Gregor 1977; Reichel-Dolmatoff 1997; Wright 1998). This asymmetry is oftentimes associated with antagonistic relations which lead to a comparison between shamans and warriors (e.g. Fausto 1999; Viveiros de Castro 2004). The modality according to which relations between humans and supernatural powers are conceived clearly generates different foci of the ethnographical descrip- tions of shamanism. In accounts where humans are conceived of as superior to spirits, the focus is commonly on the shamans' relations to other people rather than on human-spirit relations. Accordingly, when Michael Harner (1972) discusses Shuar shamanism, spirits are described as servants of the shamans, who employ them stra- tegically to promote their own social position, principally in competition with other shamans. Other prominent themes relate to curing, subsistence, and social control. The subordination of spirits signifies that these, at times, appear as 'extensions' of the shamans, who may even internalize the supernatural powers physically. Such inter- nalization is achieved either by sharing the same substances, as among the Wari (Conklin 2001) and the Culina (Pollock 1992), or by having the powers reside within the shamans' bodies,2 as among the Yanoama (Chagnon 1968; Taylor 1979) and Yagua (Chaumeil 1998), or by temporarily possessing spirits during seances, which, for example, set the powerful yakapa shamans off from other kinds of shamans among the Mehinaku (Gregor 1977). Generally, the relationship is conceived of as close and familiar, modelled on the relationship between father and child or master and pet (Fausto 1999: 938). In contrast, when spirits are conceived of as superior to humans, the differences and the asymmetry between the classes of beings involved give reason to underline the discrimination made between them. The emphasis on dissimilarity is then often associated with the assumption that humans and spirits have different interests. Their mutual relations are, as a consequence, frequently described in transactional terms: that is, as based on propitiation, as among the Mundurucfi (Murphy 1958), or straightforward negotiations, as among the Makuna, who, according to Kaj Arhem (1996b: 61), have established a 'pact of reciprocity' with the spirit-animals, or as among the Bororo, according to whom a covenant regulates human-bope relations (J.C. Crocker 1985: 134). Under these asymmetrical conditions no altruism is to be expected from the supernatural powers, who therefore must be given compensation for the services they render the human supplicants. Thus, following from the differ- ent interests of humans and spirits, their mutual dealings are in these cases charac- terized as trade relations. Human-spirit transactions may take different forms. Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff says in relation to the Colombian Tukano that [w] henever game is scare, the shaman must visit the Master of Animals in a narcotic trance and try to obtain from him the release of some of his charges. He will not ask for individual animals but rather for a good hunting season and in return he promises to send to the Master's abode the souls of persons who, at their death, must return to this great store-house to replenish the energy of those animals the supernatural gamekeeper gives to the hunters (1997: 14). Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 12, 803-816 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 200oo6</page><page sequence="4">806 DAN ROSENGREN Reichel-Dolmatoff, thus, underlines the importance of balancing the reciprocal exchanges. In contrast, Robin Wright, writing about the Arawakan Baniwa, presents a more commercial-like relationship when he says that the encounter of the shaman with Kuwai [the 'owner of sickness'] is ... mediated by the shaman's presenting Kuwai with an offering, a payment called dawai. This consists of a material payment - given to the shaman for his cure and its spiritual form which the shaman presents to Kuwai. In exchange for this, Kuwai will give the shaman the sickness from his body - in its spiritual form - with which the shaman may cure the patient in This World. ... this is a process of negotiation for which a relation of exchange must be established (1998: 87). Further examples of such commercial-like human-spirit transactions abound in the ethnographic literature (e.g. Wilbert 1987; Matteson Langdon &amp; Baer 1992), but I will here mention only one further instance, that of the Arawakan Matsigenka. The Matsigenka are, together with their Ashininka neighbours, of particular relevance to the present argument since they constitute the ethnographic instances that Descola (1992) employs to distinguish the Arawakan alternative from the Tukanoan and Jivaroan animistic systems. In line with the transactional view on transdimensional relations, Gerhard Baer (1984: 202 ff.) describes how the shaman daily feeds his auxil- iary spirits with the juice and smoke of tobacco. In return, these spirits are said to protect the shamans against danger, and during curing sessions they do the actual curing while the shamans serve as mediators constituting the spirits' 'tools.' Thinking about the kind of mutual relationship which Matsigenka shamans and spirits maintain, I found that I was not altogether happy with any of the conventional views on transdimensional relationships since they did not seem to be consistent with the strong egalitarian ethos of the Matsigenka. Moreover, the prominence commonly given to asymmetry and hierarchy in accounts of transdimensional relations seems to conflict with the urge to play down and dissolve differences which also is a common enough social ideal throughout the Amazon. As I approached the relationship, trying to understand how the Matsigenka think about it, I found the notion of 'conviviality', as developed by Joanna Overing and Alan Passes (2000), together with the cognate ideas of 'sharing' and 'trust' to be more in concordance with local conceptions than the stress on the importance of otherness and exchange for the production and reproduction of identity and community.3 In their discussion of Amazonian conviviality, Overing and Passes (2000) stress the importance of focusing on indigenous values and understandings of the good life, that is, of communal living. Essential to the maintenance of such a living is the attention assigned to emotions and the comprehensions of what is fundamental for proper living - a living that is moral as well as aesthetic and emotionally fulfilling. The ethic-aesthetic outlook inherent in the ideal of conviviality should not be con- fused with general altruism. Since an Amazonian community is commonly formed by the assembly of free intersubjective agents, others cannot be controlled and there- fore self-control becomes essential. Thus, the maintenance of social harmony is a delicate matter and principally the responsibility of the individual. The condition that the main responsibility for maintaining social harmony falls on the individual results, however, in an important paradox of Amazonian sociality since great value is, simultaneously, placed on individual freedom and egalitarianism. Thus, to live as freely and independently as possible, social and physical separation is required. To Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 12, 803-816 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="5">DAN ROSENGREN 807 live by oneself is, however, not a full life and living in a community must therefore be tempered by a degree of self-control to allow for a proper social life. The importance assigned to conviviality in the Amazon thus conditions the articu- lation of social relations. Among the Matsigenka, the convivial ideal is heightened the structurally closer the relationship, not only as regards relations between humans, but also between humans and spirit beings. The prime expression of convivial closeness consists in the sharing of resources, which is a social event that demonstrates related- ness, affection, and trust rather than being an instance of economic exchange that, conversely, indicates separation and distance. Hence, the economic value of the resources that are involved may, in contrast to the social value, be comparatively insignificant.4 It is in relation to such affective interaction that the element of trust, based on active mutual and respectful engagement and appreciation, gains its signifi- cance (Price 1975). Such notions of transdimensional mutuality are, apparently, not unique for the Matsigenka. The Arawete's food offerings to their Mai gods, according to Viveiros de Castro (1992: 76), do not have any purpose other than that of coming together, and Kenneth Taylor observes in regard to the performance of Sanuma sha- manism that '[psychoactive] snuff is much enjoyed, by both men and hekula [i.e. spirits]. When the snuff is taken by the shaman, his hekula also enjoy its effects, become intoxicated, dance, sing, and are always more than willing to attempt whatever the shaman has in mind' (1979: 207). Matsigenka: humans and spirits As in many Amerindian languages, there is no term in Matsigenka with the exclusive significance of 'human being'; the most general term is matsigenka, meaning 'person", while other terms are more specific, for example tsirare, 'man' and tsinane, 'woman'. Spirits are designated saangarite, 'the invisible ones'. According to Matsigenka cos- mogony, humankind and spirits were created at the same time and by the same creator god, Tasorintsi.6 Both humans and spirits, together with certain animal and plant species with the same origin, are considered to belong to the same category of beings. This category the Matsigenka designate as matsigenka. The condition that they all are creations of Tasorintsi signifies that they share certain characteristics of personhood and at the time of creation they all lived together socializing freely. As to the nature of humans and spirits, they did not initially differ in any significant sense: both kinds of beings were functionally masterpieces with no flaws in their constitution; they were immortal and they did not know hunger nor illness. While the saangarite have main- tained these qualities, humans lost them when they tired of the perfect living and demanded from Tasorintsi that he should make them mortal and enable them to become hungry and ill. The 'degenerate' humans continued to consort with the saangarite spirits, upon whom they now relied for functions that they were no longer capable of themselves. After a while some of the humans became increasingly demanding. The spirits got fed up with the humans - whom they started to refer to as mavcientini, or 'mortals' - and they decided to cut the link literally, in the tangible form of a big liana that united this world with theirs. However, the saangarite informed those humans with whom they maintained good relations about their intention so that they could climb the liana and join their spirit friends. Those humans who were allowed to join the spirits eventually became spirits themselves through the association and, thus, they overcame the defec- tiveness of humankind.

Royal Anthropological Institute 200oo6</page><page sequence="6">808 DAN ROSENGREN Although humankind's present prospects are bleak, people may still entertain some hope of overcoming the limitations of the human condition. Humans may even now transform and become saangarite spirits. Those who have entertained good relations with saangarite during their lifetime go after death to stay with their spirit friends in their world, where they eventually turn into spirits themselves. Since the separation of the worlds, contacts with the saangarite have been limited and are maintained princi- pally by the shamans. Thus, paraphrasing Viveiros de Castro (1992: 61), the separation from the spirits is the precondition and motive for Matsigenka shamanism. The Matsigenka shaman and his relations with the spirit world In line with Amazon shamanism in general (Barbira Freedman 2002; Wilbert 1987), Matsigenka shamanism relies heavily on the use of tobacco. The Matsigenka shaman is known as seripigari, a denomination composed by seri, 'tobacco', the suffix ri being the third-person male pronominal object, that is, 'him', and the verb root piga deriving from a concept with a complex meaning dimension. One meaning of the verb pigagan- tsi (the infinitive of piga) is 'to intoxicate' which makes Baer (1992) render seripigari 'he who is intoxicated by tobacco.' Another possible meaning dimension has been sug- gested by Glenn Shepard (1998: 331), who notes that pigagantsi also can be translated as 'to return' which would render seripigari 'the one who returns tobacco'. This return refers, according to Shepard, to the regurgitation of tobacco that shamans swallow and then pass on to their apprentices, who in the process acquire the same magical powers as their teachers. Shepard's translation suggests, however, still another possible inter- pretation: the receivers of the returned tobacco could also be the saangarite spirits, who in mythical time gave humans the tobacco and whom shamans now daily feed with tobacco smoke and syrup. Of the various possible interpretations of the word seripigari I do not believe that one necessarily is more correct than the other; the polysemy rather reflects different aspects of the complex whole. One thing that the various alternative interpretations suggested have in common is that they are all associated with forms of ethereal communion. The intoxication of Baer's interpretation is a prerequisite for humans and spirits to come together to enjoy each other's company, and in the two latter versions, commensality with the purpose of diffusing knowledge/power is the central element. As a ritual specialist, the shaman possesses deeper insights into metaphysics than do people in general. The importance of the Matsigenka shaman does not, however, primarily follow from his specialized knowledge of ritual and cosmology but from his personal acquaintance with the saangarite. Thus, neither the possession of esoteric knowledge nor the altered state of consciousness induced by the ingestion of psycho- active drugs is considered sufficient to engage in rewarding relationships with the saangarite. To become accepted by spirits, a necessary initial step is the establishment of personal relations with one of them, who subsequently becomes the shaman's auxiliary spirit, inetsdane, literally 'he with whom I converse'. The spirit helpers reside in either peculiarly shaped 'transparent' stones or in small wooden anthropomorphic figures,7 both of which are known as serepitontsi, a designation that Baer translates as 'tobacco stone' (1984: 327). Serepitontsi stones are usually found in or alongside rivulets or brooks. The stones are said to appear to people with whom the spirits wish to establish contact. The stones are easily recognized because they have indentures that make them resemble a human face and they are almost transparently colourless. If a serepitontsi stone is picked up and ]ournal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 12, 803-816 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 200oo6</page><page sequence="7">DAN ROSENGREN 809 kept, the finder is supposed to enter into a life-long relationship with the 'resident' spirit. In the case of the stone being black, it is the abode of a demon and it is of interest only to sorcerers, whose relations to demons are similar to those that shamans maintain with spirits. If by accident a demon stone should be found by someone who is not a sorcerer nor is interested in becoming one, the stone is immediately thrown into a deep part of a river or buried in the ground far into the forest in order to hide it from those who might be inclined to make use of it. To pick up and keep these stones thus constitutes a performative act creating the particular relationship.8 The possession of a stone of this kind confers certain benefits on the finder, but it also signifies a commit- ment. The acceptance of the stone seals the establishment of a trustful relationship that requires that the keeper daily feeds the spirit in the stone. Should the keeper fail to honour this agreement, he or she may fall ill and perhaps even die. Given the designation of the shaman, tobacco is obviously of great significance to the Matsigenka. An important distinction must be made, however, between the tobacco that is locally cultivated and the industrially produced cigarettes that can be bought from local traders. Today practically all men smoke cigarettes when they have an opportunity. In contrast, the everyday consumption of locally produced tobacco is largely limited to senior men, who take it either as a finely grained snuff that is blown up the nose through tubes9 or ingested as a viscous 'syrup', known as seri opatsa (literally 'tobacco's turbid water'), which is generally acknowledged to be so strong that only grown men can take it. The native tobacco is, accordingly, consumed in a more restricted manner than the industrially produced cigarettes. Native tobacco is, more- over, used for somewhat different motives. According to Baer (1995: loi), its use makes the shamans approach the status of the spirits, blurring the boundaries between them (cf. Barbira Freedman 2002: 141) and, as a consequence, it is treated, it seems, more 'respectfully'. The condition that only the locally produced tobacco serves to turn strangers into kin concords with Cecilia McCallum's (2001: 76) observation that the employment of that which one produces defines one's position in society vis-a-vis significant others. The importance that the Matsigenka assign to the act of producing that which is to be consumed is, for instance, indicated by the difference with which they view locally grown tobacco, which is shared with the spirits, and the cigarettes that are industrially produced and which are consumed for the mere pleasure of the smokers. While the industrially produced cigarettes are smoked only for pleasure, the con- sumption of locally produced tobacco also engages the cosmic forces. The nurturing of the spirit helpers is an expression of the bond of community that exists between the shaman and his spirit helper, which makes them share their respective assets rather than exchange them. The condition that the 'tobacco stone' is kept by the shaman in his home signifies, furthermore, that there is an element of commensality in their rela- tionship. As the relation between shaman and spirit is supposed to be permanent once it has been established, the 'soul' (isure) of the shaman goes after his corporeal death to stay with his spirit friends, among whom it will go on living. This bond is, accordingly, personal, and between persons who consider themselves so close that they can rest assured that their mutual expectations are fulfilled. Barbira Freedman argues that'[t]obacco complements the shamanic diet in order to establish a commonality of substance with the cosmic identities' (2002: 151). That consumption of tobacco is so important for both Matsigenka shamans and spirits could, accordingly, be taken as an instance of this condition. However, although dietary ]ournal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 12, 803-816 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 200oo6</page><page sequence="8">810 DAN ROSENGREN practices constitute an important identity marker for Matsigenka people (Baer 1984: 149; Rosengren 2003), to stress the significance of eating the same thing for producing identity would render greater importance to corporeality than the Matsigenka would be ready to acknowledge. To eat manioc is, for instance, an important identity marker, but to the Matsigenka, eating manioc is considered to be a constitutive trait of human- kind: it is in the nature of humans to eat manioc; eating manioc does not transform beings into humans. To the Matsigenka it is, accordingly, agency and not substance that imports and it is, thus, the habit of eating together that produces intimacy and even- tually identity. The creation of a community of similars When a shaman is in contact with his auxiliary spirit, they usually address each other as 'brothers'." The establishment of a 'brother'-relationship is a prominent expression of the closeness of the shaman-spirit relation. In accordance with the relationship terminology, the shaman and his auxiliary spirits, thus, stand in a classificatory sibling relation to each other. It is not, though, the creation of consanguinity that in itself is important to the Matsigenka. Consanguinity is merely an expression of the kind of relationship that one aspires to establish. What is important is the positional similarity and the special kind of relationship that can be expected between same-sex siblings. Among the Matsigenka, 'brothers' are close. At times the structural closeness makes the relationship competitive, which is most clearly seen in regard to potential marriage partners. However, in most instances, that is, in the case of pre-pubescent and adult married men, the relationship is co-operative, and when adult married brothers are close neighbours they usually see each other frequently and they co-operate in a number of chores, such as clearing their respective swiddens, building fish traps, and constructing houses. The relation between brothers is in many respects similar to that of the relation between brothers-in-law: both kinds of relationship are as a rule based on amity and benevolence, mutual attitudes that are expressed in the many co-operative efforts that are undertaken by men who are thus related to each other. To some degree the brother-in-law-relation is even more affable than the brother-relation as the element of competition for a wife is absent. However, one crucial condition makes the two relationship modes different: the brother-in-law-relationship is based on a transaction between two distinct parts - the complementary distinctiveness of the two integrands being the uniting condition. In contrast, the brother-relationship is based on the circumstance that the integrands occupy the same structural position that links them by ties of community. The sharing of this position signifies that they need not calculate their respective contributions to maintain a balance between them. Rather, their fundamental 'sameness' as brothers (i.e. as same-sex siblings) disallows competition and divergence. In consequence, they can trust each other, and if the one for some reason cannot contribute to the same extent as the other, this will not negatively affect their relationship. In practice, we can see that pairs of brothers either care for each other, sharing freely of their time and assets, or they have broken their relationship, distrusting each other's intentions. To address a spirit as 'brother', thus, suggests that the shaman's relation to his auxiliary spirit is not only one of closeness, but also one that stresses similarity, trust, and co-operation. The degree of closeness of the shaman-spirit relation is insinuated in the construction of the denomination for shaman, that is, seripigari. Pigagantsi (the nominal form of piga), 'to intoxicate', 'to return', is associated with the word Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 12i, 803-816 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="9">DAN ROSENGREN 811 gipigagantsi, which means, among other things, 'to make one return to the place of origin' (Snell 1998: 92). The shaman could, in accordance, also be seen as the one who returns to the primordial conditions that initially were shared by all matsigenka, that is, by humans and saangarite spirits alike. In re-establishing the primordial qualities of life, the shaman overcomes the present human destiny of dying since he will join his saangarite friends at corporeal death and continue a full life. Death without previously having established intimate contacts with saangarite spirits is dreaded by both living and dead because it signifies a definitive end to sociality; it is the discontinuation of the relations of trust and sharing that were maintained during life and that are central elements to a good life. During the first days after death, the death spirit, kamatsiri, of a deceased person will desperately attempt to avoid the unavoidable and strive to maintain contact with members of his or her family. Since death is contagious, this attempt of the death spirit may potentially have fatal results for the survivors. As a consequence, the first few days after a family member's death are spent severing the ties that connected them during the lifetime of the now deceased (Shepard 2002). To effect the separation, the corpse of the dead is either sent down the river or buried in a way that makes the kamatsiri disorientated and unable to find its way back home, where the family members remain to avoid being encountered by the rambling spirit. The survivors cut their hair and paint themselves to avoid recognition in case they should be spotted by the kamatsiri. The desperation of the death spirits of those who do not manage to continue their existence among the saangarite follows partly from the asocial afterlife that awaits them since they have lost their social involvement. Partly the fear follows from the existential stasis that is produced by death in their case as they have lost all possibilities to regain the primordial qualities of life. As dead, they have no possibility of becoming like the saangarite, and death signifies for them that they are doomed to an eternal Otherness. Contact with the saangarite spirits is, thus, essential in order to avoid being trapped in the present human condition. Besides tobacco the Matsigenka use a number of psychoactive drugs as means for contacting the spirits. The most common of the alternative drugs is ayahuasca or yage' (Banisteriopsis spp.). To prepare the drug, the man who is going to stage a seance goes into the forest to gather the ingredients. When the vine and leaves to be used are brought back to the house they are given to the woman who is to prepare the brew. The preparation of the brew is a delicate matter, and the dangers of 'pollution' are usually commented upon as a factor that may prevent contact with the saangarite spirits. The polluting essence is the smell that emanates both from having sex and from menstrual blood, which the Matsigenka describe as intoxicating. Since both sex and menstrual blood are linked to procreation the human way, they are signs of dissimilarity in relation to the spirits and should therefore be repressed. When Matsigenka talk to me about these matters they tend to stress the prohibitive aspect of the rule underlining who is not allowed to prepare the drug and why, leaving the positive indication of the rule only tacitly implied by the contrast. According to most of my interlocutors it is pre- pubertal girls who should prepare the potion since they are constitutionally closer to the saangarite spirits than post-menstrual women, who are 'stained' by their earlier sexu- ality and therefore continue to exude and transmit what the sensitive saangarite expe- rience as a foul stench. This does not, however, signify that woman's nature in itself is considered to be impure and corrupting; it is only so in relation to the saangarite. It should be stressed that the notion of 'pollution' here is my interpretation of what Matsigenka talk about as states that are either 'dangerous' (kantagantsi) or 'not good' Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 12, 803-816 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="10">812 DAN ROSENGREN (terira kametitake). The sense of 'pollution' referred to is, of course, Mary Douglas's notion of 'matter out of place' which is applicable here as humans and spirits live separately and the contact produced by the use of psychoactive drugs thus effects a meeting of 'matter' from different spheres. The 'dangers' involved are increased as the contact is not between beings who are merely of a different kind but now, since human degeneration, they also differ in their respective powers. To the Matsigenka, the differ- ence between humans and spirits signifies that the saangarite potentially may create dangers through their lack of concern for the anonymous mass of unfamiliar humans. However, the Matsigenka differ from the saangarite owing to their own actuation, through which they lost the perfection that the saangarite still retain, which means that something can be done to improve the situation. By socially cultivating the spirits, the risk of becoming victims of the spirits' ire is reduced as humans become more familiar to them, both in the sense of 'being known' and in the sense of 'being like family'. Thus, humans become more similar to the spirits. To familiarize Others is a strategy common throughout the Amazon, where 'those who in the first instance are dangerously "dif- ferent in kind" ... become "of a kind" through the process of living together ... to achieve a safe, yet fertile, "community of similars" ' (Overing 2003: 300). To underline the constitutional similarities with the saangarite spirits, sex is abstained from when one is about to socialize with them," not because sex is impure or improper per se, but because it accentuates the difference with the spirits. To use girls who have not reached their reproductive age to produce the crucial means for contact- ing the spirits is thus a way to play down this fundamental difference. Accordingly, among humans, sex is not necessarily'matter out of place'; it is so only in their relations to the saangarite. Sexual abstinence is, consequently, another expression for the bond of 'community' with the spirits. The saangarite spirits are contacted during seances, which are usually held in the house of the shaman, where he is assisted by his wife/wives, his auxiliary spirit, and perhaps also an apprentice. The seance is held at night and in complete darkness except for the feeble light from a small oil lamp that helps the participants find their way to the jug containing the psychoactive potion. The drug is taken intermittently until the shaman starts to chant hummingly, after which the brew is left untouched. The singing takes the form of a dialogue in which the shaman's wife/wives sing(s) in response to him. Occasionally the shaman climbs a ladder that leads to a platform under the roof, from where various sounds can be heard. According to the Matsigenka, the shaman has now left to visit his saangarite friends while his spirit helper has come to visit the shaman's household. The general understanding, it seems, is that the soul of the shaman leaves while the spirit enters his body. This metempsychosis is possible since the body is something exchangeable which can be worn by various users; metaphorically it is described as the dress, imanchake, of the soul. In a sense, the seance constitutes the ultimate expression of humankind's endeavour to re-establish the perfection that once was lost as shaman and spirit almost become one in that they share the same body. In being as one, they are like brothers, that is, they are structurallythe same in the social universe and the differences that generallyseparate them have at this moment been overcome. When the shaman, who now is in the parallel dimension, arrives at the house of his saangarite friends, he is entertained by his spirit hosts, who give him food and drink in the same way that he nurtures his auxiliary spirit with tobacco. This exchange of food is accounted for not in terms of a reciprocal obligation but as an expression of the close and intimate ties that unite the shaman and his spirit friends. As a consequence of the Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 12, 803-816 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="11">DAN ROSENGREN 813 intimacy that develops over time, the shamans, in contrast to most other humans, do not go to the nether-world when they die, but join the households of their auxiliary spirits, where they live ever after as one of the family. Through consorting with the spirits they eventually overcome the differences that separate them from the perfect spirits and they become saangarite themselves.12 In conclusion, the Matsigenka conceive of the world as a place where primordial forces still play a decisive role in forming the life and well-being of people. Society, nature, and supernature form a coherent whole within which all beings - humans, superhumans, and animals - are interrelating. As social relations among the Matsigenka principally are of a dyadic nature, that is, between individuals with all their particular idiosyncrasies, the various beings involved do not interrelate uniformly. The relations between particular individuals belonging to different categories differ accordingly in the same way and to the same extent that relations within any of the categories may differ. To become accepted by a spirit is not easy as mutual trust and sharing are imperative. Shamanism among the Matsigenka can therefore be seen as a personal project with the purpose of establishing contact with the saangarite spirits and emulating them in order eventually to become one of them and regain access to the primordial conditions of existence. The shaman also exists, however, within a social context in this world that demands his attention both as a member of the community in which he lives and as someone who has the capacity to affect the well-being of family and friends. To attain a good life, all relations must be attended to, and shamans therefore commonly acquire an impor- tant social position as they 'connect' different worlds, allowing the denizens of the respective dimensions to share in the resources of the various realms. A non-dualistic alternative Descola's view of Arawakan animism obviously differs from the account given here of Matsigenka notions of their transdimensional relations. Rather than stressing differ- ence and inequality, the Matsigenka account for the relations they maintain with spirits in terms of sameness and parity. The principal endeavour of the shamans is, accord- ingly, to engender a relation of familiarity with the saangarite, which, for instance, is expressed in shared rights to common resources. The act of sharing is, consequently, more important to Matsigenka in the maintenance of their transdimensional relations than the kind of economic transactionalism that is taken for granted in conventional interpretations as the common mode of human-spirit relations. In spite of the wide range of variation in Amazon peoples' conceptions of trans- dimensional relations, a number of elements seem to be recurrent. Here I wish briefly to highlight two of these elements: the anthropomorphic shape of the spirits, which goes back to mythical time before distinctions were introduced; and the use of rela- tionship terms when addressing these spirits. Arguably, the significance given to these two elements suggests a desire on the part of the humans to establish and maintain the conceived similitude with spirits in order to form a close and intimate relationship by which the frailty of the human condition can be overcome, to enter 'the safe haven of the Same', to paraphrase Viveiros de Castro (1992: 216). However, in contrast to the Tupi-Guaranian Arawetd, described by Viveiros de Castro (1992), to acquire sameness is for the Matsigenka not a process of other-becoming but a means to overcome separation by regaining the existential qualities that once were lost. To acquire sameness is for the Matsigenka also a means to attain the ideal of equality, which is a prominent part of their social ethos. To achieve this goal requires not only the Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute (N.S.) 12, 803-816 ? Royal Anthropological Institute 2006</page><page sequence="12">814 DAN ROSENGREN repression of hierarchy but also the obliteration of structures of distinction in order to be consonant with the ideal of good living where mutual trust and the sharing of common assets are guiding principles. At this point, when individuals 'fuse' to become part of a community that straddles ontological borders, the present constitutive dif- ferences between humans and spirits are dissolved and humans return to the pristine conditions that once were lost. NOTES This article has benefited from the insightful and constructive comments of Lisa Akesson, Kaj Arhem, Diana Walters, and the anonymous JRAI reviewers, to all of whom I am grateful. The author alone is responsible for any remaining inadequacies. I thank the Swedish Research Council for funding. 1 There have been challenges to the adequacy of the Manichean moral system for the Arawakan peoples referred to by Descola (Rosengren 1998; Shepard 2003). 2 Although this kind of internalization is usually an indication of human superiority, it is not always the case. Among the Arawete the shamans say that their dealings with the gods make them 'impregnated with divinity'. However, the shamans remain in a subordinate position in which they serve as vehicles for the gods. When, for instance, songs come from the shamans, the shaman is likened to a radio that transmits the singing of the gods (Viveiros de Castro 1992: 220, 224). 3 For a critical assessment of the 'exchange perspective', see Fausto (1999). 4 This is an aspect held forth by Nurit Bird-David (1990; 1992; 1999), who describes the relation between the Nayaka of Tamil Nadu and their environment in terms of a 'cosmic economy of sharing', which apparently has much in common with the Amazonian transdimensional relations that are discussed here. 5 The Matsigenka usage of the term as an ethnonym is relatively recent and goes back only to the late 196os or early 1970s (Rosengren 2003). 6 To most Matsigenka, the majority of spirits and demons are anonymous individuals, and vice versa, that is, to spirits and demons the category of humans is formed by an equally anonymous mass. It is only shamans and sorcerers who transgress the collective anonymity and relate on a personal basis with individual spirits or demons. In the minds of people, spirits and demons differ from gods (tasorintsi) in that the latter possess an individuality. Gods are known by personal names, they are gendered, and they have their proper histories that are known from the myths. 7 I have seen the wooden figures only in museum collections and I will not discuss them here, but they pose a problem as to how they are infused by the spirits since the wooden figures, in contrast to the stones, are human-made and, thus, it is unclear on whose initiative contact is established. The animation of wooden figures is, however, known from other contexts. In a myth recounted by Shepard (2003: 249-51) it is said that when a married couple in mythical time wanted to have a child they carved a human figure, using soft wood if they desired a girl and hard wood if they wished for a boy. The figure was left in the forest for three days, after which it had transformed into the child they desired. 8 Similar performative orderings have been observed elsewhere in theAmazon as well (Londofio Sulkin 2004). 9 The use of snuff seems to be common in the Manu area, while it has fallen out of use entirely in the Upper Urubamba area, which is the region familiar to me. The smoking of native tobacco seems to be limited to what can be considered ritual events. 10 An illustration of the literal understanding of these terms is given by Baer (1984: 202), who reports that a man treated his father's inetsdane as apa ('father') in accordance with the relationship terminology whereby no terminological distinction is made between F and FB. " This applies to shamans as well as for hunters, who engage with the game animals' spirit owners. 12 This is a recurrent theme in many Matsigenka myths (Baer 1984; Barriales n.d.; Renard de Casevitz 1991; Rosengren 1998), where the transformation is effected as a concluding occurrence that largely corresponds to the narrative ending of the main protagonists 'living happily ever after' that is a common feature in Western oral tradition.

Relations transdimensionnelles : des interactions entre humains et esprits en Amazonie Resume Il y a longtemps deja que l'animisme interesse l'anthropologie, et plusieurs approches nouvelles ont et6 opposdes r6cemment aux points de vue traditionnels. Inspire par ces id6es recentes sur un sujet classique, l'auteur explore la conceptualisation de la relation avec les esprits (relation transdimensionnelle), pierre angulaire de toute theorie de l'animisme. A partir d'un travail de terrain chez les Matsigenka, habitants des plaines tropicales du sud-ouest du Perou, il examine les conceptions et motivations des interactions avec les esprits. Dans la mesure ohi la societe des Matsigenka accorde une grande place ai l'egalite et a la convivialit6, l'approche adopt6e par de nombreuses etudes, qui met I'accent sur la discrimination et les relations hierarchiques, ne convient pas dans leur cas. Pour se rapprocher davantage de leur ethos, l'article souligne les qualites conviviales du partage et de la confiance mutuelle. Ces deux vertus r6duisent l'importance de la hierarchie et de la discrimination et permettent de comprendre ce qui peut inciter les Matsigenka h nouer une relation souvent difficile et exigeante avec les esprits. Dan Rosengren is Associate Professor of Social Anthropology at Gothenburg University. He has worked extensively among Matsigenka people in the montafia of southeastern Peru. Lately his research has focused on notions of identity related to both 'indigeneity' and cosmology/ontology.
