Assis do Rio Grande do Sul e A. calliantha M. C. Assis de Minas Gerais. Descriçoes, comentârios e ilustraçôes säo aqui apresentadas. Key words: Alstroemeria, Alstroemeriaceae, Bra- zil, IUCN Red List, Minas Gérais, Rio Grande do Sul. The genus Alstroemeria L. (Alstroemeriaceae) comprises perennial herbs that are erect and rhizo- matous with storage roots. The leaves are sessile, simple, entire, generally resupinate (twisted near the base or along the lamina), and either concentrated toward the stem apex, distributed along the stem, or as a rosette on a short stem. Blades can be membranous, chartaceous, or leathery; linear, lanceolate, elliptic, or oblong; and either glabrous on both faces or papillose on the adaxial face. The inflorescence is terminal as an umbel-like, simple or branched cyme of two to many flowers or rarely the flowers may be solitary, wrapped within the leaflike bracts. Flowers are zygomorphic and bisexual, with six tepals petaloid and free, in two whorls. The tepals may be similar or different, the inner often shorter, patterned, and basally narrowed into a canaliculate base with nectariferous ducts. The stamens are six, free, and in two whorls. The anthers are pseudobasifixed, with longitudinal introrse dehiscence. The ovary is inferior, syncarpous, 3-carpellate, and trilocular with axilar placentation; the style is apical, with three stigmas, and many anatropous ovules. The fruit is a dehiscent, loculicidal capsule, and the seeds are globose, without a sarcotesta. Also known as the Lily of the Incas, Alstroemeria species and hybrid taxa have gained worldwide popularity as cut flowers due to their appearance and excellent keeping quality. They are also satisfac- tory for growing in pots and for use in gardens and landscaping. The genus is restricted to South America and is found in a wide range of habitats including cloud forests, swamps, and desert areas, from the high Andes to marshy lands. Despite the lack of knowledge and studies regarding population dynamics, as well as the scarcity or absence of exsiccatae for Alstroemeria in most of Brazil, the restricted geographic distribu- tion for most species suggests the vulnerability of its taxonomic populations, mainly from anthropomorphic actions. Bayer (1987) recognized 31 Chilean species of Alstroemeria. Sanso (1996) reviewed the Argentinean Alstroemeria species and recognized 10 taxa with one endemic species. Taxonomic revision of the genus for Brazil (Assis, 2001) distinguished 38 species distrib- uted in the eastern regions of the country, including 35 endemic species and 10 newly described species (Assis &amp; Mello-Silva, 2004; Assis, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2006). With the recognition of two additional species, described below, the genus Alstroemeria in Brazil now comprises 40 species. 1. Alstroemeria albescens M. C. Assis, sp. nov. TYPE: Brazil.

Leaves of the vegetative stem evenly distributed along the stem, not resupinate, blade linear, 1.5-11.5 X 0.4-0.5 cm, coriaceous, apex acuminate, base cuneate, both faces glabrous; leaves of the reproductive stem distributed along the stem, not resupinate, blade linear or linear- lanceolate, 1.5-6 X 0.4-0.6 cm, coriaceous, apex acuminate, base truncate, both faces glabrous. Inflorescence an umbel-like, composite cyme of 3 to 10 flowers; pedicel glabrous, 2-2.5 cm; bracts leaflike, chartaceous, 0.8-0.9 cm; bracteoles mem- branous, 0.3-0.5 cm. Flowers patent, campanulate, white-lilac, 2.2-3 cm; tepals 6 in 2 whorls; the outer tepals unpatterned, all 3 very similar, spatulate; the upper one ca. 2 X 0.8 cm; the lower two ca. 1.9 X 0.7 cm; the inner tepals ruby spotted, all 3 very similar; the upper two ca. 1.9 X 0.5 cm; the lower one ca. 1.9 X 0.5 cm; stamens 6, included, filaments glabrous, ca. 1-2 cm; stigma included, style glabrous, ca. 1.5-1.6 cm. Capsules 1.3-1.5 X 0.7-1 cm. Habitat and distribution. Alstroemeria albescens is endemic to the Morro Säo Pedro in Porto Alegre, state of Rio Grande do Sul, and is found on rocky outcrops at 130 to 160 m elevation. IUCN Red List category. The new species is Data Deficient (DD) according to IUCN Red List criteria (IUCN, 2001), and needs further investigation. Phenology. Flowers were collected from January to March. Etymology. The epithet is from the Latin "albes- cens," meaning "becoming white" or "whitish," in reference to the color of the flowers. Discussion. Alstroemeria albescens is character- ized by its whitish lilac flowers and ruby-spotted inner tepals. The vegetative stems of this species are very similar to A. amabilis M. C. Assis, A. malmeana Kraenzlin, and A. sellowiana Seubert ex Schenk, which occur in the South Region of Brazil, from Parana to Rio Grande do Sul states. The new species can be differentiated from these related taxa by the floral characters indicated in Table 1. Paratypes. BRAZIL.
