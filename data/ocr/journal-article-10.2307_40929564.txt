The table had been composed by the architect August Endell (1871-1925), who explained in the accompanying essay that each word corresponded to a feeling [Geftihl), produced as a result of forms exerting their immediate effects on the physiol- ogy of the beholder.2 According to Endell, the variations of these emotive effects [Gefuhlswirkungen) were the product of two fac- tors: the tension and the tempo of perception, represented in the table by the horizontal and the vertical axes respectively.3 On the next page was a series of diagrammatic elevations that demonstrated how architecture revealed this immediate relationship between form and affect. By simply changing the proportions of a fagade, Endell claimed, an architect could make the beholder feel emotions as diverse as "simple, intimate, warm," "serious, deep, sublime," or "proud, strict, violent, and fierce."4 Founded in 1897 to promote a new, antihistoricist approach to art, Dekorative Kunst was not unsympathetic to Endell's concerns. Still, the editors admitted to being puzzled by the table. In what read like a disclaimer at the end of the text, they declared that Endell's ideas had "moved into such a new and abstract territory" that they were pleased to publish them but could not fully endorse them.5 A few years would pass before Dekorative Kunst recognized Endell's essay as a theoretical account of the new direction in German aes- thetics. In an essay published in the journal in 1904, the critic Karl Scheffler (1869-1951) praised Endell for having courageously ventured into what he called the "dark region" of the theory of form- effects.6 After acknowledging similar attempts by the critic Julius Meier-Graefe (1867-1935), the decorative artist Henry van de Velde (1863-1957), and the painter Wilhelm von Debschitz (1871-1948), Scheffler complained that the exact relationship between forms and Grey Room 40, Summer 2010, pp. 50-83. c 2010 Grey Room, Inc. and Massachusetts Institute of Technology 51</page><page sequence="3">their effects was still to be deciphered. He then called on the read- ers of Dekorative Kunst to contribute to this incomplete project. The readers were to send their own observations about the effects of forms, lines, and colors to the journal's editors, who promised that they were now prepared to publish these results regularly.7 Scheffler's call for establishing a collective inventory of formal effects ultimately went unheeded. However, a newfound faith in the power of forms, an idea that Scheffler identified at the heart of emergent art movements, had been subtly changing the terms of aesthetic discourses in Germany for the previous few decades. By the last decade of the century, it was not unusual to hear declarations about the death of the aesthetic philosophies of Hegel, Schelling, and even Kant - "aesthetics from above" [Asthetik von oben), as the physicist Gustav Theodor Fechner (1801-1887) had called it.8 Artists, architects, critics, museum officials, and academics from the disciplines of philosophy, art history, and psychology took turns arguing that German aesthetics was in need of a radical reorienta- tion; it was to be steered away from the metaphysics of the beautiful and the sublime toward an "aesthetics from below" [Asthetik von unten) that would concern itself with the mechanics of lived experience [Erlebnis). Described as "scientific," "experimental," or "practical" and almost always as "psychological," the new aesthetics was to be established on the building blocks of concrete experi- ence - that is, sensations, impressions, feelings, and effects con- ceived before the intervention of the mind.9 Calls for a more experientially founded aesthetics at the end of the nineteenth century frequently drew on "psychophysics," a field of research whose invention in the 1860s was also attributed to Fechner.10 Considered the precursor of experimental psychology, psychophysics sought to correlate - quantitatively in charts, graphs, and tables similar to Endell's - external stimuli in the environment to internal sensations felt by the subject. The term Wirkung, crucial to Endell's aesthetic theories, had acquired special meaning in psy- chophysical discourses. Evoking the mechanistic language of cause and effect, the term was shorthand for the elusive category of lived experience. Artists and critics frequently discussed the emotive effects of forms, lines, and colors at the turn of the century, but few attempted to analyze these effects in as systematic a manner as Endell proposed. For Endell a methodical analysis of emotive effects was not only an exercise in formal invention but had loftier intellectual aspirations. In an essay written in 1904, for example, he made an astounding conceptual leap from the mechanics of emotive effects to questions about the foundations of knowledge: It is necessary to succeed in ordering the confusing manifold- ness of feeling and in tracing it to a principle . . . because 52 Grey Room 40</page><page sequence="4">without that, history as science [Wissenschaff] is not a possi- bility. For feeling ... is not a lyrical illusoriness, but in reality gives something that is absolutely clear and definite, real and factual We do everything we do not for the sake of things-in- themselves but for the sake of the value that they receive through our feelings. So long as we do not grasp the essence of feeling scientifically, we will achieve neither an accurate political economy nor a political or religious science, neither political nor cultural history, neither economic history nor art history.11 What Endell was advocating here was nothing less than reestab- lishing the entirety of the human sciences [Geisteswissenschaften] - encompassing what we would today call the humanities and the social sciences - on the foundation of emotions rather than reason. Endell was not merely making a vague allusion to the psychology of form: he insisted that emotions be classified and analyzed with mathematical precision. Triangulating aesthetics, ethics, and epis- temology in his writings, Endell suggested that only a systematic theory of emotions [Gefuhlslehre] could answer the urgent founda- tional questions regarding knowledge at the end of the nineteenth century. Behind Endell's table, then, was a bold epistemological project, which Scheffler provocatively described as "logarithm- fantasy" [Logarithmenphantastik) and "mathematics of living feel- ing" [Mathematik des lebendigen Gefuhls).12 Endell's theory of emotive effects was what one could call "metrics of experience," a sci- ence that purported to analyze lived experi- ence with a methodological rigor comparable to that of the natural sciences. Endell's aspira- tion to make lived experience into the very foundation of knowledge was influenced by his teacher Theodor Lipps (1851-1914) as well as by the philosophies of Wilhelm Dilthey (1833-1911) and Edmund Husserl (1859-1938), who laid the groundwork for twentieth-century phenomenology. But Endell's foundationalist epistemology assumed a more concrete form than that of these philosophers: his theory of emotions was firmly anchored in architecture. Endell's combination of mathematical rigor and lived experience may appear unusual to the twenty-first-century reader who is accus- tomed to a more antagonistic relationship between the humanities and the natural sci- ences - especially where human experience is Rudolf Schulze.

Alexander | Metrics of Experience: August Endell's Phenomenology of Architecture 53</page><page sequence="5">concerned. Within architectural circles today the idea that archi- tecture might be "mathematics of living feeling" would find more detractors than supporters. Given Endell's phenomenological incli- nations, it is ironic that the incommensurability of experience with the so-called exact sciences has been asserted especially forcefully by what has come to be known as architectural phenomenology. Considered a defense of lived experience, this approach is predi- cated upon an assumption about the history of modernism: that the collusion between scientific rationality and modern architecture has impoverished human experience and turned architecture into an "instrument of technological domination."13 Endell's metrics of experience, then, is an architectural phenomenology that is at odds in its basic assumptions with its twentieth- and twenty-first-century counterparts. By unpacking the ethical, epistemological, and, finally, disciplinary project behind Endell's table, I hope to elucidate this turn-of-the-century championing of lived experience. But my goal is not only historical. By understanding the ambitious assertions that Endell made over a hundred years ago about the foundations of knowledge, we may also learn something new about the disci- plinarity of architecture today. The Ethical Project: Architecture of Pathognomy "I have touched an area, practically ignored, the burning question of all philosophy, the goal of all psychology, and the point of depar- ture of applied psychology," Endell wrote in 1896; "that is, of all ethics, logic, aesthetics, etc., and that is the theory of feeling [Gefiihlstheorie'!nA Endell came to Munich from Tubingen in 1892 after having abandoned his philological studies. Instead he wanted to study mathematics and the natural sciences out of an interest in what he called the "new philosophy," which, he explained, replaced Hegelian speculation with questions about the psychology of perception.15 Soon, however, he started questioning the natural sci- ences' insistence on causality and turned to ethics and aesthetics as the foundation of the new philosophy.16 Endell's intellectual struggles were documented in the letters he wrote to his cultural historian cousin, Kurt Breysig (1866-1940), in the 1890s. At a moment when academic departments at German universities were being restructured and disciplinary boundaries - especially between the natural and the human sciences - were being negotiated, Endell's ever-changing career plans revealed more than an indecisive personality. His disciplinary questioning demonstrated the episte- mological anxieties of the late-nineteenth century. By his own account, the vibrant artistic culture of Munich provided some answers to these dilemmas: debates about the Munich Secession, the applied arts movement [Kunstgewerbebewegung), the poetry of Stefan George, and, above all, the work of Hermann Obrist (1863-1927), whose 54 Grey Room 40</page><page sequence="6">embroideries, according to Endell, had an immediate formal effect on the beholder comparable to the influence of music.17 Despite having never been trained as an artist, Endell decided in the mid-1890s to pursue a career in architecture and the decorative arts. The appeal of aesthetics, he wrote, was that it did not float in the air like other philosophical fields but was "grounded in literature and the arts."18 Once Endell discovered emotive effects as a productive field of theoretical exploration, he turned them into the focus of his endeavors as an architect, decorative artist, critic, and pedagogue. He completed his studies in Munich by writing a thesis titled "Gefuhlsconstruktion" (Feeling-construction) under the supervi- sion of Theodor Lipps, known for his theories of empathy [Einfuhlung).19 Influenced by his friend Rainer Maria Rilke (1875- 1926) and the Stefan George circle, Endell tried his hand at poetry before settling on architecture. He outlined his theory of emotions for the first time in the essay Um die Schonheit, a review of the Glaspalast exhibition of 1896, and he continued to elaborate on it until his death in 1925. 20 His theorization of feelings formed the backbone of his pedagogy as well. Both when he taught at his own Schule fur Formkunst (1904-1914) in Berlin and later when he suc- ceeded Hans Poelzig as the director for the Akademie fur Kunst und Kunstgewerbe in Breslau, he insisted on the importance of exploring the emotive effects of forms in the most methodical manner.21 Endell's first attempt at anchoring his theory of emotive effects in architecture was the design of the fagade and the interior spaces of an existing building, the Atelier Elvira in Munich.22 Owned by the feminist couple Anita Augspurg and Sophia Goudstikker, the building housed a photography studio and living quarters for the owners. Soon after Endell's design for the fagade was unveiled in 1898, however, the building became an object of scandal. Particularly August Endell. Atelier Elvira, Munich, 1898. Facade. Alexander | Metrics of Experience: August Endell's Phenomenology of Architecture 55</page><page sequence="7">controversial was the gigantic asymmetrical relief-ornament plas- tered onto the flat surface of the fagade. Composed of interlocking planes of varying textures and bright colors, the relief-ornament was likened to Japanese prints and to illustrations in books by the zoologist Ernst Haeckel.23 Describing his design, Endell used the formalistic vocabulary of effect ( Wirkung), thereby self-consciously avoiding any iconography.24 He forcefully argued for a new kind of architecture that would recognize the immediate power of forms on the human psyche. Modern architecture was to be a pure Formkunst (form-art), which would not stylize natural forms but would concern itself exclusively with formal structures that "[were] nothing and [meant] nothing" and that "[exerted] a direct effect on [the beholder] without any intellectual mediation, like musical tones."25 Despite EndelPs attempts at accounting for his design as pure form, the building was still derided as "octopus Top: August Endell. Atelier Elvira, Munich, 1898. Interior view of the staircase. rococo" and "Chinese embassy."26 Pronounced by one critic to be as dangerous as anarchism, the ornament was ultimately dismantled by National Socialists in 1937 as the city was being "cleaned up" before the opening of the Haus der deutschen Kunst.27 Even his critics, it seemed, believed Endell's modernist rhetoric of immediacy. What was so threatening about the Atelier Elvira? Critics mocked Endell's epiphanic conversion into an artist after his encounters with Obrist and parodied his prose by comparing it to contemporary poetry, but the most pointed criticism came from those who wor- ried about what they perceived to be arbitrariness and lack of discipline in Endell's design.28 In an address delivered in Berlin in 1900, Johannes Otzen, the aca- demic architect who had compared Endell's designs to anarchism a year earlier, singled out the Atelier Elvira as the epitome of a modern architecture that had "endless faith in its own ego [JcA]."29 Modern art's love for Nietzsche's Ubermensch produced what Otzen called the Uberornament - like that on the fagade of the Atelier Elvira - which was no longer the expression of a constructional necessity but was arbitrary and "coquet- tish."30 Otzen's comments - as well as much of the criticism against the building - were col- ored with debates regarding the so-called third sex and the more fluid model of selfhood Bottom: August Endell.

The formalist thinking inherent in the Atelier Elvira signaled a pivotal shift in the way that architecture was conceived in relation to its imagined subject. Within the Beaux- Arts tradition, that relationship had been regulated through the concept of "char- acter" since the eighteenth century. Starting with Charles Le Brun's 1668 lecture on the expression of passions, the idea of character was developed in academic architectural theory as a term that con- cerned itself with the moods and feelings conveyed by architecture. With the incorporation of Cartesian theories of emotional expres- sion, the idea was transformed (in the hands of Jacques-Frangois Blondel, Nicolas Le Camus de Mezieres, and Etienne-Louis Boullee) into a concept that guaranteed - primarily by means of the orders and the ornamental program - that a building conformed to deco- rum and convenance (propriety).35 A military building had to use the Doric order to exude masculinity and firmness, whereas the more elegant and delicate Ionic order was deemed more appropri- ate for a country pleasure house. This understanding of the concept became closely linked to the physiognomic method, which started gaining popularity across Europe after Johann Lavater's publication of Physiognomische Fragmente (1775-1778). 36 According to Antoine-Chrysostome Quatremere de Quincy (1755-1849), the secretary of the Ecole des Beaux- Arts, "character" was "the art of impressing each building with a state so appropriate to its nature or its use that one can read in its salient traits what it is and what it cannot be."37 In the architecture parlante of Claude-Nicolas Ledoux (1736-1806) the concept of character was pushed to such extremes that the river surveyors' house looked like a pipe.38 Such an interest in deep structures was entirely absent from the Atelier Elvira. Endell's theory of emotive effects was oblivious to character, decorum, and convenance in the academic sense. Not only was the Uberornament on the fagade of the building indiffer- ent to the building's program and arrangement of interior spaces, but there was also a notable absence of an overall moral impression to be gained from the building.39 Instead, the building sought to make Top: Johann Caspar Lavater.

If there was any imprinting to speak of here, it was done by the surfaces of the building upon the psyche of the beholder. The relief-ornaments were designed to stamp the beholder with effects as if impressing the proverbial wax tablet. As such, Endell's emotive architecture had less in common with phys- iognomy and more with its nineteenth-century relative pathog- nomy, which studied emotional expressions as facial muscles expanded and contracted under the influence of passions. Unlike physiognomy, which was always interested in depth and character, pathognomy exclusively concerned itself with the sur- faces of the body. The most renowned pathognomist of the nine- teenth century, Guillaume-Benjamin-Armand Duchenne de Boulogne (1806-1875), developed a technique whereby he systematically applied electrical currents to the facial muscles of his subjects as he photographically documented their reactions. In his 1862 treatise Mecanisme de la physionomie humaine (The Mechanism of Human Facial Expression), he described pathognomy as the "gymnastics of the soul."40 Lavater's physiognomy had fixed its attention on the surfaces of the body with the assumption that a deep structure existed beyond the surface. For anyone who knew how to decipher those signs, the message was crystal clear: the pointed nose was as much the telltale sign of a choleric temperament as drooping lips were of the phlegmatic. Duchenne 's pathognomy, by contrast, had no interest in depth. Whereas Lavater's subjects had been merchants, countrymen, and aristocrats, Duchenne preferred empty vessels - he called them "irritable cadavers" - who were so numb and devoid of willpower that they could be posed like mannequins.41 Liberated from the burden of a single essential character, whose decipherment was the topic of physiognomy, the theatrical subject of pathognomy - all surface and no depth - could enact a multitude of characters. This theatricality became especially pronounced in the vaudeville and dance theater that Endell designed in Berlin in 1901 for Ernst von Wolzogen (1855- 1934).42 Situated on a small site in the courtyard of an urban block, the building was arranged around the central space of an auditorium. If the Atelier Elvira impressed its subjects with relief-ornaments, the Wolzogen Theater employed pointillistically painted surface patterns to the same effect. Endell explained that the technique had been borrowed from Belgian pointillist painters.43 On a brown-and-grey background speckles of paint were applied, arranged as a constel- G.-B.

In order to heighten the effect of a total space encompassing the viewers, Endell designed the walls and the ceiling of the audito- rium as a continuum and applied on their surface a pattern of plantlike forms.44 The space aspired to create a Stimmung, a pow- erful atmospheric impression: Endell had painstakingly designed every detail of the building - from ornamentation on the doors to the patterns of the carpets, from the furniture and lighting fixtures to the friezes on the walls. This was an architecture whose surfaces were designed to elec- trify the nerves. Reviewing the Wolzogen Theater, one critic called the building's forms "stabbing and prickly," while Scheffler described the beholder's response to the effects of Endell's forms as "mental acrobatics," which made the nerves "twitch and itch."45 The "intensification of nervous stimulation" that the sociologist Georg Simmel identified in the modern metropolis now appeared in the interior spaces of the Wolzogen Theater.46 What Endell was imagining was an architecture of agitation [Erregung). Because of his connection to Lipps, Endell's work has been understood in ref- erence to theories of Einfuhlung, broadly defined as the mental abil- ity to project and incorporate one's bodily form into an objective vessel. But Endell was thinking of a process of aesthetic perception that proceeded in exactly the opposite direction: The path does not go from essence to appearance. On the contrary, appearances may only begin to signal essences. The form arouses the feeling without any mediation; we know of no intermediary, psychical occur- rences. . . . This is the power of form upon our mind, a direct, immediate influence without any elements in between - by no means an anthropomorphic effect, but one of humanization [Vermenschlich ung) ,47 Endell's architecture of pathog- nomy was predicated on the idea that forms stimulated the physiol- August Endetl.

Vibrating with nervous energy, these forms forced themselves upon their recipient, leaving their mark as patterns on walls, floors, and ceilings. Endell seemed more inter- ested in lines of force emanating from objects and in how this force field set into action the body's expressive muscles than the mental projection of a subject upon an object. Otzen was correct in point- ing out that Endell's architecture subscribed to an unconventional model of selfhood. This was not the unitary, stable, and indivisible self inherent in the academic concept of character but one that was imagined to be as vulnerable to external sensations as Duchenne's mannequin-like subjects. Pathognomy thus posed a crucial question: if emotions did not originate from inner mental states, as Duchenne had demonstrated in his experiments, would it be possible to trig- ger them through external stimulation?48 Pathognomy, in other words, implicitly shifted the emphasis from an internal character to the external environment as the agent of expression. If physiognomy was predicated on the assumption that an inner character pressed its marks upon the face, pathog- nomy implied that emotional expression should be understood as an imprint not from within but from without. In eighteenth-century physiognomic discourses, an emotion was understood to be an affect of mental states within. By the end of the nineteenth century pathognomy argued that emotion should be seen as the effect of external forces. Endell's pathognomic model of emotions was thus beginning to map the outlines of a different kind of self whose conscious- ness did not exist prior to its interac- tions with its surroundings - a self whose consciousness was not securely situated in the mind but was dissi- pated and contingent.49 That the concept of space [Raum), along with a constellation of related terms such as atmosphere and milieu, rose to prominence in art historical and architectural discourses precisely at this historical moment is no coinci- dence. The Jugendstil obsession with surfaces coexisted with a fascination with the atmospheric effects that these surfaces were imagined to project. Nowhere was the idea of atmosphere as elaborately articulated as in Endell's 1908 book Die Schonheit der GroBstadt (The Beauty of the Metropolis), in which Opposite: August Endell. Wolzogen Theater, Berlin, 1901. Interior view of the restaurant. 60 Grey Room 40</page><page sequence="12">he described at length the beautiful "veils of night and day" worn by the notoriously ugly metropolis Berlin.50 The physical structures of the city gave way in EndelFs account of Berlin to its atmospheric spaces. Endell's architecture of pathognomy, then, signaled an incipient change in architecture's ethical function. In previous architectural discourses, concepts such as character, convenance, and decorum had been devised to arbitrate architecture's relationship to society by guaranteeing buildings' conformity to the rules of the social order. By the early twentieth century, such terms began to disap- pear as the concepts of "form" and "space" came to dominate archi- tectural theory - terms that posited lived experience as the only normative measure for architecture. This meant that architectural questions could no longer be resolved by reference to rules about orders, proportions, character, and so on, but would have to be determined exclusively by the physiological mandates of the human body. An immediate kind of relationship was thus forged between architecture and the body. The subject of modern archi- tecture was imagined to be vulnerable to the influence of forms that impressed themselves directly on the subject's physiology. The interaction between architecture and its subject was now under- stood to be similar to the functioning of the reflex arc: immediate, physiological, and taking place outside the nervous centers where higher cognitive processes occurred. The Epistemological Project: Architecture and Bodily Knowledge The model of selfhood that Endell's critics recognized in his architecture was both appealing and alarming at the turn of the century. It was appealing, because the impressionability and suggestibility of this subject accommodated the idea of social reform better than competing mod- els of selfhood. Numerous intertwined reform movements - ranging from the art education to the applied arts to the Lebensreform movements - established the human sensorium as the arena of social change in Germany at the end of the nine- teenth century.51 In the hands of liberals, social reform became an aesthetic prob- lem - literally a matter of managing the onslaught of sensations produced by modernity. Assumed to be embodied by women, children, and the uneducated Alexander | Metrics of Experience: August Endell's Phenomenology of Architecture 61</page><page sequence="13">masses more than the male, Protestant members of the educated middle classes [Bildungsburgertum), the modern subject was imag- ined to be amenable to the influence of the environment whose control and management was now the primary preoccupation of social reformers. But this dyad of an impressionable subject and an environment that impressed its effects on her was also disconcerting. What epis- temological grasp on the world could the modern subject claim if she were merely a passive recipient of sensations indiscriminately striking her body? The post-Kantian model of selfhood had assumed a will-centered, unitary, and indivisible self who filtered the haphazard sensations of the world and turned them into struc- tured experience [Erfahrung). The model of selfhood developed within "aesthetics from below" at the turn of the century, by con- trast, seemed in imminent danger of disintegrating into her discrete sensations at the expense of achieving the plenitude of lived expe- rience, Erlebnis.52 Considered particularly dangerous was the influ- ence of new forms of mass media such as film, which, reformers argued, attacked the sensorium of urban masses with unprece- dented immediacy.53 The weakening of the will, the erosion of the capacity for attention, and a general decline in the cognitive facul- ties of the German nation, it was feared, were the inevitable results of modernity. The structure of the entire social system seemed to be at stake: agency, will, and responsibility became questionable when the boundaries of the self were so fluid.54 If this mutable modern subject were to be a feasible model of selfhood, its epistemological integrity had to be constructed. How to assemble the piecemeal experience of immediate sensa- tions into a coherent whole? While some tried vehemently to tune out the cacophony of modernity in an attempt to preserve the nine- teenth-century model of selfhood, the more liberal-minded specu- lated on the possibility of developing an alternative kind of knowledge that would be independent of the matrix of thought and language that had characterized neohumanistic learning.55 These two attitudes clashed in a debate between Endell and Karl Lory, a historian who penned an attack against the art education move- ment in 1904. 56 According to Lory, advocates of art education were wrong in assuming that modern masses could be educated through aesthetics. The "aristocracy of the spirit" (by which he paradoxi- cally meant the educated middle classes) knew how to enjoy a painting, a piece of music, or a poem in a state of deep contempla- tion and immersion.57 But no amount of education [Bildung], Lory maintained, could teach the masses to undertake the mental work [Denkarbeif] necessary to achieve such a state. Although Germany's public museums were now full of artistic treasures, the working classes walked away from artworks incapable of synthesizing the 62 Grey Room 40</page><page sequence="14">overwhelming confusion of their impressions.58 Lory called the advocates of the art education movement neoromantics: just as the first romantics had tried to stand in the way of the Enlightenment, he wrote, the neoromantics at the turn of the twentieth century "brewed a fog which would cover the clear path of science [Wissenschaft]"59 Endell's counterattack was formulated to dismantle this confla- tion of reason, science, and the Enlightenment.60 Revealing his social-democratic sympathies, Endell argued that working classes were more amenable to aesthetic enjoyment precisely because they made their living with their bodies.61 A workman's enjoyment of music, for example, was not destroyed by his knowledge of a com- poser's name.62 Aesthetic experience was not a matter of knowledge but of habit. Just as neohumanistic learning cultivated Wissen, knowledge attained by means of the intellect, one could imagine an education that trained Konnen, corporeal proficiency of the kind that the working classes possessed. Taking advantages of ambiva- lences inherent in the concept of Bildung - a marker of bourgeois distinction, on the one hand, and a concept signaling the perfectibil- ity of each individual, on the other - Endell was thus theorizing bodily sensations as an unconventional form of knowledge appro- priate for the new subject of modernity. The art education move- ment's insistence on the primacy of prereflexive experience was thus not a betrayal of Enlightenment ideals but their reinstatement. In this way Endell presented emotions (as opposed to reason) as the source of this alternative form of knowledge, which could then be theorized as a Vorwissenschaft; that is, a propaedeutic science that would serve as the foundation of all knowledge.63 The particular undertones of social class in this debate may have been unique to the turn-of-the-century moment, but the possibility of bodily knowledge was by no means a new idea. Particularly influential was the distinction made earlier in the century by the renowned physiologist Hermann von Helmholtz (1821-1894) between Wissen, intellectual cognition dependent on concepts, logic, and language, and Kennen, a bodily familiarity with phe- nomena achieved by the exercising of the muscles "as is necessary for walking on stilts or for skating, for the singer to know how to strike a note with his voice, or the violin-player with his finger, so exactly that its vibration shall not be out by a hundredth part."64 Helmholtz considered Wissen and Kennen appropriate to the nat- ural sciences and human sciences respectively, thereby driving a wedge between academic disciplines.65 But he also predicted that Kennen would achieve a high level of precision and reliability by refining its operations through what he called "aesthetic induc- tions," similar to "logical inductions" in their accuracy but dependent on raw sensations rather than logic. Helmholtz argued that Kennen Alexander | Metrics of Experience: August Endell's Phenomenology of Architecture 63</page><page sequence="15">had realized this degree of precision in one field so far: aesthetics.66 He intimated that following the example of aesthetics, Kennen could be construed as a transdisciplinary epistemological principle for the human sciences. Although the idea of bodily knowledge remained elusive, this Helmholtzian idea was seized upon by a host of reformers at the end of the century. Drawing and manual skills classes at secondary schools, education programs at the newly established public muse- ums, and formalist art history at universities were among the many reform practices established at Wilhelmine institutions with faith in Kennen.67 The Wissen/Kennen distinction was called upon to substantiate a host of other oppositions - reason versus feeling, ver- bal versus nonverbal expression, Wort versus Anschauung, and so on - but in almost every case the opposition was predicated on the ostensible difference between mediated and unmediated percep- tion. Proponents of Kennen imagined that prereflexive experience could serve as the basis of a mode of knowledge that was distinct from scholarly learning - knowledge acquired, for example, by schoolchildren at a museum looking at a painting rather than in the classroom studying Latin.68 If modernity threatened the moral and intellectual integrity of the masses by attacking their sensorium, reformers reasoned, they should respond by devising strategies to convert these haphazard sensations into systematic knowledge. This, according to Scheffler, was what Endell's architecture pur- ported to achieve: [Endell's] ornaments are hieroglyphs and seem to be formulas for entire complexes of linked architectural sensations. To transcribe the causality of plastically formative life forces [Lebenskrafte) with an ornamentally playful pen, to record the necessity of formally motivating energies in an arabesque manner, and to grasp and re-create with a sensitive tempera- ment the eternal urge of nature towards building - that is all that this artist wants. But in this desire there is already a tendency that is architecturally oriented. ... To develop building parts out of ornaments certainly requires an arduous education of the will [Erziehung des Willens); sensations [Empfindungen) have to be transformed into knowledge [Erkenn tnisse) . 69 Scheffler understood the epistemological ambition underlying Endell's forms: to use architecture as a means of converting bodily sensations into knowledge - albeit of an unconventional kind. Although the exact mechanics of this conversion remained to be clarified, Endell identified the modern metropolis and its architec- ture as one site where the modern assault on the senses could be construed as aesthetic indoctrination for the modern subject. This 64 Grey Room 40</page><page sequence="16">required reversing the dominant antiurbanist rhetoric of the turn- of-the-century discourse on the metropolis.70 In Die Schonheit der groBen Stadt, Endell argued that the seemingly banal and notori- ously "formless" surroundings of Berlin were the best environment for the masses to engage in "pure seeing."71 The lessons of the metropolis were neither in its natural beauties nor in its man-made architecture but in its prosaic empty spaces that emanated Stimmungen, forceful and theatrical atmospheric effects under changing weather conditions.72 Endell took the project of transforming Kennen into systematic knowledge seriously. Hence his encyclopedic approach to orna- mentation: the slight variations of form found on the surfaces of the Atelier Elvira and the Wolzogen Theater were as calibrated as the entries in Endell's tables. Continuing the Helmholtzian argument about "aesthetic induction," Endell maintained that a judgment drawn from feelings could be as precise as one drawn from thought: Because feelings are considered indescribable, it is assumed that they are somewhat vague and unclear. This is not at all the case. Feelings are absolutely definite, clear and distinct; they do not allow themselves to be expressed in words, num- bers, and metrics, but that does not prove in the least their vagueness. On the contrary, emotional sensation is very often used to substitute judgments used in measuring and count- ing: for example, in bisecting a line, in judging if two angles are parallel, and so on. The so-called "measuring by eye" [AugenmaB) makes it possible to judge relationships of scale through feeling, and one knows how extraordinarily precise this can be. ... And those who have lived among painters and musicians know how well they communicate through inflection, gesture, and so on, despite of the impossibility of an exact description.73 August Endell.

Alexander | Metrics of Experience: August Endell's Phenomenology of Architecture 65</page><page sequence="17">On the one hand, Endell eradicated all that was intellectual from the realm of aesthetic experience so that the relationship between form and affect would be as immediate as Duchenne's electrical currents. On the other hand, he argued that emotions could act as Kennen, ersatz ratiocination. Take the idea of architectural propor- tions: dismissing centuries of architectural theory, Endell taught his students that proportions had to be determined by reference to nothing except unmediated feeling.74 If bodily sensations could be made to measure and count as effectively as the intellect, then the Enlightenment assumption about the dominance of reason over feeling had to be rethought. Emotions, then, contended with rea- son, making an equally valid claim to truth and knowledge. The precision that was usually identified with the operations of the mind could thus be achieved by the expressive yet nonverbal capacities of the body - gestures, inflections, affective poses, pos- tures, and so on. Although such expressive movements could be interpreted as language, the assumption here was that the body was capable of drawing logical conclusions from its movements with- out the aid of verbal language. Why, then, did Endell ultimately rely on nothing but words in his table of emotions? If the musculature of the body could register the intricacy of feeling so much more accurately than the abstrac- tions of the mind, why was every shade of feeling fixed in the table with a word? In theory lived experience might claim as much epis- temological authority as thought and language, but the problem of circularity made visible in Endell's table would become more pro- nounced as Kennen demanded a legitimate place in institutions of knowledge production at the turn of the century. The Disciplinary Project: Design as Propaedeutic Knowledge The same problem of circularity haunted the countless scholarly battles waged at the turn of the century around the problem of clas- sifying emotions. For the likes of the experimental psychologist Wilhelm Wundt (1832-1920), every possible emotion could be summarized as a concise formula consisting of three variables, each denoting an exact value between the extremes of pleasure- displeasure [Lust-Unlust), agitation-inhibition [Erregung-Hemmung], and strain-relaxation [Spannung-Losung].75 For others, such as the empathy theorist Theodor Lipps, lived feeling adamantly resisted being pigeonholed: what differentiated one emotion from another was pure experience, independent of the mediation of thought or language.76 More was at stake in such debates than determining the mechanics of emotional expression. The difference between the positions of these two psychologists - characterized in some circles as the contrast between an analytic, experimental psy- chology [zergliedernde Psychologie) and a descriptive psychology 66 Grey Room 40</page><page sequence="18">[beschreibende Psychologie) anticipating phenomenology - was essentially a disagreement about the disciplinary project of psy- chology.77 Should psychology, considered by many the propaedeutic human science at this historical moment, attempt to explain [Erklaren) deep structures of causality and lawfulness? Or should it commit itself to describing and understanding [Verstehen) surface formations? The various parties disagreed about legitimate methods, forms of explanations, and even about what constituted the proper subject matter of this still protean discipline.78 Psychology, in fact, was the testing case in a larger debate about the demarcation of disciplines at the end of the nineteenth century when German universities were undergoing a process of expan- sion.79 Much ink has been spilled on the nineteenth-century tension between the human sciences [Geisteswissenschaften) - associated with the perceived achievements of classical languages, history, and neohumanistic scholarship - and the natural sciences {Naturwissenschaften), which were frequently given credit for the technological advances that had placed Germany on the world stage of modernity.80 Some historians have traced the philosophi- cal origins of the tension - frequently rehearsed as the opposition between Erklaren versus Verstehen - to Kant and Goethe, but it is generally accepted that the debate gained momentum around the middle of the century, when Helmholtz identified Kennen as a mode of cognition distinct from Wissen.81 Formulating the task of psychology while avoiding positivism became central to this debate about the organization of the disciplines: Did psychology belong with the natural or the human sciences? For Wundt, psy- chology was the bridge between the two; according to neo- Kantians, the natural sciences and the human sciences were so incommensurable that psychology was better off aligning itself with the former.82 Endell's table was a particular response to the epistemological quandary of the disciplines at the turn of the century. The table classified lived feeling with a mathematical precision associated with the natural sciences. Yet in his writings Endell promised that this rigorous science of emotive effects would be the new foundation for the human sciences. Endell's solution was neither Wundtian nor neo-Kantian, nor did it subscribe to the positivistic formula of using the natural sciences as the paradigm for all disciplines. The table was closest in its ambitions to the disciplinary project theorized for the human sciences by the philosopher Dilthey, who argued that if the natural sciences rested on mathematics and experimentation, the human sciences needed to be reestablished on the foundation of lived human experience.83 By taking into account intentionality, the capacity of the mind to direct itself on things, this descriptive and protophenomenological version of psychology should recog- Alexander | Metrics of Experience: August Endell's Phenomenology of Architecture 67</page><page sequence="19">nize the world as a value-laden place (rather than as abstract and devoid of feeling) and would replace the abstract methodology of the natural sciences with an analytic counterpart. Although Dilthey's ideas - especially the hermeneutic method he elaborated in his later writings - would be assimilated into twentieth-century phenomenology, his solution to the question of the disciplines would ultimately lose to the neo-Kantians' call for methodological autonomy.84 That modern design education emerged at this moment of disci- plinary soul-searching as a new field predicated on psychophysics is no coincidence. With the exception of a few disciplines such as formalist art history, Kennen failed at staking as prominent a place for itself in the disciplinary structures of the university as its theo- rists had anticipated. Instead it prospered in other sites, including secondary schools and newly established and expanded public museums, which shared a liberal commitment to the education of the modern subject. Kennen did particularly well in a new type of educational establishment whose examples appeared throughout Germany at the end of the century: the independent art schools directed by such artists as van de Velde, Peter Behrens (1868-1940), and Vasily Kandinsky (1866-1944). 85 Distancing themselves from traditional forms of art and architectural education - offered at fine arts academies, the applied arts schools, and the technical univer- sities - these schools became laboratories for the otherwise unreal- izable project of transforming Kennen into systematic knowledge. The fact that the new art schools had an unusually high percentage of women students (who until the Weimar era would not be given full admission to the academies) made it easier to imagine the schools as experimental endeavors: an alternative kind of knowl- edge developed for alternative subjects.86 A spontaneous method of drawing, assumed to be informed less by the intellectual operations of the mind and more by the unmediated movements of the body, almost always played a central role in the curricula of these schools. Hence, Adolf Holzel urged his students to start each day with 1,000 mindless pencil strokes, Lothar von Kunowski devised drawing drills to train the rhythm of hand movements, and Johannes Itten began his classes with breathing exercises and experimented with ambidextrous drawing in order to overcome the mind's involvement in the creative process.87 Endell founded his own Schule fur Formkunst in Berlin in 1904, following the example of the much more popular Debschitz School, established in Munich in 1902 by Obrist and Debschitz. A prospec- tus from 1906 explained that the school provided "systematic instruction for independent design [Entwerfen) in the applied arts and architecture."88 Although art education may appear to be an oxymoron, Endell explained, students could be taught a sense for 68 Grey Room 40</page><page sequence="20">Ambidextrous drawing exercise from the Johannes Itten School, Berlin, ca. 1931. form and color without resorting to academic pedagogical prac- tices. The first year of the curriculum was a "general theory of form" [allgemeine Formenlehre), consisting of three sections taught consecutively: study of nature, two-dimensional forms, and, finally, spatial forms. During the second and third years the students con- cerned themselves with applied form rather than pure form, but the three-tiered structure of the first year remained in place. When Endell became the director of the Akademie fur Kunst und Kunstgewerbe in Breslau in 1918, he altered the existing curricu- lum so that it would have a similarly three-tiered structure - in this case consisting of Vorklasse, Grundunterricht, and Fachunterricht.89 The Formschule was true to its name: the three-year curriculum did not attempt to cultivate sophisticated representational techniques, Endell explained, but instead developed the students' ability to understand and manipulate forms. Nowhere did Endell's ambition of establishing a rigorous propaedeutic discipline predicated on emotive effects come as close to fruition as in the basic design course inaugurated at the new art schools, the most famous of which was the Bauhaus. Developed under different names (including Elementarunterricht, Vorklasse, Vorkurs, and Vorlehre), the basic design course strove to convert bodily sensations into systematic knowledge as Helmholtz had predicted.90 The difference between modern design education and academic precedents was an epistemological one: the former was predicated on lived experience, whereas the latter was based on the principle of acquiring cumulative knowledge. Training to be an artist or an architect at the new schools was no longer a matter of learning about past art or mastering techniques specific to a certain medium. Dismissing such knowledge as obsolete, these schools promoted the idea that creative activity required under- standing and managing the body's response to forms.91 Early- Alexander | Metrics of Experience: August Endell's Phenomenology of Architecture 69</page><page sequence="21">twentieth-century design education, like late-nineteenth-century psychology, was transdisciplinary: dismissing the conventional boundaries between the applied and the fine arts as well as between media, materials, and techniques, it sought to cultivate a universal language of form that claimed to liberate the creative forces of the modern subject. The basic design course thereby encouraged an experimentalism that was at odds with notions of expertise and specialization. Hence, the calls for the fusion of the arts at the Bauhaus, which inherited many of its pedagogical prac- tices from turn-of-the-century independent art schools.92 One could argue that much as nineteenth-century neohumanistic Bildunghad been the ideal form of education for the post-Kantian subject, so was design education the appropriate training for the suggestible subject of the twentieth century. If the basic design course formed the transdisciplinary first step of design pedagogy, architecture was frequently imagined to be its ultimate fulfillment. In Berlin Endell reserved the most advanced studios of the school for architecture, whereas in Breslau he battled with the city to earn his students the right to take the state exam for architecture upon graduation.93 The idea that architecture occu- pied a unique place among the arts had been articulated before, but the idea gained new urgency around 1900. Architecture's new- found importance at this moment had as much to do with earlier ideas about Gesamtkunstwerk as with the centrality of the idea of environment in the constitution of the modern subject.94 Architecture became a testing ground not only for the cultivation of this subject but also, according to Endell, for the development of an overarching science of lived experience. Formalism posited space [Raum) as the decisive final step in design education: at turn- of-the-century schools, at the Bauhaus, and at schools that subse- quently followed Bauhaus pedagogy. Although the 1919 Bauhaus manifesto began with the declaration that the ultimate aim of all creative activity was building [bauen and Baukunsf), the Bauhaus did not have an official architecture workshop until 1927. The cen- ter in the iconic circular diagram demonstrating the curriculum of the school, in other words, was initially void. Architecture appeared in this phase of mod- ern design education not as a specialization among others but as a metadiscipline - less as a field in which to cultivate expertise and more an ideal to be achieved. Even when successfully incorporated into these new institutions, however, Kennen remained an unstable form of knowledge. This inherent instability was particularly pro- nounced in architecture's own epistemological Diagram showing the curriculum of the Bauhaus, ca. 1922. 70 Grey Room 40</page><page sequence="22">organ, architectural theory.95 By favoring lived experience over theoretical knowledge, the new pedagogy of design forced architec- tural theory into a precarious position. The problem of circularity familiar from late-nineteenth-century discussions of emotions now haunted architectural theory too: how to theorize something as elu- sive as lived experience? Could sensations indiscriminately hitting the human body be construed as systematic knowledge in the absence of conceptual constructs? If, as Endell urged, architectural discourses were to be purged of all concepts that had dominated them since Alberti - concepts such as character and convenance as well as theories of orders and proportions - architectural theory would have to operate in a self-referential manner. Ultimately, Kennen thrived within design pedagogy not as a form of theoretical knowledge, as its early theorists had speculated, but as the knowl- edge of practice. According to Endell's description, design was a matter of practice, habit, and exercise: I take an orchid, I change the proportions and observe how the effect [Wirkung] changes. I make the blossom smooth or rough, I accentuate the filaments or make them vanish, I make the bulbs round or skinny. I free the blossom from its stem and conceive it as a loose entity, make cellular shapes on the bulbs, cover the body with dots or decorate it with parallel stripes, dissolve the stripes in the dots again, and etc., etc.96 Design training, Endell explained, consisted of a series of methodical exercises in which forms were systematically broken down to their components, reassembled, and transformed. Such exercises were predicated on what Helmholtz had called "aesthetic induction": the body learned to draw conclusions from its move- ments without recourse to the mind. While normative terms such as character and convenance disappeared from architectural dis- courses, the body's physiological response to forms was quietly becoming the new norm. Design pedagogy asked its students to exert their bodies in a circuit of stimulus and response. Like early experimental psychologists who experimented on themselves, design students had to learn to observe and register their own bodies' reflexlike response to lines, forms, and colors in an endless cycle of formal manipulation. From the sketching exercises at Endell's Formschule to the Vorkurs at the Bauhaus and the nine-square-grid problem assigned at American architecture schools half a century later, the logic of formalism would become second nature to any student disciplined with design education in the twentieth century. The circularity inherent in an aesthetics predicated on psycho- physics was recognized as early as 1892 by none other than Dilthey, who warned, "the immediacy and simplicity of the impression is a psychological illusion."97 Without historical and sociological con- Alexander | Metrics of Experience: August Endell's Phenomenology of Architecture 71</page><page sequence="23">siderations, Dilthey wrote in this prescient essay, every analysis of aesthetic effects was destined to be locked in a vicious circle of self- referentiality.98 At the end of the First World War, those who had subscribed to experimental aesthetics two decades earlier agreed with Dilthey." Even the most passionate theorists of psychological aesthetics now argued that the future of German aesthetics depended on its ability to free itself from the weight of psychology.100 By the time Hannes Meyer published an architectural word- poem of his own in 1928, Endell's metrics of experience seemed entirely obsolete. Meyer's table, like Endell's of thirty years earlier, was made up of nothing but words graphically arranged on the page without syntax. But Meyer emphatically dismissed the role that psychological effects might play in architecture: instead of "subjective" feelings, Meyer's table listed "objective" building materials. Published in the Bauhaus journal during Meyer's first year as director of the school, the table was part of a graphic essay titled "Bauen," where Meyer declared polemically that architecture was the product of the simple formula function x economy.101 Unlike Endell's table of adjectives, Meyer's table was made up of nouns: from reinforced concrete to rubber, this version of the architectural table enumerated man-made materials that technology had recently made available to architecture. Endell's table had appeared at a moment when the formalistic vocabulary of form and space had begun replacing the normative terms of academic architectural the- ory. Meyer now proposed DIN [Deutsches Institut fur Normung) standards, prepared by German technocrats, as the new norm for architecture. Modern architecture was to be the montage of build- ing materials according to the biological requirements of life, which Meyer listed in another table in his essay. Should Meyer's table then be read as the antithesis of Endell's? Meyer's brief yet controversial tenure at the Bauhaus came at the 72 Grey Room 40</page><page sequence="24">end of a period of major transition in design education. Much has been written about this shift in the school's history: from the early Bauhaus infatuated with mystical ideas to the later one which was strategically aligned with technology and mass production.102 Furthermore, under intense pressure in an increasingly polarized political environment, the school moved from Weimar to Dessau in 1925 and was incorporated into the German university system as the Hochschule fur Gestaltung a year later. The disciplinary pat- terns developing at German universities were becoming apparent at the Bauhaus as well. Although the transdisciplinary Vorkurs would maintain its centrality at the school for a few more years, with the establishment of a separate architecture workshop in 1927, architecture was no longer the ideal center of the school's curriculum but one workshop among others.103 Disciplined expert knowledge gained currency as the boundaries between the work- shops of the school became more pronounced. Transdisciplinarity was giving way to interdisciplinarity: specialists from other disci- plines were routinely invited by Meyer to offer their expertise at the school. By the time Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, the next director, had modified the Bauhaus program, Vorkurs was no longer manda- tory, and the curriculum instead placed more emphasis on archi- tectural training.104 Yet, Meyer's table did not so much negate Endell's table as recon- figure it under a new disciplinary regime. Neither Meyer's techno- cratic functionalism nor Mies's promotion of architectural specialization spelled the end of bodily knowledge within archi- tectural discourses after all. Modern design education had started out in the early twentieth century with protophenomenological faith in the epistemological validity of lived experience. Even after Below: Diagram showing the curriculum of the Bauhaus, 1927. Opposite: Hannes Meyer. "Bauen," in Bauhaus: Zeitschrift fur Gestaltung 2, no. 4 (1928). Alexander | Metrics of Experience: August Endell's Phenomenology of Architecture 73</page><page sequence="25">Kennen had lost its credibility elsewhere, it survived within archi- tectural pedagogy - not only in such concepts as space {Raum), which would arguably configure architecture's ethical function in the twentieth century, but also in the everyday practices of the design studio. Decades after psychophysics had become obsolete, architecture students around the world would be trained through formal manipulation, which, it would be assumed, was the best preparation for the task of shaping spaces and their occupants. Juxtaposing, rotating, reversing, superimposing, and transforming forms, they would be producing an unusual form of knowledge unlike that in the humanities, social, or natural sciences. The sur- vival of these practices may help explain architecture's peculiar disciplinarity today: on the one hand, a misfit in the highly demar- cated structure of academic disciplines; on the other hand, a rare open field amenable to unorthodox forms of exploration not possi- ble elsewhere at the university.

Theodor Lipps taught philosophy and psychology with an emphasis on logic, ethics, and aesthetics at the Lud wig-Maximilian University in Munich. His most important contribution to psychological aesthetics was his elaboration of empathy {Einfuhlung) theory. The Psychological Institute, which he founded in Munich in 1896, was quite different from Wilhelm Wundt's institute, founded in Leipzig in 1879. Lipps is often credited for having been a significant influence on the Munich phenomenologists. Among Lipps's publications are Grundtatsachen des Seelenlebens (1883), Asthetische Faktoren der Raumanschauung (1891), Raumasthetik und Geometrisch-Optische Tauschungen (1893), Das Selbstbewusstsein: Empfindung und Gefuhl (1901), Asthetik: Psychologie des Schonen und derKunst (1903), Leitfaden der Psychologie (1903), and Zur Einfuhlung (1913). Although Lipps was Endell's teacher, they were not as close as is sometimes assumed. Endell admitted to having departed on occasion from the teachings of Lipps.

Rumors about Endell's sexuality were spread by his first wife Elsa Hildegard Plotz, who after remarrying became known as the dadaist artist and poet Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven. 33. These were the distinguishing marks of what historians have called the "post-Kantian self." My discussion of the history of selfhood in this essay is informed by Jan Goldstein, The Post-Revolutionary Self: Politics and Psyche in France, 1750-1850 (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2005); Jan Goldstein, "Foucault and the Post-Revolutionary Self: The Uses of Cousinian Pedagogy in Nineteenth-Century France," in Foucault and the Writing of History, ed.

Johann Caspar Lavater, Physiognomische Fragmente zur Beforderung der Menschenkenntniss und Menschenliebe (1775-1778). In revolutionary Europe where social volatility was the source of much anxiety, physiognomy promised to bridge the gap between essences and appearances by referring ambiguous, super- ficial clues to an unequivocal innate character. Judith Wechsler illustrates, for example, that the rise of caricature in Paris had to do with the flooding of the city with people from different places.

William James suggested that bodily states were not simply the "expression," "manifestation," or "natural language" of emotions but were constitutive of them. See William James, "What Is an Emotion?" Mind 9, no. 34 (April 1884): 188-205. Following this logic, George Herbert Mead would later assert that "we find no evidence for the prior existence of consciousness as something which brings about behavior on the part of one organism that is of such a sort to call forth an adjustive response on the part of another organism, without itself being dependent on such behavior. We are rather forced to conclude that consciousness is an emergent from such behavior; that so far from being a precondition of the social act, the social act is the precon- dition of it." George H.

A group of German intellectuals who were part of the so-called film reform movement [Kinoreformbewegung] purported to protect film audiences against the influence of the moving image by instituting censorship laws in the early twentieth century.

A few years before Endell's text was published, Walther Rathenau had argued that Berlin lacked not only natural and man-made beauties but also an overall image as a metropolis. Schinkel's Athens on the Spree was dead, Rathenau declared; Chicago on the Spree, guided only by the desire for materialistic gain, was emerging instead. Soon Karl Scheffler declared Berlin to be not only the ugli- est city in Germany but "the capital of all modern ugliness."

The clearest expression of Lipps's theory is given in Theodor Lipps, "Gefiihlsqualitaten," Psychologische Untersuchungen 2, no. 1 (1912): 81-110. Endell wanted to "begin with the modern direction in psychology . . . the one which is opposed to Wundt and which centers around the periodical Psychologie und Physiologie der Sinnesorgane. I need not play the hypocrite with Lipps. I take, in part, a different position. But furthermore, I can learn a great deal from him." Endell to Breysig, 16 November 1894, in K.5. 79-82, BN-SB. 77. The opposition was coined by the Austrian philosopher Franz Brentano (1838-1917) in the late 1880s and found its way into the work of many theorists who speculated about psychology during this historical moment. Brentano dis- cussed "descriptive psychology" (alternatively, "phenomenology") as a necessary prelude to its causally oriented counterpart "genetic psychology." See Franz Brentano, Descriptive Psychology (1888-1889), trans. B. Miiller (London: Routledge, 1982).
