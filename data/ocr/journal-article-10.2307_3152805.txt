<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY these statistics aside as indicating mere numerical increase, and as not touching the heart of the matter, then Mr. Gulick is prepared, in the second division of his subject, to show that the growth in the compre- hension of Christianity is quite as remarkable as the growth in num- bers. If objectors still insist that numbers count for little when we are judging of the advance or decadence of vital religion, and that even an increasing intellectual acquaintance with Christian truth is no certain sign of its growing power in the earth, then Mr. Gulick is ready, in his third division, to show, in a great variety of convincing ways, that Christians are not only knowing more, but that they are also living better, than ever before. Not only are their philosophy and theology better, their character and conduct are also better. There is a growing knowledge of the plan and purpose of Christ, and there is likewise a growing realization of his plan and purpose in conse- crated, useful lives. The last refuge of objectors is removed when Mr. Gulick, in the fourth division, adds the growth in influence to the growth in numbers, in comprehension, and in practice. The influence of Christ's spirit and teaching on the unsaved world is increasingly profound and far-reaching. Doubting and desponding saints would do well to revive their drooping spirits by a thoughtful reading of these suggestive pages. ERI B. HULBERT. THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO. RELIGION FOR TODAY. By MINOT J. SAVAGE. Boston: G. H. Ellis, I897. Pp. 250. Cloth, $i. THE characteristics of Dr. Savage's thought and style are already so familiar that it would be superfluous to describe them at length. Utterly fearless in thought and frank in utterance, he is one of the important forces that are now shaping popular religious thought in America. We cannot help respecting a man who gives us clearly and unequivocally his entire thought upon any religious topic, whether it win our acceptance or not. Dr. Savage keeps nothing back, and never for a single instance is his meaning in doubt. Perhaps it is in this very definiteness and sharp-edgedness that both the strength and the weakness of his thought are to be found. Many evangelical believers would object stoutly to his statements of their belief, and undoubtedly, in many instances, the exception would be well taken. Certainly a belief that after the crucifixion Christ suffered in hell all the pangs that 460</page><page sequence="2">RECENT THEOLOGICAL LITERATURE those who were to be saved would have suffered through all eternity (p. 19) has formed no part of authorized Romish or Protestant belief. Neither does it seem quite accurate to say that in early Christian belief the dead went down into the under-world, there to remain till the day of resurrection. Paul, at any rate, believed that to be absent from the body was to be present with the Lord, who certainly was in the heavens and not under the earth. In other and more important respects also Dr. Savage does not describe accurately the present belief of most evangel- ica churches, but he has a valid excuse. In the last political campaign the silver men found an effective answer to Republican orators in the statements of the Republican platform, for why should an attempt be made to secure international bimetallism unless there were a grievance to be remedied? Similarly, Dr. Savage quotes the unrepealed confessions of the church as authority for present belief and urges that, if these things are no longer believed, they should be promptly removed from the sol- emn and official declarations of faith. The unrescinded but unbelieved creeds of Christendom give critics like Dr. Savage a precious coigne of vantage. Yet may not his own belief give a partial answer to his criticisms? To his mind the old theology and the new lie over against each other, like products of specific creation with an out-and-out definite- ness, but the doctrine of evolution of which Dr. Savage was one of the earliest, as he has always been one of the most prominent, clerical defend- ers leads us to expect imperceptible gradations and slowly accumulating variations. Popularly, at any rate, the change from old thought to new is always slow and cumulative, and the doctrine of special creation is as exceptionable in theology as in science. The creative germ of Dr. Savage's thought is that the new and larger science demands a new and larger theology to match it. The vastness of the known universe forbids us to regard the history of this planet as more than a single scene or episode in the great cosmic drama; the stage is too small for the supposed divine enacting. Moreover, the scientific story of man's life on earth, teaching the ascent instead of the fall of man, makes unnecessary the whole supernatural scheme, based, as Dr. Savage teaches, upon the Genesis story, and, by inspiring faith in the immanent God, renders the naturalness of religion not only possi- ble, but inevitable. Hence in the natural order of the material universe and of humanity is God's progressive revelation. The protest is against the particularism of the old theology, against its denials rather than its affirmations. In this respect his book will be especially useful to those who suppose that modern liberalism is merely a system of negations. 46I</page><page sequence="3">THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF THEOLOGY Those who have followed Dr. Savage's intellectual career know that for many years he has been especially interested in the doctrine of immortality as affected by psychic research. In this volume he reiter- ates his assurance of immortality as demonstrable from the facts estab- lished by psychical investigation. These considerations have led him to believe also in the credibility of the gospel narratives of the resurrec- tion of Jesus. The body did not leave the grave, but the disciples did see and talk with their Lord; and this, continues Dr. Savage, "I can believe, because I believe that similar things have happened in the modern world." These sermons were preached extemporaneously and written out from stenographic notes. Naturally, therefore, they have the merits and defects of such a method. A careful reader will notice trifling inaccuracies, which more careful revision would have removed; but in tone and spirit the book is admirable and should be carefully read by whoever wishes to understand the nature and tendency of the modern "liberal movement."

GUYAU'S L'Irreligion de l'avenir is a natural outgrowth of his Esquisse daune morale sans obligation ni sanction. The two titles are mutually significant. The volume under consideration attempts to show, first, that religion must inevitably disappear, and, second, that it will be replaced by an even more socially useful system of control. Religion is declared to be fundamentally social in its origin and principles. Anthropomorphism should be expanded into socio- morphism. Primitive men conceive a society composed both of men and of gods, between whom relations of friendship and enmity exist. Worship is the influencing-often the bribing-of powerful though invisible associates. Again, religion is primarily a system of physics -an explanation of phenomena. Religious physics gradually gives place to religious metaphysics, to animism, to a spiritualistic concep- tion, to dualism, to monism. Religious morality, it is further asserted, "grows out of the laws which regulate the social relations between gods and men." Religion, being sociomorphic, really gets its morality 462</page></plain_text>
