<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Spirit of Man in Asian Art. By LAURENCE BINYON. Cam- bridge, Mass.: HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS, 1935. Pp. xvi + 217, with 70 plates. Mr. Binyon's collection of five lectures, accompanied by a large number of wisely selected illustrations, provides what is undoubtedly for the general reader the best available introduction to the inner life of Asiatic peoples as it has found expression in art. It is the work of a poet, perfect in its kind: by sheer sensibility and without reference to the literary sources of Asiatic aesthetic the author has rightly grasped the religious, if not entirely the metaphysical, essence of Asiatic art, and has known how to communicate this spirit in words that have a beauty of their own. He speaks truly when he refers to " a flowering of the mind in form . . . making what are called aesthetic necessities appear as almost irrelevant externality." "It is rather hard for us," he says pathetically, " used to the practice of painting from nature with the eye on the object, to realise what intensity of contemplation preceded the actual throwing of the preconceived design with swift immediate strokes upon the absorbent silk or paper" (p. 92); "He (the 1 It may be remarked in this connection that in Rig Veda IV. 18. 1-2 Indra, who takes birth in the same manner par~vdt, already refers to this as "the pathway found of old"; and that like the Buddha's, and in fact for the same reasons, his mother does not survive.</page><page sequence="2">326 Reviews of Books landscape-painter) must identify himself with what he paints, be- come what he contemplates, before he can express it truly " (p. 97). These remarks might have been related to the European approach by a citation of Eckhart's, " To be properly expressed, a thing must proceed from within, moved by its form," and Dante's, " He who would portray a figure, if he cannot be it, cannot represent it." For mediaeval Christian and Asiatic art have actually a common level of reference and both are languages independent of observa- tion; beauty for both is linked more closely to cognition than to feeling. Repeatedly the author deduces from an analysis of the paintings themselves what is really explicit in the artist's ascertained ways of operation. For example, " Neither do these artists shrink from the vastness of empty space. They discover in it their own libera- tion " (p. 98); this might have been based upon the actual Sadhanas, in which we find it constantly enjoined that the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas (mentally evoked from a primordial concept of sound expressed within the heart, cf. St. Thomas' " per verbum in intellectu conceptum," said with reference to the interior operation of the artist) " are to be established on the background of space " (dk&amp;s'ades'e); nor is this an external and dimensioned space to be delimited in terms of a scientific perspective, but an unconditioned principle of space within us. Problems of optical plausibility do not arise. The represented figure is the affirmation of an infinite negation, and this latter is the matter of ultimate significance, liberation being from the limited existence that belongs to any spe- cific manifestation. And this leads us to an ultimate consideration hardly touched upon in the volume before us, that implied in the fundamental proposition of the Lahkavatara Sidzra, that " the pic- ture is not in the colors, the principle evades the letter." Further- more, the picture that is not in the colors is not itself the picture of any thing, but only the indication of a principle; the function of the work of art is not fulfilled merely by an assimilation of our consciousness to its ethical refinement, but only when the form of our being has been enlarged in conscious identity with the imma- terial and strictly speaking non-existent principle that lies at the core of being and to which the image refers. When that has been touched, the function of the picture has been accomplished, and this is what is really implied by the Zen dictum that all scripture is vain. It is not enough to frame the absolute in words or forms;</page><page sequence="3">Reviews of Books 327 it must be directly experienced. Mr. Binyon need not fear that he has " talked too much about the world of ideas in which they (these works of art) were born ": he speaks of the " unreality of all but thought," but we must also remember that all this art, the Buddhist art in particular, whether hieratic or Zen, has ultimate reference to the experience of a reality beyond the unreality of thought itself. Sometimes the author seems to have personal experience of a characteristically Asiatic type. For example: " On a summer night, driving in an automobile, have you not sometimes been startled and thrilled by the apparition of wayside flowers and grasses suddenly isolated and luminous in the beams of the head- lamps? A moment ago there was darkness. .. . Can they really have been there in the dark, with all their intricate profusion of form and color? You feel as if they had been suddenly created for you yourself " (p. 134). Does not this correspond essentially to Rig Veda V. 81. 2, where the Sun as maker (kavi, "poet" in the original sense of the Greek word as " creator ") sets free the varied likenesses, or all the beauties, of things (vissv rupani prati muficate) "? The Chinese Dragon has always been for the author a favorite theme; the reader will recall The Flight of the Dragon. We think him right when he connects the Dragon with the Tao concept; not that the tao in tao t'ieh, the dragon-mask on Chinese bronzes, has any connection so far as the characters are concerned with Tao as " Way," but that, as he rightly remarks, the Dragon, which repre- sents in Western thought the power of evil, is from the Chinese point of view on the whole a beneficent power, in any case a mar- vellous and splendid power, as being the protean source of all life, the source alike of life and death. For the typically objectively oriented consciousness the power of death is evil; but there is another point of view according to which all that we call life is no more than the wandering of a prodigal son. As Chuang Tzui ex- presses it, " How do I know that he who dreads to die is not as a child who has lost the way and cannot find his home?" Many religions, the majority perhaps, have conceived the form of deity ab intra in the likeness of a serpent or dragon of protean versa- tility, and only ab extra in angelic or anthropomorphic forms. As soon as the dualistic and existential point of view is assumed, the Powers of Light (Solar Hero) and Powers of Darkness (Dragon)</page><page sequence="4">328 Reviews of Books are seen in clear-cut opposition; the Son is set over against the uncanny Father. It is a special characteristic of Chinese meta- physics to have dwelt rather upon the thought of this unitary source or Father than upon that of a manifested and intelligible Son; and this, whether consciously or by unconscious necessity, is reflected in the persistent attachment to the dragon symbol proper to Chinese culture. Considerations of this sort are by no means, as might at first sight appear, irrelevant to the appreciation of art even in its aesthetic aspects. The serpent-dragon plays, for ex- ample, a no less significant part in Mayan art, and Spinden remarks that " the high esthetic qualities [of Mayan art] were wasted on subjects that appear trivial to us"; while as he himself realizes, " When we can bring ourselves to feel the serpent symbolism of the Mayan artists as we feel, for instance, the conventional halo that crowns the ideal head of Christ, then we shall be able to recognize the truly emotional qualities of Mayan sculpture.... The serpent . . .appears as a general indication of divinity." 1 Mr. Binyon's references to Rajput painting are sympathetic and felicitous. But we think him wrong in saying that " it is mainly concerned with everyday life ... the world they represent is small and circumscribed compared with the world of the Japanese wood- cuts" (pp. 192, 195). He seems to think; of the "mystic" (or rather metaphysical) significance of Rajput paintings as of some- thing imported into their interpretation. But whereas the Ukiyoye prints are really " pictures of the transient world," and were under- stood by the Japanese themselves to be such, the Krishna paintings were never in the same sense understood to have been representa- tions of pastoral life made merely as such; just as the Vedic liturgies, pungent with the scent of cow-sheds, were never conceived to have been merely the lyrical expressions of primitive ranchers. It has been universally understood, and explicitly stated by some com- mentators, that the Krishna legend is not historical but has to do with the relation of the human soul to deity; and while because of its vulgar associations the Japanese print had no appeal for the connoisseur or philosopher, the Rajput painting appealed as much to the connoisseur, the poet, and the metaphysician and theologian as to the countryman, so that we cannot apply the designation " popular " to both kinds of art in the same sense. 1 The Civilisation of Mexico, 1928, pp. 89, 95, 98.</page><page sequence="5">Reviews of Books 329 The volume is in every respect well produced.
