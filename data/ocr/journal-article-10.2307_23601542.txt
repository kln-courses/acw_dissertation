<plain_text><page sequence="1">MAIMONIDES By Solomon Zeitlin The world-wide celebration of the Octocentenary of the birth of Moses Maimonides affords us the opportunity of revaluating the life and works of one of the greatest minds produced by Judaism since the close of the Talmud. No one else has had such profound influence upon Jewish life. Again, no Hebrew scholar has aroused such controversy which actually divided the Jewish people into two hostile camps. New information, made available by the researches of modern scholarship, supplies us with material better to envisage him in the wider context of his times. Great talmudist, thinker, jurist, and leader, he assumes the proportion of a statesman who sought, through a tern pestuous era of persecution and intellectual and social change, to direct constructively the destiny of the Jewish people. The broad similarity between our own times and the troubled Jewish world of the later twelfth century, deepens our practical interest in the part he played as guide to a perplexed generation. It may be that this approximate identity of experience between the present and the past is the unconscious motivation that has spontaneously and eagerly turned the mind of the Jewish people to Maimonides that we might be helped to learn from his leadership the secret of Jewish survival. I.I. Moses ben Maimun, later known as Maimonides and Rambam (the letters r, m, b, m, being the initials of Rabbi Moses ben Maimun) was born in the city of Cordova, in the southern part of Spain on the eve of Passover, the fourteenth day of Nisan, 4895, (March 30, 1135 c. E.). He was a descendant of an illustrious family which for many generations had occupied a very important place in the Spanish Jewish community. 61</page><page sequence="2">62 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK His father was a scholar who had the title of dayyan (judge), and was a pupil of the well-known Rabbi Joseph ibn Migas, the successor of the famous scholar, Isaac Alfasi. The young Moses received his early education in the usual manner of those days. Undoubtedly his father was the chief instructor of this promising boy. In 1148, when he was yet a lad of thirteen, the city of Cordova was captured by the Almohades (the Puritans), a fanatical sect of Islam. The Almohades did not tolerate any other religion beside their own. They destroyed syn agogues and churches, and Jews and Christians alike had to choose between Islam or exile. Those who did not emigrate but continued to live as Jews were unmercifully persecuted. Many Jews fled with their belongings from southern Spain, some going to the northern part which was Christian, others to the Provence, France. Some of them accepted the religion of Mohammed openly, but secretly continued to live as Jews and observe the Jewish precepts. Still others, however, did not declare themselves as Moslems but dis guised themselves in the dress of the natives so as not to be conspicuous as Jews. Among these latter were Maimun and his family. It was not difficult for them to use this disguise as Arabs, for the turbans they wore were similar to the Mohammedan head-gear, and they spoke Arabic perfectly. Continually exposed to the danger of detection, they could, however, not stay in one city any length of time and, therefore, they traveled from place to place. The education of the lad, Moses, nevertheless, was not neglected by his father. In this period, though no Jewish schools, Yeshivot (places of learning), or synagogues existed, Moses continued his Jewish studies and occupied himself in research work. He pursued his secular studies, par ticularly philosophy, with great success. He studied with the pupils of the famous philosopher, Abu Bekr ibn Alzaig, and was also friendly with the son of ibn Aflah of Seville. Already at this time he compiled commentaries on a few tractates of the Talmud, and wrote an essay on the Jewish calendar and a short treatise on logical terms, Millot Higgayon.Higgayon. Such youthful authorship showed that Moses ben Maimun, still in his early twenties, was a mature</page><page sequence="3">MAIMONIDESMAIMONIDES 63 scholar, not only in talmudic law but also in mathematics and Aristotelian philosophy as well. He also displayed an effective and remarkably lucid style. In 1158, when he was twenty-three years of age, he began to write his well-known commentary on the Mishna in the Arabic language, but in Hebrew characters. He gave it the title "Siraj" which in Hebrew is "Mabr" (Luminary). In the following year, Maimun and his family left Spain for Morocco. This migration of Maimun and his family to Morocco has led many scholars to believe that they had officially accepted the Mohammedan religion and considered them selves Moslems. They were classified as Anusim, proselytes {force{force majeure). This theory has been strengthened by the fact that, after Maimonides had settled in Egypt and occupied a high position there, an Arab, Abul Arab ibn Moisha, informed the authorities that Maimonides had been a Moslem while in Morocco. Others, however, deny that Maimonides accepted the religion of Islam, or ever lived as a Moslem. They point out that at no time could he have been a Moslem, for never did his opponents, even in the heat of the controversies against him, accuse him of being an apostate. However, both of these theories are untenable. The elder Maimun never officially accepted Islam; he and his family simply disguised themselves as Arabs and thus deceived the authorities and avoided persecution. They tried to remain at home where they could observe the Law. They mingled very little with the people in order not to attract too much attention. It was a common occurrence for Jews to disguise themselves in times of persecution. In Germany, for instance, during the period of the Crusaders, to save themselves from persecution, many Jews adopted disguises by wearing the garments of the Christians. Some went so far as to wear a cross as a means of protection. The charge of Abul Arab ibn Moisha that Maimonides had been a.Moslem was apparently based on his recollections of Maimonides in Mohammedan dress and probably seeing him entering a Mosque. Even the most bigoted rabbis could never accuse Maimonides of being an apostate. Since he never actually accepted Mohammedanism, but only</page><page sequence="4">64 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK disguised himself to resemble the Moslems, his conduct could not be considered a transgression of Jewish law. It is very probable that the family of Maimun left Spain for Fez for the purpose of aiding Moses, who was then engaged in writing his commentary on the Mishna. He did not have the necessary books in Cordova, nor did any distinguished rabbis live there. Knowing that Rabbi Judah ibn Shoshan, the eminent scholar, was in Fez, and that some Jewish activity was going on there underground, Maimun, and his two sons, Moses and David, left for Morocco. Although the Almohades had destroyed the synagogues and the churches, they interfered little with secular activities. Schools of learning were still in existence in Morocco and were conducted by many scholars proficient in mathematics and medicine. Thus, Maimonides' thirst for knowledge, both talmudic and secular, prompted the family to undertake this adventurous trip. Upon their arrival in Morocco, they found the Jewish community in a deplorable state. Judaism was suppressed, and anyone who dared to observe the Jewish religion was put to death. The persecution of the Jews had already lasted more than a decade, causing many of them to become skeptical and to wonder whether Judaism was the true religion, and whether Islam had not superseded it. They even thought it possible that Mohammed was the true prophet who had come to replace Moses. At that time, a group of émigrés had succeeded in escaping from Morocco. Since they were thus no longer exposed to any danger in practising Judaism, they denounced their co-religionists of Morocco by charging that they were not good Jews, because, for the sake of saving their lives, they had officially accepted Islam. The prayers of these Anusim would find no acceptance before God, these critics held, and it was futile for them to continue following the Jewish precepts secretly. Furthermore, declared the émigrés anyone who accepted a human being as a prophet, even under compulsion, was to be considered a heathen though he fulfill the entire Torah. An epistle expressing this opinion was written by a rabbi who had escaped from Morocco to a foreign country. Upon his arrival in Fez, in 1160, realizing the dangers of the situation, Maimonides composed in</page><page sequence="5">MAIMONIDESMAIMONIDES 65 Arabic a letter called Maamar Kiddush Ha-Shem (A Treatise on the Sanctification of God), better known as IggeretIggeret ha-Schemad (Letter on Apostasy). In this letter, Maimonides bitterly opposed the opinion of such fanatics in reference to the Anusim. He held that such an opinion was not only unjust to the Anusim, but was a gross mis representation of Judaism. He proved from Talmudic ' passages that it was not considered a sin for anyone to disguise himself in times of religious persecution in order to save his life. As precedent, he pointed to Rabbis Meïr and Eliezar who, in the time of persecution by the Romans, had saved their lives by pretending that they were not Jews. Maimonides argued passionately : Would these fanatics consider Rabbi Meïr a non-Jew? Would it not be unjust to designate as heathens, Jews forced to accept Islam, so long as they continued secretly to observe the Jewish law? Rabbi Meïr acted like them and yet did not lose his rabbinic authority. This letter was written by Maimonides when he was not yet thirty years of age. It shows that he felt not only the anguish of the entire Jewish community because of the attack of some fanatics, but voiced also the suffering of his own family. Thus he encouraged the Jews of Morocco to continue their Judaism secretly and thereby saved the entire community. In this strained atmosphere, Maimun's family lived in Fez. Moses ben Maimun continued his work on the Mishna, with the encouragement of Judah ibn Shoshan, the Rabbi of Fez, and also pursued his study of medicine under the guidance of Arabic physicians. Although he observed Jewish law in its entirety, he disguised himself as a native. It is even probable that during the month of Ramadan (ninth month of the Mohammedan year), he joined in the Tarawith prayers. Since he did not consider the Moslems as idolatrous, nor their place of worship a house of idolatry, he could enter a Mosque even during Ramadan, without violating his conscience as a loyal Jew. About the year 1165, Rabbi Judah ibn Shoshan was seized by the Moslems and executed. Maimonides was fearful that he might share the same fate as his friend and teacher. Very likely he had already been caught in the</page><page sequence="6">6666 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK , net of the Almohades, but had been saved from death only by the intervention of his Moslem friend, Abul Arab ibn Moisha. Deciding to flee from the country, he set sail on a Satur day night, the fourth of the month of Iyar, in the year 1165, for Palestine, which was then a Christian country called the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Maimonides' own account of his stormy voyage to the Holy Land gives us interesting glimpses into his personality: "On the evening of the first day of the week, the fourth of the month Iyar, I went to sea, and on Sabbath the tenth of Iyar, of the year 25, we had a dreadful storm; the sea was in a fury and we were in danger of perishing. Then I vowed to keep these two days as complete fast days for myself and my household, and all those connected with me, and to command my children to do the same throughout all their generations ; they should also give charity according to their ability. For myself, I further vowed to remain apart from human intercourse on every 10th of Iyar, to speak to nobody and only to pray and to study, as on that day I saw no one on the sea except the Holy One, praised be His name, so will I see no one and stay with no one on that day in the years to come. On the evening of the first day of the week, the 3rd of Sivan, I landed safely and came to Acco, and by arriving in the land of Israel I escaped persecution. This day I vowed to keep as a day of rejoicing, festivity, and the distribution of charity, for myself and my house throughout all generations." For the first time, he lived in a country under Christian domination. His contact with the Christians evidently did not impress him very favorably. One can readily under stand the reason, for the hands of the Crusaders, who had killed many Jews during the year 1147, were still reeking with the blood of their victims. He regarded the images of Jesus and Mary, and the statues of the saints, before whom the Christians kneeled and prayed, as idols. He, therefore, considered the Christians to be different from the Moslems and put them in the category of idol-worshippers who did not believe in the unity of God. In the short time that he</page><page sequence="7">MAIMONIDESMAIMONIDES 67 was in Acco, he apparently did not associate with the knights and the ministers of the church to learn more about Christianity. Upon leaving the country, there remained with him the impression that Christians were heathens. Even though they believed in the Bible and accepted the five books of Moses as well as the prophets as Holy, inspired by the Divine Spirit, he considered them idolators and so classified them in his Halakic work. He finally decided to leave for Egypt. Before leaving, he undertook a trip to Jerusalem sometime in the autumn of 1165. He also visited Hebron and then turned back to Acco whence he sailed to Alexandria, Egypt. It is very singular that Maimonides does not mention his father at all in the account of his journey from Morocco to Egypt. He writes as if he himself were the head of the family. Is there a likelihood that Maimun, the father of Moses, remained in Palestine or even Morocco? (It is worthy of note that Maimonides never mentioned either his mother or wife in all his writings.) Egypt had a considerable Jewish population at the time of Maimonides' arrival there. Alexandria, Damietta, Bilbeys and Fostat (Old Cairo) had large Jewish com munities. The Egyptian Jews enjoyed religious freedom. The Jewish community possessed autonomy in its internal affairs and was under the leadership of the Nagid (Prince) who represented all the Jews before the government. He had the power to supervise Jewish religious life and to appoint judges. He delegated some of his duties to his subordinate judges, but he had supreme power over the Egyptian Jews. Egypt also had a considerable number of Karaites, a Jewish heretical sect. Not having a Prince of their own, they too came under the supervision of the Nagid. They, however, exerted great influence from time to time upon the orthodox Jews who, on many occasions, adopted Karaite customs. The reason for this influence was probably a a social one, since the Karaites constituted the wealthy class. However, another cause is more likely. The Karaites were also the privileged class in Egypt and were favored by the Fatimids who, being Shiites, the heretic sect of the Moslems, accepted only the written word of Koran and</page><page sequence="8">68 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK rejected tradition, just as the Karaites did with respect to the Bible and the oral tradition. When Maimonides arrived in Egypt, he did not look for a rabbinical position since he greatly disapproved of scholars who Jived by their scholarship and made their learning a source of livelihood. He believed that a scholar should live like the ordinary man, by the toil of his hands, and that the public should never have respect for a scholar or his scholar ship, if he derived his livelihood from his learning. He saw no objection, however, to a learned man investing his money with a partner and sharing the profits. Scholarship, how ever, must never be made a business. Furthermore, being independent by nature, he would not accept a position which would make him a possible pliant tool in the hands of leaders. He was able to continue his scholarly research, because his brother David, who was engaged in the jewelry trade, supported the family. II. In the year 1168, at the age of thirty-three, Maimonides brought to completion his commentary on the Mishna, Siraj,Siraj,Siraj, (the Luminary), which he had begun in 1158 while he was living in Cordova. He had to labor at this com mentary under great hardships during his exile and while traveling in different countries and crossing the sea. He, therefore, begged his readers for leniency in case they found any errors. (See the end of Maimonides' Commentary). The purpose of the Commentary, as he himself said, was to interpret the word as well as the meaning of the Mishna, because, to understand this code one must know the entire Talmud by heart—a task which is practically impossible, particularly when a Halaka is interpreted in different places in the Talmud. Therefore, he found it necessary to interpret the Mishna according to the Talmud. He made an effort also to give the decision of the Law. He next presented an introduction to the student who desired to study the Talmud. Finally, he gave to the reader who was familiar with the Talmud, a ready guide to, and a digest of, it. In this commentary on the Mishna, he presented the Halaka in such a manner as to make it easy for a student</page><page sequence="9">MAIMONIDESMAIMONIDESMAIMONIDES 69 to understand the difficult passages in the Talmud. He wrote introductions to every section of the Mishna, par ticularly to the last, the sixth, Tohorot, in which he described the different laws of purity and impurity, usually con sidered the most complicated laws in the Talmud. In his commentary on the Mishna, Maimonides gave not only the decision of the Halaka as interpreted in the Talmud, but also found occasion for expounding his philos ophy of Judaism. In the tractate Sanhédrin, in the com mentary on the tenth chapter where the Mishna reads, "All Israelites have a share in the Olam Haba" (the future world), he ventures a solution to the questions, "What is the Olam Haba?" and "Who is an Israelite?" After expounding his philosophy on the Future World and presenting his views on the Messiah, the Messianic Age, and Resurrection, he gives his definition of the Israelite who would have a share in the Olam Haba. He formulated thirteen articles of faith which every Jew had to accept. These were : 1. 1. Belief in the existence of a Creator who is .the cause of all creation. 2. Belief in the unity of God. 3. Belief in His incorporeality, for of God no substance could be predicated. 4. Belief that He has no beginning and He is eternal. 5. Belief that He is our Master and that we must worship Him alone. 6. Belief in prophecy. 7. Belief that there was no prophet like Moses and that there never would be another like him. 8. Belief that the Law which was given to Moses on Mount Sinai came in its entirety from God. 9. Belief in the eternity and immutability of the Law. 10. Belief that God knows the acts and ways of man. 11. Belief that God would reward the righteous and punish the wicked. 12. Belief in the coming of Messiah. 13. Belief in the resurrection of the dead.</page><page sequence="10">70 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK Maimonides was the first to formulate thirteen principles of Judaism. In his time, when the Jews lived all over the known globe, and no central authority existed, it was almost presumptuous for a young man to declare that a Jew who does not believe in one of these thirteen principles would not share in the World to Come. Especially bold was his assertion that a Jew who believes that God is corporeal is to be considered a heretic. It is well known that, in his day, many rabbis of great learning held the opinions that God could be conceived as corporeal. Maimonides' theory, which he later incorporated in his Mishne Torah, aroused the ire of many of the great rabbis. His thirteen principles of Judaism were generally accepted, but not without opposition, and later they were included in the synagogue ritual. The well known hymn, Yigdal, which is chanted in many synagogues, is a metrical reading of his thirteen principles. In his introduction to the tractate Abot, which deals with the ethics of the sages, he found occasion to include a special treatise on psychology and ethics, known as the Eight Chapters. In these Eight Chapters, he introduced Hellenistic ideas into Judaism, He based his ethics on the sayings of the sages and on the Aristotelian principles in the Nicomachean Ethics. The commentary on the Mishna was written by Maimon ides in the Arabic language but in Hebrew letters. Some of the introductions were translated into Hebrew during his life-time, but the entire commentary was not translated into Hebrew until the thirteenth century. Some biographers of Maimonides believe that this com mentary is absolutely indispensable for understanding the Mishna. One cannot agree with this opinion. The Mishna may be understood without the commentary of Maimonides, for we have one written by one of the greatest of com mentators, Rashi, who compiled his work a century earlier than Maimonides, and another excellent one by Obadiah of Bertinoro. Maimonides' commentary is valuable chiefly because it renders the decisions of the Law. Without the aid of Maimonides' commentary, the reader could not know these by consulting the־ Mishna alone. He would be compelled to consult the Talmud, not an easy matter since</page><page sequence="11">MAIMONIDESMAIMONIDES 71 it is very complicated. Only a great talmudist, well equipped in rabbinical law, is able to formulate the decision of the Halaka from the Talmud. Moreover, Maimonides' com mentary on the Mishna simplifies the Talmud and makes it more comprehensible. While Maimonides was busy writing his commentary and at the same time was engaged in the study of medicine, Egypt underwent both a scholastic and a political révolu tion. The country was ruled by the Fatimid Caliph who was a Shiite, a heretic. In the year 1171, by the order of Saladin, prayers were offered in the chief Mosque for the health of the Caliph of Bagdad who was a Sunnite, of the orthodox wing. A few days after this scholastic revolution took place, el Adid, the last Caliph of the Fatimid dynasty died, and Saladin became the Viceroy of Egypt. This revolution in the year 1171 induced Maimonides to leave Alexandria for Fostat where he was to remain the rest of his life. There were several reasons for his migration to Fostat. After finishing his commentary on the Mishna, he had intensively studied medicine and other sciences. Fostat was a more suitable place for him since Saladin established schools there for higher learning. His migration may also be explained by economic reasons. The family of Maimonides found it hazardous to conduct their jewelry business with Moslem countries that could be reached only by the Mediterranean Sea, which was no longer safe for Egyptian vessels because the combined fleet of the King of Jerusalem and of his allies could always harass them, particularly since the fleet was besieging Damietta, a short distance from Alexandria. Situated on the Nile and not far from the Red Sea, Cairo was more advantageous for the business interests of Maimonides' family. It is also likely that, being the capital, the place where the women of the Caliph's harem resided, Cairo offered a better market for jewelry than Alexandria. Fostat had also been rebuilt since Saladin had become vizier, and its former inhabitants had returned thither. When Maimonides arrived in Fostat, Zuta was the Nagid. Having obtained his position from Saladin by bribery, and being responsible for the downfall of the• most respected Nagid Samuel, Zuta was hated and opposed by many Jews.</page><page sequence="12">72 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK Maimonides shared this animosity and joined the opposi tion to Zuta. The commentary on the Mishna which Maimonides com pie ted in the year 1168 did not make him renowned as a scholar even among the Jews in the Arabic-speaking coun tries, and he was not yet known to the public at large. But later, through services he performed for the Yemen Jews, he became one of the most respected men among the Jews of Islamic countries. Yemen had come into the possession of the Shiite Mahdi who was as fanatical in his religious convictions as the Almohades in Morocco. He could not tolerate any other religion but his own. He persecuted the Jews, giving them one of two alternatives: to accept Islam, or to leave the country. Many Jews became Moslems. A renegade tried to persuade the rest to accept Mohammed as the true Messiah, saying that there were many allusions to him in the Bible. In this state of affairs, another danger was added. A young man who proclaimed himself to be the forerunner of the Messiah, told the Jews to be in readiness for his appear ance which was to take place shortly, when all their mis fortunes would end. In such a state of affairs, the few leaders of the Jews who remained loyal to Judaism were in despair and, not being able to refute the renegade, sought help elsewhere. Jacob al Fayumi, one of the leaders of the community, carried their mission to Maimonides. A letter of counsel which became known as the "Iggeret Teman" (Letter to the South) and also as "Petach Tikvah" (Gate of Hope) was addressed by Maimonides to the Yemen Jews. In his epistle to the Yemenites, Maimonides told them that he and the entire Jewish community in Egypt were very much grieved that they were persecuted. Jewish suffering, he wrote, was universal, in the East as well as the West. "I do not doubt," he said, "that this period is the one to which our sages referred in which the sufferings precede the advent of the Messiah." The sages had foreseen these sufferings and had prayed to God not to let them live through this interval. The Jews had been persecuted ever since the Torah had been given to them. Jewish persecutions</page><page sequence="13">MAIMONIDESMAIMONIDES 73 could be divided into three categories. First, those of Nebuchadnezzar and Titus who wanted to root out the Jewish religion by destroying the Jewish people. Second, those of the Hellenes and the Persians who sought to abolish the Jewish religion by dispute and argumentation. Third, the sufferings which were more severe than the others and which were inflicted by those who wished to destroy the Jewish nation by creating a new religion similar to the Jewish religion. He advised his fellow-Jews of Yemen not to become dis couraged by persecution which could not last forever. God had already promised Jacob that his children, the Jews, would remain, while the nations who persecuted them would disappear. Then, Maimonides took up the arguments of the renegade, who maintained that the Bible had referred to Mohammed, and refuted them. As to the time when the Messiah would appear, Maimonides said that one could not know this with certainty for the time had not been revealed to any person. He declared, however, that the time of the Messiah would arrive when the Christians and the Moslems would be at the height of their power with their kingdoms spread all over the world, and he was con vinced that the Jews would never have a kingdom of their own. "I have a great and wonderful tradition," Maimon ides said, "which I received from my father, which he received from his father, and this tradition goes back to the beginning of the exile from Jerusalem." The tradition was to the effect that prophecy would again reveal itself in Israel in the year 4976, (1216 c. e.), and there was no doubt that this event would be the forerunner of the coming of the Messiah. Maimonides explained that the cause of the appearance of so many deceivers lay in the fact that the Messianic period was approaching. In sending his epistle to the Jews of Yemen, he begged them to read it in every community to fortify their hearts and to encourage the people. He further suggested to them that they do not disclose his letter to the Moslems as they might inflict severe punish ment upon him. He realized the dangers of writing such a letter but, when so important a request was made of him, he set at naught his personal safety.</page><page sequence="14">74 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK Thus, in this letter, he tried to persuade the Yemenite Jews to remain faithful to Judaism since persecutions would never destroy the Jews; and he showed them that, on the contrary, the oppressors are destroyed, and cited illustra tions from history. The Jews of Yemen followed the advice of Maimonides, uncomplainingly bore their suffering, and remained loyal to the Jewish religion. The persecutions did not last long, for in the year 1174, Turan Shah, the brother of Saladin, conquered Yemen and delivered the Jews from the fanatics. They now enjoyed the same religious freedom as the Jews in Egypt. Economic as well as spiritual conditions changed for the better. Maimonides was now idolized in Yemen; he became the most popular person there. In the daily sanctification prayers (Kaddish) a special prayer was inserted for the welfare of Moses ben Maimun. We may assume that this epistle also gave him great prestige in Egypt, the country of his adoption. The epistle to Yemen presented Maimonides' views on the most important principles of Judaism. He believed that the age when the Jews suffered so painfully throughout the world, in Europe from the Crusaders, in Andalusia from the Almohades, in Morocco, and now in Yemen, was the time of the "Agony of the Messiah." He furthermore held that the conquest of the world by the Cross and the Crescent, heralded the approach of the Messianic Age. One sees from this letter, also, that Maimonides maintained that, before the advent of the Messiah, a prophet who would be a scholar would arise in Palestine. During the year 1174, a great tragedy befell the house hold of Maimonides. This was the death of his beloved brother David, whose success in the jewelry business had enabled Maimonides to engage peacefully in the study of Jewish law and in the sciences. The ship on which David was traveling on the Indian Ocean sank, and David went down with it. All his jewelry and assets, and the money which people had entrusted to him were lost. Maimonides was left penniless. In later years, he described his grief in a letter to Rabbi Japhet of Acco, giving us an insight into his state of mind.</page><page sequence="15">MAIMONIDESMAIMONIDES 75 "In Egypt, I underwent great and severe misfortunes, partly owing to illness and loss of property and partly owing to informers who were scheming to kill me, but the greatest misfortune which finally befell me caused me more grief that anything I heretofore suffered, that is the death of the just one who was drowned in the Indian Ocean, and with him was lost considerable money belonging to me, himself and others. He left me his widow and a little daughter. For nearly a year after I received the sad news, I lay ill on my bed, afflicted with fever and despair. Eight years have since passed and I still mourn, and there is no consolation. What can console me? He grew up on my knees; he was my brother; he was my disciple. He was engaged in business and earned an income that I might stay at home and continue my studies. He was learned in the Talmud, the Bible and grammar. Seeing him was my chief joy. Now he has gone to life eternal and has left me in a turmoil in a strange land. Whenever I see his hand writing or one of his books, my pain and my grief are awakened anew. In short, 'I will go down into the grave unto my son, mourning.' Were not the study of the Torah my delight and did not the study of the sciences divert me from my grief, I would have succumbed in my misery." After the death of his brother, he was left with a large family and without any income. He could easily have obtained a position as dayyan or some other fabbinical position, but he would not violate his principle of not using his scholarship in the Torah as a means of livelihood. Even in his despair, he would make no compromise. He always practised what he preached. He turned to medicine as a means of support. He was as yet an unknown man in this field, and, consequently, his practice was not extensive nor his fees substantial. He, therefore, turned to lecturing on philosophical subjects. In this way, Maimonides faced the problem of meeting the economic responsibilities of his family. Maimonides' authority over the Jews in Egypt manifested itself more strongly when the Nagidut was temporarily</page><page sequence="16">76 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK abolished and an Exilarchate was established. The opposi tion to the Nagid Zuta, of which Maimonides was a member if not the spiritual leader, won a victory over the most hated Nagid. This victory, however, was not due to the strength of the oppositions itself, but rather to the political circumstances then existing in Egypt. In 1176, after defeat ing his rivals in Syria, Saladin returned to Egypt as King of both countries. His triumph was utilized by the opposi tion against the hated Nagid, Zuta, to remove him from his position. Being the capital of Syria, Damascus was the seat of the Exilarch who claimed descent from the family of David. When Saladin proclaimed himself the King of Egypt as well as of Syria, he transferred his capital from Damascus to Cairo. The opposition to Zuta persuaded the Saladin government to transfer the Exilarchate from Damascus to Cairo, since it would be more appropriate for the Jews to have the Exilarch in Cairo, which was now the capital of the Kingdom. Judah, the son of Josiah, the grandson of Solomon of Damascus, was brought to Fostat (Cairo) and was proclaimed the Exilarch of the entire Kingdom. Thus, the opposition not only removed Zuta from his office but also abolished the Nagidut and established an Exilarchate. The belief expressed by some scholars that Maimonides was a, Nagid is groundless. Not only was he not a Nagid, but he actually helped to abolish that office and establish an Exilarch. Since Maimonides was responsible for bring ing Judah to Egypt, he became influential with the Exilarch, who not only countersigned some of Maimonides' decrees, but also issued a patriarchal ordinance making all Maimon ides' decisions in the Law final, and forbidding anyone from questioning them. Maimonides was the greatest scholar of that day in Egypt. He possessed, undoubtedly, more knowledge of the Jewish Law than any of the other rabbis there. He was very popular because of his writings, his Commentary on the Mishna, and his letter to the Yemen Jews. Now with the authorization of the Exilarch, he became spiritual leader of Israel throughout the entire Kingdom of Saladin.</page><page sequence="17">MAIMONIDESMAIMONIDES 77 III. In 1180, Maimonides completed his magnum opus, the "Mishne Torah" (The Second Torah) or as it is also known, the "Yad Ha-Hazakah" (Strong Hand). Written in Mishnaic Hebrew, it comprised all the Biblical laws and other laws and customs in existence up to his own time. This work, divided into fourteen books, was completed after ten years of enormous labor. Each book dealt with several topics of Jewish law. In a short introduction, Maimonides states that all the commandments as well as their interpretations were given to Moses on Mount Sinai. The Torah was the written law, while Mitzvah was the interpretation and was called the Oral Law. Then he relates the history of the tradition and lists all the sages from Moses to Rabbi Judah, the Nasi, the compiler of the Mishna, mentioning by name the more important ones from Rabbi Judah, the Nasi, up to Rav Ashi, the compiler of the Gemara. He enumerates forty generations from Moses to Rav Ashi. "In our days," said Maimonides, "when scholars are few and scholarship rare, I, Moses, the son of Maimun the Spaniard, am compiling a book on the entire Jewish Law without discussions or debates, wherein all the laws are clearly explained." He claimed, in short, that his book included all the laws from the Bible down to the compilation of the Talmud as they were interpreted by the Gaonim. He even contended that it was not necessary to consult any other work except his for a knowledge of the Jewish Law. "Therefore," he said, "I call this book Mishne Torah (The Second Torah)." In the first book, Sefer ha-Mada, Maimonides codifies the laws relating to the thirteen principles of Judaism, which he had already formulated in his commentary on the Mishna. He considers a Jew who does not believe in any of the thirteen principles to be a heretic. He names five different categories of men whom he calls minim (heretics). First, there are those who maintain there is no God; second, those who do not believe in the unity of God; third, those who maintain that God is corporeal; fourth, those who say that God did not create the world ex nihilo;</page><page sequence="18">78 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK and fifth, those who worship stars and planets. Because he placed among the heretics those who believed that the Creator was corporeal, he aroused the ire of the rabbis of that period. The conception that God was corporeal had been popular among the Jews for many centuries. Maimon ides thus excluded a large portion of the Jewish people and also many prominent rabbis from the Olam Haba (The World to Come). Rabbi Abraham ben David of Posquières, France, in his Hassagot (Criticism) on the Mishne Torah, very rigorously objected to Maimonides' doctrine and expressed himself thus: "Greater and better people than he believe in this idea." Maimonides dealt also at length with the problems of Free-will and Providence. He gave the order of the daily prayers and those of the Sabbath and various holidays, at the end of the second book. In the remaining books, he sets forth the rest of the laws. He divides them into two definite classes, the laws in the Bible, and the laws which were handed down by SoferimSoferim (scribes). He regards as biblical not only the laws which are enumerated in the Torah, but also those derived from them by the soferim by analogy. He also considers as biblical all the laws which the rabbis had by .tradition assigned to Moses. Hs regards all the laws which were introduced by the sages through midoth, i. e. logical argu ments, as rabbinical and not biblical. Maimonides completed the Mishne Torah when he was forty-five years of age. He did not write this book in regular sequence, but wrote various sections at different times— a procedure which is discernible throughout this great work. What was Maimonides' purpose in writing the Mishne Torah? Did he intend, as his contemporaries charged, to supplant the Talmud? There seemed at first to be grounds for this charge in the fact that he did not mention the name of any of the Tannaim or Amoraim. Further, he had stated in his introduction that anyone familiar with the Pentateuch would, after reading his Mishne Torah, have a knowledge of all the Oral Laws without having recourse to any other book. The charge of his contemporaries is maintained by some modern scholars. This charge, however, cannot be sustained, because Maimonides mentions the Talmud in many passages of</page><page sequence="19">MAIMONIDESMAIMONIDES 79 his book. By doing so, he invites the scholars, who read his book, to consult the Talmud for reference or comparison. Furthermore, in the first book of the Mishne Torah, he lays particular stress upon continually studying the Talmud. From all this we see that he did not wish to dispense with it. However, his explanation as to why he did not mention the names of the Tannaim and Amoraim in the Mishne Torah was far from satisfactory. Did he seek to compile his Mishne Torah with Rabbi Judah's code, the Mishna, as a model, as most of the scholars maintain? This theory is untenable. Maimonides cannot be called a codifier, for a codifier does not add new laws for which he has no authority, nor does he decide the law against the sources. In many cases Maimonides decided the law contrary to the decisions in the Talmud and in the works of the Gaonim. We realize, then, that the statement in his introduction that, if one studies his book as well as the Torah, one would not need to study any other book meant that he believed that his work bore a resemblance to the Torah rather than to the Mishna. What then, was the purpose of Maimonides in compiling the Mishna Torah? The answer to this question, undoubt edly, is connected with his conception of the Messianic Age. It is clear from the "Iggeret ha-Shemad," and par ticularly, his "Iggeret Teman," that he expected that the Messiah would shortly arrive. In the latter work, he had held that the persecutions of the Jews under Christian rule in France and Germany, and the persecutions in the countries under Moslem control, undoubtedly were the predicted Jewish agony before the advent of the Messiah. He also believed that the Messianic Age would be nigh just when the power of the Christians and the Moslems was at its height and their kingdoms were spreading through out the world. That was precisely the situation when Maimonides was working on his Mishne Torah. The critical moment had arrived, and he had no doubt that the Messiah would soon come. He said that the prophets had foretold that this very age, in which he and his contemporaries were living, was that of the Messianic era. Maimonides, it will be</page><page sequence="20">80 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK recalled, gave as the date of the returning of prophecy to Israel, the year 4976 a.m., i. e., 1216 c. E. which he believed would be followed very shortly by the coming of the Messiah. Maimonides, then, expected the return of the Jews to Palestine, shortly. This view does not conflict with his rationalism. He was not a mystic. He did not represent the Messiah as a supernatural person. He expressed his views on this subject a number of times in his writings. He held that Messiah would be a mortal, a king, a descen dant of the house of David, a man wiser than Solomon, and a prophet next in greatness to Moses. The returning of the Jews to Palestine would not be a supernatural event, as many believed, but would be the aftermath of a victory by the King over those in possession of the Holy Land, making it possible for the Jews to return. Since Maimonides expected the Messiah to arrive soon, he prepared a Jewish Constitution for the occasion. He wrote this Constitution on the model of the Torah and not on that of the Mishna. Since a constitution does not give the names of authorities, he did not mention the names of individual scholars, but referred to the Tannaim, or Amoraim, or Gaonim, only collectively. Since a constitution sets forth not only the laws but also the principles of government, as the Bible, for example, does, his Mishne Torah presented the principles and administration of Jewish government under the elements of the law. In the first book, he gave the principles of Judaism, and in the other books he codified all the laws. As the Unity of God is expressed in the first of the ten commandments, so is the Unity of God set forth at the beginning of the Mishne Torah. That Maimonides wished to have his book second to the Torah of Moses is evident from the title, Mishne Torah (The Second Torah). He divided his book into fourteen parts because fourteen is the numeral value of the word Yad,Yad, part of the phrase "Yad Ha-Hazaka" occurring in the last verse of the Pentateuch which reads, "To the strong hand, the great vision (prophecy) which Moses showed before the eyes of the entire Jewish People."1 1This translation is in accordance with the traditional Jewish inter pretation of this passage. See also Targum Onkelos.</page><page sequence="21">MAIMONIDESMAIMONIDES 81 At the time when Maimonides was compiling the Mishne Torah, he wrote also a book called "Sefer Ha-Mitzvot," the Book of Precepts. The reason for writing it was that he sought to correct the errors of those who included non biblical precepts among the six hundred and thirteen biblical precepts, which he had enumerated in his Mishne Torah. He called this new book an introductory work to the Mishne Torah itself. He wrote this book in the Arabic language but, in later days, regretted that he had not writ ten it in Hebrew. It was translated into Hebrew in the first part of the thirteenth century. There have been three translations, one by Abraham ibn Hasdai, another by Moses ibn Tibbon, and a third by Solomon ibn Ayyub of Béziers, France. (The Arabic text was edited by M. Bloch, "Le Livre des Precepts par Moïse ben Maimon.") The Mishne Torah was welcomed by most of the Jews of Egypt. However, some obscure rabbis, either out of envy, or jealousy, or for other personal reasons, began finding fault with the work. One of the main opponents of Maimonides was Samuel ben Ali, the head of the Yeshiva in Bagdad. His opposition to Maimonides was not based alone on the merits of the Mishne Torah or his disagreement with decisions therein, but on profounder differences on the conceptions of Judaism which each entertained. Maimon ides maintained that the leadership of the Jews should be vested in the Exilarch, the political leader (in this, Maimon ides proved himself a pioneer of Jewish Nationalism), on the other hand, Samuel ben Ali believed that leadership should be vested in a man of spiritual authority, such as Gaon, and sought to abolish the office of the Exilarch. It was due only to Maimonides' influence that this office was not abolished. Samuel ben Ali's animosity toward Maimon ides can be readily understood since he was responsible for thwarting ben Ali's life's ambition to abolish the Exilarchate, and to proclaim himself the sole leader of the Babylonian Jews. When Maimonides' work reached France, at that time the center of Jewish scholarship, the rabbis received it with some acclamation, although not with entire approval of his method. They saw that the book was a product of one of the greatest Jewish scholars, that it was not the work</page><page sequence="22">82 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK of an ordinary rabbi. However, one French scholar, Abra ham ben David of Pasquières, known also as RaBad was very much opposed to the book and wrote Hassagot (criticism) which was not always fair to the author, whom he assailed for his theological views, frequently indulging in severely acrimonious language including the use of such expressions as "This is not true," "This reason has no sense." The Mishne Torah was received generally with great praise. The rabbis consulted it on doubtful questions of the law. But it never acquired the status of a code like the Mishna. Many modern scholars believe that it was very fortunate that Maimonides' Mishne Torah was not accepted as the last word in the Jewish law, as, otherwise, Judaism might have become a static religion incapable of further development. This theory and the fear underlying it, however, are unfounded. Jewish law was always elastic. During the Second Commonwealth the sages continually added new laws, so as to bring Jewish law into harmony with life. They did this by new interpretations of the verses of the Bible, modifications of ancient Halaka, and by the use of legal fictions. Although the Mishna was a code, it did not become the final word in Judaism. The Amoraim developed Jewish law further by interpretation of the Mishna. Even if the Mishne Torah had been accepted as a code, the evolution of Jewish law would not have ceased with it. The Mishne Torah, however, did become the standard book on Jewish law. Many commentaries have been written on it, one called "Kesef Mishna" by Rabbi Joseph Caro, himself the author of a famous code, the Shulchan Aruch. Vidal de Toïosa, who flourished in the early part of the fourteenth century, also wrote a commentary named, "Maggid Mishna." IV. About the year 1190, Maimonides finished his second great work, "Dalalat al-Hairin," or, in Hebrew, "Moreh Nebukim" (Guide to the Perplexed). Like his commentary on the Mishna, it was written in the Arabic language but with Hebrew characters. It was intended as a guide not</page><page sequence="23">MAIMONIDESMAIMONIDES 83 only for his disciple Joseph ibn Aknin, but for perplexed thinkers whose studies brought them into conflict with religion, and for students of philosophy bewildered by the ambiguous and figurative expressions employed in the Scriptures. In the Introduction, which was in the form of a letter to Aknin, Maimonides stated that upon receiving Aknin's early letters from Alexandria, he had formed a high opinion of him. His estimate of him rose still higher when he observed the acumen Aknin showed when he studied under him. Now that Aknin had left Egypt, his absence had prompted Maimonides to compose this work and send each chapter to Aknin as soon as it was completed. The Moreh Nebukim is divided into three parts, besides the Introduction. In the first part, Maimonides deals with the interpretations of biblical anthropomorphism. He says here that some of the anthropomorphic words used are homonymous, that is, have several meanings. Other words are imperfectly homonymous, being employed in some instances only figuratively. He deals with the various divine attributes which should not be applied directly or indirectly to God. In the second part, he sets forth his proofs for the exis tence of one Creator, the Primal Cause, who is incorporeal, and without resemblance or relation to anything in the world of the senses. He also treats of the 'intelligences' of the spheres, which he identified with the angels mentioned in the Bible. He discusses the theory of Creatio ex-Nihilo which he accepted, and the Maaseh Bereshit (the Account of the Creation). He also deals at length with the problem of prophecy. He holds that Prophecy is a divine gift, the requisites for which are perfection of all one's faculties as well as possession of a sound body. The mind has to be cultivated, the imagination developed, and the moral sense refined. To be a prophet, one has to possess courage and intuition and to have control over sensual thoughts; no wicked or ignorant person can become one. One has also to obtain special training and education. The philosophers held that prophecy itself is an actual faculty of man that could be achieved, but Maimonides maintains that only God confers the gift.</page><page sequence="24">84 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK The mere possession of abilities does not make one eligible, unless God bestows upon him the gift of prophecy. In part three, Maimonides enters, with great caution, upon an explanation of the Maaseh Merkabah, the story of the Divine Chariot, which Ezekiel described in his vision. Although Maimonides knew he was forbidden by Law to teach these mysteries, he overcomes this difficulty. He asserts that oral instruction on this subject is per mitted when the pupil possesses unusual qualifications, although even then, only the titles .of the chapters could be transmitted. Such restrictions upon this study explains why the secret of this mystery had been forgotten by the Jews. On one hand, he realizes the external obstacles of writing about the mysteries of the Divine Chariot (met aphysics), yet, on the other hand, if he had refused to write about them, his knowledge of the subject would have died with him, thus depriving those who were perplexed, of his aid. Thus, in either case, he would have been guilty of intellectual wrong-doing; therefore, he decided to set down his views without divesting the subject altogether of its mysterious character. His explanations would then be fully intelligible to the philosopher, but designedly not to the ordinary reader for whom they would be mere paraphrases of the Biblical text. In the same book, he also sets forth his opinions on Providence. According to him, every rational individual is under Divine Providence, but in the case of animals only the species is, not the creature itself. Divine Providence manifests itself to man in varying degrees, depending upon the man himself. The greater the perfection he attains, the greater the benefits extended to him. Providence is be neficient to those who are perfect ׳in their conception of God, and who always direct their minds towards Him. But God permits those who are perfect in their knowledge of Him to enjoy His presence only when they meditate upon Him. When their thought are engaged in other matters, Divine Providence departs from them. The temporary withdrawal of Providence in this instance is not in the same category as its complete absence in those who do not reflect on God at all.</page><page sequence="25">MAIMONIDESMAIMONIDES 85 He also gives reasons for the promulgation of the Precepts, every one of which, whether positive or negative, has its usefulness. He divides them into two classes, those dealing with relations between man and God, and those bearing upon relations between man and man. God issued all of them for the purpose of improving man's mental and physical condition. Those between man and God are intended to impart the true knowledge of man. Those between man and man are to remove injustice and to establish a righteous social order. (He divided the Precepts into fourteen classes, as he had already done in his book, Sefer ha-Mitzvot). In his book, Moreh Nebukim, as well as in his Com mentary on the Mishna, Maimonides endeavors to prove his views on philosophy and psychology by citing verses in the Bible into which he reads his ideas. In doing so, he followed the method of the sages who tried to read into the Bible their Halakic point of view. This attempt to derive various ideas of theology and ethics from the Bible is apparent throughout the Midrashim. The same method was applied by Philo and followed by many of the Church Fathers. Saadia Gaon, also quoted verses from the Bible to corroborate his theories. Maimonides' method of extracting his philosophical and ethical concep tions from biblical texts was more comprehensive and elaborate than that of earlier thinkers. Maimonides has been accused of trying to harmonize Hellenism and Judaism and to bring Aristotelian ideas into the Bible. He has also been charged with trying to force interpretations so as to make biblical theology harmonize with Aristotelian metaphysics. These charges are really groundless. He was a Jew first of all. It is true that he had great admiration for Hellenist culture, particularly for the philosophy of Aristotle, but he did not slavishly accept it. He rejected Aristotle's idea of the eternity of the universe, not because certain passages in the Scriptures asserted the idea of Creation, but because he was not convinced that the idea of the eternity of the universe as taught by Aristotle had been proven. Spinoza declared that Maimonides' method of reconciling the Scriptures with reason had no real basis, and that to</page><page sequence="26">86 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK explain the words of the Scriptures according to precon ceived opinions, twisting them about and completely changing the literal sense, as Maimonides tried to do, was harmful, useless and absurd. This severe criticism is not justified. These two thinkers differed radically in their views on the inspiration of the Scriptures. Spinoza believed that Moses did not write the Pentateuch but that Ezra, at a later period, was the author; therefore, Spinoza thought the Torah is a book which might have errors and limitations. Maimonides, on the other hand, believed that God gave the Torah, in its entirety, to Moses and hence that it is infallible. If science and reason con tradict the words of the Torah, such words are to be explained allegorically, but are not to be dismissed, for they are divine. Even the Talmud had declared that the Torah spoke in the language of the people, locuta est lex lingua hominum,hominum, so that they should be able to understand its meaning. Maimonides regarded Judaism not as a dead corpse but as a living religion. He could not imagine that the precepts given to the Jews should have no basis in reason; he was sure that there must have been a motive. He made it clear that every precept given to the Jews was for some social purpose. He believed that the precepts were given to the Jews to improve their intellect and morals, and to make them a holy nation. The keynote of Maimonides' interpretation of the precepts was that they were for the benefit of the people themselves rather than for some advantage to God. In this respect, he followed the teachings of the prophets and the Pharisees. God receives nothing through the people's observance of the precepts. If a man obeys the laws, his obedience enures to his own good. Maimonides rejects the claim of some people who regard themselves as perfect and believe they do not need the precepts for further perfection of their character. He holds that the Jewish Law is divine and immutable and, since the human being is never perfect, to be observed forever. Law was divinely given, it is to be universally applied, and is to be followed irrespective of times or places. It is not medicine, the administering of which depends upon varying conditions, persons and times.</page><page sequence="27">MAIMONIDESMAIMONIDESMAIMONIDES 87 The view that certain laws no longer have a raison d'être and need not be observed, is a mistaken one, Furthermore, the Jewish law must not be abrogated, because the chain of Jewish history might be broken. Maimonides observed even the customs to which he was opposed, since they had been maintained by the Jews for many generations; he followed the tradition so as not to destroy the unity of the Jewish people. However, he did not engage in the practices which were based on superstitions or some tenet to which Judaism was opposed. The precepts would be abolished only when the Jewish people as a whole reached perfection, that is in the Olam Haba (The Future World). It would not be necessary to observe the commandments and precepts there. The righteous would sit with crowns on their heads and enjoy the Divine Glory. The Moreh Nebukim work was translated into Hebrew by Samuel ibn Tibbon during the lifetime of Maimonides, and later by Jehudah Al-Harizi. It was translated into Latin in the thirteenth century, and later it appeared in a number of other languages. Many commentaries have been written on it, the most outstanding ones being by Moses Narboni, Shem-Tob, Profit Duran (Efodi), Crescas, and Isaac Abarbanel. V. Maimonides was not only a great philosopher and Talmudist, but also a well-known physician whose fame had spread through the entire country. Members of the nobility as well as the common people sought his medical advice. It was said that the King of the Franks in Ascalon (Richard) invited Maimonides to become his physician, but that Maimonides declined the honor. He was not eager to live in the Christian countries where the Jews were so greatly persecuted. He preferred his adopted land. By education and by culture, he felt himself more akin to the Moslems than to the Christians. Abd al Latif, the well-known physician of Bagdad, said that one of his reasons for spending some time in Egypt was to make the acquaintance of Musa ibn Maimun. The</page><page sequence="28">88 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK Arabic poet and kadhi, al Said ibn Sena al Mulk, wrote a poem in honor of Maimonides, in which he said: "Galen's art heals only the body, But abu-Amrun's, the body and the soul. His knowledge made him the physician of the century. He could heal with his wisdom, the sickness of ignorance. If the moon would submit to his art He would deliver her of her spots At the time of the full moon, cure her of her defects, And, at the time of her conjunction, save her from waning." Maimonides practised medicine very conscientiously. He was so busy that he could not read many of the medical works he would have liked to read. He regretted this, for, as he told ibn Aknin, a lover of truth cannot have sound theories on medicine unless he can prove them by reference to the proper sources. He never prescribed drugs as long as he could cure the patient by a proper diet. He resorted to drugs for his patients only when absolutely necessary. He never wrote a prescription unless its efficacy was assured by the great masters in medicine. In his writings on medicine, as in his writings on the Talmud, he used lucid language and arranged his ideas logically and systematically. He attempted to consider critically all that had been previously written on the sub ject. He was a voluminous writer of medical works, which were composed in Arabic, in the simple semi-philosophical style of Averroës and Avicenna. Some of his books were translated into Hebrew and Latin. His book, "Aphorisms," (Fusul Musu) Pirke Moshe, which consists of fifteen hundred Aphorisms, and is divided into twenty-four chapters, is one of his important contributions and deals with various phases of medicine. He treats here of anatomy, physiology and pathology, of aetiology, and specific therapeutics. He deals with different causes of fever; he writes about gyne cology, the practice of personal hygiene, gymnastics, and physical training. Another popular medical book that he wrote deals with the General Rules of Health. It was dedicated to the Sultan, el Afdal. Maimonides pays considerable attention to rules</page><page sequence="29">MAIMONIDESMAIMONIDES 89 on diet, and he stressed the importance of taking care of one's stomach. He realizes the ill effects caused by con stipation, and shows how this might be avoided. He warns against overeating, to which he traces many illnesses. People do not overfeed their cattle, yet they do gorge their own stomachs. They even do not take the necessary physical exercise. Maimonides says that one should consult a physician not only when seriouslv ill but when showing even the slightest symptoms of illness. One should not wait until one becomes dangerously sick, when it may be too late. Convalescents and elderly people, especially, should fre quently consult their physicians. He does not agree with those who believe that nature alone would effect a cure and that one can altogether dispense with drugs. He believed that wine moderately taken is healthful; that it is a remedy in curing illness; that it is more con ducive to the health of older people than that of younger people; and that it is particularly strengthening to those who are aged and feeble. Unfortunately, many people indulge in it to the point of intoxication, when it is very injurious to the body. He demolishes the false theory of those who held that intoxication once a month is beneficial. In this book, he also laid great stress upon cleanliness, as important in preserving the general health and serving as an aid in healing many diseases. He emphasizes the value of breathing fresh, dry air as necessary to keep the body in health. He wrote other books on medicine and dealt with such themes as asthma, hemorrhoids, reptile poisons. He also wrote a book on sex, in which he named drugs to be admin istered and certain foods to be eaten or avoided to cure various maladies. His own activities as a physician and his daily routine he fully described in a letter to Samuel ibn Tibbon in a unique autobiographical passage: "I dwell at Mizr [Fostat] and the Sultan resides at Kahira [Cairo] ; these two places are two Sabbath days' journey [about one mile and a half] distance from each other. My duties to the Sultan are very heavy. I am obliged to visit him every day, early in the morning; and when he or any of his children, or any of the inmates</page><page sequence="30">90 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK of his Harem are indisposed, I dare not quit Kahira, but must stay during the greater part of the day in the palace. It also frequently happens that one or two of the royal officers fall sick, and I must attend to their healing. Hence, as a rule, I repair to Kahira very early in the day, and even if nothing unusual happens, I do not return to Mizr until the afternoon. Then I am almost dying with hunger. I find the ante-chamber filled with people, both Jews and Gentiles, nobles and common people, judges and bailiffs, friends and foes—a mixed multitude, who await the time of my return. "I dismount from my animal, wash my hands, go forth to my patients, and entreat them to bear with me while I partake of some slight refreshments, the only meal I take in the twenty-four hours. Then I attend to my patients, and write prescriptions and directions for their several ailments. Patients go in and out until nightfall, and sometimes even, I solemnly assure you, until two hours and more in the night. I converse with and prescribe for them while lying down from sheer fatigue, and when night falls I am so exhausted that I can scarcely speak. "In consequence of this, no Israelite can have any private interview with me, except on the Sabbath. On that day the whole Congregation, or, at least the majority of the members, come to me after the morning service, when I instruct [advise] them as to their pro ceedings during the whole week; we study together a little until noon, when they depart. Some of them return, and read with me after the afternoon service until evening prayers. In this manner I spend that day." In his letter to Aknin, he deplored the fact that his time was so taken up that he could not pursue his studies or even read any books. VI. During the last years of his life, Maimonides reached the highest position possible for a Jew in Egypt. His authority as a physician was well-established and he had great influence in the court of el Afdal. And yet, he remained</page><page sequence="31">MAIMONIDESMAIMONIDES 91 the same modest man that he had been in his early days in Morocco. He regarded his position as one of great responsibility and was not unduly flattered because of the personal fame and success it brought him. With his influence at Court, he did whatever he could to help his brother Jews scattered over the world. When Saladin conquered Palestine and Jerusalem, Maimonides persuaded him to permit the Jews to settle there. In his various letters, he encouraged many communities throughout the Diaspora to remain loyal to J udaism. He also became the recognized authority on rabbinics. Even some of his previous opponents accepted his decisions. A large correspondence developed between him and the scholars of other countries, particularly Palestine and Provence. Maimonides took a keen interest in Jewish affairs in Egypt. He was very active in obtaining ransom money for many Jewish prisoners who were captured during the wars between the Moslems and the Crusaders. He wrote letters to different communities to obtain the necessary funds to release the victims. The payment of ransom for the release of Jewish captives he considered a supreme duty of the whole Jewish people. With the assistance of other rabbis, he prepared various Takkanot (Ordinances) to improve the social life of the Jews in Egypt. Since he was very busy and occupied with numerous duties, he issued all the orders to be followed during the week at his home in Fostat where the congregation used to assemble every Sabbath. An aristocrat by nature, he was, nevertheless, democratic in his relations with ordinary people. In letters to friends, who had been his guests, he always remembered to send regards from his servants whom he treated as equals in his household. Because he regarded scholarship as the acme of human attainment, he believed that the public should provide for the needs of those engaged in study. He did not, however, hold that a student should be exempt from work because he believed it to be below his dignity. A man should not derive his income from his studies but should be engaged in some gainful occupation, no matter how humble.</page><page sequence="32">92 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK That Maimonides was richly endowed with humane feelings is shown by his attitude towards the slave and the laborer. Although he never advised complete abolition of slavery, which was a recognized institution in his day, yet he sought to ease the conditions of the slaves and to modify harsh laws governing them. He disapproved of cruelty, in any form, to slaves, whether pagan or Jewish. In principle, he was opposed to slavery and advised the Jews rather to hire employees than to buy slaves. In litigation between employer and employee, Maimonides usually showed an inclination to favor the employee. Charity, according to Maimonides, was one of the great est institutions in Jewish life, ranking in importance next to ransom for release of Jewish captives. He divided the dispensers of charity into eight classes according to rising degrees of worth, the highest being those who make it pos sible for the needy person to establish himself in business so that he should not be compelled to apply for charity. Maimonides lived at a time when people were persecuted in the name of religion. The Jews were persecuted in Spain and Morocco for not accepting Islam; and, in France and Germany, for not accepting Christianity. He believed that the Jewish religion was a heritage of the Jews alone, since they had voluntarily accepted it on Mt. Sinai; it ought, therefore, not be imposed upon other races or nations. But, if anyone wishes to embrace the Jewish religion, he should be made welcome. Although his forefathers were heathens, such a proselyte could, like the rest of the Jews, invoke God in the prayers which read: "God, our God, and the God of our fathers." Maimonides thus demon strated that, although the Jewish religion had been accepted only by the Jews, it need not be confined to them alone or to Semites in general. Anyone who became a proselyte was entitled to all the privileges of a Jew. In this time, Christian lands were regarded as the homes of Christians only and Islamic lands of Moslems only. In his Constitution for the future Jewish State, Maimonides advocated equal rights for gentiles in Palestine. He maintained that under no circumstance should Jews forcibly compel them to accept the Jewish religion. The only requirement for cit izenship for the gentiles was observance of the seven</page><page sequence="33">MAIMONIDESMAIMONIDES 93 precepts of Noah,—injunctions against idolatry, blasphemy, homicide, incest, robbery, dismembering live animals, and anarchy. These are not particularly Jewish laws but come under the class of jus gentium, the laws of society, and should be observed by every civilized person. He displayed as liberal an attitude to the Karaites as he did to the followers of other religions. He did not con sider them heretics nor abuse them, for, he held they had no choice when born and should not be held responsible for the schism introduced by their forefathers. By his writings, Maimonides made many friends, but also many opponents. He was very devoted to his admirers and acted as a father toward them; yet, he showed no malice or vindictiveness toward his opponents. He had no fears that their slanderous attacks would harm him, and he forgave those who indulged in them because they profited thereby. He forgave particularly those who slandered him on account of their ignorance. He gave Rabbi Pinhas, one of his bitter opponents, some friendly advice, namely, not to leave Egypt, where he had established himself and was safe, for some Christian country where he might be persecuted. Maimonides possessed great courage. When the question of faith and Judaism was involved, he disregarded all con sideration for his own position or his personal safety, and fearlessly couched his views in writing even though he might be arrested by the Moslems for doing so. He wrote his letter to the Jews of Yemen at the risk of his life, because, with Judaism in danger, he was ready to sacrifice himself. In his book, Moreh Nebukim, he displayed outstanding boldness in openly saying that Mohammed was not the true prophet, for it must be remembered that the work appeared in a country where Islam was the dominant religion. He asked his pupil Aknin, not to transcribe it into Arabic characters since the entire Islamic world would then be able to read it and his life might be endangered. In all his writings, from the Commentary on the Mishna to the Mishne Torah, he showed independence and heroism. He set forth his views fully, although they were often antagonistic to those held by leading scholars as well as the masses. Many of his ideas were at that time considered</page><page sequence="34">94 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK heretical among the Jews. His ideas on the Messiah were particularly bold. In a period when the masses as well as the Rabbis believed that the Messiah would have super natural powers and would perform miracles, Maimonides was of the opinion that the Messiah would be a man born, and subject to death like any other mortal. He would conquer Palestine and unite the Jews into one nation. He would attempt no impossible physical changes in the world, perform no miracles, nor resurrect the dead. He would be a a man like the Messiah, King David. In an age when not only the ordinary people but some scholars, as well, believed in superstition, he manifested great resoluteness in combating superstition and astrology, and wielded a sharp lance against them. His personal life was not a happy one. As a boy, he had had to wander from city to city in his native country, Andalusia, in mortal fear of the fanatics (Almohades). When he came to Egypt, his father died, and then his brother David, the main support of the family, was drowned in the Indian Ocean where all his assets were also lost. He married when he was forty-nine years old. The only daugh ter of Maimonides died in her infancy. Abraham, his only son, was sickly throughout his boyhood. He himself suf fered from illness. Already several years before his death, his hands used to tremble and he found it difficult to hold a pen. Moses ben Maimon died on the twentieth of the month of Tebet, 4965 A. M., December 13,1204 c. E. Both admirers and opponents bewailed his passing and voiced their great grief. Public mourning was declared in the entire country of Egypt and, for three days, Jews and Moslems lamented. A general fast was proclaimed in Jerusalem. A portion of the Torah which is called the Tokahah was read in the synagogues, and the Haftorah was read from the first book of Samuel, concluding with the now significant verse, "The glory is departed from Israel, for the Ark of God is taken." There is current among the Jewish people the saying "From Moses until Moses (Maimonides) there arose none like Moses." This expression came into vogue as early as the thirteenth century. We may say this verdict of the</page><page sequence="35">MAIMONIDESMAIMONIDES 95 people is the verdict of history. Moses, the son of Amram, who delivered the Jews from slavery and led them to the Promised Land was the first to write a Constitution,—the Torah. The second Moses (Maimonides), who likewise cherished the hope that, as a result of the wars between the Crescent and the Cross, the Jews would return to their country, Palestine, also wrote a Constitution,—• the second next to the Torah. The first Moses died, apparently a dis appointed man because he did not enter into the Promised Land with the Jews. Moses, the son of Maimum, likewise died a disappointed man, for he did not live to see the restoration of the Jews in Palestine nor the return of proph ecy to Israel. VII. Maimonides' writings on Judaism influenced the the ologians of the two sister religions, Islam and Christianity to a great extent. When the Moreh Nebukim was tran scribed into the Arabic characters, soon after its completion, it took hold upon the Mohammedan world. Abd al-Latif, a contemporary Moslem theologian, read it; Arabic scholars lectured upon it to their pupils, and generally extolled it, except the section dealing with the theories on prophecy. Maimonides' influence upon Christian theologians was even more significant. As a result of the capture of Con stantinople by the Fourth Crusade in 1204, and the con sequent revelation of the treasures of Greek literature to European scholars, the Church in the thirteenth century paid considerable attention to the writings of Aristotle. Through commentaries of Averroës, who owed his fame to the Jewish translation of his works, Christian theologians were introduced to Aristotle, who made a profound impres sion upon their thought. The Scholastics read and studied the Moreh Nebukim extensively. Alexander of Hales, "the master and the father" of the Franciscan School, in his book "Summa," frequently quoted Maimonides, as did also Albertus Magnus and John Scotus. Thomas Aquinas, who, in his lifetime, was accepted by the Dominicans as the greatest authority in theology, consulted the Moreh Nebukim frequently. Following in its author's footsteps, he also tried to reconcile</page><page sequence="36">96 AMERICAN JEWISH YEAR BOOK religion with Aristotelian ideas. He drew freely upon the methods and arguments of Maimonides to whom he refers as Rabbi Moses. Although severe in his criticism of Mai monides, Spinoza was greatly influenced by him. Maimonides' influence upon the Jews is inestimable. Every Jewish thinker of importance, from the thirteenth century to our own day, has felt the impress of his writings. Moses Mendelssohn was deeply indebted to him, and both Solomon Maimon and Nahman Korchmal drew their inspiration from the writings of Maimonides. It was not through his Moreh Nebukim, however, but through his Mishne Torah that Maimonides exerted the greatest influence upon the Jewish people. This work made him the greatest authority in rabbinical law. Even his opponents did not deny its great importance. It was because Jewish scholars regarded it as so monumental in rabbinical law, that they were led to pay attention to the other great work of its author, the Moreh Nebukim. This work might otherwise have been ignored by the bulk of the Jews, as were the philosophical works of Ibn Daud and Ibn Ezra. The Mishne Torah became the standard book in Jewish Law. Commentaries and even books were written about it. Rules on how to study it were laid down by rabbinical scholars. The Maimunist controversy, which began during his lifetime, and culminated in the burning of his books, the Moreh Nebukim, and the Sefer ha-Mada (the first book of the Mishne Torah) has not yet ceased. Many Jews still object to some of his doctrines, particularly his reasons for the precepts in the third part of the Moreh Nebukim. A controversy so enduring could have been inaugurated only by the writings of a talmudic scholar. Some scholars and thinkers may have passing influence upon some intellectuals ; they may have followers and opponents, but only for a limited time. The philosophical writings of men like Abraham ibn Ezra and Levi ben Gershon have been almost completely ignored by the bulk of the Jewish people; they were not talmudic authorities like Maimonides. Maimonides has guided the Jews for almost eight cen turies and may well remain a guide indefinitely. In anticipa tion of the return of the Jews to Palestine and of the restoration</page><page sequence="37">MAIMONIDESMAIMONIDES 97 of Prophecy in Israel, he wrote the Mishne Torah as a Constitution for the Jewish people in Palestine and in the Diaspora. He showed great courage in advancing his theories on the Halaka. He introduced his own interpréta tions, he said, in the name of God and the Jewish people. The vision which Maimonides cherished, that the Jews would return to Palestine has, meanwhile, been partially fulfilled. The Mishne Torah must be rewritten in the same spirit in which he conceived it—faithful to the concept of historical Judaism as it prevailed among the Pharisees in the Second Commonwealth. It must be the work of rational ists who unite in themselves the authority of rabbinical law and the richness of modern secular knowledge, so as to bring into consonance Jewish life and religion in the Diaspora and in Palestine.</page></plain_text>
