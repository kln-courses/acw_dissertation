<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS an Islamic Civilisation' (p. 112). At the same time Kortunov and Lounev mention the Clash of Civilisations thesis (p. 107). Although it is clear that the thesis is met with some degree of scepticism, it is also interesting to see how commentators like Huntington have influenced the debate in Russia. The stability issue is also one which runs throughout this part of the book. This is especially the case concerning Russian out-migration and other population dynamics in the region, as made clear in an interesting chapter by Alexander Akimov. The third section deals with the economic situation. Zhuangzhi Sun's comparison of China's and Central Asia's transition economies makes especially interesting reading. From this it is clear that, from the Chinese perspective, the Central Asian states have made many mistakes in their transition to a free market economy, especially concerning ownership strategies, price reform, and entry into the ruble zone. Sun emphasises the importance of a gradualist approach to economic reform which reduces any negative effects on society as a whole. The chapter by Salitsky and Fisyukov echoes this view to a certain extent and argues that the 'Chinese model is appropriate for Central Asian states' (p. 168). The importance of trade from the Chinese perspective is also demonstrated by Qingjian Liu's piece where he sees a second Euro-Asian continental bridge in the making between China and Central Asia. Another feature of interest is the importance of telecommunications in the development of the region. Also of value here is the presentation of a series of problems for Central Asian trade which include antiquated trading practices, inadequate investment, and chaos in cross-border trade. The challenge in the coming century, for Liu, lies in overcoming these difficulties. The final section of the book deals with security issues. The Chinese view is expounded by Guangcheng Xing. This rests upon four pillars: nuclear security, the resolution of border disputes, military cooperation, and Central Asia's multilateral security arrangements. Of all these, the latter category is the most demanding for China. Xing writes that the presence of Central Asian states which participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace on China's borders is something to be taken seriously. The Russian view is expounded by Lounev and Shirokov. This deals with the foreign policy of the region and its relationship with overall strategy. Of note here is the role of China, which seeks to ensure stability and prevent the spread of radical Islam, especially in the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous region. Overall, this book stands out as a major contribution to the literature on Central Asia. It should be read by anyone with an interest in the region. University of Reading CHRISTOPHER M. WYATT R. J. Crampton, Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century-and After. Second Edition. London: Routledge, 1997, xx + 526 pp., ?50.00. Richard &amp; Ben Crampton, Atlas of Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century. London: Routledge, 1997, xv + 297 pp., ?16.99. THE SECOND EDITION of Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century coincides with the appearance of a handsome atlas, the joint work of Crampton, an Oxford Balkanist, and his journalist son. We shall discuss each work in turn. The author defines Eastern Europe as 'those countries which were under Soviet domination after 1945' (p. xi), omitting the territories formally incorporated into the USSR. (Despite this, however, Crampton does devote intermittent attention to the Baltic states, though Ukraine and Belarus are largely ignored.) This terminology makes the fact of Soviet control the sole determinant in classifying the nations of the area, a problematical definition of a large and quite 1497</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS differentiated region. Within this geographical realm, Crampton emphasises politics, particu- larly domestic affairs, whilst international relations, like economic and cultural developments, are given rather short shrift. Organisationally, Crampton provides a brief survey of each country according to a rather curious anthropomorphic chronological system of six stages. The first, 'childhood and infancy', is essentially the interwar period, with occasional forays into the World War I era. This of course omits a substantial portion of the 20th century which, notably, the author posits (debatably) as commencing with the Young Turk revolution of 1908. 'Adolescence' begins with the international financial crisis of the 1930s, followed by 'adulthood', which corresponds to World War II and the following years of Stalinism, thus awkwardly straddling two dissimilar eras. The years 1956 to 1968 witnessed a so-called 'middle age', apparently signifying relative stability of the various communist regimes. 'Old age' ensued until 1980, which was terminated by the 'cardiac arrest' prompted by the Solidarity movement. This system is rather unfortunate, for many reasons: it suggests a uniformity of developments more apparent than real, as well as needlessly jettisoning a rather more obvious periodisation. Moreover the applicability of the terms to the troubled history of the area in the moder era is not persuasive. Apparently the author wishes to make the common communist experience the basic organising principle of his work, but how this organically is linked to pre-1945 developments is neither explicit nor even understandable. What secret teleology makes the collapse of communism in, say, Hungary, a senectitude organically linked to an infancy represented by Admiral Horthy? Moreover, a country by country approach does not accord conveniently with the broad 'ages' the author insists characterise the century. Whereas Crampton should be commended for attempting an innovative organisational scheme, it has been less than successful. The author's decision to emphasise domestic affairs is defensible given the frequent tendency of works on European history to treat the East as a mere arena for the Great Powers' foreign policies; it does, however, have drawbacks. First, foreign affairs were a dominating reality for modem Eastern Europe, but the author's brief forays into this subject are often excessively elliptical (for example as regards the Locarno treaty, or the Teschen dispute). Second, the reader is occasionally led precipitately into a welter of the arcane specifics of domestic politics, a daunting journey for the uninitiated. This is the more unfortunate as the volume is intended for the general reader rather than the specialist. A more analytical and less descriptive discussion of domestic politics, omitting many of the myriad and often ephemeral political parties, factions and wrangles, would allow the reader to follow major trends without becoming lost in cascades of essentially insignificant specifics. Crampton devotes particular and highly competent attention to Balkan affairs, but his treatment of the other parts of the region is rather uneven: passages of keen insight conveyed by vigorous language alternate with frequent factual errors, misleading formulations, garbled spellings and strange nomenclature. The reader's confidence in the essential reliability of the text is immediately undermined by a reference, in the very first sentence, to 'Constantine's splitting of the Roman Empire in 395' (!) (p. 1). In a section of less than three pages long dealing with Poland before 1919, for example, we have a distressingly high frequency of slips and oddities. First, 1905 would have been a useful point of departure for analysing 20th-century Poland but its significance goes un-noted. The famous apocryphal quotation attributed to Pilsudski has him getting off the tram labelled 'socialism' at the stop marked 'independence', not 'nationalism', as Crampton writes misleadingly. Pilsudski's association of 'riflemen' was not founded in 1907 and was certainly not 'a terrorist organisation', but a cadre of a future army (p. 9). Witos was not a leader of the populist movement in the 1880s, as the text implies, but emerged later. The 'Polish Military Organisation' and the 'Polish Legion' were not the same. There is a particularly dense knot of errors about one event in 1914 alone: the Russian government made no promise to 'reconstitute a Polish kingdom' in that year: Dmowski was not 1498</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS then one of the 'members of the Russian Duma', and the Polish National Committee, then founded in Russia, did not later transfer itself to Paris; the 1917 committee of the same name in Western Europe was a separate organisation. The Polish Military Organisation was not dissolved in July 1917 but, on the contrary, began its most intensive period of activity thereafter. Chelm, given to the Ukrainians at Brest-Litovsk, was not part of 'eastern [sic] Galicia'. The list, unfortunately, could be expanded. Later entries concerning Poland are similarly error-filled, but the point is already clear. Despite these many annoying blemishes, Crampton's analysis is generally sound and persuasive. In a work covering so wide an area, no one author could be unfailingly competent. However, the frequency of problems seems high even given the difficulties involved. Nonetheless, there are a number of excellent sections: the discussions of interwar Hungary and Bulgaria, for example, though foreign policy matters are slighted. There are also engaging analytical interludes-like that regarding communism, fascism and antisemitism in the interwar era (pp. 152-176)-in which Crampton discusses significant themes. Whereas I do not always find the author's arguments persuasive, these are generally well handled sections and do much to make the work not a mere catalogue of disparate events but a thoughtful analysis of integrated developments. On balance, the volume wins the reviewer's grudging respect despite its flaws. It contains much good writing and persuasive analysis and tries, often successfully, to be thorough and balanced. While its merits are substantive, its defects could be markedly reduced by correcting the many minor slips and providing a more felicitous organisational structure, or at least a more persuasive justification for the one adopted. The companion volume, Atlas of Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century, is rather more than the title suggests. In addition to a very large number of maps, many quite unusual, it boasts a vast amount of statistical information, charts, tables and graphs, as well as a very considerable text which forms, in cumulation, a condensed history of the region. The organisational structure of the Atlas is more straightforward than the textbook's, with the following major divisions: pre-First World War, the peace settlements, the interwar period, the Second World War, the communist era, and the post-1989 world. Each has the anticipated political and topographical maps, but also numerous graphic representations of economic, demographic and other factors. Indeed, there are perhaps too many charts, graphs and summaries. For example, the curious 'Assassinations in Eastern Europe' (pp. 42-45), is both incomplete and pointless. Given what has been included, the addition of a handful of historical maps, showing the evolution of boundaries, would have been most useful. The extensive accompanying text suffers from the same tendency as the textbook to include too many minor inaccuracies. A virtually random sampling yields the following: the 1894 Franco-Russian pact was not the 'Dual Alliance' (p. 11); the organisation of the Uniate Church in Poland-Lithuania was not a result of diplomatic rivalry with the Habsburgs (p. 5); Petlura did not join the Poles in invading Ukraine in 1919, it was 1920 (p. 35); in 1939 the Soviets gained more than just former Russian territory by acquiring Eastern Galicia (p. 135), etc. There are many misspellings of names and geographical terms and some curious omissions, for example, the Greco-Turkish war does not appear among 'interwar international incidents and disputes'; perhaps this is due to a strict interpretation of the authors' definition of 'Eastern Europe'. Indeed, the text is so extensive that the utility of the Atlas as a supplement is problematical. While insufficiently detailed to serve as a history of the region, it is needlessly duplicative if used in addition to the textbook. For the specialist, however, it is a most handy reference: an indispensable collection of otherwise scattered and hard to locate demographic, economic and other statistics regarding the east of Europe in the 20th century. 1499 St John Fisher College M.
