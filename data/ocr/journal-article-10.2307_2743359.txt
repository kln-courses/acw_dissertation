All rights reserved OOII-32o4/87/28o5-0002$2-5o The Westermarck- Freud Incest-Theory Debate An Evaluation and Reformulation' by David H. Spain The traditional view that Westermarck and Freud held utterly op- posed ideas about incest is here rejected. It is argued, instead, that their views were far more similar than is usually acknowledged and, moreover, that their theories can be combined to yield a more comprehensive model. This new synthesis is used in the evaluation of certain classic cases in the anthropological incest literature, including especially the studies by Wolf and Shepher of marriage in Taiwan and Israel, respectively. It is argued that these cases are not decisive for the Westermarck-Freud debate. Several key arguments against a psychoanalytic formulation of the prob- lem are also evaluated, as is the tendency to cast their debate in "nature-nurture" terms. DAVID H. SPAIN iS Associate Professor of Anthropology at the University of Washington (Seattle, Wash. 98I95, U.S.A.). Born in I939, he was educated at The Ohio State University (B.A., I96I; M.A., i962) and at Northwestern University (Ph.D., I969). He graduated from the Seattle Institute of Psychoanalysis in June I986. He has done fieldwork in West Virginia and in Nigeria, and his research interests include psychocultural studies, research methods, and Africa. He is coeditor of (with William M. O'Barr and others) Survey Research in Africa (Evanston: Northwestern University Press, I973) and (with Mark A. Tessler and others) Tradition and Identity in Changing Africa (New York: Harper and Row, I973), coauthor of (with J. Brim) Research Design in Anthropology (New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, I974), editor of The Human Experience (Homewood, Ill.: Dorsey Press, I975), and author of "Configuration and Character in American Anthropology: A Reconsideration," in Crisis in Anthropology: View from Springhill, edited by A. Hoebel, R. Currier, and S. Kaiser (New York: Garland, i982), and "The First Cultural Thing" (Ethos, forthcoming). The present paper was submitted in final form i v 87. The two camps need standard-bearers, symbols to play their appropriate moral roles in a fable that rapes history for modern messages fed as pap to stu- dents. STEPHEN JAY GOULD, "The Archaeopteryx Flap" It is widely believed by anthropologists and others that there are two broad and opposing types of incest/ inbreeding-avoidance theories. One type is said to be consistent with bioevolutionary theory and to hold that humans tend to avoid inbreeding and/or incest both be- cause this is consistent with individual fitness aims and because a natural aversion to such acts emerges between people who live in a close, intimate relationship, espe- cially in childhood. The other is said to be consistent with psychocultural theory and to hold that humans tend to avoid inbreeding and/or incest both because this is consistent with individual psychosocial needs and be- cause incest taboos are effective restraints on innate im- pulses to commit incest. McCabe (I983), for example, suggests that there are two basic incest theories and sets out to differentiate them in terms of the "underlying motivations" which bring about incest taboos. One the- ory, which she and most others associate with Freud, supposedly holds that "women and men are naturally inclined to mate within the family, that is, with those with whom they experience intimate childhood associa- tion," while the other, associated with Westermarek, is said to argue that "such propinquity or familiarity breeds sexual disinterest/aversion" (p. 51).2 In this essay, I attempt to show that this widely held view is inaccurate, that our failure to recognize this has led to many sterile debates, and that a reformulation of the Westermarck and Freud positions on incest/inbreed- ing-avoidance in humans can serve as a fresh starting point for both rethinking some old issues in this field and exploring some new ones. The presentation is in three parts. In the first, I build on the fact that both Freud and Westermarck claimed that childhood associa- tion produces an aversion to incest/inbreeding in hu- mans and argue that although their theories differ in many ways, Freud did not directly oppose Westermarck by arguing that childhood association produces a desire to mate with close relatives. I also present a synthesis of the core ideas in the two theories. In the second part, I analyze specific cases in the recent anthropological incest/inbreeding-avoidance literature and show that many intellectual battles have been waged needlessly because the commonalities of the Westermarck-Freud theories have gone unrecognized and/or unacknowl- edged. In the third part, I discuss several theoretical is- i. I am indebted to many friends and colleagues who read one or another of the previous drafts of this paper. I should particularly like to mention, with much appreciation and thanks, the helpful suggestions and encouragment provided by Bob and JoAnn Camp- bell, Bob Caplan, Val Daniel, Robin Fox, Howard Gale, Gene Hunn, Chris Leininger, Michael Owen, Seymour Parker, Bobby Paul, Daniel Rancour-Laferriere, Werner and Jeannette Schimmelbusch, Mel Spiro, Arthur Wolf, and Pierre van den Berghe. 2. McCabe does suggest (p. 5 6) that "despite the divergent views of Freud and Westermarck, they both recognized the importance of childhood intimacy," but she fails to develop this idea. Here again, however, her discussion is representative of the literature, since several commentators have made such crucial observations but, for one reason or another, stopped short of showing how the two theo- ries may be linked (for an extended discussion of some possible reasons for this pattern, see Spain n.d. a). 623</page><page sequence="2">624 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 28, Number S, December 1987 sues that bear on the viability of Freud's controversial incest theory and offer a few concluding remarks about the character of debates such as the one being reex- amined here. The Westermarck-Freud Debate In The Red Lamp of Incest, Robin Fox came very close to achieving one of his most worthy goals: getting "the Freud-Westermarck thing" out of the way (Fox I980:50). Although his book has been widely and well received, it is apparent from essays published since I980 that "the Freud-Westermarck thing" has not faded into oblivion. Rather, in one way or another, this ancient debate con- tinues to plague the anthropological collective mind-if anything, more than ever before. To me, this is a puzzle. To others, apparently, it seems that nothing could be more sensible. Wolf and Huang (I980:I43), for example, assert that the Westermarck and Freud theories are pre- cise "opposites," and van den Berghe (I983:91) links Freud with an ancient, outmoded "cultural determinist orthodoxy" and Westermarck with modern sociobiology (the new orthodoxy?).3 Most telling of all, perhaps, are Shepher's (I983:3) claims that "the basic dispute in in- cest theory is between Freud and Westermarck" and that their debate represents "a dispute central to the behav- ioral sciences: the nature-nurture controversy." It does appear that a huge impetus to the debate about the Wes- termarck-Freud debate is the dubious idea that the na- ture-nurture debate is important. Putting the nature-nurture issue into so central a posi- tion in this debate is doubly in error. The Westermarck- Freud debate is not a version of the nature-nurture de- bate, and nature and nurture are not "opposites" about which there can be useful controversy. One reason for this attempt to suggest a possible synthesis of their posi- tions, therefore, is to clear the way for more useful dis- cussion. I agree with Fox that the biggest thing blocking the way to a new perspective on human incest/inbreed- ing avoidance is the Westermarck-Freud debate as it is currently (mis)understood. A more realistic conception of it will, however, call for far more than Fox's admirable attempt at a synthesis. The key to resolving the debate is almost embarrass- ingly simple and obvious. Unfortunately, such a solu- tion has not been sought because the belief that the two theories are unalterably opposed has been so well en- trenched for so long. Although there are undoubtedly many ways to begin the effort to get out of this rut, I will start by noting what the debate is not about. The Wester- marek-Freud debate is not about whether there is an aversion to incest/inbreeding, whether childhood experi- ences are related to the onset of such an aversion, or whether the aversion became a species characteristic by some evolutionary process. Rather, it is, or at least should be, about the character and particulars of the aversion-inducing "mechanisms." That this is so is sup- ported by a brief review of the core elements of the in- cest theories proposed by Westermarck and Freud. Edward Westermarck first offered his explanation of why humans avoid close inbreeding in i89I in his an- thropological magnum opus, The History of Human Marriage. Along with many observers of the human scene after I 8 5 9, he explained the historic origin of what he termed "the want of inclination for, and positive aversion to, sexual intercourse between persons who from childhood have lived together in that close inti- macy which characterises the mutual relations of the nearest kindred" in terms of natural selection (Wester- marck i922[i891]:236). With Darwin as his theoretical guide and scores of ethnographic tidbits gleaned from the library of the British Museum to back him up, he concluded that "in this, as in other cases, natural selec- tion has operated, and by eliminating destructive ten- dencies and preserving useful variations has moulded the sexual instinct so as to meet the requirements of the species." He accounted for the individual development of this "want of inclination" by invoking what many have termed the childhood propinquity or co-social- ization effect-the role of childhood intimacy in induc- ing in co-reared individuals a "remarkable absence of erotic feelings" (i922[i89i]:I92). And, he adds, "in this, as in many other cases, sexual indifference is combined with the positive feeling of aversion when the act [incest] is thought of." In short, the theory has two major elements: (i) an instinctual aversion effect, a positive development that originated in the species through spontaneous variation in the human sexual instinct and was preserved by natu- ral selection; and (2) a childhood-propinquity effect-the emergence of the instinctual aversion in individuals as a product of intimate co-socialization. Sigmund Freud offered his first extended statements concerning why humans avoid close inbreeding in 1913 in his anthropological magnum opus, Totem and Taboo. Along with Westermarck and many other observers of the human scene after I859, he explained the historic origin of what he termed the "horror" of incest in terms of Darwin's theory of evolution as augmented by, among others, Lamarck, Haeckel, Atkinson, Ellis, and Frazer. With Haeckel's Law (the recapitulation hypothesis), the Lamarck/Darwin assumption that acquired characteris- tics could become part of the germ plasm, and the Dar- win-Atkinson model of the "primal horde" to guide him, and with scores of clinical tidbits gleaned from his psychoanalytic practice to back him up, Freud described the historic origin of an aversion to incest in some detail. This description, "as every anthropologist knows" (to paraphrase Lord Macaulay), centered on his fanciful 3. For van den Berghe, it is clear that the problematic social science orthodoxy is psychoanalysis in general and Freud's views on incest in particular. It is a bit surprising that he, as a sociobiologist, should be so hostile to psychoanalytic theory, since Freud himself was an early supporter of the "selfish-gene" idea. In his classic paper "On Narcissism: An Introduction" (I9I4:78), he explicitly noted that individuals are but appendages to their germ plasm. More recently, Rancour-Laferriere ( I 98 I, I 98 5) has shown how the two theoretical positions are related.</page><page sequence="3">SPAIN Westermarck-Freud Incest-Theory Debate | 625 "primal-crime" scenario (Freud 1913:141-42). He ac- counted for the individual development of this "horror" by invoking his concept of the Oedipus complex and allied issues and principles of psychosexual develop- ment. Again, "as everyone knows," the Oedipus com- plex quintessentially involved the ambivalent feelings children have regarding their parents. As Freud saw it, a vital part of psychosexual development was coming to terms with such feelings-particularly castration anxi- ety. It was this, he argued, that fostered superego forma- tion, a critically important development because a major component of superego is an aversion to incest. In short, the theory has two major elements: (i) a primal-crime effect-the establishment in the species of guilt and various taboos in response to the primal parricide, effects which Freud thought were passed on by Lamarckian inheritance; and (2) a psychosexual- development effect-the establishment in individuals of a "horror" of incest by means of castration anxiety and the internalization of parental values in the course of resolution of the Oedipus complex. For years, and to most observers, it has been obvious that these two theories are not alike. When more than their core elements are considered, it is abundantly clear that the theories differ in many ways. It is perhaps even more obvious that the originators of these ideas appear to have seen them as fundamentally different. Freud's critique of Westermarck's theory rests heavily on Frazer's famous "Why taboo something that people won't do anyway?" critique, although he does toss in this blunt put-down of his own for good measure (1913:123-24): the findings of psycho-analysis make the hypothesis of an innate aversion to incestuous intercourse to- tally untenable. They have shown, on the contrary, that the earliest sexual excitations of youthful human beings are invariably of an incestuous character and that such impulses when repressed play a part that can scarcely be over-estimated as motive forces of neuroses in later life. Westermarck, in response, is no more impressive. In the first place, his comments about Freud go unmentioned in the detailed "Contents" (which in the i922 edition seem to substitute for an index) and are all but lost in a footnote (Westermarck i92.2[i 89I]: 204n). Westermarck quotes a German version of the above lines and says, in reply: That the results of the so-called psycho-analysis are destructive to my theory is a supposition for which I must see some evidence before I can take it seriously. In Dr. Freud's terminology, "sexuelle Regungen" [sexual excitations] may imply mental states very dif- ferent from the desire for sexual intercourse; and the study of neurotic persons can hardly be regarded as a safe guide to the proper understanding of the nor- mal manifestations of the sexual instinct. Dr. Jung, Freud's most distinguished disciple, says (Collected Papers on Analytical Psychology, p. 23I; cf. Idem. Psychology of the Unconscious, p. 463), "I am able to attribute as little strength to incestuous desires in childhood as in primitive humanity." That, in essence, is it. And for well over 50 years the whole of the social sciences, it seems, has been arguing over which of them won the "debate." I believe not only that neither of them did but also that neither of them really understood or appreciated the richness of the other's point of view. Moreover, I suspect that this has been true for many others engaged in the debate about the debate. It may be useful, therefore, to consider briefly two of the most basic ways in which Freud and Westermarck appear to have misunderstood each other. Freud, it appears, mistakenly considered Wester- marck's theory a mere tautology. For example, just be- fore his discussion of it he made this observation (1913:122): "to explain it [the horror of incest] by the existence of an instinctive dislike of sexual intercourse with blood relatives-that is to say, by an appeal to the fact that there is a horror of incest-is clearly unsatisfac- tory." Westermarck, for his part, apparently either over- looked or did not credit Freud's distinction between un- conscious and conscious impulses. For whatever reason, he was unable to appreciate that Freud did not believe that the outcome of normal child development was a desire to mate or have sex with family members but held precisely the opposite view. A Synthesis and New Perspective Before offering a new perspective on the Westermarck- Freud debate and, in the process, a possible synthesis of their incest theories, we must take note of Niko Tin- bergen's persuasive argument to the effect that four levels of explanation are required for a complete ac- counting of any biobehavioral phenomenon. A valuable summary of this view has been provided by Daly and Wilson (1978), who give the four levels the following names: (i) ultimate, (2) proximate, (3) ontogenetic, and (4) phylogenetic. The key to the synthesis of Wester- marck's and Freud's incest theories is that each theory emphasizes only two of the four explanatory levels and, more important, that these pairs do not overlap.4 "Proximate" cause, say Daly and Wilson (I978:9, fol- lowing Tinbergen), "concerns the direct mechanisms that bring something about." It is, for example, an ac- count of the structure and organization of an individual animal so as to explain how "different environmental factors and events influence behavior in particular ways." "Ultimate" cause "concerns adaptive signifi- cance-that is, . . . its selective consequences which must ultimately entail reproductive consequences." These are, I believe, the two levels of explanation em- 4. Although the fact of these differences does not appear to have engendered the Westermarck-Freud debate itself, it may partially account for the debate about the debate.</page><page sequence="4">626 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 28, Number 5, December I987 phasized by Westermarck. On the "proximate" level, he says there is something about the way humans are struc- tured that accounts for the effect of a particular feature of their environment, which he called propinquity or intimacy among family members (the effect, of course, is a "positive aversion" to incest/inbreeding). On the "ulti- mate" level, he bases his argument on the then- controversial idea that natural selection conferred an adaptive advantage upon individuals so structured as to be able to respond to the environment in the way he described in his proximate-level explanation. "Ontogenetic" cause is couched in terms of "develop- ment within an individual life span" (Daly and Wilson I978:io), while "phylogenetic" cause "is an account of the evolutionary progression by which the behavior has been formed out of some preexisting organization." These unquestionably are the two levels of explanation emphasized by Freud. On the ontogenetic level, Freud proposed that human infants develop by passing through a series of "psychosexual" stages, culminating in the Oedipus complex.5 On the phylogenetic level, he pro- posed his infamous primal-crime scenario. To some, these four explanatory levels may seem so distinctive as to preclude combining the Westermarck and Freud theories. It is important to note, therefore, that "explanations in terms of ultimate causation and phylogeny are intimately related" (Daly and Wilson I978:IO)-so much so, in fact, that at times it can be difficult to tell them apart. The subtlety of the difference as well as another important observation about these levels can be seen in the following remark by Daly and Wilson (emphasis added): The former [ultimate cause] is concerned with the functional significance of behavior-with what it is for and with the consequences that are relevant for its maintenance by natural selection. Phylogeny is con- cerned with the raw material out of which the behav- ior evolved-the preexisting behavioral organization from which natural selection has been able to sculpt the behavior in question. In practice the phylogenetic level of behavioral explanation has been relatively neglected.... This level is the most difficult of the four to investigate and the one about which we know the least. In addition to showing how similar the phylogenetic and ultimate levels of explanation seem to be, the empha- sized lines may indicate at least one of the reasons for the difficulty people have in understanding the signifi- cance of Freud's primal-crime scenario (Paul I976 repre- sents a notable exception). A synthesis of the Westermarck and Freud theories- one that I think both could accept, at least as a basic premise, and, more important, one that is more nearly complete in Tinbergen's sense-may be phrased as fol- lows: The way humans are anatomically structured and organized and the way they grow and develop causes an aversion to inbreeding and incest to be established by about the age of six. The capacity to develop such an aversion emerged in the distant past under biosocial cir- cumstances typical of pre-Homo sapiens primates and was preserved in the species by natural selection. Al- though certainly capable of being refined, in part by more theoretical work and in part by more research, this new perspective can be given something of a test by applying it to a review of some recent contributions to the literature on the Westermarck-Freud incest-theory debate. Anthropological Studies of Incest/Inbreeding Avoidance Many anthropologists see the Westermarck-Freud de- bate as an epic struggle that can have only one victor because the theories are exact opposites: Westermarck claims that familiarity breeds contempt and Freud that it breeds attempt. I have argued that this view is a distor- tion, suggesting that the two theories are the same in several fundamental ways and can be merged to form a new and more nearly complete basic explanation for the human aversion to inbreeding/incest. I now review some relatively recent anthropological studies of incest/in- breeding avoidance in humans from this perspective, first because the new perspective helps to shed some light on the strengths and weaknesses of these studies and second because this assessment helps to clarify some of the points raised in the course of presenting the synthesis. FOX ON WESTERMARCK AND FREUD Fox pioneered the effort to integrate the incest theories of Freud and Westermarck. Wisely noting that antago- nists in debates often seem to talk past each other, he set out to see if a new idea could be "distilled from the vapor of the two old and steamy ones" (Fox i980:20). His first steps, like mine, were to summarize the two theories, place them side by side, and look for commonalities. Although he concluded that the two theories were "complementary" (p. 22), a great improvement over then current opinion about this matter, I believe that the basis for his opinion was not the same as mine. Because the key ideas in his presentation were first expressed almost 25 years ago (Fox i962), it seems essential to consider first whether his views and mine differ. Fox not unreasonably summarized Westermarck's the- ory this way (i980:20): "childhood propinquity--posi- tive aversion--prohibitions," where "prohibitions" in- cludes exogamy rules and incest taboos. He then summarized Freud's views as follows (p. A2): "strong de- sire-&gt;stem prohibitions." Fox next aligned the two schematic summaries and, in an effort to "achieve har- mony" (p. 2i), concentrated on their "logical progres- sions." The comparison looked like this: S. Freud's (1905) Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality contains one of the earliest of his statements about the significance of these years.</page><page sequence="5">SPAIN Westermarck-Freud Incest-Theory Debate | 627 Westermarck: childhood propinquity--positive aversion--&gt; ({ ) prohibitions Freud: ( ~)---)strong desire-- stem prohibitions He then filled in the blanks (p. 22), claiming that in so doing he had integrated their views: childhood propinquity---positive aversion-- (lax) prohibitions (childhood separation)-*strong desire-- stem prohibitions This comparison is interesting and does lead to some useful reassessments of otherwise puzzling ethno- graphic cases (e.g., the Pondo, Chiricahua, Tallensi, Trobriands, and others [pp. 29-5 I]), but neither in his views as to how the two theories are alike in certain basic ways nor in his comments on how their com- plementarity explains human incest and inbreeding avoidance does Fox go as far as I do. His efforts were a major step forward, but it appears that he may have missed the opportunity to make suggestions of the sort I am proposing because his summary of Freud's theory at this point is incomplete. To Fox, Freud complements Westermarck merely with regard to the amount of child- hood contact and the severity of incest prohibitions. The key features of the ontogenetic theory, however, are overly condensed, and the other core element of Freud's theory, the phylogenetic hypothesis, is completely ig- nored here.6 SHEPHER ON MARRIAGE IN THE KIBBUTZ The late Israeli sociologist Joseph Shepher first came to the attention of most anthropologists when his kibbutz sex and marriage data (Shepher 197I) were summarized by Fox (1980:48). Fox used those data, following Shepher, to argue for a critical period in which incest avoidance is "imprinted" in children. Although a bold claim, it was bolstered by massive numbers: 2,769 mar- riages from 2 I I kibbutzim. The vital fact emerging from this study was that only I4 marriages involved couples who had come from the same peer group and only 5 of these involved persons who had been in the same peer group prior to six years of age. More telling still was the fact that in none of these cases had the individuals been reared together throughout the first six years. Armed with these data, Shepher (I983:59-6I) claimed that he had "a strong case for Westermarck's instinctive avoid- ance theory" as well as for his own "imprinting" hy- pothesis. Shepher's work is very important but for rea- sons he seems not to have appreciated. Some of these may be seen if one keeps in mind how similar the Wes- termarck and Freud theories are. Three issues will be considered here: Shepher's antipathy to Freud's views, some unfortunate definitional decisions, and his inter- pretation of the "six-year-period" data. Antipathy to Freud's views. In the introduction to In- cest: A Biosocial View, Shepher is disarmingly candid about his first exposure to Freud. It occurred in I939, the year both Freud and Westermarck died. Then in the seventh year of Gymnasium, Shepher found Freud to- tally convincing, particularly with regard to his ideas about repression and the unconscious. Buoyed by his discoveries, Shepher attempted what few have suc- ceeded in doing: self-analysis. As he puts it (I983:3), "I tried unsuccessfully to recall my father's fierce reaction to my infantile sexual love for my mother. I watched out for symbolic dreams and Fehlleistungen that would re- veal my unconscious longings . . . and failed." And, al- though he apparently continued to agree with Freud for a time, his support eventually and clearly waned. By the time we get to chapter 8 of the book, Freud's incest the- ory is all but ready for the scrap heap. Critics of Freud, of course, may find comfort in this, but it appears that this deep antipathy prevented Shepher from appreciating one of his own more promising insights about Freud's the- ory. This occurs as he raises questions stimulated by a lengthy passage in Totem and Taboo in which Freud attempts to account for the retention of the taboo estab- lished by the brothers after their primal crime. Shepher, citing the original German, claims that Freud was un- doubtedly thinking of genetic inheritance, but he asks (P- I 37), "if a predisposition toward feeling guilt is inher- ited, and if it has only 'to be given some sort of impetus' in the individual, why was Westermarck [seen by Freud to be] wrong in speaking of 'an innate aversion to sexual intercourse between persons living very closely together from early youth'?" This is an excellent question, but instead of attempting to answer it Shepher judges Freud "negligent about the sort of 'impetus' needed to activate his inherited disposition toward guilt." Freud was no doubt negligent about many things, but this surely was not one of them. The whole of his psychosexual theory and of his claims about the Oedipus complex has to do with this "impetus." Having dismissed Freud with this stunning wave of the hand, Shepher moves on to other matters, thus missing the opportunity to show that in- deed Freud and Westermarck were heading in the same direction here. The definition of incest. Two of Shepher's most basic definitional statements are quite problematic. The first of these is made in the context of his attempt to decide whether all sexual encounters involving close relatives should be seen as incest or whether the term should refer only to sexual intercourse. His answer is brief and re- vealing: "Sexual relationships may include kissing, hug- ging, stroking. If we consider them incestuous, then hardly any nuclear family is without incestuous rela- tions. It would be better to agree that incest is sexual 6. These comments should not be taken to mean that I consider The Red Lamp of Incest of little value. On the contrary, I view it as a very important study not only of incest theories but also of hu- man behavior generally. Despite Fox's opening claims to the con- trary, the goal of merging the Westermarck and Freud theories is far less central than his more successful effort to integrate ethological and sociocultural theories (cf. Fox I985).</page><page sequence="6">628 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 28, Number 5, December I987 intercourse" (p. 26). The second instance occurs when he considers the question of homosexual relations. He is slightly more expansive on this point and, among other things, notes that the decision on the matter "depends on our theoretical approach." He continues: "If . .. we think that incest regulations arose to prevent inbreed- ing, then we can neglect homosexual intercourse which, being sterile, does not produce interbreeding." These definitional statements indicate Shepher has chosen the wrong title for his book. Where he uses the word "in- cest" he should have used "inbreeding," since this clearly is what he is discussing (chapter 7, which he sees as his "decisive contribution" [p. 5] and which is the creative heart of the book, is a sociobiological tour de force on inbreeding avoidance). It is doubtful that one can fairly assess the relative merits of two theories (Shepher's stated objective) if the discussion is predi- cated on definitional statements that exclude the very data that one of those theories emphasizes. The six-year critical period. Shepher is rightly famous for having obtained extensive data showing overwhelm- ingly that co-reared, co-socialized kibbutz youth do not marry each other. As he notes (P. 59), "in a large popula- tion from all over Israel which shared a system of sociali- zation, there were no marriages between people who had been continuously reared together for their first six years. This avoidance and aversion could not be attrib- uted to prohibition or taboo." These data of Shepher's may be among the most important in the history of the anthropological study of incest, but, contrary to his claims, they are not of significance for the Westermarck hypothesis alone. Rather, they are at least as important for psychoanalytic theory, because that six-year period is the same one Freud placed at the center of his own incest theory. That the data were gathered by a scholar who was so clearly anti-Freudian and, apparently, antipsychoana- lytic makes the finding all the more significant. What it is about those six years that is important and how that may relate to sexual behavior, including or excluding marriage, is not indicated by Shepher's study. Although he does say that the imprinting7 during those critical years "must be triggered by a set of factors in the envi- ronment" and that "the tactile relationships of the chil- dren constitute the environmental circumstances" (p. 6I), such musings hardly stand as an alternative to the whole of psychoanalytic theory, which rests heavily on detailed studies of the varied circumstances of those critical years. Summary. Where it is biosocial in orientation, Shepher's book is fascinating. It is unconvincing, how- ever, regarding two vital points: (i) the definition of in- cest, which is weak because it leaves out the role of meaning in determining what a human behavior is (a problem that may account for much of the hostility to some versions of sociobiology), and (2) the claims about the six-year "critical period," which are wide of the mark because he is both so critical of Freud's theory and so committed to the erroneous notion that it was the antithesis of Westermarck's. In spite of these and other less significant shortcomings, his work must be regarded as one of two modern classics in the anthropological incest literature. The other is Wolf's study of sim pua marriage in Taiwan. WOLF ON MARRIAGE IN TAIWAN Arthur P. Wolf's pro-Westermarckian sympathies emerged progressively in a series of articles (Wolf I966, I968, and I970) based on data that were expanded and more thoroughly analyzed in Wolf and Huang's (I980) monumental Marriage and Adoption in China, I845- 1945. Among the many lines of inquiry pursued were questions about the demographics of sim pua marriage. In sim pua or "minor" marraige, the bride is adopted by the groom's parents when she and he are infants or small children. In the years prior to their presentation to the ancestors-the final step in the marriage ceremony- the two live together as siblings. In "major" marriages, in contrast, the bride and groom typically do not know each other at all and meet for the first time on their wedding day. Because the amount of intimacy prior to marriage varies dramatically in these two forms of mar- riage, Wolf and Huang felt that they had an unusually good opportunity to settle the Freud-Westermarck dis- pute. Believing that a vital question in the field was whether or not persons reared together show low mutual sexual interest, Wolf and Huang reasoned that a first step in their inquiry would be to develop a measure of sexual interest. Three indirect indicators were ferreted out of the data available to them: fertility, divorce, and adultery rates. They reasoned that where intramarital sexual interest was predicted by theory to be low or ab- sent, one should find lower fertility and higher rates of divorce and adultery.8 Their hypothesis was that couples in sim pua marriages, having been reared together, would show lower sexual interest than individuals in the major form of marriage. The support for this hypothesis appears to be over- whelming. Numerous alternative hypotheses (see, e.g., their discussion of the alternatives offered by Rosen- blatt, Harris, and Hammel [pp. 170-76]) were noted and tested, and none were supported. Fertility was lower and divorce and adultery rates were higher in couples reared together as brother and sister. Although Wolf and Huang exhibited appropriate caution in urging us to refrain from concluding that they had proved that A causes B (p. 349), they were more than willing to see their data as supporting Westermarck's theory alone. This latter view can be sustained, however, only if the Westermarck and Freud theories lead to different predic- 7. Shepher does not, by the way, make a very convincing case for applying the term "imprinting" to a period lasting as long as from four to six years. 8. Although the census takers during the Japanese occupation of Taiwan were among the most thorough ever, they did not provide Wolf and Huang with their data on adultery. These data were gath- ered by Wolf during relatively recent field studies (see Wolf I970 for a discussion of this part of the study).</page><page sequence="7">SPAIN Westermarck-Freud Incest-Theory Debate | 629 tions. As we have seen, the grounds for this common view are suspect. Having accepted the idea that the debate between Freud and Westermarck centered on whether or not there was an aversion to incest/in- breeding, with Freud answering no and Westermarck yes, Wolf and Huang considered their strong evidence of an aversion support for Westermarck's theory alone. But Freud's theory also postulates an aversion. Indeed, all incest theories do, because the aversion is what all theo- ries are trying to account for. The aversion is not some sort of "mechanism" whose efficacy is to be demon- strated; it is, rather, what needs to be explained. In short, and just as in the case of Shepher's study, Wolf and Huang's research provides very strong support for Freud's hypothesis. That it does so has generally been unrecognized or unacknowledged. SPIRO ON THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX A notable if somewhat surprising example of this mis- reading of Wolf and Huang's evidence is found in Mel- ford E. Spiro's recent book on the anti-Freudian, anti- Oedipus arguments of Malinowski (Spiro i982). Because he goes to considerable lengths to refute the sim pua and kibbutz cases, which appear to be at least as supportive of his own psychoanalytic views as they are of anything else, it would appear Spiro too sees Freud and Wester- marck as being on opposite sides of a very important fence. The sim pua case. Instead of showing how the sim pua case is supportive of psychoanalytic theory, Spiro raises objections which, in tone and form, come across as largely technical complaints about one facet of Wolf's attempt to explain why divorce and adultery are higher and fertility is lower in sim pua couples. He suggests, for example, that these rates have little to do with sexual aversion and instead may be the result of factors such as abuse of the girl by her adoptive family, the hostility of the little brother-husband, and/or the feelings expressed by the participants that such marriages are vulgar and inferior. At the same time, however, he overlooks the generally successful efforts by Wolf and Huang to test such alternative hypotheses. Moreover, what Spiro does not say about the Wolf and Huang study is at least as surprising as what he does say. It is curious, given his psychoanalytic preferences, that he says nothing regard- ing their citation (I980:I76-77) of a Chinese novel by Chang Wen-huan about sim pua marriage that contains a vivid passage pertinent to a Freudian account of why an aversion emerges during the critical six-year period of co-socialization. Here, as in other parts of their book, Wolf and Huang appear to be reluctant to exploit fully the theoretical potential of their materials, preferring to "leave for the future the question of why intimate child- hood association aroused a marked, sustained aversion" (Wolf and Huang I980:I76, emphasis added). After rais- ing this vital question-the question that really should be at issue-they present Chang's fictional account, not- ing dryly that, it "provides several intriguing hypothe- ses." The account focuses on the way a seven-year-old boy ridicules his toddler wife-sister, to whom he says one day, "Wei [oh!] ... you don't have a penis" (Chang 1976, as cited in Wolf and Huang I980:177). Chang then de- scribes the response of the girl, Hsiu-ying, this way: Ridiculed by older brother, Hsiu-ying looked between her legs and felt neglected. It was true. She was like a peach that had been cut in half and squashed. Some- times older brother raised his penis and urinated high in the air. Other times he knocked younger sister down and made her cry. They were like siblings, and they were also opponents.... Often they have no sexual interest in each other, and so when the day they are to be pushed together comes, the boy runs away. This is one of the tragedies poor families expe- rience in trying to get wives for their sons. Wolf and Huang leave it to others to decide what the point of this citation is. A materialist, it is reasonable to suppose, might pick up on the comment about poverty. Westermarckians might find the point in the remark that the children had no sexual interest in each other, though this hardly seems to answer the why question. A Freudian or a psychoanalytically oriented observer of virtually any stripe would surely react to the obvious castration themes-both the overt joy expressed by the boy, who, to his obvious relief, still has his penis, which he flaunts by urinating high in the air, and the "neglect" felt by the girl, perhaps because she senses she did not get something she wishes she had-a penis perhaps or, more likely, whatever it is that a penis symbolizes for her. Such an observer would also be likely to note how the author of this story (unconsciously?) links castration anxiety to the sexual aversion between the boy and girl. That Spiro should have missed the opportunity to point this out serves to indicate how powerful the effect can be of assuming that Freud and Westermarck were utterly at odds. Although it may be a somewhat more subtle point, especially given the way the story is presented by Wolf and Huang, it also may be noted that Spiro does not comment on the age of the boy. Assuming normal devel- opment, he would be nearing the end of the Oedipal years and on the threshold of latency. More to the point, he is approximately at the age when he should have es- tablished an aversion to sex with those he has been reared with, according to the data of the Shepher and Wolf and Huang studies. Curiously, Wolf and Huang do not comment on this point either, and this in spite of the fact that (contra Shepher I983:66) they do bring up the subject in their study. Thus, in their chapter on divorce, they provide impressive empirical evidence that there was a steady "decline in the divorce rate as one moves from unions that fulfilled the condition of intimate and prolonged childhood association to those that did not" (p. I87). Their data indicate that the critical shift in di- vorce rate occurs when comparing couples brought to- gether before the husband's fourth birthday with couples who met after his eighth birthday (2o.2% vs. 9.7%; 203 and 124 marriages, respectively). Comparable data for</page><page sequence="8">630 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 28, Number S, December I987 non-sim pua marriages showed no difference in the di- vorce rate (p. i88). As they note later (P. 345), age of association is only one of a number of variables that seem to have had a bearing on the character of the rela- tionship between persons in sim pua marriages. Noting that "intimate childhood association is a gross term," they express the hope that more refined analyses in the future will permit them to "isolate its active compo- nents." With this sentiment I am in wholehearted agree- ment. The kibbutz case. Spiro begins his assessment of the kibbutz case by acknowledging that sex and marriage are quite rare among co-reared kibbutz youth-findings first reported by him in i958 (Spiro i958:347-48). He con- tinues by noting how he had then interpreted this, sug- gesting that it indicated that members of the peer group "repress their sexual feelings for each other" (i982:i52). Subsequent studies of kibbutz children by Bettelheim (I969) and others lend considerable support to such a view. But such conviction as they may have on this point cannot rule out Shepher's view of the same facts, since it is consistent with them, too. Perhaps sensing this, Spiro turns to a review of the particulars of "the crucial data on sexual socialization" (p. 1 5 2). In a key footnote (p. i 5 sn), Spiro argues, contra Fox (ig80:chap. 2), that the aversion seen in the kibbutz peer-group members is the result not of sheer physical interaction in childhood but of "sexual prohibition at adolescence in the face of powerful sexual stimulation." Thus, "the sexual stimulation leads to sexual arousal, which is frustrated by sexual prohibitions, and the re- sulting painful tensions are defended against by repres- sion and reaction formation which, if effective, lead to sexual aversion." Although all but lost in the footnote, this argument is far more effective than the critique of Wolf 's empirical argument in the sim pua case because it is an attempt to specify why the aversion emerges. It must also be noted, however, that except for timing, this process is virtually the same as the one described not only by Fox, who is in part the object of Spiro's criticism here, but also by Freud, who, of course, was the inspira- tion for Fox on this point. In essence, he is describing one important component of the Oedipal experience- frustration in the face of unfulfilled sexual wishes. Summary. Of the studies being considered here, only Spiro's is propsychoanalytic, and yet it too gets a mixed review. His criticisms of the Shepher and Wolf and Huang studies are misdirected largely because he seems to have assumed that he had to show them to be flawed or risk undermining the foundation of his own rather elegant discourse on anthropological myths about Oedipus in the Trobriands. Although this is understand- able, given the traditional views of the nature of the Westermarck-Freud debate, it should be apparent that the impact of this erroneous notion was negative in this instance, too. MC CABE ON MARRIAGE IN LEBANON Another interesting study hindered by an erroneous view of the Westermarck-Freud debate is Justine McCabe's (I983) analysis of data on first-cousin mar- riage obtained during fieldwork in Bayt al-'asir, a small Sunni Muslim village in southern Lebanon. She sees the effort as having yielded "yet another human society ... which may be added to the data accumulating in favor of Westermarck" (P. 57). Her presentation has four main points. First, she shows that the father's brother's daugh- ter-father's brother's son and sister-brother relation- ships are very similar. Second, she argues that the tradi- tional view of marital sexuality, which emphasizes the need for strong male dominance and extreme female pas- sivity and lack of interest, is not a simple cultural ideal but more of a rationalization (my term) of "the type of relationship [spouses] already have 'naturally' as pater- nal first cousins" (p. 6i). Third, she shows that divorce is higher and fertility lower in father's brother's daugh- ter marriages-a result paralleling Wolf's data from Taiwan. Fourth, she invokes Fox's attempt (i962, I980) to reconcile the Westermarck and Freud positions and compares the fertility and divorce rates of the different kinds of cousin marriage, since the persons involved have typically had different amounts and kinds of child- hood association. The data available from her study are consistent with this hypothesis. Because Freud's theory also suggests that an aversion to incest/inbreeding will be established in humans by the age of six or so, McCabe's data obviously do not constitute support for Westermarck's theory alone. It is important to note in this context, therefore, that she does not claim that she knows what mechanism might produce the aversion. Instead, she twice expresses her uncertainty about the matter: "Whatever the actual bio- psychological mechanisms are by which intimate child- hood associates are encouraged to be sexually disinter- ested in each other as adults . . . ," and, a bit later, "evidence for the Westermarck contention that, for whatever reasons, intimate childhood association ap- pears to . . ." (pp. 63-64, emphasis added). In short, this study (which has also been criticized on other grounds [see, e.g., Dodd and Prothro I985 and McCabe's i985 response]) is less valuable for the data it presents than for its hint that the data are not very perti- nent to the decisive issue-the nature of the aversion- inducing mechanism. BURLING ON MARRIAGE AMONG THE GARO Another study that is of interest more for what cannot be concluded than for what can be is Robbins Burling's report on an unusual form of marriage among the Garo of northeastern India (Burling I985). For various social and economic reasons, the Garo encourage certain young men to marry widows who, depending upon cir- cumstances, either have daughters or will later acquire them by adoption. It is expected that the man will even- tually cohabit with his wife's daughter, who, from the outset, is technically one of his wives ("The new hus- band simultaneously acquires two wives who stand in the relationship of mother and daughter to one another" [p. I3AI). Indeed, those involved see this as an induce- ment for him.</page><page sequence="9">SPAIN Westermarck-Freud Incest-Theory Debate I 63I Although Burling sees the situation as relevant only to Westermarck's hypothesis, this "case" is mostly hy- pothetical, for, as Burling makes quite plain, he is unable to present statistical data of the sort marshaled by Wolf, McCabe, and Shepher in support of the Westermarck hypothesis. Indeed, the data regarding the amount of sexual interest exhibited by such couples are quite frag- mentary. This perhaps accounts for the fact that it is only in the subtitle of the essay that Burling asserts that his data support that hypothesis. In the essay itself, he says merely that he "hopes" his data "will seem sugges- tive" (p. 130), and, in the face of several seemingly happy father/adopted-daughter couples, he rather cautiously concludes that perhaps "Westermarck's belief in the de- velopment of an actual 'aversion' to sexual relationships ... may have been too strong" (p. 132). Ultimately, his lack of statistical data permits him only to provide a few ambiguous anecdotes-ambiguous because, as he himself notes (p. 132), the apparent nor- mality of the marriages can be seen as running counter to the usual (and also erroneous) readings of Wester- marck's "aversion" hypothesis-and make the logically obligatory prediction that new data on Garo families should show that such marriages exhibit "problems" with "greater than average frequency" than other mar- riages (pp. 131-32). In short, the Garo "case" offers vir- tually no support for Westermarck's (or any other) hy- pothesis. Burling's report, therefore, takes on value primarily as evidence of the lengths to which some an- thropologists seem willing to go to support Freud's os- tensible nemesis. VAN DEN BERGHE ON "INCEST" Pierre L. van den Berghe, in a series of publications II979, I980, i983), has argued vigorously for Wester- marck's hypothesis. His most recent paper on this sub- ject, "Human Inbreeding Avoidance: Culture in Na- ture," is essentially an assessment of the implications of the sim pua and kibbutz data for the debate about hu- man incest/inbreeding avoidance. He believes that these data, as well as those from infrahuman primates, "con- vincingly [refute] a century of cultural determinist or- thodoxy in social science" (I983:9I). As he sees it, this orthodoxy involves several basic theoretical views and a galaxy of social sciences luminaries from Levi-Strauss, Murdock, and Parsons to Malinowski, Frazer, and Freud. Although their views may have diverse secondary flaws, they all make the same basic error: they "accept the antithesis of nature and culture"; they "assume a radical discontinuity between humans and nonhumans, and make culture the mechanism whereby humans, by sup- pressing their animal nature, become unique" (pp. 9I- 92). He prefers to see culture as having coevolved "with genetic selection to maximize individual inclusive fitness" (p. 93) and argues that part of the "fitness- maximizing game is inbreeding avoidance" or, more properly, the search for "an optimum balance between outbreeding and inbreeding." Having made these mostly reasonable claims (some of the exceptions will be noted in due course), van den Berghe proceeds to a review of the relevant human and nonhuman evidence, with the "very special" (p. ioi) sim pua and kibbutz cases ostensibly leading him to several other rather reasonable conclusions-these about the character of the relationship between nature and cul- ture. For example, he concludes that "human sexual be- havior in general and inbreeding avoidance in particular are under both genetic and cultural control" and asserts that "the causal relationship between genetics and cul- ture is reciprocal" (p. ioo). So far, so good, but there is more. In particular, there is his confused and often illogical argument connecting these not unreasonable introductory and concluding statements. Two of the more fundamental problems are his lumping of Freud with the cultural determinists and his confusion of incest with inbreeding. Freud as cultural determinist. Although it was indeed Freud who saw "civilization" as the price we pay for keeping our instincts under control, this hardly makes him a cultural determinist. One might overlook this mistake on van den Berghe's part, since it is so common, but it leads him to three conclusions that, in light of the foregoing discussion, seem questionable: that Freud and Westermarck were on opposite sides of a nature-nurture debate, that the sim pua and kibbutz data provide sup- port for Westermarck and against Freud, and, finally, that there is "no better ground on which to join the controversy" between sociobiology and the social sci- ences (p. 9 I). "Incest" as "inbreeding." Van den Berghe follows Shepher (1983) and defines incest as "heterosexual coitus between postpubertal, consanguineal relatives with an r 3 .25 " (p. 94). Unfortunately, what he is in fact defining here is "inbreeding." Moreover, he confuses these two concepts throughout the vital middle portion of his paper. One consequence is his delusion that some- thing significant has been said about incest in his review of sociobiological arguments about inbreeding avoid- ance. He first confuses inbreeding and incest in a section entitled "Human Outbreeding Practices." The first words of this section are "The incidence of incestuous behavior in humans" (p. 93, emphasis added). He then proceeds to review the literature in an effort to come up with an estimate of the frequency of "incest" in human groups. He concludes that "sensational accounts of 'epidemics of incest' "are dubious and that, while "it is probable that growing numbers of children are exposed sexually to step-relatives . . . this is hardly inbreeding" (P. 94, emphasis added). Apparently sensing that some- thing is amiss in this argument, he continues (emphasis added): The narrow definition of incest just given will, of course, offend many students of the subject, espe- cially the moralists. Perhaps the best way to reconcile the moralist's and sociobiologist's view of incest is to say that the two are not concerned with the same thing. The moralist views "incest" as a reprehensible form of behavior, doubly so when perpetrated by adults on children, and is concerned with the psycho-</page><page sequence="10">632 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 28, Number S, December I987 logical and social consequences for the victim. The sociobiological view presented here is concerned with the reproductive consequences of inbreeding and its avoidance. Thus, behavior that is not at least poten- tially reproductive is inconsequential for a theory based on evolution by natural selection. No moral implications are drawn. I could not agree more. It is a pity not only that van den Berghe does not keep this, in mind as he works through the remainder of his essay but also that he does not consider its implications. He perpetuates the muddle on the very next page when he discusses the kibbutz and sim pua data, noting that in both cases "a pseudo-incest avoidance develops between the unrelated children" (p. 95). What he means, surely, is that these are potential pseudo-inbreeding situations which, for some reason or reasons, are avoided. Why should he make this slip? There are many possible answers, of course, and more than one may ap- ply. I believe, however, that at least a partial explanation involves the tendency of some sociobiologists to slip back and forth between, to borrow a phrase, nature and culture. Sometimes they speak of a bit of human behav- ior in descriptivist, ethological terms-e.g., using lan- guage of the sort one would expect when describing the behavior of a school of guppies when the population is in fact Yuppies in a school. At other times they use terms that are not only anthropomorphic but also, and more precisely, cultural-e.g., the reverse of the first example. In this instance, he slips (a Freudian slip?) from nature (inbreeding) to culture (incest). The same thing happens with his use of the term "sib- ling." He cites a large-scale study by Weinberg (i955) in which only 6 of 37 cases of sibling incest involved a stable bond, and in all these cases "the siblings had been separated from early childhood" (p. 96). People who do not live together as siblings in the cultural sense of the term may very well never experience each other as sib- lings in this sense. The cases cited, then, are examples of inbreeding (assuming that they had intercourse) but not necessarily of incest. This point can be made a bit clearer by considering adopted children-an example that happens also to lead nicely to a third place in van den Berghe's paper where the nature-culture confusion occurs. It is well known that children adopted in infancy experience those they consistently refer to as "father" and "mother" as impor- tant "relatives" (parents). Although common, it is most assuredly incorrect to say that adopted children experi- ence these individuals "as though they were related to them"-incorrect because they are related to them, emotionally, culturally, consciously and unconsciously. They are not, to be sure, closely related biologically in most instances, but for considerations of incest this fact is irrelevant. This matter emerges in van den Berghe's paper with an additional very important twist. With the sort of sar- castic wit that has been his trademark, he offers this view of Freud's most famous idea (p. 98): In inventing the Oedipus complex, he [Freud] bla- tantly distorted Sophocles' story. Oedipus did not im- print against his mother because, as Sophocles tells us, he was separated from her in infancy and was raised by foster parents. The prophecy of incest was realized because the cultural norm of parents raising their own children was violated. The injunction not to tempt fate was merely a mystifying way of saying: "Don't buck the system." While Sophocles would probably have resisted my prosaic interpretation as threatening the grandeur of his play, I am convinced that he would have regarded Freud as an inspired crackpot. Although Freud may have made things difficult for some by using the Oedipus dramas to illustrate the Oedipus complex, it is hardly correct to say that he "blatantly distorted" the story. That van den Berghe thinks he did is once again evidence that he is confusing culture and nature-or, to put it a bit more precisely and concretely, that he fails to notice that the word "mother" has two referents: Oedipus's biological mother and his foster mother. The significance of this slip is as follows: First, although we can agree that Oedipus did not "im- print" on Jocasta, it simply cannot be argued that Oedipus (or, to be more literal, a real person in circum- stances such as those attributed to this character in Sophocles's play) would have imprinted on no one. Rather, he would surely have imprinted on his foster mother. Second, psychoanalysis has demonstrated to all but its most stubbom critics that feelings associated with the persons ("parents") who raise a given individual may be transferred to, displaced onto, or associated with other people who are not "parents" in this sense. Third, given the character of primary-process thinking, such symbolic transfers or associations are all but completely unrestrained by reality-that is, under some circum- stances, virtually anybody or anything can be seen as the equivalent of a parent. Finally, it seems obvious that certain basic features of an individual-for example, age and sex-can enhance the likelihood that certain people will induce certain associations. In the case of Oedipus, therefore, it may be argued that Jocasta was merely one of the spoils of his victory over Laius until he leamed that she was his biological mother, at which point she became the emotional, psychological equivalent for him of his foster mother, on whom he had imprinted. The Oedipal drama rests on this psychological process-one rooted in certain biologically constrained facts in the childhood of Oedipus (and everyone else). It should be evident, then, that the events of the Oedipus plays do faithfully dramatize how critically important the child- hood years are. Moreover, since both the Westermarck and Freud theories have something to say about that period, it is a story relevant to each. It is unfortunate, arguably, that Freud writes about the Oedipus story in a way that makes it difficult for some to appreciate that the most significant facts are the psy- chological, not the biological ones. But, as van den Berghe suggests, some may simply prefer a more prosaic</page><page sequence="11">SPAIN Westermarck-Freud Incest-Theory Debate 1 633 interpretation. Freud obviously preferred emphasizing his belief that incest violations ordinarily induce tre- mendous guilt feelings in people and, moreover, that this is a central fact of the human condition. In sum, the problematic outweighs the probable in van den Berghe's essay. Like Shepher, he is strongest when talking about inbreeding avoidance, and within this nar- row range he is better when he avoids both the Wester- marck and Freud theories-the former because it does not seem to help him and the latter because he does not seem to understand it. Overview, Discussion, and Conclusions Of the various issues raised so far, four constitute the core of the presentation. First, contrary to received wis- dom, the Freud and Westermarck incest theories are not unalterably opposed nature-vs.-nurture models. Instead, in form and content both are nature-and-nurture theo- ries. Both use biological assumptions to speak to species and individual issues, and both postulate that certain things must happen during development in childhood if an effective barrier to incest is to be established. More specifically, both Freud and subsequently the supporters of Westermarck gathered extensive data which indicate that a barrier to incest is ordinarily established by about six years of age. Second, once again contrary to the expectations of most, a synthesis of the Freud and Westermarck incest theories can be achieved. Because Westermarck empha- sizes ultimate and proximate mechanisms and Freud phylogenetic and ontogenetic ones, their theories, taken together, constitute a more nearly complete and there- fore more useful explanation of human incest/inbreed- ing avoidance. Third, contrary to the expressed and implied claims of at least some supporters of each theory, the data now available from the kibbutz and sim pua cases simply cannot decide the Westermarck-Freud debate. The same must be said for similar cases of somewhat less re- nown-e.g., McCabe's study of father's brother's daugh- ter marriage in Lebanon. The reason is the same in all cases: the most basic discovery-namely, that co- socialized individuals seem to have lower conscious mutual sexual interest than do non-co-socialized indi- viduals-is predicted by both theories. Fourth, it is clearly essential not only to distinguish inbreeding from incest but also to note which theories can account for one, the other, or both. It is also clear that some who recognize this have at times forgotten it in the heat of battle and, as a result, have muddled sev- eral important theoretical debates. The debate about the Westermarck-Freud debate has lasted for far too many years. Although I cannot hope to prove it, this must in part be because of anthropology's ambivalence about Freud's admittedly controversial views.9 In the next few paragraphs, therefore, I consider briefly three of the more important questions that have been raised about Freud's incest theory. In so doing, my aim is only to suggest why it may be reasonable to take seriously the ideas of that "inspired crackpot." 1. Was the institution of an incest taboo a watershed event? That many see the Westermarck-Freud dispute as a nature-nurture debate is in part because Freud seems to have attributed watershed significance to the institution of an incest taboo. The textual basis for this is Freud's discussion of the primal crime, in which he clearly sug- gested (I 9 I 3: I42, I 5 6) that the incest taboo marked the beginning of human culture. Let it be noted, therefore, that I do not believe the imposition of an incest taboo was the (or even a) watershed event in human history, and that nothing that has been said here makes it either necessary or reasonable to try to sustain such a view. Incest taboos and all the rest of culture emerged through an evolutionary process and therefore are, in this sense, continuous with nature (cf. Arens I986, Parker I976). 2. Has not the "primal-horde" model been shown to be fundamentally wrong, and can it not be argued, there- fore, that Freud's incest theory is wrong too? Because Freud's primal-crime scenario is so fanciful, it has often been rejected out of hand. Some critics, however, per- haps recognizing a good myth when they saw one, have focused on the "inbreeding-horde" link in Freud's chain of argument. These critics have tended to assert that the comparative method is a weak basis for reconstructing human history and that modern primates are neither incestuous nor organized as hordes of the sort en- visioned by Freud (see, e.g., McCabe I985:56-57; van den Berghe i983:92; and, for an early version in which the weakness of the comparative method is emphasized, Kroeber I920). Three things need to be said about this argument. First, it rests heavily on one of the very premises it criticizes, the comparative method. Those who would reject Freud's conception of the primal horde can find comfort in the fact that modern primates rarely inbreed only if they are willing to use the comparative method to infer that primates ancestral to humans also did not in- breed. On this one point at least, Westermarck's sup- porters must do the very thing they criticize Freud for having done. Second, it overinterprets Freud in attributing to him the notion of an inbreeding horde. In fact, he built his argument on the suppositiQn that the junior males had been "driven out"-i.e., prevented from breeding-by the "violent primal father" (I9I3:I4I-42). Thus, the "brothers" (p. I4I) were (merely) excluded males who banded together to attack a dominant male who was exercising monopolistic control of available breeding fe- males. Because Freud also noted that the victorious brothers renounced the fruits of their triumph by (among other things) "resigning their claim to the women who had now been set free" (p. I43), some have presumed that Freud saw the dominant male as a routine in- breeder. But in fact he did not say the females were closely related to either the "father" or the "victorious brothers" but only that they were the "father's women." 9. Spiro's discussion of the Oedipal dimensions of the "making of a scientific myth" regarding the Trobriand case may also be perti- nent here (Spiro i982:I74-80; see also Spain n.d. a).</page><page sequence="12">634 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 28, Number S, December I987 In short, the scenario Freud presented was one involving competition between junior and senior males for the op- portunity to breed with available females, and this situa- tion is anything but rare either in nature or in sociobio- logical writings. Third, psychoanalytic theory does not and need not conceive of the unconscious as a sort of repository of pre- Homro sapiens urges that must be controlled-e.g., by strict cultural taboos. Urges there may be, but there is little basis for saying they have been carried unmodified into the H. sapiens line. This view is well expressed by Eagle (I984:II9, emphasis added), who suggests, regard- ing Freud's so-called sex instinct, that we "should view the manifestations of sexuality in terms of inbom sen- sory-motor patterns which, in the course of matura- tional development and learning, become organized into a structure we call the sexual drive." It would be more correct, he adds, to use the word "wish" where Freud tends to use "drive" or "instinct." To suggest this is akin to noting the importance of the distinction between in- breeding and incest. It is the latter that is the essence of the human scene. With Geertz (i965), I think it hard to conceive of a purely biological human nature. This is as true for psychoanalysts as it is for anthropologists. Hu- man nature is intrinsically cultural nature. This does not mean that biological factors are eliminated from an understanding of either human personality or culture. On the contrary, how can we hope to understand why we have the kinds of wishes (cf. instincts, drives) and taboos (cf. inbreeding avoidance mechanisms) that we do? In the conception I am arguing for, the old-fashioned nature-nurture question loses all significance. 10 I believe that Freud saw this, although this admittedly is difficult to perceive at times given his choice of words (and, per- haps, the way his ideas have been translated into English [on which see Bettelheim i982]). 3. What if there is no taboo against incest? Many have felt that Freud's theory differed fundamentally from Westermarck's because he seemed to accept the idea (as expressed, for example, in Frazer's nearly immortal line cited previously) that incest taboos were necessary to keep people from doing what their instincts would otherwise compel them to do while Westermarck's the- ory considers incest taboos to be little more than epiphe- nomena. It is this assumption, of course, that makes the sim pua and kibbutz cases seem so decisive for the so- called Westermarck-Freud debate. They are depicted as cases in which sex between individuals reared as siblings is not prohibited. Indeed, not only do the parents not prohibit marriage'' between co-socialized individuals but also, in at least one case, they insist on it. Given these circumstances and assumptions, it does seem that the two theories should be at odds. I am confident, however, that Freud would not have seen the sim pua and kibbutz cases (or any of the others mentioned in this regard) as instances in which there was no prohibition against co-reared persons' having sex with each other. In the first place, their behavior would have indicated to him that they had a "taboo." In the second place, there is no evidence that the individuals in question lacked superegos. Consequently, he would have been quite confident, as I think we can be, that they had internalized a prohibition against sex with persons understood by them (largely unconsciously) to be "out of bounds." Even if the merits of this argument are dis- puted (and there is empirical evidence that not all psy- choanalysts adopt this perspective when faced with the basic facts of the sim pua and kibbutz cases; see Spain n.d.b for a summary of these data), it still provides a basis for appreciating that the word "taboo" is defined very differently by anthropologists and psychoanalysts. When anthropologists use the word "taboo" they gener- ally have conscious, culturally articulated rules in mind. At times psychoanalysts also talk and think about taboos this way, but often, if not generally, they use the term to refer to a largely unconscious facet of the superego. The superego is commonly thought to be a repository of the cultural norms and moral principles of an individual's parents-versions, that is, of the con- scious, culturally articulated rules, prohibitions, and moral principles of a given cultural group that children are taught by their parents. Although Freud's own writings lend a certain plausi- bility to this latter view, it is nevertheless distorted in several ways. Perhaps the most significant of these is the largely implicit assumption that parents more or less actively teach children the rules that become inter- nalized in the superego. A more realistic view is that children actively create these superego-based, so-called moral principles out of experiences they have with par- ents and other significant persons during their childhood years-especially the years from two through six (see Sandler I960, Sandler and Rosenblatt i962). These ap- pear, moreover, to be ideas that they are biologically predisposed to create. As such, they are not unlike other "things" humans find it easy to learn (e.g., language "rules"). In this sense of the word, it truly may be said that individuals can determine only with some difficulty what it is they have made "taboo." If Freud had written more explicitly about taboos in this sense in Totem and Taboo, decades of misunder- standing might have been avoided. Since Freud and many others have already used the word "taboo" in print to refer, in varying contexts, to both cultural and psycho- logical "things," we simply must make the effort to de- cide which meaning is intended in a given instance. For a discipline long used to making similar determinations with its central concept (culture), it may be hoped that this will not be too difficult to do. Josephine Tey based one of her great mystery stories, The Daughter of Time, on the unraveling of a historic murder (Tey I95 ). Her fictional detective found that the more he delved into the "facts" that everyone accepted, the more he found they were not facts at all. Her char- acter refers to the situation as being another case of To- io. Accordingly, I am skeptical of the extreme anti- or nonbiolog- ical readings of Freud (e.g., Ricoeur I970, Schafer I976). i i. It may be questioned, of course, whether it is appropriate to rely on marriage data to test hypotheses about sexual behavior and thoughts.</page><page sequence="13">SPAIN Westermarck-Freud Incest-Theory Debate 1 635 nypandyism. The term derives from the town of Tonypandy in South Wales, where, in I9IO, certain political-economic events occurred that were not de- scribed by the press in the way they really happened. As Tey's detective put it (Tey I95I, as cited by Blank i968):12 "every single man who was there knows that the story [recounting the events] is nonsense and yet it has never been contradicted. It will never be overtaken now. It is a completely untrue story grown to legend while the men who knew it to be untrue looked on and said nothing." The Westermarck-Freud debate may have become, I fear, another case of Tonypandyism. The grounds for pulling their debate avway from this histor- ical black hole have always been in the literature, but for one reason or another they have not been utilized. Per- haps Gould's bitter comment about another famous de- bate, quoted here in the epigraph, provides some clues, or perhaps most of us simply prefer dichotomies. It is clear, after all, that the debate has been used routinely to invoke some major ones: science vs. mysticism, nature vs. culture, or good vs. evil (as in "our evil nature"). To my way of thinking, we demean the Westermarck-Freud dialogue if we see it primarily as a precursor to contem- porary so-called paradigmatic debates between socio- biologists and cultural anthropologists. Their views are far more subtle and useful than that. Comments PAUL JORION R. C. P. Psychanalyse et pratiques sociales, CNRS, 13 Place d'Aligre, 750I2 Paris, France. i2 vi 87 The Westermarck-Freud incest-theory debate is an im- pressive muddle, and it is Spain's merit to have cleared up some of it by having shown, first, that the two au- thors are dealing with different topics and, second, that their positions are not incompatible-that is, provided one assumes that Westermarck would have been pre- pared to admit that siblings' sexual avoidance- although commonly observed-is the ultimate conse- quence of a social process (its prohibition) and not of a natural one (e.g., pheromones). The first edition of The History of Human Marriage (i89I) at least (not referred to in Spain's paper) seems to support this view; here the supposed mechanism is clearly that aversion causes pro- hibition, which then accounts for the very few observed cases of infringement: "Aversion to the intermarriage of persons who live in intimate connection with each other has provoked prohibitions of the intermarriage of rela- tions . . ." (Westermarck I89I:330). Is it, then, possible in few words to contribute further to the clearing up? Yes, but in a quite schematic way. Let us restate the problem in a different manner: "What would happen if the universal prohibition on siblings' sexual intercourse were lifted? Would no brother ever have intercourse with one of his sisters? Would inter- course and ultimately marriage between siblings be- come common? etc." In other words, "Is the prohibition there to prevent what would otherwise be a common occurrence, or is it just there to prevent the occasional freak from having his devious way?" The obvious answer is that it is impossible to decide for lack of evidence: the prohibition is indeed universal. It should be stressed that Shepher on kibbutz children and Wolf on sim pua marriage provide no evidence on the issue, not even "side-evidence." Moreover, even if they did, there would remain the impossibility in a con- text of prohibition of separating facts that would reveal a "natural" aversion between siblings from facts that would simply prove the effectiveness of the prohibition. The logical flaw in Shepher is in considering that sib- lings are a sub-class of the category "children raised to- gether": there is more to it! The logical flaw in Wolf is that sim pua (meaning "little daughter-in-law," not "daughter"!) is a variety of pre-arranged marriage, and a nasty one: the girl is essentially treated as extra labour. Assigning a higher divorce rate in sim pua to the pseudo- sibling circumstances of the upbringing rather than to the pre-arranged and servile nature of this type of mar- riage is arbitrary. The subject of Spain's paper not being why sibling marriage should be forbidden, let us leave the issue en- tirely aside. But is it true that we have no evidence of a society in which sibling marriage (and a fortiori inter- course) was not forbidden? No, it is not, as we possess Hopkins's historical evidence on brother-sister marriage in Roman Egypt (I980). It is not for me to summarize this paper here; I will only mention that about half of the people who had the practical possibility of marrying a sibling did so. Whatever statistical or probabilistic treatment this figure can be submitted to, the proportion is certainly higher than what obtains through accidental circumstances. Saying (as I have heard) that this case is biased by the economic incentive there was at the time to marry a sibling is an unacceptable objection: how could it be that-kinship logic being here inoperant-all the other factors to which societies are commonly sub- jected (politics, economics, etc.) would not interfere here in their own way? "But why did only half marry?" someone may then ask. It does not require much imagination to realize that marrying one's sister or brother may look in every possi- ble environment like a moron's response to a potentially more interesting problem! More seriously, marrying one's sister or brother spares one the thrills of courtship and parade that enticing a stranger necessarily involves: there is "love" and "Love." Or, as Freud (I959[I92I]:72- 73) put it: There is abundant indication that being in love only made its appearance late on in the sexual relations between men and women; so that the opposition be- tween sexual love and group ties is also a late devel- I12.

One of the reactions to the parricide was after all the institution of totemic exogamy, the pro- hibition of any sexual relation with those women of the family who had been tenderly loved since child- hood. In this way a wedge was driven in between a man's affectionate and sensual feelings, one still firmly fixed in his erotic life to-day. As a result of this exogamy the sensual needs of men had to be satisfied with strange and unloved women. Thus, in Ptolemaic Egypt, 50% were taking some risks in loving the unloved and 50% were taking no risks by loving the already loved: a fair representation of human- kind, no doubt! R. DANIEL MURRAY Ohio State University at Marion, Marion, Ohio 43302, U.S.A. i8 vi 87 Researchers interested in this topic may benefit from Spain's article. Other than clarifying some historical de- tail, we have not progressed any farther toward resolu- tion of these issues. I agree that there are two broad and opposing theories on incest/inbreeding avoidance. However, I believe that one suggests biologically based proximate and ultimate causes for inbreeding avoidance and the other suggests that incest is avoided by cultural taboos with some sociological, psychological, demographic, or ecological ultimate cause. The current incest/inbreeding-avoid- ance controversy extends substantially beyond the Freud/Westermarck "debate," since only the latter au- thor discussed plausible mechanisms. I feel that Spain misrepresents our current state of research by identify- ing Freud's individual psychosocial needs and the result- ing taboos restraining these needs as one of the "two broad and opposing types of incest/inbreeding avoidance theories." Spain is not subtle in his attempt to rescue Freud from criticism, although a questionable scientific gain is made by convincing the reader that Freud has been mis- understood. Perhaps introductory statements addressing this issue in future publications will have greater clarity. ROBERT A. PAUL Department of Anthropology, Emory University, Atlanta, Ga. 30322, U.S.A. 26 vi 87 Spain has made an important contribution with this pa- per. He has clarified the Westermarck-Freud debate ad- mirably and proposed a formulation concerning incest that represents a synthesis of evolutionary, psychoanaly- tic, and cultural theory. I find little here with which to disagree, and much to applaud. In very astutely setting the debate within the context of Tinbergen's four levels of explanation, Spain has, however, stressed rather too much the complementarity that undoubtedly exists be- tween the two theories, while playing down the genuine conflicts that remain. It is certainly the case that the strength of the Westermarck hypothesis is that it pro- poses both an evolutionary goal (inbreeding avoidance) and a proximate mechanism (incest aversion) and that Freudian theory proposes instead a phylogenetic history (the primal-crime scenario) and an ontogenetic process (the libido theory and the Oedipus complex). Insofar as this is the whole story, it seems that an elegant synthe- sis of the two should be widely accepted. I want briefly to note, however, that Freud explicitly rejected both the ultimate and the proximate suggestion of Westermarck and that Westermarck's defenders, if not Westermarck himself, propose an ontogenetic mech- anism different from and in competition with Freud's theory. I want to show, mainly for historical interest, what Freud's objections to the Westermarck evolution- ary mechanisms were and to argue that, on this score, contemporary thought would certainly favor Wester- marck. At the same time, I will show that despite Spain's synthesizing effort, Westermarckians and Freud- ians will remain in serious disagreement over the ques- tion of the ontogenetic mechanism by which incest avoidance is acquired by individuals. Contemporary evolutionary theory and ethnological thought since Lorenz have made us familiar with behav- iors in which the proximate cause is only indirectly re- lated to the evolutionary adaptive goal and in which the ultimate goal is itself a product of natural selection, not of conscious foresight. The imprinting of goslings, made famous by Lorenz, works because of a proximal mecha- nism which in effect instructs the young organism to follow the first large moving object it sees; in the average expectable environment of geese in nature, the statisti- cal probability that this will be the mother goose is sufficiently high to produce adaptive results. Just so, by the Westermarck hypothesis, the instruction given at the proximate level concerning incest is "Inhibit sexual interest with others with whom you come into regular intimate contact between the ages of two and six." Once again, it is statistically likely that an adaptive result- inbreeding avoidance-will be the outcome. In Totem and Taboo (1913) Freud argues against Wes- termarck, using arguments which no longer seem valid. Against the explanation at the ultimate level, he writes (p. I124): "Nor can anything ... favorable be said of an- other, widely held explanation of the law against incest according to which primitive peoples noticed at an early date the dangers with which their race was threatened by inbreeding and for that reason deliberately adopted the prohibition." As I have said, evolutionary theory does not require that an adaptive practice be consciously instituted, but only that once instituted it be retained by natural selection. Against Westermarck's proximate-level argument, Freud writes (p. I23): "A biological instinct . . . would hardly have gone so far astray in its psychological ex- pression that, instead of applying to blood-relatives (in- tercourse with whom might be injurious to reproduc- tion), it affected persons who were totally innocuous in this respect, merely because they shared a common</page><page sequence="15">SPAIN Westermarck-Freud Incest-Theory Debate | 637 home." The importance of the work of Wolf, Wolf and Huang, Shepher, McCabe, and others lies in having pro- vided evidence that, on the contrary, coresidence seems to be the very device which phylogeny has favored in humans for the adaptive purpose of preventing inbreed- ing. And indeed it is easier to imagine a mechanism for "imprinting" housemates than for the much trickier task of actually recognizing blood relatives. Westermarck does not, to my knowledge, provide either a phylogenetic or an ontogenetic history for the acquisition of the behavior pattern of avoiding sexual relations with housemates. Freud, though not subscrib- ing to the propinquity theory, proposes both a phy- logenetic and an ontogenetic argument. His phy- logenetic hypothesis regarding the primal horde is not widely accepted as probable (but see my 1976 article to which Spain refers). Followers of Westermarck have not tended to accept the ontogenetic process described by Freud, which, as Spain observes, has long been available to fill the gap in their theory. This is because they tend not to believe it, although they are wrong, as Spain shows, to suppose that the sim pua and related findings constitute a refutation of it. As an example of what they do believe, I may cite as representative a passage from Havelock Ellis: "Between those who have been brought up together from childhood all the sensory stimuli of vision, hearing and touch have been dulled by use, trained to the calm level of affection, and deprived of their potency to arouse the erethistic excitement which produces sexual tumescence" (cited in Freud I9I3: I22). The mechanism of dulling of sensory stimulation is very much in contrast with the Freudian mechanism that likewise would produce incest aversion, namely, an intense libidinal bond with housemates (Freud would have said family members) that is repressed with the resolution of the Oedipus complex at age five or six, under the influence of the factors of shame, disgust, and morality that enforce the onset of latency. Freud's model is, in short, one in which the behavioral outcome is a compromise formation between a sexual impulse that has undergone repression and countervailing psychic tendencies originating in the ego and superego, deter- mined by a subtle combination of phylogenetic, con- stitutional, cultural, and accidental environmental fac- tors. The Freudian model is dynamic and rests on a picture of psychic structure in which different agencies are in conflict. The Westermarckian view by contrast pictures a relatively painless and uncomplicated desen- sitization. The difference between these views is, as should be clear, not addressed by the empirical findings brought forward by Wolf, Shepher, and others. To decide between the two, research would have to investigate either the unconscious fantasies of individuals or the cultural sym- bolic projective systems and culturally constituted de- fense mechanisms in which individual unconscious mechanisms find expression. It seems to me that on this score there is little doubt of the great superiority of the Freudian theory in its ability to account for just such material while also generating the same incest avoid- ance behavior observed by the Westermarckians. In this short space I can only assert rather than argue that point. It is the merit of Spain's paper that it has reformulated the debate in such a way that the disagreements and paths for future research, evidence, and argument are much clearer and more productive than they were be- fore. FITZ JOHN PORTER POOLE Department of Anthropology C-ooi, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, Calif. 92093, U.S.A. 24 VI 87 In a fascinating and forceful essay, Spain has admirably demonstrated that the particular form of the historical contrast between the Freudian and the Westermarckian theories of incest-and the conventional linkage of the terms of that contrast to a dichotomous shaping of ideas of "nature" and "nurture"-has not only distorted and thus diminished both theoretical legacies but also con- strained and thus impaired anthropological insight into the phenomenon of incest and its psychosocial prohibi- tions. In suggesting that these two perspectives are both epistemologically and theoretically compatible and, in- deed, logically complementary, he claims that the his- torical opposition vis-a-vis Freud and Westermarck that has prevailed may be transcended in the forging of a synthesis of the ontogenetic and the phylogenetic (as emphasized in Freud) and of the proximate and the ulti- mate (as articulated in Westermarck). Despite the undeniable importance of Spain's argu- ment in reexamining and recasting a long-entrenched anthropological perspective on incest, however, the es- say remains more a prolegomenon to than a resolution of many of the central historical and philosophical issues involved in the so-called Freud-Westermarck debate. Indeed, a number of critical ambiguities remain unre- solved within Spain's argument. First, it has not been his- torically demonstrated that the rather thin and sterile "debate" between Freud and Westermarck is the sole, or indeed the primary, source of anthropological interpreta- tions of the differences in their perspectives on incest. A substantial case can be made for the greater prominence of their less rhetorical statements in the anthropological shaping of this historical legacy. Second, the historical appraisal of Westermarck must attend not only to points of theoretical commonality with Freud but also to a broader comparative assessment that encompasses both similarity and difference, focuses on construals of "na- ture" and "nurture" in the immediate post-Darwinian milieu, situates the "debate" within a wider set of in- quiries into the matter of incest (including Darwin, Durkheim, Frazer, Freud, Malinowski, McLennan, Mor- gan, and Westermarck), and appreciates the key impor- tance of Westermarck's Moroccan research and his monumental Origin and Development of the Moral Ideas (Westermarck 1971[I9o6-8]). Third, this wider historical debate on the subject of incest confounded and conflated not only incestuous sexuality and inbreeding</page><page sequence="16">638 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 28, Number 5, December I987 but also preferential and prescriptive rules of incest, ex- ogamy, and endogamy and variously allocated the do- main of incestuous sexuality to the realms of behavior, fantasy, biological necessity, social convention, or cul- tural perception. The myriad muddles in these inter- twined historical models must be carefully dissected and laid bare before their more recent interpretations and transformations can be properly understood. Beyond the historical intricacies of this fascinating case in the anthropological history of ideas, there are fundamental matters of epistemology and of theory yet to be unravelled. First, the comparative alignment of Freudian and Westermarckian views of incest requires a more elaborate evaluation of matters of epistemological compatibility and theoretical organization than is pre- sented. Only analytic attention to the broader theoreti- cal architecture of the ideas of Freud and of Westermarck on incest will illuminate the significant differences in the ways in which their senses of a "causal mechanism" are founded, constructed, and made operational in their analyses. Second, Tinbergen's "levels" of explanation not only require some explication in the context of the present argument but also need to be linked more explic- itly and coherently to a general acknowledgment of pre- cisely how they may be interwoven in the formal con- stitution of an explanation. Third, the interactive model that is implicated as the alternative to a dichotomous view of "nature" and "nurture3' requires elaboration in terms of the different entailments and consequences of each perspective. Fourth, Spain's interesting and poten- tially productive "synthesis" needs to be logically specified in a manner that avoids the ambiguities of characterizing the result as a synthesis founded on a complementarity, a merging, etc., and that elaborates the resultant model sufficiently to permit its use as a lens for examining the critical differences in interpreta- tion of those key cases that have loomed especially large in this "debate." A significant part of this attention to the model should be some discussion of the limitations of a dichotomous framework of the kind that has domi- nated the "debate." Finally, following Arens (i986), any theory of psychosocial aversion, avoidance, and prohibi- tion of incest must attend not only to matters of taboo but also to the prevalence and incidence of particular incestuous acts (and fantasies), and this "double" per- spective is of particular importance in comparing Freud and Westermarck. In summary, although I agree with the essence of Spain's statement, I believe that it is only preliminary and that much historical and philosophical unravelling of key issues remains to be done. These comments are offered in appreciation of his effort and with the intent of facilitating its proper elaboration. VIVIAN J. ROHRL Department of Anthropology, San Diego State University, San Diego, Calif. 92I82, U.S.A. 28 vi 87 This article represents a step forward not only for the solution of the "Oedipal riddle" but also for an- thropological theory, both in reconciling two seemingly opposite points of view and in helping to put to rest the nature-nurture controversy. The use of Tinbergen's four levels is an excellent way to build "middle-range" theo- retical statements into a more comprehensive overview, a task that many of us work on (see Rohrl I970, I972). Granting primate continuity, the incest issue becomes more complex, with many different strands and ram- ifications at the human level. The cognitive dimension would be particularly relevant in studying the human animal. For example, some statements of Malinowski (I93i) and Coult (i963) can be better understood in this context. Malinowski's argument in particular is based on the different roles between dyads in the nuclear fam- ily-"a house divided against itself cannot stand," and confusion of roles within the family would disrupt the comerstone of society. Issues of cognitive dissonance or ambiguity are brought up in the context of food taboos and the notion of pollution (see Douglas i966) and could contribute to the understanding of Malinowski's discus- sion of the necessity to avoid role confusion. The definition of incest still calls for refinement. Spain indicates that inbreeding among close relatives is not an adequate definition, and he also brings up the important difference between psychoanalytic and an- thropological definitions; he leaves dangling the issue of mating vis-a-vis marriage in a definition. Indeed, cul- turally defined (conscious) proscriptions of certain kin categories as marriage partners may prove to have a lot to do with understanding the nature and causes of the incest taboo. This is not meant to vitiate Spain's basic argument; his unraveling of this important "con- troversy" is an important step in the necessary direction for anthropological theory. PIERRE L. VAN DEN BERGHE Department of Sociology, University of Washington, Seattle, Wash. 98195, U.S.A. 27 v 87 Spain has performed perhaps the most daring of a long series of shotgun weddings between Freud and other so- cial science luminaries. The more unlike the parties to the wedding are, the greater the challenge. The similarities between Freud and Westermarck boil down to three: both thought that early childhood was impor- tant; both thought that behavior had something to do with biology; and both believed that the outcome of close early association was later lack of manifest erotic attraction and mating behavior. We are also offered the suggestion that the two misunderstood each other and would have agreed more if they had taken the trouble to read each other more carefully. Perhaps, but I doubt it, at least in the case of Freud, who always showed a low tolerance threshold for any deviation from his own tor- tuous concatenations of ideas, even on the part of his disciples. I have made no secret of my belief that Freud was the leader of a cult and that his "theories" have more in common with a credo than with a scientific para- digm. True, he operated on the fringes of medicine, bi-</page><page sequence="17">SPAIN Westermarck-Freud Incest-Theory Debate | 639 ology, and psychology, but, unlike Westermarck, who unequivocally associated himself with Darwinian evolu- tionary theory, Freud hitched onto the crude instinctual- ism of late igth-century psychology. I regard psycho- analysis as the most successful intellectual cult of the 2oth century, largely because it seems to provide an an- swer to the Socratic injunction "Know thyself." Self- understanding is the ultimate challenge for a brain that evolved to track its environment, not to fathom its own motivations. The reason I reject Totem and Taboo as a fable is that, like the entire psychoanalytical edifice, it is both factu- ally unsupported and unfalsifiable and seems absurdly farfetched and unparsimonious. Sure, little boys "love" their mothers (as do little girls). That is where their next meal comes from. It is probable that some of the neural pathways that reinforce that attachment are the same as those involved in adult sexuality. Why not economize on the proximate mechanisms that reward fitness- enhancing behavior? I do not object to calling what feels good "libido," except that the term explains nothing. As for conflicts between father and son, straightforward ex- planations based on control, authority, and competition over resources (including, often, access to women other than the mother) seem more plausible than Freud's fan- ciful account. Like Whitehead, I believe that a science that hesitates to forget its founders is lost. It matters little what Freud, or, for that matter, Westermarck, thought, except to his- torians of ideas. I simply spoke of the "Westermarck effect" because of the convention of attributing ideas to those who first put them down in print. There is a lot of strong suggestive evidence in favor of the Westermarck effect; there is none in favor of the Oedipus complex. The Westermarck effect is testable and falsifiable; the Oedipus complex is neither. Scientifically, there is no contest between the two ideas. And the two ideas, pace Spain, are very different: one is simple, straightforward, and generalizable to many relationships and many species; the other is tortuous, farfetched, and highly specific to the human mother-father-son triad (with a pallid female reflection in the "Electra complex"). With regard to my own work (and that of Shepher, which closely parallels mine), Spain makes three princi- pal points: (i) I allegedly fail to distinguish between in- cest and inbreeding; (2) I am allegedly concerned with inbreeding, not incest; and (3) the term "negative im- printing" is inappropriate for a phenomenon that takes years of close association to become established. The third criticism was made in earlier rejoinders to my I983 article, and I responded then, as I do now, that indeed the term (which I borrowed from Shepher [I97I]) is probably not a good one. I even concede that the Wes- termarck effect may be one extreme of a continuum whose other extreme is the erotic effect of novelty. Put more cautiously, it remains to be demonstrated that there is a qualitative discontinuity between the progres- sive decline in erotic attraction through familiarity and the Westermarck effect of lack of erotic interest after long, intimate early-childhood association. On Spain's first point, he himself provides the evi- dence, in his long quotation from my I983 article, that I do make a distinction between inbreeding and incest. The fact that I titled my article "Human Inbreeding Avoidance" does indeed indicate that my primary ex- planandum was inbreeding avoidance, not incest taboos. If my usage of the terms "incest" and "inbreeding" seems to make them sometimes interchangeable, it is because I was (and am) concerned not only with inbreed- ing avoidance but also with the interplay between in- breeding avoidance and the associated normative com- plex of incest taboos. That is why I subtitled my article "Culture in Nature." The context in which the alleged confusion provoked criticism not only by Spain but by some of the commen- tators on the article concerns the incidence of "incestu- ous" behavior. By some normative definitions, the inci- dence is relatively high. In fact, those claiming that incest is epidemic have a vested interest in broadening the definition of incest. My point was simply that the overwhelming majority of "incestuous" acts was not even potentially, let alone actually, reproductive and thus was evolutionarily inconsequential. Accessorily, I implied that the broad definitions of incest used by many writers on the subject were their own "etic" ones, not necessarily the "emic" one of the participants. My own narrow etic definition of incest is still not equatable with inbreeding, though it can potentially lead to it. No doubt, I could have distinguished more explicitly and clearly between incest and inbreeding, but I do make the distinction, and I am interested in both. For ex- ample, my I980 article on incest and exogamy and my I979 book make clear that the relationship between hu- man reproductive biology and normative culture is my central theoretical concern. I trust that this latest outburst of "sarcastic wit" on my part will not mar the friendly intellectual sparring that helped produce Spain's paper. Spain will remain convinced that our disagreement is rooted in my unre- solved Oedipus complex. I am confident in my assertion that I never had one. It is the essence of psychoanaly- sis that neither of us can prove the other wrong. Psychoanalysis, like theology, is resilient to scientific discourse. ARTHUR P. WOLF Department of Anthropology, Stanford University, Stanford, Calif. 94305, U.S.A. 24 vi 87 This is the second attempt by an anthropological match- maker to force a posthumous marriage involving the most unlikely of all couples, Edward Westermarck and Sigmund Freud. The first attempt failed, and the match- maker, Robin Fox, was forced to substitute a stand-in for Freud, as is apparent from the diagram reproduced in the present article. The causal sequence presented as repre- senting the Freudian point of view is nothing of the kind. It is just the negative condition in the Westermarck hy- pothesis. One gets "positive aversion" where there is "childhood propinquity" and "strong desire" where there is "childhood separation." Spain is a more persua-</page><page sequence="18">640 1 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 28, Number S, December I987 sive matchmaker, but he too fails and, like Fox, is forced to substitute a stand-in for Freud. Admittedly, Spain's Freud is a better fascimile than Fox's, but it is still not the real Freud. My argument is best presented by way of a careful examination of Spain's claim that "the kibbutz and sim pua cases simply cannot decide the Westermarck-Freud debate." As both cases involve "early and prolonged childhood association," there can be no doubt as to what Westermarck would predict. It would be "a remarkable absence of erotic feelings ... leading to a positive feeling of aversion when the act is thought of" (i922[i89i]:vi). The critical question is what Freud would predict, since Spain's conclusions all rest on the view that while they differed in many ways "both Westermarck and Freud claimed that childhood association produces an aversion to incest/inbreeding in humans." It should at least be noted that a case could be made for the view that Freud's theories do not even apply to such unique, contrived situations as those created by kibbutz nurseries and what I prefer to call minor marriages. The essence of the argument would be that his Lamarckian conception of how the experience of family life is trans- mitted makes it impossible for him to predict how peo- ple will respond to novel social arrangements. But let us forgive Freud his bad biology and concentrate on his psy- chology. Surely Freud would not predict the outcome of our test cases to be "a remarkable absence of erotic feelings." His entire psychology rests on the assumption that erotic attachments formed in early childhood endure to in- fluence later development. Thus when Spain argues that "both Westermarck and Freud claimed that childhood association produces an aversion" I take him to mean that in his view they both expected the outcome of childhood association to be an overt aversion or what we might better call avoidance. The question, then, is whether or not this is a fair extrapolation from Freud's premises. I think it would be if one saw Freud as arguing that the dynamics of the Oedipus complex result in a reliable, enduring repres- sion of a child's initial sexual choices. One could then argue, as Spain does, that while Westermarck and Freud differ as to how childhood association arouses an aver- sion to sexual relations, they are at least agreed that childhood association does arouse an aversion. The prob- lem is that on my reading, Freud did not see the repres- sion achieved by way of the Oedipus complex as either reliable or enduring. This is evident throughout his work but most unmistakably in his insistence that a jural pro- hibition of incest is an absolute social necessity. Civili- zation itself would be impossible without the incest taboo because society would be forever in danger of be- ing overwhelmed by riotous incestuous impulses. Freud first expressed this view in I897 in a manuscript enclosed in a letter addressed to Wilhelm Fleiss. Reflect- ing on the definition of "holy," he wrote (Masson I985:252): "Holy" is something based on the fact that human beings, for the benefit of the larger community, have sacrificed a portion of their sexual liberty and their liberty to indulge in perversions. The horror of incest (something impious) is based on the fact that, as a result of communal sexual life (even in childhood), the members of the family remain together perma- nently and become incapable of joining with strang- ers. Thus incest is antisocial-civilization consists in this progressive renunciation. This early private statement of his views was followed in I905 by an even more explicit public statement. Writ- ing under the heading "The Barrier against Incest," he declared (I977:148): Respect for this barrier is essentially a cultural de- mand made by society. Society must defend itself against the danger that the interests which it needs for the establishment of higher units may be swal- lowed up by the family; and for this reason, in the case of every individual, but in particular of adoles- cent boys, it seeks by all possible means to loosen their connection with their family-a connection which, in their childhood, is the only important one. Whatever doubts these statements leave as to Freud's view of the need for an incest taboo should be allayed by a statement made in I920. After characterizing as "pre- posterous" arguments attributing the incest taboo to the dangers of inbreeding or the inhibiting effects of child- hood association, he wrote (I953:220-2e): In both these cases ... the avoidance of incest would have been automatically secured and we should be at a loss to understand the necessity for stern prohibi- tons, which would seem rather to point to a strong desire. Psychoanalytic investigations have shown be- yond the possibility of doubt that an incestuous love-choice is in fact the first and the regular one, and that it is only later that any opposition is manifested towards it, the causes of which are not to be found in the psychology of the individual. Freud changed his mind about many things in the course of his long life, but he never gave up his view that the incest taboo was needed to constrain incestuous im- pulses. In I93I, at age 75, he wrote (i96i:5 I): The tendency on the part of civilization to restrict sexual life is no less clear than its other tendency to expand the cultural unit. Its first, totemic, stage al- ready brings with it the prohibition against an inces- tuous choice of object, and this is perhaps the most drastic mutilation which man's erotic life has in all time experienced. If, then, children normally choose as their first sexual objects members of their own family, and if "stem pro- hibitions" are necessary to prevent their acting on these choices, what can we expect of the situation created by kibbutz nurseries and adoption for minor marriages? These children are reared together, but they are not sub- jected to the constraints of an incest taboo. Far from it, they are encouraged to marry in the kibbutz case and required to marry in the Chinese case. How, then, can</page><page sequence="19">SPAIN Westermarck-Freud Incest-Theory Debate I 64I one possibly argue on Freudian grounds that the out- come will be avoidance prompted by some kind of aver- sion? In a footnote added in I9I5 to the I905 statement quoted above, Freud repeated his frequent claim that "psychoanalytic investigation shows . . . how intensely the individual struggles with the temptation to incest during his period of growth and how frequently the bar- rier is transgressed in phantasies and even in reality" (I977:148). What, then, would Freud expect to find if, instead of condemning these temptations, society en- couraged them, even to the point of insisting that a man marry his "sister"? Surely the answer has to be that he would expect to find the very opposite of the "positive aversion" predicted by Westermarck. The argument must be carried one step further. Sup- pose we ignore the evidence cited above and assume that Freud trusted the repression achieved by individuals. Would it then be fair to conclude, as Spain does, that my evidence from Taiwan "provides very strong proof of Freud's hypothesis"? Recall the plot of the Oepidal drama. A subsordinate male is attracted to a female con- trolled by a dominant male. The subordinate male kills the dominant male, regrets his act, and renounces the fruit of his violence. Or, alternatively and less dramat- ically, the subordinate male fears that the dominant male will punish him for his lustful thoughts and so represses those thoughts and identifies with his oppres- sor. The plot requires at least three characters: a passive, sexually receptive female (the role in which Freud cast most females), a dominant male determined to keep the female for his own use, and a subordinate male who would like to replace the dominant male. We might without doing too much violence to the ethnography cast the Chinese sim pua in the role of the passive, sexu- ally receptive female. And it would not be wildly inap- propriate to cast her fiance-cum-brother in the role of the subordinate male who would like to possess her. But where are we going to find someone to play the role of the dominant male who is determined to monopolize the female? The Chinese father/father-in-law will not do. Having known fathers who threatened to beat a son if he refused to consummate a minor marriage, I can imagine a particularly violent man's threatening his son with castration. But it would be for refusing to sleep with his "sister," not for lusting after his "sister." The point is that the conditions necessary for enacting the Oepdial drama were simply not present in the complex created by minor marriages. So long as he was willing to marry his "sister," a man had nothing to fear from his father. Thus even if we discount his insistence that a jural prohibition is necessary to maintain Oedipal repression, Freud is unable to account for the Chinese evidence. The fact that couples who were reared together resisted mar- rying even when forced by their parents does decide the Westermarck-Freud debate. It says that Westermarck was right and Freud was wrong. Reply DAVID H. SPAIN Seattle, Wash., U.S.A. 22 VII 87 I thank those who responded to my paper. Since the issues raised in the several communications exhibit lit- tle if any overlap, I will consider each in turn. Jorion apparently believes that the vital question is "What would happen if the universal prohibition on siblings' sexual intercourse were lifted?" and that the answer is provided by the behavior of Egyptians during the period of Roman rule. I, however, am not convinced that the Hopkins (i980) analysis-a marvel of diligent and fair- minded scholarship-represents a basis for sorting out the Westermarck-Freud debate. Indeed, Hopkins himself states (p. 308) that the two theories "may even be com- plementary." Confronted with the Hopkins data, Wes- termarckians would no doubt wonder how much inti- mate childhood contact the happily married sibling pairs had had and Freudians would wonder why there should be any surprise that some people periodically not only commit incest but also "institutionalize" it (at cultural and/or personal levels). Unfortunately, the data now available about Roman Egypt permit no more than the raising of such issues. As for Jorion's citation of Freud about love, I do not see how it is helpful in this context. We may hope that he will someday provide a fuller ac- count of his views on this. Murray thinks that I have been unconvincing except for some points of "historical detail." Although authors of CA comments are asked to comply with certain word limits, it does not seem that these would have prevented him from being more specific as to his basis for thinking I have misrepresented things by claiming that Freud's is generally thought to be one of two broad and opposing types of incest theory. Similarly, it would have been of interest to know why he thinks only a questionable scientific gain is made by showing that Freud has been misunderstood. Paul is correct in noting that I have, if anything, over- stressed the fact that the two theories are complemen- tary. I did so primarily because it seemed necessary to clear the air so that topics more specific and vital than the broadly (and badly) conceived "Freud-Westermarck thing" could be discussed. It is important to note in this regard, therefore, that one such issue is the character of the proximate mechanism. Paul is correct in his sugges- tion that the view of current Westermarckians about the sensory-dulling hypothesis (see, for example, Parker I984 and Parker and Parker i986) stands in opposition to the psychoanalytic one. In contrast to others, this would seem a subject that really can be fruitfully debated. Be- cause I have only alluded to this point (albeit several times), it is good that Paul has raised it explicitly. Although Paul is correct to note that certain of Freud's ideas in Totem and Taboo no longer seem valid, the views he cites are also interesting because they illustrate a fundamental contrast in mind-set not only between</page><page sequence="20">642 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY Volume 28, Number S. December I987 Westermarck and Freud but also between what provi- sionally may be termed "English" and "Continental" orientations to questions about the nature and origin of biological diversity. It is Darwin, of course, who em- bodies what I am here calling the English viewpoint. The central and enduring premise of this perspective is that small variations within a species coupled with the selec- tion principle constitute the seeds of that species's own "destruction" (i.e., gradual transformation). By contrast, biologists on the continent (including some who claimed they had adopted Darwin's view) preserved well into Freud's day their interest in "laws of form" (espe- cially regarding phylogenetic questions) in general and in the development of individual organisms (i.e., on- togeny) in particular. Exemplary in this regard are the embryological studies of von Baer and Haeckel (com- pare, on this issue, the views of Gould I977 and I986b, Ritvo I972, I973, and I974, and Sulloway I979). Al- though I can be no more than suggestive here, I believe the theories created by Westermarck and Freud encode this cultural difference. Finally, I agree strongly with Paul that the work of Wolf, Shepher, McCabe, and others is important. My point is simply that it is important for reasons other than the ones claimed by these authors. Poole considers my essay merely a prolegomenon to a resolution of the debate. Given the list of issues that he thinks must be addressed in order to resolve it, he surely is correct. But in this sense, virtually all scholarly en- deavors are prolegomena. Although I am enthusiastic about my efforts so far, I would be the first to acknowl- edge that more work remains to be done. Poole does us all a service by indicating what some of the remaining tasks are. I should live so long as to be able to address even half of them fully. I agree that the anthropological (mis)understanding of the Westermarck-Freud debate is shaped by more than the words of the debate itself. I neither say nor imply otherwise in my paper. It also is quite clear that Wester- marck and Freud contributed far more to anthropology than an incest theory or two and, moreover, that the differences in their views may eventually prove to be more important than their similarities. I remain con- vinced, however, that the "Freud-Westermarck thing" has made it difficult to give these more vital issues their due. And, prolegomenon though it may be, I also remain convinced that my paper shows that the "thing" all but disappears when it is appreciated that the views of Freud and Westermarck are not unalterably opposed but in cer- tain fundamental ways complementary. Of the matters raised by Rohrl, I feel I can respond only to the issues of the definition of incest and the use of marriage data, since I am uncertain as to the point of her remarks on "the cognitive dimension." Inbreeding cannot be an adequate definition of incest simply be- cause many behaviors besides "intercourse between fer- tile, sexually mature individuals with a coefficient of relatedness equal to or greater than .25 " (i.e., inbreeding) are considered by individuals and groups to be "incest." It is a class-inclusion matter, as a rule, nearly all instances of inbreeding (in humans) are likely to be considered incestuous, but not all that is considered incestuous is likely to be called inbreeding as just defined. As far as the matter of marriage is concerned, I agree with the many who have stated that incest theories are, or ought primarily to be, theories about sex. That data about mar- riage behaviors are at times used in this field reflects, or at least should reflect, not a theoretical but a practical concern-i.e., it is often just about the only basis we have for discussing human sexual activities in some groups. That this is less than fully adequate I freely ad- mit. That it is of even greater significance for those who believe the sim pua and kibbutz marriage data consti- tute an adequate basis for testing the competing claims of Westermarck's and Freud's theories about human sex- ual behavior I gladly stress. Three of the many claims made by van den Berghe are of interest: (i) that "self-understanding is the ultimate challenge for a brain that evolved to track its environ- ment, not to fathom its own motivations," (2) that psychoanalysis is not a science because it is unfal- sifiable, and (3) that I fail to recognize that he indeed does distinguish between incest and inbreeding. On the first point, I heartily concur. Van den Berghe's own com- ments, however, show that it is not something people are equally willing to strive for. Other sociobiologists seem less convinced than he that self-understanding is difficult simply because we appear to be oriented by our history to tracking our environment (see, for example, Badcock I986). On the second point, I am convinced there is nothing I could say that would change his mind-not because there is nothing to say but because he (and others) simply will not hear it when it is said. Be that as it may, I will suggest that Kitcher's (I985:58-65) refutation of the claim that Darwin's theory is unfalsifiable be considered here, since it applies almost point for point to similarly spurious attacks on psy- choanalytic theory. On the third point, I most certainly do not "allege" that van den Berghe fails to distinguish between incest and inbreeding or that he is concerned with inbreeding and not incest. Rather, I show that at certain critical points he confuses the two terms, using them interchangeably when they cannot be so used, and that both he and Shepher make their best contributions not when talking about incest but when talking about inbreeding. I discuss these (and other) "glitches" because they seem to weaken his otherwise interesting essay and because they seem to be the source of much heated but needless debate. The Wilberforcean ending of his com- ment-his denial that he has ever had an Oedipus com- plex-echoes the traditional account of that so-called decisive moment in the debate between science (Darwin via Huxley) and religion (Christ via Wilberforce) except that in this instance it is not a phylogenetic but an on- togenetic heritage that is being denied. To this I am tempted to reply with Darwin's words regarding Wilber- force's hostile review of his Origins (quoted by Gould I986a:3I): "uncommonly clever, not worth anything scientifically, but quizzes me in splendid style. I chuc- kled with laughter at myself."</page><page sequence="21">SPAIN Westermarck-Freud Incest-Theory Debate | 643 Of the several issues raised by Wolf, the most impor- tant appears to be the one regarding the reliability of the Freudian mechanism-repression. Wolf attempts to show that Freud himself considered repression an unreli- able mechanism and that (in Wolf's words) a "jural prohi- bition of incest is an absolute social necessity." Wolf then attempts to deliver the coup de grace by noting that children in the kibbutz and sim pua cases "are not sub- jected to the constraints of an incest taboo" (the point being, apparently, that in the absence of the all- important jural prohibition, Freud would have to predict that these civilizations would be in "danger," again quot- ing Wolf, "of being overwhelmed by riotous incestuous impulses"). In response to this view, I would note, first, that, con- trary to the claims of Wolf, van den Berghe, Shepher, and others, Freud was not a simpleminded "cultural deter- minist" on the question of the barrier to incest or, for that matter, anything else. He routinely acknowledged that both biological and cultural factors were relevant. Although I doubt that it would repay the effort required, I am confident that one could match any number of cita- tions which appear to show Freud to be a cultural deter- minist with an equal number that make him out to be a staunch biological determinist (see, e.g., Spain n.d. b). Wallace (i983:I92-93), in the course of his extended as- sessment of Totem and Taboo, laments that "one could cite example after example of Freud's vacillation be- tween biological and sociological explanations." More- over, Sulloway's (I979) monumental work charac- terizing Freud as a "biologist of the mind" must surely be reckoned as an overwhelming case against the notion of Freud as a cultural determinist. Second, I am not aware that Wolf, van den Berghe, or Shepher has ever shown that the kibbutz and sim pua children are "not subjected to the contraints of an incest taboo." Granted, there are the well-known tender urg- ings of kibbutz parents vis-a-vis their teenaged children and the more forceful efforts of the Chinese father/ father-in-law vis-a-vis the sim pua couple on the night when they are to begin their conjugal relationship, but these observations hardly constitute evidence that there is "no incest prohibition." There is nothing in the records provided by Wolf and Shepher that could serve in any way whatsoever as a basis for claiming that the chil- dren in question are unaware, at either a conscious or an unconscious level, that sex with parents and siblings is at least "impious" if not utterly tabooed. Indeed, as I argue throughout my paper, the resistance of the sim pua and kibbutz children can easily be seen as evidence that they understand this. The parental actions offered as the basis for the dubious claim that the children "are not subjected to the constraints of an incest taboo" come more than a decade after the barrier has been established and during which time, apparently, it has been function- ing quite well. It appears that a similar error leads Wolf to another irrelevant counterargument-his claim that "the condi- tions necessary for enacting the Oedipal drama were simply not present in the complex created by minor [sim pua] marriages." Although he notes that the sim pua father/father-in-law appears to be threatening for rea- sons exactly the reverse of those typical of an Oedipal father, he overlooks the more formative experiences of the boy and his adopted sister/wife vis-a-vis the parents during the Oedipal years-events which occur long be- fore the father objects to the boy's refusal to consum- mate the marriage. It seems quite likely that the teenaged boy's attempt to reject the father's demand reflects, among other things, his deeply held (and uncon- scious) fear that the father will punish him if he does consummate it. To use language from another model, he is in a double bind, and his behavior reflects this fact. I am most disappointed, however, by Wolf's conclud- ing claim that "Westermarck was right and Freud was wrong." First, it seems far more probable that both theo- ries are "wrong" than that one is right and therefore the other is wrong. There are still too many unresolved is- sues to warrant concluding that either theory is gen- uinely "right," and the evidence so far available makes it seem quite likely that versions of both theories will be needed to account for the phenomena in question. Second, Wolf's claim shows that my optimism that an- thropologists interested in incest theory can get on with more interesting matters than the Westermarck-Freud debate may be unfounded. That Wolf's sociocultural data on the subject of incest are about as good as any an anthropologist is ever likely to have makes his stance all the more discouraging. Given his record so far, however, we can be sure that these data and his assessment of them will continue to be published and, therefore, that we will all be in a position to continue the dialogue re- garding their import. I look forward to that very much. References Cited ARENS, W. I986. The original sin: Incest and its mean- ing. New York: Oxford University Press. BADCOCK, C. R. I986.
