Oneworld, 1997.251 pages. $22.95 Interpretation of Mu'tazilite thought in academic discourse has developed significantly over the last century. An early European infatuation with rationalist thought in early Muslim kalam (theology) contrasted Mu'tazilite rationalism with a supposedly authoritarian, anti-rationalist Ash'arite theology purportedly eradicating rational thought in later Sunni Muslim theological discourse. A more nuanced reading of the underlying socio-historical structures that informed both sides of the debate, as well as a criticism of the dualistic notions inherent in earlier studies of Muslim theological history, paved the way toward greater sophistica- tion in dealing with diverse trends in Muslim kalam. The present book is best understood as an attempt to further such an interpretation. The authors introduce the reader into issues of continuity and discontinuity in Muslim theological discourse by providing their own translations of two texts by self-identified Mu'tazilite theologians hailing from different eras. Kitab al-usul al-khamsa (Book of the Five Fundamentals) by Abu al-Hasan 'Abd al-Jabbar (d. 1024 CE), a medieval Arabic treatise dealing with the foundations of theology as perceived by Mu'tazilites, is juxtaposed to the authors' translation of a twentieth century article by the Indonesian scholar Harun Nasution (b. 1919), "Kaum Mu'tazilah dan Pandagan Rasionalanya (The Mu'tazila and Rational Philoso- phy)." Nasution is little known in western discourse on Islam; according to the authors, the present work is to be understood as a "begin[ning] to fill this lacuna in Islamic studies" (159).</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 491 In the words of the authors these texts "contain traces of religious disputes that, with the continuing spread of Islam, were able to span a millennium and two very different languages and cultures" (9). Thus from the outset, a continuity of Mu'tazilite thought is posited, as the authors find a continuity of ideas presented in these texts. The primary purpose of the book, the authors tell us, is to show us "how to think about theological conflict in Islamic societies" (13). As a basic taxonomy of conflicting parties, the authors introduce the tripartite scheme of rationalist trends (Mu'tazila thought in particular but kalam also in general) and tradition- alist trends (critiques of present interpretations in favor of an idealized past) that both compete with "the orthodox center of Islam" (13). Adding some cautionary notes as to the heuristic value of these categories, the authors forge ahead in their presentation. A chapter titled "The Rise and Fall of the Mu'tazila" traces in broad strokes the history of Mu'tazilite literary activity from the eighth to the eleventh century C.E. Reasons for the decline of Mu'tazilite influence in traditional Muslim thought after the eleventh (or thirteenth) century are explored; and although the au- thors tell us that "there were many reasons why Hanbali traditionalists, Ash'ari mutakallimun, and others had been able to displace the Mu'tazila from the promi- nence the school had enjoyed in the ninth and tenth centuries.. ." (35) only the decline of political patronage for Mu'tazilite thinkers is cited. Surely other factors contributed to such displacement. The relevance of at least some of the principles upon which Mu'tazilite identity hinged was strongly connected with particular questions of the legitimacy of rule in the early history of Islam. These questions no longer played a major role in classical times, as van Ess has pointed out. Delving into the translation of'Abd al-Jabbar's work on the five principles of Mu'tazilite thought, the authors attempt to develop what they refer to as a "thick description of the five usul" (59ff.), "fleshing out traces of that larger history of the text" (60). The authors' comparison between a Mu'tazilite insistence of the createdness of the Qur'an and "Christological debates of early Christianity" (77) is misleading; a more accurate comparison would refer to the earlier Trinitarian and Arian controversies. 'Abd al-Jabbar's text becomes for the authors the defin- itory statement of Mu'tazilism against which, in part two of the book, modern Muslim thinkers are measured. A special emphasis on the place of rationalism within Mu'tazilite thought gives focus to both the text and its later use. The concept of rationalism, however, and its historical situatedness within medieval Islamic discourse are not adequately explored; rather, the term is im- bued with a fixity that, while allowing the authors to draw bridges between medieval and modern textual specimens of kalam, oversimplifies rationalism as a constant, irrespective of socio-historical and epistemological contexts. The prob- lem of rationalism is alluded to briefly in the latter half of the book in the context with Charles Adam's criticism of Harun Nasution's doctoral dissertation proposal at McGill University (167). The crucial point of a distinction between a perceived rationalism of the Prophet Muhammad and modern rationalism, that is, the his- toricity of particular discursive modes and practices, is not explored.</page><page sequence="3">492 Journal of the American Academy of Religion Drawing a bridge between medieval and modern times, the second part of the book deals briefly but insightfully with Ibn Taymiya (d. 1328), Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Wahhab (1703-1787), and Muhammad 'Abduh (d. 1906). The authors emphasize that rationalism also plays a major role in the thought systems of traditionalist thinkers. Such an emphasis on the place of rationalism in Ibn Taymiya's and Muhammad b. 'Abd al-Wahhab's writings is very welcome, challenging, as it does, stereotypical equations of traditionalism with anti- rationalism: "[O]pponents of Islamic modernism, the traditionalists, are not 'irrationalists, but rather they are proponents of a scripturalist rationalism, a rationalism put solely in the service of revelation" (119f.) Such a reading, how- ever, upsets two of the central notions set forth in this book, namely, a) that Mu'tazilism's continuity from medieval to modern times can be established on the basis of the use of rationalism, and b) that the initially posited dichotomy between rationalist and traditionalist trends competing with an orthodox center can be upheld, even as a temporary, heuristic device. In order to overcome such difficulties the authors would have to explore how a "rationalism put solely in the service of revelation" differs from Mu'tazilites rationalism(s). This is not done. What the book lacks, then, is a coherent account of the place of a particular Mu'tazilite rationalism that is distinct from other rationalisms, yet at the same time is able to support the authors' claims of a continuity of Mu'tazilite thought. Realizing such shortcomings in their conceptual framework, the authors in the end admit the term to be "vague" (220) but insist that on the example of a few twentieth-century Muslim thinkers a continuity from Mu'tazilism can still be claimed. Fazlur Rahman is seen as continuing the Mu'tazilite argument for the createdness of the Qur'an; metaphorical interpretation of anthropomorphic language in the Qur'an by Mu'tazilites is seen as parallel to Mohammed Arkoun's hermeneutics; Fatima Mernissi's openness to non-Muslim thought is read as a parallel to Mu'tazilite reception of Greek philosophy; and Hassan Hanafi's open- ness to dialogue with the Islamiyun is read as a parallel to Mu'tazilite engagement in interreligious discourses. What unifies the texts of these modern thinkers, the authors argue, is "a form of theological'rationalism' that throughout history has defined itself doctrinally in opposition to several theological stances, especially what we have called theological 'traditionalism' " (221). In the end, then, the authors have to admit that "Mu'tazilism has come to serve not so much as a doctrinal resource for constructing particular arguments against contemporary forms of traditionalism, but, rather, as a symbol of the will to be Islamic in a modern, pluralist world..." (220, emphasis mine). Such a gen- eral statement, however, carries no illocutionary force. Editorial shortcomings also detract from the overall value of the book. The biography of 'Abd al-Jabbar is provided twice (33-36; 46, 49-52) with consider- able inconsistencies between the two versions in terms of birth dates, pilgrimages undertaken, and other significant events in this scholar's life; an all too casual adoption of the term "postmodern" for contemporary Muslim thinkers (199) introduces conceptual laxity. Unfortunately, several of Nasution's writings avail- able in English are omitted from the bibliography.</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 493 While the execution falls short of the task, in its primary intent to continue a discussion of the place of heterodox movements within an Islamic tradition that is oftentimes perceived in monolithic terms, the book is of value.
