<plain_text><page sequence="1">Folklore vol. 98:i, 1987 57 Mystical Powers of Hyenas: Interpreting a Bedouin Belief DAN BONEH ANTHROPOLOGISTS have often remarked about the particular role reserved for animals in many social situations and prevalent in all different cultures of the world. Among the multiple uses humans make of the animal world, a particular interest lies in the role that animals play in symbolic behaviour and ritual. The anthropologist Radcliffe-Brown long ago suggested that animals and animal categories have a 'ritual value' utilized by humans in their attempts to articulate their world. As observed by Edmund Leach, the ritual value of animals is linked with taboos and rules concerning the uses humans make of animals, such as killing animals, eating them, and using animal products.' With regard to their role in symbolic thought, Levi-Strauss has suggested that symbolic thought and behaviour explore the relations between categories of significance which compel people to articulate them through symbolism and deal with, if not solve, the contradictions, ambiguities, and oppositions which make up the symbolic expression.2 This paper concerns the role of hyenas in Bedouin symbolic thought and the ways in which they are credited with certain mystical powers displayed during specific interactions which humans sometimes have with hyenas.3 Following a description of this Bedouin belief, I will attempt to explain the phenomenon, using the notion of 'transformation' between animals and humans, a phenomenon which has received some anthropological attention. The application of this notion will then be related to Bedouin religion and the prevailing tension between the monotheistic belief in Islam and the pagan roots of Bedouin culture which are still prominent. While lions are usually accorded the most noble and top ranking status among animals, the lowest ranks are usually reserved for scavengers, and among these reigns the unattractive hyena. Nature has given this animal a particularly ugly appearance. Its rough fur is coloured a shady grey or yellow spotted with brown dots. Its head is sturdy and disproportionate to a strong and bulky neck. Its back is usually lower than its front and, with its characteristically swollen stomach, it has a heavy, clumsy and unappealing appearance. An additional characteristic of hyenas is the powerful odour of their anal glands, which has skunk-like effect and is used by a hyena to socially scent its surrounds, and also as a measure of aggression and scare tactic to drive off other animals from access to available prey. Hyenas feed off carrion of all available animals. Their powerful jaws (responsible for the strange shape of their head) are able to break and chew bones and cartilage with relative ease. The development of the front of the body at the expense of the rear is explained as an adaptation to the need of the animal to haul its sometimes heavy prey to its cave, where it is communally shared among the animals. Lacking any other noble attributes, hyenas live in groups and are thus similar to humans at least in their adherence to some form of social organization. This aspect in itself makes them good candidates for symbolic attention.4 Although their number in the Negev desert is believed to be small, hyenas are frequently the topic of conversation in Bedouin tents and shacks. One often hears their far-away howling and yelping on still desert nights.</page><page sequence="2">58 DAN BONEH The yelping especially is characteristically human, and its desperate, laugh-like intonation usually sparks some remarks of laughter and fear. Bedouin report that hyenas attack flocks of sheep and goats in the same way as wolves which, although not very frequent, do occur in the area. When hyenas are encountered during the day they are usually chased away with relative ease. In such cases, Bedouin observed, it is the hyena who runs away; a motion of a hand and a few stones will deter it. Encounters between humans and hyenas during night-time are alleged to take a different course. Bedouin often claim that hyenas have the ability to turn any humans encountered alone during the night into their captives, and impose their will upon them temporarily. Hyenas are credited with the ability to coerce humans into following them to their dwelling cave. The scenario in such an encounter works in the following way: A person is walking alone in an area remote from tribal residence or the presence of other people. The hyena usually surprises the walker by projecting on him its intestinal odour, with its heavy and distinctive scent. In addition, the hyena is reported to utter its human-like yelps, making insistent sounds as if ordering the human to follow. Upon being hit with the vapours of the hyena's anal-gland scent, the person will no longer be able to exercise conscious judgements. The hyena begins to move slowly away from the area of encounter and towards its dwelling cave. The human, spellbound, follows the animal's path as if enslaved. Upon the arrival at the cave the hyena is expected to summon other hyenas who together will attack the human, snapping away at him until dead. If no other hyenas are present, or if not enough, the hyena will enter its cave and hide, while the person is left standing outside staring at the cave-hole trying to figure out a way of entering the cave, still spellbound by the scent, still wanting to follow the hyena, his master. There are various additional data provided by elderly Bedouin on such incidents. A human is likely to wake from his temporary subjugation if time is allowed to pass and the hyena stays deep within its cave. Indeed, some Bedouin recalled that they experienced such awakening; on coming back to their senses, they found themselves staring at the cave entrance trying to figure out a way of joining their hyena master. When they realized their situation, they were filled with fear and ran away to safety. One Bedouin reported an incident in which a relative who failed to appear at a scheduled time was found in a nearby valley with his head inside a hyena's cave, desperately trying to enter. Bedouin elders describe various conditions that limit these incidents. First, the hyena's odour (but some said urine) must hit the person. Second, if a person is wounded during the encounter and some blood is spilled, the hyena's scent will have no effect on him. Third, the power of hyenas is only effective at night, and if dawn breaks while a person is spellbound, the effect is diminished and the person is freed. Any light or fire will scare the hyena from proceeding with its attempts to attract the person, and the human will be freed from the hyena's spell simply by the absence of the animal from his proximity. In addition to light, strong whistles will also scare the hyena away and free its captive. As a final note, it is important to emphasize that Bedouin informants failed to recall any specific incidents in which individuals were killed by hyenas. All stories of human/hyena interactions have a happy end. An initial requirement before any interpretation can be offered is to dispense with realistic logic. Our concern here is not with the actuality of the phenomenon or with the extent of its logical possibility. As was argued long ago by Levy-Bruhl, a mind given to confounding external things with each other, as well as the external with the internal,</page><page sequence="3">MYSTICAL POWERS OF HYENAS: A BEDOUIN BELIEF 59 could not be described as logical in any Aristotelian sense of the term.' Levy-Bruhl, in documenting prelogicality, gives insight into the 'participation' of elements of experience in symbolic thought. The goal of the present analysis is to explain the belief in the mystical powers of hyenas by understanding elements of experience which manifest themselves in the myth. In addition, it is important to establish the religious context with which this analysis is concerned, although the myth itself does not make specific reference to conventional religious sentiments. 'Religious belief,' claims Edmund Leach, 'is everywhere tied in with the discrimination between living and dead . .. but religion always tries to separate the two. To do this it creates a hypothetical "other world" which is the antithesis of "this world" . . the gap is bridged by supernatural beings of a highly ambiguous kind ... these marginal ambiguous creatures are specifically credited with the power of mediating between gods and men.'6 It is therefore my contention that a myth of the kind described has to find its explanatory roots in the general realm of religious belief, even if these are not readily apparent from the specific context of human/hyena interactions. A final explanatory tool utilized to understand this Bedouin belief is the concept of 'transformation' between humans and animals. We are here fortunate to have some reports of animals (prominently hyenas) used as symbolic vehicles for such transformations. Among the Kujamaat Diola of Southern Senegal a hyena killed in a hunt is thought of and treated as if it was a human elder. Upon the death of a person infested with leprosy, the Kujamaat perform a burial ritual which differs from regular funerals for non-infested individuals. The Kujamaat claim that the leper himself is like (and some would say is) a hyena.7 In both instances the hyena is symbolically substituted for a human category that is socially 'marginal' in some respect, i.e. the elder at the boundary between the living and the ancestors, and the leper, socially marginal by virtue of his physical condition. Sapir goes on to show the structural similarities between lepers and hyenas, as well as additional elements occurring also in the Bedouin hyena incidents. Hyenas are animals of the night and are associated with mystical powers only during that time. It is an animal that is normatively anomalous at night, considering its lack of markedness during the day. Its unattractive traits of odour from anal glands, an awkward appearance, peculiar cry, and scavenging habits are all of significance in marking it as a focus for symbolic elaboration. Focussing on these traits and various other characteristics of hyenas, both Sperber and Sapir are concerned, among other things, with the questions of 'why hyena?' and 'why leper?' answers to which they find in the particular similarities of hyenas to humans as well as the anomality in the status of these categories. The transformation itself is accepted as part of the prevailing practice of adopting from the animal world at large a vast array of symbolic references. Thus, Sperber explains this transformation as 'the hyenisation of some humans who are supposed to be able to turn themselves into hyenas.'9 The religious context of this phenomenon is manifested clearly in the contrast which Sperber draws between hyenas and leopards, the latter thought by the Doroze of Ethiopia as being a Christian animal observing the fasts of the Ethiopian Orthodox church. While this attribution is not radically different from the general totemic usages of animals in pagan religions, the interesting aspect of this example is the use of transformation applied within the context of a monotheistic religion, ignoring the fact that in Christianity, unlike pagan religions, animals are not typically thought of as members or carriers of monotheistic faith. Yet, among the Doroze, the transition from paganism to Christianity, which occurred only a few decades ago, did not eliminate</page><page sequence="4">60 DAN BONEH the incorporation of animal transformations into the Doroze interpretation of their new monotheistic faith. This 'item' of symbolic thought indicates the transitional position of Doroze religious beliefs between animistic and monotheistic ideas, and their attempts to bridge the differences between the two ideologies. Their adherence to other transformations (into hyenas) indicates the extent to which pagan ideology still persists among these new initiates into Christianity. Sperber goes on to explain the tension which exists between the pagan elements of their tradition and their integration into the Christian Orthqdox church by claiming that 'leopards are Christians' by their nature: 'The Doroze, who are no less strict than it is in their alimentary morality, can use it as the basis of an argument to evoke a more comforting image of themselves . . . as being Christians by nature as well.' 10 Two propositions have been advanced thus far. First, that animal transformations play a significant role in pagan symbolic orientation, and second, that in the transition from pagan ideology to monotheism, animal transformations, while modified, continue to fulfil a symbolic role aiding such transitions. With these propositions established, we can now return to the Bedouin version of human/hyena interactions with a focus on the way in which these interactions manifest not transformations, but the 'threat of transformation' in the context of Bedouin monotheistic religion vs its pagan roots. It has long been known that Muslim nomads, though they may be fanatically Muslim, are generally lax in fulfilling the practices and observances prescribed by the Shari'a, the religious code of Islamic laws." Some have claimed that nomadism itself is incompatible with the life of a true Muslim, since it seldom provides opportunities for the regular performance of ritual ablutions and since it is usually impossible for Bedouin to attend schools to learn and read the Qur'an.'2 Islam among Bedouin is adhered to alongside several pre-Islamic practices which are sometimes contradictory to Islamic prescriptions. Various Islamic rituals have themselves been claimed to originate from pagan roots, including the holy pilgrimage to Mecca, kissing the black Kaaba stone, stoning the pillars representing the Devil in the vicinity of Mina, and various cults of saints.13 Such deviations are usually explained by the need of a world religion to come to terms with the multiplicity of local forms of faith and yet maintain the essence of its own identity.14 In a historical perspective, Gibb attributed these phenomena to the need of Islam, in its formative stages, to face the task of making the religious order of Islam effective within a social structure in which tribalism had been the prevailing condition: Nomadic tribes, who were the first initiates to Islam, had their own astral cults which were too vague and unorganized to form an effective obstacle to the penetration of monotheistic ideas, and the transition was eased for them by the retention of the characteristic religious ceremony of the nomads, the pilgrimage procession around the common sanctuary and the sacrificial feast in its vicinity.15 Bedouin culture similarly contains customs, rituals, and beliefs stemming from pre- Islamic ideologies, especially in those areas where formal religion fails to address issues and concerns faced by individuals. With regard to the belief in the mystical powers of hyenas, we find in Robertson-Smith's discussion of totemism among the early Arabs some evidence that tribes were claimed to be named after totemic animals, and individuals credited with powers derived from their affiliation with such animals. Here again, the role of the hyena (Dobay'a in Arabic) is a peculiar one. Robertson-Smith reports that the animal is permitted for human consumption, but that the Bedouin eat it as medicine rather than as food. The prophet would not eat the hyena himself, apparently because,</page><page sequence="5">MYSTICAL POWERS OF HYENAS: A BEDOUIN BELIEF 61 like the hare, it was thought to menstruate, i.e. to have an affinity with man. Furthermore, 'The Arabs say there are certain men called hyenic, and if a thousand men were shut up together with one such, and a hyena came, it would go straight to him and to no one else.' 16 The transformability of the hyena has thus been suggested by Robertson-Smith, and in this sense the phenomenon approximates to the African examples discussed above. Yet understanding its present-day manifestations demands an appreciation of the fatalism and absolutism demanded of the Islamic follower, to which a belief in the powers of hyenas is ultimately related. For all Muslims, all metaphysical truth about God is contained in the first part of the Muslim Creed, the Shahadah: 'There is no god but Allah.' All eschatological truth about man and his destiny is contained in the second part, 'and Muhammad is Allah's messenger' (rasul-messenger and servant).1' Indeed, Gibb had gone as far as claiming that the belief in God as the omnipotent master and man His creature who is ever in danger of incurring His wrath, is the basis of all Muslim theology and ethics. For Muhammad, the essential element of true belief was an uncompromising monotheism." The Qur'an is full of statements emphasizing this fact: 'God is the inevitable becoming' (sura 2:285), 'There is no refuge from Him but in Him' (9:119). Man must live in constant fear and awe of Him and always be on his guard against Him, yet he is bidden to adore Him, to magnify and praise Him, and ever to commemorate His Name (ibid.: 38). Finally, the very meaning of the word 'Islam' is submission to Allah, and the 'Shahadah' (the Islamic creed) means the testimony of the believer to the absolute oneness of Allah. Such total submission, while functional in instituting uncompromising monotheism, has left little room for symbolic elaboration, since all phenomena in the physical and metaphysical world stem from, and are explained by the ways, sometimes mysterious ways, of Allah. The anthropological observations of Barth and Douglas concerning the lack of ritual and symbolic elaborations which they found among nomadic tribes (all of whom are Muslims), can be considered in light of such fatalistic prescriptions of Islam.19 The Bedouin, being the first initiates to Islam, have had to replace the pagan richness of symbolic expressions utilizing metaphors from the natural surroundings, with the adherence to such fatalism which, formally at least, negated beliefs in mystical powers vested in animals or objects and attributed everything to Allah. A belief such as described with regard to the hyena is allowed prominence only because it emphasizes the dialectics of transition between pagan traditions and the monotheistic prescription. The former have continued, due to a new contextualization which allowed them to persist within Islamic ideology. Some allowance for the very engagement with mysterious forces is present in Islamic ideology. The Qu'ran acknowledges the continuous struggle against the insatiable fascination of the false ego with the 'play and diversion of this lower world's life' (sura 29:64) and the desperate attempts to tear away the veil of the illusion that would constantly convince us that we are separate autonomous beings (and not subjugated to Allah's will and mercy).20 The belief in the mystical powers of hyenas gives prominence to this struggle by playing upon the very theme of the pagan threat to monotheism. The suggested dialectics is thus between paganism and monotheism as these are being treated in the hyena incident tales. We can consider that the hyena itself is only a vehicle for symbolic elaboration, due mainly to its anomalous characteristics, and that these elaborations took different forms (as evident</page><page sequence="6">62 DAN BONEH in Robertson-Smith's references to the animal and the African evidence), yet the modern- day manifestations of the belief should be attributed to the ongoing dialectics between paganism and monotheism. In the shift from the pagan richness of symbols to the fatalistic acceptance of the powers vested in Allah, the belief in hyena bridges the gap between the two ideologies. The notion of transformation, evident in the examples from Africa and early Arabia, is here manifested in the hyena's ability to turn humans into temporary captives and its attempt to attract them to its dwelling cave. But unlike a complete transformation in which humans are hyenized, or hyenas humanized, incidents of human/hyena interactions fall short of claiming such transformation. Fitting with the Qur'an's warnings of constant temptations and challenges to the Muslim believer, hyena incidents threaten with animal transformations but do not accomplish them. Transformation itself is present only in the ability of the hyena to captivate a person and subjugate him temporarily to its will. Spiritual captivity only lasts a limited period and awakening is possible due to the interference of noise (strong whistles-characteristicly human), spilling of blood (symbolically representing an infringement of the incident on the internal organic self), and light (being the element which counteracts the spiritual danger of nighttime darkness). Highlighting the transformation is the stage in which the human follows the hyena and attempts to enter its cave. Yet this stage represents the closest humans come to following the hyena's will or becoming hyenas themselves as in a complete transformation. Instead, all accounts claim that the humans eventually return to their senses and completely recover from their temporary subjugation. Catching the believer at the spiritually dangerous time of night, the anomalous hyena confronts the Bedouin Muslim with the ultimate threat to his existence, i.e. the difficult adherence to Islam. The temporary subjugation to the animal's power emphasizes the gravity of abandoning confidence in Allah during times of vulnerability. The prospective outcome of being eaten alive by hyenas highlights the extent of danger vested in the subjugation, but the eventual awakening is the ability to claim again the ultimate greatness of Allah, and the justification is believing in Him. Stemming from such an argument is the possibility that an additional Islamic practice finds its expression in the hyena/human encounters. In much the same way as Islam prescribes rituals of purification and ablution prior to ritual performances, the encounter with hyenas provides a stage for a confrontation with the antithesis of Islam and the eventual emergence of the individual as a confirmed victor and survivor of this pagan challenge. A similar argument was advanced with regard to the process of Sufi initiation into the spirituality needed to approach the Absolute Allah. The sacrament of initiation brings the Sufi to a new 'birth,' for, as claimed by Lings, 'The first condition of spirituality is to be virtually "reborn." '21 In the Bedouin hyena-case this 'rebirth' occurs with the awakening of the individual from his subjugation to the hyena, once again assuming the role of believer who has just enjoyed the intervention of Allah on his behalf, and has experienced a new 'birth' from the almost fatal encounter with a force beyond his, or any human, control. The encounter with the hyena is thus similar to a confrontation with the force which is most in conflict with the monotheistic call of Islam. Since several Bedouin customs and rituals with pagan roots are nevertheless tolerated, the belief in the mystical powers of hyenas must only be articulated by Bedouin within the general prescriptions of Islamic thinking. Indeed, Bedouin state, when asked for explanations of hyenas' powers, that Allah's ways are mysterious and wonderful and are often beyond the logical</page><page sequence="7">MYSTICAL POWERS OF HYENAS: A BEDOUIN BELIEF 63 comprehension of human understanding. But the analytical perspective seeks to explain the particular details of a myth such as this with an eye towards concluding some generalizations about the meaning of such a belief and the reasons for its prevalence. Let us examine, in summary, the various aspects of reality and meaning as they manifest themselves in the Bedouin belief in the mystical powers of hyenas. The first question, why it is the hyena that is the subject of this symbolic elaboration, finds its explanatory roots in the characteristics of the animal and its habits which lend themselves to symbolic candidacy. The hyena is anomalous both in its appearance vis a vis other animals in the natural surroundings and in its human-like characteristics. The social aspects of hyenas' behaviour, and prominently the anthropomorphic laugh- like sounds hyenas utter, mark them as potential 'human like' candidates for symbolic transformations. That this is the case among African groups, and possibly in early Arabia, has been demonstrated above. In addition, being a nighttime scavenger, the hyena is active at a time when danger, spiritual forces, and mysticism prevail, and when symbolic elaborations are ethnographically known to flourish. When attempting to explain the nature of hyena/human encounters themselves we can see the implications of compromising the pagan elements of Bedouin tradition with the prescriptions of monotheistic Islam. The encounter with the hyena manifests the continuing 'threat of transformation' prevailing in pagan ideology from which Islam seeks a complete disassociation. But while pagan elements continue to exist, in the absence of symbolic elaborations, they are incorporated into Bedouin Islamic ideology by emphasizing the outcome of the encounter which, in effect, reaffirms the supreme might of Allah and stresses the failure of the pagan 'pull' of the hyena to destroy the Islamic Believer's commitment. In contrast to the 'Christianization' of the leopard among the Doroze, Islamic ideology cannot tolerate the bestowal of religious identity on animals or a belief in the transformation from animals to humans and vice versa. In the hyena's case, transformation is retained only as a 'threat of transformation' but is never claimed to occur physically. The threat, in turn, can be easily incorporated into Islamic ideology while at the same time giving expression to the dialectics between Islam and paganism. The hyena incident is qualitatively similar to a religious belief which, in the midst of ritual, engulfs the person, transporting him into another mode of existence, as is the case while subjugation to the hyena's power lasts. But religious belief is also the pale, remembered reflection of extraordinary experiences in the midst of everyday life. Noting this distinction, the anthropologist Cliford Geertz points to the importance of viewing man as moving more or less easily, and very frequently, between radically contrasting ways of looking at the world. To Geertz, the importance of religion is precisely its capacity to serve as a source of general, yet distinctive conceptions of the world, the self, and the relations between them. Religious concepts spread beyond their specifically metaphysical contexts to provide a framework of general ideas in terms of which intellectual, emotional, and moral experiences are given meaningful form.22 Since Bedouin culture is itself an arena for tensions between monotheistic belief and pagan traditions, the belief in the mystical powers of hyenas bridges the gap between conceptions of the world that seem radically contrasted. But they are not so from the point of view of the evolution of religion where seemingly contrasting pagan ideas are present within monotheistic ideology. Their ultimate meaning lies in the play with boundaries and ambiguities which occur as a result of the tension between animistic paganism and monotheistic Islam. The hyena's 'threat of transformation' is a form of</page><page sequence="8">64 DAN BONEH play with the boundaries of Islam. In the Bedouin case, where such boundaries need maintenance not readily provided by institutionalized forms, the marginal hyena becomes the symbolic candidate for such a role. While formal Islamic prescriptions cannot allow an explicit incorporation of the belief in the hyena's power, Bedouin ideology utilizes its pagan roots to reinforce the adherence in Islam and provide individuals with claims of validating its ultimate reality through the potentially dangerous encounter, at the boundary, where transformation into a non-human mode of existence is the alternative to total submission to Allah.
