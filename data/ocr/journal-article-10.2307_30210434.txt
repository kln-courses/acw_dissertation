<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Divine and the Dispassionate Selves: Shelley's Defence and Peacock's The Four Ages of Poetry JEAN HALL HELLEY'S Defence of Poetry builds to a climax in which poetry is celebrated as the power that "redeems from decay the visitations of the divinity in man" (p. 5os5).' Remarkably, the author of The Necessity of Atheism chooses to defend poetry by characterizing it as a religion, and writing an inspirational essay meant to kindle our belief in the holiness of the human imagination. Why did an unbeliever choose to defend poetry in this way? Certainly, Shelley was aware of the dangers involved in portraying poetry as a religion; in the Defence he remarks that "all original religions are allegorical, or susceptible of allegory, and like Janus have a double face of false and true" (p. 482). Later, he adds that every epoch "has deified its peculiar errors; Revenge is the naked Idol of the worship of a semi-barbarian age; and Self-deceit is the veiled Image of unknown evil before which satiety lies prostrate" (p. 487). This poet realizes that we all too often sanctify our shortcomings and then fall down and worship them. Moreover, he would have been keenly aware that Peacock had satirized poets as religious charlatans in The Four Ages of Poetry. Peacock's barbaric poets are false prophets who deliver "their oracles ex cathedra, and being indeed often themselves . . . regarded as portions and emanations of divinity: building cities with a song, and leading brutes with a symphony: which are only metaphors for the faculty of leading multitudes by the nose" (p. 16 I).2 I.

[ 139]</page><page sequence="2">140 Keats-Shelley Journal In the face of his own doubts and Peacock's witty challenge Shelley nevertheless designates poets as "legislators or prophets" (p. 482). Fur- thermore, the Defence celebrates inspiration as the quintessential poetic experience and associates it with the prophetic and the divine, suggesting that these "evanescent visitations of thought and feeling" are "as it were the interpenetration of a diviner nature through our own" (p. 504). To counter Peacock Shelley invokes Plato's account of inspiration in the Ion, but he ignores Plato's skepticism. Although Plato's rhapsode Ion cer- tainly feels the divine afflatus, he cannot prove that it results from the visitation of the god, nor can he show that poetry embodies any kind of real knowledge. But for Shelley, "Poetry is indeed something divine. It is at once the centre and circumference of knowledge" (p. 503). The Defence defends poetry by portraying it as divine, a position that Shelley clearly knew was open to question. Why adopt this risky line of argument? In the present essay I suggest that Peacock's poetic charlatans beget Shelley's prophetic poets-and that the issue of divinity then be- comes important as an aspect of the poet's being rather than as a matter of traditional religious belief. It is the poet's self that interests both Peacock and Shelley, and both writers view that self as grounded in feeling. Whereas, for all his misgivings, Shelley trusts feeling sufficiently to envision it as potentially divine, Peacock regards feeling as profoundly suspect.3 For Peacock, people are essentially self-aggrandizing; "the great prac- 3. I am indebted to Paul Fry and Marilyn Butler for their important comparisons of Shelley and Peacock. See Paul Fry's chapter, "Shelley's 'Defence of Poetry' in Our Time" in his The Reach of Criticism: Method and Perception in Literary Theory (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1983), I 25- 167. Fry's comparison of the Defence and The Four Ages focuses on human cognition and on the languages of reason and of imagination, subjects that also will concern me. However, my perspec- tive-approaching Shelley's and Peacock's difference as a debate over the valuation of human feeling and the nature of the self's development-is rather different from Fry's. See also "The Negative Voice: Peacock as Critic" in Marilyn Butler's Peacock Displayed: A Satirist in his Context (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1979), 272-3 1 3. Butler offers a comprehensive comparison of Peacock and Shelley that integrates their rival essays with other examples of their writing. She focuses on the areas of agreement between the two writers, seeing Shelley as drawn to Peacock's critical rationalism: "what Peacock represents for Shelley ... is a hard-thought rational position, a kind of radical orthodoxy: a liberal utilitarianism, a discriminating scepticism, a scientific and historical perspective," positions attractive to Shelley, who must be considered "a humanist and a critic, as well as a creator" (p. 306). While there is a great deal to be said for this view, nevertheless, I think the differences between the Defence and The Four Ages also deserve attention.</page><page sequence="3">Shelley's Defence and Peacock's Four Ages of Poetry 141 tical maxim of every form of society" is "to keep what we have and to catch what we can" (p. 159). Poetry originally arose as "a sort of brief historical notices, in a strain of tumid hyperbole, of the exploits and possessions of a few preeminent individuals" (p. 159), an extravagant but illusory emotional display designed to reinforce the power of a select few. Peacock's bards project feeling as hyperbole-a seemingly potent but actually empty effusion, created to serve hidden ends. Truly, his poets are experts in "leading multitudes by the nose," for their songs give the audience the illusion of empowerment even as they are being robbed. Peacock creates an imaginary economy that inversely relates feeling and power, display and entitlement. In his world the bard's emotional exhi- bitionism is a sure sign of concealed self-interest, and the only effective transactions of feeling are manipulative. His powerful people are calcu- lating, self-contained individualists who exploit the common herd that buys too easily into emotion.4 In the Defence Shelley meets this challenge by claiming that "Poetry, and the principle of Self, of which money is the visible incarnation, are the God and the Mammon of the world" (p. 503). Poetry becomes the opposite quantity to selfhood and assumes a divine character because it transcends normal boundaries of human identity. As an alternative to Peacock's self-contained self Shelley postulates a self-exceeding self and celebrates the involuntary visitations of inspiration as the hallmark of true poetry. Where Peacock discredits feeling, Shelley empowers it: the true prophet is carried away by poetic inspiration, surrenders to it, and becomes enlarged by it. All this is obvious enough in A Defence of Poetry, but I suggest that by keeping Peacock's charges against feeling in view, we can much better appreciate the nature and power of Shelley's position. 4. See Marlon B. Ross, The Contours of Masculine Desire: Romanticism and the Rise of Women's Poetry (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989), I7-20, for a reading of The Four Ages as a parody of the conventional Romantic narrative of spiritual growth. Ross suggests that Peacock portrays spiritual growth as economic aggrandizement, thus exposing motives and affiliations that the poets would prefer remain hidden: "the marketing of poetry, in the eyes of the romantics, is an extrinsic phenomenon that plagues poetry in its latter days and robs poetry of its genuine merit and use in society. According to Peacock, however, poetry is a form of economic exchange no different from any other trade except that what poets sell is a false commodity that can be used for no real purpose: thus, like the capitalist speculators who have become so common in early nineteenth-century England, poets are able to get something for nothing" (p. 9).</page><page sequence="4">142 Keats-Shelley Journal The Four Ages of Poetry and the Defence can be read as a Romantic bipolar pairing, antithetical exercises in irony and lyricism that, respectively, undercut and valorize feeling. Surely Shelley noted Peacock's recommended anodyne to feeling- dispassion. According to Peacock, as history progresses the empire of poetry is displaced by the reign of scientific fact and poets are exposed for what they really are, great overgrown children. "Poetry was the mental rattle that awakened the attention of intellect in the infancy of civil society: but for the maturity of mind to make a serious business of the playthings of its childhood, is as absurd as for a full-grown man to rub his gums with coral, and cry to be charmed to sleep by the jingle of silver bells" (p. 171). Where the ancient bards were cleverly calculating, using their poetry to lead audiences by the nose, the moderns are child- ishly fooled by their own effusions, toying with "the rant of unregulated passion, the whining of exaggerated feeling, and the cant of factitious sentiment" (p. I70). The progress of civilization brings the scientist's maturity-but witnesses the poet's regress into second childhood. The requisite for adulthood, then, must be dispassion rather than feeling. An important passage from The Four Ages characterizes the dispassion- ate perception of Peacock's scientist-adult: The philosophic mental tranquillity which looks round with an equal eye on all external things, collects a store of ideas, discriminates their relative value, assigns to all their proper place, and from the materials of useful knowledge thus collected, appreciated, and arranged, forms new combinations that impress the stamp of their power and utility on the real business of life, is diametrically the reverse of that frame of mind which poetry inspires, or from which poetry can emanate. (p. 170) Peacock's scientist, a person of "philosophic mental tranquillity," looks on all external things with an equal eye and deliberately collects and arranges the "new combinations" that are the evolving structures of knowledge. Of course this dispassionate "tranquillity" is a far cry from the rapture of Shelleyan inspiration. But it also is remote from a Words- worthian spontaneous overflow of powerful feeling, which begins in an attitude resembling Peacock's, "emotion recollected in tranquillity," but</page><page sequence="5">Shelley's Defence and Peacock's Four Ages of Poetry 143 progresses "till by a species of re-action the tranquillity gradually disap- pears, and an emotion, similar to that which was before the subject of contemplation, is gradually produced, and does itself actually exist in the mind."5 For Wordsworth and Shelley, the moment of insight is suffused with feeling; but for Peacock suppression of feeling is the prerequisite for knowledge. As Jerrold Hogle points out, both Shelley's and Peacock's models of perception are derived from an "associationist epistemology" (and I might add that Wordsworth's is, too).6 Hogle sees this common ground as an indication that Shelley's and Peacock's views are more in accord than is commonly thought-but I would suggest that this shared associationism serves to foreground their great difference on the question of feeling. Peacock distrusts emotion. In the world's early ages it was used by poets as an instrument of self-aggrandizement and a means of stealing power for the select few. Strong feeling is the stock in trade of the individualist, the anti-social egotist. In contrast, the dispassionate scientist is a socialized person who uses his or her powers to serve rather than to preempt the community. But this view that adulthood necessarily in- volves self-restraint probably is a conclusion arrived at with some reluc- tance. For Peacock was a novelist and essayist, not a scientist, and his dis- trust of emotion leaves him in a position where he must undercut feeling. And so he satirizes poetry in The Four Ages and writes satirical novels that undermine the egotistical Romantic pretensions of his contempo- raries. His expressions of feeling are confined to the areas of wit and irony-but if he exhibits an affinity with Byron in this respect, his range is distinctly confined in comparison to Byron's. Especially in Don Juan Byron stands for a truly spontaneous overflow of powerful feeling. He is against inhibition of any kind, preferring to create an ad hoc and pro- visional adulthood through his narrator's flexible lucidity. Byron's way is to liberate feelings and then as clearly as possible to perceive what they 5. R.L. Brett and A.R.

Hogle, "The Poetics of Re-vision: Teaching A Defence of Poetry," in Approaches to Teaching Shelley's Poetry, ed. Spencer Hall (New York: Modern Language Association of America, 1990o), I 14- 119. Hogle's comparison of the Defence and The Four Ages is directed toward character- izing the religious imagery of the Defence as critical and iconoclastic. Hence, he emphasizes the critical and skeptical bent in Shelley that aligns him with Peacock- as does Marilyn Butler (see footnote 3).</page><page sequence="6">144 Keats-Shelley Journal are-not to be self-deluded about them. Byronic perception incorporates emotion rather than separating from it, and so in addition to wit and irony Byron's work manifests a wide range of attitudes and an energetic drive not available to Peacock.' Undoubtedly Peacock did not accept the satiric arguments of The Four Ages at face value- Shelley was confident of that-but a serious distrust of uncontrolled feeling certainly is evident in the essay.8 The "philosophic mental tranquillity" of Peacock's scientist is a delib- erate, rational mode of perception, and the observations made in this mode are expressed in a language of reason. Whereas "Feeling and passion are best painted in, and roused by, ornamental and figurative language S.. the reason and the understanding are best addressed in the simplest and most unvarnished phrase .... This will be found true of all dispas- sionate reasoning whatever, and of all reasoning that requires comprehen- sive views and enlarged combinations" (pp. 163-164). Peacock's distinc- tion between the reasonable and the figurative is taken up by Shelley in the opening paragraphs of the Defence. He begins his essay by distinguish- ing "two classes of mental action, which are called reason and imagina- tion." Reason is the mode of"analysis, and its action regards the relations of things, simply as relations; considering thoughts, not in their integral unity, but as the algebraical representations which conduct to certain general results." In contrast, imagination is "the principle of synthesis" and involves mind acting upon its thoughts "so as to colour them with its own light, and composing from them, as from elements other thoughts, each containing within itself the principle of its own integrity" (p. 480). Although Shelley's and Peacock's discriminations seem roughly com- parable, it will take some discussion to clearly indicate their resemblances. The most obvious area of agreement seems to respect reason; Peacock's 7. For a more extended account of this view of Byron, see my "The Evolution of the Surface Self: Byron's Poetic Career," Keats-Shelley Journal, 36 (1987), 134-I157. 8. In the Defence itself Shelley remarks, "The Author of the Four Ages of Poetry has prudently omitted to dispute on the effect of the Drama upon life and manners. For, if I know the knight by the device of his shield, I have only to inscribe Philoctetes or Agammemnon or Othello upon mine to put to flight the giant sophisms which have enchanted him, as the mirror of intolerable light, though on the arm of one of the weakest of the Paladins, could blind and scatter whole armies of necromancers and pagans" (p. 490). See also Marilyn Butler's chapter, "The Negative Voice: Peacock as Critic," which presents Peacock as a liberal humanist critic who by no means disapproved of all contemporary British poetry.</page><page sequence="7">Shelley's Defence and Peacock's Four Ages of Poetry 145 unvarnished phrases and Shelley's algebraical representations both aim at analytical clarity. But where for Peacock figuration is "ornamental" and merely a representation of "Feeling and passion," for Shelley imag- ination obviously performs a synthetic, cognitive function. Perhaps most important, Peacock explicitly discusses two languages - the languages of reason and of figuration-whereas Shelley refers to "two classes of men- tal action." But if there are no statements in the Defence which clearly or systematically discriminate between a language of reason and a language of imagination, there are indications that Shelley did implicitly entertain two distinctive attitudes toward language. Like Peacock's reasonable language, Shelley's language of reason seems associated with a deliberately dispassionate form of attention. Such analytical perceptions foreground the separateness of things and create relationships by cataloguing or classifying distinct entities within a rationally generated system. When Shelley regards language in this way, he tends to think of the grammarian. The Defence suggests that "Every original language near to its source is in itself the chaos of a cyclic poem" and that this synthetic ur-language then is systematized by "the copiousness of lexicography and the distinctions of grammar," which are the "works of a later age, and are merely the catalogue and the form of the creations of Poetry" (p. 482). These remarks suggest two signifi- cant moments in the creation of language: the chaotic poetic moment, undifferentiated and generative, and the rational moment, in which the creator becomes grammarian, separates him or herself from the creation and rationally systematizes what has been made.9 Where Peacock places his faith in such codifications, Shelley tends to see them as useful but certainly not of first importance. His remarks on translation amply sug- gest this. William Keach and Richard Cronin have called attention to the two passages in the Defence that discuss translation, arguing they are con- tradictory.10 The first considers the translatability of grammatical ele- 9. Shelley tends to see grammar as analytic, butJames C. McKusick's study of Coleridge shows him evolving a constitutive view of grammar-one that grants grammar an important place in the life of the imagination. Read in this way, Coleridge's position provides an enlightening alternative to the view advanced in A Defence of Poetry. See Coleridge's Philosophy of Language (New Haven: Yale University Press, I986), especially Chapter 5, on Coleridge's Logic. 10. See Keach's chapter on the Defence, "The Mirror and the Veil: Language in Shelley's Defence,"</page><page sequence="8">146 Keats-Shelley Journal ments, suggesting that "A Poet participates in the eternal, the infinite, and the one; as far as relates to his conceptions, time and place and number are not. The grammatical forms which express the moods of time, and the difference of persons and the distinction of place are con- vertible with respect to the highest poetry without injuring it as poetry" (p. 483). Here the poet's unified participations matter most, and the "grammatical forms" that express them can be altered without damaging his or her conceptions. But only one paragraph later Shelley claims that "the language of poets has ever affected a certain uniform and harmoni- ous recurrence of sound, without which it were not poetry, and which is scarcely less indispensable to the communication of its influence, than the words themselves, without reference to that peculiar order. Hence the vanity of translation; it were as wise to cast a violet into a crucible that you might discover the formal principle of its colour and odour, as seek to transfuse from one language into another the creations of a poet" (p. 484). This second statement certainly seems to contradict the first. Shelley initially sees language as entirely flexible and subordinate to the vision of the poet, and then he reverses this position to suggest that language embodies the poet's vision so completely that to change the merest detail would be to destroy the entire creation. But I suggest this may be less a contradiction than a consideration of the problem from two perspec- tives-the imaginative and the rational. In the first passage Shelley dis- cusses the translatability of grammatical elements and implicitly is sug- gesting that grammatical codifications- "forms which express the moods of time, and the difference of persons and the distinction of place" - set up differentiations not essential to the poetic conception. But in the sec- ond passage he abandons this rationalistic perspective on language and approaches the poet's creation imaginatively. And here, the salient prop- erty of language becomes not grammatical form, or even "words," but "a certain uniform and harmonious recurrence of sound." To alter the poetic rhythm and sonority of language is to destroy the poet's very in his Shelley's Style (New York and London: Methuen, I984), especially pages II-I2; also the section of Cronin's chapter on "Language and Genre" titled "Genre and History" in Shelley's Poetic Thoughts (New York: St. Martin's Press, 198 I).</page><page sequence="9">Shelley's Defence and Peacock's Four Ages of Poetry 147 conceptions; and so in this second passage translation becomes an analytic activity that murders to dissect--"it were as wise to cast a violet into a crucible that you might discover the formal principle of its colour and odour." The tentative discrimination between rational and imaginative language that emerges from these passages on translation is that there are two fundamentally different forms of order-the rational, which sepa- rates self from its creations in order to reflect upon them dispassionately and systematically, and the imaginative, which generates an unfolding participatory order expressed through sound and rhythm. Not only is the imaginative order participatory, it is grounded in feeling. Shelley chooses the example of a child at play to describe the fundamental creative act, and takes care to emphasize that play is pleasur- able: A child at play by itself will express its delight by its voice and motions; and every inflexion of tone and every gesture will bear exact relation to a corresponding antitype in the pleasurable impressions which awakened it; it will be the reflected image of that impression; and as the lyre trembles and sounds after the wind has died away, so the child seeks, by prolonging in its voice and motions the duration of the effect, to prolong also a consciousness of the cause. (pp. 480-48 I) Whereas the rational order separates self from its objects of attention in order to discriminate and systematize them, Shelley's imaginative child attempts the very opposite-to unite the self with the "pleasurable im- pressions" that inspired itsjoy. This childish play and the poetic-prophetic moment of inspiration celebrated later in the Defence share the hallmark of participatory feeling. The self ecstatically seeks to merge itself with that which gave pleasure, but this is imposssible; the child's "pleasurable impression" fades away and the inspired poet's "evanescent visitations of thought and feeling" depart unbidden. The response of both child and poet is to give the self over to action-to unreflectively, entirely, mimic the beloved cause of pleasure. But this attempt at coincidence with the pleasurable only can result in difference. The child does not become its "pleasurable impression" but instead expresses "its delight by its voice and motion," and "every inflexion of tone and every gesture will bear exact relation to a corresponding antitype in the pleasurable impressions</page><page sequence="10">148 Keats-Shelley Journal which awakened it." Here the child produces a rhythmic human order, the essential embryonic artistic creation, which is as exact and as untrans- latable as the "uniform and harmonious recurrence of sound" that renders poetry written in one language untranslatable into another. The implication is that the imaginative participatory order is not open to dispassionate description or systematization, but nevertheless involves its own sort of precision. The child's play, the poet's expression, is not unconditioned but exactly shaped, because it is motivated by desire. Feeling generates form because the self has become committed not to arbitrarily producing just anything, but to accurately recalling that which it loves. But if the poet desires accuracy, this is not to imply that he or she really understands what there is to be clear about. Where Peacock's scientist deliberately detaches the self from its own experiencing and therefore can be said to perceive objects, or facts-discrete entities that can be deliber- ately arranged into larger structures - Shelley's inspired poet cannot dis- criminate entities; he or she simply opens himself to inspiration: Poetry is not like reasoning, a power to be exerted according to the determination of the will. A man cannot say, "I will compose poetry." The greatest poet even cannot say it: for the mind in creation is as a fading coal which some invisible influence, like an inconstant wind, awakens to transitory brightness: this power arises from within, like the colour of a flower which fades and changes as it is developed, and the conscious portions of our natures are unprophetic either of its approach or its departure. (pp. 503-504) Unlike reasonable perception, poetic perception opens itself to the inces- sant flow of time. Where reason reifies things, enabling the deliberate manipulations of rational structure-building, poetic perception happens in spite of itself-unwilled, suddenly dominated by "some invisible in- fluence, like an inconstant wind" that fans up a "transitory brightness" of which "the conscious portions of our natures" are distinctly "unpro- phetic." Paradoxically, prophetic poetry cannot foretell its own visita- tions, the strong voice of the poet issues from self-surrender, and everlast- ing visions emerge from the relentless rush of temporality. On the one hand, the Defence is committed to privileging poetry as "something di-</page><page sequence="11">Shelley's Defence and Peacock's Four Ages of Poetry I49 vine . .. at once the centre and circumference of knowledge" (p. 503), but on the other, Shelley must remark on the "limitedness of the poeti- cal faculty itself," which seems divine only in its "inspired moments" (p. 50o4). Therefore, poetic language itself becomes paradoxical, for it must give a word to something that is "elevating and delightful beyond all expres- sion" (p. 504). To say the unsayable is poetry's mission, and this charge transvalues figurative language, which Peacock considered merely the "ornamental" effusions of"Feeling and passion" (p. 163). Shelley regards metaphor as cognitive rather than ornamental, and indeed, sees it as the very heart of poetic language; for it "marks the before unapprehended relations of things" (p. 482). Peacock's reasonable orderings, in which entities are "collected, ap- preciated, and arranged" to form "new combinations that impress the stamp of their power and utility on the real business of life" (p. 170) are no more vital than the poet's visionary metaphoric relatings; for the de- tached structures produced by reason can only become our possessions- they never will be ourselves. So Shelley can argue that "We have more moral, political and historical wisdom, than we know how to reduce into practise," but "We want the creative faculty to imagine that which we know; we want the generous impulse to act that which we imagine" (p. 502). It is poetry that "compels us to feel that which we perceive, and to imagine that which we know" (p. 505o)-and this felt knowledge then becomes the true form of self-development. In this important sense it is the poets rather than the scientists who are capable of progress, who potentially are the true adults. To grow up we must not distrust or deny feeling, we must cultivate it. And so poetry becomes "the centre and circumference of knowledge" because it is the great vehicle of human self-development. In this respect the paradoxical nature of poetic language-that language which attempts to say the unsayable-must assume its place as the facilitator of human growth. The poet who struggles to say the unsayable is involved in an interrelation of unlimitedness and limitation; for if on the one hand his or her intimations are "elevating and delightful beyond all expression," on the other, there are no words for what he or she senses. So like Shelley's ur-poet, the child at play, the poet gives self over unreflectively</page><page sequence="12">I 5o Keats-Shelley Journal and wholly to uniting with his or her impressions. But as with the child, the poet's self cannot become its own delight; instead of enacting union his or her words create difference, as the poet tries to recapture the past but instead finds himself or herself moving into the future. In attempting to be retrospective the poet becomes creative- and his or her real creation turns out to be a more comprehensively developed self. The relationship between Shelleyan inspiration and Wordsworthian spontaneous over- flow of powerful feeling now becomes clear: both are extraordinary infusions of feeling that draw the poet to the past only to generate ex- pressions that move into the future, that unfold the self which develops through its creations of language. The interrelation ofunlimitedness and limitation thus is vital to human growth and its expressive actualization, the poet's generative language. But this paradoxical dynamic is apt to appear merely contradictory. William Keach has made this case against the Defence very powerfully, arguing that the beginning of Shelley's essay suggests that "language is entirely a product of mind and is therefore more fully and precisely expressive of thought than any other medium," but that the conclusion of the Defence, where inspiration is discussed, contradicts this initial po- sition to concede "that words, once they are spoken or written, separate themselves from the mind that produced them and are therefore inher- ently imperfect signs of thoughts." 11 At the beginning of his essay Shelley seems to see poetic language as harboring unrestricted powers, but by the end of the Defence "the mind in creation is as a fading coal" wakened to only "transitory brightness," and the evanescence of this inspiration glaringly reveals "the limitedness of the poetical faculty itself," which is unable to capture in words what has been "elevating and delightful beyond all expression." Keach approaches this apparent contradiction in Shelley as a problem in language theory, but it also can be considered from the perspective of the self's development. Viewed in this way, the inspired poet's struggle to say the unsayable reveals the limitations of language as a means of bringing the ineffable to consciousness. But the Defence considers the poet's self not only in the moment of inspiration, which is the moment I1I. Keach, Shelley's Style, p. 2.</page><page sequence="13">Shelley's Defence and Peacock's Four Ages of Poetry 15 of evolving self-consciousness-it also portrays imagination as that mys- terious aspect of the self that exceeds knowing and operates without limitations. At the beginning of the Defence this imagination is described in Lockean terms as the absolute creator of "language," which "is arbi- trarily produced by the Imagination and has relation to thoughts alone."12 Where for Locke linguistic creation is potentially deliberate and lucid, Shelley views the imagination's creation of language very differently- for the imagination is inherently imperceptible to consciousness, is "that imperial faculty, whose throne is curtained within the invisible nature of man" (p. 483). This image of the imperial Imagination throned behind a curtain "within the invisible nature of man" tellingly resembles the figure of Demogorgon in Prometheus Unbound, who is manifest only as a "veiled form," a "mighty Darkness... Ungazed upon and shapeless" (II.iv. I-5). Although Imagination in the Defence is a part of man's nature, it is curtained and "invisible"--and that invisibility also figures in the poet's inspirational receptions, wherein "some invisible influence," a "power" that arises "from within," wakens the poet's mind "to transitory bright- ness." The imperial Imagination is regarded as human but not a part of the conscious self, a mysterious king or god who like Demogorgon, embodies a "deep truth" forever "imageless" (nii.iv. I 16). Bringing Shelley's account of inspiration and his image of the imperial Imagination together suggests that he conceives of the self as a mixture of consciousness and unconsciousness, as a receiver of inspiration and as its unknown creator. But the unconscious portion of human nature is so regally remote, so "invisible" to consciousness, that it can be referred to as a god. These assumptions about the self are, I believe, the key to Shelley's attitude toward the divine in the Defence. He can conceive of the Imagination as holy and trust in its visitations because it is both the self and not the self, a part of the poet so distant from his or her conscious- ness that it may be worshipped. Such worship easily could become idolatry, as Shelley was well aware. In the Defence he warns against taking poetry literally; poets are not "prophets in the gross sense of the word," nor do they "foretell the form 12. See Keach, Shelley's Style, pp. 15-16, for a discussion of the Lockean reference in this passage of the Defence. It is Locke's view of language as an arbitrary sign system that Shelley invokes here.</page><page sequence="14">I152 Keats-Shelley Journal as surely as they foreknow the spirit of events" (p. 483). This warning against literalism echoes the "Essay on Christianity," which celebrates Christ as a "sublime and poetical mind" and cautions us against the "vul- gar error of interpreting literally every expression which it employs. Nothing can well be more remote from truth than the literal and strict construction of such expressions asJesus Christ delivers." Most tellingly, when he discusses God in the "Essay," Shelley suggests that "The univer- sal Being can only be described or defined by negatives, which deny his subjection to the laws of all inferior existences. Where indefiniteness ends idolatry and anthropomorphism begin."13 The god of the "Essay on Christianity" forever remains an inviolable mystery-but the result is the demystification of religion. As Timothy Webb has argued, the "Essay" converts religion into poetry, remakes the literal into the metaphorical.14 And this observation suggests a further insight into poetic language in the Defence: this metaphorical language is cognitive but not literal; it "marks the before unapprehended relations of things" but it does not reveal absolute truth. Rather than authoritatively describing reality, metaphor poetically arranges the appearances. The view I have been arguing ultimately implies that poetic language in the Defence is developmental rather than transcendental. Its arrange- ments and rearrangements become the expressions of the evolving self, which in itself is not to be considered as a reifiable entity but rather as an ongoing activity or process of enactment. The divinely mysterious depths may call forth this self's delight and aspiration, but the result is creation of figurations on the surface--the incessant arrangement and rearrangement of the appearances. The curtained imperial Imagination of the Defence then would function rather as Demogorgon does in Prome- theus Unbound. In Shelley's lyrical drama Asia descends into the underworld, the place of the oracle, to ask why God permits evil to infect the world.

Finally, he says, "a voice / Is wanting, the deep truth is imageless" (II.iv. I15- 1i6). Seeing that the depths forever must remain mysterious, Asia at last understands that "my heart gave / The response . .. of such truths / Each to itself must be the oracle" (ii.iv. 12 I-1I23). It is not God but Asia's own feelings which speak the truth, and when she expresses her heart's desire the world she wishes for begins to be actualized. Her speech unfolds prophecy as a conversion of depth into surface, a process that renders feeling articulate and self- conscious. This enactment resembles the poet's creation of language in the Defence, his or her paradoxical struggle to say the unsayable. The inspired poet prophesies not the coming Reality but the continually ex- foliating surface-the limited and hence ever-changing shape of his or her desire for the boundless. Where Peacock's scientist creates systems, Shelley's prophetic poet creates world view. To separate self and objects of perception, as Peacock advocates, renders the world an assemblage of discrete, manipulatable facts. In this mode the world becomes our possession. In contrast, to express the heart's desire is to bring feeling to the surface as an ongoing interrelation that simultaneously develops the self and expands the world. It should emphatically be added that this world is a human world, the world of our human being and participation. Shelley need not argue that this world is better or truer than the scientific world discussed in The Four Ages of Poetry; he grants a place to "those sciences which have en- larged the limits of the empire of man over the external world" and simply argues for a wise balance between the cultivation of science and the cultivation of human being: "The cultivation of poetry is never more to be desired than at periods when, from an excess of the selfish and calculating principle, the accumulation of the materials of external life exceed the quantity of the power of assimilating them to the internal laws of human nature. The body has then become too unwieldy for that which animates it" (pp. 502-503). A human world is a world of surfaces, of incessantly exfoliating ar- ranged appearances. And because it is generated by participation rather than dispassion, it is a synthetic world. In the poetic mode there are no hierarchies because there are no separations and no above or below. In the past the Defence often was read as a transcendentalist poetics, but it</page><page sequence="16">I154 Keats-Shelley Journal has become common to read it nontranscendentally.15 The nontranscen- dental reading carries important implications: if Shelley indeed does not refer to a world beyond the human world, then the divinity celebrated in the Defence may be an aspect of the self- that mysterious aspect which motivates our growth by inspiring us to exceed ourselves.'6 If this is true for the individual it is truer yet for human society; and indeed, in Shelley's view the self simply cannot exist by itself but only in relation to others. Self-development and social development are interrelated, and in a non- hierarchical way. Reconsidering Shelley's ur-poet, the child at play, makes this point clear. From the start the child's activity is generated as relationship, not 15. The most comprehensive and persuasive nontranscendental reading of Shelley seems to me to be Jerrold E. Hogle's Shelley's Process: Radical Transference and the Development of His Major Works (New York: Oxford University Press, 1988). See also Hogle's major article on the Defence, "Shelley's Poetics: The Power as Metaphor," Keats-Shelley Journal, 3 I (1982), 159-197). Another major study of the Defence as nontranscendentalist is Fry's "Shelley's 'Defence of Poetry' in Our Time" in his The Reach of Criticism. John Robert Leo's "Criticism of Consciousness in Shelley's A Defence of Poetry," in Philosophy and Literature, 2 (1 978), 46-59, argues the nontranscendentalist interpretation by offering contemporary phenomenology, and especially the insights of Husserl, as a guide for reading the Defence. John W. Wright's Shelley's Myth of Metaphor (Athens: University of Georgia Press, 1970) remains noteworthy as the first comprehensive challenge to Earl Wasserman's influential transcendentalist reading of Shelley. See Wasserman's chapters on Shelley's philosophy and on the Defence, "The Intellectual Philosophy" and "The Poetics of Intellectual Beauty," in his Shelley: A Critical Reading (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1971). See also M. H. Abrams' view of the Defence as a disarticulate blend of Platonic transcendentalism and empiricism in The Mirror and the Lamp: Romantic Theory and the Critical Tradition (New York: Oxford University Press, 1953). 16. Jerrold Hogle's nontranscendental reading of Shelley perhaps best brings out this redefinition of divinity. See Shelley's Process, pp. 11-12. "As Shelley concludes from perusing Hume and Drum- mond especially, a repeated passage between mental positions urges the psyche to project an impetus within or behind the shift. A 'cause' for this poet must now be quite blatantly one effect of its own effects, a projection into the immediate past by transformations that later seem to be its results. Hence the poet's notion of an 'invisible influence,' which seems to behave as though it were an unconscious force becoming visible only in conscious recolorations of its previous 'fadings and changings.' This 'power' plays two roles once it is so positioned by thought: it is the permanent, though self-concealing, self-mover causing all these transpositions, and it is the actual movement from state to state that turns one coloration into another without revealing any self-contained point of departure (any 'seed' leading to the 'flower' and its changes). It has been proposed because of the transitional drive to be the grounding of that drive, but it is also the transition in operation, a self-transformation perpetually changing and leaving its momentary ground. This curious infusion is 'as it were' then, the 'interpenetration of a diviner nature through our own' only because it resembles-the 'as it were' means 'as though it were'-the self-modifying and self-hiding tran- substantiation that is the Yahweh of the Hebrew prophets walking upon the wind and disappearing behind the succession of His signs. The mature Shelley has replaced the enthroned Omnipotence made out of this force by later interpreters with the 'unapprehended' movement between differences that probably generated the ancient sense ofJehovah in the first place."</page><page sequence="17">Shelley's Defence and Peacock's Four Ages of Poetry 15 5 as isolated self-determination. It responds to the "pleasurable impres- sions" evoked from outside itself, which "awaken" joy. Its responding "voice and motions" at once resemble these impressions but are not the same as them. If the child's participation could absolutely unite it with its impressions, then the need for activity would cease. But since partici- pation cannot achieve this impossible outcome, it becomes generative. Happily, by yearning to become the same, participation achieves differ- ence-and then difference can drive forward in a series of transforma- tions. Shelley's child is succeeded by the "savage," who "expresses the emo- tions produced in him by surrounding objects in a similar manner," and then "Man in society" follows. The augmenting chain of relationships with its expressive "language and gesture, together with plastic or picto- rial imitation," simultaneously becomes medium and production-"the pencil and the picture, the chisel and the statue, the chord and the har- mony" (p. 481), as people receive the productions of others and in turn are themselves inspired to produce. Hence, self and social development are interdependent, for both are driven by relationship, by the desire for another. It now should be clear why the essence of poetic language is its sonority and rhythm, not its grammatical relations. Poetry is the rhythmic accom- modation to the other, which extends the human surface by generating its relationships. "Hence the language of poets has ever affected a certain uniform and harmonious recurrence of sound, without which it were not poetry, and which is scarcely less indispensable to the communication of its influence, than the words themselves, without reference to that peculiar order" (p. 484). The expressions of poetic revolutionaries "are harmonious and rhythmical and contain in themselves the elements of verse; being the echo of the eternal music" (p. 485). Such references to eternity or unchangingness, which crop up rather frequently in the Defence, may be read nontranscendentally-for if the divine indeed is a perennially mysterious aspect of humanity rather than some being in another world, then our longing for union with divinity becomes the aspiration to an impossible self-integration, the union of self with human world that would create one self-sufficient totalized being. But because we harbor this unachievable vision, such desire for the</page><page sequence="18">I156 Keats-Shelley Journal absolute can generate relationship. Saying the unsayable and echoing the eternal music amount to the same thing: they express our desire for totality, for divinity. Paradoxically, the longing to say the absolute word generates discourse, and the desire to echo the eternal music produces the rhythms of poetry that harmonize human time.17 Because poetic discourse brings the heart's desire to the surface and constantly recreates it, both self and society become superficial for Shel- ley. Certainly, this does not imply they are trivial--rather, it means that they constantly are becoming self-conscious, are becoming perceptible. Shelley suggests that "Neither the eye nor the mind can see itself, unless reflected upon that which it resembles" (p. 49 I). Relationship and differ- ence both are necessary in poetic vision, because if the human was the absolute, a self-sufficient totalized being, then it could not perceive itself. To become conscious of oneself one must be reflected by a similar and yet different being. The other then becomes a mirror in which the mind can see itself. The imagery of mirroring is plentiful in the Defence. On the one hand, language and poetry are mirrors, but on the other, the poet also can be a mirror. Language "is as a mirror which reflects" mind (p. 483) and "Poetry is a mirror which makes beautiful that which is distorted" (p. 485); it also is the case that "Poets" are "the mirrors of the gigantic shadows which futurity casts upon the present" (p. 508). In the Preface to Prometheus Unbound the mind also is viewed as a mirror: "Every man's mind is... modified by all the objects of nature and art, by every word and every suggestion which he ever admitted to act upon his conscious- ness; it is the mirror upon which all forms are reflected, and in which they compose one form" (p. 135). That mind and language both can be mirrors perhaps seems contra- dictory, but it makes sense if the human world is to be construed as a non-hierarchical surface. As Jerrold Hogle notes, Shelley was aware of 17. See Robert E Gleckner's "Romanticism and the Self-Annihilation of Language," Criticism, 18 (1976), I73-189, for a discussion of these paradoxical relations between the absolute and the temporal. Gleckner argues that this relationship can generate language but also decree silence: "Curiously and paradoxically silence is thus the unutterable depths of despair at being unable to articulate and embody vision..,. and at the other extreme, total communication and communion in a world of 'pure intelligence,' where intellect is not embedded in or encrusted over by material existence" (p. 183). Shelley's Defence figures prominently in Gleckner's analysis.</page><page sequence="19">Shelley's Defence and Peacock's Four Ages of Poetry 157 contemporary, conflicting theories that proposed that mind arbitrarily produces language, or that contextualized language fosters human con- ceptions. Hogle suggests that Shelley chooses to see it both ways. And this seems plausible, for in a nonhierarchical world there is no authorita- tive first principle-all is reflection. Perhaps, then, the struggle to say the unsayable is an action that interrelates self and language as an evolving harmony, a rhythmic resemblance in difference.8 Because a human world is a world developed through relationship, it becomes not only possible but necessary to actualize self by expressions of feeling. Where for Peacock people become socialized through restraint of feeling, which is perceived as self-aggrandizing and anti-social and therefore to be carefully controlled, Shelley can envision a human world of the surface in which open expression of feeling becomes the safeguard of society. After all, Peacock himself pictured his poetic charlatans as self-contained characters who concealed their own motives; the deep self may be dangerous, and this is why Peacock recommends the scientifically dispassionate posture as his model of cultural heroism. But Shelley's hero is the poet, who becomes central to society because he or she imagina- tively projects its ethical vision. Peacock had remarked that poetry can teach "only the more tangible points of morality" and argued that "as the sciences of morals and of 18. See Shelley's Process, pp. 12-13. Hogle concludes: "Language must be the alter ego of the imagination because discourse is so inclined to depend upon an other, because every utterance refers beyond its own location to a different level that precedes or succeeds its statements as its cause and its target. 'Language' needs 'thought' in order to be itself as much as thought needs language for the same purpose" (p. 13). In "Shelley's 'Defence of Poetry' in Our Time" Fry also argues for the reflectivity of language and thought in the Defence; as he puts it, "Without always quite wishing to, Shelley reveals in the argument of the Defence that the activity of the imagination is not ineffable but can be understood as a kind of language" (The Reach of Criticism, p. 1 37). See especially Part iu of his essay. William Keach's "The Mirror and the Veil: Language in Shelley's Defence" takes the contrary view. While admitting that "Shelley's attitude is crossed and complicated by a recognition, encouraged by many eighteenth- and nineteenth-century writers on language, that the relation of thought and language is in fact reciprocal and circular," Keach nevertheless suggests that Shelley usually assumes in the Defence "that language is entirely a product of mind" (Shelley's Style, p. 2). Two general treatments of Shelley's attitude toward language deserve mention; both argue that at times he regarded language as an accurate reflection of human thought and at others as a flawed device distancing words from their objects of reference. See Gerald Brun, Modern Poetry and the Idea of Language (New Haven: Yale University Press, I1974), 59-6 I1; and Susan Hawk Brisman, "'Unsay- ing His High Language': The Problem of Voice in Prometheus Unbound," Studies in Romanticism, 16 ('977), 53-86.</page><page sequence="20">158 Keats-Shelley Journal mind advance towards perfection, as they become more enlarged and comprehensive in their views, as reason gains the ascendancy in them over imagination and feeling, poetry can no longer accompany them in their progress" (p. 164). Shelley responds by suggesting that "Ethical science arranges the elements which poetry has created . .. nor is it for want of admirable doctrines that men hate, and despise, and censure, and deceive and subjugate one another" (p. 487). Like the grammarian, who rationally codifies original poetic languages by providing "the copiousness of lexicography and the distinctions of grammar" (p. 482), the moral philosopher rationally "arranges the ele- ments which poetry has created." But this dispassionate knowledge can- not make us moral beings. In order to live ethically we must "feel that which we perceive, and . . . imagine that which we know" (p. 505). Hence, "The great instrument of moral good is the imagination," and "Poetry strengthens that faculty which is the organ of the moral nature of man, in the same manner as exercise strengthens a limb" (p. 488). Imagination figures centrally in our daily lives, and poetry augments its capacity to do so by providing strengthening imaginative "exercise." Whereas Peacock assumes that poetry can inculcate "only the more tan- gible points of morality," Shelley suggests that poetry should not attempt to teach at all. And he honors Milton precisely for his "bold neglect of a direct moral purpose" (p. 498). For Shelley, true poetry is nondidactic; it expands the self by providing imaginative experiences that cultivate our capacity for moral feeling. Poetry, then, is activity. Just as the Shelleyan self is a process rather than an entity, Shelleyan art is an experience rather than an object. It is Peacock who views art as object, and suggests that "Poetry is not one of those arts which, like painting, require repetition and multiplication, in order to be diffused among society. There are more good poems already existing than are sufficient to employ that portion of life which any mere reader and recipient of poetical impressions should devote to them. ... To read the promiscuous rubbish of the present time to the exclusion of the select treasures of the past, is to substitute the worse for the better variety of the same mode of enjoyment" (pp. 170-17 I). For Peacock the art object becomes a possession, and the most astute owners become connoisseurs who can identify and appreciate "the select treasures of the</page><page sequence="21">Shelley's Defence and Peacock's Four Ages of Poetry 159 past." Clearly, such possession has nothing to do with morality and so Peacock minimizes "that portion of life" the reader should devote to poetry. Poetry becomes aesthetic pastime. For Shelley poetry also happens apart from daily life, but certainly not as a Peacockian leisure activity. The problem with daily life is that it is apt to become habitual. And poetic language itself can and does degener- ate from imaginative experiencing into habitual uses; the "vitally meta- phorical" language of poets, which "marks the before unapprehended relations of things" eventually becomes cliche, "signs for portions or classes of thoughts instead of pictures of integral thoughts; and then if no new poets should arise to create afresh the associations which have been thus disorganized, language will be dead to all the nobler purposes of human intercourse" (p. 482). Once produced, poetry cannot be treated as a reified object with independent life; it continually must be recreated by being reexperienced in a fresh way. And so the counterforce to habitual degeneration of poetic language becomes defamiliarization.19 Shelley claims that "Poetry lifts the veil from the hidden beauty of the world, and makes familiar objects be as if they were not familiar; it reproduces all that it represents" (p. 487). Clearly, the moment of poetic inspiration is a defamiliarizing moment; but the moment of poetic recep- tion could be just as much so. However, Peacock's connoisseurs remain untouched by their poetry reading. Like his scientific investigators, these readers are truly dispassionate. But in the Defence Shelley finds it possible to admit the claims of both feeling and detachment by replacing Peacock's dispassionate detachment with poetic defamiliarization. For the most part, Shelley discusses defamiliarization as a momentary and unwilled phenomenon such as inspiration, a sudden transcendence of habit or codified meaning that opens the way to poetic vision. Hence, "The parts of a composition may be poetical, without the composition as a whole being a poem"; even "A single sentence may be considered as a whole," and "a single word even may be a spark of inextinguish- able thought" (pp. 485-486). In these examples the reader goes beyond the discursive intent of the text to pick up novel meanings in details, 19. For discussions ofdefamiliarization in the Defence see Robert Scholes, Structuralism in Literature: An Introduction (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, I974), 170-I 80, and Section Iv of Paul Fry's "Shelley's 'Defence of Poetry' in Our Time" in The Reach of Criticism.</page><page sequence="22">S16o Keats-Shelley Journal which become "sparks" that kindle illumination. But the deliberate and ceremonious as well as the spontaneous and fragmentary can evoke de- familiarization, as Shelley shows in his discussion of the dramatic perfor- mances in classical Athens. These performances evolved from religious ritual and, like their pro- totype, they were a traditional communal activity that became an expres- sion of the society. The "Athenians employed language, action, music, painting, the dance, and religious institutions to produce a common effect in the representation of the highest idealisms of passion and of power" (p. 489), creating a poetic form that transcended religion by calling forth "the highest idealisms" rather than literally summoning the god or gods. An important defamiliarizing device was the masking of actors; Shelley remarks that "Our system of divesting the actor's face of a mask, on which the many expressions appropriated to his dramatic character might be moulded into one permanent and unchanging expres- sion, is favourable only to a partial and inharmonious effect" (p. 489). These "permanent and unchanging" masks become a simulacrum of eternity that resembles the poem as "the very image of life expressed in its eternal truth," which in an earlier passage of the Defence Shelley had remarked upon in his attempt to distinguish between poetry and stories. Story "is a catalogue of detached facts, which have no other bond of connexion than time, place, circumstance, cause and effect," and as such is bound to its particular, local placement in history; but the poem "is the creation of actions according to the unchangeable forms of human nature, as existing in the mind of the creator, which is itself the image of all other minds" (p. 485). Shelley's discussions of dramatic masks and of the unchangeable im- ages of mind share the characteristic of redefining eternity as defamiliari- zation. Here unchangingness indicates not transcendental existence, but transtemporal potentiality. Because poem and mask are detached from local circumstance they are applicable to any time or place or person; like the poems of Dante, they become "a bridge thrown over the stream of time" (p. 498) that articulates the relationship of the human generations. Poetry spans time and personality, making the human world potentially divine, opening the possibility of the universal rather than merely the self, of humankind rather than merely individual men and women.</page><page sequence="23">Shelley's Defence and Peacock's Four Ages of Poetry 16 I This human universal becomes the plane of the ethical. Shelley believes that "A Poet ... would do ill to embody his own conceptions of right and wrong, which are usually those of his place and time, in his poetical creations" (p. 488), for poetry is not a didactic vehicle for imparting codified moral beliefs but an imaginative exercise that empowers us to transcend our local circumstance. "A man, to be greatly good, must imagine intensely and comprehensively; he must put himself in the place of another and of many others; the pains and pleasures of his species must become his own" (pp. 487-488). The Athenian tragedies functioned as "mirrors in which the spectator beholds himself" (p. 490o). These dramas set up the poetic interrelation- ship of resemblance and difference, offering each individual in the audi- ence a self-image in the world of the play. World reflects self--but not the restricted quotidian self of local circumstance. The playgoer tem- porarily steps out of his or her daily life and sees in the tragedy the reflected image of the self "stript of all but that ideal perfection and energy which every one feels to be the internal type of all that he loves, admires, and would become. The imagination is enlarged by a sympathy with pains and passions so mighty, that they distend in their conception the capacity of that by which they are conceived; the good affections are strengthened by pity, indignation, terror and sorrow" (p. 490). The play offers a nondidactic education by evoking the spectator's sympathetic feelings - feelings that expand as they are exercised to com- prehend the idealizing world of the tragedy, which is immeasurably larger than the world of the spectator's quotidian life. Playgoers who allow themselves to be drawn into the drama will experience a self-de- velopment that resembles the inspired poet's self-development as gener- ated through the struggle to say the unsayable. For Shelley, both poetic creation and reception provide imaginative exercise that resonates the self. The result will be not a detached Peacockian aesthete but a morally engaged person. Poetry and social commitment are interrelated, and "Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the World" (p. 508) not because they rationally codify law but because they generate the imagina- tive power that cultivates humanity's social feeling. Paradoxically, the eternal imagery of the drama provides a mirror that fosters change, rather than unchangingness. When religion becomes</page><page sequence="24">162 Keats-Shelley Journal poetry, the reified god becomes the developmental power of human feeling, and so the dramatic mirror becomes propagative, not merely reflective. "The drama, so long as it continues to express poetry, is as a prismatic and many-sided mirror, which collects the brightest rays of human nature and divides and reproduces them from the simplicity of these elementary forms, and touches them with majesty and beauty, and multiplies all that it reflects, and endows it with the power of propagat- ing its like wherever it may fall" (p. 49I). Poetry harbors eternity as an indefinitely expansive potentiality, as the continuing possibility of development. The divine in humanity becomes identified with the de- velopmental. And so Shelley's most conspicuous difference with Peacock becomes their disagreement about historical development. For Peacock, "with the progress of reason and civilization, facts become more interesting than fiction: indeed, the maturity of poetry may be considered the infancy of history" (p. 162). History begins when poetry is finished, and the adult- hood of civilization is created by the capacity of dispassionate inves- tigators to assemble the facts relevant to the various fields of science. This view of historical progress as accumulation, and the accompanying as- sumption that accumulation is tantamount to development, is very ap- propriately questioned by Shelley. Peacock's progressive human world is a reified world of fact; he can comfortably assume its indefinite aug- mentation because it seems to have such a secure thingly quality. Human knowledge appears to be an object that grows larger and larger, a snow- balling, inevitable extension of humanity's rationalistic domination over nature. But Shelley views history as the development of a human world, an extension of human being for which the model is the individual self's development. Since this self must be viewed preeminently as an ethical being, it becomes obvious that it always will be faced with choices and that some of them may be exceedingly difficult ones. Where scientific rationality at least may appear to be potentially infallible because of its dispassionate, objective perceptions, moral choices clearly are suffused in feeling and as such are more obviously fallible. Shelley does not share Peacock's complacency about progress, for he sees that it must remain provisional; for human being itself is a perennially provisional creation.</page><page sequence="25">Shelley's Defence and Peacock's Four Ages of Poetry 163 And so the history of poetry he gives in the Defence features not only the triumphs of poetry in some ages, but also its decline-and the accom- panying moral decline of societies-in others. The "great poem, which all poets, like the co-operating thoughts of one great mind, have built up since the beginning of the world" (p. 493) is not an object but a collective text embodying potential that must be activated if it is to be of any use. This great poem is dead in the reception of Peacock's aesthetic readers; it will come alive and renew itself only through the exercise of imaginative participation. The human cultural heritage surely can provide sparks, but it remains the task of each new generation to kindle them and to become the poem that it recreates. In his view of history Shelley exhibits far more skepticism than does Peacock; his lyrical celebrations of poetry are ac- companied by a very appropriate attitude of caution. For although feeling potentially is divine in the Defence, Shelley does not see it as inevitably so. Such an attitude would degenerate poetry into idolatry. The Defence is committed to the kindling of the reader's imag- inative vision, not to easily assuring him or her that poetry is sacred. Rather than worshipping false gods, Shelley wants us to act out the divinity in ourselves. The Defence of Poetry is a Romantic defense of imaginative feeling, and reading it as the antithetical companion of The Four Ages ofPoetry clarifies the issues that are of importance to Shelley. Peacock's irony devalues feeling, viewing it as manipulative in the world's early ages and puerile, disarticulated and hyperbolical in the modern world. When Shelley de- fends poetry against Peacock's charges he does not really focus on the text as structure or on the nature of poetic language, our own contem- porary interests. Instead, his central concern is with the poet's and the audience's moral being. His lyricism evokes rather than reifies the divine; it becomes an imaginative exercise meant to kindle his readers, to inspire them with confidence to live by the imagination.
