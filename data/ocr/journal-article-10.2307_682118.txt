<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS / Sociocultural Anthropology X41 ethnohistory, shamanism, and ntual, develops these themes to good effect in his Yagua monograph. Goulard's contribution is especially strong in its analysis of the political undercurrents swirling beneath the Ticuna's long history of millenarian move- ments. In addition to the analytical introduction and the three monographs, the volume includes a regional vocabulary and a glossary of kinship terms but, alas, no general index. If the Guia is able to sustain the high quality of this first vol- ume and there is no reason to doubt that it will, considering the distinguished roster of contributors then it is certain to be- come an indispensible reference work for anyone interested in contemporary Amazonia. * Patterns that Connect: Social Symbolism in Ancient &amp; Tribal Art. Carl Schuster and Edmund Carpenter. New York: Harry N. Abrams, Inc., 1996. 317 pp. HARALD E. L. PRINS Kansas State University The cross-cultural survey of tribal art presented in this beauti- fully illustrated book is bold in scope and interpretation. Based largely on the lifelong research and writings of Carl Schuster ( 1 90v1969), it is written by Edmund Carpenter who published an earlier edition of it entitled Social Symbolism in Ancient &amp; Tribal Art (Rock Foundation, 1 98S1988). The work under re- view here represents a dramatically shortened version of that 1 2-book, 3,500-page magnum opus, which includes 7,000 illus- trations (many of them magnificent) and over 1,500 biblio- graphic references. Having first met in 1959, and both intrigued by patterns, Car- penter and Schuster corresponded on folk symbols and tribal art motifs until the latter's death in 1969. Carpenter, who studied under Frank Speck and has a doctorate in anthropology from the University of Pennsylvania, has conducted extensive research among Arctic Canada's Eskimos and New Guinea's Papua since 1950. Schuster, who studied at Harvard and received his doctorate in art history from Vienna in 1934, traveled exten- sively ffirough Asia's backlands in the 1930s. Then, and in the decades that followed, he personally surveyed tens of thousands of artifacts in some 700 museums and private collections around the world. When Schuster died he had 46 articles to his credit, yet the lion's share of his research and manuscripts remained works in progress. His archives (80,000 negatives, 250,000 prints, 18,000 pages of correspondence in some 30 languages, hundreds of files on specific motifs, etc.) have since found a per- manent place at the Museum der Kulturen in Basel. Impressed by this heroic effort to identify basic tribal art mo- tifs and piece together the global puzzle of cultural tradition, Carpenter offered to complete what Schuster had started. It proved to be a herculean and consuming task. When the final text cohered, he no longer distinguished between Schuster's words and his own. As Caxpenter explains, the "I" in this text re- fers to himself, though many of his judgments come directly from Schuster's original writings. Like its earlier exhaustive edition, Patterns that Connect is an etymology and archaeology of ancient motifs representing a grand theory of kinship symbolism in tribal art. Its exposition can be summed up as follows: similar traditional art motifs and designs occur in tribal and peasant cultures across the globe; through the comparative method, we can recognize basic pat- terns in certain widespread and recurrent "geometric" motifs or schematic designs; theiroccurrence in the remote comers of Af- rica, Asia, Australia, and America minimizes the likelihood of numerous independent inventions; their uniformity suggests a common origin in the ancient past; because of strong resem- blances with Paleolithic art motifs in Eurasia, these patterns are probably "survivals" deeply rooted in a traditional culture com- plex farolderthan 10,000years; theircross-cultural existence is due primarily to very early prehistoric migrations, not cultural diffusion; through comparisons with related phenomena in tribal cultures where meanings of analogous designs are more obvious, we may become informed about the elementary princi- ples underlying these pattems; these principles articulate a sym- bolic language that can be decoded in terms of a genealogical iconography primarily illustrating social relations of marriage and descent; where original meanings of kinship diagrams were forgotten or lost, subsequent generations either imbued these patterns with altemative interpretations or simply replicated them as decorative or omamental designs; representing an im- mensely conservative tradition, this iconography links Paleo- lithic hunters and gatherers to still-surviving art traditions in a few tribal cultures as well as peasant communities. Organized in eight chapters, Patterns first discusses the wide- spread motif of the double-headed anthropomorphic figure and various other designs that are interpreted as the "family tree" and concern the universal question where we come from. This is followed in successive order by chapters titled "Genealogical Pattems" (hockers, zigzags, hourglass pattems, checkerboards, etc.), "Bodies and Hands as Kinship Charts" (joint-marks, fingers, etc.), "Social Bodies," "Mosaic Gaxments" (such as skin robes), "Compartment Robes," "Incised Stones" (inter- preted as dressed ancestral spirits), and "Rebirth" (inverted pen- dants, gaming boards, calendric charts, labyrinths, etc.). In their superb exhibit, the authors offer an unequaled exami- nation of traditional art and a grand conjecture that compels us to look at it with fresh eyes. While they may not be able to offer conclusive proof of their argument, their massive evidence and erudite interpretation flatten any lazy assumptions. Deserving serious consideration, this book should be of great interest not only to anthropologists specialized in tribal or prehistoric art, but also to museum curators and anyone else fascinated by the beauty and semiotics of"primitive" art. * The Political Economy of AIDS. Merrill Singer, ed. Amity- ville, NY: Baywood, 1998. 236 pp. BRADLEY STONER Washington University-St. Louis This book brings a long-overdue focus upon the social and political determinants of the AIDS epidemic, in terms of how oppressive social relationships fuel disease transmission and limit access to resources for prevention and care. Singer, a criti- cal medical anthropologist, notes in a preface to the volume that the collected essays grew out of a 1993 session at the applied aniropology meetings organized by Stephen Koester and Robert Carlson, entitled "The Political Economy of HIV Risk."</page></plain_text>
