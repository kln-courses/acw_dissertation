In order to disappear. It is there, but as the invisible source of light, in a kind of insistent eclipse, more than essential, producing the essence - Being and appearing - of what is. One looks at it directly on pain of blindness and death. - Jacques Derrida1 I. INTRODUCTION One best begins a meditation on James Thomson's The Seasons with critical indictments of the fragmentary, unreadable, or otherwise less-than-fortuitous features of the poem - at least, this seems to have been the standard practice since A. D. McKillop's excavatory work of 1942, The Background of Thomson's Seasons. For a beginning, I will alter this lofty tradition only slightly by re- producing the indictments of others, rather than articulating any of my own. McKillop: we have seen that his [Thomson's] flights in science and philosophy can best be understood by allowing for the natural drift of his mind, the association, whether rigorously logical or not, of his ideas. . . ? Patricia Meyer Spacks: It is manifestly impossible to "rescue" Thomson's diction for the modern reader: its remoteness, its air of contrivance, its frequently unjustified porten- tousness are all profound obstacles. Only in isolated passages is Thomson a readable poet for a twentieth-century audience.3 1 The Eighteenth Century, vol. 49 no. 1 2008 Â© Texas Tech University Press</page><page sequence="2">2 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY Ralph Cohen attempts to work with such indictments, justifying the frag- mentation of the poem in terms of a fallen world of perception - a kind of unity in disunity argument: though each season is rhythmically, associatively, and thematically connected with the preceding and following, the whole reveals the inevitable fragmen- tation of man's knowledge of the world.4 David R. Anderson returns to the earlier thinking of Spacks: Thomson's poem is an ominum gatherum , and for that reason it is practically impossible to see it as a coherent whole by attempting to reconcile the many topics it undertakes to discuss. The subjects the poem treats are too many and too disparate; none can subsume and order the others.5 Perhaps as a result of the techniques espoused by recent trends in critical theory, these pronouncements upon the poem have become firmly grounded signposts as to the ways in which The Seasons can be approached, and the the- oretical work it can be called on to perform. Indeed, as a kind of cultural docu- ment par excellence, The Seasons has more recently been the focal point for dis- cussions of class relations,6 geopolitics,7 and Enlightenment philosophy.8 Such discussions of the poem's pertinence to various other historical, aesthetic, and political discourses (to name just a few), as valuable in themselves as they clearly are, nevertheless foreground a critical practice that sees The Seasons not as a poem at all, but as a dense site of discursive exempla from which certain passages can be strip-mined and made to serve certain ends. To be sure, any text in our current theoretical climate must invite this kind of treatment. But The Seasons in particular no longer seems to be susceptible of any other kind of inquiry - as the critics above make all too clear, Thomson's poem borders on sheer illegibility qua poetry, and seems no longer to be of interest to critics except in the degree to which it is able to provide chunks of text ready-made for any of a number of contemporary theoretical or critical agendas. As such, the question of discussing the poem in its entirety, as a poem, seems no longer to be an issue. Of course, to invoke the concept of "entirety" as a description of The Sea- sons is in the first instance misplaced - Thomson continuously revised his magnum opus all his life, and as John Barrell points out, there is no reason to suspect that had Thomson lived longer, he would not have continued to do so.9 It is precisely the notion that The Seasons somehow should be complete, and therefore coherent, that occasions our outrage when faced with its seem- ingly random concatenation of subjects. For to call a text "fragmentary" is to bring to that text certain assumptions concerning the degree to which a poem should be available to the critic's readerly technology. We may notice, in</page><page sequence="3">DESROCHES- ON KANT'S GENTLEMANLY MISANTHROPY 3 reading the comments of the critics above, that it is precisely that technol- ogy - its very apparatus - that is threatened by Thomson's poem. Spacks, for example, suggests a little earlier on in her treatment of Thomson's poem, that "[a] persistent problem in examining The Seasons is that its effects usually de- pend on units about a hundred lines long: too long for quotation or detailed analysis."10 We are left with the sense, implicitly if not overtly, that it is some- how the poem's fault that we cannot read it, and in this regard Spacks' s char- acterization has stuck; it would be difficult to find a critic these days willing to quote more than twenty lines from this poem - or any poem for that mat- ter - let alone a hundred. Indeed, the twenty-line citation threshold is pre- cisely what makes the poem useful for critics and theorists interested in something other than the poem before them, while simultaneously closing off the possibility of reading the poem for critics and theorists interested in doing precisely that. What results, as we have seen with McKillop, Anderson, and Spacks, is a certain outrage directed against a poem that cannot be made to fit the institutional constraints of the academic journal article. I want to suggest, however, that the appropriative violence done to The Seasons could conversely be seen as the result of a certain critical "victimiza- tion" - in being unable to make the text of The Seasons conform to the way that we (as "literary" critics) produce knowledge, we choose to use the poem in ways that ultimately conceal the manner in which it uses us. Thomson's poem, in other words, is able to read what we write before we have written it, precisely by casting into sharp relief the constraints of our own reading and interpretive practices. The difficulty, for example, in citing long passages from Thomson's poem is the kind of problem created, not by the poem, but by the strategies we use to engage it. By choosing to dwell on either the form of the poem, as have the likes of McKillop, Spacks, and Anderson, or on highly localized points of content in the poem, like Barrell, Irlam, or Kenshur, I would suggest that we miss certain of the pivotal nuances of the poem that offer far more in the case for its overall coherence and intelligibility than pre- viously has been maintained. This is not to suggest, of course, some kind of organic wholeness for the text. But it is to suggest that readings that either denigrate or exploit the poem's putative "fragmentation" - a fragmentation that becomes self-fulfilling in the hands of Cohen above - have failed to take into account a peculiar yet clearly visible and indeed vital constituent of this poem's coherence. I mean here what I shall term the "rhetoric of disclosure," a rhetorical movement that has profound linkages with later developments in the aesthetic of the sublime. The rhetorical movements of Thomson's poem, I shall argue, walk a fine line between form and content, the elision of which point in critical treatment of the poem seems to me to conceal as much as it may reveal about The Seasons. For contrary to what Anderson seems to imply, it is not at all the "subsumption" of all discourses by one that need name the coherence and intelligibility of the piece. And if we can find another means of</page><page sequence="4">4 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY reading the poem, one not bound to "reconciling" its various discourses with each other, then despite Spacks's dismay with Thomson's diction, the entire poem - that is, the text before us - may indeed become readable, and we may finally be able to undertake analyses of the poem that read past the twenty- line, even the one hundred-line, threshold, noticing certain effects in the poem that until now have not been thought to be critically discernible (though we shall still be forced to exercise constraint in our citation prac- tices). In so doing, McKillop's bemused suggestion that we allow for the "natural drift" of Thomson's mind will need to reconceive a supposed lack of logical rigor with a new found rhetorical rigor - according to the rhetoric of disclosure - that can be said to order, down to the last detail, the movements and stakes of The Seasons. My argument for the rhetoric of disclosure in Thomson's poem - and what I mean by this phrase I will elaborate upon below - shall depend on demon- strating the degree to which Thomson's own position in the poem as a kind of grand surveyor of the human condition moves him from what would at first appear to be a state of "gentlemanly" privilege, as Barrell has argued, to something that is entirely otherwise to it, what Kant has described as a "sepa- ration from all society."11 Before, however, we can turn to Kant, it is necessary first to determine how this separation from society, which forms the dark un- spoken of gentlemanly epistemology, manifests itself in the rhetorical grounding of Thomson's poem. And to do this, we must first understand something of the nature of the gentleman himself. II. UNDERSTANDING THE GENTLEMAN Barrell's work on eighteenth-century material culture offers us important in- sights into the function and constitution of "the gentleman" of civil society: The image, then, of a society as a machine, which occurs also in writers as di- verse as Shaftesbury and Mandeville, is one by which the various members of the incalculable numbers of different occupational groups are "equally blind" to any "general combination," and the same is true of what will ap- pear in this book as another frequent eighteenth-century image of social or- ganization - also originally employed in attempts to describe the order of the universe - of society as landscape, as painting, or as landscape painting, in which the various objects in the view, in which light and shade, may appear in one perspective to be in no relation or even to be in conflict with one an- other, but can, from the correct viewpoint, be seen in "just harmony and pro- portion." If we cannot grasp the design of the landscape, that is because we are part of it - we are the trees, the hills, the light, the shade. To discover its proportion and unity, we must occupy, as it were, a position outside of the landscape, in the same way as the "master workman" is outside the machine.</page><page sequence="5">DESROCHES- ON KANT'S GENTLEMANLY MISANTHROPY 5 From what viewpoint, then, is the composition of the landscape, the working of the machine, the structure of civil society, visible?12 "The Gentleman" is the answer to Barrell's question. Barrell's contextualizing maneuvers point to two prominent metaphors for the organization of civil society - machine and landscape painting - and his important insight here is to note that whether one speaks of society in terms of mechanistic or aesthetic metaphors, one is always concerned with the spatial positioning of a criti- cal - perhaps indeed voyeuristic - gaze. Barrell's move to an aesthetic model of social organization, specifically painting and its emphasis on the interplay of light and shade, bears important implications for what is to follow in this paper. But for the moment, it is necessary to dwell specifically on what it means to inhabit "the correct viewpoint." For Barrell, it is the gentleman of landed property, who, "having no need to follow any determinate occupa- tion, had the potential to comprehend them all, if not in their specific detail - for that would have been a degree of knowledge at once unbecoming, and li- able to disturb his comprehensive view - at least in their relation to the interests of the whole."13 That is to say, it is the gentleman who is eminently prepared to take up the viewpoint proper to an all-encompassing compre- hension of civil society. Inhabiting the place most proper to discerning - to literally "seeing" with panoramic vision - the workings of an increasingly variegated social structure, it is the gentleman to whom is revealed those cru- cial glimpses of societal unity and coherence, visions unavailable to the rest of us precisely because we are participants in the very social landscape whose task it is the gentleman's to survey.14 In this landscape of sheer disclosure, the gentleman, according to Barrell, is meant to be the most conspicuous object in it; Barrell draws on Richard Steele's definition of the gentleman to suggest that "the end of his [the gentleman's] education appears to be, simply, to 'ap- pear,' to 'shine': he 'polishes' himself so that he may 'shine in the world.'"15 Whether the gentleman can in fact sustain such a self-interpretation remains to be seen, and the trajectory of this paper is drawn implacably to one possi- ble answer to this question. For the moment however, it is important to note that Barrell's thoroughgo- ing Marxist materialism suggests to us an important template for this model of gentlemanly discourse, one taken from a source not entirely articulated by the texts of the eighteenth century themselves. I refer to Marx's concept of the "societal individual," best elaborated for our purposes by Marx himself: Human labour ... no longer appears as enclosed in the process of produc- tion - man rather relates himself to the process of production as supervisor and regulator. ... He stands outside of the process of production instead of being the principal agent in the process of production. ... In this transforma- tion, the great pillar of production and wealth is no longer the immediate</page><page sequence="6">6 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY labour performed by man himself, nor his labour time, but the appropriation of his own universal productivity ( Produktivkraft ), i.e., his knowledge and his mastery of nature through his societal existence - in one word: the develop- ment of the societal individual.16 We may notice here that the connection between the societal individual and the eighteenth-century gentleman rests precisely with the ability to "stand back" from - to inhabit a position, a viewpoint outside of - the world, be it Marx's world of commodified production, or Thomson's world of aestheticized na- ture. What Marx's notion of the societal individual reminds us of, however, is the suggestion implicit in Barrell's understanding of the gentleman that part of what defines this ability to exist on the "outside" of natural/ cultural discourse is the close connection between knowledge and mastery. If, for example, it is clear that Thomson attempts to master - to make knowable and thereby visi- ble - all the variegated aspects of English life, nature as well as culture, it is nevertheless the case that part of what constitutes this masterful knowledge is the subjection of other human beings - often in the form of "blind" swains and "ruddy" milkmaids - in the landscape.17 William Leiss points this out as a blind spot in the function of the kind of all-knowing mastery at stake in both Marx's societal individual, and our Thomsonian "gentleman": Considered abstractly, the level of domination over nature in any period is the same for all men, that is, it represents a stage of development attained by the human race as such. In reality, of course, the material benefits derived from the mastery of nature have always been distributed unjustly; but equally impor- tant is the fact that, however accomplished this human mastery becomes, the antagonisms of a class divided society make it impossible for men to bring their productive system (of which mastery over nature is a part) under their control. This possibility emerges for the first time in a classless society.18 That Thomson himself construes the "domination over nature" of his world abstractly is without question - his frequent hymns of praise on English life and history suggest in no uncertain terms a position of mastery common to all the "sons and daughters of Britannia."19 Yet not only do crucial moments of the unequal distribution of power arise throughout Thomson's poem in his representation of human beings; it also becomes clear that, at certain critical moments, he is bound to lose control entirely of the representational technol- ogy he deploys to sustain his gentlemanly position. Leiss notes, for example, that the possibility of controlling humanly instituted productive systems emerges only in the Marxist dream of a classless society, a dream shared, as Barrell notes, by the eighteenth-century gentleman. But as we have noted al- ready, Thomson - Marx's "societal individual" par excellence - aspires after this dream in precisely the wrong historical epoch, at the very moment when</page><page sequence="7">DESROCHES- ON KANT'S GENTLEMANLY MISANTHROPY 7 England is experiencing not only an explosive proliferation of mercantile practices, but a proliferation of new and often murky social strata as well. The loss of one's gentlemanly technology of representation is inevitable in this situation, and it is in Thomson's loss in this regard that we see the emer- gence of an aestheticized social structure in which that structure's increased stratification and variegation moves beyond the limits of the gentleman's ability to comprehend it, creating the possibility for what I have called "gen- tlemanly misanthropy." Before we can come to this, however, it is necessary first of all to understand something of Thomson's representational technol- ogy and the manner in which it appears to succeed in "mastering" both na- ture and culture for Thomson. By this technology I refer specifically to his use of a rhetoric of disclosure, rather than any specific logic, to order the myriad and seemingly chaotically organized discourses of The Seasons. III. THE RHETORIC OF DISCLOSURE According to the rhetoric of disclosure, things and events need not be logi- cally connected in order for them to speak meaningfully to one another in the context of The Seasons. Indeed, the fact that such a logic is entirely lacking in the poem, as Thomson's commentators never tire of pointing out, should suggest to us that something other than logical coherence is at stake. By un- derstanding something of the function of the gentleman as Barrell lays it out above, we come to realize that to demand the kind of detailed coherence from the poem that characterizes contemporary critiques of it is in the first instance to attribute to Thomson a project that, for him, would have been beside the point. The Seasons , in our interpretation here, is Thomson's attempt "to shine in the world," to be that curiously disposed individual of the early to mid- eighteenth century whose social function was to not function at all, but to ob- serve, and in observing, be eminently observable himself. As the supreme "comprehender" of English civil society, second only to God in this one re- spect, Thomson's task is to synthesize all of that society's cultural/ discursive practices. To subordinate so vast a project to the exigencies of logical coher- ence would, as we might begin to suspect, make that project utterly impossi- ble. The rhetoric of disclosure, then, is Thomson's new tactic, a way to articu- late the connections among the various discourses in his poem in a manner consistent with the impossibility of connecting them all. Disclosure suggests, of course, a movement of revealing, of "bringing to light," of unfolding be- fore our very eyes the interests of the gentleman, which, properly speaking, should be the interests of us all. I conceive disclosure in Thomson's poem ac- cording to a rhetoric rather than a logic precisely because of the manner in which images of darkness and light, concealing and revealing - the play of "light and shade" - are manipulated in order to generate a sense of the gen- tleman's ability, in comprehending the workings of the world, to present</page><page sequence="8">8 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY those workings to the reader in a revelatory rather than strictly didactic or even discursive fashion. In this sense, the rhetoric of Thomson's poem orders its content. (We shall discover, however, that this rhetoric cannot ultimately remain distinct from the poem itself, cannot remain beyond the subjects it treats. This problem will emerge in more detail in due course.) I would like to treat four examples in the poem of how this works, each of which demon- strates a different variation of the rhetoric of disclosure. i) Nature's "Negligent" Garden (Spring, 494-560) Thomson begins his discussion of the springtime garden - a garden whose promiscuously self-fertilizing behavior (thanks largely to the bee's "swarm- ing millions") leads precisely to its characterization as "negligent" - in the following manner: See where the winding vale its lavish stores, Irriguous, spreads. See how the lily drinks The latent rill, scarce oozing through the grass Of growth luxuriant, or the humid bank In fair profusion decks. (494-98) In the analysis of such a moment, the logical tendency might be to take notice of the prominence of the discourse of luxury (i.e., the "lavish," the "oozing," the "luxuriant," the "humid," the "profuse"), leading one's inquiry to the in- triguing relationship evoked by Thomson here between natural and social concepts of luxury.20 But I want to try to resist this kind of interrogative trajec- tory, because it tends to orient our inquiry away from the poem. In our spe- cific case, what is interesting here is that this scene of natural luxury is fig- ured not simply in terms of profusion, but of fair profusion. It is this "fair" orientation that governs the first twenty lines of Thomson's discussion here, eliciting later such images as "a fuller gale of joy," an "unbounded beauty," "fresh verdure," and an "ethereal soul" to describe various aspects of the springtime regeneration of nature. Once this "garden" is finished, however - "At length the finished garden to the view / Its vistas opens" (516-17) - an important shift takes place. Despite the opening of these "vistas," it is pre- cisely a decrease in visibility that the earlier fair profusion has created: now the bowery walk Of covert close, where scarce a speck of day Falls on the lengthened gloom, protracted sweeps. (519-21) "Unbounded beauty" is replaced by the "covert close" of the bower, and now is undertaken a rewriting of the "fair profusion" of early spring:</page><page sequence="9">DESROCHES- ON KANT'S GENTLEMANLY MISANTHROPY 9 Now meets the bending sky, the river now, Dimpling along, the breezy ruffled lake, The forest darkening round, the glittering spire, The ethereal mountain, and the distant main. (522-25) The "breeze/7 once figured as a "gale of joy" now takes on the less pleasant (though not entirely unpleasant) demeanor of a "breezy ruffled lake"; what was once the "fair profusion" of nature has become a "forest darkening round"; and the "ethereal soul" of the flower has become the "ethereal moun- tain," at once less immanent and more forbidding. We might notice, then, a rhetorical movement in Thomson's language here, from light to darkness, from visibility to invisibility, or at least a visibil- ity made less clear by distance and darkness. It is at the moment he happens upon the eye's inability to function effectively that he changes tack one final time: But why so far excursive? when at hand, Along these blushing borders bright with dew, And in yon mingled wilderness of flowers, Fair-handed Spring unbosoms every grace - (526-29) The movement back towards light comes not only in the wake of a nature be- come increasingly distanced by a "lengthened gloom" and a "far excursive" eye, but in order to set the stage for the disclosure - the bringing to light - of precisely that which Spring "unbosoms." In this case, it is Thomson's de- scription of the "wilderness of flowers" that reflects his concern with the rhet- oric of disclosure, wherein he proceeds to describe a host of flowers in terms of their various hues, starting with the "violet darkly blue" (531), proceeding through "full ranunculas of glowing red" (538), and passing through "hy- acinths, of purest virgin white" (547), a clear gesture to Newton's spectrum from its darkest to its lightest thresholds. What we witness here, in Spring's "garden scene," is a deliberate rhetori- cal movement through various intensities of light whose purpose is, I would suggest, to mimic the kind of "bringing to light" function of gentlemanly dis- course. In this particular scene, Thomson moves from the disclosure of the general - the "far excursive" view of the "distant main" - to the disclosure of the particular - that flowery wildness which is "at hand" - and it is the movement from darkness to light that orders and prescribes the gentleman's comprehension of nature's garden, as well as the specificity of his description of the flowers themselves. We might notice, in passing, how the rhetoric of disclosure allows us to treat in relative detail precisely those effects of the poem that Spacks suggests are beyond the purview of critical technology to address - here, the effects of a sixty-six-line passage are entirely open to our interpretation, well beyond</page><page sequence="10">10 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY Spacks's twenty-line threshold. But one example is not enough to convince us that the rhetoric of disclosure can order the movements of the entire poem. ii) River "Percolation" and the Disclosure of the Deeps (Autumn, 773-835) Say, then, where lurk the vast eternal springs That, like creating Nature, lie concealed From mortal eye, yet with their lavish stores Refresh the globe and all its joyous tribes? 0 thou pervading genius, given to man To trace the secrets of the dark abyss! Oh! lay the mountains bare, and wide display Their hidden structure to the astonished view . . . (773-80) We might find no better example of the manner in which the rhetoric of dis- closure comes to order, even while seeming to imitate, the movements of na- ture, for here, "man's" genius lies precisely in his ability to "lay bare" that which lies concealed, even as this genius becomes somehow disembodied, as if part of neither Nature nor humanity. Genius replaces and displaces the "mortal eye," since the latter is not capable in the passage above of its pri- mary function of revelation - it is blind. Notable here is the rapid vacillation between light and dark, concealing and revealing. Later, this genius, still the object of Thomson's encomium, will be asked to Unveil The miny caverns, blazing on the day, Of Abyssinia's cloud-compelling cliffs, And of the bending Mountains of the Moon! (799-802) It is crucial that Thomson chooses "genius," rather than the eye itself, to do the work of unveiling mountain deeps, for it will be genius's revelatory work that will return to "man" his sight in precisely those places that are unable to be seen. Thomson dramatizes precisely this movement in his explication of the percolation theory of river production that follows directly on his discus- sion - his disclosure - of the mountain ranges of the world (seen between lines 773 and 806). He continues: Amazing scene! Behold! the glooms disclose! 1 see the rivers in their infant beds! Deep, deep I hear them labouring to get free! I see the leaning strata, artful ranged; The gaping fissures, to receive the rains,</page><page sequence="11">DESROCHES- ON KANT'S GENTLEMANLY MISANTHROPY 11 The melting snows, and ever-dripping fogs. Strowed bibulous above I see the sands . . . (807-13) In a poem ordered according to the movements of light and dark, this mo- ment stands as a particularly volatile example of the manner in which the rhetoric of disclosure is being deployed. Here we have a truly rare example of a pronounced emphasis on the first-person viewpoint (emphasized again on line 820 with "I see the rocky siphons stretched immense . . ."), its strangely ecstatic vision functioning to witness the origins of the river according to the percolation theory dominant in the early eighteenth century. Yet Thomson's rhetorical maneuvers here conflate the movements of disclosure and conceal- ment. For if the birth of rivers is disclosed according to the prevailing theory of percolation, it is nevertheless the case that it is not Thomson's eye that sees - it is still the "genius" which disclosed the mountain deeps that is at work. To hear and see that which cannot be heard or seen except in theory is to gesture to another manner of disclosure where that which cannot be dis- closed to the eye - the primary sense of the gentleman - is nevertheless, somehow, brought to light: "the glooms disclose!" When Thomson finally leaves the first person to return to the third person, it is in order to do the gentlemanly work of comprehending not only what he has just seen, but how he has just seen it: United thus, The exhaling sun, the vapour-burdened air, The gelid mountains, that to rain condensed These vapours in a continual current draw, And send them o'er the fair-divided earth In bounteous rivers to the deep again A social commerce hold . . . (828-34, emphasis added) The birth and gestation of the river is the birth and gestation of civil society, insofar as - and precisely because - both are disclosed not with the eye, but with genius: the gentleman's genius for similitude and comprehension. The movement from darkness to light, whether literal or rhetorical, is implacable. iii) Drunk in the Dark (Autumn, 502-69) Following closely on the heels of a fox hunt burlesqued by Thomson's mock- heroic characterization of it, "the tankards foam," and a banquet of carnival proportions begins, full of "smoking sirloin[s], stretched immense," "desper- ate [knives]," and "deep incision[s]." It is shortly after this that the "brown October" is summoned from its "dark retreat / Of thirty years" (519-21), and</page><page sequence="12">12 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY is brought to the light of day (if only in order to cast its partakers into a deeper night). After "Whist," "dice," "gammon," and a "romp-loving miss" serve their turn to "cheat the thirsty moments" (524-29), drink takes its right- ful place, wonderfully evoking something of a luridly generic frat party every bit as much as it describes the hell-charged,21 posthunt fraternizing: At last these puling idlenesses laid Aside, frequent and full, the dry divan Close in firm circle; and set ardent in For serious drinking. Nor evasion sly Nor sober shift is to the puking wretch Indulged apart; but earnest brimming bowls Lave every soul, the table floating round, And pavement faithless to the fuddled foot. Thus as they swim in mutual swill, the talk, Vociferous at once from twenty tongues, Reels fast from theme to theme - from horses, hounds, To church or mistress, politics or ghost - In endless mazes, intricate, perplexed. (530-42) The labyrinthine geometry of drunken conversation not only suggests some- thing of the darkness and obscurity from which this particular episode in the poem never manages to escape (except perhaps in that delusional moment when the cries of drunken rampage manage to "shake" from their slumber "the kennelled hounds / [Who] mix in the music of the day again"); it also brings to the foreground, perhaps most especially in light of twentieth- century interpretations of the poem, our own perception of the structure of The Seasons. As we noted in our introduction, most recent readings of The Sea- sons make the very charge against Thomson that he makes against his stupe- fied crew - he "reels fast from theme to theme," too fast, in Spacks's or An- derson's opinion, to be intelligible to us any longer. Thomson, for modern commentary, is nothing short of a drunkard. We have already gone some way, by now, to making the point that the rhet- oric of disclosure, the repeated movement from darkness to light, concealment to revelation - and vice versa - makes Thomson's poem intelligible in new ways, and what that means for this moment is a new understanding of how even darkness, in its rhetorical context, serves the important function of disclo- sure. The drunken squires - something like failed gentlemen - are no longer able to speak of, or see past, their condition, and Thomson, as gentleman, can comment on this precisely by depending on the movements of light and dark: Their feeble tongues, Unable to take up the cumbrous word, Lie quite dissolved. Before their maudlin eyes,</page><page sequence="13">DESROCHES- ON KANT'S GENTLEMANLY MISANTHROPY 13 Seen dim and blue, the double tapers dance, Like the sun wading through the misty sky. Then, sliding soft, they drop. (552-57) Again, the sun of daytime appears as something like a hallucination, only to more starkly emphasize the manner in which the squires themselves drop out of visibility, "sliding soft" beneath the table like a setting sun beneath the horizon. This brief glimpse of the sun serves only to cast into relief the more profound descent into darkness - into hell - that follows: Perhaps some doctor of tremendous paunch, Awful and deep, a black abyss of drink, Outlives them all; and, from his buried flock Retiring, full of rumination sad, Laments the weakness of these latter times. (565-69) Here then, Thomson's rhetorical strategy, humorous as it is, brings to light the darkest of gentlemanly habits, making the very behaviors of the gentle- man himself subject to, and the subject of, the gentleman's social function. If Thomson's poem does indeed "reel from theme to theme," it nevertheless re- mains remarkably single-minded in the rhetorical strategy it uses to present these themes. One final example will close this section. iv) A Poetics of the Stalker (Summer, 1269-1370) One cannot speak of disclosure as it pertains to Thomson's poem without at some point specifically engaging the function of the gaze - we cannot fail to notice, for example, the sheer abundance of periphrastically described "eyes" that permeate the poem, a strategy of reified abstraction that often serves to conflate the organ of sight with its object in a kind of reflexive disclosure. The set pieces of putative romance in The Seasons mark particularly volatile in- stances in which the rhetoric of disclosure and the periphrasis of the eye are seen to function with singular importance in the service of what we might refer to as the "gentlemanly eye's" penchant for the disclosure, the bringing to light, of people - especially women - in the landscape by making them part of the landscape, and consequently quite inhuman. I begin with the proliferation of the abstracted eye in the Damon and Musidora scene, which works to figure Musidora in a manner that allows her to be "brought to light" as an object in the landscape. The scene begins "close in the covert of an hazel copse" (1269), later described as the "cool retreat" to which Musidora shall go to bathe, and where the pensive Damon just hap- pens to retreat himself, there to complain, "falsely" of course, of Musidora' s cruelty. The real problem is Musidora' s "bashful coyness" and "maiden</page><page sequence="14">14 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY pride" (1278), configured significantly in terms of her "downcast eye" (1280) and "timid eye" (1301), both of which, in their anthropomorphic determina- tion, hide Musidora's love for Damon while at the same time suggesting that hers is the sort of "eye" that cannot see. It is in contrast to Musidora's downcast eye that Damon's "lawless gaze" emerges: Ah! then, not Paris on the piny top Of Ida panted stronger, when aside The rival goddesses the veil divine Cast unconfined, and gave him all their charms, Than, Damon, thou; as from the snowy leg And slender foot the inverted silk she drew; As the soft touch dissolved the virgin zone; And, through the parting robe, the alternate breast, With youth wild-throbbing, on thy lawless gaze In full luxuriance rose. (1304-13) The "alternate breast" is not all that rises here. For Damon - but also for Thomson, and by extension the reader too, since the ultimate referent of "thy" in the final lines above is by no means certain - Musidora's innocent attempt to disrobe before bathing becomes a lurid striptease, a cascade of voyeuristic gazes connecting the reader to Damon through Thomson while leaving Musi- dora out of the ocular loop, seeing nothing, entirely seen. The syntactical may- hem of the last six lines above is deliberate, calculated to displace from Damon to reader the full suggestiveness of the moment: exactly who is throbbing wildly? Exactly who - or what - is rising in "full luxuriance?" To whom be- longs the lawless gaze? Certainly, the latter cannot include Musidora, for she has become part of the machinery of nature - she is a "fair nymph" (1300), a "fearful fawn" (1320); she "sheds" a "mellow lustre" (1324), "shines" like "the lily" (1325). In bringing Musidora to light in this way, she comes to take on the very characteristics of those who gaze upon her - it is because of Damon's (or Thomson's, or our) lawless gaze that she can be said to lawlessly "[wanton] . . . beneath the wave" as she bathes (1328). In short, Musidora obeys and thereby valorizes the rhetoric of disclosure that has entirely determined her conven- tionalized presentation here, "ill-concealed" even though she is "beneath" the wave, as open to the eyes of the voyeur as the mountain deeps are open to the genius, "voyeur" and "genius" being terms interchangeable with "gentle- man," though here is behavior none too gentlemanly. Damon, now "latent" after "such maddening draughts of beauty" (1331-32) is "Checked at last / By love's respectful modesty" (1334-35); he "deems the theft profane" - that is, the theft of the vision he has not only seen, but reconstructed - and subsequently, in postcoital embarrassment,</page><page sequence="15">DESROCHES- ON KANT'S GENTLEMANLY MISANTHROPY 15 "[struggles] from the shade / With headlong hurry" (1338). It is, however, more than modesty that checks him - indeed, perhaps it is the very oppo- site - and he cannot help but leave the residue of his transgression: but first these lines, Traced by his ready pencil, on the bank With trembling hand he threw - 'Bathe on, my fair, Yet unbeheld save by the sacred eye' Of faithful love: I go to guard thy haunt; To keep from thy recess each vagrant foot And each licentious eye. (1338-44) Despite his assurances, Damon - pencil at the ready - can no more protect Musidora from "each licentious eye" than he can protect her from himself. The sacred eye's replacement of the eye's profane thievery only serves to em- phasize the licentiousness of Damon's eye, and the inevitability of our being co-opted by that lurid gaze. Here, the hermeneutics of vision, far from protect- ing Musidora, serve instead to seal her fate - already having been reduced to the animal machinery of nature, she is now transmogrified into inanimate stone: With wild surprise As if to marble struck, devoid of sense, A stupid moment motionless she stood: So stands the statue that enchants the world; (1344-47) If Musidora is, in the end, brought back to life, it is only in order to sanction the perverse disclosures that have taken place so far. Her "terror [vanishes]" when she sees that the note is in Damon's hand, and she then proceeds to write a note of her own: she with the sylvan pen Of rural lovers this confession carved, Which soon her Damon kissed with weeping joy: 'Dear youth! sole judge of what these verses mean, By fortune too much favoured, but by love, Alas, not favoured less, be still as now Discreet: the time may come you need not fly.' (1364-70) Perhaps the only thing Damon is not guilty of is discretion. How Damon can read these words so soon after leaving to guard Musidora' s retreat raises questions as to whether he ever left the scene of his crime at all. Here, the rhetoric of disclosure has worked decisively to order the procedure of this set</page><page sequence="16">16 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY piece. Its stakes - the gendering of Musidora, the criminalizing of Damon - have rested entirely on the configuration of gazes - in which our own is im- plicated - that bring this sylvan scene to light. From the "covert of an hazel copse," to Musidora's "mellow lustre," to the description immediately fol- lowing this scene, where "The Sun has lost [its] rage" (1371), we witness here another manner, one perhaps slightly more subtle, in which the rhetoric of disclosure is seen to work, and where the movement from dark, to light, to dark again continues to weave its rhetorical way through the poem.22 IV. THE SHINING GENTLEMAN UNDISCLOSED We here put forth the priority of the rhetoric of disclosure in The Seasons - best conceived as an iterative and transverse movement from light to dark, dark to light - as the paste holding the poem together. It does not supersede the presence of other discourses in the poem - were it to do so, its efficacy in rendering the poem coherent as a poem would fail. If it does provide a meas- ure of coherence to the poem, that coherence has to do with the consistency with which the interstitial spaces between discourses are treated, rather than the links between the discourses themselves. It seems to me best to under- stand the rhetoric of disclosure as a strategy for clearing the very space neces- sary for the emergence of the plethora of subjects about which the poem speaks. As such, it may be conceived as perhaps the best possible strategy for the gentleman to adopt in undertaking the work most proper to him, that is, the disclosure, the bringing to light, of the coherent yet varied constitution of civil society. It is inevitable, however, that the gentleman's strategy for disclosure, the very mechanics by which things (or people) can be disclosed, must itself sub- mit to gentlemanly scrutiny, and when this happens, Thomson's poem takes some remarkable turns. There is, in particular, one part of Thomson's land- scape that he cannot disclose, and it is the very thing that makes his poem possible: Prime cheerer Light! Of all material beings first and best! Efflux divine! Nature's resplendent robe, Without whose vesting beauty all were wrapt in unessential gloom (Summer, 90-94) Thomson's supremely inchoate representation of the sun - it discloses all with precisely that which conceals - still obeys the rhetoric of disclosure in its move from "Light" to "gloom." But in this particular instance, it calls atten- tion, as rhetoric, to the fundamental inability to disclose its own machinery - light is a "robe," but the gloom also "clothes." The season of summer - the</page><page sequence="17">DESROCHES- ON KANT'S GENTLEMANLY MISANTHROPY 17 season of sun - allows Thomson to speak of "rocks, and hills, and towers, and wandering streams" (89), the secret by which God's "system rolls entire," martians (108), the seasons themselves (121), vegetation (129), the "mineral kinds" (134), of war and peace and commerce (136-39), of lovers and pre- cious stones (140-59), of the life of dead creation (160), of cliffs and deserts (163-65), and even of his own poem, for to him, "Nature's volume broad" is displayed (192). But he cannot speak, properly speaking, of the sun, of light, or of God, that nexus of figures which became entirely interchangeable for writers in the eighteenth century. Thomson's rhetoric of disclosure allows him to reveal the world, but the conditions of possibility of revelation are "vested" by the very thing that reveals. Who is capable of staring directly into the sun? The sun appears in order to disappear. Thomson's poem allows him to approach the fundamental problems with the assumptions of disclosure that underpin gentlemanly existence in a way that would not have been possible outside of an aesthetic discourse. If the gentleman "shines," as Steele (and Barrell following him) would have it, there are nevertheless dark and subterranean forces within gentlemanly dis- course itself that augur that gentleman's destruction. Thomson alights upon these forces in his classical account of the chain of being, an account that, once again, uses the movement from darkness to the light of day to make its point: Let no presuming impious railer tax Creative Wisdom, as if aught was formed In vain, or not for admirable ends. Shall little haughty Ignorance pronounce His works unwise, of which the smallest part Exceeds the narrow vision of her mind? As if upon a full-proportioned dome, On swelling columns heaved, the pride of art! A critic fly, whose feeble ray scarce spreads An inch around, with blind presumption bold Should dare to tax the structure of the whole. And lives the man whose universal eye Has swept at once the unbounded scheme of things; Marked their dependence so and firm accord, As with unfaltering accent to conclude That this availeth nought? Has any seen The mighty chain of beings, lessening down From infinite perfection to the brink Of dreary nothing, desolate abyss! From which astonished thought recoiling turns? Till then, alone let zealous praise ascend</page><page sequence="18">18 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY And hymns of holy wonder to that Power Whose wisdom shines as lovely on our minds As on our smiling eyes his servant sun. (Summer, 318-41) What might at first seem to be a standard recitation of the eighteenth- century interest in the chain of being, and the hierarchizing or ordering ten- dencies implied by it, becomes in Thomson's gentlemanly hands a source of great volatility to gentlemanly existence. The rhetoric of disclosure cer- tainly participates in the structure of the chain - it is the darkness associ- ated with "haughty Ignorance" as well as the "critic fly" that is dispelled by the light of "Creative Wisdom" (i.e., God), closely associated, as we see at the end of the passage, with his "servant sun." The passage is meant to reinforce the internally coherent wisdom ordering the "mighty chain of beings," reminding us that only God is in a position to conclude "That this availeth nought," i.e., able to pronounce concerning the structural attributes of the chain. It is precisely in reaffirming the source of the great chain - the "Creative Wisdom" - that there arises a fundamental challenge to the very raison d'Ãªtre of gentlemanly epistemology. For what better description of the gentleman exists than precisely he who possesses the "universal eye" capable of com- prehending, integrating, "the unbounded scheme of things"? Is Thomson's poem not the very epitome of the attempt to both articulate and demonstrate the cultural possibility of this all-seeing eye? And yet, to position oneself thus is precisely to become the critic fly, shackled to the "feeble ray" of an igno- rance characterized by a lack of awareness of one's limits, "blind presump- tion." Here then we encounter in its specificity the double bind - the impossi- ble task - that constitutes gentlemanly being: to see as does God without claiming Godhead. Here, I would like to suggest, is the crucial moment for our argument con- cerning the rhetoric of disclosure. For it is the very possibility of disclosure - of bringing to light "the unbounded scheme of things," the "mighty chain of being," that names the very reason for being of Thomson's poem. What are the consequences, when confronted with the God-decreed structure of being, of claiming as Thomson does here that no man is capable of unpacking the world, that the gentleman, by his very nature, is a hallucination? The gentleman - like "astonished thought" in the face of being's desolate abyss, "recoiling turns" - turns away from the impossibility of his ownmost task. Being in the face of God is like staring into the sun at noon, and it is telling that a poem entirely ordered by the rhetoric - the necessity - of disclo- sure retreats from the gentleman's ownmost tool for that disclosure. We have already seen how Thomson's attempt to speak of the sun remains, in a sense, invisible, given its configuration as a clothier of things whose own trappings must always remain hidden behind the blinding, dazzling material with</page><page sequence="19">DESROCHES- ON KANT'S GENTLEMANLY MISANTHROPY 19 which it clothes. The gentleman, far from attempting to imitate the sun and its mechanics of disclosure, instead seeks reprieve from them: Welcome, ye shades! ye bowery thickets, hail! Ye lofty pines! ye venerable oaks! Ye ashes wild, resounding o'er the steep! Delicious is your shelter to the soul As to the hunted hart the sallying spring. . . . (Summer, 469-73) The gentleman is this hunted hart, and he is hunted by the impossibility of his gentlemanly calling. Against Barrell's suggestion, the gentleman does not polish himself, does not "shine"; he prefers the shade, a dark retreat from the light that is not reserved for the season of Summer alone, but point- edly takes place in each of the four seasons. In Spring, Thomson recurs "to the rural seat / Whose lofty elms and venerable oaks / Invite the rook ..." (766-68) in order to watch "the gentle tenants of the shade" (789), simultane- ously becoming one of those tenants. In Autumn, he is the happiest of men who far from public rage Deep in the vale, with a choice few retired Drinks the pure pleasures of the rural life. (Autumn, 1236-38) Indeed, from this retreat, he, from all the stormy passions free That restless men involve, hears, and but hears, At distance safe, the human tempest roar. (Autumn, 1299-1301) And finally, Winter, the last of Thomson's manifold retreats from the gentle- manly task of disclosure: Now, all amid the rigours of the year, In the wild depth of winter, while without The ceaseless winds blow ice, be my retreat, Between the groaning forest and the shore, Beat by the boundless multitude of waves, A rural, sheltered, solitary scene; (Winter, 424-29) We might notice that in all retreats, Thomson retires to a "rural" seat, but his retreat in Autumn is particularly telling - here is the stark renunciation of the gentleman's dependence on the eye, and the move to the ear; the gentleman no longer sees at all, but hears instead. We shall skirt the question of the rela- tionship between country and city in order to dwell more particularly on the</page><page sequence="20">20 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY stakes of Thomson's gentlemanly poetic. What is of interest to us is the sheer persistence of this desire to retreat from the very spotlight that is the birthright of the gentleman, and it is in this retreat that we may be able to iso- late a burgeoning new aesthetic that can be seen to come into its own in the thought of Immanuel Kant. V. THE GENTLEMAN'S "FANTASTIC WISH": SUBLIME MISANTHROPY We have attempted thus far, in drawing attention to the rhetoric of disclosure that orders The Seasons, to reconstitute Thomson's poem as a readable one. It may be an ominum gatherum , but it is so on its own terms, and while the poem may defy the strict logic one casually demands of the attempt to bring to- gether such a wide variety of topics, it seems clear now that it does obey, if not a logic, then a rhetoric of its own. But what accounts for the strange be- havior of the gentleman in this poem? Barrell, we should recall, has pointed out that the very function of the gentleman is to "shine," to "appear," to pol- ish himself in order that he may become the spectacular spectacle of civil so- ciety. What could explain the gentleman's disappearance? Part of the explanation may come through the manner in which language works in Thomson's poem to foreground the weaknesses of the gentlemanly epistemology described by Barrell. Michel Foucault has written that, from an extreme point of view, one might say that language in the classical era does not exist. But that it functions: its whole existence is located in its representative role, is limited precisely to that role and finally exhausts it. Language has no other locus, no other value, than in representation; in the hollow it has been able to form.23 From our point of view, Foucault' s reading does not seem quite so extreme at all, for it is the representation of civil society (and beyond) at stake in Thom- son's poem, and it is the rhetoric of disclosure that functions in the name of the coherence of that classical project. In other words, if language is required to represent, it is not necessarily required to mean. And Thomson himself makes it clear that meaning and language may find themselves at odds in the classical project of gentlemanly representation: Behold yon breathing prospect bids the Muse Throw all her beauty forth. But who can paint Like Nature? Can imagination boast, Amid its gay creation, hues like hers? Or can it mix them with that matchless skill, And lose them in each other, as appears</page><page sequence="21">DESROCHES- ON KANT'S GENTLEMANLY MISANTHROPY 21 In every bud that blows? If fancy then Unequal fails beneath the pleasing task, Ah, what shall language do? ah, where find words Tinged with so many colours and whose power, To life approaching, may perfume my lays With that fine oil, those aromatic gales That inexhaustive flow continual round? Yet, though successless, will the toil delight. (Spring, 467-80) It may seem as if this passage explicitly resists Foucault' s formulation - where imagination must inevitably fail to represent nature, language cannot hope to succeed. And yet, we find the function of language precisely in this representation of the impossibility of representation, for it is this reflexive configuration that names the "hollow" in which language functions. The final line above says, in effect, "What matter that language cannot mean, so long as it can represent, even if all it can represent is our inability to represent?" What makes this moment so compelling is Thomson's understanding not only of the limits of representational technology open to the gentleman - i.e., language may function, but imperfectly - but the consequent limits upon, and perhaps indeed the impossibility of, the gentleman's singular task and reason for being, that is, the representation of all facets of civil (and some- times not so civil) society in their mutual coherence. The crucial sense of reflexivity, of reflection, that imbues Thomson's un- derstanding of his own representational techniques - i.e., imagination and fancy - may be precisely that which augurs the disappearance of the gentle- man, the necessity for retreat that overpowers the compulsion to "shine." But there is more at stake, and it is not until Kant attempts to aestheticize a cer- tain aspect of gentlemanly behavior that we come to understand the manner in which the gentleman's world is irrevocably changed by this sense of reflec- tion: There is indeed a misanthropy (very improperly so called), the tendency to which frequently appears with old age in many right-thinking men, which is philanthropic enough as far as good will to men is concerned, but which, through long and sad experience, is far removed from satisfaction with men. Evidence of this is afforded by the propensity to solitude, the fantastic wish for a secluded country seat, or (in the case of young persons) by the dream of the happiness of passing one's life with a little family upon some island un- known to the rest to the world. . . . Falsehood, ingratitude, injustice . . . are so contradictory to the idea of what men might be if they would, and conflict so with our lively wish to see them better, that, in order that we may not hate them (since we cannot love them), the renunciation of all social joys seems but a small sacrifice. This sadness - not the sadness (of which sympathy is</page><page sequence="22">22 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY the cause) for the evils which fate brings upon others, but for those things which men do to one another (which depends upon an antipathy in funda- mental propositions) - is sublime, because it rests upon ideas, while the for- mer can only count as beautiful.24 We discover that the gentleman is not able to sustain the vision of himself set out by Steele and maintained by Barrell - the gentleman's "fantastic wish" is not to shine at all, but to avoid the broad light of day. Just like the sun, the gen- tleman cannot be, paradoxically, a figure of shining beauty, but instead config- ures the darkness of inchoate sublimity. What is even more remarkable than this paradox is the reason that makes it so. If we recall that the gentlemanly ability to see and disclose the structure of civil society carries with it the impli- cation of mastery over nature and humanity (the latter clearly demonstrated in the set pieces described above), it would seem that it is Thomson's recogni- tion of the gentleman's participation in a project of mastery that finally dis- closes his own distaste for it. Thomson's retreat, in Autumn especially, is undertaken in order that, if he must still be cursed to hear the dim roar of humanity striving against itself, he need no longer see it, order it, divine its structure and workings. Thomson comes to recognize, in other words, some- thing of his own participation in, and perhaps even production of, those social habits that subjugate humanity - not to mention humanity's subjugation of nature (also a frequent subject of Thomsonian tirade in The Seasons). The toil of the gentleman can indeed delight, so long as he shines in the world, but when faced with his own reflection, with the very human stakes of a toil doomed forever to be "successless" - cast adrift by the functioning of language - for- ever, ultimately, to behold the damage to - not constitution of - social meaning that the gentleman perpetrates; when the gentleman, that is to say, reaches the very limits of his epistemological construction, he must look away from himself, must hide himself, must face this improper, because improperly named, misanthropy, the moment at which he himself is no longer human but a social function, a trope for sadness at the state of things that he himself has created, realizing that all that was ever disclosed in his attempt to discern the structure of civil society was the structure - the function - of his own gaze. The rhetoric of disclosure discloses, in the end, what this poem - frag- mented, uncitable, and unfinished as it may be - means to say, and it is some- thing to which Romanticism will never cease to refer in its various ways: the gentleman looks upon himself on pain of blindness; he looks upon himself on pain of death.

Barrell has noted that much of the literature produced after 1700 takes as part of its project the representation of English society in terms of its increasing diversification and stratification, the result of a burgeoning mercantile economy. Christopher Hill gives a good sense of just how much civil society - and especially the distribution of wealth - in England had changed in the century leading up to 1700. In the early 1600s, "men noted as evidence of the topsy-turviness of the times that some merchants were as rich as peers; [by 1700], many a noble family had salvaged its fortunes by a judicious marriage in the City" (The Century of Revolution, 1603-1714 [London, 2002], 2). 15.

There are even more sinister implications concerning this kind of mastery when it comes to the representation of the feminine in the landscape, and I shall be returning to this question in some detail shortly. 18. William Leiss, The Domination of Nature (New York, 1972), 85. 19. See for example, Summer, 77-81, 1479-1594. All references are to James Sam- brook's edition of The Seasons and The Castle of Indolence (Oxford, 1972). We should note, however, that of the 115 lines Thomson devotes to "happy Britannia" in this context, only 15 concern her "daughters." More telling is the fact that Britannia's sons are referred to by name and accomplishments, her daughters referred to by their conventionally dis- membered and aestheticized body parts. This is an important point to make, I think, not only because it highlights the rather obvious inequalities in the distribution of power, but perhaps more significantly because in rendering the feminine anonymous, it becomes subject to the masterful gaze of the gentleman while being unable - like Bacon, Newton, Locke, or the many others named herein - to look back. In other words, women cannot be gentlemen, a situation that bears important implications for what is to follow. 20. 1 mean that the discussion of luxury in Thomson's poem would best be thought to contribute to the discourse of luxury in the eighteenth century, rather than to an under- standing of the poem's coherence which we are after here. Nevertheless, a few words are necessary. In the early eighteenth century, commentary on the question of luxury was largely confined to its denigration as a corrupting influence on the polity. Shaftesbury writes in 1711, for example, that "[we] see the enormous Growth of Luxury in capital Citys, such as have been long the Seat of Empire. We see what Improvements are made in Vice of every kind, where numbers of men are maintained in lazy Opulence, and wanton Plenty. 'Tis otherwise with those who are taken up in honest employment . . ." (cited in Stephen Copley, Literature and the Social Order in Eighteenth-Century England [London, 1984], 24). In 1721, Berkeley suggests that "Frugality of Manners is the Nourishment and Strength of Bodies politic. It is that by which they grow and subsist, until they are cor- rupted by Luxury; the natural Cause of their Decay and Ruin" (Copley, 90-91). But around the same time (1714-25), Mandeville has already suggested that "if once we de-</page><page sequence="24">24 THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY part from calling everything a Luxury that is not absolutely necessary to keep a man alive, that then there is no Luxury at all" (Copley, 99). And by 1742, David Hume can quite safely contradict early judgments on luxury: "If these superfluous hands [of men of leisure] apply themselves to the finer arts, which are commonly denominated the arts of luxury, they add to the happiness of the state" (Copley, 106). For an enlightening study of the subject, see John Sekora's Luxury: The Concept in Western Thought , Eden to Smollet (Bal- timore, 1977). 21. As Sambrook notes, Thomson's language here deliberately reproduces the various dispositions of Milton's hell-bound hosts in Paradise Lost; see 228n. 22. Sambrook writes of this scene in an editorial comment that "the implausibility of Musidora's feat of carving suggests that T. may have regarded this whole episode as agreeable nonsense" (74). Agreeable or not, I would suggest that this piece is not non- sense at all, but carries with it very serious stakes, particularly concerning the representa- tion of the feminine in the pastoral setting. I have not had time to elaborate on another important set piece concerning the figures of PalemÃ³n and Lavinia, but precisely the same concerns arise there, and are more obviously, if less suggestively, apparent. Lavinia is "Recluse amid the close-embowering woods" (Summer, 207); PalemÃ³n can see "not half / The charms her downcast modesty concealed" (229-30). But she is, to PalemÃ³n, a "delicate . . . form / By beauty kindled" (237-38), and as "he [views] her ardent o'er and o'er" (259), he longs to disclose to the world her beauty, and to take her for himself. He does this in a most remarkable way: Oh, let me now into a richer soil Transplant thee safe, where vernal suns and showers Diffuse their warmest, largest influence; And of my garden be the pride and joy! (278-81) PalemÃ³n does not even wait for her reply, taking her "blush" for consent (299-300). It is Lavinia's mother's "bright gleam" of joy - not any reaction of Lavinia's - that finishes the scene, and concludes the movement from darkness to light. What little voice did exist for Musidora is shriven here - Lavinia, part of Palemon's "reaper-train," is, in being elevated beyond that labor, reduced to the thing she once la- bored to harvest, nothing more than a plant in Palemon's garden. Thomson's conceit here - PalemÃ³n reaping a reaper-woman - is configured according to the rhetoric of dis- closure where Lavinia is brought from the darkness of "close-embowering woods" to the light of "vernal suns." The fact that her humanity is lost - in much the same way that Musidora's is stripped of hers - should occasion our attention as something far more ur- gent, and sinister, than "agreeable nonsense." 23.
