Finally, the theory of the origin of Tragedy from the mimetic representations at the funerals of great men can draw no single piece of valid evidence from Dr. Frazer's book. Our author has wisely kept in reserve his own larger inductions: but one can discern the theory in his mind that ghost-cult has generated much of the ritual and forms of higher religion. We must wait for his later volumes before we try to test this question. LEWIS R. FARNELL. NOTES AND QUERIES ON ANTHROPOLOGY. Fourth Edition. Edited by B. FREIRE-MARRECO and J. L. MYRES. The Royal Anthropological Institute, 1912. Sm. 8vo, pp. xii + 288. 5s. net. WHILE reading the above book my regret was great that I did not meet with it twenty years ago, when I first began to take notes on anthropology. It would have aided me considerably in any work I have done, and would undoubtedly have enhanced the value of that work by helping to a more scientific investigation of the subject. I cannot speak too highly of the suggestions it offers to the student for consideration, nor can I commend it too heartily to my colleagues in Africa, or to those who are living and working, in one capacity or another, among primitive peoples in any part of the world. It will suggest topics for study, will keep the enquirer on the right lines, and help the student to arrive at the heart of things. When the list of experts who prepared Notes and Queries is read down, it may seem most presumptuous either to criticise the 392</page><page sequence="2">Reviews. 393 queries, or to suggest any additions. Yet I would, with all diffi- dence, step in where others may fear to tread; and my excuse for doing so is that, as I have read this book with its series of questions, I have imagined myself back in the wilds of Central Africa, with few books of reference and no means of ascertaining the meaning of some of the technicalities used, such as Keloids (called Peloids by others), etc. Most men of ordinary general knowledge know what anthropomorphic means, but the same cannot be said of phyto- morphic and hylomorphic,-(Chambers' Dictionary gives neither), -and the men for whom I presume this book to have been prepared have had no special training in the nomenclature of anthropology, and are often cut off for years from a good reference library. A little etymology would have been helpful not only to the definition of the words, but also in fixing their meaning in the worker's memory. I notice that the colour of the eye (or the iris), of the skin, etc. is to be noted, and in my experience scarcely two men will call an intermediate shade by the same name. I felt this difficulty some years ago, when collecting fish for the Natural History Museum. They asked me to describe the colours on the fish directly they were taken from the water. Now, although I am not colour-blind in the slightest degree, yet, not having served my time in a millinery establishment matching shades of colour, my vocabulary respecting colours was that of an ordinary man, and to what I called by one name an expert might have given a quite different name. I mentioned this difficulty,-a very real one,-and the authorities supplied me with a book of colours which was most helpful. I would, therefore, suggest that a page or two of the Notes should be devoted to examples of colours, with names or numbers to each, i.e. a page giving shades of colour for the iris, and another with the various tints of brown for the skin; it would make for accuracy. The names and illustrations given in the book of patterns and designs of the principal geometrical motives, and of decorative art, are very useful, and will help the student to say accurately in a word or two what would otherwise demand a descriptive paragraph or a drawing. Something on the same lines for colours would standardise them, and we should all mean the same thing when we ?mentioned a shade of colour. 2C</page><page sequence="3">394 Reviews. The section on measurements coming at the beginning of the book is likely to appal the new student desirous of taking up the study of anthropology, for, in the first place, he will in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred lack the proper instruments for taking accurate measurements, and there is no note stating wliere he can procure them, or their probable cost. And, again, the novice sees about him in one and the same tribe men of all sizes, every one of whom will yield different measurements, and he cannot see the use of such elaborate details, and will be inclined to scoff at the whole study as utter nonsense. Those who think that anthro- pometry is the keystone of anthropology may be unwilling to consign this section on measurements to the appendix as a subsidiary subject, but it might have served its purpose there much better than where it is. At present it is an unnecessary hill for the student to climb into the kingdom of anthropology. I should also like to suggest that the following phrases in italics should be incorporated in future editions. On page 3, under " colour of the skin" " Is the skin of those people who live on the hills of a lighter shade than those who hive in swampy valleys ?" Out of some fifty boys that lived in our school at San Salvador I noticed that those who came from the valleys had darker skins than those who came from the hills. It would be interesting to know if this is generally the case. Under " customary postures" on page I3, it would be useful to note the position of ordinary folk before chiefs and men of importance. On the Lower Congo an ordinary person is expected to sit cross-legged, or on his haunches, before his chief, and to stretch out his legs before him is regarded as an insult worthy of severe punishment, either by beating, slavery, or death. On page 15, in the paragraph on "throwing, tossing, and shooting," it would be helpful to know not only the difference between spear-throwing and stone-throwing, but also the method of holding the spear. Most white men, before throwing a spear, hold it with the tips of their fingers, but Congo natives hold the haft of the spear across the palm of the hand. T'his gives more force to the throw, and greater accuracy of aim. Is this method general among primitive peoples ? Under "personal cleanliness," on page 17, I think an observa- tion respecting the nearness or remoteness of streams suitable for</page><page sequence="4">Reviews. bathing should be made. I have noticed that those who live near streams bathe regularly; but those living at a considerable distance from streams, who procure their supply of water from a spring issuing from the side of the high hill on which they live, very rarely take a bath, yet they belong to the same tribe as the others. There is no mention of the pulling out of eyelashes under the subject of personal appearance. It would be interesting to put on record at what age is cicatrization begun ? (p. 25). In one tribe I noticed that the operation took place in very early infancy, during the first year; and in another tribe not until the fifth or sixth year. In the former case the whole face was scarred, and in the latter only a line down the forehead. Does each wfe own a house for herself and children ? (appropria- tion of houses, p. 34); are any relishes or sauces prepared, such as white ant relish, white-bait sauce, and a relish of red peppers and peanuts ground together ? (condiments, p. 43); what is the efect of native wine and beer as compared with that of alcoholic drinks im- ported from Europe ? Is old wine put with tle new to hasten fer- mentation ? (p. 46). These are a few other questions that might be worth a place among the many others in the book. On p. 51 several kinds of nets are mentioned, but the box net is not among them. This is oblong, with sides, ends, and bottom, but no top or lid, and varying in size up to fifty by twenty feet. One end and two sides are fastened by stakes driven in a suitable place in the river, and the other end is dropped to the bottom. The fishermen make a wide detour, and, beating and kicking the water, they drive the fish before them into the net, and then the loose end is raised and fixed, thus enclosing the fish. The Libinza Lake people were the only folk I saw on the Upper Congo employing a net 9f this shape. The question, "What are the favourite colours?" is asked under dyes on page 87; but before that is put there should come another question, viz., "What colours are procurable in the locality ?" for I have seen more than once colours that appeared to be favourites pass into disuse on the introduction of a greater variety of colours from outside sources; and I have seen the bright, gaudy colours of cheap trade cloth left untouched when more sober, and even sombre, colours were imported into the district. 395</page><page sequence="5">Reviews. There is one use for broken pottery not mentioned on p. 92, and that is eating it. The Boloki people preserved the broken pieces of their Libinza Lake pots for nibbling when they had a craving for eating clay. I would suggest under the heading of metal-working (p. 95), an enquiry as to the position a smith holds in the community; and how do his neighbours regard the smithy, the anvil, and the fire, etc. To the question of " How many children had your father and mother?" (p. I20), there should be a note to warn the enquirer that primitive peoples are often averse to counting their children, lest the spirits should hear them and one or more of the children die; and for this reason absurd numbers are often given, not to mislead the friendly enquirer, but to deceive the evil spirits; and, again, certain cousins, nephews, nieces, etc., are frequently spoken of as children belonging to a person. Upon the subject of " European Questions and Native Answers" (p. III), I would like to sound a note of warning to the student entering on a fresh field of enquiry amongst a people whose language has not been reduced to writing, and that is to be sure that the native uses 'Yes' and 'No' in the same way as our- selves; e.g. ask a Lower Congo man the following question, Ku- kwenda ko e? (Will you not go ?), and, if he is not going, he will answer Elo (Yes), where we should say 'No.' The European would understand by the answer that the native was going, but the native would have in his mind that the supposition of his not going was quite correct, and to that he answers 'Yes.' This view of negative questions causes many misunderstandings, and the only way to avoid them is by the employment of questions in the affirmative. Having reduced to writing one African. language, and helped to reduce another, I should not recommend the method suggested and illustrated on p. I96. Such a method would necessitate a great amount of unnecessary writing of slips, e.g. if there are, we will say, 2000 verbs in the language under consideration, the writing of a slip for every element underscored, as given in the illustration, would demand the writing of eight thousand slips, and the introduction of every new element would mean the writing of two thousand slips for each. I could give a Congo language 396</page><page sequence="6">Reviews. 397 which has about twenty-five elements, or prefixes and suffixes, with which almost every verb combines, and to underscore and write a new slip for every element with every verb would entail a burden of work altogether unnecessary. It is better to take some examples of the prefixes and suffixes, find out the force of each, write each prefix and suffix on a separate slip with some illustrations of their uses, and write the root of the verb with its definition on a slip by itself, leaving room on the slip for any peculiar or idiomatic uses of the verb. With a very little practice it will be easy to separate the root from its accretions, and it will be necessary only to note any new roots on a single slip, and not all the elements with which it may combine. In this way, instead of using many thousands of slips, only 2025 will be necessary for the verbs. With the other remarks on learning a new language I agree, and think that they are most helpful. The learner must have a proper respect for the language he is studying, and must not think that, because the people are uncivilized, therefore they are talking a jargon like a lot of monkeys. A sincere respect for the language and the people who are using it will help him to burrow into its secrets; but a contemptuous attitude will result only in a very superficial skim- ming of the surface. In language work, as in other anthropological investigation, we need a kindly sympathy. Missionaries possess unique opportunities for the furtherance of anthropological studies, and it is to be hoped that this book of Notes and Queries will be increasingly used by them, and that in the near future they will do for anthropology what they have already done for language. By knowing men's views of life and death, their conceptions of spirits and the spirit land, their view of " sin " in this life and of punishment in the spirit land to which they are hastening, a missionary can preach his doctrines more effectively, and for this reason, among many others, every mission- ary needs more than a mere superficial knowledge of his flock's customs, habits, and thoughts, and, until the Handbook of Folklore becomes accessible by a new edition, I know of no book better able to help him in systematic and scientific study than the one now under consideration.
