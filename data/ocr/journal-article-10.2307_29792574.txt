Peterson Archaeological and environmental investigations of two buried terraces in the coastal plain in Carcar, Cebu, Philippines, have documented components of pre-Contact coastal subsistence patterns. Two wetland pa leosols containing Iron Age ceramics, marine shells, and other materials were exposed at the Baksihi Site in barangay Ocana by recent downcutting in the Ocana River. The first is 285 m inland from the modern seashore; the second is 36 m furtherinland^but abruptly higher by 80 cm. Explana? tion for this anomaly was sought by correlation with Pacific Ocean high stand models. However, radiocarbon ages of the terraces were determined to be similar, in the period AD 1000-1300. The radiocarbon age of the lower terrace is 895?35 years before present (ybp) (Wk-14490); the higher terrace was slightly younger at 797?31 ybp (Wk-14491). While compati? ble with possible Holocene Pacific-wide high stands of one meter and two meters elevation above present sea level, the disparity in elevation be? tween the two terraces is unresolved by this model.

Deposition of marine shell in the lower level of the soil suggests a model of stilt-house residency in the wetland fields where detritus from the houses was incorporated into the wetland soil, and also demonstrates the harvesting of littoral and benthic marine shellfish species along with, minimally, sugar cane and taro as a coastal subsistence adapta? tion with roots very deep in Island Southeast Asian antiquity. Archaeological Background The Island of Cebu, located in the Visayas region of central Philip? pines, is sheltered from heavy seas and the first blows of monsoon and ty? phoon weather. A high central cordillera runs almost the whole length of the island, and coastal terrain is often narrow but rugged. In the coastal plains of what is now Cebu City, and in the town of Carcar, there are fa? vorable conditions for wetland agricultural as well as extensive littoral set? tlement. In fact, the earliest Spanish entradas were attracted to these areas, and chroniclers commented on the stilt-house villages that lined the shores. These sixteenth century observations comment on the wealth of the landscape, and the evidence for regional trade. Nonetheless, the Span? ish pulled up stakes within a few years and moved to Panay and Manila because the local Cebuan landscape could not support the Spanish as well as it could the native villages. Despite ethnohistorical evidence for moder? ate development of wetland rice as well as a great diversity of arboricul tural and marine subsistence items, there was not sufficient arable land for high productivity (Alcina 1960; Scott 1994). The earliest known human occupation in the Philippines dates from 45 or 50,000 to 28,000 years before present (ybp) from a jaw frag? ment found in Tabon Cave in Palawan (Dizon 2003a); a few other Paleo? lithic period sites have been found dating from 7,000 to 12,000 ybp. Neolithic age sites from as early as 5,000 ybp are more numerous, but only a few sites have been extensively investigated and these have been mainly from caves and rockshelters in the Cagayan River Valley, includ? ing the extensive excavations at Lal-lo shell midden (Ogawa 1993). Late Neolithic period red-slipped and stamped and incised pottery has been re? covered from recent excavations at the sites of Magapit and Nagsabaran (Dizon 2003a). As do similar assemblages at the coastal site of Dimolit (Figure la), these potteries demonstrate participation in regional South</page><page sequence="3">BAKSIHI SITE 129 0 Figure 1. Locations of the Baksihi Site, Marigondon Cave, and the Dimolit Site. east Asian and western Pacific migration patterns (W. Peterson 1974). Late Holocene occupation appears to have expanded dramatically throughout the entire archipelago. Numerous sites have been found and reported on coastal as well as inland terrain from Iron Age period occupa? tion. First millennium AD settlement apparently expanded steadily, but flourished in the early second millennium as Philippines settlements began to participate in pan-Asian trade networks. Chinese export porcelain ce? ramics appear along with local earthenware ceramics and dominate as? semblages in the upper horizons of sites in this "Porcelain Age", especially from the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries AD onward (Bacus 2004). Late Ming Dynasty porcelain provides a marker for the period of</page><page sequence="4">130 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY Spanish intrusion in the region, along with a few items of Spanish material culture such as iron nails. Interior sites on larger islands contrast sharply with coastal occupation, and include evidence for hunting/gathering peo? ples living contemporaneously with village agriculturists and fishers (Grif? fin 1989; Griffin and Estioko-Griffm 1985). The settlement chronology, dispersion and interaction among these peoples and sedentary peoples is little known, but is expected to have varied with changing climatic and eustatic regimes. Archaeological investigations in Cebu have focused on Late Iron Age and early Spanish contact period sites. Otley Beyer described the abundance of "Porcelain Age" sites, and noted only one discovery in Cebu of a Neolithic adze, from the Guadalupe area above Carcar in the Cordil? lera. Dean Worcester commissioned Carl Guthe to inventory sites. His survey method, however, was to ask for the whereabouts of sites with blue and white porcelain, so he effectively limited his inventory to that period. Excavations by Karl Hutterer (1973), Masao Nishimura (1988), and the National Museum (2001) in the Plaza Independencia area in the historic core of Cebu City unearthed features, artifacts and burials from mid second millennium settlement. Rosa Tenazas, who had worked on Hut? terer's project, also conducted research at the late Iron Age jar burial site of Magsuhot in Negros Oriental for her doctoral dissertation. At about the same time, a retired American serviceman showed her a complex of thir? teen late Paleolithic and Neolithic open sites in Carcar. "All are located within a radius of about 3 km, encompassing an interior portion of Barrio Ocana and Sitio Napo in the municipality of Carcar, approximately 50 km south of Cebu City" (Tenazas 1978: 207). Two of these sites were exca? vated in May, 1979, and produced a large quantity of marine shell, shell blades, polished adzes, ochre, hammerstones, mortars, quartz and obsidian tools and flakes, and what Tenazas asserted to be a Neolithic child burial. No radiocarbon ages were assayed from the site, but this was a clearly dif? ferent and earlier component than the commonly reported late Iron Age settlements that were reported mostly from shoreline settlement. Sol heim's sites in his early work on the Visayan Iron Age also focused on the shoreline, mainly because of access from his seaborne survey (Solheim 2004a). This brief overview of Cebu archaeology indicates, first, that there is tremendous density of archaeological sites, and second, that there is considerable chronological depth, even if finding sites from some periods has been elusive.</page><page sequence="5">BAKSIHI SITE 131 Archaeological Landscapes in Cebu We began archaeological research in Cebu in 2001 and 2002 with a survey of Spanish Colonial sites, and excavations at an early seventeenth century convento called Salug, or Sialo. It had been built in 1599 and was destroyed in a Moro raid in 1622. It was an appealing first site for investi? gation because of the narrow time frame, which might provide a baseline assemblage of contact-era Visayan ceramics that could be used to sort out the terribly mixed assemblages at coastal, shoreline sites. Our goal was to identify as many discrete, single component sites as possible for excava? tion so that we could slowly build a chronology from discrete episodes of settlement. As the next paper shows, Salug turned out to be useful from that perspective, but also for the dating of a well-developed paleosol into which the foundation stones for the convento were laid. The radiocarbon ages from the bottom and top of the soil ranged from AD 990-1180 to 1140-1298 at 95 percent probability. This demonstrates a reasonably sta? ble paleoenvironment conducive to pedogenesis over a 200-300 year pe? riod of development in the early second millennium AD. The carbon isotope ratio was relatively high in both samples, indicating a charcoal source from C3 photosynthesis, and therefore possibly biased by an old wood effect. Nonetheless, the dates were stratigraphically correct, and even if later in age, the soil was forming prior to Spanish contact and sug? gests a very favorable climatic regime in the early second millennium. We began to look for other terrain in the Carcar area that might contribute to our knowledge of landscape evolution and to a predictive model for the archaeological sites that we were finding. Contrary to other regional models for the Visayas, we were finding late Iron Age and "Por? celain Age" sites throughout the island and in high elevation terrain in the cordillera, suggestive of different ways of modeling settlement than sim? ply focusing on the coastal fringe. For example, while the Spanish often commented on the abundance of stilt houses along the coast, they just as often found them to be empty when the inhabitants had fled into the inte? rior (see Peterson 2003: 53-55). This suggests that shoreline sites may have been just one node of highland-coastal settlement, or perhaps even nodes in extensive marine or circulatory migration. The discovery of shoreline sites only from very late Iron Age and from Contact period set? tlement raised serious questions about the stability of shoreline terrain. The examination of current models for global and regional sea level</page><page sequence="6">132 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY change leads to the realization that there would have been significant im? pact on coastal Cebu. High sea stands would have not only destroyed ear? lier settlement but would likely have constrained shoreline settlement to the landward edge of high still stands. Sea level models for the western Pacific demonstrate a mid-Holocene rise of 1.8 to 2.0 m above present sea level (Fletcher and Jones 1996; Dickinson 2002). In Bohol, a range of mid-Holocene high stands from 0.6 m in the southwest to 1.3 m at the northeast end of Panglao Island was attributed to localized tectonism and possibly subsidence at the southwest end of the range (Berdin et al. 2000). Carcar is across the Bohol Sea from the north end of Panglao. No studies have been done of tidal notches or other phenomena that might retrodict paleoshorelines in Carcar, but their effects are noted in the region, and could range anywhere from 0.6 to 2.0+ m above sea level (Siringan et al. 2000). We began to explore for opportunistic features in the landscape that could shed some light on paleoshorelines. Holocene Cultural and Environmental Context Low mean sea level associated with the last full glacial period ca. 22,000 ybp was* more than 100 meters below present sea level (Fletcher and Jones 1996). This exposed substantially more land mass than is now present throughout the Philippine Islands and created land bridges throughout island Southeast Asia. In other areas, such as along the island of Cebu, 100+ m of steeply sloping terrain was exposed. During the Holo? cene era, rising sea level obliterated many earlier high stands, but the highest, during the mid-Holocene ca. 2,000 to 5,000 ybp, constrained Neo? lithic era settlement to what are now relict high stand shorelines that are still extant in many locales. Climate change throughout the Holocene also framed settlement and maritime opportunities. Periods of steady trade winds and equable climate are thought to have occurred during the mid Holocene and in the early second millennium, AD 1000 to 1300, a period referred to as the Little Climatic Optimum (LCO) (Fletcher and Jones 1996; Nunn 1997). These periods promoted maritime migration as well as agricultural development throughout the region. Alternatively, periods of unstable wind and weather before and after LCO promoted uncertain mari? time travel and disrupted agricultural productivity (Nunn 1997). Through? out the Holocene, migration among the islands of the archipelago as well as settlement opportunities along the coasts and on inland farming terrain would have been significantly impacted by changing sea levels and cli</page><page sequence="7">BAKSIHI SITE 133 mate. The opportunities for settlement and migration appear to have ex? panded during some periods, such as those characterized by very low sea levels in the full glacial period 22,000 ybp and in periods of high sea stands, from 2,000 to 5,000 ybp and, to a lesser extent, from AD 1000 to 1200. Sites from the full glacial period are unknown in offshore localities that are presently underwater; Tabon Cave in Palawan, however, demon? strates human occupation of the Philippines during this period. Settlement during the mid-Holocene high stand and the LCO high stand appears to have flourished because a dramatically higher number of sites has been reported for each period. Caves and rockshelters have been attractive magnets for human settlement, for investigators have often found archaeological rejnains at undisturbed shelters. However, the opportunities for finding significant and pristine rock shelter deposits are fast fading as looters and developers dig out these localities. Submerged rockshelters, such as the one at Marigondon (Figure 1) in Lapu-Lapu City in Cebu, located at 30 m below present sea level, on the other hand, offer new and previously unstudied sites with great potential for intact stratigraphy and well-preserved depos? its. Investigations targeted at modeling Holocene migration and climate change relative to eustatic sea level are currently under development. These investigations will examine archaeological landscapes,. geomor phology of relict shorelines and terraces, and submerged features includ? ing Marigondon Cave (Peterson, Griffin, Dizon and Siringan 2004). In terrestrial contexts, however, systematic investigation of alluvial terrain may be as productive for site discovery as well as, ultimately, de? velopment of landscape models for chronology and distribution of settle? ment. Work at Baksihi, in Cebu, has led to the documentation of roughly coeval tropaquept soil deposits from AD 1200 that were likely developed as agricultural terrain by late Iron Age residents along the Cebu coast. These wetland soils contain modified marine shell and ceramic artifacts as well as paleoenvironmental indicators including fossil pollen and phyto liths. Pilot studies reporting taro (Colocasia sp.), sugar cane (Saccharum sp.), disturbance species such as Trema and opportunistic agricultural field weeds, demonstrate that this terrain situated in freshwater terraces behind the LCO era coastline was being managed for agricultural or horticultural production (Scott-Cummings 2004).</page><page sequence="8">134 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY Migration Models for the Philippines Beyer (1947) first proposed a wave model of migration through the Philippines, with an earlier wave of hunting-gathering peoples during the Paleolithic followed by waves of migration by maritime agriculturists from Southeast Asia. More recently, Bellwood and others have proposed a route for this wave or clinal model from the Fujien coast of southern China through Taiwan, the Batanes, Luzon and so forth south into the Sulu Sea and thence west and also east into Polynesia (Bellwood 2004). Other data, however, suggest a center for linguistic and genetic di? versity in the Sulu Sea and Sulawesi area (Pallesen 1985). The Polynesian rat, for example, appears to have diverged from that region, and glotto chronological studies identify a number of key terms diverging from that region. Other models of Polynesian migration question the usefulness of progressive and unidirectional migration, and suggest that any long-range voyaging was not "rapid and continuous but punctuated by short bursts of activity" (Anderson 2000). In any case, wave or clinal models may not be as appropriate in maritime contexts as other possible models. Present-day fisher communi? ties, for example, in the Gigantes Islands in the Visayan sea and from Dalaguete, Cebu, travel great distances from point to point in a vast mari? time field or network to fishing opportunities (Zayas 1994, Seki 2000). Seasonal monsoonal wind shifts favor leeward settings; as these alternate from summer to winter, fishing communities shift accordingly. Temporary berthing accommodations at friendly (and often genetically related) locali? ties along the coasts are traditionally visited. Rather than a continuous or clinal pattern of migration, the movement of maritime communities is punctuated and pointillistic. The generalized movement may advance re? gionally, but not unidirectionally. Historical trade patterns in the Sulawesi Sea are similarly sporadic and wide-ranging, depending on news of widely divergent trading opportunities (Southon 1995; Fox 2000). This migration is analogous to, and may have its roots in, point-field spatial perception such as modeled by Lehman and Herdrich (1980) from ethnographic, his? torical and linguistic work in Southeast Asia. The practice of sea nomadism itself created a holistic pattern of migration, far from the simple wave or particle models first proposed by Beyer with his wave model of migration through the Philippines from the mainland and thence to the South Pacific. The Austronesian model from Taiwan through the Philippines and thence eastward proposed by Bell</page><page sequence="9">BAKSIHI SITE 135 wood and others is more elaborated (Bellwood 2004), but large gaps in the archaeological record so far do not provide indisputable evidence, and the model is contrary to much of the linguistic evidence. Further, it does not account for the introduction of plants such as taro into the Philippines, or for the curious paucity of evidence for rice or rice cultivation in early de? posits. That many of these resources may have been introduced in later, episodic, colonizing visits is likely, rather than on a monolithic wave or even particle advance through simple budding migration. This suggests another way of modeling migration through the Phil? ippines that obviates linear directionality. The whole maritime field may have been vibrant with punctuated extensive, and non-linear pulses of movement by small fishing and trading communities. Recent horrible news of the Indian Ocean tsunami of 26 December 2004, suggests another trigger for both constant migration and also for maintenance of low coastal infrastructure investment and a mobile lifeway: the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration tsunami database map for the region shows a significant number of historical incidents ringing the coastlines of island Southeast Asia (National Geographic Data Center 2005). Volcanic erup? tions may have also led to migration pulses (see Warren 2002). Pacific Marine Ethnographies Austronesian speakers sustained a global migration beginning at least as early as 5,000 years ago in the Sulu Sea of what is now northern Indonesia and southern Philippines. This fulcrum of Pacific settlement had been settled earlier by sea-faring nomads from the coasts of southern China and Southeast Asia. It was a critical nexus from which an emergent cultural and subsistence practice was formed and exported in pulses and waves. The Nusantao, as defined by Solheim (2004b), was a sea nomad tradition whereby small band and family groups migrated along Southeast Asian coastlines, seeking seasonal opportunities and shelter from prevail? ing storms, and taking advantage of the shifting productivity of coastal marine resources. They also lived opportunistically on land, almost cer? tainly gathered plant resources for carbohydrates, and also nurtured and cultivated a variety of plants that then accompanied them in their expan? sive migrations northward, to the west through Java and Sumatra to Madagascar, and, most impressively, to the east through the South Pacific. Plants such as rice were apparently transported from origins in the middle Yangtze Valley of China (MacNeish and Libby 1995), down the</page><page sequence="10">136 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY Yangtze to the China Sea and south along the Fujien coast; to Taiwan, to Southeast Asia, and, finally, into the Sulu Sea region (Higham 2002; Sol heim 2004a). In the Sulu Sea region plants from tropical Pacific Islands were added to the mix. Sugar cane, Java almond {Canarium indicum) and taro (Colocasia) from New Guinea probably were transported westward; the earliest known origin for them is in the Kuk Valley of New Guinea, as early as 7,000 years before the present. Bananas such as the Australimusa variety originated in New Guinea, but many varieties were spread widely throughout the region. The high diversity of cultivars reported by the Franciscan priest Alcina in the seventeenth century Philippines attests to the antiquity of their endemism in the region. He counted over two dozen varieties in the Visayan islands of Cebu and Panay (Alcina 1960). Recent ethnographies of nomadic sea cultures such as the Anda manese Malay, Moken of western Thailand and southern Myanmar, and Bajau of the Sulu Sea, or even of semi-sedentary fishing communities in the Philippines, provide evidence of the sporadic and highly variable char? acter of sea nomadism. Fishing communities on Leyte in the Philippines, for example, historically maintained fishing waters far afield from their home villages in the Central Visayas. From October to May, when the southern monsoon blew in storms from the south and west, the villagers fished and resided in the lee, northward sides of islands several hundreds of kilometers away near Mindoro and Palawan. During the northern mon? soon they sheltered and fished on the calmer lee coasts in the south. From year to year these climatic patterns shifted and the fishing communities responded flexibly to their opportunities and limitations. While out from homejmse, they maintained client relations with onshore villagers who provided seasonal housing in coastal stilt villages and who shared com mensally their own vegetal production in exchange for fish. In recent years market economies have developed to intermediate in the exchange net? work, and provide cash and capital for fuel and motors. The salient character of these nomadic marine cultures has been their resilience, their flexibility, and their capability for rapid, long? distance travel. Their vehicle for successful migration was certainly their knowledge of the sea and their simple and expedient technology for har? nessing marine resources, including the outrigger sailing canoe, fishing lines and nets, and lures and fishing strategies. The Moken of Myanmar are at the simplest end of the spectrum; other peoples, such as the Pa lauans, reside permanently in coastal villages, and practice a mix of on? shore cultivation, nearshore marine gathering, and inshore and offshore</page><page sequence="11">BAKSIHI SITE 137 fishing. Masse (1990) documented the lifeway of Palauan villagers, and compared their present lifeways with data from archaeological sites, espe? cially middens. He concluded that: ...inshore fisheries provided the vast bulk of fishes throughout the en? tire known sequence of Belauan culture history. There is a slight de? crease in the consumption of pelagic fishes, such as skipjack tuna, between each period. This suggests that pelagic fishing may have been somewhat more important to the original colonizers than to later popu? lations; but even during the early period pelagic fishes (excluding el asmobranches) constituted only about 4% of the total catch. This predominance of inshore fishes appears to be typical through? out. . .probably the result of the richness of the inshore reef system and the fact that capture methods for inshore fishes (e.g., nets and basket traps) are more reliable and productive than those methods used for the capture of pelagic fishes (Masse 1990). Littoral gathering is an obvious component of marine harvesting. Its greatest residue consists of durable, long-lasting shells of which rela? tively greater preservation is expected, in contrast to cartilage and bone from fish species; in fact, one quandary of midden excavations is whether the relative absence of fish bone is a matter of site taphonomy rather than actual resource use. The evidence for greater inshore and littoral harvest? ing, however, from Masse (1990), suggests that the relative abundance of shellfish over offshore fish and fish generally found in Pacific coastal middens conforms to expectations from ethnographic studies. Shellfish harvesting produces huge middens in some Pacific coastal areas, but even so is characterized by low productivity. Meehan studied coastal shellfish gathering among the Gidjingali in Arnhem Land of the Northern Territories of Australia. She wrote that: In terms of the weight of anim?l flesh alone the contribution made by shellfish ranged from as low as ten percent in May to thirty percent in January. When these contributions are converted to energy intakes the proportions are even lower: six percent in May to seventeen percent in January. Thus, at no time during the year were shellfish more than a supplementary food in the diet...the gathering of shellfish involves the participation of a broad spectrum of the population with regard to age, physical fitness, and skill. People who play little part in the foraging arena, such as old women, heavily pregnant women and children, take part along with a normal range of huntresses. In general, shell gathering</page><page sequence="12">138 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY requires no special physical strength or skill, nor the expenditure of much energy....the actual time devoted to the gathering of shellfish on any one day is only about two hours, depending on the state of the tide. During that short time a skilled woman can collect shellfish equivalent to about 2000 kcal. For the rest of the day women are free to participate in other activities if they so desire.. .Shellfish are one of the dependable food sources in the Anbarra diet...they come from guaranteed sources...because shellfish are collected consistently, they provide a small but constant source of fresh protein (Meehan 1982: 159-160). Marine colonization took many locally adapted forms, which had in common a relative dependency on the sea for subsistence as well as transit. The emergence of land-based subsistence practices complemented marine resources and in many instances, especially in places like the Ha? waiian Islands, superceded them in importance. The mix of terrestrial and marine subsistence items is not presently known for coastal sites in the Philippines, but midden and rocksheiter deposits do provide support for a highly diverse package of littoral, offshore, and terrestrial elements in the diet. Housing styles in coastal settlements throughout Southeast Asia and in the Sulu Sea region consist of impermanent stilt-houses perched over shallow intertidal or freshwater lagoons, sheltered in mangrove thick? ets or further inland (Pelras 1996). These houses were typically con? structed of bamboo, nipa thatch, and hardwood posts. Their use-life would have been certainly less than ten or fifteen years as the posts would have been highly susceptible to rot at the waterline or in the highly oxidative wetland soils below. Stilt houses are highly expedient for coastal habita? tion. They can be efficiently built and abandoned, rebuilt with scavenged materials, and no doubt formed a shifting residency. Characterization of the Wetland Soils at Baksihi The Baksihi paleosols seemed at first to be a reasonable place to examine mid-and late Holocene high sea stands (Figure 2). The two in? vestigated terraces are only about 37 m apart. The lowest terrace is 285 m from the present shoreline, and the highest begins about 321 m inland. The terraces appear to have been lagoonal environments formed geologically along the coastal plain. The lower end of the higher terrace was truncated by a chute or channel having very coarse gravels and cobbles. In both cases the soils are characterized as tropaquepts, or tropical wetland soils,</page><page sequence="13">BAKSIHI SITE 139 Figure 2. Location, protiles and sample artitacts showing relative stratigraphic position and distance from shoreline. which may have sustained alternating wet and dry episodes as well as emergence and subsequent development as dry land soils. Each was cov? ered by 1.5 to 2.0+ m of fine massive alluvium with lenses of incipient pedogenesis that suggest multiple periods of burial and stability. The soil survey of Cebu comments on the deep burial of coastal terrain in the early nineteenth century, with as much as 2.0 m deposited over older soils. This was also observed at the Salug site. The higher terrace is 80 cm above the lower terrace. This discrep? ancy in elevation is suggestive of episodic high sea stands. We measured elevations for the terraces, and found that the top of the paleosol in the higher terrace was 3.1 m above present mean sea level, while the top of the paleosol in the lower terrace was 2.3 m above present mean sea level. These were both considerably above an expected high stand of 1.8 to 2.0 m. However, this part of central Cebu is in an area of active tectonism. In Kalingyaon, directly upstream from the mouth of the Ocana River, vol? canic intrusives tower over the upper valley, and have even been a site for gold prospecting. Springs in the floor of the canyon are panned for gold, and a recent effort to develop pit mining was stopped by community pro</page><page sequence="14">140 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY test. Samples examined for phytoliths and diatoms for this study had to be specially floated numerous times to remove volcanic dust from the sam? ples. This local tectonism fits the model of localized effects of region-wide high sea stands (Berdin et ah 2000). The upper terrace appeared to be a possible candidate for a fresh? water lagoonal environment perched above and behind the marine shore? line, and its ceramic assemblage appeared to have been quite different from that of the lower terrace. Could the lower terrace have corresponded to Patrick Nunn's (1997) proposal for a late Holocene, AD 1000-1300 high stand of 1.0 m above present sea level? Both terraces would have been about 1.0 m above the regional averages, but local tectonism could account for that. This tentative model broke down quickly as the radiocarbon ages were reported (Figure 3). Both were nearly in the same age range, early second millennium AD. The higher terrace was dated to 793?31 BP, or 1185-1285 AD in the 95 percent probability range, while the lower terrace dated to 895?35 BP, or 1030-1220 AD in the 95 percent probability range. The dates were derived from solid carbon extracted from one liter of soil, and so are somewhat imprecise. Nonetheless, the gross ranges are very comparable. The lower terrace sample had a moderately low carbon iso? tope ratio, suggesting possibly C4 plants, while the higher terrace had a ratio of 24.7, suggesting a C3 pathway, or possibly an old wood effect for the date of the higher terrace. These ages also compare very closely with the paleosol development at the Salug site, suggesting a period of rela? tively stable landform development contributing to pedogenesis and the formation of fresh-water lagoonal environments on the coastal plain. There also appears not to have been significant overbank flood deposition during this period that would indicate a relatively dry climate promoting instability in upland soils, when generally drier soils denuded of vegeta? tion are more prone to erosion during rainstorms. Climatic conditions dur? ing the Little Climatic Optimum appear to have favored Cebu with even and adequate rainfall. However, the subsequent burial of the paleosols suggests that later climatic regimes, perhaps coupled with human impacts on upland terrain, led to considerable soil erosion and transport of sedi? ments to the coastal plain and possibly into nearshore marine environ? ments. The 80 cm difference in elevation was puzzling given the relatively coeval formation of the soils. Discoveries in the pollen assemblage pro? vide tentative data supporting a model that these natural terraces were</page><page sequence="15">BAKSIHI SITE 141</page><page sequence="16">142 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY FIGURE 1.

Pollen spectrum from soil profiles at Baksihi Site (Scott-Cummings 2004).</page><page sequence="17">BAKSIHI SITE 143 used as pondfield environments perched above and behind the marine shoreline (Figure 4). Further, the appearance of a dense artifact assem? blage and marine shell that apparently settled into mucky wetland soils, suggests that stilt housing was constructed over and adjacent to the pondfield terrain. Similar housing is widely found today in the Philippines, and ethnographies from Sabah (Sather 1997), among the Bugis (Pelras 1996), and elsewhere often document stilt housing in lagoonal and pond? field terrain where a broad mix of agricultural crops are cultivated as part of a wet dooryard garden. The pollen results from two samples in this pilot analysis show that the lower terrace once had disturbance species such as Trema and cheno ams, along with Cocos nucifera and other arboreal species, and unspeci? fied Poaceae. Of special note is the discovery of phytoliths from the genus Saccharum (Figure 5). Alcina had observed apparently native Sacch?rum in the Visayas in the late seventeenth century, commented that it had Visayan names as well as the Spanish cana dulce, and that an intoxicant called intus was made from it. He said that the Spanish became embor racha when they "experimented" with it (1960). The upper terrace sup? ported similar disturbance indicators and arboreal pollen as well as Colocasia taro. The lower terrace also had mangrove pollen, suggesting its proximity to stable mangrove habitat along the coastline, something that has been documented for periods of coastal still-stands from the mid Holocene and, possibly, from later periods (Fujimoto et al 1996). Bamboo and Arecaceae (palm) phytoliths were found in both sam? ples, indicating a freshwater lagoonal environment. The species count, while rather limited, suggests a shaded environment with few low-growing plants, and possibly mixed or alternating use of the environment. "Mangif era-type" (Figure 5) may indicate mango, which would have been part of the canopy overhead. Acacias and other large canopy trees might not have contributed pollen or phytoliths to the assemblage and may be invisible (Scott-Cummings 2004). The great value of these samples, aside from the few species that they have identified, is the demonstration from this pilot project that pollen and phytoliths are preserved in the matrix, and will be accessible to a longer project. Ceramic Assemblages at Baksihi The ceramic assemblages of the two soils at first glance suggested quite different eras of settlement. The higher soil contained earthenware</page><page sequence="18">144 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY ceramics with cord-marked decorations, notched rims, and circle stamping. Most of the sherds were plain earthenware with a gray to red? dish paste and no slipping or decoration. These motifs can be found in late Neolithic as well as in Iron Age assemblages in the Philippines, and so are not exclusively indicative of early settlement. Nonetheless, the absence of tradeware sherds or decorative forms contributed to initial speculations that the upper soil was associated with mid-Holocene high stand shoreline settlement. In contrast, ceramics in the lower soil included numerous sherds with carved-paddle chevrons and other decoration in the Kalanay tradition described by Solheim (2004a) with late Iron Age motifs. Also in this as? semblage was one blue on white Jingdezhen porcelain sherd that could have been from the late sixteenth century along with two forged iron nails (Diem 2004). The sixteenth century dating of these items contradicts the earlier age of the bulk charcoal radiocarbon dates from lower levels in the soil, which is four hundred years earlier than these items could have been deposited. Also, the quantity of decorated earthenware ceramics drops considerably in post contact contexts. This suggests that considerable mix? ing may have occurred in the upper strata, an explanation that is consistent with agricultural tillage or mucking of these soils. Marine Shell at Baksihi Marine shell was deposited in the lower levels of both soils, sug? gesting that pedogenesis occurred late in the history of the soils and that in their earlier stages the soils probably lacked pedogenic structure. The presence of a number of fine laminated lenses interlayered with otherwise upward fining sediments in the lower strata of the soil (lower coarser sediments indicating the settling-in of pond environments) contributes fur? ther to this interpretation of their history. Also in both soils, marine shells were mixed into the 20-40 cm of artifact deposits. In the seaward soil the species of shellfish are more diverse and the quantity is greater. Turbo spp., Strombus spp., Murex, and Tridacna are examples of the benthic and offshore species found in the assemblage. Both littoral zone and brackish bivalves were found. Several of the specimens had been broken at the apex of the shell indicating that they were harvested for the meat of the shellfish. The upper soil lacked the diversity of the lower unit, but had numerous specimens of small Strombus spp. with broken apices, indicat? ing, again, that they had been harvested for their meat.</page><page sequence="19">BAKSIHI SITE 145 The distribution of shell was ubiquitous throughout the exposed extent of both soils, suggesting that the shell had been harvested, trans? ported to stilthouses clearly out of their habitat or zone of natural trans? port, and disposed of as household trash over the threshold into the shallow water of the freshwater lagoon below. These middens accumu? lated in lacustrine sediments that appear later to have undergone incipient pedogenesis and mixing from agricultural practice in their upper levels. The heavy marine shell settled to the bottom and is also found incorpo? rated in pieces in the upper levels. Many of these species are benthic and would have required shallow diving rather than simply littoral zone gath? ering practices. This suggests a quite active exploitation of offshore spe? cies as a protein component of the coastal diet. The actual numbers of shell recovered thus far do not suggest that they were a major part of the diet; otherwise large and deep middens would be expected. Nonetheless it appears that the diet was diverse and included both terrestrial and marine components. Further investigation of these soils with detailed analyses of marine faunal remains may contribute further data toward interpreting coastal lifeways. Specifically, aside from marine mollusks, what were the other components of marine subsistence? Inshore fishing is typically the largest component in coastal settlements, but deepwater fishing also con? tributes significant protein to the diet in many Pacific localities. In addi? tion, analysis of terrestrial protein resources such as pig or deer, both found in the Salug deposits (Peterson et al 2003), could also have con? tributed to coastal Cebuan diets. Taro and Sugar Cane in the Late Pre-European Philippines The introduction of Southeast Asian and Western Pacific cultigens into the Philippines is generally assumed from the fact that rice, taro, ba? nanas, sugar cane and many other species were thoroughly integrated into subsistence practice by the time the Spanish began recording ethnohistoric data in the region. Alcina's descriptions in the late seventeenth century clearly support the long-term adoption of all these plants into local prac? tice (Alcina 1960). However, there is little archaeological or paleoenvi ronmental data supporting their occurrence at sites earlier than the sixteenth century. Ward (1995) evaluated the pollen chronology for sam? ples from the Laguna de Bay near Manila, and inferred that there were significant environmental changes attributed to early agriculture ca. 2000 ybp. He surmised this from the accumulation of charcoal and the increase</page><page sequence="20">146 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY in grassland species during this period. However, he found no pollen from known cultigens in the soil column that he collected in wetland terrain in southern Luzon. Stevenson et al. (in press) reported significant changes in the landscape, including a loss of pine pollen ca. 4,500 ybp below 600 m elevation, along with possible charred millet husks from deposits dating as early as 4,500 ybp, and indirect evidence for rice agriculture beginning around 200 ybp. White et al (2004), examining environmental change in Thailand from samples dating throughout the Holocene, also documented significant environmental change around 1500 ybp. This inference was based on discovery of charcoal in the soil column, but also on an increase in adventitious species of plants. These were interpreted as weedy species associated with rice paddy agricultural fields. They did not find any direct evidence for rice. Spanish ethnohistorical sources indicate that rice was a part of the agricultural mix at contact, but was not widespread in the central Philip? pines. Rather, upland dry farming of millet (Ceb. dawa) was more preva? lent. Rice paddy farming was found in the Mandaue area of Cebu, but was scattered and insignificant especially in subhumid and semiarid parts of Cebu and other Visayan islands. The narrow coastal plain in many areas of the Philippines limited the amount of terrain available for paddy farming, and certainly restricted the availability of freshwater from the short, low order streams that flowed onto the plains. In contrast, the higher order river systems such as in the Cagayan and Pampanga Valleys of Luzon and in Mindanao in the Agusan Valley were found to support more rice culture than in the central islands of the archipelago. No evidence for rice was found from pollen or phytolith assem? blages of the two agricultural soils sampled during this project. Negative evidence is not conclusive, but suggests that the ethnohistorical record of highly diverse but low productivity unspecialized farming practices pre? dominated. The terrain around these freshwater lagoonal environments at Baksihi supported a diverse, shady environment with abundant opportuni? ties for expedient plant propagation from tubers and culms with probably minimal husbandry required. This diverse mix of cultigens provided for year-round subsistence patterns changing with the relative maturity of species. While carbohydrate species such as millet and rice were important constituents of the diet, they may not have been widely available. Alcina enumerated numerous arboreal species with considerable intraspecies di? versity. The interplanting and management of mixed crop farming systems such as upland swidden for millet and root crops appears to have been</page><page sequence="21">BAKSIHI SITE 147 widely practiced, but only as part of much broader expedient practice. Ar? eas suitable for millet were readily adaptable to maize that was introduced by Europeans from Mexico which helps to explain why this higher yield? ing crop was so quickly integrated into Philippines agricultural practice. Rice, while a desirable part of the diet, appears to have been primarily an import item in much of the Central Philippines at the time of European contact, and production was inadequate in central Cebu to support Spanish as well as Visayan subsistence. We should not assume that rice agriculture was an essential component of the coastal adaptive package in the Philip? pines. Summary Even though the age of the deposits was, disappointingly, not late Neolithic, there is yet potential in Baksihi for finding buried remnants of coastal Neolithic settlement here, as has already been demonstrated at Di molit, since at least upland sites have been found in the immediate vicin? ity. Comparison of this landscape with that in Dimolit would be very instructive of late Neolithic period settlement in coastal terrain. It is puz? zling that so feW Neolithic age sites have been found, and documenting these at Dimolit and Carcar relative to shoreline models and landscape analysis may contribute toward discovery of more sites, especially if we know better* where to focus efforts, such as in areas of Holocene high sea stands; exposed paleosols, and hilltop and piedmont localities. A regional geomorphological model is needed that incorporates these effects as well as late nineteenth and early twentieth century site burial and channel avul? sion along the coast. This pilot study of two paleosols in the coastal plain near Carcar, Cebu, has contributed some data but even greater potential for the study of landforms and archaeology in the central Philippines. The data indicate that late Iron Age coastal residents were participating in a resilient and di? verse lifeway that included terrestrial production of taro and sugar cane, among possibly other as yet undocumented species, and also partook of the littoral and offshore benthic harvesting of marine mollusks and gastro? pods. If they were harvesting either inshore or deep water fish, that evi? dence has not yet been addressed in these deposits. At the nearby site of Salug in the early seventeenth century there is evidence that deer and pigs were being butchered at the site of an early Spanish convento (Peterson et al 2003). The position and the structure of these two remnant buried ter</page><page sequence="22">148 PHILIPPINE QUARTERLY OF CULTURE &amp; SOCIETY races suggests that they were freshwater lagoons perched behind and slightly higher in the landscape than a coastal brackish mangrove swamp. Further, from the discard of household trash and artifacts, it appears that the coastal residents were occupying stilthouses perched above the lagoon much as contemporary coastal dwellers still do throughout the Sulu Sea and parts of the Indonesian and Malaysian archipelagoes. Ceramic decora? tion and form are clearly part of the Philippine-wide Kalanay and, per? haps, earlier styles; the appearance of blue on white Chinese porcelain pottery and nails demonstrates connections outside the Philippines as well. Not all the pieces are yet available to address the coastal adaptation of late Iron Age Visayans, but the present investigations provide a few clues as well as a methodology to continue work at this site as well as others in the Philippines to supplement the present data. In the meantime, we propose to continue to investigate the coastal sites in the Ocana River valley with an eye toward building a long-term chronology of what must have been a vibrant cultural landscape. The dis? covery of Visayan sugar cane pollen grains in AD 1000-1300 wetland soils in Cebu is quite remarkable considering that the later episode of Spanish colonial sugar cane production would completely transform this environment five or six centuries later. The Visayan production of intus, the fermented cane juice, participated in an Asian and western Pacific cul? tivation of Saccharum that has been documented from at least as early as the fourth or fifth millennium BC in the Kuk Highlands of New Guinea. But there is equal argument for the origins of both sugar cane and taro from mainland Southeast Asia and South Asia (see Massal and Barrau 1956, Vaughan and Geissler 1997, and Pollock 2000), and it is possible that Saccharum at the site in the form of phytoliths could have been of several species. The Spanish introduction oi-cana dulce, an Asian plant transported through western Asia and Africa to the Canary Islands and the New World, had an enormous impact on the Philippines when commercial plantations were fully developed following the 1840s. Not only did this introduction transform social and economic patterns, but it also led to the mass wastage of landscapes that ultimately buried and protected the paleo sols that are the subject of this study. Ironically, sugar cane in antiquity had been part of a highly diverse agricultural system that apparently sus? tained landscapes; following its commercial introduction it became a monocrop disaster contributing to massive soil erosion and polarization of rich and poor in the postcolonial Philippines.</page><page sequence="23">BAKSIHI SITE 149 REFERENCES CITED Alcina, Francisco S.J. 1960(1668) Historia de las Isias e Indios de las Bisayas.
