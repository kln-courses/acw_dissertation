<plain_text><page sequence="1">Something Old, Something New: John Lewis Gaddis's "New Conceptual Approaches" THOMAS J. MCCORMICK John Lewis Gaddis's "New Conceptual Approaches to the Study of American Foreign Relations: Interdisciplinary Perspectives" is essentially a two-part essay. The first half attacks the field's existing generalizations and theories for their alleged oversimplification and inability to explain complex historical data. Much of this covers well-trod ground, including prior treks by Gaddis himself, and seems unlikely to change many minds or open up new intellectual avenues. The second half challenges the profession to overcome its parochialism and "systemic innocence" by exploring comparative history and by analyzing America "as part of an international system." Much of this is barely charted territory and holds great promise for broadening and sharpening our conceptual units of analysis. Part one of Gaddis's essay is a familiar "realist" critique of revisionism, corporatism, and liberal-developmentalism. Its chief charge against the first two is that of "reductionism"—that is, both reduce "the explanation of complex events" to "single causes" or "single categories of causes." It is high irony indeed that the critique itself neatly illustrates reductionism—reducing complex paradigms and arguments to simplistic economic determinism. Revisionism was never intended as monocausal materialism, although some mediocre practitioners of the genre may have vulgarized it as such. Its conceptual focus has always been the conflict of values between notions of community and the imperatives of profit making; and America's "tragedy" was the inability to reconcile the contrary needs of equity and efficiency, despite the often heroic efforts of neomercantilists, corporate liberals, and voluntarists. In the hands of William Appleman Williams and other revisionists, the emphasis has been less upon the structurally determined needs of capital accumulation than upon key individuals, their complex weltanschauungs, and the free will to act upon such worldviews. That underdeveloped structuralism and overdeveloped idealism are, in my judgment, weaknesses of revisionism. (So too may be its ethnocentrism and its relative inattention to the international system.) But what it is not is determinism based upon a single variable. 425</page><page sequence="2">426 DIPLOMATIC HISTORY Even "single categories of causes" are, on closer inspection, quite pluralist in nature. For example, creating an environment at home and abroad in which capital is secure and free to move reflects far more than the simple economic motive to make money for a given class. In a free enterprise society, the ability to maximize productivity and profitability is the major key to maintaining social harmony between classes, sustaining the state's moral commitment to provide for the sustenance of its citizenry, preserving the state's political authority and legitimacy, providing the means to defend the nation's territory and its inhabitants while enhancing the possibilities of global peace, and creating the stable and prosperous climate in which democracy might be viable and Republican exceptionalism might be believable. Economic power and policy is not merely an end unto itself; it is a major means to a variety of social, political, strategic, and ideological ends. (Similarly, one might argue that a theocratic society's ability to create a secure environment for its religion might well be key to its maintenance of legitimacy, harmony, productivity, and security.) Attaching the reductionist label to corporatism also reduces an extraordinarily complex set of concepts to a strained simplification. At its best, the corporatist synthesis not only acknowledges but also stresses the discontinuities in corporatist arrangements between the state, capital, and labor. Corporatism has waxed and waned in this century precisely because the arrangements were never static or stable, were always subject to renegotiation and reneging, and were profoundly affected by the context of war or peace, prosperity or depression, and the relative strength or weakness of the working class to resist high rates of exploitation.1 Similarly, corporatist synthesizers have not generally "obscured" pluralist "constraints" like isolationism. Most have been careful to define "American neocorporatism" (as distinct from other forms) as a mixed system of representation in which corporatist arrangements and continued pluralist constraints coexist in uneasy tension.2 Most neocorporausi meory, ior example, ireeiy conceues uiai congress paruaiiy represented more varied and particularistic inputs in the Cold War era; that its power to appropriate and to investigate made it a threat to presidential authority; that its fiscal conservatism and suspect internationalism made it a potential rallying point for a reborn isolationism; and that White House manipulation of anticommunism, to muzzle the Left and co-opt the Right, reflected both a fear of pluralist constraints and a conviction that manufactured consensus at home was critical to the success of American internationalism abroad. Gaddis's indictment of liberal-developmentalism and dependency theory is more extended and, in part, more persuasive. Dependency theory reached high tide in the 1960s and early 1970s, stimulated by peasant revolutions in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and reinforced by a pervasive Third World ideology 'See Thomas J. McCormick, "Corporatism: A Reply to Rossi," Radical History Review 33 (September 1985): 53-59. ^Thomas J. McCormick, "Drift or Mastery?

By the late 1970s and 1980s, however, Third World solidarity crumbled as the periphery fragmented into oil- and nonoil-producing states, newly industrializing and nonindustrial countries (NICs and LDCs), and market and command economies. The cumulative frustrations of nation-building and the inability to create Socialist enclaves outside the global market produced an internecine Third World debate that, among other things, questioned dependency theory. At the same time, as Elizabeth Kridl Valkenier has brilliantly demonstrated, Soviet theorists and policymakers—a decade before Mikhail Gorbachev's ascent—also began to question that theory and tentatively argued that "socialism in one country" was not possible, especially in poor Third World countries. In echoes more of Adam Smith than Karl Marx, they began to espouse specialized, comparative advantage production tor a world market and to preach the related necessity of foreign capital, technology, and goods (preferably through East-West joint venture enterprises) to make such production viable.3 In that context, there is considerable merit to Gaddis's critique that dependency theory has to be used in a more discriminating fashion. At its most mechanistic, dependency theory did see Third World options limited to either radical revolution or abject capitulation, while in reality the "pericentric" capacity to resist external exploitation has been considerably more varied and extensive. Similarly, dependencies perspective that the global market inhibits development and perpetuates economic subordination seems belied by the comparatively superior economic performance of Third World market economies over command economies of either the import-substitution or state Socialist varieties. In aggregate, the Newly Industrializing Countries have been the most dynamic and rapidly growing part of the global economy in the 1970s and 1980s, a reflection of a profound redivision of economic labor in which industrial manufacturing has been increasingly transferred from North America, fcurope, ana Japan to tne "semipenphery" (NICJs). Radical scholars of such diverse bents as Nigel Harris and Steve Stern have taken the lead in noting some disjunctures between dependency in theory and economic reality in practice.4 Gaddis, however, may be correct that such self-criticism has not yet permeated diplomatic history. If so, it may be timely for radical scholars of U.S. foreign relations to question some of the concepts forged in the Third World fires of the Vietnam era and, if need be, modify those concepts or advance wholly new ones. On the other hand, one has to be careful not to throw the baby out with the bath. If dependency theory seems an inadequate representation of North South relations since 1970, it does not follow that it must be discarded for the period before 1970.

My recent book, America's Half-Century: United States Foreign Policy in the Cold War, suggests two factors. First, the decline of American hegemony created a more polycentric, competitive environment that made it possible for some NICs to secure somewhat better terms for technology transfers and financing. Second, the recessionary slowdown in the global economy—exacerbated by the collapse of the Bretton Woods system, the American dollar drain, and the OPEC oil shocks—forced core countries to look to the new frontier of the semiperiphery to invest Eurodollars and petrodollars in ways that would raise the rate of profit back to 1950s-1960s levels.6 Even for the 1970s and 1980s, dependency theory remains a persuasive portrayal for part of the Third World. While NICs of the semiperiphery have increased their share of global manufacturing, the Less-Developed-Countries /t r\n.\ _c ' t • l_4 • _ i „ a, »» fl i 1! j ui uiv pviipivij i viuuiii wau^in xii a otupiv u tip ^inviuuiug mu Caribbean basin and its rimlands that Walter LaFeber, Jules Benjamin, and others have analyzed).7 While some sweatshop production may be viable in the needle and garment trades, it seems likely that the bulk of LDC economic activity will remain limited to the primary commodity production of raw materials and specialized fruits and vegetables. Indeed, as global manufacturing spreads to the semiperiphery, the aggregate demand for resource inputs from the periphery will continue to grow. At the same time, however, the scientific-technological revolution (STR) has added so many layers to the fabrication processes that the greater distance between the value added by the final stage and its initial value at the extractive stage makes the "gap between rich and poor" more unbridgeable than ever. Even for the industrializing semiperiphery, dependency theory retains some potential relevance. In the nineteenth century and much of the twentieth, reaching the industrial revolution stage was properly regarded as the barometer of a nation's economic development.

Relatedly, how independent can development be if, for some, the costs of an international "debt trap" includes externally imposed austerity in the form of diminished social welfare, reduced wages, balanced budgets, and the elimination of socially desirable but economically inefficient industries—measures arguably necessary if many of the NICs, especially in Eastern Europe and Latin America, are to be price competitive in a free world market? Part two of Gaddis's essay stresses two factors—"spatial and temporal parochialism" and "systemic innocence." Both are facets of the same problem: the failure of diplomatic historians, revisionists and realists alike, to locate their studies explicitly in an external international system; the tendency instead to use the American nation-state as their base unit of analysis rather than analyze the dynamics of its interaction with a larger, global unit of analysis. ("The influence of the domestic on foreign policy, and the impact of the external on the domestic . . . der Aussenpolitik or der Innerpolitik," as Christopher Thorne recently wrote.)8 Gaddis's critique seems very much on the mark. As a field, there has been little systematic attention paid to the systemic imperatives of an external world that has powerfully driven and shaped American foreign policy. Diplomatic historians use that external context more as a debating tool than as a subject of rigorous analysis. Revisionists tend to denigrate its significance in order to justify their exploration of domestic inputs. Realists purport to value it more, but use it mainly as an amorphous measure to gauge whether or not American leaders, from the Founding Fathers to Woodrow Wilson, understood V» .

As a corrective, Gaddis suggests numerous concepts that might free the field from its parochialism, and proposes book topics that, once written, might heighten our understanding and appreciation of the international context. Each will strike our individual fancies differently. (For my part, I was fascinated with his suggestions of comparative empire studies as well as investigations of "the sources of international systemic stability," while I was unable to share his enthusiasm for the ahistorical genre of game theory.) But the general thrust of all of his suggestions seems to me constructive and praiseworthy: that is, the need to do comparative history, both in spatial and in temporal terms; and the need to inform all of our works, comparative and noncomparative alike, with an explicit awareness "that the United States is and always has been part of an international system, the characteristics of which ^Christopher Thome, Border Crossings: Studies in International History (Oxford, 1988), 37.</page><page sequence="6">430 DIPLOMATIC HISTORY add up to something more than just the sum of its parts." (For example, one might argue that British hegemony in the world-system between 1840 and 1880 largely created the external context of global peace and prosperity that made it possible to enforce the Monroe Doctrine, provide the United States with opportunities for "hitch-hiking imperialism" in Asia, and facilitate the freer trade and capital flows that aided American industrialization. By extension, the decline of British hegemony in the late nineteenth century ushered in an unpredictable milieu of systemic instability and global economic contraction that forced America to function as its own policeman in Latin America and Asia and helped create the crisis of domestic overproduction and falling profits that was such a critical ingredient of American expansionism.) There is one glaring flaw to Gaddis's otherwise splendid effort to challenge "systemic innocence." He fails to make clear, as Ole R. Holsti did recently in this journal, that there are quite different and competing conceptualizations of the international system.9 To be sure, Gaddis does refer to "paradigm fratricide," but his internecine struggle is strictly an incestuous one between fellow "realists" like Paul Kennedy, David Calleo, Robert Gilpin, and Charles Kindleberger.10 Omitted altogether from his textual discussion is the world systems analysis (the "systemic school") popularized by political scientists and sociologists like Immanuel Wallerstein, Terrence Hopkins, and Christopher Chase-Dunn.11 Indeed, Gaddis relegates that interpretive framework to a footnote and offhandedly dismisses it as simply a spatial extension of dependency "theory to international relations as a whole."'z While it does share a great deal of intellectual real estate with dependency theory (and with it, some of its weaknesses), systemic theory differs in several fundamental respects. First, it implicidy agrees with modernization theory that autarkic, state-planned efforts at Third World development have been inherendy ineffective and economically inferior to specialized production for an unlimited global market; that is, Socialist enclaves have not been viable in an otherwise capitalist world. Second, its delineation of the semiperiphery, an intermediate zone between the developed core and the Third World periphery, suggests that the nations that compose it were capable of resisting dependency and effecting their own industrialization. Third, its conceptualization of a complex international division of economic labor—of high-tech core countries, semiperipheral NICs, and an extractive periphery—does allow for upward and 'Ole R.

The systemic and realist schools have quite different notions of the international system. The latter perceives an interstate system whose chief actors are nation-states and whose main imperative is the maximization of geopolitical power. The former perceives a world-system, or capitalist world economy, whose chief actors are transnational business organizations and operations (global market forces) and whose main imperative is the maximization of its profit-making universe. Each approach suffers from serious conceptual flaws and presents difficult methodological dilemmas, about which I have recently written elsewhere in some detail.13 Some are peculiar to one school or the other, while others are shared in common—especially the anthropomorphic tendency to transform their systems into rational actors, endowed with a kind of consciousness and an almost inexorable logic. None of these weaknesses is fatal nor are the two systems mutually exclusive. The fact is both systems do exist. While there is a self-evident iiuvioiai^ ojdivui, uit/ii/ id aidu an ^Aiaui ttuiiuuui' dpiwiu, uuç wiiudt enormous power has been demonstrated so dramatically by the recent sweep of global market forces in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. Moreover, theorists of both systems are essentially interested in the same phenomenon— the cycles of systemic stability and instability, of centering and decentering, of unicentric hegemony and polycentric balance of power, and of "civilization and decay" (to borrow from Brooks Adams).14 Systemic theorists deal with a world-system whose imperatives are inherently internationalist, while realists focus on an interstate system still riddled with the residue of nationalist biases. But it is precisely the tension between those systems, between economic internationalism and political nationalism, that provides such rich material for scholars to analyze. Indeed, it becomes the necessary task of diplomatic historians not only to make sense of the dynamic interactions of the internal and the external but also to disaggregate the latter and articulate how the interstate and world-economy systems intersect to reinforce or constrain each other. Jonn uaddis's prescriptions of comparative and systemic history challenge and provoke us to undertake that additional responsibility. In essence, he asks us not to lose sight of a central fact—that the Republic, as I recently noted, "was born in an unstable, war-ridden international system, poised on the brink of global war and of Britain's ascent to global hegemony, and at a time when a stagnating world economy was primed to expand so explosively that the United States' share of its export and reexport profits would bring within its grasp economic independence as well as political autonomy."15 Implicitly as well, he reminds us that American hegemony was born, more than a century 13See Thomas J. McCormick, "World Systems," Journal of American History (forthcoming). ^Brooks Adams, The Law of Civilization and Decay: An Essay on History (New York, 1895). 15McCormick, "World Systems."</page><page sequence="8">432 DIPLOMATIC HISTORY and a half later, on the historical divide of another unstable, war-ridden system, poised on the brink of another world war and America's ascent to global suzerainty; and on the historical divide of a Great Depression world-economy, primed to expand so explosively that both American capitalism and free world capitalism would enjoy one quarter century of economic growth unrivaled in the half millennium of capitalism's dynamic history. Indeed, for the whole of America's road from colony to colossus, the second and more fruitful part of Gaddis's essay enjoins us to locate our studies within a systemic framework, and to do so explicitly and systematically. The challenge is a daunting one, but the rewards for the field—for revisionists and realists alike—seem certain to be energizing and liberating. And the only apparent price will be the loss of "parochialism" and "systemic innocence."</page></plain_text>
