JACKSON University of Texas, El Paso The Orient in Post-Bellum American Thought: Three Pioneer Popularizers SINCE THE PATHBREAKING BOOKS BY FREDERIC IVES CARPENTER AND ARTHUR Christy in the early 1930s, scholars have generally recognized that Oriental thought generated considerable interest among American intellectuals in the mid-19th century, particularly among New Englanders connected with Transcendentalism.1 Emerson and Thoreau have received most attention,2 as much a testimony to their established positions as major figures in American letters as to the seriousness of their Eastern interests. This scholarly labor has certainly not been misspent, but it has tended to ob- scure the continued fascination of Oriental ideas in the latter half of the century for a younger group who, drawing inspiration from the founders of Transcendentalism, did pioneer work in popularizing Oriental thought in post-bellum America.3 I refer to such men as James Freeman Clarke, 'Frederic Carpenter, Emerson and Asia (Cambridge, Mass., 1930); Arthur Christy, The Orient in American Transcendentalism: A Study of Emerson, Thoreau, and Alcott (New York, 1932). 2Among others these include: Kurt F.

In varying de- grees all were indebted to the liberating influence of Transcendentalism; none, however, escaped the postwar impact of evolutionism, idealism and free thought. Indeed, one might term them "post-Transcendentalists" in the sense that while still subscribing to many of Transcendentalism's tenets, they were seeking to accommodate idealism to the new challenges pre- sented by science.4 Limitations of space will restrict the present examina- tion to only the first three Clarke, Johnson and Conway-the most im- portant so far as Oriental ideas were concerned. It seems significant that the three should have published pioneering presentations of Oriental thought in close succession: Clarke offering his Ten Great Religions in 1871, Johnson the first volume of his Oriental Religions in 1872 and Con- way the Sacred Anthology in 1874. The early 1870s, it would seem, marked an important moment in the dawning American awareness of the world of Asian thought. An interest in Oriental thought was only one item in James Freeman Clarke's very busy life (1810-88), yet it was an important one. A leading Unitarian minister, a prolific author and the outspoken champion of such reforms as temperance, women's suffrage and the rights of the Negro, he also contributed one of the seminal popular works on Oriental thought in his generation.5 Clarke's first awareness of the East may be traced back to his youth. Writing in the 1860s he recalled his excitement 40 years before at stumbling upon Kalidasa's great Indian drama Shakuntala while rum- maging one summer afternoon through the Monthly Anthology a leading literary magazine published in Boston at the beginning of the century.6 His subsequent acquaintance with German intellectual currents undoubt- edly widened his knowledge of the Orient, as the East was receiving grow- ing attention from German scholars and poets in the first decades of the century. And of course his intimate acquaintance with Emerson and other examination of the interest in Oriental ideas in the 1860s and 1870s revealed by such period- icals as The Radical and The Index. 4Terminology presents a difficult problem. Though too loosely associated to categorize as a movement, the post-Transcendentalists were clearly related: through interlocking friend- ships, a common New England background and a shared intellectual viewpoint. Their con- tacts with Transcendentalism helped draw them to Oriental thought and permeated their attitude toward the East. 5Neither Arthur S. Bolster Jr.'s James Freeman Clarke: Disciple to Advancing Truth (Boston, 1954) nor John W. Thomas' James Freeman Clarke. Apostle of German Culture to America (Boston, 1949) deals with Clarke's concern with Oriental thought in more than a cursory way. A near contemporary of Emerson's and close friend of most members of the Concord circle, Clarke's serious interest in Asian thought ripened slowly. 'Atlantic Monthly, XXIII (May 1869), 548-49. It is interesting that Emerson's father was one of the editors of the Anthologyv. The Shakuntala seems to have been the earliest Oriental work published in America.</page><page sequence="3">The Orient in American Thought 69 leaders of the Transcendental movement must have stimulated his interest. Briefly, between 1836 and 1839, he edited the Western Messenger, a Tran- scendental periodical, which included in its pages several selections from the Oriental classics;7 this was several years before Emerson's and Thoreau's publication of the "Ethnical Scriptures" in The Dial, usually heralded as the pioneer presentation of the ancient Oriental literatures to American readers.8 However, the references to Asia in the Messenger are meagre and the general attitude critical; there is no indication that the East had yet won Clarke's serious attention. Clarke's close examination of the Eastern religions apparently began sometime in the 1840s; he states in the Ten Great Religions (1871) that he had first made the study of the principal world religions his "specialty" more than 25 years before.9 His ideas had largely crystallized by the 1850s, as is indicated by his article "Comparative Theology of Heathen Reli- gions," published in the Christian Examiner in 1857, which offers a capsule version of the views he would expound in fuller and more authoritative form in the Ten Great Religions."0 The article represents one of the earliest statements of the comparative religious approach which was to be- come so popular in the last part of the century. A decade elapsed. In 1867 he received an appointment as lecturer on non-Christian religions at the Harvard Divinity School; soon after he published his first extended essays on the Oriental religions." The Ten Great Religions appeared in 1871, opening with three chapters on the Oriental religions. Clearly written and comprehensive, it was im- mediately acclaimed and subsequently went through nineteen editions. A major element of interest in the volume is Clarke's apparent effort to ap- proach his subject after the manner of the scientist. He announced that he intended to pursue his analysis impartially and in the spirit of a "positive science"; he spoke of attaining a "natural history" of the world's religions. Noting the growing vogue of the comparative method, he called for a "com- parative theology" parallel to such existing disciplines as comparative anatomy, comparative geography and comparative philology.'2 In keep- ing with his choice of viewpoint, he called for a new non-normative clas- IWestern Messenger, III (July 1837), 806, 814, 826: VI (Apr. 1839), 389-90.

He dismissed the older moralistic terminology of Christian apologists and in its place proposed to classify the world religions as one might classify plants: either as "ethnic" religions, i.e. non-missionary religions restricted to a particular race and a distinct territory; or as "catholic* religions, ac- tive missionary religions that transcended racial and geographical limits. At the same time, the study was deeply permeated by the author's strong commitments to the superiority of Christianity. Clarke's analysis of the Oriental systems is temperate and appreciative, though not uncritical, as one would expect in a work with scientific preten- sions. In each case he balances the positive and negative features. If quick to point out the limitations of the Oriental religions, he often cites ex- amples where the West could learn from the East. Brahmanism,"3 he declared, was quintessentially the religion of spirit: above all other reli- gions it had sought the spiritual as opposed to the material, eternity as op- posed to time, the infinite as opposed to the finite, substance as opposed to form. Its virtue was its profound spirituality, its failure a lack of commit- ment to life in this world and its denial of moral responsibility. If one of the most profound of all religions, it was too negative. There is a strange mixture of admiration and distaste in his analysis. "The Hindoos," he commented, "have sacred books of great antiquity, and a rich literature extending back twenty or thirty centuries; yet no history, no chronology, no annals. They have a philosophy as acute, profound and, spiritual as any in the world, which is yet harmoniously associated with the coarsest su- perstitions. With a belief so abstract that it almost escapes the grasp of the most speculative intellect, is joined the notion that sin can be atoned for by bathing in the Ganges or repeating a text of the Veda.""4 His analysis of Indian thought is noteworthy for its recognition of differences between separate schools of Hindu philosophy; thus, he distinguishes be- tween the Vedanta, Sankhya and Nyaya schools. Most earlier treatments had proceeded as if Hinduism and the Vedanta were interchangeable terms. The familiarity he demonstrates both with the classic Oriental sources and with the major European commentaries is another virtue of the work. The major weakness is a proneness to facile over-generalization: throughout the book he differentiates the Oriental religions too sharply, neatly lining them up for comparison and contrast. It is much too tidy. Buddhism, Clarke believed, was in most respects the polar opposite of Hinduism: it emphasized the finite rather than the infinite, man rather than God, morality rather than religion. Where Hinduism was spiritual 13The term "Brahmanism" is usually reserved for early Hinduism; much of Clarke's dis- cussion focuses on later developments for which the term "Hinduism" is preferred. 14Clarke, Ten Great Religions, p. 82.</page><page sequence="5">The Orient in American Thought 71 and pantheistic, Buddhism was rational and humanistic. He was intrigued with the parallel between the revolt of Buddhism against Hinduism and Protestantism's revolt against Roman Catholicism: Buddhism he suggested might be best understood as the "Protestantism of the East." In an ex- tended analysis he argued the similarities in their common rejection of sac- ramentalism, hierarchical organization and excessive ritualism and in their common emphasis on the individual's responsibility for salvation. "The human mind in Asia went through the same course of experience, after- ward repeated in Europe," he concluded.'5 Like most early Western stu- dents of Buddhism, he failed to distinguish between the Theravada Bud- dhism of South Asia and the Mahayana Buddhism of China and Japan. Certain features in Buddhism obviously attracted Clarke, as he indicated by favorable comments on its tolerance, its rationalism and its concern for humanity. He observed that it was the one Oriental religion that had shown some success in missionary expansion and that might therefore be contemplated for inclusion among the select "catholic" religions. (He obviously was unaware of Hinduism's early expansionary successes throughout southeast Asia.) However, Buddhism too was found wanting; reacting against Hinduism's excesses, it had drifted into excesses of its own. "In asserting the rights of nature against the tyranny of spirit, Bud- dhism has lost God," he observed. "There is in Buddhism neither creation nor Creator."'6 The religion of Buddha had been largely a mystery to Emerson and Thoreau; Clarke's chapter indicated the great advances made in American knowledge since the 1840s. Clarke's chapter on Confucianism provided fullness to his treatment of Asian thought, but he experienced certain difficulties in fitting it into his framework as one of the "great religions." Most of his analysis is devoted to the peculiarities of Chinese civilization, the nature of Chinese govern- ment and the patterns of Chinese life. Unintentionally revealing much about the romantic tendency of his conception of the Orient, he observed that in Confucianism one missed the flights of fancy and the imagination usually associated with the East: the Chinese thought in prose rather than poetry; there was, he suggested, a "Quaker style" in the writings of the Confucian philosophers.17 He was impressed by the permanency, high cultural achievements and ingenious methods of government of Chinese civilization. Describing Chinese civil service examinations, he exclaimed: "What an immense advantage it would be to our own country if we should adopt this institution of China!""8 He referred to Confucius as "one of 5Clarke, Ten Great Religions, p. 142.

Taoism is given several pages, but the discussion is unsatisfactory and fragmentary; Lao-tzu's teachings were to remain largely unknown in America until after World War II. The wide circulation and frequent reference to the Ten Great Religions in the latter half of the century sug- gest that a whole generation of Americans perceived the Orient through Clarke's categories.20 A comparison of Clarke's treatment of the East with that of Emerson and Thoreau suggests important differences. Emerson and Thoreau had looked to the East in a more subjective, romantic spirit, extoling the wis- dom they had discovered there; neither apparently had sought or desired a systematic and factual knowledge of the Oriental systems. Their interest was as much in the feeling of Oriental thought as in its message. Clarke, on the other hand, favored an objective assessment, one in which the doctrines were systematically weighed and evaluated. One must know the East before asserting its value. Where Emerson and Thoreau had been mainly concerned with using Oriental thought, Clarke was primarily concerned with understanding and presenting the ideas to a general reader. Clarke did not, however, succeed in offering the unbiased study he had declared as his objective. It is revealing in this regard that he argued that only Christianity qualified as a fully "catholic" religion, while all others failed in some point. Ultimately, he was as much the prisoner of his background and preconceptions as the Christian apologists he often assailed. In 1872, just a year after the appearance of the Ten Great Religions, Samuel Johnson21 published the first volume of his Oriental Religions and their Relation to Universal Religion. Clarke had managed to convey his analysis of the Orient in three chapters; Johnson ultimately required three mammoth volumes. The work stands out as one of the most ambi- tious attempts to comprehend and explain the meaning of Oriental civiliza- tion ever undertaken by an American. If ultimately a failure, the effort is ca's political corruption. See, for example, the comments of W. A. P. Martin, an American missionary, The Chinese: Their Education, Philosophe, and Letters (New York, 1881), pp. 39-40 and if. "9Clarke, Ten Great Religions, pp. 44 &amp; 45. 20It may be noted that he subsequently added a second volume, Ten Great Religions, Part II. A Comparison of All Religions (Boston, 1883) in which he incorporated primitive reli- gions while reorganizing his analysis according to concept rather than individual religion. 2'Not to be confused with the earlier American Samuel Johnson (1969-1772), the philos- opher at King's (Columbia) College.</page><page sequence="7">The Orient in American Thought 73 still impressive many years later. Like Clarke, Johnson (1822-82) was educated at Harvard and subsequently became a Unitarian minister; un- like Clarke, he soon cut his official ties with Unitarianism, breaking away to found a non-sectarian Free Church in Lynn, Massachusetts. He became a leading spokesman for a nonconforming Transcendental Unitarianism and, during the 1860s, a regular contributor to The Radical, a major organ of left-wing Unitarians.22 Johnson's birth and early years in Salem suggest the probable source of his first awareness of the Orient. Though by the 1820s and 1830s the East Indies trade had already peaked and declined, there were still many re- minders of the earlier era left, including the quaint collections at the East India Museum gathered over several decades by sea captains during calls at Bombay, Calcutta and Canton. The mystery surrounding such artifacts would surely have piqued the curiosity of a young boy.23 In college John- son read Victor Cousin (whose Cours de philosophie, published in 1828, included a concise summary of Indian thought) and was soon avowing his commitment to a Transcendental philosophy. In 1854 he was seeking to present Oriental thought to his Free Church congregation, commenting to his friend Samuel Longfellow that "I have been putting the Oriental Lectures into a more sermonic form, to awake, if possible, some desire for a broader culture in the people." Reading the well-known biologist Louis Agassiz in 1858, he observed that "It will take more than Agassiz to prove that our classifications are God's actual thinking, rather than one man's conception of the universe. This anthropomorphism, I confess, shocks me. I like my old Brahmins better who only said, God is."24 That he was already deeply immersed in the study of the Eastern religions by the 1850s is evident from the introduction to his 1872 volume on India where he comments that the work was "the outgrowth of studies pursued with constant interest for more than twenty years"; these studies, he de- clared, had "served substantially to confirm the views" he had first pre- sented two decades before in a series of lectures on the "Universality of Religious Ideas, as illustrated by the Ancient Faiths of the East."25 From the 1860s until his death in 1882, he labored continuously at his writing table, offering the volume on India in 1872 and a volume on China in 1877. The final volume on Persia,26 nearly finished at the time of his death, was 22See Samuel Longfellow's "Memoir" in Johnson, Lectures, Essays, and Sermons (Bos- ton, 1883), pp. 1-142; Johnson deserves a biographical study. 23Johnson, Lectures, Essai's, and Sermons, p. 2. 24Johnson, Lectures, Essavs, and Sermons, pp. 47 &amp; 52.

Johnson's analysis in the Oriental Religions was dominated by a combi- nation of Transcendental idealism and evolutionism.27 Like Clarke, he sought to assimilate the new science of the 19th century. "I have written," he explained in a key statement of the first volume, "not as an advocate of Christianity or of any other distinctive religion, but as attracted on the one hand by the identity of the religious sentiment under all its great historic forms, and on the other by the movement indicated in their diversities and contrasts towards a higher plane of unity, on which their exclusive claims shall disappear."28 Asserting the existence of an "Infinite Mind" which permeated all phenomena, he held that all religions must necessarily mani- fest the Infinite to some degree and that to that degree all religions were identical. No religion could claim an exclusive hold on truth, as all em- bodied it. "Thus," he wrote, "the cardinal virtues and beliefs belong not to one religion, but to all religions; and the diversities of form into which each of these ideals is broken by differences of race and culture do not affect its essential identity in them all."29 He was an evolutionist to the extent that he envisioned the history of religion as a process of growth from primitive myth toward higher religion: each religion, he held, re- vealed "a progressive education of man, through his own essential rela- tions with the Infinite, commencing at the lowest stage, and at each step pointing onward to fresh ascension. . . ." Drawing out the implications of the evolutionary position, he concluded that if there were "differences of higher and lower in the forms of revelation," there was "no such thing as a revealed religion in distinction from natural religion."30 At the same time, he rejected any suggestion of a mechanistic Darwinism: spirit was the active force, matter the passive field of action. The climax of evolu- tion's operation would be the emergence of a "Universal Religion" which incorporated and yet transcended all previous religions. It would not, he asserted, be "any one, exclusively, of the great positive religions of the world," but "what is best in each and every one of them; purified from baser inter-mixture and developed in freedom and power. "31 The differences between Clarke's and Johnson's attitudes toward Orien- tal thought are significant. Clarke conceded much of value in the Oriental 27In addition to the introductory chapter of the India volume, see his essay "Transcenden- talism" in Lectures, Essays, and Sermons, pp. 416-60 and Octavius Brooks Frothingham's "Introduction" to Johnson, Oriental Religions and their Relation to Universal Religion.

He agreed with Johnson that the world's religions were evolving toward a universal religion, only he concluded that the universal religion was to be a reformed Christianity, which would embrace all of the good elements of the other religions. Chris- tianity alone was placed outside the process that governed the develop- ment of other religions. Johnson maintained that Christianity was no exception: subject to the same laws as the other religions, its fate would be the same. "The Christian ideal is but a single force among others, all equally in the line of movement," he observed.32 Further, Johnson was much more insistent than Clarke on the positive contributions to be made by the Oriental religions and on their relative equality with Christianity. "The time has arrived," he announced, for a "mutual interchange of experience between the East and the West, for which neither was prepared, but which is quite indispensable to the advancement of both forms of civilization."33 His own studies, he affirmed, had convinced him that "these oldest religions have an exceedingly important function to fulfil in the present transformation of the latest into a purer Theism.""' Ex Oriente Lux!' Light from the East once more!" he exulted.34 The controlling assumption of Johnson's work was that each of the cen- ters of Asian civilization had produced a distinctive "mind." He readily admitted that all peoples included a mixture of tendencies, but he held that each as the result of variations in race and environment-showed a dominant tendency. "The Hindu mind," he explained, "is subtle, introver- sive, contemplative. It spins its ideals out of its brain substance, and may properly be called cerebral." The Chinese mind, by contrast, "busy with plodding, uninspired labor, dealing with pure ideas to but little result, yet wonderfully efficient in the world of concrete facts and uses," might be defined as "muscular."35 (He held that the Persian approach mediated between thought and work and between theory and practice; he defined it as of a "nervous" type.) He demonstrated considerable ingenuity in draw- ing support for his characterizations from the accumulated literatures of the respective countries so that his discussion was more persuasive than a brief summary would suggest. The objections to such a scheme of classifi- cation-its doubtful assumption of a unified mind-set shared by millions of people, the questionable use of physiological analogies, and a tendency to force the evidence did not entirely nullify his effort. His practical dif- ficulties in applying the types can be seen in the tortured reasoning he was 32Johnson, Oriental Religions. India, p. 4. 33Johnson, Oriental Religions.

He almost entirely ignored the Japanese religious mind, whose combination of bor- rowed Chinese and indigenous elements would have been extremely diffi- cult to explain. The study prefigures F.S.C. Northrop's much discussed Meeting of East and West, a 20th century attempt to embrace and define the whole range of Oriental thought subject, it must be said, to many of the same limitations.36 In an undertaking of such magnitude it was not surprising that Johnson relied heavily on the scholarship of others. If an almost universal limita- tion of his time, such dependence was more damaging in Johnson's case because his volumes suggested serious claims to scholarship. He had studied Sanskrit but he was largely unacquainted with the other Oriental lan- guages; his knowledge was based almost entirely on English, French and German translations and commentaries upon the Oriental sources. Readily admitting that his labor was at second-hand, Johnson argued that in large undertakings such reliance was unavoidable. "I mean," he quipped, "to be prepared for the evil fame of attempting so much without knowledge of the forty thousand characters of the Chinese script. If I knew these, I should know nothing else."37 He might have reminded his critics that Oriental scholarship during the 19th century often seemed to suffer from an overly meticulous concern with the mechanics of translation, with a resulting tendency to miss the meaning and larger implications of the ma- terial being translated. Compensating somewhat for his inadequacy in languages, Johnson did demonstrate a broad acquaintance with contem- porary European scholarship. An investigation of his footnotes suggests that he had read most of the accepted authorities of his day. He cited the works of Wilson, MUller, Roth, Rdmusat, Lassen, Rosen, the Schlegels, Julien, Burnouf, Colebrooke, Legge, Wilkins, Saint-Hilaire, Pauthier, Beale and Hardy. That he had not only consulted but had studied and carefully compared these scholars is testified by his critical evaluations of their books.38 His commentary upon the Vedas, Bhagavad-Gita and the Four Books, as well as his detailed discussion of the institutions and social life of India and China, reveal a general familiarity with his subject. For various reasons the Oriental Religions never enjoyed the success of Clarke's Ten Great Religions.

Thus in 1875, upon the completion of a chapter in his projected second volume on China, he wrote: "There is no encouragement for print- ing another volume in the sale of the first." And in 1877: "I sent the last proofs [of the China] in from Boston yesterday, and came home with a sense of lifted cares, till I began to think of the probable fate of the heavy craft I was launching before the hasty practical American world that will only tolerate what it can measure, and absorb, with a 'touch and go'939 The China volume did no better than the one on India: within a year he felt compelled to sell the copies supplied by his publisher to pay off some of the expenses incurred in printing it. The successive volumes did receive occasional favorable notices in the periodicals of the day, and in the next two decades they were referred to by other writers on Oriental religions.40 The popular failure of the Oriental Religions undoubtedly stemmed from such considerations as their great size, their esoteric subject matter and a style that was often loose and ponderous. Perhaps the major problem was the failure to find a suitable audience. If too scholarly for the general reader, the volumes were not sufficiently so for professionals in the field. Scholars, who might have been expected to overlook lapses in style, com- plained of Johnson's lack of language skills, his frequent reliance on un- trustworthy sources and a straining of evidence to support his own ideas.4' Though he had used the apparatus of scholarship, he was at best a gifted amateur. His work, which possessed many virtues, had unfortunately ap- peared at the wrong time, at a moment when new and more rigorous stan- dards were being placed upon such productions by the new generation of Oriental scholars. Alone among the post-Transcendentalists Moncure Conway (1832-1907) was to test the image of Eastern thought against its reality. Though he traversed the well-traveled path from the Harvard Divinity School into the Unitarian ministry, his journey was to be a roundabout one. Raised in the South, he had served briefly as a lay Methodist minister; in later life he resettled in London to head the South Place Chapel.

In 1853 as a rather bumptious young man, he had traveled out to Concord one summer day to interview Emerson, whose writings had excited his admiration. His account of his first meeting with Thoreau is often quoted. Taken by Emerson to meet the sage of Walden Pond, he re- called that Thoreau had "received me pleasantly, and asked what we were studying at Cambridge. I answered, 'The Scriptures.' 'Which?' he asked." Emerson explained, "You will find our Thoreau a sad pagan."43 The youth visited Concord on several other occasions during the summer, borrowing Oriental books from Emerson and discoursing with his new-found ac- quaintances about his reading. He mentions in his Autobiography that it was in Emerson's home that he first read Wilkins' translation of the Bhaga- vad-Gita, which "thenceforth became part of my canon."44 After leaving Emerson's circle, he continued to read and extract the Oriental writings, often employing favorite passages as devotional readings in his church services. During a brief ministry at Cincinnati before departing for Lon- don, he edited The Dial, which, like its famous Boston namesake, featured selections from the Oriental classics.45 Relocated at the South Place Chapel after 1864, he continued his Oriental lectures and established a broadening network of friendships with European Orientalists-including the great Max MUller, who sometimes stayed in his home. Conway's best-known tribute to the Orient was his Sacred Anthology, published in America in 1874 (the original English edition appeared in 1873). There had been talk of the need for such a volume, a kind of world bible to include the best in Eastern and Western thought, for a generation. As early as 1839 Convers Francis had written Theodore Parker: "We might have (Might we not?) what I should call a World Bible, which if we had now our choice to make would be better than the Jewish and Christian Bible,-I mean a combination of the essentially true and wise, which lies scattered among the sages of all times and nations. . . . Wouldn't it be a noble, a truly God-sent Bible?"46 Several ventures had been undertaken to provide such a bible, including Emerson's and Thoreau's "Ethnical 42The standard biography is by Mary E.

"It is a volume of near five hundred pages, large octavo, and contains seven hundred and forty selections from the Scriptures and classic authors of the East. It has been liberally subscribed for, and is already paid for. A very handsome vol- ume!"48 The work is arranged topically under such headings as "Wis- dom," "Charity," "Man," "God" and "Nature," with accompanying selections from ancient and modern, Eastern as well as Western authors. The message of the volume is unmistakable. Though admitting that the ancient literatures were pre-scientific in spirit, Conway observed that "it is not without reason that a higher value is generally set on them than upon the literatures of more enlightened times. The fact that they have survived so long is a confirmation of their excellence."49 Expressing confidence that a wider appreciation of the "converging testimonies of ages and races to great principles" would improve one's moral viewpoint, he called for the establishment of a "Science of Religion," which, through the compar- ison of the world's religions, would pave the way for a "Religion of Hu- manity."50 Conway denied any claim to critical scholarship, though he declared that he had employed several Hindus and Persians to aid with the research and that he had utilized "great masses of unpublished trans- lations" in compiling the book. The Anthology went through a number of editions and was used for pulpit lessons in numerous English and Ameri- can Unitarian churches. According to Conway, Max Muller once told him that the Anthology had helped persuade him to undertake the publication of the Sacred Books of the East-the first comprehensive and authorita- tive multi-volume English translation of the Oriental classics.51 Conway's departure for the Orient in 1883 on a world journey that would include major stops in Ceylon and India provided an unusual opportunity to evaluate the true worth of Eastern wisdom. For all their discussions of the East, neither Emerson and Thoreau nor Clarke and Johnson had en- joyed the opportunity of observing the Orient at first-hand. "It was a new world I was entering," Conway remarked upon his arrival in Ceylon in December 1883. "I had studied the Sinhalese Buddha and Buddhists, and knew I was leaving behind Anglo-Saxonism cruel, ambitious, canting, 47The most ambitious scheme was Bronson Alcott's projected "Mankind Library," which was planned to run to many volumes. Like so many of his plans, however, the project was never carried out. Cf. Christy, Orient in American Transcendentalism, pp. 240-41. 48Index, V (Jan. 8, 1874), 19. 49The Sacred Anthologj'.

"52 In a whirlwind of activity, he visited religious leaders on the island, lectured before curious native audiences, and sought out the island's famous temples and shrines. He was much impressed by the extreme un- worldliness and wide learning of the Buddhist leaders he encountered: "To find philosophers living in thatched cottages with earthen floors was," he exclaimed, "an astonishment."53 He recalled sitting with one such lowly philosopher to discuss Emerson, Carlyle and Max MUller: the man had known their works by heart. Continuing on to India in early 1884 he visited Madras, Calcutta, Delhi and Allahabad, detouring to Adyar to meet Madame Blavatsky, the Western seeress of the Theosophical Society, another pilgrim to the "wise men of the East." Conway was charmed by the Madame's performance in her interview with him, but dismissed her Mahatmas and supposed accomplishments as an occultist as fraudulent. "I felt that madame was a genius in her own way, and a moral phenomenon to be studied," he commented, "but she made no pretenses with me."54 He made a special trip to Buddh-Gaya, where the young prince Sid- dhartha had experienced his illumination as the Buddha. Analyzing his sensations at that holy spot, he reflected that where the Buddha had always seemed an obscure figure before, at Buddh-Gaya "the thought of that young prince burdened with the sorrows and delusions of mankind reached far down in me and touched some subconscious source of tears and love for the man, and I longed to clasp his knees."55 If the frequently repeated testimonials in Conway's book prove that his admiration for the Orient remained strong after the conclusion of his pilgrimage, nevertheless they cannot conceal a significant shift in his per- spective upon the East. The title and opening pages of his book suggest that he had set out in some expectation of finding an idealized Orient: the East of pure spirituality and mystical profundity embellished by Western romantics for over a century. His comments reveal that he found what he had come to seek, but also that he discovered quite another Orient. For example: a gathering of Hindu ascetics in Calcutta stirred him to recall "how in early life I used to find a certain romance in reading about yogis," a memory deeply indebted to Kalidasa's portrayal in his Shakuntala. After peering at the group, he admitted that "the yogi is much more attractive in the verse of Kalidasa than when seen near to."56 What he discovered- and the experience has been repeated over and over in the West's en- 52Conway, My Pilgrimage to the Wise Men of the East (Boston, 1906), 108-9.

"One feels at every step the vast distance of the popular worship from the wit and wisdom of the ancient books," he declared late in his volume, summing up in a few words what it had cost him months of travel to learn.57 The lesson he drew from his experiences was not disillu- sionment, but the need for more knowledge. He complained frequently in the course of his account that Western enthusiasts had steadily dis- torted Oriental thought. He came back from his pilgrimage still convinced of the truth of much that the Orient had to offer, though he now empha- sized its limitations in practice. In the final pages of his book he reasserted his belief that the West could greatly profit by a better knowledge of the Eastern religions. Well before Conway's final settlement of accounts with the Orient, new currents were stirring that in time would significantly alter America's re- lations with the East. A growing missionary effort in Asia, the technologi- cal revolution in transportation, new pressures upon American foreign policy, and the accelerating breakdown of the traditional Asian societies were factors that would revolutionize the 20th century scene. The emer- gence of professionally trained Oriental scholars in American universities at the end of the century held out the promise of a more mature under- standing of the East in future years. Yet the post-Transcendentalist con- tribution to awakening 19th century American interest in Oriental thought deserves to be remembered. Besides authoring pioneer treatments of the Oriental religions, individuals in the group played active roles in a num- ber of postwar movements with interests in Oriental thought: in the Free Religious Association, which during the 1870s and 1880s sponsored sym- posiums devoted to the major Oriental religions and published frequent articles on Oriental thought in The Index and The Radical; in the compar- ative religions movement, which arose at the end of the century to empha- size the study of Oriental religions in colleges and seminaries; and in the promotion of Sir Edwin Arnold's Light of Asia, published in 1879, which did so much to encourage a Buddhist vogue in the 1880s. By such works, the post-Transcendentalists seem to have perceived a wave of the future- anticipating the enthusiasm for Asian thought which has been so evident among American students, writers and intellectuals in recent decades. 57Ibid., p. 312. Conway's "profound discouragement" and disillusionment was reported by the Christian Register, LXIII (May 15, 1884), 312 and passed about in the American reli- gious press, apparently to the satisfaction of those stirred up by his attacks against the Chris- tian missionary movement. Conway declared himself "mortified" at the report and insisted that he preferred the abuses in the Oriental religions to many of those in Christianity. Cf.
