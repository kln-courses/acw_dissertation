<plain_text><page sequence="1">Siva and Shakti in Raja Rao's Novels By UMA PARAMESWARAN Raja Rao is one of those enigmatic writ- ers whose novels have been received with wholehearted commenda- tion by such critics as C. D. Narasimhaiah and Edwin Thumboo and with as intense or bemused a condem- nation by many critics in India and by the reviewers of Time and the New York Times abroad. Rao is a powerful writer. He is profoundly metaphysical in the way he thinks and feels, and he has a scholarly background, an intimate familiarity with primary texts of Hindu, Buddhist, and Christian philosophies; his mastery of English vocabulary is indisputable (as is his mastery of French), and his prose is often scintillating poetry. His major problem, or perhaps the reader's, is his superabundance of words, a ver- bosity that led one reviewer to parody Rao's epigraph in The Serpent and the Rope with "Sentences are nothing but words. So are novels." All of Rao's novels explore philosophical concepts. Kanthapura (1938)1 deals with the power of ahimsa (nonviolence) and satyagraha that build up moral invincibility in individuals and nations. The Serpent and the Rope (1960) deals with linear Time and concurrent Time (isness or Eternity) through the personae of two historians: Madeleine, the successful professor of history, symbolizing the blind streets of linear Time; and Rama, the not-too-successful stu- dent of Cathars and Albigensian heresy, showing the direction in which lies the open sea of isness. In The Cat and Shakespeare (1965) Ramakrishna Pai instinc- tively realizes what Rama has sought through intel- lectual peregrinations, that mar jar a nyaya (where the man-God relationship may be seen as that of a kitten- cat bond in which the kitten is carried to safety by its mother without any effort of its own) is superior to markata-nyaya (the monkey mother-baby relation- ship in which the baby monkey must hold on to its mother while being carried). Comrade Kirillov (1976) is a novel fragment that explores the potentials and prospects of communism through a somewhat ambiv- alent symbolism implied in the death of Kirillov's wife Irene in childbirth and in the ritualistic baptism of their older son by the narrator R at Kanya Kumari, where Parvati, symbolic of India, waits, eternally unwed, for Siva, who is lost in meditation. The most recent novel, The Chessmaster and His Moves (1988), is the story of Sivarama, a mathematician in France, and his search to solve the puzzle of life, meta- phorically alluded to as a chess game in which the Master's "moves are . . . subtle. . . . His hand is on your shoulder, not to tell you where to move, but to show the nature of essensic movement" (506). All of Rao's protagonists are essentially the same person; all quest for the Absolute through gnana, the path of intellectual perception; all are Brahmins versed in Upanishadic literature; all have some physi- cal ailment, showing the insignificance of the body; and all except Moorthy (of Kanthapura) have, at the core of their search, relationships with women. Com- mon to all his protagonists (again with the exception of Moorthy) is a worshipful sensuality which, taken with the symbolic physical malaise afflicting each, indicates that their relationships transcend the sexual component, whether or not there is a physical level to the relationship. Although Shantha's relationship with Pai is naturally and unostentatiously sexual, the relationship between Savithri and Rama and between Jaya and Sivarama is not physical, though it would certainly be inappropriate to call it Platonic. It is very definitely sexual; as in Keats's poems, it is an eter- nalizing of the rapturous moment before the mo- ment, when the woman is bride yet still unravished, perpetually poised on the peak of anticipation before the moment of fulfillment, which is also that of disappointment, for what lies ahead is all downhill: "Bold lover, never never canst thou kiss . . . ." Thus the frequent allusion to Kanya Kumari, the eternally unwed bride. It is as though Raja Rao is convinced that the heterosexual relationship is essential to the Truth- Seeker and so has explored various ways of defining and delineating how the masculine and feminine principles work in man's search for the oneness and isness of Shivoham.2 Unfortunately, man's search, as portrayed by Rao, could be taken to mean just that: gender-oriented and male rather than generically human. Read one way, Rao's generalizations on men and women could be quite annoying to some readers for one or more of the following reasons. 1) The we/ they duality detracts from the universal and human aspects of characters. Men and women seem different in everything; even the shared sorrows and ecstasies of each gender are made to sound antipodal. 2) All of Rao's protagonists, particularly Rama and Sivarama, could come across to some readers as both self- righteous prigs and impotent wimps in their actions and attitudes. 3) Rao presents three types of women: the idealized Hindu woman who is the incarnation of Shakti, the feminine principle behind the manifested world; the fallen Hindu woman, like Lakshmi in The Serpent and the Rope; and the non-Hindu woman who is intelligent and sensual yet flawed in some essential way. What is disturbing about this is not only the categorization of women according to tradi- tional conventions of morality but the implicit distinc- tion between Hindu and non-Hindu women.3 Thus, not only does Rao resort to the standard Indian- movie convention of postponing the consummation of</page><page sequence="2">PARAMESWARAN 575 marriage so as to keep the woman chaste though married to the wrong man, but he also implies that Madeleine, Irene, Suzanne, and Mireille are worthy of love because of their Indianness, though incapable of providing fulfillment because they are not Indian after all. 4) The genders are not only different but seemingly unequal. There are numerous panegyrics on Woman, women, and womanhood; Rama's con- templation of the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II (SR, 352-54) is the longest and loudest, but state- ments such as the following appear frequently: Without woman the world is not. All women are perfect women, for they have the feminine principle in them, the yin, the prakriti. (SR, 309) To worship woman is to redeem the world. (SR, 172) To deny woman is to deny life and self-realization. To wed a woman you must wed her God. (SR, 82) The woman therefore is the priestess of God. (SR, 55) All women have the womb of poetry. (SR, 216) Without woman, as you know, there is no kingdom, no world. (CM, 82) However, there are as many statements that could be read as perpetuating the Miltonic statement, "He for God only, she for God in him." For example: Man must lead woman to the altar of God. For women possession is knowledge ... to love is to submit. Bondage is her destiny. (SR, 185) For a woman, the sacred feet of her husband be Paradise. (SR, 292) The ritualistic washing of Rama's feet by Savithri is one of the more explicit statements on women's position vis a vis men. (SR, 211) A reasonable resolution of this paradox would be that the sexes are complementary and that, just as Rama worships the latent Shakti in every woman around him,4 a woman worships the latent Siva in her men. Thus it is indistinguishable in the following quotations as to who is mother, sister, wife, and lover, for they are all devotees offering thanks and seeking Rama's protection. I love you. I love you. Protect me. (SR, 284) She in whom family pride made of you a god. After the next station she looked towards me . . . protector and companion. (SR, 32) Her eyes were long and dark . . . [she] folded her hands, knelt and touched my feet and begged, ". . . bless me. I need only your tender hands, your firm protective hands over my head." (SR, 269) 'Til thank you always," she cried, laying my small head on her swelling bosom ... I know you will always be there when I want you. And you know, if ever you need me, I will come and look after you." (SR, 294) Earlier I mentioned that Raja Rao seems convinced that a man's relationship with a woman could be a pathway to Shivoham, the Advaita Vedanta recogni- tion of "I am Siva," or Brahmai vahamasmi, "I am Brahman." Poets, seers, and philosophers through the ages have expressed a human being's search for the Absolute in bridal metaphor. Whether in Keats's "Eve of St. Agnes" or in Rao's novels, worship and ritual are integral to the search for and attainment of the Eternal Now through sexual love. In The Chess- master and His Moves Rao metaphorically develops love as "the metaphysical interlocking" that would catalyze the process of dissolution. The physical act of union, however, is usually barren, for pairs are usu- ally mismatched, "the two never so two as after the event" (CM, 96), and "We live with concubines, and do not live with our dharmapatni, our companion of dharma, of rta, of the cosmic law" (CM, 223). Meta- physical interlocking takes place between Rama and Savithri, between Sivarama and Jaya. The evening Jaya spends at Sivarama's apartment (CM, 558-88) is more intense in its passion than any actual lovemak- ing. It is significant that Rao repeats the pattern of physical nonconsummation in The Chessmaster while also repeating the pattern of sexual attraction. Rao has been steadily stretching frontiers, and he con- cludes The Chessmaster and His Moves on the threshold of an idea that slips in and out of The Serpent and the Rope: namely, incest. There is sl palpable titillating quality in Rama's relationship with his half-sisters Saroja and Sukumari in the earlier novel, and the most recent work ends teetering on the edge of actual incest. Perhaps the second part of this trilogy will take up where the first has left off, just as The Chessmaster starts with a sentence from The Serpent and the Rope (296), quoted above, but with Lakshmi metamorphosed into another Savithri and called Jaya in the story. Perhaps the third part of the trilogy will pick up Michel, who leaves this novel after "coming to me, kissed me on both cheeks, hugging me with a deep, long, forlorn sigh. Some- thing had been seen and known. But what, who could say?" (CM, 671). If he does, the interpretation that I have about Rao's philosophy of masculine and femi- nine principles is likely to be sorely tested- or per- haps vindicated in light of the increasing occurrence of washing and purification images in his later works. Washing images can be peculiarly ambivalent given the Hindu connotation of preparing to receive divin- ity and the Freudian connotation of guilt. In light of all that he has published to date, I would postulate that Raja Rao the writer has been gifted with a revelation of the essential androgyny of human sensibilities but that Raja Rao the thinker seems a male chauvinist who identifies masculine sensibility with the male gender and feminine sensibility with the female gender and has carried this to such an extent in his latest novel that it seems to be an insufferable heap of chauvinistic pomposity in which, moreover, all the literary flaws of his earlier nov- els - split plots, slow action, weak narrative devices such as diary entries, and imbalanced characteriza- tion - appear in a magnified version. In the Ma- habharata, Krishna once lengthened Draupadi's sari into an endless ream to prevent the lewd looks of the Kauravas from dishonoring her chaste body; Rao</page><page sequence="3">576 WORLD LITERATURE TODAY seems to have stretched out his recent novel into an endless ream of words so as to prevent even the most patient of readers from finding out that the core is just a hollow echo of his masterpieces of earlier years. However loud and interminable the voice of the thinker, The Chessmaster and His Moves seems a monumental work, an audacious undertaking of a trilogy at an age past the usual span of three score and ten allotted to a life. Clearly, a work twelve years in the writing deserves a much longer period of study than is presently possible; but to zero in on one of the major ideas that runs through Rao's fiction, it reiter- ates and clarifies the writer's serendipitous discovery of the androgynous wealth of human relationships that we should treasure. What follows is an analysis of the masculine and feminine principles as they can be gleaned from Rao's fiction. Two quotations may serve as a focus in this analysis. The first reads: "Thus the king is masculine to his Kingdom and feminine in relation to the Absolute, the Truth" (SR, 171). A writer is like a king. He has to be masculine and feminine, which Rao is, and hence his greatness. Indeed, all human beings have both masculine and feminine sensibilities, as Rao records, though he does not seem to be conscious of it. The second quote says: "There was but one woman - one form, one sound, one love" (SR, 132). There are two ways of under- standing this statement. One is that Rama sees the same essential spirit, Shakti, in every woman and bows in adoration to it. This would explain why Rama's thoughts and emotions for mother, wife, sis- ter, whore, and lover are all the same, as I have explained in the chapter on Rao in my book A Study of Representative Indo-English Novelists (1976). The other possible reading of the second state- ment, however, is relevant to the understanding of love relationships in Rao's fiction. No matter how many forms Siva assumes, he always marries Parvati; no matter how many avatars Vishnu takes, Lakshmi is also born to become his wife. Thus, when Savithri says, "I've known my Lord for a thousand lives, from Janam to Janam have I known my Krishna" (SR, 210), she is affirming that there is but one man for a woman, life after life. A true marriage, then, is not only till death do them part, but beyond death. Rama and Savithri, Jaya and Sivarama are bound forever, and any other relationship they form is of no real substance. Thus Rama's liaison with Lakshmi is in- consequential, a brief indulgence of the lazy hungers of the skin; what is harder for us to accept is that his marriage to Madeleine too is placed on par with his liaison; in The Chessmaster it is even more repugnant that Sivarama should cavort in turn with Suzanne and Mireille and seek to rationalize this by a long dis- quisition on the wastefulness of celibacy: "Celibacy is no solution to the problem of the abhuman" (CM, 569). Rao's implicit comparison of Rama and Sivarama to Lord Krishna by having their women love each other the way the Gopis did in their common bond with Krishna is a literalizing of a metaphor that is quite unsuccessful. As for the adulatory respect they re- ceive because they are Brahmins, after reading The Chessmaster, despite my own Brahmin heritage, I could sympathize with Rao's detractors in India, who find his message odiously arrogant. The flaw lies partly in Rao's characterization but mainly in his identification of abstract qualities with gender and in his endless propensity for sweeping generalizations. Still, the gold is there for those who would sift through the sand. There are two forces in the uni- verse, Siva and Shakti. Siva is Essence, and Shakti is the power that gives Form to Essence. More encom- passing than Blake's Albion and Jerusalem or Shel- ley's Demogorgon and Prometheus, Siva and Shakti are twin forces behind the cycles of creation. As with the Apollonian-Dionysian dichotomy, there are pairs of qualities associated with Siva and Shakti: Essence and Form, Stasis and Movement, Reason and Emo- tion, King and Subject, God and Devotee, Void and World, Everlasting Now and Death, Eternity and linear Time, Silence and Sound. At the cosmic level, in each cycle Siva is in the stasis of meditation, comes out of meditation, and unites with Shakti, giving rise to infinite movement in eternal harmony. Part of this phase is the world, the earth with its teeming life forms. Then Siva absorbs Shakti within itself, the world is dissolved, and Siva once more is in the stasis of meditation. Dissolution is part of the natural cycle of creation. Siva and Shakti are complementary and indispensable to each other. At the anthropomorphic level, unfortunately, Siva and Shakti have become Man and Woman - that is, male and female genders rather than masculine and feminine sensibility. By an understandable but ironic inversion, Siva, who is inert essence, became associ- ated with the male, and Shakti, the active compo- nent, became linked with the female - understand- able in that since Essence is perceived as preceding and therefore superior, it was made masculine by postprimeval society. The first leap one must take, then, is that of recognizing the inversion. So when Rao says, "To worship woman is to redeem the world," he means that the redemption of the world lies in its dissolution so that essence can return to its primordial form after absorbing the manifested world. As in Shelley's "Adonais," the world is a prismatic configuration of the white light of Eternity and must be dissolved, however beautiful. At the cosmic level there is equality, but at the personal level, since Rao equates the principles with separate genders, what emerges is a confirmation of the Miltonic myth, He for God only, she for God in him. This leads him to say elsewhere through Jaya, "Thus, the pyre of the Lord for the sati" (CM, 84). An inflammatory statement (pun intended) in the con- temporary context, since the practice of suttee has hit the headlines in India after a century of obscurity. However, Rao himself shows that gender is inconse- quential. At the personal level, this process of disso-</page><page sequence="4">PARAMESWARAN 577 lution can take place through sexual union, through personal relationships, and through meditation. A love relationship combines the first two; a guru- disciple relationship combines the last two. The guru plays an important part in personal redemption. In Kanthapura Gandhi is such a guru; Rama hears the call clearly at the end of The Serpent and the Rope and breaks into rhapsody; the Cat is the mysterious guru in The Cat and Shakespeare; in The Chessmas- ter and His Moves, whose cover illustration has an ascetic's wooden sandals on a chessboard, there are numerous references to the power of the guru in metaphors related to mathematics and chess, and perhaps the novel should be read mainly in that light rather than in the light of Sivarama's love relation- ships. It is also shown that the guru is a sage, and "the sage is the Truth which includes everything, the masculine and the feminine" (CM, 304). Brahman, that which Rama and Sivarama so assiduously seek, "is neuter, he is neither man nor woman" (CM, 110). So Shivoham is not a male prerogative after all. How can it be? For Advaita is monistic, everything devolv- ing into the one spirit that pervades the universe. It would seem an inconsistency to insist on the duality of male and female instead of recognizing the pres- ence of the masculine and feminine forces within both male and female beings as he records in his earlier novels. For example, Little Mother chants "Shivoham" in Benares "as at home." However, in The Chessmaster there are too many references to the unequal complementarity of the sexes to con- clude otherwise than that Rao himself subscribes to the traditional tenets of male superiority. One wonders if Rama and Sivarama would not have gone further perhaps if they had recognized the interplay of masculine and feminine sensibilities within themselves. Sivarama fails with Suzanne be- cause "I sought Jayalakshmi in Suzanne, and lost the game, and she of course sought a new Robert through me, and was killing me in turn" (CM, 223). Rama's marriage fails because he confuses their androgynous sensibilities with their gender. In an act of love, usually the Shakti in the woman rises to meet the Siva in the man; but it could just as well work the other way in that the Siva in the woman could rise to meet the Shakti in the man; this is what could have happened when Madeleine and Rama came together after his return from India. She might then have taken me into herself as never before, not with the knowledge that she knew me, but with the conviction that she would make me know myself in the shine of annihilation. But I'm a Brahmin, and for me touch and knowledge go with the holiness of surren- der, of woman not taking me there, but I revealing to her that. (SR, 64) This is unfortunate, for elsewhere Rao records the equal and essential complementarity of lovers: for example, "We become ourself by becoming another" (SR, 79). The elephant, that mysterious symbol of potency and intuitive perception in both The Serpent and the Rope and The Chessmaster and His Moves, commu- nicates with Madeleine and is understood by Jaya. The Kanthaka allusion from the story of Buddha, moreover, is applicable to all four; though Rama and Sivarama talk and think about it, Madeleine is the only one who mounts Kanthaka and rides away from the attachments of the world. However, Madeleine is seen as betraying herself because she is a woman; for a woman, her womb is her life, and just as a temple needs a bell, a girl needs a husband to make the four walls shine (SR, 272). Rao justifies this discrimination by repeatedly pointing out that a woman's worship of her man makes him Siva so that he can absorb her and thus take them both back into primordial form- lessness. Seen thus, women are given a superior role, so to speak; but in his interview with Shobhana Bhattacharji, Rao shows he believes in this myth in its more denigrating reading, because it is upheld by all traditions: "So if you don't accept it then I'm sorry for you, I am really sorry for you." Advaita Vedanta, which Raja Rao advocates in all his novels, would have to be androgynous because of its nondualistic nature, but commentators and imbal- anced societal evolution have confused sensibility with sex, concomitantly denigrating the feminine principle and the female sex. Rao the cerebral philos- opher magnifies these distortions in The Chessmaster and His Moves. However, Rao the intuitive writer has brilliantly dealt with the interaction of sensi- bilities in his earlier novels, where both men and women have both masculine and feminine sensi- bilities and are sometimes weak, sometimes strong, but essentially human despite their creator. University of Winnipeg 1 Works by Raja Rao cited in this essay are the latest cited in the bibliography of this special issue of WLT and are referred to by the following parenthetic abbreviations: Kanthapura (K), The Serpent and the Rope (SR), The Cat and Shakespeare (CS), Comrade Kirillov (CK), and The Chessmaster and His Moves (CM). 2 The terms masculine and feminine might themselves sound chauvinistic to some, but it is practical to accept the qualities and connotations of traditional nomenclature as long as it is understood that the principles they represent are equal and complementary. 3 Raja Rao is usually noncommittal in his interviews, but Sho- bhana Bhattacharji's interview (Book Review, September-October 1982, pp. 63-67) is one in which Rao was more explicit than customary. There he explained that he uses Hindu as an adjective, as in the corresponding term Christian values, and not as signify- ing specific religious bases. In his latest novel he has followed through with this by lowercasing such words as hindu, Jewish, et cetera. In the same interview he justifies his equating of Hindu with Indian, for "I say to you in all honesty that if people don't realize that India is Hindu then they must realize this." His point is that all of India has the same system of values. 4 Cf. the chapter on Raja Rao in my monograph, A Study of Representative Indo-English Novelists, Delhi, Vikas, 1976.</page></plain_text>
