<plain_text><page sequence="1">SCIENCE, NATURE, AND CHRISTIANITY SINCE the eighteenth century many people had come to conceive of the historical relationship between science on the one hand and religion, represented by Christian theology, on the other as one of conflict. They believed that, especially in its early stages, modern science had to press forward against vigorous religious opposition (the case of Galileo providing the prime example), and they found this not at all surprising because of their conviction that the birth of science formed part of a great recovery of the sweetness and light of classical times, their rationality and interest in the world of nature. The enmity of an otherworldly and authoritarian religion, with its gloomy pre occupation with sin and death and its contempt and negation of all things natural, could then be almost taken for granted. Today, there are few people with any knowledge who would subscribe to such a view. The study of history, the history of ideas, and the history of science has not stood still, and it now seems that matters are much more complicated than they were once supposed to be. Among the attempts to arrive at a new and better picture of the relation between Christianity and science1 one is of special interest in that in certain respects it represents a direct reversal of the traditional attempt. For what is asserted in this case is that, far from being in any opposition to the Christian faith, science is in fact a consequence or outgrowth of it, while the conceptions prevalent in classical antiquity were a hindrance, an obstacle that had to be overcome before science as we know it could make its appearance. The proponents of this view (who had some forerunners in the nineteenth century and to whom, for want of a better name, I shall refer as 'revisionists') very often seem to have apologetic intentions. Far from replacing and superseding religion as a comprehensive view and interpretation of the world, they wish to say that science was in its origins itself dependent on one particular religion, and if it is to endure and to be of further benefit, this dependence has to be recognized and reaffirmed. For it is not merely a matter of the past. Since the revisionist shares with most of his agnostic opponents the positive evaluation of 1 I shall throughout use the term 'Christian' in the sense of 'Jewish-Christian'. For in the present context it is not necessary to separate the elements of the New from those of the Old Testament. By the term 'science' (or 'modern science') I shall refer to science as it has existed since the times of Galileo and Descartes.

For apologetic purposes there are, however, dangers in this position, and since the reputation of science has become somewhat tarnished of late, many theologians will perhaps think it in future more promising to further the prestige of their religion by maintaining that it demands man's respect for his so-called environment rather than its manipulation and control. I am not, however, concerned here with the apologetic aspect of the case but with the question whether it has any merits as a historical and philo sophical thesis. It is, therefore, necessary to look at it in some detail.1 I Why is modern science here regarded as 'the child of the Christian faith' (to use the words of one author)?2 The argument starts with a thesis on the classical view of God and nature. For the Greeks nature, or the world, was eternal and uncreated, with neither beginning nor end in time. The gods of popular religion were personifications of natural forces, while the God of the philosophers was either a generator or an artificer. As a generator he has begotten the world like a natural father; as an artificer he has fashioned it like a craftsman. In either case he is dependent on pre-existing matter and form and has not created in the Jewish-Christian sense, that is, ex nihilo. In short, he is not autonomous but dependent, and what he is dependent on is in the last analysis fate or necessity. There are several consequences of these conceptions, and two in particular are of importance. One is that under Greek assumptions no sharp distinction could be made between God and nature. In other words, nature itself was seen as partaking in the character of the divine, which also means that it was seen as being animated and as having its parts endowed with mind and will, which is shown, for instance, 1 What I call 'revisionism' is developed in books and articles such as the following: J. Baillie, Natural Science and the Spiritual Life (London, 1951); E. F. Caldin, The Power and Limits of Science (London, 1949); M. B. Foster, 'The Christian Doctrine of Creation and the Rise of Modern Natural Science', Mind, 43 (1934), pp. 446-68; M. B. Foster, 'Christian Theology and Modern Science of Nature', Mind, 44 (1935), pp. 439-66, 45 (1936), pp. 1-27; M. B. Hesse, Science and the Human Imagination (London, 1954); R. Hooykaas, Religion and the Rise of Modern Science (Edinburgh and London, 1972); A. D. Lindsay, Religion, Science and Society in the Modern World (London, 1943); and A. F. Smethurst, Modern Science and Christian Belief (London, 1955). Some of these authors are only in part concerned with the topic in question, and there is none whose statement of the revisionist case is as complete as I have made it here. My description, in other words, is a composite. 2 Smethurst, op. cit., pp. 21, 71.</page><page sequence="3">SCIENCE, NATURE, AND CHRISTIANITY 57 by the Greeks' views of the celestial bodies. The other important consequence is the belief that true knowledge of nature and the world can be had, and can only be had, by considering the principles according to which nature has been formed by the Deity or deities. This is shown in particular by the Aristotelian distinction of essence and accident, for the essence of a thing can become known through its definition, i.e., by a process of pure reflection, whereas the accidents are truly accidental and so do not matter because knowledge is exclusively concerned with what is necessary and non-accidental. All this means that the Greeks were prevented from developing anything resembling modern science. If nature is divine, it is hubris to engage in an enterprise which involves the manipulation and control of nature ; and if one can know everything worth knowing by reflection, there is no point in engaging in any empirical investigation. Or rather if there is a point, it consists only in furnishing exemplifications of general principles that are themselves discovered in other ways. Experi ence, in short, is not used, and cannot be used, to infer such principles, to formulate scientific laws and theories and to provide explanations and predictions of individual empirical facts. But all these obstacles were removed by the new religion of Christi anity : that is to say, it was this religion which created the preconditions of modern science. The linchpin is the Jewish-Christian conception of God as a personal, all-powerful Being who has created the world out of nothing. This means that the world, or nature, cannot be eternal but must have a history. For it is God alone who has neither beginning nor end. It also means that God and world are completely and absolutely different from each other. God cannot be, therefore, the natural father of the world and the world an organism, for in this case both would be of the same kind. Nor can the difference between God and world resemble that between an artisan and his product, the artefact. For an artisan only gives form to already existing material by applying certain laws and principles whose validity is likewise independent of him, whereas in the case of God's creation all prior existence and all inde pendent principles are absent, everything in short that could impinge on his absolute power and autonomy. That the world is as it is, is due exclusively to his arbitrary will (and God being a personal Being and not an anonymous power, the term 'will' is quite in order here). He might have created the world differently; he might not have created it at all. Why he created it, and why he created it in the way he did, we do not know and cannot know. It is, therefore, in vain to look for final causes in nature. For us there can only be one final cause, and that is God himself. The only other causes we can possibly know are efficient</page><page sequence="4">58 ROLF GRUNER causes, and insofar in inanimate nature these are of a mechanical character, the mechanistic view of classical physics was in perfect agreement with Christian faith, nay, was even its logical consequence, while any view of nature as an organism is incompatible with it. The voluntaristic conception of the Christian God entails, of course, also the adoption of empirical procedures in the investigation of nature. There is no blueprint of creation which one could discover by the light of reason ; the only way to find out what and how things are in the world is by observation and experiment. Contrary to common belief, the Christian faith does not put any obstacles in the way of such investi gations. On the contrary, they are not only allowed but positively demanded of the believer, as can be seen from passages in Scripture such as Eccles. i. 13, where it is said that God has given man the task 'to search out all that is done under heaven'. The Greeks—and Plato and the Neoplatonists in particular—had fallen into a dualism according to which matter is intrinsically bad (which was the reason, for instance, why the demiurge could not reproduce the ideal pattern completely and perfectly in the empirical world). According to the Christian view, however, matter, nature, the world are good because their Creator is good. A world created by a good God cannot be evil, and if God incarn ated himself, the flesh cannot be intrinsically bad. It is already for this reason that the concern with God entails the concern with his creation. Hence, an interest in the world, a curiosity about it, and the endeavour to know it become religious duties. They amount to the glorification of God in his works and to the recognition of natural phenomena as symbols of spiritual grace. The pursuit of science takes on the character of divine worship. But the preoccupation with the knowledge of nature is demanded by the Christian faith also because of the demand for charity. Since according to Gen. i. 26-7, man has been given dominion over the rest of creation, he has a right to exercise this dominion. And since the exercise by way of science is the most effective means to be of benefit to one's fellow man (by diminishing suffering and ameliorating his condition on earth generally), one has a duty to science because one has a duty to charity. The twin elements of theory and practice in scientific knowledge are thus based on the religious precept that this knowledge be dedicated to 'the glory of the Creator and the relief of man's estate', to quote Bacon's well-known formula.1 From here leads an easy path to the further point that the virtues necessary for the successful pursuit of scientific knowledge are Christian 1 Advancement of Learning, Book i. Francis Bacon, Works, coll. and ed. by J. Spedding, R. L. Ellis, and D. D. Heath, new edn. (London, 1879-90), iii, p. 294.</page><page sequence="5">SCIENCE, NATURE, AND CHRISTIANITY 59 virtues. It goes without saying that the man of science must be courage ous, patient, persevering, self-controlled, and in possession of a sense of vocation. It is equally obvious that he must have a respect for truth and must put intellectual integrity above self-interest. But since science stands in the service of humanity, and since it is itself an enterprise of an eminently social and co-operative character demanding the free expression and exchange of ideas, what is necessary is also a respect for persons, especially in so far as it expresses itself in tolerance, a sense of brotherhood, and a love of liberty. Last but not least there is the Christian virtue of humility which here takes the form of a willing defer ence to the empirical facts and the acknowledgement that no result is ever final. Here the difference between the scientific investigator and the typical thinker of ancient Greece is particularly obvious. For the latter was a man who thought his mind powerful enough to acquire knowledge without the humble submission to the details of reality, knowledge moreover which he believed to be finished and final and neither capable nor in need of further improvement. This last point is of special significance because it indicates how much the modern view of science as an everlasting progressive quest is connected with the Christian idea that no complete model is possible for the Christian life because the spirit of active love is without limit and God has assigned to man the perfection of morality as a never-ending task. Finally (and with this point I shall bring this summary of the revision ist case to a close) it is evident that no science would be possible without the assumptions that there is order and regularity in nature and that the human mind is capable of recognizing it. But these assumptions are connected with religious ideas. True, the existence of order does not logically entail the existence of God—the argument from design is invalid. But the belief in order makes little sense if on prior and indepen dent grounds one does not also believe in a rational Deity that has created this order. Although it would go too far to say that adherence to the Christian faith is a necessary precondition for the pursuit of science, there is no doubt that such an adherence provides an immense stimulus and encouragement, as is also shown by the intense religiosity of almost all the founders and pioneers of modern science. And what holds for the belief in order, mutatis mutandis also holds for the belief in man's capability of knowing it. II It is obvious that the defender of a view such as I have here outlined is immediately confronted with two difficulties. The first can be indi cated by the question why, if Christianity was so favourable to the</page><page sequence="6">6o ROLF GRUNER establishment of science, it took so long before science did in fact come into existence. The answer to this is, in effect, that for centuries this religion had been corrupted by pagan elements. The Platonic/Neo platonic influence was responsible for the distrust of the body and the whole otherworldly character of the faith, a feature that hampered the study of nature and is in conflict with original Christianity. And the Aristotelianism of the Middle Ages constituted a further perversion because it was an attempt to put this religion in an alien and unaccept able philosophical form, especially as regards final causes and teleo logical explanations which, in effect, reintroduced something like the Greek view of nature as animated and divine. It was really only Protest antism, and especially Puritanism, which purged the Christian faith from the pagan elements and thus removed the obstacles that were lying in the way of science. (It is good to remember at this point that most revisionists are Protestants themselves.) The second difficulty which has to be mastered is that modern science, since the eighteenth century if not before, has not followed religious lines and has not been pursued in the spirit in which according to the revisionist it should have been pursued. Whether one does or does not subscribe to the view that science bears a major responsibility for the steady process of secularization and the steady dimunition of the role played by religion in the life of modern man, there can be no doubt that it has been used by agnostics and atheists as a very powerful and efficient stick with which to beat religious faith. Even if one wants to speak here of a gigantic misunderstanding of either science or religion or both, one still has to explain how it could arise and be so widely shared. The revisionists, therefore, have to say in one form or other that something went wrong somewhere but that this development was not a necessary one, that is, was not either inherent in modern science from the very beginning or one of its logical outcomes. They differ, however, in their views as to what precisely it was that went wrong and when. While some1 point the accusing finger to the rela tively late idea that man, too, can and should become an object of science, for others2 the crucial event occurred somewhat earlier when the appli cation of the determinist hypothesis was extended from inanimate nature (where it is in place) to animate nature (where it is improper). And at least one author3 locates the trouble in the dichotomies which arose already in the very early days of modern science, such as the dualism of faith and reason found with Bacon, of primary and secondary 1 For instance, Lindsay, op. cit., p. 40. 2 For instance, Smethurst, op. cit., p. 63. 3 Hesse, op. cit., pp. 47 ff.</page><page sequence="7">SCIENCE, NATURE, AND CHRISTIANITY 61 qualities found with Galileo, and of mental and material substances found with Descartes, all views which are seen as having been destruc tive to the high conception of science as divine worship. It should be quite clear by now why this kind of reasoning is necessary —that is, why the revisionist has to deny that the indifference, if not hostility to religion shown or encouraged by modern science in its later phases was inevitable. If there is a straight path, a natural connection between Christian faith and science and between science and a non religious attitude and way of life, then this faith carried within itself from the beginning the seeds of its own destruction. And this no true Christian can admit. For him, therefore, there is either no such connec tion between his religion and science, or the development of science towards religious indifference was not inevitable. Since it is just the revisionist's thesis that there is an intrinsic connection between Christi anity and science, he has to take the second option, and this amounts to the denial that, given the progress of science in the last three hundred years or so, the accompanying process of secularization was automatic. In short, the revisionist has to believe that one can have a civilization which is intensely scientific and intensely religious at the same time. In the end, however, revisionism is perhaps best seen as part of a more general endeavour that has been a major preoccupation of theo logians for at least a century, the endeavour to show that there is not and cannot be any real opposition, incompatibility, or inconsistency be tween science on the one hand and religion on the other, a view to which the revisionist merely adds his thesis that on the contrary the Christian faith is even favourable to science and has in fact been its main pro genitor. All those who have drawn agnostic or atheist conclusions from scientific knowledge are thus charged with a mistake ; the whole philo sophy or Weltanschauung of naturalism is taken to be based on in sufficient knowledge or fallacious reasoning. 111 The revisionist case is not a tenable one, and some of the reasons will be given in what follows. No doubt, the basic facts are not in dispute: the ancients did not develop science in the modern sense while after one and a half thousand years of Christianity this science did come into existence. Assuming that we can discount outside (for instance, oriental) influences, it follows that something must have been provided in the interval which was missing before. But saying this is saying very little, and the revisionist thesis goes, of course, much further. It cannot, therefore, be accused of triviality.</page><page sequence="8">62 ROLF GRUNER I do not, however, propose to submit it to a systematic criticism point by point. That would not be possible here, and in many cases it is also not necessary because the weaknesses are too glaring. It is quite obvious, for example, that the virtues listed as necessary for the pursuit of science are neither specifically Christian in character nor of specific relevance to the man of science. In order to engage successfully in scientific investigations there is no need for a special love of humanity or the belief in the brotherhood of men ; and as for the humble submission to experience everybody is in need of it: if the pipe, after having been mended, still leaks, it leaks ; and that is a fact even a plumber does well to acknowledge if he wants to stay in business. The idea that modern science furthers such things as reasonableness and tolerance, and social or political institutions which are alleged to be based on them, is one that is shared by many theists, atheists, and agnostics alike, and religion has not much to do with it. But going into points of this nature is also of little value because they are not essential to the revisionist case: they can be conceded without conceding the thesis itself. The criticism must concern itself with more extensive areas, and in particular with those that have to do with the character of Greek thought, of the Christian religion, and of modern science respectively. In each case we have to ask whether the picture with which we are here presented is reasonably fair and true to life, and whether the relations between the three items are really of the alleged character. Now, the most striking feature when one considers the revisionist thesis in total is the idea of Christianity that is involved here. For what is asserted is no less than that for the first fifteen hundred years of its existence this religion had been perverted by paganism: at the very beginning it was in a pure and pristine state but almost immediately it came under alien influence, and distortion and corruption set in. Perhaps this is no more than a modern version of the traditional defence of the Protestant Reformation as a return to the origins and the true spirit as it existed in early times. It raises the question as to how one decides on what constitutes this original spirit, and the Protestant answer has always been that this decision must be based on the text of the Bible, an answer which makes sense only under the presupposition that this text speaks with one voice and that a true and unambiguous understanding can be distilled from it. The validity of this assumption must remain problematic but even if it could be taken as proved, there can be little doubt that in the revisionist case the understanding is a very curious one. For this case gets started only by ignoring at least one of the great Christian dogmas, the dogma of</page><page sequence="9">SCIENCE, NATURE, AND CHRISTIANITY 63 the Fall and original sin. Even if it should be true that a good God can have created only a good world (and in Gen. i. 31-3 we can indeed read that God saw what he had created was good) it is still another question whether what was created good remained good, and according to Christian teaching it did not. Whether this is in the end a consistent position—whether the origin of evil in a good world created by a good God is intelligible—need not concern us here. (Nor is it necessary to consider the question whether he who argues from a good God to a good world would not be obliged to argue also from an infinitely good God to an infinitely good world.) The fact remains that according to this religion evil did come into being and has been with us ever since, which means that since the Fall the world has not been any longer a 'good world'. To say that the belief in the world's corrupt character is itself a corruption of Christianity is in the end saying that the doctrine of the Fall is a corruption, and this is preposterous, especially if by implication Plato and the Neoplatonists are blamed for a central dogma of the Old Testament.1 Seeing the world as fallen has implications for the importance one attaches to worldly matters, hence also to the knowledge of such matters, and hence also to the knowledge of nature. It does probably not entail the radical contemptus mundi and extreme enmity we find expressed towards this knowledge by so many Christian thinkers of the past (and quotations from the early Fathers via Augustine down to Luther come easily to mind here).2 But it does entail that it cannot rank very high on the scale of things which are of importance to the believer. For him, to speak with Dr. Johnson, 'the knowledge of external nature, and the sciences which that knowledge requires or includes, are not the great or the frequent business of the human mind' and man is not placed here 'to watch the growth of plants, or the motion of the stars.'3 The revision ists try to support their thesis by quotations from Scripture, but this is of little value because for every passage where the knowledge of nature is apparently permitted or demanded, another passage can be found where it seems to be forbidden or warned against. If we can read in 1 As far as Plato himself is concerned it is in any case a distortion to speak of his philosophy as one in which no value is ascribed to nature : in certain respects the Platonic world of forms would be deficient without the sensible world, and God 'unsupplemented' by nature would not be good and hence not divine. On this point see A. O. Lovejoy, The Great Chain of Being (1934; reprint, New York, i960), pp. 52 IT. 2 A list of relevant quotations can be found in L. Feuerbach, The Essence of Christianity, transi, by M. Evans (London, 1854), pp. 282 ff. (Appendix, §5). 3 S. Johnson, The Lives of the English Poets (London, 1832), pp. 28, 29 (in his essay on Milton).</page><page sequence="10">64 ROLF GRUNER Eccles. i. 13 that man should 'search out all that is done under heaven', we can also read in Jer. xxxi. 37 that the Lord will cast off the seed of Israel 'if heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath'. But to return for a moment to the radical contemptus mundi I have just mentioned and its relationship to modern science. To engage in the latter it is necessary to believe that the knowledge of nature is im portant and desirable, and since the former entails the opposite belief, the two cannot be reconciled with each other. It has, however, been argued1 that the contemptus mundi has nevertheless encouraged the establishment of modern science because it did away once and for all with the idea of nature's divine character and thus qualified it as an object of science. Now, I shall later argue myself that modern science is indeed dependent on the idea that the objects of nature have no intrinsic value. But the character of this 'contempt of nature', if one wants to call it thus, and that of the contempt of the world found in the Christian literature are not the same. For the latter is not so much a contempt of nature—of rivers and mountains, rocks and trees, birds and beasts—as a contempt of 'worldly things', that is, of riches, power, fame, bodily health, sensual pleasure, etc., and also of knowledge in so far as it is not of a religious character. But this does not mean that the objects of such knowledge must be included in the contempt. Condem ning the enterprise of the classical philosopher who wants to establish the nature of justice is not condemning justice. Seeing in the activity of the astronomer a proud and vainglorious undertaking is not seeing in the stars and planets objects without value. (In fact, if God has created them, they presumably must have some value.) To put the matter in a somewhat exaggerated form, one might say that the contemptus mundi entails the contempt of the knowledge but not of the objects of nature, whereas the enterprise of modern science entails the high esteem of the knowledge of nature and the contempt of its objects. Both may, there fore, be viewed as opposites, and there is no way that leads from the one to the other. But if the dogma of the Fall has always been an obstacle for the Christian advocate of science, it is only in part for reasons of this kind. Modern science has been regarded since its beginnings as a human enterprise for the amelioration, and perhaps even elimination of human misery—that is, of the consequences of the Fall—whereas according to Christian doctrine it is absolutely out of the question that these consequences could be overcome by secular means. Francis Bacon already had to go to some trouble in order to reconcile the Fall Foster, 'Christian Theology . . Mind, 44 (1935), p. 443.</page><page sequence="11">SCIENCE, NATURE, AND CHRISTIANITY 65 of man (and of nature, too) with the hoped-for delivery of man by the new science. The Fall, he declared, was not due to man's desire to know nature but to know good and evil and thus to become like the Deity. There was, however, a second Fall, caused by his attempt to 'impress the stamp of (his) own image on the creatures and works of God, instead of carefully examining and recognising in them the stamp of the Creator himself.'1 In other words, the second Fall occurred because of the proud endeavour (especially of the Aristotelians) to know nature by the power of innate reason, without engaging in observation and experi ment. But its consequences (and this means by and large man's loss of his dominion over nature) can be overcome by the new science, whereas the consequences of the first Fall can be overcome only by religion. From views like these it can be seen to what extent the revi sionist case is really the case of Bacon refurbished for the twentieth century, especially as regards the association of science via empiricism with humility and of classical and scholastic philosophy via ration alism with arrogance and pride. IV I have said or implied that the negative attitude of early Christianity to secular knowledge was dependent on the negative attitude to the world which in turn arose out of the Christian dogma of the Fall. This might seem to constitute an absolute break with the classical tradition, and in many respects this is indeed the case. On the other hand, it is no less true that it did not prevent, and perhaps even encouraged, continuity in other respects, and I am thinking in particular of the distinction between action and contemplation, with the higher value placed on the latter. The Latin words contemplatio and contemplari had their earlier counterparts in the Greek theoria and theorein. In both cases what was denoted was a form of knowledge and a way of life at the same time, so that contemplative knowledge may be contrasted with practical know ledge and contemplation with action. Although the tradition reaches back to the Presocratics,2 its clearest expression in classical times is found later. Contemplation is an effortless, untroubled beholding of the truth and has no purpose outside itself. It is thus absolutely unaffected by any consideration of practice or utility. This entails not only the absence of any endeavour to change existing states of affairs but even of the mere wish that things should be different from what they are. At the same time it is of such a nature that the difference between the 1 Historia Naturalis et Expérimentales, Preface. Bacon, Works, v, p. 132. 2 On Anaxagoras see Diogenes Laertius, ii. 10. 3336 C 74</page><page sequence="12">66 ROLF GRUNER contemplating subject and the contemplated object is preserved. They remain separate and at a distance from each other and do not fuse in a mystical union. The contemplative life, according to Aristotle, is superior to all others, even to the political life, because it alone con stitutes happiness. All others are 'unleisurely and aim at an end and are not desirable for their own sake', whereas contemplation, and con templation alone, is self-sufficient, leisurely, and unwearied. Such a life, however, is not truly human, and man can live it only because and insofar something divine is present in him.1 When we consider the Christian attitude we find that for a very long time indeed the core of the classical conception was preserved, in spite of the fact that the object of contemplation had now become the Christian God and that the contemplative life was usually associated with the monastic life. The important point is that, although the active life was conceived to contain as its most important part the exercise of Christian charity, the palm was given nevertheless, just as in classical times, to contemplation. The scriptural justification of this preference, which can be found with Origen, Augustine, Gregory the Great, and others, was provided by the episode of the sisters Martha and Mary in Luke x. 38-42: when Martha complained to Jesus that Mary simply sat and listened at the Lord's feet, instead of helping her sister with the service, he replied 'Martha, Martha, thou art anxious and troubled about many things: but one thing is needful: for Mary hath chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her.' This was taken to mean that, though the active life for the benefit of others was good, the contemplative life of beholding the Lord was better. For, as Augustine said, what Martha chooses passes away: she ministers to the hungry, the thirsty, the homeless: but all these pass away while Mary's part will not pass.2 Or in short, action, even charitable action, is only a means to an end, whereas contemplation is an end in itself. Of course, the Christian duty to be charitable was not denied by Augustine or anyone else. But it was not given the comprehensive scope which modern theologians are prone to ascribe to it. To be charitable then meant to care for the basic needs of those one happens to meet, to which Augustine added that one should also not decline public office when the necessity arises. But he, in common with others, emphasized 1 Eth. Nie., 7, ii77b, iff. (transi. W. D. Ross). 2 Sermones, clxix. 17 (Migne, P.L. xxxviii. 925). It is significant that with a mystic like Meister Eckhart we find the exact reversal of this interpretation (and hence the downgrading of contemplation) : when Mary was sitting at the Lord's feet, she had still to achieve what Martha had achieved already; she had still to learn how to be tiichtig, to be active and productive : Maria und Martha, Sermon iiber Lukas 10. 38. Meister Eckehart, Schriften (Jena, 1934), pp. 254-62.</page><page sequence="13">SCIENCE, NATURE, AND CHRISTIANITY 67 that these are burdens imposed upon us, and that they are not to be sought out and delighted in for their own sakes.1 As time passed changes occurred as to how the vita activa was con ceived, and the relationship to the vita contemplativa came also to be seen in a somewhat different way. But the latter was still regarded as the better of the two. To take at least a brief look at Thomas Aquinas, we find that for him it is not only that the active life, to be valuable, must flow from contemplation, but that the active life is properly speaking a preparation for the contemplative life: vita activa est dispositio ad contemplativam.2 For even though the former brings with it its own kind of happiness, it cannot by its very nature be the final resting place and so finds its fulfilment only in the latter. In other words, Thomas agrees with Aristotle that the last and highest felicity can consist only in contemplation : ultima hominis félicitas (est) in contemplatione veritatis.3 It was only with Renaissance humanism that the superiority of the contemplative life became doubtful. Those who were intent on the return to the classical sources were no longer sure of this classical ideal and started to consider whether the vita activa (and this for many meant now the civic, the political life) was not after all to be preferred. When we come to Francis Bacon, however, the chief trumpeter of modern science, as he has been called, there is hardly a question any more : contemplation is out and action is in. And it is to be expected that a man who saw knowledge as power would have no use for contem plation. The acquisition and exercise of the power that is knowledge is associated by Bacon with Christian charity. And charity for him did not mean any longer the relatively modest duty to help the needy we encounter in daily life, but it meant no less than the improvement of the well-being of mankind. Since this can be achieved only by knowledge that is based on action (i.e., on experiment) and that is useful for action (i.e., for technological and other application), it is no surprise that con templative life and knowledge acquired for Bacon the character of selfish ideals. The common good, he held, 'decides the question touching the preferment of the contemplative life, and decides it against Aristotle. For all the reasons which he brings for the contemplative respect private good, and the pleasure or dignity of a man's self.'4 As can be seen from 1 De Civ. Dei, xix. 19. One is reminded here of Plato who in Republic, vii. 540, wrote as follows: 'when their (the philosophers) turn comes, they will endure the toil of directing politics and being rulers for the sake of their city, regarding such action not as anything noble but as a compulsion laid upon them' (transi. A. D. Lindsay). 2 In 3 Sent., dist. 35, q. 1. a. 3. sol. 3. 3 Summa Contra Gentiles, III. xxxvii. * De Augmentis Scientiarum, Book VII, Ch. 1 (Bacon, Works, v, p. 8). In one place, however, Bacon did acknowledge that 'the very contemplation of things,</page><page sequence="14">68 ROLF GRUNER such a passage, Bacon was no longer conscious of the problem that had preoccupied so many of his predecessors, the problem of ends as against that of means : assuming the man of charity has achieved what he set out to achieve—the hungry are fed, the naked clothed, the homeless housed, the ill cured—what is he going to do then, what is he going to live for the7i ? It needs no proof that Bacon's attitude was to become the prevailing one in the modern world. The Marxist, the liberal, the positivist, the existentialist, they all share the distaste for an ideal which in pre-modern times had never been in serious dispute. Bacon's accusation of egoism has been echoed through three centuries,1 and as one would expect, it can also be found, implicitly or explicitly, with revisionism, so when the 'attitude of philosophic detachment and aloof intellectual superiority to practical utility' is contrasted with 'the Christian duty to "have a con cern for" the physical welfare and betterment of one's fellow men',2 or when 'the ideal man of the wisest of the ancients' is characterized as 'a snobbish prig whom we should not care to meet today'.3 In this respect the revisionist position is certainly consistent. For it goes without saying that the ideal of contemplative knowledge can have no place in modern science. Its aim and character are different, and what in science is now called 'theory' has nothing in common with theoria or contemplatio. Hence, if one wants to represent science as an offspring of Christianity one has either to ignore contemplation altogether or to deny that it forms a genuine part of the Christian tradition. By definition, as it were, there is then no place in Christianity for contemplation, or only a very minor one, and all the important space is filled with action, i.e. charity. But such a position cannot be tenable, if only because this religion is amongst other things a historical phenomenon, and we in the twentieth century are not in a position to set ourselves up as judges on what 'Christianity' means without taking account of what for the greater part of its existence Christians have thought it meant. If for no other reason, the revisionist thesis has to be dismissed because it denies, at least by implication, that this religion puts a very high, and perhaps as they are, without superstition or imposture, error or confusion, is in itself more worthy than all the fruit of inventions. ' Novum Organum, i. cxxix (Ibid., iv, p. 115). What lies behind the apparent inconsistency of these two passages is perhaps the idea that, although considered in itself contemplation is of the highest value, in this imperfect world it is man's duty to forego it in favour of a less elevated type of knowledge. 1 Macaulay is a good example. He accused the ancient philosophers (especially the Roman Stoics) not only of selfishness but also of hypocrisy and inefficiency (they did not make men better). See his essay on Bacon in the Edinburgh Revieio of July 1837 (reprinted in editions of his Essays and Lays of Ancient Rome). 2 Smethurst, op. cit., p. 46. 3 Caldin, op. cit., p. 165.</page><page sequence="15">SCIENCE, NATURE, AND CHRISTIANITY 69 supreme, value on contemplative knowledge as against any knowledge that could be called scientific. V The revisionists, like Bacon, are prone to tie knowledge to charity and thus to the active life (and hence have to take their stand against contemplation). This connection is made under the assumption that the results of scientific knowledge can be put to use in the service of human well-being, an idea which is usually expressed in the language of power. Nature is first forced to reveal her secrets to man (when she is 'put to the question' by the experimenter, to use Baconian language), and she is then forced to behave in accordance with man's wishes, that is, to do him no harm and to make his life easier. In classical times such an enterprise would have been regarded as impious and hence as dangerous, and even relatively simple undertakings, such as the laun ching of a ship or the building of a house, had to be surrounded with religious ceremonies so as to avoid or diminish this danger. When we ask why this position has changed we are given the answer that, due to the Christian conception of a Creator God, nature is no longer conceived as divine. This alone, however, is not sufficient to establish a justification for the unhesitating acquisition and exercise of power over nature. After all, the attempt of one God-created thing to gain power over all other God-created things may also be regarded as impious and presumptuous. For one would have to assume that God created all things in their own rights and for their own sakes, and that if he had intended one to dominate the rest, he would have given it dominance from the beginning. But this, it will be said, is just what God did; when he created man he bestowed on him just such an exceptional position. What this answer amounts to is the admission that the non-divinity of nature is not really the decisive point. What is decisive is the special status of man in nature, and as a rule the revisionists, like Bacon and many others before them, try to establish this special status by reference to scripture, to be more precise, by reference to two ideas which, although closely connected, are nevertheless different. One is that man, and man alone, was created in the image of God, the other that man was given dominion over the rest of creation. The key passage for both is, of course, Gen. i. 27-8, which (in the Revised Version) reads as follows: And God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him ; male and female created he them. And God blessed them : and God said unto them, Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it ; and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</page><page sequence="16">ηο ROLF GRUNER As I have no intention to get embroiled in biblical exegesis, I confine myself to some simple reflections of a general nature, starting with the point of dominion. It seems most unlikely that the meaning of this term, or rather of the Hebrew original, could have been such that it covered the attitude to nature, and the treatment of nature, that is characteristic of modern science. 'Dominion' is a political term, and there are historical and other reasons which suggest that the matter should be seen in analogy to the case of a benevolent king or ruler. It is one of the differences, and perhaps the main difference, between a good and a bad king that the former exercises his rule not, or not primarily, in his own interest but in the interest of his subjects, whereas a bad king is a selfish ruler. This difference can be expressed in terms of means and ends or of instru mental and intrinsic value. In the worst case a ruler regards his subjects merely as means to his own ends, the satisfaction of his own desires (which are directed, of course, not only to his material welfare but also to such much more intangible things as, for example, his glory or glorification). In other words, he behaves as if those he rules had no value other than that of being useful instruments to him, and if his behaviour is based on any belief at all, it is the conviction that it is he alone who is important, who counts in the world, who has intrinsic value. A good king, on the other hand, will not deny such a value to his subjects and will in consequence take responsibility for them, even if in his capacity as king he has more rights and privileges and is entitled to use his subjects as means to his own ends in so far as these ends are connected with these rights and privileges. If this analogy is accepted, it is obvious in what sense the bestowal on man of dominion over nature has to be taken. A good and benevolent God would not have intended man to be a selfish ruler. Man may use his fellow creatures for his own ends to the extent to which these ends are associated with his exceptional status, but no further. As man he owes it to God, to himself, and to his subjects that he preserves certain standards and the dignity of his position (as a king owes it to his status as a king that he does not live and behave like a peasant), and this necessitates to a certain extent the use of other created things for his own ends. He is entitled, therefore, to cultivate the soil, domesticate animals, kill them for food, fell trees and quarry stones for building houses, mine metals for fashioning tools, and other things of this kind. For without them his status as man could not be upheld. So much for the interpretation of the biblical statement about man's dominion. The reply of many of those I have called revisionists can be imagined. This, they will say, was just what they meant, adding only that</page><page sequence="17">SCIENCE, NATURE, AND CHRISTIANITY 71 modern science is nothing but an extension and further development of the justified activities I have mentioned, or rather of the knowledge on which they are based, and that the strictures about selfishness to which I have referred apply, of course, to the modern, scientific version of dominion as they applied to the old one. But such an answer will not do. It is prompted by the desire to have one's cake and eat it, and it is based on a conception of science that is mistaken. Let me explain why. As is to be expected, most revisionists put great emphasis on the demand that science should be pursued in a religious spirit. Otherwise, they fear, it can be (and perhaps will be) abused, and here again they only follow their ancestor Bacon. For Bacon already had considered the possibility that the new science he propagated might 'open a fountain, such as it is not easy to discern where the issues and streams thereof will take and fall.'1 Hence, he expressed his hope that 'the exercise thereof will be governed by sound reason and true religion.'2 This, in effect, is the acknowledgement that there is no guarantee within science which would prevent abuse and that religion (and through religion morality) has to be called in from the outside in order to make abuse impossible. And by and large this is also the position of the revisionist today. But, we have to ask, abuse in what respect, and to whose disadvantage ? When one is reading the relevant literature, whether by Bacon or his modern followers, one is left in no doubt that it is man himself the authors have in mind. That is, they fear that science may be abused to the disadvantage of man, not to the disadvantage of nature (or rather to the disadvantage of nature only in so far as the disadvantage of man is a consequence). In other words, science is to be pursued in a religious spirit so that we do not get things like Hiroshima and Vietnam and desert landscapes and poisoned rivers, and the reason why we should not get them is because they have a detrimental effect on man and his happiness. The revisionist is here, of course, again at one with his times : all the talk about 'the care for the environment', 'the social responsibility of science', and such like, is in the end geared to man and not to nature. To use the old analogy once more, it is like the case of a bad king who has been overdoing the exploitation of his subjects and finds that this is rebounding on him in person. He is, therefore, well advised to change his ways, not in the interest of his subjects but in his own interest. The subjects remain what they always were, mere means or instruments. I have to admit, however, that some revisionists go beyond this humanism and speak about man's love of nature, his child-like wonder 1 Valerius Terminus, Cap. i (Bacon, Works, iii, p. 218). 2 Novum Organum, 1. 129 (Ibid., iv, p. 115).</page><page sequence="18">72 ROLF GRUNER about his fellow creatures and the sacramental view of the sensible world. If man loves God, they reason, he must also love the things created by God.1 But although they may be right here, their position overall is not consistent. For the advocacy of the love of nature does in the end not go together with the advocacy of utility, for the simple reason that he who loves in nature only what pleases him, or what is at least not to his dis advantage, is not really loving nature at all. Presumably the virus that causes rabies, a most horrible disease, is also a creature of God, and if we love nature we have to include it in our love. This amongst other things would mean that, although we may control it, we may not exterminate it, should we have the power to do so. For love of a thing is consistent with its correction and limitation, not, however, with its extermination. And when Noah followed God's command and filled his ark with ani mals, we do not hear that he included only those that were useful or harmless to man. Beasts of prey and poisonous snakes and scorpions, and presumably also viruses, went in just as cows and sheep, cuddly rabbits, and beautiful peacocks. If this is so, however, we have a clash with the principle of charity, in the Baconian, utilitarian version to which the revisionist subscribes. Where charity towards mankind sometimes demands extermination, love of nature always demands preservation. Or, to put it in more general terms, in one case created things have intrinsic value independent of man; in the other they have merely instrumental value for man (not, of course, only as regards the physical benefits he derives from them, but also with respect to such things as aesthetic pleasure). The idea, then, that modern science is founded on two mighty pillars or basic motives, the love of nature (with the resulting wonder and curiosity about it) and charity towards mankind (with the resulting idea of using the knowledge of nature for man's benefit) is untenable. In fact, as far as science is concerned, the love of the objects with which it deals can only be a hindrance and distraction, and this is just part of the meaning of the common assertion that science is, and has to be, 'neutral' or 'value-free', or that it acknowledges only one value, the value of truth or of the rational search after truth. A man who views the things in his laboratory, whether minerals, plants, or animals, in any other way than as instruments for the achievement of his purpose of solving intellectual or practical problems, who—while he is working on them and with them—is aware that they have an intrinsic value, a dignity of their own, such a man will not get very far in his investi gation, if indeed he can engage in any investigation at all. (What attitude he adopts when he has left the laboratory, is another question. But it is Smethurst, op. cit., pp. i6ff.</page><page sequence="19">SCIENCE, NATURE, AND CHRISTIANITY 73 irrelevant for the point I am making.) To represent modern science in any other way is to misrepresent it.1 For the same reasons it is also a misrepresentation if one describes science as being merely an extension and improvement of something that has always been present. Agreed, dominion over nature in the sense in which I have taken it here is nothing new. It may even be said that it is just what makes man. But modern science is something new and not merely a continuation of this dominion by other means. The man who yokes an ox to plough his field and the man who sticks an electrode in a cat's brain in order to increase his knowledge (however beneficial this knowledge may be expected to be) cannot be listed together under the same heading 'dominion over nature'. The point is not that ploughing fields is necessary to human life while no such necessity is involved in the other case. Neither has the matter much to do with cruelty—for all I know the cat in question does not feel anything. The crucial difference lies in the fact that in one case the creature is taken to have an exclusively instrumental value, while in the other case the instrumental character is only partial. I am not thinking here only, or even mainly, of the fact that animals once had mythological and religious associations (the ox in the stable of Bethlehem, the bull as a symbol of fertility, etc.). It is simply that for the peasant his ox is not merely a thing to be used for a purpose, but a creature that has its own rights and interests, even if these have to be overruled, its own virtues and vices, its own personality, as it were, and for which, therefore, as long as it is alive, he has a res ponsibility. No such rights and interests are admitted, no such res ponsibility taken in the case of the laboratory cat, and this is why the two situations are different, not only in degree but in kind. VI I have tried to show that the biblical statement of man's dominion of nature has been viewed as providing a justification for the enterprise of modern science but that it must in fact be taken in a sense such that no such justification is entailed. It is, however, doubtful that the attempt at a Christian apology for science would have got very far without the other biblical statement, the statement that man—and this means man alone —has been created in the image of God. This seems to go much further, for while it is relatively easy to move from man's similarity to God to his 1 If somebody were to say that this attitude of viewing objects of nature as purely instrumental dates only from a later time and was not present, say, before the late eighteenth century, he would be well advised to consult the early Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society and inform himself on the experi ments described there.</page><page sequence="20">74 ROLF GRUNER right to dominion, it is not so easy to move from the latter to the former, and in Genesis the statement on the image precedes, of course, the statement on dominion. Needless to say, the doctrine of imago Dei lends itself very easily to an exalted view of man, his rights and capacities, especially if the counter balancing doctrine of the Fall is forgotten or played down. 'If man has been made in the image of God', it has been said, 'he can reasonably be expected to be able to make at least some of the things which God has made',1 and Bacon (who, as one might expect, put great emphasis on the point of the image) had already regarded man as some thing like God's fellow worker.2 The basic idea here seems to be that through science man augments his similarity to God because he is enabled to imitate him in his works to a degree incomparably higher than anything that went before. It is true, man will never manage to create ex nihilo; but—who knows—he might be able one day to create life, intelligence, and perhaps even matter. At least, this seems to be the promise that the doctrine of imago Dei has held and still holds for many people. But there is another aspect to the matter which in the present context is of great importance, and this again concerns the position of man vis-à-vis nature. To put it very briefly, from the idea that man was created in the image of God, with the support of the other idea that man has received dominion over nature, it is a short but fateful step to the further idea that God created nature for the sake of man. The reasoning here may perhaps be crudely reconstructed as follows. If God created man in his image, he created him in some ways similar to God. But God is a ruler (he is, in fact, the supreme ruler of the world), and in so far as man is similar to him, he too will have to be some kind of ruler. But to be a ruler he must have something to rule over, and without the prior existence, and hence prior creation, of something over which man can rule, the idea (and the promise) that man was created in the image of God would have little point. But in scripture it is, in fact, written, not only that man was created after all the other creatures, but also that he was explicitly given dominion over them. It stands to reason, therefore, that God created all other things, i.e. nature, for the sake of man. No doubt, as a formal argument this will not do. But prima facie it is plausible enough, and this is all that matters. For the character which a religion may or may not acquire is not determined by logicians. The 1 Hooykaas, op. cit., pp. 62-3. 2 Later Schelling was to speak of an alliance or partnership between God and man. See K. Lowith, Gott, Mensch und Welt in der Metaphysik von Descartes bis Nietzsche (Gottingen, 1967), p. 115.</page><page sequence="21">SCIENCE, NATURE, AND CHRISTIANITY 75 reasoning involved here is also not much affected by the doctrine of the Fall, and even someone who acknowledges its whole weight and impor tance can still say that, since a later event cannot change an earlier one, it cannot invalidate the statement that nature was created for man's sake. If he further assumes that nature fell with man, he can even plausibly argue that the original relationship is preserved—that nature still exists now for the sake of man. All this might be regarded as pure speculation on my part. But the fact remains that the idea that nature exists for man's sake did arise and that it arose within the Christian religion. It started in a small way, acquired a greater and greater impetus, became largely detached from the religious context, and seems today to have almost the status of a self-evident principle, even if it is rarely made explicit. In fact, there can be little doubt that this constitutes one of the major differences that distinguishes the ancients from the moderns, modern subjectivity and self-consciousness from classical objectivity and self-indifference. For the Greeks1 did definitely not view nature as existing for man, and it hardly needs such an explicit statement as that in Plato's Laws ('you are created for the sake of the whole, and not the whole for the sake of you')2 in order to prove the point. Why, in Greek thinking man did not even take the highest place amongst the works of nature, for there were at least the eternal and immutable celestial bodies above him! How then could everything else exist for his sake ? With the Jews and Christians the picture changes. God moves in the centre, and this God has a particular and special relationship to man. The question is whether for this reason man has to move into the centre with him. There is no statement in scripture to the effect that God created nature for man, but as I have tried to show, such a con clusion could be drawn without great difficulty. Nevertheless, it seems that it took more than a thousand years before it actually was drawn. With Hugh of St. Victor in the twelfth century we find not only the view that God has created man as possessorem et dominum mundi (a formulation of which five hundred years later Descartes' maîtres et possesseurs de la nature almost sounds like a translation)3 but also that the world has its final cause in the creation of man: si enim omnia Deus fecit propter hominem, causa omnium homo est.* It cannot be said, however, that a statement of this kind was typical of the Middle Ages. There were then traditions alive that discouraged the idea, and here as elsewhere matters 1 Here and in the following I am very much indebted to the work of Karl Lôwith, in particular the book referred to in the previous note. 2 Laws, 903c (transi. Β. Jowett). 3 Discours de la Méthode, 6me partie. * De Sacramentis Fidei Christianae (Migne, P.L. clxxvi. 205 bc).</page><page sequence="22">76 ROLF GRUNER did really change only with the Renaissance when anthropocentricity started to become the rule. The soul of man, Ficino declared in 1474, is the centre of the universe, its bond and juncture, the middle term of all things.1 By the end of the eighteenth century this view was apparently fully formed. For Kant could declare in 1790 that even 'the commonest Understanding . . . cannot forbear from the judgement that all the various creatures, no matter how great the art displayed in their arrange ment, and how various their purposive mutual connection . . . would be for nothing, if there were not also men (rational beings in general). With out men the whole creation would be a mere waste, in vain, and without final purpose.'2 When we come to Hegel the position is no less clear. In his metaphysics he conceived of nature as a phase in the self alienation of the absolute idea, and in his philosophy of religion he saw in it 'merely a veiling and imperfect embodiment of God', something 'which exists for Spirit and for Man'.3 The most extreme case amongst the German idealists, however, is probably that of Schelling who took Christianity in the sense that only in man has God loved the world, that there is in fact 'a weakness of God for man'. Man, therefore, is the final purpose of the universe, that being at which the whole creation aims, and thus of absolute universal importance.4 I have chosen these examples because they are explicit and still exhibit the religious connection of modern anthropocentric humanism. It would be, however, a mistake to think that this attitude is peculiar to a few German philosophers. These men were for the most part meta physicians and convinced Christians. They, therefore, expressed them selves freely in teleological and religious terms. But the underlying anthropocentricity is independent of the language used, and it can be found in almost all influential systems of ideas from the nineteenth century onwards. For the Marxists it goes without saying that man, and man only, is of any importance and that nature is merely the means and material for the development of the human forces of production. (Of Marx himself the statement is reported that 'the individual spirit is great and free only in so far as its contempt of nature is great'.5) That for 1 Opera Omnia (Basle, 1561), 1. 121, here quoted after P. O. Kristeller, Die Philosophie des Marsilio Ficino (Frankfurt, 1972), p. 103. 2 Critique of Judgement, § 86 (trans. J. H. Bernard, 2nd edn., rev.

For utilitarianism in its various forms 'man-centredness' is likewise without question. A recent critic has brought out very well the crucial point that is involved here: nothing counts but states of mind or feelings (which in almost all cases means human states) ; anything else in the range of natural or man-made things is reckoned to be a mere instrument for producing these states; and if man ceased to exist there would be no values left in the world, nothing, that is, to which either positive or negative value could be ascribed.1 My thesis then is that according to the views prevailing in our time nature exists for the sake of man, or can and should be regarded as if it existed for his sake. But, it will be asked, how can this be ? Is it not generally believed today, and is the present consciousness not in important respects formed by this belief, that over the last two centuries the various sciences have shown beyond dispute that man has no special status but is a part of nature, is, for instance, nothing more than a highly developed primate ? How can this belief be reconciled with the idea that nature exists for man's sake ? This question is justified, and it points to one of the paradoxes of the modern consciousness, a split that goes a long way to explain man's unease and uncertainty about his position in the modern world and his oscillating between feelings of grandeur and misery. On the one hand he sees himself as a being to whose wishes nature is or should be subservient, a ruler who has not only the capacity but also the right to cause all other things to do his bidding. On the other hand he sees himself as 'nothing but' a part of nature, continuous with other parts, and takes credit for a disillusioned realism, for having 'seen through' all the pretences and self-deceptions of previous ages, for his ability to trace back what once seemed to be specifically human to 'mere' nature. The words 'nothing but' and 'mere' are in place here, for nature is now conceived in an exclusively secular manner ; it only points to itself and to nothing else; it is no longer seen as having sacral or spiritual significance, for seeing it in this way would be considered anthropomorphic—and it would, of course, also inhibit the treatment of nature as a means to an end. There can be only one consequence of this paradoxical situation, and that is the attempt at self-manipulation. Man controls nature; man is part of nature; hence man controls himself, and by doing so he becomes his own liberator. For he then completely determines what he is and what he is to be. The pathos of self-determination dates from about the same time as modern science. In 1487 Pico della Mirandola composed an 1 S. Hampshire, Morality and Pessimism, The Leslie Stephen Lecture igj2 (Cambridge, 1972), pp. 2 f.</page><page sequence="24">78 ROLF GRUNER oration on the dignity of man in which God announces to Adam that he had given him no fixed task, status, or position but that Adam had to determine all these for himself.1 Since then the view of man as a being without a specific or predetermined nature has, in one form or other, always been with us. Man has no essence but only existence ; he has no nature but only history, and this history he makes himself: slogans of this kind are only too familiar. In the end they always lead to an activist, voluntaristic conception. If the stable, immutable element called 'human nature' is nonexistent, then what people do, feel, or think, individually or collectively, is exclusively dependent on contingent factors—physical, biological, social, and the rest, it does not really matter. What matters is that contingent factors are changeable, and that (at least in principle) they can be changed by man. Man, in short, can transform or reconstruct himself at will ; if he wants to, he can become a 'new man'. That this is the idea which underlies Marxism is obvious. That it is also the idea underlying any other major Weltanschauung of our time is perhaps less obvious but nevertheless true. It is only that in Marxism it has been spelt out, systematized, and universalized as in no other case. The fundamental paradox, however, is not removed by the idea of self-determination. It is only expressed in a different way. For the idea that man determines and hence manipulates himself is inconsistent, and saying that he is his own maker and moulder is in the end not saying something comprehensible. VII It may seem that I have digressed from my original topic, the criticism of a view on the relationship between modern science and the Christian religion. But digression is more apparent than real. For the belief that nature exists for the sake of man is logically connected with, and perhaps indistinguishable from, the belief that the objects of nature have no intrinsic but only instrumental value, and as I have indicated before, this is a belief that is inherent in and essential to modern science. So far, therefore, as there exists a clear line of development that connects the Christian doctrine of imago Dei with this instrumental and anthro pocentric view of nature, so far there is also a historical connection between Christianity and science, in particular since the doctrine in question belongs to the very core of the Christian faith. But if that is my view, does it not amount to a qualified approval of revisionism? For having rejected the thesis that the biblical statement 1 G. Pico délia Mirandola, La Oignit à dell'Uomo, ed. F. S. Pignagnoli (Bologna, 1969), p. 76.</page><page sequence="25">SCIENCE, NATURE, AND CHRISTIANITY 79 about man's dominion can in fairness be used as a religious justification of the enterprise of modern science, have I not then shown myself that because of another such statement—'man has been created in the image of God'—such a justification is possible after all, even if I do not share the revisionist's view that this reflects favourably on his religion ? In short, have I not merely changed the revisionist's approval into disapproval and come out with a view not essentially different from that of a con temporary author in whose opinion 'the fact that modern emancipated man, by means of his scientific technology, now makes everything that he is able to make, and does not imitate nature but overpowers it, has still its last and deepest ground in the model of that God whose creative will has made the world for the sake of man' ?' My answer to these questions is in the negative, and I had better explain why. There are two points involved, and the first is this. If, in analogy to traditional historical periodization, we speak of a development from the classical outlook to the Christian and from the Christian to the modern (which, if I am right, can be characterized also as a movement from a cosmocentric via a theocentric to an anthropocentric point of view), the revisionist conceives the second to be almost identical with the third. At least, he believes that the Christian and the modern have much more, and much more essential things in common than the classical and the Christian consciousness. But this is to overlook several important factors, for instance, the factor of contemplation as against action of which I have spoken before. It is, however, also to overlook the most fundamental point of all, namely that the classical and the Christian stance were both religious whereas the modern is not. For ancient and medieval men even a relatively simple object, such as a bridge or a field of corn, and a relatively simple activity, such as building a bridge or sowing a field, had religious significance. They have no such significance today, and as far as human consciousness is concerned, this is a difference of such a magnitude that all other things become relatively unimportant. My second point is more involved. What is at issue here is also the proper conception of historical development. I do not believe that one can ascribe responsibility to, and hence can praise or blame, a past philosophy or religion for the conclusions that people afterwards have drawn from it. To take a simple example, Hitler and his men were very fond of praising thinkers like Hegel and Nietzsche as their spiritual ancestors, and the Nazi's opponents were equally prone to blame them for the same reason and to hold them in some measure responsible for the terrible things that happened in Germany and Europe between 1933 1 Κ.

But this will not do. Hegel, to consider him alone, was no Nazi, nor were his ideas Nazi ideas. It was only that some people long after his death used his philosophy as a quarry from which they took what suited their books, ignoring the context and forgetting the rest. That they did so was not the fault of Hegel or his system. Of course, his ideas have to be evaluated, and criticized, and one might find them acceptable or unacceptable morally or otherwise. But if they are to be blamed or praised, they must be blamed or praised in their own right, unaffected by the question to what use they were put by other people later on, Marx or Hitler or whoever. Hegel can only answer for himself. To believe otherwise is to subscribe to the thesis that history follows some kind of necessary development, has an 'inner logic', as it were, such that if one man says Ά' at one time, his successors are bound to say 'B' at a later time, i.e., that one view or one idea generates inevitably, out of itself, the next view or next idea in the historical series. (The fact that I have used Hegel as my example is ironical, for it was just he who was the chief promoter of the view I am now attacking.) No doubt, there are connections between events, ideas, states of affairs in history, but they are not of this kind. If there had been no battle of Waterloo, then most probably there would have been no battle of Stalingrad. This does not mean that once the battle of Waterloo had been fought, the battle of Stalingrad was bound to be fought too, or that Napoleon and Wellington were in some way responsible for what happened in Russia more than a century later. Similarly, it is possible and perhaps probable that without Hegel and the Hegelian system there would have been no Hitlerite ideology. But again it does not follow that, given the first, the second was inevitable or even likely. The history of ideas is not like a long drawn-out inference, a continuous historical process where people's views are constantly formed like logical conclusions drawn from the views of their predecessors. The relevance of these remarks to our topic should be obvious. The revisionists wish to say that modern science is somehow to be seen as the logical outcome of Christian belief. Their view is based to a good deal on the fact that the early promoters and practitioners of science, men like Bacon, Kepler, and Newton, were inclined to give their science a religious interpretation and justification. But this means no more than that they conceived of Christianity in a way such that they could feel their aims and activities to be sanctioned by it, a point of no little importance at a time when religion was still a force in men's lives. Their interpretation was one-sided; they emphasized what suited their pur pose and played down what did not (which, I should think, is not at all an uncommon procedure).</page><page sequence="27">SCIENCE, NATURE, AND CHRISTIANITY 81 I do not wish to deny, of course, that there is continuity, a transition from the medieval to the modern mind and so also to modern science. Many concepts were slowly transformed ; emphasis gradually changed ; old aims were by and by replaced by new ones. It is, therefore, not absolutely wrong to say that modern science has developed from, or grown out of Christianity, as so many other things have grown out of it. But saying this is at best a very shorthand description of a very complex historical event, and the description is outright false if the matter is conceived on a biological or logical analogy. Science did not grow out of this religion as an oak tree grows out of an acorn. For there is nothing natural, predestined, logical about historical development. There is no inner logic by which, given something called 'Christianity' something else called 'modern science' could not but come to pass, given even that a set of 'normal conditions' (comparable to warmth, humidity, etc., in the case of the acorn) are satisfied. The most that can be admitted is that if there had been no such religion, there probably would have been no modern science, and this is saying only something very trivial, especially since it can be said of so many other things apart from Christianity. All this means that one cannot in any meaningful way either praise or blame the Christian faith for science. To try to make capital for religion out of the fact that without it there would have been no science, is like trying to show that a man's serious accident was a good thing because without it he would not have met his future wife, a nurse in the hospital. One can praise or blame this religion only for what it is, and assuming what it is is determined by its basic doctrines, one can praise or blame it for these. Perhaps the doctrine that man, and man alone, was created in God's image has to be criticized, but this criticism should be pursued in independence of the question as to what people, after the doctrine had existed for some time, have made of it. They have made of it the view that nature exists, or can be treated as if existed, for man's sake, a view which in the opinion of at least some people is pernicious. But as far as I can see, it forms no part of Christianity, nor is it logically equivalent to the doctrine of imago Dei, and it seems that it took more than a millennium before somebody came out with it. I cannot, therefore, blame or praise this religion for something that does not belong to it. And this, in the end, means also that I cannot blame or praise it for science.
