<plain_text><page sequence="1">AGNES MONGAN European Landscape Drawing 1400-1900: A Brief Survey We are all aware that since the turn of this century we have wit nessed and are still witnessing a profound shift in artistic aims, values and meaning. Nowhere has the change been clearer than in the visual arts?and in the visual arts nowhere more intimately re vealing than in drawing, that succinct, immediate, informal visual language which, as more than one writer has noted, is as attuned as a seismograph to every breath of innovation, every slight change of emphasis, every faint echo of discovery. These revelatory qualities are true not only of contemporary drawing. They have existed since pen or chalk or pencil began to mark the surface of parchment or paper, that is since the late Middle Ages. (Ancient drawings on the more resisting surfaces of stone or clay, although often superb works of art, have not the informal, experimental often ephemeral charac ter of hnes on paper. ) The number of Daedalus devoted to The Visual Arts Today (Winter 1960) pinpointed the present position of the arts. The fore word to that number noted that the arts "help define the features of our time. They carry indications of our past and also of our future." A startling section which followed was entitled "The New Land scape," a selection made from Gyorgy Kepes' brilliant book of the same title. Possibly a brief and, of necessity superficial, backward glance at the old landscape as recorded in the drawings on paper or parch ment by the sensitive and disciphned hands of gifted artists will throw some hght on the road that has led to our present position. An artist's depiction of the world in which he moves and has his being almost always tells more about him and his epoch than he suspects. One needs the perspective of time to see just how much. We have such a long perspective on the opening of an era, about 1400, whose 581</page><page sequence="2">AGNES MONGAN close, roughly in the first decade of this century, we are now begin ning also to see with a certain clarity. With the memory of hundreds of landscape paintings, drawings and prints in our mind's eye, and with the ever present camera ready to record any desired view, it is hard for us to grasp the fact that from antiquity to the late Middle Ages man paid little heed to the scenic quahties of the world about him. Even such a celebrated pre cursor of the change that was to take place as Petrarch, the first man known to have climbed a mountain for the pure pleasure of the view, was, as Sir Kenneth Clark points out in his Landscape Paint ing, quickly reminded by St. Augustine, whose Confessions he held in his hand, of the vanity of all things except the contemplation of the soul. Turning his back upon the grand sweep of Alps, Bhone and the Mediterranean, the panoramic view which had stirred him to enthusiasm, he descended the mountain in thoughtful silence. Gardens, walled and lovingly tended, were safer places than mountains. As the Benaissance world took shape, they became proper subjects, not only for poets, but also for painters. But charm ingly as they were depicted, it can hardly be said that any indi vidual garden had its portrait painted. A drawn or painted garden was highly stylized and had a symbolic meaning. A drawing of a landscape or a garden, existing as an end in itself, was still incon ceivable in the 14th century. Mountains, indeed any landscapes, were depicted only to serve as settings for the dramatis personae. Their features were sche matized or generalized. In comparison, man, who always occupied the foreground, was of majestic and dominating proportion, often as tall as the tree or building near which he stood. As for mountains, the traditional?and an ancient tradition it was ?way to depict them continued long after Petrarch's climb. Cennino Cennini who was born near Florence about 1370, that is about four years before Petrarch died, gave instruction in his libro dell'arte about the correct way to depict mountains: "If you wish to acquire a good style for mountains and to have them look natural, get some large stones which should be rough and not cleaned, and copy them from nature, applying the lights and darks as your system requires." Mountains, or the symbols for mountains?it amounted to the same thing?of the kind Cennino advocates are familiar to us in the back grounds of late 14th and early 15th century paintings. Sometimes their structure varies a little and they have fantastic peaks, like the points of a meringue and about as substantial, or they resemble soft 582</page><page sequence="3">European Landscape Drawing httle heaps of sand. Behind the figures, the land rises sharply up to ward the top of the page, leaving only a small area for the narrow, empty sky and giving no suggestion of the existence of any further space beyond the hmits of the page. A rare and fine example of this early landscape style is seen in one of the earhest surviving drawings of northern Europe "The Adoration of the Magi" (Figure 1; Dahlem Print Boom, Berlin).* It is a smaU 5f X 4| in. drawing, in pen and ink on parchment, made about 1410 by an artist in the circle of the van Eycks; some noted critics think possibly by Jan van Eyck him self (1390-1440). Bather than the exact representation of a specific locale, the drawing is, in a sense, hke a map, indicating through ac cepted symbols that the dramatic event delineated took place in an open, hilly countryside. By the mid-15th century, some paintings, several miniatures and a few drawings began to reveal the birth of a new concept of space, of a space that was open and deep and encompassed by air and hght, a space in which both men and mountains had precise positions and proportions depending on that position. Benozzo Gozzoli's httle pen drawing of "St. Augustine with a Toothache" (Figure 2; Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, Mass.), drawn about 1460-63, still has the mountains that resemble httle heaps of sand and a high skyline sharply dehmiting the area, but Benozzo's figures have volume and begin to take their places in space. Still we would not be sure quite what that space was if the drawing lacked the revealing inscription across its lower edge "How St. Augustine seated under a fig-tree in a garden suddenly felt such a severe toothache that he was unable to speak." Garden and fig-tree need the written words in order for us to interpret the symbols. The informal narrative subject matter is also, of course, indicative of the winds of change. It was scarcely a decade later that a youthful genius broke the mould. Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) made the first pure land scape drawing that we know in Western art. (Figure 3; Uffizi, Flor ence.) It was the first of many that he was to draw. Like Petrarch, he too had chmbed a mountain to survey the view. He records rocks * With the exception of the Leonardo da Vinci, the Besan?on Fragonard and Mr. Thacher's C?zanne, all the drawings referred to in this article have been on exhibition in the United States within the past decade, shown either in the extraordinarily fine series of Drawing Exhibitions lent from great European Col lections and circulated by the Smithsonian Institution, or in special exhibitions at the Pierpont Morgan Library, New York, and the Fogg Art Museum, Cam bridge. The drawings from Chatsworth were lent by the Duke of Devonshire and are reproduced by permission of the Trustees of the Chatsworth Setdement. 583</page><page sequence="4">AGNES MONGAN and mountains and the distant sea, but the rocks are faceted and bear no relation to those Cennino recommended. Each airving bill has its own individuahty and, like the castles ornamenting the hill tops, its proper proportion. As one looks down the level valley to the distance, the hills grow lower not higher, and there is space above them. As for the trees and shrubs in the foreground, the rapid, nerv ous, parallel curving lines not only give them a suggestion of vibrant form, but seem to cause them to tremble in the heat of the summer day. The twenty-one year old, left-handed artist must have taken a certain satisfaction in his performance, for in his matchless mirror writing he wrote at the upper left both the Feast Day and its date: "di di Sta Maria della Neve, addl 5 Aghosto 1473." In his maturity he made panoramic views of the Alps in red chalk or sanguine, the first time that medium was used on paper, and wrote his treatise on landscape, again the first discussion of the subject in the Western World. Leonardo's fresh outlook and inquiring mind did not immedi ately banish convention. For less forward-looking men, custom held nature in its grip awhile longer. It obviously dictated the set tings for the two works we shall next consider. Of widely different geographical origin, they are curiously similar in several ways. Their similarities suggest that in some pictorial concepts, Europe was still a whole. Fouquet/s immature of "Cesar Crossing the Rubicon" and Carpaccio's "Official Receiving an Ambassador" have astonisliing likenesses of setting and viewpoint. Let us go back a bit in time. The learned and gifted humanist, Leon Battista Alberti, following his investigation of the laws of per spective, had written instructions telling the manner in which one could depict three-dimensional space. The Italian edition of his Treatise on Painting appeared in 1436. Painters, sculptors and archi tects of Tuscany and Central Italy were stirred and inspired by his reasoning. The Touraine artist, Jean Fouquet, (ca. 1425-1481) who journeyed to Rome to paint the portrait of Eugenius IV became aware during his journey of this new way to view and to represent the world. Alberti, in the year in which his Treatise was pubhshed, went to Bologna in the retinue of Eugenius, but Fouquet probably met him in Rome where he moved in the papal circle. When com missioned, after his return to France in 1448, to supply some illus trations for an Histoire Ancienne jusqu'? C?sar et Faits des Romans, Fouquet displayed his new knowledge of space and atmosphere in the setting he gave to Caesar and his legions. Caesar s army, dressed 584</page><page sequence="5">European Landscape Drawing in 15th century armor, is massed in the left foreground at the river s edge, as Fame trumpets their imminent crossing. It is the landscape, however, not the army or its leader, which dominates the scene (Figure 4; Jean Fouquet, "The Crossing of the Rubicon," Louvre, Paris). The luminosity and airiness of this rniniature are marvelously effective, even if its perspective is still somewhat steep and its figures follow the old rules in their scale. The river winding into the back ground, the mountains gradually losing their sharp clarity as they fade into the distance, the trees diminishing in size the farther away they are, the clarity of the atmosphere: all this proclaims the artist's acute awareness of air and hght occupying a given area of three-di mensional space. About the turn of the century in Venice, Carpaccio (active 1486 1522/27), when confronted with a problem similar to Fouquet's? figures pausing on a ceremonial occasion?sought a similar solution. (Figure 5; Vittore Carpaccio, "Unidentified Scene," Chatsworth.) It is not known what the precise incident depicted is, but once again the scene is dominated by the landscape setting: a broad river, winding into the distance, mountains of diminishing scale, trees spaced hke sentinels at given degrees of distance one from another. Carpaccio, working with only red chalk and pen and brown ink, could not call upon variations of tone as Fouquet had done in his miniature, to add depth to his skies. The possibilities of wash were still to be discovered. And yet there is some suggestion of that qual ity that seems the birthright of all Venetian artists, a capacity to evoke upon a page, often with almost no means, a transparent, en veloping atmosphere. In Venice, at least ten years before Carpaccio died, there ap peared a young artist who was among the very first Italian artists to make landscape drawings as ends in themselves, as finished works of art. Like Leonardo, he loved rocky promontories, dense trees and turreted castles, but he lacked the Florentine logic and precision, and he was not yet clear about perspective. (Figure 6; Domenico Campagnola, "Buildings in a Bocky Landscape," Pierpont Morgan Library, New York.) Domenico Campagnola (1500-post 1552) at tempts to suggest space by drawing a rather rolling landscape in which the light and dark edges of the land's contours alternate with each other into the distance. Although there is hght and shadow, there is no real depth or air. Another drawing by Campagnola ex hibits these same characteristics, but it adds figures of enigmatic significance. (Figure 7; Domenico Campagnola, "Four Infants, One 585</page><page sequence="6">AGNES MONGAN Winged, in Front of a Town; An Eagle above Them," Chatsworth; see reprod.) Turrets, towers and battlements dominate the whole background, and slender nude figures of mysterious mean ing gather at the river's edge in the left middle distance. In the right foreground, a group of putti, one winged and standing, and two seated on a recumbent ram, cower beneath a bat-winged dragon or demon. At first glance, the buildings like those in the Morgan Library drawing, seem to have solidity and massiveness, but on close examination their structure is uncertain, their foundations un defined, their volume undescribed. The flying demon must surely have escaped from some Teutonic cave; in conception and in intent, he is a most un-Italianate crea ture. One recalls the legend that Campagnola, Titian's contemporary and occasional assistant, was himself of Germanic origin, if Venetian in education and citizenship. Italian devils and dragons are more sohdly corporeal. They need to be in order to survive in the bright sunlight and warmth of Italy. Witches and winged demons have their haunts more naturally in northern forests, where trees drip moss from their spiny branches, where deep shadows suggest secret caverns, and strange shapes hint at weird rites. It is a commonplace that the landscape of fantasy had its home in the regions north and northeast of the Alps. The graphic artists of those hilly areas have never been sur passed in wild and wonderful imaginings. Their drawings made in the first third of the 16th century, generally in pen on colored paper heightened with white, are like fairy tales. Naturalistic detail merges with marvels of the supernatural. AU of nature appears anthropomorphic, every rock and tree about to be transformed into some breathing, twisting creature. Altdorfer of Regensburg was a master of this calligraphic, imaginative style. Nature is depicted as a mystic force (Figure 8; Altdorfer, "Landscape with Tall Spruce," Kupferstichkabinett, Dahlem, Berlin). In the same years that Cam pagnola was working in Venice, Altdorfer (1450P-1538) was work ing in the Danube Valley. A far greater distance, however, hes be tween these two than between Fouquet and Carpaccio. The great spruce in the foreground of Altdorfer's watercolor drawing has al most the character of Jack's Beanstalk. It dominates and divides the drawing: its roots reach into the foreground; its top is invisible in the sky; its moss-hung branches seem sharply incisive, about to close hke vises. The woodcutter is a pigmy beneath the immense tree. The 586</page><page sequence="7">European Landscape Drawing crumbhng houses look like the homes of elves. Nothing in the draw ing is still or at rest. Wolf Huber ( 1485-1553) of Passau drew somewhat similar land scapes marked with a kindred romantic, imaginative sensibility. His line has a wiry liveliness, as though carrying an electric charge of its own. In the space of a modest page he can encompass a great sweep of mountains and valleys. (Figure 9; Wolf Huber, "View of Feld kirch," Staatliche Graphische Sammlung, Munich.) Suddenly his rhythm will change and, beneath the towering trees and the splen did rays of a setting sun spangling the sky, there will be, in minute detail, a tiny village, a castle, a bridge or a farm. Albertfs ideas of perspective and proportion have no entry here. Always the marvels of nature dominate and dwarf the hfe and constructions of man. Huber's view of his own town of Feldkirch in its mountain setting is one of the most memorable of the drawn landscapes in which small fact is married with bold fancy. A few years after these Danube and Venetian artists looked at their own surroundings, a northerner traveling in Italy serenely solved all problems of hght, air and distance, proportion and per spective. In his compositions, he combined a northerner's love of detail with an Italian breadth of vision. Standing at the foot of the Aventine Hill, Pieter Brueghel (1525-1569), one day in 1552, looked across the Tiber to the Ripa Grande, Rome's ancient port, and re corded what he saw. (Figure 10; Pieter Brueghel the Elder, "View of The Ripa Grande," Rome, Chatsworth.) A variety of ships, their sails furled, were moored at the foot of the harbor stairs. Up those stairs small figures made their way to the Customs Office at their head. On the far bank a peasant, pulling the lead of his heavily-laden donkey, trudged up the path. The 9th century Leonine tower was high in the clear air. At the right, the Janiculum was still an open hillside. In the foreground, faceless peasants huddled in small boats, were rowing across the Tiber, as a dog barked excitedly from the river's edge; and a peasant filled a bucket with water as his donkey waded behind him. Over all, played the magical golden hght and pale transparent shadow of Rome. Two birds flew across the sky. Just above them the artist wrote "A Rypa." There was to be no mistaking the exact spot. It would be hard to find a document?or a lyric?which would tell more of the simple external daily life of the Eternal City in the mid-16th century or give a clearer account of the Northerner's in tense pleasure at being a witness to what was before his eyes. In that Latin atmosphere, Brueghel was moved to create a composition 587</page><page sequence="8">AGNES MONGAN which, in spite of its many anecdotal details, has an extraordinary unity and emphasis. In the very year that Brueghel made this drawing, Michelangelo, working nearby around the bend of the same river at the right, had recently completed his decoration of the Pauline Chapel. With his austere and magnificent conception of man's destiny, Michelangelo would have found httle to admire in Brueghel's drawing. All land scape to him was an unworthy distraction. Flemish landscape he would not call true art. Francesco de Hollanda, who was in Rome in 1538, quotes him in a famous passage: "Their painting (that of Flanders) is of stuffs, bricks and mortar, the grass of the field, the shadows of trees, and bridges and rivers, which they call landscapes and little figures here and there; and all this, although it may appear good to some eyes, is in truth done without reasonableness or art, without symmetry or proportion, without care in selection or reject ing. . . ." Only Itahan painting could meet Michelangelo's standard. One wonders how he would have judged the drawing of those Bolognese artists who, working in Rome at the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th century, changed the course of Italian art with their painted decoration of the Farnese Palace. If their pro claimed aim was to unite the drawing of Raphael and Michelangelo with the color of the Venetians, they had little to fall back on when landscape was wanted. In his drawings, Raphael's landscape was brilliantly stylized in lines of stenographic brevity. Michelangelo's was non-existent. Happily the Carracci had sharp, observant eyes for the physical world, as well as well-disciplined hands. In a drawing attributed to Agostino Carracci ( 1557-1602), the artist seems to have placed himself in the very midst of a leafy wood and looked beyond the dense and vibrant foliage to the domes and towers of the distant horizon (Figure 11; Attributed to Agostino Carracci, "Study of Trees with a Glimpse of Distant Buildings on the Right," Chatsworth). Long before the Impressionists of the 19th century, he knew that by drawing these distant buildings with short, broken or incomplete lines he would achieve the impression of the vibrant hght and air. The great puffs of summer clouds above the tower, and the hght and shadow playing over the foreground fohage, suggesting the rustling of leaves, give precise indications of both a summer season and a sunny day. Before the opening of the 17th century, no artist showed in his drawings either a particular season or a precise hour (Huber's setting sun somehow gave httle suggestion of approaching twilight. Its function was dramatic and spectacular rather than horological. 588</page><page sequence="9">European Landscape Drawing We know the season of Leonardo's drawing from its inscription, and we can guess that of Brueghel's Roman landscape from the peasants' heavy clothing). Agostino's younger and more gifted brother, Annibale (1560 1609), in his landscape drawings simplified and stylized even further in pliant pen hnes. In a drawing probably connected, at least in its time of origin, with the Farnese Palace decoration of the first decade of the 17th century, he too, but with an even greater economy of means, depicts a hot, nearly windless, humid summer day with damp pervasive sunlight eating the shadows even of the quiet water's reflections. (Figure 12; Annibale Carracci, "Landscape: Scene on a Canal," Chatsworth.) A faint horizon line, where sky and water meet, suggest infinite space beyond. It is a drawing which seems to foretell what the Venetians would do with water and hght reflec tions a century and a half later. The Carracci's fellow citizen and follower, Guercino ( 1591-1666), was less poetical and more practical in temperament than they were. He made hundreds of landscape drawings (and his forgers have more than quadrupled Guercino's own production) using a quill pen and a reddish brown ink of distinctive color. The acid content of that ink has often eaten through the paper. His landscapes are almost always composed in a diagonal composition which moves from lower left inward to upper right. They are always slightly tilted. In fact, they give the impression, because they are curiously insubstantial, that they might easily liquify; then the melting scene would be funneled off from the lower left corner. In his drawing, Guercino shows an unflagging love of the pic turesque. Unhke the Germans and Netherlanders, his picturesque ness is not that of fantasy and imagination, of nightmares and in cantations. Rather it is that of past history: broken antique columns, crumbling crenelated round towers, elaborately dressed anonymous cavaliers* trees and shrubs bent into strange shapes by the wind. Generally he is not moved by the seasons, nor is he affected by the time of day. A steady hght with an occasional high wind is his unfail ing choice. With his objective eye, however, he can be an accurate and anecdotal reporter. On at least one occasion he proved himself not only sharply observant but vastly entertaining. (Figure 13; Guercino, "Landscape: A River in Flood and Peasants with Axes and Other Tools," Chatsworth.) It is as though he had moved his con temporary television camera up close in order to record what hap pened one day, early in the 17th century, when the land flooded. 589</page><page sequence="10">AGNES MONGAN Rushing waters sweep across the foreground. In the left middle distance, peasants armed with picks, forks, spades and long hooks advance to work on the levees. In the middle distance, a ladder is abandoned against a tree as the water rises. The nearby farm house is half under water. Its occupants are signalhng for help from its tiled roof. In the distance a long line of peasants, each one with his hook or pick, is advancing to take his place in the battle against the rising river. At a quick glance, the drawing might seem no more than a river scene with a tall tree and some shrubs. It is only when one begins to "read it" carefully that its reportorial character be comes evident. It is precisely in this character that it is not only picturesque but new and unusual. Not only does it record the forces of nature. It pictures man puny in scale, pitting himself against natural forces in a battle he hopes and expects to win. Another northerner voyaging in Italy had a different point of view. He seems always to have been aware of the forces of nature, in fact so conscious of them that one wonders if in his stay at Mantua or on his way down the Peninsula, he heard discussed some new ideas about the dependence of motion on force. Surely few artists have been more aware of all aspects of life and thought than Rubens (1577-1640), or more deeply cultivated, in the very best sense of that term. He was fluent in several languages, widely read in ancient and contemporary literature. In Rome, in the opening decade of the 17th century, he absorbed history and archaeology. He learned the rules of open and secret diplomacy. During his travels, his chalk and pen were always with him, copying paintings and sculptures, noting details of architecture. It is clear that he saw and was influenced by the drawings of the Carracci, in fact so strongly influenced that more than once it has been disputed whether a drawing was made by Rubens or Annibale Carracci. Possibly this was a natural confusion since many Carracci drawings were copied even as they came from the artist's hand. Rubens returned from Italy to his native Flanders, a mature Baroque artist, with an enlarged vision of the world. Nothing shows the energy and complexity of his vital talent more clearly than a study he made of "A Tree-Trunk with Brambles" (Figure 14; Chatsworth). In the lower right, the drawing bears the inscription "afgavellen bladein ende ofs sommighe plaetsen Schoon gruen grase dem kyken" (fallen leaves and in some places green grasses peep through). If, as Dr. Juhus Held beheves, the handwriting is too crude to be Rubens' own (although it has often been so described), 590</page><page sequence="11">European Landscape Drawing it must repeat what he had written, perhaps along the now-cropped lower edge. A warped and knotted tree-trunk, with bursts of jab bing crooked branches thrusts its height diagonally through a tangle of underbrush. The tensile, hindering vines have been unable to pull down the twisted tree. The drawing was first sketched in chalk, then in ink with bistre wash and a few tones of color added. Clearly, this particular bit of evidence of the forces of nature had deeply moved Rubens. He returned to it not only in another drawing but to use it as a part of the background of his painting of ca. 1616-20, "The Boar Hunt" (Dresden). To contrast this tangle with its thrust and pull, with the still perfection and clarity of D?rer's "Large Clump of Turf" is to see how the view of the world had changed in a hundred years. How far it had come, too, in the two centuries since Cennino's advice on how to draw mountains! Rubens who loved and walked often in his own countryside had examined and actually known and observed the tree and thicket? and used his knowledge of it later in a finished composition. Rubens' pupil, Van Dyck (1599-1641), when he reached Eng land, carried matters a step further. Van Dyck's view of the "Ypres Tower at Rye" (Figure 15; Fitzwilham Museum, Cambridge, England), which we know he visited in the summer of 1623, reveals in its precise and controlled pen line his technical inheritance from Brueghel. His habit of seeing is similar, too, but there is a billowing in the land and a movement in the sky quite unlike Brueghel's quiet construction. Once Van Dyck had ventured beyond the shoreline into the cool, silvery light of England, he was inspired to do, with brush and watercolor, a remarkable series of landscape drawings that are very different from his pen drawings, freer, bolder, larger. The surge of the hills, the long and deep shadows which play over them, the clouds scudding across the sky are seen with the foreign er's fresh dehghted eye. The pale yellow, soft greens and hght trans parent blues of these watercolors (Figures 16 and 17; Chatsworth) are new in Van Dyck's work. Just as England's hght had been a revelation to Van Dyck, the watercolors that he made were a revelation to English artists and collectors. A competence in drawing (not painting) was part of the cultural equipment of the "compleat gentieman" of the time. Out of the Englishman's admiration and emulation of such landscape drawings as these by Van Dyck, the flourishing English watercolor school was to develop. Van Dyck's watercolor landscapes have httle to do with topogra 591</page><page sequence="12">AGNES MONGAN phy. The 17th century had its gifted artists, however, in that rather dry category. When Henry Howard, Earl of Arundel, that fascinat ing figure who was a patron of both Bubens and Van Dyck, made a trip up the Rhine in 1636, he took along as his official artist the Bohemian, Wenceslaus Hollar (1607-1677). Hollar's duty was to make a graphic record of the journey. Many of his drawings survive. Two offer precise profiles of at least two of the cities visited, Frank furt-am-Main and the town of Engers. The ducal party passed the latter on April 30. (Figure 18; Chatsworth.) Apparently their ban nered barge was greeted with a fine salvo from the castle's round tower. From May 5th to 7th they stopped at Frankfurt, (Figure 19; Chatsworth) long enough for Hollar to gain an exact idea of the lay of the land, the course of the river and the variety of steeples and towers. Stiff and a little dry, these drawings yet have charm because of their precision, their careful balance, their dehcacy of tone and line, their unpretentious honesty. As works of art, however, they are not to be compared either to the drawings of the two great Flemings or to the incomparable landscape drawings of Hollar's exact contem porary Rembrandt ( 1606-1699), the greatest landscape draughtsman of them all. The two great Flemings and the supreme Dutchman were near contemporaries in time and not far removed from each other in miles, but they were profoundly different in their reactions to the world around them. These differences are instantly and graphically visible in their landscape drawings. Rubens and Rembrandt each walked in his own beloved countryside, making notations of what he saw, but their eyes were drawn to different sights and their imaginations stirred by different stimuli. For Rubens all of nature had a pulsating vitality. For him every hving tree, branch or vine was nourished by an elixir of life which gave it growth and energy. This springing strength he captured in every sketch or study. Rembrandt, who made few detailed sketches of isolated objects, saw a more unified world with a different rhythm. He preferred to regard the Dutch landscape in quiet contemplation, carefully composing scenes of rural tranquillity. His horizons are low, level and distant. Under immense, humid skies, luminous and still, not agitated or stormy, he quiet fields bounded by peaceful, reflecting rivers or narrow canals. Cattle ruminate in the fields, and ducks glide upon the tranquil waters. Behind worn and tilted palings, the simple thatched cottages are shaded by clumps of sheltering trees. In his drawings even the great wings of the accenting windm?ls are motionless. Only 592</page><page sequence="13">European Landscape Drawing the air vibrates. Kenneth Clark has noted that "Throughout history the landscape of perception has been small." At present, there are nine landscape drawings by Bembrandt from Chatsworth on exhibi tion in this country. Each is a small masterpiece. Only one, and that by only a few fractions of an inch, is larger than 6 X 10 inches. Yet each seems to encompass not only a vast space but, in its infinite skill and penetrating perception, to show a profound understanding of the phenomena of nature, and more, to give evidence of a spirit serenely at one with his subject. All nine were drawn in the early sixteen-fifties. Rembrandt was then at the height of his artistic powers, if already past the peak of his popular favor. His mother and father, Saskia, his son Rumbartus and Saskia's daughter Cornelia, had all died. His worldly affairs were going badly (he was declared bankrupt in 1656). But these very years are the years of his most accomplished, expressive land scape drawings. Sunlit, with limpid shadows, they show both quiet foreground and still distances. Whether of familiar woodland paths (Figure 20; Rembrandt, "Road Leading through a Wood," Chats worth) or river views (Figure 21; Rembrandt, "A Farmstead by a Stream," Chatsworth; and (Figure 22; Rembrandt, "View on the Amstel at Omval: on the Left The Ringvaart of the Diemermeer," Chatsworth), they are of exquisite deftness and a deeply moving magic. Many Dutch artists of the 17th century made landscape drawings of the familiar and much-beloved countryside, but none could rival either Rembrandt's comprehensive yet unpretentious understanding or his power of synthesis. It was not only the Dutch who loved these quiet scenes. They had and continue to have a universal appeal. They have always found particular favor with the French.When Samuel Sorbiere, the courtier, skeptic and gossip, went to visit Descartes, who during the sixteen-forties was hving in a charming house outside of Leyden, he wrote: "He lived in a small chateau, beautifully situated, near a great and fine university (Leyden), three leagues from the court and hardly two hours from the sea. He had ... a nice garden with an orchard beyond it; and all around there were pastures from which stood out many steeples of various heights, until in the far horizon they appeared as mere points. He could go in a day by canal to Utrecht, Delft, Rotterdam, Dordrecht, Haarlem or Amsterdam. He could spend half his day at The Hague, and return in the evening, making his excursion by the most beautiful road in the world, 593</page><page sequence="14">AGNES MONGAN through meadows ... and then through a great wood bordering this village, which is not inferior to the fairest town in Europe." But neither on this road, which many well-traveled Dutch still find the most beautiful in the world, nor in any of the cities mentioned did Descartes and Rembrandt apparently meet. It is unlikely that they would have found each other sympathetic had they chanced to, so fundamentally different were their temperaments, interests and points of view. The simple, modest scenes beloved by the Netherlanders are the very antitheses of those favored, in the very same years, by the two great French artists resident in Rome in the 17th century: Claude Lorrain (1600-1682) and Nicolas Poussin (1594-1665). They, too, walked by rivers and in the countryside, but the rivers were the Tiber and its tributaries, and the countryside, the Roman Campagna. Rather than a quiet simplicity, they were seeking themes of nobility and grandeur. In their large drawings they give us broad, sweeping vistas of mountain ranges; curving, gleaming rivers, and great masses of noble trees. In their near views there are ancient ruins or shadowed shrubs or complexes of tree trunks. Poussin gradually put behind him, as he grew in technical surety, the linear language of his youth. The brush supplanted the pen, a brush used with a control and a dexterity that a Chinese calhgrapher would not scorn. In the application of a single wash he could vary the tone from a beautiful transparency to a rich darkness. To those who know only his classically composed and highly intellectual paintings, the play of brilliant sun and trembling shadow, the effects of wind and air that he captures in his drawings must come as a revelation (Figure 23; Nicolas Poussin, "Landscape," Louvre, Paris). Details are not delineated. It is the shifting value of light and shadow, playing against each other in intricate sparkling rhythms, that forms the subject matter of many drawings. Seen at first glance his group of "Trees on a Plain" (Figure 24; Nicolas Poussin, "Trees on a Plain," Louvre, Paris), might seem spiritually nearer 19th century Impressionism than the formal clas sicism of the 17th century. A second and third look will reveal a largeness of conception and a spaciousness of outlook that the 19th century rarely achieved. Claude, the younger of the two, who seems the older because he lived the longer, was temperamentally different from Poussin, less intellectual, less commanding in presence, simpler in education and in manner of life. Indeed all this is suggested by the fact that Claude 594</page><page sequence="15">European Landscape Drawing since his own day has generally been referred to by his first name, Poussin always by his last. But it is Claude rather than Poussin who summons up a vision of a lost Arcadian world, where shepherds pipe in a golden twilight and nymphs dance in charmed circles. He knew every mile of the Campagna, Tivoli and the Alban Hills, the Tiber and its bridges. In his long solitary life he drew them over and over, sometimes using only pen on a pale blue paper, adding his high lights in Chinese white, more often using a white paper and pen, and adding washes that vary from a pale blonde tone to a rich brownish-black. (Figure 25; Claude Lorrain, "Landscape with Cattle," the Cleveland Museum of Art, Gift of Mr. and Mrs. Edward B. Greene.) In many of his landscape drawings the foreground, broadly sketched, hes in full or partial shadow. It is the middle distance which catches the fuU sunlight and the features of major interest. In the distance are hills and valleys. Shepherds and their flocks lend a quiet animation to the scene, but the wind gently moving the great masses of f ohage in the trees which soar above the houses and tower of the village in the middle ground lends it more hfe. (Figure 26; Claude Lorrain, "The Banks of the Arrio," Louvre, Paris. ) There is an exalted harmony in these noble landscape draw ings. In actual size Claude's drawings are not much larger than Rem brandt's, but they seem larger because of what they represent and the sentiment they express. A century later, two other French artists were in Rome. They, too, went out to sketch in the Campagna and stayed at Tivoh: Honor? Fragonard (1731-1806) and Hubert Robert (1733-1808). Whether their compatriots, who had been their immediate predeces sors in Italy, had brought back to Paris drawings from Venice or whether they themselves had seen Venetian drawings in Italy, we do not know; but it is clear that they knew what the "Vedute" or View Painters were doing with light, atmosphere and distance. Antonio Canaletto (1697-1708) went around his native city, pen in hand, making accurate notes for future compositions. He drew in swift, energetic diagonally slanting, parallel hnes. The severity of these lines is quickly reheved, here and there, by ornamental squirls suggesting leaves or vines or decorative Baroque achitec tural details. In the 18th century, Venice, living gaily and heedlessly on her past glories, was the playground of all Europe. Although Canaletto found his patrons among the visitors to this holiday haunt, neither they nor the Venetian inhabitants themselves are more than puppets or bit-players in the dramatic scenes he presents. All the 595</page><page sequence="16">AGNES MONGAN emphasis is on the hght of Venice as it plays over the buildings, land and water. Not uncommonly he lays his basis in straight lines, even a few lightly ruled lines, either for perspective or for the sharp edges of buildings, but these straight hnes, generally in a red-brown ink, are immediately softened in effect by coohng gray washes or orna mental, enhvening touches in pen. When he undertakes a broad view or invents an imaginary one, assembling, to suit his purpose, a fountain noted in one corner of Venice, a tower in another, a dome or a column or a belfry?even transposing to Venice architectural details that he had seen in his journeys to London, Eton and War wick?the view, however unreal it may be, is made plausible by the accuracy and vivacity of the flickering, warm, transparent, palpable atmosphere that plays over the scene, uniting its various features. (Figure 27; Canaletto, "Circular Church," Fogg Art Museum, Cam bridge, Mass.) Canaletto's compatriot, Francesco Guardi (1712-1793) also made innumerable detail drawings of Venice. Turning again and again to this rich source, he drew Capricci, fanciful compositions of endless invention that have an air of actuality. Though his subject matter was the same and even the vocabulary seemed alike, his use of it was quite different. Where Canaletto had erected his scenes on a sohd, firm base, Guardi seems to have begun from the top, with a flickering pennant, a sun-drenched dome, a sail drying in warm air. Then his pen descends down walls and masts to water which was itself reflecting back hght towards the sky. In his dancing sunshine his scenes seem to float in a golden, misty hght. They are stable yet weightless, held between water and sky. (Figure 28; Francesco Guardi, "San Giorgio Maggiore," Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, Mass.) In the hot summer months, Guardi went up into the Tyrol to visit his mother's Austrian relatives, taking his pen, brushes and paper along. One of the largest and one of the hvehest landscape drawings of the 18th century, Guardi made on such a journey. (Figure 29; Francesco Guardi, "A View of the Levico in the Sugana Valley," Collection of Mr. and Mrs. Donald S. Stralem. ) At the lower edge he wrote not only the town's name, but added that the valley is the place where the Brenta rises. A wonderfully gusty wind sweeps across the scene, tossing the branches of the trees, moving across the mountain slope, making flickering patterns of hght and shade, animating portals, fields and tiny figures. His nervous line always 596</page><page sequence="17">European Landscape Drawing reads and has reason. Its vigor and meaning, the many imitators have always failed to capture. The last of the great Venetian painters, Giovanni Battista Tiepolo ( 1696-1769), ?ways based his magnificent imaginative com positions upon exact knowledge of particular details, which he had sketched in pen and wash. His landscape drawings are few?unas suming in scale, subject matter and finish. Grandeur and elegance were his inherent quahties. Even a simple farmyard gateway is transformed by the glow of the brilliant hght and shadow which his incredibly dextrous and industrious hand created on the shining white pages where he has recorded modest scenes of the Venetian terra firma. Curiously, although Tiepolo populated his frescoed crea tions with hosts of figures, his landscape drawings are empty of hu man life, though the mark of man's handwork is always evident. (Figure 30; Tiepolo, "A Group of Farm Buildings," Fogg Art Museum, Mass.) Further south in Rome, Fragonard was using Claude's favorite medium of bistre wash over quick, free, black chalk guide hnes, but with quite different effects. Gone are the grand sonorities and im mense vistas of 17th century Rome. In their place are more intimate scenes. Graciousness and elegance take the place of noble senti ments. We know that Fragonard studied Rembrandt's drawings as well as Claude's and was both impressed and instructed by them. He scrutinized with particular application Rembrandt's handling of wash. Effervescent southern Frenchman that he was, however, he did not imitate the calm restraint or the elliptical references of the great Dutchman. His brush moved with verve, making quick, dark, vivacious accents here and there. A drawing, variously described as the Garden of the Villa d'Est? or the Villa Pamfili or the Villa Borghese (Figure 31; Fragonard, "The Umbrella Pines at the Villa d'Est?," Besan?on) is one of his happiest inventions with the brush. It has a more vaporous atmosphere than any of Claude or Poussin. Animated groups of small figures in the dress of the day chat to gether or play with the small children in the shadow of the tall parasol pines while shafts of sunlight illumine the many statues on their pedestals. It is informal and intimate, the grandeur of its setting a hold-over from a past no one regards. More often than the brush, both Fragonard and Robert used the red chalk, so long the beloved medium of French draughtsmen, a tool so much easier to carry and use than pen or brush. The 18th 597</page><page sequence="18">AGNES MONGAN century mastery of it has, in richness and variety of effects, never been surpassed. For some months in 1761, Fragonard and Robert were the guests of the Abb? de St. Non at the Villa d'Est?. Neither was yet thirty years old. The pair spent the summer drawing in the famous gardens. In Fragonard's drawings from that stay, one can hear an echo of 17th century grandeur in the sweep of some compositions, such as "The Garden of the Villa d'Est?." He used the red chalk with authority and assurance. In his hand it suggests the dense dark fohage of the tall, flame-like cypresses, the prickly surfaces of the clipped hedges, the slow drift of summer clouds. Then he strikes the note that is pure Fragonard: the children playing gaily in the shadowed foreground just as he saw them. They give tie whole composition a joyous, not a solemn, flavor. As he grew more expert with practice, Fragonard's contours became fewer and shorter, his touch lighter, his accents more deh cate. On his return to Rome in 1773-74 with the Fermier G?n?rale de Bergeret and the financier's party, he recorded with dehghtful wit and accuracy a picnic luncheon on the way. In flickering sunlight they gathered to eat in a small clearing under great oak trees, their servants and carriages near at hand. The sanguine scarcely seems to touch the heavy ivory-colored paper, yet the structure is as sohd as the scene is memorable. (Figure 32; Fragonard, "Le De jeuner de Bergeret," Museum Boymans-van Beuningen, Rotterdam, Holland.) A half century later other gifted Frenchmen also went sketching in the Campagna. The Revolution had then swept away the taste for elegance and wit. With them had vanished, as far as the travel ling artists were concerned, colored chalks and colored papers. Ingres (1780-1867) and Corot (1796-1875) used a simple hard pencil on a clear white paper. Not for them, at that time, vaporous atmosphere. Rather they preferred a clear, bright, limpid light that sharpened edges and defined shapes. Ingres's many precise views of Rome, first pubhshed in 1958, have been a surprise to all but the most knowing. On the other hand, Corot's drawings made on his first trip to Italy have been known and treasured in this country, particularly in Boston, even before the sale of the contents of his studio after his death in 1875. The range, structure and control of Corot's "Mt. Soracte" (Figure 33; Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, Mass.) seems nearer in spirit to Horace's reference to it than to Lord Byron's lines in Childe Harold.

C.</page><page sequence="51">European Landscape Drawing ment to ally him to the cold classicism of David, this view of an ancient countryside, heavy with history, has surely exalted the spirit of the gentle Corot. The landscapes which he drew many years later in France are almost the direct antithesis: generahzed in shapes, imprecise in forms with a heavy, vaporous enveloping atmosphere. Before he left Paris for Rome, Corot may have seen Constable's painting "The Haywain," a landscape which deeply impressed many young French artists when it was shown at the Salon of 1824 in the Louvre. (Delacroix completely repainted the sky of his "Massacre of Scio" in four days after he saw the beauty of the sky in Constable's painting.) It is unlikely, however, that Corot knew Constable's drawings. The Enghsh artist sketched in his own familiar country side. Although he based his paintings on the principles he had learned from Claude and Rubens, his drawings reveal with what a fresh and sensitive eye he regarded every altering cloud-form, every slight movement of wind and the exact angle of the sun's rays. The immediate transcription of the changing hght before his eyes gives to his drawings a wonderful spontaneity. As for coloring effects, no one has rivalled his capacity to record them. Constable's talent had matured slowly. It was only in his forties and fifties that he attained full stature as one of the greatest land scapists. He was forty-eight when he went out sketching one sunny October day at Brighton (Figure 34; Constable, "Brighton at Noon," Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, Mass.). He has written in pencil at the upper left edge of the drawing "18 Octobre 1824, Noon." The autumn sun was veiled with a thin layer of clouds. A hght onshore breeze blew from the Channel. On the shore in front of the artist, fishermen were spreading nets to dry, and at the right two men and a horse were working a primitive winch to draw a boat from the water s edge up onto the beach. The daily occupations of simple folk animate the foreground. Beyond them stretches the Channel dotted with sails leaning away from the wind. Not even the 17th century Dutchmen, the Van der Veldes who went out to record the sea battles from their own boats as official government observers, had been as precise as to name the very hour of the day. Such exact observation would be with Constable only an exercise to be remem bered in general when a more ambitious theme was later attempted in paint. It was not by chance that he filled the foreground with simple people at their daily tasks. He was, after all, almost the exact contemporary of Wordsworth. The social scene was changing in a new age. 631</page><page sequence="52">AGNES MONGAN In Germany, in the early 19th century, there was a resurgence of interest in landscape and many of the artists of the Romantic School also went out in their own countryside to sketch. Others made the journey to Italy. The nature that they preferred was nature on the grand scale, preferably untamed by man: great, craggy, snow-topped, mountain ranges; up-land meadows carpeted with wild flowers; waterfalls and cascades. Yet when one thinks of Turner's dazzling success with similar themes, the German drawings, in spite of the wild splendor of their subject matter, seem a little tame in execution. Turner (1775-1851) had begun modestly, drawing and painting in a traditional rather tight manner, although always with an ex quisitely hght and accurate touch. As he grew older and his com petence increased, his manner loosened, until suddenly in the eighteen-thirties, it seemed to burst free of all restraints. He then dared to attack what had seemed unpaintable: the splendor of sunsets, the translucence of mists and sprays, the density of fog and steam. He had followed contemporary experiments made in optics, and he was fascinated by what photography, then new to the world, could record. In contrast to these scientific interests his own works seem to be poetic visions of light and color. Later when Pissarro and Monet were in London, it was Turner's attempts to paint tran sient effects of hght and sunshine that they studied. The 19,000 drawings and watercolors which Turner bequeathed to the British nation show him an unrivalled master of atmospheric effects. It has been only recently, however, that his very late watercolors have been appreciated. In fact, the latest were shown for the first time in the summer of 1962 at the British Museum. Without Turner's name they might have been considered the creation of our own time. A few early drawings announced the road Turner was to follow. "A View of Solway Moss, Cumberland" (Figure 35; Fogg Art Museum, Cambridge, Mass.), a drawing which once belonged to Ruskin, was made when Turner was returning from his Scottish tour in 1801. With a few, quick strokes of soft pencil, he has drawn the rough terrain of the foreground and the figures bent in the wind and, beyond the water, a line of distant hills darkened with a single stroke of wash. Then he has, with a wash that shades from dark blue-gray to palest gray, brushed in a stormy sky lowering over the distant hills and approaching the foreground figures. It is a drawing of magnificent sweep and ominous mood done with an absolute minimum of means. 632</page><page sequence="53">European Landscape Drawing Van Gogh ( 1853-1890), in the blazing sun of southern France in 1888, had little concern for storm effects. Like his famous Dutch predecessor, Rembrandt, he seems to have preferred quiet, rural scenes. Van Gogh's scale was larger, however, although the preferred means were the same, a reed pen and bistre on white paper. He used that pen in a language of dots and dashes of infinitely varied shapes and emphasis. It can suggest changes of textures and differ ences of intensity. It is an extraordinarily expressive, eloquent tool in the hand of an artist who was seeing this landscape with the excite ment of discovery, strange in its southern brilliance but not unlike his native Holland in its level distances under an immense sky. As he wrote his brother Theo, "The fascination which these vast plains have for me is very strong." That fascination he communicates to us. It was C?zanne ( 1839-1906), at the close of the 19th century and in the early years of the 20th, who marked the real change. In his own work he both summed up the past and foretold the future. The problem of how to render luminous space preoccupied him. As he developed his own way to solve that problem, the perspective of Alberti, which had served artists for four and a half centuries, gradu ally disappeared. As a schoolboy, as recent research has discovered, C?zanne had won prizes both in science and mathematics. He had, thus, a sohd basis for his experiments even though he may have not knowingly used his knowledge. As a mature man, he haunted the museums, small sketch books in hand, making pencil notes of forms. According to his friend Gasquet, whose portrait he painted more than once, he considered that the roots of his art were in Florence, Siena and even Venice. When he exclaimed, "Imagine Poussin remade entirely after nature, that's the classicism I understand," he was speaking with profound self knowledge. "Everytime that I come away from looking at Poussin, I know better what I am." If his long hours in the museum were passed, pencil and notebook in hand, his longer hours in the open found watercolor added to his kit. It was in the use of watercolor that he attained a unique mastery and developed a new language. For C?zanne space was dynamic. It had both volume and tone. These aspects he could not communicate without color, for space modified and changed all colors comprehended in it. To suggest space C?zanne did not seek nuances of tone within a single wash. Instead, he placed pure, clear washes of infinite range, within a limited number of colors, in small touches on the page. Through the astounding accuracy with which he selected and placed them, they 633</page><page sequence="54">AGNES MONGAN define the precise spot in space which an object occupies. Their massing and their placing, with a patient exactitude and often with miraculous brevity, develop both form and depth. It was an exact ing, exhausting, exhilarating method. When employed by this master of structure, whose technique grew in authority and freedom, it gave weight and volume as well as distance. At first the great impressive mass of Mt. Ste. Victoire, that mountain which he studied in all lights, all weather and from all angles, seemed solidly still. As his skill grew he wished to translate more than its outward form and shape. He wished to evoke the tensions beneath it and around it. To him the air and space that enveloped it was as powerful and full of drama as the gravitational pulls that held it down. As he worked the shapes became heavier, the volumes simpler, more compact; their edges sharper; a world-pervasive geometry was being made visible. Then about 1900, in a terrific drama, the forms began to break up, yet strangely without disturbing the whole composition which is still held tightly together. In the years before his death in 1906, the great mountain seems to be alive but no more ahve than the air around it?and this air is not a transparent envelope covering only a thin surface of the earth. It is composed of elemental forces that sometimes tear it open to reveal prismatic vistas of immense heights. It was a struggle to construct these monumental themes, to make visible these sensations of form. His experiences and the penetration of his eye and the innate geometric cast of his mind held his com positions together. But, in the very means he had chosen, he had opened the way to others with different aims. It was only a step for the Cubists to cast off the anchor which held the artist to the visible world, and for the Abstractionists to divorce color and design from familiar shapes. With those who came after, the Proven?al houses became cubes; the trees, conic sections. A highly intellectuahzed approach, far more mathematical and geometrical than Cezanne's own, looks not for what is easily visible. It assays a simultaneous representation, in a tightly organized scheme, of the many facets of a single, known object. Nature has small place, at first, in this new development, and space does not go beyond the picture plane. Looking back we see that the Renaissance Italians had drawn landscapes as settings and as symbols, settings for dramas and sym bols of God's power and presence. Later Italians, even when they drew directly from nature, did so suffusing their scenes with a sense of man's long past In their great period, the Germans with no 634</page><page sequence="55">European Landscape Drawing backward glance but with the contemporary stresses of the Religious Wars lending a highly charged emotional content, saw their forests, mountains, and lakes animated by the same mysterious forces that moved their figures, so that sometimes man and trees and shrubs seemed made of the same materials and subject to the same strains. Rubens and Van Dyck seemed to feel the secret forces of the earth vibrating yet controlled beneath them, as the air moved all on its surface. Rembrandt turned his eyes calmly on his own familiar scenes. With acute powers of observation, an incomparable tech nique and no inclination to exaggeration, he transformed it through loving understanding and a poetic sensibility. Claude and Poussin, when they recorded a scene, did so not as an end in itself but so that they might later readjust and rearrange the elements in the more decorous design of a painting. The 18th century refined and made less formal and less elevated the 17th century's observation. In the 19th century there began the dissolution of shapes in an enveloping light, but it was not until the end of the century that the earth itself and the atmosphere above it seemed for the first time in precarious balance. For five hundred years, artists had followed the scientists and the inventors, adjusting their view of the world to the expanding knowl edge offered by the scientists, and their technique to the innovations proffered by the inventors. Then it was an artist who announced, in clear, pure tones, the end of one era and the dawn of another. It has happened more than once that an artist's statement has pro claimed in a visual language which only a few of his contemporaries can read, the way in which the world is to move. With C?zanne, conventional perspective was abandoned, and with it ordered, contained space. With these vanished the tradition of shaping contour and contained form. In their place came a new approach and a new feeling. It is a far cry from the mild, serene and modest mountains in the enclosed and ordered world of van Eyck and Benozzo Gozzoli. 635</page></plain_text>
