<plain_text><page sequence="1">News and Notes New archaeological discoveries in Jalisco, Mexico DENVER (The Center for Latin American Art and Archaeol ogy). For the first time in the archaeological exploration of West Mexico, scientifically excavated shaft tombs with sub stantial tomb offerings afford scholars the opportunity to examine and record the skeletal material and offerings in situ. The tombs are currently being excavated by INAH scientists Jorge Ramos and Lorenza Lopez at Huitzilapa, Jalisco. The radiocarbon dates for the shaft tombs average out at circa AD 100. These tombs are similar to other shaft tombs in the Magdalena Basin. Uncovered during construction work on a highway through the area, the site is under investigation by an archaeological team interested in studying area settle ment patterns. The site is located in a district with rich lake resources where the predominant architectural type em ployed a cruciform arrangement of buildings around a central plaza. Other dates associated with the circular buildings at Huitzilapa suggest the site enjoyed a 300-year life-span. The shaft tomb is located near what is called the "West Plaza" at Huitzilapa. It consists of a shaft 8.5 meters deep with two chambers which the team labeled "north" and "south." Three interments were found in each chamber, but there was a substantial difference between the two chambers with regard to their respective burial goods. Offerings in the north chamber included vessels such as ceramic bowls and incense burners. Some vessels contained remains of foodstuffs. In addition, six figurines and over 50,000 worked shell items were among the grave goods. Also, a number of large, complete conch shells associated with the principal burial were decorated in the cloisonné technique in three colours. In addition, jade (greenstone) items, including small figurines, beads, obsidian points, atlatl handles and a ground stone axe were found in and around the burials. The principal person buried in the north chamber was taller than the other two present and had been covered with shell ornaments - whole conch shells in the pelvic area, shell bracelets and thousands of small pieces of shell that origi nally had covered a body cloth or mantle. He wore a belt composed of pieces of slate, and a nicely carved, small bluish green jade figurine was placed nearby. The second inter ment was also associated with shell bracelets and small jade anklets. The ankles showed evidence of having been tied together, perhaps to facilitate lowering the body into the tomb. The third interment in the tomb, a female, also bore much shell jewelry. A number of large ceramic figurines were found in the north chamber, and were identified as of El Arenal Brown type. Of special interest was a large standing ballplayer. Physical anthropologist Robert Pickering contributed his analysis of the skeletal material in both chambers, observing that the principal person in the north chamber, deposited as a fresh burial, was a large and robust male aged about 45 years. Some cranial deformation similar to that seen on some West Coast ceramics was noted. The skeleton was accompanied by a younger adult male whose elbow exhibited damage charac teristic of prolonged use of the atlatl. The third skeleton was a litte old lady who probably had suffered from arthritis.</page><page sequence="2">The south chamber held three badly deteriorated skele tons and fewer offerings than in the north chamber. One interesting anomaly, Pickering noted, was the fact that three of the bodies in the tombs had fused cervical vertebrae, an uncommon trait that suggests they were related genetically. Calakmul, Campeche: The main burial of Building 2H CAMPECHE (William J. Folan and Abel Morales Lopez). Calakmul, situated in the southeast of the Mexican state of Campeche, and under investigation since 1982 by the Centra de Investigaciones Histöricas y Sociales (CIHS) of the Universidad Autönoma de Campeche (UAC) with the support of the state government, Conacyt, INAH, INI, DIGISCA and the National Geographic Society, was one of the greatest and most powerful urban and regional centres in the Maya area during the Late Preclassic, Early Classic, and Late Classic. Its capital (Fig. 1) appears to have been more populous than Tikal - the main rival of Calakmul - within its highly concentric nucleus of 22 square kilometres. In the centre evidence for the presence of a variety of ceremonial, domestic, and production activities was found that had been practiced in the various buildings. WI&amp;0K: t, " '" ' x"4u' ^ J+.'jKV y&gt;^ Fig. 1. A new reconstruction of the centre of Calakmul (Photo courtesy of CIHS/UAC). In its time the regional state of Calakmul covered an expanse of approximately 10,000 square kilometers that contained 19 large cities and 295 towns of lesser size. Moreover, a total of 362 stelae - not counting the 116 in Calakmul itself - are known, some with emblem glyphs identifying the major centres, as well as the representation of rulers accompanied by dynastic texts naming the same personages, their spouses and children, information on the relationships between Calakmul and its neighbours, on the wars it conducted, the numbers of captives taken, and on dynastic marriages, to mention a few. One of the achievements of the CIHS was the preparation of a map of the 30 km2 urban centre of Calakmul, including about 6,250 structures and cultural features, laid out in a concentric manner from the Preclassic on as far as El Labe rinto. Calakmul was linked with its surrounding areas by means of eight sacbeob, one of which connected it with the site of El Mirador in Guatemala 38 km southeast of Calakmul. Another led to the site of Tintai, 30 km further to the south, while several more ran in a southeasterly direction, perhaps as far as a tributary site of Calakmul, El Laberinto. SHu- ** -K - 'S* -"Vi A -m; / 1" Fig. 2. The funerary mask from Building 2H, Calakmul (Photo courtesy ofCIHS/UAC). One of the most important archaeological finds of the CIHS was the discovery of three royal tombs, each with a funerary mask of jadeite plates representing a portrait of the deceased in a semi-deified form. The last mask of this type (Fig. 2) is associated with a tomb of the 8th century A.D., from Building 2H of Calakmul, excavated in December 1993. This mask of 251 plates was found sacrificed, that is, broken, over a ceramic base of unfired clay to the side of the bone remains of its owner. It was later reconstructed to its original splen dour by an INAH/UAC team. The eyes of the mask were formed of obsidian and mother-of-pearl, as were the teeth. The lips, ears, canines and nose pendants were also of mother-of-pearl. The nostrils have a shell foundation plus two disks of red stone. Two earplugs were found around the mask. An anthropomorphic jadeite pendant of the Descending God, with a beaded necklace (including one bead of jade), also accompanied the burial. A codex-style vessel found in the tomb perhaps represents symbolically the occupant as falling into an aquatic nether world, as was the case with Pacal of Palenque. This tomb with its jade mask and polychrome vessel, among other objects, represents one of the most important finds bearing on the funerary customs of the Ancient Maya of Calakmul. The Maya ruins of X'Polwakax, Yucatan GRAZ (Karl H. Mayer). In April 1995 mexicon staff mem bers Stephan Merk and Karl Herbert Mayer visited a presum ably undocumented Maya site in the municipality of Santa Elena, in the Mexican state of Yucatan. Guided by Pedro Mas Briseno of Santa Elena, who had visited the archaeological site before, Merk and Mayer inspected the small group of ruins and took photographs and measurements of the few remaining architectural features. The guide indicated that the</page><page sequence="3">ruins had no specific name. Since a nearby location is known as X'Polwakax, a Yucatec term meaning "head of cattle," the ruins have been given this name tentatively. X'Polwakax is situated near Mexican Highway 261, be tween the town of Santa Elena and the Maya ruins of Kabah. The ruins lie east of the road and can be reached between kilometre posts 120 and 121, about 7 km south of Santa Elena and 1.3 km north of Kabah. There is a slight possibility that X'Polwakax is identical with an unnamed site registered as 16Qd( 10) : 137 in the Atlas Arqueolögico del Estado de Yuca tân by Silvaia Garza and Edward Kurjack (Merida 1980, Vol. 1:105). The ruins are located approximately 200 m east of High way 261 within dense forest characterized-by several deep karst depressions. There are several mounds and platforms and the only substantial architectural remains are to be found on a stepped platform measuring about 15 m in north-south orientation. On the northern part of the platform are the remains of a structure whose surviving architectural details indicate that originally the building consisted of two rooms arranged in tandem fashion. It is possible that to the east of this structure another, but smaller, room once existed. The only partially standing architecture at X'Polwakax is a large wall faced with rectangular veneer stones of different sizes, at the present time exhibiting seven courses of stones (Fig. 3). The wall is 6.5 m long, 75 cm deep, and must once have been taller than the preserved 2.35 m. In the rubble around the main platform there are many large plain facade stones and several large monolithic slabs, obviously parts of lintels and door jambs. On the platform's east side there are two large stone columns, probably parts of doorway columns. No further architectural details were noted. Fig. 3. Standing wall at X'polwakax (Photo: Karl Herbert Mayer 1995). The ballcourt of EI Chal, Peten GUATEMALA CITY (Paulino I. Morales). In an earlier report on the archaeological site of El Chal, Peten, Guatemala (mexicon XVI, 1995) the conspicuous absence of a ballcourt was noted. The partial reconnaissance of the area at that time, of necessity limited in nature because of the retention of the vegetation protecting the boundaries between the central plazas of the site and the modern settlement, was the reason for this negative assessment. Since then, it has been possible to locate a ballcourt structure in the sector north of the West Plaza. The two structures that comprise the court are on average 4 m in height, each supporting a rectangular bench on its A L_—i/' Northwest Ballcourt Plaza West Plaza Sculpted Blocks BCD / / / / 1 J 1 TTi feSBQO/ _i II / 0 20 cm 1 I A L_—i/' Northwest Ballcourt Plaza West Plaza 50 100 m Sculpted Blocks BCD ^ / / / / 1 J 1 Tri feSBQQ/ _i II / 1 Ipas01^^»^ 0 20 cm 1 I ISf Fig. 4. Ground plan of El Chal, showing the location of the newly discovered ballcourt. upper platform. A staircase is situated at its rear. The area of the ballcourt measures 18 m in length and 4.8 m in width. The axis of the court registers a deviation of 4° azimuth. An extended structure occupies the north side of the ballcourt (Fig. 4). On the bench of the court on both structures four sculpted blocks were discovered that must have decorated the comice of the inner walls of the playing area. One of the blocks exhibits an element in the form of an ahau, while the other three present straight and curved lines. These structures date to the Late Classic. Extensive mapping of Caracol SAN FRANCISCO (PARI/A. and D. Chase). The 1995 field season at Caracol lasted from the middle of February until the end of May and was the second of two seasons of research focussing on the core settlement at Caracol. Work was partic ularly geared towards identifying settlement density and drop-off, if any, as well as the relationship between Caracol's agricultural systems and settlement. As in 1994, investiga tions centred on the northeastern portion of the site. Extensive mapping was carried out during the 1995 field season in a variety of locales. In the northeastern sector of Caracol, emphasis was placed on the time-consuming map ping of agricultural terraces as a means of placing residential plaza groups in the context of their associated agricultural systems. Two areas were intensively mapped - an area greater than 1km2 to the west of Puchituk Hill and an area half this size to the south of Puchituk Terminus. In spite of the detailed 50m grid coverage originally employed, the more detailed terrace mapping increased the overall structure total by 9%</page><page sequence="4">for these areas. This is particularly significant given the al ready dense settlement noted in this core area. In accord with the original NSF research design, a 200 m wide by 4 km long transect was run due south of the Royal Group (Pajaro Ramonal Terminus) in search of settlement drop-off. As with the 1994 Cohune transect, no drop in overall settlement density for Caracol was recorded along its entire distance. The transect did, however, encounter a new cause way leading to Round Hole Bank at a distance of 3 km from the Royal Group. Additional systematic mapping of structure groups was undertaken in a central "square" 6.25km2 area encompassing the site epicentre. This "block" kind of cover age will permit better comparisons to be made between Caracol and other sites, such as Tikal or Calakmul. A Maya vase from "El Senor del Petén" CHETUMAL (F. Cortés de Brasdefer). In 1991 heavy ma chinery destroyed a 4 m high mound at the archaeological site known as "El Senor del Petén", located in the ejido of Nuevo Veracruz, in the Mexican state of Quintana Roo. Inside the mound a vaulted room was found, painted in red. When the mechanical shovel destroyed the room, a large stone was found which covered four Maya vessels. One of the vessels is an important polychrome vase, al most 18 cm high (Fig. 5). The scene depicts five individuals inside a palace with three levels. Among the five human figures there is a male elite personage seated at the highest Fig. 5. Polychrome vase discovered at "El Senor del Petén" in the south of Quintana Roo. Fig. 6. Drawing of the vase. level of the scene. He sits on a bench in front of his throne with a cushion. There is another figure seated on the lowest level at his right. In front of the protagonist is a seated figure, probably a female, looking at him. At the left-hand side of the representation, on the lowest level, are two human figures, one seated, one standing, possibly of lower social rank and listening to the ongoing conversation of the two elite person ages in the centre of the image. Each figure is accompanied by hieroglyphic inscriptions, arranged horizontally, vertical ly, and diagonally (Fig. 6). A detailed study of this important find is in preparation. Painted capstones from Edzna, Campeche MEXICO (Leticia Staines C.). In March 1994 members of the research project "La Pintura Mural Prehispânica en México", coordinated by Beatriz de la Fuente of the Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas (UNAM), carried out a further sur vey in the Maya area to continue the registration of Maya paintings (seemexicon XV [1993]: 111-15). On this occasion the conservation of paintings at Edzna, Campeche was to be verified. A detailed investigation of the Temple of the Five Stories resulted in the discovery of painted capstones in two side rooms on the fourth level.</page><page sequence="5">The two capstones are painted with red colour on a white Ann Cyphers, Federico Fahsen, John Fox, Gary Gossen, plaster ground.

In a short introduction, however, new evidence of a very early presence of the book in Florence is presented. The naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi in a letter of October 12, 1589 refers to the codex and calls it "that very rich book of Spain". Since it seems unlikely that the Historia General arrived at the Medici court as a gift from the Spanish king just a few years after the "cédula" ordering the confiscation of all Sahagün's works, its early presence in Italy can be ascribed only to Rodrigo de Siquera, who, as pointed out by Baudot (1969, 1976), seems to be the real saviour of the Florentine Codex. Moreover, de Siquera's role and the hurry to finish copying the codex before his departure for Spain is confirmed by the Latin dedication to Siquera at the beginning of Book 6 (D'Olwerand Cline 1973:197; Leon Portilla 1990:9) and from the fact that, from the end of Book 11, nearly all the drawings have been left uncoloured; as evidence of the haste, it is worth mentioning that three of them have paint only in the green areas and another only in the yellow-orange areas.
