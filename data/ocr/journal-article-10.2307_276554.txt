<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND NEWS GENERAL In the last issue, national and regional meetings and organizations were noted in this column. As this materi- al is being prepared, several Americanists, accompanied by envy and good wishes, are on their way to major in- ternational assemblies at Cambridge and Vienna. Of value and importance at least rivalling these gatherings was the International Symposium last June in New York convened by the Wenner-Gren Foundation (Viking Fund) - this exceptionally well-planned and organized meeting is reported separately below, by two of the Assistant Editors who attended, A. D. Krieger and John Rowe. Returning briefly to local and regional groups and periodicals - the Archeological Newsletter of the Upper Ohio Valley Archeological Survey (William J. Mayer- Oakes, Editor, Carnegie Museum, Pittsburgh) is now is- sued in a new and improved format, lithoprinted instead of mimeographed, beginning with No. 5, March 1952; the newly-established Oklahoma Anthropological Society issued its first Newsletter in April. (Dr. Robert E. Bell, Editor, University of Oklahoma, Norman). The Grave Creek Mound Museum at the site of the Grave Creek Mound in Moundsville, W. Va., operated by the West Virginia Archaeological Society, under supervision of Delf Norona, the society's secretary and editor, was opened to the public July 4, 1952. The museum is de- voted to regional archeology, extending in time from the archaic people down to the historic Indians, with em- phasis on the history of the Grave Creek mounds and the Adena culture. Most of the next few paragraphs are lifted from that most useful newsletter, that of the Clearinghouse foi Southwestern Museums (F. H. Douglas, Denver Art Museum, 1300 Logan St., Denver, Colo.). The 1952 annual meeting of the Society for Applied Anthropology is to be held at Haverford College, Penn- sylvania, Sept. 5-7. The American Association of Physi- cal Anthropologists held its annual meeting at the New York Academy of Science, March 21-23. The Linguistic Institute for 1952 was held at Indiana University, June 18-August 15, sponsored by the Linguistic Society of America; it included intensive training in linguistic theory as well as in European languages and "primitive" languages. The annual meeting of the American Folklore So- ciety will be held in El Paso, December 22-23, jointly with the New Mexico group; the program chairman is Dr. Haldeen Braddy, Texas Western College, El Paso, Texas. The Colorado Archaeological Society held its annual meeting at Rocky Ford, Colo., July 12, with a field trip on July 13 to stone circles in the vicinity. UNESCO has announced an international seminar on the role of museums in education, to be held at the Brooklyn Museum from Sept. 14 to Oct. 12. The num- ber of participants is limited to 45, one person from each member state, but provision has been made for attend- ance by observers from international organizations in fields of art, science, and education. A new medium for the publication of scholarly papers has been launched, under the title of "The Annals of American Research," by the Public Affairs Press in Washington. Inquiries should be addressed to the Edi- tor, Annals of American Research, 2153 Florida Ave., N. W., Washington, D.C. (do not submit manuscripts without prior correspondence). The Western States Branch of the American Anthro- pological Association has published News Bulletin No. 1, 1952, prepared and distributed by the group at Stanford, including information on activities of the Anthropology Departments of Stanford University and the University of Utah. In the American Anthropological .Association News Bulletin, Vol. 6, No. 3, July 1952, there are full statements of important new developments in anthro- pology at the University of Colorado and University of Arizona. As of July 1, the National Park Service took over di- rect supervision of the River Basin archaeological salvage program, outside the Missouri Basin, instead of transfer- ing the funds obtained for this work to the Smithsonian Institution, as heretofore. The Smithsonian Institution will continue to handle the tremendous Missouri Basin project, and will also do certain specific jobs in the eastern U.S. (surveys, by Carl Miller, working out of Washington). Three field offices of the River Basin Surveys have been transferred from the Smithsonian Institution, accordingly, to the National Park Service-- at Georgia (Joseph Caldwell), Austin, Texas (Edward B. Jelks), and Portland, Oregon (Joel Shiner). A splen- did editorial by Carl Chapman on the importance and urgency of the River Basin archaeological salvage pro- gram appeared in the Missouri Archaeological Society News Letter, No. 56, Feb., 1952. The date for the Tenth Plains Conference for Archae- ology has not been set but an informal poll of field workers indicates that a date late in November, 1952, would be satisfactory. EARLY MAN The second year of excavation at the Lind Coulee site, which is located in the arid Columbia Basin region of central Washington, is being carried on under a grant from the National Park Service to the State College of Washington (Pullman), Richard Daugherty reports. Lind Coulee, which would be called an arroyo in the Southwest, is a meandering gully with nearly vertical walls averaging nearly 20 feet in height. Its seasonal stream cuts its way through Pleistocene basalts and sands and recent sands, silts and loess until it terminates in the drainage of lower Crab Creek. The occurrence of several artifacts, flint chips, and bone fragments pro- truding from the eroding coulee wall evidenced the 189</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY existence of the site. At several points, lenses of fire- blackened earth were visible. The excavations of 1951 produced more than 100 artifacts plus quantities of cultural refuse, including chipping debris, and burned and unburned bone frag- ments. A number of the partially mineralized bone fragments were identifiable, bison being most plentiful. None of the fragments of bison bones were of sufficient- ly diagnostic value to make species identification pos- sible. At the present writing more than 200 artifacts have been found plus additional cultural debris. In- cluded in the types of artifacts are long-stemmed pro- jectile points, flake knives, flake scrapers, keeled scrapers, choppers, retouched flakes, 3 bone shafts, a serrated bone spear point, a small grinding stone with red ocher on it, and associated with the grinding stone a small hand stone, also with ocher on it. Preliminary geological investigations strongly suggest that the Lind Coulee site might be the first "early man" site found in Washington. Results of radiocarbon tests on bone materials have not yet been received. A very extensive preceramic site in Ontario, near Sheguindah on Manitoulin Island in the north of Geor- gian Bay, recently discovered and currently being investi- gated by Thomas E. Lee of the Canadian National Museum, is reported in the New York Times of July 6, 1952. Large quantities of stone implements have been found; the material is apparently much later than that of the well-known Killarney site. CALIFORNIA W. J. Wallace reports that a rock-shelter in southern Ventura County, previously unstudied, was recently examined and the pictographs on the ceiling recorded by a group from the Department of Anthropology of the University of Southern California. A report on the pictographs is being prepared. A group of major students under Wallace's direction are preparing a report on the excavation of the Little Sycamore site, also in southern Ventura County, which was excavated by a U.S.C. class in archaeological field techniques during the spring. Several additional sites in Little Sycamore Canyon were to be mapped and tested during the summer. Charles Rozaire is handling a salvage job on a large site at Encino in the San Fernando Valley. The site, reportedly a historic one, will soon be destroyed to make way for a golf-course clubhouse. It is littered with manos and metates, hammerstones, and crude core tools. Vol- unteer help from U.C.L.A., U.S.C., and the Archaeo- logical Survey Association of Southern California, has assisted, Wallace adds. An interesting site near Temecula in Riverside County is being excavated by E. B. McCown for the Archaeo- logical Survey Association. A quantity of artifacts and a Spanish adobe structure have been found. Wallace also kindly informs us that Al Mohr exca- vated in a large site in the Cachuma Reservoir area in Santa Barbara County for the River Basin Surveys dur- ing May of this year, and returned in the summer to continue the work. A large house pattern was un- earthed, and artifacts which indicate that the site con- tains both Hunting and Canalifio components. Personnel assisting included students from U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and U.C. (Berkeley). For a really interesting report in California archae- ology, interpreting Phil C. Orr's findings on Santa Rosa Island, the Associate Editor cannot resist referring you back to Time for Feb., 4, 1952, as well as Orr's "Review of Santa Barbara Channel Archaeology," SWIA 8-2, Summer 1952, pp. 211-226. NORTHERN PLAINS Eight archaeological River Basin Surveys (Smithsonian Institution) parties, as well as one palaeontological, were in the field in the Missouri River basin during June and July - at the Oldham site, Fort Randall Reservoir, S. Dak. (Cumming), the Kropp and Hintze sites, James River, N. Dak. (Wheeler), the Nightwalkers Butte site, near Elbowoods, N. Dak. (Hartle), sites at the Oahe Dam, S. Dak. (Fenenga), the Whetstone site and "old" Fort Randall, S. Dak. (Mills), a large site at Fort Ben- nett, S. Dak. (Cooper), Fort Berthold II, army post of 1855-1874 (G. Hubert Smith), and on aerial photo- graphic survey (Solecki). Nine field parties of other institutions coiperating in the River Basin program in the Missouri were also at work -Nebraska State Historical Society near Chamber- lain, S. Dak. (Marvin Kivett), University of Kansas at the Talking Crow site, S. Dak. (Carlyle Smith), Uni- versity of Missouri on the Pomme de Terre River, Mis- souri (Carl Chapman), University of Montana in the Garrison Reservoir, N. Dak. (Carling Malouf), Labora- tory of Anthropology of the University of Nebraska in the Harlan County Reservoir near Alma, Nebr. (John Champe and Don Lehmer), Nebraska State Museum at the Red Smoke site, Nebr. (C. B. Schultz and James Gunnerson), North Dakota Historical Society at Like-a- Fishhook village, N. Dak. (James Howard), University of Wyoming at site 48CK7 near Moorcroft, Wyo. (Bill Mulloy), and the University of South Dakota's W. H. Over Museum at the Thomas Riggs site north of Pierre, S. Dak. (Wesley Hurt). SOUTHEAST VIRGINIA. Investigations were carried on for the River Basin Surveys by Carl F. Miller of the Smithsonian In- stitution at the Buggs Island Reservoir (now renamed the John H. Kerr Reservoir), on the Roanoke River in south- ern Virginia, from April 17 to June 30. At one of the seven sites tested, stratigraphic material was found be- ginning with a late preceramic period and terminating sometime during the middle period of Woodland. As- sociated with the latter were 2 completely flexed burials accompanied by turtle carapaces. Miller had found a similar association during his previous work there, and in no case did the position of the carapaces indicate use as food containers. 190 [2, 1952</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND NEWS FLORIDA. The University of Florida continued its sur- vey activity on the Florida Gulf Coast in Levy County. A series of small Weeden Island shell mounds were found along the shore. With few exceptions they are mainly eroded away by wave action. Some test exca- vations were made in a rich but badly pothunted Weeden Island burial mound (Lv 2). Other excavations were made in eastern Florida at Jones Creek near Jacksonville. This is an occupation site of the Orange Period carrying over into St. Johns Ia. It is remarkable for the strong Georgia influence in the latter occupation. Deptford and Savannah (?) pottery types were very important. Glenn Allen, a student at Florida State University, is doing archaeological work on the northwest coast of Florida. To date excavations have been made on Dog Island and St. George Island. John M. Goggin's monograph "Space and Time Per- spective in Northern St. Johns Archeology, Florida" was published early in August in the Yale Publications in Anthropology. It interprets and summarizes data on 432 archeological sites ranging from paleo-Indian to historic periods. GEORGIA. Excavations being carried out by Sheila Kelly Caldwell, at Darien (noted in the July issue of American Antiquity) were continued. A considerable number of postholes indicates buildings but their pattern has yet to be worked out. Of interest is what appears to be a small diamond-shaped structure (tower?) along a major wall line. The main part of the site, though, is clearly historic Indian with Spanish contacts, very possibly a mission. Goggin dates it, on the basis of Spanish majol- ica found, as being circa 1600-1650. Lewis H. Larsen, Jr., on behalf of the Georgia Historical Commission, is tackling, with success, the old problem of Spanish mis- sions in coastal Georgia. Over a dozen sites have been found with Spanish pottery. That which can be dated is placed in the first half of the seventeenth century. The historic Cherokee site of Tugaloo is being exca- vated under the supervision of William Edwards. William Sears, University of Georgia, is continuing work at Kolomoki State Park. During this season he excavated mound F and mound B. The former con- tained only a small platform mound, evidently used for only a brief period. Mound B contained only a collec- tion of large postholes scattered in a rather random fashion. The mound seems to have resulted from earth piled arou.nd the base of these poles. LOUISIANA. James Ford excavated several test trenches in the Poverty Point site during May. As recently re- ported (American Antiquity, Vol. 18, No. 1, p. 96) there is a series of large concentric earthworks, octagonal in shape, and about 3/4 mile in diameter. Centering on one of the sides of the octagon is one of the two large. Poverty Point mounds, 70 feet in height and roughly "T" shaped. Apparently all this construction took place in prepottery times. Both in the ridges of the octagon and in the mound fill are found Poverty Point baked-clay objects in great number. In certain localized areas are found innumerable Jaketown "perforators." The pros- pect of correlating the age of the construction with history of the Mississippi drainage is seen in that an old channel of the Arkansas River has cut away a portion of the octagon. The results of this excavation are to be incorporated into the report on the Jaketown site by Ford, Philip Phillips, and William Haag, which was to go to press in September. MISSOURI. The field school of the University of Mis- souri, directed by Carl Chapman, worked in the Table Rock Reservoir area, southwestern Missouri, in June and July, finding three occupations ranging from an archaic horizon to one comparable to Middle Mississippi. OKLAHOMA. The field school of the University of Oklahoma, directed by R. E. Bell, carried on further salvage excavations, under a research contract with the National Park Service, at site 39 in the Tenkiller Ferry reservoir, eastern Oklahoma, during June and July. Forty flexed burials were found, a house and parts of two others, and minor features. A variety of stone and bone implements was found, and both shell-tempered and clay-tempered pottery. A preceramic archaic horizon is also found in the underlying clay layer. Bell now feels that the relationship of the upper deposits to the Turkey Bluff focus does not appear to be as close as has pre- viously been suggested. EAST TEXAS. E. B. Jelks of the River Basin Surveys field office at Austin completed excavations during the spring at the Texarkana Reservoir on Sulphur River. SOUTHWEST The 1952 Pecos Conference, annual gathering of Southwestern anthropologists, was held at Santa Fe by the Museum of New Mexico on August 11, 12, and 13, with sessions in both the Laboratory of Anthropology and the adjoining new International Museum of Folk Art. More than 100 anthropologists, almost all of them engaged in field work in the Southwest, attended, repre- senting the University of New Mexico, Museum of New Mexico, University of Colorado Museum, University of Denver, Museum of Northern Arizona, University of Utah, University of Arizona and Arizona State Museum, Pueblo Grande, Heard Museum, Amerind Foundation, U.S. National Park Service, Denver Museum of Natural History, University of Michigan Museum, Morehead State College (Kentucky), Southern Illinois University, Panhandle-Plains Museum (Canyon, Texas), Peabody Museum (Harvard), Chicago Museum of Natural His- tory, University of Chicago, University of California, University of Oregon, and other institutions. A. V. Kidder was general chairman of the conference and presided over two sessions in which reports on the results of summer excavations, and other current arch- eological work, were given. Fred Eggan and W. W. Hill presided at ethnological report sessions. One morning was devoted to discussions of culture classifications, with 191</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Jame B. Griffin presiding. After a review of the original Pecos Classification developed in 1927, and the later Hohokam and Mogollon sequences, Martin and Rinal- do's "The Southwestern Co-tradition" (SWJA 7-3, Au- tumn 1951, pp. 215-229) and Daifuku's "A New Conceptual Scheme for Prehistoric Cultures in the Southwestern United States" (Amer. Anthrop. 52-2, April 1952, pp. 191-200) were discussed at length. Much interest in the new classifications was evinced by those anthropologists engaged in teaching and museum inter- pretation, who felt they represented useful attempts at synthesis of available data. Further definition of South- western cultural areas was deemed necessary, and H. S. Colton was asked to appoint a committee to define areas and make further recommendations on these culture classifications at the next conference. The antiquity of maize in the Southwest and the vari- eties found were briefly reviewed. Similarities and dif- ferences in the corn from Bat Cave and Tularosa Cave were discussed by Herbert Dick and John Rinaldo, and a report by Volney Jones on corn from Earl Morris' Durango Basketmaker sites was read by Griffin. In honor of A. V. Kidder and the 25th anniversary of the original Pecos Conference, the Museum of New Mexico entertained the conferees at a picnic lunch at Pecos Pueblo. Dr. Kidder was presented with a minia- ture silver trowel engraved with the words "Pecos Con- ference, 1927-1952" in commemoration of the first meet- ing of Southwestern archaeologists at his camp twenty- five years ago. Fred Wendorf of the Museum of New Mexico led a conducted tour to the site of Cuyamungue, a Tewa pueblo of the early historic period, where he has been excavating since early June. The Museum of Northern Arizona will be host to the 1953 Pecos Conference at Flagstaff next summer. SOUTH AMERICA BRAZIL. William D. Hohenthal returned in June, 1952, from a year's ethnographic survey on the lower Sao Francisco River in northeastern Brazil, a project financed by a grant from the Social Science Research Council. Incidental to study of the surviving Indians of the area (Fulni6, Shucuri, Pancararu and numerous other groups in central Pernambuco and western Alagoas and on both banks of the Sao Francisco), Hohenthal visited a large number of archaeological sites and made extensive sur- face collections. His data will have considerable interest, since this part of Brazil is entirely unknown archaeolog- ically. Large rubbish sites, 50 by 100 meters or larger, are common on the islands of the Sao Francisco River above Petrolandia and on the western slopes of a number of ranges of hills on the Pernambuco side. They are marked by abundant surface sherds in the manioc patches of the present Indian inhabitants. Large burial urns, some containing bone fragments and others cre- mations, are commonly found in these sites. There are a lot of caves in the area, but only one, a burial cave at Itaparica dug many years ago by Carlos Estevao, is known to contain ancient remains. Bed rock mortars and metates are very common, sometimes as many as 50 occurring together. Pictographs are very abundant and consist mostly of simple geometric designs in white, red, yellow or black; as many as three of these colors may be used together in one figure. The pottery is well fired, and of varying thickness and fineness of finish. It is generally sand tempered. Large pots and big square bowls (locally called alguidares) are common shapes. The finer pieces are painted with red or white lines; other sherds have punctations, thumb nail impressions, corrugations, and cord or textile im- pressions as decoration. Decorated sherds run to only about a third of the total found. Clay pipes are very abundant. The commonest are elbow pipes, often anthropomorphic and showing the old style Indian crown-cut headdress. Tubular pipes and platform pipes are also found. Stonework consists mostly of axes; plain, three quarter grooved, and modified anchor shapes are all found. The slab mortars used by the modern Indians are probably reused archaeological specimens. Beads of clay, bird bones, or snake ribs are found in the burial urns. There is some evidence that part of the archaeological material is post contact. The Fulni6 Indians report finding coins in some of the alguidares found in their territory, and many of the pipes have Christian crosses as part of the decoration. The area looks like a very promising one from the point of view of the possibility of establishing an archaeological chronology. PERU. John Rowe, Assistant Editor for South America, attended the Wenner-Gren Symposium, and worked in the museums and libraries of New York, New Haven, Cambridge and Philadelphia on various Peruvian prob- lems. The museum work was largely concerned with keros, the lacquered wooden cups which are such a characteristic feature of Inca art (cf. S. Linn6, Ethnos, 1949:118-139). There is no direct evidence for dating these objects, since the known specimens were not exca- vated in archaeological context but purchased from descendants of the original owner, usually by dealers who kept no provenience record. Some inferences as to date can be made from the style and the motives of the designs, however. The lacquered style begins about the time of the Spanish conquest and lasts into the seven- teenth century and very probably as late as the eigh- teenth. Earlier pieces have stiffer and less crowded designs, while in later ones the designs are freer and show a variety of scenes of Colonial life and Inca legend. One fine piece in the American Museum of Natural History has a scene identified by J. B. Bird as a battle between the forces of Huascar and Atahuallpa, while a specimen at Yale shows the capture of Huascar. Junius Bird and his staff at the American Museum of Natural History have reorganized a large part of the Peruvian pottery exhibit, and one of the new cases dis- plays a very ingenious reclassification of Nazca pottery which may well prove to be the key to the spatial and 192 [2, 1952</page><page sequence="5">NOTES AND NEWS temporal divisions within the style. Bird has set aside the widely used Gayton-Kroeber classification into sub- types labelled A, B and Y, presumed to follow one another in that order. His new arrangement envisages a "Cat-demon" style (Gayton-Kroeber A and part of B) existing beside and contemporary with a "Cactus Man" style (part of B and some other materials). After a period of independent existence, the two styles merge. Still later, and growing out of the merged style, is a de- rived style showing Tiahuanaco influence (roughly the Gayton-Kroeber Y). The equivalences given here with the Gayton-Kroeber classification are actually somewhat misleading, as Bird's classificatory criteria are entirely different and the two systems are not properly compa- rable. Bird's Nazca classification still needs much testing, but it is the most promising development in the Nazca problem in many years, and any Peruvianist who can make an opportunity to study the new exhibit should do so and give the matter some thought. Richard P. Schaedel reports from Lima that a new Peruvian law provides for some decentralization of the government supervision of archaeological excavation in favor of the newly established regional museum and research center at Ica. The administrator of this center will have effective control over arrangements for excava- tions on the south Coast, and as the Ica authorities are eager to see some scientific archaeology done in their area, they would welcome proposals from qualified arch- aeologists for new field work in their jurisdiction. Schae- del, whose current address is Gonzales Larrafiaga 122, Miraflores, Lima, Peru, will be glad to furnish further details to anyone interested. PANAMA. Gordon R. Willey, J. N. East, and C. R. McGimsey, all of Peabody Museum, Harvard University, excavated several sites in western Panama during the period of January through April, 1952. In this work Willey was following up leads from the 1948 Smithson- ian expedition into the same area, in which he had participated. The Monagrillo shell mound at the mouth of the Parita River was thoroughly excavated with a large yield of Monagrillo style pottery and numerous ground and chipped stone tools. Small camp sites of Cocle, or Cocle-related culture, were isolated at the site, and these proved to be clearly post-Monagrillo. This sequential relationship for western Panama, Mona- grillo followed by Cocle-related wares, is, however, a mere beginning for the region. There is, obviously, a time gap between Monagrillo and Cocle which has not yet been filled. The Harvard University party discovered a new ceramic complex in the area which they are nam- ing "Sarigua," but as yet this Sarigua style cannot be successfully fitted into any sequence picture. In addition to the Monagrillo and Sarigua excavations, stratitests were made in a deep (2.00 meters) Cocle-style refuse dump on the Santa Maria River. It is possible that some chronological information will be forthcoming from an anaylsis of the materials from these sites. In response to a query about Sarigua pottery, Willey adds: "Sarigua pottery is unpainted or unslipped. The ware is brown, thin, and quite hard. As a class it is thinner and harder pottery than anything else in the area. It probably approaches some of the fine Chiriqui wares in these qualities, but it is unlike Chiriqui in other characteristics. Vessel forms include collared jars or ollas. Decoration is by fine-line incision, punctation, and thin appliqu6 stripping." Mr. Morgan Smith, Mr. Robert Steinbach and Mr. Taizo Miake, students at Florida State University, are doing three months research in ethno-botany and arch- aeology in Panama. They are working mainly in the Guyami and Chono areas. Dr. Hale G. Smith, Florida State University, is making an archaeological and ethnological reconnaissance of the Greater and Lesser Antilles, northern South America and Panama. INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON THE STATUS OF ANTHROPOLOGY From June 9 to 20, 1952, the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research conducted an International Symposium on Anthropology at its headquarters in New York, to attempt an evaluation of the present status of anthropology in all its phases. Alfred L. Kroeber acted as its president. The Symposium climaxed six months of preparation by a planning committee composed of Kroeber, Bennett, Hoijer, Kluckhohn, Mandelbaum, Strong, and Washburn. This committee determined upon 50 subjects covering all the fields of anthropological research, then chose an authority in each field to pre- pare a comprehensive summary of present knowledge in that field, known as an "inventory paper." The au- thors were chosen, "not only for breadth of knowledge in their special fields, but for their ability to synthesize the work of others, and for their broad conception of anthropology as a whole." In addition to the 51 authors of 50 inventory papers (37 from the United States, 10 from other nations, 4 absent), another group of 34 persons was invited (17 from the United States, 15 from other nations, 2 absent). The second group included those chosen to act as chair- men of individual sessions, or as discussants, or simply to lend their brains and opinions to the proceedings as problems developed. Of 85 persons invited altogether, from 18 countries, all but six were able to attend. The inventory papers were submitted to the Foundation in April, mimeographed, and sent to all participants well in advance of the meeting. Thus it was not necessary to take up time listening to authors read their papers, and the entire ten days of sessions were devoted to criti- cal analysis and discussion. All discussion was recorded by stenotype and tape recorder. The proceedings are to be published by the University of Chicago Press: the inventory papers as Vol. I, and the discussions as Vol. II. Archaeologists will be par- ticularly interested in the following: two papers on 193</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Long-Range Dating (Oakley, Heizer); The Strategy of Culture History (Rouse); Old World Paleolithic (Mo- vius); Old World Neolithic (Childe); results of the his- torical approach in the New World, South America (W. C. Bennett), Mesoamerica (Caso), and Anglo- America (Krieger); Archaeological Theories and Inter- pretations, Old World (Grahame Clark), and New World (Willey); Historical Approach in Anthropology (Strong); Ecology (Bates); and Technological Aids (Rowe). The other papers and discussions cover a great range of subjects: primates, fossil man, race, historical and structural linguistics, style, evolution and progress, evo- lutionary theory, techniques in linguistics, techniques in psychology, interview techniques, genetics, universal cul- ture, folklore, culture and personality, acculturation, community study, national character, questions of value, strategy of physical anthropology, relation of anthro- pology to social sciences and humanities, applied human biology, growth and constitution; and applied anthro- pology in medicine, teaching, industry, and government (United States, British Africa, Netherlands, and United Nations). A final summary and integration was provided by Kroeber at the close of the sessions. While it can hardly be expected that all of these far- flung subjects, each with innumerable special problems of procedure and analysis, could be adequately reviewed even in the space of two weeks, such a stock-taking marks a most constructive forward step in the history of anthropological research. Two principal themes guided the discussions: What do we know now? What should be done next to increase our knowledge? The writers of inventory papers approached their sub- jects in a variety of different ways so that the results are somewhat difficult to compare. The papers by Heizer, Krieger, and Rowe, are catalogues of specific data, while others are general and philosophical in varying degrees. As examples of the interesting ideas sown throughout this group of studies, we might mention Oakley's classi- fication of relative and absolute dates into eight types, suggesting a technique which could be fruitfully applied to warn the reader of the basis on which a given date rests; and a distinction drawn by Rouse between "classes" (hypothetical groups of artifacts arrived at by sorting in the light of every conceivable descriptive ob- servation) and "types" (groups set up on the basis of selected criteria). Many of us have at some time or other set up "types" and then used them as if they were "classes." The discussion at the actual sessions of the Symposium tended to concern itself with theoretical questions and the interrelations of the different branches of anthro- pology. The fact that the field of archaeology overlaps at some point with every other branch of anthropology, even with linguistics, emerged quite clearly from the remarks presented. The Wenner-Gren Foundation, through its Director of Research, Paul C. Fejos, approached the Symposium idea with characteristic vigor and provided every conceivable facility, including the travel and living expenses of all participants. As a fitting close for the session, at the banquet on the last evening the participants honored Director Fejos for his effective labors in advancing anthropology during the past decade. 194 [2, 1952</page><page sequence="7">NOTES AND NEWS KIRK BRYAN MEMORIAL FUND The following communication, of interest to North American archaeologists as well as to geologists, has been received from H. T. U. Smith, Geology Department, University of Kansas, and is heartily endorsed by the editorial staff of American Antiquity: "Many friends of the late Professor Bryan have ex- pressed the wish that a suitable memorial to him be established. It is generally felt that an appropriate me- morial must be of lasting value and interest, should be aimed at stimulating work in the broad fields of research to which Professor Bryan contributed, and should repre- sent his wide circle of friends in the different sciences. After informal discussion with a representative group of friends, colleagues, and former students, it appears that the establishment of a fund to support a Kirk Bryan Award is the preferred means of providing for the de- sired type of memorial. "We are pleased to report that the Geological Society of America has agreed to administer a Bryan Memorial Fund, and to institute a Kirk Bryan Award, assuming this to be the plan which meets with general approval. It is intended that the award be made, at suitable inter- vals, for distinguished contributions to geomorphology or related fields in which Professor Bryan was actively in- terested. Provisional terms governing the memorial fund and the award include: "1. The Kirk Bryan Award will be made to the author or authors of a published paper of distinction ad- vancing the science of geomorphology or some NC At one of the sessions of Section H (Anthropology) of the American Association for the Advancement of Science at Philadelphia last December, attention was called to the fact that American scholars who are inter- ested in the archaeology of the Old World- classical archaeologists, anthropologists, Egyptologists, Near East- ern archaeologists, and others who approach the subject from a background of history, linguistics or fine arts- for the most part have little contact with one another. It was the consensus of the meeting that some simple and inexpensive organization might be formed to bring these people more in touch with one another and enable them to share information of value to them all. Some suggested activities were the preparation of a list or directory of the persons interested and the publication of annual bibliographies (selected and annotated) and annual reports of archaeological field work in all parts of Europe, Africa, Asia and Oceania and for all periods. Informal preliminary talks with many archaeologists later confirmed the impression that such an organization would be welcomed. related field, as Pleistocene geology. Preference will be given to younger men. "2. The award to the author of the selected paper will include a cash stipend for encouragement of re- search, of whatever magnitude is deemed appropri- ate by the Society; the amount may vary from time to time depending on the proceeds available from the Kirk Bryan Memorial Fund. "3. The recipient of the award will be selected by a committee appointed by the Society. "4. The award generally will be made annually, but in any particular year may be withheld if no suit- able paper is decided on, or if available funds are considered insufficient for the award. ... "5. The paper constituting the basis of the Award must fulfill the following requirements. a. The paper will deal with geomorphology or with a bordering field, but related to geomorphology. b. The paper will have been published not more than 5 years prior to its selection for the Award." It is thought that a fund of some $5,000 will make possible an award appropriate for its intended purpose. Contributions and pledges of up to $100 each have been received already. Support for the memorial fund is being solicited at this time. Contributions may be sent directly to the Geological Society of America, 419 West 117th St., New York 27, earmarked for the Kirk Bryan Memorial Fund. )TE For further exploration of this possibility, a committee has been formed, consisting of members appointed by five different organizations, as follows: Jotham Johnson (Archaeological Institute of America) Bruce Howe (American School of Prehistoric Research) Richard K. Beardsley (Section H of American Association for the Advancement of Science) Robert J. Braidwood (American Schools of Oriental Research) Lauriston Ward (American Anthropological Association) Chairman The first meeting of this committee was held early in July, 1952, and a statement of proposed plans will probably be mailed at a later date to a large list of persons who might be interested. The committee will welcome suggestions, which may be addressed to Lauris. ton Ward, Peabody Museum, Harvard University, Cam- bridge, Mass., or to any other member of the committee. 195</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY AMERICAN NAME SOCIETY This Society with a most remarkable purpose has just been organized. Some of our members will undoubtedly be interested. The sponsors include several persons known to archaeologists. "In Detroit last December a group of scholars met in a conference on Onomastics and voted to organize the American Name Society for the purpose of promot- ing and encouraging the study of place names, personal names and scientific and commercial nomenclature. The new Society plans to publish a quarterly devoted to articles on names written by members. "A Sponsoring Committee was appointed (their names are listed below). Elsdon C. Smith was elected President. A meeting will be held in December, 1952, in Boston, to complete the organization. "Those in the academic field, and others who are interested in the subject, are cordially invited to become members. The dues are: Active Member, $5.00; Sus- taining Member, $25.00; Library Member, $5.00; and Patron, $1,000.00. The first year will end December 31, 1953. "Dues should be sent to Professor Erwin G.
