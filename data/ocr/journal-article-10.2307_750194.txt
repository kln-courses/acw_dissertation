<plain_text><page sequence="1">A COUNTER-PROJECT TO BERNINI'S "PIAZZA DI SAN PIETRO" By Rudolf Wittkower Bernini's Piazza di San Pietro was such an ingenious and complicated piece of planning that it could not fail to arouse contemporary criticism. He had not only to deal with a vast number of practical architectural difficulties, he had also to provide for religious, liturgical and ceremonial requirements and last but not least to satisfy the taste of his time. Critics attacked him from all these angles according to their own points of view. There were two religious ceremonies which had primarily to be taken into account in the planning of the piazza. First, at Easter and on a few other important occasions the Pope blesses the people of Rome, assembled in the piazza, from the Loggia della Benedizione above the central door of the church. It is a blessing which symbolically includes the whole world : it is given urbi et orbi. To give the greatest effect to the benediction the piazza had not only to hold the maximum number of people but also as much of it as was possible had to be visible from the Loggia. Secondly, the papal blessing of pilgrims is not given from the same spot but from a window of the private papal apartment situated in the palace built by Domenico Fontana on the north side of the piazza (cf. P1. 2oc). From here also as much as possible of the piazza had to come into view. To these considerations there were others none the less vital to be added. For instance, the entrance to the papal palace, situated in the north-west corner of the piazza, had to be of dignified and imposing form. The church itself had to have an approach in keeping with its position at the centre of the Catholic world. Arcades, in front, were required for certain proces- sions, and in particular had to be suitable for the grand ceremonies which took place on the day of Corpus Christi; they were also needed as a protection against the weather not only for pedestrians but also for coaches. But it was mostly on theological grounds that Bernini's solution of these and other minor problems met with the greatest opposition. The attack, led by a particularly ruthless critic, who probably belonged to the most reactionary ecclesiastical circle of the time, can be reconstructed from a set of 25 drawings which have always been misinterpreted by modern scholars and have even been attributed to Bernini himself.' It is the purpose 1 Now in the Brandegee Collection (Faulk- ner Farm, Mass.). The set consists of 15 sheets, some containing one, some two drawings, in three different inks : greyish blue, dark blue and brown. White paper with a star-shaped water-mark, such as was much used in Rome in the mid 17th century. Size of paper varies, on average circa 17 cm. high, 36 cm. wide. Remounted and bound in the I9th century. In their present arrangement the drawings are preceded by a 19th century note on their provenance. From the Fabbrica di S. Pietro they passed into the possession of Luigi Vanvitelli, architect of the Fabbrica in the I8th century, who gave them to his assistant Andrea Vici. After 1899 they passed through the Corvisieri and Piancastelli Collections. As originals by Bernini first published by the owner A. Busiri-Vici, La Piazza di San Pietro nei secoli III, XIV, XVII.

PIETRO" 89 of this article to attempt a description and explanation of the procedure and arguments of this critic. His attitude is not purely destructive; for he puts forward counter-proposals with corrections for all the supposed mistakes of Bernini's project. The best method of approaching these drawings is to discuss them in their old sequence indicated by numbers in a 17th century hand.' Drawings I and 2 (Pl. I6a) are studies of human proportions drawn in relation to the faqade and the piazza of St. Peter's. In drawing I (left) the arms of the figure follow the shape of the piazza and are therefore broken and deformed; in drawing 2 (right) they are well made and stretch across the picture plane without following the lines of the architecture behind. The two figures are related to two different architectural projects : on the left is Bernini's piazza with the straight corridors, forming the almost quadrangular space (actually a trapezoid) in front of the church, and the oval of free-standing colonnades before it (cf. P1. I9e); whereas on the right the colonnades are directly connected with the fa?ade of St. Peter's and the quadrangular space is missing. In contrast to Bernini's single colossal order the arcades here are two-storied and lean against buildings behind them. It is evident that this plan is a counter-proposal directed against Bernini's ideas. Since the arms of the figure in front of Bernini's project are broken exactly where the corridors join the faqade on the one hand and the colonnades on the other, it is these corridors which seem here to be the main point of criticism. It is the aim of the next two somewhat enigmatic drawings (P1. I6b) to show why it was that the quadrangular space of Bernini's piazza was open to objection. Here the ground-plans of the projections of the first drawings are given. In drawing 3 (left) two segments of a circle, which the colonnades follow, join the facade and in the space between them six smaller segments are drawn in such a way that they fit exactly into it. These semicircles correspond in their pyramidal arrangement to a quartering in the coat-of-arms of Alexander VII during whose reign (1655-1667) the piazza was built. Thus Alexander VII is suggested by his monti-as the Italians call these armorial bearings. The top segment touches the wall at the entrance to the church, and on it stands in the ground-plan of St. Peter's2 the figure of Christ, bearing the stigmata, with his arms out- Ehrle, Norton, Encyclopedia Italiana, and others. Full bibliography in Brauer-Witt- kower, Die Zeichnungen des Gianlorenzo Bernini, 1931, p. 98, where the true character of these drawings was briefly pointed out. In spite of this, in recent publications the old attribution to Bernini has been revived, cf. G. Tardini, in Illustrazione Vaticana, VII, I936, p. 935 ff.; Luigi Tombolini Barzotti, La Basilica di S. Pietro in Vaticano nei simboli e negli elementi architettonici di Gianlorenzo Bernini, I937. Busiri-Vici published only 17 out of the 25 drawings, two more were published by Norton, Bernini and other Studies, 1914. The six drawings on our plates I8c, d, I9c appear here for the first time. 1 The present arrangement does not coin- cide with the numbers written on the drawings in the brown ink which was used in them. A few sheets are without old numbers. In the following study they have been inserted where they logically belong. 2 The two circles appearing to the West on either side of the transept and repeating the dominant motive of the critic's scheme may be suggestions for sacristies, which had not been built at that time, and in their positions may recall the Sun and the Moon in pictures of the Crucifixion.</page><page sequence="3">90 R. WITTKOWER stretched. According to tradition the cross-shaped basilica symbolizes Christ crucified.' The whole drawing now appears as a naive illustration of the words of the Psalmist (87, I) : "Fundamenta eius in Montibus sanctis." The general accepted New Testament parallel to this text is : "Tu es Petrus et super hanc petram aedificabo ecclesiam meam." (Matth. XVI, 18). This rebus-like design is thus based on the addition of the pun on the Chigi- monti to the pun on the word Petrus. In the colonnades, behind the small circles of the double columns, there appear, though hardly visible in reproduction, the sun on the left and the moon and stars on the right. These imply that the construction of the proposed circular piazza embraces the whole world, and the drawing should now be interpreted as representing the upper part of the globe on which the cross is erected. Thus the idea of the critic is to show that by directly joining a circular piazza to the fagade of St. Peter's an ideal relationship is formed on the one hand between Alexander VII and Christ and on the other between the Pope and the world. Such an arrangement would alone be suitable for the place where the word of Christ was preached to all mankind through the medium of the Papacy. In contrast to this the drawing opposite (4, right) with the plan of Bernini's piazza2 dispenses with all symbolical allusions. Instead a dotted line runs from the centre of the faqade past the corner of the northern meeting- point of the corridor and the colonnade to the centre of the oval part of the piazza. This line shows what parts of the piazza are not visible to the Pope from the Loggia della Benedizione, since they are screened by the protruding corners of the quadrangular space. This is the reason why this space is in dispute, and why the arms of the figure in drawing i are broken and deformed. The real meaning of this figure now becomes clear. The small curly beard is a characteristic feature of St. Peter, and the placing of the dome of his church like a mitre on his head make it certain that it is he who is represented. Only in drawing 2 can he embrace humanity with his blessing. This is expressed not only by the widely extended arms, but also by the emphasis on the dome and even more by the appearance of the Loggia della Benedizione through the lines of his mouth and of the entrance of the church in the centre of his neck. The implication here is that only in this plan -and not in that of Bernini where both Loggia and doorway are not drawn in-can the papal blessing be effectively given and access to the church itself be readily had. A dotted line making a wide segment connects the arcades with the top of the church to emphasize that in this project an ideal relation between the earthly (arcades) and the heavenly (dome) spheres is obtained through the successful intercession of the Pope. The ideal combination of the three spheres is not present in drawing I, where they are all deformed. The dome of St. Peter's is dwarfed, the mouth of St. Peter is distorted, and his arms are crippled. The harmony of the world is disturbed, and it is here impossible to draw an arc connecting Heaven and Earth. 1 Cf. below p. 102. 2 The principle of his structure appears in a schematic form.</page><page sequence="4">16 a-Left (i): Criticism of Bernini's plan.

PIETRO" 91 The correspondence in symbolism between the critic's projection (P1. I6a, right) and his plan (P1. I6b, left) is complete. In the projection Christ, Papacy and Humanity are envisaged in the dome of the church and in the mouth and the arms of St. Peter; in the plan they reappear in the figure of Christ, in the Chigi-monti and in the sun, the moon and the stars (the symbols of the world). This symbolism is used to show in the projection the ideal benediction, and in the plan its result, the raising of the cross upon Earth. In the light of this interpretation the next two drawings (5, P1. I6c) also become intelligible. The critic does not oppose a good and a bad project but sums up in purely symbolical language the line of' his argument up to this point. On the left the figure of St. Peter appears again-according to Matth. XVI, 19 : "and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven"-as the intercessor between Heaven and Earth, which are indicated by the curved dotted lines above' and below. On the right the cross, which recalls the plan of St. Peter's, is shown on the Orb. After this introduction dealing with general principles, a detailed elaboration of the criticism and of the alternative scheme follows. The most important drawing of the whole series, the view of the piazza looking towards the church2 (P1. I7a), repeats on a large scale the projection in drawing 2 (Pl. I6a). The two-storied arcades on double-columns are placed above a flight of steps which run round the whole piazza. At intervals the arcades are surmounted by towers, and towers also appear on the fagade of St. Peter's. On the right, behind the arcades, the group of buildings enclosing the Cortile di S. Damaso is visible, with Raphael's Loggie nearest the church and the square palace erected under Sixtus V to the right of them (cf. P1. 20oc). The arcades are attached to the palaces and to their lower extensions which are added by the draughtsman. A corresponding set of palaces is proposed for the southern side of the piazza. The following drawing (6, P1. 17b) shows a small section of the same project with an alternative arrangement for the arcades : the arcades of the ground floor now protrude, thus allowing for two covered passages instead of one. This project is supplemented by the next drawing (7, P1. I7c) which gives a view of the piazza facing the borghi.3 A systematisation of the Piazza Rusticucci-the square extending towards the city-and of the Borghi is obviously intended. Two parallel streets run into the Piazza Rusticucci, and the palaces surrounding it echo, in their arcades, the arrangement in the Piazza di S. Pietro itself. In these last three drawings the counter- project is set out at length. The next three drawings (8-io, P1. I8a, b) are concerned with the entrance to the Vatican. In 1617 the old entrance to it was replaced by the monumental tower of Ferrabosco (cf. P1. 3of).4 The difficulties of the 1 The five small circles on which the arc of Heaven appears to rest may indicate the five planets and may be connected with the Crown of Eternity, about which below p. o104. 2 Without an old number. 3 Large palaces corresponding to those on each side of St. Peter's are drawn in dotted lines behind the right-hand colonnades. This is an alternative proposal to the simpler drawn out arrangement. 4 For its history cf.

WITTKOWER site with its sloping ground prevented Ferrabosco from making a straight way through1 from his entrance to the old staircase leading from the church to the palace.2 At the time of the critic there was only one way of entering the palace; from Ferrabosco's Portone di Bronzo a long winding passage, after branching off to the right, led to the Cortile di S. Damaso. It was obviously necessary to make alterations here. In a first design (8) the critic shows a flight of steps as seen from the piazza (P1. I8a). In order to make his idea intelligible he draws a section of the back wall of the arcades without showing the arcades themselves. Next to the staircase is the guardroom of the Swiss soldiers which is indicated by a gun, armour and halberds. The plan of No. 9 with the Cortile di S. Damaso and the section of the arcades adjoining it, sets out the whole arrangement of this staircase (P1. I8b, left). Half-way up, the staircase divides into two flights which turn back and lead up to the level of the Cortile. At the same time the Cortile is made square by cutting off five bays from the western palace which contains Raphael's Loggie. The regular appearance which the Cortile would present from within is demonstrated in drawing Io (P1. I8b right). It represents a view facing the staircase, with its one central and two side flights. The Cortile is on a level with the second storey of the arcades of the piazza, and since this storey corresponds exactly in height with the ground floor of the surrounding palaces, the Cortile has an appearance of great uniformity. It is to be noticed that the open arcades3 allow a view on to the piazza, and that the entrance is surmounted by one of the towers which are repeated at regular intervals round the piazza. It is in this way that the difficult problem of creating an appropriate entrance to the palace was to be solved by the critic's new plan. The only part of the project which has not yet been dealt with in detail is the proposed alterations for the facade of St. Peter's, and the following two sheets of drawings are concerned with them. On the right half of drawing No. 12 (P1. I8c) are the five central bays, where the principal changes are in fact suggested. It was an old point of criticism that the facade was too wide and therefore appeared too low in relation to its height. For very sound reasons Bernini left it unaltered. But his critic wished to restore proportion in it by placing above the three central bays a second storey4 which was to be connected with the original attic by large scrolls on each side. It would serve the same purpose to remove the attic above the last bay as is to be seen in drawing No. 13 (P1. I8e). But the chief object of the drawing under discussion is to deal with the view from the Loggia della Benedizione. The existing rectangular Loggia has been altered 1 Cf. Egger, Carlo Madernas Projekt fiir den Vorplatz von San Pietro in Vaticano, I928, p. 14 ff. ("R6m. Forschungen der Bibl. Hertziana VI"), Brauer-Wittkower, op. cit., p. 89. 2 To make the Scala Regia Bernini took the bold step of connecting his corridor (which replaced Ferrabosco's tower) with the old staircase, and thereby gave the palace its superb entrance in direct line with the Borgo Nuovo. It was an arrangement of great ingenuity which was probably planned after the critic's counter-project. Cf. p. 99. 3 They are detached from the palaces only at this particular spot. 4 This storey would at the same time hide the drum. Cf. below p. 95.</page><page sequence="8">A COUNTER-PROJECT TO BERNINI'S "PIAZZA DI S. PIETRO" 93 in such a way as to protrude in a semi-circle beyond the columns at each side of it. This point is stressed in another drawing on the back of No. 15 (P1. i8d), where the central portion alone, with the projecting Loggia supported by two atlanti, is shown on larger scale. Further explanation of the critic's intention is supplied by the two accompanying plans. In No. i i (P1. I8c, left) the old rectangular Loggia is indicated by dotted lines, while in the gap between the walls in the centre there is a human eye, from which two dotted lines radiate touching the circumference of the columns. These lines show that in the old Loggia the Pope, who has to sit almost in the entrance to the balcony, cannot see those parts of the piazza which are hidden by columns. The new protruding Loggia would allow his throne, actually drawn in here, to be moved forward to a position on the central axis of the columns, and the two dotted lines radiating from another eye placed in the throne make it obvious that the problem of visibility could be overcome in this way. The same proposal is shown, again on a larger scale, in the second plan without, however, repeating the point of criticism (P1. I8d, left). Allegory, which is extensively used throughout, also plays a great part in the alterations of the fagade. He places in the broken pediment, which he designs for the centre, the most important relic of Old St. Peter's, Giotto's Navicella, showing the ship of the Church which braves every storm through the faith of the Apostles. Above it he repeats the main theme of the whole series : St. Peter with outstretched arms in a circle, expressing, as before, the all-embracing power of the Papacy. The next drawing (13) (P1. I8e) is a modification of the critic's own plan, apparently to demonstrate that the essential features of his project could be preserved on a smaller scale at considerably less expense. It chiefly involves making the arcades one storey high and dropping his scheme for the Cortile di San Damaso. The building, with Raphael's Loggie in it, is left untouched (though only 12 bays are given in the drawing instead of 13-presumably a slip of the draughtsman) and the arcades of the piazza run through the end of it. The first project is modified throughout, and among the many changes are the reduction in size of the towers on the arcades and the omission of lateral towers on the fagade of St. Peter's. The critic's counter-proposals end here and in the next three drawings (14-16) he returns to a still more detailed consideration of Bernini's project, though No. 14 (P1. I8f) does not in fact correspond to Bernini's final plan. It differs from it in three respects : (I) the colonnade has only one passage- way and not three, and (2) is made up of arcades instead of columns bearing a straight cornice, while (3) Ferrabosco's tower (cf. Pl. 3of) which surmounted the entrance to the Vatican between 1617 and i659, when Bernini finally decided to demolish it, still appears above the corridor. The critic is dealing here with an earlier project by Bernini which contained all these elements,' and he obviously wishes to show that it was not too late at this stage to alter Bernini plans and adapt them to his own scheme;2 for he has drawn the 1 Cf. below, p. 99. 2 For reasons which will be given below (p. Io1) he insists on arcades, and as long as a single colonnade was planned it could still be attached to palaces.</page><page sequence="9">94 R. WITTKOWER outline of his circular plan in dotted lines above and behind Bernini's colonnade. In drawings 15 and 16 (P1. I8g) Bernini's colonnades appear in their final state.' In both cases the criticism turns to the problems of the view from the piazza of the Pope's private apartment and of the fagade and the dome of St. Peter's. The left-hand drawing which gives the whole arm of the colonnades shows two figures in the piazza. One of them seems to move along a line towards the church, while the other looks up to the papal palace. From the head of the second figure two dotted lines lead up to the front corner of the building, one ending immediately below, the other above the end window of the first storey. This must be the window from which the Pope blessed pilgrims, and the lines indicate that a man standing even at this point in the piazza could not see it, for the upper line marks the lowest point in his view, while the lower line shows that the view of the window is screened by the roof of the colonnades through which it runs. The figure is placed on this spot for special reasons, since it is from this point that a pilgrim, entering the piazza from the north through the central passage of the colonnades, would have his first full view of the facade of St. Peter's. This is indicated by the two dotted lines crossing in front of the figure. One of the lines running from east to west starts at the beginning of the colonnades, passes the end of the corridor and finishes at the corner of the faqade; the other going from north to south retraces the steps of the figure from a doorway outside the colonnade. This doorway, which is still in existence to-day, gives access to the quarters of the Swiss guards. The critic must have been acquainted with Bernini's scheme for planning at this point on the central axis of the colonnades a large roadway for pilgrims approaching the church from the north. This roadway which in fact was to follow an old pilgrim's way2 would have brought foreign pilgrims to the centre of the piazza without their having to pass through the city. Bernini's plans for this were well advanced and, in addition to sketches and other evidence, there exists a large-scale working drawing,3 about 7 feet long, in which a straight line indicates the road and shows exactly what alterations were needed (P1. 2oa). The problem of the view of the palace is again dealt with in the right- hand drawing (16). Here only half of the colonnade, on a larger scale, is given. As the dotted line running from left to right suggests, it is a section of it drawn on the central axis of the piazza where pilgrims were to pass through the colonnade from the new road. The figure is now placed nearer the colonnade than in No. 15, and therefore the dotted line leading up to the palace ends not at the top of the window of the first storey but below the window of the storey above it. Again there is special significance 1 The Corinthian capitals, never planned by Bernini, are probably due to the careless- ness of the draughtsman. 2 It had been closed by Pius V (1566-1572) and replaced by the road further to the east running through Porta Angelica. Access to the piazza from this road to an insignificant point of the north-eastern colonnades was very unsatisfactory. For the whole problem cf. Brauer-Wittkower, op. cit., p. 83. 3 Bibl. Vaticana, without inventory number. Probably made by Carlo Fontana, Bernini's assistant at that time.

PIETRO" 95 in the position of the figure; for at this point a pilgrim standing before the entrance to the palace would, according to the critic, have a poor view of the church, since it is badly obscured by the colonnade. Another dotted line shows that the drum of the dome is completely hidden from the view of the pilgrim, and in the left-hand drawing the dotted line rising from the figure walking towards St. Peter makes the same point. While from the position of this figure, which is not half-way into the piazza, the whole of the fa?ade is visible, the lower part of the drum still remains hidden behind the attic of the fa?ade. Finally, in this drawing the critic returns to two questions which he has already raised. The dotted line starting from a very small figure-hardly visible in the reproduction-standing in front of the entrance to St. Peter's, at a point where the rectangle and the oval part of the piazza meet, indicates that from this position only the roof of the papal palace is visible since the corridor intervenes. Another line running from the door of the church past the corner of the corridor marks out the section of the oval piazza which cannot be seen from the doorway of St. Peter's. Considering that these drawings were made before the erection of the colonnades, it is clear that the critic was a man of considerable perspicacity and foresight. It is true that pilgrims have to go well into the piazza to have a view of the window from which the Pope gives his blessing; this is shown by a photograph, taken at the Benediction of the Alpini in 1929, in which the right half of the piazza is empty despite the fact that the Pope appears at a window in the second storey (P1. 2oc). It is also true that at no point in the piazza is the drum of the dome completely visible, and as one approaches the church the dome sinks down from view behind the vast mass of the fagade. Bernini himself tried in vain to find a remedy for this weakness which was due to Maderna, the architect of the nave and the fagade of St. Peter's. The critic's solution consists in raising his second storey above the centre of the faqade so that the drum of the dome would be entirely obscured (P1. I8c). In drawing 16 from the point of view of the figure the extent of the disappearance of the fa?ade behind the colonnade is much exaggerated; for the view here is not, in fact, taken from the position of the figure but from a point just within the piazza at the central passage of the colonnade. The fault, then, lies not in the treatment of the architecture but in the placing of the figure which is very weakly drawn in. Moreover, the draughtsman of the architecture with his remarkable sense of space would never have put his figure in the adjacent drawing. It can only, therefore, be concluded, here as elsewhere in this series of drawings, that two different hands were at work: probably an architect and an amateur, the one preparing the ground for the additions of the other. 1 This is supported by similar observations which can be made throughout the series of drawings. Some instances may be quoted. In drawing I those portions vital for the exposition of the criticism-the face of St. Peter and the broken parts of the arms-- are drawn over by a clumsy hand. The visuale of drawing 3 is drawn with the same ink; both drawings in No. 5 seem to be by this hand, the figure of St. Peter being slavishly copied from No. 2. The same hand is responsible for the small steps interrupting the large circle of steps in the view of the piazza facing the church (P1. I7a) and for</page><page sequence="12">96 R. WITTKOWER Whereas the last two drawings were mainly concerned with the problems of the approach to St. Peter's from the north, the subject of the next two drawings, in which the critic confronts Bernini's solution with his own scheme (without Nos., P1. 19a), is the access to the church from the city through the main street of the Borgo, the Borgo Nuovo. In the left-hand drawing the fagade of the church has been altered and the lateral tower added according to the critic's project, while in the right-hand drawing the fagade appears untouched as Bernini decided to leave it. According to the-critic the tower would provide a suitable focal point in the view from the Borgo Nuovo. But this is not his principal 'improvement.' In his project, next to the fagade at the far end of the street are two one-storied arcades corresponding to his 'modified' project (No. 13, P1. i 8e); in the same position in Bernini's plan there is the entrance to the palace surmounted by Ferra- bosco's tower. The argument of the critic here is made clear in the two rather puzzling sketches which appear in the upper half of the drawings. His own project is accompanied by the old symbol of Eternity, the snake biting its own tail. As is the case with drawings 3 and 4 (P1. I6b) the critic on the one hand underlines the symbolism of his own project, and on the other draws attention to the 'mistake' in Bernini's plan. Thus the little drawing of the Borgo above Bernini's perspective supplies the point of his criticism, which appears to be the isolation of Bernini's entrance to the palace. The presence of Ferrabosco's tower shows that the critic has again Bernini's earlier project (No. 14, P1. 18f) in mind, for he was apparently not in a position to know what Bernini's final plans were to be. The critic maintained that the closed view at the far end of the Borgo gave no indication of the presence of an enormous piazza opening out between the Borgo and the entrance, nor even a hint of its form and character. But in his own plan the two coordinated arcades seem to be part of an endless sequence so that there is a clear suggestion of the existence of a large piazza. This suggestion is emphasized by the distance between the two arcades and the last houses of the street, whereas in Bernini's plan the entrance to the palace had perforce to be drawn nearer to the end of the street. And so the symbol of the snake stands for the continuity of the arcades of a circular piazza, the erection of which would symbolically be in keeping with the idea of the eternity of the Church. Now that the critic has produced all his reasons for considering Bernini's plans inadequate as to the giving of the benedictions from St. Peter's and from the palace, the view of the church from the piazza, and the approach from the country and from the city, and has put forward his own project with solutions for all these questions, he sums up in a last symbolical drawing the whole trend of his ideas. Here (No. 17, P1. I9b) the complete circle of his piazza is drawn out with naive indications of the towers on the arcades. Inscriptions indicate not only the four points of the compass but also the positions of buildings and gates corresponding to their actual sites.1 The the repetition of the right-hand palaces on the other side.

PIETRO" 97 ideal character of the circular piazza finds its symbolical expression in an ideal figure which, with outstretched limbs, touches the circle at four points. On the arms and legs are the names of the four parts of the world, and so the figure becomes an ideal representation of the inhabitants of the earth; in this connection the four points of the compass may be taken as evidence that the circle of the piazza symbolizes the orb. Europe and Asia, together the home of the Faith, are significantly placed on the side of St. Peter's, while the arm of Europe points to the entrance to the palace. Here the symbolism, begun in the first drawings, is made complete. Whilst ideal figures of Christ (No. 3) and the Papacy (No. 2) illustrated the perfection of the scheme in the first drawings, now the figure of Humanity is brought in to round it off. Thus the three forces embodying the order of the world form the basis on which the critic built up his counterproject. Attached to the series of architectural drawings is a sheet of the same size and of the same paper' with two designs for a sculptural group of "Religione Christiana" (P1. I9c). The subject of the group is explained by inscriptions written by the same hand as those in No. i7. In the left- hand drawing the representation of "Religione Christiana" slavishly follows the description in Ripa's Iconologia:2 her head is surrounded by rays, one breast is uncovered and she is winged; her left arm rests on a cross, from one of the arms of which hangs a horse's bit, while she holds up a book in her right hand and treads a skeleton under foot. The four cardinal virtues carry a globe on which she is seated. They too are completely taken from Ripa; of Prudence and Temperance, the two virtues on the side out of view, only the symbols are indicated : stag, lance, and fish belonging to the former, and elephant and reins to the latter. In the right-hand drawing the alternative design for "Religione Christiana" is less closely connected with Ripa, while of the Four Parts of the World, on which the globe now rests, Africa and America are the only two visible, with their symbols again coming from Ripa. The ground-plan (No. I7) shows that this group was intended for the centre of the piazza. Three monuments are marked in the central axis of the human body : under the chest the obelisk is clearly indicated, with the fountain below, as can be deduced from plate 19d.3 It is in accordance with the critic's standpoint to place between them in the centre in a sculptural group the Cross above the Orb as the key to his architectural scheme. * * * This series of drawings was, no doubt, enigmatic even at the time when they were produced. They were only intelligible in connection with a treatise which in all probability they were drawn to illustrate. There was, in fact, a long tradition in treatises of this kind. Whenever and wherever an important architectural work was proposed the voice of criticism was generally raised in this way. It had been used against Bernini himself about 1 Bears the No. 17, like the last drawing, although written by the same hand. 2 Ed. Padua I630, Parte terza, p.

WITTKOWER 15 years earlier, when in 1645 Innocent X was considering the problem of the tower on the faqade of St. Peter's. On that occasion no less than eight different architects expressed their opinions in drawings accompanied by memoranda.? The same method of criticism was not uncommon in France; Colbert ordered the public exhibition of Le Vau's plans for the Louvre and asked the architects of Paris for their criticism. Perrault comments on this : "Presque tous les architectes blmimbrent le dessein de M. le Vau, et en firent la critique dans des m6moires qu'ils donnerent. Plusieurs meme apporterent des desseins de leur invention."' The responsible body for the fabric of St. Peter's was the Congregazione della Fabbrica,3 a committee set up by Leo XI in I6o05 and consisting of a number of cardinals who met regularly to consider the progress of work in hand, the next steps to be taken, together with counter-proposals and objections. All criticism had to be submitted to this committee and, though evidence of their proceedings is not very extensive, it provides proof that there were heated arguments over Bernini's plans for the piazza. Bernini himself read an explanation for his first project which he submitted to the Congregazione on August I9th, 1656.4 And at the same meeting Cardinal Pallotto, a leading member of the body, made observations on Bernini's project in a memorandum that still exists. He objected principally to its excessive size and urged that there should not be so much expenditure on a building which had only an ornamental value.5 Two other memoranda by unknown authors were submitted to the Congregazione on March 17th, 1657. One of them criticized Bernini's project at that stage-not yet the final one-above all from an aesthetic point of view, and the author's own idea for suitable arcades is added in a drawing (P1. 20od). The other emphasizes practical and ritual considerations.6 There are two more treatises in existence which cannot, however, be related to a definite meeting of the committee, and are to be taken as answers by Bernini's supporters to criticisms of his plans. In the first of these7 Alexander VII himself is made responsible in laudatory terms for the choice of the final oval plan-a clever method of flattering the Pope and silencing opponents at the same time. The second is directed against attacks on the free-standing triple colonnade, Bernini's outstanding innovation, and shows, with the familiar display of 17th century erudition, that with it Bernini returns to Greek tradition.8 1 For the whole story of these discussions cf.

PIETRO" 99 To these memoranda are to be added a few drawings without text, of which those surviving have always been attributed to Bernini himself although their critical character seems to be obvious.' There is thus ample evidence for establishing the original purpose of the series of drawings discussed in this article; undoubtedly at one time they formed the illustrations to a memorandum submitted to the Congregazione della Fabbrica. It can even be shown within a few months when this took place. At a meeting of the Congregazione on March 17th, 1657, Bernini presented a project based on the oval plan with a single passage-way of colonnades and preserving Ferrabosco's tower.2 This is the project to which drawing 14 (P1. I8f) in the series refers.3 But as the critic knew Bernini's final plan (Nos. I5, 16, P1. I8g), which did not take shape till the spring of 1659, it is evident that he was familiar with all the different stages in its develop- ment. In March, 1659, the construction of the right (northern) side of the colonnades was begun.4 At about the same time a large engraving by Bonacina illustrating Bernini's final project was published.5 Now in this engraving there appear projecting double columns on the central axis of the colonnades, both within and without the piazza. The presence of the double columns on the outside of the colonnades at this point was reasonable as long as Bernini needed a point de vue for his newly planned road which was to lead up to the central axis of the piazza.6 One detail is very instructive: the existing preparatory drawing for the engraving,7 passed by the papal censor for reproduction, does not show the columns on the outer circumference. It is, therefore, justifiable to conclude that the idea of the new road occured to Bernini early in 1659, between the preparation and the execution of the engraving.8 Since the critic was, as has been shown,9 acquainted with Bernini's plan for the road, his memorandum cannot have been finished before the spring of 1659. Nor can it have appeared much later. A plan which involved vital alterations is unlikely to have been produced after the beginning of the actual construction in March of that year; moreover, it has already been noticed that the critic had no knowledge of Bernini's ingenious solution for the entrance to the palace.'0 The planning of the Scala Regia had not been begun when the Bonacina engraving was published, but it seems to have been fully developed by the late summer of 1659.11 It is therefore clear that the critic's memorandum was intended as a last and powerful appeal to the Congregazione before construction of the piazza was started in the spring of 1659. It remains to be considered who this critic was. The answer to this 1 Discussion of this material ibid., p. 96 ff. 2 Ibid., p. 71 ff. 3 In Bernini's project the joining of the corridor and the tower must however have been different from the careless represent- ation of the critic.

WITTKOWER question is, curiously enough, not made easier by the fact that a name appears in an inscription on one of the drawings. The right-hand drawing on the sheet with the two sculptural groups (P1. I9c) bears the inscription "Constanzo de Peris inventore" written in the moulding at the top of the pedestal. There are reasons, which will later became clear, for believing that this artist was throughout only the executant of the critic's ideas.' The identity of Constanzo de Peris remains a complete riddle; his name appears neither in contemporary writings nor in any document connected with the history of the piazza. It is, however, possible to reconstruct with more or less certainty the tradition and atmosphere in which the critic's ideas and plans originated, and thus to put forward a suggestion as to the possible spiritus rector of the counterproposal. The core of the whole problem lies in the question of the giving of the blessing both from the church and from the palace, which was, indeed, much discussed during the planning of the piazza. The benediction from the church was still considered 30 years later, as is shown in the standard work on St. Peter's by Carlo Fontana who, as Bernini's assistant, had first-hand knowledge of all its implications. In a plan of the church and the piazza2 (P1. i9e) he marks in dotted lines : (i) the visuale from the centre of the church ("Linea visuale della Loggia della Benedizione") in order to point out the parts of the piazza which are out of view, (2) an oval, the longer axis of which is on the axis of the church ("figura elipse che haverebbe assegnato il perfetto modo dei portici"), and (3) visuali to show that this oval would have given a complete view of the whole of the piazza. But Fontana states that a realisation of the 'right' project was impossible because it would have involved the destruction of the papal palace.3 As to the benediction from the palace, in the memorandum, written in Bernini's defence between 1657 and 1659, the rejection of his first rectangular project, which would have given a full view of the piazza, and the preference for the existing oval form, are explained as being due to the desire to bring the piazza as near as possible to the palace.4 Even in one of the memoranda directed against Bernini this point is favourably mentioned.5 Baldinucci 1 Even if Constanzo was asked to base his drawing of "Religione Christiana" upon Ripa, he could still claim to be the "inven- tore." 2 Carlo Fontana, Templum Vaticanum, I694, P1.

PIETRO" o101 too in his life of Bernini, which is based on direct information from the artist's circle, repeats this reason for the choice of the existing oval.x Finally there are two drawings which are also concerned with these problems. They show plans which are nearly identical : both are more or less octagonal, one with straight, the other with curved sides.2 The lay-out of these plans is perfectly adapted to ritual requirements; for the visuali from the centre of the church prove that the whole of the piazza is in view, and at the same time its northern side touches the papal palace. The distinctly critical character of these projects is made evident by the abundance of visuali which demonstrate that here the obelisk does not obscure views from focal points as it does in Bernini's scheme. Just as the problem of the giving of the papal blessing was a much argued question, so all the other points raised by the critic were subject of great discussion before he produced his counter-project. A circular piazza had already been proposed in the reign of Innocent X by Carlo Rainaldi.3 This plan, which Rainaldi seems substantially to have repeated under Alexander VII in competition with Bernini, must have strongly influenced the critic since it includes single arcades attached to buildings and the systematization of the Borgo-both features also adopted by the architect of the two visuali-plans. Bernini himself had started by basing his plans on the traditional scheme of attaching arcades to palaces.4 And criticism was naturally aroused as soon as he departed from this tradition.5 In addition to this both aesthetic and practical arguments were brought against Bernini; isolated columns were not considered sufficiently imposing6 and his freestanding colonnades were thought to be no adequate protection against rain and sun. The design of the specimen arcade added to one of the memoranda directed 1 Vita del Cavaliere Cio. Lorenzo Bernino, 1682, p. 38. 2The latter in Bibl. Vaticana, cod. Chig.

Pius II (1458-64) inaugurated the construction of arcades which, however, came to an end with the three-storied Loggia della Benedizione (cf. P1. 30i). This frag- ment, existing until the days of Maderna's fagade never ceased to influence later pro- jects. 6 The memoranda submitted at the meeting of the Congregazione on March 17th, 1657 (in criticism of Bernini's project for a single arcade with one pilaster dividing two arches), argued that "i pilastri nella forma designata in una piazza cosi vasta, possino apparire meschini, e che col dupplicarsi fossero per riuscire di maggiore magnifi- cenza."

WITTKOWER against Bernini was intended to overcome these difficulties (P1. 2od). It may be noted that the critic adopted a similar type of arcade (P1. i7), so that in this respect also he followed proposals made by others before him. It is the same with the problem presented by the faqade of St. Peter's. Since the substructures' of Maderna's towers remained unused, they became part of the fagade and gave it its unsatisfactory breadth. For two generations the best brains tried to correct this fault. The catastrophe of Bernini's tower is well known. Structural conditions made the erection of towers almost impossible. Bernini, therefore, in his project for the piazza abandoned all alterations in the faqade and endeavoured to give the impression of increased height by attaching to it his long and comparatively low corridors.2 Regardless of the structural difficulties the critic sticks to the old demand for towers. Here as with his other alterations for the facade -the heightening of the centre and the removal of the attic at the sides- he follows in the steps of Carlo Rainaldi.3 Even the critic's symbolism strikes a familiar note. The parallelism between the body of Christ and the church is almost as old as Christianity itself.4 But only in the interpretation of the Middle Ages does the choir become the symbol of the head of Christ, the transept that of his outstretched arms, and the nave that of his body and legs.5 This symbolism was always kept alive in connection with St. Peter's. Manetti, in his description of the buildings planned by Nicolas V,6 compares the plan of the new St. Peter's with the limbs of the human body, and under Clement VIII (i595) the centrally planned buildings of Bramante and Michelangelo are condemned because they do not symbolize the body of Christ crucified.7 The use of punning in coats-of-arms is a typical feature of the Baroque age. There are frequent examples of Pope Alexander's coat-of-arms used in a symbolical setting,8 but the most significant application of this occurs in the foundation medal of the piazza of August 28th, I657,9 which bears the motto taken from Psalm 87 : "Fundamenta eius in Montibus sanctis." 1 I. e. the end bay on each side of the fagade. 2 Cf. Bernini's own words in Chantelou's Journal du voyage du Cav. Bernini en France. Publie par L. Lalanne, 1888, p. 42, and the words of his memorandum (Brauer-Witt- kower, p. 70) : "il formare un Portico non solo apportava maggior bellezza e decoro al Tempio mit veniva a coprire molte imper- fettioni di quello, essendo che la facciata che per se stessa 6 di forma quatta haverebbe spiccata, et in certo modo si sarebbe sollevata sopra se stessa." 3 Cf. his project Brauer-Wittkower, P1. i89c. 4 Col.

PIETRO" o03 This verse, apparently proposed by the learned humanist Luca Holstenius,x was chosen by Alexander because of its special bearing on the laying of foundation stones; for bishops had to recite it on these occasions according to a tradition going back through the Middle Ages to Rabanus Maurus.2 But it is obvious that Alexander himself realized the special connection between the "holy Mountains" and his armorial bearings. What, therefore, the critic did in drawing 3 (Pl. I6b) is no more than to use this idea, which had papal approval, as a warning to the Pope himself. The drawing then acquires a special significance; for it suggests that the Pope's own desire -that Christ's foundation is in the holy Mountains-can only find fulfilment in the scheme proposed by the critic. By this manoeuvre the critic attempts to influence the Pope himself, who was about to accept Bernini's project. But this is not all; the critic actually intends to defeat Bernini with his own weapons. It is well known, that Bernini was fond of comparing the faqade of St. Peter's with the body, and the colonnades with the arms of a man. He reveals this during his stay in Paris in 1665 in conversation about the experiments he made when planning the piazza.3 One of his drawings of about 1667, concerned with the removal into the Piazza Rusticucci of the central portion of the colonnades, which in fact was never built, actually represents, though in a cursory way, the dome as the head, the fagade as the body and the colonnades as the arms of a man.4 In his memorandum against his critics, probably written in I658 and not later than 1659, he even compares the oval colonnades to the motherly arms of the Church, "which embrace Catholics to reinforce their belief, heretics to reunite them with the church, and Agnostics to enlighten them with the true faith;"5 in a word, he suggests that his piazza is a symbol of all humanity. The critic's drawings contradict this claim. But Bernini's language is fundamentally different from that of his critic. Whether he represents the piazza as a man or calls the colonnades the arms of the Church, his comparisons are no more than similes, meant in a meta- phorical sense; this is the anthropomorphic approach towards architecture, which had existed in Italy since the time of Alberti. In order to justify his architectural design he connects human proportions and features to it. The critic on the other hand is completely absorbed in mediaeval symbolism which implied that the arrangement of his plan is dependent on an external correspondence between the symbolical idea and the architectural form.6 1 Bibl. Vat., cod. Chig. R. VIII. c. i, f. Io contains the draft of a letter by Alexander VII to Holstenius with a sketch of the foundation medal at the top and the following words below : "Cosi stark il medaglione per porre nel fondamento del Portico triplice trionfale et fara la piazza, e condurrai a coperto a S. Pietro. Nella Cartella sotto vi capiranno sei o sette parole cioe da 40 in 50 lettere. V. S. pensi, e me le mandi secondo il suo gusto, se pu6 in piii forme . . ." 2 Cf. Sauer, op. cit., p. I 14 f.

WITTKOWER The critic's conception consists not simply of a mosaic of various symbolical details put together to suit his own purposes; it is based rather on a much repeated theological theme which he revives in an odd manner. Mediaeval writers from Honorius Augustodunensis to Durandus' refer to two forms which are alone possible for a church : the cross-shaped and the circular. The former, a symbol of the Cross, implies that the faithful are "to tread in the steps of the Crucified according to the word : If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me."2 The latter would "signify that the Church has been extended throughout the circle of the world, according to the Psalmist (XVIII, 5) : "And their words to the end of the world-et in fines orbis terrae verba eorum." Yet this form not only symbolizes the propagation of the Faith throughout the world, but also means "that from the circle of this world we reach forth to the crown of eternity-quod de circulo orbis, perveniemus ad circulum coronae eternitatis." It is obvious that the critic intended to combine the symbolism of these two basic forms for church-building in the central monument of Christianity: the church and the piazza of St. Peter's. For this he had a special justification. His piazza is the circulum orbis, for Christ's word is spoken from the Loggia della Benedizione in fines orbis terrae; the circulum coronae aeternitatis which is here symbolized by the dome of St. Peter's is thus reached. The puzzling segments of circles in drawing 5 (P1. I6c) now become completely clear : St. Peter, speaker of the verba eorum, mediates between the circulum orbis and the circulum coronae aeternitatis. If final proof that the critic based his conception on these texts is needed, it is to be noted that above the head of St. Peter appears in pencil a wreath (the circulum coronae) and above this the outline of the dome.3 An allusion to the relation of the circulum orbis to the circulum coronae aeternitatis appears in the symbol of Eternity in plate i9 a as well as in the placing of St. Peter in the circle on the fagade (P1. I8c). The crucified Christ in the church had to be shown according to this text, as well as the figure of man as a symbol of those "who come from the four parts of the world."4 The critic went back to mediaeval symbolism for the unity of conception on which he based the abstruse elaboration of his architectural scheme. This curious visual translation of mediaeval thought has itself a prototype in the 7th century from which the critic drew inspiration. At the beginning of the century an eccentric Roman dilettante, the doctor iuris utriusque Papirio Bartoli,5 was engaged on plans for the church and piazza of St. Peter's, on which he spent much time and even more money without any practical result. His favourite project, described in a detailed memorandum and his purpose is completely different; whilst in Leonardo the circle surrounding the figure is evidence of certain fundamental pro- portions in the human body, in the critic's drawing (No. I7) the figure illustrates the ideal character of his circular scheme. 1 Sauer, op. cit., p.

In the bow of the ship appears the figure of St. Paul, while St. Peter is the pilot with the tiller under his arm. In front of St. Peter is the Cathedra, the throne of the Popes, while above the tomb of the Apostles is the papal altar, surmounted by a huge crucifix on the upright shaft of which the whole passion is shown in the same way as the reliefs on Trajan's column. This crucifix forms the mast of the ship on which the sail is fixed. The whole theme, the symbolism of which is much more elaborate than has been suggested here, is based on the Apostolical Constitutions.2 It is evident enough from this that the critic in his naive translation of mediaeval symbolism followed Papirio Bartoli. Now Bartoli also left a project for the piazza (P1. 20ob) in which there are a great number of features which reappear in the critic's counter-proposal. The arcades are attached to palaces, faqade and arcades are joined together in very similar ways, there is also in each case the same solution for the entrance to the Cortile di San Damaso as well as the same idea for towers above the fagade;3 and finally, and above all, the semicircular Loggia della Benedizione occurs in both schemes. Papirio had a nephew, also a doctor in the two laws, who was the faithful apostle of his uncle's beliefs in matters of art.4 It may be suggested that the nephew is the critic behind our series of drawings, made more than 35 years after his uncle's plan had been engraved. Living in the curious world of Papirio Bartoli, he must have followed with keen interest all the stages of the planning of the piazza under Alexander VII, and finally reissued the old project of his uncle, though taking into consideration all the points raised during the years preceding construction. Whoever the critic may have been, he was acquainted with the whole range of symbolical thought which had come down from the past, and therefore his proposals, speculative and fantastic though they were, were not likely to pass unnoticed in reactionary circles among the clergy. A small picture by an unknown painter,5 which shows a view looking towards the Borgo identical with the critic's drawing 7 (P1. I9d), provides proof that his project made a definite impression in his own time. There was, nevertheless, not the slightest chance of its supplanting Bernini's plans; for it was by no means practical. The extent of the critic's scheme is much larger in size than that of Bernini, and its execution would have involved not only the demolition of parts of the papal palace and certain buildings in front of it-including the small but important Cortile di Maresciallo and the quarters of the Swiss Guard,-not only the erection of enormous palaces on the southern side of the piazza together with a complete 1 By Matthaeus Greuter, I623. 2 Cf.

IoI, note 5). 4 The engraving of the mystical ship bears the legend : "Delineavit Dims Simon eius ex fratre Nepos J. V. D. per M. Greuterum are incidi curavit. I623." It is probable that the engraving of the piazza was also ordered by him, after his uncle's death, in about I620. 5 On parchment. Rome, Palazzo Venezia.

WITTKOWER reconstruction of the Borgo, but it would also have meant the removal of vast masses of earth to level out the slope on the northern side and, as a result, the risk of undermining the buildings round the Cortile di San Damaso. The subtleties of the counter-project were effective only on paper; practical issues had in no way been taken into consideration, and it was not long before the critic had been completely forgotten and his project properly shelved.</page></plain_text>
