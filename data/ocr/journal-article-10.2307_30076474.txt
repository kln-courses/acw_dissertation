<plain_text><page sequence="1">Christa-Maria Lerm Hayes James Joyce als Inspirationsquelle fiirJoseph Beuys Hildesheim: Georg Olms Verlag 2001 415pp ISBN 3-487-11347-3 OYCE AND BEUYS never met. WhenJoyce died, Beuys was twenty years old and had not yet read a word by the Irish writer who was to become such an influence on his artistic development. The art historian Christa-Maria Lerm-Hayes has written a book about Joyce as a source of inspiration for Beuys. Much of what we know about Beuys is still hazy and often based on anecdotes and legends. His fascination withJoyce, however, is a fact and a comprehensive study of JamesJoyce andJoseph Beuys, who is still Germany's most significant post-war artist, is therefore more than welcome. Lerm Hayes's book operates on an inter- disciplinary level in that it applies a method of 'icono- graphic comparisons' leading to 'statements about an iconological level'. This is a method which cannot avoid being rather associative at times. Lerm Hayes had the rare opportunity to work with Beuys's heavily annotated edition of Finnegans Wake that had hitherto been stowed away in the Bcuys estate and thus unavailable for scholarly investigations. As we can see in the illustration at the end of Lerm Hayes's book, Beuys, for example, jotted down an enormous number of English words beginning with 'C' onto the margins of his Wake edition. The author interprets those Cs as a proof of Beuys's affinity to things Celtic. 'The C', she writes, 'is the beginning of the spiral, a semi-circle and thus top end of a walking cane both Beuys and Joyce were wont to use.' Lerm Hayes draws attention the fact that Bcuys never annotated the pages on which he could recognise Joyce's own visual intentions. The cen- trical beginning of the Anna Livia Plurabelle' chapter, for example, is left untouched as Beuys acknowledged this page as a visual artefact in its own right. Joseph Beuys, a very verbal visual artist, was attract- ed by the acoustic link between his name and that of the Irish author, who probably would have appreciated it too. Both artists loved puns and loved working with them; both shared a similar sense of humour. Eva Bcuys told Lerm Hayes that her husband had sat on the sofa for two weeks, laughing out loud, while composing his fictitious interview, 'Conversation with Hagen Lieberknecht'. Her account reminds us of Nora Barnacle's complaint aboutJeoyce keeping her awake at night by laughing over his own writing. Lerm Hayes investigates the pronounced parallels, the less conspicuous allusions between the two out- standing oeuvres and the very ostentatious quotations Beuys takes fromJoyce's texts even though he translates and transubstantiates them into drawings, paintings, multiples and installations made of paper, fat, felt, tallow, stone, wood, metal and more. In the fourth and central chapter of her book, the author lists all of Beuys's works connected toJoyce's. The first is Odyjfeus (1957) whose German letter fl is important. It recalls a B so the artist Beu(y)s can hide in his own work like Odysseus in his Trojan horse. The chapter ends after 27 sub-chapters, causing confusion as to what is important and what is not. To me, Chapter IV, Ulysses- Verliingerung ('The Prolongation of Ulysses by Two More Chapters on Commission of the Author'JamesJoyce') seems to be the most important part of the book. Beuys's 'Prolongation of Ulysses' consists of six notebooks filled with pencil drawings. Here, Lerm Hayes explores and explains different motifs such as fat and felt, the Penennius motif, mountain and sea, the gyroscope, the pentagon, anthropomorphic landscape, labyrinth, navel (without, alas, mentioning the omphalos) and Ossian. She points out the difference between Beuys's work onJoyce and 'mere' illustrative works like those by Matisse, Hamilton and Motherwell. The definition of 'inspira- tion', the key topic of her study, is to be found under IV, Zwei Friulein mit leuchtendem Brot ('Two Maidens with Shining Bread'). The advantage of the strict chronological structure adopted by Hayes is that it brings home the actual strength of Joyce's influence on Beuys. From the fifties up until his death in 1986, Beuys seems to have been in constant artistic communication with Joyce, with Ireland, with Celtic history and with the English lan- guage. It is remarkable that he was still able to remain independent, that he did not submit himself to Joyce's powerful impact but created an oeuvre which pays its respects to the Irish writer but more often tries to express similar truths through different means, to com- plement them, or to offer alternatives. This study, though it would have gained fromi further editing, is a significant step in the right direction. It poaches and trespasses on academic grounds, the bor- ders of which should long continue to be as fizzy as felt and as flowing as the language of Finnegans Wiake.
