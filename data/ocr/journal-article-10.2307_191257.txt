Pp. ix, 166, $30.00. Bennett's book advances an intriguing series of theses that I will summarize. (1) Contemporary environmental consciousness is divided between two "paradigms" termed Environmental Management (repre- sented by Passmore and a long list of political scientists and economists) and Natural Holism (exemplified in very different ways by Erazim Kohak and John Compton). (2) These rival viewpoints reenact the epic struggle between two larger "modes of consciousness": Faith and Enlightenment, of which its dialectic clash and interpenetration received its classic analysis in Hegel's Phenomenology. (Since the author does not characterize Faith as "unthinking," whoever chose the book title has something to answer for.) (3) Each paradigm can show flaws in the other, leaving us in the same kind of impasse that Hegel confronted and tried to transcend with his philosophy of Geist (which apparently failed, since "no one today defends [it]"). (4) Antithetical on the surface, the paradigms actually share "an eerie affinity," namely, "neither can tolerate otherness." (5) It is useful to step outside the framework defined by the struggle of Faith with Enlightenment, Natural Holism with Environmental Management, and to imagine alternative ontologies, such as the one sketched in the last chapter under the name "fractious holism." (This is where the chief interest and importance of the book lies-in its effort to breathe fresh air into a debate that has bogged down in the sectarian antithesis of self-styled "deep" versus "shallow" ecology movements.) (6) Along the way, Bennett digresses to explore three contemporary views of politics that she thinks represent the traditions of Enlightenment (Lowi and Habermas) and Faith (Charles Taylor). This is a lot to do in a short book. Some readers will wonder at Bennett's choice of writers to discuss, but, at bottom, they are fodder for the construction and manipulation of ideal types; or, alternatively, they are imperfect embodiments of "modes of consciousness" and "paradigms" that speak through them to make statements, pose questions, answer, criticize each other, and even 321</page><page sequence="2">322 POLITICAL THEORY / MAY 1989 "collude to restrict the range of debate." For all Bennett's indebtedness to Foucault, her book is a Hegelian (scarcely "post-Hegelian") spectacle in the grand manner. Of course, once different Ideas have been shown to indict one another, some judgments must be made and, as we shall see, that is a more difficult task. The critique of Environmental Management (by others called "the ideology of natural resource conservation," "environmental reformism," "shallow ecology," and so on) is admirably summarized by Bennett. An anthropomorphic, utilitarian view of nature as "standing reserve" having value when managed as a set of resources for the satisfaction of human needs and wants remains anthropocentric, utilitarian, and managerial, extending the empire of instrumental reason over a disenchanted and increasingly resistant world, whether the slogan of the day is sustained yield, multiple use, environmental amenity, breathable air, sustainable society, or wilderness resource, and whether the technique of choice is regulation, litigation, or marketlike incentives. The dialectic of destruction and control seems unstoppable within this paradigm, and the world-seen-as-resource comes to embrace not only natural entities but ourselves ("human resources'). Why is the Enlighten- ment mode of consciousness so inherently destructive? Bennett, like Burke and the German Romantics, suggests that it overestimates the power of human reason and will, or (the other side of the coin) overestimates the amenability of nature and human nature to rational control, so that projects to control the world do violence to it. Already in the critique of Environmental Management we find manifestations of Bennett's concern with the "otherness" of things, sometimes manifested as a kind of recalcitrance. Given this emphasis on otherness, it is not surprising that Bennett resists also the type of paradigm that most commonly emerges out of the critique of the "Promethean," man-over-nature, rational-control model. The alternative vision of humanity-and-nature as an interconnected whole, with Nature seen, in effect, as a moral order and humans seen as realizing their authentic selves through "attunement to nature"-this vision is judged utopian, Romantic, nostalgic, suspiciously reminiscent of Faith's belief in a world designed by God. In Bennett's analysis Natural Holism is treated as synonymous with Harmonious Holism; the injunction to treat nature with respect rather than as a "resource" is depicted as somehow following from, or presupposing, a belief that "Nature, humans, and reason harmonize at the most fundamental level of being." Bennett then gives the notion of harmony an anthropocentric</page><page sequence="3">BOOKS IN REVIEW 323 twist, translating it into the belief that "nature is predisposed to us." This reader is not clear that holistic views are necessarily harmonistic, or that harmonistic views are necessarily more anthropocentric than biocentric. Actually, Harmonious Holism should be treated as a species of the genus Natural Holism, as should the author's proposed paradigm, "fractious holism" (modestly lower caste). In any case, on what ground is the Harmonious version of Natural Holism rejected? Bennett says in the concluding chapter that her book "cannot determine the truth of ontological assumptions" but can (only) explore their "ethical-political implications." While her critique of Environmental Management does, for the most part, operate that way, bringing an ontology into question through its practical implications and consequences, the critique of Harmonious Holism appears to challenge that ontology more directly, claiming that it is "disconnected from experience," that it "ignores the threatening and destructive aspects of nature" ("drought, earthquakes, allergies, tornadoes, disease, and untimely death'), that it is "increas- ingly difficult for us [who are "us"?] to believe," and is therefore "untenable." Perhaps Bennett is reporting only her personal sentiments in the guise of an impressionistic sociology of belief. If, on the other hand, she means to say that the ontology of Harmonious Holism is false in the sense of not corresponding to human experience and under- standing of the world, some discussion is needed of levels of being and modes of understanding, since some of"us" are probably more inclined than Candide was to accept earthquakes and tornadoes, like rattlesnakes and viruses, as having a place and serving a function in the natural system of which we are a part. Certainly there are many of "us" who think it odd that anything as trivial as allergic rhinitis refutes the claim of a harmony "at the most fundamental level of being." Bennett's Fractious Holism (which I shall capitalize) aims to be "holistic" in the sense of affirming the interconnectedness of human and nonhuman components of the world, the extent to which they constitute one another, and the extent to which they form a whole in which changes in one part affect the others. It is "fractious" in rejecting the notion of a whole that is (totally? at bottom?) coherent or harmonious. Fractious Holism is distinguished by its insistent recognition of a recalcitrant otherness in nature and human nature that resists control, even full comprehension. Respect for nature, writes Bennett, is rooted partly in the experience of "awe" inspired by our perception of the massive otherness given in nature-"the sight of gigantic mountains or the feel of a mighty waterfall or total, silent darkness ... characteristics, powers, or</page><page sequence="4">324 POLITICAL THEORY / MAY 1989 potentialities simply unavailable to humans." Here Bennett touches on a familiar and important theme in the "wilderness" strand of environ- mental sensibility represented by the writings of John Muir and the photographs of Ansel Adams. Yet it is a problematic theme. There must be something more than sheer otherness, even otherness of great magnitude or power, involved in the generation of respectful awe, since the attitude to mountains and "wilderness" was different before the eighteenth-century invention of the aesthetic of "the sublime," which sublimated God into Nature. As Bennett herself recognizes, the perception of something as other does not automatically generate respect for it, even tolerance: "The object of awe can easily turn into an awful object," inspiring disgust and loathing. More important, I think, is the way the ethic of awe has functioned to focus attention on preserving mountains, giant sequoias, and the Grand Canyon, while less grandiose landscapes (e.g., wetlands) that provided more important habitat were lost to development through neglect. To some extent, microphotography makes possible an alternative nature aesthetic of marvel at the intricate patterns and relationships of things beneath everyday notice; and this can supplement the aesthetic of awe before the monumental. But there is a more profound way in which the ethic of awe misleads us, as does the whole "wilderness" tradition of which it has been a part. To exaggerate slightly: Native Americans burned the grasslands, as well as the understories of the forest, and the desert oases; Europeans called the result "wilderness," and, after turning most of it into farmland, range, and city, set up Smokey the Bear to "protect" the degraded and fragmentary remnants, some of them now legally designated Wilderness Areas on the dubious premise that they have remained (a) largely "untrammeled by man" and (b) self-regulating ecosystems. One outcome has been an increase in the amount of brush "invading" the forests and the grasslands, with a consequent growth in the intensity and destructiveness of fires when they occur, which leads to public cries for more fire suppression. The resulting practical question is not whether "wilderness" should be managed, but how it should be managed. The theoretical questions are the following: If Native Americans managed their natural environment, what is "wilderness?" Can the ethic of awe survive the demytholigization of "wilderness?" To some extent, it probably already has: Witness the tourists struck dumb in the presence of the power and the glory of Hoover Dam.</page><page sequence="5">BOOKS IN REVIEW 325 More fruitful than the ethic of awe is Bennett's introduction of another consideration: Since all our "thematizations" and our "projects" try to control the world and therefore, given the nature of the world, end up doing violence and creating otherness, much as our social policies create deviants and our ideals of beauty create ugly people, then perhaps an awareness of this process can lead to "a sense of responsibility [that] can inspire greater tolerance." If I may suggest an example: The recognition that creating massive interbasin water diversions to irrigate semidesert lands for agriculture ends up producing toxic dumps that breed genetically deformed ducks make us (some of us) wonder if it wouldn't be better to let natural systems be. This is a question of degree, a matter of balance, if, as Bennett says, "it is natural for humans to alter the course of nature, and these alterations do sorne violence." How much violence should we, may we, do? Can we learn to undo some of the violence, as ecological restorationists suggest, or is ecological restoration a paradoxical form of further control destined to produce more violence? Why is the kind of otherness produced by (human) violence worse than the kind of otherness given in nature? To the extent that we limit our projects to control nature, does this stem from respect for the otherness of nature, or from enlightened human self-interest, or some combination of the two? (Why not just learn to tolerate deformed ducks? Is it because they aren't graceful to watch, fun to hunt, or safe to eat, and perhaps have become for us a "sign" of an environment unhealthy for people as well as ducks?) If we judge from the literature of philosophic natural history, respect for nature seems rooted in some dialectic of perceived differences within a framework of shared destiny (whatever that means). Thus the conclusion of Henry Beston's meditation on animals in The Outermost House: They are not brethren, they are not underlings; they are other nations, caught with ourselves in the net of life and time, fellow prisoners of the splendour and travail of the earth. Bennett's version of holism may be intended to suggest some such sense of a common worldly condition, but it remains abstract, with an emphasis insistently on otherness. If the truth be told, the writers best able to evoke a sense of respect for nature-from Muir to Beston, Leopold, and Eisley-have invested the Pleistocene (or the Eocene, or whatever period seems relevant to the topic at hand) with the sacred</page><page sequence="6">326 POLITICAL THEORY / MAY 1989 quality of Primordial Time. (In the Beginning was the great ice sheet ... then began the thaw....) In their hands, Evolution becomes a kind of Odyssey that we share with fellow creatures, some of whom (like Leopold's cranes) remind us of that dimension of time that transcends the day-to-day and the merely historical. Ecology becomes a kind of community. God may have died, but for the writers and readers of this kind of natural philosophy the world is still enchanted, and science itself provides the materials for a mythos of common destiny. While the recognition of otherness is an important moment in the dialectic of respect, it is not the whole story, perhaps not even the largest part of the story. How much, and what kind, of "holism" do we need to postulate, and what kinds of otherness do we need to distinguish? There is much work to be done, and Bennett's book makes a stimulating, provocative beginning. John Rodman Pitzer College</page></plain_text>
