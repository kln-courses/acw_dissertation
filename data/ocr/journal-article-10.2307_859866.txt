THE COLUMN OF JUPPITER IN THE MUSEUM OF MAINZ ARTHUR STRONG HE recent inauguration at the Saal- burg, near Homburg, of the restored facsimile of the Juppiter column of Mainz affords a fitting opportunity for recalling what is known of this cele- brated monument, and for reviewing both its subjects and its art [PLATE I, D]. I The column, which is carved out of the local stone, is entirely covered with reliefs from base to capital. The pieces-more than two thousand- into which it had been broken were found in 1905 in a building yard on the site of the old Roman harbour city. The many fragments were put together, with a patience and care that are beyond praise, by their first discoverer, Professor L. Linden- schmidt. The actual column consists of a lofty basis in two parts and a shaft composed of five drums, surmounted by a Corinthian capital. On the capital rests a quadrangular block destined to serve as pedestal for the bronze statue of Juppiter which once crowned the whole. This pedestal is decorated with rosettes on the front and back, and with a trellis pattern on the sides. Of the Juppiter little more has been found beside the left foot and the thunderbolt, both of them admirable examples of ancient bronze casting [PLATE I A, B]; at the Saalburg, however, the statue has been recon- structed according to the somewhat uncertain clues afforded by the various scanty fragments. [PLATE I, D]. The total height of the monument is 9.I4 metres, or about 13 metres including the statue. In the Museum of Mainz so lofty a monument has perforce to be exhibited in three pieces, though I believe it is eventually to be erected to its full height in the courtyard of the museum. Mean- while the restoration on the Saalburg is invaluable as giving us the general effect in the open with the play of light upon the reliefs. Moreover, besides the bronze Juppiter the altar that once stood in front of the column has likewise been restored and placed in position. The altar, which like the column is dedicated to "Juppiter, Highest and Best", is of the usual Roman shape; it is surmounted by an ornament in the shape of an inverted Ionic capital;' on 1This ornament is supposed by some to have its origin in the altar-cloth partially rolled up. See E. Neeb, Die JupiterSzYule, p. 15. K the lower half of the front face an open incense box is carved in high relief; on each side are the usual sacrificial jug and patera; on the back is carved a fringed cloth upon which are placed a sacrificial knife in its sheath, and next to it a ladle; on the front above the incense-box the names of the two donors are inscribed as follows: I.O.M. Quintus Julius Priscus et Quintus Julius Auctus. We meet with both names once more on the long inscription of the central panel of the pedestal above the Juppiter. It reads Joui Optimno Maximo pro salute Neronis Claudii Ccesaris Augusti Impera- toris Canabari publice Publio Sulpicio Scribotio Proculo legato Augusti posuerunt cura et impensa Quinti Juli Prisci et Quinti Juli Aucti [Saalburg copy, PLATE I, C]. The beautiful sharp early lettering is worth attention. We do not know on what precise occasion the column was dedicated. Nero's escape from the conspiracy of Piso in 65, and the great fire of Rome of the year 66 have both been conjectured. The date can be approximately fixed as 66 A.D. from the fact that in 67 Proculus and his brother were summoned by Nero to Greece, where they were the victims of an obscure conspiracy that ended in the suicide of both brothers. The canabari of Mainz, who set up the column by public decree, were, as their name implies, inhabitants of the canabce or settlement outside the military camp. Thesecanabce originally consisted of small tradespeople and the camp sutlers that invariably come in the wake of an army. On the right, along the edge of the cornice of the lower socle, runs a third mutilated inscription which gives us the names of the artists: Samus et Severus Veinicari filii sculpserunt. The father, as his name Venicarus shows, was a Gaul, but the sons, after the fashion of the times, affected the one a Hellenized (Samus) the other a Romanized, name. It is significant of the period and of the artistic excellence which provincials might attain in the enlightened Augustan and Julio-Claudian ages that two Gaulish artists could execute so splendid a monument. In presence of its sculptures we can well understand how Nero came to summon Zenodorus, another Romanized Gaul, to execute the bronze colossus of himself that stood outside the Domus Aurea.2 Zenodorus was celebrated for 2 Pliny, Nat.

The column is described in a short guide-book lately compiled by Professor Neeb, director of the Museum of Mainz, to illustrate the restoration on the Saalburg. When first discovered the column was made the subject of a long paper by Professor Koerber:8 more lately its reliefs have been interpreted afresh in a long and able mono- graph by Dr. 0x6;4 his views have been further supplemented and corrected by M. S. Reinach 5 and myself.6 II Owing to the broken and mutilated condition of the fragments it is not possible to determine the precise position of each drum with reference to those immediately below or above it; conse- quently the relation of the figures of one drum to those of another is at present largely a matter of conjecture. On the accompanying PLATE II, I have arranged the various subjects in accordance with my interpretation of the theology of the column.7 The scheme differs in certain particulars both from Dr. Oxe's and from the one adopted in the recon- struction on the Saalburg. In the front line facing the altar, in the place of honour, we see, reading from bottom to top, the following figures. On the lower socle of the pedestal is Juppiter in classic pose, leaning on his sceptre with the thunderbolt in his right hand and at his side the eagle on a globe [Saalburg copy, PLATE I, F]. The framework of this panel is filled with conventional foliage enlivened here and there by the presence of small animals. At the top corners the foliage ends at each side in the head of a satyr with pointed ears. These two heads correspond to the heads of the two bearded Sileni within the frame of the panels at the back, but have so far eluded interpretation; since we cannot suppose, as some have suggested, that these satyrs' heads are the portraits of the two artists. On this theory the pointed ears have no meaning, and the Sileni of the back panel remain as inexplicable as before. Above the Juppiter comes the great inscrip- tion [Saalburg copy, PLATE I, C]; then on M1ainzer Zeitschrift, I, I906, p. 54 ff. Ib., vII, 19I2, p. 28 ff. 'Revue Archeologique, 19I3.

The casts which have recently been taken of the various parts of the column should help to make its admirable detail better known. Casts of two of the reliefs of the base may be seen in the cast collection of the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. The complete series has been purchased for the Musee de St. Germain, where the column is to be shown as a whole. I54 the first drum of the column stands Victory with her palm branch; above again a female figure crowned with ears of corn, who holds a sceptre that likewise ends in ears of corn. This figure I have recently interpreted as Tellus or Terra Mater -Mother Earth who is the first source of material prosperity. Above her the young figure with herald staff and branch of olive I take to be Pax, Peace, without whom Victory is vain and Tellus unfruitful. By assigning to this figure the central place among the reliefs of the shaft, the importance accorded by Nero to the cult of Pax was suitably emphasized. On the fourth drum is the figure of Nero himself sacrificing at the altar, and above him again we get Juno as Queen of Heaven or Ccelestis. Each of these central figures of the front face is flanked by attendants or divinities closely connected with them so as to form in each case a sort of triad. Thus Juno appears between Luna and Sol in their chariots. Theirs is a double function: they mark the orbit of the sky coincident with the Orbis Romantus; they also appear here as the divinities upon whom before all others depends the earth's fertility. Nero again is flanked by the imperial Lares represented in the usual scheme with cornu- copixe held aloft, and with sacrificial cup in the right hand. They are official divinities by now, but the horn of plenty reminds us that they were once divinities of the field and of increase. Peace appears between Ceres and Venus,8 the two goddesses who preside over fertility; the one over that of man, the other over that of the earth that nourishes him. By a similar chain of ideas Tellus is flanked by Honos (military renown) and Virtus (military valour) who protect and guard the earth that she may fructify.9 On the lower drum Victory is appropriately placed between Mars and Neptune, who respectively symbolize, as Dr. Oxe has shown, the Roman army and the Roman fleet. The Dioscuri with their horses-the Divine Twins, whose cult was a special care of the imperial house-appear one on each side of the upper socle. As beings who lived and died alternately, they symbolize the changes from night to day, and are thus well placed near Apollo, the god of light, who occupies the corresponding slab at the back of the pedestal. As ancient divinities of healing they keep watch over the imperial health, for whose preservation the column was set up. On the right of the lower socle 8 Ceres, Venus and Vesta have been identified beyond possibility of doubt by M. S. Reinach, Rev. Archcol, 91I3, I, p. 5. 9As the female figure, wearing a helmet and a short tunic like that of an Amazon, on the right of the central divinity, must be Virtus, it follows, as all the commentators admit, that the male armed figure by the trophy, who balances the Virtus, must be her companion and paredros, Honos. The usual type of Honos, however, varies considerably from the present. As a rule he is draped but not armed, except for the spear on which he sometimes rests, and he carries a cornucopiae, to mark an original connexion with Tellus and other agrarian divinities (see Wissowa ap. Roscher's Lcxicon; cf. Mythology, I, p, 2709).</page><page sequence="4">I ? I L- -r. x r.4 0 ZZ 0 H 0 ;:4 4- 1-- ;4 H ci, z c) w P4 w u ? ;4 .</page><page sequence="5">... . I -V I5. VIRTVS 13. O ...

The latter holds a splendid horn of abundance filled with fruit, carved with as vivid a realism as the celebrated fruit of the garlands of the Ara Pacis. Between the two goddesses on a low base stands a small foculzs or fire-pan, into whose flames Minerva scatters incense grains for the imperial welfare. Balancing this group is one on the left of Mercury with winged hat, caduceus and cock, and a female figure recently interpreted as Salus.9" The snake which twines about the vase at her feet and the caduceus mark her as the Roman official version of the Greek Hygieia, and we are thus reminded once again of thepro salute of the inscription [Saalburg copy, PLATE I, C]. On the rear face of the column we are in the presence of deities immediately connected with the most ancient cults of Rome. At the back is Hercules with the lion's skin and club; he holds the deep drinking cup in his right hand to show that he has attained apotheosis and is now admitted to the banquet of the gods. His appropriateness on a Roman monument is evident, for though originally a deity introduced from abroad, his cult in Rome went back to a high antiquity, and his altar in the ancient cattle-market or Forum Boarium was one of the most venerable spots of Rome. Above him comes Apollo with the lyre and olive branch and the prophetic raven at his side. Apollo appears here in a double capacity. As god of light and art and music he represents the Palatine Apollo whose temple was built by Augustus to celebrate the new intellectual order introduced into Rome with the Augustan era; his attributes as healer and prophet recall the occasion of his first entry into Rome as Medicus and thus bring him within the same sphere as the Salus and the Fortuna and the other protectors of the imperial person. Above Apollo on the first drum of the shaft we find a divinity closely con- nected with him, his own sister Diana, represented here in her later form as huntress, though she is an ancient Latin divinity of fields and of agriculture, whose temple on the Aventine was affiliated to a more ancient Latin shrine on the shores of Lake Nemi. The twin brother and sister bring to mind by their presence the lines of the "Carmen Saeculare" :- Phoebe silvarumque potens Diana, Lucidum cceli decus, O colendi Semper et culti, date quae precamur Tempore prisco. Above Diana comes Vulcan, a divinity whose oldest shrine in Rome, the Volcanal in the Forum, was a spot as sacred as the grave of Romulus him- self. Then above him Vesta, whose presence needs 91 This figure carries in her left hand an object that resembles the winged cap of Hermes. The Hermes carries in his right hand what appears to be a purse, appropriate to him as god of commerce. The cock, so far as one can make out, is perched on a rock. no apology since she represents the guardianship of the hearth of the state, probably the oldest ritual of Rome. She resembles here the Hellenic Hestia, and leans on a sceptre; in her left hand she holds an uncertain object, almost entirely broken and obliterated, which is generally explained as a sacrificial cup, but which, it seems to me, might possibly be a torch. Behind her, however, appears the head of an ass, showing that this Vesta, as M. Reinach has pointed out,'1 is the anthropo- morphic expression of a very ancient ass divinity; then above her Bacchus ivy-crowned holding a sceptre in his left hand and the Bacchic cantharus in his right, appositely closes a line of figures which represent cults intimately connected with the material welfare and increase of the state. Further there can be little doubt, I think, that Bacchus is thus placed back-to-back with Nero to indicate that the emperor was by now acclaimed as "New Dionysos" in emulation of Alexander whose religious policy so often served as model to that of the empire. Nero appears associated with Dionysos on other monuments also; for instance, on a relief of the stage of the theatre at Athens, Miss Margarete Bieber recognizes the emperor in the figure with drapery thrown round his lower limbs, who stands between two allegorical female figures, and faces Dionysos seated beneath the rock of the Akropolis.1 The topmost drum is filled up at the back by the chariots of the Sun and Moon. It is evident that we have here a magnificent allegory of empire, an apotheosis of the imperial idea. The column is ostensibly dedicated to "Juppiter Best and Highest", but the emperor is associated with the god, and it is to him, to the imperial idea embodied in the imperial figure, that homage is being paid by the twelve great gods of Rome all present on the column, and by the allegorical figures, which were so dear to the Augustan and succeeding ages. To imagine with certain scholars that Nero's presence here among the gods of Rome is a proof of his conceited arrogance is to ignore the trend of the religious and political thought of the empire. The imperial apotheosis and the association of the emperor to the cult of the state personified by the goddess Roma were gradually bringing about the deification of the imperial person. The place assigned to Nero on the column is in accordance with the religious policy initiated by Augustus. The emperor takes high place among the gods because he is the power destined in time to supplant Juppiter himself. In the panel on the arch of Trajan at Benevento the great gods of the Capitoline Triad take the final step and are seen handing over to the emperor the emblem of their 10 In the article of the Revue Archeologique referred to above. u See my note Rev. Arch., 1914, p. 23. Moreover, Bacchus is suitably placed in the column close to the Lares, like himself ancient agrarian divinities.</page><page sequence="8">The Column of Juppiter in the Museum of Mainz power before they themselves sink back into the twilight. The column, it is true, is put up to Juppiter, but it is pro salute Neronis, since the imperial health and safety are also those of the empire. It is the emperor, the reliefs of the column clearly tell, who brings Victory and Peace and so encourages Tellus, the Earth, to bring forth her fruits. These allegories of the benignant imperial rule stand on the front face of the shaft as objects of direct adoration and gratitude, while the ancient Latin gods look on and approve. We have seen that an altar stood in front of the column whence the emperor and the assembled divinities seemed to look down benignly upon the sacrifice accomplished in their presence and to promise in return divine favour and protection. This association of altar and column repeats at a long interval an ancient scene of pillar worship, when stone or baetyl or pillar was conceived as the seat of an indwelling god or spirit. Juppiter, once a baetylic or pillar god, appears here both as column and in anthropomorphic shape, while the images of the gods of the empire and of the emperor admitted as vwo Ato'vvo-os into the Roman pantheon enfold the shaft after the manner of the embroidered sheath wrapped round certain Graeco-oriental divinities. A recent interpreter calls the column of Mainz a hymn in stone in honour of the empire. But the column is something more: it is also a great act of propitiation and ritual made perpetual by means of art, resembling in this the Gothic cathedrals whose sculptures have been aptly de- scribed as " one great act of adoration in stone ", the visible priere of the poet. The reliefs of the column thus partake of that magical character, from which according to Alessandro Della Seta, Roman art, unlike the Greek, never succeeded in liberating itself. III The gods on the column represent, as we have seen, Latin or Roman cults, but their forms are those which had passed from the Hellenic and Hellenistic world into the service of Roman ideas. Tlhe group of Minerva and Fortuna on the right panel of the lower basis has already been compared to an almost exactlyparallel group of Athenaand one of the Erinyes on the silver cup in the Corsini Palace with the Trialof Orestes.'2 The Hellenic or Hellenistic origin of the various figures and groups is so evident that, though it still needs discussing in detail, I pass on to what seems more important, the character namely of the art of the column as a whole. It was alien to the severe character of Greek architecture to diaper a whole column with reliefs, for the introduction of figured decoration necessarily impairs the vigour of the vertical line which represents the true function of the column as support. This 12 Amelung in ROmJische Mitheilungen, XXI (19o6) p. 280 ff. 162 fashion of covering the shaft of a column with figures in relief is derived from Ionia, where an early example is afforded by the well-known drum from the archaic temple of Artemis at Ephesus.'s The extant fragments show that the Greek architect of the later Ephesian temple followed the methods of his predecessors in carving the lowest drums of his columns with scenes in high relief.'4 If we know of no examples of Graeco-Ionian columns actually decorated from top to bottom like the column of Mainz, Ionian art has, on the other hand, left us examples of other monuments whose every available surface has been decorated some- what after this manner. The great Heroon at Gjolbashi, in Lycia, whose sculptures are now at Vienna, is one instance; we have others in the massive podium of the mausoleum of Halicar- nassus, which was decorated with three systems of friezes, and in the podium of the monument of the Nereids. Professor Thiersch has discussed these Ionian friezes in an able article, and detected in them the possible influence of Egyptian systems of decoration where we find not only walls entirely covered with sculpture, but likewise columns decorated to the top of the shaft.'5 The Ionian fashion of covering whole monu- ments with carvings, which necessitated the employment of vast numbers of figures, was evidently destined when it came into contact with the Roman world to play an immense r6le; it was alike suited to the vast compositions which were called into existence by the Roman desire to create an historic narrative art as on the later Trajanic and Aurelian columns, and to the groups of gods and allegorical beings who accompany the Im- perial figure on the Mainz column and kindred monuments. The fine examples of this method of composition still extant in Provence gave rise to the theory that it had found its way from the valley of the Rhine into that of the Rhone; but a clearer knowledge of the origins of Roman art and of its early contact with Ionia made this hypothesis unnecessary. Nor are those theories any longer admissible which explained the column as the copy of a prototype set up either in the Greek cities of Massilia (Marseilles) or of Arelate (Arles). The Graeco-Ionian influences manifest in the art of the column of Mainz are a character- istic of the wliole art of the empire, whether in Rome or in the provinces. Greek influence in Roman days, as our column shows, was a living force, and not a dead academic model. Rome " British Museum (Ephesus Room). 1 Ib.

This is a modification of the view expressed by Theodor Birt (Die Buchrolle in der Kunzst, p. 310) that the Ionian frieze developed through the intermediary of Egyptian wall decoration out of the long painted strips of papyrus which it was customary in Egypt to wind round objects as decoration.</page><page sequence="9">The Column of Juppiter in the Museum of Mainz when she put an end to the temporal power of Greece strengthened tenfold by that very act the spiritual dominion of her conquered foe. At the same time by constituting herself the guardian of that dominion she vivified her own ideals, clothing them from henceforth in the literary and artistic forms that were to give them world value and significance. Of this process the Juppiter column of Mainz offers a vivid example. The columnar shape can be traced back to primitive animistic beliefs carried on to a late date by Roman religious conservatism, while its sculptures interpret in the terms of Graeco-Ionian art the aspiration and achievement of the state under the Julio-Claudian dynasty. In other words, the spirit of Greek anthropomorphism has transformed the holy pillar of primitive Roman ritual into what is essentially a storied column, a colonna storiata expressive of the whole policy of an empire. It would be difficult to overstate the significance of the column for the history of the later antique.16 By a simple variation17 its system of superposed parallel reliefs develop into the unbroken spiral bands which enfold the shafts of the columns of Trajan and of Marcus Aurelius and carry up to the skies the continuous record of the imperial campaigns. The "act of adoration in stone", which brings visibly before us the source whence the Empire sought for strength and prosperity, has its natural sequel in those " epics in stone " which are the conquering policy of Rome made mani- fest. IV To the Juppiter columns succeeded the "Juppiter and Giant" columns, surmounted by the group of a divinity riding over a fallen anguipede figure."8 16 There are other Juppiter columns of similar character to the one discussed above, but none, I think, so early in date or where the shaft is so completely covered with reliefs. Most of the examples come from Roman Germania, but it is interesting to note that the fragment of such a column has been found at Cirencester; see F. Hertlein, Die Juppiter Gigantenslalen (Stutt- gart, I910), p. 53, who quotes for the Cirencester fragment Hiibner in West Deutsche Korrespondenzblatt, Vol. x, 1891, ? 89. '7It seems simpler as well as truer to the processes of the evolution of artistic form to imagine the parallel strips giving way-under the influence of the continuous narrative style of later imperial sculpture-to the continuous spiral, than to con- sider, as does Theodor Birt (Buchrolle, p. 272 f.), the long carved rotutlls of the Trajan column to be directly imitated from the inscribed strip wound about the a'KvTrdX or herald's staff. The group was long explained as Juppiter com- bating a giant. Then, again, "Juppiter" was claimed by the German and Celtic mythographers to be a Celtic or German storm-god. I myself tentatively suggested that the group represented a Syrian Baal on horseback, a sort of Atos Ltnnrros coursing over the earth symbolized by a giant.19 But I have come to see that, whatever the original elements out of which the group and the rest of the decoration were evolved, the character and intention of the column have become as purely Roman as that of the " Juppiter columns ". Both types are intended to symbolize in the provinces the imperial rule. The group of rider and " giant " represents the Imperium Romanumn or the Numen Augusti riding down a conquered foe. "The columns, according to F. Cumont,20 are put up to the deified emperors in order to celebrate their victories over the barbarians; and the anguipede figures are symbolical of the enemy trodden under foot by the victorious Caesars ". This interpreta- tion was called forth by the last discovered "Juppiter and Giant" column at Yzeures in the Indre-et-Loire,21 the few fragmentary reliefs of which brilliantly confirm the theory. The temple within which the fragments were found was itself dedicated Numinibus A ugustorium et Minervce. The shaft, now lost, was supported on three superposed bases; on the middle block of the three are scenes from a "gigantomachia", itself a subject com- monly used, as at Pergamon, to commemorate the defeat of barbarians. Its two remaining reliefs show respectively the deliverance of Andromeda by Perseus and that of Hesione by Hercules, both being emblematic of the "liberation of territory by the agency of the Caesars, assimilated here to the heroes of fable" (Cumont). Thus in this case, as in that of the column of Mainz, the intention is to give visible form to the beneficent rule of the emperor, to the blessings that accrue therefrom, whether in war or in peace. 18These columns have been exhaustively discussed by Dr. Hertlein in the monograph cited above. 19 See my article in Journtal of Roman Studies, Vol. I, p. 23. 20Revue Archeologique, I912, Vol. II, p. 211 if. (article by E. Esperandieu on the column of Yzeures). Cumont refers the theory to Alexander Riese, Die GigantenscYulen. It had also been put forward by F. Haug (see Hertlein, op. cit., p. 63). 21 Esp6randieu, Bas-Reliefs de la Gaule Romaine, Vol. IV, Nos. 2997-2999. THE NEW PRINT GALLERY, THE BRITISH MUSEUM I-BY BOWYER NICHOLS.
