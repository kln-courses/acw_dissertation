<plain_text><page sequence="1">Graves I to 99. By HARRIET P. MARTIN, JANE MOON and J. N. POSTGATE; edited by J. N. POSTGATE. Abu Salabikh Excavations, volume 2. London: BRITISH SCHOOL OF ARCHAEOLOGY IN IRAQ, 1985. Pp. 220 + xxxii plates. This volume is the second in a series of final reports on the site of Abu Salabikh in central Iraq. The first volume (see my review in this journal, 106 [1986]: 373-74) presented the results of the West Mound surface clearance. Parts of that volume or Postgate's summary article in Fifty Years of Meso- potamian Discovery (ed. Curtis, 1982) should be read before vol. 2, since they provide an introduction to the site, the recording system and general goals of the excavation project, topics not covered in this volume. Volume 2 is a detailed presentation of the first 99 graves found in areas A and E of the main mound in the 1975-76 seasons. They range in date from ED II through the Akkadian period, but most appear to date to ED IIIB (or mid-late in ED III) and compare closely with the burials found in the "A" cemetery at Kish only 50 km. distant. Users of this volume should keep in mind that the excavated areas of the main mound at Abu Salabikh were "riddled with graves which cut walls and floors" (Curtis 1982, 56). Many, but not all, of these graves were cut from now eroded levels. The present volume deals only with the first 99 graves, and one or two more volumes will be required to complete the publication of the material excavated up to 1985 (p. 2). Thus, no overview of burial practices at Early Dynastic Abu Salabikh is attempted in this publication and the reader is simply referred to Postgate's article in Sumer 36 (1980): 65-82. Postgate's introduction to the present volume provides notes on the arrangement of the text, the publication policy, the classes of objects (human and animal bone, stone/metal vessels, beads, cylinder seals, shells, and flints) discovered, and a stratigraphic summary of the relative position of the graves and their relation to the overall stratigraphy of the excavated areas. Brief but useful studies of the ceramics (Moon) and metal (Martin) objects comprise the first part of the book. Unfortunately, the analysis of the human skeletal remains has not been completed, and the detailed discussion of the cylinder seals has been postponed. Postgate and Moon (pp. 4-9) present a convincing internal sequence of burials based on a combination of the strati- graphic record and the ceramic contents of selected burials. The stratigraphic portion of this presentation could have been strengthened by an expanded and more detailed section drawing along the west balk of squares 6G64-6G54 in area E. Fig. 4 shows only graves 1 and 2 and their associated floors. Fig. 104 is drawn across an unidentified segment of the northern end of room 39. A section along the full length of these squares would have cut graves, 88 and 48, illustrating the relationship of the floors and walls of the building with all four (1, 2, 88 and 48) of the graves. "Graves which yielded the best groups of associated pot- tery, and which have accordingly served as a standard of comparison for the remainder" (p. 6) were used to establish the sequence. The results in terms of ceramic chronology are summarized by Moon (pp. 7-9). These include differences in shapes and the appearance of certain types: conical bowls become shallower; upright-handled jars with solid handles and anthropomorphic features ("goddess-handled jars") are late ED III; stemmed dishes become taller and thinner and more sketchily decorated toward the end of ED III; footed jars and jars with very wide shoulders are specifically ED IIIB. Also of interest are the four part "sets" consisting of sieve-bowl, sieve-stand, large bowl and tiny cup found in a number of graves (e.g., 1, 26, 96) at Abu Salabikh. These vessel sets have been found only in Northern Babylonia, with a distribution as far north along the Euphrates as Mari. They appear to represent a regional phenomenon and are possibly all that remains of a still to be identified funerary rite. The metal finds (Martin, pp. 10-11) included personal ornaments (pins, finger-rings, spiral hair rings, and decorative</page><page sequence="2">Reviews of Books 117 roundels) and less commonly tools and weapons (knives, vanity kits, gravers, chisel, daggers, axes, forked weapons (?) and arrowheads). Only the arrowheads (p. 14) seem to have had some kind of ritual connected with their deposition in the grave. The other objects, particularly the occasional dagger, chisel, graver, knife or axe "seem best explained as useful common tools and weapons which were worth having along 'just in case' rather than as a carpenter's kit" (p. 13)- but "in case" of what is difficult to establish: offering to the gods, a need to demonstrate one's status, or for use in the afterlife. Postgate's decision to publish the graves separately and in advance of the architecture and associated finds reflects a desire to make available a large number of relatively complete objects from "self-contained" stratigraphic units (pp. 1-2). The major portion of the work (166 pp.) is devoted to a detailed description of each grave. The entries give the loca- tion, size, type and stratigraphic information available for each burial; many are illustrated both with a plan of the interment and a schematic rendering of the objects, a "con- tents key." The listing of provenances within a single grave (batch numbers) and a catalogue recording human bones, animal bones, metal, stone, pottery, shell, flints, etc. follow this information. Large scale drawings of the pottery (figs. 122-40); stone and metal vessels, clay objects (fig. 141); metal objects (figs. 142-45); and beads (fig. 146-47) arranged by burial groups provide further documentation of the major find categories. In short, the individual burial records and major object categories are well-presented and easy to use. The tabular presentation of grave dimensions, begun in Postgate's 1980 article, could have been expanded and included here. Like- wise a tabular presentation of pottery types by grave type might also have been used to illustrate Moon's observa- tion (p. 9) that certain distinctive burial assemblages were identified. The catalogue tells a sad story of the effects of grave robbing, erosion and later disturbances. Indeed, many of the burials recorded here were so disturbed that their status as such was doubtful. Most seem to have suffered some kind of disturbance. Postgate has tried to list everything recorded from a grave, even pieces from disturbed contexts. Tombs without, or with very few grave goods, or heavily disturbed burials have in the past been generally ignored in Meso- potamia. Much of the material recorded in this volume would never have made it into print in the Ur, Susa, Kish or Diyala publications. Moreover, since the practice of including ob- jects from disturbed contexts or from the back-fill is not common, trying to compare the results obtained from Abu Salabikh with contemporary cemeteries is difficult. Never- theless, the ED III graves at Abu Salabikh appear signifi- cantly less well-endowed than those of Ur, Kish or the Diyala. Is this because the graves were plundered so thoroughly that they give a false impression of poverty? Martin raises this question (pp. 16-17, and n. 19), since there are so many fewer metal and stone objects in the Abu Salabikh graves than in the other published Early Dynastic grave groups. She also points out that some of the individual pieces (e.g., pin 6, grave 14) were similar to but less costly imitations of well- known types from contemporary sites. Readers of this volume, however, are deprived of the excavator's opinion, as provisional as it might be, on this point and others concerning Early Dynastic burial customs at the site. Surely Postgate's 1980 article should have been revised and summarized for this publication in 1985, especi- ally since it appeared five years earlier in a journal that is often hard to find, and by Postgate's own admission (Sumer 1980: 81, n. 1), was not presented together with the data necessary to support his conclusions. Does Postgate still consider the late ED III burials as intramural? Assuming that they were intramural, was there any patterning in the placement of the graves within the houses? What are his most recent thoughts on the function and disposition of the grave goods? None of these questions is reviewed in this volume, and one assumes that they will be addressed when the publication of all the graves from Abu Salabikh is completed. This book promises and offers very little in the way of interpretation, but it does make a large amount of informa- tion available for analysis and presents a corpus of well- drawn, relatively securely dated materials that will no doubt lead to further progress in the study of the period and of Early Dynastic burial customs in general.
