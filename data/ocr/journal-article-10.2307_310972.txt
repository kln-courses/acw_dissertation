<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUMMARIES OF DISSERTATIONS FOR THE DEGREE OF PH.D. 1954 AND 1955 MORTIMER HARDIN CHAMBERS - Studies in the Veracity of Thucydides.1 THUCYDIDES is usually, and rightly, set apart from all other ancient writers of history, both Greek and Roman, for his over-all objectivity, disinterestedness, and accuracy. No ancient author undertook more labor over details; and in a broader sense too none shows more remarkable veracity. The present thesis makes no attempt to overthrow his reputation or to depreciate his extraordin- ary abilities. Nevertheless marked progress has been made in the understanding of Greek history since the standard editions of the last century, and it has seemed time for a return to the author himself and to a study of his methods of procedure. For this purpose, Thucydides' veracity appeared a fit subject for investigation. The thesis samples, in greater or less detail, several problems in which the veracity of Thucydides, hitherto accepted almost without question, must be considered. These problems are: his personal political views, the speeches in his Histories, his sources and the use that he made of them, the composition of his work, some of the statistics which he presents, the constitutional status of a town in the Athenian Empire, and the topography of Syracuse. The thesis contains no general chapter of conclusions. Yet one conclusion which seems to emerge is that, despite the justified belief in Thucydides' candor and accuracy, he was not superhuman. The evidence points toward error at certain places in his narrative, al- though it is sometimes uncertain whether the error is due to Thucydides himself or to corruption in the MSS. At other points there is regrettable obscurity or incompleteness. It will never be possible to regard the Peloponnesian War, as a whole, except as it is presented by Thucydides; but the presence of errors, however small, within his work suggests that no statement of his must be accepted without any question whatsoever. It will always be possible to try 1 Degree in Classical Philology, 1954.</page><page sequence="2">Summaries of Dissertations to test his evidence and his inferences; to do so is no injustice to Thucydides. A brief summary of the several chapters in the thesis follows: Prolegomena. There are definite indications of personal political views in Thucydides, particularly regarding certain Greek statesmen, but the thesis does not conclude that there is sufficient evidence of prejudice to charge Thucydides with deliberate misrepresentation. His unflattering portrait of Cleon is not necessarily untrustworthy. The speeches are indubitably free compositions in the style of Thucydides; there is little individual portraiture in them and they all make use of common rhetorical ideas. For several of them he had little more, in all likelihood, than the "general sense" of what was spoken, and one matter is sometimes debated between two parties neither of whom could have heard what the other said. Thucydides did, however, attempt to pay some attention to fact, and composed the orations with as much fidelity as was possible. Among his sources, Hellanicus of Mytilene and Charon of Lampsa- cus are prominent. Hellanicus was used as partial source for the Fifty Years; Charon was used in Book i and for certain details in Book 6. Thucydides occasionally disagrees with Herodotus and may not always be correct in doing so. There seems reason to believe that Thucydides did not always make perfect use of his sources. There is an occasional weak inference from documents, and his information about Athenian finance is not always above question. The difficult problem of the composition of the work is probably not capable of definite solution. The position here taken is that the balance of probability points toward an early attempt to write the history of the Archidamian War not long after 421. Thucydidean Numbers. Certain numbers in Thucydides are of doubtful accuracy. Some of these are susceptible of emendation. The Status of Hestiaea. There is conflicting evidence concerning the precise status of Hestiaea within the Athenian Empire. Epi- graphic evidence suggests that it was a cleruchy, but Thucydides appears to speak of it as a colony. Between these two kinds of settle- ment there were certain distinctions, particularly in the matter of financial obligation to the Athenian Empire. The thesis concludes that, in the present state of the evidence, it is better to regard it as a cleruchy. The Topography of Syracuse. Thucydides's account of the Syra- cusan and Athenian fortifications during the siege of Syracuse ap- I42</page><page sequence="3">George Alexander Kennedy pears to be correct. New locations of the several walls are submitted. The accuracy of the description, which seems to surpass anything that Thucydides could have reconstructed entirely from accounts of participants in the siege, lends additional strength to the opinion that he visited Sicily for part of his material. GEORGE ALEXANDER KENNEDY - Prolegomena and Commentary to Quintilian VIII (Pr. and i-3).1 QUINTILIAN'S account of elocutio represents the most fully developed form of a traditional theory which had its origins in Greece in the fifth century, was given form by Aristotle and Theo- phrastus, was elaborated by the Hellenistic writers, and was stand- ardized by the Augustans. The Prolegomena of this thesis is an attempt to reconstruct the history of this development, while the commentary seeks to interpret the text of Quintilian in terms of the tradition which it represents. Prolegomena. The first treatise on style was probably written by Polus or one of the other pupils of Gorgias. It was a short separate work cataloging poetic devices which might be applied to prose. No discussion of style was incorporated into the techne rhetorike or rhetorical handbook until the second half of the fourth century. The Rhetorica Ad Alexandrum is a conflation of a techne of the tra- ditional form by Anaximenes with material from one of the early handbooks on style. Its spurious sections can be identified by the much greater incidence of hiatus in the passages which are for the most part omitted by the catalogue in the sixth chapter. It is probable that this conflation took place at the same time that the spurious introductory epistle was added. This must be dated after the death of Aristotle, who was thus the earliest writer to include a theory of style in a rhetorical handbook. The extant Rhetoric is a product of Aristotle's full development. Its first two books elaborate material from an early work on rhetorical logic, while the third book is a revision of the Theodectea which was originally a statement of sophistic rhetorical theory on invention, arrangement, and style. The most important single work in the development of the tra- 1 Degree in Classical Philology, I954. I43</page><page sequence="4">Summaries of Dissertations ditional theory of style was the Peri lexeos of Theophrastus, which made the four virtues of style the standard system of organization for most later handbooks. Stroux' reconstruction of that treatise on the basis of Cicero's De oratore is correct, although it is probable that Theophrastus did discuss the genera dicendi; for the beginnings of a theory of three styles may be seen in Plato (Resp.397C), Isocrates (Paneg.II), and Aristotle (Rhet. 3,I413b). In the interval between the fourth and first centuries B.C. the theories of the virtues of style, of the types of style, of tropes, and of figures were all greatly developed. The first two theories may be attributed to Theophrastus. The Stoics seem to have played a leading part in the development of the latter two. The distinctions which they applied to the various propositions of dialectic were taken over by the grammarians (many of whom were also Stoics) and used in cata- loguing the devices of the poets. From the grammarians they were borrowed by the rhetoricians and grafted on to the teachings of Aristotle, Isocrates, and Theophrastus concerning metaphors and figures. The rhetoricians also utilized the grammarians' work on the purity of diction and adopted the terms "barbarism" and "solecism," the former referring to the misuse of a single word, the latter to the misuse of words in composition. The most likely center for the union of grammar and rhetoric is the island of Rhodes, where an active rhetorical school sprang up in the second century. The schools at Pergamum and Alexandria contribute only indirectly, while the philosophical schools at Athens, although in the third century they helped to make rhetoric a permanent part of ancient education, turned against the rhetoricians about the middle of the second century and renewed the quarrel which Plato had begun. The second century also witnessed the first influence of Greek rhetoric on Latin literature. The traditional theory of style as seen in the Rhetorica ad Herennium and in the rhetorical works of Cicero is then examined. In each case it is shown that the purpose of the work and the audi- ence to which it was addressed has heavily influenced the form of the rhetorical tradition which is set forth. The De oratore represents the pure Theophrastan tradition and is thus based on the traditional virtues of style. The Partitiones oratoriae was written in 46 B.C. and is designed to introduce Cicero's son to the form of rhetoric being taught in the philosophical schools at Athens. It shows strong Stoic influence. The Orator was designed to convert Brutus from his Atticist tendencies; it thus omits discussion of the virtues of style I44</page><page sequence="5">George Alexander Kennedy about which there was no disagreement and concentrates instead on the question of which style had the most virtue. The discussion of the Augustan age centers around an examination of two controversies: that involving Atticism and that between the Theodoreans and Appollodoreans. It is questioned whether Caecilius of Calacte, the leading rhetorician of the time, was an Apollodorean in any real sense of the word. By no means should we believe that his lost work On The Sublime set forth Apollodorean views on that subject. The anonymous author of the extant treatise of that name shows some sympathy with the Theodoreans, but his major objection to Caecilius is the latter's use of a philosophical rather than an educa- tional approach to the problem. This he improves by describing the process rather than the nature of good writing. There follows an examination of the works of Dionysius of Halicarnassus, of the De elocutione, and of the De figuris of Rutilius Lupus. Horace's Ars poetica is shown to be dependent on the rhetori- cal theory of style, being devoted to the traditional virtue of ap- propriateness, both in subject matter and in form. Horace's dis- cussion follows the traditional order of rhetorical topics. In the final section of the Prolegomena the rhetorical writers of the early empire are examined. The view that Quintilian is heavily dependent on Celsus is attacked. Our knowledge of Celsus' rhetorical writings is solely dependent on Quintilian, who shows every sign of being in complete disagreement with him. Neither Julius Severianus nor Isidore may be properly used in the reconstruction of Celsus. The discussions of style in Seneca the philosopher are used to show the state of the traditional topics in the early empire. There was complete agreement in theory and none in practice. What was needed most was a standard of excellence, and Quintilian's great con- tribution was his canonization of Cicero as the touchstone of style. Quintilian is most heavily dependent on Cicero and the Augustan rhetoricians and probably made no direct use of earlier authors. Commentary. The Commentary is based on the Teubner text of Ludwig Radermacher (vol. 2, Leipzig, I935). A few emendations are, however, suggested. In 8.3.26 read: "'Aerumna' quid opus est, tamquam parum si &lt;dolor&gt; dicatur? 'queo' horridum, 'reor' toler- abile, 'autumno' tragicum, 'prosapia' insulsum." The "prolem dicendi versu etc." of the MSS is a result of the marginal comment "(Cicero) De Universo:prosapiam" referring to Timaeus ii. To this was then added "Problem dicendum est." M has inserted the second comment into the text, while A, G, and S have inserted both. I45</page><page sequence="6">Summaries of Dissertations In 8.3.33 read: "Quorum dura quidem admodum videntur utraque 'ens' et 'essentia,'" comparing 8.3.32: "Quae dura quidem. ." 8.3.61 may be corrected by comparison with 8.3.86. Read: "Eius primi sunt gradus in eo quod velis exprimi (i) dare atque (2) evidenter ostendendo, tertius, qui haec nitidiora faciat, quod proprie dixeris cultum." The first two are taken up in sections 6i to 86, in the last section of which it is remarked that they are not enough and the third topic is then introduced. In addition to textual matters the Commentary includes extensive linguistic, grammatical, rhetorical, biographical, and literary notes. NATHAN ABRAHAM GREENBERG- The Poetic Theory of Philodemus 1 THIS dissertation deals with the poetic theory of Philodemus of Gadara insofar as it is revealed in his Poetics (7rept 7roLl7LuaroT), a work which is partially preserved in the Herculanean Papyri. Aside from the Naples and Oxford copies of all the papyri, no text or treat- ment of the entire preserved Poetics has ever been published. As is the case with many other works of Philodemus, the pre- served portion of the Poetics consists mainly of a presentation of opponents' theories and Philodemus' criticism of them. Consequently, it is difficult to gain an exact account of Philodemus' own critical position. However, by a careful consideration of the opponents' views and Philodemus' polemic, it is possible to form some notion of a positive critical theory. Aside from studies of textual problems, previous investigation has either emphasized the theories of Philode- mus' opponents or has failed to consider the entire work. Indeed, only one portion of the Poetics may be said to have received adequate comment. This is the section which deals with the views of Neoptole- mus of Parium and which is of importance to students of the Ars poetica of Horace. It is only by an analysis of the entire work that one may gain a clearer perspective of the critical position of Philodemus. The primary concern of this dissertation is not the establishment of an exact text but, rather, the investigation of the content of the work. Hence, the method pursued is to present most of the texts of 1 Degree in Classical Philology, I955. I46</page><page sequence="7">Nathan Abraham Greenberg the Poetics in translation or summary. Many fragments have been omitted because, in their present state of preservation, the connection of thought cannot be discerned. The commentary is designed to clarify the theories of opponents and the bases of Philodemus' at- tack. The general order of treatment is based upon two considerations. First, Wilhelm Croenert divided all the papyri of the Poetics into three groups on the basis of their scripts as follows: Hands alpha, beta, gamma. This division seems confirmed by the content of each group, and it is adopted here. Second, although there is reason to suppose that the original order of these divisions was beta, gamma, alpha, they are treated here in the order alpha, gamma, beta, because of their respective states of preservation. Since the papyri of hand alpha are definitely attested, are best preserved, and have received the most attention from modern scholarship, they are of prime importance in determining the critical position of Philodemus. With the knowledge gained from the investigation of these papyri, it is possible to proceed with con- siderable assurance to the analysis of the less well preserved portions. Since the original order is largely preserved in hand gamma, it is treated before hand beta, which consists of disconnected fragments. An attempt is made here to arrange the fragments of hand beta according to the procession of topics in hand gamma. This attempt is based upon the similarity and, in some cases, upon the identity of subjects treated in both hand gamma and hand beta. In view of the fragmentary state of the work, few certain con- clusions may be drawn concerning the structure and organization of the Poetics. While it is generally assumed that the papyri in hand alpha and hand beta constitute part of a single work, the status of hand gamma is subject to dispute. There is some possibility that the fragments in hand gamma are from a later work than the Poetics. However, this paper advances the hypothesis that all the preserved fragments are part of a single work which consisted of at least five books. None of Book I is preserved, but it is possible that a portion of it is summarized in hand gamma. Book II probably contained the fragments of hand beta. There is no reference to Book III, but the hypothesis is advanced here that it contained the fragments of hand gamma. Books IV and V are certainly preserved to some extent in the papyri of hand alpha. The inspection of the entire work indicates that a major part of the Poetics was devoted to an attack upon those critics who held that 147</page><page sequence="8">Summaries of Dissertations the judgment of poetry was to be assigned not to the intellect but to the trained perception. Philodemus stated positively that only the in- tellect can exercise judgment of any sort. Further, he claimed that the peculiar effect of poetry is brought about by content which is artfully expressed. Hence, Philodemus was opposed to any judgment of poetry based upon euphonic elements alone. Although Philodemus recognized a division of form and content in the consideration of poetry, he insisted that the essence of good poetry was the proper interrelation of form and content, and that neither can be properly considered without reference to the other. This position stems directly from Philodemus' opinion that the func- tion of language is the conveyance of meaning, and that the intellect, as sole judge, will consider all aspects of poetic creation. In addition to these positive and dogmatic statements, there is an empirical side of Philodemus' theory which he applied in a negative manner. This aspect is embodied in his concept of ennoia which is, in effect, the a priori acceptance of certain poetry as good. From an inspection of this body of poetry, Philodemus was able to assert that no restrictions may be placed upon the poet's selection of content. On this basis, Philodemus attacked those theorists who demanded originality of content in the poem, or who required that the content of poetry be educational or morally good. However, it was in ac- cordance with his theoretical position that Philodemus demanded that all poetry should be generally comprehensible, that is, that all poetry should convey meaning. HARALD ANTON THRAP REICHE - A History of the Concepts ?eo7rpEc7rE and epo0rrpe7rS 1 NDEBTED for its topic to Professor Werner Jaeger, The Theology of the Early Greek Philosophers (New York: Oxford University Press, I947, P. 214, n. 56), this thesis traces the theological category "appropriate to the notion and/or majesty of Godhead and/or the holy" from Xenophanes B26 through Gregory of Nyssa. For the period after Clement of Alexandria, when a systematic Christian theology finally succeeded in formulating the monotheistic character of its triune God, the fullness and repetitiousness of source material 1 Degree in Classical Philology, I955. I48</page><page sequence="9">Harald Anton Thrap Reiche made necessary a selective treatment of Origen, the Neo-Platonic opposition, and the Latin Cappadocian fathers. Methodologically, this study builds on as broad a factual basis as could be laid with the aid of standard editions and, wherever possible, of special lexica. Throughout, textual and contextual parallelisms were examined for clues as to common sources. The aims of the study were two. Philologically, it sought to document the programmatic continuity of Xenophanes' criterion for the entire post-Xenophanic era, both Greek and Christian. In so doing, it sought to illustrate the more than purely formal continuity of Christian dogma with Greek philosophy. In reverting from an older liturgical term connected with local cult, to the objective, quasivisual root meaning of its components (wherein 7rpCTEt = COLKE), Xenophanes obtains four distinct though not separate meanings of our concept: (i) relative to our notion of Godhead, a new nonanthropomorphic, nonlocal, cosmomorphic meaning; (2) the old technical, liturgical meaning, although expanded by the additional dimension (3) of thought, word, and civic conduct (see Appendix); and (4) the negative, polemical meaning used to dissociate the purified notion of Godhead from traditional anthropomorphism. Theagenes and Metrodorus explicitly attach their allegorizing method to meaning (4). The otilot' O0El ideal of the Xenophontic Socrates, Antisthenes, Plato, and Aristotle's Protrepticus attaches its call to self-sufficiency to meanings (2) and (3). The later Plato's astrocosmic theology, classically Aristotle's De philosophia, attaches to all four meanings at once. The three rv'rot 7rept 60oAoytag of Rep. 2.380 c ff. link meanings (i) and (4), while the triad, unholy, unprofitable, and logically self- contradictory, becomes the definitive subdivision of meaning (4). When Aristotle terms contemplation "worthy of Godhead [sc. in us]" (meaning contemplation of the Forms in Protrepticus and of the cosmos in De phil., where the images originate of the cosmos as a mysteries temple "worthy of Godhead" and of knowledge as an initiation), he explicitly assimilates the liturgical meaning to mean- ings (i), (3), and (4). The Xenophanic criterion continues, among his successors, to dominate the debate between the "theoretical" and the "practical" factions; it informs Hecataeus of Abdera's account of Hebrew religion, and Homeric scholarship at Alexandria. Com- mitted by its physico-theology to an inadequate notion of hypothesis and creativity, the Old Stoa was compelled to postulate a triple theology and to pursue the allegorical method of interpreting the poetic genus. Cleanthes' four proofs are shown to support one of I49</page><page sequence="10">Summaries of Dissertations these three branches of the Stoic theology, the "natural" branch. If Zeno's physico-theology entailed grave ambiguities for meaning (i), Cleanthes' insertion of Tr fvo-q t into the Zenonic telos formula extended these ambiguities to the deity's fellow cosmopolite, man, or meaning (3). Yet it was Cleanthes who supplied the classic formula for the structure of God-knowledge, a formula given final form in Chrysippus' decisive 7 Oco7rpEirLaa Es Earl TO 7rOpeov Tr Oe c aw,ovaa. Inscriptional and other evidence increases from the middle of the second century B.C. onward; as was to be expected, it mostly documents the old liturgical meaning (2). By this time Stoa, Garden, Academy, and Peripatos have achieved a remarkable measure of unanimity as regards the negative meaning (4). Though varying in content from school to school, the positive meaning (i) is the criterion jointly invoked by Epicureans, Skeptics, and Middle Stoics in their debate on myth, theodicy, and divination. It is preserved in Cicero, while, following Chrysippus, Seneca and Late Stoic diatribe conflate it with the oIaotuO(ts Oe, topos. A survey of the poetic passages labeled "inappropriate to deity" by philologists from Zoilus and Aristotle through the Alexandrians and their successors, Pseudo- Heraclitus and Porphyry, and the various AXaoELS of this ,rtrtuni7ua Sta rT d7rpcErE supplies an important locus of our theme. Likewise, in Dio's Olympikos the problem of the proper medium of symbolizing rather than representing godhead proves to be informed by our category. 7rept Koalov and the Hermetica are studied as examples of how the dogmatic eclecticism of the first century of our era resolves in Xenophanic terms the conflicting claims of ubiquitous omnipotence and majestic isolation of Godhead. Philo's 0eo7rpe7rCe and his notion of the positively unknowable (as against the merely unknown) God is studied as a version of Hellenistic Logos theology fundamental for Johannine Logos Christology as well as for the allegorizing defense of Old Testament improprieties (Tertullian, Origen). Plutarch is cited as exponent of Middle Platonism's convergence with some of the aforementioned definitions of what befits Godhead. Among the earliest Christians, Paul and John are shown to be keenly aware of the challenge which the doctrine of the Incarnation poses for all traditional definitions of what befits Godhead, both Greek and Hebrew. Ignatius connects Chrysippus' definition with the call to martyrdom, while Tertullian, adapting Plato's Timaeus, insists against Marcion that the Old Testament Creator-God and the world that He created are not unworthy of Godhead. As for the Christological issue, Xenophanes' category is invoked in the attempt IS50</page><page sequence="11">Harald Anton Thrap Reiche to define God's relation to the Logos Son (namely, as nonnaturalistic 7rpof3oXA) as well as the relation of the Logos Son to Christus Patiens. Quantitatively, the relation of God to the single Logos Son is formu- lated in opposition not only to the multitude of Gnostic Aeons, but in adaptation of Epicurean anti-Stoic polemic, also to the multitude of popular deities which Gnostic syncretism had simply assimilated to these aeonic emanations. Arguing from their manifest unworthiness of true Godhead, the Church degrades these gods from divine to demonic status, coupling its critique, in the case of the second- century Greek Apologists, with the specification via negativa, of God's attributes. Athenagoras, in addition, makes our criterion the mainstay of his argument for the resurrection of the flesh. On the homoiousian and subordinationist terms of ante-Nicene Christology, attempts such as Irenaeus' to secure the reality of Christ's vicarious atonement without violating God's immutable dignity, and converse attempts such as those of Tertullian and Hippolytus were doomed to lapse into either the Monarchian or the Docetic heresies, respectively. The latter besets Clement of Alexandria despite his uncompromis- ing attack upon pagan polytheism in the name of Xenophanes' criterion; it likewise afflicts Origen despite his systematic reinterpre- tation of all Scripture so as to exclude everything unworthy of the notion of Godhead. Similarly, the Latin Fathers hinge their massive attack on pagan mythology upon the selfsame criterion, deriving it as they do directly from Cicero and the second-century Greek Apologists. It occupies a central place, moreover, in the Neo-Platonic opposition to Christianity. Nicaea's homoousian coordinationism suc- ceeds in resolving the heretical antinomies described. Fulfilling the Xenophanic-Chrysippan stipulation, it saves the dignity, immuta- bility, and oneness of Godhead even in Christ's Passion. Gregory of Nyssa's Oratio catechetica profusely documents the way in which the non-Augustinian branch of post-Nicene orthodoxy employs the Xenophanic category to reconcile the full dignity of triune Godhead with the full and traditionally Hellenic dignity of man's humanitas. The dissertation concludes with a brief survey of later usage attesting to the continuing importance of the criterion here studied. ISI</page><page sequence="12">Summaries of Dissertations WESLEY DALE SMITH- Dramatic Structure and Technique in Euripides' Suppliants 1 URIPIDES' Suppliants has been studied as a source for Euripides' personal outlook or as his attempt to influence his audience politically, and only secondarily as a drama. As its title indicates, this thesis presents an examination of the play as an example of dramatic art, on the grounds that such study not only is valuable in itself, but also serves as a necessary corrective for ap- proaches of a biographical or historical nature. Chapter I is an account of previous criticism of the play, as an ex- position of the problem that the thesis sets for itself. Approaches the purpose of which was to discover the poet's views about subjects suggested by the play have set a pattern for its criticism. This pattern involves taking Theseus as the equivalent of Euripides and the first half of the play as the drama, the second half as mainly irrelevant. Norwood is treated as the last of a series who have so approached the play, with minor variations. The essays of Greenwood and Kitto are considered as partial refutations of that view, and as indications of what may be said about the play. The present study starts not from their essays, but from the form of the play. Chapter II discusses plot structure in Sophocles and Euripides in so far as it deviates from Aristotle's ideal type, and argues that judgments about relevance are closely related to conceptions of structure. Plot structure in the Suppliants is then considered: its general similarity to the type designated "diptych" by T. B. L. Webster, and the similarity of the play's second part to the "series of tableaux" recognized by Decharme as the plot of the Troades. Structural duality involves duality of emphasis. The relevance of individual scenes is then discussed with regard to the structure de- scribed. Chapter III examines the play by scenes, to determine the effects achieved by each and the technique by which the effects are achieved. There are three appendices: the first argues that lines I80-183 are an interpolation; the various defenses of the passage are examined with regard to their implications for the scene and the play as a Degree in Classical Philology, 1955. I52</page><page sequence="13">Wesley Dale Smith whole, and are rejected. The second appendix analyzes Theseus' speech, 195-249, and defends it as a piece of dramatic writing; various proposals to make the speech shorter and more logical are examined and rejected. Only 238-245 can be isolated from the rest as a possible actor's interpolation, but it is not inappropriate where it stands. The third appendix considers various problems of staging the play. Some of the conclusions about form and technique in the play follow. The play is in two parts, different in tone and in structure. The first part primarily concerns the reactions of Aithra and Theseus to the suppliant mothers and Adrastus, and to the Thebans' refusal to allow burial. The second part presents the funeral of the Seven which the first part has made possible. Its structure is that of the funeral ritual, along with which are presented the emotions and at- titudes of the mourners, relatives, and friend of the Seven. Dramatic effects are achieved by juxtaposition of the two parts, the first dom- inated by the confident self-sufficiency of Theseus, the second characterized by the despair and futility of the Argives. Throughout the play and within each part subjects and characters are treated first from one point of view, then from another. The treatments are simply juxtaposed and allowed to comment on one another. "Contemporary references" in ideas and vocabulary seem to function dramatically in much the manner in which imagery functions. Reflections of fifth-century attitudes and topics of dis- cussion are used as a conveniently short method of enlarging the dramatic context by suggesting to the audience certain of a character's motives or certain qualities in a situation which could only be estab- lished otherwise by lengthy exposition. Throughout the play the audience is virtually forced to give a double response: sympathy for the characters but criticism of their views. The audience is kept from associating itself fully with any of the characters by various means, including the use of satire at crucial points, the juxtapositions mentioned above, and the form itself, in that the emphasis shifts from one set of characters to an- other in the middle of the play. The thesis does not concern itself with interpretations of the play as political propaganda or as an indication of Euripides' opinions on particular subjects, except in so far as such studies have distracted from consideration of the play as drama. Treating Theseus as a dramatic character, not a vehicle for the poet's views, makes his I53</page><page sequence="14">Summaries of Dissertations statements intelligible and interesting, and makes it unnecessary to attribute Theseus' optimism to Euripides and then explain it away. Similarly, the funeral speech as related to the play's structure and technique is shown to be an effective piece of damatic writing. Consideration of the play as drama reveals that the matter and presentation are complex, and the play is not a simple recommenda- tion of any single view or course of action, rather an examination of the manner in which the play's characters act, and of both reason and emotion as sources of their actions. The play itself is more interesting than the view it expresses, even if that view could be separated from it without falsification. MIRKO USMIANI - Marcus Marulus, Life and Works ARCUS MARULUS (I450-I524) is honored by his Croatian nationals as the "Father of Croatian literature," his Croa- tian epic "Judita" being the first large, artistic and dated poem by a known Croatian author. The date of its composition (I50I) is regarded as the official birthdate of Croatian literature. Marulus, however, is mainly a Latin author of prose and poetry. His Latin prose works particularly were very popular in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when his first Latin work, De institutione bene vivendi alone saw some forty editions, including translations into several European languages. When the national literatures drove Latin out of use, the Latin works of Marulus were neglected in favor of his Croatian works. This fact resulted in contradictory and in- complete appraisals of the literary work of Marulus. His life story also was known only partially from a one-sided biography written by his friend Franciscus Natalis. This biography can now be comple- mented with the latest discoveries (I950) concerning his early career. The dual purpose of this dissertation, then, is to study the biogra- phy of Marulus in view of the new discoveries, and to examine his Latin works in an attempt to present a more exact evaluation of his literary personality. 1 Degree in Mediaeval Latin, I955. I54</page><page sequence="15">An examination of the two main sources for the biography of Marulus, the biography of Natalis and the documents recently dis- covered by Fiskovic in the archives of Split, shows that they do not stand in contradiction to each other, as it would appear on first sight, but rather present a complementary picture of Marulus. The old biography of Natalis describes Marulus' later years and literary activities, while the archival documents show his public career and the private life of his earlier days. From these documents the life story of Marulus may be summarized as follows: Marcus Marulus was born in 1450 in Split (Spalato), Dalmatia, Yugoslavia, from a noble family, who had originally come from Greece (Marulos, de Marulis) and settled in Split in the thirteenth century. He was educated in the public schools of Split by Italian teachers, the most prominent of which was Tideo Acciarini, a humanist writer and poet himself. The influence of Acciarini upon Marulus is unmistakable-especially of his moralistic work De animorum medicamentis. We have sufficient reasons to assert that Marulus completed his education in Split, contrary to the generally accepted assumption that he graduated from the University of Padua. There is no evidence to show that he ever was in Padua, for educa- tional or any other purposes. In the schools of Split, with their tra- ditional medieval curriculum of trivium and quadrivium, Marulus acquired an excellent knowledge of the Latin language and literature, and distinguished himself at an early age in Latin oratory and the composition of poetry. His knowledge of Greek remained rather elementary. After completing his education, Marulus assisted his father Nicholas in the administration of their family estate, which was con- siderable for Split circumstances. After his father's death (ca. I476) Marulus embarked upon a brilliant, if brief, career in the administra- tion of his home town, which at the time was an autonomous com- mune under Venetian rule. He reached the highest point of his career in I479, when for the first time he was elected by the City Council to the position of iudex honorabilis, the highest office in the city after that of the count, who was always a Venetian nobleman. At the same time, Marulus was involved in some long and painful lawsuits result- ing from some improper dealings of his late father and family dis- putes over his will. Around the year 1482 Marulus retired from public life to spend the rest of his days in the seclusion of his own home, studying and writing his books. He was never married, but functioned as the head Mirko Usmiani s55</page><page sequence="16">Summaries of Dissertations of his family of six brothers and one sister, Bira, a nun. The assertion that he later traveled in Italy to collect Latin inscriptions is un- founded. His life of retirement may be divided into two distinct periods. The first period (ca. 1482-150I) is the period of study, when he copied manuscripts and collected material for his later works. With the year I50I begins the productive period of his life. His first work is the Croatian epic poem "Judita" in six books, which established his prominent position in the history of Croatian literature. The Judita also represents his highest achievement in Croatian poetry. After Judita, he composed a shorter epic poem in Croatian, the "Historija od Susane" (the story of Susanna), at an unknown date. The rest of his Croatian poetry is on a rather primitive level and shows all the marks of a beginner: it should be placed before I50I. In I504 at the latest, Marulus composed his first Latin work, the De institutione bene vivendi per exempla sanctorum, first published in Venice, I506. After that, his other works appeared in slow suc- cession. Between the years I506 and 1510, Marulus retired to a small "eremitorium" on the island of Solta, which belonged to the terri- tory of his home town. He had to leave it because of the attacks of Turkish pirates. The rest of his life until his death in 1524 he spent in Split. The works of Marulus have baffled his literary critics to the extent that we find two distinctly opposing views about the nature of his works. The older view sees Marulus as a learned philosopher; some scholars even go so far as to claim that his works were used as text- books in Jesuit schools. The more recent view presents Marulus as a popular writer with mystical tendencies, strongly opposed to phi- losophy. This dissertation attempts to show that neither of these views is quite correct. Marulus is presented here as an ascetical writer, belonging to that class of Christian writers who teach the ways of Christian ascesis on an elementary level. Marulus' only concern in his works is to show how to acquire the Christian virtues and avoid vice in order to come closer to God. This didactic element forms the basis for all his works. Marulus took the inspiration for most of his writings from the Scriptures, which for him are the principal source of all knowledge and the ultimate criterion of all truth. His works can be divided into four classes according to subject matter: I56</page><page sequence="17">(I) Ascetical works (2) Biblical narratives (3) Philosophy (4) History Of his eight ascetical works, two are lost. Three of the works of this group may be considered a kind of methodological trilogy as follows: De institutione bene vivendi per exempla sanctorum Lib. VI (composed ca. 1504, ist ed. Venice, 1506) Quinquaginta parabolae (composed I5Io, ist ed. Venice, I517) Evangelistarium Lib. VII (ist ed. Venice, I516) These three works treat the problems of Christian perfection on three different levels and are each aimed at a different public. The De institutione is written primarily for the clergy. In this work, quotations and examples from the Scriptures and the lives of the saints are assembled methodically to show the virtues necessary for the religious life, from the most elemental ones to the higher theological virtues. The book ends with a discussion of Judgment Day and life everlasting. In the composition of this work, Marulus follows Valerius Maximus (Factorum et dictorum memorabilium Libri novem), using, however, only Christian material. The Quinquaginta parabolae are written for the lower levels of the religious orders, the lay brothers and nuns. His fifty parables are mainly inspired by the parables and similes of the Gospels; to each, he added a long meditation on the virtues and vices, following the pattern of De institutione. A few of the parables are adapted from ancient literature (Pliny and mythology); several of the most in- teresting ones are based on observations of everyday life in his home town. The Evangelistarium is written for the general public, clergy and laymen alike, and treats practically all the virtues and vices in the personal life of a Christian. This is his principal prose work, and most revealing of the character and ideas of the author. From it we can see that Marulus follows the philosophy of the late Stoa in the main lines, and that he is particularly under the influence of Seneca. However, in this as in other works, he condemns the study of ancient poetry and ancient philosophy as a useless pursuit, which does not prevent him from using both ancient philosophy and ancient poetry in almost all of his works, poetry for illustration, and phi- losophy occasionally to corroborate his defense of the Christian truth. Of the other works of this group, De laudibus Herculis is of par- Mirko Usmiani I57</page><page sequence="18">Summaries of Dissertations ticular interest. In this work, a poet and a theologian discuss the value of the myth of Hercules. Marulus applies his technique of al- legorical interpretation, previously used on the Bible stories, to the story of the labors of Hercules. Judging Hercules' achievements from the standpoint of Christian morals, he condemns him as a criminal. The young poet, a humanist, is converted to the theologian's point of view. This work is characteristic for the attitude of Marulus towards the humanistic movement of his time. The three biblical narratives of Marulus are epic poems: the "Davidias" in Latin, and the "Judita" and "The Story of Susanna" in Croatian. The "Davidias Lib. XIV" is the most interesting work of Marulus. With this epic, he attempted to create a Christian Aeneid, an ambition common to many humanists at the beginning of the sixteenth century. Marulus was the first humanist to compose such a poem, and the only one who chose an Old Testament hero. Other humanists after him, such as Sannazaro and Jerolamo Vida, used the Gospels as their source. Marulus took the story of David as it stands in the Bible, making only very minor changes. In the poetical form and composi- tion of the poem he follows Vergil. David is represented as a symbol of Christ, as well as his ancestor; he foretells his future greatness in prophecies and psalms. This is similar to the way Aeneas is repre- sented as the founder of the greatness of Rome. The only philosophical work of Marulus, Psychologia de ratione animae humanae is lost and nothing is known about it. Among his historical works, the In epigrammata priscorum com- mentarius in two parts, is of special interest. The first part contains seventy-four Latin inscriptions with a commentary. These inscrip- tions are derived from written syllogae: thirty-six inscriptions come from Rome, the others from various places. The second, and more important part of the work, contains twenty-seven Roman inscrip- tions which Marulus' friend Dominicus Papalis had assembled in his small private museum from the ruins of Salona, Dalmatia. The value of Marulus' syllogae consists in the fact that he was the only one to describe this collection of Papalis after its completion. The museum was later dispersed and most of the Roman inscriptions are now lost. In this work, Marulus is in line with those humanists who contributed their share for the preservation of the values of an- tiquity. Marulus also took part in the political struggle which resulted from the Turkish invasions of Europe, from which he suffered 158</page><page sequence="19">Malcolm Vincent Timothy Wallace personally. He wrote an open letter for assistance to pope Adrian VI (Epistola Domini Marci Maruli Spalatensis ad Adrianum VI Pont. Max. de calamitatibus occurrentibus ex exhortatio ad communem omnium Christianorum unionem et pacem), published in Rome in 1522. In this letter, he asks the pope to organize the Western nations against the Turks, who threatened the very survival of the Christian religion. He pleaded that peaceful coexistence between Christians and Turks was impossible. His plea for help for the Croats engaged in the heaviest battle remained without effect, but his letter was used as an eloquent propaganda leaflet in the political struggles of his age. MALCOLM VINCENT TIMOTHY WALLACE - The Epic Technique of Silius Italicus ONE definition of classicism embraces the concept of dependence upon a great, or classical model. It can be included from the investigation of Silius' epic technique that the author of the Punica composed a poetic version of a portion of Livy's classical history (Books XXI-XXX) which he arranged in classical form, employing Virgil as his principal model. His organization of material, subject as it was to Aristotle's laws of poetic composition, was peculiarly his own. The mise-en-scene of the Punica is the Second Punic War. The theme of the poem, as expressed in the prooemium, is "the arms by which the renown of the Romans raised itself to heaven." Thus the poem concerns more than mere warfare; it is the glory of Rome, early endangered but ultimately triumphant, which the poet desired to exalt in his verses. A comparison of the portion of the Punica which describes the battle of Cannae with the account of Livy clearly demonstrates the poet's employment of his sources. In broad outline, Silius followed Livy. Within this general area of agreement, however, variations of many types are to be found. Between the two extremes of marked dependence and absolute independence may be noted instances in which the poet has transferred incidents from one context to an- other, passages involving wholesale adaptation of his source material, and poetic descriptions of events which did not take place. 1Degree in Classical Philology, I955. I59</page><page sequence="20">Summaries of Dissertations The poet did not use Livy exclusively as his source. There are grounds for belief that Silius also borrowed material from Ennius and Sallust. There are also in the poem vestiges of a source which shows resemblances to Polybius, Appian, Dio Cassius, Diodorus Siculus, and Plutarch. In geography, the poet was apparently indebted to Timaeus, Justin, Philistus, Cato, Gnaeus Gellius, Varro, and Posidonius. In all cases, the freedom with which Silius selected his material and proceeded to adapt it- and at times to depart from it- gives one key to his epic technique. It was the poet's practice to fashion, as it were, a mosaic in verse. This was composed of extracts of events, legends and information which he had adapted from his sources. In any consideration of Silius' relationship to Livy, imitatio looms large. In the composition of epic Latin verse, Silius chose Virgil as his principal model. Despite the many resemblances between the Punica and the Aeneid, differences between the poems are also evident. In the Invocations to the Muse changes in emphasis may be noted; the Catalogues of forces contain both identical and variant information; the shield of Hannibal, the Nekyia, the funeral games, battle scenes, and certain aspects of divine intervention were modeled in Silius upon the general plan of their Virgilian counterparts. Nevertheless, specific differences in Silius' treatment of each epic device may clearly be ascertained. Analysis of the structure of the Punica likewise demon- strates that Silius followed Virgil in writing his poem according to a set architectural pattern; yet even here there are differences. In addition to Virgil, the epic poems of Homer, Lucan, and Apollonius Rhodius served as models for Silius. Occasional resem- blances to Statius have also been detected. There are no grounds for believing that Silius imitated Valerius Flaccus or Petronius. As was the case with Livy, Silius' models, Virgil principally, offered the poet many opportunities for imitatio. It is clear from the poem, taken as a whole, that this imitation was deliberate. Silius introduced innovations into his verses because he was a true poet, and because he desired to escape the charge of plagiarism. To sum up, both Silius' sources (especially Livy) and his models (particularly Virgil) offered him considerable material for the con- tent and form of his epic poem. The poet employed imitatio and innovatio in his treatment of this body of material. The originality of Silius must next be considered. The poet selected the historical period of the Second Punic War for the setting of his epic poem. This is in itself a departure from Virgil and a mark of i6o</page><page sequence="21">Malcolm Vincent Timothy Wallace the influence of Ennius and possibly of Lucan. In order to unify the poem, Silius sought one central character. This is, of course, Hanni- bal, who may be considered to be the unifying force demanded by the canons of epic poetry. The hero of the poem is Hannibal's an- tithesis, the glory of Rome, ultimately personified in Scipio Afri- canus. After he had selected his mise-en-scene, the poet turned to simpli- fication and to unification as his tools of composition. He simplified masses of historical material by reducing them to their essential com- ponents, omitting all unnecessary activity. He unified, or attempted to unify, events in many theatres of war by stressing the activities of one character, Scipio Africanus, particularly after Cannae. In addition to imitation, innovation, simplification and unification of material, Silius employed characteristic devices of oratory to embellish his poem. In the speeches may be noted clear indications of Silius' oratorical training. Silius' use of the excursus is another mark of his dependence upon Virgil, Homer, and Apollonius. Yet he himself must bear the re- sponsibility for the frequent interruption of his narrative by these geographical, historical, personal, and mythological asides. Although he often chose to insert these digressions at places in the poem where a climax had either just been reached or events leading to a climax were about to unfold, it must be admitted that the length of many of the excursuses serves to emphasize the interruption of the main action. It is possible to arrive at certain conclusions concerning Silius' own opinions from selected passages in the poem. Although, from his own statement, he strove to be impartial, his theme demanded that he emphasize the glory of Rome. He did this by recalling famous examples of the past. He further criticized evils present in his own day. His words show that he was a Stoic, a patrician, and perhaps a skeptic. Similes, metaphors, and other figures of speech are effectively used in the poem. Generally, Silius' style is lucid and adorned with the standard appurtenances of epic poetry. Yet it is not characteristic of the times in which he wrote. He is markedly different from Lucan and Statius. In his simplicity and good taste he is an anachronism, closer to Virgil than to his contemporaries. He wisely discarded the traditional heroic epithet, and substituted descriptions and sketches of his historical characters. It may therefore be concluded that the epic technique of Silius i6i</page><page sequence="22">i62 Summaries of Dissertations Italicus was composed of many elements. From his historical sources he drew material for his poem. Upon his models in epic composition he based his methods of presentation and his employment of standard epic devices. He imitated, he made innovations, he simpli- fied, he unified, he made his own contributions, all in varying de- grees in different portions of the poem. Thus the Punica stands as a mosaic in verse. It is not a literary production of surpassing renown. It has many shortcomings, due largely to the poet's lack of a sense of dramatic economy. The poem is nonetheless worthy of consideration because it is a conscious anachronism, an attempt to turn back to the golden age of Latin literature and Roman history. It stands midway between the epic of Virgil and the centos of later ages.</page></plain_text>
