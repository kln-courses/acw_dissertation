Had the mulling Juliet Capulet posed her famous "what's in a name" question to the author of this work, she would have discovered that a name is not just a label ("a rose by any other name") but, at least in the ancient Near East, it could also be a statement of belief and hence a key to understanding aspects of a people's religion.</page><page sequence="2">116 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 52, 1990 In this work, Fowler provides an analysis of Hebrew names (chap. 2); a discussion of the concept of deity as revealed in these names (chap. 3); a description of the concepts of deity expressed in Ugaritic, Phoenician, Amorite, Aramaic, Old Akkadian, Ak- kadian and Palmyrene onomastica, comparing these with Hebrew concepts (chap. 4); the concluding chap. 5 compares and contrasts the Hebrew concept of deity as re- flected in Hebrew names with the concepts reflected in the names of other ancient Semites. The whole is enveloped by an introduction (chap. 1), four appendixes, twenty tables, a bibliography, an index of Hebrew names, and indexes of name elements for each of the other Semitic onomastica that she studied. Since the thrust of this study is to glimpse Israelite religion in the light of Israelite names, the analysis of names is only a means to this end. E concludes that Hebrew names reflect a number of anthropomorphic and anthropopathic concepts, e.g., love, trust, witness, light, kinsman, father, appearing, rising, seeing, hearing, remembering, etc.; concepts associated with nature, e.g., sowing and planting; con- cepts of preserving and saving, e.g., sparing, delivering, ransoming, etc. By and large, there is nothing to distinguish these from personal names attested among Israel's neighbors and one could be lulled into thinking that the piety and popular theology of Israelites were generally similar to that of their neighbors. F., however, challenges this conclusion by studying concepts of deity in the other Semitic onomastica which do not occur in Hebrew and which therefore distinguish Israelite religion from that of others. Among these she lists the absence of such polytheistic concepts as the idea that the deity creates other gods; the absence of references to female deities; the absence of feminine genitive elements such as "sister of," "daughter of; the absence of masculine genitive elements such as "child of," "name of," "suckled of"; the ab- sence of terms referring to the deity in terms of a building, e.g., "temple of," "palace of'; and the absence of terms referring to the deity in astronomical terms, e.g., "sun of," "heaven of," "lightning of." After examining twenty-nine such categories in chap. 5, F. concludes on the basis of her data that Israelite religion was monotheistic, that the deity had no consort and no children. These conclusions are not wholly congruent with those of J. H. Tigay in his recent book, You Shall Have No Other Gods . Israelite Religion in the Light of Hebrew Inscriptions (HSS 31; Atlanta: Scholars, 1986). Although Tigay 's conclusions - of which F. was unaware since Tigay's book apparently appeared after hers was in press - correspond generally to hers, he does discern some pagan names indicating that the picture was not as rosy as F. suggests. Among the pagan names that Tigay reports are DdtD, referring to a goddess; Dšrhy, referring to Ashur; Dbbcl, referring to Baal; bsy, referring to the Egyptian Bes; pšhr, referring to Horus; mrymwt, referring to Mawet/ Mot; and fbšlm, referring to Shalem. All told, he lists thirteen theophoric elements which could be considered non-Yahwistic (pp. 64-67). How are these handled by F.? She does not list DdtD and Dšrhy; she considers bcl generally to be an epithet of Yahweh meaning "lord" (but see her discussion on pp. 54-63); she does not list bsy; she has no comment on pšhr other than it is Egyptian (pp. 64, 68, 358); and although she does not appear to list mrymwt , she recognizes that the mwt element in another name could be theophoric (p. 78) and does recognize a pagan element in tbšlm (p. 68). In addition, she accepts "El" names</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 117 as monotheistic without comment, seemingly unaware of the ambiguity and opaque- ness of this element (pp. 38-44). For instance, it is a common element in Ammonite names, and the "El" of the Aramean monarch Hazael was certainly not Yhwh. These names, at least for starters, suffice to indicate that F.'s major conclusion that no evidence from the personal names can be used to prove that Israelite religion was other than monotheistic (p. 313) goes beyond the evidence of her data. Fowler's conclusions may be qualified even further. Other evidence, such as the references to "asherah" in the tomb inscription from Khirbet Beit Lei and in inscrip- tions from Kuntillet Ajrud (see D. N. Freedman, "Yahweh of Samaria and His Ashe- rah," BA 50 [1987] 241-49), the aramaized pagan version of Psalm 20 in Papyrus Amherst 63, with its mention of Baal, Adonay, and Horus (see C. F. Nims and R. C. Steiner, "A Paganized Version of Psalm 20:2-6 from the Aramaic Text in Demotic Script," JAOS 13 [1983] 261-74), and the paganizing religion of the Israelite com- munity in Elephantine must also be evaluated and considered before Israelite mono- theism can be considered the major theology of the monarchic period. In fairness to F., it must be said that she restricted her observations to the evidence of personal names; but in fairness to the larger question that she broached, it is clear that other biblical and inscriptional evidence must also be considered. Fowler's analysis of the theophoric elements in Israelite names is competent. Her interpretations are based on professional and specialized literature published through 1983 and she responsibly presents more than one possibility in cases of difficult names. Her chap. 2 (pp. 21-172) thus becomes the resource to which students of the topic will now refer for information about names. It replaces M. Noth's study, Die israelitischen Personennamen im Rahmen der gemeinsemitischen Namengebung (Stuttgart: Kohlhammer, 1928) and reflects the discoveries and insights into Semitic linguistics and lexicography made in the sixty years since that work was published. And, indeed, it is precisely because F.'s work will become the reference tool in the foreseeable future that researchers should take pains to note the comments and observations in the many reviews which will undoubtedly be written and to include them in the margins of their books. It does not, however, replace the excellent entries with their complete bibliographies and original observations written by the late S. E. Loewenstamm and others in Encyclopaedia Biblica (Hebrew), which should be used in conjunction with this book. The following remarks on chap. 2 follow F.'s order of presentation: pp. 21-38 polemicize with G. B. Gray, Studies in Hebrew Proper Names (London: Black, 1896). F. challenges his denigration of the authenticity of Yahwistic names in Chronicles and his claim that they do not actually reflect preexilic names. Her presentation of his arguments is unclear, and her counterarguments, presented in narrative and tabular form, are difficult to follow. A clear exposition of her own arguments in light of the Chronicler's restoration to grace in recent decades as a quasireliable historian would have sufficed. Use of this reviewer's study, "A Chapter in the History of Israelite Personal Names," BASOR 250 (1983) 1-16 (with which she would disagree in part) and not just its inclusion in her bibliography, would have smoothed her argument. On p. 56, the name banana* need not be connected with Anath, but with a (male[?]) counterpart of this goddess ( bacan ) attested in Ugaritic theophoric names. In her</page><page sequence="4">118 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY I 52, 1990 discussion of cn il (p. 58), E appears to prefer the biblical folk etymology of the name Jerubbaal because it supports her thesis that there was no religious syncretism in Israel during the period of the Judges; E 's collection of Hebrew names containing verbal elements in forms or with meaning unattested elsewhere in Biblical Hebrew is deserving of some additional linguistic research (p. 88); F.'s suggestion that names such as ì azanyâhû and Dēlīšāmac were given by parents who prayed for children should be checked in contexts to see if they were all first-born sons (p. 89); lēm&amp;ēl, mentioned in Prov 31:1,4 (and see Neh 12:38 where the text is obviously corrupt) may not be a name at all; cf. the LXX (p. 128); F.'s acceptance of the derivation of the name zakkay from the root zkr (p. 158) has little to commend it since the root zkh, "to be pure** is obvious and names from it^are attested at Mari. Other names that surround his on Nehemiah's list, Neh 3:20 (Q) and 7:14, are similar in that they do not have theophoric elements. F.'s book has much to commend it and much to teach students of ancient Israelite religion. It is, in professional jargon, a significant con- tribution.
