<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Jewish Spinoza Steven Nadler Among the great, dead philosophers of the early modern period, Baruch Spinoza is perhaps the most deeply fascinating but mysterious and enig matic of them all. Whether it is due to the sheer difficulty of navigating the "geometric method" and esoteric jargon of his philosophical masterpiece, the Ethics; or because so much of his life remains for us in the shadows, given the frustrating lack of extant documentation, the "real" Spinoza seems often to escape us. Thus, it should come as no surprise that Spinoza has also become one of the most mythologized (and even fictionalized) phi losophers in history. This is especially true of his relationship to Judaism. Despite attempts to "marranize" Spinoza's experience,1 his upbringing and education took place within an open, well-established, albeit not always perfectly orthodox Jewish community (because of its historical converso roots). It is true that his parents had been through the marrano experience, in Portugal and, in the case of his father, France. But Spinoza himself grew up under the watch ful eyes of the rabbis of Amsterdam's Portuguese kehilla: he attended the elementary school of the united Talmud Torah congregation, paid his dues as an upstanding member of the community, and (after taking over his father's mercantile business) most likely continued his adult studies in the 1 Yirmuyahu Yovel, Spinoza and Other Heretics.

In July of 1656, however, Spinoza was expelled from the Amsterdam Portuguese community with the harshest writ of berem (ostracism) ever issued by its leaders. The only extant documentation of this event refers to his "abominable heresies" and "monstrous deeds," but it still remains something of a mystery why exactly Spinoza was punished with such ex treme prejudice. It has been suggested recently that the cause of his expul sion lay in certain financial irregularities, in particular, because he went outside the jurisdiction of the Portuguese community to the Dutch authori ties in order to relieve himself of debts he inherited from his father, in direct violation of the community's regulations.2 However, in light of the vitriolic language of the berem, its extraordinary harshness when compared with other expulsions from the period, as well as the reference to his "heresies," it is hard to believe that it all amounted to merely a legal matter. More likely, it was a question of ideas, in particular, just the kind of bold philo sophical, theological, and religious views that Spinoza would begin express ing in his written works within a couple of years. Be that as it may, the expulsion order was never rescinded, and Spinoza lived the rest of his life outside any Jewish context. In fact, he seems not to have had any residual sense of Jewish identity. In his writings, he goes out of his way to distance himself from Judaism, and always refers to the Jews in the third person as "them." Nor does he exhibit any fundamental sympathy with Jewish his tory or culture; indeed, he seems to harbor a degree of hostility to the Jew ish people, about whom he has some very unkind things to say. And yet, it can hardly be said that Spinoza's break with Judaism was perfectly clean and complete. Things are rarely so black and white in the history of ideas, least of all with as deep and complex a philosopher as Spinoza. While he may no longer have thought of himself as a Jew, and while he even had great contempt for Judaism and other organized sectar ian religions, it cannot be denied that Jewish texts, history, and thought continued to play an important role in Spinoza's thinking, so much so that Spinoza can rightfully be considered a Jewish philosopher, both because his ideas exhibit a strong engagement with earlier Jewish philosophy and be cause in his major works he philosophized about Judaism.3 2 See Odette Vlessing, "The Jewish Community in Transition: From Acceptance to Eman cipation," Studia Rosenthaliana 30 (1996): 195-211. 3 Thus it seems perfectly right that Spinoza should appear in most recent histories of and "companions" to Jewish philosophy, either as the culmination of the medieval tradition or the beginning of the modern. See, for example, Daniel H. Frank and Oliver Leaman, 492</page><page sequence="3">Nadler The Jewish Spinoza For many years, however, a reader of the literature on Spinoza would have had little reason for thinking this. Scholarship on Spinoza in the late nineteenth century and much of the twentieth century, especially in the Anglo-American analytic tradition but also to some degree in France, the Netherlands, Italy, and Germany, was focused almost exclusively on his seventeenth-century philosophical context: primarily Descartes and Carte sianism, but also Hobbes, Leibniz, and others, including fellow Dutch thinkers of the republican political persuasion. To be sure, this is an extremely important context for understanding Spinoza's thought, and books such as E. M. Curley's Spinoza's Metaphys ics: An Essay in Interpretation and Jonathan Bennett's A Study of Spinoza's Ethics, as well as Martial Gueroult's two-volume Spinoza and Ferdinand Alquie's Le Rationalisme de Spinoza, offered great and influential insights into his philosophy.4 Moreover, it would not be fair to say that the Jewish context was com pletely ignored in this extended period. It is impossible to write about the Theological-Political Treatise (TTP) without discussing Maimonides, pri marily because Spinoza explicitly takes the author of the Guide of the Per plexed to task for his account of the interpretation of Scripture. Thus, works such as (Rabbi) Manuel Joel's Spinoza's Theologisch-politischer Traktat auf seine Quellen gepr?ft and Leo Strauss's Die Religionskritik Spi nozas als Grundlage seiner Bibelwissenschaft include comparative analyses of Maimonides and Spinoza on Biblical hermeneutic, the relationship be tween reason and revelation, and other issues.5 And then there is Leon Roth's short but valuable book Spinoza, Descartes, and Maimonides, which recognized Maimonides' influence upon Spinoza in matters beyond eels., The Cambridge Companion to Medieval Jewish Philosophy (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003). 4 Curley, Spinoza's Metaphysics: An Essay in Interpretation (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1969); Bennett, A Study of Spinoza's Ethics (Hackett, 1984); Gueroult, Spinoza, 2 vols.

This was particularly evident when scholars expressed frustration over their inability to make sense of one or another important but apparently mystifying features of Spinoza's metaphysics, epistemology, and moral philosophy for example, Spinoza's notion of the "intellectual love of God"; or the doctrine of the eternity of the mind in Part Five of the Ethics, a doctrine which, I have argued else where, can be understood only in the light of the views of Maimonides and Gersonides.7 In the philosophical literature on Spinoza in the first three quarters of the last century, studies like those of Strauss, Roth, and Joel (and, as we shall see, H. A. Wolfson) were the exception rather than the rule, and it was rare to find discussion of any kind much less a deep, system atic, and substantive one, and even less one focused on the Ethics of Spi noza in relationship to his Jewish philosophical ancestors.8 In the century after Spinoza's death, the "Jewishness" of his philosophy was practically taken for granted. It was regarded, however, primarily as a matter of Spinoza's relationship to ancient and medieval Jewish mysticism. At the end of the seventeenth century, for example, it was not uncommon to see Spinoza's philosophy especially the Ethics as deeply imbued with kabbalistic and occult themes.9 In the eighteenth century, Jacques Basnage, in his grand Histoire des Juifs, depuis Jesus Christ jusqu? present (1705), included Spinoza in his discussion of kabbalah, which he saw as the source 6 Roth, Spinoza, Descartes, and Maimonides (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1924), 143-44. Likewise, Pines has claimed that Maimonides' God is "perilously close to Spino za's attribute of thought (or to his Intellect of God)"; see his "The Philosophic Sources of The Guide of the Perplexed" his introduction to his translation of the Guide, 2 vols. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1963), xcviii. 7 Spinoza's Heresy: Immortality and the Jewish Mind (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002). 81 am concerned here mainly with the philosophical secondary literature on Spinoza and the way it addresses his relationship to earlier Jewish thought. By contrast, there has always been within the Jewish intellectual and literary tradition a tendency to recognize Spinoza as one of its own (although in very different ways throughout history). For an excellent review of this, see Daniel Schwartz, The Spinoza Image in Jewish Culture, 1656 1956 (Ph.D. diss., Columbia University, 2007). 9 See, for example, the two books by J. G. W?chter, Der Spinozismus im Juedenthumb, oder die von dem heutigen Juedenthumb und dessen Geheimen Kabbala Vergoetterte Welt (Amsterdam, 1699), and Elucidarius Cabalisticus sive reconditae Hebraeorum phi losophiae recensio (Rome, 1706). According to W?chter, the kabbalah is "Spinozism be fore Spinoza." 494</page><page sequence="5">Nadler The Jewish Spinoza of his "obscure and mystical" ideas.10 Later that century, Solomon Maimon asserted that "kabbalah is nothing but extended Spinozism,"11 an opinion that the great twentieth-century scholar of Jewish mysticism Gershom Sho lem would later second.12 The magisterial work of Harry Austryn Wolfson in the first half of the last century, however, offered a deeper and less impressionistic picture of Spinoza's relationship to earlier Jewish thought. In his two-volume The Phi losophy of Spinoza13 (Harvard, 1934), Wolfson insisted on connections be tween the ideas in Spinoza's Ethics and the doctrines of medieval Jewish rationalists such as Maimonides and Gersonides, as well as other figures. It was never any secret that Spinoza had closely studied the Guide of the Perplexed. But to claim that the highly opaque, extraordinarily difficult Ethics, which (unlike the TTP) does not once mention any other thinker by name, was also influenced by what Spinoza read in Maimonides as well as in Gersonides' Wars of the Lord, and in the works of Judah Halevi, Abra ham Ibn Ezra, and Solomon Ibn Gabirol, was a bold and original thesis. One need not accept all of Wolfson's conclusions, particularly when he suggests that most of Spinoza's philosophy is nothing but a kind of pastiche of earlier Jewish, Arabic, and Scholastic thought or when he claims that Spinoza was concerned to defend what Wolfson regards as certain tradi tional rabbinic doctrines (such as the immortality of the soul). But it can be said that Wolfson's study opened the door to seeing Spinoza as a thinker in 10 Book IV, chapter 7. Richard Popkin provides a possible explanation as to why other early modern figures believed Spinoza's philosophy to be kabbalistic; see "Spinoza, Neo platonist Kabbalist?" in Neoplatonism in Jewish Thought, ed. Lenn E. Goodman (Al bany, N.Y.: State University of New York Press, 1992), 387-409. 11 See his autobiography, Solomon Maimon's Lehensgeschichte von ihm selbst beschrie ben (Munich, 1911 [orig. 1792]), Part I, chap. 14, 162. 12 See Gershom Sholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (New York: Schocken Books, 1961), 258. This tendency has continued, to some degree, in recent scholarship. Thus, Ze'ev Levy, despite his recognition of the importance of Maimonides to Spinoza's philo sophical development, and apparently without intending to assert that Spinoza was an unqualified mystic or a kabbalist, nonetheless believes that Spinoza's "pantheism" comes from earlier, mystical trends in Judaism. "The pivotal concept of Spinoza's metaphysics, the intellectual love of God," he insists, "derives its origin . . . from mysticism"; see Baruch or Benedict: On Some Jewish Aspects of Spinoza's Philosophy (New York: Peter Lang, 1989), 28. To be fair to Levy, he does insist that "the comparisons between Spino za's thought and the kabbalah must, however, be treated very carefully and cum grano salis" (30). See also H. W. Brann, "Spinoza and the Kabbalah," Speculum Spinozanum, ed. S. Hessing (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1977); and H.

Unfortunately, few took up the challenge over the interven ing decades, as analytically oriented philosophers were more interested in dissecting Spinoza's theses and arguments in a Cartesian context (to be sure, often with great results) than in considering any properly Jewish phil osophical framework for them. Over the last twenty-five years, however, some elements of this part of the story have begun to be filled in, and now is a good time to take stock and consider the state of things. In the second half of the twentieth century, great progress was made in understanding the Sephardic and Dutch contexts of Spinoza's life and ideas. This was due in part to a number of studies that, thanks to some important archival discoveries, illuminated various aspects of the world of Amsterdam Jewry in the seventeenth century, and that consequently gave us deeper in sights into the Jewish dimensions of Spinoza's early biography and a better understanding of the personal and historical circumstances of his intellec tual development. Among these are works by the eminent historians I. S. Revah (see especially his Spinoza et Juan de fr ado), Yosef Kaplan, Jonathan Israel, Richard Popkin, and Henri Mechoulan.14 (Many of the articles by these scholars on Amsterdam's Portuguese-Jewish community and religious unorthodoxy among its former-converso members appeared in Studia Ro senthaliana, an essential journal for anyone interested in Dutch Jewish his tory and which has published over the years some crucial documents and studies related to Spinoza's life and thought.) In this regard, it is also worth noting Gabriel Albiac's La Synagogue vide, an elegant if somewhat skewed study of heterodoxy in seventeenth-century Jewish Amsterdam.15 All of this historical work was essential, of course. But it left un touched, in the post-Wolfson period, the more intricate philosophical task of identifying Jewish elements in Spinoza's thought, and doing so not im pressionistically but with solid comparative analyses and arguments. Gene vieve Brykman's short but insightful La Judeite de Spinoza considers some 14 Revah, Spinoza et Juan de Prado (Mouton, 1959).

But he nonetheless, fifty years after Wolfson, took seriously the spirit of the latter's program and began the process of looking closely at what could in fact be justifiably said about Spinoza's relationship to Maimonides (and, by implication, other medieval Jewish philosophers). While Wolf son's study was all over the place, throwing around passages helter-skelter (often without explanation), Harvey called for a more selective approach and more careful and critical scrutiny. The situation when Harvey was writing was such that he could still say that portraying Spinoza as a Maimonidean "is admittedly controversial. .. it generally has not been held that there was a distinctive Maimonidean influence on Spinoza's philosophy."18 It is hard to imagine anyone now being worried about making this kind of claim. In recent articles, Heidi Ravven,19 Carlos Fraenkel,20 Idit Dobbs-Weinstein,21 and others have rightly taken it for granted that there is much to be gained by reading Spi 16 Brykman, La Judeite de Spinoza (J.

Ravven, for example, has argued that while Spinoza certainly rejects Maimonides' view that the prophets were philosophers and that the Bible offers insights into central philosophical doctrines (particularly those of Aristotle), he nonetheless was greatly influ enced by the Maimonidean account of the imaginative character and politi cal utility of the prophetic writings in the Bible. And Fraenkel has drawn our attention to important parallels between Maimonides' God as "the causa immanens of all existents" and Spinoza's Deus sive Natura, despite Spinoza's apparent break (due to his monism) with central features of the conception of God in the medieval Jewish philosophical tradition. Mean while, volumes such as Jewish Themes in Spinoza's Philosophy, and the issue of Studia Spinozana devoted to "Spinoza and Jewish Identity" (2003) offer a wide range of studies by Spinoza experts and Jewish Studies scholars on the relationship between Spinoza's metaphysics, epistemology, moral philosophy, and political thought, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, Jewish philosophical and religious thought traditional and otherwise.22 With the appearance of Catherine Chalier's Spinoza Lecteur de Ma'tmonide: La question theologico-politique, we now have what is the first book-length and philosophically probing study of Spinoza's relationship to an earlier Jewish philosopher.23 Chalier goes much further than previous works on the TTP, all of which employ the relationship to Maimonides only tangen tially. Her stated goal is to examine the political dimensions of Spinoza's critique of Maimonides in the TTP, and especially the question of freedom of thought in a state that owes no fealty to any religious authority. Spino za's argument for a complete separation of the political and the theological (but not the political and the religious), she insists, provides the necessary context for a proper understanding of the criticisms that he directs at Mai monides. At the same time, she argues that Spinoza's "rude" dismissal of Maimonides' Guide of the Perplexed, especially its views on the interpreta tion of Scripture, should not lead us to ignore the profound importance of Maimonides to Spinoza. The fundamental question she asks, one that takes account both of Spinoza's great intellectual debt to Maimonides and his 22 Heidi Ravven and Lenn E. Goodman, eds., Jewish Themes in Spinoza's Philosophy (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2002). 23 Chalier, Spinoza Lecteur de Maimonide: La question theologico-politique (Cerf, 2006). 498</page><page sequence="9">Nadlet The Jewish Spinoza rough treatment of him, is this: why does Spinoza's theologico-political project lead him to treat so harshly, to dismiss with "un dedaine violent et une ironie mordante," someone with whom he in fact has much in common philosophically? She begins with Spinoza's critique of Maimonides' rationalist approach to the Bible and the relationship between meaning (sens) and truth (verite). Spinoza and Maimonides take opposing views on the question of whether images and words (which, for Spinoza, are products of the imagination), particularly those of Scripture, can ever lead to adequate ideas and truth. Chalier argues that Spinoza's almost exaggerated exasperation with his medieval predecessor's attempt to link the search for truth with what, for Spinoza, should be a purely semantic inquiry into the Biblical authors' in tended meaning stems from his recognition of the political use that theolo gians make of the Bible to undermine political positions to which they are opposed. But, she insists, the relationship between Maimonides and Spi noza is neither one of simple influence nor one of critical contrast. She notes the parallels between the ways in which, for both Maimonides and Spinoza, the ambiguities of Biblical texts need to be studied within their own textual contexts; and she discusses the ways in which Maimonides and Spinoza differ from "les talmudistes" (with their rabbinic devotion to the indefinite openness of meaning) by insisting that there really is only one true reading (univocite) of any Biblical verse, although for Maimonides that reading is to be found through an appeal to reason and philosophy, whereas for Spi noza it is to be found in the proper textual/historical/linguistic study of the book itself. When Chalier turns to the issue of God, there appear a number of paradoxes at the heart of the Maimonides/Spinoza opposition. While one might take issue with Chalier's claim that Maimonides' God (unlike Spino za's Deus sive Natura) is still the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, she nonetheless starts her analysis from the obvious fact that the two thinkers oppose anthropomorphism about God, grounded as it is in the sensory prejudices of the ignorant. They also agree that, in some sense, God's ac tions or ways are identical with the course of nature (although they do not mean the same thing by this claim). But they differ on the question of whether or not God (in particular, His essence) is knowable. Thus, for Cha lier, a paradox: "The philosopher who exercised the most care to avoid conceding to Biblical language any revelatory power in the domain of truth, Spinoza nonetheless defends the thesis of a true revelation, thanks to the adequate idea of God of which the sage is capable," while on the other 499</page><page sequence="10">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS JULY 2009 hand, Maimonides, the philosopher who regards the Bible as the word of the living God, transmitted by the prophets to the Jewish people and their descendents, "defends, on the contrary, the cause of negation, even of si lence . . . when it is a matter of speaking about God" (66). Indeed, accord ing to Chalier, it is precisely because Spinoza denigrates (as he does with other "faux biens") the physical text of the Bible and the status of its words that he can insist that one must transcend them toward a philosophical knowledge of God based on reason and adequate ideas; while Maimonides, wed as he is to Scripture as a source of theological knowledge, is committed to finding therein truth about God but also recognizes that it provides only the tools for a negative understanding of Him. On the crucial matter of providence, Chalier once again begins with a convergence between Maimonides and Spinoza: both stand opposed to the view of providence which requires a personal, even emotional God actively taking care of individuals to reward their good deeds, punish their sins, and ward off evils. However, the fact that Maimonides allows for the creation of the world and the possibility of miracles (understood as divine interven tions in the course of nature) or, in other words, for the ultimate contin gency of nature while Spinoza does not represents, to Chalier, a substantial difference that has great relevance for assessing their respective positions on providence. Equally important, Maimonides, but not Spinoza, believes that the true (philosophical) account of providence is to be found in the words of Scripture, properly interpreted. However, it is unclear how deep these differences go, and it can be argued that Maimonides and Spinoza agree on the nature of providence, understood as the natural consequences of intellectual understanding, and the kind of "reward" or benefits it brings to the virtuous person.24 Chalier insists that Spinoza himself, blinded by what he sees as Maimonides' continued devotion to Scripture as a source of truth in these matters, fails to take his medieval predecessor's view of providence with all due philosophical seriousness and recognize their doc trinal affinities. Once again, in Chalier's view, the real issue here is the phil osophical relevance of the Bible. The fixation of the text by a static univocity in order to discover through genealogical work . . . what its authors believed and to free the philosophical quest from the necessity of reading it again (Spinoza), and the opening up of the text, thanks to the plurivocity 24 See Steven Nadler, "Spinoza's Theory of Divine Providence: Rationalist Solutions, Jew ish Sources," Mededelingen vanwege bet Spinozahuis 87 (2005). 500</page><page sequence="11">Nadler The Jewish Spinoza of words, thus permitting and demanding an exegesis that, because it poses theoretical questions to its verses, culminates in a philo sophical truth (Maimonides), constitute two irreducible theses. (124) Everything, it seems, is infected by this fundamental disagreement between Maimonides and Spinoza over the relationship between Scripture and phi losophy. Turning to the question of prophecy, another domain where there is a clear connection between Spinoza's views and those of Maimonides, the issue is whether or not the prophetic writings hold any value in the pursuit of philosophical knowledge and, ultimately, our felicity, or must they be abandoned simply to nourishing the irrational, unthinking theological prej udices of the vulgar? For Spinoza, contrary to Maimonides, it is not that the prophets can be compared with philosophers with respect to their grasp of the truth; rather, it is that truth has nothing whatsoever to do with the prophetic vocation, grounded as it is in the imagination rather than reason. But, Chalier argues, Spinoza's deflationary analysis of Biblical prophecy is not motivated only by his political project, as he tries to undermine the usurpation of secular power by theologians who rely on the authority of prophetic texts. While he certainly is concerned with the political danger of regarding the prophets as philosophers, his account of prophecy, like his account of providence, is also intimately related to his philosophical moral project focused on "la vie heureuse." As Chalier further pursues her analyses through chapters on divine and human law, theocracy and democracy, and the love of God and salvation, the contrasts between Maimonides and Spinoza become more profound. Coming finally to the most important of all topics, she speaks of "l'anta gonisme [insurmontable] entre les deux philosophes." For Maimonides, truth and happiness are achieved through obedience to the Law and the close study of Torah; for Spinoza, they come through philosophy alone, with no need for Scripture and with human laws providing only the basic conditions of material well-being and political security that makes possible the life of reason. For the former, human (Mosaic) law is itself divine and offers the path to ultimate felicity; for the latter, the distinction between human law and divine law is clear, and only theologians seeking to usurp political power are interested in conflating the two. Chalier's book creates a virtual dialogue between Maimonides and Spi noza. We have Spinoza's critique of Maimonides, of course, but Chalier 501</page><page sequence="12">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS JULY 2009 offers compelling replies to these on Maimonides' behalf, as well as Spino za's possible counter responses. In this way, this book is not just good intel lectual history, it is good history of philosophy. It is also a book that we have needed for a long time. Chalier's book is focused mainly on Maimonides and the TTP. Other medieval Jewish philosophers (such as Ibn Ezra), as well as the Ethics, arc included in her discussion only tangentially. This means that there is still more work to be done on the broader Jewish philosophical background of the TTP; and that (given the relatively narrow focus of the articles by Rav ven, Fraenkel, et al.) we are still badly in need of a substantial study that does for the Jewish philosophical context of the Ethics (that is, of Spinoza's metaphysics, epistemology and moral philosophy) what Chalier does (albeit in a limited way) for Spinoza's theologico-political project, something that goes beyond the cut-and-paste job of Wolfson's volumes and really exam ines Spinoza's main (and often cryptic) doctrines about God, the soul, and virtue and happiness in relationship to earlier Jewish rationalist and non rationalist views. Of course, not everyone is persuaded that there is much to be learned from placing Spinoza's philosophy in a Jewish context. In a number of re cent works, Wiepe van Bunge has argued that Spinoza should be seen not as a Jewish thinker at all but as a Dutch one, and that the proper framework for understanding his philosophy involves Cartesianism and contemporary Dutch scientific and political thought.25 These, he insists, provide a more "credible context which Spinoza's philosophy can be argued to have arisen from."26 Van Bunge's primary target is Yirmiyahu Yovel's attempt to explain Spinoza's ideas as the expression of a "marrano" mindset.27 In his book Spinoza and Other Heretics: Vol. 1: The Marrano of Reason, Yovel claims that Spinoza's thought is characterized above all by what Yovel calls "the philosophy of immanence," or the idea that "this-worldly existence is all there is, as the only actual being and the sole source of ethical value. God himself is identical with the totality of nature, and God's decrees are written not in the Bible but in the laws of nature and reason" (ix). This seems 25 "Baruch of Benedictus: Spinoza en de 'Marranen,'"; "Spinoza's Jewish Identity and the Use of Context," Studia Spinozana 13 (1997 [2003]): 100-118; and From Stevin to Spi noza: An Essay on Philosophy in the Seventeenth-Century Dutch Republic (Leiden: Brill, 2001). 26 From Stevin to Spinoza, 105. 27 Yovel, Spinoza and Other Heretics. 502</page><page sequence="13">Nadler The Jewish Spinoza accurate enough. But Yovel then argues that the origins of this idea are to be found in the marrano culture of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, "the group from which Spinoza sprang." He identifies a number of characteristics typical of the Judaizing-converso consciousness. These in clude the denial of transcendence; an attention to affairs of this world (rather than to some world-to-come); a split religious identity, a kind of psychological duality expected from a group whose members are outwardly to behave as Catholics but inwardly preserve their Judaism; the use of equivocation and "dual language"; toleration versus the Inquisition; and a particular "zeal for salvation," albeit to be gained by means other than those offered by religious tradition. Yovel discerns these "main patterns of Marrano experience" in Spinoza, both in his life and in his thought. He argues, in fact, that this Judaizing-converso framework is the key to under standing Spinoza's philosophy as a philosophy of salvation and essential for making sense of both his metaphysical ideas and his ethical thought. As Van Bunge rightly points out, however, Spinoza was not himself a marrano; he was born a Jew in an open Jewish community. Moreover, the specific features of his philosophy described by Yovel?an alleged skill for equivocation, a "zeal" for salvation, the "transcendence of revealed reli gion," and so on?are not necessarily or uniquely "marrano."28 Van Bunge cautions us as well that, unless some new documentary evidence emerges, there is (contrary to what Revah and Carl Gebhardt, whose work Yovel relies on, first suggested early in the twentieth century) no reason to believe that Spinoza stands in any significant relationship to either Uriel da Costa or Juan de Prado, both erstwhile conversos convicted of heterodoxy in Am sterdam (Da Costa in 1640 and De Prado around the same time as Spi noza). There are more and less fruitful ways to put Spinoza in a Jewish context, and it is hard not to agree with Van Bunge that, as interesting as Yovel's book may be, the "marrano hypothesis" does not shed much light on either the philosopher's personality or his ideas. If Van Bunge had left it at that, then all would be fine. However, he goes further and says that he is doubtful that the Jewish context in general can shed any light whatsoever on Spinoza's philosophy. Neither Maimon ides nor any other Jewish philosopher, he claims, played a formative role in Spinoza's mature thinking. Even the account of the interpretation of Scrip ture in the TTP is, on Van Bunge's view and despite what Spinoza explicitly says, directed not so much at the Guide of the Perplexed as at the Philoso 28 "Baruch of Benedictus," 9. 503</page><page sequence="14">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS JULY 2009 phy, Interpreter of Scripture (Philosopbia Scripturae Interpres), a book written in 1666 by Spinoza's friend Lodewijk Meijer in which he offers a rationalist account of Biblical hermeneutic similar to that of Maimonides. Van Bunge's argument for the stronger conclusion is enthymatic at best.29 Sliding neatly from "marrano" to "Jewish," he can move immedi ately and without additional argumentation from the highly persuasive claim that the "marrano hypothesis" about Spinoza has very little founda tion to the stronger but less plausible conclusion that "there is no justifica tion for turning Spinoza into an essentially Jewish philosopher."30 Thus, Van Bunge insists that just because neither the Ethics nor the TTP is a "secretive" or esoteric text, and therefore they do not exhibit what Yovel considers important characteristics of marrano writing, it follows that "the portrayal of Spinoza as an essentially Jewish thinker does not convince."31 (I am not quite sure what the difference is between an essentially Jewish thinker and a Jewish thinker. But I should note that Van Bunge also moves immediately and fallaciously from concluding that Spinoza was not an es sentially Jewish thinker to concluding that there are no "crucial Jewish sources" for Spinoza's philosophy.) Sometimes Van Bunge does offer reasons that, if valid, would lend some justification to his position. He rightly rejects Wolf son's claim that (as Van Bunge summarizes it) the Ethics can be "reduced entirely to fragments of Jewish mediaeval philosophy." But he also insists that "it has proved to be extremely difficult to trace any . . . Jewish sources, most notably in his main work, the Ethics" In fact, even putting aside the case of the TTP, once one has read Maimonides' Guide or Gersonides' Wars, it is not very difficult at all to see in parts of the Ethics a kind of dialogue with those works. True, as Van Bunge points out, there is no explicit, "smoking gun" type evidence that Spinoza engaged those texts in the Ethics, since neither in the Ethics itself nor in any of Spinoza's extant letters does he mention them or their authors. But what Van Bunge calls an "absence of indications that after 1656 Spinoza was particularly interested in Jewish thought" should not be taken as indication of an absence.32 (Although I fail to see how the discussion of Maimonides in the TTP, both explicitly in the chap ter on the interpretation of the Bible and implicitly in the chapter of proph 29 As I turn critical of Van Bunge's thesis, I should note for the purpose of full disclosure that my book Spinoza's Heresy is one of the targets of his critique. 30 "Spinoza's Jewish Identity," 103. 31 Ibid., 102. 32 Ibid. 504</page><page sequence="15">Nadler The Jewish Spinoza ecy, does not constitute an indication that Spinoza was interested in Jewish thought.) And it is puzzling why trying to understand the Ethics and the TTP in a Jewish philosophical context is, as Van Bunge insists, to fall prey to "an unduly romantic assessment of Spinoza's 'solitude.'" As far as I can tell, having a serious engagement with Jewish philosophy does not preclude having friends and other important philosophical engagements (such as Cartesianism). Van Bunge asks how Jewish were the ideas of the adult Spinoza, and concludes: not so much. Arguing that if there is an "interesting" Jewish source for the works of the young Spinoza it is Leon Ebreo's dialogues, not Maimonides (or Gersonides), he reminds us how critical Spinoza can be of Maimonides and even insists that Spinoza's knowledge of Maimonides' works leaves something to be desired.33 Van Bunge ultimately concludes that those who strive to find a "Jewish" Spinoza can do so only by engaging in "strange contortions." Thus Van Bunge remains "skeptical about the philosophical relevance of Spinoza's Jewishness,"34 and insists that "the Dutch context for the his torian of philosophy ... is ultimately more interesting than Spinoza's Jew ish background."35 His resistance is puzzling, since no one would argue that the Jewish context is more important than the Dutch and Cartesian ones, or that Spinoza is "essentially" a Jewish thinker in the sense that all of his philosophy can be explained through this perspective. Contrary to Van Bunge's accusation, there is no reason why someone who wants to view Spinoza through the lens of Jewish philosophy cannot also account "for the all too obvious dependence of Spinoza's thought on Descartes and Hobbes."36 There is no reason not to be ecumenical here. There are many contexts required for the interpretation of Spinoza's thought, as well as his influence. Research into Spinoza's intellectual sources can only benefit from looking at the variety of backgrounds that make him and his thought so fascinating. Spinoza had access to a rich philosophical and religious tradi tion that was, for the most part, unavailable (because of the linguistic bar rier) or simply unfamiliar to other major philosophers of the seventeenth century. Why not take advantage of that fact and use it to try to illuminate difficult ideas that remain as relevant as ever? 33 "Baruch of Benedictus," 17. 34 "Spinoza's Jewish Identity," 100. Ze'ev Levy agrees that "the Jewish thinkers, except Crescas, exerted little influence on the shaping of Spinoza's general philosophical system" (Baruch or Benedict, 20). 35 "Baruch of Benedictus," 14. 36 "Spinoza's Jewish Identity," 103. 505</page><page sequence="16">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS JULY 2009 No one is more aware of this need to be ecumenical in the study of Spinoza and his contexts than Jonathan Israel. Israel knows as much as anyone about the early modern Amsterdam Jewish milieu and its relevance for un derstanding Spinoza's life and thought. He has done a great deal, in his books and articles, incorporating his own archival research, toward illumi nating the history of Jewish settlement and community in the Dutch Repub lic, and has added fascinating detail to our knowledge of such things as the fortunes of Spinoza's father's importing business. There can be no question that Israel's monumental Radical Enlighten ment: Philosophy and the Making of Modernity 1650-1750 (Oxford, 2001 )37 is one of the most important books on Spinoza in the last hundred years. (It is also certainly among the most popular. When I was in Amster dam recently, I walked by a shoe repair shop and saw a copy of Radical Enlightenment on the worktable.) In Radical Enlightenment, Israel is to some extent interested in Spino za's early biography and intellectual development, and he takes a stand on some of the issues discussed above. For example, he, too, rejects the sugges tion that Spinoza's "corruption" has marrano sources; and he agrees that Spinoza's herem was brought about not by ordinary religious deviance or financial irregularities but by "open, systematic, premeditated, and blatant doctrinal rebellion of a fundamental kind that simply could not be ignored or smoothed over" (172). But Israel's real focus is not on what came before Spinoza's sources, Jewish or otherwise, but on the aftermath. And on Isra el's account, which stands in great contrast with the usual view that Spinoza (unlike Descartes and even Leibniz) was followed by no disciples and had very little immediate influence, what an aftermath it was! The aim of Radical Enlightenment is to present a history of the Euro pean Enlightenment in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries that does justice to its philosophical, political, and geographical complexity. The large-scale thesis of the work concerns the scope of the Enlightenment. The most traditional way of looking at the movement is to see it primarily as a French or English phenomenon. Starting with either Descartes or Locke as the seminal figure, this approach focuses on the philosophical and scientific 37 Israel, Radical Enlightenment: Philosophy and the Makin of Modernity 1650-1750 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001). It was followed by the equally long Enlighten ment Contested: Philosophy, Modernity, and the Emancipation of Man 1670-1752 (Ox ford: Oxford University Press, 2006). As if that were not enough, a third volume is in the works. 506</page><page sequence="17">Nadler The Jewish Spinoza developments in those two countries in the seventeenth century and shows how they lead to such later luminaries as Diderot, Voltaire, and Rousseau (or, alternatively, Hume, Smith, and Reid) and to the expansion of tolera tion and the advance of reason over faith. There were radical fringe ele ments, to be sure?atheists, freethinkers, democrats?but they are peripheral to the relatively moderate main act. The call for toleration, for example, was, for this Enlightenment, a call for freedom of worship, not the freedom to think and say whatever you want. If this telling of the story is rejected because its simplicity fails to do justice to the richness of the phenomena, it is usually in favor of an overly complex narrative that prefers to see in the early modern period a "family" of Enlightenments, broken up mainly along geographical frontiers. Thus, there is supposed to be an "English" Enlightenment with its roots in Locke, a "French" Enlightenment grounded in Cartesianism, a "German" Enlight enment inspired by Leibniz and Wolff, and so on. The Enlightenment thus becomes splintered into a plurality of national movements, each relatively autonomous but with some connections and communications between them. Israel, by contrast, believes that the unity of the European Enlighten ment can and should be preserved while, at the same time, paying respect to its internal complexity and richness. There was, he argues, a single En lightenment, a movement with a general intellectual integrity and unity, albeit one that evolved over time, that transcends national boundaries. Moreover, the so-called "radical Enlightenment" was not merely a collec tion of minor and marginalized dead-end thinkers. Rather, it was central to the Enlightenment as a whole and exerted enormous influence on the course of ideas and events. Indeed, Israel insists, we cannot understand the prog ress of intellectual life in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries without taking account of its most radical elements. One figure, in particular, stands out in Israel's account: Spinoza. It is not just that Spinoza was a precursor of the Enlightenment, a common enough claim. Rather, on Israel's bold and original reading, all roads in the Enlightenment lead to and from Spinoza, as if he were a lens refracting what came before into a future not ready for his heterodox originality. The question of Spinozism is indeed central and indispensable to any proper understanding of Early Enlightenment thought. Its prominence in European intellectual debates of the late seven teenth and early eighteenth century is generally far greater than 507</page><page sequence="18">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS JULY 2009 anyone would suppose from the existing secondary literature; . . . there has been a persistent and unfortunate tendency in modern historiography to misconstrue and underestimate its significance. (12-13) Contrary to the ways in which some scholars have approached the issue of Spinoza's relationship to the Enlightenment, Israel believes that according Spinoza such a role in the genesis of the movement is perfectly consistent with doing justice to his intrinsic importance and philosophical originality. It is a stunning thesis of enormous scope, and Israel's pursuit of his case is a fine lesson in great (and nearly exhaustive) scholarship. He is too good of a scholar not to be aware of the prima facie implausi bility of his thesis: But is it likely, one might well object, or even conceiv able, that any single seventeenth-century author, let alone an aloof solitary figure raised among a despised religious minority who lacked formal aca demic training and status, can have fundamentally and decisively shaped a tradition of radical thinking which eventually spanned the whole continent, exerted an immense influence over successive generations, and shook west ern civilization to its foundations? Can one thinker meaningfully be said to have forged a line of thought which furnished the philosophical matrix, including the idea of evolution, of the entire radical wing of the European Enlightenment, an ideological stance subscribed to by dozens of writers and thinkers right across the continent from Ireland to Russia and from Sweden to Iberia? The answer, Israel insists, is a resounding yes. Whether or not one agrees with all the many strands of his argument, there is no denying the immense value of his achievement. It should be a mine for dissertations in the history of ideas in early modern Europe for years to come. I have reviewed Radical Enlightenment at greater length elsewhere.38 But to address the topic of this essay: what does any of this have to do with "the Jewish Spinoza"? Part of the answer to this depends, of course, on the extent to which one accepts the notion that Spinoza's own ideas on God, Nature, the Bible, miracles, and other topics have their source in earlier Jewish philosophy. Perhaps the Radical Enlightenment has its ancestral 38 British Journal for the History of Philosophy 10 (2002): 289-94. It is worth mention ing that Israel offers a more complex view of the Enlightenment in a recent review essay in this journal (vol. 67, no. 3 [2006]), one that emphasizes a greater distinction between three competing camps: the Radical Enlightenment, a moderate Enlightenment, and the Counter-Enlightenment. He nevertheless continues to stress the centrality of Spinozism as the engine within Enlightenment thinking. 508</page><page sequence="19">Nadler The Jewish Spinoza roots in the radical, intellectualist strain of medieval Jewish rationalism. But Israel, looking ahead rather than backward, will be more interested in any resonances or repercussions that Spinoza's philosophy might have within Jewish thought of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, in par ticular, the Haskalah, or Jewish Enlightenment. Unfortunately, while Moses Mendelssohn does get a brief mention in both Radical Enlighten ment and its sequel, Enlightenment Contested, a deeper study of Spinoza's legacy for the Jewish dimensions of the Enlightenment will presumably ap pear in a subsequent volume. What Israel does examine in Radical Enlightenment is what is, as far as we know, the only response to Spinoza to come from within the Amsterdam Portuguese community, indeed, the only Jewish response to Spinoza at all in the seventeenth century. Isaac Orobio de Castro was a Dutch Sephardic physician and intellectual. In 1684, Orobio, convinced that his initial opin ion that Spinoza's ideas would not have a significant impact was seriously wrong, published his Certamen philosophicum propugnatae veritatis divi nae et naturalis adversus Joh. Bredenburgi principia (later translated into French as the Refutation des Erreurs de Benott de Spinosa), a harsh critique of what he perceived to be the Spinozistic ideas of the Collegiant Johann Bredenburg in a book published earlier that year. "Previously," Israel writes, "he had judged Spinoza's philosophy too deficient for the learned and too abstruse for ordinary folk. Experience, however, had proved him wrong: not only had some erudite men been swayed by Spinoza's teaching but also not a few among the common people had been convinced by his 'pestilential dogmata'" (373). Israel examines Orobio's attack on the doc trine of substance monism and on the denial of a providential God, both of which Orobio believed to be central to Spinoza's system (correct) and to lead directly to atheism (debatable). Thus, one, very early Jewish response to Spinoza. Of course, Spinoza has had a tremendous legacy in Jewish intellectual, political, and literary culture, and a forward-looking examination of "The Jewish Spinoza" is beyond the scope of this essay.39 We should await with great expectations the continuation of Israel's story in the next volume as he pursues it through the end of the eighteenth century and, presumably, investigates Spinoza's influence on the Haskalah with the same erudition and thoroughness with which he pursues his influence on the Aufkl?rung. 39 See Schwartz, The Spinoza Image in Jewish Culture, 1656-1956. 509</page><page sequence="20">JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF IDEAS JULY 2009 The last quarter century has witnessed a kind of renaissance of scholarship on Spinoza, one characterized not just by an impressive number of studies, but especially by an expansion in the variety of approaches to his thought. Geographical and disciplinary differences have certainly played a role in this. Anglo-American, European, and Israeli scholars take on Spinoza in different ways, as do philosophers, intellectual historians, and religious studies scholars, and this can only be a good thing. I say, let a hundred tulips bloom. The narrower kind of analytic approach to Spinoza promi nent among Anglo-American philosophers in the mid- to late- twentieth century (Curley, Bennett, et al.) was extremely important in offering cre ative ways of looking at the major doctrines and arguments of the Ethics, and there is still much to be done in this regard. But even analytic studies cannot succeed, even on their own terms, if they neglect the kind of philo sophical contextual work that, for example, looks at the relationship be tween Spinoza's moral psychology and that of Seneca or Hobbes; or the connections between Spinoza's political ideas and sixteenth- and seven teenth-century Dutch republican thought.40 As for Spinoza and Jewish philosophical traditions, we are (thankfully) well past the time when Spinoza could be seen as a latter-day kabbalist. We need more studies like those of Chalier, Fraenkel, and Rawen, and especially ones that go beyond a Maimonidean framework and provide detailed exami nation of Spinoza's relationship (in both the Ethics and the Theological-Polit ical Treatise) to other medieval and early modern Jewish thinkers. Despite the skepticism of Van Bunge, there is much valuable work to be done here. What we must not do, however, is to become territorial and take an overly reductive approach. Spinoza was not simply a Dutch thinker or simply an unorthodox Cartesian or, for that matter, simply a Jewish thinker. Part of what makes Spinoza such an endlessly, even obsessively fascinating figure just is the fact that he, more than almost any other early modern philosopher, stands at the intersection of so many, so different traditions. University of Wisconsin, Madison. 40 There is, in fact, some variety in the degree to which analytic scholars recognize this. While Curley's work on Spinoza has shown great sensitivity to its Cartesian, Hobbesian, and Maimonidean contexts, Bennett does not believe that even Spinoza's other writings are of any use in understanding the Ethics, as he explicitly says in the opening paragraphs of his A Study of Spinoza's Ethics (p. 7). 510</page></plain_text>
