<plain_text><page sequence="1">Excavation near Ghaligai (1968) and Chronological Sequence of Protohistorical Cultures in the Sw?t Valley We recently published news of an excavation carried out in spring, 1967, in a rock shelter near Ghaligai (Swat State, W. Pakistan); it revealed an almost uninterrupted fre quentation of the site from the second half of the 3rd millennium B.C. to the Islamic period (a). The relative abundance of the finds, as well as the discovery that the strata of early occupation were still largely preserved in the area in front of the shelter, suggested that another excavation campaign might be oppottune. This was carried out between May and September, 1968, in the framework of the activity of the Italian Archaeological Mission of IsMEO (2). This second work phase involved extensions of the old trench towards the west (area F), towards the north (area G) and towards the east (area E), with a further extension of the trench on this side (area H) (fig. 1). As was foreseen, the new excavation led to a further collection of pot-sherds as well as of stone, bone and metal objects. This let us enrich the typology of the handicrafts that mark the various cultural horizons, including the oldest ones, found here for the first time in the northwest area of the Indo-Pakistan sub-continent. EXCAVATION AND STRATIGRAPHY The extension of the excavation on the east, west and north sides of the 1967 trench (areas E, F and G), revealed a stratigraphic picture similar to that already described (3), that is, characterized by the alternation of clay-sand-gravel flood deposits, and by grayish or brownish soil with varying amounts of coal impregnated with humus. C1) Stacul 1967a. (2) The Italian Archaeological Mission in Pa? kistan (Centro Studi e Scavi Archeologici in Asia, IsMEO), directed by Dr Domenico Faccenna, operates in Sw?t by excavating protohistorical stations as well as Buddhist sites, and carries on research of an ethnographical nature throughout the entire region. The 1968 excavation in the rock shelter near Gh?llgai, like that of 1967, was directed by the present writer, with the valid collaboration of local workmen. The sections were drawn by Prof. Giovanni Ioppolo; the drawings of the outlines of vases and other objects are by Prof. Vittorio Caroli and Mr Hasin Uddin Qureshi, Senior Draftsman of the Pakistan Department of Archaeology; the photographs of the vases and other objects are by Mrs Francesca Bonardi; those of the excavations are by the Author. On this occasion, I wish to express my deepest thanks to Dr F.A. Khan, Director General of Archaeology in Pakistan, for having assisted us in our task, and for having let us view the archaeological material gathered in the main mu? seums of Pakistan. (3) Stacul 1967a, pp. 186-190. 44</page><page sequence="2">Here too the upper strata show a slight downhill slope, noticeably accentuated below stratum 7 (figs. 2, 3, 21). The sudden interruption of strata 15-18, noticed during the first phase of excavations in area C (4), has been confirmed in areas E and F. The deepest strata and the rock foundation are strongly sloped; towards the bottom of the slope, the rock foundation shows the well-known splits and erosion produced by flood waters (5). In area E, at the base of stratum 12, a straight wall going E-W was isolated; this was erected to partially close off the shelter, and part of it had already been noticed during the excavation of area C (6). This wall runs west beyond the limits of the trench, is about 0.50 m. wide and has its maximum preserved height at about 0.40 m. Remains of a floor of reddish beaten earth were preserved on the S side, near the rock profile. In all of area H, the rock profile has revealed a conformation that protrudes above and slopes in towards the bottom; the most recessed points are found in strata 13-17 (figs. 3, 23-25). The presence of coal remains is especially noteworthy in this zone, and is most abundant in strata 12, 15 and 17. A large, thick hearth of baked red earth has been circumscribed; the base is almost round, and partially paved with pebbles (diam. about 2.30 m.; thickness, 0.15-0.20 m.). Still in area H, other hearths have been isolated, en? closed in stratum 13 (diam. about 1.30 m.; thickness 0.07-0.12 m.), in stratum 15 (thick? ness 0.10-0.15 m.) and in stratum 17 (thickness 0.08-0.15 m.). The latter, of purplish baked clay, was crossed by thin layers of gray ash and whitish clay. A tunnel whose opening is 1.50-1.70 m. penetrates into the rock for about 3 m. at the height of strata 16 and 17 (area H); its floor has a slight constant rise. Various bone instruments have been found in a small recess. Excavation of area G has shown, in all the strata of frequentation, a progressive thin? ning-out downhill of coal remains and handicrafts. The longitudinal section of the area (uphill-downhill) is modified here (fig. 2): strata 6 and 9 grow smaller and finally disappear altogether; the thickness of stratum 7 increases, as does that of stratum 14a in particular, showing thick inclusions of small gravel and sand alternating with clay deposits, beside the N wall (fig. 22). In area G, the excavation stopped at the base of stratum 23, directly superimposed here on stratum 25; the latter is formed by a flood deposit of sand and pebbles that a sounding carried out in the first phase of the excavation showed to be sterile (7). Part of a hearth paved with pebbles, already partly brought to light in the 1967 excavation (8), was enclosed in stratum 21. Nearby, animal remains were found, among them stag-antlers and a boar-tusk. Further extension of the excavation downhill was made impossible by the closeness of the Malakand-Mingora asphalted road, which lies barely 8 m. from the far N end of the trench (figs. 19, 20).

We shall now present this material in stratigraphic succession, from bottom to top. The pottery varieties are indicated by two small italic letters: the first stands for the stratum or group of strata from which they come, according to a criterion of classification already partly adopted in the preceding report (9) (a: strata 24-21; b: stra? ta 19 and 18; c: strata 17 and 16; d: stratum 15; e: upper strata); the second italic letter indicates the kind of paste (a, b, c, etc.). For the types of handicrafts already fully described in our first report, we refer the reader to the above-mentioned publication (10). Strata 24-21 The material that bears witness to the oldest frequentation of the site consists of hand? made pottery remains, together with pebble and bone implements. The pebble tools are relatively abundant; but they are absent in the lower part of stratum 24 (where we did not find coals or any other trace of frequentation), while they grow rare in the upper part of stratum 21. The pottery, on the other hand, comes mostly from stratum 23; it is found too, but proportionately less, in stratum 21, while only a few fragments come from the sur? face of stratum 24. Despite this, the fact that there are fragments of paste present in the latter stratum, which are wholly similar to that common in strata 23 and 21, associated with a stone industry essentially analogous to that of the two above-mentioned strata, lets us consider the material found in strata 24-21 as a unified whole, expression of an identical cultural period. Three Radiocarbon analyses, carried out on coals found in the 1967 ex? cavation, supplied the following dates: stratum 21: 2230 ? 70 B.C. and 2295 + 55 B.C.; stratum 23: 2250 + 140 B.C. (X1). Pottery The pottery is all handmade. On the basis of the kind of paste, we find one main variety above all: aa) Pottery of red-brown, yellow-red or drab paste, tempered with coarse sand, with grainy surfaces (12). (9) Ibid., p. 190: variants from the earlier report are indicated on the pages that follow. (10) Some repetitions were found to be neces? sary when a more precise and detailed classi? fication became possible, on the basis of the new material collected, especially regarding the pottery. i11) Alessio 1969.

Some vases (aa) show traces of slip on both the outside surface of the vase and on the inside of the rim; it was probably obtained through immersion in a very thick colour? ing substance (red or brown colour). In certain vases, the inner surface of the rim is also burnished.

Stone Implements All the artefacts collected from strata 24-21 are made from pebbles (flaked pebbles and pebble flakes), mainly of granite (prevailing in strata 24 and 23) or limestone (stratum 21). Most are obtained through primary flaking, without any subsequent retouching. Pebble artefacts include specimens with massive sides, and with merely unifacial flaking, probably used as scrapers, and specimens with alternate flaking. One should also include the discoidal cores (figs. 35, 36), the pseudo-pyramidal points (fig. 44) and the flakes in quarter orange shape (figs. 45, 46) (13). In addition to these types, we have also collected some large thin flakes of pebbles, oval in side-front (fig. 43) or shaped like a shouldered hoe (figs. 37, 38).

Remarks For the moment, the stone implements from the oldest frequentation levels of the site bear no resemblance to similar handicrafts of the protohistorical age found in the north? western area of the Indo-Pakistan sub-continent. The most interesting example, clearly distinguished from the generally improvised and rudimentary level of this production, is a shouldered hoe (?), minutely worked on one face (figs. 37, 38). Typological comparisons for this type of production can be made with the shouldered hoe of the neolithic period, so widespread in the sub-continent's eastern regions, and generally throughout the entire southeast Asian area (14). It is interesting to note, in this respect, that such implements are (14) Krishnaswami 1960, p. 53; Wheeler 1959, pp. 83-92. 49</page><page sequence="10">sometimes associated with a type of axe or small hoe made of a thin pebble-flake, oval in side-front (15), similar to another example brought to light in the same strata at Gh?ligai (fig. 43). As regards the vase-shapes, they show ? as already pointed out in our earlier re? port (16) ? some similarities with examples common to Chalcolithic settlements in Soviet Turkmenistan. Especially interesting, among the material brought to light during the recent excava? tion, is a biconical vase with a very pronounced carination in the middle of the body (fig. 4b). A similar shape is found in Turkmenistan in phase II of Geoksjur (17), in phase II of Anau (18), and at Yassy-Tepe in a phase contemporary with Namazga-Tepe I (19). With some variations in the rim it also present at Sialk, in Iran, in phase III, 7 (20), at Mundigak, in Afghanistan, in phase III (21), as well as in the graveyard of N?l in Baluchistan (22). Even the custom of burnishing the vases only on the inner part of the rim (fig. 4a, d), is met with in Turkmenistan in the Anau phase mentioned above (23). The presence of pottery of fair quality in workmanship and texture, at times finely polished and finished, along with generally rudimentary stone industry, does not, in our opinion, necessarily imply a contradiction. Let us point out, to begin with, that the persistence of the pebble implement in the protohistorical age is a far from unusual fact, and not only on the sub-continent. Such a persistence may be related above all to the morphological conditions of the environment, in this case to the presence of large rivers that offer, as does the Swat, an almost inexhaust? ible supply of raw material for stone handicrafts. The unlimited availability of pebbles, in the forms, sizes and quality of stone preferred, which can be easily cut into sections and segments with points or blades (as seen at Gh?ligai with the recurrence of pseudo-pyramidal points and quarter-orange flakes), as well as the tendency (accentuated at Gh?ligai in stratum 21) to use very soft limestone (evidently easy to use as a substitute for worn or broken tools), may partly explain the rudimentary level of the production, and its quality of impro? visation and casualness; this is basically the lack of real artisan specialization, as formed in other cultures through the process of extracting large blocks from quarries, with their sub? sequent systematic reduction. It is not unlikely, though, that the persistence in Sw?t, in the Chalcolithic age, of a rudimentary industry of pebble tools, associated with bone instruments that are simply chipped, may also depend on the special kind of people who frequented the shelter. This is suggested by the animal remains (stag antlers, boar tusks) that show economic activity (15) Krishnaswami 1960, p. 61; van Heeke ren 1957, pi. 22, D. (16) Stacul 1967a, p. 205.

It is also possible that such human groups lived on the margins of other communities (agricultural?) with already established settle? ments; this hypothesis seems all the more likely if one thinks of the relatively brief period of time separating this cultural phase (mostly included, according to the dating analyses made with the Radiocarbon method, between 2400 and 2100 B.C.) from the far more highly evolved one met with in the frequentation strata immediately above (strata 19 and 18), which are more or less contemporary with that of the Indus civilization. Strata 19 and 18 The material found consists almost exclusively of pottery remains. There are very few flaked pebbles, all with atypical shapes. A Radiocarbon analysis, carried out on coals found in stratum 18, in the 1967 excavations,registered the dates 1810 ? 55 B.C. (24). Pottery All the vases are wheel-turned. The following varieties can be distinguished on the basis of the kind of paste: ba) Fine-textured pottery, well-fired and hard-tempered, with paste varying from pinkish to pinkish-brown or cream colour; surfaces are extremely smooth and occasionally bur? nished. bb) Fine-textured and well-fired pottery, not very hard-tempered, with paste varying from red to brick-red colour; surfaces are often dusty to the touch, generally smoothed down; in some large vases the lower part of the body is granulated, slipped with sand. One finds less frequently: be) Fine-textured pottery, well-fired and hard-tempered, with brown paste; surfaces are smoothed and burnished. bd) Fine-textured pottery, well-fired and hard-tempered, with paste of drab colour. The ba type distinguishes most of the production of stratum 19, where types be and bd also appear. Type bb is found almost exclusively in stratum 18. Painted decoration, found on most vases in this cultural period, consists basically of horizontal black bands on a pink or brownish--pink slipped background (ba), or on a bright red background (bb); only a few fragments present a decoration of dark purple horizontal bands on a grayish-brown background (bd). The wavy line painted in black is also present (fig. 6c). Some vases show a decoration of multiple vertical lines, obtained with burnishing (light lines on opaque background) (figs. 7a-c, 30). (24) See above, note 11. 51</page><page sequence="12">Some fragments of large vases, all from stratum 18 (bb), have a decoration made of cord marking impressions (fig. 29). A single vase is characterized by an incised decoration made of wavy comb-like bands, executed with five-tooched implements in conjunction with grooves (figs. 5b, 26, 28). Selected pottery: Fig. 5a - Pinkish-brown jar (ba) with everted rim and ring-base; painted with horizontal black bands around the rim, the neck and the shoulders. Part of body is missing.

Remarks The material found in these strata, characterized on the whole by fine, well-turned ceramics that are often painted, makes up a complex totally different from the handicrafts of the strata underlying the present ones. Nevertheless, a distinction must be made between the pottery from stratum 19, where most of the pottery is extremely fine, with a red or reddish-brown surface, and that of stratum 18, where the paste is not too compact as a whole, while the surface colour varies from brick-red to bright red. The most common shape found among the vases of stratum 19 is the jar with high collar and slightly everted rim, decorated with simple horizontal black bands (fig. 5a, c) (25). A similar type is found at Harapp? in Cemetery R. 37 (26), at Mundigak in the levels of Period IV (27), at Amri in level III A (28), at Kot Diji among the Harappan production of stratum 4 (29) and at Kalibangan in the Harappan levels of Period I (30).

Some of these vases have a burnish pattern made up of almost ver? tical lines (which in certain cases form very narrow zig-zags) (figs. 7a-c, 30). Similar pat? terns (painted) are known in Chalcolithic sites in northern Baluchistan, above all ajt Sur Jangal (32), Loralai (33) and Periano Ghundai (34). We have other correlations with Baluchistan pottery in the type of incised decoration made up of wavy comb-like lines (figs. 5b, 26, 28), found again in the production at Pe? riano Ghundai (35), Rana Ghundai (36) and Anijra (37). Still others exist for the motif of wavy or festoon lines (fig. 6c), common among the painted pottery of Periano Ghun? dai (38). This last site also has pottery that resembles the fragments of large vases with cord-marked impressions on the body (fig. 29) (39). On the basis of further data, it is probable that the Gh?ligai phase being examined here may eventually be divided into two sub-phases, characterized respectively by a pre? valence of pink {ba) and red [bb) pottery. The over-all period of its duration may generally be dated from the end of the 3rd to the first quarter of the 2nd millennium B.C., that is, more or less contemporary with the development cycle of the Harapp? culture (40). Strata 17 and 16 These have offered a large amount of pottery, along with pebble and bone implements made by simple flaking. Most of the material comes from stratum 17. The Radiocarbon analysis, made on coals found in stratum 17 during the 1967 excavations, gave the date 1505 + 50 B.C. (41). Pottery All the vases are handmade. The clay varieties are as follows: ca) Gray or gray-brown pottery, clay slightly purified, often reddish-crimson inside the thickest points; surface rough and often spotty due to non-uniform exposure to baking. cb) Light gray pottery, clay slightly purified, surface porous and soft to the touch. cc) Light or pinkish-brown pottery, clay slightly purified, with silica fragments clearly visible in cracks and on the surface; the outer surfaces are opaque, the inner sometimes show close, irregularly-drawn ribs.

Stone Implements The production of pebble tools, almost absent in strata 19 and 18, reappears here. It differs, however, from such tools as found in strata 24-21. Along with a large number of atypical flakes, all of limestone and small in size (42), where it is often hard to distinguish the products of intentional work by human hand (even if some of these flakes bear clear signs of use), one finds some tools whose edges have been carefully retouched (figs. 47, 48) and others that fall into a well-known typology that is extremely widespread (figs. 51-52).

Remarks There is a very sharp difference in quality between the handicrafts of strata 19-18 and those of the cultural horizon we are now reviewing (43). The pottery, limited in its variety of shapes and very crudely made, shows an evident regression in technique in regard to the production of the preceding phase. The generally poor picture of the culture is confirmed by the reappearance of the manufacture of pebble-tools, along with the implements made from splinters of animal bones. Such a radical change from the preceding horizon can obviously not be explained away as due to merely occasional influences. It should more likely be related to the brusque su perimposition of a new culture, far different in origin from the preceding one, and whose appearance may perhaps be connected with extremely significant migratory phenomena. It may not be an accident that about the same time, in the second quarter of the 2nd millennium, sudden upsets and deep changes took place in different localities between the (43) Ibid., p. 207. 56</page><page sequence="17">Indus Valley and the Caspian Sea. Such upsets, attributed to expansion movements of Central Asian peoples, have been linked by various scholars to the spread of Indo-Euro? pean currents into the sub-continent (44). These are met with at Rana Ghundai and Dabar Kot in Baluchistan, at Mundigak in Afghanistan, at Tepe Hiss?r, Tureng Tepe and Sh?h Tepe in northern Iran, as well as at various stations in Soviet Turkmenistan. The arrival of the new culture at Mundigak, shown in phases V and VI, marked the disappearance of fine, well-turned pottery, similar in some respects to the Harappan; in? stead, we find crude pottery, handmade, and limited in the variety of shapes, some of which may be compared with vases found at Gh?ligai in the strata we are discussing (45). As at Rana Ghundai the phase above the destruction levels (R.G. IV) marks the affir? mation of new shapes and techniques, here, along with ornamental motifs of the post Harappan culture of Jhukar, other still scarcely-documented elements appear; let us point out among these the significant presence of a coarse plainware, whose hand-made shapes remind us of pottery present at Gh?ligai in stratum 15 (46). From the view-point of typological comparison, we find the main correlations for the present horizon at Gh?ligai with a culture found in various localities of Kashmir, that is apparently ? neolithic ?, judging from the typology of the handicrafts (47). In fact, here as at Gh?ligai, we find crude, handmade pottery, gray, drab and opaque-red in colour, often characterized by mat-impressions on the outer surface of the base (48). Let us note that in Kashmir, as in Sw?t, this phase is followed by a horizon marked by the presence of bur? nished black, gray-black and buff vases (49). Recent Radiocarbon datings suggest the hypothesis that the oldest ? neolithic ? culture of Kashmir may in some way have determined the arrival of the ? barbaric ? phase shown in strata 17-16 at Gh?ligai. In Kashmir, in fact, phase I at Burzahom began its develop? ment in the second half of the 3rd millennium B.C. (50), while at Gh?ligai (and probably in the whole Sw?t Valley) the present phase should be referred to an era later than the Indus civilization. In Sw?t, then, there eventually took place the phenomenon ? far from unusual in phases of protohistorical civilization ? of a culture with the tools and artifacts typical of the neolithic world, succeeding to a more evolved Chalcolithic phase (it is quite probable that the human groups that produced the pottery of strata 19 and 18, made use of metal tools as well as of the fast wheel, like the peoples of the Harapp? cul? ture, which we referred to for various comparisons involving this horizon). We should state, however, that further data from other excavations will be necessary to enlarge our knowledge of the precise characteristics assumed in Sw?t by the ?barbaric? culture discussed here.

There are, however, various objects of stone, bone, shell and copper (the latter particularly signi? ficant, because no metallic object had been found in the underlying layers). Pottery Pottery remains can be divided into various kinds of paste: da) Black, black-gray or buff burnished pottery with compact surfaces, soapy in texture, sometimes spotted as a result of imperfect oxidation; paste fairly purified. db) Gray pottery, paste fairly purified, with opaque and slightly porous surfaces. dc) Pottery varying in colour from gray to buff, paste slightly purified, surfaces rough and granulated, sometimes slipped with sand. dd) Red pottery, paste fairly purified, surfaces dusty to the touch, sometimes slipped with sand. de) Brick-red or red-brown pottery, paste slightly purified, often gray inside the thickest points. The da and dc types are likely all handmade; the remaining types are mainly wheel made. The da type sometimes has painted decorations, made of horizontal black bands (on a gray or buff background); similar black bands appear in the dd variety. Incised grooves are only found on the db type, while the cord-mark impressions are present on large vases of the dd type. In the da variety, a decorative pattern is obtained also with the burnishing (light vertical or almost vertical lines on opaque background). The dc variety can be identified with a kind present in strata 17 and 16 (cd). The dd variety bears strong resemblance to the pottery prevalent in stratum 18 (bb).

Remarks In the first report on the excavations at Gh?ligai, we pointed out the presence, in (stratum 15, of some vase fragments referable to the culture of the protohistorical graveyards of the Sw?t Valley, explored some years ago (52). The same stratum now supplies us with other shapes that confirm this correlation (figs. lOj, 1 If): we mean precisely the pottery that can be found in tombs from the archaic period in the graveyards of K?telai I and Loebanr I. The Radiocarbon method has supplied datings for these that lie within the second half of the 2nd millennium B.C. (53). But the pottery mentioned above makes up only a part of that found in the stratum under discussion. Another part is similar only in shape to common types of K?telai I or (52) Tucci 1958; Tucci 1963a, b; Silvi An tonini 1963; Faccenna 1964; Stacul 1966a. (53) Stacul 1967b, p. 232 (grave no. 61 of Loebanr I: 1520 ? 150 B.C.; grave no. 54 of Loebanr I; 1030 ? 150 B.C.). In our report 1967b, the analysis relative to grave no. 61 of Loebanr I, is referred by mistake to grave no. 21 of the same graveyard. 61</page><page sequence="22">Loebanr I, differing in the quality of the paste and in production technique (54). Finally, other vases have nothing in common with the standard production in these graveyards. The burnished black-gray or buff vases and the jars with rippled rims described above are definitely extraneous to the culture of the protohistorical graveyards hitherto known to us in the Swat Valley. The presence of similar ware was not documented in the Valley until the excavations at Gh?ligai; and not even at Gh?ligai did there exist data that might permit the definition of the chronological position of this horizon in regard to the culture of the gra? veyards, since both are documented in stratum 15 only. A single element let us instantly suppose that the preceding horizon may have been that of the burnished black vases: that is, the fact that some of these vases showed clear impressions of mats on the base, like most of the pottery found in the underlying strata 17-16. Precise confirmation of this was only made possible after a very recent sounding made about 3 km. W of Gh?ligai, at the foot of the hill of Barikot, formerly described by Sir A. Stein (55). This excavation brought to light superimposed mural structures and certified the fact that the horizon with burnished black vases is immediately antecedent to a phase that corresponds to the archaic period of the graveyards. Again quite recently, the same cultural horizon has been localized at Loebanr III as well, on the summit of a very steep hill about 1 km. W of the graveyard of Loebanr I (56). The material found, collected in the earth-fill stratum of a storage-pit cut into the clayey soil, reflects a very homogeneous complex, with a clear preponderance of the burnished black-gray vases and the domestic granulated jars with rippled rims and mat-impressions. Typological comparisons between the pottery from stratum 15 at Gh?ligai, the deepest frequentation level at Barikot and the underground deposit at Loebanr III, reveal very punctual and precise similarities in the shapes and quality of the material (see figs. 9-12). As regards areas outside the Sw?t Valley, the horizon under discussion permits us above all to make some comparisons with a phase present in the graveyard of Kherai, lo? cated on a steep slope dominating the Gorband Valley, almost at the junction between this valley and the upper Indus Valley (57). Many of the Kherai vases show shapes very like those common to the Gh?ligai-Barikot-Loebanr III horizon (58), while the presence of the burnished black ware is also met with in that same graveyard (5f).

(59) Ibid.} fig. 4f. 62</page><page sequence="23">Still further east, beyond the Hazara region (where systematic research still has not been carried out), a cultural horizon including burnished black-gray vases with mat-impres? sions on the base, and with shapes similar to those found in Swat, is amply documented in Kashmir, near Srinagar (60). Especially at Burzahom, where it was first identified, this horizon (neolithic phase II) develops an antecedent phase (neolithic phase I) which we have already connected with the Gh?ligai horizon present in strata 17-16 (see p. 57). Apart from various typological similarities between the pottery found (61), phase II at Bur? zahom also shares with the Gh?ligai-Barikot-Loebanr III horizon the use of polished stone and bone instruments, some of them destined here too specifically for fishing (62). We have already noted that, according to some scholars, the above-mentioned phases in Kashmir should be related to the influence of currents from northern China (6S). It is significant that the Chinese Neolithic culture of Lung Shan, referable to the first half of the 2nd millennium, shows the presence of very fine burnished black ceramics, some with carinated shapes; these shapes partially recall the type of the burnished black and gray production of Sw?t (M). As suggested in Stein's hypotheses, the most probable way of penetration from the north into Kashmir and the Indus Valley was perhaps a series of passes, relatively easy to cross; they link the Gilgit Valley with Wakhan and Chinese Sin-kiang, on the one hand, and on the other, the Chitral Valley with Badakhshan and the Oxus Valley (65). It is thus quite likely that, as far back as the protohistorical age, these valleys served as the most direct way of communication between Central Asia and the Indo-Pakistan sub-continent. We still cannot forget that ? as regards specifically the origins of the production of the black-gray and buff burnished ware of Sw?t ? there are far closer comparisons possible with the black-gray pottery of Tepe Hiss?r, which some scholars think had widespread in? fluence even in the East, and may even explain the origins of the black ceramics of Lung Shan in China (66). The typological identity between shapes from Tepe Hiss?r and shapes common to the Gh?ligai-Barikot-Loebanr III horizon are at times extremely precise. They thus support the comparisons already made between pottery from Tepe Hiss?r and that of the most ancient graves of K?telai I and Loebanr I. We can point out in particular that the red cups on conical pedestals ? so common in the graves mentioned, and typologi cally similar to black-gray vases from Tepe Hiss?r (67) ? are undoubtedly derived from examples from the black-gray ware that characterizes the horizon of Gh?ligai-Barikot-Loe? banr III (fig. lla-d).

For comparisons see: Stacul 1966a, pp. 67fi. 63</page><page sequence="24">What ways were taken by the currents that spread the black ware into the northwestern regions of the Indo-Pakistan sub-continent? We can only offer pro? visional working hypotheses in answer to this question. There is certainly significance in the fact that we find in northern Baluchistan, as in Sw?t, black, gray and buff pottery, sometimes painted (Black-on-Buff) (68). Red pottery with cord-marked impressions is met with in Baluchistan too (Jhukar phase?) (69), and this is linked at Gh?ligai with the black pottery mentioned above. Nevertheless, there are other aspects that make the problem a highly complex one. It must be noted that the phase under examination is partially an evolution of the preceding phase (Gh?ligai strata 17-16), as shown too in comparisons with Kashmir. Then again, the presence of underground dwellings or deposits, in Kashmir as at Loebanr III, is a sign of the influence of environmental currents from the north, accustomed to temperate or cold climates (70). The origins of the plainware with rippled rims must also be investigated more thoroughly; this ware is usually made up of large rudimentary jars or vases, found in various protohistorical sites in the northwestern regions of the sub-continent (71). At least for the moment, then, any conclusions must be considered premature. What seems clear is that the northwestern regions of the sub-continent ? and especially Sw?t ? were exposed, during the period under discussion, to a prolonged renewal of cultural waves coming from without, accompanied by sudden upheavals with their relative wide? spread phenomena of immigration on a large scale. This climate of instability makes de? fensive needs predominate, and leads the communities to settle in hill zones of difficult access, as shown by some of the areas in which remains of this culture were found. The contemporary presence of elements referable to different cultural traditions can be ascribed to that same climate of instability; we have seen this above all in our examination of the pottery found in stratum 15 at Gh?ligai, revealing a variety of pastes and production tech? niques not met with in other strata. We feel obliged to advise the reader, though, that the cultural phase we have just examined is at the moment only known in relation to very restricted soundings and ex? cavations, even though it can be found in various localities of Sw?t. We must therefore wait for further developments in research ? here we are mainly thinking of the system? atic excavation of settlements that go back to the second half of the 2nd millennium B.C. (Aligr?ma, Barikot Ghundai) ? to get a clearer picture of the phases described above. (68) Stein 1929, pp. 74, 76; Fairservis 1959, pp. 365, 367, 383, 385. (69) Fairservis 1959, fig. 51f.

Very little has come from the upper strata, though; that is evidently due to the fact that the increased level of the ground limited the frequentation of the site, by reducing the amount of sheltered area under the protection of the rock. Pottery All the pottery is wheel-turned. The following varieties, based on the kind of paste, can be established: ea) Pottery of red paste, well-fired and hard-tempered, sometimes soapy to the touch. eb) Pottery of red paste, tempered with coarse sand, and with silica fragments clearly visible in the cracks and on the surface. There are only scarce fragments of: ec) Pottery of black-gray paste, well-fired and hard-tempered, sometimes with polished surfaces (in stratum 12 only). The most common type of decoration is that of grooves obtained mechanically by the use of the wheel (ea, eb). The wavy incised lines are only found on pottery from stratum 12 (ea). Fragments of rims with ? frilled? projections are found in stratum 3 (eb). Very few pieces are painted, and in that case the motifs always consist of horizontal black bands, present in different strata (ea, eb).

Remarks For the chronological classification, we think it is significant that sculpture fragments of green schist, referable to the art of Gandh?ra, were found in stratum 9, along with pottery types that go back to the Kus?na era (72). (72) Cf. fig. 14a with Wheeler 1962, fig. 33, no. 295; see also Stacul 1967a, p. 216. 81</page><page sequence="57">The discovery in stratum 3 of two jar rims with ? frilled ? projections, clearly refe? rable to the Islamic period, is also important. Pottery with similar decoration has been found at Ch?rsada I, above level 7 (73). Eight silver coins, all from the first decades of the 17th cent., and found in a small recess at the height of stratum 3, also date from the Islamic period (74). Their stratigraphical attribution remains uncertain, because of the exceptional accumulation of rubble, which made it impossible to follow the order of the strata near the rock profile. SUMMARY AND CHRONOLOGICAL SEQUENCE As we have seen, the excavation in the rock shelter near Gh?ligai furnished important hints for a first general picture of the proto historical cultures of Swat and the north? western regions of the sub-continent. Various phases, present at Gh?ligai, are documented for the first time in these regions. Others, known before, can now be placed with greater confidence, not only on the level of relative chronology, in relation to other cultural horizons, but also on that of absolute chronology, on the basis of data recently supplied by the Radiocarbon method. We think it possible, then, to try to trace a first summary outline of the cultural periods that followed one another in the Sw?t Valley in the protohistorical age, if only limited to the main handicraft industries, with special reference to pottery production (fig. 18). This will naturally be a temporary picture, open to further integration, and to the possibility of eventual subdivisions into sub-phases or sub-periods, as we have already remarked earlier. Starting from the oldest period, the succession we find is the following: Period I This is known from the finds from the deepest levels of frequentation at Gh?ligai (strata 24-21), which form a homogeneous complex and bear witness, at least for the moment, to the oldest phase of protohistorical civilization in the northwestern regions of the sub-continent. On the basis of the data resulting from the Radiocarbon method, it may approximately be dated from between 2 400 and 2100 B.C. The pottery is all hand? made, tempered with coarse sand, and with a surface colour varying usually from red-brown to gray-brown. Most of the vases show traces of slip and some even have their inner surface burnished. The partially reconstructed shapes include jars with everted rims, hemi? spherical bowls, and biconical vases; certain shapes can be compared with common types in (73) Wheeler 1962, p. 80 and fig. 36, no. 326. (74) They are going to be published by G. Oman in the next issue of EW. 82</page><page sequence="58">Chalcolithic stations of Soviet Turkmenistan. The stone handicrafts are all made from pebbles, mainly with pyramidal points, half-moon flakes and flakes with wide, flat bodies, some showing a shouldered-hoe profile. We also find tools made from animal bones. Animal remains, including stag antlers and boar tusks, lead us to think that in this period those who frequented the shelter practiced, at least partially, hunting activities. Period II This phase too is documented only in the shelter near Ghallgai (strata 19 and 18). The finds consist mainly of pottery, which is made of very fine paste and wheel-turned; the colour is mainly pink or pinkish-brown (in stratum 19) or red (in stratum 18). Painted decoration is common, and generally consists of horizontal black bands; one rarely comes across stamped or incised vases. Most of the forms found in stratum 19 are jars with narrow necks and everted rims; there are also vases with concave sides, cups on pedestals, plates or basins with widespread sides. There are typological correlations with pottery known in Chalcolithic stations of northern Baluchistan and the Indus Valley, the latter referable to the period of the Harapp? culture. A Radiocarbon dating, made on coals found in stratum 18, gave 1810 + 55 B.C. Period III This is a cultural period far different from the preceding one; it is documented in the shelter near Ghallgai (strata 17 and 16) and at Butkara I, where remains of pebble constructions have been located. The vases are all handmade, of very crude paste; there are mat-impressions on the base. The surface colour varies from gray-brown to red-brown. Prevalent shapes are globular vases with deep bodies, and wide bowls. The stone and bone handicrafts include flaked instruments, often with signs of accurate working on the borders, but without any trace of polishing. Some typological correlations can be made with ? neo? lithic ? phase I at Burzahom in Kashmir. A Radiocarbon dating, on coals found in stratum 17 at Ghallgai, gave 1505 ? 50 B.C. Period IV This cultural period is present in the shelter near Ghallgai (stratum 15), in construc? tions with pebble walls near Barikot, as well as at Loebanr III, where a storage-pit cut into the clayey soil has been brought to light. In Sw?t itself, there is a phase that is probably contemporary, that of the graveyard of Kherai, in the Gorband Valley. The par? ticularly rough hill-country met with in some localities seems to show that in that period there was great concern for adequate defense. This horizon only partly reflects continuity with the culture of the preceding period, shown by the presence of very rudimentary jars and other pottery with mat-impressions on the base. Most of it shows the presence of new elements, especially in regard to the production of burnished, gray and buff vases, generally 83</page><page sequence="59">handmade, but always of rather fine quality. At times, the gray or buff vases are painted with horizontal black bands. There is a small amount of red, wheel-turned pottery, it too painted with black bands. The stone and bone tools are all more or less accurately polish? ed, and there are signs of metal production in copper. This horizon also shows perforated discs of schist or terracotta, the latter obtained from pottery fragments. Typological cor? relations can be made with phase II at Burzahom in Kashmir, and with pottery types common to Tepe Hiss?r II B - III B. Period V This period corresponds to the archaic phase of the protohistoric graveyards of the Sw?t Valley (75) also present in the shelter near Gh?ligai (stratum 15). The graves are located on hillsides, cut into the ground and covered with stone slabs. In some localities, this cultural phase also shows the presence of graves in cist shape, with sides and floor made of slabs. As for the funeral rite, cremation prevails over inhumation. The settlements too lie on the hills, and are made up of rectangular constructions, with stone walls; the stones are polygonal and roughly blocked out. We also find circular wells for storing water. The pottery is mainly wheel-turned and has a wide range of forms. Metal handicrafts are all in copper. There are very few remains in bone (76). The main correlations are with graves in the graveyard of Timargarha in the nearby region of Dir (77), as well as with pottery from the deepest levels of the settlement of Ch?rsada (78). Other significative compa? risons can be made with the gray ware with button base usually found in phase V at Ha sanlu, and generally in the Iron Age I Period of Western Iran (ca. 1300/1250-1000 B.C.) (79). Radiocarbon tests give this horizon dates from the second half of the 2nd millen? nium B.C. Period VI This period corresponds to the middle phase of the protohistoric graveyards of the Sw?t Valley. Graves and settlements reflect the same construction techniques of the earlier (75) On the cultural periods in the proto historical graveyards of the Swat Valley, see Stacul 1966a, pp. 63-66. (76) On the settlements of the protohistorical age localized in the Sw?t Valley, a report is being prepared by the present writer. (77) See Stacul 1967b, p. 232. We think that graves nos. 102, 140, 142, 149, 192 and 197 of the Timargarha graveyard can be referred to the period under examination here (see Dani 1968, pp. 134-137). The furnishings of grave no. 101 can also be referred to that period (see Dani 1968, p. 132); it contained two burials deposited suc? cessively; Radiocarbon analysis carried out by Hei? delberg University on the two skeletons gave the respective ages of 3380 ? 60 years and 2805 ? 60 years (see Dani 1968, p. 37). (78) See Stacul 1967b, p. 232, note 36. (7*) The correlations with some types of gray vases with button bases common to the Iron Age I Period of W. Iran (above all from Khorvin and Giyan I) seem particularly significative, because they involve not only the shapes, but also the decorative elements (cordons, groovings). Cf. Stacul 1966a, figs. 39, 70f, with Cuyler Young 1965, fig. 9, no. 4; and with Contenau 1935, gr. 37/1, 57/5; cf. Stacul 1966a, fig. 70e, with Cuyler Young 1965, fig. 9, no. 2; cf. also Dani 1968, fig. 27, gr. 150, with Cuyler Young 1965, fig. 8, no. 10 and with Contenau 1935, gr. 63/2 (the same type is also very common in Sw?t). 84</page><page sequence="60">period. We see in the funeral rite, however, a marked prevalence of inhumations over cremations. As for the pottery, the most important type is a very fine, wheel-turned gray production, with a great variety of shapes, often highly elaborate. Only a few of them show an evolution in respect to types present in Sw?t in the preceding period. Chalices and cups on pedestals are the most recurrent types in graves of this period. The body of the vases often shows geometrical motifs incised before baking. The metal handicrafts still consist only of copper objects. Significative comparisons can be made with some types of gray ware common to the phase of Hasanlu IV or ol the Iron Age II Period in W. Iran (ca. 1000 800 B.C.) (80). For this phase, Radiocarbon tests gave some dates included between the 6th and 5th cent. B.C. Period VII This period corresponds to the late phase of the ^protohistorical graveyards of the Swat Valley. The rite of inhumation clearly prevails in the graves. The pottery is mainly charac? terized by a red production, usually very fine and always wheel-turned, frequently incised. Metal objects are in copper and iron. In various tombs the iron weapons make up the main elements in the furnishings. Anthropomorphic figurines of terracotta with flat, geo? metrical bodies are also common. There are correlations in the northwestern area of the sub-continent with graves in the Valleys of Dir (81), Buner (82) and Chitral (83). Other signi? ficative comparisons can be made with pottery related to the phase of Hasanlu III A in W. Iran (ca. 500-400 B.C. (M). * * * What mainly draws our attention in the preceding series of successions, is the fact that among the various cultural horizons that distinguish Protohistory in the Sw?t Valley, one rarely comes across continuity in development, a progressive and gradual change. Each of them reflects instead an autonomous and self-sufficient growth, a renewal that is almost complete and involves the typological picture of the handicrafts, as can be seen from a com? parison of the pastes, shapes and production techniques of the pottery (fig. 18). Such a differen? tiation between the distinctive elements of each period takes on special meaning when one (80) Cf. Silvi Antonini 1963, fig. 8, with Negahban 1965, fig. 9; cf. also Stacul 1966a, fig. 47, with Vanden Berghe 1959, pi. 155d-e, and with Ghirshman 1939, pi. XX, 9. It is noteworthy that, in the Iron Age II Period of W. Iran and in Sw?t Period VI, the vases with button and disk bases lessen or disappear completely, while we can observe generally the appearing of the thin fine variety of gray ware (on W. Iran see Cuyler Young 1965, p. 57). (81) See Dani 1968, pp. 125 (grave no. 2b), 127, 128 (grave no. 122), 129 (grave no. 119). (82) See Stacul 1967b, pp. 231-232. (83) See the writer's article on p. 92 of this same issue. (84) Cf. Stacul 1966, fig. 73a-c; Dani 1968, fig. 32, no. 3, with Dyson 1965, fig. 13 (the first to the bottom left). In the phase of Hasanlu III in W. Iran, and in Period VII of the Sw?t Valley, the gray ware disappears or becomes very scarce. 85</page><page sequence="61">goes from a relatively evolved cultural phase, such as that of Period II, to another that marks a total impoverishment of the technical repertory, as shown in Period III. At this time, we are unable to define just how much such clear differences between period and period depend on the fragmentary nature of our data (still inadequate for clari? fying intermediate phases of development), and how much is the result of sudden changes and upheavals due to the instability of the dominant tribal groups. We are certain, though, that in no other region of the Indo-Pakistan sub-continent has there been registered such a highly differentiated succession of cultural horizons, ranging over an interval of about two millennia. This should not come as too great a surprise, if one thinks of Swat's particular posi? tion in the geography of Asia. Located near the main passes that link the sub-continent with Central Asia, placed as well near the important traffic routes between East and West, it has been exceptionally exposed to the influence of currents from various sources, and to repeated cultural influxes. One should also take into account the climatic and environ? mental conditions of the Valley, probably very favourable in the past, as testified to by the historical sources ever since the Buddhist era (85). A more detailed examination clarifies the fact that the unstable situation mentioned above seems to be particularly accentuated in the period after the decline of the Harapp? culture in the Indus Valley and the surrounding plains. This is shown, in fact, by the relatively short interval that separates the end of the second from the start of the fifth cultural Period. We may suppose that in this interval of time there probably took place profound social upheavals in the northwester a regions of the sub-continent. It is also likely that the origin of at least part of such upheavals may be referred to subversive movements of Central Asian peoples, as it is also borne witness to, in a more or less contem? porary epoch, by the destruction levels in various stations of Afghanistan, northern Iran and Soviet Turkmenistan. There are also signs that lead us to think that the very marked diffe? rentiation between some periods depends for the most part on the different social and economic extraction of the human groups that were able to dominate the Valley at various times: on the one hand, the farmers and livestock men, more or less directly involved in the cultural phases that dominated in the southern plains; on the other, tribal groups with a pastoral economic background, with nomadic traditions of a life conditioned by seasonal migrations, who would have formed a basic cultural unit in the area of the mountainous regions situated on the two opposite flanks of the great chains of the Karakorum, Pamirs and Hindukush. Further, we deem very significant the typological correlations to be observed between pottery of Sw?t and Dir on the one hand and of Western Iran on the other, in a span of time from about 1300 to 400 B.C. Thus Jettmar's hypothesis on the cultural connections between Caucasus and the mountain regions extending from Hindukush to Karakorum (86), (85) Chavannes 1903, pp. 407 ft. (86) Jettmar 1961. 86</page><page sequence="62">assumes ever greater importance. These connections took place probably following several routes, both through the steppe area and the north-Iranian mountain-ridges. The penetration ways were presumably the same as those which previously (likely about the middle of the 2nd millennium B.C.) had brought to the north-west regions of the Indo-Pakistan sub-con? tinent the black-gray burnished ware, distinctive of Tepe Hiss?r IIB-IIIC, in association with other elements of probable northern derivation. At the moment, the complexity of these phases and the generally scarce archaeolog? ical documentation hinder even a summary reconstruction of these events, which should presumably be linked to the spread of the Aryan tribes in the regions of the Indo? Pakistan sub-continent. Nevertheless, recent excavations have shown that Sw?t, perhaps more than any other region of the sub-continent, may be able to supply us with precious information about this period. In fact, if the phases documented now only by fragmen? tary finds, eventually obtain ? and this is partly taking place right now ? more ample documentation, it is probably this region that will offer a highly valuable contribution to protohistorical Indo-Pakistan archaeology (87).
