<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Osiris Nefertari: A Case Study of Decorum, Gender, and Regeneration1 Heather Lee McCarthy The funerary art and literature of the ancient Egyptians clearly demonstrate that they envisioned an afterlife existence that emulated two parallel, but interpenetrating, mythic paradigms- the "solar" and "Osirian" modes of regeneration. These two modes have temporal aspects that correspond with, respectively, nhh (cyclical, repetitive) eternity and^ (linear, static) eternity.2 Like the solar deity, the deceased was cyclically reborn and renewed- a process that the Egyptians equated with the sun's celestial journey through the daytime sky and the darkness of the netherworld. The climax of this process was the re-emergence of the sun and the souls of the deceased from the netherworld into the world of the living every morning.3 The cyclical journey that characterized the solar mode of regeneration also had a parallel sexual component wherein the sun god was reborn via intercourse with a goddess who had a tripartite, mul- tigenerational aspect.4 This goddess was the solar deity's daughter.5 She also acted as his consort and was impregnated by him in the west at sunset. The goddess then became his mother when she gave birth to the renewed and regenerated version of the same solar deity in the east at dawn.6 This notion was expressed pictorially and textually in both anthropomorphic and topographical terms- the sun disk enters, gestates and leaves the body of the sky goddess or enters the western horizon and re-emerges from the eastern horizon7 (the cosmographic correlate of the goddess's vagina). The deceased was also associated with Osiris, the god of the Duat (the netherworld). Like Osiris, one aspect of the deceased- the physical body- dwelled in the Duat (correlated to the burial chamber 1 This article is an expanded version of a paper presented at the 2001 Annual Meeting of the American Research Center in Egypt, held in Providence, Rhode Island.

Robins notes that Kamutef, the aspect of the king as the "bull of his mother," is a manifestation of this mythic paradigm. 7 The anthropomorphic aspect of this notion is expressed by illustrations from the Book of the Day and the Book of the Night, which appear on ceilings of Ramesside royal tombs and depict the sun traveling through and emerging from the body of the sky-goddess. The best-known example of this theme is on the painted sarcophagus chamber ceiling of Ramesses VI.

The Pyramid Texts provide unequivocal written evidence that, at least as far back as the Fifth Dy- nasty, deceased pharaohs were automatically equated with both the sun god11 and Osiris12 by virtue of their kingly status and were believed to experience the corresponding modes of regeneration and renewal. 13 The Pyramid Texts of Neith14 and Wedjebten, 15 wives of Pepy II, verify that deceased royal women were also associated with the solar deity and Osiris and had the epithet "Osiris" prefixed to their names from as far back as the late Sixth Dynasty.16 David O'Connor's17 analyses of the programs of two late Old Kingdom elite tombs and Janice Kam- rin's18 study of a Middle Kingdom elite tomb persuasively demonstrate that the afterlife existence of non-royal male Egyptians was determined by the same mythic paradigms that structure the afterlife existence of kings. Non-royal men and non-royal women are explicitly associated with Osiris and given the epithet "Osiris" from the Heracleopolitan Period onward.19 In addition, female family members (mothers, wives, and daughters) depicted in the tomb programs of elite men could be en- visioned playing the same sexual, multigenerational role for the deceased male Egyptian that the tripartite goddess played for the solar deity.20 Less straightforward, however, is the process by which women (either royal or elite) were regen- erated. Although deceased women were explicitly associated with Osiris and the solar deity from the Old Kingdom onwards, 21 it has never been entirely clear whether the afterlife existence of women 8 James P.

This mode coexists with Osirian and solar modes of regeneration in the Pyramid Texts. However, the change from the north- south orientation of Djoser's mortuary complex to the east-west orientation of the pyramids from the beginning of the Fourth Dynasty onwards, suggests that the association with the northern circumpolar stars becomes subordinate to the solar mode.

A deceased woman could be identified with Osiris and the solar deity, and while she might be represented in her husband's or her father's tomb playing the role of the tripartite goddess for her deceased male relatives, it is not clear whether she needed a tripartite goddess figure to make her rebirth and re- generation possible. If a deceased woman needed such assistance, who played the role of the tripar- tite goddess? A phenomenon recently discussed by Ann Macy Roth22 may provide a clue to understanding this process. Roth has observed that, with some exceptions,23 the tomb chapels owned by royal24 and non-royal women- or the cult places reserved for women in jointly owned tombs- omitted the figure (and sometimes the name25) of the husband. In her examination of this pattern, Roth refers, at one point, to the conspicuous absence of Ramesses II from the tomb of Nefertari26 (in fact, the Rames- side royal women's tombs in the Valley of the Queens, as a rule, completely omit the names or images of their royal male kin,27even though queens, like kings, could be depicted in the tombs of royal sons28). While Roth does not suggest an explanation for this particular omission, she makes a keen obser- vation, namely, that in stark contrast to the exclusion of Ramesses II from his wife's tomb, New King- dom pharaohs are frequently depicted in the tombs of their sons.29 She argues that the "absent husband" phenomenon in this case was not directed by a proscription against depicting higher status individuals within the tombs of lower-status deceased family members.30 The logical inference of Roth's statement is that relative status alone did not determine whether a king was portrayed in the tombs of his relatives. For if status alone were the determinant, then one would not expect to see rep- resentations of the king (or queens, for that matter) in the princes' tombs, either. The purpose of the present article is to offer a possible solution to the question of how royal women were regenerated by using the Theban tomb (QV 66) of Nefertari, the most prominent of the 22 Ann Macy Roth, "The Absent Spouse: Patterns and Taboos in Egyptian Tomb Decoration," JARCE 36 (1999), 37-53. 23 In the late Third or early Fourth Dynasty tomb of Atet at Meydum, the figure of her husband, Nefermaat, is shown trapping birds. The figure of Nebhepetre Mentuhotep appears in the late Eleventh Dynasty tombs of Queen Neferu and in the chapels of the six royal women buried in Mentuhotep's mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahari. See Roth, "Absent Spouse," 45, 48-49. 24 Royal women of the Old through Middle Kingdoms tend to be buried in close proximity to (or within) the pyramid en- closure of the king, even when they have separate tombs and pyramids. It is not until the beginning of the Nineteenth Dynasty that royal women have both a separate necropolis- the Valley of the Queens in western Thebes- and large, very elaborately decorated tombs of their own. This practice seems to be exclusive to the Ramesside Period. Hatshepsut and Tawosret, royal women of the Eighteenth and late Nineteenth Dynasty, respectively, should be regarded as special cases because they each assumed the role and titles of a pharaoh and were given kings' burials in the Valley of the Kings. 25 Roth, "Absent Spouse," 47. A section of the early Sixth Dynasty tomb of the vizier Mereruka at Saqqara is devoted entirely to his wife, Watetkhethor, a king's daughter, and neither Mereruka's name nor his image appears there. The name, but not the image, of Pepi II appears in the tombs of his wives. Zb Roth, "Absent Spouse," 49; see also Colin Campbell, Two Theban Queens: Nefert-ari and Ty-ti and Their Tombs (London, 1909), 7, 12. Campbell notes the absence of Ramesses II (in both text and image) from Nefertari 's tomb, but he offers no analysis. 27 Hornung acknowledges this pattern in Valley of the Kings, p. 187. The single exception to this rule is found in the twenti- eth Dynasty tomb of Queen Isis (QV 51). Isis's son, Ramesses VI, completed his mother's tomb and inscribed his cartouches on the jambs of the doorway leading from the antechamber to the sarcophagus chamber. 28 See Christian Leblanc, Ta Set Neferou: line Necropole de Thebes-Ouest et Son Histoire (Cairo, 1989), pl. 85, for a scene showing a royal woman offering to Osiris in the Twentieth Dynasty tomb of Prince Pareherwenemef (QV 42). ^ Roth, "Absent Spouse," 49. The examples Roth cites are the Twentieth Dynasty tombs of the sons of Ramesses III in the Valley of the Queens. Her observation is still applicable to the period discussed here, because images and cartouches of Ramesses II are prominently displayed in the decorative program of KV 5, the "family mausoleum" which served as the burial place for a number of this king's sons. In many scenes, the king mediates between his sons and the gods just as Ramesses III does in the tombs of his sons. See Edwin C. Brock, "Wall Decoration," in Kent Weeks, ed., KV 5: A Preliminary Report on the Excavation of the Tomb of the Sons ofRameses II in the Valley of the Kings (Cairo, 2000), 55-94, especially figs. 45-49, 56, 60, 61a-c, 62, 69b. 30 Roth, "Absent Spouse," 49.</page><page sequence="4">176 JARCE XXXIX (2002) great royal wives of Ramesses II, as a case study. I will address Roth's observation, which usefully ac- knowledges the complexity of the "absent spouse" pattern, but will also take this idea further and define the multiple factors- including hierarchical decorum31- that seem to have shaped the notion of how Nefertari embarked upon her afterlife existence and how this phenomenon was expressed in visual terms. The main thesis of this study is that Nefertari's postmortem regeneration required her to attain a temporary state of gender fluidity in which she becomes both male and female.32 The attainment of this state necessitated the absence of Ramesses II from her tomb. Once the queen adopted a mascu- line aspect and achieved a state of gender fluidity, she could then assimilate with both Osiris and the solar deity. This would allow her to assume the chthonic fertility of Osiris and to be reborn via what is essentially a sexual mode of regeneration (like the solar deity)- possibly interacting with her own feminine aspect in the process. Furthermore, this article will demonstrate how the mechanism of the queen's rebirth and regener- ation-effected through her assumption of masculine regenerative potential and her assimilation with both Osiris and the solar deity- is conveyed by the art in her tomb. An attempt will be made to show how Egyptian notions of male and female fertility, hierarchical decorum, and the ideological role of royal women within the conceptual framework of kingship33 propelled specific choices made in the design and content of the decorative program, among which is the aforementioned omission of Ramesses II. To this end, the decorative program of the Small Temple at Abu Simbel,34 where Nefertari and a local, Nubian form of the goddess Hathor were the foci of cult, will be studied and used as a com- parandum. The decorative program of the Small Temple provides an instructive demonstration of the rules of hierarchical decorum that govern depictions of the royal couple's dyadic relationship. The ra- tionale for comparing this temple with Nefertari's tomb is that both of these monuments have excep- tionally well-preserved programs and are dedicated to the same royal woman. They thus provide an unusually rich source of data about modes of representation deemed appropriate for the portrayal of a queen in both temple/cultic and funerary /cul tic contexts. Moreover, the rules of subordination and super ordination employed in the representations of the royal couple in the Small Temple help explain both the omission of Ramesses II from the tomb of Nefertari and the larger process of the queen's regeneration. Among the works cited in this discussion are Roth's two recent, thought-provoking articles, "The Absent Spouse: Patterns and Taboos in Ancient Egyptian Tomb Decoration," and "Father Earth, Mother Sky: Ancient Egyptian Beliefs about Conception and Fertility."35 The former deals with the previously mentioned "absent spouse" pattern in tomb decoration, and the latter examines the Egyp- tian conception of fertility and the role of ancient Egyptian women in death and rebirth. Lana Troy's book Patterns of Queenship in Ancient Egyptian Myth and History, is an important work demonstrating that ancient Egyptian queenship can be envisioned as the feminine half of the androgynous totality 31 For a discussion of the notion of gender-related compositional dominance and it canonical employment in Egyptian art see Gay Robins, "Some Principles of Compositional Dominance and Gender Hierarchy in Egyptian Art," in JARCE 31 (1994), 33-40. 32 Roth first proposed the hypothesis that deceased women assumed a masculine postmortem identity in addition to their feminine identity, developed an association with Osiris, and re-engendered themselves with the help of their own tomb images in "Father Earth, Mother Sky," 199-200. 33 Troy, Patterns of Queenship. The ideological roles of royal women vis-a-vis kingship and within the overarching cosmologi- cal frame of reference are two important concepts examined in this innovative and original study of royal women in ancient Egypt. 34 A comprehensive publication of the decorative program and architecture of this temple is provided by Christine Desro- ches-Noblecourt and Charles Kuentz, Le Petit Temple d'Abou Simbel, volumes 1,2 (Cairo, 1968). 35 Roth, "Father Earth, Mother Sky," 187-201.</page><page sequence="5">THE OSIRIS NEFERTARI 177 of kingship. Another work cited here, Gay Robins' 1994 JARCE article, "Some Principles of Compo- sitional Dominance and Gender Hierarchy in Egyptian Art," explores the relationship of gender to patterns of hierarchical decorum in two and three-dimensional art. The first part of this article will describe the tomb of Nefertari and discuss its program, its func- tions, and its cosmographic significance. The second section will examine the decorative program of the Small Temple of Abu Simbel in order to demonstrate how the rules governing the representations of Ramesses II and Nefertari in this temple help explain the absence of the king from Nefertari's tomb. The final section will discuss how the art in QV 66 provides important clues to understanding the mechanism of the queen's regeneration. The Tomb of Nefertari36 An examination of the cosmography of the architecture and decorative program of QV 66 illus- trates the tomb's two primary purposes: 1) to enable the deceased queen to enter the netherworld and 2) to revitalize her and thus allow her to emerge from the tomb and return to the world of the living on a daily basis.37 These two functions, which are analogous to the two phases of the sun's jour- ney through the netherworld and the daytime sky, are conveyed by the architecture and decoration of the tomb. Moreover, the tomb consists of two distinct components.38 The first is an upper level that, in the cosmography of the tomb, is conceptually equivalent to the Akhet and its immediate envi- rons, a liminal zone that the deceased and the solar deity traversed in order to enter and exit the netherworld.39 The second part is a lower-lying burial chamber that is the cosmographic equivalent of the Dual (the netherworld realm of Osiris and the dead). A descending corridor, acting as a con- ceptual and physical link between the two realms, connects both sections of the tomb. Located on the northern flank of the Y-shaped "Valley of the Queens" in western Thebes, the tomb of Nefertari (figs. 1,2) lies on an approximate north-south axis with its entrance in the south. From the doorway, a descending staircase leads to the square first room- Chamber C.40 On the eastern side of Chamber C, a doorway leads to a complex comprised of two shallow recesses (D and E on this plan), a short passageway (F), and a rectangular chamber (G). A doorway in the north (rear) wall of Chamber C, gives access to a steeply downward-sloping corridor, which lies on a diagonal, east-leaning, axis,41 and descends to the burial chamber (K). Four piers support the burial chamber, and a rectangular depression (oriented east-west) in the center of the room intended for the placement of the queen's 36 Published by Hans Goedicke and Gertrud Thausing in Nofretari: Documentation of Her Tomb and Its Decoration (Graz, 1971). 37 Christian Leblanc, "Architecture et Evolution Chronologique des Tombes de la Vallee des Reines," BIFAO 89 (1989), 227- 47, especially pp. 245-47. 38 Heike C.

(Mainz, 1994), 104-44; idem, "Szenarium der Transfiguration- Kulisse des Mythos: Das Grab der Nefertari," SAK 22 (1995), 237-70. Schmidt offers an interpretive discussion of Nefertari's tomb that suggests the juxtaposition of solar and chthonic modes of regeneration. She envisions the areas on the (relative) north-south axis that run in a relatively straight line from Chamber C, through the corridor, and into the burial chamber, as a thematically chthonic area, whereas the east-west axis (referred to as D-G in the present article) is more solar in its orientation. Her interpretation differs from mine, because I envision a greater conceptual integration between the spaces rather than drawing a sharp distinction be- tween the "solar complex" of the east-west axis and the more chthonic, "Osirian" axis of the north-south spaces. In addition, I envision Chamber C as an area that evokes the Akhet, and she does not; Goedicke notes only that there is a thematic distinc- tion between the more "earth-connected" upper chambers and the "strictly sepulchral sphere" of the sarcophagus chamber (with the descending corridor acting as the midpoint) in, Nofretari, 36 39 For Allen's definition of the Akhet see, Reading a Pyramid, 26. 40 All letter designations used in this article to distinguish spatial units in QV 66 follow those employed in John K. Mc- Donald, House of Eternity: The Tomb of Nefertari (Los Angeles, 1996). Hornung believes that the slightly bent axis of QV 66's corridor is a "diminished" version of the bent-axis royal tomb plan revived by Ramesses II for his own tomb.

Chamber C is the conceptual and temporal correlate of the Akhet in this phase of the deceased queen's journey- a cosmographically appropriate designation for a chamber that communicates with the entrance doorway and the world of the living. The most powerful evidence support- ing this interpretation is the decoration on the soffit of the entrance doorway (fig. 3), which depicts the sun, flanked by Isis and Nephthys in kite form, rising (or set- ting) in the midst of the mountains of the horizon as though it were emerging from (or entering) the tomb.42 In addition to graphically depicting the process of the sun's (and by association, the deceased's) emergence from the netherworld, it literally spells out the word "Akhet" Moreover, the position of this scene on the tomb's en- trance doorway identifies Chamber C as the area hidden (from humans) behind the "mountain" or physical hori- zon, the hidden space that is the Akhet. Furthermore, the west wall of Chamber C is decorated with the text of Book of the Dead chap-ter 1 7 and accompa- nying vignettes, which depict Nefertari undergoing trans- formations that will allow her to emerge from her tomb "as a living soul"43 and thus re-enter the terrestrial zone outside of the tomb.44 A representation of Nefertari as a human-headed ba-hird (fig. 4) perched atop the tomb (one of the transformations described in the text) graphically highlights this notion. The &amp;a-spirit, as described in New Kingdom funerary texts, is the mobile aspect of the de- ceased that can leave the tomb during the day and mingle with the living or travel with the solar deity.45 This tableau places the action within the Akhet (and its placement on this wall further reinforces the equation of Chamber C with the Akhet). It graphically highlights the idea that Nefertari is experiencing the mysteries of regeneration within the Akhet behind the mountains of the horizon as the sun god does. The east wall of Chamber C is decorated with representations of Osiris-Wennenefer and Anubis standing in shrines and facing south, toward the tomb entrance, where Nefertari, standing adjacent 42 The notion that this tableau represents both the rising and setting of the sun and the inward and outward movement of the deceased is supported by Leblanc, "Architecture et Evolution," 245 and 246, fig. 7; Goedicke interprets this scene as a de- piction of the setting sun in Nofretari, 38, as does McDonald in House of Eternity, 57. 43 See the translation of Chapter 17 (especially the beginning, which is particularly relevant to the physical transformation of Nefertari) in R.O. Faulkner, The Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead (London, 1989), 44. 44 Leblanc endorses the notion that the upper chamber is an area of entry, transfiguration, and re-emergence in Archi- tecture et Evolution," 244 and 246, fig. 7. Another point of view is held by Goedicke, who envisions the decorative pro- gram in the first chamber as a one-way entry of the deceased into the realm of Osiris. Goedicke discusses the "inaugural" character of the outer chamber in Nofretari, 35, but does not address the notion of the "re-emergence" or exit of the trans- formed deceased. 45 See John H.

The complex (Recesses D, E, Corridor F, and Chamber G) that opens up from the east wall of Chamber C (fig. 5) has a decorative program that relates thematically to the intersection of the solar and Osirian modes of regeneration and stresses Nefertari's interaction with these two modes. More- over, the program of this complex suggests that this series of spaces is the cosmographic correlate of a zone in the netherworld that lies somewhere between the Akhet and the Duat. Its placement in the upper level of the tomb spatially links it to the Akhet-evoking area of Chamber C. Like the topography of the netherworld, the architecture of the tomb and, by association, the route taken by the deceased (in both directions) is not a straight line.47 In essence, the eastern complex can be envisioned as the cosmographic representation of a transitional area between the two realms, but one that seems more closely linked to the Akhet than to the depths of the Duat. The scenes and inscriptions of the eastern complex also suggest a movement toward the Duat and away from the Akhet as one moves further into the complex from Chamber C. The program of Recess D, for example, reinforces the cosmographic equivalence of the upper level of the tomb with the Akhet- the place where Nefertari will emerge like the sun from the Duat. It depicts Selket on the north wall and Neith on the south wall, flanking the passage from Chamber C to the eastern complex. The associated texts indicate that each goddess welcomes Nefertari and have accorded her a place in the sacred land so that she may appear each day like Re- a reference to the solar mode of regeneration and to Nefertari's emergence from the Akhet. The program of Recess E (directly behind- and to the east- of D) highlights the interpenetration of the solar and Osirian modes of regeneration. This is accomplished by depicting Isis (on the north wall) and Horus, Son-of-Isis (on the south wall), representatives of the Osirian mythos, leading Nefer- tari into the presence of Khepri and Re-Horakhty (the latter seated with Hathor of Thebes), two aspects of the solar deity who rise in the east and emerge from the netherworld.

The lateral walls of Corridor F (the narrow passage between Recess E and Chamber G) are each decorated with standing, west-facing figures of Ma'at, who welcomes Nefertari and assures her a place within Iu-geret.48 This recess can be equated with the judgment of the deceased in chapter 125 of the Book of the Dead;49 an analogy that suggests this corridor represents a further point in the journey between the Akhet and the Duat.50 Indeed, there appears to be a conceptual transition between spaces (E and G) where the synthe- sis of the solar and Osirian modes is expressed in increasingly unequivocal terms, as Chamber G explicitly depicts the intertwining of the solar and Osirian modes of regeneration that Nefertari 46 Schmidt believes that this vignette is the illustration of Book of the Dead chapter 173 in "Das Grab der Nefertari," 241-42. 47 For a discussion of the non-linear topography of the netherworld and its expression in Old Kingdom Pyramid archi- tecture, see Allen, "Reading a Pyramid," 24-28; idem, "The Cosmology of the Pyramid Texts," in Yale Egyptological Studies 3 (New Haven, 1989), 1-28, especially his discussion of the location of the Field of Reeds, Field of Offerings, and the Akhet on pp. 6, 17-18. 48 Goedicke and Thausing, Nofretari, 42-43. 49 McDonald, House of Eternity, 75; Schmidt, "Das Grab der Nefertari," 245; see Leblanc, Ta Set Neferou, pl. 147 (B) for a rep- resentaion of the "negative confessions" portion of chapter 125 in the antechamber of the tomb (QV 60) of Nebettawy, Ramesses II's daughter by Nefertari or Isisnofret.

While this supports the notion that the recess is a zone of transition, I would suggest that the eastern complex might have been significant for the deceased's inward and outward movement through the tomb.</page><page sequence="9">THE OSIRIS NEFERTARI 181 Fig. 4.

Syncretic form of Re-Osiris from the south half of the east wall of Chamber G (photograph © the J. Paul Getty Trust, [1992]) would hope to undergo in her personal postmor- tem transformation. The program of Chamber G also includes scenes and texts from the Book of the Dead that have a direct bearing on Nefertari's physical journey through the afterlife. The west wall of Chamber G (on the south side of the door) is perhaps the most telling example of the intensi- fication of the program's message. The vignette here depicts the syncretistic, mummiform figure of Re-Osiris flanked by Isis and Nephthys (fig. 6)- an illustration of chapter 180 from the Book of the Dead51 in which the interaction of Re and Osiris "recharges" the process of regeneration and em- powers the deceased to move both into and out of the realm of the dead.52 Versions of the Re-Osiris scene are included in the tombs of two other Ramesside queens: Nebet- tawy (QV 60), a daughter of Ramesses II, and Duatentipet (QV 74). 53 In both of these tombs, this scene appears in a space that architecturally corresponds to QV 66's Chamber G (i.e., in an eastern lateral chamber that opens up from the east wall of each tomb's antechamber, but in each case without QV 66's associated recesses). The scenes on the south wall of the chamber il- lustrate chapter 148, a spell that provides both nourishment for the deceased and the magical steering oars that will guide her on her journey and protect her from her enemies. The north wall de- picts chapter 94, in which the deceased requests writing equipment from Thoth that will endow her with the scribal proficiency she needs to success- fully complete her journey. The adjacent scene on the north half of the west wall (on the north side of the door) depicts the queen offering bolts linen to Ptah while he, in turn, provides her with protection, life, and stability. The rear (east) wall shows two back-to-back scenes of the deceased offering to Osiris-Wennenefer, the resurrected Osiris, and to Atum, the solar/creator deity of Heliopolis (fig. 7). The pairing of the gods, like the representation of Re-Osiris on the west wall, is a graphic visual statement of the coex- istence and interaction of the two complementary modes of regeneration.

The lower half of the corridor, unlike the upper half, lies beneath the floor level of the upper cham- bers. The "underground" location of the lower half of the corridor thus intensifies the decorative program's equation of the lower half of the corri- dor with theDm^.56 The thicknesses of the upper doorway are deco- rated with the queen's cartouches and symbols of Upper and Lower Egypt57- direct evocations of the terrestrial (i.e., Egyptian) realm. The side walls of the upper part of the corridor are decorated with two pendant offering scenes in which Nefertari consecrates nemset-jars, produce, and bread to two en- throned goddesses- Hathor and Selket on the east and Isis and Nephthys on the west (a figure of Ma' at kneels behind the second goddess in each group). Two recesses that separate the upper and lower zones of the corridor are decorated with anthropomorphized Djed-pillars that appear to sup- port the ceiling. Both lateral walls of the lower section of the corridor are decorated with scenes that more directly evoke the netherworld than do the scenes on the upper part. On each side, the Anubis-jackal sits on a shrine, with a winged cobra protecting the cartouche of Nefertari above, while Isis (on the west side) and Nephthys (on the east side) kneel on a hieroglyphic sign for gold, and hold a shen sign.58 The associated inscriptions, though not chapters from the Book of the Dead, relate to the queen's after- life existence. They express the wish that Nefertari have a place in the "sacred land" [7? dsr], appear in heaven like Re, and rest on the throne of Osiris59- once again reflecting the interpenetration of Osirian and solar modes of regeneration. Even the queen's epithets, inscribed on the two doorways of the corridor, suggest Nefertari's physi- cal movement to (and from) the netherworld and her transformation through this transitional zone 54 Goedicke, Nofretari, pl. 39. 55 Goedicke and Thausing, Nofretari, 45.

On the east half of the north (rear) wall, Nefertari offers to three funerary deities- Osiris, Hathor of the West, and Anubis. The rear and lateral chambers also evoke the netherworld- with references to sacred places in real geographical locations.65 The western lateral chamber (M) depicts a mummiform Nefertari (fig. 11), the tomb of Osiris at Abydos, and funer- ary deities.66 One of the gods gives Nefertari "the kingship of Atum."67 The eastern lateral cham- ber68 (O) is decorated with a large figure of Ma'at (on the east wall), Nefertari adoring the Hathor cow as she emerges from the west69 (north wall), and the queen adoring Isis and Anubis (south wall).70 A figure of Ma'at states that Nefertari has a place in the temple of Amun at Karnak.71 The decoration of the rear chamber (Q) is fragmentary and consists of a figure of Isis, a goddess protect- ing Nefertari's cartouche, and a figure of Selket.72 C. Leblanc identifies the burial chamber as the room in which the deceased Nefertari would lie inert like Osiris in the Duat before her rebirth and re-emergence.73 One might take this notion a step further and suggest that the central area of the burial chamber- the depression in which the sarcophagus was placed- can be envisioned as the very heart of the netherworld, where Osiris (and, by association, Nefertari in her sarcophagus) is revitalized.74 The identification of the deceased queen with Osiris is suggested by the decoration of 64 Faulkner, Book of the Dead, 133-37. 65 Schmidt envisions the lateral chambers as evocations of "mythical" locations, the west lateral chamber represents the tomb of Osiris in Abydos, in "Das Grab der Nefertari," 254-56. 66 Goedicke and Thausing, Nofretari, 53-54. 67 Goedicke and Thausing, Nofretari, 53. 68 Schmidt identifies this lateral chamber as the "mythic" Chemmis in, "Der Grab das Nefertari," 256-59.

The Small Temple The decorative program of the Small Temple of Abu Simbel exhibits significant differences from that of the tomb- differences that highlight why the decorative program of Nefertari's tomb has the form that it does. An examination of the Small Temple of Abu Simbel reveals two concepts- embedded in the rules of decorum governing the portrayal of the royal couple- that help explain the necessity of omitting the king from the decorative program of the tomb. These rules are: (1) the ideology of kingship clearly defines an unambiguously feminine role for Nefertari when she is paired with the king; and (2) the rules of social hierarchy con- sistently place the queen in a subordinate position in relationship to the king. In her book on queenship, Troy discusses and defines the role of royal women within the ideologi- cal framework of kingship. Troy argues that kingship can be envisioned as a male-female composite on earth that corresponds to the androgynous form of the creator in the divine realm.77 Further, she demonstrates that kingship necessarily provides the conceptual frame of reference for queenship, and queenship is thus the feminine half of the androgynous totality of kingship.78 Troy's notion can be applied to the interpretation of the Small Temple's program. Here, Nefertari is shown as an unambiguously feminine counterpart to the king- one whose place on the hierarchical scale is lower than that of the king- but who is, nevertheless, envisioned as his ideologically crucial feminine complement. The separate coronation scenes79 for Ramesses II and Nefertari attest to the complementary relationship of the masculine and feminine elements of kingship. 75 Hornung, Valley of the Kings, 187. Hornung interprets the djed pillar images adoring columns in the burial chamber of Ramesses II's tomb as iconic representations of the deceased assimilated with Osiris, and he believes that rf/^d-pillars decorat- ing the piers in Nefertari's burial chamber serve the queen in the same way.

Drawing of doorway lintel from the Small Temple with Nefertari's cartouche (after Desroches-Noblecourt and Kuentz, Le Petit Temple, vol. 2, pl. 116) An analysis of the Small Temple's decorative program reveals that, in total, there are fifty-one pic- torial scenes from the entrance corridor to the sanctuary. In all of these scenes, rigid rules of super ordination and subordination govern the relationship of the king and queen. To wit, whenever the king is shown in a scene with Nefertari, the king is always depicted in front of the queen (fig. 12). This rule also applies to the arrangement of the names and epithets of Ramesses II and Nefertari. When the king's cartouche appears along with that of Nefertari, his name appears in the dominant first (or uppermost) position.80 An example of this comes from the lintel of one of the doorways leading from the columned hall into the vestibule (fig. 13). Here, the horizontal register inscribed with the cartou- che of Ramesses II is placed above that containing the cartouche of Nefertari.81 There are, however, parts of the temple that are reserved for Nefertari alone. In these instances, the issues of super ordination and subordination do not come into play.82 For example, some of the temple doorway lintels omit the king's name and are inscribed with only Nefertari's cartouche (fig. 14) 83- just as some of the SCenes depict Nefertari without her husband- but these are the only occa- sions in which Nefertari's name is not in a subordinate position. 8(1 See Robins, "Compositional Dominance," 33, 36-37 for her discussion of the superior first position of the male in two- dimensional art- her "second rule" of compositional hierarchy. 81 Desroches-Noblecourt and Kuentz, Le Petit Temple, vol. 2, pls. 93-96. 82 Robins, "Compositional Dominance," 36-38. 8-9&gt; See Desroches-Noblecourt and Kuentz, Le Petit Temple, vol. 2, pls. 115-118.</page><page sequence="18">190 JARCE XXXIX (2002) Fig. 15. Facade of the Small Temple of Nefertari and Hathor of Ibshek at Abu Simbel (photo by author) In some cases, the pattern of compositional dominance in this temple's program dictates that the king's cartouches are not only in a superior position to those of Nefertari, but also outnumber them. This occurs on the architraves and soffits of the ceiling of the columned hall, in which the king's cartouches outnumber the queen's by a 3 to 1 ratio.84 The arrangement of colossal statues on the facade (fig. 15) is a three-dimensional correlate of this pattern. Although the king and queen are of equal size, there are twice as many figures of the king, i.e., a 2 to 1 ratio. Funerary Context: Rebirth and Regeneration In sharp contrast to her role in the Small Temple, Nefertari is represented in her tomb as a being with a capacity for masculine regenerative potential. A woman's postmortem assumption of mascu- line sexual potential would have been deemed important for two key reasons: (1) The assimilation of the deceased with both Osiris and the solar deity was necessary for regeneration, and the ability to adopt a masculine identity may have been considered conducive to this process. (2) As Roth points out, the Egyptians appear to have believed that men, not women, were responsible for creating new life.85 She convincingly argues that, in the Egyptian understanding of the process of conception, the role of women was to stimulate male sexual arousal and then to receive the child (already fully formed in the semen) into her body.86 In the tomb of Nefertari, the queen's identification with Osiris, her association with the solar deity, and her gender fluidity are expressed directly and explicitly in the texts. Throughout the tomb, the inscriptions emphasize the queen's Osirian aspect by employing special epithets and phrases such as "Osiris Nefertari,"87 or "Justified with Osiris."88 The equation of Nefertari with Re is made through 84 Desroches-Noblecourt and Kuentz, he Petit Temple, vol. 2, pls. 59-64. 85 Roth, "Father Earth, Mother Sky," 189 ff. 86 Roth, "Father Earth, Mother Sky," 189. 87 For examples of the former, see Goedicke and Thausing, Nofretari, pls. 53, 59. 88 This term tends to follow the cartouche, in contrast to the appellation "Osiris" which directly precedes the queen's name or titles. The term "justified with Osiris" (m?( hrw hr Wsir) can occur without the "appellation" Osiris preceding Nefertari's name or titles. For examples, see Goedicke and Thausing, Nofretari, pls. 28, 30, 32, 34, 37, 69, 72. It can also occur in a sen- tence in which "Osiris" precedes the queen's name and titles (e.g., Wsir hmt nswt wrt nbt tlwy Nfrt iry mV hrw hr Wsir).

Paul Getty Trust, [1992]) the speech of various gods and goddesses, who give Nefertari, "the appearance of Re."89 They also express the wish that she "appear in the sky like Re"90 and enjoy "all protection, all guarding, like Re." In the transitional corridor, Anubis states the wish that Nefertari "appear in heaven like Re,"91 and that "Iu-geret be illuminated"92 with her rays. The grammatical gender of Nefertari's titles and pronouns suggest her fluid sexual state. When, for example, she is called "true-of-voice," this epithet is always rendered with masculine grammatical gender (mi'hrw) instead of feminine grammatical gender (i.e., mVt hrw). This stands in contrast to the consistent employment of the fem- inine grammatical gender in the titles that Nefer- tari assumed in life such as "hmt nswt wrt" "rt p(t" and "nbt tlwy."92 Furthermore, Book of the Dead chapter 17, which deals unequivocally with the notion that Nefertari is deceased and undergoing transformation, refers to the queen with mascu- line pronouns.94 In other inscriptions, when gods and goddesses address Nefertari directly, they use feminine, second-person singular pronouns or omit the pronoun altogether.95 Thus, she is a male "Osiris" in death, while the titles and epithets that she held in life reflect the female aspect of her identity. The pictorial representations of the queen further reinforce the notion of her gender fluidity. Throughout the tomb, the canonical Egyptian color encodement for male and female figures is em- ployed. Every male deity is shown with deep orange-brown or red-brown skin (with the exception of the golden canopic niche deities and the chthonic deities Osiris and Ptah, who are depicted with green skin). Every goddess, whether fully anthropomorphic or animal-headed, is depicted with yellow skin significantly lighter than that of the male deities. Nefertari's skin tone, however, ranges from a creamy pink-brown (with painterly flourishes such as shading on cheeks and nose) to a deep (and monochromatic) orange-brown or red-brown color, the same shades employed for male deities (fig. 16). Except for one scene, she is never represented with the yellow skin color used for the figures of 89 Goedicke and Thausing, Nofretari, 52. yu Goedicke and Thausing, Nofretari, 41-42, 44, 46-48. 91 Goedicke and Thausing, Nofretari, 47. 92 Goedicke and Thausing, Nofretari, 47. 9J Goedicke and Thausing, Nofretari, pls. 19-23, 27-28, 30, 32,34, 35-39, 41, 46, 48, 50, 52-69, 72-76, 78, 80, 85, 94-96, 98, 100-104, 106, 108-9, 112-16, 119-21, 123. 94 Goedicke notes that the assimilation with Osiris is responsible for the male grammatical gender. See Goedicke, Nofretari, 39, n. 50.

In all other tomb scenes, Nefertari's skin color is usually significantly darker- and al- ways different- from that of the female deities. The one exception to this rule (fig. 17) occurs near the south corner of the west wall of the burial chamber, where the queen is shown in the role of the "announcer"96 of the first gate in chap- ter 144 of the Book of the Dead. In this vignette, she is shown with yellow skin. This particular repre- sentation of Nefertari is made visually distinct from all of her other depictions by costume as well as skin color. Nefertari as the "announcer" wears a tight sheath dress- the "archaic" female costume worn by every goddess- instead of the loose-fitting white gown worn by women of the period, which she wears elsewhere in the tomb. This aspect of the queen, along with the door- keeper and guardian, confronts a typical darker- skinned representation of herself on the south wall of the burial chamber. The "announcer" Nef- ertari serves as a graphic guarantee of the efficacy of the process of the queen's rebirth and regener- ation, because she has successfully completed her transformation (the period of gender fluidity be- ing a temporary phase in the cyclical regenerative process)- and having done so has regained her un- ambiguously feminine aspect. In other words, the divine, yellow-skinned Nefertari is the ideal form that the queen will become at the conclusion of the process.97 The evidence that artisans were not completely restricted from using yellow to represent Nefer- tari in the tomb suggests that there was a special reason to refrain from employing yellow in all of the other representations. Thus, the anomalous yellow-skinned representation of the queen ap- pears to be an exception that clearly underscores the intentionality of the "masculine" color encodement in the many orange-brown and red-brown rep- resentations of Nefertari.98 The yellow-skinned Nefertari also provides a clear contrast with the more ambiguous representations with pink-brown skin (which might be envisioned as a "gender-fluid" color 96 Goedicke and Thausing, Nofretari, 49. Goedicke does not recognize the "announcer" as Nefertari. He describes the "announcer" figure of the first gate as a "woman without any special features." For the opinion that this image represents Nefertari- and is the tomb's only yellow-skinned representation of the queen, see Hornung, Valley of the Kings, 195, pl. 151. 9 A comparable use of visual art to ensure a desired result is discussed by Gay Robins, The Art of Ancient Egypt (Cambridge, 1997), 190. Robins suggests that a group of Deir el-Medina ostraca, decorated with images of women nursing their babies, show the dangerous process of childbirth as a successful fait accompli and were thus used to produce the desired outcome. 98 Although the tomb clearly employs traditional, canonical, gendered color encodement, at Abu Simbel the Small Temple's program represents all of the figures- gods and goddesses and the king and queen- with bright golden skin regardless of gen-</page><page sequence="21">THE OSIRIS NEFERTARI 193 Fig. 18. Illustration from the Book of the Dead chapter 164 (BM 10253) showing the ithyphallic form of the god- dess Mut-Pakhet (photograph © the British Museum) because they employ neither the "masculine" color encodement nor the specifically "feminine" yel- low, either). Until the Twentieth Dynasty, when Tyti (QV 52) and Isis (QV 51) were depicted through- out their tombs with pink-brown skin (without shading), Nefertari was the only queen known to be represented with this ambiguous skin color. All other surviving paintings from Nineteenth Dynasty queens' tombs show the royal women with the or- ange-brown or red-brown "masculine" skin color that contrasts with images of yellow-skinned god- desses in those same tombs." The variation in Nefertari's skin-color further supports the notion that, while death transforms the queen into the male Osiris and solar god, she also preserves the feminine identity that defined her living aspect- a state that perhaps finds a con- ceptual correlate in the ithyphallic form of the goddess Mut-Pakhet (fig. 18) that illustrates Book of the Dead chapter 164. 10° Another, very graphic, demonstration of female gender fluidity in funerary art comes from the tomb (QV 52) of Tyti, a Twentieth Dynasty royal woman, who is shown in one scene wearing the typical dress and regalia of a Ramesside queen, but is shown as the male Tyti/Iunmutef101 (fig. 19) in an adjacent scene. Roth suggests that the images of a female tomb owner retain an aspect of visible feminine identity in order to stimulate her male fertility and help her self-regeneration.102 It is possible then, to apply this idea to Nefertari's tomb, and to envision her own feminine form stimulating her male aspect and re-conceiving herself. I would, however, like to suggest another possibility- namely that she (in her deceased, male, Osirian/solar aspect) can be envisioned as being stimulated and regenerated through interaction with the goddesses represented on the walls of her tomb (of whom Isis and Hathor, the consorts of Osiris and Re, respectively, are those most frequently depicted). Conclusion Ramesses IFs conspicuous absence from the tomb of Nefertari appears to be an intentional and im- portant part of the process of Nefertari's regeneration. This absence can be understood when one der. The golden color is comparable to that used for the figures and hieroglyphs in the canopic niche of QV 66. As in the can- opic niche, the intent seems to be to represent figures that have golden flesh. 99 A scene from the tomb of Merytamun (QV 68), a daughter of Nefertari and Ramesses II, employs the same color en- codement scheme. A scene on the north half of the west wall of Merytamun's antechamber shows the queen standing be- tween Isis and Horus, Son-of-Isis. While Isis is depicted with light yellow skin, both Merytamun and Horus have dark orange-brown skin. See Leblanc, Ta Set Neferou, pl. 175. Other examples are from the sarcophagus chamber of the tomb (QV 73) of Henuttawy, pl. 188, and the Antechamber of the tomb (QV 40) of an anonymous queen, pls. 74, 75 (A); see Christian Leblanc and Alberto Siliotti, Nefertari e la Voile delle Regina (Florence, 1993), 65-67 for vivid color photos of the decorative program of the anonymous queen in QV 40, which shows that the queen appears to have dark-orange brown skin through- out the tomb, while goddesses are clearly shown with light yellow skin. 00 Faulkner, Book of the Dead, 160, 163. This chapter prescribes the use of an ithyphallic, three-headed figure of Mut-Pakhet while reciting wishes for the well being of the deceased in the afterlife. The chapter, however, is dedicated to ritual perfor- mance and does not explain the significance of the goddess's phallic form. 101 Leblanc, Ta Set Neferou, pl. 122; PM I, part 2, 758 (20)-(21). wz Roth, "Father Earth, Mother Sky," 199.</page><page sequence="22">194 JARCE XXXIX (2002) Fig. 19. Queen Tyti (QV 52) as a woman (left) and as the male Tytillunmutef (right) (photo by author) considers three key issues: the king's relationship to both Osiris and Re; hierarchical decorum and the ideology of queenship; and the necessity of the queen's assumption of masculine regenerative capacity (and her identification with Osiris and Re) in order to be reborn after death. Osiris, in his role as the deceased king of the netherworld, provides a model for the static and unchanging aspect of every Egyptian king in death- just as the solar deity serves as a parallel paradigmatic model for the cyclical renewal of the living and the deceased king. Both para- digms are "built in" to the ideology of masculine kingship. For this reason, the association of Ramesses II with Osiris and the solar deity is more appropriate than that of a royal woman with Osiris. Tomb inscriptions that frame Nefertari's power in terms of kingship (i.e., allowing Nefer- tari to sit on the throne of Osiris and endowing her with the rulership of Atum) bear this notion out by suggesting that Nefertari's role in the fu- nerary context must be equated with that of mas- culine rulership in order to facilitate her afterlife existence. 103 Nefertari is equated frequently and directly with both Re and Osiris in QV 66's texts; and her sexual fluidity is strongly suggested by the em- ployment of masculine grammatical gender in the inscriptions and by canonical masculine color en- codement in the pictorial images. If, however, the king were depicted in the tomb, he, as the male ruler (and as a higher-ranking royal than the queen), would be a more appropriate "Osiris" and "Re" for three important reasons: 1) The king, as the masculine aspect of kingship, has a considerably closer ideological relationship with both Osiris and Re than does the queen, who, as the feminine half of kingship, is associ- ated with the goddess Hathor. 104 2) The king's relationship to the queen within the context of kingship "fixes" Nefertari's unambig- uously female role, and if she is conceptually "locked in" to a feminine role, she cannot attain the fluidity of gender identity that would assist her association with Osiris and Re or her as- sumption of the masculine regenerative potential that would allow her to experience rebirth and renewal. 103 Hornung suggests that Nefertari's tomb directly borrows imagery from king's tombs, and these features set it apart from the tombs of officials and princes in Valley of the Kings, 186-87 and idem, "Zum Dekorationsprogramm des Nefertari-Grabes," 88-93. 104 por j-j^ asSociation of royal women with Hathor, and Hathor's role as the divine manifestation of the feminine prototype that royal women embody see Troy, Patterns of Queenship, 3, 53-72.</page><page sequence="23">THE OSIRIS NEFERTARI 195 3) In a related way, the fact that the king was of a higher status also has an impact upon Nefertari's ability to regenerate. The king's presence would force her, as a royal woman, into the specific subordinate position that reinforces her ideological role as the king's complementary (and female) opposite- a role that impedes her ability to assume both "kingly" status and gender fluidity. As the decorative program of the Small Temple illustrates, Nefertari is shown in a position of compositional (and conceptual) super ordination only when the name or image of Ramesses II is omitted. As mentioned previously, New Kingdom pharaohs are depicted in the tombs of their (lower status) sons, while Ramesses was omitted from Nefertari's tomb-just as all royal males were omitted from every archaeologically-known tomb of a Ramesside queen. This can be explained by the ideological construct of kingship itself. To wit, royal women (including mother, consort, and daughter) can be envisioned as the multigenerational feminine half of kingship, while the royal sons can be envisioned as part of the masculine half of kingship. Thus, the king's presence in his son's tomb does not com- promise the son's masculine regenerative capacity or his ability to become an Osiris, because the prince can be envisioned as one facet of the multigenerational masculine model of kingship105 (as exemplified by the mythic paradigm of Osiris and Horus or Amun and Khonsu). The queen, in contrast, is drawn in complementary opposition to the king. Thus the mechanism of regeneration that allows Nefertari to exist after death is contingent upon the queen's gender fluidity, her ability to assume both masculine regenerative capacity and Osirian/ solar identification, and a conceptual (perhaps "kingly") primacy of place- all of which would be impossible if the king were present. Furthermore, the expression of these ideas in the pictorial art of the tomb is directly related to the tomb's function as a vehicle for the queen's regeneration. Just as the conceptual balance of representations of the king and queen in the Small Temple's program are appropriate (and perhaps necessary) for the cultic function of the temple, so the manner in which the queen is represented in her tomb- without her husband and with a fluid sexual identity- is, at its core, an assurance of the proper function of the tomb and the guarantee of Nefertari's afterlife existence. 105 YOT a discussion of the "father-son" opposition as an application of the dualistic masculine generational structure see Troy, Patterns of Queenship, 27-28. Troy cites the juxtaposition of Atum and Re-Horakhty as gods with well defined spheres of reference in which Atum is associated with creation and Re-Horakhty is associated with rebirth.</page></plain_text>
