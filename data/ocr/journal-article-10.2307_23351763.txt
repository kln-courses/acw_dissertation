<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE GHOST HEAD MASK AND METAMORPHIC SHANG IMAGERY Elizabeth Childs-Johnson* Introduction The subject of imagery and its meaning in Shang ritual art has baffled scholars, perhaps as far back as the third century B.C. when the term taotie—demon devourer —was first coined to describe Shang imagery. It is my contention that the ubiquitous image portrayed on Shang ritual vessels was not a demon devourer, as earlier Eastern Zhou, Han and Song scholars would have us believe, but was rather an image of meta morphic power symbolizing access to influential, dead ancestors. Both art historical and epigraphic data support the interpretation that Shang ritual imagery was religiously meaningful. In order to amplify the visual and inscriptional evidence for a Shang religion based on metamorphic power, I intend here to analyze a series of key, complementary terms in oracle bone inscriptions. These key terms include the word gui M, usu ally translated spirit-ghost, and others directly related to gui, including ft and zhu IK, to invoke, and the cognate wei K. Specifically, I would like to elucidate why spirit ghosts of ancestors, called gui M in bone in scriptions, were envisioned as anthropomorphized animal masks and how this conception is connected with the shamanic foundation of Shang religion. My analyses are designed as a prologomenon to the study of oracle bone evidence for spirit invocation and related "shaman ic" practices. Art historians have long wrestled with the meaning and style of * I owe considerable thanks to a variety of scholars, including Paul L-M Serruys, Keniichi Takashima, K.C.

Although scholarly opinion is still divided as to the significance of ritual bronze imagery, due to the plethora of comparative epigraphical data, it is now possible to explore new ave nues to explain Shang representation. I have recently demonstrated that certain modes used to represent the animal image in Shang art were designed to symbolize magical transformation from the human to the animal realm,1 and that this transformation facilitated communication with the ancestor spirits (Fig. 1). Standardized modes of representation that document metamorphic properties include, for example, the inter changeable attributes of the human and the animal; the abbreviated body and devouring (transforming) dispositions; the displayed body; and the animal mask with body extended in the form of a cicada. The flat, abbreviated tiger mask (Fig. 2) and the representational, three dimensional tiger with clinging human are two variations —simple and complex, abstract and literal —of the theme of human to animal meta morphosis. The animal mask image may also be specific in representing the semi-legendary, high Shang ancestor Kui #! as transformed shaman priest.2 1.

This type of spirit communication is represented by certain sacrifices using ritual vessels in ceremonies, the earliest of which is yu US-exorcism or the Da Yu A IP?-Great Exorcism Rite.3 One of these communicatory sacrifices constituting part of the ex or cism rite of Period I and the later, ongoing Five Sacrifice Rites (Wu zhongjisi £ ® IE) was the wine offering i® meaning "to pour out heated, sometimes chang H-black, millet wine from the jue ft bronze vessel."4 Meat sacrifices using the ritual ding vessel were another, major type of offering made for spirit consumption. The flesh of ani mals, usually domesticated, but on more important occasions the wild trophy of the hunt, was prepared in different ways, the most popular of which is represented by the term shang "t, meaning "to offer meat cooked in the ritual bronze ding."5 Such meat and wine sacrifices origi nated as a form of communication with powerful royal spirits whose ancestry is traced to legendary high ancestors from the beginning of the Shang dynasty, such as Kui, Wang Hai and Xie 9k. The King as Shaman-Priest and Chief-in-Charge of the Invocation Rites — tJ and Zhu Kwang-chih Chang has proposed that shamanism played a central role in ancient Chinese politics and art.6 To Chang, the major focus of 3. Yw-exorcism and Da Yw-Great Exorcism rites were popular during the Wu Ding era, Periods I-IIA of bone inscriptions; see e.g., numerous examples cited in the con cordance of Shima Kunio H $5 M, Inkyo bokuji sorui S$46 K ffi5 (2nd rev. ed., Tokyo: Kukoshoin, 1971), 52.4-56.3. These rites died out and appear to have been replaced by the Five Sacrifice Rites. Yu were purification rites held on spontaneous occasions to counteract local curses of ancestor spirits (see e.g., Hou bian, shang 23.7, 28.3), and Da Yu was a formal rite involving ritual vessel sacrifices offered to spirits of the royal lineage (see e.g., Hou bian, xia 6.12; Cui bian, 79; Zhi yi 64).

He quotes the Guoyu |0!b of the fourth century B.C. where the communicatory func tion of shamans (xi M) and shamanesses (zuu M) is described. Chang propounds that this act of communication invested the king with a power that qualified him as shaman-in-chief. He also theorizes that Shang divinatory inscriptions, animal offerings, and ritual vessel imag ery were "instruments of the all-important heaven-earth communica tion." However, rather than analyze Shang data for his identification of Shang shamanism, Chang relies mostly on late Eastern Zhou and Han texts, such as the Shanhaijing [_U$5$S, Guoyu, and the study of wushu M lU-shamanism by Chen Mengjia Klrtic.7 By shamanism I refer to a religious practice that involves, to quote from Ake Hultkranz: "one who with the help of spirits attains a state that allows him to have a rapport with the supernatural world on behalf of his group members."8 As Hultkranz has also noted, "There is today . . . great confusion concerning the import of the term shamanism. This is most regretable since this is one of the most used terms in compara tive religion, folklore and ethnology."9 Hultkranz acknowledges that different places at different times emphasize different properties belong ing to the "shaman." He is insistent in maintaining, nonetheless, that one cannot depend on etymological explanations but rather one must depend upon phenomenological considerations in identifying universal properties of shamanism. Hultkranz also notes that practice includes "the frenzy or ecstasy connected with the shamanistic performance and other events associated with the shaman."10 But, unlike Mircea Eliade,11 Hultkranz points out that "the morphology of the ecstasy [trance?] can M % IS, "Shang Zhou qingtongqi shang de dongwu wenyang" $] &amp; SI, Kaogu yu wenwu =% i!f §5 J-C #5 1981.2, 53-67; "The Animal Motif in Shang and Chou Bronze Art," Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies 41.2 (1981), 527-554. 7. Chen Mengjia was probably the earliest to propose that Shang religion was founded on shamanism, and the only scholar to introduce how certain practices in Shang oracular inscriptions might be used to explain shamanic practice in Shang times; see "Shangdai de shenhua yu wushu," 466-576.

The shaman in essence "is a mediator between man and the powers."12 This description fits the function of the Shang king, in particular, as one who was chief-in charge of invocation. Evidence indicates that the king's major religio-political role in Shang times was as supernatural interlocutor, an intermediary between the world of the living and that of ancestor spirits. He was the chief priest. The well-being of his descent group and federated others depended on his ability to deal with the power of the ancestor spirits permeating all aspects of Shang life. There was no separation between the sacred and the secular. All was sacred. Ancestor spirits and Shang Di, the God on High, had unlimited powers to curse, and, if appeased, to bless. Shang Di was a primordial god distinguished from his offspring, the godlike royal ancestor spirits.13 From above, Di alone had the ability to com mand (ling -^J-) blessings or destruction. Shang Di, unlike royal spirits in the line of kingly succession, did not receive institutionalized sacrifices. Standardized rites of worship focused primarily on the Shang lineage stemming from Da Yi, founder of the dynasty or from Shang Jia, a dis tant Shang ancestor. Di, on the other hand, like high ancestor spirits, such as Kui and Wang Hai, could be addressed by liao ritual burning and other agriculturally related rites. This difference in type of sacrifice received by ancestors appears to reflect a convergence of earlier sha manic practices with the newly established cult of worshipping royal ancestors.14 12. Hultkranz, "A Definition of Shamanism," 34,29. 13. The relationship between kingly and supernatural power, or that between Shang Di and the royal ancestral spirits, has been the subject of unresolved debate. Shang Di, for example has been treated from two different extremes: either as an abstraction without specific godly attributes or as an ultimate ancestor, the progenitor of the Shang ruling house. Both definitions have their difficulties but the second appears to be more accurate. The problem in identifying Shang Di's nature has to do with the difficulty of identifying the original meaning of Di. It is significant that Shang Di was worshipped with liao sacrifice like other distant kings. Shang Di was also received in the bin K rite by deceased royal kings; see David N. Keightley, "The Religious Commitment: Shang Theology and the Genesis of Chinese Political Structure," History of Religions 17 (1978), 215. Like them and kingly spirits, Di shares power over the natural world. Shang Di stands at the pinnacle of a spiritual hierarchy, beneath which are royal ancestors in order of their succession. Shang Di appears to have been primordial, in the sense of having comprehensive power over the kings beneath him. 14. Chang Tsung-tung recognizes the standardization of ancestor rites as signifying a change in religious outlook, from the cult of the ghost of Period I to the cult of the ancestor spirit of Period IIB-V (Der Kult der Shang Dynastie, 159,161). I agree in part with this interpretation but would emphasize that the cult of the ghost con</page><page sequence="7">ELIZABETH CHILDS-JOHNSON 85 By Period II, the most important ceremonies undertaken to counteract the potential threat of royal ancestor spirits and, theoretically, of Shang Di, were scheduled sacrifices in ritual vessels offered by the king and his kin. Equally significant is one other rite that I interpret to be the stand ard for royal shamanic practice in Shang times and a major piece of evi dence demonstrating that the Shang king acted as shaman. The name for this rite, ff, conceivably means "to carry out spirit invocation." Although we cannot trace the origins of this word to a period before Late Shang writing, and it does not have a modern equivalent, the rite to which it referred must have originated in a pre-Shang setting. Like that of bin 'M "to entertain the dead," and zhan £ "to prognosticate," this rite was the prerogative of the king. The graph portrays a figure — tinues to be all-important since, like Shang Di, the power of the ghost of royal ances tor spirits to curse and bless is consistent throughout inscriptions of Periods I-V. I see evidence for a change in religious orientation with a new emphasis on the institution alization of ancestor worship rites; see David N. Keightley, "The Religious Commit ment," 216. There is a deemphasis on shamanistic practices and outlook, as, for example, represented by the disappearance of liao cult burning and related agricultural rites addressed to Shang Di and high ancestors. On the latter point, Chang also wrestles with the idea that ritual bronze art may represent a survival of earlier concepts: Zusammenfassend stellen wir eine Zweigleisigkeit in der Religion der Shang fest. Einerseits war ihr Kult, wie wir ihn aufgrund der Orakelinschriften rekon struiert haben, diesseitsbezogen und an Fabelwesen arm; im Mittelpunkt stand der Kult der eigenen Ahnen als machtige Universalgotter. Andererseits gibt die Kunst der als Grabbeigaben hergestellten Bronzen eine Glaubenswelt mit zahl reichen tiergestaltigen Ungeheuer wieder, an der die Shang offenbar nicht mehr festhielten. In diesem Sinne ware die Kunst der Sakralbronzen bereits zur Shang-Zeit ein "Survival" geworden, ein unorganisches and unverstandenes Uberleben von Vorstellungen alterer Entwicklungszustande (Der Kult der Shang Dynastie, 261). His point about "survival" is fundamental in understanding the limitations of our literary evidence. Shamanistic tendencies, such as use of a mask symbol in art, are already present in Early Shang art and in pre-Shang Late Neolithic art of Liangzhu and Longshan eras; see e.g., Mou Yongkang Jc JjrC, "Liangzhu yuqi shang shen chongbai de tansuo" .filf _h Qingzhu Su Bingqikaogu wushiwu nian lunwenji (Beijing; Wenwu chubanshe, 1989). By the time of Wu Ding in Late Shang times, there is already evidence that ancestors were not envisioned as individualized gods but as generic, generationally significant spirits with god-like power. Hu Houxuan )f- el identifies a similar change in em phasis from worship of gods to that of kings, with the result that kings in post-Wu Ding inscriptions were addressed with the title Di as in Shang Di; see Hu Houxuan, "Yindai zhi tianshen" 1$ ft ^ if, Jiaguxue Shangshi luncong ^ ® ^ Ufa if, (Chengdu: Jilu daxue, 1945), 300-301. Chen Mengjia identifies this change as one from a fear of animals to a fear of ^/-ancestral ghosts, and the consequent anthropomorph ization of myth into history, or transformation from animal to human; see Chen, "Shangdai shenhua yu wushu," 515,568.</page><page sequence="8">86 THE GHOST HEAD MASK AND METAMORPHIC SHANG IMAGERY presumably the king as shaman-priest —donning a spirit mask and kneeling before an ancestral altar. To Guo Moruo ^ this graph is related to §|t and is an early form of si IE, "to sacrifice."15 Other scholars, such as Ye Yusen 3Si3£3SS and Li Xiaoding argue that the graph is interchangeable with zhu of bone and bronze inscriptions.161 main tain that this term means "to invoke or to conjure the ancestor spirit by donning a ghost head (spirit mask)." I also maintain that because this verb of invocation is the Shang king's prerogative, the Shang king acted as shaman-priest. Variations of the graph t? share the major components of a kneeling figure wearing a spirit mask in front of either an altar, wine container, wine droplets, or a bound bundle of fragrant grasses, signifying sacrifi cial offerings of the kneeling propitiant. The head part has been inter preted to refer to a spirit mask in the guise of an animal.17 The latter identification is supported by the fact that the Han term for spirit mask, qi SB, can be traced to and identified as primarily a phonetic loan for the mask radical in this verb of invocation and in the graph for spirit ghost. The signific for altar is believed to represent a stand for ancestor spirit sacrifices.18 The other components, such as a bundle of fragrant grasses and wine, probably refer to specific offerings that were used in invoking spirits. The verbal meaning "to carry out invocation" is based on the graphic and semantic similarity of t? to zhu |5J. The graphic evidence is the most significant. Zhu is also composed of a kneeling figure and altar, and may also be written without the altar component. In addition, if zhu is not combined with the altar component, it may be combined with wine drops or a tied bundle of fragrant grasses and represent the same word.19 Only the head part of the kneeling figure is drawn differently. For zhu the head is drawn upturned with mouth open. This disposition lends 15.

One senses that in reality the Shang king while kneeling and donning the mask or raising his head in trance-like prayer, with the accompaniment of fragrant wine and grass offerings, could successfully communicate with the dead.

Tie yun 127.1 Apparently zhu was popular over a longer time period, since it can be documented in use from Bone Periods I through V, while t? appears only occasionally and entirely in Period I inscriptions. Zhu must have been favored by scribes as the way to write the name for this royal rite of invocation. The change in terminology from ff to zhu also appears to parallel the chronological change from use of the Da Yu-Great Exorcism rite during Period I to use of the Five Sacrifice Rites in scheduled ances tor worship during Period IIB and thereafter. This change suggests a de emphasis on "pure" shamanism to a form of shamanism integrated with bureaucratic ancestor cult worship emphasizing the Shang royal lineage. In later texts, zhu continued to mean to invoke or call down ancestral spirits. The ritual practice of invocation continued to be prevalent, but with the major change that the invoker was not necessarily a shaman king, as in Shang times, but a religious professional. In the Shuowen, zhu is defined: 20. Chen Mengjia identifies this invoker as the shaman-king; see "Shangdai shen hua yu wushu," 533-535. In the much later Han Shuowen definition for zhu, the one who invokes is identified as a ww-shaman.</page><page sequence="10">88 THE GHOST HEAD MASK AND METAMORPHIC SHANG IMAGERY The one in charge of prayers offered at sacrifices; [it] derives from shi 'altar/ ren 'human' and kou 'mouth.'21 Duan Yucai IS 3l M states that zhu is an etymonic compound of three words, including altar, kneeling human, and mouth refering to a person who communicates with shen spirits. Xu Shen's definition continues: One [tradition] says that [zhu] derives from an abbreviated form of dui. The Yijing says: "Dui is fcou-mouth and is a wu-shamaness." From the equation of zhu and wu ffi, it is clear that in Han times one who invokes was a wu: one who has the power to communicate with the supernatural. Earlier Western Zhou inscriptions and references from the Shang shu and Shi jing also refer to zhu as "the chief invoker" or "presiding invoker," although a professional is identified in this role rather than the king.22 The Equivalence of Guitou (Ghost Head) and Qitou (Masked Invoker) In the Shuowen jiezi of Eastern Han date the graph gui, spirit ghost, is defined: Gui is that part of a person that returns [after death] as gui. It is from a kneeling man and a head resembling a guitou (qitou) {gui head=spirit mask). It is from "selfish" because gui [consists of] yin breath which can cause harm.23 As defined here by Xu Shen, gin-spirit ghost is composed of a kneeling human and guitou, ghost head. In the Li ji HIB, the gui belonged to that part of a dead person that returns to earth, gui tu If ih.24 It is pre cisely this omnipresent influence of the deceased spirit, gui, that earlier Shang leaders sought to control through invocation and conjuration.

Gui and guitou of Han times and the box-like head of the kneeling worshipper in the Shang invoking graph are epigraphically related to another term, cji M. or cjitou SI H, meaning animal mask, as found else where in the Shuowen and related ritual texts of Eastern Zhou and Han times. Qi is written variably, sometimes with gui as the signific: IS. One of the post-Shang variations appears in a reference to the well-known pas sage of the Zhou li J?f H (Xia Guan section), where the chief invoker (zhuje Iffi #) is the fangxiangshi ft, or one who sees in all (four) directions. This invoker or fangxiangshi is described as wearing a cover ing of a bear skin with four golden bronze, inlaid eyes. He wears this mask in order to expel evil and exorcize gwz-human ghost pestilences.25 For our purposes the key phrase is in the Han commentary of Zheng Xuan who states: Meng is mao to cover or to raise over; the one who wears the bear skin does so in order to drive out evil pestilence of gui-, (this meng) is just like today's qitou MS-26 In definitions relating to gui, cjitou and guitou are evidently inter changeable binomes. In the Shuowen, guitou means "ghost head." According to other descriptive post-Shang accounts it means "spirit mask." Thus, ghost head and spirit mask are one and the same. As chief invocator and exorcist, the Han period fangxiangshi at the Da Nuo (Great Exorcism) rite and funerals presided while wearing a cjitou-head mask of a bear, evidently symbolically metamorphosing into the spirit of this wild beast in exorcizing guz-spirit ghosts. It is my contention that this impersonator is the ritual heir of the Shang king who as chief priest presided over organized rites of exorcism two thousand years earlier. In the Fengsu tongyi Ying Shao MEtj also writes qitou with the gui radical and phonetic qi to refer to the spirit mask. He states: 25. Zhou li zhushu /SllitjiSS (Sibu beiyao ed.), 7.28.5a. 26. Zhou li zhushu, 7.28.5a; Gao You refers to a similar passage in Huainanzi and with a similar interpretation that HI is 81 and M is ®i, or that the gui spirit mask is the same as the Han exorcist head mask worn to exorcize demons; see Wang Niansun £ ed., Huainanzi tIS? (rpt., Shanghai: Commercial Press, 1989), 7.57.20 fjf. In tracing the origin of puppets and history of the head mask, Sun Kaiti relies on the above references; see "Kueilei xi kaoyuan," 84-89. Sun's analyses identify the head masks as impersonator's masks worn at traditional funeral rites since the Han dynasty and as the basis of puppet mask imagery.</page><page sequence="12">90 THE GHOST HEAD MASK AND METAMORPHIC SHANG IMAGERY According to custom it is said that a deceased person's /zurz breath wanders, so for this reason one makes a qitou to preserve it; it is said that the head was masklike and big.27 Ying Shao believed that qitou was originally a mask to preserve the hun, to recall the dead person's spirit while also exorcising the spirit's poten tial to harm. In the section on ritual of the Hou Hanshu VkMW it is stated that "Each of the one-hundred officials of the guanfu (official residence) used wooden masks in the image of hunted beasts (mumianshou SK) to officiate at the Nuo (Exorcism) ceremony."28 These literary references suggest that the signific Si is 1: the equivalent of qi SI of the Shuowen; 2: the original root of gui j&amp;; and 3: the signifier of the invoking ceremony ff in Shang bone inscriptions. The Cognate Wei fk Meaning Supernatural Majesty It is now evident that the basic graphic component of ft and ancestor spirit is the mask of a wild beast worn by a human petitioner that is usually the king. Certain other terms, in particular, the cognate wei, are significant in showing just how prevalent royal shamanic practice must have been during the Shang and before when these rituals originated and thrived. Both words derive their meaning from and are composed of the mask signifier. The bone graph hf, transcribed wei Jfl, is written like gwi-spirit-ghost or one dressed up in a gui mask beside a stick like object. The stick-like part of wei probably refers to bu, "the crack that appears as a result of divination." Possibly the communication of the king-priest dressed in a spirit mask resulted in the spiritual response of the cracked bone. If the term is transcribed H and as is standard, the graph in origin appears to have had the connotation "the awe produced when the king in donning an animal mask conjured the ancestor spirit." In early Western Zhou contexts, wei means "majesty" or "to be awe inspiring, fearsome." These meanings continue to be based on the mask signific, and continue to denote awe that derives from the king7s meta morphic power when wearing the mask. Many examples may be cited to elucidate this evolution of meaning. In the inscription of the Mao Gong ding, for example, wei is used in the phrase "jing nian wang wei" ffc 27. Ying Shao J® 81), Fengsu tongyi JH'f&amp;SS, as quoted in Taiping yulan (Shanghai: Commercial Press, 1935), 552. 28. Hou Hanshujijie (Sibu beiyao ed.), 15.8b.</page><page sequence="13">ELIZABETH CHILDS-JOHNSON 91 "to reverently uphold the king7s majesty."29 In the inscription of the Da Yu ding, wei is used in the phrase, "Be in awe (wei) of the awe someness (wei) of heaven" (wei tian wei fl^cH).30 In A Dictionary of Early Zhou Chinese, Axel Schuessler glosses wei as meaning terror or majesty and cites numerous examples from the Shi jing, Shu jing, and other bronze inscriptions.31 Wez is almost always used to describe the power of a supreme being, mostly the king but also Shang Di or Heaven. This equation indicates that during the Western Zhou the source of the king's power, as the son of Heaven, was described by the metamorphic power of mask-wearing. Conclusions It is clear that gui % and related words wei ^ and ft are intertwined in meaning due to their graphic origin in the mask element. Given the abundant evidence for the animal mask in art and ritual practice and the evidence that this mask represents access to the spirit ghost of royal ancestors, religion and art can be said to coincide in a shamanic orienta tion. Should we call the ubiquitous animal mask in ritual art a gui spirit mask or a qitou, as it is known in Zhou and Han literature? The evidence for the king7s role as shaman priest in invocation rites, in particular, and his singular power of spirit communication with Shang Di and godlike royal ancestors strongly supports the interpretation that Shang art and religion were based on an earlier tradition of shamanism. The emphasis on masked invocation in religion, the ancestor ghost as a conjured ani mal spirit, and the animal vehicle in art further substantiate that Shang religion was founded on shamanic practices. Whether this shamanic power basis was established during pre-Shang or Xia times and merely continued as a formal ceremony in Shang times remains to be clarified. That ancestor cult worship became rigidly bureaucratized by Late Shang times while ritual bronze mask imagery concomitantly degenerated, particularly in a loss of focus on the animal mask of transformation, suggests the displacement of a magical shamanic power for a religious one that was no longer entirely dependent on deceased spirits and a shaman king for leadership. Rather, the orientation of royal and spirit power changed to a system closer to that of the Western Zhou, where power was not based directly on anthropomorphized ancestor spirits 29. W.A.C.H.

If, as evidence suggests, Shang art was founded on the religious principle of human to animal metamorphosis, the Shang must be recognized as pivotal in the foundation of ancient Chinese cosmology and the continuum of Nature called the Da Hua or Great Transformation. DISCLAIMER: Due to a singular editorial decision, all graphics and com parative inscriptional data, the majority of bone inscriptions and literary citations have been deleted from the above paper. As a consequence, the very important argument that seeks to explain finally the meaning of ritual bronze imagery through bone inscriptional evidence was serious ly undermined.
