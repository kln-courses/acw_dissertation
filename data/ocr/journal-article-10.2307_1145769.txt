<plain_text><page sequence="1">Theatre of Nations Ed. Note: What's with the "national press"? In Baltimorefor two weeks inJune 1986 fistfuls of theatres fiom the Americas, Europe, and Asia played the Theatre of Nations. It was the first time this international festival was held in the United States. But except for the brouhaha surrounding the "cancellation"* of Britain's National Theatre production of George Orwell's Animal Farm, neither the New York Times nor the Village Voice nor Newsweek nor Time reviewed the festival. Hey, Mel Gussow, Erika Munk, Michael Feingold, Jack Kroll, et al., where were you? Festivals like TON bring an all-too-rare chancefor artists of different nations to see each others' work, converse, exchange ideas and tech- niques. Not to mention the benefits for audiences. Because the coverage outside of Baltimore was nonexistent, TON was actually a local event when it should have been an international gathering ofgroups greeted by a national gathering of specta- tors. If this opportunity comes again, I hope the press won't repeat its negligence. Although TDR can't make up for the lack-after all, we are a quarterly, anything you read here comes months after the fact-we arefeaturing not only an overall article on TON, but a more focused look at several performances: Shali- ko's (USA) The Yellow House, Gardzienice's (Poland) Avvakum and other works, and, in a future issue, Charabanc's (Northern Ireland) Gold in the Streets. Theatre of Nations Baltimore I986 Richard E. Kramer Between I5 and 29 June 1986, Japanese theatre came to Baltimore, Maryland. So did Indian theatre, and Czech, Hungarian, Bulgarian, Bra- zilian, Polish, British, Irish, Canadian, Italian, Swedish, and American theatre. Principally through the offices of Producer T. Edward Hamble- ton, Theatre Project Director Philip Arnoult, and the U.S. Director of the International Theatre Institute (ITI) Martha Coigney, "The City of the White Stoops" captured the first North American presentation of the Theatre of Nations, sponsored biennially for the past 30 years by ITI. There were 103 performances of 33 works by 22 groups and solo per- formers from 13 countries in I6 spaces during 14 days (Monday, I6June, was dark). Along with the international companies and performers, io entries from the United States showed I3 works from New York, San Francisco, and Baltimore. The pieces ranged from traditional drama to ballet to nonconventional theatre to performance art. Not that all went smoothly. Just as at the 1981 International Theatre Festival, area blacks objected to the appearance of a South African com- pany, despite the fact that it featured two distinguished but banned black *Cancellation is in quotation marks because, although it was officially taken off the TON program, Animal Farm played its fill run on schedule.</page><page sequence="2">Theatre of Nations Participants and Productions BRAZIL (Paraty, R.J.)

A Soviet protest over the inclusion of Peter Hall's adaptation of George Orwell's Animal Farm forced ITI President Wole Soyinka to separate the National Theatre of Great Britain's production from the official festival activities. Animal Farm (plate I) went on as scheduled, but it was considered an "indepen- dent" production. Shortly after the festival opened, another Eastern Bloc country caused a momentary flap. Newspapers such as the New York Times, the Washington Post, and Back Stage reported that Bolek Polivka, touring with his group Divadlo na Provazku, had been recalled to Czechoslovakia by his govern- ment. No reasons were given, and neither the Czech Embassy in Wash- ington, D.C., nor Polivka himself claimed to know anything about the recall. In the end, Polivka's TheJester and the Queen went on as planned, playing to full houses. His opening performance audience included the Czech ambassador, the cultural attache, and their spouses. After his last performance, Polivka married his "Queen," French actress Chantal Pol- lain, on the stage of the Theatre Project. Aside from covering the Animal Farm protest and the Polivka rumor, there was next to no national press notice of the Theatre of Nations. The "thirty to fifty journalists, from out of state and all over the world, [. . . writing 'Dateline Baltimore' stories," as one of the festival's principal fin- ancers had hoped, did not materialize (Lord I986:94). For some, such as the Shaliko Company's Leonardo Shapiro, a national spotlight was an important reason for performing at the festival. Shapiro, regretting the absence of representatives of other festivals, had hoped that</page><page sequence="4">Reports IO5 The Yellow House, an exploration of Vincent Van Gogh through his let- ters to his brother Theo, would be picked up for further productions as a result of its Baltimore appearance (plate 2). He was bitterly disappointed with the press apathy: "I thought Jack Kroll [of Newsweek] was going to write. [. . .] He was here the first week and he left. He told me he would come back and he didn't. There has been no national press. I got a great review in the Baltimore Sun, which is not going to get me anywhere. So, if I don't get some kind of national press out of this, this is the end of [The Yellow House]."' ITI's Coigney, when told by a visiting New Yorker at the end of the festival that the New York Times had given al- most no space to the festival aside from the Animal Farm brouhaha, said she was "angry as hell at their apathetic attitude." Nonetheless, the Theatre of Nations was chock-a-block with some of the best and most interesting performances available in the participating countries. Just as the works on view were varied in style and content, so were the audiences. Certainly some people went to many different perfor- mances, and theatre folk were ubiquitous, but the more traditional offerings such as Animal Farm and, even though it was performed in Bulgarian, the Ivan Vasov National Theatre's Retro attracted an older, tie-and-jacket crowd. The more experimental pieces, such as Fred Curchack's Inquestfor Freddy Chickan, Shaliko's The Yellow House, the work of the Swedish- international collective Jordcirkus, and Poland's Gardzienice Theatre As- sociation appealed to a younger, blue jeans-and-sneakers audience. 2.

Sprinkled among the spectators were theatre celebrities such as actresses Helen Hayes, Mildred Natwick, and Celeste Holme, La Mama's Ellen Stewart, and producer- director Hal Prince. Because each show was presented only one to eight times, there were opening nights right up until 27 June. Something new was available al- most every day of the festival and, despite matinees and varying curtain times, it was not possible to see everything. Many groups, particularly the international companies, came to Balti- more as part of an extensive tour, arriving from another venue and de- parting for a new one somewhere else. Some groups brought one piece and some two or more. Most of the works were not new. Ghashiram, the Police Chief (Ghashiram Kotwal) by the Theatre Academy of Pune, India, had been in that company's repertory for 15 years (plate 4), while Shali- ko's The Yellow House was reconceived especially for the festival. One performance was a genuine premiere: Fred Curchack's Freddy Chickan. Aside from the obvious boost to the tourist trade and the interest to habitual theatregoers in a gathering of performers from far and wide, there is an important benefit of international festivals for American the- atre professionals. They need to rub artistic elbows with colleagues doing different kinds of work elsewhere in the world. Without cross-fertiliza- tion, theatre stagnates. Arnoult, whom Coigney called "a card-carrying internationalist" (Lord 1986:93), accused American theatre artists of being "criminally isolated, not only from the rest of the world, but from each other." Even the established geographical regions, such as the Midwest and the Boston-Washington corridor on the east coast, behave as if they are walled off from each other. American directors, for example, do not talk to one another, asserted Stan Wojewodski, Jr., artistic director of Baltimore's Center Stage and a Theatre of Nations codirector. They seem threatened by cross-fertiliza- tion and will seldom travel to Los Angeles, Chicago, or Louisville, much less to Paris, Edinburgh, or Avignon to see colleagues' productions. Fes- tivals give artists an opportunity to see the work of a collection of others compacted into a short period of time. Wojewodski said that a number of the participating artists had expressed delight at being in Baltimore for the festival. Geoffrey C. Shlaes, a free-lance director and artistic director of the American Directors Institute, was taken enough with Shaliko's The Yellow House to spend more than an hour discussing the work with Shapiro. Shapiro himself explained that being in Baltimore was "important to me for the same reason that having a company is important to me-to be a citizen and to find some way to have a base from which I can say something about the way things are done. I think the festival is important because American theatre is completely closed in-just like the rest of the society." Mohan Agashe, president of the Theatre Academy of Pune and a leading actor in Ghashiram, the Police Chief, expressed the same thought: "The reason we also go to national theatre festivals [in India] is also to get input. If you keep on getting lost in things only you are doing, I'm sure you'll run out of your own resources very soon. At some point it's very necessary to see the work of others."</page><page sequence="7">Io8 Reports Despite Wojewodski's indictment of American directors, Shapiro spoke enthusiastically of the work of colleagues whom he respects and from whom he draws inspiration. He praised the puppetry of Marcos and Ra- chel Ribas of Brazil's Grupo Contadores de Estorias (The Storytellers) and is in contact with Dario Fo, who, along with everything else, is an expert on masks. Fo advised Shapiro on two future Shaliko projects, a production of Vladimir Mayakovsky's Mystery Bouffe and Punch!, a new Punch-and-Judy show. Agashe was drawn to Poland's Gardzienice and described several performances from Africa, Spain, and Belgium he saw at the International Theatre Fortnight in Quebec City, where the group had been before Baltimore. Many of the other Theatre of Nations artists were in the audiences during their times off and gathered nightly to chat at Club 45, the makeshift cafe behind Arnoult's Theatre Project. It is a way, as Agashe put it, to "know where you really stand in the world scene. " The Theatre of Nations is such an important event partially because such exchanges are still rare in the United States. Past festivals in Balti- more (1977, '78, '79, and '81) and the recent ones in Los Angeles (1984) and Chicago (1986) notwithstanding, festivals, popular in Europe and Asia, are uncommon here. One reason is distance. Regardless of borders and governments, it is still logistically less daunting to transport a com- pany from Budapest to Paris or from Helsinki to Edinburgh than it is to bring one from Europe, Asia, Africa, or South America to New York, Los Angeles, or Chicago. Transportation aside, Ghashiram, the Police Chief which has a simple set and few props, cost $20,000 to produce at the festival. This figure is at the low end of the spectrum because the Indian company does not pay its personnel. Shaliko, who only had to transport their production from New York, spent $46,000 to come to the Theatre of Nations. Unable to raise their original projected budget of $70,000, the company persuaded the artists to take severe cuts in pay to get the show produced in Baltimore. The entire festival was originally budgeted at $I.5 million. With $335,000 provided by city, state, and federal agencies, $309,000 raised from the local business community, plus $I50,000 expected from sales of tickets ranging from $6 to $25, that would have left a shortfall of more than $700,000 and therefore necessitated a reduction in expenditures. San Francisco, initially slated to share the festival with Baltimore, could not raise the required $300,000 bond because of apparent lack of interest by local business and relinquished its claim to the event. Logistics and distance are not the only costs, however. Americans have an attitude about money that, according to Agashe, makes mounting fes- tivals difficult. In negotiating a tour in Europe, Agashe noted, "the inevi- table sequence would be what work it is, then they would discuss time, and finally we would come to money. But, invariably, here in America nobody would even ask me a single question about the work. The first thing they ask about is money." If the work is worth doing, Agashe maintained, money can be found, but not if the project is dismissed out- of-hand on the basis of finances alone. Americans are also language chauvinists. According to Agashe, Coig- ney had warned that "to take any non-English-speaking theatre to Amer- ica is next to impossible." Arnoult admonished that our "one-and-a-half language society" prejudices Americans against foreign performances, re- gardless of dependence on language (Strausbaugh I985:2). Unless it is Tango Argentino, Marcel Marceau, or grand opera, Americans just will</page><page sequence="8">Reports Io9 not accept it. Agashe traveled throughout the United States before bring- ing the Pune Academy here, and, despite the warnings, decided, "OK, it's difficult, but if we leave it at that, it will not happen at all. Somebody has to go ahead and do it." The Theatre Academy's I6 North American performances, he points out, have been well-received by both audiences and critics in such cities as Dayton, Ohio; Fullerton, California; and Rockville, Maryland. This was borne out by reactions at performances of Dario Fo's Comic Mystery (Mistero Buffo) and Franca Rame's It's All Bed, Board and Church, (Tutta Casa, Lietto e Chiesa) in Italian with live transla- tion and supertitles; the Suzuki Company of Toga's Clytemnestra, mostly in Japanese with one actor speaking English (plate 5); and the Ivan Vasov National Theatre's Retro, entirely in Bulgarian. Other performances did not depend on language at all, such as Grupo Contadores' silent puppet plays, Hungary's Gyor Ballet, and Martha Clarke's The Garden of Earthly Delights (plate 6). Still others were present- ed in English by multilingual performers such as Jordcirkus and Bolek Polivka. Still, these performances are not seen in the U.S. often enough to break down our prejudices and fears of not understanding them be- cause, it seems, we simply do not have a tradition of sharing our work. The Theatre of Nations was first held in Paris in I956, and remained there until 1975 when it became a biennial event hosted by a different country each time. Nevertheless, it has taken II years for the festival to come to North America, mostly because, as Agashe asserted, "it's just 5. The Suzuki Company of Toga's Clytemnestra was given in Japanese, with one actor speaking Eng- lish. Pictured is Kayoko Shiraishi as Clytemnestra. (Photo courtesy of the The- atre of Nations) 6.

Blood and Champagne (Blodsband) was one of four productions that the Stockholm-based Jordcirkus brought to the Theatre of Nations. (Photo courtesy of the Theatre of Nations) not customary." Well, now we have tried it and, despite being ignored by the press and other festival representatives, it has worked. Within the smorgasbord of offerings, there was a bias toward the ex- perimental. According to Wojewodski, this was neither an accident nor the result of the organizers' personal interests. In most major American cities there are good companies that present Shakespeare, Chekhov, Ibsen, O'Neill, Mamet, or Shepard. What is needed is more exposure to the out-of-the-ordinary. What would be the point of a festival that fea- tured only what everyone is already familiar with? Who would travel any distance to see it? The experimental bent of the Theatre of Nations also had another ratio- nale. Arnoult remarked that the American avant-garde of the '6os was greatly influenced by Europeans such as Peter Brook, Jerzy Grotowski, and Eugenio Barba. American groups in the '70s synthesized the Europe- an influences into an indigenous form and returned the impulse to Eu- rope, where it was picked up by new experimental troupes. Now, in the '8os, the work of American experimenters is better known in Europe than it is in America, and both Arnoult and Wojewodski are endeavoring to "complete the circle" by reintroducing new European work to Ameri- can artists. They saw the Theatre of Nations as a way of bringing recep- tive artists together in a big way. Theories and intellectual projections aside, the Theatre of Nations festi- val was a success from the point of view of audiences who saw and en- joyed a great selection of theatre. As Coigney said of the reactions she had overheard, "This is what it should be about-people just saying, 'My kid saw that and loved it'; 'My wife thought it was fun.'" No criticism, no analysis-just enjoyment. There was certainly something for everyone to enjoy. To begin with, there was Animal Farm, controversy aside. Peter Hall's production is a straightforward rendering of Orwell's fable with lyrics by Adrian Mitchell and music by Richard Peaslee, who also did the music for Martha Clarke's Garden of Earthly Delights. This pair also composed the music for the Royal Shakespeare Company's Marat/Sade and US. As a small child sits at the down-right corner of the forestage, reading the novella with his back to the audience, the anthropomorphic beasts of Manor Farm create and then subvert an animal workers' paradise. With costumes and masks ranging from full heads for the horses, cows, and donkeys to snouts for the pigs, and stilts of varying heights for the animals' forelegs (plate 7), the production style is as simple as a child's pop-up book and the theme as subtle as a sledgehammer. Orwell's blunt antitotalitarian, specifically anti-Stalinistic moral was neither diluted nor enhanced by the National Theatre's interpretation. No wonder the Soviets objected. Jordcirkus, a ten-year-old communal theatre group from Stockholm, brought four pieces to Baltimore. They performed one of their street pieces, As the Bird Flies (Fagelvag), at the opening ceremonies, presented one matinee performance of a children's play, A Little Princess (Draken), and several performances each of Blood and Champagne (Blodsband) and The Duel (Duellen). Blood and Champagne, inspired by Latin American novelist Gabriel Gar- cia Marquez's 100 Years of Solitude, recounts the four-generational history of the Montoya family as a young man learns it from the ghosts of his ancestors (plate 8). Anselmo has been locked in a room since childhood to hide his family's shame at his illegitimate birth. When he emerges from his prison, there is no one left in the house, except voices from the past.</page><page sequence="10">In a fast-paced and physical presentation, Jordcirkus actors double and triple as many characters-some real, some long dead, some purely imaginary. The company, adept at mime and circus arts as well as con- ventional acting, has combined many styles and techniques, using bits of costume and a jumble of a set made of corrugated metal and wooden slats, into a performance that alternately draws the audience in and as- saults its senses. Often hard to follow intellectually, the story unfolds in fits and starts, confusing reality with fantasy and past with present. Though each actor often seems to be in his or her own production, the energy never flags. In a more conventional vein, the Ivan Vasov National Theatre of Bul- garia presented Retro, a straight comedy by Russian playwright Alex- ander Galin (plate 9). In subtle but conventional Stanislavskian realism, the six actors are able to communicate, with the aid of an English synop- sis, the tenderness and most of the humor of the situation. The story is of a young couple who are frustrated by an elderly, widowed father who never leaves the house. They invite three lonely women over for a visit in the hopes that he will marry one of them. Though the visitors are sup- posed to come at different times, they all show up at once-and the old man refuses to cooperate.</page><page sequence="11">I 2 Reports 9. The Ivan Vasov Nation- al Theatre of Bulgaria pre- sented Retro, a straight comedy by Russian play- wright Alexander Galin. (Photo courtesy of the The- atre of Nations) The incongruity of a Russian play performed in Bulgarian before an American audience is momentarily disconcerting, but the truthfulness of the performances and the consistency of the characterizations manage to come through. Of all the Theatre of Nations presentations, Retro was the most dependent on language, and though a simultaneous translation was proposed, it was rejected by festival producers as too complex and expensive. Dependent more on the traditional Asian storytelling techniques of mu- sic, mime, and dance than on language, the Theatre Academy of Pune presented Ghashiram, the Police Chief. Written for the company by Vijay Tendulkar, the two-act play is the story of a corrupt Igth-century mayor of Pune who appoints an even more corrupt police chief who becomes a vicious tyrant. The work combines techniques of Western theatre with those of traditional Indian performances, especially the moving human wall, borrowed from the khele, a kind of performance game or play-act- ing the young servants in Bombay engage in during their time off. The Academy actors sometimes portray characters and sometimes present themselves as performers as they unfold a political satire appropriate to today's India.2 Stepping in and out of the wall, which itself may serve as scenery, chorus members play many roles. The Sutradhar, or Narrator, drawn from ancient Sanskrit theatre, also alternates between standing outside the action and entering into it. The Marathi-speaking company, drawn from fields as diverse as medicine, engineering, and business, con- ducts seminars and workshops promoting experimental theatre using In- dian and Western forms. Language provided no barrier at all for the Grupo Contadores de Estor- ias of Brazil. Puppeteers Rachel Ribas and Marcos Gaetano Ribas present- ed two wordless pieces drawn from Brazilian folk life, Indian lore, and contemporary life using foot-high, doll-like puppets manipulated directly without strings or rods. Pas de Deux is a play of urban life, and Mansa- mente ("softly," "smoothly," or "gently") tells three stories about Brazi- lian Indians and peasants.</page><page sequence="12">Reports 113 Set to Brazilian flute music, Mansamente first depicts the solitary life and death of a peasant couple as they farm their small piece of land (plate io). The second story is about the adventures of an Indian boy who changes places with a squirrel he chases up a tree. In the third tale, a young Indian couple from a tribe made extinct by syphilis caught from Europeans, enjoy life and make love in consonance with nature. The Ri- bases, dressed in black from head to toe, gently and gracefully manipulate the puppets. In the meticulously set scene, lit from floor level as the pup- peteers loom in the shadows, the puppet characters go about their various activities-tilling the soil, climbing a tree, flying, making love-as if they were in a dream. No word is spoken. The only sounds are the haunting music and the occasional squawk of a bird, which heightens the dreamlike quality of the performances. Even the Ribases seem to sense this: at the end they quietly leave the Amazonian lovers so as not to disturb them. Pantomimist Bolek Polivka's TheJester and the Queen is a different kind of dream world (plate ii). Combining the sensibilities of Stanislavski, Brecht, Marceau, Bill Irwin, and Doug Henning with a slightly bleak outlook and large measures of humor and personal charm, Polivka de- picts the life of a clown in service to a queen who requires him to make her laugh whenever she commands. In this exploration of the relation of art and power, Polivka, who can perform in English as well as a number of other languages with equal ease, makes points about theatre, directors, l o.

He shows us how his magic works, particularly a won- derful flying bit done with a mirror, and explains why he does certain things before he does them. These revelations do not diminish the way his material delights and even stuns the audience. In another example of virtuoso solo work, San Franciscan Fred Cur- chack premiered his Inqruest r Freddy Chickan at Theatre of Nations. In what he bills "A Sci-Fi, Horror, Romance, Mystery, Musical, Comedy, Improv...," Curchack played all the characters in a search for popular TV comedian Freddy Chickan, who has mysteriously disappeared. The performance actually begins in the lobby as Curchack, in the guise of a hard-bitten New York detective, baits and rails at the audience. He fre- quently returns to the audience for his comedy, which often fell flat at the opening performance, and even directly confronted the camera team from Maryland Public Broadcasting covering the performance. Using masks, wigs, recorded and electronically enhanced voices (his own), and some unusual lighting and shadow effects, Curchack becomes, among others, the detective, Freddy's lover, his agent, a space visitor, and, of course, Freddy Chickan himself (plate 12).</page><page sequence="15">I6 Reports Most striking in the go-minute performance is Curchack's use of light and shadow. When he retreats behind a white curtain to transform into one of the characters, he has an uncanny way of manipulating the shadow of himself changing costume that gives it a life independent of the artist. He uses floor-level electric lights, candles, and even a flashlight to create some bizarre shadow-and-light effects that include flashes, flares, and floating bodies. We in America need to sponsor more international festivals like the Theatre of Nations. It's an education none of us should deny ourselves- or our fellow artists. As Arnoult sees it, "This gathering [. . .] will change the face of world theater" (Rousuck I986:3C). In an article in the Baltimore City Paper, David Bergman sums up the event by quoting Per- cy Shelley: "'Poets,' by which he meant all artists, 'are the unacknow- ledged legislators of the world.' For two weeks in June they were making new laws in Baltimore" (Bergman g986:n.p.).3 Notes i. This and all other unattributed statements were made in interviews and conver- sations with the author during the festival. 2. The appropriateness of Ghashiram Kotwal to other societies as well as contempo- rary India was demonstrated by an anecdote told by Mohan Agashe. When the Academy performed the play in one European city, they were required to preface the production with a disclaimer that the characters were fictional. In- stantly, the audience assumed that the play related to local current events and began searching for the keys to the "true" identities of the Indian characters. 3.
