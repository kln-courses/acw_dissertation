The poem's images, while striking, are by no means rare in the political discourse of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century France. Indeed, the student of political ephemera of the period may be intrigued by the frequency with which authors hurled the epithet sangsue [leech] at their foes.

The role of sangsue can be usefully presented in terms of semi- otics, since the word always appeared as part of a text designed to alter its audience's perception of social or political relations, and thus the nature of those relations, in the way the text's author desired.' Sang- sue functioned as an iconic symbol, evoking images whose associations resonated with readers' deep-seated fears, turning those fears against those whom the author wanted to portray as outsiders dangerous to the true community of France.2 A single word became a powerful weapon. Those who wielded it contributed to the formation of French national consciousness, which began to coalesce during the period in question. By labeling their enemies as greedy and dangerous blood- suckers, they not only excluded them from the community of France as they conceived it, but also cast them as demonic exploiters inspired by Satan to destroy France by draining its economic resources. This image of the fearsome alien became a sort of photographic negative of what the good French person, the vrai regnicole, was to be.3 Furthermore, sangsue fed fear and hostility toward outsiders, both epitomizing and increasing the xenophobia that so marked the period that began with the regime of Catherine de Medicis and ended with the rule of Cardinal Mazarin. While this early modern xenophobia had a different economic base from the anti-immigrant views so popular with today's French Far Right, both movements were shaped by the fear of economic exploitation.4 It is that fear, among others, that this essay seeks to probe through its examination of the metaphor of the sangsue. The distant origins of that metaphor lie in the dichotomous world view that typified early modern thinking. "There is nothing in the uni- verse that does not have its contrary," wrote Francisco Suarez, "and there would be no universe unless all things were contraries, nor is the universe preserved more by good than by evil, nor by any other contrary."5 The pairs of opposites that made up creation existed in a state of balanced tension and hostility; divine power reconciled them and kept either side from overmastering the other.

The strife between opposed groups and interests generated the human need for rulers. Their power, derived from and analogous to God's, promoted harmony and held conflict in check, creating the order without which no one could survive. Dis- order clearly came from Satan.6 Any kind of upheaval in Christian society could be traced to the devil and his minions. As I have already noted, French society had more than its share of upheavals during this period. The wars of religion and the subsequent assassination of Henri IV and turbulent regency of Marie de Medicis gave way at last to the somewhat more stable regime of Louis XIII and Cardinal Richelieu. Their achievements were almost destroyed, however, by the widespread resistance to Mazarin that culminated in the Fronde. All these conflicts were accompanied by debate over what it meant to be French, the relation of the monarchy to the French polity, the role religion was to play in French nationality, and what part foreigners might take in French affairs, whether economic or politi- cal. Most parties to such disputations offered sophisticated treatises that supported their views with considerable Renaissance learning and, naturally, framed their arguments in terms of contraries: "our" side as that of the real France and true Christianity, with Satan and his agents leading the enemy in a last-ditch effort to overthrow the divinely or- dained order of the state and dissolve France into chaos. When polemicists wanted to appeal to a larger audience than the elites of court, university, and parlement, they had to make the same points in terms understandable to those who lacked the benefits of humanist education. Preaching with Biblical examples was one way to do this, and, indeed, sermons were a very effective weapon in urban areas. Ideologues found another useful tool in the simpler forms of printed material: affiches-posters plastered on the walls of buildings, where literate passersby could interpret them for other pedestrians- as well as pamphlets that could not only be read aloud but also easily passed from hand to hand. Those who composed such materials drew on a stock of images and metaphors that they thought their audience 6 Clark, Thinking with Demons, 72. 7 On the audience for pamphlets during the religious wars, see Denis Pallier, Recherches sur l'imprimerie d Paris pendant la Ligue (Geneva, 1975), 188-91; Jacqueline Boucher, "Culture des notables et mentalite populaire dans la propagande qui entraina la chute de Henri III," in Mou- vements populaires et conscience sociale, XVIe-X[Xe siecles, ed.

Many came from the Bible, but the pamphleteers employed other common images as well. The metaphor of the sangsue, as we will see, invoked the widespread fear of witches, thus acquiring connotations that gave it the power to change minds. Sangsue seems to have been a somewhat ambiguous word in the late sixteenth century. Leeches in themselves must have been familiar (and repulsive) to most people in early modern France due to the car- nivorous worms' widespread use for bleeding in medicine. And, while physicians thought the practice beneficial, less prejudiced observers may well have noted how often patients died after leeches were ap- plied. Even the word's precise meaning was thus likely to bring an un- pleasant picture to the reader's mind. Yet the connotations of sangsue, derived from sang [blood] and sucer [to suck], would have evoked even darker shadows and still more horrible creatures. We might call these monsters vampires, but this would involve an anachronism, at least by implication. While tales and images of Vlad the Impaler, the Wallachian prince thought to be the original Dracula, enjoyed considerable popularity in western Europe during the six- teenth century, they never called him a revenant (one returned from the dead) or claimed that he drank the blood of his victims. And the crimes of history's only known "real" vampire, the Hungarian countess Elizabeth Bathory, were unknown to her contemporaries in the West. In the late 1500s, Bathory slaughtered more than sixty young girls and drank their blood, believing it would restore her youth. But though it tried and imprisoned her, the Hapsburg government covered up the scandal, in deference to Bathory's highly placed family. The word "vampire" itself did not make its way from Serbo-Croatian into west- ern European languages until the very late seventeenth century.8 Early modern France had many stories of revenants, but they did not maintain their pseudolife by sucking the blood of others; rather, spells and charms kept them in motion, as in the 1588 account of a Paris sorcerer who reanimated the corpse of a hanged criminal to ask it the location of hidden treasure. The corpse's statements were vague, and the sorcerer allowed it to lapse back into decay.9 So, rather than importing monsters from eastern Europe, the writ- ers who evoked the sangsue fashioned their image from native beliefs very familiar, and seemingly credible, to most sections of their audi- 8 Gabriel Ronay, The Truth about Dracula (New York, 1972), 68-83, 93-137, 15. 9 Nicolas Remy, Demonolatreiae libri tres . . . , trans.

Almost all their readers would have agreed that Christian society was engaged in a combat even more terrible, and more crucial, than that of Christians against each other; indeed, the two struggles over- lapped. This other war pitted the devil and his sworn minions against the company of believers; the adherents of Satan sought to spread destruction and disorder throughout Christian society. They might be labeled Catholic or Calvinist, politique or foreign, depending on the writer's point of view, but all controversialists could, and upon occasion did, call their opponents witches. It was this conflation of religious, political, and national differences with the demonic danger posed by witches that the image of the bloodsucker called up. Although medical bleeding by use of leeches was, in and of itself, an unnerving process that might result in the patient's death, by the sixteenth century blood had acquired additional medical associations. The ingestion of blood, often by sucking, seemed a possible remedy for weakness and the debilitations of old age. In 1489, for instance, the physician-philosopher Marsilio Ficino asked, "What is wrong with our giving this drink of blood if it will restore people who are half- dead with age? It is a common and an ancient opinion that certain old women who were fortune tellers (which we call witches) used to suck the blood of infants and children and become rejuvenated from it. Why, then, not have our own old people who have no other hope, suck the blood of an adolescent-of a willing adolescent, I mean?" Ficino went on to advise, "Let them suck, then, like a leech -that is, a blood- sucker-from a slightly-opened vein in the skinny part of the arm, an ounce or two."' 0 Blood became a remedy for another sort of debilita- tion in the folk medicine of early modern Germany and Scandinavia. Executioners in these areas treated wounds and broken bones; they also sold body parts from those they put to death. While human fat was their most desired commodity, they offered blood as a cure for epi- lepsy. Since it was thought to work best when fresh, epileptics stood be- neath the scaffold at beheadings, hoping to catch the elixir while it was still warm from the body of the executed." While this does not guaran- tee the same practice in France, it does suggest a widespread belief in the restorative power of blood in all segments of early modern society. The theory that justified such attitudes becomes clearer from a 10 Marsilio Ficino, The Book of Life, trans.

Levinus Lennius wrote, "This aliment of life, . . . with the impulse of the vital spirit that is the sustenance and vehicle of our native heat, being diffused along the brooks and roads of the arteries and veins, to every part, nourishes and quickens the body." 12 Blood was the carrier of the life force. In this light, the emerging belief that witches sucked blood made complete sense. It likewise shows why the blood witches sucked was often -though not always -that of infants and young children. As Ficino indicated, the witch was a predator who restored his or her vitality by stealing it from those who had the most of it to lose.'3 Humanist scholarship's translations from ancient sources added to the witch-bloodsucker association as they made more widely avail- able Roman descriptions of the witches called strigae [monsters who ate their victims' flesh and drank or sucked their blood]. Those descrip- tions drew the attention of those engaged in the contemporary debate over the nature and extent of witchcraft. For instance, in 1570, the Swiss Protestant divine Ludwig Lavater wrote that "lamiae were sup- posed of the auncient people to be women having eyes to put in or take out at their pleasure, or, rather, certain shapes of divils which, takeing on the shew of beautiful women devoured children and young men allured unto them with sweet enticements. Lamiae are also called striges. Striges (as they say) are unluckie birds, which sucke out the blood of infants lying in their cradles." 14 The classical connotations of sangsue show up in political writing, the word frequently being coupled with "harpy," as in "bloodsuckers and harpies of the court," or "foreign bloodsuckers and harpies," phrases typical of this kind of discourse. The image of the witch as bloodsucker did not appear in the great- est German witch treatise, the Malleus Mali/icarum of Heinrich Kramer and James Sprenger. Whether a genuine survival from ancient times or a scholarly adaptation of classical texts to a new situation, it first came to light in Savoy around 1450 and moved from there to Italy and Spain.15 Its appearance in Savoy seems significant, for modern schol- 12 Levinus Lennius, Della complessione del corpo humano (Venice, 1564), 70r. 13 In a more prosaic vein, it seems likely that the belief in witch attacks on babies and young children accounted for deaths caused by the mother, whether accidentally or otherwise, as the anthropologist Hugo Nutini has shown in modern Tlaxcala, Mexico.

In any case, belief in the witch as bloodsucker had spread to Italy by 1470, when Giordano da Bergamo wrote, 'Again, the demon either deludes the striae or actually transports them from place to place, as he is able to do, and uses them to perpetrate evil, carrying them into houses where they fascinate children and suck their blood." 17 Italians were still re- peating the story as late as 1703, when the inquisitor Anselmo Dandini reiterated that "MalJi ci . . . suck the blood of children, especially the unbaptized, which they believe rejuvenates them in their old age." 18 Since witch treatises, either written in Latin or rapidly trans- lated, circulated internationally, French witch-hunters could easily have picked up the bloodsucking theme from their Italian colleagues. Whatever the source, it had become a feature of French demonology by the second half of the sixteenth century, when the French perse- cutions became most intense. Those Gallic scholars of witchcraft who did not specifically claim that witches drank or sucked blood implied it through their insistence on the witches' taste for human flesh. Jean Bodin's Demonomanie des sorciers (1580) undoubtedly played a major role in establishing the mental association between witches and the metaphorical bloodsuckers of contemporary political writing. A magistrate and political philosopher, Bodin staunchly opposed the disorder and destruction of his time by his advocacy of strong monar- chy, but he also worked against the Satanic agents who were mounting an even more insidious attack on the good order of human society. His witchcraft treatise sparked a period of very intense witch-hunts in France; since he was also an important political thinker his beliefs about blood drinking among witches, and his use of the sangsue meta- phor, are of some consequence for this inquiry. Nowhere in the Demonomanie does Bodin claim that witches are bloodsuckers or drinkers, but he does comment several times on their appetite for human flesh. In tracing the history of the supposed witch cult, he insisted, 'As for eating human flesh, that is very certain, and in ancient times witches were so greedy for it that it was almost impossible to protect dead bodies, or to seal them up so well that witches could not enter to gnaw them to the bone." Bodin believed that contem- 16 Carlos Ginzburg, "Deciphering the Sabbath," in Ankarloo and Henningsen, Early Mod- ern European Witchcraft, 132. 17 Giordano da Bergamo, Quaestio de strigibus, in Lea, Materials, 2:302. 18 Anselmo Dandini, De suspectis de haeresi, in Lea, Materials, 2:1036.</page><page sequence="8">358 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES porary witches carried on this ancient tradition, relating that recently a Montpellier physician named Rondelet had laid in wait for a male witch whom he saw open the tomb of a young woman buried a day earlier, cut off a thigh, and carry it off, "biting eagerly into its flesh." 19 Consumption of flesh in this way would probably have encompassed the drinking of blood in the mind of a sixteenth-century Catholic, for it came at a time when, in resistance to the growing power of Calvinist doctrine, the French church emphasized the Tridentine teaching on the real presence of both the body and the blood of Christ in the Eu- charistic bread.20 As French descriptions of the sabbat made it more and more a grotesque parody of the mass, the drinking of blood had to become part of the witches' ceremony of Satan worship, and so it appears in treatises written after Bodin's. In Lorraine, largely French in culture, if not yet in politics, the noted witch trial judge Nicolas Remy recorded in 1590 that "Nicolas Morele said that it [sabbat food] was so evil- tasting and bitter that he was compelled to spit it out at once, and when the wicked demon saw this, he was so angry he could hardly keep his hands off him. And for drink he gave them in a dirty little cup wine like clots of blood." 21 Here blood, the elixir of life in Christian worship and Christian medicine, has become instead an elixir of death, repug- nant even to Satan's duped followers. A few years after Remy's treatise, Pierre de Lancre combined the ceremonial and the vampiric consump- tion of blood in his account of witchcraft in the Labourd district in southwestern France. Readers must believe that the sins of witches are real and not illusions, he warned, "for when they confess infanticides, the parents find their children suffocated, or their blood all sucked out." But such secret attacks were not the only times when Satan's fol- lowers consumed blood. "Witches make it their task at the sabbat," de Lancre continued, "to kill children and then boil their innocent flesh until it liquefies and becomes drinkable. They drink their blood and then treat their flesh as I have said." 22 These and other writings suggest that in political invective to call someone a sangsue evoked not only the l9Jean Bodin, Dimonomanie des sorciers, 2d ed.

For the analogy to be complete, however, it also needed a victim upon whom the witch might batten, a body whose life he or she might steal. Two such victims can be found in the pamphlets. One is a col- lectivity, the "poor people," whose resources the bloodsucker drained. The other is France itself. Neither seems a precise parallel for the re- puted victims of witches, since the witch almost always stole the blood of babies or young children, but some similarities can be found. The masses of French regnicoles were often portrayed as childlike in relation to the king, who was saluted as "the father of his people." And they were certainly no more able to defend themselves from exploitation than an infant would be -at least in the opinions of the educated elite, a group to which pamphlet writers generally belonged. The personified France fit the metaphor in another fashion. Lik- ening the relation among different sections of a political society to that of the various interdependent parts of the human body dates back at least to Aristotle, so that by the late sixteenth century, the Catholic pamphlet writer Louis Le Roy could justly comment that "it is in no way a new analogy to compare a state to a human body, but rather one practiced by Holy Scripture, the ancient poets themselves, and all good writers."23 The French twist to this trope, beginning in the later stages of the Hundred Years' War, portrayed the motherland as a beautiful, queenly woman, but one weakened and distressed by the assaults of outsiders.24 By the mid-sixteenth century, France faced dan- gers even worse than foreign invasion, namely, the treachery of her own children. Such, at least, was the opinion of Pierre de Ronsard, who portrayed the situation in his Continuation du discours des miseres de ce temps (1562). The poet sees in a vision "l'idole de la France," who seems like a woman sick to the point of death. She bitterly complains that poisons brewed in Geneva have laid her waste, just as caterpillars, if not destroyed before they spread, devour the fruit of the orchard and the grain in the field. Now, she continues, My mutinous people, arrogant, liars, Have broken my right arm by driving out my Senators, For they have banished justice from my royal palaces, 23 Louis Le Roy, Rtplique pour le catholique anglois contre le catholique associe des Huguenots (1588), 6. 24 On France as woman, see Colette Beaune, The Birth of an Ideology: Myths and Symbols of Nation in Late Medieval France (Berkeley, Calif., 1991), 290-92.</page><page sequence="10">360 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES For fear law should correct their vices; They have torn my robe by tearing up my cities Pulled out my hair by pillaging my churches.25 Writing two decades after Ronsard, the Protestant poet and future historian Theodore-Agrippa d'Aubigne painted an even more graphic image of the attack on Mother France. He showed France as the mother of twin infant sons, both of whom she wishes to nurse. But each of the children, greedily eager to deny nourishment to his brother, bites and tears the breast she offers, setting up a "combat whose field is the mother." DAubigne closed the scene in Les Tragiques by having the mother fling both boys away, cursing them "to live on venom, my mur- derous offspring, for I have no more blood to feed you!"26 The poet used the horrible image of a child so eager to destroy its sibling that it would lay waste the very breasts that offer them both life and suckle blood instead of milk. The reader naturally responds with horror and revulsion. That is the real point of the bloodsucker metaphor. Whether those who read or heard it understood it to signify leech, witch, or monster child, sangsue always designated an alien and unnatural preda- tor, someone whom the reader was to fear and try to drive away. A tighter focus on the referent of blood in the context of the metaphor of political body as human body will show the exact nature of the danger posed by the bloodsucker. If the life force of individu- als lay in their blood, the life force of the state lay in another mobile, nourishing substance, gold and silver coinage. The 1484 cahier submit- ted by the Estates General to King Charles VIII made the statement explicitly: "Money is in the body politic what blood is in the human body." In similar fashion, a Third Estate delegate to the 1589 Estates General of Blois pleaded for a reduction in governmental exactions. "This concerns blood that is neither lost nor expended. It has only re- treated into a single part of the body, from which it is necessary to take it and replace it in the empty veins to revive the head and animate the most noble parts of the body."27 There is a strong suggestion here of the consistent, long-term identification of the movement of blood in the human body with the circulation of money in the national econ- 25 Pierre de Ronsard, Continuation du discours des miseres de ce temps, in (Euvres completes, ed.

One is as necessary to the vitality of the state as the other is to the maintenance of physical life and health. The equivalence of blood with money points to the real identity and function of the leech/bloodsucker/witch in the sangsue metaphor. Just as the leech is a parasite and the witch an alien hostile to Christian society, the sangsue is an alien hostile to the community of France who becomes an economic parasite, wreaking such depredation of wealth as to threaten the continued life of the body's members. While the epi- thet would be flung about with abandon during the religious wars, as we shall see, its first and most consistent use was to label those out- siders so active in French political and economic life in the sixteenth century: the Italians. Migration from northern Italy into southern France stretched far back into the Middle Ages, and the kings of France had employed Italian bankers for nearly that long. However, French involvement in the Italian wars of the first half of the sixteenth century provoked a flood of noble and professional immigrants who sought a share in the relative peace and prosperity of the northern kingdom. The immigra- tion peaked between 1540 and 1560, dropping off sharply after 1570 and slowing to the merest of trickles by the late seventeenth century.28 While not all these arriving Italians achieved great financial success, many did. Many others found positions at court during the regimes of Catherine and Marie de Medicis, and that of Mazarin. A few achieved positions of great power. Mazarin is of course the best example; dur- ing the sixteenth century we might mention especially the Gondi, Bi- rague, and Gonzaga dynasties. The Gonzagas, relatives of the ruling dynasty of Mantua, were accepted as members of the high nobility of France, while the Gondis and the Biragues achieved high ecclesiasti- cal and judicial office. Of the latter family, Rene de Birague served as Chancellor of France from 1573-83. All three families provided Queen Catherine de Medicis with her closest advisors and supporters. Such Italian success aroused envy, especially when the contracting French economy made similar prosperity harder for natives to achieve. Envy manifested itself as a virulent xenophobia strongly rooted in the artisan corporations of the cities but extending from there both up and down the social scale. The writers who employed the bloodsucker metaphor in their attacks sought to focus the hostility of their audience into a clear perception of Italians -and, by extension, all foreigners- as dangerous, and possibly Satanic, predators. Reaction to outsiders 28 Dubost, La France italienne, 26.</page><page sequence="12">362 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES should be the same as reaction to witches; the community (i.e., the motherland) had to be purged and purified of their presence. The lesson found receptive students. The popular hatred of Ital- ians broke into outright physical violence in the 1570s, most notably in Paris, but also in Marseilles, Lyons, and other cities housing large clusters of immigrants. And other foreigners joined the Italians as suitable objects of the community's wrath. Even as it sanctioned the widespread violence against French Protestants that followed the Saint Bartholomew's Day Massacre in 1572, the government of Charles IX tried to protect Englishmen, Germans, and other foreigners of doubt- ful Catholic orthodoxy. Violence against foreigners reached another crescendo in 1615, with the ritual murder and mutilation of Marie de Medicis's favorite, Concini, and again became endemic against Maza- rin's countrymen during the Fronde. It seems likely that the pamphlets helped to generate such actions through their demonization of the out- siders who seemed to be wallowing in the wealth that French natives so desperately lacked.29 Writers reserved particular hostility for those Italians who found positions in and around the royal court or in the structure of the gov- ernment. The standard scenario had the foreign "leeches" extracting all possible gain from their offices, sending the loot home, and then returning themselves to enjoy their riches in their native lands while the people of France starved. Jean Bodin offered a classic statement of the situation in his RNponse aux "Paradoxes" de Monsieur de Malestroit: "But while we keep the window open to the exiles bad air and dis- ease will always enter with them, and we will never lack for new taxes that suck the blood, gnaw the bone, and drain away the marrow of the prince and the people."30 In his great work of political theory, the Six livres de la RNpublique, Bodin offered a remedy for at least part of the problem. He suggested that foreigners should be denied the privi- lege of declaring bankruptcy in France, as they had been in ancient Rome. "Otherwise, the foreigners, to their advantage, could suck the blood and the marrow of subjects and then pay them off in slips of paper."31 This view of the foreigner as a dangerous economic preda- tor expressed itself easily in the bloodsucker metaphor, so that Bodin's phrasing was repeated again and again.

For example, in 1574 the diarist Pierre de l'Estoile recorded a sonnet titled "Against the Queen Mother and the Italians brought into the Government of the Kingdom." It begins, "Today Italy lords it over a France ground down by a yoke she suffers passively. The one increases her tribute, and the other, famished, greedly sucks out her blood and her substance." 33 The writer concludes by urging armed resistance to Italian depreda- tions, lest his audience be forced to migrate to some land less burdened with resident predators. Another indigant writer complained that "the Italians get first choice.... Benefits and gifts, positions and pensions, are for them alone."34 Chancellor Birague was an object of special opprobrium for the pamphlet writers, who charged him not simply with unscrupulous greed, but also with an Italian (Machiavellian) interference in those fundamental French laws of which he was the natural guardian. Bi- rague was saluted as "full of perfect and sublime ignorance in law and all letters, which does not stop him from being of an enduring and malicious shrewdness in planning new taxes, massacres, betrayals, and all other sorts of tyrannies."35 When, in 1578, Henri III put the royal seals, and thus most of the chancellor's authority, into other hands, the pamphlet writers rejoiced: Truly in this miserable time, God to us is loving and kind, Having drawn off Birague, Who was so consumed with thirst, That he sucked out all the blood of France.36 As my hypothesis about the connotations of sangsue would sug- gest, Italians were stigmatized not only as leeches on the French body politic, but also as witches. Italianate Savoy offered a focus for con- cern over sorcery exported to France. Early in the sixteenth century, the preacher Michel Menot claimed that the mountains of Savoy were very near to the suburbs of Hell.... It is said there are many sor- 32Jean Bacquet, Trois premiers traictez dejehan Bacquet ... 2d ed. (Paris, 1580), 45'. 33 Pierre de LEstoile, Registre-journal de regne de Henri III, ed.

Leonora Galigai, wife of the murdered Concini, was executed for witchcraft in 1617, for example. By Galigai's time, however, the pattern had already been set. Queen Catherine de Medicis had already become the quintessential figure of the Italian witch. Catherine played a distinctly minor role in her marriage, due to her lengthy failure to produce an heir and her husband's steadfast devotion to his scintillating mistress, Diane de Poitiers. She also stood in the shadows while her son Franc~ois II followed the guidance of his wife's uncles, the duc and cardinal de Guise. Franc~ois's early death in 1560 put Catherine at last to the fore and she remained one of France's most powerful figures until her demise in 1589. Her efforts to keep the peace and maintain power for her remaining sons made her unpopu- lar almost immediately, but her reputation did not reach its nadir until after the St. Bartholomew's Day Massacre in 1572. For the last seven- teen years of her life, Protestants and extreme Catholics despised the queen mother, and their polemic made her an atheist, a poisoner, and, finally, a witch. The foundation for much of the imagery was laid in the 1574 Dis- cours merveilleux de la vie, actions et deportements de Catherine de Medicis, Royne-mere. The author, whose identity is in dispute, attacked Catherine when she had been made vulnerable by the death of Charles IX that May and prior to Henri III's return from Poland in September. Cather- ine again served as regent, and the Discours represented that position as the culmination of a lifelong, vicious quest for power in the course of which she ruthlessly destroyed her brother-in-law, her son, and any- one else who stood in her way. The main text purports to simply re- late these and other misdeeds of a political and governmental nature; 37Joseph Nave, ed., Sermons choisis de Michel Menot (Paris, 1924), 312; Henri Boguet, An examen of witches. . . , ed.

The direct accusation is left to the two "letters" to Catherine appended to the Discours as early as 1575.40 After relating a series of misdeeds that would certainly become a devotee of Satan, the writer of the second added, almost as an afterthought, "Also, Madame, they tell me that you allow and even invite atheism to be preached in several places about the court, and that when the blind man who was both priest and sorcerer was burned at Paris, he confessed before the principal officers who were interrogating him that you, Madame, were the first enrolled of all his legion, clearly that group of which he was colonel general in the absence of Satan." 41 The author never claimed that Catherine drank blood, but he hardly needed to do so. The entire burden of the Discours was that Catherine was a danger- ous foreigner prepared to destroy France in her thirst for power, and that was the message the bloodsucker metaphor conveyed. To claim any more would have gilded the (poisonous) lily. And, as we shall see, Catherine's supposed demonic associations would be passed on to her son, Henri III, who was to become the predatory alien sorcerer of a new definition of the French community: the Catholic Holy League. So far we have investigated the possible origins of the bloodsucker metaphor as it appeared in the antiforeign polemic of the second half of the sixteenth century. As originally used, the metaphor demon- ized foreigners in general, but most especially the high-ranking Ital- ian courtiers and bankers whose success seemed to result from their economic depredations on the French government and people. It por- trayed them as monstrous leeches, draining away the resources France needed to survive. I have suggested that the image of the bloodsucker witch became one of the metaphor's connotations, thus drawing on a range of fears associated with the general belief that blood was a sort of elixir of life for the body, just as the Eucharistic blood was an elixir of life for the soul. The witch parallel hinted that foreigners, espe- cially the sophisticated and devious Italians, however assimilated they might seem, remained outsiders who might work harm to France in ways not immediately discernable. They should be treated as witches were-driven from the community at least, destroyed at most. And, indeed, physical attacks on individual Italians were increasingly com- mon, while riots menaced the larger communities of immigrants in the 1570s and 1580s. 40 Discours merveilleux de la vie, actions et deportements de Catherine de Medicis, Royne-mere, .ed.

In these debates, the metaphor, no longer simply labeling outsiders and evoking images to show why they should be feared, became a tool of exclusion, indicating those whom the writer wished to persuade his readers could never be part of that true France upon which the outsiders were parasites. The bloodsucking witch -an alien, after all, in any Christian community42 was a leitmotif in the debate over which was the true Christianity, as well as the one over how the true France should be constituted. Was France to be defined by religious belief, loyalty to the Crown, or some other standard? In this contest, the bloodsucker label could contribute to a king's exclu- sion or destruction. I will conclude by considering the implications of the metaphor for future French economic and political attitudes. Royalist and Huguenot writers found it easy enough to transfer the taint of exploitative foreigner from Italians like the queen mother to the arch-Catholic Guise family, which had emigrated from Lorraine only a generation earlier. Thus the 1560 Supplication et remonstrance au roy de Navarre et autres Princes du sang pour la deliverance du Roy et du Royaume calls them "these wretched offshoots of a foreign dynasty, who would not live today in the splendor to which they have raised them- selves were it not for the marrow they have drawn from our poor bones, and the blood they have sucked from our veins."43 In the same fash- ion, a Protestant partisan responded indignantly to the accusations of attempted royal assassination that followed the revelation of the con- spiracy of Amboise: "But why would we have wanted to do it? What would these 'young and innocent princes,' as they label them in their letters, have been able to have done [to us]? We know well that the king has no knowledge at all of the oppression of his people, unsupportable as it is, and we do not blame it on anyone but these two greedy blood- suckers."44 In the mental world these writers created, the activities of Guises strongly resemble those of witches. They tear open the body of France, just as witches tear open the bodies of their victims, and for the same purpose: they suck out France's life to enhance their own. Meanwhile, in an ironic role reversal, the young king is as unaware of Mother France's peril as the parents who awake to find their children corpses in their cradles, their blood all sucked out. 42 On the witch as alien, see Robin Briggs, Witches and Neighbors: The Social and Cultural Con- text of European Witchcraft (New York, 1996), 324-25. 43 Louis de Bourbon, Prince de Cond6, ed., Me'moires de Conde, servant declaircissement et de preuve d l'histoire de M. de Thou (Paris and London, 1745), 493. 44 Amateurs du bien publique, "Brieve exposition des lettres du Cardinal de Lorraine en- voyees au nom du Roy aux cours de Parlement du dernier de mars, 1560," in ibid., 356.</page><page sequence="17">LEECHES ON THE BODY POLITIC 367 Such dark shadows in Protestant pamphlet portraits of the Guises grew deeper after the Saint Bartholomew's Day massacre. The tombeau with which I began this essay demonstrates the evolution of the blood- sucker image as a part of this process. I think there can be no question of the medical leech as a referent here. The bloodsucker has become an irrevocably monstrous figure; if not a witch, then the next worst thing. And yet the metaphor's original economic implications seem to be still present. The poet's allusions to "innocent blood" doubtless recall the literal massacre of Protestants, but the suggestion that the cardinal had drawn undue profit from his many offices was also part of the complex of ideas on which the writer drew. From that perspec- tive, the cardinal was an economic vampire who sucked out the blood of the corporate Body of Christ. Twenty years after this attack on the memory of the first Guise cardinal, another satirist took aim at that of the second, his nephew. The image evoked is a portrait, one of those honoring the heroes of the Holy League that hang in the staircase leading to the assembly hall of the Estates in the Satyre Menip&amp;e. "The other," its description runs, "was vested in a red soutane, with a cuirass over it, and a hat of the same color with long ribbons. He had in his hand a cup of blood from which he seemed to want to drink, and from his mouth came a scroll bearing these words: 'Keep your helmets on, polish your lances, and put on your breastplates.' "45 The image of the cardinal is satanic as he urges his disciples to be ready to exterminate their enemies, and his cup of blood resembles the beverage of the sabbat feast. A later speech from the same work likewise recalls the sabbat. The speaker, who represents the Third Estate, dismisses the surviv- ing Guises and their plan to put a Spanish princess on the throne of France. "Come now, messieurs of Lorraine, with your daughter of princes! We hold you for false visions of protection, suckers of the blood of the princes of France, false jewels, ships blown off course, relics of saints with neither strength nor virtue."46 False visions, lost ships, sacred objects with their power annihilated-all these were typi- cal of the work of witches gathered at the sabbat. The Guises thus seem to be portrayed here as witches who bring a spell of sterility to the land, a spell all good Frenchmen and women should repudiate with horror. Yet if the Guises fit one stereotype of the bloodsucking witch, that of the alien predator, their supporters could project an even worse one upon their Calvinist enemies. Surely the church of Geneva, blasphe- 45 Satyre Menip&amp;e de la vertu du Catholicon d'Espagne et de la tenue des Estatz de Paris, ed.

In the Catholic pamphlets, therefore, there emerged a loose equivalence between Protestantism and the witch cult, as shown by Ronsard's assertion, through the per- sona of Mother France, that the homeland was being eaten up by pests broadcast from Geneva. The reader needed to take only a short men- tal step from the poet's metaphor to the destruction of crops so often ascribed to the group action of witches at the sabbat.47 Ronsard might even have intended his figure of speech to be understood in this way, since the rumor that the heretics of Geneva were witches was circulating in France at the time he wrote. Indeed, the devil himself admitted as much. For instance, the possession and exorcism of Nicole Obry, an adolescent resident of Laon, attracted much public attention in 1566-67. Her devil, Beelzebub, boasted that he was a leader of the Huguenots and proclaimed that Geneva hosted a multitude of other demons.48 We might recall in this context that Savoy, to which Geneva first belonged, probably was the sabbat myth's point of origin; in the sixteenth century French demonologists cer- tainly believed it a hotbed of demonic activities. Satan's incursion into Geneva must have seemed almost inevitable to French Catholic ob- servers. Logically, then, Catholic pamphleteers should have credited Huguenots with bloodsucking and other witchly crimes. Such stories do seem to have circulated as gossip, though my research has as yet produced little evidence of them in the pamphlets.49 Perhaps the de- monic inspiration of Protestants needed no emphasizing in the minds of traditionalist Catholics. As France's civil wars continued, however, the bloodsucker meta- phor did surface in the pamphlets of the Holy League. Its propagan- dists turned the accusation against the king they believed had betrayed them. Henri III's supposed involvement with witchcraft and his equally suppositious support of Protestants made two sides of the same coin; both entailed rejection of the "one law, one faith" of French tradition. Far from acting as the head of the body politic, Henri, like his mother, had become a murderous parasite upon it. 47 On witches and crop blighting, see Briggs, Witches and Neighbors, 40-41. 48 On the Obry case, see Bodin, Demonomanie, 86'; Francesco Maria Guazzo, Compendium maleficorum, ed.

Many of Henri's appointments seemed to be Italians-at least to contemporary eyes-with the result that the general xenophobia became enmeshed in a long-standing dis- gust with the court and its corrupt practices. Thus in 1578 Edmond de Panygrolles reported the complaints of the Estates of Normandy, which included "the great number of officiers, which they begged his Majesty to reduce . . . without the said officiers being reimbursed, or continued in their wages, seeing that such people did not take their posts for the sake of the public utility, much less for the King's service, but solely as bloodsuckers, to draw out the pure blood of his poor vassals, especially through the offices set up since the death of the late king, his father." 50 Henri appeared to take such complaints to heart, but a desper- ate need for money to pursue the war against the Protestants pushed him back into the sale of offices. The Catholic pamphlets portrayed his behavior in the worst possible light, and the disapproval seems to have become general. The diarist Pierre de L'Estoile condemned it, noting inJuly 1582 that the king, acting on the advice of his confessor, announced he would no longer sell judgeships, but would instead ap- point "men capable, learned, expert, and of good life." But a short time later, "at the desire of his mignons and the other harpies and blood- suckers of the court and his council," Henri reneged on his promise and sold more positions than before.5' As the king lost support, especially in Paris, hostility to his ser- vants passed from formal complaint to direct action. In April 1587, a young Paris merchant named Foeillet burst into the palace to ha- rangue the king. L'Estoile reported that Foeillet told his monarch that "the greater part of those who had his ear were no more than thieves and brigands, and that they were the cause of the ruin of his poor people and of his state because every day they had new taxes imposed in whose profit they shared . .. and these were true bloodsuckers and cutthroats to the people, and it was necessary to hang them all."52 The king, to his credit, treated Foeillet as insane and thus not re- sponsible for his words. He sent him home to his family for care, but, perhaps understandably, failed to act on his advice. The incident gave a little more weight to the growing conviction among ardent Catholics that the depredations of the king's servants took place with his support 50 Copie d'une lettre escrite par Edmond de Panygrolles, Escuyer, d un seigneur de Bourgogne, in Ar- chives curieuses de ihistoire deFrance, ed.

A month after the incident L'Estoile recorded a direct assault on the staff of the royal finance minister: "On Monday, 16 May, because the royalists, namely those who had been advanced and en- riched in the service of the king, were hated and hunted down by the Parisians, who said-as was indeed the truth-that they were fat and full of the blood of the people, the sieur de Chenailles's people were stopped, searched, harassed, and injured by the bourgeois who were -guarding the gate."53 The image here is of swollen leeches, gorged on the blood of the patient who has become their victim. Thus, by 1588, royal officials provoked the same kind of im- promptu retaliatory attacks often visited upon suspected witches -and which, a decade before, had begun to target Italians as well. Hos- tile attitudes toward other denizens of the court had started to grow much earlier. France had a tradition of anticourt polemic, but the one directed toward Henri III's household was particularly pointed. Though married, and by all appearances attached to his wife, Henri also displayed what seemed inordinate fondness for the coterie of male companions universally known as his mignons. The term, while de- noting simply a confidential servant, as did the English minion, could be understood to carry sexual overtones.54 "Unnatural" sexuality was, of course, another feature of the sabbat myth, and it was understood as well to be common among Italians. The rumors about the mignons thus tied the half-Italian king both to the xenophobic and to the de- monic images expressed in the metaphor of the sangsue, and this almost from the beginning of his reign. Like Italians, and like witches, Henri's mignons were predators, at least to the authors of Catholic propaganda, since the king's lavish gifts to them drained the French people's finan- cial lifeblood. In the spring of 1583, L'Estoile recorded a satiric verse that be- trayed the growing distrust of the king's favorites. I have left it in French, since no English I could construct quite caught the sheer nas- tiness of the word play. The title, "La procession de Jeudi Saincte," refers to the King's habit of alternating periods of intense religious ob- servance-even to the point of penitential flagellation-with episodes of equally intense reckless merriment and partying. 53 Ibid., 3:152. 54 Dessaliens, V3r. The homosexual overtones are suggested by the title of a 1588 pam- phlet directed against Henri's close friend the duc d'Espernon: Histoire tragique et mdmorable de Pierre de Gaveston, gentil homme gascon, jadis le mignon d'Edouard 2, Roy dAngleterre, DMdije d M. le duc d'Espernon. Gaveston was well known to have been Edward's lover and a principle cause of the failure of his reign.</page><page sequence="21">LEECHES ON THE BODY POLITIC 371 Mignons qui portez doucement En croupe le sang de la France, Ne battez le dos seulement, Mais le Q qui a fait l'offense.55 The "Q" here refers not simply to the Marquis de Quelus, the current particular favorite of the king, but also to queue [tail], a slang term for the penis. The reference to sexual depravity is clear enough, though its exact nature may not be. Even clearer is the image of the mignons as gorgeous birds of prey, their crops filled with the blood of their victims. Indeed, until the execution of the Guise brothers late in 1588, Catholic pamphlets usually blamed not the king but the entourage that had led him into evil ways. It was they, therefore, who were the true bloodsuckers or leeches. The author of the 1588 RNponcefaicte par un Religieux de Feullars a la lettre que son pare lui avoit escrite pour le retirer de Religion did not hesitate to point this out several times. The outward plot of the pamphlet concerns a father's attempts to persuade his son, a monk, to leave his monastery and take up one of the several careers he had supposedly described in a previous letter. The pamphlet itself is the son's reply, showing why none of his father's proposals could pos- sibly appeal to a man who wishes to live virtuously. He is particularly scathing on the subjects of careers in government and as a courtier. "But on what do these courtiers live," he asks, "if not the pure blood of the people? Have they revenues more certain than those that come back to them from Edicts, subsidies, creations of offices, and other such practices? These are men who, at the expense of their master's honor, grind down the people and hold them to ransom, burden them and oppress them with thousands of devices for getting money, and what is worse, do not do so to make their master richer in any way. On the contrary, he grows poorer daily, while they alone have the wealth of king and people alike." The religieux went on to criticize "the terrible greed of these leeches of the court" and to warn that "history teaches us that several emperors made themselves odious to the people by means of the bloodsuckers in their entourage."56 The implied warning to the king is clear. He heard the same sorts of remarks from delegates speaking for the Holy League during the crucial Estates of Blois in late 1588 and early 1589. Monsieur Bernard, delivering the complaints of the Third 55 LEstoile, "La procession dejeudi Saincte," in Mgmoires-journaux, 2:113.

Henri seemed to be slipping from his divinely appointed position as balance point in the opposition of good and evil in human society. He would fall to the left, the sinister side. Another series of pamphlets appearing in the crucial last months of 1588 directly tied the king's circle of friends to Satanic practices. It began in July with the Histoire tragique et memorable de Pierre de Gaveston, gentil homme gascon, jadis le mignon de Edouard 2, Roy dAngleterre, Dedie'e d Monseigneur le duc d'Espernon, probably written by the Holy League preacherJean Boucher. Espernon had replaced Quelus, dead in a duel, as the king's chief favorite and thus the chief object of Holy League attack. The very title implied dark doings, since Gaveston was gen- erally considered to have been King Edward's lover, but an epistre to Espernon that preceded the text was unabashedly blunt. Its probable author, Philippe Desportes, had been one of the king's favorite poets, and may have blamed Espernon for the failure of his expectations of royal rewards.58 If so, he vented his spleen freely, accusing the duke of casting spells on the king, thereby ruining his kingdom. "For since the time that bloodsucker mignons like you have enchanted our kings, their liberalities-or, to put it better, their unbridled prodigalities- have been nothing but the burden and oppression of the poor subjects of the kingdom." 59 The indignant Espernon published a rebuttal, only to find him- self slapped with an even less pleasant response. Boucher, an eloquent orator with a talent for vituperation, had been somewhat restrained in the first pamphlet. Now he blasted the duke as a witch and worshipper of Satan, "having taken for your subject the study of magic and necro- mancy, of which science the first precepts are to renounce Jesus Christ and adore the devil and to promise to do the worst one can to the for- tunes of good Christians."60 Suspicions that the king himself had become a witch grew after 57 Harangue ... par Monsieur Bernard, esleu pour le Tiers-Estat deFrance, 25. 58Jean Boucher, RNplique d l'antigaveston ou responce faicte d l'histoire de Gaveston par le duc d'Espernon (Paris, 1588), 373. 59 Histoire tragique et memorable ...

Writers and preachers for the Holy League made much of the discovery, in an abandoned oratory in the royal forest of Vincennes, of two candlesticks in the shape -they said -of devils. Presumably, these were intended to hold black candles of the sort witches presented to Satan at the sabbat. Perhaps the king had participated in such worship? Those around him undoubtedly had. Astrological charts also turned up in the royal quarters and ap- peared in the pamphlet press as books of sorceries.61 After the Barricades and the king's resulting flight from Paris, even those who did not yet accuse him of witchcraft expressed the opinion that "he had received as much honor and submission from his people as he had gratitude for those who had the intention of putting him and his affairs into better condition and cleansing and purging his court of an infinity of harpies and bloodsuckers who robbed and ruined the poor people, without respect, decorum, or discretion, and secretly supported the party of those who belonged to the so-called religion as much as they were able."62 We see here the tangle of connec- tions metaphorically binding heretics, greedy courtiers, and witches into a mass of alien enemies of the true France. The people of Paris have acted against them, the pamphleteer is saying, and if the king con- tinues as their deluded protector, action against him will come next. The deaths of the Guise brothers in December 1588, showed un- arguably that Henri was the master of the coven, not its victim. He appeared in the pamphlets of 1589 and later as sorcerer, bloodsucker, and creature of monstrous evil. While the Guise assassination was of course his primary sin, the secondary was his battening on the people whose welfare a king should foster. The author of the Faux-visage descou- vert du fin Renard de France inquired, "Did not the poor people beg you when you saw them ruined at your feet, crushed into the ground, sucked dry of their blood, so parched by the overcharges of so many subsidies and diabolical devices of these bloodsuckers and supporters of the court?" 63 In vain do the poor people of France plead for mercy to a king whose nature is monstrous. The Holy League dedicated itself to the fight against the "sor- cerer" king.

The king appears in it as something like a sphinx in the classic Greek style, with the head of a lion, "to show that he joins to lust and self-love the boldness and arrogance of a lion. The female breasts which are below mark that this effeminate prince has confounded Nature herself, being, so to speak, hermaphrodite in his excesses. By this monster they also want to make it understood that he swells his breasts with the blood of his people, in order to nour- ish his bloodsuckers. That is to say he fills his coffers with his subjects' money to support unworthy favorites who continually suck him dry and involve him in the most insane spending." 64 The caption probably reached its audience by being read aloud, and perhaps not all of them grasped the point of a king "hermaphrodite in his excesses." Harder to misunderstand is the final statement, which strongly implies that the tie between the king and his mignons was exactly parallel to the one linking Satan to the witch and the witch to his or her familiar. (While familiars were not as general a feature of Continental witch beliefs as the corresponding lore in England, accounts of them did occur.) The Portrait monstrueux signaled the king's final exclusion from the conservative Catholic version of the true France. In the narratives of the deaths of the Guise brothers, he appears, instead, as master of the enemies intent on draining her dry. Typically, these works show the court/coven engaged in plotting against its "very Catholic" enemies, the duke and the cardinal. "Not withstanding this remarkable service, besides an infinite number of others equally noteworthy, carried out by them and their predecessors, who were very Catholic from of old, Henri de Valois did not leave off plotting the entire ruin of this family with his mignons, heretics and bloodsuckers of the people that they were." 65 Charles Pinselet depicted the king similarly in the well-known pamphlet Le martire des deuxfreres: "As to the like, he granted with very great regret the request of messieurs of the Third Estate for a reduc- tion in taxes, customs duties, and burdens, and for the pursuit of those whom they knew to have pillaged France and enriched themselves from the sweat and blood of the poor people."66 The king is decep- 64 Paris, Bibliotheque Nationale de France, Cabinet des Estampes Qb I, reproduced in Keith Cameron, Henri III.

Of course the blood- suckers did not really leave. Once the duke was dead, they returned to share their master's pleasure. "After dinner he made merry and took his pleasure in contemplating the murdered body with all his mignons, bloodsuckers, and other enemies of the public good." 67 The king as murderous sorcerer became an image very familiar to the adherents of the Holy League. At least fifty-seven accounts of the assassination and attacks on the king appeared in Paris in 1589; many of these went into several printings. Since not all pamphlets have sur- vived, the total was probably greater.68 A number of these works named Henri de Valois as a bloodsucking witch intent on the destruction of his subjects. Most notable, perhaps, was La vie et faits notables de Henri de Valois, printed by Didier Millot and probably written by Jean Boucher. The work's illustrations show all Henri's evil deeds, from the king's tor- turing innocent Catholics to his raping a nun and desecrating the Sainte-Chapelle. The bloody corpses of the Guise brothers are given a full-page spread.69 The text emphasizes the king's greed for money to lavish on his mignons. For them, according to Boucher, he even inflated the currency: "To augment the wealth he sucked out of his people, while [he said] he wished his treasurers to revalue the ecu at more than 60 sous, and the other coinage accordingly, those same trea- surers by his order, as they said, put them in Poitou at four and four and one-half francs. A little after peace was proclaimed, in November 1577, he issued an edict for the reformation of the coinage, in which many people, who did not know the profit he had received from it, thought he had done well. However, that profit, whether to him or to his mignons (some of whom would not see the end of the year) lasted a very short time, as is always the case with that which is acquired by trickery." 70 Boucher played expertly with the various connotations of the sang- sue metaphor. If the preceding paragraph evoked the image of the 67 Le martire des deuxjfrres, 73, 90. 68 For an enumeration and what is known of their printing history, see Pallier, Recherches sur l'imprimerie, 281-93. 69 Ibid., 292-93. 70 La vie etfaits notables de Henri de Valois, in Cimber and Danjou, Archives curieuses, 1st ser., 12:439.</page><page sequence="26">376 FRENCH HISTORICAL STUDIES greedy leech, Boucher's narrative of the deaths of Quelus and sev- eral other mignons in a mass duel evokes both witches and the idea of blood as medicine. The quarrel is pointless, the result of pride and bad temper. When it is over, four men are dead or dying. The king hastens to the side of his friend Quelus, "and, seeing him in such con- dition, with his wounds already dressed, he promised the doctors and surgeons that he would give them one hundred thousand ecus if they cured him-though he had none -without caring where he might get them, unless he might have recourse to the blood of the people to re- place that of his mignon."7' A complete role reversal has taken place. The king chosen by God to protect the welfare of all cares only for one. Like a witch, he seeks to restore his favorite's life by means of the meta- phorical blood he has sucked from his people. The sacred guarantor of social order has become the chief agent of disorder; no longer the father of his people, Henri has become leader of the forces of chaos and evil. Indicative of the role shift is the pamphlet's failure to award Henri his royal title. His actions have stripped him of his right to it. Boucher seems to suggest that Henri's blood must replace that which he has stolen from the nation if France is to return to innocence and health. The blood of Henri de Valois did, of course, flow within the year. The Holy League, whose writers had made him a vampire of the body politic, published this epitaph: He sucked all the blood From his unresisting people; Like a raging bull, He made himself their enemy. Sneering, he took the means to live From strong and weak alike. He ravaged us like a corsair; Madness swallowed him up.72 Whether Jean Boucher, for example, believed that Henri III and his courtiers actually drank blood does not matter a great deal. What is important is what the bloodsucker metaphor came to represent in the minds of his audience. Though differing on the crucial question of au- thentic religious belief, all parties to the civil wars of the late sixteenth century could accept that France was a corporate entity whose various components were as completely interconnected as the various parts of the human body. The person who in some way failed to match the pat- 71 Ibid., 412. 72 L:Estoile, Memoires-journaux, 4:20.</page><page sequence="27">LEECHES ON THE BODY POLITIC 377 tern that made this intimate linkage possible -whether by heresy in religion, failure in political duty, or financial exploitation of the vul- nerable-became an outsider, an alien invader in the body of France, a parasite. He or she had to be removed if that body was to retain its health and vitality. The metaphor of the sangsue thus drew on the fun- damental dichotomy between "us" and "them." And, because both sides in the religious wars could claim that their opponents were inspired by Satan, the us-them dichotomy merged with that of good and evil. Small wonder that party propagandists credited their foes with the sins of witches inspired by Satan. Given the prevailing "cosmology of contraries," they and their audience could envision the conflict in no other way. Over the second half of the sixteenth century, then, use of the sangsue metaphor tended to embody and develop a belief that out- siders were evil -the definition of outsider varying, of course, with the context. The reappearance of the metaphor in political writing seems almost always to signal a resurgence of hatred of "the other" and an attempt by propagandists to direct that hatred against specific targets. Mention has been made of the attack on the Concinis in 1614-15 and those on Mazarin; most interesting, however, is the use of the blood- sucker motif in the writings of early mercantilist thinkers such as Bar- thelemy de Laffemas and Antoine de Montchretien. Montchretien, in particular, seems to have been greatly moved by the fear of exploit- ative foreigners. The xenophobia epitomized by the sangsue metaphor thus became an important element of French economic thinking in the seventeenth century, a development I hope to explore in future essays.</page></plain_text>
