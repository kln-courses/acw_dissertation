THE DAUGHTER'S SEDUCTION: FEMINISM AND PSYCHO- ANALYSIS. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1982. .READING LACAN. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1985. 1. Metaphor/Metonymy, again? A Gallopian reading of The Daughter's Seduction with Reading Lacan not only echoes Gallop's announced project in the latter book-a Lacanian read- ing of Lacan-it also doubles what emerges more specifically as Reading Lacan's central strategy. Although Gallop sees it as an ethical imperative of Lacan's work to get beyond the imaginary so as to reach the symbolic, which is "the register of language, social exchange, and radical intersubjectivity" [RL 59], she warns that any effort to reach the symbolic that would pit the sym- bolic against the imaginary, positioning two identities in an adversarial rela- tion, would itself operate in the imaginary: "Ironically, the ethical imperative to accede to the symbolic and vigilantly to resist the imaginary is itself mired in the imaginary" [60]. Given the inevitability of becoming more "mired in the imaginary" the more vigilantly one tries to resist it, Gallop believes that the only path to the symbolic may lie through the imaginary. It is when the imaginary is not perceived as imaginary but as real that it is most harmful. Quicksand believed to be solid ground is the most hazardous: "What is projected would appear to be actually 'out there"' [62].1 Hence, rather than trying to avoid the imaginary, Gallop suggests it may be "the imaginary as imaginary that constitutes the symbolic" [62]. Doubling the imaginary, inten- tionally assuming its imagoes (images or cliches that "preferentially orient the way in which the subject apprehends") as imagoes, may be the only way of not believing one has unmediated access to the real, and hence may provide the only possible access to the symbolic realm [61; Gallop is quoting Lacan]. Even this program or conclusion-a program or conclusion is always suspect as imaginary- is doubled by a footnote that quotes it, changing the statement from an originary conviction to an already mediated "memory of a convic- tion": "Richardson asked about this sentence, 'it is the imaginary as imaginary that constitutes the symbolic' Although three years earlier I had been con- vinced that this was a new and illuminating understanding of the relationship of the imaginary and the symbolic, I no longer had the conviction, only the memory of the conviction" [63]. It is the force of this doubled authorization to double-central to Gallop's reading of Lacan- that motivates my reading of Gallop. So that, for instance, rather than performing a reading, instead of stag- ing wordplay, which would imply an audience suspending disbelief, entering an imaginary realm, I would attempt theater as theater. My reading should not be performed, but rehearsed. 'Gallop's ironic quotation marks-'out there'-constitute, in a sense, dramatic monologues within her text; they usually surround a controlled, self-conscious space where she 'allows' a naively imaginary term or concept. diacritics / winter 1986 15</page><page sequence="3">Specifically, what I will rehearse is a discussion of metaphor and metonymy, a topic Gallop addresses extensively in several places.2 A clear move can be discerned from a structuring metaphor in The Daughter's Seduction (staged incest) to a structuring me- tonym in Reading Lacan (transference). I would like first to detail the nature of this altera- tion in the type of motivating trope of each book and then to suggest that this simple chronological shift from one book to the other actually figures an ordering of metaphor and metonymy that is crucial for Gallop's project on several levels. In her work, metaphor is characteristically anterior to metonymy and also necessary for it to function. But de- spite its being posterior to and dependent on metaphor, metonymy is always the trope that carries the force of Gallop's project. Power, subversion, revolution-also effective psychoanalysis or feminism-must be approached along the syntagmatic axis. Analytic transference, for example, depends on interpretation (transference means interpretation) but is only effective insofar as it achieves contiguity with the patient's life. Perhaps work- ing in part against my formulation's slipping into the mire of the imaginary, where a free- standing and argumentative character would accrue to it, my description of an active and powerful metonymy that depends on a supportive metaphor as constitutive of Gallop's work will parallel and invert Gallop's own configuration of the tropes in her chapter "Metaphor and Metonymy" in Reading Lacan [114-32]. There she delineates and seems to privilege what I will call the "behind-every-successful-man-stands-a-woman" arrangement, describing metaphor as "patent" and forceful and metonymy as necessary but "latent" Such a description acknowledges metonymy only to affirm its secondary status as sup- portive rather than subversive of metaphor's transcendent claims to truth. By tracing an inverted reflection within Gallop's work of her own configuration of the tropes, I hope to gesture toward that doubling of the imaginary that constitutes access to the symbolic. Attempting to keep always in mind, then, that my analysis is chiasmically mirroring the arrangement of metaphor and metonymy Gallop herself describes, the central portion of my argument will align in her project three crucial elements whose effective force is in the metonymic dimension but whose metonymy is dependent on a necessary metaphor. The three elements I will align are: (1) the strategy of viewing the imaginary as imaginary to obtain access to the symbolic; (2) Gallop's characteristic use of mise-en-abime, which is a textual move that reimplicates a discourse in what it is describing; (3) her "camping" on received notions of femininity. Theater is an announced structuring analogy of The Daughter's Seduction: "In a manner analogous to the dialogue between psychoanalysis and feminism, each chapter of the book stages the encounter between texts of at least two authors" [xii]. Closely intricated with the dramatic trope is the figure of domestic seduction: "The roles of father and daughter are given to Lacan and Irigaray as well as to Psychoanalysis and Feminism. But because this father-daughter relation is a seduction, the roles become more compli- cated, more equivocal, more yielding" [xiv]. Both drama and familial sex are metaphors, figures structured by a relation of similarity to some sort of encounter Gallop is trying to imagine between texts and between intellectual or political movements. The staged se- duction is somehow "like" another form of contact between discourses. The Daughter's Seduction is "based ... upon the belief that, if words there be or body there be, some- where there is a desire for dialogue, intercourse, exchange" [xiii]. Although there is a metonymical dimension insofar as a book on sexual difference uses sex as its motivating figure,3 "words" and "body," "dialogue" and "intercourse'" textuality and sexuality are aligned by Gallop because they share certain essential qualities: she points out that both involve notions of closure, entry, violation, or exchange with an other. Inversely, while Reading Lacan is metaphoric insofar as analysand/reader and analyst/ text are terms that occupy analogous positions in a transference structure, transference itself is not homologous with but rather inextricable from the reading process. Gallop's "reading transference" [RL 30] and the psychoanalytic situation from which the term 2/ will be relying throughout on Roman lakobson's now canonical definition and distinction of the terms. 3Gerard Genette refers to a metaphor that derives from the subject matter of its own discourse as "diegetic" ["Metonymie chez Proust" 43]. 16</page><page sequence="4">transference derives are not two separable activities associated by reason of similarity. Though Gallop's reading of Lacan's text places the text in the role of analyst and herself in the role of patient, transferring onto the text as "the subject presumed to know," the scene is motivated by her belief "that transference is the whole engine of analysis" [28], both in reading and in therapy. Arguing that psychoanalysis should be seen "as a regional branch of literary studies" [24], part of the whole, Gallop uses psychoanalytic transference as a metonymic figure for her reading project. She refuses a metaphoric exchange when she notes that her reading "would have to analyze something like a 'transference' at play between reader and text, but it would have to be careful to attend to the specificity of that something, to the specific dynamic of the relation of reading" [30; Gallop's italics]. Meta- phor, operating at the level of analogy, depends on repressing the "specificity of that something." That transference is not "just like" reading, cannot replace it in a one-to-one correspondence, but is instead next to, related to, a part of reading is what enables it to represent reading Lacan. Interestingly, Gallop's most extensive discussion of these two types of rhetorical de- vices, the chapter "Metaphor and Metonymy" in Reading Lacan, is also the section of her later book that most recalls The Daughter's Seduction in being explicitly about sexual difference. Via a "necessarily contradictory and errant process of reading" [RL 120], Gal- lop follows Lacan's infamous "algorithms" for metonymy and metaphor that appear in "The Agency of the Letter in the Unconscious, or Reason since Freud." The chapter concludes that a privileging of metaphor is what is most apparent, most patent in Lacan's work. Metaphor, considered the vertical trope and valued because it is linked to su- fficiency, creativity, and paternity, seems situated above "metonymy, that sad structure, horizontally laid out, offer[ing] up only lack" [125]. Yet this apparent privileging of phallic metaphor is only "apparent"; it is, in fact, a "misreading'" though one invited by Lacan's text. This "easier" misreading is taken because of "'the eternal temptation ... to consider that what is most apparent [the phallus, metaphor] in a phenomenon is what explains everything"' [126; Gallop is quoting Lacan]. There is, however, a reading more "mature" than that "insistence of phallic phase reasoning" that privileges only what is most obvious. This more correct, more mature reading, which Gallop associates with adult sexuality, recognizes the latent power inherent in metonymy but does not privilege a metonymic, maternal phallus in the place of metaphor. If metaphor, Gallop argues, should not be considered that which alone "explains everything," then making metonymy the transcen- dent trope would be equally "yielding" to phallic reasoning ("incorrect yet powerfully difficult to avoid"), simply inverting the elements while maintaining a polar opposition of sufficiency and insufficiency, wholeness and lack: "Any polar opposition between meta- phor and metonymy (vertical versus horizontal, masculine versus feminine) is trapped in the imaginary order, subject to the play of identification and rivalry" [132]. Instead of viewing one or the other trope as sufficient by itself, Gallop's more mature reading would like to see metonymy as necessary to metaphor. If the "algorithms" figure metonymy as a minus sign, a horizontal bar (-), and metaphor as that horizontal bar crossed by a vertical line (+), Gallop argues that a phallic valorizing of metaphor as entirely self-sufficient perceives only the vertical line in the figure. Instead, metaphor should be seen as not really vertical, but rather as non-linear, a non-linearity that always already depends on the horizontal dimension for its effect: "If the privilege of the vertical is wedded to the preference for metaphor, then a recognition of the two dimensions of the + suggest that metonymy is necessary for metaphor" [my italics]. Quoting Lacan, Gallop would insist that "metonymy is there from the beginning, and it is what makes metaphor possible" [124]. Though she does not draw this association, the view of the relationship of metaphor and metonymy for which Gallop is arguing, a patently spectacular trope secretly (it is the more "difficult" reading; the text seems at first to suggest metaphor functions indepen- dently) dependent on a latently supportive trope, is like the cliche which would teach "behind every successful man stands a woman." Gallop would declare null what she calls the "wedded" state of the preference for metaphor and the privilege of the vertical so that metaphor's true helpmate, "necessary" metonymy, can be acknowledged. Or, similarly, the idea that "metonymy is there from the beginning and it is what makes metaphor diacritics / winter 1986 17</page><page sequence="5">possible:' recalls the admonishing saying that every great man begins with his mother. Gallop's celebration of the metonymy necessary for metaphor, the woman behind the man without whom the man wouldn't be possible, can be heard like an argument for Mother's Day. However, men giving their mothers or wives flowers because they "couldn't have done it without them" is frequently regarded as a patriarchal sop, a celebration of women's traditional place to keep them in that place. The political and philosophical implications of such an argument, which stresses that a metonymy read as feminine supports, motivates, or even produces metaphor but which allows the latter to keep its preeminence, can be suggested by examining Gerard Genette's detailed analysis of how such a tropic structure functions in a specific text. Genette's "Metonymie chez Proust" helps to make clear what is at stake or, rather, the claims that can themselves lean for support on the arrangement of metaphor and meton- ymy as Gallop phrases it. For Genette, temporal and spatial contiguity, somewhat like the classical unities of time and place, function overwhelmingly in Proust's text to structure, authorize, suggest, or guarantee the more spectacular "work of the metaphoric imagina- tion" [43]. For example, the striking metaphor, in the Sodom and Gomorrah section of The Remembrance of Things Past, comparing the consummation of "the union Jupien-Charlus" to the fertilization of an orchid by a bee is a parallel that is "carefully prepared, managed, supported, reactivated page by page" by a contiguity: ... the symbolism does not cease feeding itself on the relation of contiguity that is established in the courtyard of the Guermantes mansion (unity of place) at the moment in which the insect and the baron enter it together (unity of time)" [49]. The metonymic association of the baron and the bee-they are at the same place at the same time-is what generates and "nurses" the suggestion of homology between them. Curiously, that a metaphor-a figure traditionally implying the revelation by a poet of some essential characteristic shared by two things or actions-is here and elsewhere shown to be dependent on contiguity that could be the result of chance, never suggests for Genette that metonymy if it underlies must also undercut the poetic truth of a comparison. Rather, the two tropes meld together into an artistically powerful unity: "qui se ressemble s'assemble" [45]. (Genette describes Proust's text as "fondue" [60]). The language Genette uses to describe the relationship of metaphor and metonymy is strikingly appropriate to that of the ideal bourgeois marriage (which Freud, in nineteenth-century Vienna, took as paradigmatic) of Gallop's "adult sexual model [that] sees the masculine dependency on the feminine, sees the horizontal bar in metaphor's cross" Genette writes: Far from being antagonistic and incompatible, metaphor and metonymy support each other and interpenetrate one another; and to do justice to the latter does not consist in drawing up a list of metonymies over and against the list of meta- phors but rather of showing the presence and action of relations of "coexistence" at the very heart of the relation of analogy: the role of metonymy in metaphor. [42] 4 Elsewhere, Genette speaks explicitly of the "marriage" metaphor and metonymy achieve [51]. Why should Genette consider "metaphor finding its support and its motivation in a metonymy" as a "harmonious relation" [47]? After all, as Paul de Man notes, "necessity and chance [are] a legitimate way to distinguish between analogy and contiguity .... The inference of identity and totality that is constitutive of metaphor is lacking in the purely relational metonymic context: an element of truth is involved in taking Achilles for a lion but none in taking Mr. Ford for a motor-car" [Allegories of Reading 14]. Consequently, de Man argues, it follows that with a discovery of metaphor dependent for its effect on metonymy, "the metaphysical categories of presence, essence, action, truth, and beauty 4This passage is also quoted by Jonathan Culler, whose essay 'The Turns of Metaphor" provides an extremely helpful discussion of the issues involved. 18</page><page sequence="6">do not remain unaffected by such a reading" [15] Why then should it be, as de Man observes, that for Genette and others "the combination of both [metaphor and meton- ymy] is treated descriptively and non-dialectically without considering the possibility of logical tensions" [7]? It is suggestive of an answer that most of Genette's examples associ- ate metonymy with the natural: the earth, the sea, the countryside. Keeping this in mind, when considering de Man's illustration it is possible to imagine that there would indeed be a type of "truth" involved in taking Mr. Ford for a motor-car. The causal and direct relation of production that links Mr. Ford and a motor-car can seem more "literal" or "natural', hence more authoritative, than the bold poetic act of finding essential similari- ties between Achilles and a lion. Such an assumption of naturalness or literalness in spatial and/or temporal intimacy represents a transference of continuity onto sheer conti- guity. When faced with things that are next to each other, one assumes their significant relation to each other; rather than the mere juxtaposition of events, one perceives a larger unity: elements are seen as members in a group or system. At the level of the signifier, for example, perceiving contiguity as continuity is a reading transference. It is only when the metonymy of letters, words, or sentences next to each other is taken for granted as natural that a text can be read as coherent. That transferred linguistic continuity can then serve, however, to "underwrite" the coherence of phenomenal experience itself. One way of understanding what Cynthia Chase de- scribes as the "figuration" that is necessary for the material "process of signification ... [to] exemplify phenomenal experience" is as a metonymy naturalized at the level of the signifier. As we saw in Genette's reading of Proust, where metonymies invested with "literalness" authorize metaphoric claims about essential and poetically truthful identities, Chase notes how "the process of signification"' which has a material element, is made to serve as an example and a guarantee of the phenomenality of experience. But this belies the arbitrary nature of the link between signifier and signified, the sign's independence of sensory determina- tions; the materiality rather than the phenomenality of the sign. In fact, the process of signification can exemplify phenomenal experience only by means of a figuration. [quoted in J. Culler, "Reading Lyric" 104] In Lacan's "sailboat" example, for instance, it is the material contiguity of "sail" and "boat" read as continuity at the level of the phrase that enables sail to be a synecdoche for boat on the phenomenal level [discussed in Laplanche, 133]. This is also one sense in which the "cryptonyms" developed by Abraham and Torok's melancholic patients (and by the Wolfman, whose case history the analysts studied) emblematize the function of significa- tion in general. For the melancholics, semantic and phonemic associations at the material level of the signifier (Abraham and Torok speak of "word-things") motivate psychic opera- tions. It is worth noting briefly, because it will help us to understand what is involved in Gallop's linking of metonymy and femininity, that the assertion, made either by feminists or by those feminists oppose, of something "literal" in the metonymic relation of mother and child, is like a reading transference in that it also transfers onto contiguity a natural- ized continuity.5 Such a transference makes it possible to valorize as unquestionably present the maternal relation. But as with Genette's primary illustrations, in which what the link between metonymy and nature (earth, sea, countryside) supports are phallic steeples or the phallicly imagined "edifice of memory" associated with metaphor, the transference onto maternity of the legitimacy of the natural has historically been used as the conduit to guarantee the paternal relation. The latter is more important and powerful but nevertheless dependent on the authority of the maternal link. As if emphasizing explicitly how the close association of naturalized contiguity with the feminine can au- 5There is, then, a sense in which the early "undifferentiated" relation of child and mother can be thought of as the first "reading transference' or as the relation which future transferences of continuity will replicate. diacritics/ winter 1986 19</page><page sequence="7">thorize a chain of assumptions that, in their monolithic denial of difference, might be considered phallogocentric, for Genette it is frequently a literal woman who functions metonymically to assist metaphor in achieving perfect identity and unity: . . the mar- riage of outside and inside, of the garden and the salon, of artifice and the natural season: around Mme. Swann, all contrasts efface themselves, all oppositions disappear, all divi- sions vanish in the euphoria of a continuous space" [51; italics mine]. Such claims and structures resting on Genette's association of metonymy with nature and then with a woman problematize Gallop's connection, to vindicate both, of metonymy and feminin- ity. Although Gallop, of course, does not want to privilege the "natural" or the "literal," her feminine personification of the trope functions precisely by stressing the lack of attention metonymy draws to itself. The anthropomorphism seems more real because, as with the continuity one assumes in a text, it is based on the assignment of negative characteristics: latency and passivity. In a sense inverting and so "effacing" the poetic trope of prosopopoeia, it is the naturalizing strategy's assignment of the lack of voice or face that makes metonymy female. Gallop notes, "the latency, the hiddenness of meton- ymy, like that of the female genitalia, lends it an appearance of naturalness or passivity so that 'realism' . . . appears either as the lack of tropes, or as somehow mysterious, the 'dark continent' of rhetoric" [RL 127; so that the expression "faced with a text" is usually invoked to describe a situation in which a text is precisely not being taken for granted as natural, transparent, or coherent].6 In important contrast, however, to the naturalization of metonymy, Gallop's method- ological discussion of how one might "read" Lacan's algorithms for metaphor and meton- ymy compares Lacan's text to a rebus. In order to interpret a rebus (or a dream), it is necessary to struggle against "our habit of discursive reading, our assumption that each sentence flows out of the preceding one." One must force oneself to "separate each element for consideration" before attempting to reach an understanding of the text. It is necessary to realize that with such a method, a reading cannot be complete, unified, or self-contained because at the start discontinuity is assumed. All that is possible, once discrete pieces of the text have been interpreted, is an associational understanding: "One cannot follow the argument, but if the reader is willing to concentrate on one sentence or fragment at a time, much can be understood" [RL 118]. I would suggest that, like other central elements of Gallop's project, the reading methodology she recommends- interpreting individual elements discontinuously as the best way to approach an associa- tional understanding of a text7-inverts the configuration of metonymy being there from the beginning and making metaphor possible that she describes and privileges in her actual reading of Lacan's formula for the tropes. In an attempt, then, to make clearer what is already implied by Gallop's discovery of metonymy "necessary" to metaphor-not the former's loving and self-effacing matrimo- nial support for but rather its subversion of the claims of the latter-I will be tracing at various levels in her texts an inversion of her own configuration of the tropes, arguing that the shift I described above, from the informing metaphor of The Daughter's Seduction to the essentially metonymic context of Reading Lacan, is a simple chronological figure for a structure that is central to Gallop's project. Metonymy occupies the active, powerful role 6Gallop discovers hints in Lacan's text that metonymy "is considered 'oppressive"' and is linked to servitude [RL 122, 128-29]. I believe that metonymy's "oppressiveness" must be derived from the naturalizing continuity that is transferred onto the relation. That continuity can invoke either the oppressiveness of the quotidian, which is frequently associated with women (see, e.g., Judith Fetterly's The Resisting Reader), or the relentlessness of large-scale natural phenomena, also frequently associ- ated with the feminine (e.g., hurricanes' being given women's names). 'Gallop's description of her own scholarly methodology might be similarly understood as a privileg- ing of metonymy that is nonetheless dependent on a metaphoric structure with secondary status. Her work "is not intended to be simply an introduction to or a translation of an existent body of knowledge but rather a contribution to the sort of thinking it describes" [DS xi]. Privileged is a metonymic addition, Gallop's "contribution" to the larger body, but it depends on or derives from her providing what would otherwise be "simply" an introductory translation reflecting, for an American reader, "the essentials" of the French theory. 20</page><page sequence="8">in her work; for instance, as I mentioned above and will discuss in more detail below, Gallop views psychoanalytic transference as primarily effective in its metonymic relation to the patient's present or past life. Nonetheless, as with her method of reading a "rebus- like" text, first interpreting individual, discontinuous elements and then attempting an associative understanding, metonymy is characteristically posterior to, and dependent for its effects on, metaphor (here, "interpreting" the rebus's discrete elements). Active meton- ymy that depends on a supportive metaphor is a constitutive tropic configuration for Gallop. As part of the "rehearsed reading" mentioned above, my observation chiasmically doubling Gallop's own (my argument mirrors Gallop's own description of the tropes' arrangement) will, I hope, gesture toward that assumption of the imaginary that consti- tutes a symbolic approach. 2. Metonymic power The observation that the constitutive rhetorical device changes from The Daughter's Seduction to Reading Lacan can briefly be made more detailed; a move from metaphor to metonymy accurately describes the figuration of both feminism and Gallop's narrative identity in the two books. In The Daughter's Seduction, "the writer's viewpoint, the narra- tive voice, changes-from chapter to chapter, even within chapters" [DS xi]. The narrative voice changes, exchanges one role for another. While it is true that a single writer figuring an intellectual position, for example Ginnie Lemoine representing Lacanian orthodoxy, is a metonymy, part for whole, more characteristic of the book is that Gallop herself be- comes a ventriloquist, woman of a thousand voices. Her various roles-psychoanalysis or feminism, Freud or Dora, father or daughter-correspond sometimes to specific move- ments or texts, sometimes to elements of Gallop's own psyche. These multiple shifting representations, the many players of The Daughter's Seduction, imply an authorial subject available only via the masks which replace (occupy the place of) the narrative voice. Because she plays many roles, Gallop is available in The Daughter's Seduction only through substitution, through metaphor. Gallop's presence in Reading Lacan, in contrast, is mostly as a character in the story of the book's writing. She narrates her own emotions and thoughts as she composed various sections and tells of events in her life, such as her therapy and her dreams, which become continuous with, an element in the process of, her transferential reading of Lacan. That such material appears mostly in footnotes in Reading Lacan, literally contigu- ous on the page with the text, contrasts with the endnotes of The Daughter's Seduction. Endnotes, organized chapter-by-chapter at the end of the book, replicate metaphorically the book's development; they are an other scene from the text, and suggest an author/ scholar who is discontinuous with what she is writing. In Reading Lacan, details like a broken typewriter key and a conversation with a colleague at lunch, present directly below the text, enable Gallop to emerge in what Lacan refers to as the "grand-style metonymic process" [RL 126]. The "Romantic and Symbolist poetry" Jakobson and Lacan contrast with the realist novel and associate with metaphor [RL 125] recalls, on the other hand, the symbolic romances of The Daughter's Seduction. The representation of feminism in the two books also follows a location of The Daughter's Seduction mostly on the axis of metaphor and Reading Lacan mostly on the axis of metonymy. The daughter in The Daughter's Seduction stands for feminism not as a representative element, part of a whole movement, but because she occupies a relation- ship to the father analogous to the relationship of feminism to psychoanalysis. The meta- phoric replacement signified by making the first book specifically about "feminism' in- cluding, for example, the word to represent the concept in the title "Feminism and Psychoanalysis," is a gesture absent from Reading Lacan. Instead, Gallop notes the latter is not a recognizably feminist project, since Lacan is not a woman, nor have I been concerned in this book explicitly to address Lacan's relation to feminism or women, which I have already done in another book. Perhaps naively, I had not considered this a feminist project but had thought of it as a "straight" book on diacritics/ winter 1986 21</page><page sequence="9">Lacan, a study that addressed the general question of how one could possibly read Lacan's text. [RL 18] It was only when a publisher's "reader" read Reading Lacan, and complained in a letter that Gallop admitted she lacked mastery of Lacan's text and, in an addition "tacked on at the very end of the report," complained that she sometimes used feminine pronouns without having a specifically female antecedent, that Gallop began to consider the book as "about" feminism. The first gesture, Gallop's assuming her inability to master Lacan's text, was "in the spirit of a Lacanian reading" and hence central to her project. The "rejection;' on the other hand, "of the automatic generic 'he;" though "an important topos of feminist writing praxis," seemed unconnected to, not necessarily representative of, a Lacanian reading of Lacan. It is only their metonymic juxtaposition in a "reader's report" that associates the two for Gallop: "thanks to their joint appearance in my reader's report, I have come to consider that they are, theoretically, the same gesture" [RL 18-19]. It is interesting that, in The Daughter's Seduction, Gallop is somewhat hesitant about assuming the title of feminist: "[some] have questioned my right to the label 'feminist.' I would not endorse most of the traditional practices of... feminism" [DS xii]. Perhaps Gallop's reluc- tance is partially due to the tropic context of that book in which (though such an implica- tion is directly opposed to the fluid feminism the thematic content promotes) an assump- tion of the title feminist would be a single exchange, a one-for-one correspondence. In the tropic context of Reading Lacan, Gallop may be more willing to call herself a feminist because she can represent feminism by being next to it. We might say that Gallop read her reader's report metonymically. As part of her chapter in Reading Lacan on metaphor and metonymy, Gallop differentiates between metaphoric interpretation and what she calls metonymic reading: "Whereas a metaphoric interpretation would consist in supplying another signifier which the signifier in the text stands for (a means b; the tie represents a phallus), a metonymic interpretation supplies a whole context of associations. Perhaps this metonymic interpretation might be called feminine reading" [RL 129]. Her description of metaphoric and metonymic reading recalls the crucial methodological division drawn earlier in the book between "two aspects of psychoanalysis" and hence of psychoanalytic criticism: interpretation and transference. Interpretation of a text, performed by "symbol hunters', locates recognizably Freudian or Lacanian themes. Such themes-anal drives and negative oedipal complexes in a Freud- ian reading, for example, or symbolic fathers and signifying chains in a Lacanian interpretation-"correspond to the 'contents of the unconscious"' [25]. Interpretative criti- cism, thus, is the same as metaphoric reading: "a means b; the tie represents a phallus" A transferential reading, in contrast, is metonymic; it studies "something very powerful that happens between subjects" or between a text and a subject in the register of desire [28]. Desire, for Gallop and Lacan, is always a metonym. It is important to emphasize that transferential reading, attending or giving instance to a reader's contiguity with what she reads, is not the same as a reading transference that always assumes continuity and coherence in a text. (Such an assumption at the level of signification is rather what makes possible metaphoric interpretation: a can only stand for b if both are already members of a larger system in which they have significance.) We might say, in fact, that a reading transference is precisely what transferential reading represents an attempt to "work through" Hence the position of the metonymic critic, the place from which Gallop works, is "within the effects of a massive reading transference onto Lacan's texts" [30]. What must be noticed is that effective transference, though it works metonymically, is dependent on metaphor. Gallop argues it is "necessary to recognize that transference is the whole engine of analysis, that interpretation is hardly more than the medium through which the transference is manifested" [RL 28]. Making transference the "engine of analy- sis" assigns it the active, powerful role. But to see interpretation, which is metaphor, as "the medium through which the transference is manifested" is to suggest that metaphor provides the enabling conditions for an effect achieved by metonymy. While the word "medium" implies an enveloping contiguity of transference within interpretation, "me- dium" also implies that interpretation, though passive, is the already there, the necessary discourse through which metonymy swims. The analytic relation depends, for Gallop, on 22</page><page sequence="10">"interpreting" on the level of discourse the patient's experiences and is, in that sense (unlike other non-textualized events), in a metaphoric or paradigmatic relation to them. But effective analysis is also an action on the same level as past experiences, a "doing differently" of past actions, of what was done (of what is interpreted as having been done) in the past. Jean Laplanche makes a related point when he argues that although metaphor is the basis of transference (transference actually means metaphor in German), its psycho- analytic effectiveness may lie in its metonymic dimension, in the extent to which transfer- ence achieves a contiguity with the patient's (past or present) experiences, deriving me- tonymically rather than only metaphorically (as, for instance, an "unreal love") from them. It is crucial in this context that contiguity, unlike either naturalized continuity or meta- phoric identity, can imply some possibility of discontinuity, hence a chance for change. For Laplanche, as for Gallop, the powerful aspect of transference is the participation of "its rhythm with a vaster form of discourse" [138; Laplanche's italics].8 A similar dependence of a forceful metonym on a supportive metaphor is apparent in Gallop's figures for the imaginary as imaginary providing access to the symbolic. For instance, she writes that "it could be said that the symbolic can be encountered only as a tear in the fabric of the imaginary" [RL 60]. Here, the metaphor, the a for b, is "fabric" for "imaginary." Nestled within the metaphor, however, wrapped in the maternally encom- passing fabric, is the tear of the symbolic. A tear, though disruptive, is metonymically connected to fabric; it is situated inside of, contained within, a larger whole. Like transfer- ence, swimming through its medium of interpretation, this privileged tear of the symbolic is dependent for its existence as a metonym on the enveloping context of the metaphori- cal fabric. The same configuration appears in Gallop's discussion of how the analyst should function as a mirror for the patient. (I will return below to how, if my aligning of these three tropes-interpretation as a medium; the imaginary as a fabric; and the analyst as a mirror-by similarity of structure is to have any effective force at all, that force must be located in the metonymic dimension.) Quoting Lacan, Gallop argues that the analyst should offer "the subject the pure mirror of an unruffled surface"' However, she adds that the analyst should be "a mirror but not a mirror image. 'Unruffled surface' translates 'surface sans accidents.'... To be a 'surface sans accidents' is to be a surface without attributes, without any characteristic except the pure fact of surface. ... Psychoanalysis should not be an encounter with a likeness or a double, but with a mirror" [61-62]. Here, as with the fabric that stands for the imaginary, the overall structuring trope is a metaphor: mirror for analyst. But touching this figure, what is privileged is something like the tear of the symbolic. If a mirror compared to an analyst is on one level itself a metaphor (a for b; mirror for analyst), and on another level a figure for metaphor itself (reflection, equiva- lence, replacement), again Gallop privileges whatever of the syntagmatic dimension can be approached. The mirror does not actually replace, stand for, what is in front of it; that is what the mirror image does. It is difficult to say precisely how (one can only point toward it .. .), but the mirror itself is not similar to, rather somehow contiguous with the reflection. Perhaps the only thing one can say about the mirror is that it touches the mirror image at all points. The gesture in the paragraph above of attempting to approach a metonymic structure metonymically ("one can only point towards it . . ') is an attempt at imitation of a charac- teristic doubling move of Gallop's in both The Daughter's Seduction and Reading Lacan: locating mise-en-abime structures. Discovering how a text re-implicates itself in what it is describing gives Gallop's work much of its force and also much of its fun. For example, Lacan's scathing critique of American ego psychology as serving only to strengthen the imaginary and reinforce the analyst's own ego is, Gallop argues, precisely the aspect of Lacan's work that, caught in the imaginary of vigilant opposition, most reinforces his own ego. Similarly, critics' bibliographical problems of origin and chronology with the essay "The Mirror Stage" are "only appropriate since the essay is precisely about the origin of a chronology" [RL 77]. Or, when Catherine Clement, a student of Lacan's, sees "The Mirror Stage" as "the germ containing everything" in Lacan's thought, she is replicating his asser- 8Exactly what Gallop's assumption that interpretation is necessary to analytic transference implies was suggested to me by Cynthia Chase. diacritics/ winter 1986 23</page><page sequence="11">tion in the essay that what is formed during the mirror stage "will be the rootstock" of later identifications. Gallop's reading makes it evident that what is formed for Clement with "The Mirror Stage," an essay about "the forming of an 'I, of an identity," is precisely the "identity we call Lacan." This identity may, however, be imaginary. Gallop finds that Lacan has anticipated exactly such a viewpoint of his work as Clement's and has condemned it as illusory: "It happens that our students delude themselves into finding in our writings 'already there' that to which our teaching has since brought us" [77]. So Gallop realizes that, to the extent she momentarily accepted Clement's claim to have found the mature Lacan already present in the early work, even her own reading of Clement's reading of "The Mirror Stage" is reimplicated in what the essay describes: "I have been so captivated by the resemblance between what Clement says about "The Mirror Stage" and what Lacan says in it, that in my enthusiasm I accepted, unquestioningly, if only momentarily, her claim that all Lacan is there en germe" [77; Gallop's italics]. Clement's en germe claim produced an enthusiasm in me, which immediately became embarrassing. My embarrassment corresponded to a realization that it was extremely pleasurable to find the later Lacan 'already there' in the early writing. An anticipation of maturation produced joy along with a willingness to suspend disbelief. This joy may resemble the 'jubilation' Lacan ascribes to the child assuming his mirror image, being captivated by an analogy and suspending his disbelief. [78] In discussing how Clement's text is implicated in the mirror stage it describes, Gallop discovers her own discourse inscribed within that same structure. This complex layering of a picture within a picture within a picture, a move characteristic of Gallop and, arguably, of post-Structuralism in general, I would suggest is continuous with the project of viewing the imaginary as imaginary to provide access to the symbolic. In painting, a mise-en-abime emphasizes the structuring pervasiveness of art, works against the illusion of unmediated access to the real. Like the effort to see the mirror itself in the mirror image, a picture within a picture makes it possible to see that the picture, even the "whole picture," is a pic- ture. When Gallop aligns the form of a text with its content, shows that the form of a text is the same as its content, it becomes evident that the content is not freestanding truth. If form becomes equivalent to its content, then it becomes possible to think content as for- mal, as within a system. The imperative is to see the text itself, touching everywhere what it is saying. It is crucial to understand that while this move of re-implicating a text in what it describes depends on a metaphoric relation, on Gallop showing that the form of a text is like, is the same as, its content, the force of the gesture exists in the metonymic dimen- sion. Though the base of a mise-en-abime may be an analogy, a small picture homolo- gous with a larger picture, the power of the structure is that the pictures are together, that one contains the other. They are within the same frame and make it possible to see that frame. Though Gallop might first tell what Lacan's mirror phase is by explaining the con- tent of "The Mirror Phase" essay, and then demonstrate an analogy with, say, the form of Tom Jones, or even with the form of a critic's approach to Tom Jones, that would stop at interpretation, situating Gallop outside the textual play. It is the mirror phase implicated with its description that enables a reading of mirror phase, description, and reading of that description as part of the same symbolic system. Gallop's "camping" on one version of femininity might be understood the same way. The "posture" informing both The Daughter's Seduction and Reading Lacan is "not a prudish correction of the loose and improper but an immodest celebration of the broad" [RL 16]. Prudish correction of the loose and improper would be oppositional and hence caught in the same imaginary realm as the definition of femininity it would "correct." So Gallop melodramatizes, plays to the hilt, bad puns and all, the "broad'" the whore in the virgin-whore dichotomy that has traditionally structured women's identities. Gallop would not replace those structured identities (possible to understand as the patriarchy's "inter- pretation" of "women"), exchange them for some "truer" one; rather she would see them as constructs, as systemically determined. Recalling once again the "imaginary as imagi- 24</page><page sequence="12">nary that constitutes the symbolic," Gallop's camp includes the doubling implicit in all parodies. She self-consciously reflects back whatever has been defined as the "broad" provides an exaggerated version to stand opposite what is apparently real. She dedicates Reading Lacan, for instance, neither to a proper name, "For Richard," nor to an abstract quality, "For Love;' but to what can be read as either proper name or abstract quality: "For Dick." While parody, however, for example of a political system, is usually aimed to reveal what is satirized as false or foreign so as to replace it with something truer or more valid, for Gallop the location of what she is doubling is not only elsewhere. Though she does parody patriarchy, a patriarchal identity assigned to women, the most powerful and revolutionary dimension of her camp is once again metonymic: she would represent "the difference within" Her project is most successful to the extent that it figures patriarchy not as separate from women, imposed on them from outside, a foreign entity with which they are forced to have exchange, but rather as contiguous with them at every point, inside and out. To put it somewhat tritely, patriarchy is inscribed within women and inscribes them within it. One way of understanding what differentiates parody and camp is to consider the hostile affect of the former and the affectionate mode of the latter. While parody's oppositional and individualistic dimensions (satire is frequently associated with misanthropy) may point toward its imaginary, camp's obvious and unashamed affection for what it figures tends to stress an acceptance of the difference within and an awareness of camp's own inscription in the discourse it is doubling. That camp never seems to have a "target" may be because it knows it can neither precisely separate out nor separate itself from what it is "camping" on. The funniness of camp, for example Gallop's dedication, is not the laugh of parody but is more knowing, maybe closer to the smile that frequently seems to be evoked, at least for me, by the cleverness of a theorist reimplicating a dis- course in what it is describing. My aligning the ethical imperative to view the imaginary as imaginary with a charac- teristic Gallopian textual gesture (mise-en-abime) and then with camp (the cliche as cliche) is based on similarities among the three structures, shared characteristics. All three structures derive their power from a dominant metonym dependent on a latent meta- phor; homology is essential to my argument. But for the alignment to have any force, these three must be seen not only as analogous to one another, but as moments (time is always metonymic) in a more general project motivating Gallop's work. It is difficult to define this project exactly, to exchange for a precise name the time line these moments lie on. Post-Structuralism, feminist camp, Lacanian psychoanalysis-these are all elements, could represent a partial explanation, part for whole, but none could replace it entirely. As I attempt, however, to approach Gallop's work metonymically, I am mirroring what she described as an active and powerful metaphor dependent on a necessary but subservient metonymy. My locating a set of homologous areas in Gallop's work but assigning the force of my analysis to their possible contiguity parallels my description of each of the three, but it also parallels (chiasmically reflecting) the woman-behind-every- successful-man configuration of metaphor and metonymy that Gallop "discovers." 3. The fading subject Perhaps the "extra" that would, ideally, be implied by my study's reflection of Gallop's arrangement of the two rhetorical devices, what might (at least according to the version of the trope's configuration I have privileged) lean on or derive from the structure of similar- ity here elaborated, is the possibility of approaching what remains, I believe, a crucial challenge of Gallop's project: locating metonymic links between the categories she inter- prets as psychoanalysis and politics. The psychoanalytic paradigm that includes both reading and therapy must touch, not be completely a separate scene from, activist femi- nism with "an urgency," as Gallop says in another context, "not unlike that of lessening the neurotic patient's suffering" [RL 38]. In her critique of Juliet Mitchell's crucial 1974 at- tempt, Psychoanalysis and Feminism, to apply one field to the other, what Gallop finds diacritics/ winter 1986 25</page><page sequence="13">most problematic is that Mitchell's structure of comparison forces her to contain psychoanalysis-eliminating its most radical discovery, that of the unconscious-so that it becomes homologous with feminism. Though Mitchell's project is ostensibly to "supple- ment" feminism with psychoanalysis, Gallop argues that Mitchell instead, as it were, hems the latter to make it a perfect fit for feminism: "By containing the goals of the feminism she would supplement by psychoanalysis inside the bounds of the feminism she is interrogating, Mitchell abandons the radical subversion of the traditional notion of a self that is whole unto itself" [DS 12]. Hence, a metaphorical relation becomes estab- lished. For Gallop, Mitchell's alignment of "ethical discourse" ("prescription for action") with theoretical, psychological discourse, elides precisely what is different about psycho- analysis, the "specificity of the something" in the "something like" relation (see above, page 00): "If she can banish desire from ethical discourse, that discourse can be as lucid, as infallible, as the psychological theory" [12]. Thus, Gallop's critical reading of Mitchell reveals, like Genette's celebratory reading of Proust, that an assumption of contained continuity (Mitchell's acceptance of "the traditional notion of a self that is whole unto itself")9 makes possible metaphoric compari- sons that lead to totalizing perfections. What occurs in Mitchell's attempt to relate psy- choanalysis and feminism in a process Paul de Man describes, in his own reading of Proust in Allegories of Reading, as "the symmetry of the totalizing chiasmus," in which Marcel's indoor reading borrows by analogy (an analogy supported by a hidden me- tonym) the vitality and authority of outside action and in return confers its own whole- ness on that otherwise fragmentary outside action: "If repose can be hot and active without however losing its distinctive virtue of tranquility, then the 'real' activity can lose its fragmentary and dispersed quality, and become whole without having to be any less real" [66]. Similarly, Gallop describes how in Mitchell's account feminism lends psychoan- alytic theory political relevance and in return acquires that theory's lucidity. Unified and coherent feminist activism re-emphasizes the necessity, in order to make more perfect the symmetry of the chiasmic exchange, of a psychoanalysis that assumes the possibility of a self-contained subject. In contrast to Mitchell's "mystical fusion" of ethical and theoretical discourse, Gallop would strive for "a provocative contact which opens each to what is not encompassed by the limits of its identity" [DS 12]. Gallop begins both The Daughter's Seduction and Reading Lacan with a critique of Anglo-American feminism as naive about psychoanaly- sis's discoveries regarding the divided subject and, especially, language. In response to an open letter in Signs suggesting that "women's studies" is a "misnomer" for the feminist academic project, Gallop writes, "the discrepancy between the theoretical rejection of patriarchal identity and the confusion on the issue of naming is the sign ... of our actually inhabiting a relation to language that makes a tremendous irony of the assertion: 'Let us choose our names with accuracy and purpose'" [RL 14]. Women (and men) "in- habit" a relation, both live inside and have living within them the language Gallop else- where calls "our inscription into patriarchy" [DS 47]. To have any chance of effecting change, feminism must become cognizant of our inextricable entanglement with the language of the patriarchy. Gallop's critique of Mitchell, at the start of The Daughter's Seduction, is in crucial places similarly focused on the question of language. Of Mitchell's statement that, "when the potentialities of the complexities of capitalism . . . are released by its overthrow, new structures will gradually come to be represented in the unconscious. It is the task of feminism to insist on their birth" [13], Gallop would ask about the unconscious of the feminist who can "insist on the birth" of "new structures" in the unconscious: "Are the actions of this subject not affected by the unconscious? 9Gallop points out in Reading Lacan that it is crucial that Lacan's description of the divided subject be understood neither as two continuous parts (that would in fact mean whole, not divided) nor as two separate, absolutely differentiated parts (hence assimilable because of the possibility that they would become homologous and so "identical,' form a self-contained identity): 'The 'on' in Lacan's text is divided, but the division never creates two clearly separable subjects with different names, different identities" [156]. 26</page><page sequence="14">If the structures in the unconscious were linked to the structural fact of articulat- ing oneself through language- whose inception is both the beginning of society in general and of the self which is culturally constituted-perhaps it would not be so easy for Mitchell to revert to a formulation that makes the unconscious as internal culture a mere reflection of an actual, historical society, if not contemporary then past. [13; my italics] What Gallop is here criticizing as a "reversion" on Mitchell's part is a corollary to the latter's totalizing symmetry of activism and theory. Mitchell makes the "internal culture" of the unconscious only analogous to patriarchal capitalism. In Mitchell's formulation, the unconscious is a "mere reflection" of the capitalist stage of development. For Gallop, it is essential that the unconscious be seen not only as homologous to culture but, crucially, as "linked" to society by language. Because its "inception is both the beginning of society in general and of the self which is culturally constituted," language can be the linking agent, the link that itself makes visible a metonymic chain entangling the unconscious and patriarchal capitalism together. Although I noted before that for Gallop, patriarchy and women must be seen as touching each other at every point, it is actually language that, touching both society and self, makes them contiguous with one another. Like the metonymy with the patient's experiences that is necessary if psychoanalytic transference is to have a chance of being effective (see above, page 00), it is crucial here that the mediating contiguity of language implies some possibility of discontinuity, hope for change. Mitchell's program for revolution, in contrast, is self-contradictory insofar as it fixes the unconscious in a static relation of identity with patriarchal capitalism.'0 If it is possible to map language as the specific metonymic route "linking" women and patriarchy at the beginning of The Daughter's Seduction, at the end of the book it similarly becomes possible to say with more precision what it might be that touches both the patient's analytic transference and her life, what exactly constitutes the contiguity neces- sary for psychoanalysis to be effective. In her reading of Freud's Dora case, Gallop associ- ates Freud's position vis-a-vis Dora and her family with that of the family's maid: "Freud is being paid by Dora's family; he is the servant . . [DS 142]. This "identification between Freud and a governess, maid or nurse is not restricted to the confines of the Dora case, but has a decisive, structural relation to psychoanalysis in general" The exchange of money structuring the psychoanalytic situation is always crucial; it is what makes possible the patient's recognition that her transference is not "real": Transference is not peculiar to psychoanalysis, but is actually the structure of all love. Even the relation to the father, Freud discovered, is already actually a trans- ference of mother-love onto the father. What distinguishes psychoanalytic trans- ference from other relations is the possibility of analyzing the transference, of being aware of the emotions as a repetition, as inappropriate to context.... What facilitates the recognition of the feeling as transference, as an inappropriate repetition, is the fact that the analyst is paid. The money proves that the analyst is only a stand-in. [143] Money is what connects the analytic transference to the patient's present life, stops it from being a "mere reflection" of past transferences. That Freud is paid by his patients is what makes psychoanalytic transference a "doing differently," gives it a chance of being resolved. Just as recognition of the "structural fact of articulating oneself through lan- guage" is essential if feminism is not to "revert" to imaginary formulations about the relation of the unconscious and patriarchy, so the "structural fact" of psychoanalysis, what might be thought of as its "material conditions," is that the patient always pays the analyst; that is what prevents the analytic transference from "reverting" to the imaginary. Gallop emphasizes that "the absolute importance of the economic transaction between patient and analyst has been repeatedly stressed by analytic theory" [146]. It is not difficult to see '"Cynthia Chase suggested to me what precisely about Mitchell's formulation here is self- contradictory. diacritics/ winter 1986 27</page><page sequence="15">that language and money occupy analogous positions-as metonyms-in homologous structures for Gallop. It is the recognition of the structuring role of each in, respectively, political formulations and psychoanalytic transference that constitutes the only way ei- ther politics or psychoanalysis can possibly effect change. Language is the vital link making visible the contiguity of the individual psyche and culture, and money is the link in the beneficial chain connecting the transference and the patient's life. It is insufficient, however, to see that the effective dimension of both feminism and psychoanalysis is in both cases the metonymic. If money and language occupy identical positions in parallel structures, even if those positions are equivalently metonymical within each structure, the further challenge is to understand how those structures them- selves do what is geometrically defined as impossible for parallel lines: touch one an- other. One somewhat obvious intersection in Gallop's work of money and language is the economics of book publishing. The French press "des femmes," publishers of Helene Cixous's Portrait de Dora, represents for Gallop "general circulation" and "dispersal," an economic structure that "breaks the circle of the family, bursts the cell walls." For Gallop, the publisher is "a term that represents a class" [DS 148]. Although I noted above that both The Daughter's Seduction and Reading Lacan begin with a critique of feminism as not cognizant of language, the first words of each book, after the table of contents, are actually the "Acknowledgments": "I would like to thank the John Simon Guggenheim Foundation, Miami University, and the Center for Twentieth Century Studies, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee [the Acknowledgments for The Daughter's Seduction do not include the Guggenheim Foundation], for financial support for this book." The cover of Reading Lacan makes especially explicit this intersection of the material and the discur- sive: it is a photograph of Peggy Guggenheim, a famous financial patron of the arts and associated with the Guggenheim Foundation that supported Reading Lacan. Guggenheim is seated in a plush chamber looking at a book on a table. But another, perhaps less obvious, area of contiguity between words and things is Gallop's emphasis on what she calls "the letter of the text"' Language has been commonly recognized in recent years to be a system founded on exchange. Signifiers must be able to replace a signified and one another for language to work. The economy of this system, the rules of exchange, is what structural linguistics takes as its project to discover. The attention Gallop pays, in contrast, to the "materiality of the signifier" attends more to the sensuous dimensions of words. Gallop's materiality of the signifier must be, of course, always already intricated with the exchange of signifiers but there is, nonetheless, a crucial question of emphasis: The gesture with which I began my reading of Mitchell's book, the gesture of attending to the "and" the gesture of paying attention to small details is not simply some external methodological device, but is the very stuff of what I am trying to advance as a psychoanalytic, feminist reading. Lacan would call it attention to the letter. Feminists might call it attention to context, to materiality, which refuses the imperialistic, idealizing reductions that have been solidary with a denigration of the feminine- material, localized, at home, in situ - in favor of the masculine- active, ideal, in movement, away from the home. [DS 92] Though Gallop does not phrase it thus, it may be that the emphasis of structural linguis- tics on the rules governing the exchange of signifiers, like capitalism which Marx criticizes for privileging exchange-value at the expense of use-value and labor-value, is "solidary" with imperialist idealizing." Gallop would not deny the founding role of exchange in language, but she would shift attention and the privileging attention implies to "the very stuff'" the "material, localized, at home, in situ" dimensions of the signifier. It is perhaps "Describing Lacan's formula for signification (S/s), Gallop notes "the signifier is capital, and it is on top" [RL 120]. Although she is referring to Lacan's representing the signifier (as opposed to the signified) with an upper-case letter, Gallop's sentence also recalls the power of capital, which capitalists (whom Marx frequently figures as "sitting on top" of or otherwise above workers and the means of production) accumulate in surplus-value achieved through exchange. 28</page><page sequence="16">possible to understand the "materiality of the signifier" as those dimensions of a word which are neither apart from (definitive separation implying the possibility of language in a metaphoric relation to-a reflection of-what it signifies) nor those dimensions that are a part of (like the privileged continuity of mother and child) the word's "use" A signifier's materiality is the "word-thing" on which Abraham's and Torok's patients sometimes liter- ally choke. It is curious, though, that if The Daughter's Seduction closes with a statement of the critical role played in psychoanalysis by the financial arrangement, an acknowledgment of psychoanalysis's material conditions, of the necessity (though again not phrased in these words) that if transference is always the "register of desire;' then analysis should be the cash register of desire, such a recognition is absent from Reading Lacan, a book primarily about Gallop's "reading transference" onto Lacan. The Daughter's Seduction argues that because, for example, Freud used to raise money to support the Wolf-Man, the latter "is the classic case of a patient who never resolved the transference, who remained 'Freud's Wolf-Man' for the rest of his life." "How,' Gallop asks in the earlier book, "can the transference be analyzed if the economic rupture of the imaginary is sutured .. " [DS 146]? As the question of feminism is given less explicit emphasis throughout the later book, so the question of money seems to have been utterly forgotten by Reading Lacan. Although Gallop discusses many facets of her transference onto Lacan's text as the "sub- ject presumed to know," and poses her own book as a "working through" of that transfer- ence, she never mentions the fee. As at the close of The Daughter's Seduction, where she reads the Dora case, Gallop is concerned at the close of Reading Lacan with the relationship of patient and analyst, in this case herself and Lacan's text. Instead of money, however, Gallop's discussion here centers on the status of knowledge: "The subject at stake ... is the subject of knowledge, the subject who knows" [RL 159]. Aligning three subjects traditionally presumed to know-the father, God, and the author-Gallop takes from Lacan's essay, "The Subversion of the Subject and the Dialectic of Desire in the Freudian Unconscious," the concept of the subverted subject, repre- sented by a barred S (S): "Lacan refers to this as the 'fading subject,' still there but on its way to disappearing;" [RL 176]. A "fading subject" is "ambiguously situated" (metonymi- cally, in fact) between a subject presumed to know and a subject presumed dead, beyond the desire for knowledge. Just as, for Lacan, "the true formula of atheism is that God is unconscious" so that saying God is dead is a defense against true atheism [159], for Gallop, contemporary critical theory's pronouncement that the author is dead may be "a defense against something more threatening-a fading author, for example, an author who is neither wholly present, nor master of desire" [182]. This is how Gallop would choose to read Lacan, as a fading author, a subverted subject ($), not absent but under erasure, "still there but on its way to disappearing" [176]. In the last words of the book, she writes: To read as if Lacan were simply dead would be to protect his mastery... As I close my book on Lacan I feel that he and I are neither properly dead nor properly married (the only true endings for books).... Desire is not yet calmed. I do not possess him, to either marry or bury. He is still fading, not faded yet. But my eyes are open. If I have not perfectly mastered Lacan, at least I can read ... the letter of desire which spoils the perfect mastery of the dead author. [185]'2 "Still fading, not faded yet," is how Gallop would choose to conclude the discussion of her "reading transference," how she would address the subject of that transference. The phrases "but my eyes are open" and "at least" imply that among her options Gallop has found that the most profitable way to work through her transference is by employing Lacan's concept of the subverted subject ($). But what about the economic transaction '2That The Daughter's Seduction's specific dynamic of revealed desire, there occurring between the metaphoric "daughter" (feminism) and "father" (psychoanalysis), is here exactly re-inscribed as the relation of Jane Gallop and Lacan's text emphasizes that the later book, though dependent on the metaphoric structure of the earlier book, represents a move to metonymy ("the personal' "realism"). diacritics / winter 1986 29</page><page sequence="17">that, in what seemed a "true ending" to her earlier book, Gallop named as necessary "for psychoanalysis to be a locus of radical contestation"? What about the material conditions of analysis that make its transference different from any other? It appears we are here speaking only about authors, texts, reading, the domain of language; the money meton- ymy seems to have disappeared. What happened to the fee the analysand pays the subject of her transference, the fee that links that transference to the patient's present and past life? "At least I can read . . . the letter of desire" Maybe reading the letter, attending to "the materiality of the signifier" for the concept of the subverted subject is itself the only way to refind the crucial intersection of the material and the discursive, to return money to the discussion of the fading author.
