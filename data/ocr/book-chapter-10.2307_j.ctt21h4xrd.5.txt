The limitations of both space and the  author required a narrowing and sharpening of the focus; consequently, this  essay will concentrate on high culture, on disciplines which many medieval  and early modern Jews regarded as central to their intellectual profile and  which they often saw as crucial or problematic (and sometimes both) for  — 21 — </page> <page sequence="2"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response the understanding of Judaism itself. Such disciplines usually included  philosophy and the sciences, sometimes extended to poetry, and on at least  one occasion embraced history as well. The net remains very widely cast,  but it does not take all of culture as its province. Not only does this approach limit the scope of the pursuits to be  examined; it also excludes large segments of the medieval and early  modern Jewish populace from consideration. Thus, I have not addressed  the difficult and very important question of the cultural profile of women,  who very rarely received the education needed for full participation in  elite culture, nor have I dealt with the authors of popular literature or  the bearers of folk beliefs. Paradoxically, however, the narrower focus also has the effect of  enlarging the scope of the analysis. The issue before us is not merely  whether or not a particular individual or community affirmed the value  of a broad curriculum. The profounder question is how the pursuit of  philosophy and other disciplines affected the understanding of Judaism  and its sacred texts. Few questions cut deeper in the intellectual history  of medieval and early modern Jewry, and while our central focus must  remain the affirmation or rejection of an inclusive cultural agenda, the  critical implications of that choice will inevitably permeate every facet  of the discussion.  THE DYNAMICS OF A DILEMMA The medieval Jewish pursuit of philosophy and the sciences was marked  by a creative tension strikingly illustrated in a revealing paradox. The  justifications, even the genuine motivations, for this pursuit invoked  considerations of piety that lie at the heart of Judaism, and yet Jews  engaged in such study only in the presence of the external stimulus of a  vibrant non-Jewish culture. Although major sectors of medieval Jewry  believed that a divine imperative required the cultivation of learning in  the broadest sense, an enterprise shared with humanity at large could  not be perceived as quintessentially Jewish. Thus, even Jews profoundly  committed to a comprehensive intellectual agenda confronted the  unshakable instinct that it was the Torah that constituted Torah,  while they simultaneously affirmed their conviction, often confidently,  sometimes stridently, occasionally with acknowledged ambivalence,  — 22 — </page> <page sequence="3"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  that Jewish learning can be enriched by wider pursuits and that in the  final analysis these pursuits are themselves Torah. On the other side of  the divide stood those who saw “external wisdom” as a diversion from  Torah study at best and a road to heresy at worst, and yet the religious  arguments that such wisdom is not at all external often made their mark  even among advocates of the insular approach. The dynamic interplay of  these forces across a broad spectrum of Jewish communities makes the  conflict over the issue of general culture a central and intriguing leitmotif  of Jewish history in medieval and early modern times. THE ISLAMIC MIDDLE EAST AND THE GEONIM The first cultural centers of the Jewish Middle Ages were those of Middle  Eastern Jewry under Islam, and the Islamic experience was crucial in  molding the Jewish response to the challenge of philosophical study. In  the seventh century, nascent Islam erupted out of the Arabian peninsula  into a world of highly developed cultures. Had this been the typical  conquest of an advanced society by a relatively backward people, we  might have expected the usual result of victi victoribus leges dederunt:  as in the case of the barbarian conquerors of the Roman Empire or the  ninth- and tenth-century invaders of Christian Europe, the vanquished  would have ultimately imposed their cultural patterns, in however  attenuated a form, upon the victors. The Islamic invasion, however, was  fundamentally different. The Muslim armies fought in the name of an  idea, and a supine adoption of advanced cultures would have robbed the  conquest of its very meaning. At the same time, a blithe disregard of  those cultures bordered on the impossible. Consequently, Islam, which  was still in an inchoate state in the early stages of its contact with the  Persian, Byzantine, and Jewish worlds, and whose founder had already  absorbed a variety of influences, embarked upon a creative confrontation  that helped to mold its distinctive religious culture. The legacy of classical antiquity was transmitted to the Muslims by  a Christian society that had grappled for centuries with the tensions  between the values and doctrines of biblical revelation and those of  Greek philosophy and culture. For the Fathers of the Church, there was  no avoiding this difficult and stimulating challenge. As intellectuals  living in the heart of Greco-Roman civilization, they were by definition  — 23 — </page> <page sequence="4"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response immersed in its culture. The very tools with which patristic thinkers  approached the understanding of their faith were forged in the crucible  of the classical tradition, so that the men who molded and defined the  central doctrines of Christianity were driven by that tradition even as  they strove to transcend it. This was true even of those Fathers who  maintained a theoretical attitude of unrelieved hostility toward the legacy  of Athens, and it was surely the case for patristic figures who accepted  and sometimes even encouraged the cultivation of philosophy and the  literary arts provided that those pursuits knew their place.1 As Muslims began to struggle with this cultural challenge, a broad  spectrum of opinion developed regarding the desirability of philosophical  speculation. To suspicious conservatives, “reason” was a seductress; to  traditionalist theologians, she was a dependable handmaiden, loyally  demonstrating the validity of the faith; to the more radical philosophers, she  was the mistress and queen whose critical scrutiny was the final determinant  of all truth and falsehood.2 Jews in the Islamic world confronted a similar  1 Despite—or precisely because of—its excessively enthusiastic description of patristic  humanism, the rather old discussion in E. K. Rand, Founders of the Middle Ages, 2nd ed.  (Cambridge, Mass., 1941), provides the most stimulating reminder of the importance  of this issue to the Fathers of the Church. 2 For an account of the Muslim absorption of “the legacy of Greece, Alexandria, and  the Orient,” which began with the sciences and turned toward philosophy by the third  quarter of the eighth century, see Majid Fakhry, A History of Islamic Philosophy (New  York and London, 1983), pp. 1-36. Note especially p. xix, where Fakhry observes that  “the most radical division caused by the introduction of Greek thought was between  the progressive element, which sought earnestly to subject the data of revelation to the  scrutiny of philosophical thought, and the conservative element, which disassociated  itself altogether from philosophy on the ground that it was either impious or  suspiciously foreign. This division continued to reappear throughout Islamic history  as a kind of geological fault, sundering the whole of Islam.”  In describing the manifestations of this rough division in a Jewish context, I have  succumbed to the widespread convention of utilizing the admittedly imperfect  term rationalist to describe one of these groups. As my good friend Professor Mark  Steiner has pointed out, philosophers use this term in a far more precise, technical  sense in an altogether different context. Intellectual historians, he argues, have not  only misappropriated it but often use it in a way that casts implicit aspersions on  traditionalists who are presumably resistant to reason. Let me indicate, then, that  by rationalist I mean someone who values the philosophical works of non-Jews or  of Jews influenced by them, who is relatively open to the prospect of modifying  the straightforward understanding (and in rare cases rejecting the authority) of  accepted Jewish texts and doctrines in light of such works, and who gravitates toward  naturalistic rather than miraculous explanation. As the remainder of this essay will  make abundantly clear, I do not regard this as a rigid, impermeable classification. — 24 — </page> <page sequence="5"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  range of choices, but what was perhaps most important was that they  faced those choices in partnership with the dominant society. In ancient  times, the philosophical culture was part of a pagan world that stood in  stark opposition to Jewish beliefs. Under such circumstances, committed  Jews faced the alternatives of unqualified rejection of that civilization or  a lonely struggle to come to grips with the issues that it raised. Although  the philosophical culture of antiquity retained its dangers for medieval  Jews under Islam, the culture with which they were in immediate contact  confronted the legacy of the past in a fashion that joined Muslims and  Jews in a common philosophic quest. Needless to say, there were fundamental, substantive reasons for  addressing these issues, but it is likely that the very commonality of  the enterprise served as an additional attraction for Jews. Members  of a subjected minority might well have embraced the opportunity  to join the dominant society in an intellectual quest that was held in  the highest esteem. This consideration operated with respect to many  religiously neutral facets of culture from poetry to linguistics to the  sciences. It was especially true of philosophy, which succeeded in  attaining supreme religious significance while retaining its religious  neutrality. Among the multiplicity of arguments that one hears from  Jews opposed to philosophical study, the assertion that it involves  the imitation of a specifically Muslim practice played no role precisely  because the problems addressed were undeniably as central to Judaism  as they were to Islam. The existence of a religiously neutral or semi-neutral cultural sphere  is critically important for Jewish participation in the larger culture. The  virtual absence of such a sphere in Northern Europe before the high  Middle Ages—and to a certain degree even then—ruled out extensive  Ashkenazic involvement in the elite culture of Christendom and may  well have been the critical factor in charting the divergent courses of  Ashkenazim and Sephardim. The issue, of course, is not religious neutrality  alone. During the formative period of Middle Eastern and Iberian Jewry,  the surrounding civilization was dazzling, vibrant, endlessly stimulating.  During the formative years of Ashkenazic Jewry, the Christian society of  the North was primitive, culturally unproductive, and stimulated little  more than the instinct for self-preservation.3 3 Historians of the Carolingian Renaissance and other scholars who have rendered the  — 25 — </page> <page sequence="6"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response These central considerations were reinforced by a linguistic factor. In  the Muslim orbit, the language of culture and the language of the street  were sufficiently similar that access to one provided access to the other.  By the end of the first millennium, Arabic had become the language of  most Jews living under Islam, and mastery of the alphabet was sufficient  to open the doors to an advanced literary culture. In Northern Europe  this was not the case. Knowledge of German or even of early French did  not provide access to Latin texts, and the study of such texts had to be  preceded by a conscious decision to learn a new language. The Jewish intellectual and mercantile class under Islam did not  merely know the rudiments of the language. The letters of Jewish  merchants that have survived in the Cairo Genizah are written in a good  Arabic style, which must reflect familiarity with some Arabic literature.4  The stylistic evidence is reinforced by the use of expressions from the  Quran and hadith. In tenth-century Mosul, a group of Jewish merchants  convened regularly to study the Bible from a philosophical perspective.5  This level of knowledge underscores an additional, crucial point about  the relationship between the cultural level of a dominant civilization  and the degree to which Jews will be integrated into their environment.  In a relatively backward society, any outsider can achieve economic  success without attaining more than a superficial familiarity with alien  modes of thought. In an advanced culture, maintaining ignorance while  achieving success requires enormous dedication to both objectives; it  may be possible, as some contemporary examples indicate, but it is  extraordinarily difficult. The upper echelons of medieval Muslim society  term Dark Ages obsolete will no doubt take umbrage at this description, but even on a  generous reading of the evidence, cultural activity took place within such narrow circles  that I do not think apologies are necessary. For an overview and reassessment of the  current status of research on early medieval Europe, see the discussion and extensive  bibliography in Richard E. Sullivan, “The Carolingian Age: Reflections on its Place in  the History of the Middle Ages,” Speculum 64 (1989): 267-306.  For some observations on the importance of a neutral cultural sphere under Islam, see  Joseph M. Davis, “R. Yom Tov Lipman Heller, Joseph b. Isaac Ha-Levi, and Rationalism  in Ashkenazic Jewish Culture 1550-1650” (Harvard University dissertation, 1990), pp.  26-27. (Davis’s dissertation, which I shall have occasion to cite again in the section on  Ashkenazic Jewry, was submitted after this essay was substantially completed.) 4 See S. D. Goitein, A Mediterranean Society 2 (Berkeley, 1971), pp. 180-181. This is not  to say that every Jewish merchant could read Arabic (cf. p. 179). 5 See Haggai ben Shammai, “Hug le-‘Iyyun Pilosofi ba-Miqra be-Mosul ba-Me’ah ha-  ‘Asirit,” Pe‘amim 41 (Autumn, 1989): 21-31. — 26 — </page> <page sequence="7"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  valued cultural sophistication, and a Jew who wanted access to the  movers and shakers of that society even for purely pragmatic reasons  could not allow himself to remain unfamiliar with its language, its  literature, and its thought. This is true not only for merchants; communal  leaders who wanted to lobby for essential Jewish interests also required a  sophisticated command of the surrounding culture, and the phenomenon  of the acculturated Jewish courtier, which reached maturity in Spain, was  born in this environment. Familiarity with Arabic language and literature exercised a significant  influence on the development of a new phase in the history of Hebrew  poetry and prose. Here too the primary locus of this achievement was  Muslim Spain, where Hebrew literature attained dazzling heights, but  the beginnings were clearly rooted in the Geonic Middle East. Not  surprisingly, the most significant figure in this development was R.  Saadya Gaon, whose works often follow Arabic models and who explicitly  expressed admiration for the accomplishments of the dominant culture,  and there is reason to believe that the Gaon refined and embellished a  new literary trend that had already begun in the Jewish communities in  Egypt and Israel.6 Another pursuit which combined intellectual sophistication, prestige,  integration into the larger society, and economic success was medicine.  Medical education could be obtained privately and was part of any  advanced curriculum, and so no significant impediment limited minority  access to the field. Moreover, the service provided by a physician is so  crucial that any tendency to discriminate will be brushed aside by the all- powerful will to live; it is no accident that those who wished to discourage  the use of Jewish doctors in Christian Europe could do so only by instilling  the fear of death by poison. It is consequently perfectly natural that both  religious minorities in the Muslim world entered the medical profession  to a degree that was entirely disproportionate to their numbers; by  the thirteenth century, this phenomenon was sufficiently striking to  impel a Muslim visitor to observe that most of the prominent Jews and  Christians in Egypt were either government officials or physicians.7 6 See the eloquent remarks of Ezra Fleisher in his “Hirhurim bi-Devar Ofyah shel Shirat  Yisrael bi-Sefarad,” Pe‘amim 2 (Summer, 1979): 15-20, and especially in his “Tarbut Yehudei  Sefarad ve-Shiratam le-Or Mimze’ei ha-Genizah,” Pe‘amim 41 (Autumn, 1989): 5-20. 7 Goitein, A Mediterranean Society 2, pp. 242-243, 247-250. See also Goitein’s “The  Medical Profession in the Light of the Cairo Genizah Documents,” Hebrew Union College  — 27 — </page> <page sequence="8"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response The flexible character of the educational system was not confined  to medicine. The absence of governmental or communal control as  the Islamic world was formulating its approach to the philosophical  enterprise meant that no societal decision had to be made about proper  curriculum, and diverse approaches could therefore coexist without  formalized pressure for homogenization. In twelfth- and thirteenth- century Northern Europe, when medieval Christians first confronted the  issue of philosophical study seriously, the situation was quite different.  Ecclesiastical control of cathedral schools and the nascent universities  created a more homogeneous position, which both legitimated and  limited the philosophic quest. Thus, despite the persistence of diversity  even in the Christian West, one can speak of a quasi-official, religiously  domesticated philosophical approach, while Muslims and Jews faced an  array of possibilities in which virtually no option was foreclosed. It is hardly surprising, then, that the atmosphere of tenth-century  Baghdad, which was the intellectual as well as political capital of the  newly matured Muslim civilization, resonated with a bewildering variety  of fiercely argued philosophical and religious doctrines. Two scholars  attempting to convey a sense of the environment in which R. Saadya  Gaon worked have reproduced a striking description which is well worth  citing once again. A Muslim theologian who visited Baghdad explained  why he stopped attending mass meetings for theological debate: At the first meeting there were present not only people of various [Islamic]  sects, but also unbelievers, Magians, materialists, atheists, Jews and  Christians, in short, unbelievers of all kinds. Each group had its own leader,  whose task it was to defend its views, and every time one of the leaders  entered the room, his followers rose to their feet and remained standing  until he took his seat. In the meanwhile, the hall had become overcrowded  with people. One of the unbelievers rose and said to the assembly: we are  meeting here for a discussion. Its conditions are known to all. You, Muslims,  are not allowed to argue from your books and prophetic traditions since we  deny both. Everybody, therefore, has to limit himself to rational arguments.  The whole assembly applauded these words. So you can imagine... that after  these words I decided to withdraw. They proposed to me that I should attend  another meeting in a different hall, but I found the same calamity there.8 Annual 34 (1963): 177-194. 8 Cited from Journal Asiatique, ser. 5, vol. 2 (1853): 93 by M.

In R. Saadya’s  Book of Beliefs and Opinions, we find the first major philosopher of the  Jewish Middle Ages arguing for the legitimacy of philosophical speculation  against explicit criticism of the entire enterprise. Any attempt to assess  the size and standing of the various parties to this dispute during the  Geonic period faces serious obstacles. Saadya himself cited the argument  that philosophical study bore the seeds of heresy and maintained that this  position is proffered only by the uneducated.9 Salo Baron has dismissed  Saadya’s assertion as “whistling in the dark.”10 Even if the Gaon’s  assessment does not result from wishful thinking alone, we cannot easily  use it to determine the extent and character of the opposition since it  may reflect Saadya’s conviction that anyone making this argument is  uneducated virtually by definition. At the same time, the passage is not  historically useless. For all of Saadya’s confidence, polemical aggressiveness,  and exalted communal standing, I doubt that he could have written this  sentence if recent Geonim or highly influential figures in the yeshivot had  maintained a vehement, public stand against philosophical study. On the  level of public policy in Saadya’s Baghdad, philosophical speculation was  either encouraged or treated with salutary neglect. The introduction to The Book of Beliefs and Opinions vigorously sets  forth some of the basic arguments for this pursuit: [The reader] who strives for certainty will gain in certitude, and doubt will  be lifted from the doubter, and he that believes by sheer authority will  come to believe out of insight and understanding. By the same token the  gratuitous opponent will come to a halt, and the conceited adversary will  feel ashamed. The conviction that philosophical certainty is attainable and that  reasoned faith is superior to faith based on tradition alone underlies  York and Philadelphia, 1960), part II, pp. 13-14. At the same time, the authorities did  have a sort of inquisitorial mechanism for the enforcement of correct belief. 9 Saadia Gaon, The Book of Beliefs and Opinions, translated by Samuel Rosenblatt (New  Haven, 1948), Introductory Treatise, p. 26. 10 A Social and Religious History of the Jews 8 (New York, 1958), p. 69. Baron (pp. 67- 68) also cites a ninth-century Muslim who maintained that Jews were uninvolved in  scientific pursuits because they considered “philosophical speculation to be unbelief.” — 29 — </page> <page sequence="10"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response this argument and reflects the views of the Muslim mutakallimun  whose approach Saadya shared. Indeed, he anticipated the assertions  of later Jewish thinkers by maintaining that the Bible itself requires  such investigation. Isaiah, after all, proclaimed, “Do you not know?  Do you not hear?... Have you not understood the foundations of the  earth?” (40:21). And the Book of Job records the admonition, “Let us  know among ourselves what is good” (34:4). Not only does Saadya take  the term know as a reference to the understanding that results from  philosophical speculation; he is so convinced of this that he regards these  verses as decisive evidence that the talmudic rabbis could not possibly  have intended to ban such speculation when they forbade investigation  into “what is above and what is below, what is before and what is behind”  (M. Hagigah 2:1).11 Saadya’s confidence that reason can yield certainty is strikingly  illustrated by his application to philosophy of a talmudic statement whose  primary context was clearly that of Jewish law. The Rabbis inform us that  legal questions used to be settled through an appeals process leading up  to the high court in Jerusalem, but “ever since the number of disciples  of Hillel and Shammai increased who did not attend scholars sufficiently,  many disagreements have arisen in lsrael”(Tosefta Sanhedrin 7:1). “This  utterance of theirs,” says Saadya, speaking of the benefits of philosophical  speculation, “indicates to us that when pupils do complete their course  of study, no controversy or discord arises among them.”12 It is difficult to  argue against the sort of inquiry that is sure to lead to piety and truth. Nonetheless, not everyone shared Saadya’s certainty. The greatest of  the Geonim other than Saadya was undoubtedly R. Hai, who flourished  in the late tenth and early eleventh centuries. In some respects, his views  on these issues paralleled those of Saadya. He permitted Jewish teachers  to instruct children in mathematics and the art of writing Arabic, and  in the same ruling he agreed to allow non-Jewish children to study in  the synagogue (presumably with Jewish students) if there is no way  to prevent this without jeopardizing peaceful neighborly relations. As  Shlomo Dov Goitein has pointed out, it would appear to follow that  considerable time might be devoted to subjects other than Torah.13 11 Beliefs and Opinions, pp. 9, 27. 12 Beliefs and Opinions, p. 13. 13 Goitein, A Mediterranean Society 2, p. 177. At the same time Goitein notes that genizah  evidence does not indicate much formal study of arithmetic on the elementary level  — 30 — </page> <page sequence="11"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  A famous report informs us that R. Hai sent a student to consult the  Christian catholikos for assistance in understanding a biblical verse, and  while this does not bear directly on the question of general culture, it  reflects habits of mind that might well lead to a willingness to explore  beyond the boundaries of classical Jewish texts.14 At the same time, R. Hai had reservations about the results of  philosophical study, and our assessment of his reservations depends  to a critical extent on the authenticity of an important letter that he  reportedly addressed to R. Samuel ibn Nagrela of Spain. The letter itself  has come down to us in several versions. In the central passage that  appears in all the sources, R. Hai admonishes R. Samuel to know that what improves the body and guides human behavior properly  is the pursuit of the Mishnah and Talmud; this is what is good for Israel....  Anyone who removes his attention from these works and instead pursues  those other studies will totally remove the yoke of Torah from himself.  As a consequence of such behavior, a person can so confuse his mind that  he will have no compunctions about abandoning Torah and prayer. If you  should see that the people who engage in such study tell you that it is a  paved highway through which one can attain the knowledge of God, pay no  attention to them. Know that they are in fact lying to you, for you will not  find fear of sin, humility, purity, and holiness except in those who study  Torah, Mishnah, and Talmud. A longer version of the letter preserved in the thirteenth-century Sefer  Me’irat ‘Einayim of R. Isaac of Acre places the issue in a concrete historical  context. R. Hai forbids the study of higgayon, which undoubtedly means  philosophy in this letter, and urges the constant study of Talmud in  accordance with the practice of the beloved residents of Qairuwan and the lands of the Maghreb, may they  be blessed in the eyes of Heaven. Would that you knew of the confusion,  disputes, and undisciplined attitudes that entered the hearts of many  (pp. 177-178). For the text of R. Hai’s responsum, see Simcha Asaf, Meqorot le-Toledot  ha-Hinnukh be-Yisra’el 2 (Tel Aviv, 1930), pp. 4-5. 14 See Joseph ben Judah ibn Aqnin, Hitgallut ha-Sodot ve-Hofa‘at ha-Meorot: Perush Shir  ha-Shirim, ed. by A. S. Halkin (Jerusalem, 1964), p. 495.  Whatever the provenance of the poem Musar Haskel attributed to R. Hai, it is worth  noting the advice to teach one’s son a craft and to study “wisdom,” mathematics, and  medicine. See Asaf, Meqorot 2, p. 8. — 31 — </page> <page sequence="12"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response people who engaged in those studies in Baghdad in the days of ‘Adud al- Dawla [977-983] and of the doubts and disagreements that were generated  among them with respect to the foundations of the Torah to the point that  they left the boundaries of Judaism. He goes on to say that “there arose individuals in Baghdad [apparently  somewhat later] who would have been better off as Gentiles”; indeed,  they went so far that they aroused the anger of non-Jews who were  presumably concerned about the spread of philosophical heresy that  might contaminate Muslims as well. Because of the damage that this  caused, R. Hai intervened to stop these miscreants in particular and  Jewish intellectuals in general from engaging in such pursuits. The letter  goes on to assert that even the Gaon R. Samuel b. Hofni, who had read  such material, saw the damage that resulted and refrained from doing  so any longer. Since the days of Graetz, the authenticity of this document has been  the subject of scholarly debate. In the most recent discussion, two new,  conflicting considerations have been raised. On the one hand, the name  of the ruler in Baghdad is reported with a level of accuracy that might not  have been available to a late forger; on the other, the section preserved  in Me’irat ‘Einayim often uses the first person singular, while it was the  practice of the Geonim, without exception, to write in the first person  plural. If this letter in its entirety was written by R. Hai, it provides  fascinating information about extreme rationalism among Jews in late  tenth-century Baghdad and about a very strong Jewish counterreaction.  My own inclination, however, is to treat the document with considerable  skepticism. The unique appearance of the first person singular is surely  a weighty consideration, and an expert in the history of medieval Islam  assures me that ‘Adud al-Dawla’s name was not so obscure as to be  unavailable to a thirteenth-century Iberian forger (not to speak of an earlier  one) even in its precise form. The unconditional denunciation in the letter  is considerably stronger than what we would expect from R. Hai’s other  writings: there were a number of other appropriate opportunities in the  Gaon’s voluminous correspondence for him to have expressed such views,  and yet this passage remains unique; the assertion that R. Samuel ben  Hofni, for whom speculative pursuits were clearly of central importance,  would have abandoned them because of this incident is both implausible  in the extreme and reminiscent of other rereadings of history of the  — 32 — </page> <page sequence="13"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  sort that produced a document attesting to Maimonides’ late embrace  of kabbalah; and the specific reference to the abandonment of prayer,  an issue which is unattested as far as I know in this early period, echoes  similar charges in the literature of the Maimonidean controversy. Whatever the authenticity of the original document, there is an  illuminating aspect to the later textual history of this letter. One of the  versions contains a brief addition clearly introduced by a reader who  wanted to soften the antiphilosophical message of the Gaon. Where R.  Hai criticized those who “pursue those other studies,” our philosophically  oriented copyist wrote “those other studies alone,” and where R. Hai  spoke about the purity and holiness of those who study Mishnah and  Talmud, our copyist wrote that these qualities will be found only in those  who study “Mishnah, Talmud, and wisdom together, not wisdom alone.”  These revisions, which were introduced by the interpolater into a letter  of Nahmanides that quotes R. Hai, have been embraced to our own day  by scholars who welcome an attenuation of the original message. In the  event that the letter itself is inauthentic, there is a certain poetic justice  in the undermining of its central point by yet another creative artist.15 15 R. Hai’s letter is most conveniently available in Ozar ha-Geonim to Hagigah, pp. 65- 66. The most recent discussion of the problem of authenticity, which cites earlier  studies, is in Amos Goldreich’s dissertation, Sefer Me’irat ‘Einayim le-Rav Yizhaq de-min  Akko (Jerusalem, 1981; Pirsumei ha-Makhon le-Limmudim Mitqaddemim, 1984), pp.  405-407. Goldreich notes Shraga Abramson’s observation about the Geonim and the  first person plural, which was made in a different context; see Abramson, Rav Nissim  Gaon (Jerusalem, 1965), p. 307. When I raised the issue in a conversation with Prof.  Abramson, he confirmed that there are no exceptions to this usage; since R. Hai became  Gaon when Samuel ibn Nagrela was a small child, the possibility that the letter was  written before the author assumed his position must, of course, be ruled out. (In a  personal communication, Menahem Ben Sasson has suggested the possibility that a  shift from plural to singular might have taken place in the course of translation from  Arabic into Hebrew.) See too Zvi Groner in ‘Alei Sefer 13 (1986): 75, no. 1099. I am  grateful to Ulrich Haarmann, my colleague at the Annenberg Research Institute when  this essay was written, for his assessment of the degree of familiarity with ‘Adud al- Dawla in the thirteenth century.  For an example of the fortunes of the pro-philosophy version of the letter, see the  various printings of C. D. Chavel, Kitvei Rabbenu Mosheh ben Nahman (henceforth Kitvei  Ramban), beginning with Jerusalem, 1963, 1, pp. 349-350. For the initial challenge  to the letter’s authenticity, see H. Graetz, “Ein pseudoepigraphisches Sendschreiben,  angeblich von Hai Gaon an Samuel Nagid,” Monatsschrift für Geschichte und Wissenschaft  des Judenthums 11 (1862): 37-40. There is no concrete basis for Graetz’s suspicions  that the citation from R. Hai was inserted into Nahmanides’ letter by a later copyist;  consequently, if the letter is a forgery, we probably need to assume that it was produced  — 33 — </page> <page sequence="14"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response Whatever we make of the highly dubious report that R. Samuel ben  Hofni stopped perusing philosophical books as a result of a particular  incident, his study of such works is clearcut and their influence upon  him was profound. He rejected a literal understanding of the raising  of Samuel’s spirit by the witch of Endor, and according to R. Hai he  denied various miracles that the Talmud attributes to the ancient  rabbis, arguing that such miracles are associated only with prophets  and that the Talmudic reports are not “halakhah.” The point here,  if I understand the expression correctly, is not that the content of  these passages classifies them as aggadic but rather that they are not  normative in much the same way that a rejected legal position is not  normative. Here, however, normative seems synonymous with “true,”  and the utilization of this category to reject the truth of a rabbinic  narrative is striking, especially in the absence of any apparent effort  at allegorization. Indeed, the most recent study of R. Samuel’s thought  argues that his position denying these talmudic miracles stemmed from  a specifically Mu‘tazilite position on the relationship between miracles  and prophecy.16 Although various Geonim were favorably inclined toward the study  of philosophy, it is clear that the curriculum of the advanced yeshivot  was devoted to the study of Torah alone. I am unpersuaded by Goitein’s  suggestion that the reason for this was the feeling that only those whose  no later than the early months of the controversy of the 1230s and that it already  deceived Nahmanides. 16 See David Sklare, The Religious and Legal Thought of Samuel ben Hofni Gaon: Texts and  Studies in Cultural History (Harvard University dissertation, 1992), p. 74. Sklare’s  dissertation, which appeared well after the completion of this study, presents a broad  characterization of Jewish high culture in Geonic times from “extreme rationalism” to  traditionalism; see chapter four, pp. 145-210. For attitudes toward aggadah, see pp.  64-75.  On the witch of Endor, see Radaq’s discussion on I Samuel 28:25. For R. Hai’s responsum,  see Ozar ha-Geonim to Hagigah, p. 15. On R. Hai’s own reservations about the authority  of aggadah, see R. Abraham b. Isaac Av-Beit Din, Sefer ha-Eshkol, ed. by A. Auerbach  (Halberstadt, 1868), 2, p. 47. There is some confusion about R. Samuel’s views on the  talking serpent in Genesis and the talking donkey in Numbers; see the discussion in  Aaron Greenbaum, Perush ha-Torah le-Rav Shmuel ben Hofni Gaon (Jerusalem, 1979), pp.  40-41, n. 17. Whatever R. Samuel’s position may have been, there were Geonic views  that endorsed a nonliteral understanding of these accounts. For the expectation that  R. Samuel would facilitate a student’s pursuit of the sciences in addition to Mishnah  and Talmud, see I. Goldziher, “Mélanges Judéo-Arabes, XXIII,” Revue des Études Juives  50 (1905): 185, 187. — 34 — </page> <page sequence="15"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  professional training would expose them to Greek science needed the  protection afforded by the proper study of philosophy and theology. The  private nature of philosophical instruction in the society at large made it  perfectly natural for Jews to follow the same course; more important, the  curriculum of these venerable institutions went back to pre-Islamic days,  and any effort to introduce a curricular revolution into their hallowed  halls would surely have elicited vigorous opposition. In any case, the  absence of a philosophical curriculum in the academies has led to the  recent suggestion that openness to Arabic culture by the later Geonim  resulted precisely from the weakening of the yeshivot which freed  someone like R. Samuel ben Hofni from the restraints of the traditional  framework.17 We are even told in an early Geonic responsum that Bible was not  taught in the academies. R. Natronai Gaon informs us that because  of economic pressures which required students to work, the talmudic  directive (Kiddushin 30a) that one-third of one’s time be devoted to biblical  study could no longer be observed, and the students relied upon another  talmudic statement (Sanhedrin 24a) implying that Bible, Mishnah, and  Midrash are all subsumed under Talmud. One wonders whether this was  only a result of insufficient time. The all-consuming nature of talmudic  study led to a very similar conclusion among Ashkenazic Jews; moreover,  the fact that Judaism shared the Bible with Christianity and, to a degree,  with Islam may have helped to generate an instinct that this was not  a quintessentially Jewish pursuit. Only the Talmud was the special  “mystery” of the Jewish people.18 The assertion that the Jews of Qairuwan studied Torah exclusively  may well reflect their general orientation accurately. At the same time,  we have evidence of some broader pursuits. Dunash ben Tamim of tenth- century Qairuwan wrote several astronomical works, one of which he  composed to honor the local Muslim ruler, as well as a mathematical  treatise and a commentary to The Book of Creation (Sefer Yezirah).  Moreover, the famous question from Qairuwan about the composition  17 So Sklare, The Religious and Legal Thought of Samuel ben Hofni, pp. 96-99, 139-140. As  Sklare notes, R. Saadya himself was educated “outside the orbit of the Gaonic yeshivot.”  For Goitein’s remark, see A Mediterranean Society 2, p. 210. 18 For R. Natronai’s observation, see Asaf, Meqorot, p. 4. Cf.

Sherira Gaon  may have been inspired as much by an interest in history, which is also  attested in other ways, as by Karaite pressures.19 Needless to say, the  sort of interest in history that expresses itself as a question about the  Talmud is itself a manifestation of the study of Torah, but the definition  of the boundaries between the sacred and the profane is precisely what  is at issue in much of the medieval discussion of pursuits that transcend  a narrow definition of Torah. MUSLIM SPAIN AND MAIMONIDES The cultural symbiosis between Judaism and Islamic civilization grew  to maturity in the Middle East during the time of the Geonim, but its  classic expression and most dazzling achievements emerged from Muslim  Spain in the tenth, eleventh, and twelfth centuries. We have already seen  that linguistic acculturation is a precondition for such a symbiosis, and  familiarity with Arabic literature was one of the most important stimuli  to the development of a distinctive Jewish literary voice. Moses ibn Ezra’s  treatise on Jewish poetry contains a striking passage which reveals a  frank recognition of this process by medieval Jews themselves: When the Arabs conquered the Andalusian peninsula... our exiles living  in that peninsula learned the various branches of wisdom in the course  of time. After toil and effort they learned the Arabic language, became  familiar with Arabic books, and plumbed the depths of their contents; thus,  the Jews became thoroughly conversant with the branches of their wisdom  and enjoyed the sweetness of their poetry. After that, God revealed the  secrets of the Hebrew language and its grammar.20 The relationship between the study of Hebrew grammar, with all that  it implies for the development of biblical exegesis, and the knowledge of a  different Semitic language is self-evident. Medieval Jews had always known  Hebrew and Aramaic, but the addition of Arabic, with its rich vocabulary  and literature, enabled grammarians to understand the meaning of a host  19 See Menahem Ben Sasson, Hevrah ve-Hanhagah bi-Qehillot Yisrael be-Afriqah ha-Zefonit  bi-Yemei ha-Beinayim—Qairuwan, 800-1057 (Hebrew University dissertation, 1983),  pp. 179, 185-186. R. Sherira’s epistle is now available in N. D. Rabinowitch’s English  translation, The Iggeres of Rav Sherira Gaon (Jerusalem, 1988). 20 Shirat Yisrael, ed. by B. Z.

Unlocking the structure of the language provided a revolutionary  tool for the indisputably religious enterprise of understanding the Bible.  There can be no more eloquent testimony to the significance of this  development than the extensive appeal to grammatical analysis by R.  Abraham ibn Ezra, easily the greatest biblical exegete produced by the  Jewry of Muslim Spain. It is consequently both remarkable and revealing  that the greatest of medieval Jewish grammarians, Jonah ibn Janah,  alludes to Talmudists who regard the study of language as “superfluous,”  “useless,” “practically... heretical.”21 The unavoidable connection between grammatical investigations  and the study of non-Jewish works may well account for this attitude,  which continued in certain circles through the Middle Ages and persists  to our own day. It is difficult to think of any other consideration that  could account for so extreme an assertion as the imputation of virtual  heresy to grammarians. Considering the undeniable value of this pursuit  for biblical study, opposition could be expressed only by Jews who  attached little importance to the systematic study of the Bible itself  and regarded the Talmud as the only proper subject of intense, regular,  prolonged scrutiny. The denigration of biblical study, which we have  already touched upon and which also persists in the same circles to this  day, may well result not only from the fact that the Bible is shared with  non-Jews but from the inevitable contact that it fosters with gentile  scholarship and culture. A further consideration, which is not directly  related to our theme, may have been the concern that biblical study  undisciplined by the everpresent restraints of authoritative talmudic  commentary could itself lead to heretical conclusions in matters of both  theology and law. Despite this evidence of opposition, the dominant culture of Andalusian  Jewry embodied an avid pursuit not only of linguistic sophistication but  of literary expression in the fullest sense. Ahad Ha-Am long ago coined  the felicitous term competitive imitation (hiqquy shel hitharut) to describe  the motivation and character of this culture,22 and later scholars have  elaborated the point with an accumulation of evidence of which Ahad  21 Sefer ha-Riqmah, ed. by M. Wilensky (Berlin, 1929), p. v, cited in Asaf, Meqorot, 2, pp.  19-20. 22 “Hiqquy ve-Hitbolelut,” in ‘Al Parashat Derakhim, 2nd ed., 1 (Berlin, 1902), p. 175. — 37 — </page> <page sequence="18"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response Ha-Am was only dimly aware. In the words of a recent study, “Golden  Age Hebrew poetry... can be viewed as a literary discourse designed to  mediate cultural ambiguity because it signifies both the acculturation to  Arabic cultural norms and [emphasis in the original] the resistant national  consciousness of the Jewish literati who invented it.”23 Far more than ordinary intellectual competitiveness was at stake here.  The beauty of Arabic was a crucial Muslim argument for the superiority  of Islam. Since the Quran was the final, perfect revelation, it was also the  supreme exemplar of aesthetic excellence, and its language must be the  most exalted vehicle for the realization of literary perfection. When Jews  compared the richness and flexibility of Arabic vocabulary to the poverty  of medieval Hebrew, the Muslims’ argument for the manifest superiority  of their revelation undoubtedly hit home with special force. The quality  of Arabic was evident not merely from a mechanical word count or even  an analysis of the Quran; it shone from every piece of contemporary  poetry and prose. Consequently, Jews were faced with a dual challenge. First, they had  to explain the undeniable deficiencies of the vocabulary of medieval  Hebrew. For all its terrible consequences, the exile has its uses, and  Andalusian Jews maintained that the untold riches of the Hebrew  language had gradually been lost due to the travails of the dispersion. The  numerous words that appear only rarely in the Bible and whose meaning  we must struggle to decipher are but the tip of the iceberg; they testify  to a language far more impressive than the one bequeathed to us by our  immediate ancestors. Moreover, and far more important, Jews were challenged to  demonstrate that even the Hebrew at their disposal was at least as beautiful  as Arabic and that Hebrew literature could achieve every bit as much as  the literature of medieval Muslims. This created a religious motivation  to reproduce the full range of genres and subjects in the Arabic literary  repertoire, which meant that even the composition of poetry describing  parties devoted to wine, women, men, and song could be enveloped by at  least the penumbra of sanctity. There can be no question, of course, that  even if the genre was born out of apologetic roots, it took on a life of its  23 Ross Brann, “Andalusian Hebrew Poetry and the Hebrew Bible: Cultural Nationalism  or Cultural Ambiguity?” in Approaches to Judaism in Medieval Times 3, ed. by David  R. Blumenthal (Atlanta, 1988), p. 103.

Furthermore, the power and beauty of the religious poetry of the Jews  of medieval Spain were surely made possible by the creative encounter  with Arabic models. Some of the deepest and most moving expressions of  medieval Jewish piety would have been impossible without the inspiration  of the secular literature of a competing culture. Jews could have accomplished their fundamental goal by establishing  parity between Hebrew and Arabic, but such an achievement is  psychologically insufficient and polemically tenuous. Consequently, we  find the glorification of Hebrew over Arabic and the assertion, which we  shall find in other contexts as well, that Arabic culture, including music,  poetry, and rhetoric, was ultimately derived from the Jews.24 On a less exalted level, poetry also fulfilled a social function.  Businessmen had poems written in their honor which served the pragmatic  purpose of useful publicity as well as the psychological purpose of boosting  the ego. The ability to write poetry was the mark of an accomplished  gentleman, and this too encouraged the cultivation of the genre.25 As I  have already indicated in passing, the existence of the class of Jewish  courtiers created a firm social base for a Jewish literary and philosophic  culture. Jewish communities in Muslim Spain became dependent upon  the representation afforded by courtiers, and that representation was  impossible without a command of the surrounding culture. Since courtiers  came to expect poetic flattery, their presence and patronage gave the poet  both support and standing, although it hardly needs to be said that the  relationship between patron and poet is never an unmixed blessing. 24 The footnotes in Brann’s article provide a recent bibliography of the substantial work on  this theme. See especially A. S. Halkin, “The Medieval Jewish Attitude Toward Hebrew,”  in Biblical and Other Studies, ed. by Alexander Altmann (Cambridge, Mass., 1963), pp.  233-248, and Nehemiah Allony, “Teguvat R. Moshe ibn Ezra la-‘‘Arabiyya’ be-Sefer ha- Diyyunim ve-ha-Sihot (Shirat Yisrael),” Tarbiz 42 (1972/73): 97-113 (particularly the  challenge from the beauty of the Quran on p. 101). Cf. also Norman Roth, “Jewish  Reactions to the ‘Arabiyya and the Renaissance of Hebrew in Spain,” Journal of Semitic  Studies 28 (1983): 63-84.  Le-shem yihud describes a dedicatory prayer recited by later Jews before fulfilling a  religious obligation. Despite the anachronism and the resort to Hebrew, I cannot think  of a better way to make the point. 25 See S. D. Goitein, Jews and Arabs (New York, 1955), p. 162. — 39 — </page> <page sequence="20"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response Despite all this, disparagement of poetry and opposition to reliance  on Arabic models were not unknown among the Jews of Muslim Spain. In  some instances, however, even those who criticized what they perceived  as an overemphasis on language and rhetoric did not reject the enterprise  entirely, and there can be little doubt that the dominant social and  intellectual class regarded literary skill as a fundamental component of a  proper education. The ideal of adab, which roughly means general culture,  was embraced by many Jews, and the praises of a great man would point  to his mastery of the full range of medieval disciplines.26 Samuel ha-Nagid’s description of God’s kindness to him contains the  central elements to be sought in the well rounded Jewish intellectual:  “He endowed you [i.e., Samuel] with wisdom of His Scripture and His  Law, which are classified first among the sciences. He instructed you in  Greek knowledge and enlightened you in Arabic lore.”27 In this passage we  find only the most general categories of learning, and the sole hierarchy  of values places Torah above other pursuits. When the general sciences  are broken down in greater detail, a more nuanced picture emerges in  which philosophy takes pride of place while the remaining disciplines are  necessary both for their own sake and for their usefulness in preparing  the student for ever higher forms of study. As a result of this concept of  “propaedeutic studies,” virtually every field can bask in the reflected glory  of the queen of the sciences. “It is certainly necessary,” writes Maimonides, “for whoever wishes  to achieve human perfection to train himself at first in the art of logic,  then in the mathematical sciences according to the proper order, then  in the natural sciences, and after that in the divine science.”28 More  complete lists include logic, mathematics, astronomy, physics, medicine,  music, building, agriculture, and a variety of studies subsumed under  26 For references and discussion, see Bezalel Safran, “Bahya ibn Pakuda’s Attitude toward  the Courtier Class,” in Studies in Medieval Jewish History and Literature [1], ed. by Isadore  Twersky (Cambridge, Mass., 1979), pp. 154-196. For some tentative reservations  about the thesis of Safran’s article, see Amos Goldreich, “Ha-Meqorot ha-‘Arviyyim  ha-Efshariyyim shel ha-Havhanah bein ‘Hovot ha-Evarim’ ve-‘Hovot ha-Levavot’,” in  Mehqarim be-‘Ivrit u-ba-‘Aravit: Sefer Zikkaron le-Dov Eron, ed. by Aharon Dotan (Tel  Aviv, 1988), pp. 185, 199, nn. 22, 95. 27 Brann’s translation (p. 108) from Divan Shmuel ha-Nagid, ed. by Dov Yarden, 1  (Jerusalem, 1966), p. 58. 28 The Guide of the Perplexed, translated by Shlomo Pines (Chicago and London, 1963),  1:34, p. 75. — 40 — </page> <page sequence="21"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  metaphysics. So much significance was attributed to the propaedeutic  studies that one of the polemicists during the Maimonidean controversy  maintained that the only people who became heretics as a result of  reading The Guide of the Perplexed were those who came to it without  the proper preliminaries. This argument led him to a new application of  a famous Maimonidean admonition. No one, said Maimonides, should  approach the study of philosophy without first filling his stomach with  the “bread and meat” of biblical and talmudic law. In our context, says  Yosef b. Todros Halevi, that metaphor should be applied not to “the  written and oral Torah” but to the other sciences like the sciences of measurement and physics and  astronomy. These are known as the educational, pedagogic sciences...  which lead the human intellect to approach the understanding of the  divine science with a generous spirit, with passion and with affection,  so that they can be compared to this world in its capacity as a gateway to  the world to come.29 Not all philosophers assigned such weight to these preparatory  studies. Thus, Abraham ibn Daud derided excessive preoccupation  with medicine, with the “still more worthless.... art of grammar and  rhetoric,” and with “strange, hypothetical” mathematical puzzles,  when the only valuable aspect of mathematics is the one that leads to  a knowledge of astronomy. Endless concentration on the means would  steal time better devoted to the end, which clearly remained the study  of metaphysics.30 By far the most significant challenge to the prevailing ideal of the  philosophers came in R. Judah Halevi’s revolt against Andalusian Jewish  culture, a revolt so far-reaching that it actually serves to underscore  the centrality of philosophical inquiry for that culture. Halevi’s  29 Qevuzat Mikhtavim be-‘Inyenei ha-Mahaloqet ‘al Devar Sefer ha-Moreh ve-ha-Madda‘, ed.  by S. Z. H. Halberstam (Bamberg, 1875), p. 10. See Mishneh Torah, Hil. Yesodei ha-Torah  4:13.

Halevi substituted a deeply romantic, historically founded, revelation- centered, strikingly ethnocentric faith for the philosophically oriented  religion of many of his peers. At the same time, the Kuzari operates within  the matrix of medieval philosophical conceptions. Halevi could no more  rid himself of the active intellect than a contemporary religious critic of  evolution could deny the existence of atoms or DNA. More important,  the antiphilosophical position of the Kuzari is an integral part of Halevi’s  revulsion at fawning courtiers, at Jewish groveling disguising itself as  competitive imitation, at much of what “the exile of Jerusalem that is in  Spain” stood for. It is no accident that his famous line denouncing Greek  wisdom for producing flowers but no fruit and for affirming the eternity  of matter is part of a poem justifying his decision to abandon Spain for  the land of Israel. To the degree that Halevi’s position developed in stages,  there can be little doubt that the radical social critique gave birth to the  philosophical revisionism; he clearly did not decide to leave Spain as a  consequence of his rethinking of the role of philosophical speculation.  If he did, however, the point would be even stronger. Nothing could  demonstrate more clearly the degree to which the philosophic quest had  become part of the warp and woof of Spanish Jewish civilization. Halevi’s insistence on the radical superiority not only of Judaism  but also of the Jewish people has disturbed and perplexed many  readers, particularly in light of his assertion that even proselytes can  never hope to attain prophecy. His position can probably be understood  best if we recognize that the roots of his revolt lay not so much in an  intellectual reappraisal as in a visceral disgust with the humiliation and  self-degradation that he saw in the Jewish courtier culture. He describes  acquaintances who attempted to persuade him to remain in Spain as  drunk and unworthy of a response.  31 For a powerful depiction of Halevi’s revolt, see Gerson D. Cohen’s discussion in his  edition of Abraham ibn Daud, Sefer ha-Qabbalah (The Book of Tradition) (Philadelphia,  1967), pp. 295-300. — 42 — </page> <page sequence="23"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  How can they offer him bliss/through the service of kings,/which in his  eyes/is like the service of idols?/Is it good that a wholehearted and upright  man/should be offered the happiness/of a bird tied up in the hands of  youths,/in the service of Philistines,/of Hagarites and Hittites,/as alien  gods/seduce his soul/to seek their will/and forsake the will of God,/to  betray the Creator/and serve creatures instead? I have already noted the psychological inadequacy of attempting to  demonstrate that Jews are just as good as non-Jews; in such a case, the  standard of comparison remains the alien culture which Jews strive to  match and imitate. Though Halevi was not the only one to assert that  Jewish culture was not merely equal but superior, he appears to have  regarded the protestations of others as halfhearted, inadequate, even  pathetic. There was certainly nothing in the philosophical enterprise in  its standard form that had the potential to demonstrate the superiority  of Judaism over Islam. In Christian societies, philosophical arguments  offered the opportunity of establishing the implausibility, even the  impossibility, of distinctive Christian dogmas; in a society with a  dominant religion which Maimonides himself described as impeccably  monotheistic, this option was precluded. The only way to overcome the  status of “despised people,” a characterization which appears in the  very title of the Kuzari, was to cut the Gordian knot and declare one’s  emancipation from the usual rules of the philosophical game. Judaism  rests on a unique revelation, not a common philosophic consensus; Jews  are set apart and above, their status ingrained and unapproachable even  through conversion. Only such a position could speak to the psychic  impulses that lay at the very roots of Halevi’s revolt.32 32 For the poetic passage quoted, see Hayyim Schirmann, Ha-Shirah ha-‘Ivrit bi-Sefarad  u-bi-Provence 1 (Jerusalem, 1954), p. 498. For the passage about Greek wisdom, see pp.  493-494.  Several very recent studies have grappled with Halevi’s position on the second class  status of converts. Daniel J. Lasker’s “Proselyte Judaism, Christianity, and Islam in  the Thought of Judah Halevi,” Jewish Quarterly Review 81 (1990): 75-91, addresses  the issue without any effort to mitigate the sharpness of Halevi’s assertion. Attempts  to provide such mitigation appear in Lippman Bodoff, “Was Yehudah Halevi Racist?,”  Judaism 38 (1989): 174-184, and in Steven Schwartzschild, “Proselytism and Ethnicism  in R. Yehudah HaLevy,” in Religionsgespräche im Mittelalter, ed. by Bernard Lewis and  Friedrich Niewöhner (Wiesbaden, 1992), pp. 27-41.  There is a talmudic passage which could have served as a source for Halevi’s position  about the denial of prophecy to proselytes. See Kiddushin 71b for the assertion that  God rests his presence (shekhinah) only on families of unimpeachable Jewish lineage. — 43 — </page> <page sequence="24"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response Halevi’s assertion that one who accepts Judaism because of faith in  the revelation is better than one who tries to approach it through the  clever application of reason did not prevent him from maintaining, along  with many other medieval Jews, that much of the wisdom of ancient  Greece and Rome was derived from Jewish sources. Since the travails of  exile have led to the loss not only of much of the Hebrew language but  also of ancient Jewish wisdom, that wisdom has come to be associated  with the Greeks and Romans. In the hands of rationalists, this argument  served not only as an assertion of Jewish pride but as a legitimation of  philosophical study. The wisdom of Solomon had to be redeemed from  gentile hands. To a later figure like Nahmanides, whose attitude toward  speculation was complex and ambivalent, the fact that gentiles have  been influenced by ancient Jewish learning was unassailable, but the  lessons to be drawn were less clear. Since the crucial Jewish wisdom  had been preserved within the fold, and the material embedded in  the books of the Greeks could be recovered only through explorations  fraught with spiritual peril, the decision to embark on such exploration  required careful, even agonizing deliberation. Despite this ambivalence,  the dominant message of the conviction that philosophy was purloined  from the Jews was undoubtedly to establish its Jewish legitimacy and  perhaps even its standing as a component of Torah itself.33 The position of medieval rationalists concerning the relationship  between philosophy and Torah is crucial to our entire discussion, and  it explains my scrupulous avoidance of the tempting and common term  “secular studies.” There was nothing secular about metaphysics, and  because of the preparatory character of many other disciplines, they  too assumed religious value. We have already seen Saadya’s arguments  for the existence of a religious obligation to engage in philosophical  speculation, and similar arguments recur throughout the Jewish Middle  Ages. Abraham, we are told repeatedly, attained his knowledge of God  through philosophical proofs. We are commanded to “know this day...  that the Lord is God” (Deut. 4:39). David instructed Solomon, “Know  the God of your father, and serve him with a whole heart and a willing  soul” (I Chron. 28:9). Jeremiah wrote, “Let him that glories glory in  33 Kuzari 2:26; 66. Cf., inter multa alia, Guide 1:71. Many of the relevant references have  been summarized in Norman Roth, “The ‘Theft of Philosophy’ by the Greeks from the  Jews,” Classical Folia 22 (1978): 53-67. For Nahmanides, see Kitvei Ramban 1, p. 339,  and see below for his overall stance. — 44 — </page> <page sequence="25"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  this, that he understands and knows me. . . , says the Lord” (Jer. 9:23).34  These proof-texts, of course, were not unassailable, and antirationalists  argued that there are superior ways of reaching God. Halevi, for example,  cleverly reversed the rationalists’ argument that Abraham had attained  philosophical knowledge of God. The patriarch had indeed pursued  philosophical understanding, but the Rabbis tell us that when God told  him to go outdoors (Gen. 15:5), he was really telling him to abandon  astrology and listen to the divine promise. In this context, astrology is  merely an example of “all forms of syllogistic wisdom,” which are to be  left behind once direct revelation has been attained.35 The argument for speculation, however, was not wholly dependent  upon proof-texts. If love of God, clearly a quintessential religious value,  was to have any real meaning, it could flow only from a knowledge of  the Creator’s handiwork, and this required a pursuit of the sciences.  Moreover, the knowledge of God that comes from tradition alone  is inherently insufficient and is in any event secondary rather than  primary knowledge. Only those intellectually unfit for speculation  can be excused from this obligation; others who neglect their duty are  guilty of what R. Bahya ibn Paqudah called “laziness and contempt for  the word of God and his Law” and will be called to account for their  dereliction.36 A secondary argument pointed to the desirability, even the obligation,  of impressing the gentiles with the wisdom and understanding of the  Jewish people (cf. Deut. 4:6; Shabbat 75a). Bahya made this point with  exceptional vigor by maintaining that gentile recognition of Jewish  wisdom can come only if Jews prove the truth of their faith  by logical arguments and by reasonable testimony. For God has promised  to unveil the minds of the nations of their ignorance and to show His  bright light to prove the truth of our religion, as it is said, “And many  peoples shall go and say, Come yet and let us go up to the mountain of  the Lord, to the House of the God of Jacob, and He will teach us of His  ways, and we will walk in His paths. For out of Zion shall go forth the Law,  34 On these and other arguments, see Herbert A. Davidson, “The Study of Philosophy as  a Religious Obligation,” in Religion in a Religious Age, ed. by S. D. Goitein (Cambridge,  Mass., 1974), pp. 53-68. 35 Kuzari 4:17, 27. 36 The Book of Direction to the Duties of the Heart, trans. by Menahem Mansour (London,  1973), Introduction, p. 94. — 45 — </page> <page sequence="26"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem” (Isaiah 2:3). Thus it becomes  a certainty to us, through logic, Scripture, and tradition, that we are  obligated to speculate upon every matter the truth of which is conceivable  to our minds.37 This is a remarkable formulation. The object to Bahya is not merely to  cause gentiles to admire Jewish wisdom. Jewish philosophical expertise  is the medium of an eschatological missionary endeavor. Non-Jews  will accept the truth of Judaism at the end of days not because of a  supernatural deus ex machina but because of the persuasive powers,  aided no doubt by God, of Jewish philosophical arguments. Maimonides’  well-known view that gentile recognition of the truth at the end of days  will come through gradual preparation mediated by Christianity and  Islam rather than through a sudden, miraculous upheaval may well be  adumbrated in this strikingly naturalistic position in The Duties of the  Heart. In any event, Bahya has assigned philosophy nothing less than a  messianic function. In a famous and controversial extended metaphor, Maimonides  graphically illustrated his conviction that philosophy alone affords the  highest level of religious insight. Near the end of his Guide, he tells us  that the varying levels of people’s apprehension of God can be classified  by analogy with the inhabitants of a city who seek the palace of the king.  People who have no doctrinal belief are like individuals who have not  entered the city at all. Those who have engaged in speculation but have  reached erroneous conclusions can be compared with people within the  city who have turned their backs on the palace. Then there are those  who seek the palace but never see it: “the multitude of the adherents of  the Law,... the ignoramuses who observe the commandments.” We then  come to those who reach the palace but do not enter it: “the jurists who  believe true opinions on the basis of traditional authority and study  the law concerning the practices of divine service, but do not engage in  speculation concerning the fundamental principles of religion.” At long  last we come to those who have “plunged into speculation.” Only one  “who has achieved demonstration, to the extent that that is possible, of  everything that may be demonstrated... has come to be with the ruler  in the inner part of the habitation.”38 37 The Duties of the Heart, ch. I., p. 115. 38 Guide 3:51, pp. 618-619. — 46 — </page> <page sequence="27"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  The supreme value that Maimonides attributed to philosophical  speculation does not in itself demonstrate that he classified it as Torah.  Several passages in the first book of his code, however, establish this clearly  and reinforce the pride of place that he assigned to such speculation in his  hierarchy of values. The first two chapters of the code deal in summary  fashion with metaphysical questions which Maimonides then tells us  represent what the Rabbis called the “account of the chariot.” The next  two chapters set forth the essentials of astronomy and physics which, says  Maimonides, are “the account of creation.” In combination, these chapters  constitute what the Talmud calls pardes, which is clearly a term for the  secrets of the Torah. Later he informs us explicitly that “the subjects called  pardes are subsumed under the rubric gemara,” and in the Guide he describes  the philosophical discussion of divine attributes, creation, providence, and  the nature of prophecy as the mysteries and secrets of the Torah. This, however, is not the end of it. Alone among medieval Talmudists,  Maimonides took literally a rabbinic statement that the talmudic  discussions between Abbaye and Rava are considered “a small matter”  compared with the account of the chariot, which is “a great matter.” Since  the account of the chariot means metaphysical speculation, the value  judgment expressed here is wholly consistent with the palace metaphor  in the Guide and, to many medieval observers, no less disturbing.39 What renders Maimonides’ position all the more striking is its potential  implications for talmudic study. The introduction to his code contains  a famous observation that it will now be possible to study the written  39 See Hil. Yesodei ha-Torah 2:11-12; 4:10, 13; Hil. Talmud Torah 1:11-12; Guide 1:35.  Isadore Twersky has devoted a number of important studies to Maimonides’ views  on these questions. See especially his Introduction to the Code of Maimonides (Mishneh  Torah) (New Haven, 1980), pp. 356-514, esp. pp. 488-507; “Some Non-Halakhic Aspects  of the Mishneh Torah,” in Jewish Medieval and Renaissance Studies, pp. 95-118; “Religion  and Law,” in Religion in a Religious Age, pp. 69-82. That Bahya regarded metaphysics  as Torah may be reflected in his admonition that one must study metaphysics, but  it is forbidden to do so (as in the case of Torah itself) for worldly benefit. See Safran,  “Bahya ibn Pakuda’s Attitude” (above, n. 26), p. 160. For a halakhic analysis of  Maimonides’ position on the status of philosophical inquiry as a technical fulfillment  of the commandment to study Torah, see Aharon Kahn, “Li-Qevi‘at ha-Hefza shel  Talmud Torah,” Beit Yosef Shaul: Qovez Hiddushei Torah 3 (1989): 373-374, 386-403. In  Kahn’s view, even Maimonides believed that only philosophical discussions centered  on sacred texts qualify for the status of Torah. While Kahn’s interesting argument is  based on instincts that are (and should be) difficult to overcome, the hard evidence for  the conclusion remains rather thin. — 47 — </page> <page sequence="28"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response Torah, followed by “this [book],” from which the reader will know the oral  Torah, so that it will be unnecessary to read any other book in between.  The possibility that Maimonides meant to render the Talmud obsolete was  raised in his own time, and he vigorously denied any such intention in a  letter to R. Pinhas ha-Dayyan of Alexandria. Nonetheless, the tone of even  this letter reveals an attitude not wholly typical of medieval Talmudists,  and some of Maimonides’ epistles to his student Joseph ben Judah express  relatively sharp reservations about extreme preoccupation with details of  talmudic discussions at the expense of other pursuits. In the letter to R. Pinhas he testifies that he has not taught the Mishneh  Torah for a year and a half because most of his students wanted to study  R. Isaac Alfasi’s legally oriented abridgment of the Talmud; as for the  two students who wanted to study the Talmud itself, Maimonides taught  them the tractates that they requested. Although he goes on to insist  that he wrote the code only for people who are incapable of plumbing the  depths of the Talmud, this description of his students certainly does not  convey single-minded devotion to teaching the talmudic text. Far more striking are the letters to Joseph ben Judah. In one section  of this collection, Maimonides predicts that the time will come when  all Israel will study the Mishneh Torah alone with the exception of those  who are looking for something on which to spend their entire lives even  though it achieves no end. Elsewhere he permits Joseph to open a school  but urges him to pursue trade and study medicine along with his learning  of Torah; moreover, he says, Teach only the code of R. Isaac Alfasi and compare it with the Composition  [i.e., the Mishneh Torah]. If you find a disagreement, know that careful  study of the Talmud brought it about, and study the relevant passage. If  you fritter away your time with commentaries and explanations of talmudic  discussions and those matters from which we have excused people, time  will be wasted and useful results will be diminished. Finally, a slightly later citation quotes Maimonides to the effect  that talmudic scholars waste their time on the detailed discussions of  the Talmud as if those discussions were an end in themselves; in fact  their only purpose was to make the determinations necessary for proper  observance of the commandments.40 40 Iggerot le-Rabbenu Moshe ben Maimon, ed. and trans. by Yosef Kafih (Jerusalem, 1972),  — 48 — </page> <page sequence="29"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  These passages do not make explicit reference to what it is that one  should do with the time saved by the study of the Mishneh Torah. It is  perfectly clear, however, that Maimonides had in mind more than the  study of medicine and the merchant’s trade. One of the functions of his  great halakhic work was to expand the opportunities for the pursuit of  philosophical speculation. Despite the frequency, clarity, vigor, and certainty with which  Maimonides affirmed the supreme value of speculation and its standing at  the pinnacle of Torah, the poetry and pathos of a single powerful passage  reveal how all this can sometimes be overshadowed by the unshakable  instinct of which I spoke at the outset: the instinct that it is the Torah  that constitutes Torah. In his correspondence with R. Jonathan ha-Kohen  of Lunel, Maimonides addressed various questions about specific rulings  in his code. He was clearly moved by the informed reverence toward his  magnum opus that he found among the rabbis of Provence and looked  back with nostalgia on the years that he devoted to its composition. His  formulation is both striking and problematic: I, Moses, inform the glorious Rabbi R. Jonathan ha-Kohen and the other  scholars reading my work: Before I was formed in the stomach the Torah  knew me, and before I came forth from the womb she dedicated me to  her study [cf. Jer. 1:5] and appointed me to have her fountains erupt  outward. She is my beloved, the wife of my youth, in whose love I have  been immersed since early years. Yet many foreign women have become  her rivals, Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Sidonians, and Hittites. The  Lord knows that they were not taken at the outset except to serve her as  perfumers and cooks and bakers. Nonetheless, the time allotted to her has  now been reduced, for my heart has been divided into many parts through  the pursuit of all sorts of wisdom.41 There are no doubt ways to mitigate the incongruity of this passage.  First, the allusion may well be to ancillary, propaedeutic studies whose  status as “handmaidens of theology” was well established; neither  metaphysics nor, arguably, even physics are necessarily included.  Moreover, just a few lines later the letter concludes, “May the Lord,  blessed be He, help us and you study His Torah and understand His unity  so that we may not stumble, and let the verse be fulfilled in our own time,  pp. 126, 134, 136. 41 Teshuvot ha-Rambam, ed. by Jehoshua Blau, 2nd ed., 3 (Jerusalem, 1986), p. 57. — 49 — </page> <page sequence="30"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response ‘I will put my Torah in their inward parts and write it on their hearts’”  (Jer. 31:33). Nonetheless, the passionate wistfulness of Maimonides’  tone leaves me resistant to efforts at integrating this outburst of religious  nostalgia seamlessly into the web of his thought.42 One almost suspects  that as Maimonides recovered from the surge of emotion that overcame  him, he purposely inserted the crucial phrase into his final sentence so  that no one should suspect that he had renounced some of his central  commitments. We are witness here to a fascinating and revealing  glimpse of the capacity of an unphilosophical, almost atavistic love for  old-fashioned Torah to overwhelm, if only for a moment, the intellectual  convictions of the very paradigm of philosophical rationalism. Aside from the special case of Halevi, we have little direct evidence  of principled opposition to philosophy in Muslim Spain. Some of the  polemical remarks in the works of Bahya, Maimonides, and others  reveal the unsurprising information that there existed Talmudists  who looked upon the enterprise with a jaundiced eye and resisted  efforts to reread rabbinic texts in the light of philosophical doctrines.  Nonetheless, there was no concerted opposition whose work has  come down to us, and Samuel ibn Nagrella is a striking, early example  of a figure of some stature in talmudic studies who represented the  full range of adab. Moreover, we can probably be confident that the  greatest Spanish Talmudist of the twelfth century did not maintain  a vigorous antiphilosophical stance. R. Joseph ibn Migash, who  taught Maimonides’ father, did not, as far as we know, produce any  philosophical work. At the same time, given Maimonides’ oft-expressed  contempt for Talmudists who opposed speculation, the great reverence  with which he described his illustrious predecessor would be difficult  to understand if ibn Migash was counted among them, and R. Abraham  Maimonides listed him among the luminaries who “strengthened  the faith that they inherited from their fathers... to know with the  42 See the attempt in Yosef Kafih, “Limmudei ‘Ноl’ be-Mishnat ha-Rambam,” Ketavim  2 (Jerusalem, 1989), p. 594, where the author nevertheless expresses doubts about  Maimondes’ authorship of these remarks. See too Rashba’s comment in Abba Mari b.  Joseph, Sefer Minhat Qenaot (Pressburg, 1838), p. 40=Teshuvot ha-Rashba, ed. by Haim  Z. Dimitrovsky 1 (Jerusalem, 1990), pp. 342-343; Profiat Duran, Ma‘aseh Efod (Vienna,  1865), pp. 15-16. The immense religious value that Maimonides attached to philosophy  as well as his ongoing philosophical scrutiny of Jewish religious texts would render this  passage problematic even if we were to accept Kahn’s conclusion that philosophical  inquiry must be based on Jewish sources in order to qualify as Torah. See above, n. 39. — 50 — </page> <page sequence="31"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  eye of their intellect and the understanding of their mind” that God  cannot be conceived in corporeal terms.43 As in the case of Saadya’s  Baghdad, many Spanish Talmudists probably treated philosophy with  salutary neglect while others, probably including ibn Migash, looked  upon it with some favor even though it was not their particular field  of expertise. With few significant exceptions, Spanish Jewry under  Islam was unambiguously hospitable to the pursuit of philosophy, the  sciences, and the literary arts. THE GREAT STRUGGLE: PROVENCE AND NORTHERN SPAIN FROM THE LATE TWELFTH TO THE EARLY FOURTEENTH CENTURY The great religious value of philosophy was inextricably intertwined  with its great religious danger. Since reason and revelation were rooted  in the same source, they could not conflict with one another;44 at the  same time, the study of philosophic texts generated a host of problems  for traditional conceptions, particularly as Aristotelianism launched its  triumphant march across the medieval intellectual landscape. To most  believers, God had created the world out of nothing; to Aristotelians, a  form of primeval matter had always existed. To the traditional believer,  God’s knowledge extended to the most minute details affecting the lowest  of creatures, and his loving providence was over “all his handiwork”  (Psalms 145:9); to the Aristotelian, he did not know particulars at all.  To the person of faith, celestial reward awaited each righteous individual  as a separate entity; to the Aristotelian philosopher, the soul’s survival  depended upon intellectual attainments and took a collective rather  43 See Abraham Maimonides, Milhamot Hashem, ed. by Reuven Margaliyot (Jerusalem,  1953), pp. 49-50. With respect to direct evidence, however, note Israel Ta-Shema’s  remark that “we do not have a scintilla of information on his pursuit of philosophy,  grammar, or science”; see “Yezirato ha-Sifrutit shel Rabbenu Yosef ha-Levi ibn  Migash,” Kiryat Sefer 46 (1971): 137. In light of Abraham Maimonides’ statement, this  formulation may be a shade too vigorous. 44 For a sharp formulation of this point, see Norman Roth, Maimonides: Essays and Texts,  850th Anniversary (Madison, 1985), p. 94. He argues that from the point of view  of medieval Jewish and Muslim rationalists there can be no conflict because “what  prophetic revelation brings in the way of flashes of light to the masses, the philosopher  sees in the full blaze of rational illumination.” — 51 — </page> <page sequence="32"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response than an individual form. One is tempted to paraphrase Maimonides’  exalted assessment of metaphysics by observing that these are indeed  not small matters. Medieval thinkers had a wide range of options in dealing with such  issues. At one end of the spectrum were those who rejected philosophical  inquiry on principle. On the other were those who accepted virtually  the full corpus of Aristotelian conclusions and maintained that revealed  religion, which should not be consulted for the answers to ultimate  questions, was intended as a political instrument for ordering the life  of the masses. Ranged between these extremes were the large majority  of thinkers with greater or lesser inclinations toward the preservation  of traditional beliefs. In any given instance, one could argue that the  philosophical position was unproven and unpersuasive or that the  standard religious conception was not essential or had been misconstrued.  The last approach was both controversial and fruitful because it required  not only a rethinking of doctrine but a reinterpretation of classic texts.  The allegorical understanding of both biblical and Talmudic material is  consequently an integral and significant part of our story. The attitudes of  Jews toward general culture had a profound impact on their conceptions  of Judaism itself. The battle over philosophical study became a major theme in medieval  Jewish history as a result of a watershed event: the migration of many  Spanish Jews to Southern France in the wake of the Almohade conquest  of the late 1140s. This conquest brought the history of Andalusian Jewry  to a tragic end and opened a new chapter in the relationship between  Sephardic and Ashkenazic Jews. A number of the exiles moved only as far  north as Christian Spain, where some of them translated scientific and  philosophical works that helped to transfer the advanced culture of the  Muslim world into the ever more curious Christian Europe of the twelfth  century. While this dimension of cultural activity did not play a central  role within the Jewish community itself, it was a development of major  importance in the evolution of European civilization.45 45 See M. Steinschneider’s classic Die Hebraeischen Uebersetzungen des Mittelalters und die  Juden als Dolmetscher (Berlin, 1893). For a readable survey of medieval translations  and the Jews, see section II of Charles Singer’s “The Jewish Factor in Medieval  Thought,” in The Legacy of Israel, ed. by Edwyn R. Bevan and Charles Singer (Oxford,  1927), pp. 202-245. On earlier contacts between Ashkenazim and Sephardim, see the  important reassessment by Avraham Grossman, “Bein Sefarad le-Zarfat: ha-Qesharim  — 52 — </page> <page sequence="33"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  From an internal Jewish perspective, the major acts in this drama  were to be played out in the south of France.46 For the first time,  substantial numbers of Ashkenazim and Sephardim confronted one  another in the same community, and the immigrants resisted any  assimilation into the cultural patterns of the native Ashkenazim. On  the contrary, one senses a degree of self-confident assertiveness that  borders on cultural imperialism. The Provençal Jews needed to defend  even their halakhic traditions against a Sephardic effort to impose the  rulings of R. Isaac Alfasi, and the Spanish Jews brought with them a  feeling of almost contemptuous superiority toward those who were  untrained in the broader culture of the Andalusian elite. What made  this challenge particularly effective was the inability of the Jews of  Provence to point to their own unambiguous superiority in Torah  narrowly construed. Although the immigrants themselves could offer  no Talmudists to compete with R. Abraham b. David of Posquières or  R. Zerahiah HaLevi of Lunel, they could point to a substantial cohort  of distinguished rabbis produced by their native culture along with its  philosophical achievements. Under such circumstances, the argument that pursuit of philosophy  enhanced religion by providing insight into the nature of God was  difficult to resist. At the same time, the deviations from traditional  religious conceptions that philosophy brought in its wake could not but  cause concern in a society that was being exposed to such ideas for the  first time, and the argument from the dangers of philosophical heresy  loomed large. It may well be that this dialectic was responsible for one  of the most important developments in the history of Judaism: the rise  of mysticism as a highly visible factor in the intellectual constellation of  medieval Jewry. The central component of Jewish mysticism in the Middle Ages was its  theosophic doctrine. Without detracting from the significance of ecstatic  kabbalah, there can be little doubt that one seeking to understand the  bein Qehillot Yisra’el she-bi-Sefarad ha-Muslemit u-bein Qehillot Zarfat,” in Galut  Ahar Golah: Mehqarim be-Toledot ‘Am Yisrael Muggashim li-Professor Haim Beinart, ed.  by A. Mirsky, A. Grossman, and Y. Kaplan (Jerusalem, 1988), pp. 75-101. See now  his Hakhmei Zarfat ha-Rishonim (Jerusalem, 1995), pp. 554-571. 46 For a characterization of Provençal Jewish culture in this period, see Isadore Twersky,  “Aspects of the Social and Cultural History of Provençal Jewry,” in Jewish Society through  the Ages, ed. by H.

Ettinger (New York, 1971), pp. 185-207. — 53 — </page> <page sequence="34"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response attraction of esoteric lore in the initial stages of its popularity must look  at its doctrinal rather than its experiential aspects. Such an examination  reveals that kabbalah provided the perfect solution, at least to people  with a receptive religious personality, to the critical intellectual issue  that confronted Jews at precisely the time and place in which mysticism  began to spread. The essential claim made by kabbalists was that God had revealed  an esoteric teaching to Moses in addition to the exoteric Torah. This  secret lore uncovered the deeper meaning of the Torah, and it also taught  initiates the true nature of God and creation; it is here, not in Aristotelian  physics and metaphysics, that one must seek the meaning of the accounts  of creation and of the chariot. Indeed, a recent study has argued that  longstanding mystical doctrines were now at least partially publicized  because the bearers of these doctrines could not suffer in silence the  Maimonidean-style claim that the rabbis had referred to gentile  disciplines as the secrets of the Torah. However that may be, kabbalah  offered a revealed key to precisely the knowledge that philosophers  sought. By locating that key in an inner Jewish tradition, kabbalists  could argue that philosophy with all its dangers was superfluous, and  even though Rabbinic tradition had attributed spiritual peril to the study  of mystical secrets, one could hardly compare the potential for heresy  in the pursuit of revealed truth to the dangers of studying Aristotle.  Even without reference to the problem of heresy, kabbalah promised the  late twelfth-century Provençal Jew all that philosophy offered and more,  since human reason is fallible while the word of God is not. Small wonder  that Jewish thinkers began to respond, and mysticism embarked on a  path that would lead it toward a pre-eminent position in Jewish piety  and religious thought by the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.47 The penetration of Sephardic philosophical culture into Southern  France in the late twelfth and early thirteenth centuries produced the  47 I made the essential point in “Miracles and the Natural Order in Nahmanides,” in  Rabbi Moses Nahmanides (Ramban): Explorations in His Religious and Literary Virtuosity,  ed. by Isadore Twersky (Cambridge, Mass. and London, England, 1983), p. 111. Cf.  the citation from A.S. Halkin in note 17 there. On the suggestion that mystics were  responding to the claim that Aristotelian doctrines are the secrets of the Torah, see  Moshe Idel, Kabbalah: New Perspectives (New Haven and London, 1988), p. 253, and  much more fully in sections I and II of his “Maimonides and Kabbalah,” in Studies in  Maimonides, ed. by Isadore Twersky (Cambridge, Mass. and London, England, 1990),  pp. 31-50. — 54 — </page> <page sequence="35"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  first great conflict over the propriety of rationalistic speculation. The  Maimonidean controversy erupted in the early 1230s as a result of the  perception by R. Solomon ben Abraham of Montpellier that the study  of certain works of Maimonides was leading people into heresy. Though  the internal Jewish dynamic that we have been examining could have  set these events in motion without any external impetus, there can be  little doubt that the atmosphere of early thirteenth-century Christian  Languedoc aided and abetted the process. The century had begun with  the Albigensian Crusade, and the decade of the Jewish controversy was  also witness to the birth of an inquisition aimed at Christian heresies. R. Solomon sent his distinguished student R. Jonah to bring the  writings in question to the attention of his natural allies, the rabbis of  Northern France. As a result of this initiative, the rabbis of the North  proclaimed a ban against The Guide of the Perplexed and the first, quasi- philosophical section of the Mishneh Torah (“The Book of Knowledge”). At  this point, the defenders of Maimonides in the South proclaimed a ban  against R. Solomon and his disciples and sent the biblical commentator  R. David Kimhi (Radak) to their natural allies in what was now Christian  Spain to obtain support for the second ban. Radak discovered to his surprise that a mixed reception awaited him.  While some Spanish communities affirmed the ban enthusiastically,  the distinguished physician R. Judah Alfakar refused to offer support  and instead wrote several sharp letters expressing his reservations  about Maimonides’ Guide. The ambivalence that Radak encountered  in Spain speaks volumes for the fact that the direction of influence in  the Sephardi-Ashkenazi confrontation of the previous decades was not  reflected exclusively in the adoption of a philosophical culture by some  Ashkenazim. The Ashkenazi impact on many Sephardim was no less  profound. In some cases, this influence came through Southern France; in  others, it was direct. Whatever the medium, however, Radak discovered a  transformed Spanish Jewry whose attitude toward the culture produced  by its own forebears could no longer be predicted with confidence. This transformation is also evident in a letter by Nahmanides  that we shall have to examine later in which he attempted, with some  success, to bring the controversy to a close. In the meantime, events in  Montpellier overtook developments in Spain. Zealous anti-Maimonists  approached local ecclesiastical authorities with what they presented  as heretical Jewish books, and the churchmen obliged by burning the  — 55 — </page> <page sequence="36"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response controversial works of Maimonides. Indignant Maimonists complained  to lay authorities apparently unhappy with ecclesiastical intervention,  and the anti-Maimonist delators were promptly punished by having  a part of their tongues cut off. Contemporary Maimonists evinced no  dismay at the harshness of the penalty; on the contrary, they regarded  it as an appropriate divine retribution for an offense whose seriousness  in the medieval Jewish context could hardly be exaggerated. Though  the internal Jewish controversy did not end immediately after these  events, it began to die down, and the works of Maimonides remained  undisturbed for decades to come.48 The issues raised in the substantial corpus of letters written during  this controversy reveal the concerns, the tactics, and the deeply held  convictions of most of the parties to the dispute. Regrettably, we possess  only one letter from R. Solomon ben Abraham himself. It is of no small  interest that he denies requesting a ban against the Guide and “The Book  of Knowledge” and that he makes a point of his careful, sympathetic study  of Maimonides’ code in his yeshivah. What concerned him, he writes, was  that some Provençal Jews had affirmed extreme philosophical positions  that went so far as the allegorization of the story of Cain and Abel and  even of the commandments themselves. R. Meir HaLevi Abulafia, who  had questioned Maimonides’ view of resurrection three decades earlier,  reports that R. Solomon was motivated by a concern about rationalists  who “wish to break the yoke of the commandments” by denying that God  really cares for ritual observances. All God wants, they maintained, is that  people know him philosophically; whether the body is pure or impure,  hungry or thirsty, is quite irrelevant. R. Meir’s brother Yosef b. Todros  speaks of Jews who argued that all the words of the Torah and rabbinic  tradition are allegories, who mocked the belief in miracles, and who  regarded themselves as exempt from prayer and phylacteries. To what  48 The clarity of this brief summary obscures the obscurity of the events. For an admirable  effort to reconstruct the chronology of the controversy, see A. Schochet, “Berurim  be-Parashat ha-Pulmus ha-Rishon ‘al Sifrei ha-Rambam,” Zion 36 (1971): 27-60,  which takes account of the important sources in Joseph Shatzmiller, “Li-Temunat  ha-Mahaloqet ha-Rishonah ‘al Kitvei ha-Rambam,” Zion 34 (1969): 126-144.

The best analysis  of significant aspects of the debates is in Bernard Septimus, Hispano-Jewish Culture in  Transition (Cambridge, Mass. and London, England, 1982), pp. 61-103. — 56 — </page> <page sequence="37"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  degree these assertions reflect reality is far from clear; what is clear is that  the argument that rationalism has in fact produced heresy was one of the  most forceful and effective weapons in the arsenal of the opposition.49 In addition to specific charges of disbelief and violations of law,  rationalists also faced the accusation that they abandon the study of  Talmud in favor of philosophical speculation. Thus, Radak found it  necessary to testify that he studies Talmud assiduously and observes  the commandments meticulously; the only reason that people suspected  him, he tells us, is that he had indicated that the detailed exchanges in the  Talmud will be rendered obsolete in the Messianic age when everything  will become clear. Many Talmudists would surely have disagreed even  with the assertion to which Radak admits, and Alfakar’s letter to him  explicitly speaks of the inclination to abolish the discussions of Abbaye  and Rava in order “to ascend in the chariot.”50 On the most fundamental level, Alfakar, whose letters evince an  impressive level of philosophical sophistication, denied the controlling  authority of reason. Any compelling demonstration, he wrote, requires  investigation of extraordinary intensity because of the possibility of  hidden sophistry, and an erroneous premise, no matter how far back in  the chain of reasoning, can undermine the validity of the conclusion.  Consequently, reliance on reason to reject important religious teachings  is inadmissible. Alfakar’s specific examples concentrate on the denial or limitation  of miracles. Maimonides, he says, regarded Balaam’s talking donkey  and similar biblical miracles as prophetic visions despite the Mishnah’s  inclusion of the donkey’s power of speech among the ten things created  immediately before the first Sabbath. This Maimonidean tendency is  symptomatic of the deeper problem of attempting to synthesize the  Torah and Greek wisdom. Radak had explicitly praised Maimonides’  unique ability to harmonize “wisdom” and faith. On the contrary, says  Alfakar, the attempt was a failure. Maimonides, for example, limited the  number of long-lived antediluvians because his intention was to leave the ordinary operation of the world intact  so that he could establish the Torah and Greek wisdom together, “coupling  49 See R.

He imagined that  the one could stand with the other “like two young roes that are twins”  (Song of Songs 4:5); instead, there was “mourning and lamentation” (Lam.  2:5). “The land was not able to bear them, that they might live together”  (Gen. 13:6) as two sisters, “for the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian  women” (Exod. 1:19). As for lesser figures than Maimonides, they reduce the number of  miracles because “their soul does not consider it appropriate to believe  what the Creator considered it appropriate to do.”51 Yosef ben Todros Halevi affirmed the dangers lurking in the Guide by  arguing that no one in his generation has the capacity to read the work  without exposing himself to the danger of heresy. Consequently, he can  justify the action of the Northern French rabbis without forfeiting his  respect for Maimonides. Both “acted for the sake of heaven, each in his  place and time.” Moreover, he says, the dangers of speculation have even  been recognized by the kings of the Arabs, who forbade “Greek wisdom”  and philosophical study. If Yosef is referring to the Almohade rulers, we  would have a striking appeal by a Jewish conservative to the judgment  of persecutors of his people for the sake of validating or at least lending  support to a decision affecting the internal spiritual life of Judaism.52 The Maimonist party responded with a vigorous defense of the value  of general culture. Radak succeeded in eliciting a ban against R. Solomon  and his students from the Jewish community of Saragossa, the text of  which contains instructive arguments for the rationalist position taken  from Rabbinic literature. It is widely known among our people that our sages instructed and warned  us to learn the wisdom concerning the unity of God as well as external forms  of wisdom that will enable us to answer heretics and know the matters  utilized by disbelievers to destroy our Torah. [They] also [instructed us to  study] astrology and the vanities of idol-worship, [which] one cannot learn  from the Torah or the Talmud, as well as the measurement of land and  knowledge of solstices and calculations, as the learned teacher of wisdom  said, “The pathways of the heavens are as clear to me as the pathways of  51 Qovez Teshuvot ha-Rambam 3, pp. la-2a, 3a. 52 Qevuzat Mikhtavim, pp. 21-22, 13-14. The term malkhei ha-‘erev, based on I Kings  10:15, appears as malkhei ‘arav in the parallel verse in II Chronicles (9:14) and was no  doubt understood by Joseph as Arab kings despite the ambiguity introduced by the  juxtaposition of the two phrases in Jeremiah 25:24. — 58 — </page> <page sequence="39"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  Nehardea,” and an understanding of the scope with which they measured  at a distance on both land and sea. Moreover, they ruled that no one can  be appointed to the Sanhedrin to decide the law unless he knows these  disciplines and medicine as well.53 A particularly interesting aspect of this text is the distinction  between “the wisdom concerning the unity of God” (hokhmat ha-yihud)  and “external forms of wisdom” or “external disciplines” (hokhmot  hizzoniyyot). The former requires no defense on instrumental grounds;  it is part of the Torah, and the problem is just that the antirationalists  do not recognize this. External wisdom, on the other hand, needs to be  justified in other ways. The document provides Rabbinic authority for  some of these pursuits, whose purpose is often self-evident, but the only  concrete argument set forth is the need to respond to heretics. This need,  which was legitimized by a Rabbinic text, was routinely cited in other  contexts to defend so religiously dubious an enterprise as the study of  the New Testament. Its application to our context is attested not only in  the Saragossa ban but in the counterargument of Yosef ben Todros that  the rabbis’ intention in urging Jews to learn the appropriate response  to heretics was manifestly “to reconstruct the ruins of the faith, not to  destroy it.” Yosef, in other words, regarded the use of this argument  as the last refuge of scoundrels, a pro forma justification for a pursuit  motivated by entirely different considerations.54 If the information of the Saragossa authorities was reliable, the text  of their denunciation contributes to our knowledge of the ban issued by  the antirationalists. The earlier ban, we are told, was directed not only against the Guide  and “The Book of Knowledge” but against “anyone who studies any of  the external disciplines.” R. Bahya ben Moses, the chief signatory of  the Saragossa ban, repeats this information in a letter to the Jewish  communities of Aragon.55 On the one hand, we could be dealing with an  exaggeration designed to facilitate the eliciting of additional counterbans;  on the other, the fact that “external books” are denounced in the  53 Qovez Teshuvot ha-Rambam 3, p. 5b. 54 Qevuzat Mikhtavim, p. 14.

However  that may be, rationalists were clearly uncomfortable with the talmudic  prohibition of “Greek wisdom,” and we find efforts at redefinition that  limit the meaning of the term to a kind of coded communication that  has not survived and that therefore poses no limitation whatever to the  philosopher’s intellectual agenda. One Maimonist argued that however  one understands the term, the prohibition can certainly not result from a  concern with heresy since the Rabbis would never have excluded potential  diplomats from the ban had the reason for it been that weighty.56 Defenses of rationalism and its allied disciplines appealed to other  considerations as well. The argument that philosophical sophistication was  necessary to impress gentiles was fairly widespread, and it occasionally  took an even stronger form: the Jewish loss of Greek wisdom, which was,  of course, originally Jewish wisdom, makes Jews an object of ridicule in the  eyes of their educated neighbors.57 During the Maimonidean controversy,  a more fundamental argument appears in a novel formulation that may  reflect the influence of a major Christian work. In the twelfth century,  Peter Abelard wrote his celebrated Sic et Non, which challenged opponents  of speculation to account for a variety of apparent contradictions in  authoritative texts. The “authority” which is the presumed alternative to  reason is simply not usable without its supposed rival. One Maimonist  letter argues for rationalism by citing contradictions in Rabbinic sources  that can be resolved only by the sort of speculation that the antirationalists  eschew.58 Patristic contradictions have become Rabbinic contradictions,  but the Abelardian argument remains intact. We have already seen that the anti-Maimonists’ concern that  rationalism tends to produce heresy constituted one of their most  powerful arguments against philosophical study. A striking feature of  56 Samuel Saporta in Qevuzat Mikhtavim, p. 95. On Greek wisdom, see Saul Lieberman,  Hellenism in Jewish Palestine (New York, 1962), pp. 100-114, and cf. the references in  Davidson, “The Study of Philosophy as a Religious Obligation” (above n. 34), pp. 66-67,  n. 44. 57 Samuel ibn Tibbon, Ma’amar Yiqqavu ha-Mayim (Pressburg, 1837), p. 173.

Shatzmiller was struck by the argument but not by the Abelardian parallel,  which is, of course, speculative. In a recent lecture, Bernard Septimus has noted that R.  Asher may well have been making a sharp allusion to the Tosafists’ own use of dialectic. — 60 — </page> <page sequence="41"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  the controversy is that the Maimonists argued that precisely the reverse  was true: it was antirationalism that had produced a heresy more serious  than the worst philosophical heterodoxy, because many naive believers  worshipped a corporeal God. The issue of anthropomorphism is therefore  crucial to an understanding not only of the Maimonidean controversy  but of the role that philosophy played in defining the parameters of a  legitimate Jewish conception of God. There can be no higher stakes than  these and no better evidence of the powerful, almost controlling presence  of the philosophical enterprise at the very heart of medieval Judaism. Maimonides listed belief in the incorporeal nature of God as one of  his thirteen principles constituting the sine qua non of the faith. As he  indicated both in his discussion of this creed and in his code, failure to  affirm this belief is rank heresy which excludes one from a portion in  the world to come. Maimonides has been assigned a highly sophisticated  motivation for taking this position. Survival after death requires a cleaving  to God that is possible only through the development of that aspect of  the soul which perceives certain abstract truths about the Deity; the  belief in an incorporeal God is consequently the minimum requirement  for attaining eternal life.59 While Maimonides may well have endorsed  this view, the immediate motivation for perceiving anthropomorphism  as heresy was probably simpler and more fundamental: the believer in a  corporeal God does not really believe in one God at all. Maimonides drew the connection between unity and incorporeality  forcefully and explicitly: There is no profession of unity unless the doctrine of God’s corporeality  is denied. For a body cannot be one, but is composed of matter and form,  which by definition are two; it is also divisible, subject to partition.... It is  not meet that belief in the corporeality of God... should be permitted to  establish itself in anyone’s mind any more than it is meet that belief should  be established in the nonexistence of the deity, in the association of other  gods with Him, or in the worship of other than He.60 Maimonides’ son provided an even sharper formulation.  Anthropomorphism, he writes, is an impurity like that 59 See Arthur Hyman’s important article, “Maimonides’ ‘Thirteen Principles’,” in Jewish  Medieval and Renaissance Studies, pp. 141-142. 60 Guide 1:35, p. 81. Hyman is, of course, well aware of this passage but argues that the  belief in incorporeality is what gives the very profession of unity its salvific value. — 61 — </page> <page sequence="42"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response of idolatry. Idolaters deny God’s Torah and worship other gods beside  Him, while one who, in his stupidity, allows it to enter his mind that the  Creator has a body or an image or a location, which is possible only for a  body, does not know Him. One who does not know Him denies Him, and  such a person’s worship and prayer are not to the Creator of the world.  [Anthropomorphists] do not worship the God of heaven and earth but a  false image of Him, just like the worshippers of demons about whom the  Rabbis say that they worship [such] an image, for the entity that they have  in mind, who is corporeal and has stature or a particular location where  he sits on a throne, does not exist at all. It was concerning those fools and  their like that the prophet said, “He has shut their eyes, that they cannot  see, and their hearts, that they cannot understand.”61 It is especially noteworthy that Maimonides does not appeal to  tradition to validate his declaration that anthropomorphism is heretical.  On the contrary, his comments on the motivation for his stand clearly  reveal the determinative role of philosophy. He tells us in the Guide  that if he wished to affirm the eternity of the world, he could provide  a figurative interpretation to biblical texts that imply the contrary just  as he has interpreted anthropomorphic verses figuratively. One reason  for distinguishing the case of anthropomorphism from that of eternal  matter is that the latter has not been proven. On the other hand, “that  the deity is not a body has been demonstrated; from this it follows  necessarily that everything that in its external meaning disagrees with  this demonstration must be interpreted figuratively.” Alfakar, while  wrestling with the same problem, pointed to the fact that the Bible itself  contains contradictory verses regarding the corporeality of God and  argued that this legitimates figurative interpretation. Though Alfakar and  Maimonides also cited Onkelos’s alleged avoidance of anthropomorphic  expressions as a precedent, and Nahmanides, Abraham Maimonides,  and Samuel Saporta provided a list of anti-anthropomorphic authorities  beginning with the time of the Geonim, there can be little doubt that the  driving force in the extirpation of a corporeal conception of God was the  philosophic enterprise.62 61 Milhamot Hashem, p. 52. For a very strong (perhaps just a bit too strong) assertion of  this understanding of Maimonides’ motivation (without reference to Milhamot Hashem),  see Menachem Kellner, Dogma in Medieval Jewish Thought From Maimonides to Abravanel  (Oxford, 1986), p. 41: “Maimonides held that. . . one who conscientiously observes the  halakhah while believing in the corporeality of God is, in effect, performing idolatry.” 62 See Guide 2:25, p. 328; Qovez Teshuvot ha-Rambam 3, p. lb; Kitvei Ramban, 1, pp. 346-347;  — 62 — </page> <page sequence="43"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  The philosophers, in fact, did their job so well that contemporary  Jews find it very difficult to acknowledge the existence of medieval  Jewish anthropomorphism despite substantial, credible evidence. By  far the best known testimony is the assertion by R. Abraham b. David of  Posquières that greater Jews than Maimonides believed in a corporeal  God because they were misled by the literal meaning of Rabbinic aggadot.  Maimonist rhetoric during the controversy is replete with assertions that  the anti-Maimonists believe in a corporeal God and are consequently  heretics. Some of these attacks may well be exaggerated, but they play  too prominent a role in the discussion for them to have been invented  out of whole cloth. Abraham Maimonides reports that the prominent  anti-Maimonist David ben Saul vigorously denied that he conceived of  God in crudely anthropomorphic terms; at the same time, says Abraham,  David affirmed his belief that God sits in heaven, where his primary  grandeur is to be found, and that a partition separates the Creator from  his creatures. In a particularly sharp attack, Abraham comments that  Christian support for the anti-Maimonist cause is hardly surprising since  the beliefs of the two groups diverge so little.63 Finally, we have the works of two Ashkenazic writers who explicitly  express conceptions of God which are corporeal by Maimonidean  standards. R. Moses Taku is the better known of these figures, and his  Ketav Tamim is a polemic specifically directed against the Saadyanic  and Maimonidean insistence on an incorporeal God. Taku, who is cited  in Tosafot and was not an entirely marginal figure, not only affirmed a  moderate kind of anthropomorphism but also accused the philosophers of  heresy in terms strikingly reminiscent of Abraham Maimonides himself.  In his vigorous reversal of the Maimonidean argument, Taku wrote, Who knows if the redemption is being delayed because of the fact that they  do not know who is performing miracles for them. Moreover, if tragedy  strikes, they cry out and are not answered because they direct their cries to  something other than the fundamental object of faith; for this new religion  and new wisdom recently came upon the scene, and its adherents maintain  Milhamot Hashem, pp. 49-50; Qevuzat Mikhtavim, pp. 85-86, 90-91. 63 Rabad to Hil.

The sun is nothing more than a moving window in the firmament, and  what we see when we look at it is therefore the very substance of the  deity. It is more than a little disconcerting to find a medieval Hebrew  text that routinely refers to “the air, blessed be it [He?] and blessed be  its [His?] name,” but in this case at least, the author describes himself  as the object of persecution, and he was no doubt on the theological  margins of Ashkenazic Judaism despite the fact that he may have been  the author of a rabbinic responsum. Nonetheless, in the late fourteenth  or early fifteenth century, an Ashkenazic rabbi was still asking the basic  question about the corporeality of God, and there can be little doubt that  Ashkenaz in the high Middle Ages did not enjoy a consensus on this most  critical of theological questions.65 Thus, the presence of anthropomorphic  conceptions among some medieval Jews provided the rationalists with a  powerful religious argument for philosophical inquiry and even enabled  them to reverse the accusation of heresy. Ironically, as the philosophers  won their greatest victory, they destroyed the most effective argument  for their importance. For Taku, the major obstacle to the rejection of anthropomorphism  was not only the plain meaning of biblical expressions; he was concerned  to at least an equal degree with a multitude of Rabbinic texts which  he was unwilling to interpret nonliterally. In this and other contexts,  conclusions drawn from philosophy and the sciences forced medieval  Jews to confront the question of aggadah on a fundamental level, so  that these pursuits once again impinged upon the study of Torah even in  the narrowest sense. We have already seen that Geonim like R. Samuel b.  Hofni and R. Hai had legitimated rejection of certain aggadot, although  64 Ozar Nehmad 3 (1860): 82-83. 65 See Israel Ta-Shema, “Sefer ha-Maskil: Hibbur Yehudi Zarfati Bilti-Yadua mi-sof ha- Me’ah ha-Yod-Gimel,” Mehqerei Yerushalayim be-Mahashevet Yisrael 2:3 (1982-83): 416-  438; Ephraim Kupfer, “Li-Demutah ha-Tarbutit shel Yahadut Ashkenaz va-Hakhameha  ba-Me’ot ha-Yod-Dalet-ha-Tet-Vav,” Tarbiz 42 (1972/73): 114. — 64 — </page> <page sequence="45"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  R. Hai had insisted on the need to make the most strenuous efforts to  validate all Rabbinic statements, particularly if they are incorporated in  the Babylonian Talmud. The need to reinterpret rather than reject outright  was especially acute with respect to an issue like anthropomorphism,  where the error was too profound to allow it to stand even as a minority  view among the Rabbis. Consequently, by the time of Maimonides and  the Maimonidean controversy, substantial precedent existed for a variety  of approaches to aggadic texts.66 The issue of aggadah had already been raised by opponents of  Maimonides in the debate over resurrection just after the turn of the  thirteenth century, and the Northern French rabbis in the 1230s once  again expressed concern. They believed that Maimonides had undermined  the traditional understanding of reward after death and specifically  criticized his rejection of a literal feast of Leviathan as described in  Rabbinic aggadot. It is of no small interest that while one defense of  Maimonides argued that he had not in fact denied that this banquet  would take place, Abraham Maimonides sardonically observed that the  Rabbis had proffered this promise so that naïve believers like R. Solomon  of Montpellier would have something to look forward to. On a more  significant level, Maimonides’ assertion that the biblical punishment of  cutting off (karet) signifies the destruction of the soul was attacked as  a contradiction of the talmudic perception that it refers to premature  death. Maimonides’ critics proceeded to denounce those who abandon  “halakhot and aggadot, which are the source of life, to pursue Greek  wisdom, which the sages forbade.” The point here is not merely the choice  of one pursuit over another, but the manner in which the study of the  one distorts the understanding of the other. According to a Maimonist  report, some of the Ashkenazim went so far as to propose that Rashi’s  interpretation of aggadot be made dogmatically binding.67 66 On Taku, see his Ketav Tamim: Ketav Yad Paris H711, with an introduction by Joseph Dan  (Jerusalem, 1984), Introduction, p. 24.

This treatise not only proposes reinterpretation but  recognizes the occasional need for outright rejection as well. “We are  not obligated... to argue on behalf of the Rabbis and uphold the views  expressed in all their medical, scientific, and astronomical statements,  [and to believe] them the way we believe them with respect to the  interpretation of the Torah, whose consummate wisdom was in their  hands.”68 The essence of this position had already been expressed in  the Guide itself. Although Maimonides had argued that respect for  the wisdom of the Sages requires us to strive to understand even their  scientific assertions as consonant with the truth, he nonetheless laid  down the following principle: Do not ask of me to show that everything they have said concerning  astronomical matters conforms to the way things really are. For at that time  mathematics were imperfect. They did not speak about this as transmitters  of dicta of the prophets, but rather because in those times they were men  of knowledge in these fields or because they had heard these dicta from the  men of knowledge who lived in those times.69 Despite the apparent effort to impose Rashi’s presumably literal  understanding of aggadot, even Ashkenazic Jews were not wholly  inflexible on this issue. Moses Taku himself indicated that his teachers had  distinguished between Rabbinic statements that appear in the Talmud and  those that do not. “If a person sees a strange remark in external [Rabbinic]  books, he should not be concerned about it since it does not appear in the  aggadot in our Talmud upon which we rely.” Several disagreements with  the Rabbis appear in the admittedly atypical Sefer ha-Maskil, and under  the pressure of polemics with an apostate attacking the Talmud, R. Yehiel  of Paris observed, if only for the sake of argument, that the aggadah does  not have the same binding force as talmudic law.70 Note too Charles Touati’s remarks in, “Les Deux Conflits autour de Maimonide et des  Études Philosophiques,” in Juifs et Judaism de Languedoc, ed. by M.

In 1263, Nahmanides  faced a different apostate who attempted to utilize Talmudic evidence  for the purpose of demonstrating the truth of Christianity; in their  disputation, Nahmanides argued that midrashic statements should be  treated as sermons which command respect but not unqualified assent.  The sincerity of that argument has been the subject of controversy to  our own day, but an analysis of Nahmanides’ commentary to the Torah  leaves little doubt that he meant what he said.71 Many medieval Jews  wished to preserve considerable latitude in dealing with aggadah, and  although a variety of motives were at work, philosophical considerations  took pride of place. Nahmanides’ role in the controversy and his stand regarding  philosophical speculation are especially important both because his  efforts appear to have effectively ended the Northern French intervention  and because he represents a crucial transitional type in the evolution of  medieval Jewish attitudes toward general culture. On the one hand, he was  hardly typical of the Andalusian-style Jewish philosopher. He expressed  considerable hostility toward “the accursed Greek” Aristotle, described  himself as a disciple of the Northern French Tosafists, and fully embraced  the “hidden wisdom” of the kabbalah. On the other hand, he mastered  the corpus of Jewish philosophical and scientific literature, practiced  429; Vikkuah R. Yehiel mi-Paris, ed. by S. Gruenbaum (Thorn, 1873), p. 2. See also the  citation in Avraham Grossman, Hakhmei Ashkenaz ha-Rishonim (Jerusalem, 1981), p.  96, for Rabbenu Gershom’s opposition to a deviation from a rabbinic interpretation  on a nonlegal matter in a liturgical poem by a distinguished colleague. This may be at  least a faint indication that some Jews in early Ashkenaz considered such deviations  legitimate. It is, of course, a commonplace that twelfth-century Northern French  exegetes proposed interpretations that deviated from those of the rabbis even on  matters of law. 71 See Kitvei Ramban I, p. 308, and Bernard Septimus’s excellent, though preliminary  discussion in “‘Open Rebuke and Concealed Love’: Nahmanides and the Andalusian  Tradition,” in Rabbi Moses Nahmanides, pp. 20-22. Marvin Fox, “Nahmanides on the  Status of Aggadot: Perspectives on the Disputation at Barcelona, 1263,” Journal of  Jewish Studies 40 (1989): 95-109, reaches a conclusion with which I am in fundamental  agreement, although I cannot endorse several of his arguments. On one occasion (p.  101), he perpetuates a blurring of the distinction between rejection of aggadah and its  allegorization; see my remarks in “Maccoby’s Judaism on Trial,” Jewish Quarterly Review  76 (1986): 255, n. 2. — 67 — </page> <page sequence="48"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response medicine, and pursued a sort of golden mean during the Maimonidean  controversy. His extraordinary commentary on the Pentateuch, which  mobilized the full range of his diverse interests, defies neat classification  into any prior category of Jewish exegesis or thought. In an oft-quoted passage from his Sha‘ar ha-Gemul, a work that  addresses the problem of theodicy, he denounces people who oppose any  inquiry into the nature of divine justice as “fools who despise wisdom.  For we shall benefit ourselves in the above-mentioned study by becoming  wise men who know God in the manner in which He acts and in His  deeds; furthermore, we shall become believers endowed with a stronger  faith in Him than others.” Despite the vigor of this formulation and its  similarity to arguments for philosophical study in general, it is important  to recognize that in Nahmanides’ case it is narrowly focused. Speculation  about theodicy differs from investigation into the existence or unity of  God in a way that illuminates Nahmanides’ fundamental approach to  philosophical pursuits. A good philosopher speculates on the basis of  empirical data. But the revelation of the Torah is an empirical datum par  excellence; consequently, there is no more point in constructing proofs  for doctrines explicitly taught in the revelation than for the proposition  that the sun rises in the morning. At the same time, philosophical  reasoning for the purpose of clarifying those doctrines is not only  sensible but critically important. Although Nahmanides never formulated  this position explicitly, I think that it emerges from the pattern of his  work and the issues that he addressed. It surely helps to explain why he  wrote his magnum opus as a commentary to the revelation and why he  was attracted to kabbalah, which provided, as we have seen, revealed  information about key philosophical questions. This nuanced approach placed Nahmanides in a difficult position  during the controversy of the 1230s. He opposed both untrammeled  speculation and “fools who despise wisdom”; he admired both Maimonides  and the rabbis of Northern France; he felt unreserved enthusiasm for  “The Book of Knowledge” and mixed emotions about the Guide. His own  sophisticated synthesis of speculation and revelation, even in its exoteric  form, could not be mechanically prescribed to the masses or, for that  matter, to ordinary intellectuals. Consequently, the proposal that he  made is a combination of tactful diplomacy and an effort to implement  the values that he considered particularly important under the trying  circumstances of the dispute. — 68 — </page> <page sequence="49"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  His most important letter was directed to the rabbis of Northern  France. It expresses great admiration for the addressees, defends  Maimonides’ orthodoxy with respect to key theological issues, explains  the purpose of the Guide, whose intended audience needs to be appreciated  by the Ashkenazim, and launches into a vigorous, even impassioned  encomium to “The Book of Knowledge.” At this point, Nahmanides was  prepared to offer a concrete proposal: The ban against “The Book of  Knowledge” should be annulled, and the ban against the Guide should  be reformulated to include public study only, which Maimonides himself  had disapproved. In the spirit of R. Hai Gaon’s letter, the pursuit of  philosophy should be discouraged entirely, but since such a level of piety  cannot be enforced for all of Israel, no broader ban is advisable. The distinction between “The Book of Knowledge” and the Guide  accords well with Nahmanides’ fundamental outlook because the former  operates within the context of the revelation while the latter raises  questions that approach the tradition from the outside. The difference,  then, is as much one of structure as of content. The discouragement of  any philosophical study even for the elite goes beyond Nahmanides’  position as it appears in his other writings, and it is likely that he adopted  it because of the needs of the moment. Nonetheless, this proposal too  reflects a genuine uneasiness with speculation and hostility toward the  dominant form of Aristotelianism. Nahmanides, who sought not so  much a religious philosophy as a philosophical religion, embodies an  approach that is reflected to a greater or lesser degree in figures like R.  Meir Abulafia and R. Judah Alfakar and in some of his great successors  among the Talmudists of Christian Spain.72 72 For a full exposition of my perception of Nahmanides’ position, see my master’s  essay, Nahmanides’ Attitude Toward Secular Learning and Its Bearing Upon his Stance  in the Maimonidean Controversy (Columbia University, 1965).

The interpretation of Nahmanides’ proposal is dependent on the resolution of textual  — 69 — </page> <page sequence="50"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response The waning of this phase of the controversy used to be attributed  primarily to nearly universal revulsion at the burning of Maimonides’  works. We now have reason to believe that Nahmanides’ letter played a  major role by persuading the Northern French rabbis to withdraw from  the fray.73 In any event, despite an eruption in the 1280s involving a  relatively minor anti-Maimonist agitator, the dispute about philosophical  study did not regain its status as a cause célèbre until the first decade of  the fourteenth century, when the issue was joined again. In many ways,  the debate was unchanged, but in some respects it had been transformed  in significant and revealing fashion. The controversy began when R. Abba Mari of Lunel initiated a  correspondence with R. Solomon ibn Adret (Rashba) to complain about  the inroads made by extreme rationalism in Provence, especially in the  person of Levi b. Abraham of Villefranche, who advocated an allegorical  understanding of some biblical narratives. The first thing that strikes  the reader of Abba Mari’s work is the impact of philosophy in general  and Maimonides in particular on this “antirationalist.” Science and  metaphysics should be studied only by one who has filled his stomach with bread and meat, as we have learned from  the Rabbi, the teacher of righteousness, from whose mouth we live through  his true statements... built upon the foundation of the Torah in “The Book  of Knowledge” and Guide of the Perplexed, which illuminate the path of  those who have been in darkness and cannot adequately be evaluated by  the greatest of assessors.74 It is true that even in the 1230s, many antirationalists treated  Maimonides himself with considerable respect. We have already noted R.  problems in the letter. This is not the place for a detailed discussion. Suffice it to say  that the emendation of tehazzequ to lo tehazzequ (Kitvei Ramban 1, p. 349), which  eliminates the ban entirely, is, in my view, insupportable. For details, see chapter 5  of my master’s essay and my forthcoming article, “How did Nahmanides Propose to  Resolve the Maimonidean Controversy?” [reprinted in this volume]. 73 See the letter of the Maimonists in Lunel and Narbonne, Zion 34 (1969): 142, and the  discussion by Schochet, Zion 36 (1971): 44. 74 Minhat Qenaot, Preface, p. 4 (unpaginated)=Dimitrovsky, 1, p. 228. For a summary  of the events and arguments of the early fourteenth-century controversy, see Joseph  Sarachek, Faith and Reason (Williamsport, Pennsylvania, 1935), pp. 167-264. Despite  a variety of subsequent studies that will be noted later, Sarachek’s work can still serve  as a useful orientation to the dispute. — 70 — </page> <page sequence="51"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  Solomon b. Abraham’s reference to the study of the Mishneh Torah in his  yeshivah, and Judah Alfakar had distinguished rather sharply between  the author of the Guide and those who had made it into a new Torah.  At the same time, Alfakar had written that he wished that the Guide  had never seen the light of day, and Abba Mari’s encomium to precisely  the two works that were at issue in the earlier controversy is striking  testimony to the status that Maimonides himself had attained among  all parties to the new dispute.75 Not only did Abba Mari express unqualified admiration for  Maimonides; he even defended no less a rationalist than Aristotle  himself. In a passage about the importance of the belief in creation  out of nothing, where Abba Mari was clearly echoing an argument of  Nahmanides, he defended his predecessor’s “accursed Greek” by noting  that in the absence of the information provided by revelation, a gentile  in antiquity could not have been expected to achieve an adequate level  of understanding with respect to this issue. On the contrary, Aristotle  deserves great credit for disseminating an accurate conception of the one  God to a world rife with paganism. Moreover, Abba Mari’s endorsement  of Maimonides’ assertion that creation from nothing cannot be proved  philosophically served him as an explanation for the use of the term hoq  as a designation of the law of the Sabbath. The term is usually used for  regulations whose reasons are unfathomable; in this case, the purpose  of the law, which is to remind us of creation ex nihilo, is clear, but the  belief itself cannot be demonstrated by human reason. Maimonidean  philosophy has been integrated by a Provençal conservative into the  warp and woof of his study of Torah.76 75 For Alfakar, see Qovez Teshuvot ha-Rambam 3, pp. 2b-3a.

The intriguing transformation of Nahmanides’ argument into a defense of Aristotle  deserves brief elaboration. The original point was that miracles demonstrate creation  ex nihilo because God would not have limitless control over matter as primeval as He.  Since miracles are an empirical datum that became well known throughout the world,  the affirmation of the eternity of matter by “the accursed Greek” is a denial of his own  vaunted empiricism. Abba Mari accepts the argument with one small correction: miracles  — 71 — </page> <page sequence="52"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response Abba Mari provoked sharp disagreement from Rashba when he  asserted that gentile philosophical works are not harmful since everyone  recognizes their provenance. Since the legitimacy of Maimonides’ treatises  was surely not at issue, Abba Man’s ire was narrowly focused on what  he perceived as the heretical teachings of the Jewish hyperrationalists.  As he reports the situation, people like Levi b. Abraham understood  Abraham and Sarah as matter and form, the twelve tribes as the twelve  constellations, the alliances of four and five kings in Genesis 14 as the  four elements and the five senses, and Amalek as the evil inclination.77 Such accusations about rationalist allegorization appear in various  works during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Even more seriously,  we find the assertion that certain rationalists regarded verbal prayer as  superfluous and did not observe various commandments either because  they allegorized them or thought that they could fulfill their underlying  purpose in a different manner. Thus, R. Jacob b. Sheshet maintained that  contemporary heretics, in a fashion strikingly reminiscent of Christian  polemic against Judaism, argued, “What is the purpose of this particular  commandment? Reason cannot abide it. It must have been nothing but  an allegory.” Elsewhere, Jacob is quoted to the effect that in addition  to heresies regarding primeval matter, divine providence, and reward  and punishment, these rationalists assert that the purification of one’s  thoughts is a more than adequate substitute for prayer. Moses de Leon  alleged that the adherents of “the books of the Greeks” do not observe  the commandment of taking the four species on the festival of Sukkot  because, they say, the reason the Torah provides is that this will enhance  the joy of the holiday; well, they are happier with their gold, silver, and  clothing than they could possibly be with the four species.78 are attested in a revelation granted to the Jewish people that was not in fact widely  known in Aristotle’s world. Hence, although Nahmanides is correct that creation ex nihilo  can be proven, the demonstration depends on the knowledge of miracles, which is, or at  least was, specifically Jewish knowledge; Maimonides is correct that the doctrine cannot  be proven in a philosophical system uninformed by revelation. From this perspective,  Nahmanides’ position is not an indictment of Aristotle but an exculpation. For a similar  view of Aristotle by a somewhat earlier figure, see Septimus’s citation of Judah ibn  Matka’s Midrash Hokhmah, in Hispano-Jewish Culture in Transition, p. 97. 77 Minhat Qenaot, letter 7, pp. 40-41=Dimitrovsky, ch. 25, pp. 343-344, and elsewhere. 78 For Jacob b.

In these extreme cases, however, the indictments appear  to reflect the behavior of isolated individuals or even what the critic  perceived as the logical consequence or underlying intention of the  philosophical position. One allegation about tefillin refers to a single  person, and Rashba is clearly describing a teaching that was not made  explicit when he observes that “it is evident that their true intention  is that the commandments are not to be taken literally, for why should  God care about the difference between torn and properly slaughtered  meat? Rather, all is allegory and parable.” Although such claims are not  entirely unfounded, the statement that the villains in this indictment  “have regarded the Torah and its commandments as false, and everything  has become permitted to them” was clearly a deduction. Indeed, Rashba  explicitly asserts that the hyperrationalists maintain that everything in  the Torah is allegory from Genesis until—but not beyond—the revelation  at Sinai; nonetheless, he says, it is evident that they really have no faith  in the plain meaning of the commandments either.79 As a result of these concerns, Rashba issued a ban which itself reflects  the changes in this issue since the 1230s. Unlike Nahmanides, Rashba  was sufficiently concerned by the spread of rationalist extremism that  he was prepared to go beyond the very narrow ban advocated by his  79 On tefillin, see Minhat Qenaot, letter 79, p. 152=Dimitrovsky, ch. 88, p. 721, which  bans anyone who understands the commandments in a purely spiritual sense, and cf.  letter  p. 153=Dimitrovsky, ch. 101, p. 735, where it is fairly clear that the concern  was based on a specific statement made by a particular rationalist. Cf. also letter 7,  p. 41=Dimitrovsky, ch. 25, p. 344. The passage in The Book of the Pomegranate cited in  the previous note continues with the allegation that these reprobates also fail to wear  tefillin because they understand the commandment in a spiritual sense. For the more  general assertions, see Minhat Qenaot, letter 20, p. 60=Dimitrovsky, ch. 38, pp. 411- 412, and letter 10, p. 45=Dimitrovsky, ch. 28, p. 360. The last assertion is in a text  that was distributed in connection with the ban; see Dimitrovsky, ch. 100, p. 727. On  neglect of tefillin, see the references in Isadore Twersky, Rabad of Posquières (Cambridge,  Mass., 1962), p. 24, n. 20.

At the eleventh World Congress of  Jewish Studies in 1993, Aviezer Ravitsky described a hitherto unknown commentary on  the Guide by a Samuel of Carcassonne, who indicated quite clearly that the philosopher  need not observe commandments whose purpose he regards as no longer relevant. — 73 — </page> <page sequence="54"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response predecessor and to forbid the study of philosophy and some sciences by  anyone who had not reached the age of twenty-five. On the other hand,  the works of Maimonides were entirely exempted from the prohibition  during subsequent discussions clarifying its scope; the only reason this  remains in some sense a “Maimonidean controversy” is that the targets  of the ban made what Rashba and Abba Mari considered blatantly  illegitimate use of Maimonides’ works to justify their heresies. Though  the distinction between Maimonides and his followers had been made  earlier, it is now far sharper and more fundamental. Thus, when modern  scholars who see Maimonides as a philosophical radical tell us that the  people attacked by Abba Mari were no more dangerous than Maimonides  himself, they impose a reading of the Maimonidean corpus which the  proponents of the ban did not share.80 The validity of the conservatives’ perception of Maimonides is,  of course, only one side of the coin; the other is the validity of their  perceptions of the Maimonists. We have already seen that even the  evidence of the antirationalist pronouncements suggests that assertions  of wholesale rejection of the commandments by more than a handful of  rationalists may be exaggerated. The vigorous response to the ban provides  us with a substantial set of arguments for the religious orthodoxy of the  philosophers and for the value of the maligned philosophical enterprise.  The most extensive of these polemics that remains extant is the apology  for philosophy addressed to Rashba himself by R. Yedaiah Bedershi.81 Though the work is written in a tone of extreme reverence for the  addressee, it concedes virtually nothing to the allegations leveled in the  ban. A handful of Provençal Jews may deserve censure for publicizing  philosophical teachings best left to the elite, but the content of these  teachings is untainted by heresy. The reports of allegorization of biblical  narratives and commandments are wholly false; at most, one philosopher  is known to have argued that the correspondence between the number  of tribes and the number of constellations demonstrates that the Jewish  people is bound by the stars, but even this deplorable position takes the  reality of the twelve tribes for granted. 80 Touati, “La Controverse,” pp. 23-24; A.

Bloch (Lvov, 1809). — 74 — </page> <page sequence="55"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  Moreover, says Yedaiah, the study of philosophy has overwhelming  religious value. It provides proof of the existence and unity of God;  demonstrates the falsehood of determinism, magic, and metempsychosis;  establishes the truth of prophecy and the spiritual character of the  immortal soul; and distinguishes between impossibilities that can  be rendered possible through miracles and those which even divine  omnipotence itself cannot overturn. First and foremost, philosophy  has extirpated what was once the epidemic of anthropomorphism. Here  Yedaiah’s formulation is extraordinarily strong: In the early generations, the corporeal conception of God spread through  virtually the entire Jewish exile... ; however, in all the generations there  arose Geonim and wise men in Spain, Babylonia, and the cities of Andalusia,  who, because of their expertise in the Arabic language, encountered the  great preparatory knowledge that comes with smelling the scent of the  various forms of wisdom, whether to a greater or lesser degree, which have  been translated into that language. Consequently, they began to clarify  many opinions in their study of Torah, especially with respect to the unity  of God and the rejection of corporeality, with particular use of philosophical  proofs taken from the speculative literature.82 The issue of tradition versus philosophical innovation emerges in even  bolder relief than it did in Maimonides’ discussion of anthropomorphism.  Although Yedaiah explicitly denies that the ancient Rabbis were  anthropomorphists, he sees the attaining of a purified conception of  God in the Middle Ages as an achievement of a philosophical enterprise  unaided by tradition but crucially dependent upon familiarity with Arabic  texts. The very essence of the Torah, largely lost through the travails  of exile, was restored through the discipline which the antirationalists  would now undermine. Once again we find the advocates of philosophy referring to non-Jews  in an effort to legitimate speculation. Jacob ben Makhir pointed to the most civilized nations who translate learned works from other languages  into their own... and who revere learning.... Has any nation changed its  religion because of this?... How much less likely is that to happen to us,  who possess a rational Torah.83 82 She’elot u-Teshvot ha-Rashba 1, p. 166. 83 Cited in Yitzhak Baer, A History of the Jews in Christian Spain 1 (Philadelphia, 1961), p. 296. — 75 — </page> <page sequence="56"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response Jacob’s reference to the rationality of Judaism carries significance  that goes beyond the specific point in this text. The fact that these  discussions now take place in a Christian rather than a Muslim context  means that the conviction that Judaism is more rational than its rival  can be mobilized to enhance the importance of philosophical study by  pointing to its value as a polemical tool. When a Jew justified speculation  on the grounds of its usefulness in replying to heretics, the reference  was not necessarily to Christians; nonetheless, when Bedershi tells us  that one advantage of setting criteria for the possibility of miracles is  that it enables us to rule out God’s ability to make Himself corporeal,  the implications for anti-Christian polemic are self-evident. R. Israel b.  Joseph, a fourteenth-century Spanish rabbi who studied with R. Asher  ben Yehiel, vigorously supported the study of “external disciplines”  solely on the basis of their value in supplying “answers to those who  err” and providing the ability “to defeat them in their arguments.” Here  too, while those who err no doubt included philosophical heretics, it is  hard to imagine that R. Israel was not also thinking of the utility of  philosophy for vanquishing the arguments of Christian missionaries.  Hasdai Crescas’ Bittul ‘Iqqarei ha-Nozerim constitutes eloquent testimony  to the importance of philosophical sophistication for the late medieval  Jewish polemicist in Spain, and it can be asserted with full confidence  that no Jewish reader of that work could have come away from it with the  slightest doubt that at least some Jews ought to study philosophy.84 In light of the usefulness of philosophy for anti-Christian polemic, it is  ironic and intriguing that the desire to convert Jews impelled the governor  of Montpellier to take the side of the rationalists at the height of the  controversy. The advocates of philosophy had issued a counterban against  84 For R. Israel b. Joseph ha-Yisre’eli’s remarks, see his commentary to Avot 2:14, cited  in Israel Ta-Shema, “Shiqqulim Pilosofiyyim be-Hakhra‘at ha-Halakhah bi-Sefarad,”  Sefunot 18 (1985): 105. R. Israel noted that these external disciplines cannot be  approached safely before the reader has become a mature Talmudic scholar; hence,  the rabbis forbade one to teach higgayon or Greek wisdom to one’s son. The thrust of  his observation, however, is permissive: It is prohibited for the father to teach his son,  but it is permissible for the father to study on his own. See Saul Lieberman, Hellenism  in Jewish Palestine (New York, 1962), pp. 102-104. On Crescas, see Bittul ‘Iqqarei ha- Nozerim, ed. by Daniel J. Lasker (Ramat Gan, 1990), or Lasker’s Jewish Philosophical  Polemics Against Christianity in the Middle Ages (New York, 1977). On the use of more  rigorous philosophical arguments for polemical purposes, see also Shalom Rosenberg,  Logiqah ve-Ontologiah ba-Pilosophiah ha-Yehudit ba-Me’ah ha-Yod-Dalet (Hebrew  University dissertation, 1974), p. 44.

Abba Mari informs  us that although the governor did not grant all their requests, he lent some  support because he was convinced that if Jews were to prohibit anything  but Talmudic study for a substantial period of a person’s life, this would  create a situation in which no Jew would ever convert to Christianity.85 There is strong reason to believe that a majority of the Jews in  Montpellier sided with the rationalists.86 The philosophical culture of  85 The phrase that I have translated “talmudic study” literally means “the discipline  (hokhmah) that you call Gamaliel” (Minhat Qenaot, letter 73, p. 142=Dimitrovsky, ch.  92, p. 701). For the identification of “Gamaliel” with Talmud, see Heinrich Graetz,  Geschichte der Juden (Leipzig, 1863), 7, p. 276; Ch. Merchavia, Ha-Talmud bi-Re’i ha- Nazrut (Jerusalem, 1970), p. 211, and Dimitrovsky, ad loc. (“apparently this refers to  the Talmud”). For the view that “Gamaliel” means medicine, see David Kaufmann, Die  Sinne (Budapest, 1884), p. 7, n. 12; D. Margalit, “’Al Galenus ve-Gilgulo ha-‘Ivri Gamliel,”  Sinai 33 (1953) : 75-77; Judah Rosenthal’s review of Merchavia, Kiryat Sefer 47 (1972):  29; Joseph Shatzmiller, “Bein Abba Mari la-Rashba: ha-Massa ve-ha-Mattan she-qadam  la-Herem be-Barcelona,” Mehqarim be-Toledot ‘Am Yisrael ve-Erez Yisrael 3 (Haifa, 1974),  p. 127. I cannot see why a Christian would find it necessary to describe medicine by its  presumed Jewish name, especially since the ban does not call it Gamaliel, or even why  the exclusion of medicine would need to be mentioned at all in this context. The fact  that this would constitute the only attested use of Gamaliel in so broad a sense also  militates against the identification. It is true that Talmud was not normally called a  hokhmah, but in the context of this ban, I can easily see a Christian using the equivalent  term, presumably scientia. Moreover, the Christian argument that the study of rabbinic  literature is an impediment to conversion is attested as far back as Justinian’s Novella  146 and was reiterated in the 1240s by Odo of Chateauroux. For Justinian, see the text  and translation in Amnon Linder, The Jews in Roman Imperial Legislation (Jerusalem,  1987), pp. 405-410; for Odo, see the text in Merchavia, p. 450 (“. . . hanc esse causam  precipuam que iudeos in sua perfidia retinet obstinatos”). Because the motive assigned  by Abba Mari is so congenial to his own position in the controversy, we must read it  with some skepticism; note Kaufmann’s remark (loc. cit.) that the antirationalist Yosef  Yavetz would have given a great deal to have known this quotation. In light of Odo’s  assertion, however, the report is entirely plausible.  Note too Kaufmann’s argument that philosophical allegory may have been influenced  by Christian allegory and that this connection led to the hope for conversion through  philosophical study; see his “Simeon b. Josefs Sendschreiben an Menachem b. Salomo,”  in Jubelschrift zum Neunzigsten Geburtstag des Dr. L. Zunz (Berlin, 1884), German section,  p. 147. I doubt that Christian influence on rationalist allegorizarion was decisive, and  the main point appears to have been that talmudic study retards conversion.  On the counterban and the governor, see the references in Marc Saperstein, “The  Conflict over the Rashba’s Herem on Philosophical Study: A Political Perspective,”  Jewish History 1:2 (1986): 37, n. 19. 86 Shatzmiller has argued this point persuasively in “Bein Abba Mari la-Rashba,” pp. 128-130. — 77 — </page> <page sequence="58"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response Provençal Jewry was so pervasive that rationalist sermons were delivered  in synagogues and even at weddings. Opposition to the ban came from  the distinguished Perpignan Talmudist R. Menahem ha-Meiri, who  argued that spiritual damage to a handful of people cannot be allowed to  undermine entire fields of study, that even the books of the Greeks have  great religious value, that Jews cannot allow gentiles to mock them for their  intellectual backwardness, and that Provence can boast a variety of figures  who have distinguished themselves in both talmudic and philosophical  learning. Here again the antirationalist party demonstrated how much  the atmosphere had changed since the 1230s: The reply to ha-Meiri by  a disciple of Abba Mari fully conceded the great value of philosophy and  pointed out that the ban was directed only at the young.87 Ha-Meiri himself was a paradigm of the ideal toward which moderate  rationalists strove and to which even extreme rationalists paid lip  service: a Talmudist of standing who valued philosophy and the sciences  and devoted himself to their study. Ha-Meiri’s openness to general  culture combined with his well-known attitude of toleration toward  Christianity suggests an additional dimension of the issue that we have  been addressing. Intellectual involvement with the dominant society  often goes hand in hand with social involvement of a relatively benign  sort. By this time, Christian intellectuals had attained an impressive  level of philosophical sophistication to the point where ha-Meiri could  express concern about their contempt for ignorant Jews; consequently,  familiarity began to breed respect. In ha-Meiri’s case, this respect led  to the formulation of a wholly novel halakhic category which roughly  means civilized people, a category which helped to exempt Christians  from a series of discriminatory Talmudic statements. While this is not a  case of incorporating an external value or doctrine into Rabbinic law— the Christendom that ha-Meiri knew had hardly developed a theory of  religious toleration—it probably is an instance of reexamining halakhah  and Jewish values in light of habits of mind developed by exposure to a  culture shared with the gentile environment. Once again, the core of the  Torah was touched—or its deeper meaning revealed—through insights  inspired by involvement in general culture.88 87 See “Hoshen Mishpat,” Jubelschrift...

Virtually without exception,  rabbinic figures of the first rank, whose pursuit of Talmudic study was  their central preoccupation, either devoted some time to the study of  “wisdom” or expressed no opposition to its cultivation.89 Rashba himself was not uninfluenced by philosophical ideas. This  would be evident even from Bedershi’s apology, which clearly assumed  that its recipient was receptive to the major thrust of the argument, but  it is also explicit in Rashba’s own writings. In one elaborate responsum,  for example, he analyzed the parameters within which philosophical  arguments can be brought to bear on the reinterpretation of sacred texts,  and he staked out a position that we would expect from a disciple of  Nahmanides: there is a legitimate place for such arguments as long as  the critical demands of tradition are accorded unchallenged supremacy.90  R. Yom Tov Ishbili (Ritba), perhaps the greatest rabbinic figure in the  generation following Rashba, wrote a work exemplifying the same general  posture. He defended Maimonides against the strictures in Nahmanides’  studies cited there. See now the important analysis by Moshe Halbertal, “R. Menahem  ha-Meiri: Bein Torah le-Hokhmah,” Tarbiz 63 (1994): 63-118, which points to a specific  philosophical context for ha-Meiri’s position. 89 See Israel Ta-Shema’s “Rabbi Yona Gerondi: Spiritualism and Leadership,” presented  at the Jewish Theological Seminary’s 1989 conference on “Jewish Mystical Leadership,  1200-1270,” esp. p. 11.

(I should probably not press the argument from Bedershi’s perception  too hard since Ktav Hitnazzelut takes for granted the questionable proposition that  Rashba would recognize the value of philosophy because of its ability to refute the  belief in metempsychosis, a kabbalistic doctrine that Rashba probably endorsed.) — 79 — </page> <page sequence="60"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response commentary to the Pentateuch while at the same time affirming that in  the final analysis Nahmanides is usually correct.91 The endorsement of at least a moderate level of rationalism no  doubt resulted from the importance of philosophy in traditional Spanish  Jewish culture, but we should not underestimate the impact of the heroic  image of Maimonides. Just as Nahmanides’ embrace of kabbalah made  it very difficult to reject mysticism as a heresy, Maimonides’ devotion  to philosophy rendered its thorough delegitimation by Sephardic Jews  almost impossible. Even some kabbalists attempted to synthesize their  discipline with a reinterpreted Maimonidean corpus, though others went  so far as to assert that the author of the Guide had seen the error of  his ways once the secrets of the hidden wisdom were revealed to him.  This last example is a rare case of the exception that really proves the  rule, because it demonstrates that Maimonides’ position stood as such  a hallmark of legitimacy that some Jews could comfortably maintain a  contrary position only by forcibly redefining the Maimonidean stance.92 Moderate rationalism was, of course, not the only approach endorsed  by Provençal and Spanish Jews in the later Middle Ages. Despite the  exaggerated nature of the conservative manifestoes issued during the  controversy, some late medieval thinkers really did espouse radical  positions with respect to many philosophical and exegetical issues. When  Jacob b. Sheshet denounced rationalists who “assert that the world is  primeval... , that divine providence does not extend below the sphere  of the moon... , that there is no reward for the righteous or punishment  for the wicked... and that there is no need to pray but only to purify  one’s thoughts,”93 he was engaging in hyperbole but not in fantasy.

The works of Samuel ibn Tibbon, Moses Narboni,  Joseph ibn Kaspi, Gersonides, and Isaac Albalag constitute but part of  a corpus of literature attesting to a flourishing tradition of vigorous  rationalism that severely tested the prevailing boundaries of religious  orthodoxy. Philosophers of this stripe were often prepared to make an explicit  case against excessive concentration in Talmudic study. The most famous  example of this attitude is the story ibn Kaspi tells in his will about the  problem that arose during a party in his home when “the accursed maid”  placed a dairy spoon in a pot of meat. Poor ibn Kaspi had to go to the  local rabbi, who kept him waiting for hours in a state of near starvation  before apprising him of the halakhah. Nonetheless, he tells us, he was  not embarrassed by his ignorance, since his philosophical sophistication  compensated for the shortcomings in his halakhic expertise. “Why,” he  asks, “should a ruling or directive regarding the great existence or unity  of God be inferior to a small dairy spoon?”94 Other expressions of this approach are less amusing but no less  striking. Some Jews demonstrated the obscurantism of those who  devote their lives to talmudic study by pointing to the Talmud’s own  assertion that the phrase “He has set me in dark places like the dead of  old” (Lamentations 3:6) refers to the Talmud of Babylon. R. Judah ibn  Abbas maintained that people who study Talmud constantly “neglect the  proper service and knowledge of God” and described Talmudic novellae  and Tosafot as a waste of valuable time. It is a matter of no small interest  that Hasdai Crescas wrote his philosophical refutation of Christianity  in Aragonese or Catalan so that Jews could have ready access to his  arguments; there was thus a substantial, sophisticated Jewish audience  in late medieval Spain who could follow a difficult vernacular text but not  a difficult Hebrew one. 94 Israel Abrahams, Hebrew Ethical Wills 1 (Philadelphia, 1926), pp. 151-152. The somewhat  awkward use of the term “great,” which technically modifies unity in the original, is clearly  intended to evoke Maimonides’ straightforward understanding of the Talmudic contrast  between great and small matters. See above, n. 39. On Ibn Kaspi’s intellectual stance, see  Isadore Twerksy, “Joseph ibn Kaspi: Portrait of a Medieval Jewish Intellectual,” in Studies  in Medieval Jewish History and Literature [1], pp. 231-257. — 81 — </page> <page sequence="62"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response Ibn Kaspi himself, in a work marked by the arresting assertion  that Job’s suffering was a just consequence of his failure to pursue a  philosophical understanding of his faith, utilized the traditionalists’  affirmation of the importance of Talmudic study to support the  indispensability of philosophy. After all, he argued, there exist both  physical commandments and commandments of the heart or intellect.  Everyone agrees that with respect to the former, an understanding of  the intellectual underpinning is eminently desirable. “Why else should  we toil to study the Talmud? We might just as well be satisfied with  the rulings of Maimonides and R. Isaac Alfasi.” Now there is surely no  basis for distinguishing the latter commandments from the former with  respect to this principle, and books of physics and metaphysics stand in  the same relationship to the commandments of the heart as the Talmud  does to the physical commandments. Originally, such philosophical  works were written by Jewish sages like Solomon, but “we were exiled  because of our sins, and those matters have now come to be attributed  to the Greeks” except for scattered references in the Talmud. In other  words, one cannot affirm the critical importance of Talmudic study  without being logically compelled to grant at least equal value to the  pursuit of philosophy and the sciences.95 On the other side of the ledger, R. Asher b. Yehiel, who was born and  trained in Germany, brought with him a pejorative attitude toward the  value of general culture. In responding to the suggestion that no one  without expertise in Arabic should render a legal decision, he maintained  that his reasoning powers in Torah were in no way inferior to those  95 On the “dark places” and the Talmud, see Me’irat ‘Einayim, p. 62; Isadore Twersky,  “Religion and Law,” in Religion in a Religious Age, p. 77, and Twersky, “R. Yeda‘yah ha- Penini,” Altmann Festschrift, p. 71. The Talmudic passage is in Sanhedrin 24a. For Ibn  Abbas, see Goldreich’s quotations from the manuscript of Ya’ir Nativ (Oxford 1280, p.  50a) in Me’irat ‘Einayim, pp. 412-413. The oft-quoted curriculum in ibn Abbas’s work,  which culminates with the study of metaphysics, was published by Asaf, Meqorot 2, pp.  29-33. On the vernacular original of Bittul ‘Iqqarei ha-Nozerim, see Lasker’s edition, pp.  13, 33. Note too the Castilian Proverbos Morales by the fourteenth-century R. Shem Tov  ibn Ardutiel, The Moral Proverbs of Santob de Carrion: Jewish Wisdom in Christian Spain,  ed. by T. A. Perry (Princeton, 1988).  If we contemplate for a moment the magnitude of Job’s suffering, we can begin to  appreciate the importance attached to the philosophic quest by a man willing to propose  ibn Kaspi’s explanation for such torment. This explanation appears along with the very  clever argument linking Talmudic and philosophical study in Shulhan Kesef: Be’ur ‘al  Iyyov, in ‘Asarah Kelei Kesef, ed. by J. Last (Pressburg, 1903), pp. 170-172. — 82 — </page> <page sequence="63"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  of Spanish Rabbis, “even though I do not know your external wisdom.  Thank the merciful God who saved me from it.” The pursuit of such  wisdom, he said, leads people away from the fear of God and encourages  the vain attempt to integrate alien pursuits with Torah. Still, even R.  Asher describes philosophers as very wise men, and an assessment of  Spanish Jewish attitudes would have to assign greater weight to the  remarkable suggestion that he rejected than to the negative reaction  that he expressed.96 That suggestion reflects a real and significant phenomenon: the  halakhic decision-making and Talmudic study of Provençal and Spanish  rabbis were sometimes affected by philosophical considerations. To begin  with the most famous example in Maimonides himself, the omission  in the Mishneh Torah of talmudic laws based on the intervention of the  creatures that the rabbis called shedim was almost certainly the result of  philosophically motivated skepticism. R. Zerahiah Halevi cited technical  logical terminology and philosophical references in a halakhic discussion.  Conceptions of providence were brought to bear on decisions regarding  the remarriage of a woman whose first two husbands had died. A more  general illustration of the pervasiveness of the philosophical atmosphere  emerges from the first sentence of R. Yeruham b. Meshullam’s introduction  to a work of Talmudic scholarship, where he informs us how “the scholars  of [philosophical] research” have classified the considerations leading to  the pursuit of wisdom.97 96 See She’elot u-Teshuvot ha-Rosh (Venice, 1603), 55:9. Cf.

Shapiro’s forthcoming essay in Maimonidean Studies. I am unpersuaded by  Jose Faur’s effort in his generally perceptive ‘Iyyunim be-Mishneh Torah le-ha-Rambam:  Sefer ha-Madda (Jerusalem, 1978), pp. l-2 n. 1, to minimize the philosophical  motivation for the omission of shedim.

R. Isaac Kanpanton produced  guidelines which required the student to investigate the correspondence  between the language and meaning of a Talmudic text with exquisite  care and to determine the full range of possible interpretations so  that the exegetical choices of the major commentators would become  clear. In setting forth this form of investigation, or ‘iyyun, Kanpanton  made explicit reference to logical terminology, and Daniel Boyarin has  recently made a compelling argument that the system as a whole and all  its major components originated in the medieval philosophical milieu.  He maintains that Jewish scholars in the final days of the Spanish Jewish community saw  logic as the road to attaining truth in all sciences, including that of the  Torah. Any argument which did not qualify under the canons of logical  order was faulty in their eyes. Logical works and principles served as the  foundation for scientific and philosophical investigation, and they pointed  the way toward valid proof and the avoidance of error in these fields. Since  the science of the Talmud differed in its language and its problems from the  other sciences—mainly because it is essentially exegetical—the need was  felt for general works specific to this field which would direct investigation  there.98 These were indeed the final days of Spanish Jewry, and the  connection between philosophical pursuits and the behavior of the  community in extremis has exercised analysts both medieval and  modern. Conservatives like R. Isaac Arama renewed the attack against  allegorists by asking why they need the Torah at all. When it corresponds  to philosophical truths, they accept it literally, and when it does not, they  explain it figuratively; in either case, the knowledge they had before the  revelation is coterminous with what they know after it. R. Yosef Yavetz  attributed the relatively large number of conversions around the time of  the expulsion to the corrupting influence of philosophical relativism, a  98 Daniel Boyarin, Ha-’Iyyun ha-Sefaradi (Jerusalem, 1989), pp. 48-49. The main  documentation of Boyarin’s general thesis is on pp. 47-68. For a similar development  in the field of biblical exegesis, see Shimon Shalem, “Ha-Metodah ha-Parshanit shel  Yosef Taitazak ve-Hugo,” Sefunot 11 (1971-77): 115-134. — 84 — </page> <page sequence="65"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  judgment endorsed in the twentieth century by Yitzhak Baer. R. Abraham  Bibago, on the other hand, writing in the middle of the fifteenth century,  denied that philosophically oriented Jews were any less steadfast than  pure Talmudists; spiritual weakness is not dependent upon intellectual  orientation. More generally, Bibago’s attack against extreme rationalists  and especially against opponents of philosophy tends to demonstrate  that both groups were active in late medieval Spain. Bibago himself was a  relatively moderate rationalist who fits well into the category of Spanish  Jews like R. Isaac Abravanel who studied philosophy but attempted to  counter rationalist extremism through a conservative interpretation of  Maimonides and his legacy. When such a person denounces fools who  call “people of intellect and reason” heretics, his remarks deserve special  notice; apparently, Spain too was not without thoroughgoing critics of  the philosophical enterprise for whom even the rationalism of Bibago  was an impermissible deviation from pristine Judaism.99 There is little evidence for the outright Averroist-style skepticism  that Yitzhak Baer blames for the apostasy of beleaguered Iberian Jews.  Nevertheless, it seems fair to say that an acculturated community  is a less likely candidate for martyrdom than an insular one. Imagine  two people with equal faith in the truth of Judaism confronting the  executioner’s sword. The first is an admiring participant in the culture he  is being told to embrace, however much he rejects its religion; the second  responds to that environment with visceral revulsion. While there are  no easy formulas for determining the willingness to be martyred, the  second type, who represents the Ashkenazic Jew of the first crusade, is  surely more likely to choose death. On this level, the Jews of Spain paid  a spiritual price for integration into the cultural milieu of their potential  persecutors. 99 See Yavetz’s Sefer Or ha-Hayyim (Lemberg, 1874), ch. 2, and the references in Baer, A  History of the Jews in Christian Spain 2, p. 509, n. 12, and in Isaac E.

Jewish physicians remained prominent  throughout the Middle Ages, and Maimonides’ medical treatises contain  insights of lasting value. Gersonides made impressive contributions  to astronomy, including the preparation of astronomical tables at the  request of influential Christians, and fourteenth-century Provençal  Jews continued to translate numerous scientific texts. Ibn Kaspi took  pleasure in the unvarnished meaning of a Talmudic text which asserted  that gentile scholars had defeated the sages of Israel in a debate about  astronomy; this, he said, demonstrates that non-Jews have something  to teach us and that their works should not be ignored.100 The relationship between astronomy and astrology raised scientific  and theological questions which confound the usually predictable  boundaries between rationalists and their opponents. From a modern  perspective, Maimonides’ vigorous opposition to astrology seems  precisely what we ought to expect from a person of his intellectual  bent. To many medievals, however, astrology was not only validated  by Rabbinic texts; it was a science like all others. Gersonides, for  example, argued that the discipline was often empirically validated,  and it was taken for granted that miracles must overcome not only the  regularities of physics but the astrological order as well. At the same  time, nonrationalist religious considerations could produce opposition  100 For a succinct summary of Maimonides’ contributions to medieval medicine, see S.  Muntner, “Gedulato ve-Hiddushav shel ha-Rambam bi-Refuah,” in Ha-Ram Bamza”l  [sic]: Qovez Torani-Madda‘i, ed. by Y. L. Maimon (Jerusalem, 1955), pp. 264-266.

Moses Taku. In the case of Gersonides,  astronomy and astrology were kept rigorously separated, so that the  affirmation of astrological truths had no adverse effect on his important  astronomical studies.101 Although Spain and Provence were the major centers of philosophical  and scientific pursuits among the Jews of the high and late Middle Ages,  they did not enjoy a monopoly. Byzantine Jewry lived in a culture which  preserved much of the Greek legacy of antiquity, and its intellectual  profile has been described as “catholic in outlook and integrated with  its environment. Secular studies were pursued as much as traditional  religious studies.”102 Israel Ta-Shema, who has read substantial portions  of the massive, unpublished works of Byzantine Jews available in the  Institute of Microfilmed Hebrew Manuscripts in Jerusalem, has spoken to  me with wonderment of the immense size and scope of the encyclopedic  compositions produced by that Jewry, although he is less impressed by  their depth or creativity. Yemenite Jews, in part because of the influence of the Muslim  environment and in large measure because of the inspiration provided by  Maimonides, produced works reflecting familiarity with the full range of  101 For Maimonides’ position, see his letter in Alexander Marx, “The Correspondence  between the Rabbis of Southern France and Maimonides about Astrology,” Hebrew Union  College Annual 3 (1926): 311-358.

Bowman, The Jews of Byzantium: 1204-1453 (University, Alabama, 1985), p.  168.

In an exceptionally strong formulation, R. Perahiah  b. Meshullam wrote that “without the sciences of the intelligibles there  would be no Torah,” and Hoter b. Shlomoh reiterated the standard  justification of scientific study as a preparation for metaphysical  speculation.103 Similarly, the successor culture of medieval Spain was largely true  to its heritage. The relative decline and stagnation of Muslim culture in  the late Middle Ages had taken its toll on the intellectual creativity of  Eastern Jewry, but under the stimulus of the Spanish immigration, the  Jews of the Ottoman Empire displayed a renewal of cultural ferment.  While this activity was mainly exegetical and homiletical, it included the  study and translation of philosophical works. A recently published text  provides a striking glimpse into a cast of mind which takes all learning as  its province. A young scholar felt insulted when his town was denigrated  as climatically unfit for the production of intellectuals. In an indignant  response, he challenged the critic to do battle: Come out to the field and let us compete in our knowledge of the Bible,  the Mishnah, and the Talmud, Sifra and Sifrei and all of Rabbinic literature;  in the external sciences—the practical and theoretical fields of science,  the science of nature, and of the Divine; in logic... , geometry, astronomy,  and law; in the natural sciences—the longer commentary and the shorter  commentary, Generatio et Corruptio, De Anima and Meteora, De Animalia  and Ethics. . .

At the same time, we have interesting evidence of opposition to  philosophical study in this community. R. Menahem de Lonzano  published an attack against philosophy which pointed to serious  religious errors that it had inspired even in great figures of the past  including Maimonides, R. Joseph Albo, and, strikingly, R. Bahya ibn  Pakuda. We have already seen that Bahya decidedly belonged among  the strongest advocates of speculation, but the piety that suffuses  the bulk of his ethical work served to mute his rationalistic message  and insulate him from serious attack by most anti-rationalists. De  Lonzano was sensitive to this message and complained that Bahya, like  Maimonides, placed metaphysics at the pinnacle of human endeavor  despite the implications for the status of straightforward study of the  Torah; indeed, the broadside cites a nameless rabbinic contemporary  in Istanbul who wondered why the Guide had been burned while The  Duties of the Heart had remained untouched. On the one hand, it is clear  that de Lonzano’s attack reflected the view of an influential circle of  Talmudists. It is equally clear, however, that he was deeply concerned  about the likelihood that he would be subjected to scathing criticism for  his position, and he describes contemporaries who advocated the study  of halakhic codes rather than the Talmud so that they could devote their  time to other disciplines. While we cannot know with any certainty  why this critique of philosophy was omitted from the second, early  seventeenth-century version of de Lonzano’s book, the opposition that  it no doubt engendered is as likely an explanation as any.105 Ottoman  Jewry, though on the verge of cultural decline and by no means univocal  in its attitude to general culture, remained generally loyal to the legacy  of medieval Sephardic thought. his article, “Ha-Pe‘ilut ha-Intelleqtualit be-qerev Yehudei ha-Imperiah ha-‘Ottomanit  ba-Me‘ot ha-Shesh-‘Esreh ve-ha-Sheva‘-‘Esreh,” Tarbiz 53 [1984]: 591.)

There is no question that Northern French and  German Jews, unlike their Sephardi counterparts, were deeply resistant  to philosophical inquiry, largely because of the absence of a surrounding  philosophical culture during their formative period; a Jewish civilization  which reached maturity unaccustomed to speculation will be particularly  sensitive to its alien dangers. Certainly the image of the Ashkenazim  among Spanish and Provençal advocates of philosophy was that of  benighted obscurantists. Radak wrote to Alfakar, “You and other wise  men engage in the pursuit of wisdom and do not follow the words of the  Ashkenazim, who have banned anyone who does so.” R. Isaac of Acre,  who became an advocate of such inquiry late in his life, reacted with  disdain to those who refuse to examine a rational argument or to accept it. Rather, they call one to whom God has  given the ability to understand rational principles... a heretic and non- believer, and his books they call external books, because they do not have  the spirit needed to understand a rational principle. This is the nature of  the rabbis of France and Germany and those who are like them. During the controversy of the 1230s, Maimonists in Narbonne  sent a letter to Spain with a particularly vitriolic denunciation of  the French rabbis as fools and lunatics with clogged minds, who are  devoted to superstitious nonsense and immersed in the fetid waters of  unilluminated caves.106 Even in the context of philosophical speculation narrowly defined,  the situation was not quite so simple. A paraphrase of Saadya’s Beliefs and  Opinions that made its way to early medieval Ashkenaz had a profound  effect on the theology of significant segments of that Jewry. Unusual  works like Ketav Tamim and Sefer ha-Maskil demonstrate familiarity  with some speculative literature, and the author of the latter treatise  106 For Radak, see Qovez Teshuvot ha-Rambam, p. 3b. For Isaac of Acre, see Goldreich’s  quotation from Oxford ms. 1911 in Me’irat ‘Einayim, p. 412. The letter from Narbonne  was published by Shatzmiller in Zion 34 (1969): 143-144. — 90 — </page> <page sequence="71"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  was conversant with a variety of up-to-date scientific theories and  experiments. In general, technological advances, experimental results,  and observations of nature raised no serious religious problems, and  there was no intrinsic reason for people unaffected by a theory of  propaedeutic studies to connect them to philosophy. We should not be  surprised, therefore, that Ashkenazic literature, probably even more  than that of the Sephardim, reflects the keen interest and penetrating  eye of Jews evincing intense curiosity about the natural and mechanical  phenomena that surrounded them.107 Moreover, the moment we broaden  the question to include the Jewish response to the surrounding culture in  general, we discover the possibility of creative interaction that may have  transformed important aspects of Ashkenazic piety and thought. First of all, the religious confrontation with the Christian world  impelled some Jews to study Latin as a polemical tool. More important, the  ruthless pursuit of straightforward interpretation, or peshat, by twelfth- century Jewish commentators in France can plausibly be seen as a Jewish  reaction to nonliteral Christian exegesis. A Jewish polemicist insisting  107 On the paraphrase of Saadya and its influence, see Ronald C. Kiener, “The Hebrew  Paraphrase of Saadiah Gaon’s Kitab al-Amanat Wa’l-I‘tiqadat,” AJS Review 11 (1986):  1-25, and Yosef Dan, Torat ha-Sod shel Hasidut Ashkenaz (Jerusalem, 1986), especially  pp. 22-24. On science and philosophy in Sefer ha-Maskil, see Ta-Shema, “Sefer ha- Maskil,” pp. 435, 437-438.  Though the observation about propaedeutic studies is mine, I owe the vigorous  formulation about the Ashkenazim’s keen interest in the world around them to  a conversation with Ta-Shema; cf. Noah Shapira, “‘Al ha-Yeda‘ ha-Tekhni ve-ha- Tekhnologi shel Rashi,” Korot 3 (1963): 145-161, where Rashi’s extensive technological  information is treated, probably wrongly, as exceptional. See now the brief but very  important note by Y. Tzvi Langermann, “Hibbur Ashkenazi Bilti Noda‘ be-Madda‘ei ha- Teva‘,” Kiryat Sefer 62 (1988-89): 448-449, where he describes a scientific treatise by  a fourteenth-century French Jew who was particularly interested in practical science,  including various instruments, and who reported that he had written a different work  demonstrating how scientific knowledge sheds new light on the understanding of  Torah. See also n. 131 below.  The warm, respectful welcome extended to R. Abraham ibn Ezra by prominent Tosafists  certainly does not bespeak instinctive hostility to bearers of a broader cultural  orientation. For Ta-Shema’s more problematic assertion that Ashkenaz boasted full- fledged rationalist allegorizers, see his “Sefer ha-Maskil,” 421; if such an approach had  really attained an appreciable level of visibility in Northern Europe, it is hard to imagine  that we would not find more substantial criticisms of it in the extant literature. Finally,  it is worth noting an oral observation by Haym Soloveitchik that the major rabbinic  luminaries of Northern France are not among the signatories of the ban against the  Guide and Sefer ha-Madda. — 91 — </page> <page sequence="72"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response upon peshat in a debate with a Christian could not easily return home  and read the Bible in a way that violated the very principles of contextual,  grammatical interpretation that he had just been passionately defending.  Even explanations that are not labeled as anti-Christian can be motivated  by the desire to avoid Christological assertions. There is, moreover,  substantial evidence of scholarly interchange of a cordial, nonpolemical  sort among Jews and Christians attempting to uncover the sense of the  biblical text, and the Jewish approach had a considerable impact on the  churchmen of St. Victor and other Christian commentators. Finally,  the fact that the explosion of Jewish learning and literary activity took  place in twelfth-century France may well be related to the concomitant  “renaissance of the twelfth century” in the larger society.108 The stereotype of the narrow Ashkenazi sometimes included the  assertion that even biblical study was ignored, and there is a degree of  validity in this image, particularly in the later Middle Ages.109 Nonetheless,  108 See Aryeh Grabois, “The Hebraica Veritas and Jewish-Christian Intellectual Relations  in the Twelfth Century,” Speculum 50 (1975): 613-634; David Berger, “Mission to the  Jews and Jewish-Christian Contacts in the Polemical Literature of the High Middle  Ages,” The American Historical Review 91 (1986): 576-591; Berger, “Gilbert Crispin, Alan  of Lille, and Jacob ben Reuben: A Study in the Transmission of Medieval Polemic,”  Speculum 49 (1974): 34-47 (on the use of Latin texts by a Jewish polemicist); Avraham  Grossman, “Ha-Pulmus ha-Yehudi-ha-Nozri ve-ha-Parshanut ha-Yehudit la-Miqra be- Zarfat ba-Me’ah ha-Yod-Bet (le-Parashat Ziqqato shel Ri Qara el ha-Pulmus),” Zion 51  (1986): 29-60 (for persuasive examples of unlabeled anti-Christian commentaries);  Grossman, Hakhmei Zarfat ha-Rishonim, 473-504; Beryl Smalley, The Study of the Bible  in the Middle Ages (Notre Dame, 1964); Elazar Touitou, “Shitato ha-Parshanit shel ha- Rashbam ‘al Reqa‘ ha-Meziut ha-Historit shel Zemanno,” in ‘Iyyunim be-Sifrut Hazal  ba-Miqra u-be-Toledot Yisrael: Muqdash li-Prof. Ezra Zion Melamed (Ramat Gan, 1982),  ed. by Y.

Strauch’s Dukus Horant:  Wanderer Zwischen Zwei Welten (Amsterdam and Adanta, 1990) analyzes a fairly typical  medieval German romance written or copied by a fourteenth century German Jew in  Yiddish (or at least in Hebrew characters with some specifically Jewish terminology).  Note also Dan, Torat ha-Sod, pp. 37-39, for some general observations on the impact  of folk beliefs about magic, astrology, and the like on Ashkenazic Jewry. Finally, Ivan  G. Marcus has now presented an analysis of an Ashkenazic ritual for the purpose of  illuminating the manner in which responses to Christian society can make their way  into the religious life of both scholars and the laity; see his Rituals of Childhood: Jewish  Acculturation in Medieval Europe (New Haven and London, 1996). 109 See Profiat Duran’s introduction to Ma‘aseh Efod, p. 41, and the discussion in Isadore  Twersky, “Religion and Law,” in Religion in a Religious Age, ed. by Goitein, pp. 74-77.  — 92 — </page> <page sequence="73"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  the innovative biblical exegesis in twelfth-century France demonstrates  that this perception is selective and skewed. Not only did Ashkenazic  Jews study Bible; biblical exegesis served as both a battleground and a  bridge where Jews and Christians came into frequent, creative contact  as enemies and as partners. In the field of biblical study, interaction is firmly established; what  requires elucidation is the extent and nature of its effects. We face a more  fundamental problem with respect to the most intriguing question of all:  Did the revolutionary use of dialectic in the Talmudic methodology of the  Northern French Tosafists owe anything to the intellectual upheaval in  the larger society? There is hardly any evidence of Jewish familiarity in  Ashkenaz with the study of canon law and philosophy, which were the two  major areas in which the search for contradictions or inconsistencies and  their subsequent resolution began to play a central role. It is even more  difficult to imagine that Christians, whose familiarity with the Talmud was  virtually nil, could have been much influenced by Tosafists. At the same  time, the very individuals who pursued the new methodologies in fields  unknown by the members of the other faith met on the terrain of biblical  studies. Rashbam, who was a Tosafist as well as a peshat-oriented biblical  exegete, is a good Jewish example. In light of these well-documented  contacts, it surely cannot be ruled out—indeed, it seems overwhelmingly  likely—that some taste of the exciting new approaches was transmitted.  When the German pietists wanted to criticize the Tosafist approach, they  denounced the utilization of “Gentile dialectic” (dial tiqa [dialeqtiqah]  shel goyim); though we are under no obligation to endorse the historical  judgment of the pietists, the criticism establishes at least a threshold  level of familiarity with the term and its application.110 See also Mordechai Breuer, “Min‘u Beneikhem min ha-Higgayon,” in Mikhtam le-David:  Sefer Zikhron ha-Rav David Ochs, ed. by Yitzhak Gilat and Eliezer Stern (Ramat Gan,  1978), pp. 242-264, and Frank Taimage, “Keep Your Sons From Scripture: The Bible in  Medieval Jewish Scholarship and Spirituality,” in Understanding Scripture: Explorations  of Jewish and Christian Traditions of Interpretation, ed. by Clemens Thoma and Michael  Wyschogrod (New York, 1987), pp. 81-101.

The system of penances that they introduced into the  process of repentance is no longer regarded as a defining characteristic of  their movement; nonetheless, that system remains a major development  in the history of Jewish piety, and despite a smattering of antecedents in  rabbinic literature, it is overwhelmingly likely that the influence of the  Christian environment was decisive.111 With respect to quintessentially  religious behavior, the inhibition against following Christian models  should have been overwhelming, and I think that the psychological  factor that overcame it was analogous to the competitive imitation  that we have already seen in Muslim Spain. It was critically important  for the Jewish self-image that Jews not be inferior to the host society.  In Spain, the competition was cultural and intellectual; in Ashkenaz,  given the different complexion of both majority and minority culture,  it was a competition in religious devotion. I have suggested elsewhere  that this consideration may account in part for the assertions by Jewish  polemicists that the chastity of monks and nuns is more apparent than  real. Celibacy was an area in which Jewish law did not allow competition,  and so the problem was resolved by the not entirely unfounded allegation  that the religious self-sacrifice of Christians was illusory. With respect  to self-mortification for sin, Jewish law was not quite so clear, and  Ashkenazi pietists set out to demonstrate that they would not be put to  shame by Christian zeal in the service of God.112 In the late Middle Ages, Northern European Jewry was subjected to  expulsions, persecutions, and dislocations which disrupted its cultural  752, p. 191.

I have elaborated somewhat in a forthcoming essay, “Al Tadmitam ve-Goralam  shel ha-Goyim be-Sifrut ha-Pulmus ha-Ashkenazit,” in [Yehudim mul ha-Zelav], ed. by  Yom Tov Assis, et al. — 94 — </page> <page sequence="75"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  life and moved its center of gravity eastward. By the late fourteenth and  early fifteenth centuries, a figure like R. Yom Tov Lipmann Mühlhausen  of Prague demonstrates that some Jewish intellectuals had achieved  familiarity with philosophy and general culture. In 1973, Ephraim Kupfer  published a seminal article which attempted to establish the substantial  presence of rationalism in Ashkenaz during this period. There can be  no question that much of the evidence that he adduced is significant  and stimulating. We can hardly fail to be intrigued, for example, by  an argument in an Ashkenazic text that ancient shifts in the halakhah  of levirate marriage resulted from a rejection of metempsychosis by  increasingly sophisticated rabbis. At the same time, it is far from clear that  this material reflects the views and interests of substantial segments of  Ashkenazic society, and it is very likely that one of the important figures  in the article came to Europe from Israel bearing texts and ideas that stem  from the Jewish communities of the Muslim East. Both the dissemination  and the rootedness of philosophical study in fourteenth- and fifteenth- century Ashkenaz remain an open question, and I am inclined to think  that it stood considerably closer to the periphery than to the center.113 The question of the standing of philosophy among fifteenth-century  Ashkenazim has a significant bearing on the proper evaluation of major  113 See Kupfer, “Li-Demutah,” Tarbiz 42 (1973): 113-147. It is noteworthy that one of the  texts cited by Kupfer (p. 129) takes it for granted that the ancient rabbis learned proper  methods of demonstration from the works of Aristotle, a position which reverses the  standard medieval Jewish assertion about the source of Greek philosophy. See also  Kupfer’s brief supplementary notes in his “Hassagot min Hakham Ehad ‘al Divrei he- Hakham ha-Rav R. Yosef b. ha-Qadosh R. Yosef ha-Lo‘azi she-Katav ve-Qara be-Qol  Gadol neged ha-Rambam,” Qovez ‘al Yad n.s. 11 [21] (1985): 215-216, nn. 2, 4. For  some evidence of interest in philosophy outside the “Mühlhausen circle,” particularly  in Sefer Hadrat Qodesh written in Germany shortly before the middle of the fourteenth  century, see Davis, R. Yom Tov Lipman Heller, pp. 88-103, and see now his “Philosophy,  Dogma, and Exegesis in Medieval Ashkenazic Judaism: The Evidence of Sefer Hadrat  Qodesh,” AJS Review 18 (1993): 195-222. For an early, brief expression of reservations  about Kupfer’s thesis, see Joseph Dan, “Hibbur Yihud Ashkenazi min ha-Me’ah ha-Yod- Dalet,” Tarbiz 44 (1975): 203-206. For a more detailed critique, see Israel Jacob Yuval,  Hakhamim be-Doram (Jerusalem, 1988), 286-311. In an oral communication, Moshe  Idel has noted several considerations pointing to the likelihood that Menahem Shalem  came from Israel: His non-Ashkenazic name usually refers to a Jerusalemite; he makes  reference to Emmaus, which he identifies as Latrun; he had a text by Abraham Abulafia  and a translation of an Arabic text by Abraham Maimonides. If Idel is correct, and if  Kupfer’s suggestion that the two Menahems in his study are really one and the same is  also correct, then the dominant personality in the article was not an Ashkenazic Jew. — 95 — </page> <page sequence="76"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response trends and figures in the intellectual life of the burgeoning new center  in sixteenth-century Poland. R. Moses Isserles and R. Mordecai Jaffe  are the two most prominent examples of distinguished Talmudists who  maintained a position of moderate rationalism in which a conservative  understanding of Maimonides and a philosophical interpretation of  kabbalah served to unite diverse strands of Jewish piety and theology in a  manner that removed any threat to traditional religious affirmations.114 If  Kupfer is correct, then this position can be seen as a natural continuation  of intellectual trends in late medieval Ashkenaz, and the approach of  Isserles and Jaffe would fit well into their generally conservative posture.  If he is not, then we must seek other sources for the penetration of  philosophical ideas into Polish Jewish thought. The first of these is the Northern European Renaissance, which  affected both Poland and Bohemia and can consequently help to account  not only for the elements of rationalism in the works of Polish rabbis but  for the significant scientific and philosophical activity among the Jews  of late sixteenth and early seventeenth-century Prague. In the case of  David Gans of Prague, the relationship with Christian society is crystal- clear: Gans was the first influential Jew to confront Copernicanism, and  he did so as a personal associate of Tycho Brahe and Johann Kepler.  Gans’s illustrious contemporary, R. Judah Loew (Maharal), produced an  impressive theological corpus which made extensive, though cautious  use of the Jewish philosophical tradition, and described astronomy as  “a ladder to ascend to the wisdom of the Torah,” while his student R.  Yom Tov Lipman Heller, best known for his standard commentary to the  Mishnah, displayed considerable interest in the pursuit of mathematics  and astronomy. The period from 1560 to 1620 saw a significant increase  in works of a philosophical and scientific nature throughout the  Ashkenazic orbit, and the contacts between the Jewish communities of  Prague and Poland no doubt contributed to the spread of these pursuits.  A second significant source of cultural stimulation for Polish Jewry  may well have been Renaissance Italy. Polish Jews were in continual  contact with Italy in a multitude of contexts; numerous Padua-trained  114 See Lawrence Kaplan, “Rabbi Mordekhai Jaffe and the Evolution of Jewish Culture in  Poland in the Sixteenth Century,” in Jewish Thought in the Sixteenth Century, ed. by  Bernard D. Cooperman (Cambridge, Mass., and London, England, 1983), pp. 266-282.  On Isserles’ thought, see Yonah Ben Sasson, Mishnato ha-‘lyyunit shel ha-Rama  (Jerusalem, 1984). — 96 — </page> <page sequence="77"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  physicians came to Poland, and a constant stream of literary material  crossed the border.115 The use of this material would have been legitimated in the eyes of  some conservatives by the heroic image of Maimonides, whose orthodoxy  was now beyond reproach. Once again, we find an exception, which  genuinely proves this rule. In midsixteenth-century Posen, the extreme  and eccentric anti-rationalist R. Joseph Ashkenazi persuaded his father- in-law R. Aaron to deliver an uncompromising attack against the study  of philosophy. Ashkenazi, as we know from a later work of his, attacked  Maimonides with startling vitriol as an outright heretic who deserves no  defense and who is largely responsible for popularizing the allegorization  of the Bible and of aggadah that has undermined authentic Judaism.  Nevertheless, he himself cited with disgust the unanimity of the admiring  chorus of Maimonides’ supporters, and R. Avraham Horowitz’s attack  on Ashkenazi demonstrates further the passionate reaction inspired  by unrestrained criticism of the author of the Guide. Horowitz’s work,  which contains a vigorous defense of philosophical study, also reflects  the presence in sixteenth-century Poland of unabashed exponents of  speculation, although the author’s partial revision of his rationalist  views years later points to the countervailing forces that may well have  been dominant even at that time, as they surely were by the dawn of the  Jewish enlightenment.116 115 On Gans in particular and Prague in general, see Mordecai Breuer, “Qavvim li-Demuto  shel R.

R. Solomon Luria, in an  oft-quoted exchange with Isserles, denounced him for citing scientific  information derived from gentile sources in a halakhic decision about the  kashrut of a particular animal and for reading philosophical works at all,  and he blames such attitudes for the bizarre and otherwise unattested  phenomenon of young Polish Jews who recite an Aristotelian prayer in  the synagogue. Isserles’ response is revealing. He justified his actions, but  made it clear that he gained his scientific knowledge only from Jewish  books and that he pursued these studies only at times when most people  are out taking walks on Sabbaths and holidays. Recent research has tended to portray a greater openness to  rationalism and science than we had been accustomed to ascribe to this  Jewry. Nevertheless, it remains difficult to take the pulse of sixteenth- century Polish Jewish intellectuals with respect to our question: probably  a small group of full-fledged rationalists, a substantial number of  conservative advocates of a tamed philosophy, and a significant group of  rabbis who either shied away from speculation or actively opposed it.117 mi-Zefat,” Tarbiz 28 (1959): pp. 59-89, 201-235.

Eliezer Ashekenazi of Posen also deserves mention,  although the fact that he spent many years in the East mitigates his significance for a  characterization of Polish Jewry; see the analysis of Ashkenazi’s exegetical independence  in Haim Hillel Ben Sasson, Hagut ve-Hanhagah (Jerusalem, 1959), pp. 34-38. 117 On Isserles’ astronomical treatise, see Y.

Italy is a more complex and more  interesting story. Despite their Christian environment, the Jews of  medieval Italy appear to have maintained a greater degree of openness to  the surrounding culture than did Ashkenazic Jewry. Shabbetai Donnolo  is a well-known, early example of the sort of learned physician and  scientist that we usually associate with Jews in the Muslim orbit. To  some degree, this phenomenon may have resulted from the significant  Muslim impact on Southern Italy, but I am inclined to attribute even  greater importance to the fact that pre-twelfth-century Southern Europe  maintained a greater continuity with the classical past than did the  Christian communities of the North. A case in point is the familiarity  of the anonymous tenth-century Italian Jew who wrote Josippon with  earlier Latin works. By the thirteenth century, Italian Jews displayed a  level of sophistication in philosophical and literary pursuits that owed  something to contacts with Iberia but at least as much to a receptivity to  the cultural developments in their immediate environment. Thus, easily  the most philosophically sophisticated anti-Christian polemicist of the  thirteenth century was Moses ben Solomon of Salerno, and the often  secular, sometimes ribald poetry of Immanuel of Rome could not have  been composed in any other Jewry in the medieval Christian world.118 Toward the end of the Middle Ages, both Sephardi and Ashkenazi  immigrants introduced a mixture of new influences. Elijah del Medigo’s  late fifteenth-century Behinat ha-Dat is a clear-cut example of the impact  of rationalism, but the fate of Aristotelian philosophy among the Jews  of Renaissance Italy is bound up with central questions about their  118 On Donnolo, see the discussion and references in A.

Lists of books in Italian Jewish libraries in the fifteenth  and early sixteenth centuries appear to reflect a decline of interest in  philosophy from the beginning to the end of that period, with the  important and unsurprising exception of Maimonides’ Guide and some of  its commentators. This impression is reinforced by a complaint leveled by  R. Isaac Abravanel in Venice as early as the late fifteenth century about the  unavailability of Averroes’ Epistle on the Conjunction and Moses Narboni’s  commentary on it. If the requisite work were “tosafot or codes, I would  borrow it from one of the natives, but in philosophy this is impossible.”  The declining philosophical content of Jewish sermons in the first half of  the sixteenth century provides further evidence of the same significant  development.119 The diminution of interest in metaphysics does not bespeak the end  of Italian Jewish acculturation. First of all, the continuing use of the  scholastic philosophical approach by no less a figure than R. Ovadiah  Seforno demonstrates the persistent vitality of that tradition within  important rabbinic circles. More important, Renaissance Christians  were themselves engaged in disputes about the value of philosophy and  tended to emphasize the scientific, ethical, and political dimensions of the  Aristotelian corpus rather than its metaphysical component; in a sense,  then, the very de-emphasis of the philosophical tradition can be seen not  as a turning inward but as a reflection of a larger cultural trend. There is  no denying that the gradual displacement of Aristotelianism by kabbalah  in the minds of many Italian Jews reflected a desire to emphasize the  uniqueness of the Jewish people and its culture in a manner reminiscent  of Halevi, whose Kuzari underwent something of a popular revival;  nonetheless, even R. Yehiel Nissim of Pisa, who produced the most  impressive reasoned argument for this displacement, recognized the value  of philosophical investigations, not to speak of scientific inquiry, provided  that they were not assigned primacy in a rivalry with the Torah.120 119 For del Medigo, see his Sefer Behinat ha-Dat, ed. by Jacob Ross (Tel Aviv, 1984), and D.

Indeed, to an observer coming to the subject  from the study of another Jewish community, including that of Iberia, the  lively and genuinely significant historians’ debate over the inner or outer  directedness of fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Italian Jews takes on a  surreal quality. This is a community with intellectuals entranced by the  rhetorical works of Cicero and Quintilian and with preachers who lace their  sermons with references to classical authors while insisting that the Bible  cannot be properly understood without a literary sensitivity nurtured by  careful study of gentile as well as Jewish literature. It is a community  with thinkers who set up the Renaissance ideal of homo universalis or  hakham kolel as a paradigm of intellectual perfection attained by King  Solomon and sought by anyone with healthy educational priorities. It is  a community that produced a plan, at least on paper, of setting up what  one observer has described as a Yeshiva University, where the primary  emphasis would be on the study of “the written and oral Torah, laws,  tosafot, and decisors,” but instruction would also be provided in the works  of Jewish philosophers, Hebrew grammar, rhetoric, Latin, Italian, logic,  medicine, non-Jewish philosophical works, mathematics, cosmography,  and astrology. It is a community with vigorous, ongoing exchanges  with the contemporary Christian elite. Not only did Elias Levita teach  Hebrew to Christian scholars; not only did kabbalah itself, which was  sometimes taught by Jews, inspire the speculative creativity of Christian  thinkers; it now appears likely that Pico della Mirandola’s version of the  quintessentially Renaissance definition of man as a median creature with  the power to fashion himself in freedom owes much to a medieval Muslim  formulation mediated by Pico’s Jewish associate Yohanan Alemanno.121 121 On rhetoric, see The Book of the Honeycomb’s Flow.

The fact that Joseph Ashkenazi  wrote his vitriolic attack against Maimonides while in Italy is no doubt  fortuitous, but it made enough of an impact there to have elicited  an elaborate refutation. Yosef Yavetz’s Or ha-Hayyim is the work of a  Spanish exile in Naples who rejected philosophical pursuits as damaging  to faith and did battle with the hallowed rationalist understanding of  the biblical admonition to “know” God as a philosophical imperative;  a pious individual needs to be rescued from “the ambush of human  reason, which lurks in wait... at all times.” R. David Proventzalo advised  the young David Messer Leon to follow the ways of distant Talmudists  rather than the philosophical agenda of local rabbis, who appear to assign  no value to the Torah and Talmud. R. Ovadiah of Bertinoro denounced  the study of Aristotle in particular and philosophy in general in both  his commentary to the Mishnah and his correspondence, writing  approvingly of the untainted piety that he found in the land of Israel in  contrast to the deplorable situation in Italy. In the introduction to his  halakhic work Giddulei Terumah, R. Azariah Figo lamented his youthful  pursuit of general culture in the late sixteenth century and described his  decision to “expel this maidservant” and return to the Talmud, although  it is noteworthy that he berated himself only for reversing the proper  order of priorities, not for pursuing a forbidden path.122 Jew could have thought of such a project. The apt analogy to Yeshiva University was  made by Yehezkel Cohen, “Ha-Yahas le-Limmudei Hol me-Hazal ve-‘ad Yameinu— Seqirah Historit-Sifrutit,’” in Yahas ha-Yahadut le-Limmudei Hol (Israel, 1983), p. 20.  Although this would not have been a degree granting institution, the plan envisioned a  preparatory program that would enable the student to enroll subsequently in a formal  studio and receive a secular degree (semikhah) in a very short time. On Elias Levita  and the teaching of Hebrew and kabbalah to Christians, see the discussion in Yitzhak  Penkower, “‘Iyyun Mehuddash be-Sefer Masoret ha-Masoret le-Eliyyahu Bahur: Ihur  ha-Niqqud u-Biqqoret Sefer ha- Zohar,” Italia 8 (l989): 36-50, and the references in n.  93 (pp. 37-38).  For Alemanno’s likely influence on Pico’s crucial conception of man, see Moshe Idel, “The  Anthropology of Yohanan Alemanno: Sources and Influences,” Topoi 7 (1988): pp. 201- 210. David Ruderman has recently argued that Pico’s replacement of a narrow vision of  Christian culture with one that was more broadly human created a new challenge and  a new opportunity for Renaissance Jews confronting their intellectual environment;  see his very useful summary article, “The Italian Renaissance and Jewish Thought,” in  Renaissance Humanism: Foundations, Forms, and Legacy, Volume I: Humanism in Italy, ed.  by Albert Rabil Jr. (Philadelphia, 1988), pp. 382-433. 122 On the response to Ashkenazi, see Kupfer, “Hassagot min Hakham Ehad” (above,  — 102 — </page> <page sequence="83"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  Despite the advice that he received, David Messer Leon ultimately  opted for humanist pursuits to the point of arguing that the Talmudist  who is also a hakham kolel is more deserving of rabbinic ordination than  an ordinary Talmudist. When he left Italy for Constantinople, he found  himself under attack for his frequent citation of classical literature in his  sermons; in response, he produced a passionate defense of the humanist  enterprise, arguing for the value of classical poetry and rhetoric in  achieving human perfection, which is bound up with the quest for  religious perfection. Two Jewish biographies, one of King Solomon, the  other of Isaac Abravanel, written in Italy between the late fifteenth and  mid-sixteenth centuries, clearly reflect Renaissance literary trends and  further illustrate Jewish involvement in humanistic study and creativity.  The seventeenth-century autobiography of Leone da Modena, which can  be seen as an extension of this genre, is but one of many indications  not only of its author’s extraordinary range of interests but of the  continuing, even growing Jewish familiarity with the broader culture  well into the Baroque period. The glorification of Hebrew reached its peak  at the height of the Renaissance, while in the post-Renaissance period  even Jewish authors with an excellent command of Hebrew were ever  more likely to write in the vernacular.123 n. 113).

On Proventzalo’s advice, see Bonfil, Ha-Rabbanut, pp. 173-174; Rabbis, p. 270. For  Figo, see Sefer Giddulei Terumah (Venice, 1643), and Barzilay, pp. 192-209. A similar  statement of regret at excessive attention to works of general culture appears in the  early seventeenth-century Shiltei ha-Gibborim of Abraham Portaleone, but the book  itself, despite its presumed character as an act of penitence for these intellectual  indiscretions, is replete with references to the classics; see Segal, p. 52, and the  references in n. 23. In a personal communication, David Ruderman has underscored  his view of Portaleone and Figo as anti-Aristotelians who nevertheless maintained a  positive attitude toward empirical science. 123 Messer Leon’s observation on the qualifications for ordination is reminiscent of the  assertion that angered R. Asher b. Yehiel about the connection between knowledge of  Arabic and the right to render a decision in Jewish law. The apologia for humanism  is in Messer Leon’s unpublished Shevah Nashim; for a summary and analysis, see  — 103 — </page> <page sequence="84"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response In her study of David Messer Leon’s work, Havah Tirosh-Rothschild  observes that  by the end of the fifteenth century, Jewish rationalist tradition had so  absorbed Greek philosophy that it had become far less subversive and was  even palatable. By David ben Judah’s day, however, no such absorption  had yet occurred of the poetry, oratory, geography, history and letters of  classical antiquity—all introduced to Jews through Renaissance humanism.  These subjects, if not philosophy, still seemed to threaten Jewish traditional  values, at least in Constantinople if not in Italy.124 The point is an important one; nevertheless, most of these pursuits  did not have the potential to challenge Judaism in the manner of  Aristotelian philosophy. The one which did was history, and the Italian  Jew who utilized the discipline dangerously generated a brief but  revealing cause célèbre. In its most common mode, history was a humanistic endeavor  no more dangerous than poetry or rhetoric, and some sixteenth- and  Tirosh-Rothschild, “In Defense of Jewish Humanism.” On the biographies, see Arthur  M.

For some observations on Italian  Jewish familiarity with Christian philosophy and, more generally, on the relatively  painless absorption by this Jewry of a multitude of diverse disciplines and approaches,  see Yosef Sermoneta’s review of Barzilay’s Between Reason and Faith in Kiryat Sefer 44  (1970): 539-546.  Despite changes in orientation and advances in methodology, the material accumulated  in Cecil Roth, The Jews in the Renaissance (Philadelphia, 1959), and Moses Shulvass, The  Jews in the Life of the Renaissance (Leiden, 1973), retains its value and documents Jewish  activity in fields like art, drama, music, and printing, which I have been unable to treat in  this survey. The most vigorous and influential argument for a new perspective is Bonfil’s  “The Historian’s Perception of the Jews in the Italian Renaissance. Towards a Reappraisal,”  Revue des Études Juives 143 (1984): 59-82, which sees Italian Jewish acculturation as part  of a competitive struggle affirming Jewish identity in the face of pressure rather than a  reflection of an idyllic cultural symbiosis. See now Bonfil’s synthetic treatment, Jewish  Life in Renaissance Italy (Berkeley, Los Angeles, and London, 1994). 124 “In Defence of Jewish Humanism,” p. 39. — 104 — </page> <page sequence="85"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  seventeenth-century Jews in Italy and elsewhere utilized it to provide  religious consolation, to place the Jewish experience in a broader  context, to validate the tradition, to set the stage for the end of days, to  ponder the causes of the Jewish condition, or simply to entertain. Some  of these purposes had been pursued even in the Middle Ages by the few  Jews who had engaged in the enterprise of setting down events that  had, after all, already taken place and whose utility was consequently  viewed with considerable skepticism. R. Sherira’s epistle took the form  of a standard responsum; Josippon provided a basic historical survey as  well as implicit advice about appropriate Jewish behavior in the face  of superior force; R. Abraham ibn Daud’s Book of Tradition validated  the tradition, defended the glories of Andalusian Jewry, and may  have pointed esoterically to the date of the redemption; the crusade  chronicles provided emotional release and religious inspiration in the  wake of unspeakable tragedy.125 Whether or not the historical writings of sixteenth- and seventeenth- century Jews reflect a significant historiographical movement has  recently become a disputed question. On the one hand, Jewish authors  produced ten books of a roughly historical character in the course of  about a century, a number that exceeds the entire output of the Middle  Ages, and some of these are clearly indebted to the historiographic  corpus that emerged in Renaissance society. On the other hand, a  rigorous definition of history would exclude many, perhaps most, of  these works, and even if they are all counted, they do not approach the  number that one might reasonably expect in light of the proportion  of Christian Renaissance works devoted to historiography.126 In any  125 See Sefer Yosifon, ed. by Flusser; ibn Daud’s Sefer Ha-Qabbalah, ed. by Cohen; Shlomo  Eidelberg, The Jews and the Crusaders (Madison, Wisconsin, 1977), and Robert Chazan,  European Jewry and the First Crusade (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1987), pp. 223-297.  On R. Sherira, see above, n. 19. For an example of medieval Jewish denigration of the  value of history, see Maimonides’ Commentary to the Mishnah, Sanhedrin 10:1 (almost  immediately before the list of the thirteen principles of faith). 126 See Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi’s Zakhor: Jewish History and Jewish Memory (Seattle  and London, 1982), pp. 55-75, and his “Clio and the Jews: Reflections on Jewish  Historiography in the Sixteenth Century,” American Academy for Jewish Research Jubilee  Volume (PAAJR 46-47 [1979-80]): 607-638; Robert Bonfil, “How Golden Was the Age of  the Renaissance in Jewish Historiography?” History and Theory 27 (1988): 78-102. Bonfil  accounts for what he regards as the relative paucity of Jewish historical works on the  grounds that diaspora Jews did not have the sort of political and military history that  lent itself to the narrative style most characteristic of Renaissance historiography. — 105 — </page> <page sequence="86"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response event, despite the great interest of several of these books and despite  their frequent debt to Christian models, they do not challenge Jewish  tradition. Except one. Azariah de’ Rossi’s Me’or ‘Einayim, which is not a  narrative history but a series of historical studies, utilized non-Jewish  sources to test the validity of historical assertions in Rabbinic texts to  the point of rejecting the accepted chronology of the Second Temple  and modifying the Jewish calendar’s assumptions about the date of  creation. The author was clearly sensitive to the prospect of opposition,  and he defended the study of history on the grounds of religious utility  and the intrinsic value of the search for truth. There is, however,  considerable irony in his argument for rejecting historical statements  of the Rabbis in favor of gentile authorities. The Sages, he writes, were  concerned with important matters; with respect to trivial concerns like  history, we should expect to find a greater degree of reliability in the  works of gentiles, who after all specialize in trivialities.127 The difficulty  of distinguishing the strands of sincerity and disingenuousness in this  assertion speaks volumes for the problematic nature of de’ Rossi’s  undertaking. He can justify his methodology only by minimizing the  significance of his discipline. Contemporary histories differ about the novelty of de’ Rossi’s  challenge. Since the reinterpretation and even rejection of aggadah  had respectable medieval precedent, Salo Baron and Robert Bonfil  have argued that Azariah did little more than broaden the grounds for  such a step to embrace historical as well as philosophical or kabbalistic  considerations. Yosef Yerushalmi, on the other hand, sees a more radical  and significant innovation in Me’or ‘Einayim; philosophy and kabbalah,  he argues, had long been regarded as sources of truth, while Azariah  was willing to utilize “profane history... drawn from Greek, Roman  and Christian writers” to judge the validity of rabbinic statements.128  The distinction is important and the formulation can, I think, be  sharpened. Philosophical truth was not based on the authority of  Aristotle; it rested on arguments that Aristotle may have formulated  127 Sefer Me’or ‘Einayim, ed. by David Cassel (Vilna, 1866), p. 216. 128 See Baron, History and Jewish Historians (Philadelphia, 1964), pp. 167-239, 405-442;  Bonfil, “Some Reflections on the Place of Azariah de’ Rossi’s Me’or ‘Einayim in the Cultural  Milieu of Italian Renaissance Jewry,” in Jewish Thought in the Sixteenth Century, pp. 23-48,  esp. 23-25; Yerushalmi, “Clio and the Jews,” pp. 634-635, and Zakhor, p. 72. — 106 — </page> <page sequence="87"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  but were now available to any thinker in an unmediated fashion. It was  reason, not Aristotle, that required the reinterpretation of whatever  Rabbinic text was at issue. History is different. Although reason is very  much involved and the decision to follow a gentile account instead of a  rabbinic one does not result from a simple preference for Tacitus over  Rabbi Yosi, the fact remains that on some level one is accepting the  testimony of gentiles rather than that of the Talmudic sages. This may  be a legitimate extension of the medieval precedent, but it is hardly a  straightforward one. This point tells us something significant about Italian Jewry and  not merely about de’ Rossi. Bonfil has demonstrated convincingly that  the Italian attack on Me’or ‘Einayim was much more limited in both its  ideological scope and its degree of support than historians used to think.  Since Bonfil himself does not see the work as radically innovative, he  regards the relatively mild opposition as roughly the sort of reaction that  we might have expected. Yerushalmi, writing before Bonfil’s study, made  the cautious observation that “it is perhaps a token of the flexibility of  Italian Jewry that the ban upon the book, [which] only required that  special permission be obtained by those who wanted to read it, was not  always enforced stringently.” If we accept, as I think we should, both  Yerushalmi’s perception of the book and Bonfil’s findings about the ban,  the implications for Italian Jewry become more striking. A substantial  majority of the rabbinic leadership accepted with equanimity a work  which treated the historical statements of the ancient Sages with  startling freedom. The contrast with the intense opposition to Me’or  ‘Einayim from R. Joseph Caro in Safed and R. Judah Loew (Maharal)  in Prague highlights the openness of sixteenth-century Italian Jews to  non-Jewish sources and the willingness to utilize them even in the most  sensitive of contexts.129 129 See Yerushalmi, “Clio,” p. 635; Zakhor, pp. 72-73. On R. Joseph Caro, see the references  in Segal, Historical Consciousness, p. 68, n. 51; on the Maharal, see Segal, pp. 133-161.  Another, perhaps fairer way to make the point would be to say that Italian Jewry  agreed with Bonfil while the Maharal and R. Joseph Caro agreed with Yerushalmi, but  this alone would fail to convey the significance of the Italian position. For a nuanced  discussion of major features of de’ Rossi’s work, see now Bonfil’s elaborate introduction  to his anthology, Kitvei ‘Azariah min ha-Adummim: Mivhar Peraqim mi-tokh Sefer Me’or  ‘Einayim ve-Sefer Mazref la-Kesef (Jerusalem, 1991). — 107 — </page> <page sequence="88"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response THE SCIENTIFIC REVOLUTION AND THE TRANSITION TO MODERN TIMES Apart from the humanistic pursuits that characterized the Renaissance,  early modern Europe also witnessed an increasing interest in the natural  world. Though the most significant manifestation of this interest was  the Copernican revolution and its aftermath, scientifically oriented Jews  in the sixteenth, seventeenth, and early eighteenth centuries evinced  greater interest in new approaches to chemistry, medicine, zoology,  botany, mineralogy, and geography. Hundreds of Jews graduated from the  medical school in Padua. Various Jewish works demonstrate familiarity  with Paracelsian chemical medicine and Cartesian mechanics, and they  display an insatiable curiosity about wondrous beasts and other natural  marvels widely reported in an age of exploration. We find a revival and  elaboration of the medieval arguments for the Jewish origin of the  sciences and their religious utility along with a recognition that the  ancient philosophers had attained important religious truths unaided  by Jewish instruction.130 Jewish enthusiasm for these new scientific pursuits was greatly  facilitated by a critically important conceptual change. In the Middle  130 See David B. Ruderman, Science, Medicine, and Jewish Culture in Early Modem Europe.  Spiegel Lectures in European Jewish History 7 (Tel Aviv, 1987), and his overlapping article,  “The Impact of Science on Jewish Culture and Society in Venice,” in Gli Ebrei e Venezia  (Milan, 1987), pp. 417-448. See also his Kabbalah, Magic, and Science: The Cultural  Universe of a Sixteenth-Century Jewish Physician (Cambridge, Mass., and London, 1988).  In light of Abba Mari of Lunel’s salute to Aristotle for achieving genuine monotheism  in the absence of revelation, Ruderman’s description of Abraham Yagel’s “remarkable”  assertion that pagan philosophers “discovered their faith independently of Jewish  revelation” (p. 146) needs to be toned down a bit; see above, n. 76. For Jews at the  medical school in Padua, see above, n. 115.  On the Jewish origins of the sciences, see, in addition to the references in n. 37 of  Ruderman’s lecture, the introduction to David Kaufmann’s Die Sinne, and D.

During the Renaissance and beyond,  philosophy and certain kinds of science grew apart, and the scientific  domain itself came to be divided between empiricist and rationalist- mathematical spheres. In this environment, certain scientific fields were  uncontaminated by the philosophical baggage associated in some Jewish  minds with Aristotelianism, and a Jew could remain a staunch opponent  of rationalism in its medieval mode while retaining an intense interest  in the new science.131 The Jewish absorption of the monumental revolution in astronomy  was far more problematic. David Gans of late sixteenth-century Prague,  though best known for his historical work Zemah David, was the first  influential Jew to confront Copernicanism, and his attitude to the new  astronomy is characteristic of what was probably the dominant reaction  by knowledgeable Jews through the early eighteenth century: interested  awareness but ultimate rejection.132 Although Yosef Shlomo Delmedigo,  who studied with Galileo and ended his days in Prague, spoke very highly  of Copernicus, two major compendia at the very end of our period still  reject the heliocentric theory in sharp terms. Toviah Katz described  Copernicus’s position with some care and even presented a series of  Copernican arguments; at the same time, he called him “the firstborn of  Satan” and described the adherents of his view as heretics.133 Similarly,  131 David Ruderman is largely responsible for sharpening my awareness of this point. On  the division within the sciences, see Thomas S. Kuhn, “Mathematical vs. Experimental  Traditions in the Development of Physical Science,” Journal of Interdisciplinary History 1  (1976): 1-31. As I indicated above, it is important to note that for medieval Ashkenazic  Jews, the link between empirical science and rationalist philosophy had never been made,  and so their interest in the physical world was never encumbered by this complication. 132 See Neher, Jewish Thought and the Scientific Revolution. 133 Ma‘aseh Toviah (Krakau, 1908), pp. 43b-44b (“‘Olam ha-Galgalim,” ch. 4). Ruderman  (Science, Medicine, and Jewish Culture, p. 21) notes correctly that the chapter ends  “limply,” without any refutation of the Copernican arguments noted. Nonetheless, the  conclusion is slightly more forceful than he indicates. Toviah does not assert that the  unspecified counterarguments “are easily confusing [even] to one who understands  them”; he says that their validity is easily evident to such a person (benaqel nekhohot,  not nevukhot). Moreover, the previous chapter sets forth six standard arguments  against the Copernican theory.  On Delmedigo, see Isaac Barzilay, Yosef Shlomo Delmedigo, Yashar of Candia: His Life, Works,  and Times (Leiden, 1974), and Yosef Levi, “Aqademiah Yehudit le-Madda‘im be-Reshit ha- Me’ah ha-Sheva-‘Esreh: Nisyono shel Yosef Shlomoh Delmedigo,” Proceedings of the Eleventh  World Congress of Jewish Studies, Division B, vol. 1, Hebrew section, pp. 169-176. — 109 — </page> <page sequence="90"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response David Nieto dismissed the Copernican conception as an abomination.134  By this time, the scientific defense of the Ptolemaic system had become  very difficult, but Copernicus had still not carried the day among all  intellectuals, let alone among the masses. Since most seventeenth- and  early eighteenth-century European Jews, especially outside Italy, were  relatively isolated from the burgeoning scientific community, and since  they had rabbinic as well as biblical texts to inhibit their receptivity to  the new astronomy, it is not surprising that they generally cast their lot  with the rear guard action aimed against the Copernican revolution. During the centuries in which modern Europe was being formed,  the major Jewish cultural centers turned inward despite the growing  Jewish involvement in national and international commerce. In a recent  revisionist work, Jonathan Israel has argued that the period from 1550  to 1713, and particularly from 1650 to 1713, saw “the most profound and  pervasive impact on the west which [the Jews] were ever to exert while  retaining a large measure of social and cultural cohesion.” To the extent  that he applies this observation to economics and politics, including the  ascendancy of Court Jews in Central Europe and elsewhere and the rough  synchronism of Ashkenazi and Sephardi influence on finance and trade,  he provides an important new perspective on early modern Jewry. On  the other hand, he underestimates and misconceives much of medieval  Jewish culture and considerably overrates the achievements of early  modern Jews when he writes that “the radical transformation of Jewish  culture which occurred during the middle decades of the sixteenth  century was, assuredly, one of the most fundamental and remarkable  phenomena distinguishing post-Temple Jewish history” and then extends  his enthusiastic evaluation into the following century as well.135 As we have seen, Italian Jewish culture was indeed marked by an  impressive synthesis of Jewish pride and openness to the surrounding  134 This translation may be a trifle too strong for piggul, but Neher’s effort to soften Nieto’s  anti-Copernicanism by taking “piggul hu lo yerazeh” in the narrow legalistic sense  determined by the phrase’s biblical context (“a sacrifice which would not be acceptable in  the Temple”) is an apologetic distortion of a very strong expression; see Jewish Thought  and the Scientific Revolution, p. 256. On Delmedigo, Katz, Nieto, and others, see Hillel  Levine, “Paradise Not Surrendered: Jewish Reactions to Copernicus and the Growth of  Modern Science,” in Epistemology, Methodology, and the Social Sciences, ed. by Robert S.

In the new Jewish community of seventeenth-century Holland,  Sephardic Jews, including some with a Marrano past that made them  fully conversant with Christian civilization, contributed philosophical,  polemical, and scientific works that utilized wide learning and, when  written or available in the vernacular, sometimes influenced European  intellectuals. It was not only in Italy that Christian Hebraists held  discussions with Jews about scholarly and religious issues. Court Jews  were necessarily conversant with the surrounding culture while remaining,  at least in many cases, loyal members of the Jewish community.136 At the same time, the major seventeenth-century Jewish centers  outside Italy were either in a state of cultural decline or evinced relatively  little concern with intellectual trends in the surrounding society. Jewry  under Islam confronted a Muslim world that was itself culturally  stagnant and consequently failed to provide the stimulus that Jewish  thinkers needed for creative engagement with disciplines outside of  Torah. Theoretically, this Jewry continued to value the sort of intellectual  described in an early seventeenth-century chronicle from Fez as a complete scholar thoroughly familiar with all the sciences: the science  of speculation (‘iyyun) to an infinite degree, the science of grammar, the  science of philosophy, the science of metrical poetry. There was no one  like him among all the scholars of Israel.... If anyone had an uncertainty  regarding a passage in Tosafot or the work of R. Elijah Mizrahi or the  Talmud, he would come to this scholar and would not leave until those  uncertainties would be fully resolved.137 Nevertheless, such scholarship, at least with respect to philosophy,  meant mastery of an existing corpus rather than the production of  original, creative work. Ashkenazic Jewry had always felt more of an adversarial relationship  with the surrounding society, and even the examples of cultural interaction  136 Israel, European Jewry, pp. 70-86, 142-144, 216-231.

With the removal of the Ashkenazic center to  the alien environment of Poland, the sense of existential separateness  was reinforced, and Jacob Katz has noted that even the martyrdoms  in seventeenth-century Poland differ from those of the Crusades as  defiant confrontation gave way to a sense of isolation from a hostile  environment.138 Although sixteenth-century Poland was not unaffected  by the intellectual currents inspired by humanism and the Reformation,  the rationalism that found lukewarm expression in R. Moses Isserles  and some of his contemporaries essentially came from a culture outside  the immediate environment. As Poland became a cultural backwater in  seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Europe, this mild philosophical  interest found no reinforcement either in the surrounding society or  the indigenous Ashkenazic tradition, and without such reinforcement  it largely faded away. Even in seventeenth-century Germany, which was closer to the center  of European creativity, there was insufficient impetus for Ashkenazic  Jews to overcome the cultural legacy of their formative period without  substantial struggle and considerable delay. In many cases, the  communities were being reconstituted in the wake of expulsions and  persecutions. The gradual opening of Christian society to some Jews  began to undermine the observance of Jewish individuals rather than  inspire an intellectual transformation and Renaissance. Profound differences separated the medieval Iberian experience  of a culturally stimulating environment from the situation of early  modern Ashkenazim. First, the Jews of Northern Europe came to  modernity with a deeply entrenched, fully formed approach that was  highly suspicious of external wisdom. Second, the challenges of modern  science and philosophical skepticism could not be faced in the kind of  partnership with the dominant society that medieval Jews had enjoyed.  It is true that Christianity had to face these challenges quite as much as  Judaism, but the challenges emanated from Christian society itself, not  from a philosophy inherited from classical antiquity. Thus, the search  for intellectual allies was severely complicated. Traditional Christians  were for the most part heirs to a fully developed, millennial legacy of  138 Katz, Exclusiveness and Tolerance (Oxford, 1961), pp. 131-155, and “Bein Tatnu LeTah- Tat,” Sefer Yovel le-Yitzhak Baer, ed. by S. Ettinger et al. (Jerusalem, 1961), pp. 318-337. — 112 — </page> <page sequence="93"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  contempt for Judaism; seventeenth-century skeptics and eighteenth- century philosophes regarded Judaism with at least as much disdain as  they felt for Christianity and were in any event the authors of the very  challenge that had to be faced. When medieval philosophers were called  heretics, they usually denied the charge; the moderns often embraced it,  indeed, shouted it from the rooftops. The pursuit of speculative thought  became associated with irreligion to a far more profound and extensive  degree than it had in the Middle Ages. Moreover, the nature of modern philosophy was so different from  that of the medieval past that the religious attractiveness of the discipline  was severely undermined. To the medievals, if philosophy posed serious  challenges to religious faith, it also provided indispensable insights into  the nature of God. Modern philosophy seemed to supply little more than  the problems. At best, religious philosophers could refute attacks against  the faith, but they would probably not emerge with new insights about the  issues that they were accustomed to regard as the classic subject matter of  philosophy. They would find little but heresy on divine providence, hardly  anything on attributes or incorporeality, and nothing at all about the  recently deceased active intellect and celestial spheres. If all philosophy  could achieve was the neutralizing of its own evil influence, then ignoring  the enterprise could achieve the same result at a great saving of time and  effort, not to speak of averting danger to one’s faith. The imperative of  answering the heretic was rarely sufficient in itself to inspire philosophical  study. In addition to these critical considerations, the religious value  of philosophical inquiry was radically diminished by the conviction of  many traditional Jews at the dawn of the Enlightenment that the crucial  information about God was available through kabbalah. For the sake of sharpening the analysis, I have intentionally formulated  these points with one-dimensional vigor. If modern philosophy did not  provide solutions to medieval questions about God and creation, it  might nevertheless suggest new areas of fruitful inquiry. The medieval  argument that studying the world inspires love of God seemed all the more  persuasive to believers beholding the mathematically elegant universe  of the new science. We cannot, however, expect the rabbinic leadership  of Ashkenazic Jewry to have known the evolving new approaches well  enough to have formulated an innovative positive response; indeed, in  the early stages they did not know them well enough even to have fully  appreciated the new dangers. — 113 — </page> <page sequence="94"> The Cultural Environment: Challenge and Response Thus, when we do find an interest in philosophical inquiry among the  rabbis of early modern Ashkenaz, it tends to take a very traditional form.  R. Yair Hayyim Bacharach, for example, laid great emphasis on the practical  primacy of talmudic study and the theoretical primacy of kabbalah, while  demonstrating considerable familiarity with Jewish philosophical literature.  In a study of Bacharach, Isadore Twersky observes that “philosophic  literature was studied for religious reasons, as part of a spiritual quest,  totally separate from external contacts and influences.” R. Jacob Emden  reports in his autobiography that his father Hakham Zevi Ashkenazi read  secular works “in his spare time” and studied “other knowledge” with the  scholars who attended the Klaus that he headed in late seventeenth-century  Hamburg “until they achieved perfection in Torah and wisdom”; here too  we are undoubtedly dealing with something other than a fresh and creative  confrontation with the world of modern wisdom.139 By the mid-eighteenth century, Emden’s own ambivalent attitude to  the study of the “external” disciplines reflects the growing impact of the  European opening to the Jews. His essential position is quite negative; at  the same time, he speaks of a yearning for the sciences which he fulfilled  in part by reading Hebrew books in fields like history and geography  and in part by studying the works of non-Jews in the bathroom. His  familiarity with the New Testament is striking, and it comes together  with a relatively favorable attitude to Jesus and even to Paul. What is  most interesting is a recurring justification for secular study that does  not appear in premodern times. Jews, says Emden, must achieve some  familiarity with gentile language and culture for the sake of mingling  comfortably with people. This is a striking reflection of a changed social  atmosphere with far-reaching importance for the integration of Jews  into European society.140 Outside of rabbinic circles, incipient social integration in a world  of growing religious skepticism gradually eroded the loyalties of some  Ashkenazic Jews. Beginning around the end of the seventeenth century,  139 On Bacharach, see I. Twersky, “Law and Spirituality in the Seventeenth Century: A Case  Study in R. Yair Hayyim Bacharach,” in Jewish Thought in the Seventeenth Century, pp.  447-467 (quotation from p. 455). On Hakham Zevi, see Emden’s Megillat Sefer, ed. by  D. Kahana (Warsaw, 1897), pp. 11, 16-17, cited in Jacob J. Schacter, Rabbi Jacob Emden:  Life and Major Works (Harvard University dissertation, 1988), pp. 587-588. 140 See chapter 6 of Schacter’s dissertation for a discussion of Emden’s general stance,  and see especially p. 505, where he notes the novelty of the argument from social  interaction. — 114 — </page> <page sequence="95"> Judaism and General Culture in Medieval and Early Modern Times  substantial numbers of Jews began to drift away from accepted religious  norms, and a smaller number may even have rejected traditional beliefs  under the influence of Enlightenment thought. The official community,  however, did not begin to change until the second half of the eighteenth  century, when leaders of the Jewish Enlightenment began to demand  curricular reform and social accommodation.141 Despite the fact that these demands were often made in the name of  the well-attested rationalist tradition that we have examined throughout  this study, the timing, the context, and the orientation of the new  movement made it a threat to the established order both politically and  religiously. European Jewry, like European Christendom, faced a world  in which religion itself could no longer be taken for granted. In the new,  largely secular order that established itself in the eighteenth century and  continues to our own day, the legitimacy of general culture remained  an issue only for the traditionalist segment of the Jewish people, and  the terms of the debate were narrowed and transformed. For some, the  overwhelming new dangers required an ever more stringent isolation  from the evils of modernity. For others, these dangers could be tamed by  selective admission of the religiously neutral elements of the new society  and culture. For a few, the Torah itself required a heroic confrontation  with modernity in all its fullness, a confrontation that would enrich both  Judaism and the world.

It is a particular pleasure to thank Professor Daniel J.  Lasker, who occupied the office next to mine and served as an unfailing  source of sound advice and refreshing good humor. I no doubt invaded  the offices of two additional fellows of the institute far too frequently,  but Professors Anita Shapira and William C. Jordan provided such  intellectual stimulation that any expression of regret that I might offer  for those interruptions would be insincere. Please forgive me, but I  confess that I would do it again. Outside the institute, Professors Menahem Ben Sasson and David  Ruderman read the entire manuscript and provided illuminating,  significant suggestions, many of which I had the good sense to incorporate.  I am very grateful to Dr. Jacob J. Schacter for his meticulous editorial  supervision, which was often substantive as well as technical. After my  return from Annenberg, I benefited from the welcoming atmosphere,  extraordinary resources, and knowledgeable staff at the Mendel  Gottesman Library of Yeshiva University in preparing the final version of  the study. While I have added references to more recent scholarship and  included many observations reflecting subsequent research, the 1990  text remains at the core of this work. Finally, my wife Pearl as well as Miriam, Elie, Yitzhak, and Gedalyah  not only endured my weekly absences during preparations for the  marriage which brought Elie into the family, but, together with Ditza and  Miriam, who have joined us more recently, provided love, encouragement,  and the inspiration that comes from their own embodiment of Torah and  the best of general culture.  — 116 — </page> </plain_text>
