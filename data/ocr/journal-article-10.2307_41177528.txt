<plain_text><page sequence="1">Disciplines and Sciences Alburey Castell The distinction between disciplines and sciences rests on a prior distinction between two kinds of behavior, namely activity and process. Let me spell out that distinction first. These two kinds of behavior - activity and process - can be illustrated by the behavior of an astronomer, and the behavior of the solar system about which he is astronomizing. His behavior is activity. Its behavior is process. What can you say about his behavior (an activity) which you would hesitate to say about its behavior (a process)? I would suggest such things as the following. (1) You can say that an activity is fallible. In astronomizing errors can occur. This being so, it is fallible. (2) An activity is purposive. There is an intended outcome, a specifiable objective; in this case, getting to know. That is what the astronomer is trying to do. (3) An activity is critical; that is, guided by reference to criteria. For example, the activity called "getting to know" is regulated by reference to certain criteria. If it weren't, the outcome would be continued ignorance on error. (4) An activity is experimental. The astronomer knows what he wants but he may not know exactly how to get it. So he experiments - a mode of behavior which is appropriate to fallibility and partial ignorance. (5) An activity is corrigible; error can be detected and revision instituted. Corrigible is thus a stronger word than changeable or alterable. (6) An activity is reasoned, or reasoned out. If you break in at any point and ask "Why this step?" you get a reason. A reason is not the same as a cause. To give a reason is to justify. (7) An activity has presuppositions. These are noticeably present in the activity called "getting to know." To be unaware of them is to be naive. To become aware of them is to grasp more clearly the character of the activity. (8) An activity is response to a challenge. This is more than response to a stimulus. Response to a stimulus is automatic, whereas response to a challenge is deliberate and critical. These, then, are some of the marks of activity: it is fallible, purposive, critical, experimental, corrigible, reasoned out, has presuppositions and is response to a challenge. You could mention as many more, and still not have a complete list. But these eight are representative; and, what is equally important, they are none Dr. Alburey Castell is Compton Professor of Philosophy and Department Chairman at the College of Wooster. He was Professor of Philosophy and Chairman of the Department of Philosophy at the University of Oregon from 1949 to 1964; and, he was previously at the University of Minnesota. He received his B. A. and M. A. degrees from the University of Toronto and his Ph. D. from the University of Chicago. He has published many articles and his books include titles in logic, ethics, philosophy, and philosophy of education which are widely known. [298]</page><page sequence="2">Disciplines and Sciences of them marks of any process. Thus, e.g., you cannot say of the behavior of the solar system, nor of any other admitted process, that it is fallible, purposive, critical, experimental, corrigible, reasoned out, has presuppositions or is response to a challenge. If you talked in that way about the behavior of the solar system you would speak in metaphor; or your thinking would be anthropomorphic; and that, any astronomer would tell you, is a sin against scientific method. Granted this distinction between two kinds of behavior, activity and process, you can propose the distinction between two kinds of discourse, calling the one discipline and the other science. A discipline will be systematic and orderly know- ledge about an activity or a set of activities; whereas a science will be systematic and orderly knowledge about a process or a set of processes. Thus history or economics would be a discipline; whereas physics or chemistry would be a science. The word discipline is derived from the Latin "discere" meaning "to learn." It stands in contrast to "docere" meaning "to teach." Since to learn is to get to know, you can say that a discipline is a mode of getting to know. If you ask "Getting to know what?" the answer I am proposing is "Getting to know the rationale of a process or a set of processes." Physics, chemistry, physiology, astronomy, geology, meteorology, are sciences. Each proposes systematic and orderly thinking about some process. When the thinking is successful, the outcome is knowledge. The behaviors which these sciences study are processes, not activities. If you construed them as activities, the practitioners of these sciences would warn you not to "personify" their subject- matters, and they would make this warning stick. History, economics, politics, rhetoric, jurisprudence, pedagogics, philosophy, are examples of disciplines. Each proposes systematic and orderly knowledge about some activity or set of activities. When the thinking is successful, the outcome is knowledge. The behaviors which these disciplines study are activities, not processes. If you construed them as processes, the practhioners of these disciplines would warn you not to "thingify" their subject-matters, and they would be entitled to make their warning stick. Let me sharpen this contrast between a discipline and a science by an example. In constructing a narrative of political revolution an historian is talking about a set of activities. In this respect an historian differs from an astronomer. When the latter constructs a theory of planetary revolution he is not talking about a set of activities but about a set of processes. II Given the distinctions between activity and process, and the consequent distinc- tion between disciplines and sciences, you can inquire into their logical efficacy. This is important. The "logical efficacy" of a distinction refers to the questions, comments, objections, and illustrations which the distinction puts you in a position to propose. Without the distinction, the questions, comments, etc., would not arise. [2991</page><page sequence="3">The Christian Scholar So we might ask, "What is the 'logical efficacy' of this distinction between disciplines and sciences?" Specifically, what questions does it put you in a position to ask? As you bring out the logical efficacy of the distinction between disciplines and sciences you find yourself close to essential concerns of a liberal arts college. You will find that the questions which it gives rise to are neither elementary nor technical; and that they have considerable power to dispel college-level infantilism, and to ward off college-level professionalism. For example, take the question, "What is to be said about mathematics? Is it a discipline or a science?" You can speak of the behavior of Robespierre, and call it activity; and the behavior of the planet Mars, and call it process; but in what sense can you speak of the behavior of the number three or of the perpen- dicular from the apex of a right-angled triangle? Three "goes into" six. The perpendicular "bisects" the base. This sounds like the language of behavior. If so, then it is a kind of behavior which differs as much from activity as it does from process. Arithmetical numbers and geometrical figures do not, literally, "behave" at all. To say that they do is to speak in metaphor. Hence mathematics is neither a discipline nor a science. This is not to derogate from its admitted importance. It merely suggests that we need a more adequate vocabulary for talking about the different kinds of discourse which the human mind has worked out for itself. Again, take the question, what is to be said about psychology? Is it a discipline or a science? At one time I was inclined to argue that a psychology that knew what it was about would claim to be a discipline. But perhaps I was mistaken. Perhaps the psychologists who insist that psychology is a natural science are after all correct. Perhaps they know their own business better than a mere agitated bystander. There are processes in the world. No doubt some of them are psycho- logical, and not physical or chemical or physiological. This being so, why should they not be made the subject matter of systematic and orderly investigation? A psychological process is not a rational activity; but that is no reason for saying that there are no psychological processes, or that they cannot be investigated as scientifically as any other sort of process. The conclusion would be that psychology, like physics and the rest, is a science. To be clear about it, one could add that it, like those others, is a natural science. Again, what are we to say about discourse referring to imaginary characters, e.g., Thomas Mann's account of Hans Castorp in The Magic Mountain? This is not biography. Hans Castorp differs in his mode of existence from, say, Dr. John- son as you encounter him in BoswelFs Life. It is the difference between an imagin- ary character and a historical character. Boswell practices a discipline. Having read his book, it would be fantastic to write off the behavior of Dr. Johnson as so much process. But what about Thomas Mann and Hans Castorp? It will not do to say that Boswell adds to our knowledge while Thomas Mann does not. If you read Boswell, you learn a great deal about Dr. Johnson; but if you read Thomas Mann you learn a great deal about Hans Castorp. Having read Magic Mountain, [300]</page><page sequence="4">Disciplines and Sciences it would be fantastic to write off the behavior of Hans Castorp as so much process. Are we to say that Thomas Mann practices a discipline? Why not, indeed? His essential subject-matter is the activity of such persons as Hans Castorp, Settembrini, Herr Pieperkorn. In respect to such subject-matter, and the production of know- ledge about it, Thomas Mann and Boswell have more in common than either has with, say, Copernicus or Mendeleef or Euclid. One more of these questions: what about disciplines and sciences considered as subject-matter for teaching? If you grant the distinction between activity and process, and then project it forward into the distinction between discipline and science, can you stop there? Are there not equally important differences between the pedagogy of a discipline and the pedagogy of a science? I have spent over thirty years learning how to teach one or other of the philosophical disciplines. Many times I have been confronted with pedagogical problems which would not have arisen had I been teaching a science. If you generalize these and other matters you arrive at the question: In what ways does the pedagogy of a science differ from the pedagogy of a discipline? So much for questions which attest to the "logical efficacy" of the discipline- science distinction. Let me contrast questions with an objection; both form part of the "logical efficacy" of the distinction which gives rise to them. The objection might go this way: There is a rationale to process. It can be tracked down. There is also a rationale to activity. It too can be tracked down. Since tracking down the one is called science, so, tracking down the other should also be called science. In both cases the intended outcome is getting to know the rationale of what you are investigating. Indeed you could go further and point out that, in a generic sense, the method is the same in both cases. In both cases you proceed by showing that what you already know requires what you now propose as additional know- ledge. You validate, substantiate, verify, your new claim to know by showing that it is required by what you already know. This is as obvious in the case of an historian as in the case of an astronomer. Why then the distinction between a discipline and a science? I think this objection is doctrinaire. The trouble is with the word rationale and the associated word rational. These words are treacherously ambiguous. Applied to an activity, rationale means how reason is present in the activity; in what sense the activity is reasonable; in what sense it contains reasoning. What is the rationale of capital punishment? one might ask, using the word in this first sense. Or: What is the rationale of the fifth amendment? Or the separation of Church and state? Or tax-supported public education? There you have rationale in one of its senses. But applied to a process, rationale does not carry that meaning. Reason, reasoning, is not present in a process. A process is neither reasonable nor unreasonable. It is neutral to that distinction. A process might be anomalous but that would not mean unreasonable. When you speak of the rationale of a process, you do not refer to any reasoning going on in the process, or productive of the [301]</page><page sequence="5">The Christian Scholar process. What is the rationale of tooth-decay? one might ask, using the word in this second sense. Or: What is the rationale of rainbows? Or colic? Or volcanic eruption? This ambiguity in the word rationale, marks also the word rational. We speak of man as a rational animal, and we speak of the solar system as a rational order; but the word does not carry the same meaning in both cases. "Man is a rational animal" means that he reasons and can be reasoned with. So far as we know, the solar system does not reason, and cannot be reasoned with. When you say that it is a rational order, all you mean is that it can be reasoned about. The difference between these two senses is radical. You gain nothing by trying to minimize it. It is therefore misleading to say that the rationale of a process is in all relevant and important respects the same as the rationale of an activity. If this is so, is it not also misleading to say that the method of tracking down the one is, in all relevant and important respects the same as the method of tracking down the other? Let me spell out this point by an illustration from history; for example, the assassination of President Lincoln. I would invite you to notice questions which a discipline might ask because its subject-matter is activity, which a science would not ask because its subject-matter is process. Given the assassination of the pres- ident an historian can ask, Who did it? Why did he do it? meaning For what purpose? And then: What reason had he to believe that his act would bring about what he intended? What alternative acts could he have performed? Was he aware of these? Did he consider them at any length? What did he value, more than the life of Lincoln, out of regard for which he performed the act? Was his act done because he believed it to be right? Or although he believed it to be wrong? Or because he believed it to be wrong? What criterion of right and wrong was operative in his thinking? Was he tempted to refrain from this act? If not, why not? Did he require courage to do what he did? Or persistence? Did he decide later that he had acted mistakenly? Did he act on his own, or in co-operation with a group? What was his point in the Latin phrase which he shouted? These questions are repre- sentative for one discipline (history) in respect to one piece of activity (assassinating a president). Not every discipline could raise these questions about all activities; but, the point is, could any science raise any of these questions, or any others resembling them, about any process? The questions make good sense when asked by a discipline about an admitted activity. Would they make any sense if asked by any science about an admitted process? Given that sciences investigate process-behaviors and disciplines investigate activity-behaviors, you can go on to say that it takes a discipline to investi- gate scientific behavior. This follows from the fact that scientific behavior is itself not process but activity; indeed, I doubt that any behavior is more characteristically activity. At least two disciplines deal with scientific behavior, namely history and logic. There may be more, but these two will suffice to illustrate my point. If you [302]</page><page sequence="6">Disciplines and Sciences want to investigate the activity called astronomizing you must do more than study the solar system. You must study the activity performed by the astronomer. You may do this historically, and the outcome is a knowledge of the history of astronomy. It is not a knowledge of the history of the solar system. You may also investigate the activity performed by the astronomer in a different way, the outcome of which is neither a knowledge of the history of astronomy nor of the history of the solar system. For example, you may investigate the part which such com- ponent activities as reasoning and proving and defining and presupposing play in the overall activity called getting to know about the solar system. You will not learn about this by studying the behavior of the solar system because it does not perform any activities, let alone such activities referring to its own behavior. My interest in this distinction between disciplines and sciences arises out of my interest in philosophy, and my conviction that philosophizing is not "sciencing." A philosopher is not an undeveloped scientist. A philosophical discipline is not a body of systematic and orderly thinking on the way to becoming a science. When you are trying to teach a person to think philosophically you are not trying to teach him to think scientifically. The philosophical disciplines, e.g. logic, ethics, aesthetics, semantics, metaphysics, etc., are not sciences. They are systematic and orderly efforts to study activities or sets of activities which persons perform. If one must speak of behavior, and behavioral, they are behavioral disciplines. We reason and presuppose and learn. We do what we believe to be right and avoid doing what we believe to be wrong. We claim rights and acknowledge duties in a context provided by a politically organized community. We produce poems, pic- tures, statues, novels, plays, tunes. We use language to express and communicate our meanings. We perform acts of prayer and worship. We initiate and sustain in others activities which bring about the liquidation of their ignorance. These and similar activities form the subject matters of the philosophical disciplines. When you explore a philosophical discipline you learn to ask questions and seek answers about these activities. These questions and answers differ importantly from those which sciences ask and answer about processes. When the questions are of a certain sort, this is called philosophizing about the activities. That is why I would call philosophy a discipline, not a science; and its constituent "parts" disciplines, not sciences. This distinction would not be intended to suggest that in the one case (sciences) you come out with some knowledge, and that in the other case (the philosophical disciplines) you do not. So far as I can see, you come out with knowledge in both cases. But what you are getting to know about, in the one case, differs radically from what you are getting to know about in the other case. Where this is so, I see no objection to separate names for these knowledge- producing activities. [303]</page></plain_text>
