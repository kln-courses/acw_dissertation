<plain_text><page sequence="1">EXPERIMENTAL FICTION: INNOVATION VERSUS FORM Charles I. Glicksberg The novel, like poetry, has become more and more an experiment in language. It now plays all the registers, from breaking up the sentence to breaking up language taboos. But at the same time the novel has inter mingled more and more with the essay, philosophy, and sociology in its themes, means of narration, and in language.1 I What Is Experimental? the novel, since its inception, has proved to be the most flexible and accommodating of genres. It is a form that seems to lend itself to the most diverse and extreme experiments, even to the extent of boldly trespassing on the territory reserved for non-fiction and the drama. The writer of docu mentary fiction assumes that by concentrating on the "facts" in the case, consulting public documents and newspaper ac counts, tracking down clues, and, if the events he is concerned with took place not too long ago, interviewing the persons directly involved and obtaining testimony from witnesses, he is getting hold of "the real thing." Here is the unfabricated, unadulterated, unimpeachable truth.2 'Jan Kott, Theatre Notebook, Translated by Boleslaw Taborski. Garden City, N. Y.: Doubleday St Company, 1968, pp, 261-262. 2 Truman Capote insists that he originated a "new" literary form, "the Non-fiction Novel," when he published In Cold Blood. The claim is unfounded. What he has produced is a documentary narrative, like William Bradford Huie's Hiroshima Pilot, of a murderer, which makes use of many of the techniques developed by the art of the novel: dialogue, suspense, introspection, the arrangement of the action somewhat in the manner of a plot. But the total cumulative effect is that of a factually grounded chronicle. What, after all, is a fact? In the world of fiction there are no "facts" per se. Out of his material, the donn'ee, the novelist creates the inner life of his characters: their thoughts, dreams, ambitions, motivations. In his tale of seventeenth-century Milan, Alessandro Manzoni furnishes a vividly documented description of the plague 127</page><page sequence="2">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW The experimental novel marks a drastic departure from the type of realistic fiction to which we have been accustomed and which we tend to regard as the established and inviolable norm. The rebellious experimental novel is often the expres sion of disillusionment with the novel as a literary form—and this applies as well to the non-fiction novel. Contemporary culture not only permits but encourages freedom of experi mentation in all the arts, in the hope of calling forth creative originality. These experiments in the art of fiction affect both form and style, and a bewildering variety of styles and forms make their appearance. The experimental novel can be sociological in its sweep (like The Grapes of Wrath or U.S.A. or Men of Good Will)-, it can be fantastic like the novels of Samuel Beckett or allegorical in content like The Wild Goose Chase; it can utilize the Symbolist technique as in Down There by Huys mans; like Alain-Fournier's The Wanderer or The Castle by Kafka, it can take on the haunting dimensions of the dream world. It can; as in Moby-Dick, incorporate within its elastic structure chapters written entirely in dialogue. Or it can be built up as a complicated game, a recondite puzzle, leading "the reader (who wishes, naively, only to be told what to believe) through a fairground of illusions and deceptions, dis torting mirrors and trapdoors that open disconcertingly un der his feet, leaving him ultimately not with any simple or reassuring message or meaning but with a paradox about the relation of art to life."3 That is how the avant-garde novelist strives to overcome the restrictions of realism. He is free to in that swept through the city. He refers, in The Betrothed, to contemporary sources that give first-hand pictures of the terror that overwhelmed the survivors, the symptoms of the disease that attacked the body, the terrible death-rate, the removal of the corpses from the houses and streets and lazarettos, the way the dead were buried. (Does The Journal of the Plague Year, by Defoe, deserve to be classified as fiction?) Manzoni in troduces separate chapters of pure exposition, just as Tolstoy in War and Peace halted the forward movement of the narrative by inserting chapters which discuss various philosophies of history. In writing the section of An American Tragedy which deals with the trial, Dreiser "clung to fact when he could, lifting some 30 pages verbatim from old newspaper accounts of the court proceedings and the letters between the ill-fated lovers. In other instances he altered the news reports to heighten the drama and the sympathy for Clyde," W. A. Swanberg, Dreiser.

Franz Kafka, James Joyce, Marcel Proust, Virginia Woolf, and Samuel Beckett: it is they who went beyond the naturalistic method of characterization in which the primary stress is placed on the physical environment, heredity, and economic conditions and devised one which would do justice to the inner universe of being, the psychodrama of the self, the intimations of the unconscious.4 These iconoclastic pioneers silenced the opposition, and their triumph made it possible for a flood of novels to appear which worked havoc with the fictional forms of the past; they tore away the old props of plot construction and undermined the old belief in a fixed, unitary self. In a letter to Edward Garnett, D. H. Lawrence tried to describe in what way his characters violated the conventions of his age. You mustn't look in my novel for the old stable ego of character. There is another ego, according to whose action the individual is unrecognizable, and passes through, as it were, allotropic states which it needs a deeper sense than any we've been used to exer cise, to discover—states of the same single radically unchanged element. (Like as diamond and coal are the same pure single ele ment of carbon. The ordinary novelist would trace the history of the diamond—but I say, "Diamond, what! This is carbon!" And my diamond might be coal or soot, and my theme is car bon.)6 The material the writer of fiction works with all the time is what we loosely call "reality," yet nothing in the world is more ambiguous, protean, and elusive than this reality. There are as many kinds of reality as there are people to interpret it: the reality of the mystic and the reality of Gradgrind, the reality that Blake the visionary beheld and the reality of the Philistine. Bergson contends that "the facts" or data of ex 4 Such radical innovations are not without precedent. Long before the advent of Freud and the rise of black humor, Sterne, in Tristram Shandy, played fast and loose with the logic of the plot, moving freely from the living present to the remembered past in the fluid spectrum of time, achieving surrealistic effects and inventing delight ful comic extravaganzas. 5 Quoted in Walter Allen, The English Novel.

Fundamentally, that is why the novelist, like the poet, resorts to the use of metaphoric and symbolic language rather than depend on the abstractions of logical or scientific discourse. Direct introspection reveals the gross in adequacy of our common sense method of apprehending "reality"—a theme which Proust developed with clairvoyant insight in his series of novels: Remembrance of Things Past. Time, or "duration" as Bergson calls it, injects a disturbingly new element into the texture of experience. No two thoughts, no two sensations or images, since they stem from a different "past," can ever be the same. It is therefore impossible to repeat or recapture an experience. Bergson, heading the revolt against the bloodless abstrac tions of the intellect, initiated a movement that called for a return to the things themselves. The imaginative writer must trust his sensory impressions. It is only when the novelist per sists in viewing objects and events through a thick mist of pre conceived ideas that he falsifies the nature of experience. Reality, as we know it, is a cheat, a phantasmagoria, a delu sion. There are, generally speaking, two kinds of reality: one raw, pulsating, all-absorbing in its immediacy, but it passes and leaves nothing behind but a mental trace, a residual memory; then there is the superior reality of the imagination as it fuses past and present and, by annihilating time, perceives the only truth that is attainable by man—the truth projected by timeless memory.6 Proustian memory is a source of unique revelations and epiphanies. Proust's imagination was so constituted that it could render a scene in his fiction with hallucinatory vividness only when it could be viewed through the enchanted perspec 6 What Proust tries to capture is reality of a higher and truer kind: the truth of consciousness when it is emancipated from the distorting pressure of a particular mo ment. An event is seen in its proper shape and significance when it is viewed through the perspective of memory. "A consciousness in which remembrance causes past realities to arise, which has long since left behind the states in which it found itself when those realities occurred as a present, sees and arranges that content in a way very different from the purely individual and subjective."

Proust dwells with fascination on this power of vision that made it possible to capture "a fragment of time in its pure state."7 Proust was not interested in realism or naturalism. Subjective impressions were more revelatory than ideologies based on humanitarianism or politics. The novel, Proust maintained, cannot depend for its vitality and growth on factual verisimilitude. Fiction that plumes itself on its scrupulous use of realism is "the farthest removed from reality, the one that impoverishes and saddens us most, for it sharply cuts off all communication of our present self with the past ... or with the future. . . ,"8 The essence of being is in part subjective and therefore cannot be communicated. That is why literary realism fails, for it perpetuates a lie. Experimental techniques, the search for new means of ex pression, worked in cooperation with a modern literary move ment that sought to explore deeper levels of reality. The twen tieth-century writer probed areas of experience that had hitherto been unknown; he peered unaffrighted into the murky, pullulating depths of the unconscious; he stripped off the veils of convention, not held back by the taboos his culture imposed. He struggled to give birth to his profoundly altered vision of reality. Erich Kahler sums up the character of this ontological quest that involved a transformation of reality. We have to give up the notion that reality is something ab solutely stable. Until the beginning of our century people had been trained, largely by the teachings of science, to rely com pletely on the world of our senses. The substratum of our com mon sensory experience was regarded as the ultimate reference of objective existence, that is, of reality. . . . Meanwhile science again—or basic science, physics—has informed us that this sub stratum is neither reliable nor stable. A stone, a rock, which to our everyday experience appears as the paragon of solidity and durability, reveals itself to be a delusion of our senses; un derneath its appearance nothing but motion and change is going 7 Marcel Proust, The Past Recaptured, in Remembrance of Things Past.

I31</page><page sequence="6">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW The world we look upon is an anthropomorphic creation, the pathetic fallacy writ large. Our observations of the physical universe are conditioned by our sensory equipment and by our subjectivity. What followed as a result was the progressive loss of con fidence in the cult of objectivity. In the field of literature, the "realistic" method of portrayal in fiction was rendered suspect, its limitations exposed. Kahler remarks: It has become clear to us that reality is something very relative, something that depends on the capacity of our perception, on the degree of power, sharpness and rarity of perception. It has become clear to us that the "reality" of the sixteenth, eighteenth and twentieth centuries is by by no means the same reality. Ac tual reality seems to be just the last frontier to which our percep tive capacity has progressed. Seen in this aspect, "realism," in the old conventional sense of the word, is not valid realism at all; it is ... a very shallow and obsolete realism.10 How account for those works of fiction which broke away from the classic tradition of form? Novels like The Adventures of Don Quixote and Tristram Shandy inaugurated a movement which endeavored to gain recognition for what Wölfflin calls "open form." In its release of torrential energy, its emotional excess, this movement rode roughshod over all formal restraints. The result is that it encouraged some experimen talists in fiction to go too far in their audacious bid for novelty. In his essay, "The Disintegration of Artistic Form," Kahler writes of these experimental ventures: "Open, fragmentary forms that they are, they are nevertheless artistic by virtue of their exploratory quality, their seeking a deeper truth, a deeper congruence with reality."11 Tristram Shandy is a perfect example of the wilfully open form. Experiments in the field of fiction are prompted primarily and in most cases not by a craving for novelty at any cost, not by an irrepressible desire to tear down an effete and outlived tradition, but by a compelling necessity of the creative spirit. The call is sounded for a new dispensation, a radically ] Ibid., p. 152. 1 Erich Kahler, Out 0}the Labyrinth.

The Darwinian theory of evolution, the doctrine of natural selection, led literary naturalists to stress the philosophy of biological determinism. The Freudian analysis of the mind lent scientific sanction to what prophets like Dostoevski and Nietzsche had revealed before the birth of psychoanalysis: the strange underlying logic of the dream and its uncanny power of predicting the future, the hidden or dis guised but controlling influence of the unconscious and the minor role that reason plays in shaping the course of human behavior. The lyrical novel with its emphasis on subjectivity and in trospection was born of the need to throw off the straitjacket of naturalism in fiction. The lyrical novelist explored states of being, facets of experience, that had until then been left un recorded or unaccounted for: Dionysian ecstasies, deviations of the sexual instinct, the pleasure derived from the infliction of pain, the urge to kill, the criminal impulse in man, the hal lucinations and fantasies induced by drugs, the demonic seizures of madness. It is difficult to define the lyrical novel, a specialized form which grew out of the traditional novel, but some of its distinctive traits can be identified. The novel func tions lyrically when the characters in it emerge as personae for the self of the novelist. The lyrical novel is "a hybrid genre that uses the novel to approach the function of a poem."12 The most daring innovator of his time was James Joyce, whose work influenced a host of writers: Samuel Beckett, Michel Butor, Claude Mauriac, Hermann Broch, Thomas Wolfe, Hemingway, and Faulkner. Joyce, the Master, made them aware of the central importance of structure in com posing the novel, the need to plan the relation of the parts to the whole. He taught them how to deploy various dimensions 12 Ralph Freedman, The Lyrical Novel. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1963, p. 1. Whereas the traditional novel tries to achieve objectivity by portraying a person engaged in a series of actions that reveal his character, the lyrical novel places primary stress not on action but on imagery; the lyrical novel is structured and develops like a lyric. It offers an expressive medium for the illumination of the private inner world. The self becomes cosmos, theater, arena, the all-encompassing drama of destiny. Gide, Virginia Woolf, Huysmans, and Hermann Hesse have produced ex amples of this genre. 133</page><page sequence="8">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW of time in the unfolding of the plot. More important still was his use of the technique of simultaneity: the coexistence of the present, past, and future in a timeless moment of vision. He also experimented boldly with shifting points of view, with the interior monologue, and with the stream-of-consciousness technique. The Surrealist novelists rely on the unconscious to fecun date their imagination. They do not neglect, as one might offhand suspect, the difficult problem of form. Like tradi tional novelists they are concerned with the nature of reality, but they interpret it in a way that is in accord with their aesthetic philosophy. Surrealism, however, does not give rise to a prescriptive method. All that surrealist novelists have had in common is a spirit of anti-conformity in which protest, in form as much as in material, is to be judged valuable in the measure that it introduces an at mosphere having the effect of liberating modes of thought and action in which the surrealist can see his highest aspirations re flected.13 What the Surrealist novelists emphasized was the unique character of their vision, which was diametrically opposed to the assumptions underlying both realism and naturalism. II The New Novel and the Question of Reality Surrealist fiction did not prosper outside of France. The "new" novelists who dominated the literary scene in the fifties and sixties were, like the Surrealists, troubled by a reality they could not apprehend. Like Kant, they suspected that the mind of man stamps its own interpretation upon the world, and their methodological skepticism entered constitutively into the substance and structure of their fiction. They ceased to regard themselves as transcribers of a preexisting reality; they created it. Hence they were forced to devise new techni ques to handle this refractory, unfathomable, yet plastic material. They reduced the importance of the plot almost to the vanishing point: "the absence of plot in most New Novels 13 J. H. Matthews, Surrealism and the Novel.

Here was an aggressive aesthetic based upon the premise that the world is falsified when it is viewed with deluded anthropomorphic eyes. It should be described in its neutral isness, its phenomenological surface so that metaphysical depths or hidden transcendental entities are eliminated. The so-called higher essence is thus made to disappear; it was never there in the first place; it was only a semantic phantom, a ghost conjured up by the mind of the observer reading human traits into the physiognomy of nature. The world, in short, is as we perceive it. If it is down right foolish to see the world, in the manner of Teufelsdökh, Carlyle's persona in Sartor Resartus, as the symbolic vestment of God, it is equally foolish and unwarranted to look upon it as irremediably absurd. The "new" novel aims to get rid of auctorial commentary, sociological categories, philosophical generalizations, the threadbare trappings of plot and the gallery of convention ally typed characters. The world is what it is; this means that it is neither tragic nor comic but non-rational, beyond com prehension. Man cannot be grasped from the outside and ex amined in the light of socioeconomic or psychological con cepts. Man is what he does, what he says, what he feels, what he thinks; there is no antecedent "character" or preformed "self." The protagonist is a potentiality that contains all po tentialities for good or evil. If he is stripped of his identity (fre quently he is without a name), he is also denied autonomy. He reveals himself in his talk, his stream-of-consciousness. This method of registering the flow of consciousness, without 14 Vivian Mercier, The New Novel: From Quenau to Finget.

Le Voyeur (1955) is about a watch salesman who murders a thirteen-year-old girl. But the narrative does not relate the steps leading up to the murder or dwell on the murder itself. Introspection on the part of the protagonist is deliberately left out. His mental state is vouchsafed to the reader by the ob jects he gazes upon; visual images furnish an objective cor relative of his sadistic compulsion. The way he reacts to exter nal reality furnishes a clue to his psychopathic condition. He invests the objects in his environment with his own dementia. Robbe-Grillet wishes to demonstrate thai the universe is un affected by the human gaze. There is and there can be no reply to the questions man asks of the universe. In extruding the human element from the act of perception, in reducing the world of phenomena to brute sense-data, Robbe-Grillet is creating what might well be called "anti novels." The aesthetic rationale that supports his experimen tal method is open to serious objections. He hopes to put an end to the pathetic fallacy. Vain endeavor! In the world of fic tion, there is no world without man. In omitting the human response, Robbe-Grillet confuses the reader. In The Voyeur the mystery of the murder is never cleared up. The same techni que of mystification appears in Jealousy (1957)- We cannot make out whether the act of adultery was committed or whether it was all imagined by the jealous husband. John Weightman singles out the two major intellectual contradic tions on which Robbe-Grillet's work rests. Robbe-Grillet wants to "cleanse the external world of the pathetic fallacy and show us things as they are, independently of human emotions."15 Robbe-Grillet denies that he is speaking as the founder or prophet of the New Novel; the expression, the New Novel, he declares, "is merely a convenient label applicable to those 15 John Cruickshank (ed.), The Novelist as Philosopher.

Each writer must create the form that will suit his needs. "For the function of art is never to il lustrate a truth—or even an interrogation—known in ad vance, but to bring into the world certain interrogations (and also, perhaps, in time, certain answers) not yet known as such to themselves."17 It is a mistake to assume that all the novels that have been classified as belonging to the school of "new" fiction are cut from the same cloth and in accordance with the same general pattern. For example, Degrees, by Michel Butor, is frankly a venture in virtuosity, a tour de force. It attempts to record the life and reveal the character of a group of students and teachers in a French school by presenting the same events from different points of view. Pierre Vernier, a teacher of geography and history in a lycee, is interested in writing a "true" and full account of the pupils in his class. It is this desire to get everything down on paper that defeats his pro ject.18 Nor do Nathalie Sarraute's novels conform to the kind of fiction Robbe-Grillet has published. She dramatizes with ex tremely subtle shades of insight the ceaseless conflict that goes on between the self and the world, the "I" and "the Other." 18 Alaine Robbe-Grillet, For a New Novel. Translated by Richard Howard. New York: Grove Press, 1965, p. 9. 17 Ibid., p. 14. 18 "I was trying to explain that it is impossible to represent the earth exactly without distorting it just as it is impossible to represent reality in speech without a certain kind of projection, a system of points of reference whose shape and organiza tion depend on what you are trying to show, and, as a corollary, on what you need to know." (Michel Butor, Degrees. Translated by Richard Howard. New York: Simon and Schuster, 1961, p. 48.) As one critic remarks: "There is no stopping point either in time or space, for everything is inextricably bound up with everything else." (Laurent Le Sage, The French New Novel. University Park: Pennsylvania State Univer sity Press, 1962, p. 74.) Indeed, Vernier confesses: "I .would have to write down everything and I cannot write down everything, I cannot even write down everything I know I might need for this narrative, for this description, this operation I am attempting. ..." (Michel Butor, Degrees, p. 104.) i37</page><page sequence="12">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW In this conflict there can be no shared moments of mutuality. The effort at communion is based on illusion; love is coupled with hate. If in the Sartrean dialectic the relationship between the self and the Other is one of strife, in the fictional world of Sarraute it is characterized by suspicion, mistrust, antagonism, covert aggression. The life of the mind, as Sarraute depicts it, is one of intrigue, dissimulation, and duplicity. The "sub-conversational" tone of her fiction is meant to convey what goes on inside her characters: the psychic ac tivity, dim, undefined, before it emerges as a feeling and before that feeling is translated, invariably distorted, in con sciously controlled speech. Sarraute is interested primarily in capturing these vague undertows of the subconscious, these intimations of a hostile sensibility that carefully refrains from coming out into the open. She portrays her characters as go ing through a rehearsal of learned gestures, studied looks, and disarming speech but beneath their conventional behavior she divulges the battle that is raging within, the interior drama of conflict: the outburst of aggression, the symbolic murders, the strategies of seduction, the savage, rejoicing cry of triumph. She probes the concealed recesses of the mind and pictures the slimy, repulsive creatures crawling in these turbid depths.19 Sarraute, like Robbe-Grillet, is writing anti-novels. In his preface to Portrait of a Man Unknown, Sartre declares that anti novels, by employing a technique of deception, aim "to make use of the novel in order to challenge the novel, to destroy it before our very eyes while seeming to construct it. . . ."20 He compares Portrait of a Man Unknown to a detective story. Sarraute faces the complex and difficult task of getting "in 19 "The rapidity, the complexity, and the minuteness of Sarraute's almost invisible dramas, the dialogues themselves . . . fade with the progress and the elaboration of emotion into relationships which are almost too ephemeral to grasp (since she emphasizes the secret and uncertain interior universe and minimizes the misleading signs of appearances) and are lost, as they are in life, under the conventional surface play of things, habits, stereotypes, and time."

The conflict at the heart of her fiction works out the implications of the dialectic between truth and duplicity, the inner and outer, the authen tic and the inauthentic. Sarraute is fascinated by the mystery of human relation ships. In Martereau (1953), we view what goes on through the mind's eye of the hypersensitive tubercular young pro tagonist. He suspects that his uncle and the woman he married, Martereau, have designs upon him. He knows that if he is perpetually on guard, watching every move they make, they, in turn, detect the precise nature of his thoughts, for he, too, betrays himself. He feels himself surrounded on all sides by dangerous plots and cruel conspiracies. Refinement is piled upon refinement as the suspicious "I" becomes aware of its precarious relation to the others. Their spoken words are calculated deceptions, nimble tricks of the tongue. Even their silence is meaningful—and hostile. When these characters are seated around a table, they respond to every nuance of tone, the most insignificant detail: "a half-smile on their faces, a sly glance, a sudden peal of laughter, and you may be sure that you have been condemned, with no possible appeal."21 The world within that Sarraute projects for us is a world of shifting attitudes, cunning alibis and evasions, elaborate rituals of rationalization, casuistry, resentment, and self-jus tification. Each character feels isolated, surrounded by in imical outsiders, jeering, uncaring. Each one plays a chosen part, eager to make the right impression, to exhibit the ex alted image he has of himself. If one ventures to speak up and reveal his "real" identity, he is exposed to the laughter of the group and becomes the victim of their aggression. For there are those who refuse to listen with compassion; they cannot understand, and make no effort to do so, why the inner self often behaves with such absurd lack of control; they fail to respond to the call for sincerity. No, they prefer to laugh at 21 Nathalie Sarraute, Martereau. Translated by Maria Jolas.

The dialogue they engage in is in reality a duel, though waged with words rather than swords. In The Planetarium (1959), one character thinks: "Nobody has yet discovered the language that could express instantaneously what we perceive at a glance: an entire human being, with its myriads of little movements, which appear in a few words, a laugh, a gesture."22 Claude Mauriac's The Dinner Party is an exploration of reality in all its baffling complexity or as much of it as the art of fiction at present can encompass. The novel reports the ebb and flow of conversation at a dinner party—the bright, witty talk, the remarks made and the responses that bridge the awkward intervals of silence, the refined tidbits of gossip designed to make the time pass pleasantly. This is contrasted with the introspections and retrospections of the inner self, the variable spectrum of moods and memories. Mauriac is in terested in searching for the answer to such questions as: What is the truth of the self? What is the reality behind the masks the actors wear in this improvised social drama? What do the spoken words hide? Who knows the heart of "the other"? Mauriac allows the dialogue to flow freely (without identifying the speaker by means of such tags as "he said" or "she said"), concurrently with the unvoiced stream of in trospection. The Dinner Party is an impressive tour de force, but its ex cellence is due not to its experimental techniques but to the depth of insight Mauriac achieves in portraying his eight assembled guests. The author is, seemingly, entirely removed from the narrative.23 Bernard, who broods upon his work and reputation as a novelist, feels that the subject of a novel does not matter in the least. "One could write about anything. . . . 22 Nathalie Sarraute, The Planetarium. Translated by Maria Jolas. New York: George Braziller, 1959, p. 41. 23 "Le Diner en ville includes not only conventional dialogues and interior monologues but also interior or 'silent' dialogues.

He attempted to revolutionize the conventional forms of fiction by creating a dual point of view, at once objective and subjective, with the greatest possible precision and accuracy. What we think is as true, or as mistaken, as what we see.26 In revealing the subjective preoccupations of his characters, Mauriac, like Andre Malraux, shows that "we are all obsessed.

The nouveau roman has not inaugurated a fruitful movement nor were the writers said to belong to this movement bound together by a common aesthetic outlook and philosophy of fic tion. Robbe-Grillet, Butor, Sarraute, Mauriac differ on a number of important issues relating to their art. They are, as a group, opposed to moralizing; their aim is to picture the world as it is. Robbe-Grillet refuses to smuggle emotions into his interpretation of the world; he rejects the pathetic fallacy and its use to vindicate the existence of God. By hewing to the technique of chosime, by lavishing excessive attention on ex ternal details, he tends to drain the story of human interest.27 In discussing the importance of technique in constructing the novel, Mauriac points out that the narrative and descriptive methods he used in Le Diner en ville were connected with the title.28 Ill The Experimental Vogue in the United States 2* Claude Mauriac, The Dinner Party.

In the American version of the picaresque novel, anything goes. The author is granted unlimited freedom to invent, to improvise. He is at liberty to introduce digressions that are fantastic or grotesque in con tent and unrelated to the rest of the narrative. The hit-or-miss method of shaping the structure of the novel is based on the assumption that today we inhabit not only an irrational but decidedly mad world and that the most unrestrained im agination must lag behind the surrealist surprises of reality. The characters who bob up in Thomas Pynchon's V. conform to no predictable pattern of behavior. There are a few principal characters, like Benny Profane and Herbert Stencil, whose fortunes we can follow. Profane has evolved a philosophy of life suitable for a professional schlemiel, which he considers himself to be. Like Augie March, he is the picaresque protagonist who is filled with the spirit of opposition; he refuses to emulate the socially ap proved stereotypes of conformity. He welcomes whatever adventures come his way. He is willing to enjoy sex but is not inclined to make a fetish of it. Profane (the name is not idly chosen) is only half Catholic; his mother is Jewish. Herbert Stencil is the son of Sidney Stencil. The father had worked in the Foreign Service of his country and had set out to solve the mystery of V.—an obsession that he bequeathed to his son. He had left Herbert his journals that record the leading events of his career as a secret agent. Herbert recalls one entry he had memorized. Dated Florence, April 1899, it reads: "There is more behind and inside V. than any of us had suspected. Not who, but what: what is she?"29 This marks the first mention of the theme of the quest. Herbert had come across the cryptic reference to V. and now he had an aim in life. This is how Pynchon introduces the theme: 29 Thomas Pynchon, V. Philadelphia and New York: J. B. Lippincott Company, &gt;963&gt; P- 53 142</page><page sequence="17">EXPERIMENTAL FICTION Work, the chase—for it was V. he hunted—far from being a means to glorify God and one's godliness (as the Puritans believe) was for Stencil grim, joyless; a conscious acceptance of the unpleasant for no other reason than that V. was there to track down.30 This is the overture to the sprawling, inchoate, open-ended plot. Pynchon plays ingenious variations on the meaning of the symbol V. and the pursuit of V. The quest has become for him an obsession that he cannot give up. The account of the quest is replete with diverting, chiefly comic episodes. Despite the discontinuity of time and place and the bizarre, erratic pro gression of the plot, the novel holds our interest. It evokes an atmosphere of strangeness and suspense, it combines mystery with satire, metaphysical insights with hilarious scenes of buffoonery and burlesque. Somehow Pynchon manages to relate the host of proliferating and peripheral incidents to the central theme. Dentistry, plastic surgery, prosthetics, spying, the war against the blacks in Africa, the hunting of alligators in the sewers of New York: all of these have some bearing on the question: Who is V.? But whoever V. may be, she (is it a female who represents the almighty power of sex, the mons veneris?) keeps her secret well hidden. Perhaps the mystery would be unveiled in Vheissu, the strange land where dreams are the reality, a place that resembles a woman. V. could stand for Venus or it could, in a broader sense, represent the pervasive mystery of existence. Pynchon's experiment in exploiting various types of am biguity is supported by an original and iconoclastic power of imagination. Though the mystery of V. can probably be equated with the primal force of sex, we can never be certain that this is so. Pynchon is not writing a psychoanalytic tract, disguised as fiction, which will demonstrate that politics, history, wars, and revolution have their inception and derive their energy from the soil of sexuality. He is not propounding a Freudian thesis. Though the basic theme is steeped in sex ual ambiguity, it is not limited to that alone. It explores 1 Ibid., p. 55. 43</page><page sequence="18">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW higher dimensions of meaning. Stencil is himself puzzled by the elusiveness of the symbol V. What a joke if at the end of this hunt he came face to face with himself afflicted by a kind of soul-transvestism. . . . Truthfully he didn't know what sex V. might be, nor even what genus and species. To go along assuming that Victoria the girl tourist and Veronica the sewer rat were one and the same V. was not at all to bring up metempsychosis: only to affirm that his quarry fitted in with the Big One, the century's master cabal, in the same way Victoria had with Vheissu plot and Veronica with the rat order.31 Pynchon is not proclaiming a creed or leading up to a morally edifying ending. He is composing an absorbing work of fiction. He includes a wealth of material that relates to the plight of the modern world: global warfare, colonialism, fallout, automation, the atoipic bomb. The aura of mystery is not dissipated by passages such as the following: In the eighteenth century it was often convenient to regard man as a clockwork automation. In the nineteenth century, with Newtonian physics pretty well assimilated and a lot of work in thermodynamics going on, man was looked on more as a heat engine, about 40 per cent efficient. Now, in the twentieth cen tury, with nuclear and subatomic physics a going thing, man had become something which absorbs X-rays, gamma rays and neutrons.32 Each literary rebel against the presumed "laws" of fiction does so because he has caught a new or radically different vision of "reality." He extends the art of the novel, revitalizes it, by undermining the established tradition. His imagination is not to be tied down, kept within safe territorial limits. Donald Barthelme, like Pynchon, creates a reality that is unprecedented, antinomian, disturbingly new. In his review of Snow White, Richard Gilman describes this new reality 31 Ibid., p. 226. Despite the free-wheeling profusion of incidents in the novel, it is held together by an internal coherence of plot: the reference to rats comes early in the narrative when Profane is given a job hunting alligators in the sewers.-of New York City. Pynchon tells the fantastic story of Father Fairing and his conversion of the rats. He is highly successful in bringing Veronica, the most sexy member of the flock, to worship Christ. 32 Ibid., p. 284. 144</page><page sequence="19">EXPERIMENTAL FICTION as being open-ended, provisional, characterized by suspended judgments, by disbelief in hierarchies, by mistrust of solutions, denouements and completions, by self-consciousness issuing in tremendous earnestness but also in far-ranging mockery. . . ,33 This is a generous but not undeserved tribute to this parody of the fairy tale, which mocks the traditional forms of the genre. Illogical, irreverent, ironic, it exposes the seamy side of modern life. The writer, denied the experience of transcendence, must deal with a reality that is impure, dis enchanting, often sordid and shady. Snow White is a brilliant exercise in virtuosity of style, an im pressive demonstration of the derisory uses (sardonic, satiric, comic) to which the language of fiction can be put. It is an in structive and amusing example of the revolution that has been effected in the form of the novel. There is no sign of a unified plot, though Snow White suggests the shadowy outline of a story. In disintegrating the traditional container of form, Barthelme is able to mirror a world that fails to make sense. The ceremony of innocence is gone. Moral values, once taken for granted, are laughed out of court. The institutions of society are treated as a huge joke. Barthelme has no solution to offer. We are shown how Snow White, the queen of the household, graciously bestows her favors on her seven ad mirers. Bill, the leader of the group, exhibits an eccentricty that is diverting: he cannot bear to be touched, not by anyone, not even by Snow White. The others speculate that the reason for this idiosyncrasy is "that he doesn't want to be involved in human situations any more. A withdrawal. Withdrawal is one of the four modes of dealing with anxiety.''34 They are dis turbed by Bill's symptoms of withdrawal, the sheer waste of his potential. Barthelme includes many devastating criticisms directed at the practice of psychiatry. One scene cleverly reveals the extent to which language in the age of Freud and Wilhelm Reich has become sexualized. Then Dan came in. "Dan, what is an interrupted screw?" Henry 53 The New Republic, June 3, 1967, p. 27. " Donald Barthelme, Snow White. New York: Atheneum, 1967, p. 4. 45</page><page sequence="20">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW asked. "An interrupted screw," Dan said, "is a screw with a dis continuous helix, as in a cannon breech, formed by cutting away of parts of the thread, and sometimes part of the shaft. Used with a lock nut having corresponding male sections." 35 This passage conveys the distinctive flavor of Snow White: the give-and-take of sophisticated repartee, the built-in linguistic jokes, the satire of sexuality, technology, and psy choanalysis, the implied criticism of the lack of authentic communication in our time. Snow White contains references to Sartrean Existentialism when it speaks of "the self armoring itself against the gaze of the Other."36 Barthelme even in cludes a questionnaire for the reader to fill out, which will test his understanding of the contents, his reaction to the characters in the novel, his degree of appreciation of the style. Question 7, for example, reads as follows: "Do you feel that the creation of new modes of hysteria is a viable undertaking for the artist of today? Yes ( ) No ( )."37 The author at one point interjects a note which furnishes a clue to his method of composition: "We like books that have a lot of dreck in them, matter which presents itself as not wholly irrelevant (or in deed, at all relevant) but which carefully attended to, can supply a kind of 'sense' of what is going on."38 IV Experimentalism and Anarchy Ronald Sukenick, like Barthelme, owes much to the work of Samuel Beckett. He breaks up the formal structure of the novel. Instead of striving to achieve naturalistic fidelity of detail and thus create a sustained illusion of reality, he refuses to play the game according to the rules of realism. He defiantly announces his presence as author and calls attention to his manhandling of the plot. He lets it be known that he is inventing characters and putting them in stories he has con cocted. These characters are assigned a part to play in the ac tion, but they are not to be taken too seriously: they are, after all, only creatures of his imagination, pure "fictions." In 5 Ibid., p. 29. J Ibid., p. qq. 1 Ibid., p. 82. * Ibid., p. 106. 146</page><page sequence="21">EXPERIMENTAL FICTION order to prevent the reader from being carried away by the hypnotic magic of the tale, Sukenick utilizes some of the technical devices Dos Passos employed in U.S.A. The novella, "The Death of the Novel," includes snatches of contemporary history, excerpts from newspapers, current speeches, discus sion of timely ideas in the field of aesthetics, politics, economics, and social science. The author feels free to digress, to flout the laws of logic, to interrupt the flow of the narrative and turn it in a new, unanticipated direction. All these in novations are in keeping with his conviction that the self is to day nonexistent and that reality eludes our grasp. "The Death of the Novel" begins portentously as follows: Realistic fiction presupposed chronological time as the medium of a plotted narrative, an irreducible individual psyche as the subject of its characterization, and, above all, the ultimate, con crete reality of things as the object and rationale of its descrip tion. In the world of post-realism, however, all of these have become absolutely problematical. The contemporary writer—the writer who is acutely in touch with the life of which he is a part—is forced to start from scratch: Reality doesn't exist. God was the omniscient author, but he died; now no one knows the plot, and since our reality lacks the sanction of a creator, there's no guarantee as to the authenticity of the received version.39 This has been developed into a crusading aesthetic of fiction that celebrates the emergence of the novel as a superb feat of fabulation, a triumph of the spirit of improvisation. The writer is at liberty to present his version of chaos and call it a cosmos. Sukenick confidently defends the viability of the ex perimental novel: The "experimental novel" isn't experimental any more. The ex periment has been a success and we now have a large, solid com plex alternate tradition for fiction that, far from the suffocating agoraphobic conception of the novel in the fifties, presents an enormous number of options.40 The above gratulatory pronouncement is vastly overdone. 39 Ronald Sukenick, The Death of the .Novel and Other Stories. New York: The Dial Press, 196g, p. 41. 40 Ronald Sukenick, "Culture for Sale," The New York Times, August 20, 1972. 47</page><page sequence="22">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW The experiment has not been an unadulterated success. As a general rule, the wilful, unrestrained deployment of "ex perimental techniques" in fiction without regard for their organic relatedness to the structure as a whole, results in ob fuscation. The writer may cavort and kick up his heels in a display of dazzling virtuosity, but the staged cleverness, the comical and often farcical interludes, the erotic jokes, the ver bal tricks, only add to the cumulative effect of formlessness. The "bad" experimental novel can usually be spotted by its negative manifestations: its joshing tone, its reliance on dead pan humor, its exaggerated satire, its unmotivated mutations of character, its reckless disregard for the continuity of action. It can be recognized, too, by its brazen and persistent intru sion of the voice of the author. In The Exaggerations of Peter Prince, the a uthor, following the example set by such illustrious predecessors as Sterne and Samuel Beckett, tells us that he is making up the description of his hero: his voice, height, weight, ears, bodily shape, hands, and so on. In the midst of these preparations for the portrait that is to emerge, Steve Katz informs us that he has decided to leave out the Prince's stutter "because it's tough enough for Peter Prince to get along without tripping over his speech."41 He confesses the difficulties he encounters in meet ing the challenge of the blank page. He reports that one editor was unfavorably impressed by this novel, and then adds this remark, tongue-in-cheek: "Don't think I disagree with him. You know as well as I do that I don't see where I am going."42 He does not hesitate to disclose his "intentions," the scenes he plans to leave out but which he nevertheless reproduces as a sample of his critical judgment. When he is blocked and in vokes the Muse but there is no responsive spurt of inspiration, he decides that his method of composition must be at fault. "Nothing gets started, nothing happens."43 Finally, he in vents a scene of action for Peter Prince and is able to leave him for a while, now that "things are in good narrative order, and 41 Steve Katz, The Exaggerations of Peter Prince.

Steve Katz not only "exaggerates" but "im provises" with a vengeance. He comments cheerfully or with acerbity on the unpredictable and erratic course of the plot; he is the chorus of one who points out the sudden transmuta tion the characters undergo, the uncalled-for and fortuitous digressions. After starting the novel, he protests that he is dis pleased with the opening gambit: Enough! . . . It's not a promising beginning. . . . You can't write whatever you want. . . . Where's the story? How are you going to catch us up in it and write a novel so that the reader won't be able to put it down. . . .45 In this fictional universe of flux that the author constructs with hit-or-miss abandon, anything can happen: the wildest improbabilities, the most blatant fabrications, episodes dragged in that have no relation to what preceded these events; characters lose their previous identity and suddenly find themselves in a different part of the earth. Sometimes the author allows two unconnected tales to run concurrently by arranging them in two columns, side by side. He worries about his repeated tactical error in pushing Peter Prince, the protagonist, off stage, but he cannot help himself. It's not so easy these days with air pollution, traffic fatalities, population explosion, mind-zapping drugs, water pollution, job offers from industry, the FBI and CIA, the Cosa Nostra, catching up with everyone. It's not so easy under these con ditions, believe me, to hang on to a character for a whole novel before he gets shuttled off into death or some other terminal ex perience, that craps him right out of the novel and into whatever else.48 These glib, smart-alec alibis fail to carry conviction. It is * Ibid., pp. 175-176. ! Ibid., p. 3. 'Ibid., pp. 51-52. 49</page><page sequence="24">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW this irresponsible attitude on the part of the novelist, together with his exhibitionist tendencies, that rubs the reader the wrong way. This frisky, devil-may-care method of improvisa tion does not give depth to the characters portrayed. One wonders what object Katz had in mind in dashing off (it must have been at breakneck speed) these 281 pages. Is the whole thing—the gratuitous digressions, the typographical anarchy, the cartoons that are used occasionally, the marginal com ments, the impertinent authorial intrusions, the heavy handed outbursts of satire—a misguided attempt to lend form and substance to the fallacy of imitative form? The verbal pyrotechnics are not enough to save The Exaggerations of Peter Prince from failure. The parts, the disjecta membra, do not cohere to form a meaningful, aesthetically satisfying whole, but he ignores such "artificial" standards. Witness his jocular comment upon a scene that is wrongly placed: "Good-by structure. Good-by well-made book."47 The assumption that a novel which is boldly experimental in structure and style is ipso facto superior to the traditional novel is without warrant. The experimental novel goes astray when it jumps off the deep end to show its contempt for the strictures of form and the requirements of the plot. It falls into anarchy when it improvises scenes of action that do not fit within its overall context and are not significantly connected with the lives portrayed. David Lodge cogently states the ob jections that might be raised against those experimental novelists who in the name of freedom create a formless work: The function of the avant-garde is to win new freedom, new ex pressive possibilities, for the arts. But these things have to be won, have to be fought for; and the struggle is not merely with ex ternal canons of taste, but within the artist himself. To bend the existing conventions without breaking them—this is the strenuous and heroic calling of the experimental artist.48 47 Ibid., p. 122. 48 David Lodge, The Novelist at the Crossroads, p. 170. i5°</page></plain_text>
