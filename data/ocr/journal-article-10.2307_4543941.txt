Ist nicht der Kern der Natur Menschen im Herzen? GOETHE. THERE is a pathetic irony in the constant recurrence throughout the history of the human intellect of the elementary question "What is truth ?" After the brilliant and comparatively successful achievements of science durinig the last hundred years, this question is still raised with all the freshness of a new problem. And it is perhaps all the more curious that the- scientists who claim to possess truth hardly seem to trouble themselves about its nature; while those who seek to know its meaning are not in general scientists, but " philosophers." Underlyinig the question there seems to lurk a sense of disap- pointeient with the results derived from the arduous activity of the human intellect, a feeling which suggests not so much " Was it worth while to spend human energy in this way? " as rather "Is this all that the intellect can contribute to enrich the human spirit ?" A skilfully linked chain of reasoninig, a system of ideas or concepts, be they never so " objective," an orderly arrangement of categories-in what way do these or can these satisfy the mind? There is also implied the suggestion that even on the most favourable view of truth it is but one direction in which the mind seeks fulfilment; and that its direction must be distinguished from, or co-ordinated with, other equally importarit human interests in what is good, or, again, in</page><page sequence="2">186 J. B. BAILLIE. what is beautiful. There would clearly be no iiieaninoa in raising the question if scienitific " truth " were literally all that the human mind sought; or, at any rate, the question rgard- ing truth could not be raised in this simple fornm. If the answer is to be forthcoming it can only be givenl in terms different from, and, in genieral, wider than, truth itself. Otherwise we should raise the questioni again in our answer, or know the answer before we raised the question; and either way our procedure would be fri-olous.* It is because of this iniherent limitation in the significance whichl truth has for the human imiind, a limlitation which becomes as obvious by our increasing success in reaching truth as by our failure to attain it, that the mind in its concern for its cormpleter life seeks to fix the place of truth in the economy of its experienice. In our own timie we find those who, laying stress on the independence of truth, treat the human mind as but a medium in which truth is intermittently realised or focussed; the mind is subordinate to the truth, and shapes its conscious processes in terms of an " objective" order or system. In inevitable reaction from this position there are those who consider that truth is not independent of the mind, that truth is at best but subordinate to and domiinated by the prior practical interests of the mind, a mere instrument for its purposes. The one, it may be said, holds that the individual mind is made what it is by the truth, the other that the truth is what the mind practically makes it to be; the one insists that ideas " work " because they are true, the other that they are true because they work; the one maintains that the course of our ideas is determined in the interest of the truth, the other that the trutlh is determined in the interest of our practical * It is for a like reason that the answer to the question can never be given by stating a " criterion " of truth. A criterion of truth must itself be a true criterion, and we are thus at once in an indefinite regress in the search for such an instrument, or we already have it in our hands all the while.</page><page sequence="3">ANTTIROPOMORPHISMI AND TRUTH. 187 ideas. Between these two, clearly, no reconciliation is possible; nior can the onie give way to the other, for no arg-ument from either side reaches the underlying assumptionis of the other. Bothi, indeed, miay agree that a truth can be true only for an individual minid, since there is no mind which is not an individual nmind in some sense or degree of individuality; but there is no possible agreelment between them when one says that a truth is niever true if it is only "my truth," while the other says that a truth which is not "my truth" is no truth at all. These are contrary propositions: they may both be false, but canilot be true together or be reconciled as they stand. The assumption in the one case is that the individual mind is always qualified by a particular element which either is, or shiould be, in process of dissolution into the universality characteristic of truth; the assumption in the other case is that the particular element is in itself precious to the individual, and neither can nor should be surrendered to the claims of a universal which, however important, is always " abstract" and incapable of doing full justice to what is particular. Whatever language each may use to express its views, and whatever special aspect of individuality may be emphasised in one case or denied in the other, the generalisa- tion of the principles defended in the two cases leads us inevitably to this sheer divergence between their fundamental presuppositions. Both views ignore two fundamental conditions of human experience, and neglect of these is the chief source of the difficulty of finding any reconciliation between their opposing positionis. They both cleal with the individual mind as a fully developed and fully equipped finiite reality face to face with a statically complete anid finished realm of objects, or groups of objects, existing alongside the individual nind. The activity of the minld is thus made to colnsist in co-ordinating its processes to this objective realm, one view laying chief stress on the reference to the objective sphere with which the mind has to be co-ordinated, the other on the mental process of co-ordination.</page><page sequence="4">188 J. B. BAILLIE. It is forgotten by both alike that the individual miiind is niever fully developed at all, but is ever growing from the earliest date of its existence to the last; that its growth towards ever increasing fulfilment of its being and of unison with its world is the very essence of its experience. Again, both overlook the fact that behind the processes of both practical action and intellectual procedure lies the mnore ultimate reality of the single indivisible individuality itself. It is this which determines the laws and conditions of practice, and the laws and conditions of intellectual activity. Thus, for instance, the essence of all thinking consists in grouping differences within a single principle, in finding an identity which animates distinctions. But this character of thought is derived from the nature of the individual mind, which is a living unity of all its varied manifestations. To attempt, therefore, to express the whole nature of human individuality in terms of the intellect, to describe its living )rocedure as a logical procedure, and its chief end as the attainment of some scheme of conceptuial truth, is a complete inversion of the actual connection between thought and miental individuality. Individuality prescribes the course which thought has to take, not thought the character which individuality should possess. It is because the mind is an organic unity in variety that thought is a function of mind operating in the way it does, viz., by seeking identity in difference. Individuality is not wholly or simply logical in its procedure, because it can function logically; and, therefore, logical proceduire is neither the sole aim nor the sole clue to the nature of individuality.* That logical procedure * This fallacy, or, shall I say, misconception, seems to me to underlie the work of Mr. Bosanquet, who may be taken as one representative of the view that human individuality finds itself in becoming conscious of of an independent scheme or system of intellectual truth. We have but to recall his constant use of such expressions as the logic of will, the logic of feeling, the logic of individuality, and the like, not to speak of his insistence on the logical principle of non-contradiction as a clue to ultimate truth, in order to see the justification for this remark. Doubt-</page><page sequence="5">ANTHROPOMORPHISM AND TRUTh. 189 is not the sole clue to the meaning of miiental individuality is plain when we note that the same fundamental nature of mnind as an indivisible concrete unity of all its processes determiiines the laws and conditions not merely of practical procedure in the strict sense, but the emotional life of mind, its aesthetic procedure, the process of striving, the processes of memory, imaginatiorn and perception. All these operate in their own .sphere as special expressions of the fundamental nature of mental life, of which each is but a particular form. They require no assistance from initellectual procedure as such, anid are not affected or governed by its peculiar laws. This is seen in actual experience, e.g. in the success with which the life of the ordinary moral agent, or again of the artist, can be prosecuted in spite of the fact that these individuals neither can, nor care to, understand the attempt to interpret their procedure in the language and in the terms of conceptions, which is the peculiar business of those wlho are mainly interested in intellectual activity. Nor are they perturbed by the contention, put forward by those who pursue the aims of the intellect, that thought 'occupies a privileged position in the life of mind, seeinig that thought interprets and understands. For the reply is obvious that thought only has a primary significance for those whose business it is to pursue the aims of thought, and that it is natural to regard as more important what one finds to be one's niain interest. The philosopher (or the man of science) can convince no oiie but a philoo,3pher that thinking holds a place of privilege in the life of the mind. Men of action or artists will less he is forced by the facts to use other and quite different expressions, as I shall point out; but there can be no question, I think, of the mnain tendency of his view. The facility with which the processes, for example, of will can be rendered into logical formula- is largely illusory. Given that the mind is the source of the laws and conditions of both will and intellect, and that the same ultimate principle of mind (unity in variety) governs and determines both, and the possibility of translating the processes of one function into the terms of the other follows almost as a matter of course. And in the samie way we might, and do, translate intellectual processes into the language and procedure of will.</page><page sequence="6">190 J. B. BAILLIE. neither concede nor deny the contention of the philosoplher they will regard it with indifference or toleration, and will feel instinctively that it is an argument in defence of a foregone conclusion based on prejudice or predilection. The artist will probably say- The rest may reason, and welcome, 'Tis we musicians know. If, then, we are to determiine the place which truth holds in experience, in its value for human life, we must start from a positioni which does justice to the niature of human individuality; for this is fundamenital to the whole problem. I feel oni solid ground when I regard the iindividual mind as a supreme conscious realisation of the energy of life, rooted in the inorganic elements of nature, iniseparable from lower organic processes and conditions, and utilising all these to sustain and fulfil the higher level of vital energy in which mind consists. Being a form of life, the characteristic quality of its activity is that of development in response to and co-respondence with the wvorld in which it has become consciously alive. Being more than mere physical organisation, its development is more than mere physical growth, and is not arrested at the stage of physio- logical maturity. Its development consists primnarily in developmrient of internal arrangement, not of external embodi- ment, a qualitative rather than a quantitative process. As a developing individuality, it faces its world with its whole energies, in their global entirety, if I may call it so, a develop- ment which proceeds not in a linear direction, but as a com-pact. whole, carrying all its specific functions along with it in indissoluble co-ordination. Differentiation of its fuLnetions arises through its action and reaction on its world, but the, integrity of the whole remains a reality, the primiary reality, from first to last. In much the same way (though profoundly different in kind) a plant does not cease to be a whole after it has become differentiated into trunk, branches, leaves, and fruit. What we have later in the fulfilment of mind is the</page><page sequence="7">ANTHROPOAMORPHIS-M AND TRUTH. 191 samne unity of life as we have earlier, and the same interpenetra- tion of the processes constituting its life. In actual fact we never lose sight of, or ignore, this solid integrity of the nmind's life. What I wish to urge is that we have no ground for losing. siaht of it in the interests of theory, but every g,round for insisting on it and recurring to it, if we are to assign each operation of mind to its appropriate place in tlhe context of experience. The singleness of mind is present and omni-- present in all its operations; the slightest variation of conscious life, be it even a sensation, reverberates throughout its whole being, modifying and sustaining its course of development and relation to its world. Its unity is manifested mnost prominently, though not exclusively, in the concentration of its energy, now in one specific direction, now in another,-a concentration whieh takes, amongst other ways, the form of what we call attenition. With its singleness of being it faces the real world around it, and forces itself into living association with other beings, and by so doing grows to the fullness of its mental stature. The surrounding world of beings evokes its energy of self- maintenaince and self-fulfilmnent. It does not exist for them nor they for it; they all co-exist, so far as they, too, have individuality, as single realities in a world of reals. It measures their inidividuality by its own, and, as certain philosophers maintain, arranges the reality of inidividuals as. a scale of beings occupying different degrees of reality. Doubtless other real beings, especially if conscious, do th&amp; same, and also miieasure and scale up the real beings different from themselves. The course of the nmind's development may fairly be described, relatively to its initial starting-point in timne and place, as a process of discovery, a discovery of what its own nature contains, and, as the correlate of this, a discovery of the significance of the other beings in relation to which it lives and moves and has its own being. This process of discovery is, what we call experience in its most general sense. Experience- is thus always double-sided; we grow into our world, our-</page><page sequence="8">192 J. B. BAILLIE. world becomes articulate in its detailed reality as we proceed. We do not make the reality of other things aniy more than we make our own; we find and become conscious of both in fulfilling the energy of our own mind. We do not break down the distinction between our reality and that of other beings as we proceed; we establish both by the process of becoming aware of both. Neither gives way to the other, neither strictly depends on the other; they are inter-dependent. We never face other beings with one of the functions of our mind; we face other reality with our whole mind, and we estimate it in terms of our whole nature, from the first stage to the last in the career of our experience; and one being differs fromil another accordiing to the call it makes on our whole being, and the response our whole being makes to it. In the course of our development, and as the result of an indefinite variety of activities conscious and sub-conscious, specific functionis of the mind arrange and assume a definite place in the economy of our mental life: perception, menmory, imagination, emotion, conscious striving. We come to be dis- tinctly aware of them and to rely on themn and operate with them. Some emerge into clearness early, some later in our mental history. Instead of the first stage of quasi- undifferentiated mental unity, we have later a coinplex and articulate arrangement of mental functions in and through which the mind operates. These arise through the successive and successful efforts of the mind to retain its hold on its world, and its place in it; and so to fulfil its being. Each and all have reference to reality in some form or other, and no one exclusively. On this interpretation, the pursuit and the attainme:nt of articulately conceived systematic truth by the intellect is a single, a distinctive, but not the exclusive, and not necessarily the hiahest, channiel through which the individual mind fulfils its proper nature. This deliberate search for intellectual truth, moreover, is controlled by the same fundamental conditions as</page><page sequence="9">ANTHROPO.MORPHI SM AND T'RUTH. 1-9) direct and determine the mind's activity in every other essential direction. In each and all the concrete inidividual is endeavouringr at once to fulfil its being to the utterniiost, aind to become consciously alive to the world of beings wlich co-exist wvith itself; and these two processes are but aspects of its self-mainteinance.* No one direction of the mind's life can be a suibstitute for, or supersede even in importance, anotlher, any miiore than in a Ihigh organism one organ can really take the place of another organ. Perception does niot make senisation any the less necessary; both are qualitatively distinct from memory and from judginent, as these are froimi each other; while, agrain, scientific, or systematic, knowledge is as different a level of mental energy from all of those iiientioned as it is from the activity of the moral life, of art, or of religion. By each of these, and by the different degrees of each kind of activity, the individual mind attains a different level of being, acts and reacts upon its world in a new way, fulfils a distinct mode of its life, and thereby establishies its own existence, in the face of a ceaselessly varyilng realimi of objects. No one of the directions assumed by the energy of the human mind is less or more of a purely humian activity than another; and none carries the human mind beyond tlle ainbit of its own sphere of existence, since all subserve the fulfilment of its beinig as a livilng individuality. If religion aind art, if morality anid technical adaptation to nature, are essentially modes of human life, forms of its expression, science and the pursuit of intellectual truth are equally so, and Ino imlore than particular manifestations of the mental energy of humani beings or rather of a restricted number of individuals. And, if * In that sense scientific knowledge is certainly "instrumental," as it has been held,-a neans, that is to say, to self-fulfilment. It is obviously not merely instrumental in the interests of " practice" ; for practice itself is in the same way instrumental to the self-fulfilment of the individual mind. Both, in short, are directly instrumental to complete individuality, and only indirectly to each other. So of art, morality, and religion. N</page><page sequence="10">194 J. B. BAILLIE. mnemory, perceptioni, and imagination are but ways by which we apprehend the real so as to conserve the stability and uinity of our individual minds, conceptual activity, judomient aind inference perform a similar function in precisely the sanme interest. This view of human experienice in general and of knowledge in particular is what seemns best described as Anthropomorphism. The term is sometimes applied in a narrow sense, to refer to certain ways of ascribing literally to non-human kinds of reality qualities wbtich are exclusively human.* Properly understood, however, this is only a subordinate meaning of the term. In essence it means sirnply the point of view of humanity at its best, the way in which a human life, within- the peculiar limitations and specific conditions of its existence, consciously arranges its world in terms of its own perspective, and in so doing at once fulfils its own nature and adjusts itself to the indefinitely complex realm of beings with which it finds its existence associated. Every type of being in the real world is constituted by its own peculiar laws, and maintains itself in terms of these laws. Man has a type of his own, and secures his place by fulfilling the laws of his special form of being, whether those laws are physical, * This is often described as a peculiar tendency of the primitive mind. But it is by no means confined to the primitive intelligence. The difference between the uncultivated and the cultivated mind does not consist in the former being anthropomorphic in the narrow sense, while the latter eschews anthropomorphism. Both may be anthropomorphic in the same sense ; the difference between the two consisting in the sort of human qualities ascribed to non-human objects. Thus, the primitive mind will ascribe human emotions -anger, pleasure, etc.-to external beings, whether natural or non-natural; the " maturer " mind will ascribe human ideas-conceptions, volitions-to non-human beings. Scientists and philosophers alike show this tendenicy. Why the primitive attitude should be rejected with contempt, and the attitude of the more developed mind treated with profound respect, is not evident, except to those who prefer to ascribe to non-human realities human thoughts rather than human emotions, and who imagine that a later generation must necessarily be wiser than the earlier.</page><page sequence="11">ANTHROPOMORPHISM AND TRUTH. 195 imoral, Eesthetic, or intellectual matters not; the issue of his activity is the maintenance of hlis individual being by the fulfilment of his type of existence. We are not concerned here to show how this conception enables us to interpret the significance of all the modes of this life. We are mnore especially interested in indicating its bearing on the problem of knowledge. We shall not deal with all the forms of knowledge, but only with those which present the greatest difficulty-scientific procedure through conception, judgment and inference, by which intellectual truth in the usuial sense is obtained. In the case, e.g., of sensation and perceptioni, which are also channels of knowledge, it is fairly easy to show that these futnctions of the individual mind are rooted in the peculiar psycho-physical conditions of human individuality, and are constituted by the peculiar laws of man's specific organisation. The essentially human character of knowledge at these levels of man's life may be considered beyond dispute. The same is true of memory or, again, of the imaginative grasp of ideals of knowledge. Let us, therefore, confine attention to the harder case of conceptual activity, and the higher intellectual " truith," with which indeed most theories of knowledge exclusively deal, and in reference to which the claim that truth is " trani- scendent," "objective," " independent," is currenitly made. I. There is nothing magical in the form or the procedure of intellectual activity that we should be disposed to credit it with the power to carry us beyond the conditions or limitations of the human mind. The conceptions with which mature intellectual activity, e.g., science, deals, are the outcome of and display the abstract character possessed by mere intellect as a specialised function of mind. They are literally t-he expres- sion of this abstract function. The intellect does not find them ready made and waitilng to be apprehended or picked up N 2</page><page sequence="12">196 J. B. BAILLIE. by the initellect. Nor are they by chance the convenient nmaterial suiitable to be handled by the abstract activity of the intellect. We often treat them in this way, it is true; but that is because reflection upon the wlhole procedure of the initellect is an after-thought; and, when undertaken, we seem to have a great variety of conceptionis with fixed characters on the one hand, and a uniform power which deals with them on the other. What more natural than that in such circumstances we should fancy the conceptions to be the ready-made material offered to, or fortunately adapted to, the operation of an abstract intellect ? But, in fact, the intellect is in nature and origin prior to the conceptions with whiclh it deals: these are one and all created by it in the course of its effort to grasp the world in the interests of the uniity of the ininid. The deliberate aim of the intellectual process is to brinig to bear on the variety of objects confronting, the mind the all-pervading unity of the mind's life; or, as we sometimes put it, to bring the variety of objects under the general unity of the mind. Thlis is one of the ways iln which, as we find, the mind mnainitains its initegrity in the face of the world of beings in relation to which it stands. The unity of the mind is the single conistant and uniform priniciple throughout all its experience. The mind may only be aware of it in a vague way at first or it miay assume the character of a pure abstraction, and be looked upon as it was, e.g., by Kant, as but a logical centre of reference. Yet, in. all cases intellectual activity consists in briinging this unity as such into conscious connection with the varied worl(d of objects in the midst of which the mind lives. The plurality of conceptions devised for this end are the outcome of its efforts in this direction. They have the generality of the sinigle unity which they seek to carry out, but also something of the concreteness of the actual objects with which the mnind as a concrete individuality is concerned. They are thus, in a manner, intermediate between the mere unity of the mind, and the complex diversity of things. But</page><page sequence="13">ANTHROPOMORPHISM AND TRUTH. 197 they never leave the regioni of abstraction, since the intellect has only to do with satisfying the mind's g,eneral principle of unity. The intellect thus always stops slhort at the abstract concep- tioii, not because it inight not go further if it chose, but because its function is limited by this purpose fiom the first. Hence, we find, on the one hand, that the conceptionl never professes to give us the full particularity of the concrete object. On the other hand, the intellect endeavours to connect the conceptions as conceptions with one another; for the same demand for unity, which starts the mind's search for conceptions, instigates the mind to unite the conceptions themnselves when they are found. It does this throughl the intellectual processes of inference, of systematisation, or again of establishing a hierarchy of concep- tions, aind perhaps in other ways. The abstractness of the conceptions devised by the in- tellect, and the connection of these with onie another, do not furnish any ground for holding that we go beyond the mere purposes of the finite human mind in intellectual activity. The intellect does not de-anthropomorphise the human mind. Indeed, there seems a transparent paradox in maintaining that a function which is less than the whole mind can carry us beyond the mind altogether. This is so evident from the forms assumed by the language of men, and from the variation in the range of conceptual spani, as I inay call it, from individual to individual, that it would hardly require to be emphasized were it not for the mysterious, almost magical, significance attached by some minds, scientific and philosophical alike, to the mere quality of abstractioul characteristic of the con- ceptions of the intellect. What is true of their abstractness is equally true of theif quality of universality and objectivity. Their universality is ultirnately derivable from, and is determined by the extent to which they reflect, the single unity of the individual mind exercising the function of initellect oni its own behalf. This unity remains the same throughout all the life of mind,</page><page sequence="14">198 J. B. BAILLIE. and if a conception can be devised in which the con- sciousness of this unity is maintained throughout all change in the content of the object grasped by the conception, that conception assumes the character of being universal. The assumption is that the conception will remain what it is as long as the unity of the mind subsists, and that means always. Social intercourse helps to confirm this quality by bringing out that the conception in question reflects the unity of life not merely of one individual mind buit of a ntumber, large or small, of other minds equally individual in their life.* The exact number of individuals holding such intercourse is irrelevant to the universality: two may be sufficient for certain kinlds of conceptions; a hundred will strengthen the claim to universality in other cases. But social intercourse does no more in any case than confirm or emphasize the universality: it cannot create the universality in default of the operation of the individual minds who affirm it.t The universality may be so indubitably a quality of the conceptions in certain cases that we find it said, for example, that certain conceptions hold " for all mankind," are confirmed by the " universal experience of humanity," are valid " for consciousness in general." Such expressions are obviously mere hyperbole; nio one imagines that all mankind are really aware of these conceptions; no one has ever tested all the individuals in humanity to see if each and every one holds the conceptions in question. All that is really meant is that the conceptions so described are such that they seenm bound up with thie very unity of the individual mind, if it is to mnaintain itself at all. When conceptions have this quality, it is easy to see how they may * Hence the reciprocal relations of social intercourse and universality of thoughts: social intercourse secures, to some extent, the ratio cognoscendi of universality of thoughts, the latter being, to a like extent, the ratio essendi of social life. t In point of fact, the highest forms of intellectual universality are not held to be dependent for their worth on social intercourse. Indeed, socialisation of ideas is in inverse ratio to their intellectual universality and abstraction.</page><page sequence="15">ANTHtROPOMORPHISM AND TRCUTH. 199 come to be considered outside the lmind altogethei- or inde- pendent of the individulal nmind, aind hieince to give rise to the illusion that intelleetual activity workingO with these conceptions carries us ouitside the limlits of human mentality. A con- ceptioni which is held to be true at all times and for all seems to lhave a being of its own whether any individual holds it explicitly or not: just as we are apt to suppose that a social institution which remaiins a permanent part of the life of a society has a beillg of its own independently of the individuals who successively or periodically emiibody its purpose and then pass away. Such a view is a usefuil mnethod of conveying vividly the signiificance of the quality of universality; as a statemenit of actual fact it is a transparent absurdlity. For it takes the quality of universality wlhich is derived from the more ultimate fact of the unity of an individual m-lind to be a reason for separating the conception from the individual mind altogether. Both the coniception anid its quality as universal lhave the samne source in the individual mind, and have neither being inor life apart from it. As well might a child disown all parentage and all continuity with its past whein it has come to mnaturity, after the manner of the high priests of Israel who claimed to have neither father nor mother when once they had devoted themselves to the service of Jehovah in the Temple. In the same wvay the quality of " objectivity" possessed by conceptions can be shown to have its source in the operations of the inidividual human mind. Coniceptionis are objective in the sense, and only in the sense, that they express the mind's sense of unity in dealing with the objects confronting it. It is the functioni of thought, as we have said, to keep the mind's sense of ulnity secure in the face of the variety ot the world of objects. When this purpose is successfully fulfilled, tlle conceptions do not change, any more than the unity of the mind changes. The realm of objects is from the first as real and as enduring as the being of the inadividual mind. Our intellectual knowledge does</page><page sequence="16">200 J. B. BAILLIE. not alter the nature of t1hings, and tlhings are quite inlifferent themselves to our intellectual operations. But, once concep- tions are obtained, it is a convenient and perhaps a natural form of mietonymy to ascribe to conceptions the quality of the objective world with which they deal, or again to ascribe to objects themselves the conceptions which the intellect has devised to enable the minid to handle the world of objects. This is convenient to emphasise the significance of the result obtained by intellectual activity, viz., that the mind has secured its unity in the inidst of the real world; it is onily objectionable if taken as literal fact. We tllen distturb the wlhole situation; we regard the conceptions as themselves objects, and thus inde- pendenit of the minid as objects in fact are. Such is the naive attitude of the receilt revival of medireval realism. It is not putting the positioni too strongly to say that if conceptions were really objects they would not be objective at all; for they would not be mental functions, which they are; they would no longer refer to objects, they would be the objects themselves. Yet, it is in their reference to the objects that their objectivity consists. It is the reactionl upon our thought of the language in which conceptions are clothed, coupled with inadequate analysis of the situation, which has led many minds, and most of us at one time or another, to treat the objectivity characteristic of conceptions as equivalent to the summiiary identification of conceptions with the objects. It is somnetimes held that the successful corroboration by the objective world of certain conceptual processes and results is an unanswerable argument in favour of the trans-human quality ascribed to thought. If we can predict the course of nature with invariable accuracy, surely, it is said, our thoughts cannot be merely our own as human beings; they must be an expression for the nature of independent things themselves. This is a familiar proposition, and the illuistrations usually given are drawn from stellar and planetary mechanics and applied physics or, again, chemistry, sonmetimes also from pure mathematics.</page><page sequence="17">ANTHROPOMORPHISMi AND TRUTH. 201 Setting aside the fact that the proposition does not hold of conceptions in all the sciences, and setting aside also the fact that the succ(ss means no more in some cases than that scientists have agreed mainly as the result of social intercourse, there is even in the most approved cases of such success nothing to justify the assertion that thought liberates us from the limits of the human individual mind. What is really implied is that our whole mind is so constituted as to be an integral component of the world of tlhings with which its being is associated. Our mind, as a whole, is ilnterwoven with the very texture of the real world,-fitted, so to say, to the environ- ment of the rest of reality; and, if it but fulfils, in its own oider and according to its own conditions, the laws of its own being, the issue will conifirm and establish this conigruence withi the world. It is ilot that the intellect, and the intellect aloine, gives us the true nature of the independent world of things; but that the individual mind is from the start and all throug,h its history a substantive constituent of the real. Its one purpose is to fulfil itself, and its detailed operations contribute to this one end. The so-called success of the intellectual process in particular corroborates this primordial character of the life of mind. It is not, therefore, that the intellect alone finds the whole truth about the world, but that our mind as a whole enables the intellect to brinig out the essential congruenice between the mind and the real. It is the mind working with its whole eiiergy throug,h the channel of intellectual activity which makes possible the successful operations of the intellect in dealing with the world. The intellect merely brings out explicitly in its owin wvay what was implicit all the while-the congruence of the whole mind with the real in the nmidst of which it lives an(l moves and has its being.* * To begin with, this congruence is, in a sense, a postulate, as we so often say. It is not, however, a postulate for the mind, it is only a postulate for the specific operation of the intellect. The mind, as a whole, no more doubts or questions or even "assumes" that it has a place amongst real</page><page sequence="18">202 J. B. BAILLIE. So far we have considlered the claims of the ilntellect to transcenid hiuman limitations by an analysis of the conceptual as stich and at its best. The same result is even lmaor-e evident when- we bear in miinid that the creation or dliscovery of the&amp; conceptionis anid their connectionis, by which the intellect appre- hends the world, always inivolves an effort of mnind, experimeint, trial, and error. The conceptionis and conceptual connections are not given to the intellect ready made; they are deliberately designed, and are only found after a severe intellectual struggle, in the course of which they are formed and reformed, proposed and rejected. The history of science and of philosophy is strewn with the wrecks of expeditions in the seas of thought. All conceptions are at the start nothing more than tentative efforts beings, than trees or birds; and it no more " postulates " its congruence. with other real beings than it postulates their congruence with itself. A postulate is only made by a partial function in an interest going beyond itself; it always inmplies an end beyond itself which is presupposed before it sets out to confirm the reality of the end. The mind has no end beyond itself that it can seek ; it seeks simply to fulfil itself. But a specialised function like the intellect, an abstraction from the whole life of mind, must make the assumption that, in spite of being an abstrac- tion, it will yet be able to attain in its own way and to express the fundamental nature of the life of mind which it partially embodies. The success of its procedure confirms openly the assumption it has made at the outset, and explicitly reinstates in a special way the fundamental character of the mind's life. Such a confirmation is often regarded as a kind of wonder, or surprise, as if the mind should be, as it were, grateful to the intellect for having done so much on the mind's behalf. Yet, the whole process is such an obvious circle that there is no more place for wonder or surprise than in the resolution of a child's puzzle. The intellect is in the control of the mind all the while, and is brought back to its starting point, as it must be, when its operation is completed, for the starting point is its guiding assumption tbroughout all its procedure, directing and limiting its course of operation. This is seen witlhout difficulty, if we merely note that the intellect is always selective ill its operation,-a selection which is guided by an end in relation to which the selection is made. When we say, therefore, that the intellect grasps the nature of the real, we should observe that this is at best only a partial statement even of the operation of the intellect. The successful result of the operation of the intellect has always a double-sided significance; it conveys what the real is in relation to the mind, as interpreted by</page><page sequence="19">ANTHROPO-MORPHISM AND TRUTH. 203 of the mind to establish a unity amoing,st things. The progress of science finds its growing point in sluggrested hypotheses. No one would dream of regarding the embryonic staces of true knowledge as other than phases in the life, of the humiian mind. How, then, can any one maintain, when these stages have arrived at a point in their developinent which satisfies the mind, produces general acceptance, and enables it to maintain itself in relation to its world, that suddenly the thoughts thus secured cease altogether to be our own and become non-human or impersonal in character ? If tentative hypotheses do not give us the very "nature of things," why should a successful hypothesis do so ? intellect, it also conveys what the mind is in relation to the real world. It must do both at once, because it is a manifestation of the life of mnind as one real being amongst other real beings. It is because we so often ignore the one side of this result, and lay exclusive emphasis on the grasp of the independent real object achieved by the intellect that we treat the intellect as a revelation of the independent object, and the truth obtained as consequently independent of our own minds. Such a one-sided view is sure to distort the actual situation, for it leads us to ignore the vital connection of the intellect with the whole life of mind. If we could imagine a flower thinking about the botanist as the botanist thinks about the flower, we might have similarly one-sided misinterpre- tations of the significance of the results arrived at by the plant intelli- gence. The plant's thoughts would surely be a mere manifestation of its life, however accurately in its process it succeeded in diagnosing the being of the botanist; and its thoughts would emphatically not be those of the botanist, no matter how accurate they were to the plant itself. And so generally ; if other orders of beings, some of which palpably have intelligence, were to think about their world,-the things with which they are confronted,-their thoughts would, in every case, be the expression of their own specific intelligence, and would remain constant for them because accurately embodying the laws of their own being. It is hardly imaginable that the thoughts of all the different orders of beings would be the same, or that the "nature of things" would be completely revealed by each type of thought. In a word, Heraclitus' criticism of the popular religious views of his time has but to be generalised to see the inadmissibility of attributing to the specific thoughts of human intelligence a capacity to convey the nature of things in a manner which, however successful, implies that because thought is true it is therefore impersonal.</page><page sequence="20">204 J. B. BAILLIE. We can often go a long way with an inaccurate hypothesis; we can prophesy by it, to a certain externt, anid it bears this test of success; nevertheless we are led to give it up, and to describe it as merely a human conjecture. Since it is by a continuation of the same activity of the mind that an inaccurate becomes an accurate hypothesis, it is surely impossible to debumanise the hypotlhesis once it becomes finally established. Is the only quality of thought which remains hunman to be the capacity to make mistakes, and shall we deny ourselves the right to call true thouoht human just because it is true ? This seems neither justified nor intel- ligible. But when we look at the process of thought as it actually takes place, we find that intellectual activity is never in fact purely intellectual activity at all. We never think in an abstract medium of puire intellect, not even in the most abstract of all sciences. We start from, and constantly draw upon, the resouirces and deliverances of our percepttual experi- ence. We repeatedly substantiate our thinking by linking its conclusions with perceptual facts, and sometirnes we call this procedure (paradoxical as it sounds) the verification of our thoughts. And we invariably make use of the niedium of perceptual experience to give body, shape, and form to the whole process of thinking, for there is no continuous thinking possible without written or spoken language, which belongs wholly to the region of perceptual experience. Now, perception is not merely inseparable from our specifically human mind, it is not even separable from our peculiarly constituted nervous system. When we proceed to think about things, the operation of thinking is instigated in the first instance by the mode in which things are perceived. Perception sets the task, and furnishes the character which the things possess about which we think. No thinking can dispense witlh its own facts or leave the facts behind. And since these are constituted by the special nature of human perception, our thinking is held</page><page sequence="21">AN lH1ROPOMORPHISM AND TRUTH. 205 captive by, and is beyond all hope of escape fromu, the limits of the human mind. This point has been so often emphasised, that it requires no more than a passing remark. What is so curious is that the use of language ill which to convey thoughts should ever have created the illusion that our thought can traniscend the human mind. It seems to be supposed because language is "outside," or a symbol, and the form of the symbol is irrelevant, that therefore thoughlt is indepenideint of all huiman conditions. Yet, it is precisely the symbol which compels thought to keep in touch with the actual human mind, which always lives as a concrete whole; or, conversely, it is precisely because thought canniot lose touch with the concrete mnind that it must use a symbol. The symbol, be it ever so slight, e.y., a mere signi, holds thought in chains to the coniditions and laws of perception, without which the mind would lose its living contact with its actual world. The insignificanice, the very perceptual abstractness of the symbol, just corresponds to the abstractness of the conceptual activity; indeed, onily suich a symbol would be adequate to the quality of the conception. Hence it is that the more abstract the conceptual activity, the more the language used becomes a mere character or sign: numbers, e.g., are conveyed by mere lines in space, straight or curved or otherwise arranged. Anid the less abstract the concep- tion, the more does the symbol conveying it have a greater perceptual significance, sometimes even appealing to different senses. Again, it is important to note that contradiction, wlicih is so characteristic of thought, is the direct consequence of the abstract nature of its procedure as a specialized operation of mind, and confirnms the essentially human quality of its process and its results. Contradiction has always beenl the main source of uneasiness in the intellectual conscience, goading its waking life with the remorse of doubt, and troubling the dreams of the most accomplished builder of systems. Somie have treated it as a</page><page sequence="22">206 J. B. BAILLIE. kind of thorn in the fleslh, others have used it to make a crown of thorns for the brow of intellectual freedom. And indeed the fact of contradiction is at onice the puzzle and the paradox of intellectual activity; a puzzle because it is difficult to see why the intellect should ever contradict itself; a paradox because the creation of a contradiction is the work of thought as much as the resolution of it. No other phase of mental life is subject to this condition; perception, emotioin, volition, inagination, memory, have no share in it; their deliverances are, final for the mind. If these deliverances are found to contain contradictions it is not for the functions themnselves that the contradiction exists, but for the intellect which reviews or criticises their results. So close is contradiction bound uip witlh intellectual activity that a certain familiar form of specuilationi regards contradiction as the life-principle of thought itself and the clue to its development of the nature of truth. Contradiction, it is said, e.g., by Bradley, arises when a conception is pushed to the end of its meaning; and every conception, it is held, will prove contradictory if it is pushed to its extrenie point; hence thought activity essentially tends to contradiction. Such a contention at once creates suspicion and distrust, for surely the initial mistake may lie just in pushing the conception too far. Why go to extremes in thinking, any more than in any other form of experience? By hypothesis we are not bound to do so, for, if thought be not pressed to the breaking point, it will not be contradictory, and will still be thought. Thus, in making contradiction the essence of thought, we have no right to console ourselves "-ith the reflection that we are making a virtue of a necessity, for we are really making a virtue of a blunder. And the things about which we reflect are transparently indifferent to the contradictions into which we fall when we thinik about them- they remain in solid and stolid security, maintaining their full reality, regardless of the conceptual tangle into which our minds may have fallen. Indeed, it is partly because they maintain</page><page sequence="23">ANTHROPOMORPHISMi AND TRUTIH. 207 their concrete integrity that ouir minds are checked in the course of their intellectual procedure. The source of contradiction is to be traced to the general character of intellectual activity. It arises from the demand for complete mental unity oni the one hand, and on the other from the tentative selective efforts of the intellect to meet this demand through a variety of conceptions. The unity of the mind is, as we have seen, the presupposition and the consumma- tion of intellectual activity, and without its presence in the process of the intellect no contradiction would arise. Variety of conception there must be, sinice a plurality of real things has to be unified. When the unity of the mind is not satisfied by a particular conception or a connection of conceptions, contradiction appears. It is, thus, always a transitional characteristic of intellectual procedure; and, as we find, it varies in kind from individual to individual, and in degree according to the nature of the conception involved. Thus, what seems contradictory to one mind seems not always contra- dictory to another, as we see constantly verified in the course of debate, especially on fundamental questions; and some con- ceptions are found to be partially contradictory, others wholly so, by the same mind. The mental grasp of one individual differs from another, and one individual tllus neither feels nor sees a contradiction, i.e., his iidind's unity is satisfied, in a relation of conceptions which seems to another riddled with contradiction, i.e., giving no mental security. When we use such expressions as a " self-contradictory coniception," or connec- tion of conceptions, and again such terms as " absolutely contradictory," " inherently contradictory," and the like, what we mean is that, with the best intellectual effort which we anid others, who agree with us, can make, no sense of mental unity can be arrived at by the conceptions in question. In a word, contradiction is nothing more than the condition in which the intellect fails to satisfy the mind's demand for com plete unity in the special case of the conceptions or</page><page sequence="24">208 J. B BAILLIE. coninection of conceptions created by the activity of the intellect. Contradictioins are tlhus, in. this sense, alw-ays created by the intellect itself, as Kant pointed out iin the case of onie form of intellectual activity in particular, and it is just becauise they are so created that the intellect can always remiiove them, either by retracing its steps or by advancing further. Henice it is useless to describe conceptions, or thoughts in general, as inherently contradictory; coinceptions have no being except as expressiolns of inFtellectual activity, aind thought removes contraclictions, as well as gives lrise to them. But for the tentative, selective, piece-meal procedure of thinking, i.e., its human character, conitradiction would not arise at all. It is neither a virtue of thought nor a disease; it is in the long run due to the self-criticism by the mind of its own thought, and reveals tlhe negative conitrol exercised by the milnd over the ftindamentally abstract nature of the intellectual activity which seeks to work in isolation fromn the rest of the lite of mind.* II. One of the mllost familiar admissions made regarding intellectual activity is that it is "unable to explain every- thling," that "it lhas its limits." And by this is meant not that the individual mind making the admission is incapable of advancing further, but that the intellect itself will not allow the mnind to go beyond a certain point in dealing with the real world. This is not discovered anid stated simply as a, * It only differs in form and not as a mental operation from the check exerted by the solid integrity of the mind over all the specialised functions of its life. The analogue of contradiction in the sphere of feelinig is the sense of pain arising from a misdirected course puirsued by the mind in its uniform career towards satisfaction or fulfilment ; while, again, in the case of striving or volition we similarly find the sense of failure or defeat arisinig from the pursuit of an end futile in itself or hostile to the supreme purpose of mental life-a sense of failure which appears in such different forms as mistaken effort oIr remorse of conscience.</page><page sequence="25">ANTHROPOMIORPHTSM AND TR1UTH. 209 practical experience; we find it time after timne erected into a genieral or philosophical tenet. We have but to recall the long-standing contrast and quiarrel between faith and intellect in Western thought, the sceptical criticism of the intellect by Huime, the theory of Kant, and more recently the vigorous re-assertion of the same doctrine by Mr. Bradley, to find ample proof of the existence of this conviction. And it is a remark- able confirmation of the same contention that those who either do not admit it or who seem to maintain the self-sufficiency of thought do so only by blendino thought with other and con- sciously different functions of the life of the mind. Thus, Spinoza, in spite of his intentional and initial pure intellectualism, reaches true reality not by the intellect alone but by intellec- tual love. Hegel at once openly confesses the impotency of conceptual procedure to deal with the teeming detail of nature and history, and yet seeks by a kind of totr de force to establish a quasi-logical connection between thoughlt at its highest and nature in general,-an attempt which acquires whatever value it has from his sheer identification of intellectual activity with the entire self-conscious life of the human inind. In a work of a more recent date we find a thinker of like tendencies (Mr. Bosanquet) miaking the significant remark, apparently with- out any consciousness of its far-reaching importance for his whole view of thought, that " it is the strict and fundamental truth that love is the mainspring of logic." These examples are quoted merely to give ani indirect proof of the contention put forward frankly by the other thinkers above referred to. Such a position was for longo a source of grave trouble to myself, for I could nieither adimiit the conitenition that the intellect cannot explain everything nor accept the philosophical theories put forward on its behalf, nor fimid complete satis- faction in the way of thought adopted by those who maintained or sought to maintain the opposite view. It seemed impossible to understand how the intellect could at once be taken as the only avenue to the intelligible, i.e., mientally satisfying ,;</page><page sequence="26">210 J. B. BAILLIE. apprehension of the real, and yet to lhold that it was coinpelled to leave over a residuum of the real as beyond its grasp. The difficulty was only increased by recognising that it seemed to be by the intellect itself that this limitation of its function was discovered and formulated. How could the intellect miiaintain or admit its own insolvency and yet try to carry on its proper business ? When, however, one observes that the intellect is from the first and in principle a mental operatioti consciously distinguished fromn, anld even set apart by, the mind itself, in contrast to the other functions of the mind's life (more particularly the functions of feeling and striving), the difficulty in question disappears. For, then, it follows at once that it cannot be expected to get the whole of the real world into its net, since it starts by being only a partial expres- sion of the full reality of the mind's life.* It does not reveal the whole nature of mind; and, therefore, the miiind cannot be wholly satisfied with its deliverances, however rich and com- plete in their own order these deliverances of the intellect may be. The mind has other f unctions and other ways of approachinig the real world, and no intellectual activity can be a substitute for these.t It is thus not because the intellect is incompetent to do its own work that it fails; it is because the mind in its entirety cannot be satisfied in its relation to reality by the exercise of only one of its own functions. The mlind is aware that the real contains more than the intellect can supply, because the mind is related to the real through all its functions and finds the real responding and co-responding to the other * The limitation of thought in its relation to the real rests on, and is due to, the initial separation of thought from other functions of the mind. t The real makes an appeal to the emotions of the mind as well as to thought, to the will as well as to the emotions. It is this sphere of the real which thought can neither touch nior thiDk away, which bars the process of thought and limits its range of operation. It is, indeed, a residuum for thought, but it is an integral part of the nature of the real for mind in its concrete ftullness.</page><page sequence="27">ANT1IMOPOMORPHISM AND TRUTH. 211 demilands muade upon it by the minid. The limitation of the range of the intellect does not arise because the intellect falls into ceontradiction when it tries too much, as Kant maintained, nor because thought is relational, as Bradley puts it; It seemiis absurd to condemn thought for trying to do too inuch, sinice it can niever exercise its activity too far; the more it does in fact the better the result intellectually, and the intellect can never trespass beyond the sphere of intellect. It seems equally luistaken to condemn thought because it is relational, if it canniot but be relational. The restricted range of the activity of thought is determined not by thought itself, but by the more concrete reality of the mind's whole life. The fulfilmnent of this can alonie bring satisfaction; and, while the intellect can mnalke its own contribtution to this satisfaction, the whole mind can never find that contributio:n sufficient for all its needs. Whatever truth the intellect attains, therefore, it must always be less thani wlhat meets the mind's requirements; and if we take the full satisfaction of the mind to be the only adequate expression for the " whole truth " regarding the minid's coInscious relationi to its world, then the special truth achieved by the intellect cani never be the " whole truth " required. And if the "intelligibility " of the world is only reached when the mind is fully satisfied, then intelligibility involves something more than the results, howvever great, of intellectual activity. The limilita- tion of tlhought is thus not a defect of the intellect, buit imierely a specialisation of the life of mind. Anid just because it is so limited by anid for human ends, its process and its results have all the more a human value. They can n?,ver be less than mentally satisfying, and they can never be more than this; and thus they can never overthrow nor imperil the imajor ends that make for and secure humiian satisfaction .* * It is a mistake in principle to describe this result as the failure of thought to grasp the real; and misleading to employ such an expression as that of Lotze, that " reality is richer than thought." Thought does o 2</page><page sequence="28">212 J. B. BAILLIE. The miind is always iiistinietively alive to the limited possibilities of. satisfaction to be achieved through thinking, and seeks through other and distinctive chaninels to supplement the inadequacy of thought to supply entire satisfactioin. It approaches the real by the avenue of emotion as well as by that of volition, and endeavours to secure in its relation to the real the highest satisfaction that these funietions alone can supply. The concentration of the integrity of its life into these channels constitutes the search for beauty oni the onie hand and for goodness oIn the other. Just as the highest fUlfilmnent of its life throuigh the function of thouaht brings what we call (intellectual) truth, so the conisummation of the minid's possibilities of emotioni issues in the realisation of beauty, and the achievement of the wvork of volition is the attainmenit of goodness. The convenitional difference of the terms employed to describe the main avenues of the self-fulfilment of the mind tends to obscure their essential coinnection with one another. They are connected in their source and connected in their finial pturpose. They emanate from the one integral life of minid seeking at all costs not fail of its own purpose, nor does it fail to colntribute its own meed of satisfaction to the mind. In the face of the extraordinary achievements of scientific procedure, anid, we may say, also of philosophical reflection, it seems a travesty of the facts to speak of the failure of thought. Moreover, the failure of thought would, in the long run, imean the failure of the mind to be itself or to attain its end; and it is difficult to attach any meaning to that expression, since the mind cannot bring about its own failure, and no other reality is in a position to performi that office oni its behalf. It is, again, misleading to say that " reality is richer" than thought; for thought always enriches reality by lighting up for miind the meaning of things; the real would be infinitely- poorer by the absence of thought. And, indeed (if it be possible at all to com- pare thoughts and things in this way), thought, even as thought, is much more importanit and nmore valuable for mind than many forms of the real. Just as the greatest criminal is a higher being thani a beast of prey, so the poorest thought of a mind is a finer product of creation than the beetling cliffs or the inmmeasurable desert spaces of the earth. What such a questionAle expression means is not strictly that reality is richer than thought, but that the mind is richer in its life than the processes of thought alone.</page><page sequence="29">ANTHROPOMORPHISM AND TRUTH. 213 and by all its opelrationis to imiainitaini itself through developina its powers to meet the call of the real world. Anid, on the other hand, each of themii finids its ultimate goal in the contribution it makes to full satisfaction of the wlhole mind's life, and to this they are subordinate, and by this the limit, the range of operation of each, is determined. Hence if we emphasize their community of interest and purpose, we miiay quite correctly regard them as identical, and this is often done even by those who have a specialised concern for the pursuit of oinly one of them. The poet says, " Truth is beauty: beauty truth. This is all we know on earth and all we need to know." The philosopher (Mr. Bradley) on the otber hand says that irn his maturer years he finds himself " taking more and more as literal fact what I used inl my youth to admire and love as poetry." When, however, we do not emphasize this community of aim, and only then, we can regrard these avenues towards mental satisfaction as different, each pursuing its own course in termlis of its owni laws and conditions.* Each is pursued in abstraction from the others, because only by so doing can the finite mind concentrate its energies. It concentrates in order to achieve, and to get the uttnmost in one direction it must, at least temporarily, isolate one channel from the others. We find this in the case of thought; it holds equally in the case of emotion and of volition. Each is abstract by itself, but one abstraction is as much justified and as inevitable as the other. Were it not for the abstraction of thought, we may say, the other abstractions would not be made or required. If the one abstract activity can accomplish its end, so can the others. The attainment of the utmost that emotion and volition can supply is necessary to * But if we lose sight altogether of their inherent connection, the inevitable result will be the creation of conflicts between their aims. And this we find constantly happens in actual experience: truth at war with goodness, goodness at war with beauty. In such conflicts we shall find at once somue of the greatest tragedies of experience and the greatest colmiedies.</page><page sequence="30">214 J. 13.

This consists in the restoration or reinistatemiient, at a hiigher level, of the primordial inltegrity of in id fromn which its beingv as an individLual whole starts, and for the mnainitenance of which th-e enterprise ancd adventure of its experience are unidertaken. This highlest level is a restoration, becauise the primal integrity was broken when the abstraction of fuLnctions from one another took place; it is a reinstatement because the inaintenance of its integrity from first to last is the fiinal purpose of all its oper ations. The equipoise of its being, in the midcst of a chanlginig anid varied world is the essenice of its satisfaction find fulfilment. The demand, therefore, for the miiaxiimiumi of enjoy,ment, or again of good, in the mind's relation to the real is the neces- sary counterstroke to the effort to reach trutlh through the chanlnel of the intellect. And it is importanit to observe that the mind insists on regarding both beauty and goodness as uiniversal and objective, though under the same limitations as conceptions are held to be so. The ascriptioni of beauty- to the real world and, again, the insistence that the world is oni the side of goodness are Ino more metaphors thanl the assertion that conceptions or truths are valid of the real. The universality of a judgment of beauty is as certain as that of a scientific judgment, and as certain because it possesses the same characteristics of universality; it is permanent for the mind that holds it, anid it holds for a plurality of minds. Ini fact if beauty anid good- nless had not these fdatures, so comnmonily ascribed to truth alonle,* it would be impossible, e.g., to give meaninig to time life of the artist, or to justify the muost elemiientary act of nmoral goodness.

That beauty and goodness are so often held to be nmerely subjective or mental states, while truth is considered to be characteristically objective, seems partly due to the fact that in the case of the former the tendency is to think more of the origin and process of achievemnent, ill the case of the latter to pay attention to the result and overlook the process; and partly to the fact that in the former the sensuous elements of human life are more in evidence than in the case of think- ing.* VVhat holds of truth, however, certainly holds in the sanie way of the pursuit of beauty and of goodness; anid, con- versely, if the latter are hunian creations established in the interest of the self-fulfilment of the mind, the like must be maintained of the basis as well as the superstructure of thought. It is because of the abstract character which each of these channels possesses in relation to the other and to the whole of mind, that we find in experience that one of them is exclusively chosen by certain types of mind as the main channel of satis- faction. The choice is a matter of individuality, capacity, and instinctive interest, and no principle can be laid down which shall declare that the choice of one is more essential to the mind than another. For in each case the choice is justified by the fact that the world does bring satisfaction in its own kind to the mind. The suggested emphasis on one at the expense of the other is an unfortunate, but a natural psychical, result of the selection. In consequence, we find the attempt some- times made to subordinate oDe to the other, or even to estab- lish the value of one in terms of the other. Hence the forms of astheticism, intellectualism, and pragmatism in the history of the human nmind. These are at best but misdirections or * On the other hand, when the essential universality of beauty and goodness is emphasized, the tendency is to treat them as containing con- ceptions of a type similar to intellectual conceptions. This is equally mistaken: but, at any rate, it brings into prominence the affinity,between the effort after beauty and goodness and the effort after truth.</page><page sequence="32">216 J. B.

Each indi- vidual suffers fromn the prejudice created by hiis choice; but that is merely of biographical importance and initerest. IIM. The last point I wish to refer to is that intellectual processes are niever merely intellectual. Distiniet as thought, emotion, and strivinog are, as channels towards mental fulfil- ment, both in their course and in their issues, it is remark- able how in actual experience they betray the community of their source in spite of their distinctness. It is as if the integrity of the mind refused to be disintegrated by these abstractions, however firmnly the abstraction tries to keep to its own groove. The whole life of the mind as a unity of intellect, emotion, and striving asserts its sway over them; aiid, indeed, perrneates the separate avenues which it takes to attain completeness. Thus, in the case of intellectual activity strenuousness of effort or striving is a fundamental condition of reaching an intellectual result, though such strenuousness is not in itself an intellectual quality, but a quality of volition in the stricter sense. Intellectually such strenuousness is in- dispensable to thie process, and yet is irrelevanit to the logical value of the result attained. And with this volitional element are bound up many derivative conditions of initellectual success, conditions which we sometimes speak of even as virtues of the initellectual attitude, e.g., those of honesty, truith- fulness, sincerity, seriousness, perseverance, courage, and the like. None of these strictly constitute an intellectual con- ception or arrangemiient of conceptiions; but they most certainly regulate the course of our intellectual activity. In some cases they may effectively determiine the issue of our thinking, e.g., by narrowing the outlook or by arresting thought in the interests of preconceived ideas, relevant or irrelevant. And, at any rate the neglect of these virtues does most certainly alter the value</page><page sequence="33">ANTHRI;OPOMORPHISM AND TRUTH. 217 of the result wthichl we reaclh. Sim-ilarly, the emotional element plays a miiost vital part in the operations of the intellect. The bent of our ilntellect towards a certaini type of inquiry or course of thought is settled, inore than we often willingly admit, by the emotional attitude we take up to the object considered. How, otherwise, can we explain the indifference, and even revulsion, some minds feel towards history, mathematics or meta- physics ? * Surely, if the intellectual activity was in no way affected by emotiolns, individuals should be able to take a continuous intellectual interest in every object alike, though doubtless the degree of attainment would vary with intellectual capability. But this is not what in fact we find. To some minds the intellectual attitude is rendered impossible from the start by anl emotional recoil fromi the object to be thought about. Those matters in which we take a keen intellectual interest miiake, either at the beginining or very quickly, an emotional appeal to the mind amounting in some cases to an intenisity of passioni which will carry even an inferior intellect over the most serious obstacles to undelstanding. We may geineralise Shakespeare's maxim regarding education, and say "No profit is where is no pleasure ta'en; in brief, sir, study what you nmost affect." For, indeed, no mind can long sustain continuity of intellectual activity without the impulsion derived from a strong emotion of curiosity, or without the emotional elevation which is the better and larger part of the reward of unimpeded intellectual effort. The most impersonal scientific mind is far fronm being emotionally colourless; or, if it does becomie indifferent even to the emotional effect of successful achievemnent, it is curious to note how soon either ennui or depression seizes the mind. It has often been remarked that, in philosophical speculation, the most severely abstract and rigorously formal thinkers seenm dominated by a kind of * It is noteworthy that the initial emotional attitude is, in most cases, an index and anticipation of the intellectual capacity to understand.</page><page sequence="34">218 J. I). BAILLIE. faniatical enithuLsiasml for logical order anid dialectical display. Now, this einotional accompaniment of intellectual activity has emphatically nothilng to do with the conistitution of the truth which the intellect seeks to secure. The tr uth is determined simnply and solely by the canons and conditions of intellectual procedure. The emotion pervades the activity, but it does not directly regulate the conduct of the understanding. Yet, so profoundly does it affect the character of intellectual activity that it sometimes seems as if, at least for certain minds, the intellectual process were undertaken to secure a result which should be not mnerely an intellectual satisfaction but an aesthetic or emotional satisfactioni at the sanme time. Everyone with very strong intellectual interest in somlie field of thought must have felt the peculiar thrill which invariably follows the apprehension of an illuminatina principle. Such a thrill is purely aesthetic in its quality, and yet inay seem as imiiportant, sometimes even more important, for the mind than the abstract truth of the principle itself. Similarly, the sense of form is a most inmportant factor in determining the intellectual result. The mere beauty of the arrang,ement of the conceptions involved in a specific sequence of thought gives a satisfaction all its own, and seems worth securing for its own sake. The intellectual labour seenms to find its perfect consummation in the- symmetry of the product of its activity. This holds of scientific thinking in the narrow sense, as any one acquainted with, e.g., mathematical investigation is aware. But it holds as much, anad even more, in philosophy, where the idea of symrnetrically arranged thought plays the part, for certain minds, of a kind of additional canon of intellectual truth. Systems of philosophy, as systems, are the outcome of an aesthetic interest in intellectual procedure. They are the products of the artistic imagination operatinig on the imiaterial provided by the conceptions of the intellect. They are designed to satisfy the a-sthetic sense rather than the purely intellectual attitude, and illustrate by an extreme case the</page><page sequence="35">ANTHIIROPOMOIRPHISM AN) TRUTH. 219 iniseparable connection between emiiotional and intellectual processes of the inind. We need not consider how in the samne way intellect is involved in the fulfilnment of the emotional attitude of the miind, or in that of volition; nor, again, how the esthetic element plays a part in. the achievement of goodness. Analysis would reveal that, in the attainment of the end pursued by each of the abstract operations, the other factors of the mind are present as co-operating inifluLences. But indeed no deep analysis is required to dermionstrate a fact which experience is constantly bringing to light. On the one hand the condemnation of beauty in the name of goodness or of goodness in the namne of beauty, on the other hancd the terin " beauty of holiness," or again the utterance of truth with the perfect grace of literary expression, are famlliliar illustrations of the indissoluble blending in actuial experience of the distinctive attitudes assumed by the human mind in its process of self-fulfilment, however much the attitudes may claim specific independenice of one another. The solid integrity of the whole life of mind will not allow itself to be set aside by any exclusive interest in one of its abstract fuinctions. How- ever much this insistence on its concrete entirety may spell inconsistenicy or hamnper with irrelevance the abstract pro- cedure of each distinctive attitude, apparently the mind as a whole prefers the inconsistency anid the irrelevance to the impoverishment of its life by an over-emuphasis oi1 one of its functions. And some of the more open-miiided of those who have sought supreme satisfaction along, the intellectual channel of the mind's activity frankly admit in the end that their special avenule does not give the whole truth they desire, does not even give the whole truth souglht along that one chiainnel. I recall in this connection the admissionis miiade by the strenu- ously intellectualistic mind of Mr. Bradley that, in the long run, as he paradoxically puts it, " truth cannot become consistently and ultimately true," that truth is more than consistency and contains more than the criterioin of non-contradiction</page><page sequence="36">2 20 J. 1;. BAILLIE. caln siipply ; that ouri iminds and our feelings imiust, at least in part, determine the conmositioni of the final satisfaction we find in truth, aind indeed that a man's philosophy is in a real sense a matter of personal choice. It is partly because these three attitudes of the mtienital life emanate from the essential integrity of the mind, and partly because in actually fulfilling the demands of any one the others indirectly reveal their presence, that the mind is induced, at any rate, to hope that in the long run the achievements of their several aims will converge or co-operate in the production of a suipreme state of melntal satisfaction. This would restore at the consumnination of thought, of emotion, and of striving, the sense of unity frolmi which their divergenit operations start, and in the interest of which they prosecute their course towards completion. Such a hope is certainly warranted, and the realisation of it is the larger part of the best religious experience. The convergence of these aimos, however, can never be niore than an aspiration for any one of them. Each by itself is burdened with its imperfection, and even at times haunted by defeat, simply because by itself it is abstract anid consciously abstract. The imperfection is expressly admitted in a curious way. It is held, e.g., that for the fulfilment of the purposes of the intellect, as well as those of goodness, "faith" is required. This faith is brought in to give the assurance of final completeiness, which each by itself never seemns to reach. This supplelmlentary faith at once removes or corrects the imperfection due to the abstract procedure of thinking and striving. It is the way in which the mind as a single unity asserts or reaffirms its hold over the abstract aims of thought (and striving), and keeps them in immediate and continuous conitact with the integrity of its life. The faith is not an attitude of the intellect itself (or of volition), but an act of the whole mind. Properly speaking, it does inot meani that in time the intellect will create final satisfactioni for the mind, for it will never do so, no matter how long it operates.</page><page sequence="37">ANTHROPOMORPHISM AND TRUTH. 221 Nor does it meani that the intellect muight ultimately fail unless it were held up or kept going by faith; for the intellect is always attaining success wherever aind whenever it fulfils the conditions of initellectual procedure, and the nmind has never any honest doubt about the value of intellectual activity. This so- called faith is simply the attitude by which the whole mind lays claim to all the achievements of the intellect in the pursuit of its abstract career, gives them their place in the constitution of that supreme satisfaction wherein the mind is fulfilled and on the attainment of which its hopes are set. The faith so exercised is thus the correlative of that hope for final fulfilment to which reference has been made. That it should be found necessary is a complete confirmation of the position maintained throughout this argument, viz., that intellectual activity is an abstract operation of the human nind, and finds its entire signiificance in contributing to the fulfilmelnt of a human individuality. The faith called in to supplement intellectual procedure is meaningless outside the interests and conditions of huLmnanl life. It is irrelevant to the world of things whether orgranic or inorganic. So long as faith is thuis necessary to give significance to the aims of the intellect, there is no escape from tie essentially anthropomorphic character of intellectual procedure, even apart from the con- siderations already adduced to establish the same conclusion. While the various ends pursued by the human mind in its process towards self-discovery or self-fulfilment are thus one and all-truth as well as goodness, and beauty as well as truth-anthropomorphic in origin and realisation, this con- clusion must not be misunderstood. They are, on this account, neither purely subjective nor mere passing shadows on the surface of reality. In achieving these ends of its being the mind is using its utmost powers to secure and maintain its place amidst the world of beings with which it is confronted, and in which its lot is cast-the endless variety of objects which mnake up what we embrace under the terms nature, human nature</page><page sequence="38">222 J. B. BAILLIE. and suipernature. And this supremiie aimn domninates the mind's career fromn first to last. At its earliest stage of development it faces its world as a plastic blut largely undifferentiated unity, adapting itself as well as it can to the incessant challenge made upon it by other beings. At its latest stages it brings out all its resources separately and successively to meet the call of its world, anid establish its unity in relation to its world. In fulfilling these demanids it at once develops its own nature, and establishes its place in the realm of reality. By so doing, it achieves the highest of which its special order of beinig-that of an individual human mind-is capable, and therefore it expresses all that reality in the form of a hurnan mind contains. If we call this supreine result, as we may, the " full truth" of mind, then the mind's entire fulfilment is in veiy literalness a revelation of the real. If we say, as somie do, that in the humiian mind the real world becomes articulately conscious, then we may put the same position in the form that the human mind is a conscious exponent of the nature of reality. But suLch a manner of expression adds nothing to the main cointention, and is apt to be misleading, siince it suggests that the processes of our mental life have a kind of inarticulate embodiment in the non-human domnain of the real whereas my contention is that the processes and their outcome have neither existence nor signiificance beyond the domain of the finite human mind whose peculiar nature they unifold or express. It is enough for us that our place in the world of she real is as well established and as much anl embodiment of the niature of reality as any other being claiming to be real. Our place becomes established when our ends are completely fulfilled, anid by realising our place our ends themselves are shown to be of the essence of reality. By assuming human shape, ultimate reality thereby literally becomes human. And we need not say, with Athaniasius, that this was done in order that we might becoine like the ultimately real. For, in fact, we have neither the capacity nor the desire to be other than that part of ultimate</page><page sequence="39">ANTHROPOMORPHISM AND TRUTH. 223 reality which we embody. To be this fully is to be both human and ultimately real at once. Only with our whole mind can this be accomplished; but with this it is, not as an act of faith but as literal fact, attained.</page></plain_text>
