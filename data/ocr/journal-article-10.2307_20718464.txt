<plain_text><page sequence="1">Insects, Colonies, and Idealization in the Early Americas* ERIC C. BROWN During the famed magical boat ride in Cervantes's Don Quixote, the knight-errant describes to Sancho Panza a means of delineating their passage down a slow moving river, which Quixote has taken for an Atlantic crossing: Listen, Sancho: when the Spaniards, and all those who sail out of C?diz, head out toward the East Indies, one of the things that tells them they've passed over the equatorial line is that all the lice on board the ship suddenly die, to the very last one, and they can't find a single louse anywhere on the boat, not for its weight in gold?so run your hand down your thigh, Sancho, and if you find anything living we'll have settled the whole business, and if you don't, then we've already crossed over. (515) Sancho, of course, turns up an infestation, and concludes that "Either the experiment isn't a good one ... or else we haven't gotten to where your grace said, not by a long shot" (515). While the experiment collapses for Sancho, the construction of Old and New World differences along entomo logical fault lines was a recurrent device in the conquest and travel narra tives of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. And as Diana de Armas Wilson argues in her recent study Cervantes, the Novel, and the New World, literary representations of the Americas were immersed in a complex matrix of Old World expectations and idealizations. Often such representations at once adopted and abandoned various competing discourses?including, especially, the Utopian and the chivalric. On the popular impact of the latter, Wilson stresses, "One and the same genre gave to the conquistadores their delirious dreams of El Dorado, to Spanish cartographers such exotic topo nyms as California' and * Patagonia,' to the Chroniclers of the Indies a 'lying' genre against which to compare their own 'true histories,' to Cer vantes an exhausted genre he could revive and parody, and to Don Quixote an endearing case of bibliomania" (15). The conflux of these various narra tive modes becomes clearer with such literal borrowings as the previous exchange between Quixote and his squire. The knight, for instance, here mimics the report in Gonzalo Fern?ndez de Oviedo's Natural History of the West Indies (1526), describing how "rarely are Christians in the new world bothered by the small pestiferous insects that grow in a man's hair and on his body. Because after we pass the line of the diameter where the compass needle changes from the northeast to the northwest, which is only a short distance beyond the Azores as we continue the voyage to the West, all the</page><page sequence="2">Insects 21 lice on the men's heads and bodies die, and as I have said, the Spaniards are clean and little by little all vermin disappear and are not to be seen" (Oviedo 104).1 In this model, departure from Spain precipitates an abandonment of its hyperrealities, an escape from its minutiae, as if the voyage alone were sufficient to eradicate the incipient problems of the Old World. Incorporated with such instances of erasure are broader discourses of idealization, especially involving what Beatriz Pastor terms the discourses of conquest and of failure. Here, the natural world of insects helps to meas ure and magnify the interaction of these discourses. What is illuminated by the testaments of Spanish New World chroniclers such as Columbus, Cort?s, Oviedo, and Cabeza de Vaca is the repeated attempt to contort American reality into expected patterns while disclosing utterly unexpected ones: The initial narrative discourse on the conquest of America was shaped by suc cess. This success was problematical for Columbus, but he managed to avoid disappointment by refraining from drawing realistic comparisons between his findings and his expectations. [.. . ] The representation of the conquest and the model of a conquistador created by Hern?n Cort?s, by contrast, was based on a careful selection, reorganization, and reelaboration of historical material designed to provide a fictional context within which everything their author did led to legitimate and undisputable success. [. . . ] Along with the mythification of reality, action, and personalities, however, there evolved another quite different discourse. This discourse would be grounded in failure and it would proclaim the value of misfortune and the merit of suffering. (Pastor, Armature 116) These segmented typologies imply a chronological progression that is per haps less important than the play of both success and failure within not only the same text, but often the same local textual moment. Conquest, in other words, does not so much devolve into failure over time as it does contain and conceal a latent failure always ready to emerge and transform the ideal. The "merit of suffering" becomes not pathos alone, but a partial release from the constraints of success itself. The rampant self-fashioning in Cort?s, the "fictional context" of legitimization, extends ultimately into both dis courses. Thus the remarkable appearance and disappearance of Oviedo's parasitic insects ironically underscores a pattern in which conquest and fail ure themselves become consuming components of the colonization process, one rooted in the natural history of insects and their own often idealized communities. Beginning perhaps with Virgil's Georgics, bees, ants and other social insects have been the poetic models for ideal, organized communities, clockwork colonies of perfect governance and efficiency. Indeed, for Virgil, bees were the last torchbearers of the Utopian Golden Age, uniquely gener ating a golden honey that once had flowed freely from every tree?Jove's reward to them for feeding him in his infancy and shielding him from his murderous father. Shakespeare in Henry V later paraphrases Virgil's mel lifluous vision, a commonwealth of bees in socio-political harmony, as the Archbishop of Canterbury opines, "Therefore doth heaven divide / The state of man in divers functions":</page><page sequence="3">22 UTOPIAN STUDIES ... for so work the honey-bees, Creatures that by a rule in nature teach The act of order to a peopled kingdom. They have a king, and officers of sorts, Where some, like magistrates, correct at home; Others, like merchants, venter trade abroad; Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings, Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds, Which pillage they with merry march bring home To the tent-royal of their emperor, Who busied in his majesty surveys The singing masons building roofs of gold, The civil citizens kneading up the honey, The poor mechanic porters crowding in Their heavy burthens at his narrow gate, The sad-ey'd justice, with his surly hum, Delivering o'er to executors pale The lazy yawning drone.2 (1.2.183-204) The exclusive and erroneous masculinity of this operation follows Aristote lian zoology?there were no Queen Bees in the time of Queen Bess.3 What Shakespeare crafts accurately, however, is a template for the process of col onization itself. If the conquistadors saw themselves as following in the bold, chivalric steps of Amadis and other Spanish heroes, they also follow the busy hum of Virgil's/Shakespeare's bees, armed not for golden honey but gold itself. Cort?s for one repeatedly divests himself of the riches he finds, delivering to the tent-royal of his own Emperor, Charles V, all man ner of New World inventory.4 Ironically, the first mention of such homage, in the so-called First Letter (not actually written by Cort?s), appears when the narrator reports of Cozumel that "The only trade which the Indians have is in bee-hives, and our Procurators will bear to Your Highnesses specimens of the honey and the bee-hives that you may command them to be exam ined" (1:145). Thus as Shakespeare appropriates metaphors of soldiery and pillaging for his colony of bees, the militant formation of colonies in New Spain unwittingly enacts the process not only like bees, but by means of them.5 Further, this highly structured hive?"singing masons," "civil citi zens," and "mechanic porters"?composes a world of insistent order. They construct, they civilize, they mechanize, and finally, they execute. This menace of violence, of failure, remains a component of even this ideal realm, but Shakespeare minimizes its threat. Only the lazy, droning Bar dolphs need be eliminated by the King Henry of this hive. Rebellion is at least as distant as those merchant bees vending abroad in this imperial econ omy. These are creatures engaged with other worlds, more akin in this regard, as well as in their tributary looting of summer buds, to the itinerant conquistadors than the relative insularity of, say, More's Utopians. The Emperor's reaction to Cort?s's substitution of honey for gold in the Cozu mel expedition?replicated comically in Quixote's measurement of minute lice "worth their weight in gold"?is not left to posterity. But the cross</page><page sequence="4">Insects 23 pollination here of insect materiality with fictive models?the circulation of bees as both adventurers and treasure?articulates the diversity of insect appropriations in the discourse of conquest. By the late sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, metaphorical render ings akin to Shakespeare's hive had become commonplace in texts treating everything from husbandry to political representation. Thomas Moffet com pleted his encyclopedic Theater of Insects in 1590, a work that combines taxonomy with effusive moral exegeses, some twenty-two years after prob ably the first English monograph on insects, Thomas Hill's brief A Pleasant Instruction on the Parfit Ordering of Bees (1568). But the two texts that best exemplify early modern insect politics might be Charles Butler's The Feminine Monarchy: or the History of Bees (1609) and Samuel Hartlib's epistolary collection The Reformed Commonwealth of Bees (1655). The for mer celebrates the monarchy of bees as divinely ordained, an ardently royal ist view nowhere found in Hartlib's commonwealth, where parliamentarians could rejoice that new domestic bee hives were being invented, some even transparent, that affirmed an agenda of reform.6 In their diverse regard for the natural perfection of insect colonies, these texts participate in a dis course already plotted in early modern conquest and travel narratives, where the New World in general, and the process of colonization specifically, is often configured as similarly Utopian. However, the competing discourse of failure, a discourse much more pervasive in the Spanish conquest narratives than in the Archbishop of Canterbury's peroration (where it is little more than a codicil) undermines both the Utopian vision and the perfection of the colonization process. In Pastor's discourse of conquest, the natural world appears as provi dentially designed, legitimizing a projection of Old World ideas onto New World subjects. In the discourse of failure, on the other hand, the natural world appears resistant to the metaphors of Old World colonization. So too depictions of rigid insect "colonies," revered and allegorized as testimonials to law, organization, piety, and obedience, ideal in theory, thinly veil the disruptive and disordered chaos beneath the veneer of order. Shakespeare suggests something like this with his leaderless bees in the second part of Henry VI: "The commons, like an angry hive of bees / That want their leader, scatter up and down, / And care not who they sting in his revenge" (3.2.125-7). The indiscriminate disorder, later controlled in Henry V, posits peril always at the fringes of organization, lying at the periphery like carto graphic dragons waiting at the edge of a flat earth. Still, the imposing diffi culties also propelled the conquest, as evidenced in the poem published at the conclusion of Richard Eden's translation A Treaty se of the ewe India: "To all adventurers, and suche as take in hande greate enterprises." For after all, "Who hath not of sowrenes felte the bitter tast, / Is not worthy of swetenes to take his repast. /. . ./Who that of bees feareth the stinge, / Shal never by hony have great wonninge." The very threat of failure thus pro motes the act of conquest itself, a reciprocation that balances the more obvi ous ways in which the promise of conquest conjoined with the fulfillment of</page><page sequence="5">24 UTOPIAN STUDIES failure. However, the "adventurers" in New Spain were also engaged with a different set of signs altogether than this poem portends. As Oviedo observes, one of the New World's pleasures is that many bees there have no stinger at all. This process of idealization became trammeled up with the conquista dors' distortion of the New World and its inhabitants, human and non human alike, and created a more complicated picture of conquest entirely than simply overcoming stings to reach honey. Pastor traces the discourse of conquest through Columbus, given espe cially Columbus's "penchant for mythification," since "the portrait of the New World presented in the Admiral's diaries and letters provided the foun dation for a specific colonial plan," a model whose "main focus . . . was the acquisition of gold" (Armature 50). In the process of mythification and d?mythification Pastor sketches, the plundering of America for gold conse quently devalued most other resources. This fairly accounts for such state ments as those in Cortes's First Letter, in which discovery of apiaries on Cozumel is later ameliorated by expectation that the Yucatan contains "everything in this country which existed in that from whence Solomon is said to have brought the gold for the Temple" (1: 162). That the conquista dors were more concerned with the gold than a revived Golden Age has become commonplace. As Edmundo O'Gorman describes it, the "blissful image of a restored Golden Age gave way to an actual Age of Iron" (91). Yet the backdrop of mythification remained a potent stimulus for the ideal ization of colonization. Hyperbolic accounts of the physical reality of the American continent, where explorers spoke of endless mountain ranges and mile-wide rivers inhabited by a people who spoke no known language, had no writing, and had excess gold but did not treasure it, were at best difficult to believe. But this sense of wonderment?the paradoxical condition of dis belief at what must be real?may also have shaped the conception of the New World more than any other; indeed, Stephen Greenblatt argues that "the principal faculty involved in generating these representations is not rea son but imagination" (Marvelous Possessions 13). The conquistadors acquired their images and expectations of the New World partly from the texts they had read, and, in turn, recycled to Europe fantastical accounts of what they witnessed. According to J.H. Elliott, "Their heads filled with fan tastic notions, their courage spurred by noble examples of the great heroes of chivalry, the conquistadors were prepared to undergo every kind of hard ship and sacrifice as they penetrated through swamps and jungles into the heart of the new continent" (63). Such texts as those attributed to Marco Polo and Sir John Mandeville were likely direct influences on Columbus and others, but recent criticism has tended to locate the backdrop of early modern discovery discourse with Herodotus.7 One of the gaudier legends appearing in the Histories, and retold by Mandeville, provides an especially useful analogue for the discursive prac tices at work in Columbus's Journals. In detailing the various tributes made to Darius of Persia, Herodotus offers an anecdote on India and its annual contribution of gold dust:</page><page sequence="6">Insects 25 There are Indians further north . . . and it is they who go out to fetch the gold? for it is in this part of India that the desert lies. There is found in this desert a kind of ant of great size?bigger than a fox, though not so big as a dog. Some specimens which were caught there, are kept at the palace of the Persian king. These creatures as they burrow underground throw up the earth, and they are very like ours in shape. The sand has a rich content of gold, and this it is that the Indians are after when they make their expedition to the desert. [. . . ] [T]hey plan their timetable so as actually to get their hands on the gold during the hottest part of the day, when the heat will have driven the ants underground. [. . . ] When the Indians reach the place where the gold is, they fill the bags they have brought with them with sand, and start for home again as fast as they can go; for the ants (if we may believe the Persians' story) smell them and at once give chase; nothing in the world can touch these ants for speed, so not one of the Indians would get home alive, if they did not make sure of a good start while the ants were mustering their forces. (217-18) The Persian story displays several commonalities with the conquest enter prise: to begin, the expectation, indeed promise, of the Natural World pro viding great wealth without labor. As Greenblatt put it, "the hallmark of power in the sixteenth century was to be waited on by others. [. . . ] The New World held out the prospect of such status for all but the poorest cabin boy" (Shakespearean Negotiations 30). Hypertrophie ants harnessed and deceived into digging gold from hot sand would have been an attractive leg end to those arriving in the New World, an attraction of which the less fic tional result was of course the enslavement of human beings. Given such analogues, Columbus's caveat to Spanish settlers on his third voyage is additionally pronounced: "they came simply believing that the gold was there to be shoveled, and the spices already bound, and everything at the water's edge, ready to be stowed in the vessels. And they did not consider that... the gold would have to be dug for, and the spices picked and dried" (quoted in Pastor, Armature 52). The gradual d?mythification of the New World results partially from this refusal of the natural world to cohere with fabulous expectation.8 Colonies of insects also figure early in the discourse of European cul tural exchange.9 Andrew Cooper reports that "Beekeeping was already a native practice when the Romans came to England. Since the Romans brought with them Italian bees but 'employed native British bee-keepers, who then employed native bees, who understood the British climate,' Britons . . . could feel that they had retained the native tradition and colo nized the colonizers" (162). The word "colony" itself derives from the Latin "colere," meaning "to cultivate"; hence a Roman "colonus" was as likely to be a farmer, bringing physical order to the land, as a settler reordering the population. In their amalgamation of bees, the Romans and Britons antici pate an ongoing process of species translocation, movement often prompted by human colonization. Thus on the relatively isolated islands of the Pacific, for instance, it has been suggested that "even small, delicate flyers, such as mosquitoes, fail to make the journey without human assistance. Indeed, Micronesia was free of flies and mosquitoes until Spanish conquistadors</page><page sequence="7">26 UTOPIAN STUDIES brought these insects to Guam" (Rodda et al. 565). Moreover, such "small flyers" become problematic because their resituation, dependent on rather than despite their size, is almost always inadvertent. As often the case with translocated species, especially from Old World to New and not especially vice versa, these creatures become a part of what Alfred Crosby in Ecologi cal Imperialism terms a "grunting, lowing, neighing, crowing, chirping, snarling, buzzing, self-replicating and world-altering avalanche" of alien species (194).10 Moreover, their translocation in the Indies reflects a compa rable discursive reprocessing of new species as alternately idealized or grotesque dislocations of Old World models. Perhaps the clearest example of this cultural dislocation between the Old and New worlds unfolds in Oviedo's first description of the insects of the Indies. He begins with an attractive, nearly idyllic observation: "There are many small bees about the size of flies, that breed in hollow trees. [. . . ] They do not sting or do harm. In fact, they have no stinger. They make large honeycombs. The little holes through which they enter are four times as large as those made by the Spanish bees" (72). These creatures, painless and bountiful, promise a world of pleasure at little cost, a recirculation of the Herodotean ants and gold. They are further encouragements of a world that precludes labor, and are, indeed, perfect inversions of the island insects with which Prospero threatens Caliban in Shakespeare's The Tempest: "thou shalt be pinch'd / As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging / Than bees that made 'em" (1.2.328-30). Oviedo then turns to the ants, however, whose appearance contrasts markedly with the gilded bees: There are very many different kinds of ants, and some are unbelievably destructive. They have inflicted great damage on trees, canefields, and other things necessary to man. [. . . ] The worst are black ants almost as large as bees. They are very pestiferous. From them and other poisonous ingredients the Indians make the poison with which they tip their arrows. There is no antidote for this poison and of those wounded by it, not four in one hundred recover. We have seen many Spaniards bitten by these ants and immediately they developed a high fever, followed by a great swelling of the body. (72-3) That the "pestiferous" ants, whom Oviedo juxtaposes expressly with their beneficent colonizing cousins, beget a lethal poison also seems to contrast the nourishment of honey produced by the bees. Notable, too, is the aug mentation of this danger when combined, by the Indians, with other ingredi ents: here, the addition of art to nature creates an abomination rather than any augmentation of husbandry. Elsewhere, in portions of Oviedo's Historia General y Natural de las Indias, he observes how the "citie of Saint Domingo, was almost dishabited by this great Armie of little creatures" (quoted in Purchas 15: 226). These warrior ants function as complex signifiers, not only recalling the gold laden India of Herodotus, in which their gargantuan size makes them formidable guardians of desert treasure, but also manifesting a militancy traceable to the classical myth of the Myrmidons, related in Book VII of</page><page sequence="8">Insects 27 Ovid's Metamorphoses.11 Sandys's 1632 edition translates the creation of these fierce soldiers from ants as follows: Before my eyes the selfe-same Oke appeard; So many branches, as before there were; So many busie Ants those branches beare; So shooke the Oke, and with that motion threw To under-earth the graine supporting crue. Greater and greater straight they seeme to sight: To raise themselves from earth, and stand up-right. Whom numerous feet, black-colour, lanknesse leave: And instantly a humane shape receive. (7.634-42) Confronted with the dilemma of perhaps equally fantastic and truculent pis mires promulgating their own conquest, Oviedo hastens to report that Old World methods may still overcome the problem.12 He applies first to the calamity a familiar Christian axiom, that God can "arme the least creatures to the destruction of proud vainglorious men" (quoted in Purchas 15: 226). Thus Oviedo writes into this new volume of Nature's Book a familiar story: plagues of insects sent to punish impiety. The solution, then, for the Spanish colonizers to this swarming force is straightforward: prayer, namely for the intercession of a saint. But this moment has a complicated effect, and read ing Oviedo through his Protestant translator here suggests a way in which the ants might be said to have indeed colonized the colonizers, reflecting back strangeness and alienation upon them. In the English edition of Oviedo's work published as part of Purchas his Pilgrimes, there is substantial if predictable condemnation of the Catho lic solution. "This miserie so perplexed the Spaniards," writes Purchas, "that they sought as strange a remedie as was the disease, which was to chuse some Saint for their Patron against the Antes. [. . . ] And the Lot fell upon Saint Saturnine whose feast is on the nine and twentieth of November: after which the ant-damage became more tolerable and by little and little diminished, by Gods mercie and intercession of that Saint" (15: 227). Pur chas's tone becomes quickly apparent, as after reporting the diminishing "ant-damage" he spends the better part of a page wondering why anyone would turn to such "Romish superstitious phrensies" (15: 226), "as strange a remedie as the disease." He complains that "God hath sent his owne Sonne . . . [and] whether against Ants or Devils ... in him it hath pleased the Father that all fulnesse should dwell" (15: 227). These protestations, even as they attempt to do what the ants could not, estranging the coloniz ers, of course can be read back against themselves: in another historical or cultural context, Purchas becomes the odd fellow, perhaps for wrongly denouncing martyrs, or perhaps for accepting too readily a fable of soldier ants. The strains in colonial discourse are registered clearly in this local moment, and in the divisions of Purchas and Oviedo: the straddling of dif ference while attempting to merge Old and New?worlds, religions? is always already fraught with the anxiety of failure, even as an idealized world?hymenopteran, Christie?tries to maintain itself.</page><page sequence="9">28 UTOPIAN STUDIES In his enthusiasm for all things minute, Oviedo anticipates the magiste rial work on insects in Elizabethan England, Thomas Moffet's Theater of Insects. And the idealization of insects in his narrative is at times as highly self-conscious as the latter's doting explications of insect exempla. Effec tively, Oviedo captures the spirit if not the letter of Pliny's Natural History, which commences its own book on insects with the assertion that "Nature is to be found in her entirety nowhere more than in her smallest creations" (3: 435).13 Oviedo remarks on the motivations for his treatise of particularly small creatures: I do want to describe some insects that are a fearful pest to man. These insects make man realize that even worthless and petty things can disturb his peace of mind, and that he should not forget the chief end of man, which is to know his Creator and seek the salvation of his soul. [. . . ] Although some of the things I am about to describe are filthy and not as clean and as agreeable as those already described, nevertheless they are worthy of being noted, so one can see the many things in nature. (103) For Moffet, even flies and mosquitoes breed admiration and sympathy. The author sees their "prowess and valour... to surpass man himself," and cites Homer on "the undaunted courage and confidence of the Fly. Who although he be never so often revulst and beaten off, comes on again, and bites as close as he did before: yea such a strength he hath with him, that he will not wound the skin of a man only, but of an Oxe or Horse: yea the Elephant also when he gets between the wrinkles of his skins, he will shrewdly vex him, and according to the bignesse of his snout gash and wound him" (931). Finally, Moffet points out that these pests actually bite "not out of rusticity or clownishness to get blood out only; but by way of love &amp; humanity, &amp; for that reason especially [they] seizeth upon the fairest: yea what a pretty thing it is to see a company of Flyes . . . playing and sporting one with another, and hanging upon a thred as it were dancers on the ropes?" (931). The delicacy of Moffet's final arrangement echoes the "merry march" of Shakespeare's bee colony, with each movement balanced and carefree. These flies are indefatigable soldiers, graceful and organized dancers. Moreover, they actually bite "by way of love and humanity." They are for Moffet miniature reflections of divine caritas, charitably and perpetually attracted to others even at the expense of their own lives. In short, they embody that Utopian reality where bees no longer sting, gold flows like honey from a hive, ants are subdued by saints, and flies love their neighbors. The destabilizing of this discourse is most evident when human and non-human encounters meld into a single hybrid ordeal, a process threaten ing to erupt in Oviedo's anthropomorphic ant soldiers. Such conflations muddle the lines between Old and New, self and other, and most impor tantly between the natural and the colonized in a way that also recalls Quixote's delusional expectations of difference. Bernal Diaz del Castillo, recounting the expedition of Juan de Grijalva in 1518, describes an early battle that blurred the natural world and the native peoples: "The field where we fought with these people was very stony, and there was on it a</page><page sequence="10">Insects 29 prodigious swarm of locusts. These animals during the action sprang up and struck us in the faces, so that we hardly knew when to put up our shields to guard us, or whether they were arrows or locusts which flew around us, they came so mixed together" (15-16). The commingling of arrows and locusts not only confuses the experience; the violence with which the natural world here resists incursion provides for Castillo an image of the violent collision of Old and New. It is a vision of potentially biblical proportions: not only the plagues of Egypt, with mosquitoes, horseflies, and locusts, but also the creatures from the Abyss of Revelation: "and out of the smoke dropped locusts onto the earth. [. . . ] These locusts looked like horses armoured for battle; they had what looked like gold crowns on their heads, and their faces looked human, and their hair was like women's hair, and teeth like lion's teeth. They had body-armour like iron breastplates, and the noise of their wings sounded like the racket of chariots with many horses charging" (New Jerusalem Bible Rev. 9.3-10). In this imagistic pattern, Pastor's dual dis courses of colonization and failure also chart a teleological movement from Eden to Armageddon. The locusts with all their apocalyptic trappings offer an especially rich textual moment, one that configures the end of one world?just as the locusts of Revelation help signal the conclusion of Chris tian history?while violently supposing the creation of another. Later, Castillo relates how "this country is infested with mosquitoes," and that "in order to avoid them I went to sleep in a large temple" (23). His retreat to a site of worship serves not only as a physical repellent to the plague of flies, but also as a reassertion Old World religious ideals, however ironically con tained in the midst of alien surroundings. The destabilizing of the New World forced Europe at times to see itself as other even while struggling to make the New World in its image. Critics have often noted that the search for continuity between the two stems from the Utopian drive itself. Ralf Dahrendorf, for instance, argues that "All utopias from Plato's Republic to George Orwell's brave new world of 1984 have one element in common: they are all societies from which change is absent" (107). And though that framework may fail to comprehend a great many Utopian models, for colonizers in the New World, the perfection of the Utopian dream depended on keeping New consistent with Old.14 The denial of American reality was a large part of this Utopian vision: the often monstrous utopia formed during the period of colonization in North and Latin America mediates hardships and injustices with a European imagina tion and all its literary and political tradition. The creation or discovery of America, then, is further implicated in the production of texts about it. Pas tor suggests that the "discovery of America, which is really the creation of the image of a Utopian America, is prolonged in an analogous discovery: of the self identity that is being formed as a part of the same metaphoric dis course articulated by the texts of the conquistadors" ("Utopia" 110).15 The view of America as Utopian, the view that America is ideal in either being or possibility, helps liberate the European imagination from reality and bind it closer to literary tradition. Even Thomas More's Utopia knits up Utopian</page><page sequence="11">30 UTOPIAN STUDIES ideology with New World conquest, greatly affecting the way America was seen during and after the period of conquest and colonization. As Frederic Murray has it, More "provided a name for the enterprise and a suggested social structure: in effect, More's Utopia offered a conceptual model that was based along European lines but that had its origins fundamentally in the idealized descriptions of the New World indigenous communities" (30). Nature, in Utopia, provides the gold and the food necessary for society to function in its ideal state. But this vision failed to mesh with the reality of the New World, or rather the act of forcing it to mesh revealed the very anxie ties it sought to conceal. Oviedo's army of ants might be tamed with Chris tian prayer; but the process, as Oviedo's translator attests, can reflect back upon the colonizers a sense of how impertinent their own presence can be. Cort?s describes part of a failed expedition south of the Yucatan in which, after having once triumphantly brought the Aztec empire under Spanish domination, he now is so overpowered by nature that it alone proscribes his conquest and delimits discovery. Cort?s states, "we passed the night in a great downpour of rain and amid the greatest pest of mosquitoes imagin able. Such was the condition of the forest and the road, and so dark and tempestuous was the night that, two or three times when I attempted to reach the town, I failed to discover the way, although we were so near that we could almost hear the people talking to one another" (2: 294). That this remarkable aimlessness and blindness should coexist with Utopian purpose and clarity speaks to the failed reconciliations of Old World patterns with a New World reality that seemed to accept the pattern only to stretch and dis tort it. As Edward Said has contended, imagining the New World from afar invited an imperialism that inevitably sought such reconciliation, even as a process that simplified and condensed reality in the Americas helped foster an equally distorted idealization of the European self: "There was a commit ment ... in constant circulation and recirculation, which, on the one hand, allowed decent men and women to accept the notion that distant territories and their native peoples should be subjugated, and, on the other, replenished metropolitan energies so that these decent people could think of the imp? rium as a protracted, almost metaphysical obligation to rule subordinate, inferior, or less advanced peoples" (10). In sixteenth-century New Spain, this metaphysical obligation became distinct from the physical experience of the land, which alternately reciprocated and impeded a Utopian vision. The imagined pliability of the New World often proved an overestimation of nature's passivity as the conquistadors hit upon repeated failures. Ideal izations of the New World made independently of the land in question fell apart as a new natural reality surfaced, even as the displacement of ideal insect colonies by minatory insect infestations became the hallmark for many of these failures. In the discourse of failure, of delusional journeys set out to find non existent gold and riches, entomological forces assume more clearly a sinis ter tone, and become often direct indicators for the failure of utopia itself.</page><page sequence="12">Insects 31 From the very beginning of such texts as Alvar N??ez Cabeza de Vaca's Relaci?n (1542), the Edenic flora and fauna of earlier conquest narratives have been displaced by an oppressive biota threatening constantly to over power him and his crew: We found mosquitoes of three sorts, all abundant in every part of the region. They poison and inflame and, through most of the summer, exasperated us. For protection, we encircled ourselves with smudge fires of rotten and wet wood. We did little else all night than shed tears from the smoke of this remedy, besides roasting from the intense heat of the many fires. If at any time we took refuge to the seaside and fell asleep, we were reminded with blows to feed the fires. (80) Cabeza de Vaca seems positively oblivious to the "love and humanity" Moffet supposed of these creatures. This nightmarish portrait of humanity struggling to institute order, but instead only perpetuating a kind of natural entropy, devolves for Cabeza de Vaca into a virtual dystopia: The Indians of the interior have another intolerable method, even worse than the one I have just mentioned, which is to fire the plains and forests within reach with brands, both to drive the mosquitoes away and at the same time drive lizards and like things from the earth to eat. [. . . ] By the time they go, the ravages of those insects make them look as if they had the affliction of holy Lazarus. [. . . ] I can declare from sad experience that there is no torment in the world equal to it. (81) The crew, whose lives were being menaced constantly by the asperity of their environment, often seemed to regard nature as providentially designed not for their pleasure but for their destruction. Unlike Oviedo's report of the ants in Hispaniola, however, Cabeza de Vaca finds little solace in Old World ideologies.16 At one point, his men wracked with illness, likely mosquito-borne malaria, he writes "We did not have horses enough to carry the sick, who kept getting worse every day, and we know no cure for the disease" (44). Instead his impressions suggest an infernal Under World of smoke, fire, and pestilence rather than a New World of milk-and-honey. He proclaims miserably, "I will not prolong this unpleasantness; but you can imagine what it would be like in a strange, remote land, destitute of means either to remain or to get out" (44). The land, now identifiable only as "strange and remote," pushes the borders of expression. No longer recipro cating a Utopian vision, Cabeza de Vaca's text must rest in silence as his narrative unravels. When confronted with entirely new forms, the textual transmission of Utopian visions could finally only insufficiently convey New World meaning. By the late seventeenth century, the discourse of conquest had over leapt Don Quixote to become a virtual parody of itself. Carlos de Sig?enza y G?ngora treats the voyage of another conquistador as Infortunios de Alonso Ram?rez (1690), a fictional figure (Ram?rez) who like Cabeza de Vaca enacts the discourse of failure throughout his narrative. When speaking of the physical nature of the American continent, he states:</page><page sequence="13">32 UTOPIAN STUDIES That place was not only sterile and without water but also very sick; and although it was recognized as such by my companions, fearing that they would die on the journey, there was no way to convince them to leave it. But God wanted that what my begging did not accomplish, the mosquitoes (which were also present) would with their pestering; and they were, without any doubt, with their stinging in part the cause of the aforementioned swelling.17 (135) In a wondrous transposition of Oviedo's ants and dogma, the flies here are the Lord, the chaos of the insects itself a divine ordinance meant not to pun ish impiety and urge the intercession of a saint, but to defer the Old World's manifest destiny, compelling alienation instead of integration. No longer was America a pleasant rendition of Europe; the fictive perfections once projected onto it had become perhaps equally fictive evils. Later texts more fully masked such discourses. John Brickell, a naturalist writing from the New World in 1737, returns unmitigatedly to the Utopian view of the insect colonies when he observes: "The Bees are in great Plenty, not only in Hives, in the Planter's Gardens, but are likewise to be met with in several parts of the Woods in hollow Trees, wherein are frequently found vast quan tities of Honey.... The Uses and Profits of these noble Insects, are so well known amongst us in Europe, that it would be needless to trouble the Reader about them" (154). Brickell also refers to the ant as "a small, but industrious and wise insect, gathering its food in the Summer in the full Moons and resting in the new ones: they are like a common wealth, and gather Corn for their Winter provisions, which they dry and bite at both ends that it may not grow. . . They teach their young to Labour, but expel the Idle, and when they carry their grain, it is said to be a sign of fowl Weather" (158). The simultaneity of impulses in this ideal community?the Solomonic instruction of industry coupled with the Shakespearean expul sion of the idle?still bears the residue, however, of the interwoven dis courses of conquest and failure. When twentieth-century colonizers recreated the often communistic Utopian vision in Latin America, novelists like Garcia Marquez capped the discourse of failure by creating a magical reality where an unyielding nature is always perforating the walls of modernity. The conclusion to One Hun dred Years of Solitude, for instance, contains the horrific image of a child whom "all the ants in the world were dragging toward their holes along the stone path in the garden." The narrator ultimately eulogizes the novel's long, fateful bloodline: "The last is being eaten by the ants" (420). But while Garcia Marquez captures an almost jaded resignation, the early mod ern discourses of conquest and failure feature a devouring of a different kind of innocence.18 Idealized glosses on the Old World Utopian virtues of insects, transported into the New World during the nascent struggle between colonization and natural resistance, were consumed as the Utopian dream devolved. And in underscoring this contest, the natural history of insects helps articulate the precarious identities of both worlds.</page><page sequence="14">Insects 33 NOTES *For suggestions on earlier versions of this essay, I wish to thank Lilian Contreras-Silva, Bar bara Lewalski, Marie Henson, Wendy Hyman, Sarah Wall, Holger Schott, Erin Minear, Jason Moore, Betty Carolin, and anonymous readers at Utopian Studies. 1. Cervantes's adaptation of this material distinctly bifurcates the Old and New worlds, in contrast to Oviedo's continuum of difference, in which the lice disappear "little by little" rather than all at once. He also omits Oviedo's further point, however, that "Even though we do not have these vermin in our hair and on our bodies while we are in the Indies, when we are returning to Europe, as we reach the place in the Atlantic where the vermin left us on the westward trip, once again we are attacked, as if the lice were lying in wait for us" (104). Cer vantes adds an ironic touch to the travel as well, noting that Quixote and Sancho drift only "as fast as an ant can crawl" (515), the changing of insects changing at an insect's pace. 2. All references to Shakespeare are from the Riverside edition. For commentary on this pas sage, see Gurr, and cf. Virgil's GeorgicsTV, lines 153-65. 3. On the politics of bee gender and royalty, see Merrick and Allen. Since Aristotle's day, bees were thought ruled by a king, and even Purchas claims that the ruler was "a king in place and power, yet in sex a female" (qtd. Merrick, 16). 4. Sylvester's translation (1605) of Du Bartas's Divine Weeks has a less georgic transforma tion of the conquistadors, an image of the "Amazonian River, / Where SPAIN'S Gold-thirsty Locusts cool their liver" (1: 175). 5. Similarly, the introduction of honeybees to English colonies in the early seventeenth cen tury prompted a boom in honeycomb across the region east of the Mississippi. The explosive bee population, however, began to signify colonial expansion itself. Alfred Crosby remarks that "honey was a blessing to the North American indigenes, who had previously had only maple sugar for a strong sweetener, but the 'English fly' was for them a dismal portent of the white frontier. St. Jean de Cr?vecoeur wrote that 'as they discover the bees, the news of this event, passing from mouth to mouth, spreads sadness and consternation in all minds'" (189-90). 6. Another significant text, Samuel Purchas's A Theatre of Politicali Flying Insects (1657), includes "meditations theologicall and morali, in three centuries, upon the nature of bees" (257), and makes such potentially divisive assessments as "If the Queene-Bee be slaine, or any wayes miscarry, the whole hive is overthrowne" (306). Milton's Paradise Lost (1667) compares the construction of Satan's Pandaemonium not only to a buzzing hive, in which the fallen angels "expatiate and confer / Their state affairs," but to "that pygmean race / beyond the Indian mount," while residual colonialism adheres too in such titles as Joseph Warder's popular study of bee management, The True Amazons; or, Monarchy of Bees (1712). 7. See for instance Peter Hulme, who writes: "there is what might be called a discourse of Oriental civilization and a discourse of savagery, both archives of topics and motifs that can be traced back to the classical period" (21); and "Herodotus is either the acknowl edged authority or unacknowledged source for the discourse's various topoi as they journey through a variety of Hellenic and Latin texts into the Middle Ages and early vernacular litera ture" (270 n.9). 8. Mythification persisted, of course, in later encounters with other parts of the Americas. Paul Le Jeune describes in 1636 an interesting revision of the ant legend in the Quebec region of New France: "Meanwhile Monsieur Commandant goes up higher, continuing as far as the River of the Prairies. Upon his return he described these places to us as a terrestrial Para dise .... There indeed are riches, collected in one place; but the Mosquitoes are the little dragons that guard those beautiful golden apples, which cannot be had without difficulty, any more than the other gifts of the earth" (251). With draconian flies displacing the canine ants, and the garden of the Hesperides similarly refashioning a mythical "India," this adaptation emphasizes the sting-reward paradigm of the poem in Eden's Newe India. But the structural</page><page sequence="15">34 UTOPIAN STUDIES components?insects as gate-keepers, riches for those smart or Herculean enough to bypass them?suggests a recirculation of Herodotean discourse well into the seventeenth century. 9. George Sandys, the seventeenth-century mythographer and translator of Ovid, accords to bees an early intervention in the discourse of cannibalism: the Oreads, mountain nymph fol lowers of Diana, "were said to be the first that diverted men from the eating of flesh, giving an example by feeding on Chestnuts &amp; Akornes. When one of them, named Melissa finding by chance a comb full of hony, gave a tast thereof to the rest of the Nymphs: who delighting in the sweetenesse, and rejoycing in the invention; called the Bees themselves Melissa's in her honour" (397). The very word for honey in Spanish, "miel," maintains etymologically a hint of this mythical process of civilizing, an assertion of anti-cannibalistic refinement. 10. Cf. William Cronon, who notes the destructive impact of such insect imports as the Hes sian fly, which "brought about the virtual end of wheat raising in Connecticut," the black fly, and the cockroach (153). Cronon observes further, however, that native species became inor dinately problematic themselves after the arrival of Europeans: "insects that increased their populations by inhabiting colonial gardens included grasshoppers, garden fleas, maggots, and various species of 'worm' and 'flies.' Colonial orchards were particularly susceptible to attacks by such insects, and, in the case of the cankerworm, which first appeared in 1666, had to be constantly defended against" (154). 11. The exaggerated dimensions of many New World species, whenever possible, were part of the mythification transmitted back to Europe. This seems an early aspect of travel narra tives, already being satirized by Lucian in his True History, in which a micro-militia of flies and fleas mutates into creatures "approximately twelve times the size of elephants" (255). Few New World insects reached the supposed girth of Herodotus's dog-size ants, but cf. Thomas Harriot in his Brief and True Report (1588): "In manie of our journeyes we found silke wormes fayre and great; as bigge as our ordinary walnuttes. [. . . ] [TJhere will rise as great profite in time to the Virginians, as there of doth now to the Persians, Turkes, Italians and Spaniards" (8). 12. Sandys's commentary here suggests, too, a colonizing discourse at work in the creation of men from ants: "This fable was also invented of the few inhabitants of that Island [Aegina]: who by reason of the frequent piracies and incursions of other nations, dwelt in obscure caves; . . . . V/hen Aeacus taught them to build ships, and exercized them in martial discipline: where by they were both animated, and inabled to resist the injuries of strangers" (347). Oviedo's account reverses this model: the ants, not the islanders, are enabling the resistance of strangers, though from the perspective of the conquistadors, of course, the ants are strange and injurious. 13. On Oviedo and the various echoes of Pliny and other authorities, as well as their inade quacies in representing the New World, see Myers. I am in agreement with Jos? Rabasa's reading of Oviedo's design as one in which "Ancient and American phenomena corroborate each other in an image of nature full of wonders and a New World where the unexpected con stantly erupts.... [EJarlier projections of European beasts or monsters open, with Oviedo, into a scenario of American nature where new and marvelous entities thrive within the domain of legend" (148-9). A full study of Oviedo's fauna can be found in Gerbi. 14. A useful account of both static and dynamic utopias can be found in Hansot, while Davis extends and historicizes the discussion of ideological tensions between Old and New Worlds. 15. "El descubrimiento de Am?rica que es en realidad la creaci?n de la figura ut?pica ameri cana se prolonga en un descubrimiento an?logo: el de la propia identidad que se va delineando como parte del mismo discurso figurativo que articulan los textos de los conquistadores" (translation mine). 16. Because Cabeza de Vaca survives his journey partly by a kind of imitatio Christi, in which Cabeza de Vaca is perceived by the Native Americans as possessing miraculous heal</page><page sequence="16">Insects 35 ing powers, "the common interpretation of Cabeza de Vaca's experience," writes Rolena Adorno, "is that the healing practices and miraculous cures performed by the Spaniards were responsible for their successful deliverance" (51). However, as Adorno rightly argues, the "discourse of miracles" coexists with a "discourse of terror" that not only problematizes read ings of Cabeza de Vaca's journey as a kind of Divine Comedy, but situates saliently the ways in which failures in the New World were negotiated and suppressed. 17. "Era aquel sitio no s?lo est?ril y falto de agua, sino muy enfermo, y aunque as? lo reconoc?an los compa?eros, temiendo morir en el camino, no hab?a modo de convencerlos que lo dej?semos; pero quiso Dios que lo que no recabaron mis s?plicas, lo consiguieron los mosquitos (que tambi?n all? hab?a) con su molestia y ellos eran, sin duda alguna, los que en parte les hab?an causado las hinchazones que he dicho con sus picadas" (translation mine). 18. The 1976 film version of King Kong (dir. John Guillermin) invokes the conquest of the Americas in similar context. Approaching the forgotten isle, hoping to find a New World not of gold but oil, the crew's leader ruminates: "I always wondered how Cort?s felt when he saw the Incas [sic]." Upon arriving on the beach he continues: "Let's not get eaten alive on this island?bring the mosquito spray." Both gestures mark an ignorance?one of the historical conquest, since Cort?s was not the conquistador who "saw the Incas," and one of the immedi ate conquest, since the island ironically offers more monstrous opposition than mosquitoes. Yet both are nevertheless informed by the competing discourses rampant in the early conquest narratives. On the "insect as Other" in nineteenth- and twentieth-century colonial discourse, see Hollingsworth, 152-86. REFERENCES Allen, Danielle.
