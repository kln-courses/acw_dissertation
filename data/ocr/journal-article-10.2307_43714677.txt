Pp. x + 273; 8 illustrations. $15; paper $4.95. The present book has been eagerly awaited for some time, representing as it does a major effort to write a history of Mesopotamian religion by perhaps the most creative and daring interpreter of the subject of this century. It is not the first such effort Thorkild Jacobsen has made, but it is by far the most comprehensive, gather- ing together and in part extending his earlier syntheses in The Intellectual Adventure of Ancient Man (1946); "Toward the Image of Tammuz" (1961); "Formative Ten- dencies in Sumerian Religion" (1961); "Ancient Mesopotamian Religion: The Cen- tral Concerns" (1963); and "Mesopotamian Gods and Pantheons" (1963) (the last four reprinted in his Toward the Image of Tammuz and Other Essays on Mesopota- mian History and Culture [1970] ). The book opens with a broad discussion of the nature of religious experience in human history generally and in Mesopotamia particularly. Basic to such ex- perience, J. avers - the point already appears in several of his earlier syntheses - is the confrontation with an otherworldly power described by Rudolf Otto as the Numinous. The history of any religion, thus, is the history of its attempts to come to terms with the Numinous, as chronicled in the succession of images or "meta- phors" which it develops to perceive and worship this power. For Mesopotamia specifically - again, the proposal is not new, having been</page><page sequence="2">308 THE CATHOLIC BIBLICAL QUARTERLY | 41, 1979 set forth in his earlier "Ancient Mesopotamian Religion . . ." - J. sees a history in three major phases. Each covers about a millennium from the fourth through the second, B.C., and each is marked by the introduction and predominance of a par- ticular Numinous metaphor along with the retention of metaphors characteristic of previous phases. So in the fourth millennium "intransitivity" dominates: the Numi- nous apprehended here as a set of non-human forces, immanent in the phenomena of nature, which act especially to promote or retard fertility. By the third millen- nium intransitivity takes second place to anthropomorphism: the forces appear most often now as gods, organized as a hierarchy of rulers maintaining the natural and social order. And in the second millennium, while intransitivity and rulership continue, the dominant metaphor becomes personal: the gods are now parents, to whom their human worshippers, now children, pour out their individual appeals, confess their sins, and lament their undeserved suffering. In this historical develop- ment, it should be noted, J. assigns no major role to the first millennium b.c. For him it is a "dark age," whose political and military brutality is reflected in a cours- ening of religious sensibilities, with no new overarching metaphor. The importance of the scheme just outlined can scarcely be overrated. For it just may be the only attempt (and that by a scholar thoroughly at home in all branches of Assyriology) to work out a systematic explanation of Mesopotamian religion, a developmental pattern for it, which goes beyond the mere compilation of data on the gods, cults, etc. that is the essence of practically every other manual on the subject. J.'s volume presents an integrated, dynamic picture linking the dis- parate periods and centers of Mesopotamian history. In the course of unfolding this scheme, moreover, J. offers us a wealth of de- tailed insights. Some are embodied in his translations of Mesopotamian texts, al- ready famous for their poetic felicity and daring, which appear here in abundance, many for the first time. Compare, for instance, his ingenious solution to the diffi- cult first line of the Atrahasis myth i-nu-ma i-lu a-wi-lum: "When Ilu (i.e., Enlil) was the boss" (p. 117; for a full analysis see his contribution in M. deJ. Ellis (ed.), Essays on the Ancient Near East in Memory of Jacob Joel Finkelstein [Hamden, CT: Archon Books, 1977] 113-117). Other discussions, as in chap. 5 on personal religion, testify to J.'s sometimes uncanny grasp of the psychological realities behind the statements in ancient religious texts. One should not forget as well the perceptive literary analyses, especially of EnÅ«ma elish and Gilgamesh, where J. attempts a kind of structuralist dissection of these two well-known poems. In the case of Gilgamesh, furthermore, there is a valuable delineation of the traditions into which the classical Old Bablyonian and Middle Babylonian editions fit, though the argument for a Far Eastern background to two episodes in the story (p. 214) seems far-fetched in itself and does not reckon sufficiently with native Mesopotamian antecedents (cf. J. H. Tigay, Literary-Critical Studies in the Gilgamesh Epic: An Assyriological Contribution to Biblical Literary Criticism [Ph.D. thesis, Yale University, 1971], chap. VI). Finally, the volume under review displays a healthy complexity about the meaning of myth, far more than did J.'s earlier writings like The Intellectual Adventure. . . . The latter took a reductionist view of Mesopotamian myths as direct and virtually exact reflections of specific external realities, by these natural phenomena or historical events. The present volume,</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS AND SHORT NOTICES 309 more sensibly, moves toward the view that external reality is not reflected, but refracted by the literary moulding of a myth, and further that a given myth may well refract several different realities simultaneously (cf., e.g., pp. 96, 191). In the presence of all these contributions, it may seem captious to raise ques- tions. Yet J.'s work, all the more because it is a very personal document, does compel several, of which two may be touched on here. First, has J. really produced a history of religion as practiced and believed in Mesopotamia? By his own ad- mission (pp. 3-4), his scheme is based on what he believes are the "central" meta- phors for the Numinous in Mesopotamia, those which show the 4 'highest' ' and "best" insight; and in seeking these out, the evidence he appeals to is almost exclu- sively literary, even belletristic. The inevitable result is an elitist picture: virtually no room is allotted to social and ethnic variations, and very little to regional (for a cursory reference see p. 25). At the same time, ubiquitous and therefore important religious phenomena like divination - indeed, the phenomena of the whole first millennium - are not fully explored, because they do not rate "high" enough in J.'s rather individual scale of religious insights. We have, in short, a treatment that is not quite balanced, and that at points looks more like a theology than a history of Mesopotamian religion. A second difficulty concerns the presentation of the evidence. In the chapter on the fourth millennium, for example, one notices immediately that the data used come almost entirely from later periods. The point is not that this procedure is il- legitimate. One can easily suppose archaic survivals in later material, and must in fact look for them when, as J. acutely notes, the contemporary data are scanty and rarely "self-evident" (p. 25). But J. never convincingly establishes how we can know what he says we know about the fourth millennium, and thus how we can determine which data, or which part of a single datum, from a later period will be relevant to it. The only argument he offers is that the intransitive metaphor for the Numinous must be in the earliest, the one proper to the fourth millennium, because unlike the other metaphors it is continually present in all the phases of Mesopota- mian religious history (p. 20). Unfortunately, he fails to demonstrate this. Indeed, the earliest evidence he cites, the Uruk vase from the end of the fourth millennium (cf. pp. 15, 24, 26, 43, 209), displays both intransitive and anthropomorphic meta- phors, in that particular case for Inanna. Is it possible, then, that at least these two metaphors could have co-existed from well before the third millennium - perhaps even from the beginning? The present volume, thus, is not without its uncertainties. Yet even where one may disagree with it, one will come away challenged by its subtle and probing per- spective. It adds a special luster to one of the truly great careers of Assyriological scholarship; and the graceful, non-technical way in which it is written should make it accessible to a wide circle of readers.
