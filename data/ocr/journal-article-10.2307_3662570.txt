Morel discusses the cults of Velia based on the epigraphic record available (pp. 33-49), while similar methodology in the identification of further Massaliot cults is followed by Hermary and Tr6ziny (pp. 147-57). Pena co-examines archaeology, inscriptions, and numismatics to explore the principle cult figures of the Greek Emporio (pp. 59-68). Divinities associated with springs and rivers are discussed by Collin Bouffier using material from Massalia and Velia (pp. 69-79), while interesting insights of the little-known mystery cults in Antibes (Greek Antipolis) are offered by Hermary (pp. 159-63). Emphasis is placed on numismatics with respect to the iconography of local cults in works by Picard (pp. 165-74), Furtwangler (pp. 175-81), Pournot (pp. 183-9), and Richard (pp. 191-6). Theodorescu and Tr6ziny add further specialized approaches through observations on the development of archaic Ionic capitals in Marseilles in comparison to its Phocaean metropolis, revealing information about architectural tradition in the western colonial territory (pp. 13 5-46). This volume makes a significant contribution to a field of scholarship for which there is a tantalizing need for new information, data, and approaches. The collaborative nature of this work will benefit those interested in the origins and history of the Phocaean cults in the Mediterranean, and poses questions on broader issues of colonial cults, identities, and inter-state relations. It suggests interdisciplinary methodologies encouraging fuller appreciation of the evidence available from a range of perspectives. The volume is extensively illustrated, including appendices and indices facilitating specific searches. Points of criticism concern the value of the book as a tool to both specialists and to non- connoisseurs. Beyond inconsistencies which are often inevitable in multi-author works, and which Hermary admits to an extent (pp. 8-9), such as differences in style, choice of content and methodology, chronological and geographical focus of individual authors, one would have wished to find fuller guidance by means of maps, chronological tables, and sequence of historical events. A general map to both the ancient sites and modern place-names, together with a chart of principle dates and events, would have increased the accessibility of the book to those with limited experience in the field. A general bibliography with subject-specific sections to guide the reader to the relevant scholarly output is missing, as also is a general conclusion summarizing the current state of scholarship in the field.

ISBN: 0-7141-1761-7. The controversy over 'the Goddess' has been characterized by entrenched positions and little real debate: from Bachofen and Frazer to the modern feminist movement, the idea of an original Mother Goddess, worshipped by a peace-loving, matriarchal society, has found many adherents, while the more sceptical question the very possibility of studying prehistoric religion effectively on the basis of material evidence. This volume sets out to perform the admirable service of 'bridging the gap' between the two camps, with ten specially commissioned articles on various early societies in Europe, Egypt, and the Near East, each of which presents the relevant archaeological evidence in an accessible and open-minded way, so that 'the general reader' may make up her own mind on the issue. Being a Hellenist, I related especially to the editors' own contribution on Minoan religion (pp. 113-32), and Voyatzis on the origins of Greek goddesses, with a case study of the sanctuary of Athena Alea at Tegea (pp. 98-112), but I also found much of interest in Meskell on the influence of the Goddess theory on interpretations of Catalh6yiik (pp. 46-62), Westenholz's survey of Near Eastern goddesses of 3000-1000 B.C. (pp. 63-82), and Hassan on the origins of the Egyptian Isis (pp. 98-112). Other articles discuss early Israelite goddess figures (pp. 83-97), the interpretation of prehistoric female figurines in general (pp. 22-45) and examples from Malta in particular (pp. 148-63), and iconographic evidence for a 'Mother Goddess' in North-West Europe in the Neolithic period (pp. 164-79), and in the Iron Age and Roman periods (pp. 180-95). Throughout there is a salutary emphasis on the questioning of assumptions and essentializations, and a clear exposition of the interpretational problems inherent in the material. Overall the contributors' conclusions tended to confirm my scepticism about the existence of any original matriarchal order presided over by a Mother Goddess, but the volume does bring to attention a wide diversity of individual goddesses represented, and sometimes demonstrably worshipped, by the ancient societies in question. ?

University of Leeds EMMA J. STAFFORD V. KARAGEORGHIS: Greek Gods and Heroes in Ancient Cyprus. Pp. 334, map, 237 ills. Athens: Commercial Bank of Greece, 1998. Cased. ISBN: 960-7059-08-5. This is an exquisitely produced volume destined, with its large print, lavish photos, and glossy paper, for the intellectual coffee table. Commissioned by the Commercial Bank of Greece, the book sets out to provide a broad survey of Greek gods and heroes in ancient Cyprus for the general public, with an emphasis on the more accessible 'visual aspects of the evidence' (p. 10). K. is, of course, eminently qualified for such a task, with nearly forty years of published work on Cypriot archaeology, and he manages to convey a fair amount of scholarship despite the popular format, with frequent references to ancient literature and suggestions for further reading; a catalogue provides full details of the 237 illustrations. The book is arranged chronologically, beginning (pp. 15-35) with the earliest possible evidence for the 'immigration' of Greek mythology to Cyprus on imported Mycenaean pottery, followed by the first statues of anthropomorphic deities, which coincide with the arrival of Achaean settlers in the twelfth century B.C. The tenth to seventh centuries see the 'acclimatization' of many Greek gods and heroes in Cypriot art (pp. 37-63), under the combined influences of Greek epic poetry and Phoenician trade; representations of Herakles especially demonstrate the mingling of Greek, Egyptian, and Near Eastern stylistic traits in a developing Cypriot iconography. A central chapter covers the sixth to fourth centuries (pp. 65-159), a period K. characterizes as one of 'a revival of Greek consciousness' (p. 66) in the face of Persian domination, but also of some cultural assimilation with Phoenicia. Representations of Herakles again provide a case study, with an identifiable Cypriot type compared to a more strongly Greek-influenced variety; other familiar Greek gods and heroes appear in a wide variety of media, some pieces being associated with specific cult places, e.g. of Athena, identified with the Phoenician Anat, at Idalion. Also included in this chapter is a survey of Greek gods and heroes on Cypriot coinage down to the Roman period, with some very fine examples, especially from the Bank of Cyprus collection in Nicosia. The second half of the book (pp. 161-293) covers the Hellenistic and Roman periods, when Cypriot art was subject to the same cosmopolitan influences as the rest of the Mediterranean world. In addition to major deities (Athena, Artemis, Apollo, Aphrodite, Zeus, Hermes, Dionysos, Asklepios, Herakles), many minor deities are represented, including several personifications. A final section surveys Greek gods and heroes on mosaic floors, featuring some beautiful examples, especially from Nea Paphos. For the most part K. resists the temptation to make political capital out of the theme of the 'Greekness' of ancient Cypriot religion, though the wealth of material presented does go some way towards excusing his concluding flourish that the island experienced a 'final triumph of hellenization' (p. 297).

The Heritage of Greece: Ancient, Byzantine and Modern, the theme of a 1996-7 lecture series at Ball State University, is that which binds this very diverse collection of papers together. Of the ten contributors, only three, J. Griffin, M. Lefkowitz, and M. Mazower, actually presented their papers during the 1996-7 lecture series. The remaining contributions, delivered in previous years at Ball State, have been included because of their relevance to the theme. The editor, John A. Koumoulides, has divided the collection into four main sections: Ancient Greece, The Byzantine World, Greece in Transition, and Greece: The Modern Era.
