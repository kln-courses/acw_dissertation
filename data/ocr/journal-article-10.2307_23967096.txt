Translation of books of the Hebrew Bible into Aramaic for liturgical purposes must have begun before the Christian era, as the Targumic fragments preserved among the Dead Sea Scrolls indicate; and it continued apace during at least the following millennium, as generations of synagogue readers (meturgeman is the professional title) wrote down their renderings and passed them on to their successors who revised them and in turn produced their own. We now possess, not counting the Scrolls fragments, several and sometimes scores of Targum manuscripts for every biblical book except Daniel and Ezra-Nehemiah (passed over per haps because they were themselves partly written in Aramaic), but not all have yet been collated and issued in critical editions; and by no means all are available in English translation. It is to fill the latter gap that The Aramaic Bible has been produced. The Aramaic text is not included, but in the introduction and footnotes to each volume enough information is given on textual matters to enable the expert to assess where each editor stands and to encour age students who have access to an Aramaic edition to try their hand at the original language. But the series is chiefly aimed at a wider readership interested in the progress and distinctive marks of Jewish biblical interpretation and not least in its influence on the New Testament and on early Christian exegesis. The transla tions usefully distinguish between places where the meturgeman is faithfully rendering the Hebrew text and places where he para phrases or makes additions to bring out the meaning and applica tion for his Jewish audience, the latter being printed in italics. It</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 209 is, of course, the paraphrases (e.g. to suppress anthropomorph isms) and the additions (e.g. where is is pointed out that such and such a passage is really talking about Torah) that will especially attract the majority of readers, as they compare and contrast rabbinic hermeneutics and theology with early Christian. The volumes will yield plenty to occupy them. The three books translated and annotated in this volume belong to the Writings, the part of the canon least used in Jewish worship. It is probably for this reason that there is on the whole less interference from the meturgeman than in other more prized books. The editors of the sections on Job and Proverbs base their transla tions, wisely I think, on one manuscript, while the editor of the section on Qohelet produces an eclectic text based on a variety of manuscripts; but all insert the more important variants in foot notes. There are helpful summaries of the interpretative and theo logical characteristics of each Targum. As one might expect, the sentiments of Qohelet were not exactly welcomed by the Rabbis, and changes are many. But though the same could be said of Job, the Targum to that book is surprisingly literal. The Proverbs Targum also tampers little with the Hebrew text, but perhaps Proverbs was already congenial enough. I mention a few render ings which struck me as I leafed through the volume. Job 1: 21 brings in the favourite parapharase 'Word' to avoid speaking of God's direct action—'The Memra of the Lord gave and the MemraMemra of the Lord has taken away'—yet in many another grue some picture of God in action, as in 9: 17 ff. or 16: 7ff., no discomfort seems to have been felt. Job 5: 7 has 'For a man was born to labour in the Law', spoiling a magnificent text. Job 5: 17 slips in a nice preaching point: 'and you, Israel, do not reject the chastisement of the Almighty.' Prov. 8: 30 has 'a faithful hand maiden' instead of the masculine 'master workman' of the Hebrew. Eccles. 3: 9 is extensively reworked in a positive direction: 'what advantage does a working man have who labours to make treasures and and to gather money, unless he is helped by providence from above.' As is Eccles. 12: 12: 'And more than these, my son, be careful to make many books of wisdom without end and to occupy yourself with with words of Torah.' The typically Jewish desire to get on in the world and the equally typically Jewish love of learning are not going to be compromised by the Preacher's pessimism. We should be grateful to the editors of this and the other volumes in this splendid series for opening our eyes to the many delights—and biases—contained in these ancient versions of Scripture. J. C.
