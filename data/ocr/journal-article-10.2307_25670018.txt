<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews Peirce s Philosophy of Religion. (Peirce Studies, No. 5.) Michael Raposa. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1989. Pp. x + 180. $25.00. Relatively few Peirce scholars have dealt with the religious dimension of his thought. Articles have been published on specific aspects of Peirce's re ligious thinking, but these are far outnumbered by writings on other areas, such as logic, metaphysics, and semiotic. Of course, scholars who have examined Peirce's metaphysics have attempted to come to terms with the role of his concept of God. But only one book-length treatment of any of Peirce's religious concepts, Donna Orange's Peirce s Conception of God, has appeared. Raposas book is the first attempt to reconstruct Peirce's philosophy of religion as a whole. In much the same way that other interpreters have taken themes such as Peirce's categories (Esposito), cosmology (Murphey), and logic of science (Skagestad) as focal points for understanding Peirce's thought as a whole, Raposa argues that religious concepts and concerns are central to Peirce's philosophical system. The thesis is impressively argued, and for this reason Raposa's work is an important contribution to Peirce scholarship. The book is also valuable in that it frames and articulates several issues in Peirce's philosophy of religion that have already become controversial and that are certain to generate a great deal of further investigation and debate. I will return to these issues later in this review. Raposa begins his inquiry by affirming that "the apparent diversity of THE JOURNAL OF SPECULATIVE PHILOSOPHY, Vol. VI, No. 1, 1992. Copyright ? 1992 The Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA. 87</page><page sequence="2">88 THE JOURNAL OF SPECULATIVE PHILOSOPHY Peirce's writings belies their essential unity, the architectonic, even organic quality of his philosophy" (p. 6). This organic character entails that all aspects of Peirce's philosophical system are so related that each aspect will, in some respect or other, undergird the system as a whole. The core of Raposa's argument is that religion is one of these aspects and that religious concepts underlie many of the most important tenets of Peirce's philosophy. As he states (p. 6), "In a sense, Peirce's religious ideas are less adequately conceived as constituting a part of his thought than as supplying an illuminating perspective on the whole of it. Indeed, they are among those guiding purposes by means of which 'the whole calls out its parts.'" Raposa investigates five areas of Peirce's thought that underscore the systematic character of his philosophy of religion. These are the relation between religion and science, the religious significance of Peirce's objective idealism, evolutionary cosmology, esthetics, and the role of Musement in what Raposa calls Peirce's "theological semiotic." Raposa finds a close connection between Peirce's view of religion on the one hand and his objective idealism and concept of scientific method on the other. Religion is identifiable with "an idea and with the growth of that idea" (p. 11), and the interpretation of that idea requires a church, or a community dedicated to the idea's nurturing and actualization. There is thus for Peirce a strong link between the religious and scientific commu nities. It can even be speculated, Raposa hints, that "in their commitment to the truth, to the whole of reality, scientists and genuinely religious persons could be understood as perfectly united" (p. 12). Raposa devotes a great deal of discussion to the role of synechism in Peirce's religious thought. He argues that Peirce uses the principle of continuity as the basis for his concepts of God, religious knowledge, and immortality (p. 41). Peirce's emphasis on the continuity of the universe leads him to reject personal immortality, since there can be no absolute individuals in a continuous universe (p. 111). It also renders his theory of evil highly problematic, since he identifies individuality as the locus of evil (pp. 88-92). One puzzling aspect of Peirce's religious thought is that he speaks both of Absolute Mind and of God. In MS 857 he states that "whether there be an Absolute or not, it is nothing like God" (quoted in Raposa, p. 54). Raposa provides a complex argument, rooted in Peirce's mathematical discussions of the nature of the continuum and in his commentaries on Royce's concept of God, for the position that the concepts of God and Absolute Mind (which Peirce sometimes calls "universal mind") have different meanings</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 89 in Peirce's religious thought, and that their relation is that of a supreme to a subordinate being, both of which are nonetheless equally real. There are two very important implications of this position for Raposa's interpretation of Peirce's concept of God. The first is that he views Peirce's distinction of God and Absolute Mind as a semiotic issue. He states (p. 61): "... Peirce construed the relationship of the Absolute Mind to God in semiotic terms, that is, as the relation between a sign and its object." The Absolute Mind functions as the sign in the relation because it "is that one incredibly complex general idea that renders intelligible everything that exists; its reasonableness is 'concretized' in the actual universe, even though it continues to embody possible further determinations beyond all multitude" (p. 26). But the concept of Absolute Mind is philosophical, and therefore relatively precise; it is not sufficiently vague or anthropomorphic to be an adequate interpretant for the concept of God, which Peirce identifies with the creative source of all reality, even though Absolute Mind is a "living symbol" of God (p. 68). The God-concept, Peirce maintains, is best interpreted through feeling (pp. 57-58). The second implication of Raposa's emphasis on synechism is the rejec tion of the process interpretation of Peirce's concept of God. Peirce's rejection of nominalism entails the affirmation of infinite possibilities; thus for Peirce, "a finite God is no God at all" (MS 318, quoted in Raposa, p. 21). Raposa also appeals to Peirce's formulation of the continuum to argue that his notion of God cannot be pantheist. ". . . [T]he continuum and its singularities are not the same 'sorts' of things at all. They are of different dimensionalities or, to put it metaphysically, they occupy different 'levels of reality' " (p. 51). Raposa's theistic interpretation of Peirce's God enters strongly into his discussions of religious knowledge and its relation to cosmology. Here he is especially concerned with investigating the notion of the aesthetic sum mum bonum as the form in which God is revealed to persons. Although this analysis is meticulously presented, it is not entirely convincing. Raposa argues that the process interpretation of Peirce's God is "at odds with Peirce's own tendency to affirm those divine attributes traditionally as cribed to the Deity by classical theists (CP 6.452, 6.508-10)" (p. 91), and that "[e]ven the vague ascription of purposes to God should not be under stood to entail that God literally 'grows'" (ibid.). Raposa's position appears to be that Absolute Mind, the emergent symbol of God, grows, but God as Creator does not (see p. 108). But this interpretation leaves unresolved several anomalies in Peirce's thought on</page><page sequence="4">90 THE JOURNAL OF SPECULATIVE PHILOSOPHY the matter. For example, it is not at all clear that Peirce's account of the creation of the universe supports an unmoved rather than an evolving mover. And if, for Peirce, "[t]he laws operative in the natural world are themselves, ultimately, ideas in the mind of the Creator (CP 5.107)," it is hard to see how Peirce could avoid a preformist theory of evolution in which evolution would amount to a series of cosmic "discoveries" of the divine ideas. This criticism is not intended to detract from the value of Raposa's book. If anything, it underscores the primary difficulty of doing Peirce scholar ship, that of reconciling what appear to be incompatible or even contradic tory aspects of his thought. The process account of Peirce's God-concept, after all, tends to neglect precisely those texts upon which Raposa builds his argument. Raposa's discussion sharpens several issues in a debate that is still far from being resolved. Perhaps the most important part of Raposa's book, both for Peirce scholars and for philosophers of religion, is his discussion of the Neglected Argument. Raposa argues that the Neglected Argument is an exercise in what he calls "theological semiotic" or "theosemiotic." According to this view, the world is a symbolic representamen of divine purpose. The Ne glected Argument constitutes an interpretation of the world as God's "argument" or "great poem" (p. 167 n. 3). This interpretation begins with the process of Musement, a free medi tation on the universe out of which the idea of God as the surnmum bonum of human life naturally emerges. Thus, Raposa maintains (p. 144), "... Peirce's theory of inquiry supplies the rubric for what is, in essence, a complex theological method. That method commences with an act of interpretation, a reading of the signs that are presented in human experi ence, proceeds with the exploration and clarification of that interpreta tion, and then with its utilization as a rule for living, a habit of action." In the Peircean philosophy of religion, then, religious knowledge is funda mentally a matter of sign interpretation, and the relation between religious meditation, theological inquiry, and moral practice is one of continuity (P- 153). Raposa's book ought to be read by anyone who is interested in American philosophy of religion. It is not the final word on Peirce's religious thought, but it is valuable for its careful articulation of Peirce's theological semiotic and its convincing argument for the centrality of religious concerns to Peirce's philosophical system. Although much of Raposa's analysis depends upon a theistic concept of Peirce's God that is open to question and leaves</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 91 certain tensions in Peirce's cosmology unaccounted for, the resolution of this difficult issue in Peirce's thought cannot be expected in a single preliminary work. The next stage in the inquiry that Raposa begins in his book would be to extend his discussion of Peirce's theosemiotic to contemporary issues in theological hermeneutics, particularly those concerning the interpretation of sacred texts and the symbolic relation of the world (and its communities) to the divine. The work for which Raposa paves the way promises to be fruitful, and it is hoped that he will continue in this endeavor. Felicia E. Kruse Xavier University</page></plain_text>
