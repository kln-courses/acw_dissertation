<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bobcat, Virginia Voight. 80pp. $5.95. Dodd, Mead &amp; Co., 79 Madison Ave., New York 10016. 1978. (Grade 5 and up) Bobcat is a fictional account of Stub Tail's first year of life from kittenhood to independence. His experiences with his parents, sister, and other woodland animals give readers information about bobcats and their environment. Of special interest are the momentary encounters with a sensitive young boy. Although slightly anthropomorphic, the book contains enough realism to justify its recommen- dation as a penetrating insight into the behavior of bobcats. The mood and action of the story are well-captured by the pencil drawings. John Plank</page></plain_text>
