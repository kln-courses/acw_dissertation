<plain_text><page sequence="1">FILMS IM All Right Jack (Savoy), made by the Boulting Brothers, satirises he social texture of England. Industrial executives are cynically crooked: lip-service to the "export-or-die" policy conceals robber-baron morals. The workers, blandly unaware of national ideals, are cynically self-seeking where it is a question of more lolly for less work. The result?precipitated by the Oxford trained neophyte to the working class (Ian Carmichael) unproficient in the art of going slow?is a general strike, paralysing Britain, which the directors have seen fit to treat as a comedy in the English manner. That manner?so infuriating to foreigners?is to laugh at disaster in the apparent belief that it is thus annihilated. The film, then, falls between two stools. The unhappy mixture of realism and farce gives the impression of flippancy. The farcical sweet-factory sets, representing anthropomorphic machines, would be funny perhaps in a pure farce. They are discordant in a film like this alongside imaginative studies of grimy claustrophobia, idiotic tawdriness and criminal stupidity. The tensions between trade unions and executives cannot be mocked at and taken seriously in the same breath. The human misunderstandings behind the struggle are too saddening to allow jokes. The actual class problem (the evolution of a new tyranny based on money power not on U-value) is not funny at all. Peter Sellers's masterly portrait of the shop-steward, Kyte, puts an end to jesting. Because Sellers started as a "comic" it should not be presumed that he is one still. His recent performances make corrosive comments on modern mores. Very many film-actors rely on a good director, a clever photographer and lighting for their reputation. Sellers's art is his own and frightening. His Kyte is an exact and terrifying impersonation of the purblind, ignorant little man exercising puny power in a key-position. He studied this part from the life at trade union meetings and trade unionists do not like his portrait. Wielding enormous power, as they do, trade unions must expect severe criticis n: one of the drawbacks of responsibility. It should be seen, too, that one of the hazards of a so-called democratic world is that Kytes exist not exclusively in trade unions but in every walk of life and that our destinies may fall into their bureaucratic hands. Sellers's Kyte is, of course, sanctimonious: tyrants always use the shibboleth. Kyte's socially perilous ignorance shows itself in his maJapropisms, his slavish following of the book of rules and his self-important, authoritarian strut. The contemplation of this typical product of the managerial age is depressing.</page><page sequence="2">CHRONICLE 115 The satire of Fm All Right Jack is unfair because the boss-class, in the person of Mr. Carmichael, emerges morally superior and important. On the facts of the film, either everyone should be condemned or Sellers should accompany the disgusted Carmichael to the nudist Thebaiad. Is this England? Judging by recent articles and films, the English seem to be growing more and more afraid that it is. About two thousand people were delighted by the Irish Film Society's Dublin showing of Hiroshima Mon Amour. It was the most interesting film seen here since Wild Strawberries. It was also profoundly immoral although not corrupting for mature people. The themes?the fragility of life and memory, the terror of love, the ineificacy of loveless sex?were dealt with seriously. The French and Japanese photography was fresh. Marguerite Duras' script was spare and intelligent. Alain Resnais and his editors worked to a significant rhythm: image blended into image at the right time and speed. The story was told, by flashbacks, with intriguing indirectness that enlivened the intelligence without baffling it. First, a back and a hand?like monumental mobile granite?of two screen-size lovers are faintly seen. These are either figures of universal myth or the French girl in the arms of her husband or her latest paramour: or perhaps both at once. The feeling is given by Dylan Thomas's lines: "And the lovers lie abed/With all their griefs in their arms. . . ." The spectral lovers speak English which melts into French for the second part: a flashback to Hiroshima where the Girl has a love affair with a Japanese Boy in the recent past. This is conventionally idyllic to start with but a posture of the Japanese reminds the Girl of her first love, in war time, for a German soldier in France. For this her compatriots shaved her hair. The punishment did not greatly hurt her. She had already been hurt beyond repair by being with the German boy as he died slowly of a wound. She had felt the warmth going out of his body as her own girlish emotions withered from too much sorrow. She has been henceforth neurotic. She cannot commit herself to a man who attracts her: she cannot love. She dare not love in a world where love can be killed. This helpless feeling is intensified in Hiroshima by memories of the A-Bomb, by leukemia wards, by monstrous births. The Girl?who was always one to chase boys?has chosen to forget her horror in a series of uncommitted sexual adventures with chance acquaintances. The Japanese Boy is the latest amour de rencontre. She refuses to love him because, for her, sex must remain a mere functional necessity. With difficulty she succeeds in</page><page sequence="3">116 THE FURROW holding aloof and, in spite of a moment of tenderness on which the film ends, continues her tragic and monstrous existence. This is the pagan, existential humanism of Camus and Sartre for whom Man is an Absolute facing a lightless world. Existential art, if it is honest (like Hiroshima Mon Amour) always ends in heart-breaking despair and nausea. Absolute Man is absolutely impotent and, yet, he can look nowhere else for help. Absolute Man is, in fact, a monstrous, psychological impossibility: to be sane he must remain a creature relative to the salvific God. Black Orpheus (Astor), directed by Marcel Camus, is a brilliant (although noisy and tiring) documentary of carnival in Rio. It is constructed around a modernisation of the Orpheus myth which, apart from the descent to the Underworld, is only moderately successful. J. C. KELLY Belvedere College, Dublin</page></plain_text>
