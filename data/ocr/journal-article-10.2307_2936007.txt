<plain_text><page sequence="1">SCIPIONIC THEMES IN PLAUTUS' AMPHITRUO G. KARL GALINSKY University of Texas As the only extant example of mythological comedy and, at the same time, of a parody of tragedy, the Amphitruo of Plautus holds a unique place not only among Plautine comedies, but within all ancient litera- ture.' In meaningfulness and subtlety it ranks among the first of Plautus' comedies, and its considerable success, besides being attested in ancient times, is testified to by the extent and variety of its huge literary progeny.2 As for most Plautine plays, contaminatio has been posited for the Amphitruo. However, the alleged inconsistencies and struc- tural illogicalities for which Plautine analysts3 criticized the play have proved to be largely imaginary. The play is very well unified indeed. I E. Fraenkel, De media et nova comoedia quaestiones selectae (Diss. Gbttingen I9I2) 33, note 2: "in nulla, quantum e fragmentis cognosci potest, Graeca fabula argumentum mythologicum tam integre tractatum erat quam in Plauti Amphitruone."

KARL GALINSKY [I966 That the content of the Amphitruo requires a more thoughtful approach and interpretation than the " typical" Plautine comedy4 is suggested by its careful structural design which bears a striking resemblance to later, classical works of literature such as Vergilian and Horatian poetry. As a result, the skilful "architecture" of the play has rightly been stressed by the critics. Before we look at the play as a whole, an example in parvo may illustrate this point: Sosia's lengthy battle description (203-6I). The passage is emblematic of Plautus' technique in general. A consider- able number of parallels suggest that the messenger speech in Euripides' Heracleidae (799-866) served as its model.5 At the same time, style and diction are thoroughly Roman, and thus the account has been inter- preted as a document of Roman political thought, since, for the first time in Roman literature, it emphasizes the clementia of the victorious Romans and the superbia of the enemy.6 On the basis of style, met- rics, and content it can be divided into three distinct sections :7 i. the events preceding the battle (203-I8) 2. the battle itself (2I9-47) 3. the last phase of the battle, and its consequences (248-6I) This tripartite arrangement thus focuses, as it should, on the battle proper. The structure of the first section again reveals a surprising symmetry. The first eight lines (203-Io) deal with Amphitruo's actions and his initiative in offering peace, while the final eight (2II-I8) describe the Teleboan reaction as well as the ensuing preparations for the battle. These i6 lines may be divided in yet another way into three subdivisions: the central panel often lines (206-I5), describing the peace negotiations and their failure, is flanked by two sections of three lines each, which deal, respectively, with Amphitruo's initiative (203-5) 4 Shero 2I5, note I9, in particular stresses the unique features of the Amphitruo and thus modifies, to some extent, the views of G. E. Duckworth, The Nature of Roman Comedy (Princeton I952) 24. See P. Siewert, Plautus in Amphitruone quomodo exemplar Graecum transtulerit (Berlin I894) 22-29, and Genzmer 44. 6H. Haffter, "Politisches Denken im alten Rom," RFIC 68 (I940) I07 ff. The most recent analysis, with references to earlier bibliography, of the Roman elements in style and diction is by G. Pascucci, "La scelta dei mezzi espressivi nel resoconto militare di Sosia (Plauto, Amph. I86-26I)," Atti e memorie dell' Accademia Toscana di scienze e lettere "La Colombaria" 26 (I96I-62) I6I-203. 7 I have modified here the arrangement proposed by Genzmer 2I.</page><page sequence="3">Vol. xcvii] THEMES IN AMPHITRUO 205 and the actions resulting from the failure of the negotiations (2I6-i8). This latter arrangement seems to be preferable for two reasons. First, it does not disrupt the unity of lofty prayer style which characterizes lines 206-I5. Second, Plautus makes use of this tripartite framework pattern especially in the cantica.8 Similarly, the third section (25o-6i) has a threefold arrangement.9 Lines 250-52 deal with Amphitruo's aristeia. He slays Pterelas, and in 260-6I he thus receives his just reward, the golden trophy. Flanked by three lines each, the central part of this section (2s3-59) primarily describes the surrender of the Teleboans. Very much in keeping with the theme of this play, in which both gods and men participate, they surrender divina humanaque omnia. The tripartite structure of this third section (250-62) is an additional argument in favor of a similar subdivision of the first (203-I8); the arrangements of these two pas- sages are too similar to be purely coincidental. The first and third major divisions have a total of 29 lines, which is the exact length of the focal section (2I9-47). The structure of the entire play is equally balanced and symmetrical.IO At its center is the controversy between Amphitruo and Alcumena (ii.ii),I" which is framed by the two encounters of Alcumena and Jupiter. This triptych, in turn, is flanked by the meetings of Sosia and Amphitruo with their respective divine doubles. Finally, the early part of the first act, which focuses on Sosia's description of the battle, and the entire fifth act correspond to each other in many ways: Bromia's soliloquy is the counterpart of Sosia's; the human events and 8 See, e.g., Genzmer's (23) division of Sosia's complaint (I53-75), and F. Leo, Die plautinischen Cantica und die hellenistische Lyrik (Berlin I897) II0, who subdivides Chrysalus' canticum in Bacch. 640-70 as follows: (a) Chrysalus boasts of his deeds (640- 48); (b) he elaborates on his ideal, the clever slave (649-6I); (c) he discusses the specific case, sees his master, and addresses him (662-70). 9 Mercury's aside (248-49) as well as 262, which is no longer related to the battle description, are, of course, not to be counted. IO See Friedrich (above, note 3) 276-78, whose basic arrangement I have expanded by adding the Heracleidae-Heracles panel, which is central to my argument; cf Genzmer 2I4. II It is ironical that it was precisely this very core of the play that was singled out by Leo for being inconsistent with in.i and other parts of the comedy. Leo's hypotheses were rejected immediately by B. Prehn, Quaestiones Plautinae (Breslau I9I6) 8I ff. It is not surprising, I believe, that ii.ii, to an even greater extent than Sosia's battle description, is the most Romanized and Plautine part of the Amphitruo; for a detailed analysis, see Genzmer I24 ff.</page><page sequence="4">2o6 G. KARL GALINSKY [I966 Amphitruo's heroic exploits are-thereby reflecting the movement of the play-replaced by and juxtaposed with the divine events and the deus ex machina at the play's end. Amphitruo, who is at the pinnacle of success in Sosia's description, lies prostrate on the ground in v; and whereas boat caelumfremitu virum (233-34) in the early part of the play, heaven itself thunders and frightens men in the last: strepitus, crepitus, sonitus, tonitrus ... ubi quisque institerat, concidit crepitu (I062-63). The tone of both passages is rather solemn, full of pathos, and strongly in- fluenced by the language of tragedy and epic.I2 The scene which is modelled on the Heracleidae passage thus is linked with the one relating the birth of Heracles. Finally, a threefold division also suggests itself for Act v; in its first part (I053-76) Bromia dominates, then our interest focuses on Amphitruo (I077-II30), untilJupiter's domineering appearance brings this act and the play to its conclusion. The struc- ture of the Amphitruo may, therefore, be illustrated as follows: Soliloquy of Sosia: human events; Heracleidae; Amphitruo victorious (I86-26i) Mercury meets Sosia (262-498) Jupiter and Alcumena (499-550) AMPHITRUO AND ALCUMENA (633-860) Jupiter and Alcumena (86I-983) Amphitruo meets Jupiter (I03 5-52, and most of the fere 300 versus qui exciderunt) Soliloquy of Bromia: divine events; birth of Heracles; Amphitruo prostrate and then adfectus inmortali gloria (I053-II46) The architecture of the play is carefully planned and, in all respects, the product of a superior craftsman. The reason for this elaborate ar- rangement, in my opinion, is that it serves to implement the content; the play's meaning can be expected to have a significance that is out of the ordinary and thus justifies its deliberate and artistic design. In a recent article, Z. Stewart has tried to demonstrate, with many valid arguments, that Euripides' Bacchae influenced the Amphitruo to a considerable extent.'3 Some of the parallels Stewart draws may not be very conclusive; for instance, the aedes in the Amphitruo does not I2E.

Most cogent, however, is Stewart's analysis of the Bacchic aspects of the play as well as Friedrich's thorough comparison of the characters of Pentheus and Amphitruo, men "who have no sense or taste for the miraculous and for the incalculable workings of the gods, who explain everything to themselves in terms of human categories, who believe everyone who relies on demonic interventions to be an impostor and who nevertheless, in spite or even because of their very intelligence, miss the truth."Is Stewart's discussion of the implications of this imitation is concerned, as so many Plautine studies have been, with Quellenforschung rather than with analyzing the Plautine play in its contemporary setting. Aided again by many strong arguments, Stewart converts Vahlen's conten- tion that Rhinthon's Amphitruo could not have been Plautus' original into its exact opposite. A few doubts remain nevertheless. The statement in Stephanus Byzantius concerning Rhinthon's dramatic technique reads: ra -rpayLKa uE-rappvOlW EUv es-To yEAo lOV. This does not necessarily mean that it was tragedies which were transformed into something humorous. Long ago, 0. Crusius pointed out that the most important feature of the hilarotragoidia may equally well have been " the scurrilous representation of heroic figures, even though this may often have been done by imitating a famous (literary) model."'6 Further, it should not be underemphasized that both notices about Rhinthon explicitly associate him with the phlyax;I7 i.e. even if he was '4 See Duckworth (above, note 4) 83: "The dwelling might be considered a palace since the play is a tragicomoedia, but Plautus refers to it as aedes (97), the word which he regularly uses for the homes of ordinary citizens." I5 Friedrich (above, note 3) 27I; cf Z. Stewart, "The God Noctumus in Plautus' Amphitruo," JRS 50 (I960) 3 7-43, where he defends his "Bacchic" view of the play by interpreting the reference to Nocturnus (line 272) as Nyktelios, an epithet of Dionysus.

KARL GALINSKY [I966 the archegos in transforming ta tragika into something humorous, the spirit of the finished product was still akin to Doric folk drama and raucous slapstick farce. The Amphitruo is removed from this kind of comedy by a gap that cannot be bridged over by the term "Exalted Rhinthonica."I8 The admirable consistency of the delineation of the characters of both Alcumena and Amphitruo, as well as the sympa- thetic knowledge of the female psyche, presuppose true New Comedy ingredients.I9 But why the overtones of dignity and profundity that are so frequent in this play? What is the reason for Plautus' extra- ordinary artistry and almost solenm concern with the themes of this play? The answer to this can hardly be found in its Greek ancestry, but must be sought in its Roman milieu and setting. To an even greater extent than the artistically inferior Miles Gloriosus, the Amphitruo can be assumed to be relevant to Plautus' contemporaries.20 Although Plautus' debt to the Alcumena Euripidis probably was more extensive than to the Rhinthonic Amphitruo,2' Amphitruo is the hero in Plautus' play. He figures prominently in the action of a tragicomoedia which is characterized by the constant and baffling interplay between myth and, as it were, historical reality and between divine and human planes. The same characteristics apply to the life and legend of Scipio the Elder, the most important and the most controversial politi- cal figure in Plautus' times. Some Scipionic overtones of the play have been noted casually by some scholars,22 but what needs to be studied in more detail is the relationship between the play and the con- 18 A. Palmer, The Aniphitruo of Plautus (London I890) xv, followed by Stewart 372. However, the characterization given to the play by Palmer in the next paragraph seems to be more adequate; see below, note go. 19 Genzmer; cf Duckworth (above, note 4) 24. 20 Cf J. A. Hanson, "The Glorious Military," in Dudley and Dorey (above, note 2) 6I. 21 Of all the pre-existing Alcmena and Amphitryon plays, Euripides' drama seems to have influenced Plautus' most; see Shero 194 if. This conclusion is further supported by the proximity of the performance dates of the Latin Alcumena Euripidis and the Amphitruo; see Stewart 36o-6I. 22 L. Herrmann, "L'actualite dans l'Amphitryon de Plaute," AC I7 (I948) 3I7-22 Herrmann goes too far in identifying Sosia with Ennius and construing the play as an anti-Scipionic pamphlet. More careful, though much less detailed, is J. Hubaux, Les grands mythes de Rome (Paris I945) 82: "Si Tite-Live dit vrai quand il ecrit que, du vivant meme de Scipion, on racontait que sa mere l'avait conqu des oeuvres de Jupiter, on peut se demander si l'Amphitryon de Plaute n'etait pas une comedie d'actualite." Cf. Hanson (above, note 20) 6o.</page><page sequence="7">Vol. xcviij THEMES IN AMPHITRUO 209 siderable epigraphic and literary evidence relating to this man. I be- lieve that this information explains some of the play's features and, more importantly, that it illuminates the peculiar way in which Plautus chose to treat the Amphitruo theme. A convenient point of departure is found in the prologue. One of the vexed questions concerning this prologue is the part lines 64-95 play within it. The tirade against ambitus, it seems, has nothing to do with the theme of the Amphitruo. Although excursus of this kind in Plautine prologues are not surprising, the considerable length of this one is unusual and militates against the view that Plautus is con- cerned merely with theatrical ambitio. The passage cannot simply be athetized; the first part of the prologue culminates in it, and it is well prepared for by lines I7-20, 24-25, 33, 38-40 and 5o.23 Nor can Mercury's vehement criticism of ambitus be construed as a narrow political reference, for instance, to the lex Poetelia of 358 B.C. (Livy 7.I5.I2-I3). For this lex interfered only with the machinations of the candidates, but not with the ones of their middlemen. The next lex de ambitu was the lex Cornelia Baebia of i8I B.C. (Livy 40.I9). Apparently this law stipulated the death penalty for men guilty of ambitus;24 thus a reference to it would considerably impair the humorous effect of these lines, which, in spite of Mercury's solenmity, are also comic in tone. A further objection, of course, is Plautus' assumed death in I84 B.C. The ambitus passage, then, is the first passage in this play to exemplify the spirit of tragicomoedia. This admonition is placed imme- diately after the nature of the play has been made clear; from this it follows that the admonition passage has a close thematic connection with the play. Plautus wants his intent to be taken seriously; at the same time, the alliteration points to a parody of some lofty pronounce- ment (74-75): quasi magistratum sibi alterive ambiverit. virtute dixit vos victores vivere. 23 See the excellent discussion by K. Abel, Die Plautusprologe (Diss. Frankfurt i955) 3I-39, esp. 37-39. Lines I7-95 are generally accepted as the primary Plautine addition to the prologue of his Greek model. The sole reason for this addition is Plautus' concern with ambitus. 24 So G. de Sanctis, Storia dei Romani IV.i (Turin I923) 495, and H. H. Scullard, Roman Politics 220-150 B.C. (Oxford I950) 172; cf. G. Rotondi, Leges publicae populi Romani (Milan I9I2) 22I, 277.</page><page sequence="8">2I0 G. KARL GALINSKY [I966 Placed at the exact center of the prologue, line 75 gives a further clue. Around 200 B.C.,25 the Scipionic family, reaching unprecedented fame and prominence, chose to reinscribe the sarcophagi of the somewhat less famed L. Cornelius Scipio Barbatus, who had been consul in 298 B.C., and of his son, L. Cornelius Scipio, the consul of 2S9 B.C., who had conquered Corsica. Until that time, the epitaphs had been written with red chalk; now they were chiseled into the stone after they had been elaborated into Saturnian verse. The point most important for our investigation is that, following Greek custom, the titles of the magistracies were added, among them some which Barbatus' son actually had never held. Moreover, when the senate had to choose the man who was to welcome the statue of the Magna Mater of Pessinus in 204 B.C.,26 the Delphic oracle counseled that a vir optimus should be chosen. The choice fell on P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica, but the title bonorum optimus was promptly given to Lucius to whom it had never applied. Virtus, forma, facta, and sapientia coupled with fortitudo be- came the key words of the Scipionic tomb inscriptions, thus reflecting clearly the influence of the Greek concept of kalokagathia (Degrassi 309.2-3, 3II3-7, 32..2-5, 3i6.I-2): Gnaivod patre prognatus fortis vir sapiensque quoius forma virtutei parisuma fuit. brevia honos fama virtusque gloria atque ingenium quibus sei in longa licuisset tibe utier vita facile facteis superases gloriam maiorum. 25 This is the generally accepted date of the elogia, which was established first by E. W6lfflin, "De Scipionum elogiis," RPh I4 (I890) II3-22, and id., "Der Dichter der Scipionenelogien," SBAW(I8q2) I88-2I9. The latter article is the most comprehensive discussion to date of the literary aspects of the elogia. The attempt of F. W. Fay, "Scipionic Forgeries," CQ 14 (I920) I63-7I, to prove that the inscriptions were archa- izing creations of the time of Caesar was convincingly rejected by T. Frank, "The Scipionic Inscriptions," CQ i5 (I92I) I69-74. I have followed the text of A. Degrassi, Inscriptiones Latinae Liberae Rei Publicae i (Florence 1957) nos. 309-I7 (= CIL VI I284-94). Cf J. Vogt, "VorlIufer des Optimus Princeps," Hermes 68 (I933) 84-92. 26 Good accounts of the implications of this episode are given by S. Aurigemma, "La protezione speciale della Gran Madre Idea per la nobilt'a romana e le leggende dell'origine troiana di Roma," BCAR 37 (I909) 3 i-65, and H.

For various reasons, which I believe to be valid, the composition of the epitaphs is ascribed by most scholars to Ennius.27 That Plautus and the Roman populace were quite familiar with these inscriptions-for it was hardly the Scipios' intention to keep their propaganda secret-may be deduced from the Miles Gloriosus where Plautus several times plays with these terms in a not unintentional manner.28 At the very beginning of the play, Artotrogus character- izes the proud soldier with the following words (9-I2): stat propter virum fortem atque fortunatum et forma regia. tum bellatorem-Mars haud ausit dicere neque aequiperare suas virtutes ad tuas. The emphasis on forma and virtus and fortitudo, as well as the strongly competitive element (Mars haud ausit dicere etc.), are, as has been recog- nized, strongly reminiscent of the Scipionic elogia (esp. Degrassi 3II.3-4, and 3I6), but there is also an echo of Ennius' epigram on Scipio (Cic. Tusc. 5.I7.49): a sole exoriente supra Maeotis paludes nemo est quifactis aequiperare queat. Later in the play Pyrgopolinices' virtutes appear as facta allied with virtus (57, I042, cf. 620). "Scipionic" also is MG I25I where Acro- teleutium says of the miles: si amavit umquam aut si parem sapientiam [hic] habet ac formam. 27 See especially W6lfflin (above, note 25) SBAW I892, 207 ff. The poet's referring to the Romans as vos ties in well with Ennius' acquiring Roman citizenship only in I84 B.C. 28 Hanson (above, note 20) 59-6I. For a thorough study of the connotations of virtus in Plautine comedy see D. C. Earl, "Political Terminology in Plautus," Historia 9 (I960) 235-43.</page><page sequence="10">212 G. KARL GALINSKY [1966 Even more pronounced are lines 55-57 of the same play: quod omnes mortales sciunt, Pyrgopolinicem te unum in terra vivere virtute et forma et factis invictissumis? The alliteration here is the same as in Amphitruo 75. Finally, in the Miles, Sceledrus' reference to his family tomb (372-73), scio crucem futuram mihi sepulcrum ibi mei maiores sunt siti, pater, avos, proavos, abavos, may not be purely coincidental in this play. In Amphitruo 75, Plautus thus exhorts the Romans, who are referred to as victores-a term which certainly was bound to evoke the vic- tories won by the Scipios-to engage in virtus, which was yet another topical concept associated with the Scipios. In the very next line, Plautus warns the Romans against ambitio, which was another quality the Scipios displayed by engaging in a sort of posthumous ambitus: they promoted their ancestors to offices they had never actually held. The central sentence of the prologue then concludes with a reference to the summus vir, a term which applies to nobody more aptly than to the foremost of the bonorumn optimi.29 Moreover, in the Trinummus there is a similar nexus of ambitio and virtus, and two passages (I030 ff. [esp. I034] and 642 ff.) have been given a convincing Scipionic interpretation.30 Further, an amplified version of line 75 of the Amphitruo occurs in the Cistellaria prologue (I97 ff.) and a Scipionic allusion has again been suggested for that passage.3' 29 For good comments on Scipio's stature, see R. M. Haywood, Studies on Scipio Africanus (=Johns Hopkins Univ. Stud. in Hist. and Pol. Sciences 5i.i, Baltimore I933) i8, and Herrmann (above, note 22) 322: "Ainsi, dans le prologue, l'allusion a un summus vir qui se livre a la brigue (v. 77) ne peut viser ni M Fulvius Nobilior ni M Manlius Vulso, mais le vainqueur de Zama, aureole d'une gloire et d'un prestige bien superieurs." Following Stewart (36I and note 46) and others, I lean toward a late date for the Amphi- truo, i.e. after I90 B.C., which thus would coincide with Scipio's "principate." A survey of scholarly opinions conceming the date of the play can be found in K. H. E. Schutter, Quibus annis comoediae Plautinae actae sint quaeritur (Groningen I952) Xii-XXxii. Most scholars favor a late date. 30Earl (above, note 28) 235-38, and T. Frank, "Some Political Allusiolns in Plautus' Trinummus," AJP 53 (I932) I52-56. 31 T.

Buckler (Manchester I939) 85-88.</page><page sequence="11">Vol. xcvii] THEMES IN AMPHITRUO 213 It is important for the interpretation of the Amphitruo passage, I be- lieve, to note that it is Jupiter himself who insists legem esse (73). Jupiter earlier had been said to have deserved well de vobis et de re publica (40), and, as in 73 ff., this statement is followed by an alliterative (42) line which anticipates 75: ut alios in tragoediis vidi, Neptunum,32 Virtutem, Victoriam. Plautus then proceeds to call Jupiter the architectus omnibus (45), archi- tectus being a term which, especially in the Miles, connotes clever and unscrupulous manipulation. Jupiter and Scipio are thus related to each other in the same context, and to both an ambivalent terminology is applied. This Plautine association ofJupiter with a Scipionic context suggests a parallel in that part of the Elder Scipio's life which is commonly known as the Scipionic legend, and which very much appealed to the imagination of the Roman populace. One outstanding characteristic of this legend is Scipio's close association with Jupiter. As early as 206 B.C., after falling seriously ill at New Carthage and after consider- able difficulties with his troops, Scipio vowed a sacrifice of oxen to Jupiter Capitolinus. In the speech which, according to Livy (28.28.I i), he made to his troops on that occasion, Scipio hardly humbled himself before the god: si ego morerer, mecum exspiratura res publica, mecum casurum imperium populi Romani erat? Ne istuc Iuppiter Optimus Maximus sirit, urbem auspicato dis auctoribus in aetemum conditam huic fragili et mortali corpori aequalem esse. After the defeat at Cannae, Scipio is said to have prevented a mass exodus from Rome by calling not on Dius Fidius, but on Jupiter Optimus Maximus (Livy 22.53.1I). Another aspect of this tradition is that Scipio every day before dawn, without the dogs barking at him, went to the temple ofJupiter Capitolinus and there communicated with the god in a mysterious way.33 The legend then developed so far as to ascribe to Scipio-the only legendary or historical Roman hero so 32 For the association of Scipio with Neptune, see Polyb. IO.II.7, I4.I2; Livy 26.45.9. 33 A discussion of this aspect of the Scipionic legend can be found in Hubaux (above, note 22) 76-88; Haywood (above, note 29) 9-44; H. H.

KARL GALINSKY [I966 honored-descent from Jupiter. There is some evidence that his family regarded the Elder Scipio as more than human and may even have introduced the non-Roman concept of heroization into Rome. It has been pointed out that Africanus and his brother, who both spent some time in Sicily, may have acquired some of these un-Roman conceptions there.34 Further, the tomb of the Scipios has many Etruscan features and may suggest that the Scipios adhered to Etruscan religious ideas.35 More definite evidence is the letter of Cornelia,36 Scipio's daughter, to her son Gracchus, in which she says: " ubi mortua ero, parentabis mihi et invocabis deum parentem. in eo tempore non pudet te eorum deum preces expetere, quos vivos atque praesentes, relictos atque desertos habueris." The deus parens, of course, is Scipio the Elder. Finally, Scipio's image was not set up in the family tomb, but in the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus (Val. Max. 8.I5.2; Appian, Hisp. 23; Livy 38.56.12-13). Before discussing further aspects of this legend and their application to the Amphitruo, let me return to the prologue which in many ways sets the tone for the whole play. It would be doing an injustice to Plautus' wit to equate either Jupiter or Amphitruo with Scipio and thus find the key to the cleverness of the play. Rather, Amphitruo and Jupiter both take on Scipionic aspects. The dramatic confusion between the two thus is significantly heightened. Nor can we expect from a study of the Scipionic references in the play a resolution of its REL 3I (I953) iii-i6; L. R. Taylor, The Divinity of the Roman Emperor (Middletown I93I) 4I, 53 ff. See also note 67, below. 34 For more detail on this and the next two points of my discussion, see Haywood (above, note 29) 2I-22. 35 P. Nicorescu, "La tomba degli Scipioni," Ephem. Dacorom. I (I923) I-56, esp. 45 ff. But I cannot agree with Haywood (p. 22) that this makes "it seem probable that the family was of Etruscan stock and persisted in Etruscan ways of thinking." Livy 28.45.I3 ff. proves no more than that the Comelii had influence in Etruria, perhaps in the form of clients, and a political following eager to drive the Carthaginians out of Italy and bring the war to Africa. It does not even suggest that the Cornelii were from Etruria. Furthermore, there is no attestation of even an etruscanized form of L. Cornelius in Etruria. See M. Fowler and R. G. Wolfe, Materials for the Study of the Etruscan Language (Madison I965); H. Rix, Das etruskische Cognomen (Wiesbaden I963) 296.

Plautus cer- tainly did not commit himself to becoming, as has been argued, a deeply serious anti-Scipionic pamphleteer of the Catonian faction.37 The Scipionic allusions are not rigorously applied to one character, but are used rather more subtly to intensify the atmosphere peculiar to this tragicomoedia, i.e. especially the continual interaction between the divine and human protagonists. That the joke is not entirely on Scipio is suggested by lines 39-40, which apply to Jupiter as well as to the Scipios: meruimus et ego et pater de vobis et de re publica. The interplay between Jupiter and Amphitruo actually begins in 27, where Mercury introduces Jupiter as being rather human, after all: humana matre natus humano patre. Strictly speaking, this line refers only to the human actor playing the role of Jupiter, but there seems to be something more to it, and it has been taken, for instance, as evidence for the influence of Greek anthropomorphic conceptions on Roman religion.38 But it may simply mean that the present-day Jupiter,39 Scipio, is no more than a mortal. Shortly thereafter Plautus says the play cannot be a comedy because reges and di appear in it (6i). The status to which the Roman populace tried to elevate Scipio (Livy 38.56.I2; cf Polyb. I0.38.40) is not much different: "castigatum enim quondam ab eo populum ait, quod eum perpetuum consulem et dicta- torem vellet facere; prohibuisse sibi statuas in comitio, in Rostris, in curia, in Capitolio, cella Iovis poni." Scipio was readily compared to reges (cf. Livy 28.41.I5; 30.30.1); regia thus is a fitting epithet to de- scribe theforma of the Miles (MG io). Further, the alliteration and the play on victores ... vivere which is found in Amphitruo 75 has a parallel in Livy's account of the beginning of the Scipionic trials: si quidem victa Carthago victum Hannibalem in exilium expulisset, Roma victrix victorem Africanum expellat (38.50.7).40 37 So Frank (above, note 30) I 56, whereas he (above, note 3 I) interpreted the Cist. passage as indicating Plautus' initial approval of the Scipionic philhellenism before the playwright became disillusioned.

KARL GALINSKY [1966 The conclusion of Plautus' exhortation is ambiguous (76-77): qui minus eadem histrioni sit lex quae summo viro? In fact, the histrio and the summus vir, Scipio, both pretend to be Jupiter, and thus the same law applies to them indeed. The next line contrasts virtute with the favitoribus. The same contrast occurs in Livy's account of Scipio's Iberian campaign; Scipio exhorts his soldiers: favete nomini Scipionum (26.41.22), but throughout his account Livy is at pains to stress virtus as the factor that is most decisive for the Romans' success (26.41.12, 25; 48.14; 49.15). The fides of people who shoulder a responsible task is also frequently connected with Scipio by Livy (e.g. 26.41.25; 28.34.3; and especially 26.50.5, where Livy may actually play with Scipionic terminology: etformafaceretfidem). After a Scipionic context has thus been suggested, Plautus announces: ipse hanc acturust Iuppiter comoediam (88). The comic point of this remark may be that Scipio will be in this play, although not exclusively in the role of Jupiter. Further, in the light of the preceding lines (86-87), mirari nolim vos quapropter Iuppiter nunc histriones curet; ne miremini, the implication may be that Jupiter, because he is travestied by Scipio, now has to become histrio himself. As a result, Jupiter in Amphitruonis vortit sese imaginem (121). The recurrent emphasis on imago (124, 141) as well as the suggestion that the imago is carried (ego fero hanc imaginem, 141) is reminiscent of the plans the Roman populace had for Scipio's imago (Livy 38.56.I3 "prohibuisse, ne decerneretur, ut imago sua triumphali ornatu e templo Iovis maximi exiret"; Val. Max. 4.I.6: "voluerunt imaginem eius triumphali ornatu indutam Capitolinis pul- vinaribus applicare.") Later in the play, Plautus associates Sosia's imago even more clearly with a funeral mask (458-59).4I The phrase- ology applied to the god who changes something divine into something human (in Amphitruonis vortit sese imaginem I21) is paralleled closely by 41 See Sedgwick (above, note i) ad loc. I have not been able to find the expression imaginemferre elsewhere. J. A. Hanson suggests that the phrase histriones curet in Amph. 87 could refer to a Scipionic magistracy where ludi were given. The most fitting occasion would be the splendid games celebrated by L. Scipio in i86 (Livy 39.27.8-io).</page><page sequence="15">Vol. xcvii] THEMES IN 'AMPHITRUO 2I7 Livy's description of Scipio who, conversely, hoc cura ac ratione com- pertum in prodigium ac deos vertens (26.45.9), prepares for the "miracu- lous" attack on New Carthage. While consorting with Alcumena, Jupiter gleefuliy plays the miles gloriosus, a role which, as we have seen, Plautus had purposely asso- ciated with the Scipios (I35-39): ibi nunc meu' pater memorat legiones hostium ut fugaverit. quo pacto sit donis donatus plurumis. ea dona quae illic Amphitruoni sunt data apstulimus: facile meu' pater quod volt facit. By far the most important of these gifts is the patera aurea (260), which Amphitruo wins from Pterelas and which then is spirited away by Jupiter. The passage, I submit, may well be Plautus' comic adapta- tion of an episode which Livy found in his sources and narrates in 26.50.9-13.42 Scipio there protects the chastity of a Spanish maiden, while Jupiter is here explicitly referred to as moechus (I 35), a charac- teristic role for the miles gloriosus (MG 775, 924; cf. 90). The grateful Spanish father offers Scipio a magnum auri pondus as a donum (Livy 26.50.ioIii), which Scipio graciously-facile meu' pater quod voltfacit- gives away to the girl's fiance: aurumque tollere ac sibi habere iussit (26.50.I2; cf. apstulimus in Amph. 139). The boy thus receives super dotem dotalia dona, and he is laetus donis honoribusque dimissus domum (26.5o.I2-I3). As a result, he praises Scipio as a dis simillimum iuvenem (26.50.13); about the appropriateness of this phrase for the Amphitruo nothing need be said. The gift which Mercury has conferred on the audience is pax (Amph. 32): propterea pace advenio et pacem ad vos fero. This is the very function that was often entrusted to the Scipios (Livy 30-40I4-sI5; cf. 30.43.3-4, 8, I0; 45.I): si condiciones convenirent pacis, tribuni plebis rogarent utrum consulem an P. Scipionem iuberent pacem dare ... si pacem per P. Scipionem dari atque ab eodem exercitum deportari iussissent, ne consul ex Sicilia in Africam traiceret. 42 A second passage that may be echoed in Amph. I35-39 is Ennius, Ann. 202 (in a virtus context): "Dono, ducite, doque volentibus cum maLnis dis." 8 + T.P. 97</page><page sequence="16">2I8 G. KARL GALINSKY [I966 Finally, Mercury concludes the prologue by emphasizing that erit operae pretium spectantibus (iSi) to see this spectacle starring Mercury and Jupiter. This phrase occurs only in one other Plautine prologue:43 in MG 31-32 Artotrogus remarks: ne hercle operae pretium quidemst mihi te narrare tuas qui virtutes sciam. But these virtutes, as we have seen, at the outset had been characterized as Scipionic (IO-12), and perhaps the Amphitruo passage intentionally recalls the Miles prologue. Stewart has rightly pointed out that the theme of madness and drunkenness is given much emphasis in the Amphitruo, and thus he sees in these references one of the most important links between the Amphitruo and the Bacchae.4 A theme, however, that is equally as important is that of waking and dreaming. The earliest reference to it is associated with the drunkenness theme, credo edepol equidem dormire Solem atque adpotum probe (282), but the contrast between waking and dreaming soon is made more explicit, and the latter state is repre- sented as being caused by the gods, whereas the former is caused by man. The theme of waking and dreaming thus reflects the tension between the divine and human levels which dominates the play (297-98): nunc propterea quod me meus erus fecit ut vigilarem, hic pugnis faciet hodie ut dormiam. This reference is reinforced by Sosia's fear that Mercury will cruelly put him to sleep (305-6; cf. 304): quattuor viros sopori se dedisse hic autumat: metuo ne numerum augeam illum. He then emphasizes that continuas has tris noctes pervigilavi (3 i4). Near the end of this scene, Sosia has his doubts whether he really is awake (407), although he later vehemently defends himself against Amphi- truo's charges (620-24): AM. sed quid ais? num obdormivisti dudum? So. nusquam gentium. AM. ibi forte istum si vidisses quendam in somnis Sosiam. 43 The operae pretium passages are listed and discussed by A. A.

A similar accusation becomes the keynote of Amphitruo's exchange with Alcumena (696-98) :45 AM. haec quidem deliramenta loquitur. So. paullisper mane, dum edormiscat unum somnum. AM. quaene vigilans somniat? AL. equidem ecastor vigilo et vigilans id quod factum est fabulor. After some more references to sleeping (701, 726) and waking (726), Sosia concludes: somnium narrat tibi (738). Two more themes are prominent in the Amphitruo. One is Amphi- truo's eager pursuit of glory. In Sosia's description of the battle Amphitruo is depicted as the hero who accumulates all the honor a mortal can possibly reap. His ambitious heroism manifests itself first when the hostile city is stormed (I9I-92, I96): id vi et virtute militum victum atque expugnatum oppidum est imperio atque auspicio mei eri Amphitruonis maxume. ... ductu, imperio, auspicio suo. The Scipios at times also chose to emphasize the virtus of their soldiers (Livy 26.4I.I2; 48.14; 49.IS), and the imperio atque auspicio formula has a counterpart in Livy where it is often associated with the Scipios: " hoc maxime modo ductu atque auspicio P. Scipionis pulsi Hispania Cartha- ginienses sunt" (Livy 28.I6.I4; cf. Amph. 657: "eos auspicio meo atque [in]ductu primo coetu vicimus"). More importantly, Amphi- truo is in charge throughout the battle (204, 2I2, 2I6, 242). He achieves a feat paralleled only by Romulus, Cossus, and Marcellus: "ipsusque Amphitruo regem Pterelam sua obtruncavit manu" (252). Consequently, "ob virtutem ero Amphitruoni patera donata aurea est." Like a Scipio, he emerges from this victory inexplebilis virtutis (Livy 28.17.2); he is cast in the role of the returning hero who expects honor, gloria, and a triumph. Plautus, however, takes pains to point out how greatly he is humili- ated. The reason is, of course, that, just as Amphitruo dominated the 45 In 697, the themes of waking, dreaming, and drunkenness are combined, but it is the antithesis between waking and dreaming that is emphasized; cf. Terence, Andria 971-72.</page><page sequence="18">220 G. KARL GALINSKY [i966 battle, so Jupiter is in charge throughout the play; moreover, he under- cuts and thwarts Amphitruo's aspirations at every turn. Speaking to Alcumena, he thus mockingly echoes what had been said about Amphitruo (534 ff.). The reversal of Amphitruo's fortunes is brought about most clearly in the last scene: he lies prostrate on the ground. Now he accuses himself of being insanus while all the other characters, including Alcumena, explicitly are called sani (i084),46 and the verbal echoes of the battle description underscore this reversal even more (see above, pp. 205-6). The glorious general Amphitruo now has to acknowledge the might of the summus imperatorJupiter (I I2I), and ex- plicitly asks him for peace (I I27).47 But instantly, as soon as Amphi- truo has realized how feeble mortal glory is and how quickly it can be shattered, Jupiter promises to give him true immortality, for Hercules "suis factis te inmortali adficiet gloria" (I I40). The same connection betweenfacta and the ascent to immortality is made in Ennius' epigram on Scipio, which I partially quoted earlier: a sole exoriente supra Maeotis paludes nemo est qui factis aequiperare queat. si fas endo plagas caelestum ascendere cuiquam est, mi soli caeli maxima porta patet.48 The realization of the littleness of human glory and, resulting from this realization, the promise of true, divine immortality, as well as the motif of waking and dreaming, are pivotal themes in the Amphitruo. As A. J. Festugiere has shown, these are exactly the three chief themes of Cicero's Somnium Scipionis.49 The theme of dreaming, complemented by references to waking, supplies the framework of Scipio's tale: deinde me ... qui ad multam noctem vigilassem, artior quam solebat somnus complexus est .... fit enim fere ut cogitationes sermonesque nostri 46 The passage escaped Stewart's notice, but gives added testimony to the thorough integration of the Bacchic motif into the thematic structure of the Amphitruo. Amphi- truo thus has to recognize what Alcumena said in 730: sana et salva sum. 47 This harks back to the prologue (32): "propterea pace advenio et pacem ad vos fero." 48 Lact. Inst. I.I8.Io. 49 A.

What Scipio should strive for is soon pointed out: immortality, which is the reward of good services rendered to the state (3.i6, 8.26, 9.29). This insistence on patriotic virtus is definitely one of the Roman characteristics of the Somnium, and the Varronian precedent of this con- ception has rightly been pointed out.5' Yet the earliest formulation of this very conception occurs in Ennius, who viewed virtus as the pursuit of personal prominence in the service of the state. Furthermore, Plautus' concept of virtus was much the same as Ennius', which in turn is implicit in the Scipionic elogia.52 The remark Scipio addresses to Aemilius in the Somnium (8.26), ego vero, Africane, siquidem bene meritis de patria quasi limes ad caeli aditum patet, quamquam a pueritia vestigiis ingressus patris et tuis decori vestro non defui, nunc tamen tanto praemio exposito enitar multo vigilantius, thus is full of verbal and conceptual reminiscences of the elogia and Ennius' epigram (mi ... caeli porta patet). Lasdy, human gloria is be- littled in the Somnium (3.i6, 7.23-25). As in the Amphitruo, it is only the gods who can save man from oblivione posteritatis (7.25). This inmortalis gloria (Amph. I I40) is very different from the praemiis humanis (7.25), which lead to neither aeterna nor diuturna gloria (7.23). Virtus as defined by Ennius and Plautus comprises primarily three aspects: it emphasizes gloria, res publica, and the proper standard of conduct.53 Amphitruo certainly lives up to the principles of this virtus. There is nothing wrong with his behavior except for one 50 There also are some striking verbal parallels between the Amph. and the Somnium, which are best explained by their common Scipionic context. Masinissa's introduction sets the tone (I.9): antequam ex hac vita migro; on migro see Ronconi's note and cf. Amph. II43.

KARL GALINSKY [I966 major flaw, which the model of the Bacchae helps to underscore: any- thing that is superhuman and divine and thus outside the limits of purely human gloria is curiously beyond his comprehension. Before he comes to the realization ofJupiter's power, therefore, he is attacked where he seemed to be most secure: his conception of virtus is brought into conflict with that of a character who is equally as Roman as he- Alcumena. She is portrayed as being more god-fearing than Amphi- truo (dis placitum 635, deum metum 84I, piam Io86).54 Her long monody (633 if.) culminates in a praise of virtus; later in the play, she refutes Jupiter's arguments by virtute (925), and it seems like an inten- tional ironic contrast with Amphitruo's Scipionic ideals that virtute and factis are named by her in one breath (925-26). The dramatic contrast between her conception of virtus, which Amphitruo completely fails to understand, and his, could not be brought out more strongly than by the scene which follows her monody. Alcumena ends her speech with this remark (65I-52): virtus omnia in sese habet, omnia adsunt bona quem penest virtus. Quem being masculine, the lines obviously refer to Amphitruo; he immediately steps onto the stage and, in the manner of a miles gloriosus, begins to extol his military virtus (655-57): praesertim re gesta bene, victis hostibus: quos nemo posse superari ratust, eos auspicio meo atque ductu primo coetu vicimus.55 But his conception of virtus obviously is inadequate, for in contrast to what Alcumena said about the man who has virtus, for him omnia non adsunt bona: Amphitruo is plagued by misfortune and mishaps until almost the very end of the play. There are further Scipionic themes in the Amphitruo. Sosia's long battle description has often been considered as being full of contem- porary allusions. As a result, most discussions have been vitiated by attempts to press identifications with a specific Roman battle or general 54 For some good remarks on Alcumena's pietas see J. A.

Livy 28.I6.I4.</page><page sequence="21">Vol. xcvii] THEMES IN AMPHITRUO 223 too hard and thus to date the play.56 It cannot be denied that the pas- sage contains some contemporary references, but one also has to realize that some features are obviously inventions.57 To give just one ex- ample: we have seen that only three instances are mentioned by the historians in which a Roman general slew the commander of the enemy. The Pterelas episode does not allude to any of these events, but belongs to the realm of fable, where this motif occurs frequently (e.g Theocr. 24.4-5; Apollod. 2.4.6-7). On the other hand, Mercury's interjection (248-49), numquam etiam quicquam adhuc verborum est perlocutus perperam: namque ego fui illi in re praesenti et meu' quom pugnatum est pater, is to warn the audience not to consider as purely fictitious what Sosia has said before.58 There thus is a definite possibility that the battle is patterned on one fought by the Scipios, the battle at Magnesia having been singled out by most scholars.59 At the same time, the emphasis on Jupiter's presence at the battle agrees well with the historians' con- tention that Scipio's strategy of battle was divinely inspired.60 Moreover, I believe that, when Plautus' Roman audience heard of Amphitruo's campaign against the Teleboae, they could not fail to associate this with the war against the Boii, especially since Plautus in an earlier play (Capt. 888) had punned on the name Boii. The Boian campaign had been brought to a conclusion by the consul P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica (Livy 36.38-42),6I and several of its more striking details 56 For a summary of earlier scholarship on this passage, see F. J. Lelievre, "Sosia and Roman Epic," Phoenix I2 (I958) 117-I8, and W. Hofmann, "Der Schlachtbericht in Plautus' Amphitruo (v. 203-6I)," FF 33 (I959) 207. 57 An eminently sound and perceptive discussion of these two strata in Sosia's monody is A. Traina, "De primo Amphitruonis cantico," Latinitas 2 (I954) I27-32. The canticum is neither wholly parodic, as was assumed by L. Halkin, "La parodie d'une demande de triomphe dans l'Amphitryon de Plaute," AC I7 (I948) 297-304, nor is it purely propagandistic, as is posited by Hofmann (above, note 56) 207-I0. 58 On the effect of numquam quicquam see J. Marouzeau, Traite de stylistique latine (Paris I946) II3; cf Pascucci (above, note 6) I96.

KARL GALINSKY [I966 coincide with those of Sosia's account. In both accounts, the excel- lence of the commanders is stressed (egregie pugnavit, 36.38.5; cf. Amph. I90-9I, 252, 260); the casualties of the enemy are enormous (36.38.6, 40.5, Amph. 236); the enemy is forced to surrender biduo post pugnam (38.40.3) or postridie (Amph. 256), and completely (38.38.7, Amph. 256 if.); both times the headquarters of the enemy are con- quered (36.38.7, 39.3-4, Amph. 2Io, 257). Among the spoils the Romans receive as a reward for their bravery Gallica vasa are singled out (36.40.II-I2), and so is the patera of Amphitruo (260). While Plautus certainly did not model Sosia's description exclusively on any one Roman battle, the correspondences between the two accounts suggest that Plautus may have drawn, for some of the realistic details, on an historian's account of Nasica's victory over the Boii.62 The assumption that Plautus indeed was thinking of a member of the Cornelian family when he wrote Sosia's account is further supported by the parallels F. Altheim discovered between this description and the one given by Livy at the end of Book 8 (8.38 i.).63 The correspon- dences are numerous and apply to content as well as to style and phrase- ology. Livy's account is obviously designed to give prominence to the skills of the Roman general. What is truly amazing, then, is that Livy, without giving any reason for so doing, admits that he is devia- ting from his main source and even from the Capitoline triumphal fasti, which mention the consul L. Fulvius as the commander victorious in this battle. The man Livy chooses instead is a member of the Cor- nelian family, A. Cornelius Arvina. It appears quite possible, then, that Livy knew that the canticum in the Amphitruo dealt with the exploits of one of the Cornelii Scipiones and thus chose it as a model for his praise of an earlier Cornelius. Arvina was appointed dictator in 322 B.C., not belli gerendi causa, but to be in charge of the ludi Romani, and perhaps this induced Livy to borrow from a Roman play the description of a battle in which Arvina was prominent. Finally, the note on 62 For the possibility of the Annales Maximi as a source see the Appendix. There are other possibilities as well, e.g. the history written in Greek by Scipio's son Publius. Publius is likely to have drawn on some pre-existing Latin accounts, which could possibly be found in the Scipionic family archives. 63 F.

In 8.40.4 he states: vitiatam memoriam funebribus laudibus reor falsisque imaginum titulis, dum familiae ad se quaeque famam rerum gestarum honorumque fallente mendacio trahunt; inde certe et singulorum gesta et publica monumenta confusa.64 Furthermore-and this is neglected by most scholars-the focal section of Sosia's report parallels in many ways a battle described by a messenger in Euripides' Heracleidae (see above, p. 204). One of the features of Euripides' play is that Heracles' divine ancestry is stressed, while no mention at all is made of Amphitruo.65 Moreover, although Leo's positing contamninatio for the play has to be somewhat modified, his basic assumption is still well worth taking into account.66 He argued that a play dealing with the "long night" of generation of Heracles and the deluding of Amphitruo had been combined with a perhaps coarser play about the deluding of Amphitruo and the birth of the sons. As often, this purely analytical approach to contaminatio has led to a complete neglect of its more important, interpretive aspect, i.e. why did Plautus choose to combine scenes from these two plays? The answer may be suggested from the viewpoint of dramatic empha- sis: there is a redoubled stress on the birth of Heracles. Let us see how this ties in with the Scipionic overtones of this play. In Roman literature, numerous passages occur, especially in Cicero, Horace, Silius Italicus, and Lactantius, which explicitly associate Scipio and Heracles.67 Perhaps the most revealing example comes from Lactantius, Inst. I.9.I: "Hercules, qui ob virtutem clarissimus et quasi Africanus inter deos habetur." Two points, I believe, are worth 64 Note the emphasis, in both Scipionic accounts, on "egregium exercitum" (8.38.i) and "egregie pugnavit" (36.3 8.5), and on "falsis imaginum titulis" (8.40.4) and "honestam honoratamque P. Scipionis Nasicae imaginem" (36.40.I0). Cf. Livy 30.45.7. 65 Shero I98. 66 A summary is given by Stewart 356-57. 67 For a list of passages and a discussion, see A.

Taeger, Charisma 2 (Stuttgart I960) 20-33. 8*</page><page sequence="24">226 G. KARL GALINSKY [I966 noting here. First, Lactantius is evidently referring to a literary tradi- tion in which Scipio had not only occurred in connection with Hera- cles, but Scipio must have been the main character, while Heracles and others were, so to speak, projected into him.68 Second, the concept of virtus probably was quite instrumental in bringing about this asso- ciation (cf. Cicero, Sest. I43), for both Heracles and Scipio worked for the common good and were hailed as benefactors of mankind. Thus heaven becomes their just reward, as Cicero, who is quoted by Lac- tantius (Inst. I.IOI.3), does not fail to point out: "est vero, Africane: nam et Herculi eadem ista porta patuit." In Horace's C. 4.8.I5 ff. Scipio and Heracles are associated with each other within a canon of demigods, among them Dionysus and the Dioscuri, but the identifica- tion of Scipio with Heracles is pushed farthest by Silius in the Punica. At the beginning of Book I5, for instance, the beardless youth Scipio ponders whether he should lead a Roman army to Spain. In a scene Anderson has fittingly called Scipio in Bivio,69 Virtus and Voluptas appear before him, so that he can choose between them. The answer of Virtus to Voluptas is rather illuminating (I5.69-II9): " quasnam iuvenem florentibus," inquit, "pellicis in fraudes annis vitaeque tenebras, cui ratio et magnae caelestia semina mentis munere sunt concessa deum? mortalibus alti quantum caelicolae, tantundem animalibus isti praecellunt cunctis. tribuit namque ipsa minores hos terris natura deos: sed foedere certo degeneres tenebris animas damnavit Avernis. at, quis aetherei servatur seminis ortus, caeli porta patet.70 referam quid cuncta domantem Amphitryoniaden? quid, cui, post Seras et Indo captivo Liber cum signa referret ab Euro, Caucaseae currum duxere per oppida tigres? quid suspiratos magno in discrimine nautis Ledaeos referam fratres, vestrumque Quirinum? 68 Cf.

There is no reason for assuming that Cicero, Silius, or Lactantius created the myth of the deified, Heracles-like Scipio. Rather than summarily dismissing the Scipio legend, as some scholars have done,7I as a literary exercise by later writers on the theme of the deified Alex- ander, one should differentiate between the core of the tradition, i.e. Scipio's apotheosis, and the purely adorning and embroidering attri- butes that were added to it in the course of its literary development.72 The following passage from Silius, for instance, shows clearly that the Scipio legend was not modeled in every detail on the Alexander legend. Pomponia is not compared to Olympias, but she is explicitly associated with Alcumena (I3.628-33): nullos, o nate, labores mors habuit nostra; aetherii dum pondere partus exsolvor, miti dextra Cyllenia proles imperio lovis Elysias deduxit ad oras attribuitque pares sedes, ubi magna moratur Alcidae genetrix, ubi sacro munere Leda. The marked emphasis on Heracles' divine birth in the Amphitruo may therefore well be more than a chance result of contaminatio. Similarly, the literary tradition dealing with Scipio's apotheosis ap- pears to be too well established to be merely conceived of as developing at random from the first century B.C. onwards. Rather, it is probable 7I Most recently, Classen (above, note 67) repeating the arguments of E.

KARL GALINSKY [I966 that, as Elter suggested sixty years ago, there must have been a man who, catering to the beliefs of the Roman populace and perhaps even encouraged by the Scipionic family, gave this tradition its first shape. This man most probably was Ennius. There are basically three reasons why this poet, as we know him, is likely to have regarded Scipio as a more than human being. First, "Ennius was not a Roman, but came from near Tarentum, a Greek region where hero cults flourished, and probably was educated at Tarentum."73 Second, he was such a close friend of the Scipios that he even was buried in their tomb. It is no coincidence, therefore, that the termsforma, imago, and facta recur and are emphasized in his own epitaph: aspicite, o cives, senis Enni imaginis formam. hic vestrum panxit maxima facta patrum. Nor may it be purely coincidental that Cicero, when speaking of Ennius' association with the sepulcrum of the Scipios, uses the metaphor in caelum huius proavus Cato tollitur (Cic. Arch. 9.22).74 Compare again Sceledrus' remark in the Miles (372-73): scio crucem futuram mihi sepulcrum; ibi mei maiores sunt siti, pater, avos, proavos, abavos. Third, Ennius considered Romulus as divine and, for all we know, was the first poet to speak of his entering into heaven (Ann. i.iio-i6). The literary tradition suggests that Ennius, after being successful in deifying Romulus, made an attempt to deify Scipio Africanus. Although the few fragments from Ennius' Scipio are inconclusive, we have the Suda's explicit statement that "Evvto&amp; . . .ZKt7r1`wva aSwv KaEt r tLEya rov avEpa -cEpV0t ovAoEVO. . .Kat KEOS! 7vpywcat. More importantly, lines I5-20 of Horace's C. 4.8, for good reasons, have been taken as referring to the Scipio. It is important, I believe, to quote them in their context (I3-20): non incisa notis marmora publicis, per quae spiritus et vita redit bonis post mortem ducibus, non celeres fugae reiectaque retrorsum Hannibalis minae 73 Haywood (above, note 29) 20. 74 Cf.

The lack of connection between I3-I4 and I5-I9 has repeatedly been bemoaned.75 I submit, however, that Horace, as his terminology clearly indicates,76 may well have been thinking of the Scipionic tomb inscriptions, and the transition to the facta of Scipio thus constitutes a natural train of thought. The thought sequence thus is this: the tomb inscriptions (written by Ennius) would not have been enough to im- mortalize Scipio, nor would his deeds by themselves have been suffi- cient. Only by a combination of these two, Scipio'sfacta, glorified by the Calabrae Pierides, could this goal be accomplished. It should be noted how well this antithetical design, which then is resolved into a synthesis, ties in with the thought structure of the other parts of the poem and the poem as a whole.77 Scipio's conviction of his own superhuman nature is clearly brought out in the epigram quoted before: si fas endo plagas caelestum ascendere cuiquam est, mi soli caeli maxima porta patet. While it is true that Scipio here speaks only of the possibility of be- coming immortal,78 the phrasing of the sentence reflects exquisitely what must have been Scipio's situation at that time: apotheosis is a Greek concept, which Scipio and Ennius already have implicitly 75 See Kiessling-Heinze ad loc. The attempt by C. Becker, "Donarem Pateras," Hermes 87 (I959) 2I2-22 to dismiss lines i5-ig as a later interpolation is too facile and forced to be convincing; see N. E. Collinge, The Structure of Horace's Odes (Oxford I96I) 60. Cf. Schanz-Hosius, Geschichte der rdmischen Literatur 2.I (Munich I935) 96: "Auf das Gedicht [the Scipio] bezieht sich wohl Horaz C. 4.8.20." 76 Kiessling-Heinze point out the parallels with Cic. Phil. I4.33. Cicero there speaks of the divina virtus of the soldiers who fought in the Punicis Gallicis bellis, and then con- cludes: "ita pro mortali conditione vitae immortalitatem estis consecuti." Hence the need for incisae litterae. Cf. Horace, Epod. 9.25-26. 77 See the discussions by Becker (above, note 75), Collinge (above, note 75) 68, and E.

KARL GALINSKY [I966 accepted and now try to make palatable to the Romans-si fas est.79 Perhaps the epigram thus is most fittingly read as a commentary on the Scipio, which has been dated as early as Scipio's return from Africa.80 Even if it was written at a later time, the ideas it reflected must have been current before; and this, I believe, is the backdrop against which the Amphitruo must be viewed. A few more observations may be added before a conclusion can be drawn. Line 739 is an old crux, since it is the only reference found in Roman literature or inscriptions to a Iuppiter Prodigialis. The phrase, in my opinion, does not refer to a Roman cult of Jupiter Prodigialis about which nothing is known.81 Rather, Plautus seems to have in- vented this epithet solely for a dramatic purpose. Jupiter was associated with incubation dreams (Curc. 226-69); prodigialis thus foreshadows the wondrous birth of the twins at the end of the play. The context in which the phrase is placed is one of waking and dreaming (experrecta es IO9; somnium I08), just as in Pomponia's account in Silius' Punica (ad requiem somnos I3.638; languentia lumina somnus 64I; nec me mutata fefellit Iforma dei 642-43). In the Punica, Jupiter is a material prodi- gium; he transforms himself into a snake. This story is not explicitly told in the Amphitruo, but a related motif is emphasized in the last scene: Hercules slays the two serpents.2 This may be foreshadowed83 by the term prodigialis. More generally, perhaps, the phrase means that Jupiter has all the characteristics of a prodigium: "something out- side the norm of nature, something at which we look with wonder and often with horror."84 This fittingly applies to Jupiter's portrayal throughout the play; at the same time, the contemporary character dis- 79 For the influx and reception of Greek religious ideas in Rome and the role of the Scipios, see W. W. Fowler, The Religious Experience of the Roman People (London i91 I) 335-56, esp. 340, 354-55. 80 The early date is advocated by J. Vahlen, Ennianae Poesis Fragmenta (Leipzig I928) xii f; for further discussion, see Schanz-Hosius (above, note 75) 96. 8I The existence of such a cult is postulated, on the basis of this line, by Riess (above, note 38) I58-59. 82 For Scipio's association with serpents, see Livy 26.I9.7-8, and Dio fr. $7.63; cf lIivy 38.58.7 on Scipio's divine birth.

Taylor (above, note 33) 55, who suggests that the soul-weary Roman populace regarded Scipio as something of a savior. 83 For the nature of this foreshadowing, see Duckworth (above, note 4) 22I. 84 Fraenkel (above, note 77) I6o.</page><page sequence="29">Vol. xcvii] THEMFS IN 'AMPHITRUO 23I tinguished by these qualities again turns out to be Scipio, in whose life prodigia and omens played such a large role.85 One final observation may be added. Although a libation bowl as a piece of loot is mentioned already in the earliest versions of Amphi- truo's exploits against the Teleboans,86 the exceedingly prominent and almost pivotal function of the patera in Plautus' play is surprising, but nonetheless deliberate.87 But one has only to go to Delos to find such tiaAat dedicated to the god by AEV'K tos Kopv4Atos' 2Kl7TlWV who thereby wanted to strengthen his claim on Trojan descent.88 This was considered a special aspect of his virtus. Similarly, the patera becomes the symbol of Amphitruo's virtus in the play. There again is no reason to believe that Plautus and the Roman populace had not heard of the dedications made by Scipio and the scions of several other noble families at the sanctuary of Apollo.89 The Amphitruo thus is a play with or on Scipionic themes without, however, offering a key to easy identifications. The parallels from Livy, Polybius, the Somnium Scipionis, and the Scipionic literary tradi- tion in general indicate that Amphitruo is endowed with many Scipionic traits, but there also are some analogies between the Elder Scipio and theJupiter of this play. For Scipio and his circle are known to have tried to introduce Greek religious and philosophical concepts, including that of apotheosis, into Rome. Scipio's role, in a sense, thus also is analogous to that of Dionysus in the Bacchae: he corresponds to the new and strange god, the Roman populace being too hesitant and sceptical to accept immediately the conceptions advocated by him. This, I believe, explains the presence of the Bacchic theme in the Amphitruo,90 and the Scipionic and Bacchic themes are well integrated. 85 Polyb.

KARL GALINSKY [I966 But the themes from the Bacchae again do not enable us to come up with straightforward identifications nor do they cast any light on Plautus' attitude toward Scipio's attempted apotheosis. Amphitruo, to be sure, is humbled in the course of the play. But this can hardly be taken as a criticism directed at Scipio, since Jupiter does not emerge as a wholly sympathetic character; while Amphitruo, quite unlike Scipio, resembles to some extent the sceptic Pentheus, who fails to comprehend the possibility of divine interference, Jupiter, to an even greater extent, is reminiscent of Dionysus the fiend.91 At the same time, as we have seen, Jupiter's role in this play in another respect parallels that played by Scipio in Rome. It is therefore impossible to establish a straight allegorical equation, and this intentional lack of dramatic resolution may well be traced back to the "riddle" of the Bacchae, which, in many ways, is a play with an open end. Finally, we should not construe as irony Jupiter's lowering himself to the level of a mortal and even of a histrio, while Scipio tried to elevate himself to the level of a god. For at the play's end, Amphitruo is promised to be graced with inmortali gloria, and thus the human and divine levels again are intermingled. Plautus did not want to moralize in the Amphitruo; as often, he was content to play with ideas that were in vogue at his time without wanting to hammer home a lesson. The themes which he drew on for the Amphitruo happened to be of a more serious nature: divine machinations, the impact of Greek religious ideas, the virtues of a Roman matron, the concept of apotheosis. It is not surprising, then, that the result is a tragicomoedia. APPENDIX: LIVIAN AND PLAUTINE PHRASEOLOGY Throughout this paper, I have adopted the view that the Scipionic legend is basically genuine, i.e. its central themes were developed during Scipio's lifetime, although there doubtless were later accretions.92 This view is altesten Literatur der Rdmer (Diss. Giessen I937) 35-36, says of Jupiter in the Amphitruo that "one has the feeling that he has to reveal his divinity any moment," a comment that would support the Scipio-Jupiter identification and also holds good of Dionysus in the Bacchae. At any rate, the Bacchic theme was relevant to Plautus' Roman times; Palmer has rightly called the Amphitruo the most Roman of Plautus' comedies: (above, note I8) xv. 9' I follow the interpretations of E. R. Dodds, ed., Euripides: Bacchae (Oxford I944). 92 Thanks are due to the anonymous referee provided by the American Philological Association, who was so kind as to direct my attention to the somewhat problematic</page><page sequence="31">Vol. xcvii] THEMES IN AMPHITRUO 233 shared by scholars whose treatment of the question I consider to be most judicious, as, for instance, Taeger and Scullard. Rather than repeat their arguments here, I should like to refer the reader to their detailed discussions of this point. The same assumption underlies my treatment of the literary tradition about Scipio in general. Undoubtedly there were later additions, but to deny the existence of its central themes in the period of Scipio's and Plautus' lives is no more than an argumentum ex silentio. Therefore I believe that to point out thematic parallels between the Amphitruo and the Somnium as well as some passages in Livy is defensible from a methodological point of view. Only in a few instances have I relied on phraseological parallels between Livy and Plautus. Sometimes they occur in a Livian context which is un- usual from a stylistic point of view; for instance, the use of alliteration in the Livian passages quoted on pp. 2I5-I7 is certainly out of the ordinary. Considering the subject under discussion, it is, in my opinion, not co- incidental either. In other passages in Livy such phraseological parallels or playing with the same key words suggests the question whether Livy could have found this material in a source contemporary with Plautus. The agreement between the two authors would then find an explanation. There is general agreement that Livy used the annalists Coelius Antipater and Valerius Antias in his third decade, besides Polybius, while in the fourth and fifth decade Claudius Quadrigarius and Valerius Antias were his sources in addition to the Greek historian.93 Of Coelius, we know that he was a careful researcher and drew, among other things, on family archives. The two Sullan annalists Antias and Claudius have often been criticized for their so-called annalistic inventions. But for all we know, they could avail them- selves of a source which was not even at Polybius' disposal: the Annales Maximi. The problems surrounding the publication of these eighty volumes in I22 B.C. are too varied and complex to be discussed here.94 Besides, they are well-nigh insoluble. Nothing is known about the earliest date of these records and about the exact nature of their contents. But they doubtless nature of the phraseological parallels in Plautus and Livy, and who made many other helpful suggestions. 93 For Livian Quellenforschung, see P. W.

KARL GALINSKY [I966 covered the period during which Scipio lived and, considering their volu- minousness, they must have contained a mass of detail. This impression is corroborated by the statement of Sempronius Asellio which Gelzer and Till,95 for very plausible reasons, have taken as referring to the Annales Maximi: scribere autem bellum initum quo consule et quo confectum sit et quis triumphans introierit ex eo bello, quaeque in bello gesta sint, iterare (id fabulas), non praedicare aut interea quid senatus decreverit aut quae lex rogatione lata sit, neque quibus consiliis ea gesta sint (iterare): id fabulas pueris est narrare, non historias scribere.96 I do not want to dwell on the aspect of the historicity of the Annales Maximi, which has recently been vindicated by Balsdon.97 It seems important, however, that they contained what an overly critical historian might callfabulae, such as accounts of a general's campaigns, and this, more than anything else, to me accounts for their bulk. It is hard to believe that eighty tomes of this kind should have been com- posed by Scaevola. It has rightly been pointed out that such a memorable feat would frequently have been mentioned by Roman writers.98 Rather, Scaevola was the editor; there is no reason not to assume that the versions dealing with the historical events of any given period were, in fact, com- posed during that period. For the time of Scipio and Plautus, this means that material which was contemporary with Plautus and Scipio found its way into the Annales Maximi. Now it has been demonstrated that, at least in one instance, Livy reflects very closely the phraseology of the annalist who happens to be his source.99 If the annalist, in turn, was drawing on the Annales Maximi, it is quite possible that material contemporary with Plautus and Scipio might have entered into Livy's writings virtually without any significant changes.I10 This must have been the case especially with the kind of terminology that recurred constantly in the exploits of a certain historical figure, such as Scipio, and thus became closely identified with him. This explains why Livy, at times, even might have been playing on this terminology, and it 95 M. Gelzer, "Der Anfang romischer Geschichtsschreibung," Hermnes 69 (I934) 47; R.

But the question is whether any possibility exists that Livy's phraseology reflects that of a historical source that is contemporary with Plautus and Scipio.
