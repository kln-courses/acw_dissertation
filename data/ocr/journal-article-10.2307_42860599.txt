It is no small order. The year 1979 not only marks the fiftieth anniversary of Vehlens death, but also bears witness to a climate of opin- ion perhaps as conservative as any since 1929. Ours is a time when in- tellectuals openly discuss the end of the liberal era, when neoclassical economic theory enjoys a prestige unparalleled since the heyday of An- drew Mellon, and when the public's conqept of social innovation finds its most articulate expression in California's Proposition 13. Not only is the current public mood hostile and apathetic to economic alternatives em- anating from the left, but social theorizing itself is looked upon as some- thing vaguely suspect - at best antiquated, at worst actively pernicious. Yet perhaps the current public mood is not a wholly inappropriate one for the half-century commemoration of Veblen's death. The brief periods when his social prescriptions have been in vogue have tended to render his message bland. As one of the most pungent critics of American cul- ture and the most consummately ironic of modern social thinkers, Veblen is best enjoyed as a voice crying in the wilderness; a thinker in opposi- tion silhouetted against a backdrop of apathy or conservative hubris. As Diggins (1978:viii) clearly states, his book "has to do with social theory in general, with Veblen serving as the central focus, and Marx, Weber, Tocqueville, Durkheim, Simmel, Sombart, Mead, and others pro- viding occasional comparative perspectives." While all of these thinkers provide points of comparison with various facets of Veblen's thought, the most extensive comparisons are made between the theories of Weber, Marx and Veblen, the three thinkers whom Diggins sees as the great so- cial theorists of industrial capitalism, each of whom approached the "problem'' of society through historical inquiry. Given the primacy of these three thinkers in Diggins' approach to comparative social theory, it is worth our while to consider the manner in which he compares Veblen with both Marx and Weber. The remainder of this article will then be devoted to a brief discussion of Veblen's place in intellectual history and to some neglected aspects of his social theory. Diggins chose Veblen's The Instinct of Workmanship and the State of the Industrial Arts as the focal point of his comparison of Veblen with Social Science Quarterly, Vol. 60, No. 3, December 1979 Â© 1979 by the University of Texas Press 0038-4941/79/030439-15$01.30</page><page sequence="2">440 Social Science Quarterly Weber and Marx. The Instinct of Workmanship, Diggins (1978:14) in- forms us, "may be read" as a work in which Veblen attempted to provide alternatives to "the three reigning social theories of his era," those of neoclassical economics, the Marxist philosophy of history and Webers thesis on the relationship of capitalism and the Protestant ethic. Working from the assertion that Veblen's thorough grounding in phi- losophy made him the only nineteenth-century American social scientist really capable of challenging the economic theories of Karl Marx on their own terms, Diggins proceeds to trace Veblen's critique of Marxism to its basic epistemological assumptions. Veblen's defense of Marxism against its superficial critics was followed by a thoroughgoing criticism of what he saw as the fruit of the dubious combination of the Hegelian idea of inner necessity and the English concept of national rights, both of which were untenable in the light of post-Darwinian science. Having discussed Veblens attack of the philosophical assumptions of Marxism, Diggins compares the manner in which Veblen and Marx each attempted, through an inquiry into the origins of property, to find an answer to the "riddle" of alienation. Marx speculated that alienation had developed out of the division of labor and the ascendency of private property. Veblen, however, was much more specific, and traced it back not only to a particular form of private property - the ownership of female captives - but also saw it as being psychologically grounded in the human propensities for both emulation and animism. Disclaiming any intent to espouse either the Veblenian or the Marxian answer to the riddle, Diggins (1978:61) does note that due to Veblens familiarity with late-nineteenth-century anthropological data, his grasp of the basic prob- lem was "different, and perhaps keener," than that of Marx. Taking as a point of departure the debatable thesis that The Instinct of Workmanship was indeed partially written as an attempt to provide an alternative explanation to Weber's thesis on the link between Protes- tant Christianity and capitalism, Diggins outlines what he sees as the major points of disagreement with the Weberian paradigm. Weber viewed modern capitalism as a recent historical development, a rational develop- ment predicated on the historical emergence of a particular type of re- lentlessly conscientious personality during the Reformation. Veblen, how- ever, who denied capitalism any historical legitimacy save that of the most recent incarnation of barbarism, saw it as an irrational orgy of waste and futility, carried out under the timeless barbaric auspices of force and fraud. Veblen's rejection of the Weberian link between Christianity and capitalism was based on his own belief that true Christianity and capitalism were incompatible as well as on the fact that Weber's argu- ment ignored the important role of science in capitalist development. Despite Diggins' stated opposition to the use of psycho-biographical techniques in intellectual history, one of the most fascinating aspects of his comparison of Veblen and Weber is his speculation as to the link</page><page sequence="3">NEGLECTED ASPECTS OF VEBLEN'S SOCIAL THOUGHT 44 1 between their views on work and their own personalities and lifestyles. It is suggested that Veblen's idealization of the instinct of workmanship was possible because he himself was "sluggish and lazy," and conscien- tiously eschewed both dull physical labor and academic ambition. Dig- gins (1978:117) suggests that Weber's view of work as mans irrational compulsion may reflect a lifetime spent laboring under a self-imposed workload of staggering proportions, the need for which seemed to spring "darkly from his own German Angst." veblen's generation of social thinkers Notwithstanding my serious doubts as to whether Veblen actually wrote The Instinct of Workmanship (or for that matter any of his works) in a conscious attempt to provide an alternative to Webers thesis on religion and capitalism, I am highly sympathetic to the manner in which Diggins presents Veblen in the company of Marx, Weber and other prom- inent nineteenth-century social thinkers. My own interest in Veblen, however, is chronologically a more modest one. It concentrates on Veb- len's contribution to social theory as a member of his own generation; that generation of social thinkers which H. Stuart Hughes (1958:17) referred to as a "cluster of genius," and who did the bulk of their work in the quarter century preceding World War I.1 With the single (and certainly noteworthy) exception of Marx, all of the greatest modern social theorists came to maturity and articulated the basic paradigms of their thought during those years. The works of the generation of Freud, Weber, Durkheim, Veblen and Pareto marked a break with previous social thought and established many of the basic parameters of modern social theory. Each of these thinkers, irrespective of the field that he worked in, may be seen as constructing anthropologi- cal paradigms in an attempt to fill the gaps created by the various turn- of-the-century intellectual crises. These concerned not only the underly- ing assumptions of what Dilthey termed "Geisteswissenschaften," but also many of those of the natural sciences. Given the turn-of-the-century mood of intellectual crisis, it is hardly surprising that Veblen's generation was one of transition for both dis- ciplines and institutions. In both Europe and America many of the greatest thinkers of that generation had changed or combined disciplines after an initial apprenticeship in a closely related field. As Kuhn (1962: 89-90) pointed out, usually, scientists who bring about a major paradigm change do so early in their career, before they have become thoroughly disciplined to the prevailing methodologies of that field. In the case of the social thinkers of Veblen's generation, it might be useful to augment 1 Hughes' use of the term "cluster" is borrowed from Kroeber (1944:10-16, 839).</page><page sequence="4">442 Social Science Quarterly Kuhn's theory with that of Erikson (1958:43, 100-104), who argues that many talented young people go through what he terms an adolescent moratorium, a time - sometimes delayed to their twenties and even early thirties - during which they work assiduously in some field that, though not their life's passion, often serves as a heuristic device for finding their life's work and themselves. A frequent result of this mora- torium is that when the young people find their career, they approach it with a well-disciplined mind and work habits but are free from the debilitating effects of what Veblen (1964:347) termed a "trained inca- pacity." This is probably the single largest reason why discoveries are seldom made by those inured to years of disciplined narrow vision. One sees this shifting of careers in Freud, who went from medicine to create psychoanalysis and engage in the grandest of anthropological speculations, and in Weber, whose early apprenticeship in ancient his- tory and law allowed him the knowledge and intellectual discipline to create a sociology combining the German traditions of history and philosophy with Anglo-French positivism. Pareto went from mathematics to economics before propounding his political theory dealing with the circulation of elites. Veblen's academic background was in philosophy, and even economics proved but a vehicle to expound his theory of social evolution. Veblen's was also an era of redefining and borrowing among different disciplines. As such, it is hardly surprising that the social theorists of this era constructed their paradigms by combining elements from as many as three or four previously existing disciplines. Freud (1961) founded psychoanalysis on a base consisting of nineteenth-century medi- cine and neurology, added a vocabulary taken from both mechanics and electronics, and even incorporated into his societal speculations a philo- sophical framework which was based on the assumptions of Kant and Schopenhauer.2 Also of rather eclectic origins was the social theory of Weber, which combined positivistic methodology with both the German historical school, as he learned it from his mentor Mommsen, and the philosophical assumptions of German idealism. If Durkheim's contribu- tion was less than that of Weber, it too represented combinations of pre- vious schools of thought. Durkheim's merging of Comtean positivism with Rousseau's concept of the general will, and the application of this approach to the study of relationships between religion, society and alien- ation, shows a similar willingness to borrow from diverse sources in order to create a paradigm where he perceived a conceptual void (Durkheim, 1966:47-75. 1938:96; LaCapra, 1972:3-8, 18-19). Pareto's wager on the structure of society borrowed freely from the Marxist notion of class 2 Freud's specific citations of Kant and Schopenhauer can be found in Freud ( 1950 :x; 1964:44, 91; 1960:41 and 1952:144).</page><page sequence="5">NEGLECTED ASPECTS OF VEBLEN S SOCIAL THOUGHT 443 struggle, but combined it with what he considered long and unjustly ne- glected Machiavellian truths, the combination of which he presented in a vocabulary at least partially drawn from his background in mathematics and economics (Finer, 1966:7-10, 13-15, 22, 32, 105, 117). Veblens intellectual career began in philosophy. His lifelong attraction to Kant was tempered by an extremely ambiguous relation to pragmatism as well as certain philosophical assumptions that seem to date back to Rousseau. Other philosophical assumptions, though growing out of the "back to Kant" movement that flourished at the end of the century, were actually drawn more from Hegel than Kant. Upon such a philosophical base, Veblen proceeded to construct his paradigm through the study of economics. Like the other thinkers mentioned, Veblen synthesized from various disciplines in order to articulate his paradigm of the general structure of society. Much of the best turn-of-the-century social thought owes its profundity to the fact that its authors formulated anthropologies that combined historicism with instinct theory. Even Freud, who is usually not thought of in historicist terms, cannot be understood if one only considers his instinct theory. Eros and Thanatos can only be properly understood by following their development through the individual's own life history. Similarly, FreuÄs theory of society can only be grasped through an un- derstanding of how his ahistorical theory of human limitations interacts with his views on the historical origins of both civil society and morality itself. Veblen's paradigm rests on an epistemological triad. The first portion consists of what he saw as the basic human instincts - workmanship, idle curiosity and the parental bent - as well as his speculation on the origins of certain human institutions. The second portion consists of his theory of history, particularly as espoused in The Theory of the Leisure Class and his essays on the history of science. Veblen's investigation into con- temporary institutions - particularly business enterprise - completes this triad. While this last category is slyly ubiquitous throughout most of his works, it is probably most prominent in The Theory of Business Enter- prise and Absentee Ownership. The most neglected portion of Veblen's paradigm is his theory of history, and the most neglected aspect of his theory of history is the extent to which Veblen borrowed it from Hegel. One does not have to totally agree with Windelband that most middle- and late-nineteenth-century thought is based on the philosophical assump- tions that German philosophy developed at the turn of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in order to find such philosophical assumptions in the work of thinkers of Veblen's generation. While it is easy ( and not uncommon) to place late-nineteenth-century thinkers, such as Croce and Mach, into the neo-Hegelian and neo-Kantian camps, others, par- ticularly social thinkers like Veblen, defy such neat classification. Despite the fact that he was an avowed Kantian who frequently denounced He-</page><page sequence="6">444 Social Science Quarterly gelian assumptions, much of Veblen's work reflects or parallels portions of Hegel's philosophy. Not enough attention has been given to Vehlens brief career as a grad- uate student at Johns Hopkins. While most Vehlen scholars usually make some perfunctory reference to Peirce's influence on Veblen's thought, the influence of other Johns Hopkins thinkers is either not mentioned or writ- ten off as inconsequential. Typical of this sort of treatment is Morton White's assertion that while Veblen studied under George Sylvester Mor- ris - whose Hegelianism White rather strongly condemns - Morris had no real influence on Veblen's subsequent social thought. Yet White ( 1973: 44) offers nothing to back his assertion except the curious non sequitur that if Morris's Hegelianism had influenced Veblen, it would have shown itself in Veblen's 1884 article on Kant. Aside from its lack of substantia- tion, White's crediting Peirce but not Morris with influencing Veblen is somewhat ironic. Andrew Veblen recounted that while both he and Thorstein took Peirce's class, Thorstein never discussed it. This stands in marked contrast to the latter's enthusiastic comments on Hegel that we find in his correspondence with historian J. Franklin Jameson. It is not surprising, however. As Andrew pointed out, his brother Thorstein never understood higher mathematics well enough to fully appreciate Peirce's lectures.3 Actually, Morris (who was also John Dewey's mentor at Ann Arbor) was enormously influential in forming Veblen's theory of history. Given Veblen's frequent denunciations of Hegelianism, it is hardly surprising that most Veblen scholars have not realized the full extent of Hegel's in- fluence on Veblen. Recent scholarship has shown that Hegelian thought was far more influential on turn-of-the-century American thinkers than had hitherto been suspected. If the influence of Hegel has until recently been overlooked in a relatively straightforward thinker like Royce, it should come as no surprise that it has remained hidden in the thought of one as sardonically elusive as Veblen. While as recently as 1973 Dorf- man (1973:258) called attention to Veblen's espousal of Hegelian meth- odology in his commentary of Coxey's Army, the more profound influence of Hegel on Veblen is in the latter's macrohistorical theory and in his use of what might be called "the Cunning of Workmanship" to explain cer- tain aspects of human evolution (Kuklick, 1977). In order to facilitate a comparison of Veblen's historical theory with that brand of Hegelianism which he received from Morris, I will utilize the four linguistic tropes of metaphor ( the assertion of similarity between two outwardly dissimilar objects), metonymy (the imagistic reduction of the whole to one of its parts), synecdoche (the symbol of the quality of 3 Andrew Veblen to Joseph Dorfman, 1 October 1926, Andrew Veblen Papers, Minnesota State Historical Society, St. Paul, Minnesota. Veblen's letters to Jameson are reprinted in Dorfman ( 1973:542, 544).</page><page sequence="7">NEGLECTED ASPECTS OF VEBLEN S SOCIAL THOUGHT 445 the part that is characteristic of the whole) and irony (the representa- tion through a figure of speech so patently absurd as to cast doubts on the overt claims of that which is being characterized).4 Using such a linguistic analysis to evaluate the influence of Hegelian- ism on Veblen may seem obscure to those who have only read Hegel's Phenomenology , with its emphasis on the dialectical triad of thesis, an- tithesis and synthesis. While the Phenomenology , however, was the work that Marx borrowed the dialectic from, it was not Hegel's principal work dealing with history. In HegeTs Philosophy of the State and History, Mor- ris devotes the second half of his book to Hegel's lectures on the phi- losophy of history. Morris's treatment not only illustrates Hegel's concept of world history evolving in four stages - the Oriental World, the Gre- cian World, the Roman World and the Germanic World - but also shows how Hegel divided each of these major epochs into separate historical and cultural stages. By briefly reviewing Morris's explication, we can see both how Hegel's outline of history corresponds to the four linguistic tropes and, since the book was written in the 1880s, what sort of Hegeli- anism Morris taught when Veblen took his courses at Johns Hopkins. The mature Veblen viewed human society as the product of historical evolution, an evolution that may be roughly blocked off into four macro- historical eras: savagery, barbarism, the handicraft era and the modern world. These stages have been previously explicated not only by Veblen, but also, with varying degrees of qualification, by most of those who have critically analyzed his work. What is usually overlooked is how closely this historic scheme structurally replicated Morris's Hegelianism. In Mor- ris's (1892:140, 144) explication, Hegel viewed China as a theocratic despotism, the state being "simply the Family 'writ large' " with the Em- peror "not only a civil and military ruler, but the 'ruling chief of religion and science.'" The emperor as supreme embodiment of the state is a metaphorical portrayal of the "great Father," who claimed sovereignty over the entire world, and also of "the ruling Chief of literature." In Chi- nese religion, where "God in their speech is 'Heaven' and 'Heaven' here means simply 'Nature.' Only the Emperor is privileged to approach Heav- en,' not individuals as such." While Morris (1898:147, 154, 170) shows Hegel viewing China in met- aphorical terms, India is portrayed metonymically. Hegel's outline of the historical progress of the idea of freedom from India to Persia is accom- panied by a tropological shift from metonymy to synecdoche in his description of the respective civilizations. Caste as the metonymical embodiment of God and nature has no place in either the Persian cosmology or political structure. The Persians who "constitute the connecting link between Asiatic and European History" were worshipers 4 A brief and lucid explanation of these four linguistic tropes and their application to contextual criticism can be found in White ( 1973:31-38).</page><page sequence="8">446 Social Science Quarterly of the light, embodied by the sun that "shines and sheds its blessing equally on all things." Such a principle at the core of their religion constituted a synecdochal apprehension of a cosmos where "spirit was still envisioned in terms of its material analogue, pure light" and con- versely, "the spiritual principle was materially construed." As Morris pointed out, such a principle of political organization led to the undoing of the Persian Empire and revealed the final stage of the Oriental world, that of Egypt, where existence itself was judged to be an ironic paradox. The embodiment of this irony was the Sphinx, who posed riddles in- scrutable to the ironic Egyptians and only capable of being solved by Oedipus, representative of Greece, the metaphorical stage of the new Occidental world. In Veblen's historical scheme, the first stage of human society, that of savagery, may be considered to be a metaphorical stage in that it is the metaphorical embodiment of what Veblen saw as the three basic human instincts: the instinct of workmanship, idle curiosity and the pa- rental bent. Another trait - which he does not identify as one of the pri- mary human instincts, but which recurs throughout human history - is that of animism. In the savage stage animism is at its most metaphorical in that it is ingenuously employed to apprehend the natural world. Con- cerning animism, Veblen's view does not substantially differ from that of Claude LÃ©vi-Strauss in our own day. Both see animism as the first real attempt to comprehend the natural world scientifically (Veblen, 1919: 40-42; LÃ©vi-Strauss, 1966:9-13). For Veblen, however, science is not in- terchangeable with animism and magic, hence such an animistic appre- hension of the natural world would be metaphorical. To understand the world around him, the savage projects portions of his own animistic na- ture outward. Thus he is at home not only with his basic instincts, but - through his metaphorical grasp of nature - with the nonhuman world as well. Unfortunately he is often incapable of adjusting his behavior to altered circumstances such as might be found when he confronts a rep- resentative of the next historical stage, that of barbarism. Indeed, the savage tends to be characterized by "a certain amiable inefficiency when confronted with force and fraud" (Veblen, 1934:7). With the advent of barbarism, advances in material technology caused the instinct of workmanship to bifurcate. In barbaric society industrial labor is performed by women, slaves and other socially debased classes, while the predatory exploits of hunting and fighting are the domain of the warrior. Though society is now actually divided by these two disci- plines, it is only the predatory activities and the leisure class values they produce that are held to be honorific. Though only representing a minor- ity lifestyle in barbarian society, such values are the object of emulation - the mÃ©tonymie embodiment of society. Diggins ( 1978:104-108) touches upon the manner in which Veblen metonymically viewed the relationship between barbaric society and the values it espoused when he suggests</page><page sequence="9">NEGLECTED ASPECTS OF VEBLEN'S SOCIAL THOUGHT 447 that Vehlen anticipated Gramschi's concept of capitalist hegemony - how the values and ethics of a small minority could hold emulative sway over an entire society. Though Vehlen is vague as to when savage society evolved into bar- barism, he does state that the Middle Ages marked the fullest develop- ment of high barbarism, and that the decline of the Middle Ages and the rise of what we now call the early modern era in the sixteenth, seven- teenth and eighteenth centuries constituted the handicraft era. Veblen's description of the macrocosm of the industrial and commercial organiza- tion of a society matching the microcosm of the social theorizing it pro- duced gives us a synecdochal image of the handicraft era. Such a balance could not historically survive, and with the coming of the machine age, or modern era, Western society entered its ironic phase. The machine and the concomitant scientific mode of thought it engendered created a discipline to which all must adapt. Yet the prevail- ing social thought remained a combination of the ideology of the handi- craft era, now woefully out of date and even absurd in the face of change wrought in business and industry by the machine, and the gross and in- congruous remnants of barbaric institutions. Such institutions, as in the case of the leisure class, are held together through a combination of bar- baric animism on one hand and the emulative pressures of invidious status rankings on the other. Such a paradox between animism and sci- ence, between status and the machine, is doubly ironic when such a so- ciety deludes itself into the belief that its current mores in fact represent a substantive advance from previous barbaric codes of decorum. A prime example of such unrealized irony was to be found in the work of Spencer, who believed that in advancing to the industrial stage, society was in the process of transcending the organization of society by status. Actu- ally, as Veblen was to point out on numerous occasions, barbaric status relations were omnipresent in contemporary society, only their appear- ance having changed. Thus both the structure of Victorian society and its belief in progress were ironic. But the existing irony was of a terminal sort, though, as Veblen (1964:25) points out, the denouement was un- certain : History records more frequent and more spectacular instances of the tri- umph of imbecile institutions over life and culture than of the peoples who have by force of instinctive insight saved themselves alive out of a desperately precarious institutional situation, such as now (1913) faces the peoples of Christendom. Almost as a coda to the structural similarities between the historical thought of Hegel and Veblen it is worthwhile noting that Veblen's con- ceptualization of the history of thought is at least in part a fourfold de- velopment that may also be construed tropologically. Veblen divided knowledge "between esoteric and exoteric." The for- mer-the "higher learning" - lacked any economic or industrial use, while</page><page sequence="10">448 Social Science Quarterly the latter consisted primarily of "knowledge of industrial processes and of natural phenomena." The origin of the higher learning was in savage animism, that practice of sympathetic magic that apprehended nature metaphorically through symbolic ritual. In the second, metonymical phase, the higher learning was institutionalized in the office of the priest who "came to be distinguished from the sorcerer on one hand and the menial servant of a temporal master on the other hand" and who pre- served and codified the devout observances. The third stage saw a split in education between the institution of the leisure class and those "schools founded for the instruction of the lower classes in the immediately useful branches of knowledge" (Veblen, 1934:367-70). This stage appeared in America during the industrialization of the nineteenth century and may be viewed as a synecdochal relationship between society and knowledge. For the class that was involved in the industrial process, their institution of learning constituted an embodiment of attributes essential for the function of industrial society. The more traditional higher learning also had a synecdochal relation- ship with the leisure class whose values of conspicuous waste and archaic status it embodied. This synecdochal relationship of learning to the com- munity came undone in both cases after the Civil War. For the leisure class, the ensuing growth of industry created a society where predatory values of conspicuous waste were massively dysfunctional. Much of The Higher Learning in America, as well as the chapter in The Theory of the Leisure Class entitled "The Higher Learning," may be read as a dia- tribe against the retention of archaic values in late-nineteenth-century American education. The relation of such learning to society was ironic in that it embodied the values of the leisure class that had brought civilization to the ironic juxtaposition of an industrial society striving to emulate barbaric cultural values. The irony afflicting the industrial education was hardly less than that of its leisure-class counterpart. Though the former matter-of-fact branch of education had previously escaped many of the strictures and proscriptions of the leisure class, it had in recent years taken to aping its benighted counterpart in regard to an "increased insistence on scho- lastic ritual and on conformity to the ancient forms as regards vestments and social and scholastic solemnities" (Veblen, 1934:370-71). This re- crudescence of more barbaric scholarly codes was but one manifestation of a more general cultural prostration following the Civil War. Much of what Veblen (1934:372-73) concluded about post Civil War America is applicable - with qualifications - to our own post-Vietnam culture: Habituation to war entails a body of predatory habits of thought ... a sense of invidious distinction supplants the impulse to equitable, everyday serviceability . . . the generation which follows a season of war is apt to witness a rehabilitation of the element of status ... a gradual advancing</page><page sequence="11">NEGLECTED ASPECTS OF VEBLENS SOCIAL THOUGHT 449 of sentiment favoring quasi-predatory business habits, insistence on status, anthropomorphism and conservatism generally. Veblen's four-stage theory of history is but one example of the manner in which he was influenced by Hegel. Another can be seen in the manner in which his instinct of workmanship played a role in his theory of history somewhat analogous to the concept of Reason in Hegel's philosophy. In Hegel's philosophy, human activity is conducted under the aegis of the "Cunning of Reason." People act blindly upon their passions and though such activity is utilized by Reason operating through history, such purposes can only be fathomed years later. Ultimately, in Hegel's thought, through the Cunning of Reason the Spirit will overcome the period of its self-alienation that man calls history (Hegel, 1975:272). In Veblen's thought, the instinct of workmanship is present in the original human stage of Savagery. From this point its movement through history could be termed the Cunning of Workmanship. In The Instinct of Work- manship Veblen (1964:7) provided us with a passage that may be in- terpreted both as an image of the way he himself operated and the way in which he saw the instincts interacting with society and, by implication, history: The instinctive proclivities are essentially simple and look directly to the attainment of some concrete objective end; but in detail the ends so sought are many and diverse, and the ways and means by which they may be sought are similarly diverse and various, involving endless recourse to ex- pedients, adaptations, and concessive adjustment between several procliv- ities that are all sufficiently urgent. Just as Reason moves people in ways unfathomable and often inimical to their historical existence, so too the principal result of the savage's in- genuous cultivation of the instinct of workmanship destroys savage so- ciety through the development of more advanced tools and weapons and the introduction of the spirit of emulation that promulgates invidious distinctions. As emulation centers more on goods than on overtly visible prowess, the cultivation of the instinct of workmanship contributes to the rise of the workshop civilization of the handicraft era that supplants barbarism at the end of the Middle Ages. The handicraft era is itself undermined through the development of modern business, which is ulti- mately personified by finance capital and absentee ownership. The in- stinct of workmanship is also the impetus that impels business civiliza- tion to begin the development of its ultimate antithesis, the industrial system. In this fourth stage of human history, the instinct of workman- ship is espoused in a pedagogical manner by the machine, an espousal that ultimately leads to a conflict between the imperatives of business and industry. Presumably this would be the final stage of the alienation of the instinct of workmanship from the rightful primacy in human af- fairs that it shared at the beginning of history with idle curiosity and the</page><page sequence="12">Social Science Quarterly parental bent. Just as Hegel's Cunning of Reason ultimately overcomes the self-alienation of the Spirit, in Vehlens thought, what might be called the Cunning of Workmanship acts through history ultimately to over- come the self-alienation of man from his most basic instincts. Vehlens use of portions of Hegel's conceptualization of world history coincided with a turn-of-the-century reintroduction of other metaphorical conceptualizations that could be reduced to either linguistic or organic analogues. In addition to Pareto's grudging adaptation of Vico s cyclical theory of historical recurrence, James Joyce very consciously built Fin- negaris Wake around Vico's model of historical recurrence analogous to the four linguistic tropes of metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche and irony in a manner very similar to that employed by Hegel.5 The early-twen- tieth-century return to the sort of metahistory that utilized organic anal- ogies can partly be seen as a result of the late-nineteenth-century Euro- pean fixation of the themes of sickness, decay and death. Oswald Spengler was the first twentieth-century historian to construct a historical paradigm built directly upon such analogies. Others following his example have included Arnold Toynbee, Pitirim Sorokin, Reinhold Niebuhr and Veb- len's disciple Lewis Mumford. The tie between Vehlens life and work is a close and complicated one that must be considered on several levels. Though the best of his insights are of a profundity comparable to those of Freud, Weber, Durkheim and Pareto, it in no way detracts from Vehlens work to point out that they are insights that bear the marks of his background. It would be just as wrong to overlook the fact that he was the product of an immigrant fam- ily living on the late-nineteenth-century American frontier as it would be to dismiss his insights because of it. Vehlens work also reflects the particular ambience surrounding the turn-of-the-century triumph of American business as much as it does the late-nineteenth-century crisis in Western social thought. So too does his career give eloquent testimony to his membership in a generation of American social thinkers who man- aged to be alienated intellectuals at the same time that they were giving institutional credence to American social science. Beyond such social, economic and cultural factors, however, lies the deeper question of the influence of his own personal life upon his work. The link between Veblen's personal life and the work that he pro- duced seems paradoxical in the extreme. The thinker who charted the decline of animism often seemed to expect providential treatment from the world in which he lived. A critic who wrote with tremendous in- sight about the inherently ignominious role society accorded women was often brutally insensitive to those women closest to him. And of 5 Joyce's use of Vico's theory of historical recurrence is discussed by Burgess ( 1968:xii-xiii) as well as by Campbell and Robinson (1975:5-6). For the best bio- graphical account of Vico's influence on Joyce, see Ellman ( 1965:351, 565, 575, 706).</page><page sequence="13">NEGLECTED ASPECTS OF VEBLEN S SOCIAL THOUGHT 45 1 course, the man who eulogized the parental bent was incapable of sus- taining the role of a husband, much less assume that of a father. Beneath the surface paradox lay a profound alienation, an alienation that covered what was at times violent emotional turmoil under the mask of an overt lack of affect. Yet this personal alienation gave him the correct balance of pathos and irony, of bitterness and hope, of frustrated rage and equally frustrated compassion, to engage in what at times was a chilling- ly vivid dissection of the barbaric follies and childishly brutal inanities that we unwittingly allow to guide our behavior. Veblen's work constituted one of the several paradigms expounded by turn-of-the-century thinkers in an attempt to answer the crisis in social thought. Like so much of the work of Freud, Weber and Durkheim, many of Veblen's ideas have become either part of the vocabulary or simply accepted - if unstated - assumptions among the educated public. Yet despite the varying degrees of acceptance accorded to turn-of-the- century social science paradigms, none of them has enjoyed anything ap- proaching universal acceptance among contemporary social theorists. The late-nineteenth-century crisis in social thought resulted in a prolif- eration of social paradigms, each with its own vocabulary, and each con- tinuing to vie for exclusive acceptance as the twentieth century draws to a close. Veblen's paradigm provided a method of studying human behavior through an anthropology that combined the interaction of the ahistorical human instincts of workmanship, idle curiosity and the parental bent with various historical institutions. This combination of instincts and institutions can be traced through a four-stage scheme of evolutionary development - development that, as we have seen, Veblen seems to have borrowed directly from Hegel. Veblen's legacy in the social sci- ences - a legacy appropriated by figures as diverse as Lewis Mumford and John Kenneth Galbraith - has to some extent been matched by his influence in popular American culture. In addition to the manner in which Veblen's concepts of conspicuous consumption and invidious com- parison have been reflected in the work of writers such as Sinclair Lewis, Veblen's concept of social ascendency through the exercise of predatory inclinations has enjoyed what he might have termed periods of "recru- descence" in popular American culture since the 1920s. One example of this would be Budd Schulberg's What Makes Sammy Run? (1941), in which the Veblenian archetypes of the peaceable industrious savage and the predatory barbarian are personified in the characters of screenwriter Julian Blumberg and producer Sammy Glick. Midway through the novel, the narrator-protagonist cites Veblen in explaining the potlÃ tch logic behind one of Glick's gauche Hollywood parties: Sammy kept buying us champagne and blew five hundred bucks at the crap table (and told everyone it was a thousand) and Kit tried to ex-</page><page sequence="14">452 Social Science Quarterly plain that it wasn't really a loss because a guy called Vehlen said we make our reputations by how much money we can publicly throw away. (Schulberg, 1968:94) Despite the lasting quality of so many of Veblen's insights, the current climate of our society cannot be said to be very receptive to his social prescriptions. Yet our current shift to the right, like our cultivation of leisure and personal narcissism, co-exists with an equally strong - if only grudgingly admitted - realization of the strictures imposed by limited resources. While Veblens pessimistic vision of a world where one must choose either workmanship or wastemanship seemed to have only pe- ripheral relevance in the first few decades after World War II, the events and conditions of our own lifetime may yet render much of his thought increasingly poignant. At the end of the last century a shock of recog- nition greeted Veblens mordant dissection of the essentially barbaric substrata that underlay the overtly genteel decorum of the leisure class. Our own century, however, may well draw to a close with a growing realization that the cultivation of idle curiosity, the instinct of work- manship and the parental bent may go further in assuaging the inev- itable limitations of the human condition than do cultural palliatives that are only the most recent incarnations of the timeless barbaric im- peratives of conspicuous consumption, fraud and waste.
