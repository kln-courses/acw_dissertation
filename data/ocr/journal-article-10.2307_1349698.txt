<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANALYSIS OF AWAY-FROM-HOME AND AT-HOME INTAKE OF SATURATED FAT AND CHOLESTEROL Rodolfo M. Nayga, Jr: and Oral Capps, Jr This article examines the impact of socio-economic and demographic factors on individual intake of saturated fat and cholesterol from away-from-home and at- home markets. Factors that significantly affect saturated fat intake in both away from home and at home markets are urbanization, region, race, diet status, age, and income. Urbani- zation, race, ethnicity, sex, household size, age, date of consumption, and income affect cholesterol intake at home. Public awareness of the link between coronary heart disease and fat and cholesterol intake has been increasing (Putler and Frazao). A 1989 survey revealed that almost half of American adults reported that they try "very hard" to decrease the consumption of foods high in fat and cholesterol; another 29 percent reported that they try "moderately hard"; and less than 25 percent do not worry about it (Smith and Yonkers). In 1990, another survey found that 46 percent of the shoppers surveyed indicated that fat was their worst nutritional problem and about 44 percent said cholesterol was a worry (Food Marketing Institute). In still another survey, half of the respondents said a new product should be allowed on supermarket shelves only if it had little cholesterol and fat (Fisher). The latter survey implies that consumers are seeking foods with few undesirable characteristics (i.e., saturated fat and cholesterol) rather than foods that are excellent sources of nutrition. Despite increasing awareness, however, fat and cholesterol intake remains above the maximum level recommended by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Heart Association, and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans (United States Department of Health and Human Ser- vices). The United States Department of Health and Human Services revealed that average cholesterol consumption has declined slightly in the last couple of decades, but the consumption of saturated fat has changed little since 1940. Moreover, recent surveys indicate that consumers are still having difficulties translating their increased awareness into appropriate food choices. For example, some consumers consider food low in cholesterol as "good food" and consume more of it even though the food may be high in fat (Putler and Frazao). Therefore, it is important to consider both cholesterol and fat intake patterns of individual consumers in examining consumer food choices. Although recent trends point to a growing appetite by Americans for eating out (Nayga and Capps), there is increasing public interest in the nutritional content of food eaten away from home. Public perception about the healthfulness of food eaten away from home has tremendous implications for food away from home (FAFH) establishments such as restaurants and fast food places. Heightened consumer interest in health and nutrition has increased the need for a complete understanding of fat and cholesterol intake patterns both at home and away from home. Moreover, knowledge of factors that affect saturated fat and cholesterol intake can be used in the design and implementation of nutrition programs. For instance, the relationship between socio-demographic factors and con- sumption of saturated fat and cholesterol can be evaluated. Knowledge of these relationships can be utilized to develop nutrition education programs that focus on certain groups of individuals with unacceptable levels of saturated fat and cholesterol intake.

Review of Agricultural Economics 16(1994):387-398</page><page sequence="2">388 REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS, Vol. 16, No. 3, September 1994 Gould, Cox, and Perali analyzed the impacts of prices, seasonality, government butter donations, and demographic factors on fats and oils consumption. Estimated impacts of the changing U.S. demographic profile on fats and oils consumption were generally statistically significant. The purpose of this article is to assess the impact of various socio-demographic and economic factors on saturated fat and cholesterol intake from food consumed away from home and food consumed at home. Model Specification The basic model of demand for specific nutrients resembles the Engel function, which relates changes in the consumption of a good to changes in income. This function can be derived from consumer theory by assuming that a consumer chooses a consumption bundle so as to maximize utility subject to a budget constraint. Maximizing a consumer's utility subject to a budget constraint will lead to demand functions for commodities: i - fi(p, y) (1) where p denotes a vector of prices; y is consumer income; and q, is the consumption of the i' commodity. By extending this model to examine the demand for nutrients, the intake of nutrient k is given by: Nk = Ej ka 9% (2) where akj denotes the amount of nutrient k contained in each unit of commodity qj (Devaney and Fraker). Substituting equation (1) into equation (2) leads to demand functions for nutrients of the following form: Nk gk(P,Y)' (3) Recognizing that consumers' preferences may vary with various socio-demographic and anthropomorphic variables (possible health indicators) and assuming that prices are held constant, a demand model for a specific nutrient can be specified as: N, = h,(yi, S), (4) where N, corresponds to the intake of nutrient k by individual i; yi corresponds to the income level of individual i; and S is a vector representing various socio-demographic and anthropomorphic factors as well as participation in various food programs. Because of the relative importance of saturated fat and cholesterol, these nutrients are selected for analysis. Based on specifications in previous studies on nutrient intake (e.g., Adrian and Daniel; Lane; Price et al.; Davis and Neenan; Akin, Guilkey, and Popkin; Chavas and Keplinger; Scearce and Jensen; Basiotis et al.) and conditioned on data available in the United States Department of Agriculture's 1987 to 1988 Nationwide Food Consumption Survey (NFCS), the exogenous variables include urbanization, region, race, sex, employment, household size, age, height, weight, and income. Dummy vari- ables pertaining to whether the individual receives food stamps, whether the individual is on special diet, and whether the three-day intake of the individual occurred mostly during a weekend or a weekday are also included in the analyses. Therefore, the general model specification used is: N, = bO + blurban + b2nonmetro + b3northeast + b4midwest + bwest + b6black + b7asian + bsother + bhispanic + bo0male + b1lunemployed + bl2fstamp + b13diet + bl4hsize + b sweight + b16weightsq + b17height + bsheightsq + bl9age + b20agesq + b21weekend + b22income + b23incomesq. Nki refers to the average daily intake of nutrient k by individual i. The nutrients analyzed are saturated fat in grams per 1,000 kilocalories and cholesterol in milligrams per 1,000 kilocalories. The description of the independent variables is exhibited in Table 1. One classification is eliminated from each group of binary variables for estimation purposes to avoid the problem of perfect multicollinearity.

Household income is used instead of individual income because the NFCS data set provided income information only for the household and not for an individual. The anthropomorphic measurements of the individual - age, sex, height, and weight - are included as exogenous variables to account for physical differences among individuals. Squared terms are included for weight, height, income, and age in order to investigate possible nonlinearities in the Engel relationships with saturated fat and cholesterol intake. The analyses are based on cross-section data collected over a relatively short period of time (April 1987 to August 1988). Therefore, the data set does not contain price information. Although relative prices could be the same for all individuals, some urban and regional variation in saturated fat and cholesterol intakes may represent urban and regional differences in average prices over the 1987 to 1988 data collection period. The analyses are separated into two different food sources [FAFH and food at home (FAH)] to determine differences in con- sumption patterns as well as differences in the factors affecting consumption of saturated fat and cholesterol. A possible problem in the estimation of regression models using cross-sectional data is heteroskedasticity of the error terms. When heteroskedasticity is present, ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation places more weight on the observations that have large error variances than on those with small error variances. Due to this implicit weighting, OLS parameter estimates are unbiased and consistent, but they are not efficient (Pindyck and Rubinfeld). To detect the presence of heteroskedasticity, the Breusch- Pagan-Godfrey (BPG) test is used in all regressions. The BPG test involves an auxiliary regression in which each squared residual from the OLS estimation is regressed on the same set of regressors used in the original model specification. An F-test is performed on all of the coefficients except the intercept. The null hypothesis of no heteroskedasticity is rejected if the F-test is statistically significant at a specified significance level (the 0.05 level in this study). If heteroskedastic disturbances are found in these equations, weighted least squares is employed wherein the weights are the reciprocal of the square root of the fitted values from the auxiliary regression involving the squared residuals (Breusch and Pagan; Godfrey). Data Source and Description The data set used in this study is the Individual Intake phase of the United States</page><page sequence="4">390 REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS, Vol. 16, No. 3, September 1994 Department of Agriculture's 1987 to 1988 NFCS. Data collection started in April 1987 and continued through August 1988. This data set is the most recent of the nationwide household food consumption surveys conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture. The Individual Intake phase of the 1987 to 1988 NFCS provides data on three consecutive days of food and nutrient intake by individuals of all ages surveyed in the 48 contiguous states. The first day data were collected using 24-hour dietary recall. The time period for this one-day recall was from midnight to 11:59 p.m. on the day preceding the interview. This collection was done using an in-home personal interview. Data for the second and third days were collected using a self-administered two-day dietary record. Respondents were asked about the sources of each food eaten. Sources included food that was eaten at home, food brought into the home but later eaten away from home, and food that was never brought into the home. The United States Department of Agriculture considers food from the first two sources to be from the home food supply. Thus, this study considers food from the first two sources to be food at home (FAH), and food from the third source as food away from home (FAFH). The nutrient intake for the day is the sum of the amounts of each nutrient in each food reported by an individual. The amount of each nutrient from each food eaten was calculated using the weight (in grams) of that food and the nutritive value of that food (per 100 grams) from a nutrient data base developed by the Human Nutrition Information Service (HNIS) (United States Department of Agriculture). The number of days in which food intake information was available for an individual varied. Thus, for some individuals the information was provided for only a one-day or two-day period. Due to the different interview processes that were employed in each of the three days of intake, it is inappropriate to combine and analyze all of the individuals with one day, two days, and three days of completed intake. Moreover, over 80 percent of the sample completed three days of intake. For these reasons, only individuals who completed three days of intake are included in the analyses. Individuals who failed to report pertinent socio- economic and demographic information are also deleted from the analyses. Two different data sets are created corresponding to each food source: FAFH and FAH. After the elimination of individuals with missing relevant intake, and socio-economic and demographic information, the FAFH and FAH data sets have 4,225 and 6,186 observations, respectively. The means of the variables used in the analyses are exhibited in Table 2 (refer to Table 1 for the units of measurement of the variables). Other descriptive statistics of the variables are available from the authors upon request. Deleting data for individuals who failed to report pertinent socio-demographic and econ- omic information may give rise to potential self- selection problems. One way to assess the degree to which this problem may exist is by comparing the means of the variables used in the analyses with and without the deleted data. The means of the variables with the deleted data compare reasonably well with the means of the variables without the deleted data, except for employment, age, and household size variables.' The means of the employed and age variables are lower, while the mean of household size is higher with the deleted data than without the deleted data. Empirical Results Results on the effects of various socio- economic and demographic variables on intakes of saturated fat (grams) and cholesterol (milligrams) per 1,000 kilocalories from the different sources are exhibited in Tables 3 and 4. Due to the complexity of factors influencing individual nutrient consumption and the cross- sectional nature of the data, the adjusted R2's, as expected, are relatively low. For the FAFH and FAH models pertaining to saturated fat, the adjusted R2's are 0.0214 and 0.0459, respective- ly. For the FAFH and FAH models pertaining to cholesterol, the adjusted R2's are 0.0495 and 0.1107, respectively. Heteroskedasticity is evident in all the regressions analyzed, with the 'With the deleted data, the mean of the employment status, age, and household size variables are 0.44, 34.63, and 3.44, respectively.</page><page sequence="5">ANALYSIS OF AWAY-FROM-HOME AND AT-HOME INTAKE OF SATURATED FAT Nayga, Capps 391 Table 2.

Weighted least squares (WLS) estimation is used in the equations with heteroskedastic error terms. Saturated Fats Significant differences across different degrees of urbanization and regional variables are evident in the intake of saturated fat per 1,000 kilocalories2 (Table 3). For instance, individuals from non-metro areas have a higher intake of saturated fat per 1,000 kilocalories from FAFH and FAH than individuals from suburban areas. Education programs and publicity regarding the negative effect of saturated fat on health may be reaching more consumers in urban and suburban areas than in non-metro areas. One of the reviewers of this article suggested that individuals from non-metro areas may be less educated about the negative effect of saturated fat or they may just live a more traditional lifestyle and eat the foods they produce, which often contain more saturated fat. In terms of the regional variables, results indicate that individuals in the Northeast and Midwest have higher intakes of saturated fat per 1,000 kilocalories from both food sources than individuals from the South. Individuals from the West also have higher intakes of saturated fat per 1,000 kilocalories from FAH than individuals from the South. The results also suggest that intakes differ by race of the individual. In particular, whites have higher intakes of saturated fat per 1,000 kilocalories from both food sources than blacks. Similarly, intakes by whites of saturated fat per 1,000 kilocalories from FAH are higher than those of Asians/Pacific Islanders. Hispanics have lower intakes of saturated fat per 1,000 kilocalories from FAH than do non-Hispanics. There are no statistical differen- ces in the intakes of saturated fat per 1,000 kilocalories between employed and unemployed individuals from the food sources. Individuals who receive food stamps have lower intakes of saturated fat per 1,000 kilocalories from FAFH than those who are not receiving food stamps. In accord with prior expectations, individuals who are on a special diet have lower intakes of saturated fat per 1,000 kilocalories from both food sources than individuals who are 2Due to unavailability of price information, these urban and regional variations may represent urban and regional price effects over the data collection period.</page><page sequence="6">392 REVIEW OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS, Vol. 16, No. 3, September 1994 Table 3.

Household size is positively related to the intake of saturated fat per 1,000 kilocalories from FAH and FAFH, but only significantly so for FAH. The height of the individual is a significant explanatory variable in the saturated fat model for FAFH. In particular, intake of saturated fat per 1,000 kilocalories initially increases and then declines with successive increments of height. Height, however, is not statistically significant in the FAH model. Changes in the average daily intake of saturated fat per 1,000 kilocalories as the individual ages are illustrated in Figure 1. These estimates are derived from the models by chang- ing age while holding other variables at their means. Contrary to the results of Gould, Cox, and Perali, age is generally negatively related to the intake of saturated fat per 1,000 kilocalories from FAH, holding all other factors constant. Leonard indicated that older Americans are most likely to be among the "healthy eaters" because they tend to shift to foods that help prevent cancer and heart disease. However, as depicted in Figure 1, intake of saturated fat per 1,000 kilocalories from FAFH decreases initially with successive increments of age and then increases as indicated by the significant negative and positive signs of the age and age-squared coefficients under the FAFH model. Based on the calculations using the means of the variables used in the model, the inflection point where intake of saturated fat per 1,000 kilocalories from FAFH changes direction is at age 47. A non-linear intake pattern is also evident between the intake of saturated fat per 1,000 kilocalories from FAFH and income. Specifical- ly, intake of saturated fat from FAFH increases initially and then declines with successive positive increments of income. Although not apparent in Figure 2, the change in direction or inflection point occurs at income equivalent to $96,000. As mentioned by one of the reviewers, this inflection point seems relatively trivial since the mean income in the sample is only about $32,500.

In terms of urbanization, individuals who reside in non-metro areas have significantly higher intakes of cholesterol per 1,000 kilo- calories from FAH than those residing in subur- ban areas. This result is generally consistent with those of the saturated fat models. No statistically significant differences between the urbanization variables are evident in the FAFH equation. Compared to individuals from the South, individuals from the Midwest also have lower intakes of cholesterol per 1,000 kilocalories from FAH. As suggested by the likelihood ratio tests (Table 4), the race variables as a group significantly affect cholesterol consumption in the FAH model but not in the FAFH model. Interestingly, the results indicate that whites have lower intakes of cholesterol per 1,000 kilocalories from both food sources than do blacks. Similarly, whites have lower cholesterol intake per 1,000 kilocalories from FAH than do Asians/Pacific Islanders. These findings differ from those of the saturated fat models that reveal the opposite. These results imply that some individuals (e.g., whites), on a nutrient-density basis, eat foods that are low in cholesterol even though they are high in saturated fat. Recent work by researchers at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on the public's knowledge about saturated fat and cholesterol is consistent with this "fat-trading" phenomenon. For instance, FDA researchers found that if some consumers know that a particular product is low in cholesterol, these consumers may infer that it is a "good food," even though the food may be high in fat (Putler and Frazao). An example is a consumer who eats a tunafish salad sandwich instead of red meat to reduce intake of cholesterol, unaware that the fat content of the sandwich is probably higher than that of a lean cut of red meat (Putler and Frazao). Results also imply that Hispanics have higher intakes of cholesterol per 1,000 kilocalories from FAH than non-Hispanics. No statistically significant difference in cholesterol intake per 1,000 kilocalories is evident between Hispanics and non-Hispanics in the FAFH market. Males have higher intakes of cholesterol per 1,000 kilocalories from FAH than do females. This result is consistent with the</page><page sequence="9">ANALYSIS OF AWAY-FROM-HOME AND AT-HOME INTAKE OF SATURATED FAT Nayga, Capps 395 finding of the United States Department of Health and Human Services which indicated that women are also more likely to watch their diet more closely than men. Household size is positively related to cholesterol intake per 1,000 kilocalories from FAH. Household size is negatively related, however, to the intake of cholesterol per 1,000 kilocalories from FAFH. Nayga and Capps revealed a negative relationship between household size and the likelihood of eating FAFH. Cholesterol intakes of individuals from both food sources during the weekend are significantly higher than cholesterol intakes of individuals during weekdays. This result may imply that individuals prepare and/or eat more high-cholesterol type of foods, per 1,000 kilocalories, during the weekends than during the weekdays. For instance, individuals might have more opportunity or time to prepare formal dinners or to eat out during the weekends when they are off from work as opposed to during the weekdays. Non-linear intake patterns are reflected in some of the significant coefficients of the age and income variables. In particular, cholesterol intake per 1,000 kilocalories from FAH increases and then decreases with successive positive increments in age. As mentioned earlier, Leonard indicated that older Americans are becoming the "healthy eaters" (at home) because they tend to shift to eating foods that help prevent heart disease and cancer. As depicted in Figure 3, cholesterol intake per 1,000 kilocalories from FAH increases until age 54 and then declines with successive increments of age, ceteris paribus. On the other hand, cholesterol intake from FAH decreases initially and then increases with successive increments in income. Although not observable in Figure 4, cholesterol intake from FAH declines until an income level of $114,000 is reached before it starts to increase with successive increments in income. This inflection point becomes relatively unimportant, however, when the mean income of roughly $29,500 in the sample is considered. Conclusions Heightened consumer interest in health and nutrition has increased the need for a complete understanding of saturated fat and cholesterol intake patterns not only from food eaten at home but also from food eaten away from home. Moreover, food consumption relationships are traditionally specified between socio-economic factors and quantity or expenditure measures. These approaches, however, do not allow infer- ences regarding the nutritional status of an individual's diet. On the other hand, although a considerable literature exists on nutrient intake models, little attention has been paid to the analysis of saturated fat and cholesterol intake from either FAFH or FAH. Levels of saturated fats and cholesterol in consumers' diets are now a concern, especially with increased awareness about health and nutrition. In this light, this study evaluates individual saturated fat and cholesterol intakes to provide a comprehensive description and understanding of the intake patterns from FAFH and FAH. The information obtained from this study could be used by nutrition educators and policy makers in the development of educational programs and tools that help Americans select nutritious diets with appropriate levels of saturated fats and cholesterol. The findings in this study could assist, for instance, in tracking progress toward achieving goals of public health initiatives aimed at reducing and modifying saturated fat and cholesterol intakes. The empirical results of this study could also be used as a guide in directing nutrition education programs dealing with the intake of saturated fats and cholesterol toward certain population groups. For example, results generally indicate that whites, non-Hispanics, individuals who reside in non-metro areas, indi- viduals not from the South, and those not on a special diet have higher intakes of saturated fat per 1,000 kilocalories from both FAFH and FAH than do their counterparts. Therefore, to be more effective, nutrition outreach and education programs dealing with the intake of saturated fat may need to be directed toward these groups of individuals. Since the analyses are separated into the FAFH and FAH markets, the information derived from this study could also be useful to food processors, wholesalers, and retailers in the design of marketing programs and in the mar- keting of food products targeted at specific population groups.

Food service retailers, on the other hand, may be able to boost sales of low saturated fat menus in away-from-home estab- lishments by targeting blacks in the South who are on special diets and who reside in urban or suburban areas. Knowledge about the intake of saturated fat and cholesterol would also be important to food producers/processors because this provides some indication of the market size for low or high saturated fat and cholesterol foods sold by people in certain industries (e.g., milk, beef). This article documents the usefulness of modeling saturated fat and cholesterol intakes from separate food sources. However, the results of this study should be used with care given the relative explanatory power of the models and given the disparity of some of the results with those of other studies (e.g., Gould, Cox, and Perali). In addition, it might be worthwhile to compare the results of this study with those utilizing more recent surveys like the National Center for Health Statistics' National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey III (NHANES III) to assess the health and nutritional status of Americans. This comparison will allow health planners to determine the extent to which various health problems and risk factors associated with the intake of saturated fat and cholesterol have changed in the U.S. population over time.
