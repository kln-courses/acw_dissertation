I begin by examining the historical reasons for suspicion of psychology within the community of biblical scholarship, focusing on several perennial objections. Having ad dressed these objections, I go on to set out a framework for the legitimate use of psychology in enhancing understanding of the process of production and reception of the biblical texts, and of elucidating their meaning. Finally, I suggest that some contemporary methodological quality-control systems from psychology might inform the question of what constitutes a good read ing of a particular text. I explore this issue further by using the example of trauma processing in relation to the New Testament, suggesting that if the text is to be received as transformative, a good reading is likely to be dis sonant, challenging, or ugly. The relationship between psychology and biblical studies has historically not been easy, and psychological approaches are still relatively uncommon in the academic study of the Bible. In this article I examine the history of the relationship, arguing that much of the suspicion of psychology among biblical scho lars, while historically understandable, is unfounded. I then pro ceed to give an overview of the ways in which contemporary academic psychology may be brought to bear on the study of the Bible and conclude by illustrating one way in which a psy chological understanding of the text might assist with the her meneutic question of what constitutes a good reading. I.I. The Strange Absence of Psychology From Biblical Studies Academic psychology concerns itself with the 'scientific study of behaviour and mental processes'1 of human beings in 1 This is the definition of psychology given by the British and American undergraduate textbooks endorsed by the British Psychological Society and the © The Author 2012. © The Author 2012.

It aims to give a rigorous account of how people come to feel, think, and act as they do. In this it clearly interacts, and may at points overlap, with several other human sciences such as anthropology and sociology. Yet, while these other human sciences have been readily utilized by biblical scholars, the literature on biblical studies indicates a marked avoidance of psychology, and the occasional expression of an outright aversion to it. Indeed, Gerd Theissen opens his 1983 book Psychologische AspekteAspekte Paulinischer Theologie with the defensive, if ironic, acknowledgement that 'Every exegete has learned that psycho logical exegesis is poor exegesis'.2 Despite some developments in the last quarter of a century (to be considered below), his words still give a good indication of the suspicion with which psychology is viewed by many in the field. This is odd, for at first glance psychology appears to be an academic discipline whose application to the study of sacred texts, including the Bible, is both appropriate and potentially highly productive. For one thing, psychologists use texts a good deal in their research and practice. They rely heavily on written material such as questionnaires, interview transcripts, written accounts of observed behaviour, and therapy diaries. Moreover, they have developed sophisticated and reliable means of 'reading' these texts. Secondly, the content of most sacred texts, especially sacred narratives, can be said to be dominated by psychological themes. These texts contain accounts of human behaviour and divine behaviour described in anthropomorphic terms that proceed according to certain rules. Motives are attributed to the protag onists, and inner thought processes are sometimes made explicit. Examples include Joseph's reaction on seeing Benjamin (Gen. 42:29-31), God's change of mind on Nineveh (Jonah 3:10), the deliberative monologue of the unjust steward (Luke 16:3), the depiction of Moses in chapter 28 of the Qur'an, and Arjuna's reaction on seeing the troops on the field of dharma (The The Bhagavad Gita, 1:26-30).

A sacred text may act as a stimulus that evokes a particular psychological response in a reader; it may itself be a vehicle for the working through of a psychological process (Lamentations is a possible example of this4); it may be the outcome of a reactive response to an event (as described in Acts 4:20) or the outcome of an instrumental action (as claimed in John 20:31). Nevertheless, as already indicated, an examination of the biblical studies literature yields very little in the way of psych ology. What there is tends to be of one type (depth psychology5) applied to a limited area (reader-response). For instance, in the introduction to their impressive four-volume work Psychology and the the Bible: A New Way to Read the Scriptures, J. Harold Ellens and Wayne Rollins state that the first volume 'demonstrates the range of psychological approaches, methods, or schools that have been applied to biblical interpretation'.6 However these approaches turn out to be almost exclusively based on depth psychologies (applying the theories of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Erik Erikson, Donald Winnicott, and Heinz Kohut), and the whole volume has a strongly psycho therapeutic flavour. This is consistent with the observation that the majority of articles on psychology and the Bible appear in pastoral psychology or theology journals,7 where the therapeutic stance is a valued perspective. When such articles do appear in biblical studies journals their tone can be tentative 3 See P. Ricoeur, 'Technique and Nontechnique in Interpretation', in The Conflict Conflict of Interpretations: Essays in Hermeneutics, trans. W. Domingo (Evanston, IL: Northwestern University Press, 2004), pp. 177-95. Ricoeur de scribes the psychoanalyst's 'reading' of her patient as a systematic act of inter pretation of the symbol-ridden text he brings to the encounter. 4 P. Joyce, 'Lamentations and the Grief Process: A Psychological Reading', Biblical Biblical Interpretation 1 (1993), pp. 304-20. s Depth psychology is the contemporary umbrella term for psychological approaches that arise out of psychotherapeutic practice, and which emphasize the role of the unconscious motives in human behaviour. It includes Freudian, post-Freudian, Jungian, and Object Relations approaches to the human person. 6 H. Ellens and W. Rollins, Psychology and the Bible: A New Way to Read the Scriptures Scriptures (Westport, CT: Praeger, 2004), p. 3. 7 Wayne Rollins and Andrew Kille's edited collection of psychological read ings of the Bible contains 44 readings, 41 of which are chapters from edited collections. The three journal articles were published in Pastoral Psychology, Journal Journal of Psychology and Theology, and Christian Century. W. Rollins and D. A.

It might be thought that a home for psychology as human science rather than therapy could be found in publications taking a social scientific approach to the Bible. However, recent books in this area seem either to exclude psychology altogether,9 or to marginalize it in favour of archaeology, anthropology, discursive methods, sociology, politics, and economics.10 The discourse in these publications is consequently (and probably with conscious intent) characterized by an absence of the personal. II.II. Psychologies, not Psychology The reasons for the situation described above seem to be largely historical. Wayne Rollins gives a helpful account in his 1999 book Soul Soul Soul and Psyche: The Bible in Psychological Perspective. 1 He charts the close and fruitful relationship between pre-modern philosophical psychology, theology, and biblical interpretation from Tertullian's De Anima through the Renaissance and Reformation periods, and into the nineteenth century, when modern empirical psychology emerged as a branch of the natural sciences. Rollins then notes a shift in attitude, which he refers to 8 Theissen's apologia has already been noted. Paul Joyce opens his psycho logical reading of Lamentations ('Lamentations and the Grief Process') with the statement that it is presented in a 'self-critical spirit' (p. 304), and devotes about one-third of the article to issues of method. Anthony Bash opens his psycho logical reading of 2 Cor. 10-13 with a quotation from Jerome Neyrey warning against 'psychologization', and also devotes about a third of the article to issues of method; Bash, Ά Psychodynamic Approach to the Interpretation of 2 Corinthians 10-13', Journal for the Study of the New Testament 83 (2001), pp. 51-67. Both Joyce and Bash write from a psychotherapeutic perspective, Joyce drawing on humanistic counselling, Bash drawing on depth psychotherapy. 9 'Horrell's collection of essays on socio-scientific approaches to the Bible contains virtually nothing from a psychological perspective.'

This uneasiness crystallized into outright antipathy in response to claims by two dominant branches of psychology (Freudian psychoanalysis and radical behaviourism14) to be offering comprehensive metaphysical accounts of the human condition that were in direct competition with Christian tradition. Something of a rapprochement between the first of these two branches and biblical studies began in the 1970s because the depth psychologies that developed from the Freudian school were more modest, flexible, and nuanced with regard to religion, and biblical hermeneutics was also becoming, perhaps of necessity, a more open and interdisciplinary enterprise.15 The rapprochement culminated in the establishment of a Psychology and Biblical Studies Section of the Society of Biblical Literature in 1998. This organization, while aspiring to include a broad range of psycho logical theories within its remit, is in practice dominated by depth psychological (particularly Jungian) approaches to biblical inter pretation (hence the strong connection with the discipline of pastoral psychology). This reflects a fact not fully acknowledged in Rollins's analysis: the same degree of rapprochement was never achieved between biblical studies and the second dominant branch of twentieth-century psychology, radical behaviourism.16 Yet this branch of psychology too became more nuanced and 12 Ibid., p. 62. 13 A. Schweitzer, Die psychiatrische Beurteilung Jesu: Darstellung und Kritik (Tubingen: J. C. B. Mohr, 1913).Translated by Charles R. Joy as The Psychiatric Psychiatric Study of Jesus (Boston: Beacon Press, 1948). 14 Radical behaviourism developed in the USA in the early 20th c. as a reaction to the mentalism and introspective methods of contemporary psychology, and was deeply critical of psychoanalytic approaches. Its earliest proponent was J. B. Watson (1878-1958), who was highly influenced by the work of Ivan Pavlov on classical conditioning in animals, but it was most fully developed in the experi mental and philosophical system of B. F. Skinner (1904-90). The movement placed a strong emphasis on the quantitative measurement of external behaviour and the generation of laws of learning that can be applied across species. This approach has been widely applied in education and health contexts, for instance in the management of challenging behaviour and the treatment of phobias. 15 The writing of Paul Ricoeur was extremely influential in this process. P. Ricoeur, Essays on Biblical Interpretation, ed. L. Mudge (Philadelphia: Fortress Press 1970). 16 Gerd Theissen has shown himself well aware of this issue, and sought to address it in his 1983 book on the Pauline corpus (Psychologische Aspekte Paulinischer Theologie), which included a 'learning theory* (behavioural</page><page sequence="6">JOANNA COLLICUTT 6 differentiated, highly influenced as it was by the post-war developments in related fields such as ethology17 and information technology. Crucially, it is this branch that has formed the basis for what are now considered the 'mainstream' psychologies taught in university psychology departments.18 On the other hand, depth psychologies—rightly or wrongly—barely feature in undergradu ate programmes, at least in Britain and the USA,19 where figures such as Freud and Jung are studied largely for their antiquarian interest. Thus the psychologies that have been of primary interest to biblical scholars are generally not the psychologies studied by present-day psychologists and vice versa. The very limited rapprochement between biblical studies and 'mainstream' psychologies is reflected not so much in antipathy towards these psychologies among biblical scholars, but rather in an apparent ignorance of their existence. Whether psychology is welcomed or criticized in relation to studying the Bible, it is clear that most writers in this field (the vast majority of whom are not psychologists) understand psychology to mean depth psychotherapies. Yet the first step in evaluating the usefulness of psychology in approaching the Bible is to be clear which psychology we mean: An awareness of the variety of psychological approaches is helpful in introducing a critical perspective on the use of psychology in reading the Bible It is always right to be wary of any claim to have the psychological approach to a particular passage, and more appropriate to see it as one approach among a variety which may be possible.20 An indication of the range of 'mainstream' psychologies is given below. Key features of 'mainstream' psychologies are that, psychology) approach alongside cognitive and 'psychodynamic' (depth psych ology) approaches. 17 Ethology is the study of animal behaviour in its natural setting, and from a biological perspective. Its best-known exponents are the Nobel Prize winners Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen. 18 See P. Granqvist, 'On the Relationship between Secular and Divine Relationships: An Emerging Attachment Perspective and a Critique of "Depth" Approaches', International Journal for the Psychology of Religion 16 (2006), pp. 1-18, for a robust delineation of the distinction between 'mainstream' and 'depth' psychologies. 19 19 Hewstone et al., Psychology, devote six pages to Freud and one page to Jung in their 500-page textbook. Somewhat more space (about 10%) is devoted to Freud (though not Jung) in the American textbooks (see n. 1), reflecting the greater influence of psychoanalysis in the USA than in Britain. It is more diffi cult to generalize about the situation in mainland Europe, which is more diverse. 20 F. Watts, 'Approaching the Gospels Psychologically', in id. (ed.), Jesus and Psychology, p. 4.</page><page sequence="7">7 PSYCHOLOGY AND THE BIBLE unlike depth psychologies, they do not attribute a causal role to the unconscious; they take observable behaviours rather than inferred mental processes as their starting point; and they base their theories on 'normal' rather than 'pathological' human functioning. Primary research within these disciplines forms the basis of widespread practice in education, health, and social care settings. This list is simplified and by no means exhaustive: • Cognitive psychology: the study of human thought pro cesses using models based on information-processing theory. • Social psychology: the study of how human beings relate to each other in groups of varying sizes, often using systems theory. • Developmental psychology: the study of human change and continuity over the lifespan. • Personality psychology: the study of differences between in dividuals, which may include differences in aptitude. • Evolutionary psychology: the study of the evolutionary ori gins and survival value of human behaviours. • Biological psychology: the study of the relationship between brain and behaviour (neuropsychology), and between bodily states and behaviour. These psychologies all rest on a critical realist epistemology21 and employ both qualitative22 and quantitative23 research meth ods, thus modelling themselves on the empirical natural sciences. Recent years have also seen the rise of postmodern psychologies. These form a small and diverse, but increasingly influential group on the edge of 'mainstream' psychology that favours a social constructionist epistemology,24 and employs discursive re search methods.25 Even on the basis of this simplified list, it should be apparent that it is very rarely possible to make meaningful statements about 'psychology' in relation to the Bible. Things that are true of one 21 For a full exposition of critical realism see R. Bhaskar, The Possibility of Naturalism:Naturalism: A Philosophical Critique of the Contemporary Human Sciences (London: Routledge, 1998). 22 Examples include grounded theory and interpretative phenomenological analysis. 23 Mainstream psychologies place a heavy emphasis on the use of inferential statistics in interpreting empirical data. 24 For a discussion of the implications of social constructionism for psychology see K. Gergen, An Invitation to Social Constructionism (Newbury Park, CA: Sage, 2009). 25 Examples include discourse analytic and rhetorical-responsive approaches.</page><page sequence="8">JOANNA COLLICUTT 8 psychology will not necessarily be true of all psychologies. In particular, things that are true of depth psychologies will often not be true of 'mainstream' psychologies, with which they stand in tension. Some commonly stated objections to the use of psychology in studying the Bible seem to be based on a simple lack of awareness of this point. In the following section these objections are reconsidered, together with some more fundamen tal objections to psychology whose origins lie in literary theory and theology. III.III. Objections to Using Psychology in the Study of the Bible 1. 1. Objections Based on a Restrictive Definition of Psychology In an article reviewing 'psychological and psychoanalytical approaches to interpreting the Bible'26 (but in fact restricted to psychoanalysis and psychiatry), John Pilch sets out their alleged culture-bound 'inadequacy' under three broad headings: anachronism, ethnocentrism, and individualism. These well rehearsed objections to psychology will now be considered in turn. The charge of anachronism. It is said that the discipline of modern psychology emerged in a particular time and place dis tant from the origins of the texts themselves. It therefore cannot be applied to them. Anachronism is an issue that faces any present-day approach to ancient literature, and is not confined to psychology. However, it is also an issue that is perhaps overstated.2 Seen within the broader sweep of human evolution, the time that has elapsed since the writing of biblical texts is but a moment. In the words of Ε. H. Gombrich, talking of the fundamentals of human behaviour that have arisen through natural selection: 'There hasn't been enough time for us to change!'28 Secondly, anachronism is itself an essential feature of a sacred text that was written and redacted over the best part of a mil lennium. Later portions of the text arose in part as a result of retrojecting the assumptions and concerns of their time on to 26 J. Pilch, 'Psychological and Psychoanalytical Approaches to Interpreting the Bible', Biblical Theology Bulletin 27 (1997), pp. 112-16. 27 Watts, 'Approaching the Gospels Psychologically', p. 8. 28 E. Gombrich, A Little History of the World, trans. C. Mustill (London: Yale University Press, 2005), p. 10.</page><page sequence="9">9 PSYCHOLOGY AND THE BIBLE earlier portions in a bid to make sense of the current in the light of the old.29 Thus, a present-day anachronistic reading may, in some respects, stand in the tradition of the text itself. Nevertheless, present-day readings arise in a post-critical context where the issue of anachronism is recognised,30 and these read ings should demonstrate an awareness of the issue, if not also some means of managing it. In fact 'mainstream' psychologies are in a strong position to do just this. They are finely attuned to the challenge of applying research findings to situations that are different from those in which they were originally tested, and they have developed rigor ous procedures underpinned by a conceptual system referred to as 'generalizability theory' to address it.31 They can go at least some of the way towards differentiating those aspects of human behaviour that are diachronically stable from those that are de pendent on temporal context. 'Mainstream' psychologies are thus also able to address the second (and related) 'inad equacy'—ethnocentrism. The charge of ethnocentrism. It is said that psychology is in the business of delineating universal rules for the explanation, prediction, and control of human behaviour. These rules origin ate in the culture of the scientific industrialized West and are inappropriately imposed on cultures that differ profoundly from it. Again, it is important to specify which psychology is in ques tion, for the aspiration to 'psychological universals' is not a fea ture of all psychologies.32 At one extreme stands Jung's theory of the collective unconscious,33 which is by definition a 29 There are countless examples in both Old and New Testaments. The books of Chronicles are a good Old Testament example, and aspects of Luke's redac tion of Mark (e.g. Luke 5:19 and Mark 2:4) are examples in the New Testament. 30 See J. Barton, Reading the Old Testament (London: Darton, Longman and Todd, 1996), p. 98 f. for a related discussion on the canonical method. It may, in some respects, stand in the tradition of the text itself, but because it has arisen in a post-critical milieu it is a self-consciously adopted approach, as opposed to the natural and only available way to read the Bible. 31 L. Cronbach, G. Gleser, H. Nanda, and N. Rajaratnam, The Dependability of of Behavioral Measurements: Theory of Generalizability for Scores and Profiles (New York: John Wiley, 1972). 32 A. Norenzayan and S. Heine, 'Psychological Universale: What Are They and How Can We Know?', Psychological Bulletin 131 (2005), pp. 763-84. 33 The collective unconscious is said to be a defining feature of the deep psychology of all peoples, the details of its surface expression varying with local culture. See C. Jung, Archetypes and the Collective Unconscious, trans. R. F. C. Hull (London: Routledge, 1959/1990). There is a partial analogy here</page><page sequence="10">JOANNA COLLICUTT 10 psychological universal. (It is perhaps its irrefutable claim to universality that has made Jungian theory so attractive to biblical scholars.) At the other extreme stand postmodern psychologies which specialize in the in-depth study of the small and local, and only claim modest degrees of generalizability.34 Most 'main stream' psychologies lie in between these extremes, and there is a group of psychologies35 (cultural psychology, indigenous psy chologies, and cross-cultural psychology36) that take the issue of ethnocentrism as their primary focus of study. While the status of psychological universale is still vigorously debated within these psychologies,37 and there is massive cultural variation at the surface level of behaviour, an increasing body of research data indicates that some fundamental aspects of human psychology are present in all cultures.38 These include a prefer ence for the familiar over the strange, together with a growing tolerance of the strange with repeated exposure to it; an improve ment in skilled performance when it is carried out in a sympathetic group setting; the logical rules that are employed for attributing causality; a set of prototypical emotions (grief, fear, anger, sur prise, disgust, and joy); the fundamental rules of aesthetic appre ciation; certain patterns of attachment behaviour shown by the young child towards his carers; and the ordered sequence of epis temological stages attained by the developing child. Furthermore, from a theoretical standpoint, evolutionary psychologists argue that the psychological building blocks—cog nitive modules—which form the basis for human behaviours39 with structuralism—but the phenomena involved are dynamic and psychological rather than static and linguistic. 34 'emphasis is placed on the particulars of human experience and social life - by taking into account matters such as history, language, and context that rela tivize the knowledge gained to the individuals and situations studied and to those doing the inquiry'; R. Elliott, C. Fischer, and D.

Kirkpatrick, Attachment, Evolution and the Psychology of Religion (New York: Guilford Press, 2005).</page><page sequence="11">11 PSYCHOLOGY AND THE BIBLE evolved through natural selection acting on the gene pool of the whole species homo sapiens. These cognitive modules are thus by definition a feature of all peoples. For example, it has been argued that a particular combination of these modules gives rise to a universal human tendency to believe in supernatural agents who can read people's thoughts,40 a belief that is ex pressed at several points in the Bible. So, while psychologists are rightly very cautious about claim ing universal ׳applicability for their theories, they have been able to identify some areas within their disciplines that could inform the reading of texts produced in an ancient Near Eastern setting. Nevertheless, it has been repeatedly asserted that a specific fea ture of this setting—its 'collectivism character—presents an insu perable problem for psychology, which is assumed to be by nature individualist. The charge of individualism. It is said that psychology is concerned with the individual.41 This is because it is a product of Western post-Enlightenment thought. The pre-modern cul tures from which the biblical texts emerged were 'collectivist', and 'imagining in the ancient world the existence of a post-enlightenment notion of individuality'42 is a serious error to be avoided by biblical scholars. Again, some psychologies are more individualist than others: for example, cognitive psychology is largely concerned with the individual, but within both 'mainstream' and depth psychologies there are branches that study the individual-in-relationship (for instance object relations theory and attachment theory), and of course social psychology focuses on group processes and social identity.43 40 J. Bering and D. Johnson, '"Oh Lord... you perceive my thoughts from afar": Recursiveness and the Evolution of Supernatural Agency', Journal of Cognition Cognition and Culture 5 (2005), pp. 118-42. 41 See e.g. S. Schneiders, The Revelatory Text: Interpreting the New Testament as as Sacred Scripture (Collegeville, MN: Liturgical Press, 1999), p. 118. 42 J. Elliott, 'On Wooing Crocodiles for Fun and Profit: Confessions of an Intact Admirer', in Pilch (ed.), Social Scientific Models, p. 11. An oft-cited ex ample of the inappropriate application of a post-Enlightenment individualist mindset to the Bible is the reading of the Psalms of ancient Israel as the private musings of an individual poet rather than as resources for collective worship or statements of national identity. 43 See e.g. H. Tajfel, 'Social Psychology of Intergroup Relations', Annual Review Review of Psychology 33 (1982), pp. 1-39; M. Brewer and W. Gardner, 'Who is this "We"? Levels of Collective Identity and Self-representations', Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 71 (1996), pp. 83-93.</page><page sequence="12">JOANNA COLLICUTT 12 Moreover, empirical psychology has the capacity to bring blanket statements such as 'First-century Mediterraneans were collectivist persons'44 under critical scrutiny. The current con sensus in psychology is that a hard-and-fast divide between in dividualism and collectivism cannot be sustained on the basis of the empirical evidence.45 Like most other aspects of human be haviour, the degree of individualism a person exhibits is highly dependent on the demands of a given situation, and is not fully determined either by culture or individual temperament. A recent review article, noting that individualism and collectivism are variably and ill-defined in the literature, concluded that 'the scientific value of these constructs is [in danger of becoming] seriously compromised [and] theoretically empty'.46 In add ition, while there is no doubt that the concept of 'the self became reified in a distinctive sense in early modern times,47 it is highly likely that 'individualism and collectivism always coex isted nor can it be concluded that the ages that preceded the emergence of a strong sense of self in literature, the arts, or philosophy were devoid of the concept of self'.48 This section has demonstrated that 'mainstream' psychologies have methods in place for dealing with anachronism and ethno centrism, and are not limited to the study of individuals. Evidence for the existence of some psychological universale has been noted, and the assumption that individualism was absent from pre-modern societies has been criticized. It is reasonable to conclude that 'mainstream' psychologies can, within certain limits and with due caution, be applied to the people of the ancient Near East. However, a further objection to using psych ology in the study of the Bible can be raised: the Bible is not an ancient Near Eastern people, it is an ancient Near Eastern text, 44 Β. Malina and J. Pilch, Social-Science Commentary on the Letters of Paul (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 2006), p. 23. 45 See e.g. H.

This objection is considered in the next section. 2.2. Objections to Non-literary Approaches to the Biblical Text It is generally acknowledged that psychology may be em ployed as a hermeneutic tool in biblical studies. Readings of the Bible that use psychology as a resource to provide theoretical structure or enrichment are fairly common and relatively uncon troversial.49 Here psychology is clearly being used in the service of a literary approach to the text. Objections start to be raised when it is suggested that the role of psychology might be extended to the study of the people 'behind the text'. This use of psychology is predicated on the assumption that the Bible can communicate something of interest and importance about people. The people in question may be the writer, the reader, the people depicted in the text, some combin ation of all of these, or human beings in general. This would also be the natural assumption of a naive reader of the Bible. However, this view of the text as pointing beyond itself is seen as problematic by many biblical scholars. The nature of the problem has moved over the last hundred years from an empir ically based observation that the Bible is a text that does not in practice tell us very much about the people behind it, through the embrace of modern literary theory that asserts that the liter ary scholar should not be interested in the people behind a text, and finally to a postmodern view of language and culture that holds that texts by their nature cannot tell us anything about the people behind them because, despite surface appearances, texts are not referential. As mentioned above, the sentimental and speculative lives of Jesus that appeared in the nineteenth century were discredited on several grounds, including the unwarranted 'psychologizing' of the Gospels. By the early years of the twentieth century the idea that anything could be discovered about the 'personality' (itself arguably an anachronistic concept) of Jesus from the New Τestament documents was shown to be highly questionable. The psychoanalytic work of Freud was beginning to be 49 See e.g. Μ. A. Tolbert, 'The Prodigal Son: An Essay in Literary Criticism from a Psychoanalytic Perspective', Semeia 9 (1977), pp. 1-20; K. Blessing, 'Family Systems Psychology as Hermeneutic', in Ellens and Rollins (eds.), Psychology Psychology and the Bible, pp. 185-208. 50 Key examples include E. Renan, Vie de Jesus (1863); J. R. Seeley, Ecce Homo (1866); J. Weiss, The Preaching of Jesus and the Kingdom of God (1892).</page><page sequence="14">JOANNA COLLICUTT 14 influential, and the concepts of 'projection' (the identification of aspects of the reader's psyche in the text) and 'wish fulfilment' (the identification of the reader's unmet needs in the text) pro vided a helpful perspective on the issue. The consequent shift of interest among biblical scholars away from reading the gospels as windows into the life of Jesus, or even of the evangelists and their communities, was perhaps ini tiallytially a pragmatic reaction. It was given a theoretical rationale by changes that were occurring within the discipline of literary criti cism. Here there was a shift away from reading poetry as a window into the personality of the poet, as part of a more gen eral reaction against the excesses of Romanticism. The core busi ness of literary studies was being reclaimed as the analysis of the nature, aesthetics, and meaning of texts rather than the psycho logical analysis of people who wrote them.51 This provided a model for biblical studies. Biblical scholars no longer needed to be frustrated by the shadowy identities of the biblical authors and subjects, or the increasing evidence for the historical unre liability of the books of the Bible; they too could reclaim their core business as an analysis of the nature, aesthetics, and mean ing of the biblical texts. Once literary theory came to dominate biblical studies there was little room for approaches to the Bible that treated it as a means of understanding historical events and human behaviour. Psychology consequently came to be seen as an alien intrusion into a domain that had essentially become a branch of literary criticism. Literary criticism and psychology were seen as mutu ally exclusive,52 therefore psychology was of no relevance to bib lical studies. This situation was intensified in the second half of the twentieth century, with the development of more radical approaches to literature influenced by the structural 51 The issues are clearly set out in the debate between C. S. Lewis and Ε. M. W. Tillyard in The Personal Heresy. A Controversy (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1939). Lewis was responding to Tillyard's 1930 book Milton (London: Chatto and Windus), which was based on the premiss that poetry expresses the state of mind of the poet. Lewis's point is that the value of a work of litera ture lies not in the genius of its author but in the work itself. He is rejecting the idea that something of the poet's inner subjective mental life is uniquely accessed via his poetry. For Lewis literature is referential, but it refers to objective realities not subjective mysteries. 52 Barton describes an attitude held in common by structuralist, new critical, and canonical critical approaches to the Bible: 'the essential flaw in asking about the intentions of an author, rather than about the inherent meaning of a text, is that to do so is to abandon literary criticism for psychology'; Reading the Old Testament, p. 168 (my italics).</page><page sequence="15">15 PSYCHOLOGY AND THE BIBLE anthropology of Claude Levi-Strauss, in which language is viewed as essentially self-referential, the carrier of the rules of a culture rather than the expression of the thoughts or experi ences of individual human beings.53 With the advent of postmodernism the whole enterprise of reading texts has been turned on its head; the notion that people produce discourses has receded and the notion that dis courses shape people has become dominant.54 Texts are studied as discourses that float free from their authors, no longer with an inherent meaning, but a meaning that is constructed by the read ing community. The response of the readers is understood to be shaped by the discursive environment within which they are situated. This discursive environment may include psychological discourse, hence the acceptance of psychology in the context of reader-response biblical criticism alongside the continuing rejec tion of psychology as a tool for connecting with the 'people behind the text'. The ideas outlined above (that the biblical texts do not in practice tell us anything reliable about the people behind them; that biblical scholarship is by definition a branch of literary criti cism and not a branch of psychology; that texts cannot by their nature refer to anything beyond themselves) have been highly influential on, if not axiomatic for, the academic study of the Bible in recent years. Yet each is open to challenge, and the challenges will now be considered in turn. In practice many scholars treat biblical texts as if they do tell of people. It is clear that naive readers of the Bible treat it as a source of information about the patriarchs, prophets, and people of Israel, Jesus of Nazareth, Paul of Tarsus, and other key figures in the early church such as Peter and the 'Beloved Disciple'. It is less often acknowledged that critical scholars also treat the text in this way. For example, the abandonment of the old and new quests for the historical Jesus in favour of a 'third quest', which locates Jesus firmly in first-century Palestinian 53 C. Levi-Strauss, Structural Anthropology, trans. C. Jacobson and B. Schoepf (New York: Basic Books, 1974). Levi-Strauss was critical of Jung's approach to myth as something emanating from and expressive of the human mind, arguing that this was incompatible with the arbitrary nature of its signification, and this may have added to a suspicion of psychology among structuralist critics. However, his argument has itself been criticized; see T. Pavel, Fictional Worlds (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1989), p. 3 54 L. Lovlie, 'Postmodernism and Subjectivity' in S. Kvale (ed.), Psychology and and Postmodernism (London: Sage, 1999), pp. 118-34; 1· Parker, 'Discourse: Definitions and Contradictions', Philosophical Psychology 3 (1990), pp. 189-204.</page><page sequence="16">JOANNA COLLICUTT 16 Judaism,55 has not seen an abandonment of questions about Jesus' self-understanding.56 Scholars address these questions partly through contextual consideration of archaeological, an thropological, and socio-historical evidence, but mainly through direct consultation of ancient texts.57 An example from Pauline scholarship is provided by the popu lar writing of E. P. Sanders, who freely writes about Paul's frame of mind, at one point describing it as 'filled with conflicts' and 'apprehension',58 a frame of mind directly (and convincingly) inferred from the text of the letter to the Romans. Reflecting on apocalyptic literature, Christopher Rowland concludes, on the basis of a very careful reading of relevant texts, that while some might see the 'apocalyptic framework as merely a conveni ent device for the message of the writer the likelihood is, however, that we have indications here of the experiences of early Jewish visionaries'.59 These examples demonstrate that a critical approach to the Bible has not in practice prevented scholars from treating some biblical texts as if they can indicate something—and something useful—about the people behind them. The close relationship between biblical and literary studies is historically contingent and need not be normative. The academic study of the Bible has historically come to be defined as the study of a particular sacred text as an end in itself, not as a means of gaining information about human beings, or indeed about God. It follows from this definition that the appropriate discipline on which to draw is that of literary studies, not psych ology or theology. This drawing of boundaries around the enter prise of biblical studies is, however, not given in the nature of things; it is fundamentally a political action of the academy(ies). There is, not surprisingly, some circularity in the arguments 55 G. Theissen and D. Winter. The Quest for the Plausible Jesus, trans. Μ. E.

It is reasonable to require academic approaches to the Bible to be systematic and rigorous. It is reasonable to approach the Bible from the perspective of literary studies. It is reasonable, indeed helpful, to draw a distinction between literary criticism and psychology. But none of this constitutes an argument for the exclusive legitimacy of literary criticism in the study of the Bible. It is reasonable to insist that a text, ancient or modern, is not a trans parent window into the soul of another human being, but a literary creation that is apt to follow quite non-psychological laws of its own And yet books do not come into being by spontaneous gener ation. They are written by members of the species Homo sapiens To refuse to ask psychological, or even psychoanalytical, questions of these texts is to limit our[selves] to those questions that the historians and textual scholars are willing to declare legitimate. It also has the graver effect of silencing the ancients: of refusing the vital testimony they can give on great questions of who we humans are, why we act as we do, and how we may wisely direct our short and often painful lives.60 It may be countered that this aspiration to hear the 'testimony of the ancients' is simply rendered meaningless if one is approach ing the text from the standpoint of a literary theory that treats it as non-referential. Yet this is merely to assert a 'theory of read ing, not an empirically based description of how particular sorts of text actually function'.61 That is, if the text is being read as if it is non-referential then in this context it is meaningless to ask questions about its referents, but this does not prevent the text from functioning referentially in other contexts (especially in what some would call 'the real world'). Indeed, the primary nature of certain texts may be referential. The issue then be comes one of genre identification—of discerning the most appro priate way(s) to read a text. It may not be appropriate to read a scientific treatise or even a poem as the expression of the per sonal concerns of its author; but a suicide note is a different kettle of fish. Scholarly exegetes make this sort of distinction fluently and unconsciously, for instance in their consensus read ing of Rom. 7:15-21 as a rhetorical device with no personal 60 D.

It is legitimate, if not required, to read certain types of texts as referential. Contemporary 'mainstream' psychologists clearly identify some texts as referring to the concerns of their authors by describing them as 'verbal reports'62 (a term that is not far removed from the biblical notion of 'witness'63). There is no question here of psychologists claiming that a verbal report is a simple reading off of the contents of consciousness. Psychologists are, for the most part, aware of the significant philosophical problems associated with the concept of introspec tion.64 Moreover, there is good empirical evidence from psych ology itself indicating that people do not have direct access to the psychological processes behind their beliefs and past actions,65 and that they sometimes have an interest in presenting them selves in a certain light (the 'social desirability effect'), depending on the demand characteristics of the situation.66 In the light of this evidence, 'mainstream' psychologies ac knowledge that the connection between a verbal report and its referents may not be simple or transparent. Nevertheless, they posit that a connection exists,67 and that it is systematic and amenable to analysis. They have also developed methods for identifying social desirability effects and taking them into ac count. For instance, the 'validity' of a verbal report (often ex pressed as responses to questionnaire items) is the degree of congruence between the report and its referents. One type of validity is 'predictive validity'—the accuracy with which a verbal report predicts subsequent behaviour. As we have seen, people are often not accurate in analysing their own thought 62 C. Abraham and S. Hampson, Ά Social Cognition Approach to Health Psychology: Philosophical and Methodological Issues', Psychology and Health 11 (1996), pp. 223-41. 6 R.

The acceptance or not of this referential accuracy can be a matter of life and death in health-care contexts, for instance with regard to inter view or questionnaire responses indicating propensity to self-harm.69 It is possible to read some texts 'diagnostically'. One major concern in contemporary mainstream psychology, especially in the contexts of health, education, and occupation, is the inter pretation of tests of aptitude (such as IQ and memory tests) and attainment (such as academic examinations). Here the psycho logical mode is not that of a 'verbal report' on events; instead the text is seen as the outcome of cognitive processes. The text is understood (and evaluated) as a 'written response' the end-point of a psychological event of which it is part—'diagnostic' rather than 'referential'. The writer is not seen as revealing his inner mental life either by consciously reported introspection, or by unwitting disclosure of intra-psychic conflicts through the use of symbols or affective tone. Instead, the writer is seen as perform ing certain cognitive-linguistic functions (such as remembering, generating grammatical structures, word-finding, logical deduc tion) as he engages in the very process of writing. An example of a biblical text that can be read in this way is 1 Cor. 1:14-16. Here Paul makes a factual referential statement, but then modi fies it as the result of a more systematic attempt at recall. While there is no doubt that this text can be read simply in terms of social discourse or linguistic structures, there is also a strong case to be made for understanding it psychologically as the outcome 68 See e.g. I. Ajzen and M. Fishbein, Understanding Attitudes and Predicting Social Social Behaviour (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1980); C. Abraham and P. Sheeran, 'Implications of Goal Theories for the Theories of Reasoned Action and Planned Behaviour', Current Psychology 22 (2003), pp. 264-80; A. Bandura, 'Exercise of Personal Agency through the Self-efficacy Mechanisms', in R. Schwarzer (ed.), Self-efficacy: Thought Control of Action (Washington, DC: Hemisphere Publishing Corporation, 1992), pp. 3-38.This phenomenon is de picted in several biblical narratives (e.g. Luke 15:18 ff., Ruth 1:16 ff.). 69 For an example see A. T. Beck, G. Brown, R. J. Berchick, B. L. Stewart, and R. A. Steer, 'Relationship between Hopelessness and Ultimate Suicide: A Replication with Psychiatric Outpatients', Focus 4 (2006), pp. 291-96. In this prospective study of 1,958 outpatients, hopelessness, as measured by the Beck Hopelessness Scale, was significantly related to eventual suicide. A scale cut-off score of 9 or above identified 16 (94.2%) of the 17 patients who eventually committed suicide.</page><page sequence="20">JOANNA COLLICUTT 20 of cognitive processing,70 and, in view of the use of ίνα in v. 15, also as psychologically instrumental.71 In this section I have argued that it is possible to view biblical texts as human artefacts that carry information about particular human beings or examples of general principles in human psych ology. This view does not arise from a category error (mistakenly seeing something that is essentially literary as something that is essentially human); it is simply a way of approaching the texts that differs from dominant literary approaches. The applicability of any given psychological approach to any given text requires careful consideration, and will be determined in part by the lit erary genre assigned to it. However, literary genre and psycho logical mode do not map on to each other in a simple way (for instance an intention to commit suicide may be communicated by letter, poem, or story). 3. Theological Objections Based on the Alleged Reductionist Nature Nature of Psychology There has been a tendency in some therapeutic branches of psychology (and psychiatry) to impose psychological norms of health and well-being on texts. Sometimes this seems to contort 72 the text to force it into a modern therapeutic framework. Sometimes theological content seems to be reduced to a symp torn of mental illness.73 The charge of ideological reductionism is justly directed at some psychotherapeutic readings of some biblical texts, but it should be noted that a similar criticism could be applied to advocacy readings—liberation, feminist, 70 A number of psychologically informed avenues of exploration follow from this. For instance, it seems that Paul has a problem with ,source memory' (re calling the context of an event rather than the event itself) on this occasion. This is most likely because he baptized so many people that he couldn't readily recall where and when each baptism had taken place. However, an alternative sugges tion is that the source memory problem is intrinsic to Paul, arising from a tem porary state such as fatigue or anxiety, or a more enduring health condition (such as epilepsy). 71 Psychologists are paying increasing attention to goals as a framework within which to understand human behaviour. For instance, Robert Emmons argues that much can be learnt from what people are typically trying to do—'personal strivings', placed in the context of their wider or ultimate concerns; R. Emmons, The The Psychology of Ultimate Concerns (New York: Guilford Press, 1999). 72 For instance R. Leslie, Jesus the Counsellor (Nashville, TN: Abingdon Press, 1982). 73 For instance G. Stein, 'The Voices that Ezekiel Hears—Psychiatry in the Old Testament', British Journal of Psychiatry 196 (2010), p. 101.</page><page sequence="21">21 21 PSYCHOLOGY AND THE BIBLE queer, etc.—which have nevertheless been recognized as theo logically valuable. The theological objection to 'mainstream' psychologies is rather different. As noted earlier, these psychologies are defined by their embrace of the methods of empirical science. Empirical methods are associated in many people's minds with philosoph ical positivism,74 a diverse group of approaches which have in common the view that rational or empirical techniques are the method of choice for addressing all questions of fact or meaning in life. This view is clearly at odds with traditional theological approaches that favour revealed knowledge, supernatural explan ations, and moral values. The association of science with posi tivism is perhaps a reason that empirical psychology has been viewed with suspicion by the theological community. Yet the commitment to empirical methods in psychology en tails neither positivism nor the related phenomenon of scientific reductionism. It is probably fair to observe that Freud pursued a positivist agenda,75 and at times saw science as something that could provide support for the atheistic views of thinkers such as Feuerbach.76 However, this is not a feature of most contempor ary psychologies, which embrace empirical methodologies to in vestigate human behaviour77 rather than to address metaphysical questions.78 Indeed, psychologists who study human religiosity draw very clear demarcation lines around what are and what are not appropriate questions to ask of their data,79 and several have 74 Ε. Brunner, 'Biblical Psychology', in God and Man: Four Essays on the Nature Nature of Personality (London: SCM Press, 1936), pp. 136-78. 75 J.

Freud, 'The Future of an Illusion', in The Standard Edition of the Complete Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, vol. 21, trans. J. Strachey (London: Hogarth Press, 1927/1968). 77 The philosophical roots of modern psychology are rather to be found in the pragmatism of John Dewey: see e.g. Experience and Nature (Mineola, NY: Dover, 1925/2000). 7 For instance, there has always been a clear distinction drawn between 'meth odological behaviourism' and 'metaphysical behavioursim': see J.

In order to do this the production and recep tion of texts will be located in a wider framework of psycho logical processes. IV. A Psychological Process View of the Biblical Texts, their Production and Reception The psychological processes at work in the production and reception of biblical (and other sacred) texts are summarized in Fig. 1. This is essentially a stimulus-response chain, with a given text being seen both as human response and as a stimulus that may evoke a human response. This is a highly simplified diagram, giving a broad-brush overview, and with arrows moving in only one direction. It therefore does not do full justice to the multiple mutual interdependencies of the processes at work (for instance, it is clear that the writer of a text is not only influenced by her social context, but also acts on this context, and may influence it significantly). It would be possible to construct detailed elabor ations of portions of this diagram which delineate the complexities of the processes involved at any one point. However, the aim of Figure 1 is simply to indicate the principal features of a psychological process approach. The first of these features is that the text is understood to be evidence of a behavioural response of the writer to a stimulus— something located within her physical or social environment. This 'something' may be an event that she has witnessed or in which she has participated, a report he has received, a document she has read, a request to write, and so on. The immediate social environment, itself influenced by the wider social and cultural milieu, will influence how the 'something' is experienced and what sense is made of it. The writer's personal history, goals, agendas, and cognitive-processing ability will also influence this (for instance, the request to write might be experienced as a pleasurable compliment by one individual but as a burdensome 80 F. Watts, Theology and Psychology (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2002); id., 'Reflections on Psychology and Religion', The Psychologist, 24 (2011), pp. 268-9.</page><page sequence="23">23 PSYCHOLOGY AND THE BIBLE Fig. i. The production and reception of biblical texts depicted as a psychological process demand by another). Data from the environment usually com bines in a well-balanced way with internal psychological factors (such as the individual's beliefs and goals) to determine the response. However, in individuals with mental health conditions, internal psychic factors may often dominate external environ mental factors, producing a response that is literally 'unbalanced'.</page><page sequence="24">JOANNA COLLICUTT 24 Here the external stimulus may merely act as a trigger for the rehearsal of pre-existing preoccupations or delusions (for instance, an innocent request to write being experienced as part of a plot aimed at the individual's public humiliation). The final outcome of an individual's cognitive and affective processing may be the production of a written text, but this will only happen if certain conditions are met. These include a positive attitude to writing or the goal that may be achieved through the final product, and the formation of an effective behavioural intention to write—all psychological factors81—plus more socially determined factors such as means and opportunity to write. The text that is produced is understood to stand in a complex but systematic relation to the cognitive-affective processing and behavioural response that produced it, as discussed in Section III. It is the expression of the writer's assumptive world (including her understanding of human psychology), her personal goals, her affective state, cognitive skill, literary repertoire and—crucially— her response to the 'something' that was the occasion for the writing. Not every text can yield information on all these psychological factors, but some texts can yield information on some of these. A rigorous approach to the task of recovering this information is likely to be enhanced by the use of appropriate psychological models and methods. Here the task is not so much one of identifying the literary genre of a text as its psychological mode and functions. On this analysis writing is seen as a reaction to an encounter with something, and also very often as an instrumental act whose aim is to communicate something. Likewise the text is a response, but also a stimulus (either in the form its writer may have intended, or in some other way) to a reader (or hearer). The text then becomes the 'something', situated in a social context, to which the reader responds. Like the writer, the reader's response is influenced by his social environment, itself influenced by the wider cultural milieu, his personal history, goals, agendas, his cognitive processing ability, and his mental health status. In the case of a text that has been revered by a religious or literary tradition, reception history will be an additional influence. 81 The theory of planned behaviour draws a distinction between a positive attitude and the formation of an intention that is effected in actual behaviour, delineating the factors that may obstruct the path from attitude to corresponding action (Ajzen and Fishbein, Understanding Attitudes; M. Fishbein and I. Ajzen, Belief,Belief, Attitude, Intention, and Behaviour: An Introduction to Theory and Research [Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley, 1975]).This distinction between attitude, inten tion, and behaviour is recognized in Matt. 21:28-30.</page><page sequence="25">25 PSYCHOLOGY AND THE BIBLE However, the most immediate influence on how the encounter with the text is experienced is the attitude the reader adopts as he approaches it. For instance, if he treats the text as sacred, something with the potential to transform his life, he will actively inhibit certain modes of processing, such as the humorous or critical, and attune his attention to aspects of the text that can more easily be received as holding transcendent significance for him. In particular he may treat the text as a form of communi cation from his ultimate 'significant other',82 consciously choosing to avoid objectifying it and instead attend to its agency as 'other'.8 On the other hand (and this may occur in the same individual on a different occasion), if he is reading the text as a scholar, he may approach it in a quite different way. Attitudes tend to be shaped by communities and triggered by situations;84 an attitude to the text as sacred is thus more easily adopted in a place of worship inhabited by a community of faith; an attitude to the text as object of critical study is more easily adopted in an academic institution inhabited by a community of scholars.85 The response of the reader to the text can be understood as a cognitive-affective appropriation which may, under certain con ditions, find its expression in a behavioural response. For a sacred text this response may consist of an attempt to 'live out' principles or follow examples from the text. It may be a verbal response of praise or worship. Finally, it may be a written response, which may itself later be ascribed sacred status. Having set out a framework and summarized the psychological processes at work, some examples of how psychological models have and might be used to study the production and reception of the Bible (and other sacred texts) will now be considered. 82 In a public lecture entitled 'Reading the Texts and Facing the Future' Tariq Ramadan summed up a 'spiritual' attitude to Abrahamic sacred texts as 'reading the book of someone I am trying to love' (9 July 2007, British Library, London). 83 P.

Here there will often be social and environmental signals to indicate which mode of reading is to be adopted on a given occasion (for instance reading in the chapel versus reading in the lecture room).</page><page sequence="26">JOANNA COLLICUTT 26 V. Possibilities for Using Psychology in the Study of the Production and Reception of the Text ι ι. Production of the Text (Examples) The psychology of memory. A text can be written as a re sponse to something without involving a conscious act of remem bering. However, some literary genres, for instance 'testimony', have an explicit dependence on memory. The psychology of human memory may therefore be able to add to our understand ing of the processes involved in the production of such texts. Several biblical scholars have indeed used findings from cogni tive psychology in this area. For instance, in his 1998 book The The Birth of Christianity John Dominic Crossan uses Daniel Schacter's seminal work on constructive memory.86 Crossan applies his findings to a consideration of synoptic parallels, making the entirely valid point that, because witnesses often share assumptions about the physical and social world, consensus between them may indicate more about these assumptions and less about the events to which they refer, and thus does not guarantee the accuracy of their testimony.87 He uses this to argue for caution in interpreting texts that claim to be 'eyewit ness testimony'. In contrast, Richard Bauckham holds that the nature of the Jesus material makes it particularly memorable, and he supports this assertion by citing a (selective) range of findings from experimental psychology.88 Both Crossan and Bauckham are primarily interested in the referential nature of the biblical text, and use the psychology of memory as a means of establishing the limits that human psych ology may place on the relationship between a text and the 86 In a series of experiments Schacter and colleagues have been able to show that remembering is essentially a constructive act that involves making inferences about the past based on what is currently known and accessible, rather than a simple read-off from a literal reproduction of events that has been retrieved from a memory store. See e.g. D. Schacter, K. Norman, and W. Koutstaal, 'The Cognitive Neuroscience of Constructive Memory', Annual Review of Psychology 4g (1998), pp. 289-318; D. Schacter and S. Slotnick, 'The Cognitive Neuroscience of Memory Distortion', Neuron 44 (2004), pp. 149-60. 87 J. D. Crossan, The Birth of Christianity (Edinburgh: Τ and Τ Clark, 1999), p. 68.

Here psychology is essentially acting as a servant of a historical approach driven by a theological agenda, where the surface question is the veridical nature of the text, and the deep question is the nature of biblical truth. However, it is also possible (and arguable preferable) to use the psychology of memory to address psychological questions—that is to examine the nature of the psychological processes involved— in their own right. An example of this is provided by the work of Robert Mclver. Biblical scholars have long been interested in the nature of the hypothetical oral transmission on which some texts may be based, and have treated the nature and capacity of human memory as important considerations in this area.89 More re cently Mclver has attempted to apply concepts from cognitive psychology to this question. He argues that the degree of simi larity between corresponding portions of text in several synoptic parallels can reliably indicate whether these are based on two distinct types of memory identified by psychologists: 'gist' or 'verbatim' memory. Applying quantitative criteria of verbal simi larity to the double material in Matthew and Luke, he concludes that the part of the oral tradition devoted to narratives relied on gist memory, and the part devoted to sayings relied on verbatim 90 memory. Social psychology. The Bible is a collection of documents of varying genre, usually referred to as different 'books'. Because the Bible is essentially an edited collection of translations based on a range of manuscripts (none of them the autograph), differ ent faith communities within Judaism and Christianity have in herited Bibles containing different books, and different versions of some of these books. Thus the idea of 'The Bible', though pervasive, is illusory: there are many Bibles, and each of these is a construction that has come about through, among other things, a process of social negotiation. Social negotiation is evident in the processes of translation and editing (for instance of the King 89 Β.

Social processes are of even greater significance in assigning the status of a sacred text to individual documents, and then collecting them together into a composite sacred text around which strict boundaries are drawn; that is, fixing a canon of Scripture. Historically, the rationale for inclusion of documents within the canon included psycho-social factors such as consen sus among early Christian communities on their acceptance, and widespread inclusion in liturgical practice. The more formal final closure of canons occurred in the Reformation and post-Reformation periods, when issues of social identity were 93 paramount. Social identity theory,94 which has been quite widely applied to some New Testament texts,95 examines one component of self-concept96—the collective identity provided by group affili ation. Social identity theory holds that the collective identity (and self-esteem) supported by group affiliation is both mediated and expressed by processes of ethnocentrism, in-group favourit ism, inter-group differentiation, and stereotyping of both in- and out-group members. These processes are particularly evident when the identity of a community is threatened. Within Christianity, one marker of group affiliation is the version of the sacred text that an individual adopts. The application of social identity theory to the historical analysis of the fixing of the various canons in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries is therefore likely to be fruitful. 91 A.

Little attention has been paid to this by psychologists of religion, but social dominance theory,97 with its notion of 'hierarchy-enhancing legitimizing myths', suggests itself as a promising analytical tool. According to this theory, the power of a legitimizing myth is related to the degree to which it is embedded in the group's culture, the degree of certainty with which it is stated, and the degree of current consen sus it evokes. Assigning sacred status to a bounded collection of texts ensures that it is treated not simply as an authority, but as the authority, and hence the unique source of material from which legitimizing myths can arise. Historically, the authoritative nature of a sacred text has been expressed in terms of concepts such as 'revealed', 'inspired', 'in fallible', 'inerrant', and 'normative',98 which indicate consensual beliefs about both the origin of the text and how it is to be received. However, more recently psychologists of religion, inter ested in how texts are actually used to support radicalization within faith communities, have drawn a distinction between readers who treat the core text as 'authoritative' and those who treat it as 'sacred', on the basis of the implicit principles guiding the process of reading and interpretation. Readers operating ac cording to the principle of 'intratextuality' find absolute truths to support and elaborate a particular world-view (itself supposedly arising originally from the text) that is applied to sources out side the text. Readers operating according to the principle of 'intertextuality' receive more tentative, provisional truths, which they check against other sources outside the text.99 Here there is a clear overlap between empirical psychology and her meneutic theory, and some have argued that these disciplines 97 Μ.

Reception of the Text (Examples) Cognitive dissonance. Perhaps the best-known application of psychology to the reception of sacred texts is the use of cognitive dissonance theory101 to understand the interpretation of unreal ized predictions, both within a text (e.g. 2 Pet. 3:3-4, 8-10) and in subsequent readings of the text.102 The theory of cognitive dissonance was highly influential in social psychology research in the 1970s and 1980s. However, it has largely been supplanted by another more comprehensive theory that originated about the same time—attribution theory.103 This is not so much because cognitive dissonance theory is false (its predictions have largely been confirmed empirically), but rather because it is a 'narrow band' theory that has extremely limited explanatory power,104 being essentially a succinct description of one small and decon textualized aspect of cognitive processing; indeed some have argued that it is not really a scientific theory at all.103 This may explain why cognitive dissonance was so readily taken up by some biblical scholars; it offers the advantages of a 100 Η.

Festinger, in A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1957), argues that the perception of an inconsistency among an individual's cognitions generates an aversive intrapersonal state (dissonance), which motivates the construction of a cognitive strategy to alleviate the discom fort. This process is said to underlie the psychological defence of rationalization. 102 C. D. Batson, 'Rational Processing or Rationalization?

Systematic biases in information processing. In contrast to cognitive dissonance, attribution theory continues to generate fruitful conceptual and empirical approaches in a wide range of areas of psychological enquiry. One of these areas is the relation ship between mood and explanatory style. For instance, there is now a large literature documenting an association between de pressed mood and a tendency to invoke global and internal causal explanations of negative events,106 and indicating that people who are depressed are more likely to attend to and notice negative information.107 These findings are of relevance to the reception of biblical texts, where strongly optimistic and affirmative statements occur side by side with pessimistic and judgemental statements (e.g. Rom. 3:23-4). The tendency to attend selectively to particular textual content, either because of disturbed mood or cultural predisposition, requires further study,108 and may yield helpful insights for those working with people whose mental health problems have a particular religious focus.109 106 ז3^יך when people who are depressed experience an adverse event they tend blame some stable attribute of their identity (Ί am a loser'), rather than temporary situational factors (Ί was in the wrong place at the wrong time').

Applying Psychology to the Text Itself: Exegesis Having explored some indicative possibilities of applying psychology to the production and reception of sacred texts, the use of psychology in approaching the text itself will now be considered. It will be argued that psychology can assist and enhance the process of establishing the meaning of texts. 'Meaning' here is understood as a broad but not unbounded concept; even if a given text might be received in an unlimited number of ways, it may still be said to have only a limited range of possible meanings.110 (The nature and legitimacy of various ways of receiving the text will be discussed in the next section.) It has been generally the case that the meaning of texts has been analysed and determined primarily by linguistic, semantic, and literary means, at the expense of other approaches, such as the mathematical or musical. This hegemony of verbal language as a means of understanding human signification has been attributed to the influence of poststructuralism,111 and it is a tendency that could be countered by a more comprehensive approach to signification that takes into account non-verbal logical and affective meanings.112 Here psychology has its part to play, because the account it can give of the multiple and flexible routes through which meaning is actually constructed by human beings might helpfully inform theoretical approaches to 'the meaning of a text'.113 Various types of meaning may be identified, each more amenable to some types of analysis than others. A sample of these will now be considered, each illustrated by the statement 'The sun is shining'. 110 Some scholars, for instance Barton, Reading the Old Testament, p. 178, have drawn a distinction between the 'meaning'(s) of the text and its 'significance' for the reader. 111 J. Shepherd and P. Wicke, Music and Cultural Theory (Cambridge: Polity Press 1997). 112 L. Weiskrantz, Thought without Language (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1988); J. Begbie, Theology, Music and Time (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), p. 107; J. Sloboda, Exploring the Musical Mind: Cognition, Emotion, Ability,Ability, Function (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004). 113 See e.g. V. Goel, 'Anatomy of Deductive Reasoning', Trends in Cognitive NeuroscienceNeuroscience 11 (2007), pp. 435-41. In this review article it is concluded that human beings make meaning through verbal, visuo-spatial, and motor processing deployed in highly flexible ways: 'Cognitive neuroscience data point away from a unitary system for logical reasoning and towards a fractionated system dynam ically reconfigured in response to specific task and environmental cues' (p. 435).</page><page sequence="33">33 PSYCHOLOGY AND THE BIBLE 1. 1. 1. Propositional Meaning This might be described as the 'plain meaning' of a statement. For instance, the propositional meaning of 'He breathed his last' (Luke 23:46) is 'he died'. It is determined through knowledge of the range of meanings for words or idiomatic phrases as they were used in the social and historical context in which the text was produced, and by the place in a wider text in which the statement occurs, and is in fact not always 'plain' and simple. For example it is possible to imagine a culture in which the propositional meaning of 'The sun is shining' might equally be meteorological or, idiomatically, political (for instance in the court of Louis XIV of France), and could therefore only be fully determined by its local context. 2.2. Entailed Meaning This covers a whole range of propositions that follow from the propositional meaning of a statement, because they are entailed in terms of logic or universally accepted rules about the natural world.114 If the propositional meaning of 'The sun is shining' is a description of the physical sun, the entailed meaning of the statement includes the fact it is daytime, not dark, the reference is to an outdoor setting, etc. For instance, an entailed meaning of 'But now, with no further place for me in these regions, I desire, as I have for many years, to come to you when I go to Spain' (Rom. 15:23-48) is '1 am at present not with you'. 3.3. Implied Meaning This is meaning that is carried by a statement, not due to universal rules of logic, but due to local cultural conditions of writer or audience. It relies on an assumptive ('if-then') world that is common to the author and the intended readers. The implied meaning of 'The sun is shining' in certain contexts may be 'So get up!' or 'So it is time to make hay'. Knowledge of certain assumptive worlds is an important tool in biblical exe gesis (though, like our knowledge of the use of words by the 114 Cognitive scientists have posited the existence of intuitive systems for understanding physics, biology, and psychology that allow human beings in all cultures to engage with the natural world effectively from a very early age. For example, all young children are thought to possess a 'naive physics', expressed in their expectation that solid objects move in continuous paths and do not pass through other solid objects, or that a single object cannot be in two places at the same time. See e.g. J. Barrett, ' Cognitive Constraints on Hindu Concepts of the Divine', Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion 37 (1998), pp. 608-19.</page><page sequence="34">JOANNA COLLICUTT 34 ancients, it is partial and provisional). It has been explored to good effect by Kenneth Bailey115 and others who have, for in stance, argued that the implied meaning of 'give me the share of the property that will belong to me' (Luke 15:12) is '1 wish you were dead'. One insight from psychology that is relevant here is the very specific and situational nature of some assumptive worlds,116 an insight that would indicate caution in making over-generalized statements about implied meaning. 4.4. Implicational Meaning In the last thirty years advances in cognitive neuroscience and cognitive psychology have established that human beings process information through the activity of a number of discrete cogni tive systems that interact with each other to produce a single integrated experience of being in and understanding the world. There are several highly complex accounts,117 but most posit two main cognitive systems underpinned by activity in separate pathways in the brain: a system that processes explicit propos itional meaning, and a system that processes tacit 'implicational' meaning. The 'implicational' system is distinguished by a lack of reliance on verbal aspects of communication, with a strong em phasis on affect and 'non-verbals' such as prosody,118 gesture, and facial expression. It generates high-level intuitive knowledge, often about significant evaluative aspects of social relationships, that is difficult to express in words, difficult to justify rationally, but highly compelling in quality. It is the mode of processing 115 Κ. Bailey, Poet and Peasant and through Peasant Eyes: A Literary-Cultural Approach Approach to the Parables in Luke (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 1983), p. 205. 1 6 Patterns of 'if-then' thinking may vary in the same individual according to the nature of the situation and the degree of emotional arousal she is experien cing. This is consistent with Carol Schersten La Hurd's findings, at variance with Bailey's account, when discussing Luke 15 with Arab Christian women (C. S. La Hurd, 'Re-viewing Luke 15 with Arab Christian Women', in A.-J. Levine and M. Bickenstaff (eds.), A Feminist Companion to Luke (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 2002), pp. 246-68. 117 See e.g. J. Teasdale and P. Barnard, Affect, Cognition and Change: Re-modelling Re-modelling Depressive Thought (Hove: Lawrence Erlbaum, 1993); S. Epstein and R.

Trope (eds.), Dual Process Theories in Social Psychology (New York: Guilford Press, 1999), pp. 462-82. 118 'Prosody' refers to aspects of spoken language include rhythm, intonation, and phrasing. See e.g. R. Mitchell, R. Elliott, M. Barry, A. Cruttenden, and P. Woodruff, 'The Neural Response to Emotional Prosody, as Revealed by Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging', Neuropsychologia 14 (2003), pp. 1410-21.</page><page sequence="35">35 PSYCHOLOGY AND THE BIBLE that is most naturally brought into play when engaging with poetry, and best expressed through poetry.119 The implicational meaning of a text incorporates its affective tone. (The affective tone of 'The sun is shining' is generally felt as positive, perhaps specifically happy.) Cultural distance may make the retrieval of the affective tone of a text difficult, or even impossible, rendering it effectively 'affectively unreadable'. But this does not indicate that the text lacks implicational mean ing. Some texts do seem to speak down the ages: part of the implicational meaning of Galatians seems to be '1 am furious', of Matthew's Gospel 'We hate you for rejecting us', of 2 Corinthians '1 am near to despair', of Song of Songs '1 want you', of the farewell discourses of the Fourth Gospel 'Parting is painful', and so on. Clearly a more sophisticated analysis is required here, and it is possible that a judicious combination of cognitive psychology with rhetorical criticism may advance things. Attention also needs to be given to symbols as carriers of im plicational meaning, for instance the implicational meaning of 'and the sea was no more' (Rev. 21:1) is surely something like 'we will be safe'. Here Jungian approaches (which stress the universal nature of certain psychic symbols or archetypes) come into their own; 'psychological exegesis' is in fact often taken to be synonymous with the interpretation of the implica tional meanings of symbols in the text through the lens of Jungian analytic psychology.120 In addition to the content of a text, implicational meaning also resides in its prosodic features. Here 'language veers towards the condition of music'.121 The creation narrative of Genesis 1 makes the rising and setting of the sun a temporal marker to separate the day from the night (Gen. 1:18). In this sort of con text the statement 'The sun is shining' could act like a refrain that carries the metre of a narrative that is arranged around periods of day and night. As in Genesis 1, with its sections of activity regulated by evening and morning breaks, so in music rests and pauses are important in the temporal shape of a piece, and have their own notation system. Here silence (or 'no-notes') has inherent significance, and may add to the significance of the 119 Implicational knowledge is well summed up in the rhyme '1 do not like thee, Dr Fell, the reason why I cannot tell, but this I know—and know full well—I do not like thee, Dr Fell.' 120 For a full discussion see Rollins, Soul and Psyche, p. 121 ff. 121 Begbie, Theology, Music and Time, p. 25.</page><page sequence="36">JOANNA COLLICUTT 36 adjacent notes or phrases. This may perhaps have been one of the functions of the term סלה that is found 71 times in the Psalms.122 The meaning conveyed by the pause (see also John 8:6, 11:6) can be the opening of a space, inviting patience, wait ing, or even 'sacred place' (1 Kgs. 19:12). 5. Intimated Meaning Intimated meaning relates to what is left unsaid but may be signified by allusion, perhaps explicitly, as 'let the reader under stand' (Matt. 24:15b), so that propositional processing is invited; or more often tacitly, so that implicational processing is invited. Intimated meaning is implied meaning arising within a coded form of communication, accessible only to those 'in the know'. An example is Luke's use of Isaiah 61 in the 'Nazareth mani festo' (Luke 4:18-19), where the quotation from Isa. 61:2 stops at the 'day of the Lord's favour', but could be argued to suggest 'and the day of vengeance of our God'. If this is the intimated meaning then the statement carries a tacit threat, so that its propositional meaning is positive, but its implicational meaning is negative; and if both meanings are identified the text may be experienced as dissonant (another musical concept). Feminist commentators in particular have drawn attention to the need to notice what is not said about women in making sense of the texts that relate to them.123 For instance, in her analysis of the parable of the lost coin, Susan Durber treats Luke 15:10 not as a simple parallel variant to Luke 15:7, but instead draws attention to the fact that it does not mention 'heaven', and concludes that it thus places the female in a subordinate position to the male.124 The meaning intimated by 'The sun is shining' would be de pendent on context. A specific intimated meaning in certain cir cles might be that the New Jerusalem has not yet arrived (Rev. 21:23). 122 Η.-J. Kraus, Psalms 1~5g: A Continental Commentary, trans. H. C. Oswald (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1987), p. 29. This is not, however, thought to be the main use of the term, whose meaning is obscure but which is most likely to indicate a doxology. 123 For instance, Elisabeth Schussler Fiorenza: 'biblical texts about women are like the tip of an iceberg, intimating what is submerged..Schussler Fiorenza, In In In Memory of Her: A Feminist Theological Reconstruction of Christian Origins (London: SCM Press, 1983), p. 32. 124 S.

Deep Meaning It was the psycholinguist Noam Chomsky who first drew a distinction between the surface and deep syntactical structure of language.125 While his theoretical approach has engendered much controversy, the distinction between 'deep' and 'surface' may prove useful in exploring the meanings of biblical texts. Chomsky's early theory identified deep syntactic structure as the basis for the logical meaning of an utterance, and postulated a generative process that transforms this deep structure into a surface structure which forms the basis of the utterance itself. Chomsky's theory thus separates meaning from surface syntactic structure and links it instead to deep syntactic structure. It gives an account of why utterances that appear grammatically very similar may mean something very different from each other, and why utterances that appear very different may mean the same thing. This would seem to be an important consideration in ap proaching biblical texts, because it offers some sort of legitimate rationale for attempting to identify semantic links between texts that have little in the way of surface similarity: links may be identified between texts on the basis of a relationship in their logical structures rather than by verbal correspondence. This is something that has been described by Erhard Gerstenberger as similarities in 'patterns of thought and ways of constructing real ity that go beyond linguistic connections'.126 Logical structure can be represented in terms of spatial rela tionships, for example in the context of Matt. 5:43-5 the indis criminate nature of the sun's shining on those who fall within its spatial scope speaks of God's universal care of human beings. Mary Douglas has used the analysis of spatial relationships to good effect in her approach to the purity laws of ancient Israel, noting similarities between the topography of the human body, the body of the nation, and the sacred space of the Temple (whose layout itself mirrors cosmic space). She posits a relation ship between the policing of boundaries, the maintenance of purity, and pollution fears in the domains of the human body, 125 Ν.

Her approach offers a helpful perspective on the meaning of Acts 10, where acceptance of potential sources of bodily pollution is explicitly linked with acceptance of a human being who is a potential source of pollu tion to the people of God (Acts 10:15, 28), a link that on the surface may appear arbitrary, but in fact seems to express a deep connection when viewed in spatial terms. Spatial imagery is used widely throughout the Bible, and the comparison of different texts on the basis of spatial (and indeed temporal) relationships may thus prove a fruitful means of expli eating meaning. For instance, while there is no obvious relation ship between the story of the prodigal son in Luke 15 and Paul's letter to the Romans, in terms of surface features such as literary genre or vocabulary, and no evidence of direct influence, there are a good number of logical and spatio-temporal relationship similarities. These arguably point to a common 'deep' meaning: the secondary questions that are raised by a radical notion of the grace of God.128 Analyses of this sort beg the question of what actually consti tutes 'similarity' beyond simple verbal correspondence. Here again concepts from music may offer a middle way between tight objectively demonstrated logical equivalence and loose sub jective impression. The notions of 'resonance' and 'harmony' capture well the relationship between some texts, as do the no tions of 'theme and variation'. Moreover, there may be some meanings that can only be articulated in musical terms. These meanings are likely to be dependent on complex temporal 127 See Μ. Douglas, Purity and Danger (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1966); Leviticus as Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999). More arguably, Douglas's approach may also support the making of connections be tween the Gospel accounts of Jesus' engagement with margin-violating health conditions (such as leprosy and gynaecological bleeding), his welcome of mar ginal Jews who were potential moral polluters, and the accounts of the mission to the Gentiles in the rest of the New Testament. 128 An account of profane gentile behaviour (Luke 15:11-16, and Rom. 1:21 5a); the minimal nature of the requirement of faith alone (Luke 16:17-20a and Rom. 3:27-8); salvation as covering and the seemingly premature timing ('e;ti...') of the saving act (Luke 15:20b and Rom. 4:7-8, 5:1-2, 6-8); moral behavioural change as a consequence of salvation, not a precondition for salvation (Luke 15:21-4 and Rom. 6:1-2, 13, 17-18, 8:2, 15); what advantage is there then in moral behaviour? (Luke 15:25—30 and Rom. 3:1, 7:7a, 11—14); does gracious action demean God? (Luke 15:31—2 and Rom. 1:1— 2a).</page><page sequence="39">39 PSYCHOLOGY AND THE BIBLE relationships in which multiple sounds (or voices) occupy the same space. For instance, experiencing musical 'delayed reso lution' may be an effective way of understanding the meaning of the tension between promise and fulfilment at several points in the New Testament.129 Here it may be helpful to explore meaning by approaching the New Testament as an orchestral score (with component texts arranged in parallel) rather than as a sequential chain of component texts. ך. Emergent Meaning In an essay that explores the retrojection of later understand ings of monotheism and divine omnipotence on to early texts such as Ezekiel, John Barton identifies a process that he likens to a 'feedback loop'. He argues that sometimes the lens through which later readers view a text may itself only have developed because of the existence and nature of the text in the first place; that is 'information generated by a system begins to scrutinize the system itself'.130 The process he describes, in which the seeds of meaning are present but not fully realized in the text, is central to philosophical theories of emergence.131 These the ories aim to give an account of how complex entities can develop naturally from the simple entities that form their constituents such that they exhibit properties not present in those simple entities, and yet still remain dependent on the existence of those simple entities, and act in conformity with them. Theories of emergence have developed as a means of address ing the old 'mind-body' problem, which in the contemporary context of cognitive neuroscience has been reframed as the 'mind-brain' problem.132 These theories treat consciousness as a highly complex 'emergent property' of the simpler physical brain cells and chemicals on which it is dependent. They give an account of the paradoxical observation that mental processes depend for their existence on the activity of brain cells, but that these mental processes can also reflect and act on those cells (for instance when an individual decides to give up smoking and ef fects a change in his brain chemistry). This action is described Begbie, Theology, Music and Time, pp. 98 ff. 129 130 J. Barton, 'The Messiah in Old Testament Theology', in J.

Models of emergence, which have arisen in the context of the study of brain-behaviour relationships, may prove useful in the quite different area of biblical exegesis and hermeneutics. They offer a way of depicting the multiple meanings identified in a given text by different communities or authors at various points within the Bible. They offer a framework within which unexpected later meanings may be seen not simply as violators of an 'original' meaning. Finally, because emergent entities must act in conformity with the entities from which they emerged, these theories offer some principles for distinguishing between a genuinely emergent meaning and a meaning that is imposed on the text in an attempt to assimilate it to an utterly foreign world-view. The use of emergence models in this area depends on the notion that 'meaning' can, at least in certain cases, be a multiva lent and dynamic quality. One way in which this has been explored is through 'double-aspect theory', which asserts that cer tain concepts have more than one inherent meaning. The most obvious example is light,134 and on this theory 'The sun is shin ing' may not simply be a phrase that can be usefully deployed as a metaphor, but may actually mean more than one thing: In talking about divine light, the religious person is perhaps not merely using a figure of speech, not projecting the connotations of a visual frame of reference onto the Godhead. Perhaps light was originally seen as a double-aspect reality that required a double-aspect term to refer to it, in which case the religious concept of light would not be an adventitious metaphor but would reflect an awareness of the double-aspect nature of light. 135 133 Ν.

Questions also arise about the legitimacy of certain identified meanings, and these will be considered in the next section. VII. Beyond Exegesis: Psychological Readings Reading is always done from a perspective and through an interpretative lens. Some, using the language of music (employed to explore meaning in the previous section), have spoken of interpretation of the Bible also as a performative process.136 A scholarly approach to a text is distinguished by the fact that its adoption of a particular perspective or performative stance is self-conscious self-conscious (as in certain sorts of advocacy readings). Each perspective or stance has an agenda or purpose. In general, the purpose of Christian theological readings is to build up the church, and to advance the enterprise of academic theology. Sometimes psychology is pressed into the service of this agenda, as has been the case with some theories of human memory referred to earlier. On the other hand, the purpose of psychological readings is to build up the academic discipline of psychology, often through analysis of the psychological function of a particular text. In the area of psychology of religion this may be, for example, through gaining an understanding of how the reception of certain texts contributes to the behaviour of a particular faith community.137 In the area of cognitive science of religion this may be, for example, through identifying examples of beliefs thought to be under pinned by universal, cognitive predispositions that have arisen through a process of natural selection.138 In the area of clinical psychology this may be, for example, through tracing therapeutic principles in the text, expressed in a way that adds power and sophistication to current understandings.1 9 In the area of analytic psychology this may be, for example, through drawing out new information on archetypes and symbols and other unconscious figurative speech; F.

In either case much is likely to be gained by a critical dialogue between the two readings. All readings of the text face questions of quality control. What constitutes a good reading? And on what basis might one reading be preferred to another? One major criterion is that the reading has been arrived at through a transparent methodical process that aspires to a degree of rigour. The use of a clear conceptual framework has already been mentioned, and emergence theory proposed as one such possible framework. However, there are many other methodological considerations that should be taken into account. In the area of postmodern psychology qualitative and discursive textual methods are mushrooming and are increas ingly being supported by specialist computer packages.141 The pressing need to establish criteria for the recognition of rigour in studies using these methods is acknowledged, and helpful guide lines have been proposed.142 Possibilities for applying these criteria in the evaluation of readings of sacred texts are discussed in detail in a separate publication by the present author.143 Methodological rigour is a necessary, but not sufficient, condi tion for a good reading. General hermeneutical considerations are also important. These include the usefulness and generativity of a reading, its ethical probity, its elegance, coherence, and complete ness, its validity in relation to other sources, its plausibility, and its persuasiveness. Each of these raises major questions (for example, whether some readings of texts should be ruled out on moral grounds, whether a good reading should be useful, ornamental, or neither), many of which are beyond the scope of the present essay. However, one of these will be explored in the next and final section. This is the question of the degree to which a sacred text might be expected to yield pleasing and coherent readings that 140 Rollins, Soul and Psyche. 141 See e.g. D.

VIII. The Traumatic Text: Where the Medium is also the Message Trauma is a complex phenomenon that involves both an extraordinary adverse event and the response of the person (or community) who has undergone or witnessed it. In the field of mental health care, a problem can only be attributed to trauma if the event in question involved 'actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity of self or others' and if the individual's response at the time involved 'intense fear, helplessness, or horror'.14 The emotion at the centre of trauma is fear. Fear is a basic and prototypical emotion that can be recognized across all human cultures, and also in many non-human species. It is elicited by conditions of perceived physical or social danger.147 It is characterized by a high degree of physiological arousal, an intensely aversive subjective state, and a behavioural tendency to freeze, flee, cling to others, or, if cornered, defend oneself. There are also distinctive cognitive aspects to fear; fear puts the individual on alert to dangers in the environment, moving her into a hyper-vigilant state.14 Because fear involves arousal and grabs attention, the individual who experiences a traumatic event is compelled to engage deeply with both the event and what it might signify. Twenty years ago the psychologist Ronnie Janoff-Bulman advanced the now well-accepted theory that traumatic events violently force 144 Κ.

These assumptions are typically of the sort: 'The world is benevolent'; 'The world is safe'; 'Life has meaning'; Ί/we can cope'; '1 am/we are of value'.149 The notion of the breaking in of an alternative reality clearly has a 'revelatory' dimension, and some psycholo gists of religion have made a theoretical link between trauma and the experience of awe,150 and also epiphanies.151 It is perhaps no accident then that many of the classic accounts of religious conversions include a major trauma.152 The alternative reality presented by the trauma (of a world that is dangerous, meaningless, and beyond current coping capacity) may be accepted by the individual, in which case she is likely to become depressed. On the other hand, she may try to avoid thinking about it, in which case she may be deeply troubled by anxiety, because the alternative reality will keep breaking in despite her best efforts, in the form of dreams and flashbacks. If she is instead to deal effectively with the trauma she will need to regain a sense of the world as safe (enough) and (largely) benevolent, of herself as being able to cope (with most things), and of life as meaningful (in a new way), all in the light of the traumatic event and its consequences.153 This process of 'coming to terms' is highly demanding of cognitive and emotional effort. A range of new potentially conflicting ways of seeing the world and the self need to be entertained, manipulated, and combined by the individual, and also by her loved ones, until a convincing and integrated account finally emerges. Perhaps the most common way in which such integrated accounts are expressed is in narratives: 'growth occurs when the 149 R.

The form and content of the stories may have much to say about this process. Here the connection with the Bible becomes clear, for the Bible is largely made up of stories of violent and frightening events. However, not all these events constitute trauma in Janoff-Bulman's terms, because they may confirm assumptions about the way the world is, rather than challenging or shattering them. For example, the events of Exodus 12-14 are violent and frightening, but they confirm that the LORD is in charge and cares for his people. On the other hand, the accounts of the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians in 587 bce (2 Kings 25; Jeremiah 52) conform well to current understandings of a traumatic event,158 and much of the literature produced in its aftermath can helpfully be understood as the expression of trauma-processing.159 Though less studied, the place of trauma is even more central in the New Testament. It can be argued that the organizing framework for the New Testament is that of the survival of trauma and growth in its aftermath. The central trauma is the arrest, trial, and execution of Jesus of Nazareth. Alongside this, colouring reactions to the aftermath of the central trauma, and 154 R. Tedeschi and L.

Several of the New Testament documents self-define as survivor witness-statements (e.g. Mark 15:47; Acts 1:48; 2 Pet. 1:16) and 'story-telling with a mission' (John 20:30-1). The psychological mode of these documents (whose literary genres are diverse) include elements of, or are sometimes dominated by, trauma-processing.160 They exhibit many of its features, in particular 'sense-making':161 the passion narratives describe vio lent acts with sufficient detail for them to be acknowledged and faced, but with a degree of detachment so that engagement will not overwhelm the reader or hearers with emotion; there are some explicit references to making sense of events only with hindsight (John 12:16); there are countless references to confusion on the part of the disciples and allusions to the challenges posed to their assumptive worlds by the suffering and death of their master, and their own less than adequate behaviour in the face of it; the passion and resurrection narratives describe behaviours that are fearful on the part of the disciples (freezing, flight, and defensive aggression, with approach-avoidance conflict on the part of Peter); there is a sense of bereavement in the farewell discourses of John's Gospel and reference to grief (λύπη and cognates) at several other points in the synoptic gospels (e.g. John 20:6, 20; Luke 22:25); there is a strong emphasis on paradox as a means of holding conflicting perspectives on events, especially evident in the writings of Paul, but by no means confined to these; there is a prototypical narrative account of a post-traumatic sense-making encounter on the road to Emmaus in Luke 24. As in the story of the restoration after the Babylonian exile, closure is incomplete (2 Pet. 3:4). Images and narratives of victory jostle for position alongside images and narratives of suffering on the part of both Christ and the early church. Negatives such as weakness and affliction are reframed as positive through connec tion with Christ's submission to handing over and death. Metaphors to make sense of suffering (childbirth, refining through fire, parental chastening) are woven together with reassuring explicit and allusive connections to the existing world-view of the 16 For a full discussion of all the points in this paragraph see J.

Because the sense-making is a 'work in progress' it gives to the text features of dissonance, bitter-sweetness, partial or delayed resolution. These can be experienced by the reader as disturbing, painful, or ugly. That is, not only can it be argued that the message of the New Testament is primarily a story of trauma, the form of delivery delivery also has the potential to irritate, to challenge, to disgust, or even to traumatize. Therefore defensive ways of receiving the text—ways that attenuate these features—may be invoked. Defensive readings may be literal, historical-critical, or liberal,165 and indeed 'psychological readings' may also function defensively. Defensive readings can work in multiple ways, for instance by inhibiting deep engagement, by fragmenting or smoothing the text into digestible form, or by assimilating the text into a more acceptable narrative. Thus, in evaluating readings of the Bible, one useful hermeneutic question, suggested by this psychological analysis, might simply be, 'Is this reading psychologically defen sive, and, if so, what might it be defending against?' Here, an understanding of the psychological mode of a text may draw attention to its implicational meaning, and support or inform the hermeneutic process. IX. Conclusion This essay has attempted to set out the multiple ways in which psychologies may be used in the study of the Bible to enhance understandings of the processes at work in the production and reception of texts, and also in making sense of the text itself. As there are numerous psychologies, and numerous ways in which these might be utilized, the consideration has of necessity been 162 Κ. Pargament, G. Magyar-Russell, and N.

As many of the ways in which psychologies may be used have been attempted in only a very limited sense, or not attempted at all, a certain amount of speculation is inevitable. But the speculative ideas presented are not wild; their aim is to stimulate further thought that might culminate in real research. It has been argued that psychology is fundamentally about people and how they actually behave—how they think and remember, make and conserve meaning, attempt to communicate, process and express emotion, and exist in relation to others. Any approach to the Bible that does not pay due attention to these human factors, doing them the respect of applying rigorous methods to their study, is likely to be impoverished.</page></plain_text>
