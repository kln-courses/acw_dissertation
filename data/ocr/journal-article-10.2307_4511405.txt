<plain_text><page sequence="1">Vol. XXXVIII Recent Literature 1967 [253 included in Taverner's list, convincingly repudiated (p. 34) by means of careful examination of a single puzzling specimen, thus eliminating the continuation for great lengths of time of an easily made mistake, the bane of compilations of this kind. Crosby's colored illustrations are eminently successful. His birds are posed freely in n-atural and pleasing surroundings, showing in flight or in repose often two or three plumage phases of usually, very good coloring. Particularly helpful is the placing of the autumn warblers together with birds in spring plumage and in groups of very similar species, thus giving the reader excellent opportunities of intra- as well as interspecific comparisons. Plate 60, for instance, shows remark- ably well detailed plumages of the Connecticut (Oporornis agilis) and the Mourn- ing warblers (0. phitladelphia). The work is astonishingly clear of typographical errors. An inadvertent anthropomorphism appears oln page 230, where it is stated that the male Ruby- throated Hummingbird (Archilochus colubris) does not take part in the "drudgery" of incubation and raising of the young. In the descriptionis of colors the habit of adding the qualifying ending "ish" (yellowish, whitish) is perhaps unnecessarily prevalent, and the presence and absence of hyphens (mixedwoods, mid-day, under parts) have me slightly puzzled. But the excellence of the work would scarcely be duly appreciated without negligible irregularities. Significantly, the book was consistently on the Canadian non-fiction best-seller list for at least three weeks after publication and still appears on it intermittently, testimonial enough not onily of its popular appeal but of its value as an attractive and scholarly work on the avifauna of Canada.-Louise de K. Lawrence. 44. A Life Time with the Birds. An Ornithological Logbook. Earle R. Greene. 1966. Edwards Bros., Inc., 2500 S. State St., Ann Arbor, Mich. 404 pp. $6. Earle Greene is a cordial, very friendly man who greatly enjoys birds and bird people. He has written a chatty, informal record of a life time largely concerned with these two subjects. Professionally he was Refuge Manager for the U. S. Biological Survey at Lake Mattamuskeet National Wildlife Refuge in North Carolina, at Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge in Georgia, and at the Great White Heron and Key West Refuges in Florida. His bibliography, mainly concerned with birds of the southeastern states, runs to eight pages. His "Life List" of over 600 species seen in North America north of the Mexican border fills 28 pages; with each species are listed the states or provinces in which the birds were seen. There are 110 photographs in the book, some excellent, others rather indistinct. The volume closes with an index of the names of birds and persons. It is interesting to read of the nesting of exotics, originally escapees from aviaries, two species in California, six in Florida. In "Parakeet Village" on Treas- ure Island, not far from St. Petersburg, hundreds of Budgerigars (Melopsittacus undulatus) have nested in freedom during the last five years. In a rookery of White Ibis (Eudocimus albus) Mr. Carter Bundy of Miami introduced a number of eggs of the Scarlet Ibis (E. ruber) from Venezuela with the consequence that some of these gorgeous birds are now nesting in the rookery. After "retirement" in 1956 Mr. Greene is an enthusiastic as ever, driving over the couLntry, avid to visit his many friends and to see new birds for his life list. Let me quote: "When the average person reaches three score and ten years of age, he decides to take it easy, enjoy the rocking chair on the front porch or sit in his patio, read or look at television, or perhaps sleep the time away. Not so with the student of birds or one who has a serious passion on some subject vital to him. This person keeps on until he is called to the Happy Hunting Ground." May this good fate be the author's!-Margaret M. Nice. 45. The Birds of Tikal. Frank B. Smithe. 1966. The Natural History Press, Garden City, N. Y. 350 pp. $7.50. I have bee'n asked to review this ex- cellent new field book chiefly because my husband and I spent six months in 1965- 66 exploring and observing birds through central British Honduras and Peten, Guatemala. We made no collections but did some mistnetting. Later we joined C. Russell Mason, Mrs. Margeret Hundley and Sr. Jorge Ibarra (an outstanding naturalist in the country) for four days of intensive birding at Tikal, followed by four days of observations mostly by dugout canoe along the Rio de la Pasion in southwest Peten. Still later, in 1967, at Santa Elena on the shore of Lake Peten,</page><page sequence="2">12 5 4] Recent Literature Bird-Banding July I have recently spent four more days at Tikal, this time using Smithe's book. Descriptions in the book are accurate, detailed, and include the color of the eyes, legs, feet and other fleshy parts, facts too often missing in previous reports. In almost every species, songs and calls are well described; in those few cases where the author has not himself heard the voice, he has combed the literature for the information. The book is well organized, giving a maximim amount of information on each of the 280-odd species covered and yet condensing it all into a small field-size book. Under each species name is listed the common English name (after Eisen- mann), the common Spanish name used in this area, the local Mayan dialect name (much of this material is from St. Jorge Ibarra), range, status here, length, and weight. A paragraph deals with abundance, habitat, and typical actions that aid in identification. The description of the species follows, with notes on food, voice, nest, and eggs. Lastly a short list of the most useful references for the species is given. This is far more information than one usually finds in a field book. The color illustrations by H. Wayne Trimm, 170 originals covering 107 species, are well chosen for content, both to afford comparisons of easily confused species and to provide illustrations for many of the species not previously depicted elsewhere. Plates 3-9 on falconiform birds are practically worth the price of the entire book. The Plumbeous Kite should have been included here, for it has been observed at Tikal and nearby. Plates 13 and 14 on the hummingbirds, Plate 22 on the Furnariidae and the Formicariidae, Plate 23 on the becards, Plates 25, 26 and 27 which cut across fam- ily lines in order to make comparisons among confusing, small, greenish birds, Plates 28 and 29 covering all the resident orioles and including the similarly marked Black-throated Shrike-Tanager, and Plate 31 differentiating among the four species of blue grosbeaks and buntings-these plates are all exceptionally helpftil to birders new to this area. The color on some species is poor: too much red on the male Red-throated Ant-Tanager; too much rufous on wing of the Gray- headed Dove; too red a brown on back and crown of the Buff-throated Foliage- gleaner; and the tail on the Scaly-throated Leafscraper should be black or blackish The Mealy Parrot in particular has poor head-bodv proportions. I question the advisability of emphasizing the white throat as a key field mark of the White- crowned Parrot, in this area at least. This is an exceedingly variable character for two birds seen at a distance of 25 feet showed nlo white on the throat at all and only a trace on the chin proper, and I have never seen one in this area which shows the amount of white appearing on Plate 11. Several other criticisms seem in order. The bibliography is carelessly coni- structed. The Birds of El Salvador by D. R. Dickey and A. J. van Rossem is listed only under "F" for Field Museum. A basic book for this area, A Fish and Wild- life Survey of Guatemala by George B. Saunders, Ancil D. Holloway, and Charles 0. Handley, Jr., is listed only under "W" for Wildlife. Some items are listed under the author's name, buit maniy authors are simply consigned to limbo. Collecting sites mentioned in the text and appendices are carefully pin- poinited on the end- cover maps, a great help in an area where place names are often old lumber or chicle camps now long forgotten. But Melchor de Mencos, one of the largest towns in Peten, is not shown at all. Ceibal, the site of the Harvard diggings and a favorite tourist attraction, is not shown. And excellent birding areas like Lago San Juan Acul and Lago Petex-batun in southwest Peten are omitted. One of the oil company's maps, easily available from any filling station in Guatemala City, should be used as a supplement. The Birds of Tikal is exactly what Mr. Smithe's title says it is, describing in detail each species known from the 13-mile-square Tikal National Park, which is probably onie of the best and most convenient birding spots in northern Central America. The park is limited ecologically-a quasi-rain-forest (Lundell's apt name) with no aquatic habitat except for a few small muddy ponds that are nearly dry in the dry season, and with no open areas except for the relatively recent clearings for the small airstrip. However, the jacket description reads, ". . . it is a complete handbook of the birds of the Peten. ... Indeed, in the absence of other books on the regioni, it will serve as a handbook to the birds of the lowlands of Central America." This last statement is patently absurd. Even if the list for Peten were complete (it is not), this guide does not encompass the large number of species fotund along the Carlbbean coast, in the dry lowland areas such as the</page><page sequence="3">Vol. XXXVIII Recent Literature 1967 [255 Motogua Valley, in the Pacific lowlands of northern Central America which have an almost totally different avifauna, nor in southern Central America. As to the Peten itself, the bird list of Tikal Park does not include all the species found in the extensive lake system in central Peten, in the large savanna areas south of La Libertad and towards Poptun, in the pinelands of southeast Peten, in the western foothills of the Mayan Mts., in the true rain-forest of south- ern Peten, or the many miles of riparian forest along the Rio de la Pasion, the Rio Usumacinta, the Rio de San Pedro, and the headwaters of the Rio Mopan and the Rio Sarstun. The appendices are most interesting. Temperature and rainfall records over a four-year period, while unusual in a field guide of this sort, add materially to the records Dr. Lundell lists from Paso Caballos and the official government records from Flores. Appendix D, drawings of the various types of pensile flycatcher nests, was obviously a labor of love and is fascinating. Appendix B gives the lists of species recorded by previous investigators. Mr. Smithe says these "bring the records of the Peten very close to completion," but this is not necessarily true because not enough collecting has been done and many areas of Peten have not yet been visited by professional ornithologists. Many species simply listed in Appendix B and not described in the text are common birds elsewhere in the Peten-the Mangrove Swallow, Plain-breasted Ground Dove, Blue-gray Tanager, Grey-crowned Yellowthroat, Vermilion Flycatcher, Fork- tailed Flycatcher, Common Tody-Flyeatcher, Grayish Saltator, Acorn Wood- pecker, Lesser Yellowlegs, Purple Gallinule, American Coot, and Muscovy Duck. We ourselves have also seen, and these species are not listed anywhere on any list in this book, Black-bellied Tree Duck, White-tailed Kite (a common bird throughout Central Peten in February and March), Least Bittern, American Bit- tern, Bonaparte Gull, Common Gallinule, Common Ground Dove, and Scarlet- rumped Tanager. The Jabiru Stork is well-known to the Indians and archeologists along the Rio de la Pasion. A number of additional species are common in British Honduras close to the Peten border, and since no one has collected anywhere in eastern Peten as yet, they may well be found to occur there. These species include Buff-throated Saltator, Striped Cuckoo, Yellow-headed Parrot, and, in the moun- tain edges, Black Phoebe and Horned Guan. As it stands this book is a "must" for any birder going to Tikal, and surely more people will discover what a superb spot it is. But for the birder going any- where else in the Peten or in Izabal, or to the adjoining areas of Mexico or British Honduras, Blake's Birds of Mexico and Eisenmann's The Species of Middle Amer- ican Birds are still essential. Mr. Smithe has done such an excellent job of describ- ing the birds he deals with that I personally hope he will now prepare a companion volume covering the rest of the birds of Peten.-Dora Weyer. NOTES AND NEWS Philip and Paul Robillard would be grateful for further data on the Eastern Phoebe (Sayornis phoebe), such as nest record cards, other nest studies, albinism, and in fact any life history aspect (address: 125 Burnett Road, Granby, Mass. 01033). Papers intended for presentation at NEBBA's 1967 annual meeting (Drunlin Farm, Lincoln, Mass., October 28) should be discussed with James Baird prior to September 1 (address: Mass. Audubon Society, So. Great Road, Lincoln, Mass. 01773). The 1968 spring field meeting of NEBBA is scheduled for June 8 at the Well- fleet Bay Wildlife Sanctuary on Cape Cod. Present plans are for a beach-buggy trip down Nauset Beach on the 8th, and tentatively a longer beach-buggy trip on Sunday the 9th, down Monomoy. Some migrant shorebirds should still be present. While mist nets sales have been very heavy this spring, NEBBA can still offer immediate shipment on all ten types, including "tethered" 30mm mesh (12 meters long). For details, write Mr. E. A. Bergstrom, 37 Old Brook Road, West Hartford, Conn. 06117.
