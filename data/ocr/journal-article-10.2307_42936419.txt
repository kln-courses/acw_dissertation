<plain_text><page sequence="1">VÄTA-VÄYU By J. R. Joshi In Vedic mythology and ritual, reference is always made to Vâyu or Vata, a minor divinity presiding over the phenomenon of wind. There is, however, difference of opinions among scholars regarding the connotations of the two appellations, Vayu and Vāta. It is pointed out that early thought does not distinguish between the blower and the blast, (cf. Manning : 1952, p. 83). Vâyu or Vāta, therefore, is the name of the wind-god ( cf. Mackenzie : 1912, p. 24). In other words, another name for Väyu in the Vedas is Vāta ( cf. Wilkins : 1882, p. 66 ). Thus, according to some scholars, these two terms are almost interchangeable ( cf. Apte : 1951, p. 376 ). Scholars like Macdonell ( 1963 : p. 81 ), on the other hand, find some sort of distinction between Vâyu and Vāta. It is stated, in this connection, that Vâyu is chiefly god and Vāta the element. It is also added that each of these names for wind expresses both the physical element and its divine personification, but Vâyu more com- monly refers to the god and Vāta to the element of wind. In the case of the wind-god, according to Hopkins ( 1902, p. 87 ) there is preserved a deity who was one of the primitive pantheon. " The later mythologists on Indian soil, " that scholar says, " make a dis- tinction between Vāta and Vãyu." Regarding the original nature of Vāta, it may be pointed out that one of the linguistic and mythological equations accepted by Max Mueller ( 1882, p. 216 ) is : Vāta and Wotan. Helm ( Altgerm. Rei. i. 260 f. ) regards Wodan as a wind and spirit-god. And Vāta, on the likely evidence of this Teutonic Wotan-Odhin, is probably prehistoric (cf. Bloomfield : 1908, p. 155). Vāta is connected with Lat. Ventus ( cf. Griswold : 1969, p. 286, n. 1 ). Vāta has been compared also to Vate, the father of the Teutonic Volund ; in old English the Milky Way was ' Watling Street '. The identification of the name Vāta with Wodan, however, is open to the most grave objection</page><page sequence="2">228 J. R. jfoshi on the score of form, nor is the parallelism in character of decisive importance ( cf. Keith : 1925, p. 140 ; also Schräder : 1909, p. 2 f. ) Vāta may be said to be direct deification of blast. It may be pointed out, in this connection, that, in the Veda, hymns are addressed to Vāta as a masculine, not as a neuter. " According to the Vedic method of personification, Vāta is just air at first, but soon develops into a symbol for the Divine " ( Bose : 1966, p. 99 ). The hygienic and vital aspects of wind were well known to the Vedic Indians. They knew that air is the condition of life and air in motion the condition of health. If there' were terrible activities of Vāta, in which he ' generated the Maruts from the wombs of heaven, that is, sent forth his brood of winds to accompany the thunder- storm, shattering trees and whirling up dust, there were also gracious and remedial activities (cf. Griswold : 1969, P. 289). In the Mr., ( X. 34 ) Vāta-, is traced to y/vā 'to go. ' In connection with the original nature of Vāta, however, Indo-Eur. root . y ¿-meaning c to blow ' and the Lett, word vējas meaning ' wind, ' may be noted. Various views are expressed regarding the original nature of Väyu also. According to Shamasastry ( 1942 : p. 213 ), Védic Vâyu is the moon. This identification, however, cannot be accepted in view of the development of Väyu in Vedic mythology and ritual. Wikander Stig ( 1941 )■, on the other hand, thinks that Väyu was not merely a god of wind, but also of ' breathing. 51 That scholar believes that originally Väyu played a -highly significant role as the cosmic breath with which one became united in ecstacy. It may be observed, however, that the concept of ' breathing ' may not be connected with Väyu in the original nature of that divinity. Similar observation may be made regarding the view of Aurobindo ( Gurukula Patrikā , XIX ( vi ), 320 ) who equates Väyu with the presiding divinity of life.. Hopkins ( 1902, p. 87 ), on the contrary, hits thè mark when he says, "Väyu (from the same root, as in German wehen ) represents the higher side of wind as a power lying back of phenomena. " That scholar adds that it is this conception alone that is utilized in the formation of the Vedic triad of wind, fire, and sun. Väyu represents the Grecian ^Eolous, who tied up all the winds in a bag ( cf. Reed : 1890, p. 51 ). It may be noted, in this connec- tion, that the natives of the Indonesian island of Flores call the power of the wind which blows from a certain direction the ' Lord ' of that</page><page sequence="3">Vã ta- Vāju 229 direction or quarter of the sky. Such personal lords of impersonal ' concepts ' or ' entities ' rule them, represent them and may dispose of them ( Gonda : 1963, p. 82). It is held that in the use and application of the two names, Vata and Väyu, there is an exact parallel to the double terminology employed to designate/ the sun as Surya and Savitr ( cf. Hopkirís : 1902, p. 87 ). More exact parallel, however, would be. found in Parjanya, a direct deification of the phenomenon of rains, and in Indra, a presiding divinity ( of course, not originally, ) of that, pheno- menon. Thus, " the real windgods of the RV are Vayu and Vätä, who differ, however, quite distinctly in character and importance." ( Keith : 1925, p. 139 )2. In rites, myths, and speculations relating to Väyu, we have clear traces of an old religion ( cf. Stig : 1941 ). In the Mir (X. 1 ), Väyu- is traced to vã or to vi ' to go. ' The word vãyu is formed by UņS I. i and Pāņ VII. iii. 33 : vã ■+• y + u . Vāta has only two short hymns in the RV ( X. 168, 186). Vata is associated with Parjanya, who in comparison with Indra is ' an elemental deity ' [ Keith ] and whose connection with thunder- storm is much more vivid than that of Indra. The different epi- thets belonging to Vāta are chiefly expressive of the physical attri- butes of swiftness and violence. Vāta is celebrated in a more concrete manner than Väyu. A good bit of profound human philosophy is contained in the mere fact that Vāta is described as a real person in language such as that of the RV X. 168 hymn, and that he may finally be invited to partake of oblations ( cf. Bloomfield : 1908, p. 155 ). Besides the gentle breeze, there are found to-day three types of wind in the Vedic area, wind accompanying dust-storms, wind that blows up. the monsoon, and wind that accompanies the rain- storm. And it may be that all are referred to in the hymn to Vāta ( cf. Griswold : 1969, p. 287 ). There is mention of the wind that whirls up the dust ; and it is suggested ( cf . Hopkins : ION, 47 ) that Vāta as ' the order-loving friend of waters ' may be the wind that ' brings the monsoön-clouds in due season. ' Vāta wafts healing and prolongs life, for in his house is the treasure of immortality (X. 186 ). It is from this point of view that Vāta is called the source of the world and the father of men, yea the very 'breath' ( ãtman ) of the gods (X. 186.4 ). Vāyu-Vāta would seem, accqrd- ingly, to be connected with the Hindu doctrine of the Prāņas or Vital</page><page sequence="4">230 J. R. Joshi breaths. " If then, " Griswold ( 1969 ; p. 289 fii 7 ) observes, " the Greek word for wind furnishes in the New Testament a name for the Holy Spirit, we need not wonder that the Vedic Indians also found in Vayu-Vata the symbol of the transcendent reality. " Vâyu is celebrated alone in one whole hymn, in parts of others, and in about half a dozen -hymns cojointly with Indra. Vâyu is the more anthropomorphized of the two gods, i. e., Vâyu and Vāta. The close connection of Indra and Vâyu is seen in the fact that Yäska ( X. vii. 5 ) gives Vâyu, or Indra, as the second member of the triad of gods, into which the Nairuktas reduced the Vedic pantheon. Vâyu is referred to in the Avesta ( XIX. 13 ) as ' the power- fill wind made by Mazda. ' As has been indicated above, Vāta is associated with Paijanya, whereas Vâyu is connected with Indra in his role as the presiding deity of rains. Thus Indra and Vâyu ride on the same car ( IV. 46.2, 48.2 ), a mythological expression for united function. This union of Indra and Vâyu explains why either of them may represent the deities of the atmosphere in the later Vedic triad. The first draught of Soma is Vâyu's share ( I. 134.1, 6; 135.1 ; IV. 46.1, etc.) "Is this a merely ritualistic detail, or the reflexion of the fact that the monsoon-wind regularly precedes the monsoon ?" ( Griswold : 1969, p. 288 ). If Vâyu becomes active before Indra, then he must have had the prior Soma- draught. The violence of both must have seemed to the Vedic Indians to indicate exhilaration with Soma. Vâyu's theophany is in terms of sound, not in terms of sight ( I. 164.44). Thus wind presents itself as a mysterious element. It may be recalled that both ' wind ' and ' Spirit ' translate the same Greek word « VEUHa. Reference may be made, in this context, to Basu ( Bleeker : 1964 p. 86 ), according to whom, Vâyu is the god of vital force. That scholar thinks that the vital force is the seat of all movements of desire and ambition in man as also of magnanimity, love and other expansions of consciousness of a similar kind. As has been pointed out above, Vâyu is even equated with the Master of the Life Ener- gies ( cf. Aurobindo : 1956, p. 351 ). As far as the mythology of the RV is concerned, however, such equations are not valid. As has been indicated above, Vāta and Vâyu, in their origin, have got some mythological connection with Parjanya and Indra, respectively. On this back-ground it is significant that in the A V</page><page sequence="5">Väta-Väyu 231 (VI. 93.3, III. 20.6) there are rks addressed to Väta-Parjanya and Indra-Väyu*. It may, moreover, be noted that in that Veda Vata and Vãyu do not form a dual divinity except with Parjanya and Indra respectively. The VS, on the other hand, makes two- fold reference to Vāta, being originally the direct deification of the phenomenon of wind. Thus an offering to Vāta is enjoined together with that to Dhūma, Abhra, Megha, etc ( XXII. 26 ) ; whereas, calling him a devatā, mention of Vāta is made in between Agni and Surya-Candramas ( XIV. 20 ) . Original mythological positions of Vāta, Vāyu and Parjanya are vividly shown in the following passage from the TS ( II. iv. 9 . 1 ) : " ' Stay, O Maruts, the speeding falcon, ' ( with these words ) he pushes back the west wind ( pascad vāta ) ; verily he produces the east wind ( purovãta ), to win the rains. He makes offering to the names of the wind ( vãtanãmãni ) ; the wind ( Vâyu ) rules the rain ; verily he has recourse to the wind ( Vãyu ) with its own share ; verily it makes Parjanya rain for him. " [ Tr : Keith ]. In the TV Vãyu is referred to more significantly than Vāta. The opening yajus of the VS, according to G. S. Sharma, speaks of the scientific fact that it is the sun who creates motion in the wind. This interpretation, however, seems to be doubtful as it is based on an artificial connection between two different ritualistic formulae. It may be noted that with the mantra, meaning, ' You are belonging to Vãyu, ' the Adhvaryu is enjoined to touch and address the calves. Griffith ( 1899.1 ), after having translated väyavah with 'breezes,' adds : " As the winds purify the ground, so do you with your dropp- ings which are used for smearing, and so cleansing, the floors of houses ; or, perhaps, meaning ' intruders, ' preventing the milking of the cows ; or, free to wander where you will, and then to return home. " This rendering, however, is difficult to be accepted. The expression väyavah in the passage concerned, may better be trans- lated with the phrase ' belonging to Vãyu ' For, the ' little ones ' of cows are often described as ' protected by Vãyu ' in Vedic mytho- logy and ritual (cf. Joshi : I A V). In ritualistic manner, the TV makes pointed reference to various details in the Vâyu-mythology put forth in the earlier two Samhitās. It is significant, for example that the somagrahaņa for Vãyu is followed by that for the dual divinity, Indra-Väyu ( VS VII. 7, 8). The FS (XXII. 6, XXIII. 17</page><page sequence="6">232 J. R. Joshi XXXIX. 1 ), which refers to the special oblations to Vâyu connects Agni, Vâyu and Sürya with Prthivī, Antariksa and Dyauh respec- tively. Accordingly, cranes ( that fly through midair ) are killed for Vâyu ( XXIV. 22 ). It is, however, difficult to understand why the sacrificial vessel being brought ( kriyamãna ) towards the ãhavaniya is sacred to Vâyu. In the TV Vâyu is referred to often as a purifier. That god removes off husks from the grains of rice ( FS1 I. 16 ). On the back- ground of Rgvedic connection between Vâyu and Soma referred to above, it may be noted that Soma while being purified ( püyamänah) is said to be connected with Väyu (FS VIII- 57). Soma, purified by Vâyu, with pavitra, is mentioned in the FS"4. The TSs, on the other hand, mentions the dual divinity Vâyosâvitra together with Mitrāvaruņa and Ašvins, as the saviours from sin ( āgomuc ). Vâyu is also invoked to remove defects, if any, and, accordingly, to make the body of sacrificial animal complete ( FS1 VII. 5.22). The Brãhmanas refer to the various traits of Vāta-Vāyu mytho- logy and, many times, develop them in their peculiar manner. It is, for instance, said : " When the east wind ( purovāta ) blows, they expect rains." It is added that just as one tries to milk the cow, but cannot get it, so is the case when the east wind blows but it does not rain !6 Further, on the background of the fact that Vâyu's theo- phany is in terms of sound ( RV 1. 164. 14), the equation of Vāta with Prāņa ( ŠBr I i 2. 14, V. ii. 4.9 ) may be noted. It is also said that the prāņa of an animal, while being killed, approaches ( apipa- dyate) Vāta ( ŠBr III. vii. 4.9). Elsewhere it is said that Speech is the consort of Vāta ( GBr II. 2.9 ). In this context it is interest- ing to read the following passage from the Tāņ-Br (VII. 9.11 ) : " One should sing the Vämadevya Sāman in the same manner in which Vāta blows on the surface of waters." Side by side, one may take into account the equation of Vāta with mind ( S Br V. i. 4.8). The terrible aspect of Vāta may be intended by another • equation according to which Vāta means the arrows thrown by the Rudras dwelling in the mid-air ( ŠBr IX. i. 1.36). Turning to the references to Vâyu as such, in the Brãhmanas, it may be noted that those texts not only refer to the mythological traits gathered around Vâyu, but, in a way, develop them further.</page><page sequence="7">Vsta-Vayu 233 Such points, all ready referred to in the Samkitãs, may be listed up as follows : Vâyu and Indra, Vâyu and Prāņa, Vâyu and Parjanya, Vâyu and Soma, Vayu and Antariksa, Vayu and Cattle, Vāyu and mind (or mind-like speed), Vâyu and purification or healing, etc. In the Brāhmaņas, moreover, some new traits are added to the earlier Väyu-mytholögy, such as : Vãyu and the Sun, Vâyu as the progenator, Vâyu who pervades, adbhutas related to Vâyu, and so on. It is significant that thè ŠBr (IV. i. 3.19) equates Vâyu with Indra. With the same significance the Brāhmaņa ( III. ix. 4.14) says that Indra pervades that much area as is occupied by Vâyu ! This close connection between Indra and Vâyu is peculiarly put forth in the VamsaBr ( VI ) according to which it was Vâyu who taught the Sãmaveda to Indra ! The Brāhmaņas (JUBr I. 29. i, IV. 22. ii ; ŠBr viii. 4. 1.8 ; KausBr viii. 4 ; ABr II. 26.3.2, TāņBr IV. 8.6, GBr II. 1.26, etc. ) often equate Vâyu with Prāņa also. However, expressions like 'Vâyu is clinged to my prāņa' ( TBr III 10.8.4) too are found. Regarding the physiological aspect of Vâyu, it is said. that Vâyu, after having entered into a human body becomes threefold : prāņa, udāna, and vyäna ( ŠBr III. 1 .2 .20 ). Following passage, however, occurs in the ChBr ( II. 4. 11. cf. Joshi : 1970, p. 516-56 ) : ' May I possess Prāņa in the form of Vâyu ! ' Further, it is also stated that Fire is the output of Vâyu only, for, it is said, Fire is the product of Prāņa and strength ! ( ABr VIII. 28). It is rather -difficult to explain Vāyu-Prāņa connection underlying this passage. It is, moreover, significant that the term ātman also seems to be used to establish such connection. For example, following sentence occurs in the ŠBr (IX. 1.2.38, XIV. 3.2.7) : 'Vâyu is indeed ātman of gods even ! ' On the background of this Prāņa-ātman concept, it may be pointed out that Vâyu is said to have received the Sãmaveda from the god of death ! ( VaňúaBr VI ) . The Brāhmaņas do refer to Vâyu who causes rains ( ŠBr I. 7.1.3), controls rains ( ŠBr I. 8.3. 12 ), grants rains ( TBr I. 7.1.1 ). These texts, however, seem to develop this trait further by connect- ing Vâyu with water, in general. Thus Vâyu is said to be the essence of waters ( S Br V. 1.2.7 ). Movement of Vâyu is never found to be strait way, and, accordingly, waters do not flow in a strait line ( ABr IV. 4.3) ! The direction of Vâyu is followed by rains</page><page sequence="8">234 J. R. Joshi (ŠBr VIII. 2.3.5), or, in other words, Vâyu is the direction of waters which flow here and there as Vayu moves here and there ! 7 Cutting a step further, the Tãn-Br mentions the ' couple ' of Vâyu ( m. ) and waters ( f. ) ! " When the waters desired for sexual intercourse, " it is said therein, " Vâyu made his course upon their back ( prsthe ), wherefrom ' vasu vārna ' was produced ! " ( VII. 8.1). It may be recalled that Vāta, blowing on the surface of waters is compared with the chanting of a soman. As has been pointed out above, Vâyu is closely connected with Parjanya, and also with the cows. In this light, following passage from the S Br (I. 7.1.3) may be read : ayam vai vãyur yo'yam pavata esa vã idam sarvam prapyãyayati yadidam kiñca var sátý esa vā etāsām ( gavãm ) prapyãyayitã / According to the Brāhmaņa (IV. 4.1.15) it is Vâyu who leads ihe cattle. Cattle once declared that Vâyu was the ruler ( JUBr I. 52.4). Vâyu acquired the overlordship in respect of cattle at forest ( TãnBr XXIII. 13.2). Taking into account that Pūsan is the pastoral god in the Veda ( cf. Dandekar : 1942, p. 49-66 ), one may note that a pair of the feet of Indra's āsandī is said to be made up of Pūsan and Vâyu. As has been pointed out above, calves are said to be protected by Vâyu. And the SBr ( XII. 4.1.11 ) equates Vâyu with a calf itself ! The Brāhmaņas often refer to Vâyu as related to Antariksa, of which he is the Lord or Superwiser ( TBr III. 2.1.3, 11.1.19, GBr I. 29, II. 4.9, ŠBr VIII. 3.2.1, JUBr 1.1.4). Mid-air is under control of Vâyu ( ABr II. 41 ). The ABr (V. 25) mentions the view of some teachers who maintain that Vâyu is the grhapati of the world of mid-air. In the same Brāhmaņa ( VIII. 27 ) purohita- purodhātr-connection is established between Vâyu and mid-air. Keeping with the sequence in the earlier mythology, moreover, the mention of Vâyu is preceded by that of the Fire and followed by that of Âditya ( Sun ) ( For example, JUBr IV. 4.1.1). " Vâyu produces Agni and, finally, absorbs him into his own existence ( ABr VIII. 28)." - This too may be the indirect reference to the ' higher ' position occupied by Vâyu in the Brāhmaņas. On the background of the connection between Vâyu and mind or cranes referred to in the Samhitãs, it is interesting to observe how, in the Brāhmaņas, Vâyu is described as the most speedy one. The ABr ( II. 4. 1 ) describes the race run by the gods in which Vâyu</page><page sequence="9">Vāta-Vāyu 235 stood first. And, therefore, he is the most speedy among all the gods ( TBr III. 8.7.1 ). The gods once told Vãyu : ' You are the most speedy among us. You should know Vrtra's whereabouts. If he is still alive, you should return immediately ! " ( ŠBr IV. 1.3.3). - This is the direction in which the Brāhmaņas have developed the concept of speed closely connected with Vayu. It is obvious that through the act of purification Vāyu is brought into connection with Soma. Vāyu is the purifier8 , the purification incarnate, or the strainer itself ( ŠBr I. 1.3.2, 7.1.12 ; TBr III. 3.5.11 ). It is also significant that Vãyu, after having entered into Soma, makes it palatable ( ŠBr IV. 1.3.7-10). Gutting a step further, it is said that Soma is Vãyu himself !9 ( ŠBr VII. 3.1.1). Reference is already made above to the triad made up of Agni, Vãyu and SOrya. And, according to ŠBr (V. 1.2.7), Sun is the starting point from which Vãyu moves forth. " This Vãyu, " therefore, " blows according to the seasons - cool in winter, hot in summer ! " ( J Br III. 333 ). With this observation, following pass- age from the ŠBr (X. 6.2.11) may be compared : agninã vãyuh ( dïpyate ) vãyunS dityah / The same Brāhmaņa, however, elsewhere ( VI. 1.2.3) describes how Prajāpati had coupled Vãyu with the mid-air and how the Sun was born from their union ! It is also said in that Brāhmaņa ( VIII. 7.3. 10 ) that the Sun weaves up these worlds with the thread, and that, that thread is Vãyu himself ! It may be noted, however, that the statements like : ' the form ( rūpa ) of Vãyu is taken away by the Sun' ( ŠBr XI. 8.3.8) are rather difficult to understand. Vâyu's help in acquiring progeny seems to be an innovation of the Brāhmaņas. In the context of expiation rites, for example, following passage occurs in the ŠBr ( XIII. 3.8.1) : " If the sacri- ficial horse were to couple with a mare, let him in addition prepare a milk oblation to Vãyu ; - Vãyu doubtless is the transformer of seeds." Moreover, on the basis of pavamãnah prajāpatih, a hemistich of a rk, Vãyu is identified with Prajāpati ( ABr IV. 4.4). Else- where he is also said to be a form ( tanu ) of Prajāpati ( ABr V. 4.6). And accordingly, all of the quarters are coupled with Vāyu. Menakā and Sahajanyã, the wives of Vãyu, stand for the heaven and the</page><page sequence="10">236 J. R. Joshi earth respectively. According to Māhitthi, however, they represent quarter and intermediate quarter ( S Br VIII. 6.1.17). The Brāhmaņas, naturally, refer to the various aspects of Vāyu as the attnospheric deity. Vāyu is so called because he joins up everything ( sarvam yute ) here ( J Br II. 56). It is Väyu only who bears up all ( sarvam ) this at a time, who carries offerings unto the gods, who does everything here ! (ABr' II. 34). The lightning, the rains, the sun, the moon as well as the Fire approach Väyu and thus disappear ( ABr VIII. 28 ). Origin and end of even the quar- ters is Väyu himself ( ŠBr X. 4.3.3 ). In other words, entire outer phenomenon has Väyu as its final resort ( JUBr III. 1.1.12). This atmospheric deity has to keep contact with all of the quarters ; otherwise, it is said, he would diminish himself ! And in this light, the phenomenon of storm is explained in the JUBr ( I. 1.2.5-6 ) as follows : A storm indicates that Väyu being afraid of death, runs fast in order to pervade everything here9 ! Väyu, therefore, is present even in the body of a man, who, being full of perspiration, exclaims : ' The Wind does not blow to-day ! ' ( JUBr III. 1 . 1 . 20 ) Oertel ( 1896, p. 238) compares this topic with a passage from the ŠBr (I. 1.3.2, V. 2.4.10) according to which 'Väyu enters man. ' In the JUBr ( IV. 8.1. 10-11 ) following passage has been put in the mouth of Väyu : " I am prāņa of gods and other beings. That which I leave, gets dissolved ( praplavate ). If I were not exist- ing, everything here would be destroyed ( parābhavet ), nothing would remain ! " Further, so as to emphasise the mythological antiquity of Vãyu, it is pointed out that at the time when Prajäpati observed penance for a thousand years, the movement of Väyu had reached the extremity ( atyapavata ) ( S Br X. 3.2.3 ). A passage from the TBr (II. 3.9.4-7), as it were, brings some important traits of Vâyu-mythology together. According, to that passage, Väyu, after having taken the form of Prāna, moves forth from the eastern direction so that one is happy to experience the eastern wind. The southern wind is called Mātarisvan which blows through all directions and, accordingly, fills up each and every cavity. The wind from the western direction is called Pavamāna&gt; the purifier. And Väyu produces the northern wind, after having taken the form of the Sun !</page><page sequence="11">Vata-Vâyu 237 Finally, the Brãhmanas relate the mahadbhïïtas to the god Vayu. In this context, following long passage occurs in the SadBr ( V. 8 . 1-3 ) : " The sacrificer turns to the intermediate space to sacrifice. Then, for whom vehement winds blow by whom monstrosities are seen in the clouds, if donkeys, camels, antelopes, herons, pigeons, owls, crows, vultures or jackals are seen ; if in the intermediate space there are rains of dust, pieces of meat, bones and blood, if couples of crows are seen, should he see a rainbow at night, if hares enter the village, trees sweat blood, a royal palace stands in the air - all the above portents connected with the god Vayu are to be expiated. Having sacrificed a dish of rice boiled in milk while reciting the verse ' The wind must blow a medicine to us ' ( RV X. 186. 1 ) he makes an oblation with ghee while uttering the five mantras ' To Vayu hail, ' ' Hail to the Lord c f the Mahadbhūtas ', ' Hail t&lt;? him whose hands are swift, ' ' Hail to the Lord, ' ' Hail for the appeasement of all evil ' and having sacrificed for the less or more while uttering the mystical names of the seven worlds, then he must sing the sāman " ( SV I, 184 ). As to the animals, referred to here, Kohlbrugge ( 1938. p. 126 ) says that Weber ( Phil. p. 330 ) is wrong in his interpretation that donkeys etc. should not appear in one's house, and that, in fact, clouds in the shape of these animals are meant. This is indeed more probable because of the preceding words, (cf. Bollée : p. 110). That trees sweating blood are appeased occurs only here according to Kohlbrugge ( 1938., p. 91 ). Regarding the references to Vāta as well as Vāyu, the Äranyakas are equally important. For example, in the context of addressing to the sacrificial animal, a formula is uttered which means : ' Your prāņa to Vāta ! ' (TĀ III. 4.1 ). According to the commentator, Vâyu is the prāņa of an animal ! Side by side, it may be noted that in the Äranyakas, the word Vāta occurs aiso in plural. Thus seven Vātas are said to be the movers of rains. These seven Vātas are : Varāhavah, Svatapasah, Vidyunmahasah, Dhüpayah, Sväpayah, and Grhamedhāh. (TĀ I. 9.5). The commentator justifies these names by pointing out their special significance connected with rain, heat, motion, scent, splendour, etc. It is significant, however, that each one of these Vātas denote a direct deification of some kind of breezes. For example, Varāhu Vāta is the representa- tive deification of the varāhavah winds which produce heavy rains ( varam srestham var sam ãhvayati / ).</page><page sequence="12">238 J • Ä- Joshi The TĀ (I. 9.1-2 ) refers to Väyu together with his eleven male and eleven female assistants. The names of the male ones are as follows : Prabhrājamānāh, Vyavadätäh, Vāsukivaidhutāh&gt; Rajatāh, Parusāh, Šyāmāh, Kapilāh, Atilohitāh, Ūrdhvāh, Avapatantāb. and Vaidyutäh. These names, in the words of the commentator, indicate the purusa-gaņas of Väyu. The names of the female assistants of Väyu are coined by modification of the names of male ones. These names are obviously connected with the con- cepts of colour, motion, etc. It is added in the Äranyaka that one who knows these names is safe from lightning. In the AĀ (II. 1.7), on the other hand, the concept of punya gandha is associated with Väyu. Similar concept is that of multiplication. This concept is implied in the expressions like : " May I be multiplied like Väyu ! " ( AĀ V. 1.1). The commentator, in this context, refers to the multiplied winds which blow before the rainy season. The TĀ (IV. 8.2. - V. 7.7), moreover, refers significantly to Väyu as the presiding deity of calf. This reference, of course, confirms a peculiar trait in Väyu-mythology. Similar trait confirmed in the Äranyaka literature is the atmospheric nature of Väyu. Thus out of the five great unions ( mahãsamhitãs ) adhiloka union is centred around Väyu ( TĀ VII. 3.1). In the said sathhitã, earth is said to be the lower form, heaven the upper form, sky the unity and Väyu the unifier ( sandhānam ) . With this, we turn to the Upanisads, in which the name Vāta is connected only with Prāņa. There Vāta is equated with Prāņa ( Br-Up I. i. 1 ) as is also found in the earlier mythology. It is also said that Prāņa gets himself merged into Väyu (Br Up I. 2.13). Regarding the name Väyu, however, the Upanisads are more ela- borate. Though Väyu also is generally identified with Prāņa ( cf. Maìtri-Up VI. 33, BrUp III. i. 5, MuņUp II. 1.4), some more details are added. For instance, following passage from the A-Up ( I. 4 ) may be noted : " The nostrils of the premordial person were separated out ; from the nostrils, Prāņa ; from Prāņa, Väyu. " According to the Kaus-Up (II. 12 ), Prāņa of the Brahman, in absence of fire, sun, moon and lightning, goes to Väyu. This concept is entirely based on the ^4i?r-passage, quoted above, where also Väyu is the ultimate in the regression of five phenomena, though in reverse order. In the Upanisadic passage, moreover, the brilliance of the</page><page sequence="13">Väta-Väyu 239 Brahman, in absence of the lightning, is said to go to Väyu ; whereas in the Brāhmaņic one, it is said to go to dišas, ' the regions of heaven, ' which ( the latter ), according to Hume ( 1934, p. 316, fn. 4 ) is less appropriate. It is significant that the Upanisads refer to the two different fields of Prāņa and Vayu. Vayu, among the gods, and Prāņa, among the vital breaths, are said to be the two snatchers-unto- themselves ( sathvargau ) ( ChUp IV. 3.4). "As Prāņa holds the central position among the vital breaths (or functions), so Vāyu among these divinities." ( BrUp I. 5.22). Such as in the case of Prāņa- Vāyu concept, the Upanisads are confirmatory for many other traits of Vāyu-mythology. Take, for instance, the concept of original parallel positions of Vāyu and Indra. The Upanisads ( for instance, KathUp VI. 3, BrUp VI. 4.22 ) often refer to those two deities side by side. It is also significant that the adhi-daivata clue words ( which summarize the subsequent conversation) for Vāyu are 'Indra Vaikuņtha ' ( Kaus Up IV. 2). The Upanisads speak also about the close connection between Vāyu and Antariksa. This concept is put forth either directly ( cf. ChUp II. 24.9, IV. 17. i ; BrUp II. 3.2-3 ) or indirectly ( i. e. by mention- ing Väyu in between Agni and Âditya ) (cf. ChUp II. 21.1, TUp I. 7.1, Maitrī Up IV. 5. ) It may be recalled that calf is pecu- liarly associated with Väyu in Vedic mythology. In this light follow- ing passage from the Ch-Up (III. 15.2) may be read : "I here know this Väyu thus as the child ( vatsa ) of the quarters of heaven. Let me not mourn for a son. " Side by side one may note that a husband, at the time of sexual intercourse with his wife, is enjoined to recite a formula which means : " As of the points ( dišām ) Väyu is germ ( garbhah ) even so a germ I place in you." ( cf. Br-Up VI. 4.22). Keeping with the atmospheric nature of Väyu, developed in the Äranyakas, the Upanisads also discuss the position of Väyu in the context of the adhidaivata. ( cf. KausUp II. 12 ). Referring to Agni, Äditya, Gandramas and Vidyut, it is said that all these divinities, verily, having entered into Väyu, perish not when they die in Väyu ; therefrom indeed they come forth again. According to the Br-Up (I. 5.22), Väyu holds the central position among these divinities ; for the other divinities have their decline, but not Väyu. Väyu, according to that Upanisad, is such a divinity which</page><page sequence="14">240 J. R. Joshi never goes to rest. Further, it may be recalled that Väyu is the sandhãna and Ākāsa the sandhi, according to the TĀ. It should be noted, however, that the yfra/yaA:a-passage concerned, is also option- ally called as the Šiksā- or Sāmhitika-Upanisad. On this back-ground, it may be pointed out that, also in the principal Upanisads, Vayu and Ākāsa ( or kha ) are closely associated in the role of two mahã- bhūtas. (cf. AUp V. 3, MuņUp II. 1.3, PrašUp VI. 4, ChUp III. 13.5, VI. 10.5, 23.2 ; VII. 2.1, 4.2 ; BrUp IV. 4.5, VI. 2.16 ; TUp II. 1 . 1, etc. ) The Br-Up ( III. 13 ) refers passingly to Väyu as the purifier and the carrier of fragrance. The Kauš-Up (I. 3 ), on the other hand, mentions the significant concept of the world of Väyu ( vãyuloka ). - Let us turn to the Šrauta texts in view of further development • of Vāta and Väyu. Purificatory aspect of Vāta is often emphasised directly or indirectly through ritualistic details. Thus in the context of sacrificial uncovering of the grain-container, the sacrificer is enjoined to utter the formula uru vãtãya, and to gaze at the grains with uru vãtãya bhava ( cf. Dandekar : 1958, p. 270-71 ). Further, it is interest- ing to note that, in the TĀ 10 Vāta is called Adhvaryu, whereas, according to the Sadhotr formula he is Abhigara ! 11 Such impor- tance of Vāta in ritual seems to have been indicated by some signi- ficant passages. For instance : " ' What indeed is the beginning of a sacrifice, and what the end ? ' ' It is said in the Brāhmaņa 18 : svãhã yajñam manasā svāhā dyāvāprthivibhyām svāho' rorantariksāt svāhā yajñam vātāt ārabhe / Therefore, Vāta, verily, is the beginning of a sacrifice, and Vāta the end'." ( ŠK 945). And the samistayajus oblation, which indicates the conclusion of a sacrifice, is to be offered with the formula, devā gãtuvido . . vāte dhāh svāhā 13 Another formula : . pancānām tvā vātānām . . occurs in the context of sacrificial acceptance of butter. The Vātas mentioned therein, comprise of those belong- ing to the four quarters and Visvagvāta. ( ŠK 305 ). On the other hand, in the context of the Kārīrisli, a sacrifice to be made for grains, reference is made to the eight Vātas. In that rite eight 'vātanāman- oblations are made with the recitation of eight mantras beginning with purovāto var sam jinva rāvrt svāhā / ( ŠK 568 ) . Also in the con- text of funeral ceremony the word vāta occurs in plural. In that rite, kinsmen of the dead are enjoined to go round the pyre thrice, fanning with hems of their garments with the recitation of vātās te</page><page sequence="15">Vâta-Vâyu 241 vãntu pathi punyagandhã manahsubhã gātrasubhā'nulomāk tvacahsubhā māmsasukhčt sthisaukhyãh. . . / ( Bau Pitr - ŠK 1041 ). In this passage, the plurality of vāta indicates nothing but breezes. In view of the development of the concept of vāta, it may be noted that the Šrņutasātras refer to the vãtas ( breezes ) as well as to Vāta or Vatas ( deity or deities ). The presiding divinity of wind, Väyu, appears together with his old associations also in the Šrauta literature. Vayu's connections with the Sun,14 Prāņa15 and Antariksa16 are just passingly referred to. However, his peculiar association with animals in general and with cows or calves in particular seems to have been referred to in details . If after having been formally dedicated, the animal has run away or there has occurred any deficiency in it, the performer is enjoined to pour out grains for the gruel to Vayu ( ŠK 863 ) or to Niyutvat Vāyu ( AV-Prāy - ŠK 863 ). It is significant that the epithet niyutvat meaning one who fastens, is ascribed to Vāyu. It is equally significant in this context that the offering of gruel is to be followed by the pašupurodāša. Further, the performer is enjoined to assign the animal, which has run away, to Vãyu with vãyo esa te pašuh17 A white goat is prescribed to be sacrificed for Väyu. ( ŠK 877. cf. Joshi : 1970, p. 505-15 ). Cows and calves, however, are more closely connec- ted with that divinity. Following ritualistic belief, for example, occurs in the context of Agnihotra ( ŠK 156 ) offerings : "If the milk to be offered becomes impure after the calf has been brought forth to the cows, such milk belongs to Väyu. The oblation of it should be made for Väyu. " Moreover, if the calves suck the cows to be milked for the sannãyya, the sacrificer is enjoined to offer, in the evening, gruel to Vāyu. (ŠK 444). It is significant that, in this context, the Bau-ŠS quotes from the TBr ( III. 7 . 1.4-5 ) as an autho- rity, as follows : " ' . . If he does not milk them, a part of the sacrifice will disappear. ( Therefore ) he should pour out ( paddy for ) gruel to Väyu '. So says the Brāhmaņa . " Likewise, if the calves suck &lt;the cows at the morning-milking, the sacrificer is enjoined to offer gruel to Väyu after the offering of the evening milk ( ŠK 453 ). It is more interesting to observe that in the sacrifice to be offered for food ( Annam ), the sacrificer is enjoined to offer cows to Dyäväpr- thivī and a calf to Väyu !18 These parallel concepts of cow-Dyāvā- prthivī and calf- Väyu are peculiarly developed in the Šrautasūtras. B ... 16</page><page sequence="16">242 J. R. Joski For example, following passages may be studied from this point of view : " If one is expelled from his kingdom for a long time, a paryãrini cow to Dyâvâprthivï and a calf to Vãyu should be offered. " ( ŠK 887 ). " If a râjanya goes against his subjects, a cow should be offered to Dyâvâprthivï, and, next day, a gayal should be offered to Vayu. " ( ŠK 892 ). Taking into consideration the identification of cow with Idā ( cf. fn. 18 ), moreover, a passage occurring in the rite of Iļlā'pāhvāna carries much significance. When the hotr begins invoking the idã, the sacrificer is enjoined to look at him and, meditat- ing upon Vâyu, murmur the formula, vãyuh idãyã vatsah sã me vãyunã vatsena šraddhām tapah svargalokam dhuksva / (ŠK 375 ) . According to another Sãtra ( ŠK 378 ), he should look at the hotr with vãyav' i4ā te mãtã j and meditate upon Vãyu. Reference has already been made above to the purificatory aspect of Vāta as expressed in the Šrauta texts. In many contexts, however, this aspect is expressed more emphatically. Even the strainers are said to be purified by Vãyu himself ! ( ŠK 254 ) . There- fore, ceremonial cleansing of the strainers is accompanied by the mantra : . . väyupüte sthah . . / ( ŠK 255 ). Similarly, if an oblation becomes fluid, the sacrificer is enjoined to offer on the âhavanîya fire an oblation of a spoonful of clarified butter with the formula vãyave svāhā / ( ŠK 462 ). It is equally significant that in the Pavi- tresti ( a sacrifice for purification ), clarified butter is offered to Niyutvat Vãyu. ( ŠK 595 ) . Moreover, some rites occurring in the context of the preparation for the Agnihotra offerings are important from this point of view. The sacrificer is enjoined to shake up the grains in the winnowing basket with : vãyur vo vivinaktu / ( ŠK 274 ) . With vãyur vã isa ürje vivinaktu , he winnows the grains ( ŠK 282 ) . It is interesting that the purificatory aspect of Vãyu seems to have been developed in the concept of tigma-tejas in the context of the preliminaries of the Agnihotra. The sacrificer is enjoined to rub a darbha blade over the edge of the wooden sword from the bottom to the top with . . vãyur asi tigmatejãh, and thus sharpen the sword. ( ŠK 294 ). And this concept of tigmatejas corresponds with that of the removal of evil in the following passage : " If one touches the sacrificial post, the evil in the sacrifice will attach itself to him. Therefore, he should recite over it - vâyav'esa te vãyo /" It may be mentioned in this context that in the sacrifice to be offered if one</page><page sequence="17">Vsta-Väyu 243 is being accused ( Abhišasyamdnah ), a gayal is offered to Vâyu ! {ŠK885). Generally speaking, in the Šrauta ritual, a sort of high rank seems to be attached to Vayu. This may be observed even in the procedure adopted for the offerings to that deity. For instance, here is a passage describing the samistayajus referred to above : " The adhvaryu should then stand up within the altar and, with the formula, devā gātuvida . . , offer to Vayu by means of the dhruvā on the āhava- nîya the samistayajus oblation. "20 The injunctions regarding the meditation upon this deity also are significant from this point of view.81 Moreover, often the offerings to Vâyu are made in the upāmšu manner, and the mantras or formulae related to him are recited in a low tone ! ( ŠK 595, 763, 895 ). On the background of the ritual-mythological connection between Vâyu and animals in general, it may be specially pointed out that the animal-offering to Vâyu is characterised by the mantras recited in a low tone ( ŠK 877 ). In Šrauta ritual, like other deities, Vâyu has got some special relations regarding rites, epithets, favours or boons. For example, the third tirtha-way ( i. e., that between the cātvāla and the âhavaníya) belongs to Vâyu ( ŠK 967 ) . It seems, he is prayed to for ratnas, for, the offerings unto him are followed with the mantra : vãyor aham devayajyayã ratnabhãg bhüyäsam / ( ŠK 759, 954). It is interesting, moreover, that an offering is made to Āgomuc Vâyu in the Mrgāresti, a sacrifice against the malignant pulmonary disease, ( ŠK 616-17 ). [ It may be recalled that Āgomuc Vâyu occurs also in the TV. ] Further, a stoka is related to Vâyu in the following passage from the topic of animal sacrifice : "A piece of darbha-blade is cast away upon the nearest embers of the ãhavaniya with vāyo vīhi stokānām, for the sake of the omentum being heated upon that darbha-blade. " ( ŠK 819). Finally in the Bau-Pitr ( ŠK 1089), Vâyu, together with other deities, is significantly referred to in the context of re- cremation of the bones of the deceased, as follows : " One, whose bones are re-cremated in this manner, as also one who, indeed, knows this ritual of re-cremation - towards him Vâyu blows . . ; he is not cut away from the proximity with Vâyu ..." Turning to the Grhyasütras, some old associations of Vāta may be recalled. In the sadhotr ( VaikhG - ŠK 1059 ) formula, for example,</page><page sequence="18">244 J. R. Joshì his close connection with Prāņa is implied ; whereas earlier mytho- logy connected with Vata and water is expressed symbolically in the Āg-G (I. 5.2) thus : isiro visvavyacã vãto gandharvas tasySpo psaraso mudã noma / On the background of these exceptional references, however, it seems that the divine character of Vata was being obscured during the Grhyasûtra period. For example, in the following hemi- stich, which is addressed to the pregnant wife, no divine nature is attached to Vāta : yathSyam vātah pavatē yathã samudra ejati22. Simi- larly, in the context of the injunctions regarding the improper atmo- sphere for the study of the lore, the terms ativãta ( GobhG III. 3.28 ) and šarkarākarsin-vāta ( ŠānG I. 13 ) occur which have nothing to do with Vāta as a divinity. Undoubtedly, Vāta as an element is referred to in the expressions like vãtasya bhrājam 23 or pašcādvāta 24 often found in the Grhyasütras. Väyu, however, appears in the Grkya- texts, accompanied by his usual divine associations. For instance, the ceremonial rid- ing on a chariot is accompanied by the mantra , meaning : " I ride on you with the viry a of Väyu and with the ojas and ãdhipatya of Indra " ( ĀgG II. 6.3 ). It is interesting that the concept of vlrya, originally connected with Indra, is attached to Väyu here ! Is this due to the constant ritual-mythological association between the two deities ? Further, it may be recalled that the evil in an animal-sacrifice, is supposed to be removed away by Väyu. And, in the marriage- ceremony, a bridegroom is enjoined to pray to that divinity only to remove away the pasughni tanūh of the bride ( JaiG I. 22 ). Further, in the HirG ,25 the performer is enjoined to offer an oblation for the all-pervading Väyu, the overlord of those who belong to the mid-air. It is, moreover, quite significant that, in the marriage ceremony a bridegroom is enjoined to pray to Väyu in order to remove off the ill-spoken aspect of the bride !26 Thus Väyu's old associations are developed in the Grhyasütras in their peculiar manner. As has been pointed out above, divine character of Väyu is quite preserved in the Grhya literature. In that literature too, offerings to Väyu are often mentioned together with the formula : vãyave svāhā / ( VaikhG- ŠK 1058, HirG II. 16-4, ŠānG I. 26. 13, ĀgG II. 6.4 ). Väyu is said to be one of the deities known as the Karmasãdgunya Devatās ( ĀšGr Par II. 2 ) as well as one of the Loka-pālas who protect the sacrifice (Ibid II. 7 ). In the Bhār-G (I. 14), however, there is a peculiar</page><page sequence="19">Vata-VSyu 245 formula, meaning, " May Vãyu protect your thighs ( ïïrïï ) . " Though it is difficult to justify the connection underlying this mantra, some suggestions in that direction may be put forth. Firstly, on the back- ground of the equation of Vata with Vayu, the Šrauta formula uru vãtãya may be recalled. It may be that in the Šrauta mantra, originally, there was ūrū and not uru. For, the Šrauta mantras are often found to be corrupted ( cf. Dandekar : 1958, Intro. ). Secondly, in the Ayurvedic literature, which was coming up during the period, the term vãta was being connected with muscles, and accordingly, with the thighs. Due to this influence, the Grhyasütras, after hav- ing misunderstood the Šrauta word vãtãya, possibly, changed the Šrauta uru into ūrā ! Similar is the connection between Vāyu and S vãti, a constellation under which a sacrifice to Vāyu is offered ( ŠānG I. 26. 13). It may be conjectured, in this connection, that on the verbal similarity between Vãta and Svāti, those two might have been juxtaposed. And, later on, Vãta was easily replaced by Vãyu on the mythological grounds. In the Grhyasütras, however, some curious associations of Vãyu do occur, though occasionally. In the Drah-G ( III. 1.19), for example, the performer is enjoined to look at the hot water while meditating upon Vãyu. Similarly, the Äg-G (II. 6.1) connects the fore-finger with that deity ! In the context of the daily Deva- yajña, moreover, the performer is enjoined to offer a bali in the vãstugrha ( a room in the house ), with the recitation of the formula} meaning, ' To Vayu ! ' [It may be that the vãstugrha was specially intended to be airy. ] There are two important Grhya passages which indicate the development of Vãyu at the close of Vedic mythology and ritual. Firstly, a passage occurring in the context of the ceremonial Brãh- maņa-bhojana may be quoted : " While the Brahmins eat, the host speaks over them the verse, ' What by me is bestowed against or with my will, on an imperfect Brahmin or on a non-Brahmin, what food drops into terrific Nirrti, by which our Fathers and the deities are gladdened - may Vãyu purify all that. ' " ( JaiG II. 1 ). Such a concept of purification attached to Vãyu, of course, indicates the development of the character of that deity in view of ritualists. Secondly, the Āš-Gr-Pari. (II. 7 ) describes the anthropomorphic Vãyu in the following invocation : " I invoke Vãyu, seated on a</page><page sequence="20">246 J. R. Joshi deer who is running, holding a flag in one hand and granting the boon with the other. I invoke Vayu of dark-blue colour, having a golden rod and being seated on a black deer. I invoke Vayu who is the prāņa of the world and the lover of Mohín! !"27 It may be observed that some of the foregoing details are evolved gradually from the mythological traits found in the Samhitās onwards.
