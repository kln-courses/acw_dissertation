AWABDY mark.awabdy@asburyseminary.edu Asbury Theological Seminary, Wilmore, KY 40390 You must not present to Yhwh anything with testicles that are bruised, crushed, torn, or cut off. You must not do this in your own land, nor shall you present from the hand of a foreigner any of these for offering as the food of your God; for their corruption is in them, they have a defect. They will not be acceptable for you. (Lev 22:24-25) Say to the rebellious house of Israel, "This is what the sovereign Yhwh says: ,Enough of all your abominations, O house of Israel, when you brought foreign ers uncircumcised in heart and flesh to be in my sanctuary to profane it, my house, when you offered my food, the fat and the blood, and you1 broke my covenant, along with all your abominations. You have not kept charge of my holy things, but have assigned (others/foreigners) to keep charge of my sanctuary for you.' This is what the sovereign Yhwh says, 'No foreigner who is uncircumcised in heart and flesh out of every foreigner who is among the Israelites may enter into my sanctuary.'"(Ezek 44:6-9) The "foreigner" in the Hebrew Bible (classification noun בן־נבר and substan tive adjective נכרי) is enigmatic. From what land and ethnic origin does a given foreigner come? This question is rarely answered explicitly by the term's biblical contexts. Adding to its elusiveness, this class of persons is portrayed differently in I am grateful for the insight and encouragement from draft readers Yitzhak Berger, John Oswalt, Lawson Stone, and the Eastern Great Lakes Biblical Society. 1 The MT "and they broke my covenant" (3 ;!יפרוrd masc. pi.) is the lectio difficilior, but these foreigners were probably never in covenant with Yhwh, and so could not have broken it (the MT might have confused 1]י] and ת[*]). The LXX, Syriac, and Latin versions read "andyou broke my covenant, along with all your abominations" (11תפר), which maintains the second person plu ral harangue against the house of Israel (w. 6-8). 685</page><page sequence="2">686 Journal of Biblical Literature 131, no. 4 (2012) various sociohistorical settings by different biblical texts. Among the postexilic images, Ezekiel and possibly Jeremiah portray foreigners as temple defilers (Ezek 44:7-9; Jer 51:51).2 Ezra and Nehemiah fear that a foreigner's presence will disband the community's heritage (Ezra 10; Neh 9:12; 13). By contrast, in Isa 56:1-8 Yhwh grants covenant-keeping foreigners cultic prerogatives in the Jerusalem temple.3 The inclusive foreigner ideology in Isaiah 56 both reflects the language of Torah and moves qualitatively beyond it.4 While Isaiah 56 expands abiding Torah traditions to include foreigners in Jerusalem temple worship,5 Ezek 44:6-9 expands abiding Torah traditions, albeit alternate ones, to exclude foreigners from Jerusalem temple service. It is not my intention to explain the disparity between Isaiah and Ezekiel and their respective sociohistorical settings.6 Instead I consider how, in Ezek 44:7 2 Shawn W. Flynn, "'A House of Prayer for All Peoples': The Unique Place of the Foreigner in the Temple Theology of Trito-Isaiah," Theoforum 37 (2006): 17. Flynn fails to mention that Jer 51:51 is a questionable example of postexilic foreigner exclusion, since the term used there is "strangers" (זרים), probably in Jeremiah a social class distinct from "foreigners" (בני־נכר). 3 Ibid., 5-24. 4 Roy D. Wells, Jr. ("'Isaiah' as an Exponent of Torah: Isaiah 56.1-8," in New Visions of Isa iahiah [ed. Roy F. Melugin and Marvin A. Sweeney; JSOTSup 214; Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1996], 140-55) has demonstrated that Isa 56:1-8 reflects Torah language, but I would add that it also reshapes Torah by incorporating בני־נכר (or נכרים) "foreigners," which Torah never did. At the joyful cultic gatherings of Deut 16:8-17 and 26:1-15 גרים ("nonindigenous residents") are present (בני־נכר/נכרים are not present), while in Isa 56:7 בני־נכר are summoned to rejoice while praying and sacrificing in the temple. The Torah's injunctions to "keep the Sabbath" (e.g., Exod 31:12-17; Lev 26:34-35, 42-46; Deut 5:14) include גרים but omit בני הנכר (or נכרים). Contrar ily, Isa 56:2,4, and 6 repeat the injunction for בני הנכר to "keep the Sabbath," underscoring that "[t]he hallowing power of Sabbath observance breaks down proposed limitations of the wor shipping community on mount Zion" (ibid., 152). Finally, in Lev 20:22-26 Yhwh's people are to make clean-unclean distinctions because Yhwh separated his people from foreign nations (cf. unclean foreigners in Deut 14:21). Isaiah 56:3,6 appears to reflect Leviticus's clean-unclean sep aration (see ibid., 147); but now formerly precluded foreigners (בני הנכר ) may join themselves to Yhwh (הנלוים על־יהוה) without fear of being separated from Yhwh's people (. . . אל״יאמר 56:3 :הבדל יבדילני). 5 John N. Oswalt ("The Nations in Isaiah: Friend or Foe; Servant or Partner" BBR 16 [2006]: 50-51) has argued that Isaiah 56-66 is framed by 56:1-7 and 66:18-24, orienting readers to view "the statements about submission of the nations to Zion (not only in chs. 60-62 but also in 45:14 17 and 49:22-26) as partial and not final. God wants the nations to come into his house (56:7) to worship him (66:23)." 6 Isaiah 56:1-8(9) not only comforts ostracized members in the postexilic worshiping com munity, such as foreigners and eunuchs, but also indicts Jewish leaders for failing to shepherd these outcast worshipers; see Raymond de Hoop, "The Interpretation of Isa 56:1-9: Comfort or Criticism?" JBL 127 (2008): 671-95. Ezekiel 44:6-9 harangues Israel, and presumably non Zadokite Levites in particular, for shirking its priestly responsibilities by installing foreigners as substitute priests or guards in the temple (w. 7-8). Were these foreigners the people of Baal of Peor (Numbers 25) or temple slaves, called Nethinim (Ezra 7:24)? Or, as Calum Carmichael proposes (Illuminating Leviticus: A Study of Its Laws and Institutions in the Light of Biblical Narratives</page><page sequence="3">Awabdy:Awabdy: Yhwh Exegetes Torah 687 9, Yhwh reuses and develops Torah terminology and ideology to formulate new legislation for the restored temple community. Specifically, I propose that Ezek 44:7-9 functions as an inner-biblical exege sis of Lev 22:25. Yhwh infuses the prestigious language of Leviticus with ideology from the broader Torah corpus as an authoritative backing for a new law that barred foreigners from entering the sanctuary. The tradition history and social setting of Ezekiel 40-48 are complex,7 but the composition as we encounter it presents Ezekiel the seer s culminating vision of the new temple in cosmogonie imagery (of creation and its ordering).8 As a distinct character in this visionary narrative, Yhwh deliv ers the tirade and priestly prescriptions of Ezek 44:6-31 to Ezekiel for the house of Israel. Yhwh's speech includes both explicit and nuanced exegetical transforma tions of (his own) antecedent Torah legislation. In this article I explore the inter textuality of Lev 22:25 and other Torah language in Ezek 44:7-9 by defining my use of terms, providing indicators for the direction of literary influence, and sur veying preliminary issues related to the use of Lev 22:25 in Ezek 44:7-9. Then I examine this occurrence of inner-biblical exegesis and conclude with a survey of its rhetorical and theological implications. I. Defining Terms and Discerning Direction of Influence Early inner-biblical exegesis entails traditum, or the content of the tradition, and traditio, the subsequent transmission or representation of the traditum.9 These [Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2006], 101-3), were they David and Ahimelech at the Nob sanctuary ( 1 Samuel 20-22)? These options are unlikely due to discrepancies with Ezekiel 44. Some connect the foreigners of Ezek 44:7 with the Gibeonites whom Joshua made "woodcutters and water carriers for the assembly and for the altar of Yhwh" (Josh 9:27). This view is implau sible since Yhwh disapproved of the foreigners' temple presence in Ezek 44:7 but apparently endorsed Joshua's decision (see Josh 10:1-15, where Yhwh supports the Israelite-Gibeonite vie tory over the Amorites). Iain M. Duguid (Ezekiel and the Leaders of Israel [VTSup 56; Leiden: Brill, 1994], 76) believes that Ezek 44:6-9 "referred to the well attested practice of employing for eign Temple guards," as in 2 Kgs 11:14-19. Daniel I. Block (The Book of Ezekiel, vol. 2, Chapters 25-4825-48 [NICOT; Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1998], 622) elucidates this view rather convincingly: "The last hypothesis finds support in v. 11 in Ezekiel's appointment of the Levites as 'armed guards' (pëquddôt)(pëquddôt) to replace these foreigners. While guard duty could also be outside the gate, in v. 7 the prophet complains that these foreigners were brought right into the sanctuary." 7 See Michael Konkel, Architektonik des Heiligen: Studien zurzweiten Templevision Ezechiels (Ez(Ez 40-48) (BBB 129; Berlin: Philo, 2001), 8-22; Steven Shawn Tuell, The Law of the Temple in Ezekiel Ezekiel 40-48 (HSM 49; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1992), 5-17. 8 Susan Niditch, "Ezekiel 40-48 in a Visionary Context," CBQ 48 (1986): 208-24. 9 Nahum M.

Quellentexte) will refer to an essen tiallytially fixed "source text" that the Kontingenttext ("contingent text") has reapplied, transformed, reinforced, or overturned for a new sociohistorical setting. Since both a Kontingenttext and its Quellentext are preserved in the Bible, the Kontingenttext remains, to varying degrees, prestigious and authoritative.11 Ezekiel 44:7-9 is a Kontingenttext,Kontingenttext, and Lev 22:25, its Quellentext. Here we must distinguish between aggadic and legal exegesis, both of which prevailed in rabbinic exegesis but had prototypes by the exilic period:12 Inner-biblical legal exegesis is singularly concerned with the reinterpretation (or extension or reapplication) of pre-existing legal texts. By contrast, aggadic exe gesis utilizes pre-existing legal materials, but it also makes broad and detailed use of moral dicta, official or popular theologoumena, themes, motifs, and historical facts.13 Ezekiel 44:7-9 is aggadic in that it assumes and utilizes preexisting legal material, namely, Lev 22:25 and conceptions from the broader Torah, but it also extends that material into new and unanticipated realms. Yhwh in Ezek 44:7-9 does not merely cite Lev 22:25 as a precedential law, but utilizes this law's terms to express a more developed foreigner ideology, rooted in other Torah Quellentexte. On these grounds, which we will explore further, Yhwh implicates the rebellious house of Israel (v. 6) for installing foreigners as temple priests (v. 7), likely as temple guards (v. 8),14 and bars foreigners from his sacred precincts (v. 9). Analyzing inner-biblical exegesis requires one to present persuasive arguments for the direction of literary influence from one text to another. There are several duced inner-biblical exegesis to biblical research. Douglas A. Knight (Rediscovering the Traditions of Israel:of Israel: The Development of the Traditio-Historical Research of the Old Testament, with Special Consideration Consideration of Scandinavian Contributions [SBLDS 9; Missoula, MT: Scholars Press, 1975], 5 20) introduced traditio and traditum to the field, and Michael Fishbane (Biblical Interpretation in Ancient Israel Ancient Israel [Oxford: Clarendon, 1985]) fruitfully developed Knights foundations. 10 See Brevard S. Childs, review of Michael Fishbane, Biblical Interpretation in Ancient Israel, JBLJBL 106 (1987): 511-13. 11 Fishbane (Biblical Interpretation, 417) notes this phenomenon for the traditio and tradi turn.turn. 12 Here Fishbane's use of the term "aggadic" does not need modification since it is not a conceptual anachronism (even if a nominal anachronism) but aligns nicely with "proto Midrashic" exegesis that began to emerge in the exile and after; Childs (review of Fishbane, 512 13) appears to concede this point. 13 Fishbane, Biblical Interpretation, 283 (emphasis added). 14 See n. 6 above.</page><page sequence="5">Awabdy:Awabdy: Yhwh Exegetes Torah 689 indicators that one text is primary (Quellentext), and the other secondary and deriv ative (Kontingenttext). Three indicators are relevant to our discussion, each of which will reappear in the article.15 (1) Shared content may not have been fully integrated into the Kontingenttext such that elements from the original context appear to be incompatible, or not the obvious choice of language, for the new context. (2) The Quellentext Quellentext may provide the conceptual framework for the Kontingenttext so that the reader cannot understand the Kontingenttext without first reading the Quel lentext.lentext. (3) The Kontingenttext may include expansions, not attested in earlier writ ings, that are interpretations of the Quellentext. II. Preliminary Issues for the Use of Leviticus 22:25 in Ezekiel 44:7-9 The direction of influence in most instances arguably moves from H, centrally Leviticus 17-26[27], to Ezekiel. Nineteenth-century scholars began arguing that H was dependent on Ezekiel, the so-called "the father of Judaism" (Carl Heinrich Cornill and others).16 Before the century ended, scholars argued conversely that Ezekiel knew and used an earlier form of H that was nearly identical to its canon ical form.17 Recently Michael A. Lyons has reduced the likelihood of arguments 15 These are derived from Michael A. Lyons (From Law to Prophecy : Ezekiel's Use of the Holi nessness Code [Library of Hebrew Bible/Old Testament Studies 507; New York/London: T&amp;T Clark, 2009], 61). Two articles on inner-biblical allusion that are insightful for identifying the direction of literary dependence are Yitzhak Berger, "Ruth and Inner-Biblical Allusion: The Case of 1 Samuel 25," JBL 128 (2009): 253-72; and Jeffery M. Leonard, "Identifying Inner-Biblical Allusions: Psalm 78 as a Test Case," JBL 127 (2008): 241-65. 16 Julius Wellhausen (Prolegomena to the History of Israel [1885; Scholars Press Reprints and Translations; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1994], 121-27) argued that Ezekiel used Deuteronomy (D) but not H (or P for that matter), because Ezekiel and H have conflicting conceptions of the Levites and the priesthood. Wellhausen fails to recognize the possibility that Ezekiel preserved and, in places, contextualized H for a new setting. Karl Heinrich Graf (Die geschichtlichen Bûcher des AltenAlten Testaments [Leipzig: Weigel, 1866], 81-83) contended that Ezekiel authored H, but this explains only the similarities, not the differences. Other early writers identified portions of Ezekiel that antedate H and portions that postdate H. This is plausible in theory, but their assumptions about direction of influence were often ungrounded methodologically. 17 August Klostermann ("Ezekiel und das Heiligkeitsgesetz," in idem, Der Pentateuch: BeitràgeBeitràge zu seinem Verstandnis und seiner Entstehungsgeschichte [Leipzig: Deichert, 1893], 368 418), followed by S. R. Driver (An Introduction to the Literature of the Old Testament [1891; repr., New York: Meridian, 1956], 138-48), believed that Ezekiel utilized portions of a form of H nearly identical to H as found in the canon. This remains a strong possibility, and so does Louis Horst's view (Leviticus XVII-XXVI und Hezekiel: Ein Beitrag zur Pentateuchkritik [Colmar: Eugen Barth, 1881]) that Ezekiel collected and edited H. Although Walther Zimmerli dates the final form of H (and the P Document) later than Ezekiel, and Ezekiel at times influenced H (e.g., Leviticus 26), "it cannot be denied that Ezekiel has been influenced by detailed material built into H, or which</page><page sequence="6">690 Journal of Biblical Literature 131, no. 4 (2012) that deny H s availability to Ezekiel and has discredited methods used to argue that H borrowed from Ezekiel.18 Menahem Elaran, who likewise contends that P (which he says in Ezekiel is indistinguishable linguistically from H) antedates Ezekiel, identifies contradictions between P and Ezekiel, especially regarding animal sacrifices and grain offerings.19 He argues that Ezekiel's loose terminological connections with P suggest that his priestly scribal training took place well before his Babylonian captivity but that the reason for the major discrepancies is that Ezekiel did not have access to P scrolls at the river Chebar.20 Haran's theory is an intriguing alternative, but he never sue cessfully eliminates the possibility that Ezekiel reshaped P material that he had either memorized or consulted tangibly. Lyons's analysis and conclusion that Ezekiel reworked H are more convincing for reasons that I delineate in this article. Finally, Risa Levitt Kohn has argued cogently that Ezekiel knew and used both Priestly and non-Priestly Torah traditions without distinguishing between them.21 One should not be surprised, therefore, that Ezek 44:7-9 evinces cognizance of the Lev 22:25 Quellentext along with a more evolved Torah conceptually. Of particular interest for this study is that Ezekiel is shaped by Leviticus imagery,22 and Ezekiel 44 is saturated with Leviticus legislation that Yhwh has repeated, abridged, or expanded.23 This "dense cluster" of parallel lexemes in already underlies it" (Ezekiel: A Commentary on the Book of the Prophet Ezekiel, vol. 1 [trans. Ronald E. Clements; Hermeneia; Philadelphia: Fortress, 1979], 52), he also argues that Ezekiel used H in a form closely resembling H in today's text ("Die Eigenart der prophetischen Rede des Ezekiel: Ein Beitragzum Problem an Hand von Ez. 14 l-ll" ZAW 66 [1954]: 1-26). Israel Knohl (Sanctuary(Sanctuary of Silence: The Priestly Torah and the Holiness School [Minneapolis: Fortress, 1995]) hypothesizes that the Holiness School (HS), which had Leviticus 17-26/27 at its core, emerged in the eighth century b.c.e. to compensate for the Priestly schools inadequacies. By Knohl's recon struction H was available to Ezekiel in a form resembling H's final edition. 18 Lyons, Law to Prophecy, 1-46. 19 Haran, "The Law-Code of Ezek xl-xlviii and Its Relation to the Priesly School," HUCA 50 (1979): 59-71. 2020 Menahem Haran, "Ezekiel, P, and the Priestly School," VT (2008): 211-18. 21 Kohn, A New Heart and a New Soul: Ezekiel, the Exile and the Torah (JSOTSup 358; Lon don: Sheffield Academic Press, 2002), 85. 2222 For instance, compare the curses that Yhwh commands Ezekiel to pronounce against Jerusalem's mountains (ch. 6) with the curses that Yhwh commands Moses to enumerate to the Israelites at Mount Sinai (Lev 25:1; 26:14-43, esp. w. 30-39). For other connections, consult Marvin A. Sweeney (Form and Intertextuality in Prophetic and Apocalyptic Literature [FAT 45; Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2005], 127,140, etc.). 23 H. McKeating ("Ezekiel the 'Prophet Like Moses '?"/SOT 61 [1994]: 97-109) argues con vincingly that the majority of parallels between Ezekiel and Moses in the Pentateuch are general and thematic (see his n. 50). In chs. 40-48, he asserts that the legal materials, including those in ch. 44, were added to the narrative core of Ezekiel's third vision (40:1-37,47-49; 41:l-15a; 42:15 20; 43:1-11[12]; 44:1-3; 47:1-12). These legal materials contain enough discrepancies with pen tateuchal language that Ezekiel's elaborators, working later in the exile (R. E. Clements), "did not draw on a form of the Pentateuch familiar to us, but were working with material that the Penta</page><page sequence="7">Awabdy: Yhwh Exegetes TorahAwabdy: Yhwh Exegetes Torah 691 Ezekiel 44 and Leviticus, which I footnote here, suggests a genetic relationship.24 As for the direction of this relationship, I refer readers to Lyons's intertextual analyses of Ezekiel 44's reuse of H.25 Most significantly, because Yhwh in Ezekiel 44 repeatedly reworks certain texts, chiefly Leviticus laws, the probability increases for us to find additional bor rowed material, and we do.26 Ezekiel 44:7 and Lev 22:25 share three lexemes. Iain Duguid suggests reading Ezek 44:7 in relation to the legislative background of Num 18:3, but Steven Tuell has shown such a reading to be unsatisfying since the two texts express different assumptions about Levites and the priesthood.27 Instead, Ezek 44:7-9 reflects the language of Lev 22:25, as Michael Konkel observes: teuchal editors eventually shaped and developed quite differently" (pp. 108-9). The weakness of McKeating's claim is that he provides no specific data to show that the discrepancies imply that Ezekiel's elaborators used pentateuchal legal traditions that were substantively different from their final form. He presents this unsubstantiated claim as the only option, when in fact Lyons (Law to Prophecy,Prophecy, 47-75) persuasively presents a number of ways in which Ezekiel 44 altered H in par ticular, using a form basically the same as its canonical form, to accomplish certain communica tive purposes (see n. 25 below). 24 Berger ("Ruth and Inner-Biblical Allusion," 254) asserts that "an especially dense cluster of similarities might prove decisive even where each of them, taken individually, could otherwise have been seen as coincidental: the larger the number of moderately suggestive parallels, the more compelling they become when considered together." To begin, the garments of Zadok's sons, the endorsed altar priests, were to be made of linen (Ezek 44:17), as prescribed in Lev 6:10; 16:4 (cf. Exod 39:27-29). Ezekiel 44:17 adds the qualifying, general prohibition, "but wool must not be on them while they are ministering in the gates of the inner court and the house." The Zadokite priests were to wear linen turbans and linen undergarments (Ezek 44:18); both coverings were pre scribed for priests in Leviticus (6:10; 16:4). Exodus 28:42 explains that the linen undergarments were "to cover their nakedness," extending from the hips to the thighs. Ezekiel 44:18c augments these prescriptions with the prohibition, "they shall not gird themselves with [anything which causes] sweat," likely explaining the purpose of linen turbans and undergarments. In Lev 21:25 and Ezek 44:20, priests were not to shave their heads. Leviticus instructs further "nor shave the cor ner of their beard, nor make any gashes in their flesh" (cf. Deut 14:1-2), and Ezek 44:20 adds its own qualifying prohibitions, "nor let their hair grow long; they must trim their heads." Leviticus 10:9a prohibits Aaron's sons from "wine and strong drink," and Ezek 44:21 reduces this to "no priest" (not all Aaron's sons were endorsed, only Zadokite Levites) and employs the synecdoche "wine" (see Num 6:3 "wine and strong drink" and the obvious synecdoche "wine" in Num 6:20). In Leviticus priests may not marry one profaned by harlotry or divorced (21:7), and the priest "highest among his brothers" may not marry a widow (21:14). Ezekiel 44:22 conflates and con textualizes these standards. Ezekiel 44:25 reuses the warning of corpse defilement in Lev 21:1-3 (also Lev 21:11). Finally, Lev 10:10-11 commands priests to distinguish the holy from the profane, clean from unclean, and to teach Israel "all the statutes Yhwh had spoken through Moses." Ezekiel 44:23 conflates these: "They shall teach my people the difference between the holy...." 25 Lyons, Law to Prophecy, 64, 69,74, 79 n. 7,96-97,114 n. 16,115,127 n. 36,131-32,133 n. 46,145,165,170 n. 6,172 n. 9,175-77. 26 The principle here is stated by Benjamin D. Sommer, A Prophet Reads Scripture: Allu sionssions in Isaiah 40-66 (Contraversions; Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1998), 35. 27 Duguid (Ezekiel and the Leaders of Israel, 77) asserts, "The replacement of the foreign guards with Levites [44:11] is not regarded by Ezekiel as an innovation, however. The description</page><page sequence="8">692 Journal of Biblical Literature 131, no. 4 (2012) This service in 44:7ba, furthermore, must have to do with the background of offering animal sacrifices. The closest parallel to this concept is found in Lev 22:25— Aside from the P examples of Gen 17:12-27 and Exod 12:43, this is the only location inside the Pentateuch that mentions בן נכר. Moreover, note that likewise the expression קרב in the Hiphil along with the anthropomorphic deno tation of the matter of sacrifice as the "food" of God.28 First, the hiphil of קרב is used in both passages. Second, in both, Gods food functions syntactically as the direct object of the קרב verbs (Lev 22:25, לחם אלהכים; Ezek44:7, את־לחמי). This construction—"food/bread" (לחם) plus the genitive "of your/his God" ([1/אלהי[הם/ך) or "of me" (י)—occurs in the Hebrew Bible only in Num 28:2 and six times in the cluster of priesthood constraints in Leviticus 21-22 (21:6, 8, 17, 21, 22; 22:25), making Ezek 44:7-9's dependence on Lev 22:25 even more likely. Third, both texts use the same form of "foreigner" (classification בן + maqqef + נכר). In Leviticus the only time "foreigner" (בן־גכר) occurs in any form is in 22:25, and in Ezekiel the only time "foreigners" (בני־נבר) and "foreigner" (בן־נבר) occur in any form is in 44:7,9. Instead of this hapax legomenon in Ezekiel, we would have expected the semantically related term זרים ("strangers"). This is one indicator that Ezekiel here borrows from H: shared content has not been fully integrated into the Kontingent text text such that an element from the original context (the term בני־נכר) is not the obvious choice of language for the new context. The term "strangers" (זרים) was already used seven times in Ezekiel (7:21; 11:9; 16:32; 28:7,10; 30:12; 31:12) to refer to "either foreign nations functioning as Yhwh's agents of judgment or nations under divine judgment themselves."29 Consider Ezek 7:21, where Yhwh will trans fer Israel's valuable accoutrements to "strangers" (זרים) who "will profane it" (חללוהו) (cf. "to profane it" [לחללו] in 44:7). Also, in Lev 22:10,12, and 13 זר means of the offence of using foreigners as temple guards as a breach of covenant (Ezek. 44:7) would seem to imply the existence of legislation for a class of lawful keepers of the charge of the sanctu ary, such as found in Numbers 18:3f." Steven Shawn Tuell ("Contemporary Studies in Ezekiel," in Ezekiel'sEzekiel's Hierarchical World: Wrestling with a Tiered Reality [ed. Stephen L. Cook and Corrine L. Patton; SBLSymS 31; Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2004], 242-43) is right to question Ezekiel 44's dependence on Numbers 18: "While Num 18 requires the Levites to remain at a dis tance from the holy things, it does not state that the Levites are not to serve as priests. This, by con trast, is precisely what Ezek 44:14 does stipulate." That is, Ezek 44:14 presupposes that the Levites were once responsible to perform priestly service, whereas Numbers 18 in no way installs or endorses the Levites as priests. 28 Konkel, Architektonik, 103-4 (my translation).

For instance, Num 1:51 reads: ובחנת המשכן יקימו אתו הלוים והזר הקרב יומת ... and when the tabernacle encamps, the Levites are to set it up, but the un authorized person [הזר] who comes near is to be put to death.31 This cultic nuance of זר from Leviticus 22 and Numbers, coupled with Ezekiel's understanding of □זרי as profaning foreign nations, would have fit Ezek 44:7-9 pre cisely. Instead Yhwh retained the term from the Lev 22:25 Quellentext: בן־נכר ("for eigner"). III. Ezekiel 44:7-9: Exegetical Form and Ideological Extension A.A. The "Foreigner" in Leviticus 22:25 The "foreigner" (בךנבר) in Lev 22:25, we might infer, is not in covenant with Yhwh since he does not offer sacrifices directly (contra the גר: Lev 17:8-9; Num 15:14),32 but "can only send his sacrifices (which would be carefully inspected), as implied by this verse."33 What does this imply about Leviticus's disposition toward the foreigner? One scholar asserts that Lev 22:25, which he believes Ezek 44:7 has in view, excludes foreigners because "they are intrinsically defective (kî moshâtâm bàhem)bàhem) and fundamentally blemished (mûm bâm)"u However, this is a misinter pretation, since the motivation clause in Lev 22:25, "for their corruption is in them, they have a defect" (כי משחתם בהם מום בם), modifies "from all these" (מכל־אלה), which refers not to foreigners but to the animal sacrifices with defective genitals (22:24-25). 30 See HALOT 1:279, s.v. זר. 31 The wàw here is disjunctive, translated as "but," since (1) an "[ijnterclausal waw before a non-verb constituent has a disjunctive role"; (2) the verse shifts to new characters, from הלוים to 3) ;הזר) in contrast to הזר ,הלוים is prohibited from approaching the tabernacle (IBHS, 650-51). 32 Jacob Milgrom (Leviticus: A Book of Ritual and Ethics [CC; Minneapolis: Fortress, 2004], 273) argues: "Precisely because the alien [גר] is obligated to observe the prohibitive command ments, he can be trusted as much as the Israelite to enter the sacred compound in a pure state with an unblemished sacrifice." 33 Ibid. Similarly, Konkel (Architektonik, 104) avers: "In der Forschung wird die Ubersetzung des Textes stets so konjiziert, dafi an den Ankauf von Tieren aus dem Besitz von Auslandern gedacht sei. Ez 44,7f legt jedoch nahe, den Text beim Wort zunehmen: Lev 22,25 richtet sich ebenso wie Ez 44,7f gegen eine direkte Einbindung von Auslandern in den Opferbetrieb." 34 Block, Ezekiel, 622.</page><page sequence="10">694 Journal of Biblical Literature 131, no. 4 (2012) Leviticus 22:24-25 assumes, without expressing disapproval, that foreigners were involved to some degree in the process of animal sacrifice. Either they sold their sacrifices to native Israelites,35 or gave their sacrifices for Israelites to offer on their behalf,36 or donated their animals for Israelite use (this may have happened if they knew, like Balaam and Rahab, for example, that non-Israelites could benefit by blessing Israelites). In any case, the animals were to be without genital defect. Leviti eus 22:25, therefore, does not view foreigners antagonistically as inherently defiled but as indirect participants in the cultic sector. Even as outsiders, probably of non-Israelite ethnicity, who did not confess allé giance to Yhwh, foreigners were not yet considered a threat to the community's purity. The Exodus-Numbers narrative presents an inchoate stage of Israel's rela tionship to foreigners among them.37 In Exod 12:43 foreigners are precluded from eating the Passover meal,38 but their indirect participation in the sacrificial offer ings (Lev 22:25) and the absence of any warning against their negative influence suggest that they had not yet been associated with the seductive foreign gods of Canaan as portrayed in the Deuteronomistic History.39 B.B. "Uncircumcised in Heart and Flesh" in in Ezekiel 44:7-9 and Torah The neutral and ambiguous foreigner in Leviticus required Yhwh's qualifi cation, but why? The rationale is that Leviticus never anticipated that Israelites would staff Yhwh's sacred space with foreigners as priests and guards. Yet to qual ify Leviticus's prestigious prescriptions would require cautious skill. How does Yhwh accomplish this? The Ezek 44:7-9 Kontingenttext augments "foreigners" 35 Erhard S. Gerstenberger, Leviticus: A Commentary (OTL; Louisville: Westminster John Knox, 1996), 330. 36 Milgrom (Leviticus, 273). Baruch A. Levine (Leviticus ויקרא: The Traditional Hebrew Text with with the New JPS Translation [JPS Torah Commentary; Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1989], 152) suggests that a בךנכר had the option of selling or giving; Nobuyoshi Kiuchi (Leviti eus eus [Apollos Old Testament Commentary; Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity, 2007], 409) may also imply this option. 37 בךנכר occurs only in Exod 12:43 and Lev 22:25; the coterminous substantive adjective נכרי occurs in Exod 21:8 (עם נכרי, "foreign people"), 2:22 and 18:3 (בארץ נכריה, "in a foreign land"). 38 See n. 42 below. 39 Deuteronomy 31:16 ("after foreign gods of the land," 32:12 ;(אחרי אלהי נכר־הארץ ("for eign god," אל נכר); Josh 24:20 ("foreign gods," 24:23 ;(אלהי נכר ("foreign gods," אלהי הנכר); Judg 10:16 ("foreign gods," אלהי הנכר). There are exceptions, such as 1 Kgs 8:41-43 (2 Chr 6:32-33) and 2 Sam 15:19-20, but נכר in DtrH generally moves closer to the meaning of the Akkadian cognate nakru, which includes, in addition to "foreign" and "strange," the meanings "hostile" or "enemy" (CAD 11:189-95, s.v. nakru).</page><page sequence="11">Awabdy:Awabdy: Yhwh Exegetes Torah 695 (בני־נבר)(בני־נבר) with the neologism "uncircumcised with respect to heart and flesh" (ערלי־לב וערלי בשר). This elaboration indicates the direction of influence: the KontingenttextKontingenttext includes an expansion, not attested in earlier writings, that inter prêts the Quellentext. Whence comes Yhwh's notion of "doubly uncircumcised" foreigners, since it does not come from Leviticus?401 propose that this notion stems from a more developed Torah conceptually, Priestly, non-Priestly, and Holiness strands, from which Ezekiel draws regularly and fluidly.41 1. 1. 1. The Foreigner and Circumcision in the Torah The term "foreigner" (בךנכר) occurs in the Tetrateuch only in Gen 17:12-27; Exod 12:43; and Lev 22:25 (all Holiness texts?). Both Genesis 17 and Exodus 12 arguably permit foreign slaves, but not foreign freepersons, to enter the covenant community, provided they subject their bodies to circumcision.42 As for a non slave foreigner (בן־נכר), Exod 12:43c prohibits him emphatically from eating the Passover meal, and a syntactical analysis suggests that this was because he was uncircumcised.43 Probably assuming that the foreigner is bodily uncircumcised, 40 David L. Petersen ("Creation and Hierarchy in Ezekiel," in Cook and Patton, Ezekiel's Hierarchical Hierarchical World, 177-78) uses the phrase "doubly uncircumcised"; cf. Kohn, New Heart, 40-41. 41 Kohn (New Heart, 85) argues persuasively that Ezekiel "quotes, reverses, allegorizes and ignores" the language of the Holiness, Priestly and non-Priestly Torah traditions without distin guishing among them. 42 The prohibition in Exod 12:43c, U כל־בךנכר לא־יאכל ("no foreigner may eat of it [the Passover meal]"), is emphatic. First, it is the signal prohibition in the list. Second, the כל con struction involves a "negative" (לא) that is in this case "separated, and therefore stressed" (see HALOTHALOT 2:474-75, s.v. כל). Third, the negative particle לא with the prefixed conjugation (G-stem 3rd masc. sg.) carries the force of a general or permanent prohibition. Does this emphatic prohi bition in Exod 12:43 go without exceptions? The answer is likely no. Rather, Exod 12:43c-44 appears to align ideologically with Gen 17:12 insofar as circumcised slaves—typically those bought from a בן־נכו־ ("foreigner") and therefore members of the foreigner class—were the one exception to the prohibition of foreigners from celebrating Passover in Exod 12:43c. The probable disjunc tive wàw between v. 43c and v. 44 supports this reading: "No foreigner may eat of it, yet every person's slave purchased with money, after you have circumcised him, then he may eat of it" (כל־בךנכר לא־יאכל בו וכל־עבד איש מקנת־כסף ומלתה אתו אז יאכל בו)בו). Circumcised "slaves" (עבדים), then, who were included hyponymously within the larger foreigner (בן־נכר) class were permitted to celebrate Passover. Further support for this reading comes from Exod 21:2, which modifies עבד ("slave") with the appositive gentilic "Hebrew" (עברי). Without such modification a "slave" (עבד) was generally understood to be a foreigner. From this we may infer that "all" (כל) in Exod 12:44 included both Hebrew and foreign slaves who were circumcised. Such nuanced Passover legislation is not unparalleled; consider Num 9:6-10, where Yhwh provides an excep tion for those defiled by a corpse or on a distant journey to celebrate Passover. 43 The unit is framed by an inclusio of identical syntax: "no foreigner at all may eat of it" (בל־בךנבר לא-יאכל בו; v. 43c) and "But no uncircumcised person at all may eat of it" ("וכל־ערל לא יאכל בו; v. 48d). The immediate function of v. 48d is to reinforce that the "nonindigenous resident"</page><page sequence="12">696 Journal of Biblical Literature 131, no. 4 (2012) Deuteronomy (D) teaches Israelites how to relate to the נכרי ("foreigner," a sub stantive adjective with a meaning coterminous with בן־נכר) in their proximity. In D foreigners (נכרים) are not cultic celebrants (see Deut 16:10-15; 29:9-12) and are perceived as a potential threat to the solidarity of the holy community.44 The for eigner in the Quellentexte, then, is uncircumcised physically, but what about spir itually? Aside from Ezek 44:7-9, only twice are human hearts labeled metaphorically uncircumcised ([ערל + לב[ב), and in both instances the culprits are not foreigners but Israelites (Lev 26:41; Jer 9:24-25). After breaking Yhwh's covenant stipula tions, only when the Israelites' "uncircumcised heart" (לבבם הערל) is humbled (N stem of כנע) will Yhwh remember both his covenant with Israel's ancestors and the land of promise (Lev 26:41 ). In Jer 9:24-25 Yhwh announces his judgment not on "all the [physically] uncircumcised nations" (כל־הגוים ערלים), which included Judah(!), but on the house of Israel, who is "uncircumcised in heart" (ערלי־לב). The positive counterpart, heart circumcision, occurs only in D, wherein it frames the laws of chs. 12-26 by human and divine agency: "circumcise the foreskin of your heart" (10:16 ;ומלתם את ערלת לבבכם) and "Yhwh, your God, will circumcise your heart and the heart of your descendants" (ומל יהוה אלהיך את־לבבך ואת־לבב זרעך; 30:6). Human-initiated heart circumcision in D is the logical, and syntactical (voli (גר) must circumcise "all his males" (לו כל־זכר) in order for them to eat the Passover meal, but the obvious formal resemblance of v. 48d with v. 43c must not be overlooked. It is probable, based on identical syntax, that the בן־נכר (perhaps with the תושב and שכיר) was included hyponymously within the ערל ("uncircumcised") class. In this way, כל־ערל לא ("no uncircumcised person at all") functions as an all-encompassing metonym for the prohibited classes: the explicitly prohib ited "foreigner" (בן־נכר, v. 43c), "sojourner" (תושב, v. 45) and "day-laborer" (שכיר, v. 45), and the implicitly implicitly prohibited uncircumcised עבד ("slave," v. 44) and uncircumcised גר ("non-indigenous resident," v. 48). This governing criterion, circumcision, would then explain why Exodus 12 stresses that both permitted classes—the עבד and גר—must undergo circumcision in order to celebrate Passover with the Israelite community. 44 The non-Israelites excluded from Yhwh's assembly in Deut 23:2-9 may be גרים ("non indigenous residents") rather than נכרים ("foreigners") (see Gerhard von Rad, Deuteronomy: A Commentary Commentary [OTL; Philadelphia: Westminster, 1966], 146; Patrick Miller, Deuteronomy [Inter pretation; Richmond: John Knox, 1990], 175). Even so, D is reluctant to allow any integration of the "foreigner" (נכרי; always singular) into the Israelite community: Deut 14:21; 15:3; 17:15; 23:21; 29:21. The noun נכר, meaning "strange" or "foreign," modifies god(s) twice (31:16; 32:12). In 14:21 Israelites are prohibited from eating anything that dies, but may give it to the גר, or sell it to the נכרי. The גר was to be present at various cultic ceremonies, but the נכרי was not (5:14; 16:11,14; 26:11; 29:10-13). Every seven years Israelites were to declare a cancellation of debts from his neighbor and brother, but "from a foreigner [נכרי] you may exact payment" (15:1-3). Similarly, "You may charge interest to a foreigner, but to your fellow Israelite you shall not charge interest" (23:21). A נכרי was not to be installed as an Israelite king (17:15). Moreover, 15:1-3; 23:21; and 17:15 all confine the נכרי to a class distinct from the favored fellow Israelite class, namely, "your brother" (את־אחיך in 15:3; ולאחיך in 23:21; מקרב אחיך in 17:15). Finally, in Deut 29:21-23, the נכרי (in synonymous parallelism with "all the nations" [כל־הגוים] of 29:24) is located outside Yhwh's covenant people.</page><page sequence="13">Awabdy:Awabdy: Yhwh Exegetes Torah 697 tional wëqâtal form45), response to Yhwh's sovereignty and elective love (10:14 15); and Divine heart circumcision engenders love for Yhwh (30:6). 2.2. "Foreigner" with Its Semantic Relatives in Ezekiel In Ezekiel, "foreigners" (9 ,44:7 ,בני־נכר) and "strangers" (11:9 ;7:21 ,זרים; 16:32; 28:7,10; 30:12; 31:12) share the same semantic domain insofar as both are hyponymously contained within the broader "««circumcised" (ערלים) class. This uncircumcised class, found only in the oracles against foreign nations, often refers pejoratively to the (defiled) realm of slain non-Israelites with foreskins (e.g., 28:10; 31:18; 32:21). By contrast, the "nonindigenous resident" (גר), we learn from the Torah, had arguably bound himself to Yhwh and was integrated, to some degree, into the cultic community (Exod 12:41-51; Lev 17:8-15; Num 15:14; Deut 16:10 15; 29:9-12).46 In Deuteronomy, the disenfranchised ^-orphan-widow triad was often named with landless Levites (14:29; 16:11, 14; 26:11, 12, 13), but in Ezek 47:22-23 גרים ("nonindigenous residents") were innovatively granted land inheri tance.47 A גר was subject to the same laws as native Israelites.48 Thus, in Ezekiel, one may infer, the גר practiced the rite of circumcision (à la Exod 12:48-49). The "crit ical distinction," acutely observes David Petersen, "is not between Israelite and non Israelite, but between ritually acceptable foreigner and non-ritually acceptable foreigner. The hallmark is circumcision."49 If so, then in Ezekiel the nonindigenous subclasses are antonymous: the "nonindigenous resident" (גר) is defined by cir cumcision, "foreigners" (בגי־נכר) and "strangers" (זרים) by wncircumcision. 3. Ezekiel 44:7 as Ideological Extension of Torah In Ezek 44:7, 9, Yhwh states explicitly what Lev 22:25 may or may not have perceived but the rest of the Torah assumes, that foreigners were physically uncir 45IBHS, 536. 46 I prefer "nonindigenous resident." The translation "(resident) alien" (JPS [1985]; NIV), along with its cognates "to alienate" and "alienation," has a negative charge that גר does not have. "Foreigner" (Today's New International Version [TNIV]; New Living Translation [NLT]) is bet ter reserved for בן־נבר (HALOT 2:700, s.v. נכר); and to call a גר a "foreigner" would be a mis nomer in some biblical texts where the גר (singular) may be an Israelite immigrant from the northern kingdom (and the plural form גרים regularly refers to the Israelites' status in Egypt). "Stranger" (RSV; KJV; JPS [1917]; English Standard Version [ESV]) has its own term (HALOT 1:279, s.v. זר), likewise "sojourner" (HALOT 4:1712, s.v. תו׳שב). "Immigrant" is a possible trans lation, but certain modern connotations of immigration should not be superimposed onto the term. 47 Keith Carley ("From Flarshness to Hope," in Cook and Patton, Ezekiel's Hierarchical World, 119) thinks that 47:22-23 already refers to proselytes. 4848 See Exod 12:19,49; Lev 16:29; 17:12; 18:26; 24:22; cf. the priestly אזרח־גר "native" pair in Ezek 14:7, whereas Ezek 22:7 reflects the Deuteronomic ^-orphan-widow triad. 49 Petersen, "Creation and Hierarchy," 178.</page><page sequence="14">698 Journal of Biblical Literature 131, no. 4 (2012) cumcised. Ezekiel 44:7-9 is not solely a stepchild of the available Torah ideology but is innovative. For the first time in the Hebrew Scriptures foreigners, not Israelites, are said to be physically and spiritually uncircumcised. This innovation is not nec essarily discontinuous with Torah but likely develops D s precautious foreigner ide ology. The logic is that one who has not acquiesced to physical circumcision is recalcitrant toward Yhwh and his people and therefore must not be granted mem bership in the holy congregation. In other words, the indictment of Ezek 44:7-9, which centered on the presence of doubly uncircumcised foreigners in the temple, ideologically extended Torah's abiding conceptions about foreigners. The passage both preserves the authority of Lev 22:25 and moves beyond it on the basis of the broader Torah conceptuality. C. The "Profane" in Ezekiel 44:7 and Leviticus 18-22 Ezekiel 44:7 reuses yet another component from the Holiness (H) context, of which Lev 22:25 is a part: the "profane" (50.(חלל The house of Israel is culpable for bringing doubly unacceptable foreigners into Yhwh's sanctuary "to profane it" (לחללו). Yhwh's selection of the verbal root חלל is strategic in that it recalls a con trolling motif from H's context. The direction of literary influence from Leviticus to Ezekiel here is apparent since the Quellentext (H) provides the necessary con ceptual framework for the Kontingenttext (Ezek 44:7). Leviticus 22:24-25, in its present literary context, is constrained by the holy-profane (חלל-קדש) antinomy in chs. 18-22, which contain all eighteen of the occurrences of חלל in Leviticus.51 In Lev 10:10 (cf. Ezek 44:23) sober priests are instructed "to distinguish between the holy and the profane" (ולהבדיל בין הקדש ובין החל), which previews the holy profane antinomy of chs. 18-22, and "between the unclean and the clean" (ובין הטמא ובין הטהור), which previews the unclean-clean antinomy of chs. 11-15. The law of Lev 22:24-25 is directed toward Aaron's surviving sons, freshly ordained for priestly ministry (chs. 8-10), and illustrates for them how to delineate between the holy and the profane.52 50 The verb חלל, "to profane" (HALOT 1:319-20; not the homonymie root חלל, "pierced" or "slain"), is not attested in the G-stem, but in the D-, Dp-, N-, and H-stems. As such, the D-stem, as in Ezek 44:7, applies the factitive force (IBHS, 416): "to place it [my sanctuary] in a profane state." Even if one could demonstrate that the nominal cognate חל ("profane") is more primitive than the verb, חלל as a denominative would arguably still convey a factitive or resultative mean ing (IBHS, 400). Semantically overlapping with חלל is the term "abomination(s)" (תועבה), which in Leviticus refers only to sexual sin in ch. 18, but in Ezekiel it more broadly marks "an offensive act," which in our context centers on the Levites' idolatry (Ezek 18:20; 22:2; 23:6; 33:26; 44:6-7, 13). See John F. Kutsko, Between Heaven and Earth: Divine Presence and Absence in the Book of Ezekiel Ezekiel (Biblical and Judaic Studies 7; Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2000), 3. 51 Leviticus 18:21; 19:8, 12, 29; 20:3; 21:4, 6, 7,9[2x], 12, 14, 15,23; 22:2, 9, 15,32. 52 In Leviticus 21, priests are summoned to be holy, "They shall be holy to their God and not profane profane the name of their God, for they are the ones who present offerings by fire to Yhwh, food for their God. Therefore, they must be holy" (21:6). Leviticus 22:1-16 establishes standards for the</page><page sequence="15">Awabdy:Awabdy: Yhwh Exegetes Torah 699 The genius of Ezek 44:7-9 is its application of the central holy-profane mes sage of Leviticus 17-22. In Leviticus, defective animals brought or sold by Israelites or foreigners are profane, not holy, to Yhwh. Yhwh transfers the profanity from sacrificial sacrificial animals with genital defects brought or sold by foreigners (Lev 22:24-25) to the presence offoreigners with genital and spiritual foreskins in Yhwh's sanctu ary (Ezek 44:7-9). What might this transfer convey for those well acquainted with H s legislation? First, neither H nor Ezekiel differentiates cultic and ethical profan ity as separate categories, and each presents several mechanisms (classes of per sons and activities) as capable of profaning various objects, not least the sanctuary.53 As a result, in Ezek 44:7 Yhwh can navigate from one profaning mechanism to another—from bodily defective sacrificial animals to bodily and spiritually defec tive foreigners—in a seamless manner. Second, Ezekiel's uses of the "profane" (חלל) root, the last one occurring in 39:7, five chapters before ch. 44 and prior to the temple vision of chs. 40-48, are less hermeneutically relevant to Ezek 44:7-9 than the parallel language of Lev 21:23. Ezekiel 44 borrows from Lev 21:1-3,7,11,14,25, thereby increasing the probabil ity of alluding to yet another text from Leviticus 21,54 namely, 21:23. If any of Aaron's offspring had a bodily defect (à la Lev 21:16-23), that son "shall not go in to the veil nor approach the altar because he has a defect, so that he will not profane my sanctuaries my sanctuaries [חלל את־מקדשי]. Fori am Yhwh who sanctifies them" (Lev21:23). Ezekiel 44:7 reads similarly: "when you brought foreigners, uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my sanctuary to profane it" (להיות במקדשי 55.(לחללו Has Yhwh classified doubly uncircumcised foreigners with Aaron's phys use of holy offerings. Verse 2 introduces the chapter: "Speak to Aaron and to his sons to deal respectfully with the holy [offerings] of the sons of Israel, which they consecrate to me, so that they do not profane my holy name. I am Yhwh." Verses 17-32 detail acceptable offerings (without defect), and 23:1-8 discusses holy assemblies. The unit of chs. 18-22 culminates in 22:32-33 by the theocentric rationale/or holiness and against profanation: "You shall not profane [לא תחללו] my holy name [שם קדשי], but I will be sanctified [נקדשתי] in the midst of the Israelites; I am Yhwh who makes you holy [מקדשכם], who brought you out from the land of Egypt to be your God. I am Yhwh." 53 In H one may profane oneself (Lev 21:7); a holy thing (19:8); one's daughter, father, or off spring (19:29; 21:9, 15); God's name (18:21); or the sanctuary (21:12). In Ezekiel the three most profaned objects are Yhwh's Sabbaths (20:13, 16, 21; 22:8; 23:38), Yhwh's sanctuary (7:21, 22; 23:39; 24:21; 25:3), and Yhwh's name (20:9, 14, 22, 39; 36:20, 21, 22, 23; 39:7); the latter two resemble H. As for the mechanisms of profaning the sanctuary, in H child sacrifice to Molech defiles Yhwh's sanctuary and profanes Yhwh's holy name (Lev 20:3; cf. 18:21); and a priest, for an undefined reason, may profane the sanctuary (21:12). In Ezekiel Yhwh's sanctuary is profaned by "strangers" (Ezek 7:21, 22), "robbers" (7:22), Oholah (Samaria) and Oholibah (Jerusalem) (23:39), Yhwh himself (24:21), and an unidentified agent (passive voice) (25:3). 54 See nn. 23 and 24 above. 55 Block (Ezekiel, 505-616) provides an insightful diagrammatical analysis of Ezekiel's new temple compound (40:1-44:3), which is the direct narrative context (not the historical setting) of the profaned sanctuary in 44:7.</page><page sequence="16">700 Journal of Biblical Literature 131, no. 4 (2012) ically defective descendants who by their presence would profane Yhwh's sanctu aries? The resonances are too strong to dismiss this possibility. IV. Rhetorical and Theological Implications As an aggadic rhetor, Yhwh in Ezek 44:7-9 (Kontingenttext) reuses lexemes and contextual components from Lev 22:25 (Quellentext). However, Leviticus's embryonic and neutral conception of the foreigner does not anticipate defiled sacred space by doubly uncircumcised foreigners functioning as surrogate priests or guards (Ezek 44:7-8). As a result, the Kontingenttext must employ the termi nology of its Quellentext, extending its authority, but also move beyond it in order to indict rebellious Israel and prohibit foreigners from entering the sanctuary. To substantiate movement beyond the Quellentext, Yhwh assumes a larger and more developed Torah ideology that foreigners (בני־נבר) were physically uncircumcised. Probably by extending the logic of Deuteronomy's precautious disposition toward foreigners (נכרים, but not גרים, "nonindigenous residents"), Yhwh marks them as spiritually spiritually uncircumcised as well. With exegetical artistry Yhwh transfers the object of profanity from sacrificial animals with genital defects brought or sold by foreign ersers (Lev 22:24-25) to the presence offoreigners with genital and spiritual foreskins— reflective of Aaron's defective progeny (Lev 21:23)—inside Yhwh's sanctuary (Ezek 44:7). We are now at a juncture to observe that the present literary context of Ezek 44:7-9 presents Ezekiel as a new Moses for the restored temple community of chs. 40-48. H. McKeating has identified thematic parallels between Ezekiel and Moses, three of which are germane here.56 First, Moses and Ezekiel ascend a high moun tain, behold a vision of the projected sanctuary, and encounter the glory of Yhwh (Exodus 24-27; 33; Ezek 40:2; 43:1-5). Second, on their respective mountains Moses and Ezekiel receive regulations regarding priestly functions (Exodus 28-29; Ezek 44:15-31 ). Third, Moses, by prophesying and lawgiving, "creates a people"; so also Ezekiel, by the same means, recreates a people who had experienced the despair of exile (especially in chs. 40-48).57 56 McKeating ("'Prophet Like Moses,"' 97-109) argues that the narrative core of Ezekiel's visions, which includes 44:1-3 (and which I would expand to include v. 4), only generally and thematically reflects Moses in the Pentateuch. Thus, it takes Ezekiel's elaborators, writing in the late exile or early postexile, to augment this core with early pentateuchal, mainly legal, traditions in order to mark Ezekiel as a prophet like Moses, if not the prophet like Moses (à la Deut 18:15, 18). Regardless of whether one accepts McKeating's diachronic proposal, the present composi tion of Ezekiel 44 presents to readers a like-Moses prophet. 57 This parallel is substantiated by the cosmogonie imagery in chs. 40-48, as noted by Niditch, "Ezekiel 40-48," 208-24.</page><page sequence="17">Awabdy:Awabdy: Yhwh Exegetes Torah 701 Additional intriguing parallels exist between Exodus 40-Leviticus and the direct narrative context of our passage, Ezek 44:1-5: 1. 1. The presence of Yhwh's glory precludes even Israels divinely elected lead ers, Moses and Ezekiel, from entering into specified sacred spaces (Exod 40:35; Ezek 44:1-3). 2. Moses and Ezekiel witnessed the glory of Yhwh fdl (מלא + כבוד יהוה [G stem]) his shrine (Exod 40:34 [Moses referenced in 40:33, 35]; Ezek 44:4). 3. Immediately following this theophany, Yhwh speaks directly to Moses and to Ezekiel (Lev 1:1; Ezek 44:5). 4. The content of Yhwh's speech to Moses and to Ezekiel is instruction con cerning cultic and ethical matters (i.e., sins requiring atonement in Leviti eus 1-7 are not confined to the cultic domain but must have entailed the social and environmental ethics of Leviticus 18-26; Ezek 44:6-31). 5. Yhwh's instructions, mediated through Moses and Ezekiel, are called "statutes" (חקים/חקות) and "laws" (תורת) (Lev 26:46; Ezek 44:5). This narrative presentation of Ezekiel as a new Moses substantiates Ezekiel 44 s portrait of Yhwh as an aggadic interpreter of prior Torah legislation. If the Second Temple community ever questioned the authority of Ezekiel 44's priestly laws, which were mainly transformed Leviticus laws, they needed only to reread or rehear the episode in 44:1-5 of Ezekiel's profoundly Moses-like relationship with Yhwh. Furthermore, we may view Ezekiel's motif of the glory of Yhwh in a new light.58 Scholars often underscore the return of Yhwh's glory to his temple in Ezekiel 43 (w. 2 [2x], 4, 5), which introduces the so-called Law of the Temple in Ezek 43:10-46:24. But it is the final reference to God's glory filling the temple in 44:4 that gives context to ch. 44 s indictments and priestly prescriptions (w. 6-31). The presence of Yhwh that formerly abandoned the temple (Ezekiel 8-11) has returned (43:2-5; 44:4), and the exiles, through Ezekiel's theophanic descriptions, could experience vicariously that very divine presence.59 Admission of doubly uncircumcised foreigners into Yhwh's sacred space appears in the signal position of the cultic infractions (44:6-14) that, if repeated, could incite another episode of divine abandonment (à la Ezek 5:11) and temple destruction (24:21-27). It is for this reason that Ezek 44:6-14 is preoccupied with clarifying the divinely sanctioned means of approaching Yhwh in his outer and inner sanctums.60 58 See the insightful articles by Daniel I. Block, John T. Strong, and Steven S, Tuell in The Book Book ofEzekiel: Theological and Anthropological Perspectives (ed. Margaret S. Odell and John T. Strong; SBLSymS 9; Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2000). 59 Steven S. Tuell, "Divine Presence and Absence in Ezekiel's Prophecy," in Odell and Strong, Book Book Book ofEzekiel, 97-116. 60 The language of nearness to, or conversely undesirable distance from, Yhwh entails the illegitimate animal offering (H-stem of קרב, "to bring near"; v. 7); the foreigners' admission into the sanctuary as priests or guards (w. 7-8), and their consequent exclusion (v. 9); non-Zadokite</page><page sequence="18">702 Journal of Biblical Literature 131, no. 4 (2012) This suggests yet another resonance with the Exodus-Leviticus context: "Yhwh"Yhwh cannot be approached, even by Moses [Exod 40:35], and the gap between God and man remains insuperable. After Ex 40, Lev 1-10 recounts the gradual abol ishmentishment of this gap."61 The gap is twofold in Ezekiel 44. First, because of the divine presence presence only "the prince" (הנשיא) may sit in the outer, eastern gate that Yhwh had entered and closed to everyone else (44:1-3). Second, because of the divine près enceence the house of Israel could rebel against Yhwh only with accompanying alien ation. Among other abominations, Israel staffed the temple with foreigners, twice uncircumcised, and thereby engendered divine-human distance: the entire house of Israel, not just the non-Zadokite Levites, has broken covenant with Yhwh (v. 6);62 doubly uncircumcised foreigners are perpetually banned from Yhwh's sanctuary (v. 9); and non-Zadokite Levites may no longer perform the duties that required the closest proximity to Yhwh's holiness (w. 12-13). As in Leviticus, Yhwh in Ezekiel 44 graciously initiates the abolishment of the divine-human chasm by means of revelatory instruction. Yhwh's presence and Israel's nearness to him are contin gent, to a significant measure, on Israel's obedience to this new Torah, contextual ized by Yhwh himself for a prophetic priest's community and its posterity. In closing, even with the advantages of reading Ezek 44:7-9 against the back drop of the language of Leviticus 21-22 and the precautious foreigner ideology of the Torah, important questions remain unanswered. Does the neologism "uncir cumcised in heart and flesh" elucidate the status of all foreigners (בגי־נכר) or merely a subset? Does Ezek 44:9 forbid all foreigners from the temple precincts or only a subset: "No foreigner who is uncircumcised.. ."?63 In other words, does the text intimate that there existed a circumcised foreigner (בן־נכר) class, or is such a class Levites who went "far from" and "astray from" Yhwh (v. 10); priestly service "in my sanctuary" and "in the house" (v. 11); non-Zadokite Levites who "shall not come near to me ..." because of their idolatry (v. 13; cf. v. 10); Zadokite Levites, who were faithful to Yhwh, and who shall "come near to me... stand before me" (v. 15) and "enter my sanctuary... come near to my table" (v. 16). 61 Christophe Nihan, From Priestly Torah to Pentateuch: A Study in the Composition of the Book Book of Leviticus (FAT 25; Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2007), 90 (emphasis his). 62 Block comments insightfully: "It is not clear which covenant Ezekiel has in mind. While some argue for Yahweh's covenant with Levi, this interpretation not only focuses prematurely on Levites, who are first named in w. 9-14 [sic for w. 10-14], but also overlooks that the present crimes involve the entire house of Israel. Ezekiel views the temple in the midst of the people as a visible sign of Yahweh's covenant. Israel's failure to respond to his gracious presence with ethical and cultic obedience absolved Yahweh of his responsibility toward his covenant partner. To the prophet, the admission of foreigners into the temple struck at the heart of Israel's relationship with God" (Ezekiel, 624). 63 Cf. La Bible en français courant: "aucun étranger qui est incirconcis et qui ne m'obéit pas." Genesis 17:14 marks a subset of the "male" (זכר) class of persons by the adjective "uncircumcised" (ערל). Further, appositives used to specify a subset of a nominal class occur throughout Ezekiel 44: "to the rebellious ones, specifically, to the house of Israel" (אל־מרי אל־בית ישראל; v. 6); "to pro fane it, specifically, my house" (v. 7); "But the Levitical priests, specifically, the sons of Zadok</page><page sequence="19">Awabdy:Awabdy: Yhwh Exegetes Torah 703 an oxymoron in Ezekiel as it likely would have been in the Torah? If such a class did exist, would Yhwh in Ezekiel 44 have permitted such foreigners to enter Jerusalem, encounter Yhwh, and pray to him in the vicinity of his temple (1 Kgs 8:41-43; 2 Chr 6:32-33), to pray joyfully and offer sacrifices on Yhwh's altar (Isa 56:1-7), or even serve as Yhwh's priests (Isa 66:18-21)? We may safely conclude that in Ezek 44:7-9 any impulse toward integrating eligible foreigners into Yhwh worship has been subordinated to restoring and maintaining the purity of Yhwh's sacred space. who kept.. .והכהנים הלוים בני צדוק אשר שמח) ״; v. 15); "into the sanctuary, specifically, into the inner court.. .אל־הקדש אל־החצר הפנימית) ״; v. 27).</page></plain_text>
