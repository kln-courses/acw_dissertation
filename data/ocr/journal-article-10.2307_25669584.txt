<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Spiritual and Biographic to Boundary-Marking Deterrent Art: A Reinterpretation of Writing-on-Stone Luc Bouchet-Bert ABSTRACT Writing-On-Stone art has long been interpreted as having been created only for spiritual reasons. While not denying that spiritualism was important at Writing-On-Stone, an examination of the social, political, and geographic contexts of its historic rock art leads to the theory that Writing-On-Stone was also a Blackfoot boundary-marker, and a warning to their enemies not to cross it. Writing-On-Stone was located between the Blackfoot and numerous hostile nations to the south, in an area through which many different groups passed on military and hunting raids into Blackfoot territory. Because Natives used narrative art to boast of prowess and skill and to elevate their status, the heavy presence of this art at Writing-On-Stone in historic times is interpreted as a deliberate message to various enemy groups that the Blackfoot were a force best left unprovoked. Keywords: Writing-On-Stone; rock art; boundary marking; intimidation tactics; Blackfoot Writing-On-Stone is a concentration of rock art along a seven km stretch of the Milk River, north of the Sweetgrass Hills, near the Alberta-Montana border. Here eroded sandstone outcrops provide the canvases for the highest concentration of rock art found on the northwestern Plains (Klassen 1995:196). While the origins of this art have re mained somewhat controversial, its purpose has been consistently interpreted by scholars as being spiritualistic (ceremonial or iconic) and story-tell ing (biographic or narrative) in nature. Though agreeing with that basic interpretation, this study considers the entire social, political, and environ mental context in which the art was created, and uses textual and archaeological evidence to sug gest that this art also functioned as a tribal bound ary marker to deter potential enemies. INTRODUCTION TO THE ART Writing-On-Stone art is composed of several motifs, including anthropomorphs, zoomorphs, material culture items, tool grooves, and geometric abstracts (Keyser 1977a: 124-166). Anthropo morphs are the most common motif, with over 700 at 46 of the 58 sites known in 1977. These comprise several categories: shield-bearing warriors; classic V-neck; other, "more simple" V-necks; rectangular body; X-shaped; stick figure; and abstract and unclassifiable. Anthropomorphs are often depicted in action scenes, most notably horseback riding, combat scenes, battle scenes, and, rarely, hunting scenes (Figure 1 a-d). Material items associated with these anthropomorphs include clothing, weap ons, rake-like (ceremonial?) objects, and tipis, while horses are shown with bridles, whips, halters, tra vois, armor, and saddles. Horses are by far the most common zoomorph, with 250 at 41 sites (Keyser 1977a: 138). Only 12 bison are depicted (keeping with the fact that bi son are rare in Northwestern Plains art). Various elk, deer, and pronghorn also occur as isolated fig ures or in the rare hunting scenes. There are also tool grooves and geometric ab stracts. Tool grooves are long, narrow, and deep grooves common at most of the petroglyph sites at Writing-On-Stone. Most are randomly oriented and scattered haphazardly across the sandstone faces. This suggests they were created from sharpening Luc Bouchet-Bert, Department of Archaeology, University of Calgary, Calgary, Alberta, Canada, T2N 1N4 Plains Anthropologist, Vol. 44, No. 167, pp. 27-46, 1999 27</page><page sequence="2">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 44, No. 167,1999 -^77^- ^% fl ^J^V? ^ ^ a b c d Figure 1 a-d.

Other grooves, conversely, are short, vertical, of equal length, evenly spaced, and ar ranged in neat series. These features combined have led to the conclusion that they "probably rep resent tally marks, although the subjects being counted are unknown" (Keyser 1977a: 162). As for geometric abstracts, because these were carved with great care, scholars assume they had sym bolic meaning to their makers (Keyser 1997b:47 48). THE ART AND ITS CREATORS ? PREVIOUS INTERPRETATIONS James D. Keyser (1977a: 166ff; 1977b), in his extensive analysis of Writing-On-Stone, distin guished two functional rock art types "on the ba sis of subject matter, variation in composition of site panels, and stylistic differences...." The first is ceremonial art, identified as prehistoric due to a lack of associated historic artifacts and character ized by shield-bearing warriors, classic V-neck style 28</page><page sequence="3">Luc Bouchet-Bert A Reinterpretation of Writing-on-Stone anthropomorphs, tool grooves, and naturalistic and boat-form zoomorphs. Less common motifs in this category are large rectangular anthropomorphs, angular and rectilinear abstracts, rakes, and bow spears. This art was deemed personal and religious, functioning as part of a ritualized vision quest. This interpretation, however, is only weakly supported by ethnographic data. Teit (1930:79,194) has docu mented the use of pictography in the vision quest ceremonies of the Columbia Plateau tribes. This art is characterized by isolated abstract humans and the intimate association of anthropomorphs with animals and abstract designs. While similar art does occur at Writing-On-Stone, the extent to which this observation can be applied to non-Columbia Pla teau tribes is, unfortunately, unknown. Biographic art, on the other hand, was identi fied as historic, comprising "...records of individual warriors' personal war, hunting, and sexual exploits, similar in form and function to pictographic records of such exploits and honors painted by most Plains Indian tribes on buffalo hides and tipi covers..." (Keyser 1977a: 174). According to Keyser (1979:46) the two categories reflect different functions. Namely, "prior to the historical period, status rested primarily on power acquired through the vision quest rather than by a system of graded war hon ors," whereas with the advent of the historic era the art became no longer spiritually oriented but instead reflected more prosaic, biographical events as the importance of coup and horses increased (Magne and Klassen 1991:413). Curiously, given the above statement, Keyser (1977a; 1977b:55; 1979) believes differences in the rock art of the two periods are the not the result of changes occurring within a single culture's value systems, but are rather from different cultural groups creating the art at different times. Based "on the almost exact coincidence of its distribution with the known range of the Plains Shoshone dur ing the late prehistoric and early historic period," Keyser (1977a: 177) suggests the prehistoric shield bearing warrior and its associated motifs are Shoshonean, while the historic rock art "is prob ably the work of Blackfoot, Cree, Gros Ventre and Assiniboine artists" (Keyser 1977b:56), because these tribes are known to have occupied or had access to the Writing-On-Stone area in historic times. Contradicting this position, however, are Mar tin Magne and Michael Klassen (1991:413), who state that "...the changes observed in the historical rock art probably resulted from changes within a single culture, brought on following the introduc tion of the horse and gun, rather than the appear ance of a new culture." Using cluster analysis, these authors show that historic and prehistoric anthropomorphs are in fact stylistically related to each other. They conclude that "a single culture was responsible for all of the rock art, or that sev eral groups continuously depicted rock art from the later prehistoric until the historic periods" (Magne and Klassen 1991:416). As the Shoshone did not have a major presence on the Alberta plains in historic times, they are ruled out as a possible creators of the art (Magne and Klassen 1991:415). In a more recent study, Klassen (1995) has in dicated that Keyser's terms "ceremonial" and "bio graphic" are inappropriate due to the strict ethnic and chronological divisions they assume, noting that in fact secular themes persist throughout both the prehistoric and historic periods. As Magne and Klassen (1991:411) observe, "although the 'cer emonial' or 'spiritual' significance of later prehis toric art may be high, a strong 'biographical' com ponent is also possible considering the involve ment of a number of shield-bearing warriors...." This has led Klassen (1995:146ff) to group the Writ ing-On-Stone imagery into "iconic" and "narrative" categories, which though similar in function to Keyser's "ceremonial" and "biographic" concepts, are not restricted ethnically or chronologically in any way. He does not, however, alter Keyser's overall interpretation of the site. In the end Klas sen (1995:149-151) agrees with Keyser (1977a: 174) that the rock art themes at Writing-On-Stone are associated with those of vision quest and war records painted on shields, tipis, buffalo robes, hides, and shirts (as documented ethnographically), and reaffirms that Writing-On-Stone basically served only two purposes: exalting the spirit world, and recording activities grounded in reality. As to why people chose to record activities grounded in reality at this site, these authors assume it was only for spiritual purposes, despite the fact that war records are known to have served purely secular purposes (see discussion below). Keyser (1977a: 174-175), for example, believes this art was 29</page><page sequence="4">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 44, No. 167,1999 placed there to impress the supernatural, while Klas sen (1995:191), despite recognizing that much of the Writing-On-Stone art is of the narrative tradi tion, concludes that it was spiritual in nature and reflected a "cosmic conception" of the world. Another study which has taken a spiritual in terpretation of the art at Writing-On-Stone should also be mentioned at this point. In Mystical Themes in Milk River Rock Art, Patricia Barry (1991) ar gues that shamans were responsible for all of the art at Writing-On-Stone, and that the art therefore reflects shamanistic symbolism. To demonstrate this, she proceeds to search for cross-cultural analogies that support this interpretation, based on the notion that "...always and everywhere sha mans have had more in common with each other than with their own tribal groups in which they formed a gifted elite." Thus she (loosely) employs in her interpretations what Gould (1978) terms the ethnographic "discontinuous model," which seeks analogies in cultures that manipulate similar envi ronments in similar ways, regardless of the time or space that may separate them. For example, as an introduction to her study, Barry (1991:10) states that "along the way I cite many analogs from other cultures, not only from North and South America, but from Europe, Asia, and elsewhere," and that the deeper meaning of the art may be elicited from these analogical comparisons, which form "the universal context in which these pictures should be viewed." While this sort of approach has been deemed useful by those who espouse a contrastive ap proach, where differences between the archaeo logical record and the analogs are noted and ex plained (e.g., Gould 1978), Barry (1991) is more in terested in finding similarities or a positive fit be tween the analogs and the archaeological data. For example, due to the recognized role of the shaman as a fertility figure in many cultures, Barry (1991:67 75) sees phallic imagery everywhere in the Writing On-Stone art: "Arrow-tipped bows that are unmis takably phallic stand beside tiny shield men...," while "elsewhere a shield figure clutches a great phallic arrow of evident power." Tool sharpening or tally grooves are in fact rows of phalluses, and in one scene a horseman wields "an ambiguous weapon in the shape of a long fringed phallic lance" (Barry 1991:73). Likewise, vulvas are omnipresent: horse tracks are not horse tracks, but "here, horse shoe-shaped forms are among the symbols of fe male sexual power," and in a battle scene a rough circle from which emanates tracks leading to com batants is not a camp or a gun emplacement, as has previously been interpreted, but it is in reality a vulva. It is clear from these examples that when used in a non-contrastive manner, analogy merely projects ethnography onto the past and as such it remains illustrative in nature (Stahl 1993). As Klas sen (1995:34) commented, "rather than making the conclusions fit the images, she makes the images fit the conclusions, and proceeds to see evidence of shamanism in the most spurious of visual resem blances." Overall, Barry's lack of understanding of the basic theoretical issues surrounding the use of ethnographic data in analyzing the art at Writing On-Stone has led to a misuse of analogy which, in the end, fails to convince the reader of her interpre tations. AN ALTERNATE INTERPRETATION Dempsey's (1973), Keyser's (1977a; 1977b; 1996), Klassen's (1995), and, to a lesser extent, Barry's (1991) primarily spiritual explanations of the function of the Writing-On-Stone rock art fit with modern Native oral traditions that assign to it a strong spiritual significance. Because these tradi tions unanimously state that the art was placed there by spirits (or birds) in order to communicate with humans (see Dempsey 1973), it seems these authors assumed that the art was created for spiri tual reasons and that this must have carried over into later oral traditions. By basing their interpre tive conclusions on modern beliefs, however, these authors may be placing too much emphasis on in terpretations of the art that were clearly mytholo gized sometime after its original creation (Dempsey 1973:23,42). While these modern Native beliefs are valid and informative in their own right, this study is not concerned with how Native interpretations of Writing-On-Stone evolved after the art's creation. Rather, this study assumes that this art was made by humans, and intends to explore the intentions these humans had at the moment they were creating it. My thesis is that a different function may lie behind the explicit use of "icons of power and narratives of glory" (Klassen 1995) at this particu lar location, other than a purely spiritual one. I shall 30</page><page sequence="5">Luc Bouchet-Bert A Reinterpretation of Writing-on-Stone explore the possibility that the art may have been intended as a deterrent boundary-marker. Deterrent art is well-known in other parts of the world. The famous head-smiting scenes of the pharaohs and the colossal statues of Rameses II on the southern frontier of Egypt at Abu Simbel are examples. Obviously not art for art's sake, the con text of this art emitted very specific messages that served to bolster the ruler's power and legitimacy and to prevent others from challenging it. In the example of Abu Simbel, the colossal statues not only marked the boundary between Egypt and Nubia, but served as a warning to the Nubians not to cross that boundary. Their sheer size demon strated the power wielded by Pharaoh, which it was hoped would intimidate and thus deter any Nubians from raiding Egyptian territory (Redford 1997). It is here suggested that the art motifs so prominently displayed at Writing-On-Stone may have served the same function. That is, in providing some sort of narrative story-line that could be read by mem bers of plains societies accustomed to this particu lar artistic tradition (Keyser 1996:48), the art func tioned as a tribal boundary-marker whose story might be construed as a serious warning to others not to transgress that boundary. If Writing-On-Stone art did in fact serve to in timidate enemies and discourage them from tres passing the boundary it marked, then several con ditions should be met. It must be demonstrated that first, there was conflict between the tribes that lived in the area; second, Writing-On-Stone was situated in a boundary zone between mutually-hos tile tribes; third, Writing-On-Stone was an area likely frequented by the intended receivers of the mes sage; fourth, the art motifs are deterrent in nature (that is, they project an image of power and force that indicate the artists are to be reckoned with); and finally, the Writing-On-Stone art was mostly created by a single culture, to mark its boundary zone and threaten potential enemies. TRIBAL TERRITORIES AND CONFLICTS ON THE SOUTHERN ALBERTA PLAINS To illuminate these first two points archaeol ogy is of little help, as the Old Women's point phase is too general to allow the identification of ethnic variants on the Northwestern Plains (Klassen 1995:82). Historic documents, however, provide relevant information. Thompson's Narrative (Glover 1962) and Peter Fidler's journal (Haig 1991) shed much light on contact-era Native political and territorial relations in southern Alberta. From these two accounts it is obvious that, at least in historic times, numerous ethnic groups oc cupied or had access to the southern Alberta or Writing-On-Stone region and had considerable contact with each other. It seems clear that south ern Alberta was a crossroads for Native groups (Brink 1979:4). In this era's political geography, the Blackfoot were at home along the Bow River and as far south as the Oldman River, while the Snake were raiding the Blackfoot from a home territory well within Montana, near the Missouri River (Haig 1991:34; Magne et al. 1987:226). Writing-On-Stone lay in a boundary zone between the two tribal terri tories. In fact the Blackfoot considered the region of Writing-On-Stone the limit of their territory up to at least 1822, when a Hudson's Bay Company em ployee named John Harriott reached the Sweetgrass Hills with two Blackfoot guides. After a day's travel south they refused to continue, afraid of being at tacked by the enemy (Dempsey 1973:51). Hostilities between the Blackfoot and their southern neighbors were widespread. In Thompson's Narrative, Saukamappee, a 75 to 80 year-old Cree allied with the Peigans, starts his recollection by saying "[t]he Peeagans [Peigan] were always the frontier Tribe, and upon whom the Snake Indians made their attacks, these latter were very numerous, even without their allies; and the Peeagans had to send messengers among us to procure help" (Glover 1962:240). When he was about sixteen, around 1730, Saukamappee and 20 other Cree allied themselves to a Peigan war party and fought a foot battle against the Snake on the plains of Eagle Hill. Some years later Saukamappee again left his camp to join the Peigan, but "...by this time the affairs of both parties had much changed; we had more guns and iron headed arrows than be fore; but our enemies the Snake Indians...had Misstutim (Big Dogs, this is Horses) on which they rode..." (Glover 1962:241). In the ensuing battle, however, the Snake did not have horses and as a result suffered more than fifty dead. In the follow ing years, many lesser engagements were fought, in which the Peigan had the advantage of "Guns, arrow shods of iron, long knives, flat bayonets and 31</page><page sequence="6">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 44, No. 167,1999 axes from the Traders" (Glover 1962:245). This con tinued until a smallpox epidemic reduced the popu lation by a third and forced a lull in the fighting. Here Saukamappee states that the Peigan would perhaps "...have made peace with [the Snake] for they had suffered dreadfully as well as us and had left this fine country of the Bow River to us" (Glover 1962:247). Three years later, however, when Thompson arrived in 1787, a Peigan hunting camp up a branch of the Bow River was set upon by a large party of Snake, who left the area littered with scalped bodies that were "partly devoured by the Wolves and Dogs " (Glover 1962:247). From this textual evidence it is clear that the Peigan had problems with the Snake. This is dem onstrated by Saukamappee's opening statement (Glover 1962) that the Snake were numerous and the Peigan had to call for reinforcements to help fight them. Even many years later, when Thomp son arrived, a Peigan war chief stated of the Snake Indians, "they keep us always on our guard" (Glover 1962:248). This echoed an earlier state ment of Matthew Cocking, a Hudson's Bay Com pany employee who in 1772 travelled through Black foot territory and observed that "the Natives in general are afraid of the Snake Indians and say they are nigh at hand" (Burpee 1908:106). Indeed, in observing a camp of about 150 Peigan tents on the banks of the Highwood River, 18 miles south of the Bow River, Fidler explained this large number as a precaution against enemy attack: "When near the Enemies Country, they are always found in large bands, that they may be the more able to resist any enemies that may dare to attack them, which is gen erally either the Snake, Flatt Heads or Crow Moun tain Indians" (Haig 1991:33). Clearly, the Blackfoot may have needed a de terrent boundary-marker. First, numerous mutually hostile groups occupied the southern Alberta re gion. Raids were continuously conducted across this area into Blackfoot territory. Second, Writing On-Stone, midway between the Bow and Missouri rivers, lay between the Blackfoot in the north and the Snake, Flathead, Crow, and others in the south, and thus was a boundary zone delineating their territories. Finally, the Blackfoot were apprehen sive about their southern enemies. Given the politi cal situation in southern Alberta immediately prior to and during the contact era, and considering its geographic location and the specific type of artis tic motifs displayed there, it is reasonable that Writ ing-On-Stone could have served as a deterrent boundary marker for the Blackfoot to display their strength and military prowess in response to the constant threat of attack from their northward-raid ing enemies. Writing-On-Stone was chosen for this purpose because it "...was easily accessible to eth nic groups from the south, such as the Crow and Shoshone, from the north and east, including the Blackfoot, Gros Ventre and Assiniboine, and from the west, such as the Flathead and Kootenay. As a result, all of these groups were probably familiar with the site, and may have passed through the area on raids, buffalo hunts, and other excursions" (Klassen 1995:103). WRITING-ON-STONE AS A HIGH-USE AREA Is it certain that many tribes did pass through the Writing-On-Stone area? To answer this ques tion it would be beneficial to consider the land scape surrounding Writing-On-Stone. The environmental context of Writing-On Stone's art has been studied by authors who ad vance the position that for the Natives Writing On-Stone served a purely spiritual function. Key ser (1977b:52) believes that a combination of fac tors caused the inhabitants of southern Alberta to choose Writing-On-Stone for their vision quests and thus begin making their rock art there, the chief one being that it was located in an awe-inspiring environment that was an ideal place for contact with the supernatural. Barry (1991:14) explains that "...the 'triptych' of stone, water, and tree has been, the world over, the hallmark of the holy site as a dwelling-place of spirits." Likewise, Tacon (1990:13) states that while all landscape is sacred within Na tive cultures, the focal points of spiritual energy are found in high places and areas that mark the interfaces of water, rock, earth, and sky. Klassen (1995:195), further confirming the spiritual signifi cance that Writing-On-Stone held for the Natives, notes that "...the landscape at Writing-On-Stone is dominated by the nearby presence of the Sweet grass Hills, one of the most powerful locations within the sacred geography of the Blackfoot...." While the spiritual aspect of Writing-On-Stone could certainly have been a major factor in its se 32</page><page sequence="7">Luc Bouchet-Bert A Reinterpretation of Writing-on-Stone lection as a rock art site, it might also have been chosen for landscape features different from the ones proposed above. If this art served a deterrent boundary-marking purpose, it should only make sense that it be located in a place where its mes sage could assuredly be transmitted to its targeted receivers (i.e., other tribes). Thus I propose the al ternate view that Writing-On-Stone was also cho sen as a rock art site for more secular reasons. While it is true the Sweetgrass Hills acted as a "spiritual magnet" because they dominated the landscape around Writing-On-Stone (Klassen 1995:195), they also acted as a secular magnet to many different Native groups on the Northwestern Plains. As forested islands abruptly rising some 3,600 feet above the level of the surrounding grass plains, the Sweetgrass Hills are visible from great distances (Schwab 1994:59). This undoubtedly had the effect of luring curious visitors to the area. The Sweetgrass Hills also marked the heart of buffalo hunting grounds used by Blackfoot, Gros Ventre, Assiniboine, Salish, Shoshone, Crow, and Sioux tribes (Schwab 1994). Their hilltops afforded a pan oramic view of the surrounding prairies, and as such were used not only by hunters to spot game, but also by war parties from various tribes as military observation points (Dempsey 1973:58). By virtue of its proximity to the Sweetgrass Hills, Writing-On-Stone would have also received much attention. Barry (1991:15) states that "its very location was signalled as far as a hundred miles away across the prairie by the looming Sweetgrass Hills...." From these hills one would instantly no tice 10 km to the north, juxtaposed sharply from its surrounding prairie landscape, the mass of green life and stark cliffs of Writing-On-Stone. It makes sense, then, that the many groups who were famil iar with and used the Sweetgrass Hills area for all sorts of purposes, were also familiar with Writing On-Stone. This would have made Writing-On Stone an ideal area for the Blackfoot to display any messages they wanted their opponents to receive. That Writing-On-Stone was a high-use area famil iar to all in the region is made likely by two addi tional facts. Historic documents show that one of the reasons a North West Mounted Police (NWMP) post was set up at Writing-On-Stone in 1887 was that it is an excellent fording location: During the last week in March, I was di rected by Superintendent Neale to go out and select points for the detachments along the boundary line.... I went south, across Kipp's Coulee, to the Milk River Ridge, and from there, via Writing Stone to Pend'oreille Coulee, both places I found suitable for detachments, as they are situated in places where the river may be forded easily when the water is very high, and the banks being accessible are much used by travellers and law breakers in crossing the bound ary. (Steele 1888:55, emphasis added). In addition to being used by later whiskey smugglers, Writing-On-Stone was the main cross ing point used by Indian war parties (Dempsey 1973:64,68) and the location of an important north south trail. This is shown on a map of the area drawn by Chief Little Bear for Peter Fidler in 1802 (Figure 2), which identifies significant resources and points of reference, and indicates three estab lished north-south trails that cross the Kin-nax-is sa-ta or Milk River to connect the south Saskatchewan country with the Missouri Valley. The first trail crosses the Milk River directly north of the Sweetgrass Hills and southwest of Lake Pakowki, exactly where Writing-On-Stone is located (Dempsey 1973:49). While Writing-On-Stone was used as a pas sageway by Native groups, the use of this par ticular trail must be examined. Though there are many Blackfoot accounts of passing through Writ ing-On-Stone while on the warpath, various tales mention that the Blackfoot deliberately went to Writing-On-Stone as a place where the spirits' writ ings that predicted the future could be read, so as to learn of the impending success or failure of the war party (Dempsey 1973:26ff). This raises a seri ous question: did Blackfoot war parties alone cut through Writing-On-Stone because of the picto graphs (which made it a spiritually important place), as the Blackfoot tales imply, or did the pictographs exist at Writing-On-Stone because of the war par ties that crossed there in the first place? If the former is true, this might indicate that Writing-On Stone was located not in a practical location ac cessed by all, but an isolated spiritual one perhaps used uniquely by the Blackfoot. This would make the deterrent art hypothesis untenable, for the art could not have served propaganda purposes if nobody but the Blackfoot had been there to see it. 33</page><page sequence="8">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 44, No. 167,1999 ^ * ^ m.uuo^ : KI0OCUS, 1802 ^^^^ \^ ^_South Sa^fr &lt;u-kwi___._^ O^Thiot \ ^&lt;5^Milk River C "Ptss HtHi?"^*"* 3 y VHilfs ^ ^ Figure 2. Map drawn by Chief Little Bear for Peter Fidler in 1802, showing the trail that cuts through Writing-On Stone (arrow) (from Harris 1987: Plate 59). It is probably safe to assume, however, that the trail existed first and the petroglyphs followed later. Dempsey (1973:42), for example, thinks "...it is pos sible that the pictographs were placed there after the [battles], and over the years, in telling and re telling the tale, they became a part of the story itself." Indeed, Jerry Potts, a mixed-blood Peigan Indian who served as a scout and interpreter for the NWMP in the late 1800s, indicated that much of the rock art at Writing-On-Stone was war records made by Blackfoot Indians going to and fro on the warpath (MacLean 1894:118). This might demon strate that the petroglyphs were not the main rea son for using the trail, but were placed there only afterwards. The fact noted by Steele (1888) that at Writing-On-Stone the river was easily fordable even during difficult conditions, which prompted even non-Native groups (i.e., smugglers and NWMP) to use it as a crossing point, indicates that the Writ ing-On-Stone trail was probably chosen for practi cal, objective reasons. In summary, Writing-On-Stone undoubtedly attracted much traffic and attention because of: 1) the nearby presence of the Sweetgrass Hills; 2) its location in prime buffalo hunting grounds; 3) the presence of an established trail passing through it; and 4) its providing an excellent ford. As such, Writing-On-Stone was probably an area through which many groups passed on military and other undesired (e.g., poaching) forays into Blackfoot 34</page><page sequence="9">Luc Bouchet-Bert A Reinterpretation of Writing-on-Stone \ ( j ^orthSasK* Rock Art Sites^^\ ^^^^^ All 4 Madden EiPn-1 C In Alberta &lt;v \ \__/ y\ y^^~~^*^&gt;\ * Artrie Era110 EhPI-2 \^ I -^\^Cochrane Ranch (2) (^^^J^^^ NCJkotoki Erratic EePm-^ j^^?--^^^^^^ ^-[ /* I * *l\V\\\\ \^^V ZephyTCr^EcPp-1-Vk*-7 V*ll?m?

This lends feasibility to the idea that the Blackfoot chose Writing-On-Stone to display their aggressiveness and war-like nature to intimidate the enemy and try to deter any raiding parties from entering Blackfoot territory at that point. SUBJECT MATTER Klassen (1995:194) notes that unusual land scape features have traditionally held much spiri tual significance in Northwestern Plains cultures. He believes that Writing-On-Stone was chosen as a rock art site because it was an unusual landscape feature and so constituted part of Blackfoot sacred geography. He remarks that pictographs are found on at least four large erratic boulders in southern Alberta, "...again suggesting that these unusual landscape features served a ritual or ceremonial purpose in much the same way as medicine rocks" (Klassen 1995:194). A problem with this view, how ever, is if Writing-On-Stone and other unusual land scape features were chosen to display rock art for the same (spiritual) reasons, then one would per haps expect to find an underlying or unifying theme of similar motifs occurring between these sites. A brief comparative analysis shows that the art at Writing-On-Stone is in fact much different in terms of style and content from that at other rock art sites in Alberta, sacred or not. Besides containing the most rock art found in any one location on the northwestern Plains, Writ ing-On-Stone contains the most violent imagery. Clearly it is warrior art, as the numerous combat, battle, and other scenes depicting acts of bravery (horse stealing, coup counting) attest. As Bryan (1991:137) notes, most of these images denote a strong sense of machismo. Combat scenes involving two warriors are very common (although these similarly exist at other rock art sites on the Northwestern Plains). More significantly, at Writing-On-Stone five battle scenes are also de picted. What is striking about this is that only one other battle scene has been recorded in northwest 35</page><page sequence="10">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 44, No. 167,1999 Panel 1 ' ^ \WMHl I/// Panel 2 ^^^^ Figure 4. Williams Coulee (sketched by M. Turney). ern Plains art, at Castle Butte in south-central Mon tana (Connor and Connor 1971:21-22). As noted above, many of the anthropomor phs depicted at Writing-On-Stone are involved in action scenes, mostly combat and battle scenes, or some other activity associated with bravery and status, such as horse-raiding. Weapons are dis played prominently (many are enlarged) with many of the anthropomorphs at Writing-On-Stone. These include bows, arrows, bow-spears, spears, lances, clubs, hatchets, guns, a sword, and shields. Iso lated bows and arrows are depicted at several sites, as are two hatchets, several guns, and shields (Key ser 1977a: 147-151), which probably represent "tal lies" of objects acquired through raids and battles and thus represent war honors or coups (Klassen 1995:160). The depiction of isolated, riderless horses or herds of horses might also be viewed as an attempt to boast of power. In addition to per haps representing tallies of these ani mals acquired during raids, which there fore represent war honors or coups (Klassen 1995:162), the horse in Black foot culture carried powerful connota tions. It was a general belief among the Blackfoot, for example,, that horses pos sessed supernatural powers, repre sented economic security and prestige, and, when captured, counted as war honors (Ewers 1955:290). Also, when reading Saukamappee's account of the effectiveness of horses used in battle (see Glover 1962:242), it is obvious that owning horses conferred a great mili tary advantage. Thus, all these motifs are "deterrent"; in other words, these could have been used to display art ists' power. When one compares this warrior theme art at Writing-On-Stone to the rock art imagery at other sites on the Alberta plains also within the territory of the Blackfoot (Figure 3), a most in triguing observation results. This is that the latter art displays almost no warfare scenes. The lone exception seems to be the first panel at Williams Coulee, where one might argue for the presence of a warfare scene involving shield-bear ing warriors (Figure 4). However, the Nanton, Zephyr Creek (Figure 5), and famous Okotoks Er ratic (Figure 6) rock art scenes are purely non-mili tary, probably relating to vision quest or some other unknown symbolism (Leechman et al. 1955). This same pattern may also be observed at the other rock art sites in Alberta (Habgood 1967). For ex ample, at Pekisko (Mystic) Cave we find symbolic abstract designs and a buffalo (Figure 7), and at Painted Canyon on Zephyr Creek we see a single unarmed anthropomorph along with an animal, a thunderbird, and an abstract design (Figure 8). The 25 Ranch art shows two unarmed anthropomor phs, one of which is associated with a thunderbird (Figure 9). Like the Okotoks Erratic, the Airdrie and Split Rock erratics contain series of tally marks, crosses, bird tracks, and unidentified designs (Habgood 1967:12). At the King's Buffalo Jump 36</page><page sequence="11">Luc Bouchet-Bert A Reinterpretation of Writing-on-Stone &gt; in/" Figure 5. Zephyr Creek pictographs, (from Leechman et al. 1955:Figure 4). are three unarmed shield figures associated with a plant-like symbol (Figure 10), while at the Nanton Jump are some ill-defined red smears (Turney 1998). Head-Smashed-In contains some astronomical de signs (Bryan 1991:153), as does the Carmangay glyphstone (Stavely and District Museum, n.d.). The Stevens Rock and Monarch glyphstones con tain circles, dots, and abstract figures (Archaeo logical Society of Alberta 1980:172-173), while at Carstairs are what appear to be "...parts of maps or messages since they bear crosses, circles, semi circles, and buffalo tracks. There is a series of tally marks, a cross-shaped design with the arms bent upwards at a 45 degree angle, parallel straight lines, and other indistinct designs" (Habgood 1967:13). The Madden and Cochrane Ranch sites contain unarmed shield figures (Turney 1998), and at Pine Coulee (Figure 11), a few simple, unarmed shield figures exist among what has previously been in terpreted as religious symbolism (Leechman et al. 1955) In short, with the possible exception of Will iams Coulee, none of these sites contain the war fare themes present at Writing-On-Stone. Without exception, no other site contains any historic war fare scenes like those at Writing-On-Stone. If Writ ing-On-Stone and other "unusual landscape fea ture" sacred sites were chosen to display rock art for the same (spiritual) reasons, why do they ex hibit extreme differences in motif? This seems to indicate that Writing-On-Stone served an entirely different function, at least in historic times, from that of the sacred rock art sites. Not only does Writing-On-Stone contain an inordinate amount of warfare-related art, but this location was chosen above others to display it. Simply explaining this as the recording of personal accomplishments in a place where one could impress the supernatural (Keyser 1977a: 174-175) is not sufficient, for if this were the case the same motifs should be present at other locations considered sacred by the Black foot, such as the Big Rock, Airdrie, and Split Rock erratics. This is not the case. As such, a different interpretation of the function of Writing-On-Stone as a rock art site must be postulated. Unlike Dempsey (1973), Keyser (1977a), Klassen (1995), and especially Barry (1991), I believe that these military motifs were grouped en masse specifically at Writing-On-Stone not for spiritual reasons or to impress the supernatural, but because here they could impress the enemy. The reasons this particu lar location was chosen to display the art for this purpose have been discussed above. THE FUNCTION OF THE MILITARY MOTIFS AT WRITING-ON-STONE Klassen recognizes that hide art and much of the Writing-On-Stone historic art are similarly nar rative, but fails to realize the full significance of this observation in his interpretation of the historic Writing-On-Stone art. In advancing his interpreta tion of the Writing-On-Stone art as spiritually moti vated, Klassen (1995:191) ignores the known secu lar function that narrative art played in Plains soci eties in the early to mid-19th century. Instead he favors modern oral traditions that assign unequivo cal spiritual meaning to it. While on the one hand acknowledging that "...widespread formal similari ties between hide paintings and post-contact rock art clearly result in a strong fit between the source of the analogical inference and the subject of the interpretation...strongly suggesting that the 'cul tural mechanism' which structured hide painting imagery also structured post-contact rock art" 37</page><page sequence="12">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 44, No. 167,1999 * i ...... ^ Face 1 i-, 1-1 i-1 J I [Faces ^| ^ ^ 1 I-7"-! " * ! ^ w &gt;ft Face 4 I_ Face6 |_| Figure 6. Okotoks Erratic or Big Rock (courtesy of M. Turney, after Selwyn Dewdney 1963). (Klassen 1995:146), he concludes on the other that "...while there may have been a shift during the equestrian period towards an increased historicality and narrativity in the rock art of Writing-On-Stone, an underlying continuity allied even the most nar rative of scenes to an overarching cosmic concep tion of the world" (Klassen 1995:191). Klassen (1995:191) justifies this position by noting that in Plains societies "...horses, wealth status and war honors are all wrapped up in conceptions of medi cine powers derived from the spirit world;" hence the conspicuous display of these motifs in post contact Writing-On-Stone art is argued to be pri marily spiritual. While Klassen (1995) and Dempsey (1973) rely on modern oral traditions to conclude that Writing On-Stone art had primarily spiritual meaning, other ethnographic data instead clearly associate this type of art with more secular func tions. It has long been recognized that much if not all of the war record imagery at Writing-On Stone has striking parallels to simi lar motifs and scenes painted on hides and shirts used to chronicle the battle honors and heroic deeds of the owner (Keyser 1977a: 174). Because of the extreme similarity in style and content between the historic rock art at Writing-On Stone and contemporary hide art (Figure 12, compare to Figure 2), it is reasonable to infer that they shared much the same function (Keyser 1996). It was the same art tradition, just extended to differ ent media. And what was the func tion of these motifs on hides? When George Catlin visited the Mandans in 1832, he noted that men wore hides or owned lodge covers and tipi liners filled with battle representations in order to claim war honors. During his visit the Mandan chief Four Bears gave him a painted robe covered with scenes of Four Bears's brave accomplishments. Of these depic tions, Catlin observed: "...in this country, where, of all countries I ever was in, men are the most jealous of rank and of standing; and in a community so small also that every man's deeds of honour and chiv alry are familiarly known to all; it would not be reputable, or even safe to life, for a warrior to wear upon his back the representations of battles he never had fought; professing to have done what every child in the village would know he never had done" (Catlin 1973 [1844] 1:148; as quoted in Szabo 1993:2) E.T. Denig, who entered the fur-trade among the tribes of the Upper Missouri in 1833, corrobo rates Catlin's views. He mentions that robe draw ings were of much importance among the Natives because they served to exhibit a warrior's standing when displayed in public. Their function, quite simply, was "...to impress upon his own people or strangers the idea of his being brave, of his having 38</page><page sequence="13">Luc Bouchet-Bert A Reinterpretation of Writing-on-Stone done acts that entitle him to appear among men, of his su periority in this respect over others in the crowd..." (Denig 1928-29 [1854]:605). Like wise, McClintock (1936:176), in describing his visit to a Blackfoot circle camp in 1896, informs us that "the record ing of brave deeds in war was chiefly in picture-writing, generally upon robes, the in ner and outer walls of tipis, and sometimes on war-shirts and leggings. But the con ventional place, and the place where they attracted the most attention in the camp, was upon the cover of a tipi." From these accounts is it obvious that what has been described as biographic (Keyser 1977a; 1977b) or narrative (Klassen 1995) art served a definite function: that of allowing who ever drew it to boast of his accomplishments in order to elevate his status as a warrior and demon strate his superiority over others. This known meaning and function of narrative art is highly sig nificant for our interpretation of Writing-On-Stone, where these motifs dominate the post-contact art (Klassen 1995:184). In Klassen's (1995:146) own words, I prefer to believe that based on the "...for T'&amp;r ft Figure 8. Painted Canyon (Zephyr Creek) art, (Habgood 1967:Figure 32). - [N-^* ^ O' ... ~ . Figure 7. Pekisko or Mystic Cave, (traced from color slide by M. Turney, 1993). mal similarities between hide painting and post contact rock art...[,] the 'cultural mechanism' which structured hide painting imagery also structured post-contact rock art." In other words, war art, whether on a tipi or a hide or at Writing-On-Stone, served to bolster the warrior's self image, to in crease his status, and to boast of his superiority to others. What is also significant for this theory is that ethnographic accounts state that war art was created with the definite intention of display: the more conspicuous the location (such as a tipi cover) the better. This art was meant to be seen, for it carried a definite message. This intention fits Writ ing-On-Stone. At the outset it does not make much sense that a warrior would leave his narrative art on a rock face that, unlike his shirt or his tipi cover, he could not carry with him in order to actively dis play to his peers. This is probably why other rock art sites in Alberta demonstrate a lack of warfare art. However, because Writing-On-Stone was lo cated in an area that was likely a focal point of human activity and presence, warrior art was dis played there where its creators knew it would have an audience. Hence Blackfoot warriors took ad vantage of Writing-On-Stone to advertise their strength and superiority to their enemies, much as 39</page><page sequence="14">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 44, No. 167,1999 if.. _t Figure 9. 25 Ranch art (Habgood 1967:Figure 34). they used war art on their shirts to increase their status among their own people. This means that the horses, battles, coups, and raids depicted are not so much "...wrapped up in conceptions of medi cine powers derived from the spirit world" (Klas sen 1995:191), but are rather for the warrior "...to impress upon his own people or strangers the idea of his being brave, of his having done acts that entitle him to appear among men, of his superiority in this respect over others in the crowd..." (Denig 1928-29 [ 1854] :605, emphasis added). THE DISPLAY FACTOR Another interesting point about the art itself has to do with its orientation. Unlike the Big Rock, Ranch, 25 Ranch, and Table Butte rock art sites, for example, where the art is somewhat hidden under ledges, caves, or in deep crevices (Leechman et al. 1955; Habgood 1967:12), at Writing-On-Stone "the Indians made no attempt to paint or incise rock art on most of the numerous hidden surfaces provided by the hoodoo fields and secondary sandstone cliffs" (Keyser 1977a:20). Klassen (1995:196) states that only 20% of the art is in hoodoos, isolated outcrops, or small alcoves, where it is hidden from immediate view. He also observes that 75% of the panels face south. While Klassen (1995:197), in keeping with his religious interpretation of Writ (5) a, Figure 10. King's Buffalo Jump art (Habgood 1967:Fig ure 37). ing-On-Stone, proposes "...the orientations of the panels seem consistent with ceremonial or ritual activities relating to the passage of the sun...", or that the art was purposely oriented toward the Sweetgrass Hills, an alternate explanation might be that this message-laden art was purposefully ori ented toward the direction from which raiders would have come, heading north into Blackfoot territory. If one is to mark one's boundary with motifs that serve to increase one's status in the face of the enemy, the art must be placed so as to be obvious and noticeable to the enemy. This is, indeed, the pattern at Writing-On-Stone. Also relevant to the display factor is the vis ibility of the art. One possible disadvantage to my theory is that unless one looks closely, one prob ably will not see the art at Writing-On-Stone. This puts into question its propaganda value. Granted, this art is not monumental, but to believe this means that Natives would not have noticed it is introduc ing Eurocentric bias into the equation. For a people who depended on their observational skills and attention to detail to survive, it is highly unlikely that the petroglyphs and pictographs at Writing On-Stone would have escaped attention, particu larly if Natives were familiar with or had to pass right through the area on their journey. 40</page><page sequence="15">Luc Bouchet-Bert A Reinterpretation of Writing-on-Stone H Figure 11. Pine Coulee Pictographs. (Leechman et al. 1955:Figs. la and lb). THE WRITING-ON-STONE ART AND ITS CREATORS Writing-On-Stone was located in the overlap ping ranges of many different tribes. Klassen (1995:103) believes this implies all of these groups may have been responsible for creating the rock art. Instead, it may have been for this very reason that Blackfoot artists alone may have chosen Writ ing-On-Stone as the perfect location to display their deterrent art. Could the Blackfoot alone have been respon sible for all the art at Writing-On-Stone? While in the end this remains a moot question, there is none theless the potential that this was the case. Magne and Klassen (1991:416) state that a single culture may have created all the art, considering the stylis tic continuity from the prehistoric to the historic period. Since the Blackfoot are known to have been in control of southern Alberta in the historic period (Magne et al. 1986; Wissler 1910), they certainly are strong candidates for this position. Indeed, as they are known to have been using body shields in late prehistoric times, there is no reason to believe they could not have created the prehistoric as well as the historic art (Magne and Klassen 1991.415). Other evidence that might exclusively link the Black foot to Writing-On-Stone are the numerous Black foot tales that associate their warriors with Writ ing-On-Stone (see Dempsey 1973:26ff), and Jerry Potts' nineteenth-century explanation that the Writ ing-On-Stone art was made by Peigan and Blood warriors (MacLean 1894). Finally, Klassen (1995:145 146) mentions that "...substantial formal similari ties between Blackfoot hide paintings and the rock art are clearly evident...." Com bined, this evidence supports the notion that the Blackfoot were uniquely respon sible for creating the art at Writing-On Stone, which in turn might strengthen the deterrent art theory. THE USE OF ART TO MARK BOUNDARIES ON THE NORTH WESTERN PLAINS It is relevant to note that the use of biographic art to intimidate enemies indeed has precedence on the Plains. Ethnographic accounts state that groups used art to de ter enemy attack, in exactly the same manner that I propose Writing-On-Stone served. For example, the Mandan and Hidatsa also possessed a biographic or narrative art tradition, in which war deeds were depicted. Porsche and Loendorf (1987:60), in seek ing evidence that these tribes painted biographic art on stationary and not just portable (hides, tipi covers) objects, mention some "painted woods" along a part of the Missouri river in North Dakota near Washburn, where they note that "war-deed" images were painted on trees. (There are few rock surfaces in North Dakota suitable for drawing on). What is relevant here is the fact that this was an area that "historical descriptions...suggest...was a buffer zone between the Mandan or Hidatsa vil lages and the nomadic Sioux who were a constant threat to the villagers in the middle of the 1800s" (Porsche and Loendorf 1987:60, emphasis added). Of particular interest is the reason given for this art being depicted at this particular location. Joseph Henry Taylor (Taylor 1897:130; quoted in Porsche and Loendorf 1987:60), relates a story told by a Mandan chief when he lived among them: They [Sioux] painted up before onslaught, and in mere bravado counted their "coup" with artistic flourish in character upon the whitened body of the...tree. We [Mandan] in turn retali ated in kind, and carried the hieroglyphic art to a bunch of great cottonwoods that stood nearby..." This provides clear ethnohistoric evidence that Plains biographic art was in fact sometimes used to mark boundaries and intimidate enemies. As with Writing-On-Stone, the Mandan/Hidatsa painted 41</page><page sequence="16">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 44, No. 167,1999 y^&lt;...-^-^/Y" / / ^ ( Figure 12. War record or narrative art hide painting, Blackfoot, pre-1898. Note similarity to art in Figure 2 (Klassen 1995:Figure 5.2). woods site was a boundary zone between mutually hostile tribes, and here biographic art was clearly intended as a show of force in the face of the en emy. This affirms that biographic art did not merely tell a story, but in some cases told a story with the definite purpose of elevating its creator's status so as to intimidate his enemies. Further references to art as a means of inter tribal communication include Daniel Wildman (in Barbeau 1960:69), who relates a story of a group of Stonies looking for their horses, which had been stolen by the Blackfoot. Their medicine man warns them not to go to the area of Phaben-wabish, or Paint-on-the-Rock. He goes on to explain that "on this rock the enemies used to paint signs in the earlier days. Whoever passed there could tell whether Bloods or Blackfeet had been there re cently." Likewise, McGee (1893-94:169) notes that Jonathan Carver, who travelled through the Plains in the 1760s, "gives an example of picture-writing on a tree, in charcoal mixed with bear's grease, de signed to convey information from the 'Chipe'ways' (Algonquian) to the 'Naudowessies,' and other instances of intertribal communication by means of pictography are on record." The Chippewas and the Sioux were, of course, rancor ous enemies. BOUNDARIES AND HUNTER-GATHERER SOCIETIES Numerous studies on hunter-gatherers have shown that within these societies territoriality is a basic concept. Hunter-gatherers use two methods to control access to territorial resources (Cashdan 1983). The first, perimeter defense, occurs in cases of overt competition between groups. Here forag 42</page><page sequence="17">Luc Bouchet-Bert A Reinterpretation of Writing-on-Stone ers adopt the strategy of marking the boundaries of their territory and controlling access to it. Perim eter defense, understandably, tends to occur only in groups that occupy small territories (300 square miles or less) (Cashdan 1983:49). The second strat egy, used by groups occupying large territories, is social boundary defense, where the boundaries of the social group rather than the perimeters of the territory itself are defended. Peterson (1975) has observed this type of territorial defense in the greet ing ceremonies of the Australian aborigines. This is an advantageous strategy for these types of groups because: Where territories are large and resources un predictable, outsiders can minimize their forag ing costs considerably if they obtain informa tion from the residents concerning the location of resources. They therefore have an incentive to seek access to the social group, since it is through the social interactions of these rituals that information exchange takes place....we can expect that the costs of not cooperating in ask ing permission will rise with territory size, since the more unpredictable the resources and the larger the territory, the more difficult it will be for outsiders to exploit the area unaided. (Cashdan 1983:50). While this may be true in general, in the case of the northwestern Plains, social boundary de fense was probably not feasible. For instance, the territorial hunting-ground claims of the Blackfoot were in perennial dispute, as many other tribes (such as the Kootenay and Flathead) thought it their an cestral right to hunt buffalo on the Plains (Barbeau 1960:12). A consequence of this is that a major cause of warfare was one tribe using the hunting territories of another (Griswold 1970:68). Indeed, the Blackfoot were constantly fighting roving bands of poachers, and feuds caused by these ter ritorial encroachments lasted for centuries (Barbeau 1960:12). As such, one could probably imagine what would happen to the hapless Snake Indian who approached a Blackfoot camp to ask where the nearest buffalo was (!). More importantly, the two strategies outlined above and the conditions of their application may alter completely in cases in which colonial impact has affected hunter-gatherer life-styles (Peterson 1975 ; Cashdan 1983). Because of direct or indirect European influences on Plains Indian lifeways in the historic period, concepts of traditional hunter gatherer territoriality probably cannot apply here. In this case, the introduction of the horse and gun is known to have greatly increased intertribal war fare, which conceivably could have led to the need to adopt some sort of perimeter defense strategy, even where large territories were concerned. In stead of protecting resources, this new emphasis on warfare might have led Natives to place an em phasis on protecting themselves. This is what led to the use of Writing-On-Stone as a perimeter-de fense area. CONCLUSIONS Contrary to the exclusively religious or spiri tual function previously assigned to the Writing On-Stone art, the historic narrative or biographic art found there probably was originally intended to serve the very secular function of elevating the status and marking the superiority of its creators, much as similar art on buffalo robes, shirts, and tipi covers functioned. As warrior art was created with the definite intention of being seen, the presence of this art at Writing-On-Stone argues for the pres ence of an audience. This agrees with the theory that Writing-On-Stone served as a Blackfoot bound ary marker that sought to intimidate the enemy and discourage trespass. Several elements factor into the feasibility of this theory. Historic accounts confirm that several mutually-hostile ethnic groups occupied the south ern Alberta region, and that the Blackfoot were ap prehensive about their enemies. Writing-On-Stone was located in a sort of boundary zone at the gen eral periphery of Blackfoot territory. The Writing On-Stone art may have been made by a single cul ture (that of the Blackfoot). It contains many threat ening motifs which, in addition to being in open view for all to see, face potential enemies as if guard ing the territory. Because of the Sweetgrass Hills, Writing-On-Stone was an area likely to be heavily frequented by many different tribes, and was un doubtedly the area through which these tribes en tered Blackfoot territory on military raids and hunt ing excursions. This is because an excellent fording spot was located there, as well as an established north-south trail. As such, the need and desire for the Blackfoot to advertise their strength and supe riority at this particular location is understandable. While the need to do this may not have been so 43</page><page sequence="18">PLAINS ANTHROPOLOGIST Vol. 44, No. 167,1999 pressing in the prehistoric era, it certainly could have existed in the historic era, when the introduc tion of the horse and gun greatly increased inter tribal violence and conflict. The sheer increase in the art at Writing-On-Stone during the historic pe riod may be explained by this intensification of war fare, which led to an increased need for Blackfoot warriors to display their military propaganda. As the use of warrior art by Plains groups to delineate territories and to impress their enemies is demonstrated in the ethnohistoric record, Writing On-Stone was not necessarily a place where people went to "record activities grounded in reality" to impress the supernatural or to reflect cosmic views of the world, but rather to mark a boundary and impress the enemy. This study does not attempt to explain every scratch and drawing at Writing-On-Stone. No single interpretation could be so encompassing. It is highly likely, for example, that some of the art is in fact vision-quest art, especially those (undated) zoomorphs that are depicted with lifelines (McClintock 1936; Brasseur 1978). It does, how ever, offer a reasonable explanation for why Writ ing-On-Stone was chosen to display art, why it contains the art that it does, and why it is so differ ent from other rock art sites within Blackfoot terri tory. These conclusions are given their strength through the consideration of the entire social, po litical, and environmental context of the art at Writ ing-On-Stone. NOTES 1. While Keyser (1977a: 174-175) originally stated that this art's function was to impress only the "supernatu ral," in a different publication he does briefly touch upon my point that it was meant to impress more worldly agents: "Since a Plains Indian's status as a warrior rested on his personal accomplishments (coups), which were regularly reaccounted at fraternal gatherings and depicted on his personal equipment..., Writing-On-Stone would have pro vided a place where these deeds could be recorded to im press both other tribesmen and also the supernatural" (Key ser 1977b:53, emphasis added). ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Considering how different this interpretation of Writ ing-On-Stone is from the ones that have been proposed up to recently, support and interest from people with whom I have discussed this idea or who have read earlier drafts of this paper have provided me with the courage to publish. In this regard, I would like to thank Dr. Martin Magne, Dr. Brian Reeves, Dr. Nicolas David, Brian Vivian, Dan Meyer, and Michael Turney. I am especially grateful for the sup port of Dr. Magne, who gave me full access to his library, and Michael Turney, who shared his extensive knowledge of unpublished Alberta rock art with me and provided many of the figures in this article. Gratitude must also be ex tended to Dr. Linea Sundstrom, who provided some of the ethnographic references used. I would like to dedicate this paper to professor J.D. Lewis-Williams, whose rock art research I have continuously found most exciting, and in spirational.
