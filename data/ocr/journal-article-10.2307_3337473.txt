Its statistics are staggering: 34 volumes, over 6,700 authors, more than 40,000 separate articles on almost every imaginable topic in the history of world art, 15,000 illustra- tions, an index volume with 770,000 en- tries, and more than 300,000 bibliographic citations. Fifteen years of preparation by thousands of scholars have resulted in a truly monumental reference work that is actually much more than that. How does Africa fare? Very well, for the most part, although I shall raise some quibbles as I attempt briefly to assess the scope and nature of The Dictionary's treat- ment of that continent, its wonderfully varied arts, its artists, and the problems and issues we face in learning about art in Africa toward the end of the millenni- um. Clearly the planners of this enor- mous enterprise made good on their intention to be inclusive, to serve world arts and not just those of the Western world. The list of "Peoples and Places" makes clear its breadth of coverage be- yond mainstream Mediterranean and European areas and cultures. The 398,000 words on Africa (not including Egypt) make this work more voluminous by far than any single book or series of books on the subject in exis- tence. Of course, the hundreds of entries on Africa are not all grouped together in a single volume-despite the hopes of many of us: as in other dictionaries (or encyclopedias), the entries are alphabeti- cal, so the article on the Akan is found in volume 1, that on Zulu in volume 33. There is, however, one very substantial, more or less unified section on "Africa" that runs to 227 pages. In addition about 350 other pages of The Dictionary encom- pass entries on 65 ethnic groups and 47 African countries, approximately 20 sites or cities (e.g., Timbuktu, Pretoria, Great Zimbabwe), and some 65 artists, archi- tects, and potters (more on this below). Obviously-adding up these entries (197)-a great many of them run to sev- eral pages; that is especially true of those on individual African countries and eth- nic groups. Moreover, sections on Africa also appear in essays on at least these other topics: caricature, color, doors, dye, ethnographic photography, terracotta, wood, textiles, and military architecture. The Dictionary is relatively easy to han- dle and use, particularly compared with the heavier, more cumbersome volumes of the McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of World Art (published in 1958 in 14 volumes, with a 1-volume index and 2 supple- ments). Both indexing and cross-refer- encing are extensive and apparently thorough. Volume 34 is given over entire- ly to indexing 770,000 subjects. Cross- referenced words (topics, areas, artists, peoples, etc.) are distinguished by a spe- cial typeface. The type size throughout is small but legible, and the mass of print is broken on nearly every page by the in- clusion of a black and white illustration. Most volumes have a small color section; about six African pieces are in color. Only a fraction of the specific works or types of art or architecture mentioned are illus- trated, probably fewer than one in ten or fifteen, at a guess. With so little space allotted to pictures, the selections are 58african arts* winter 1997 58 afrlcan arts - winter 1997</page><page sequence="2">Counterclockwise from top: The 34-volume set.

It is al- most as if illustrations were added as much for visual relief as for information. Some will criticize the overall numbers of illustrations as incommensurate with text volume and completeness of cover- age, as they clearly are. But as this was certainly an editorial decision, and no doubt one hinging in good measure on costs, it is not fair to harp on this dispari- ty. After all-speaking of money-Grove has laid out an investment of something on the order of $50 million, which may be difficult for the publishers to recoup, even over several years. Few individuals of my acquaintance will want to purchase the entire 34-volume set, which retails now for $8,800. The Africa Section The long section under the heading "Africa" contains dozens of contiguous essays on a host of aspects of our subject. It covers a total of some 227 double- columned pages (vol. 1, pp. 213-440), more text than virtually any extant vol- ume on the arts of the continent. The african arts - winter 1997 59 `;I</page><page sequence="3">entries were written by 55 women and men, the latter slightly outnumbering the former. Most authors are Americans; ten are British, with a smattering of other nationalities represented, very few of them African. The section excludes Egypt (given separate space roughly equal to that for the rest of the continent), but includes aspects of North and Southern Africa, thus adopting a (nearly) continen- tal framework that appears to be becom- ing a trend. Such an inclusive view was featured in the Royal Academy exhibition and book, Africa: The Art of a Continent (1995), and is being followed in the book sanctioned by the Arts Council of the African Studies Association that is now being written by Monica Visona, Robin 60 Poynor, and others. No effort is made in The Dictionary, however, to show any overall unity of art forms or functions or history for this vast continent, nor is there much discussion of how the arts of some of these regions-the Magreb, for exam- ple-might tie in with those south of the Sahara. Yet the more global view at least opens up the possibility of seeing larger historical connections than those normally proposed in books or exhibitions stressing West and Central Africa and excluding most of the north, south, and east. I will briefly outline the "Africa" section, using the same Roman numerals it employs as titles of its fifteen far from equal major divisions. (Parts I-VII occupy 207 pages, while VIII-XV take up only about 20.) Part I: Introduction. The introduction (P. Richards, about 18 pp.) addresses physical geography, climate, flora, fauna, and min- erals and their relationship to the arts. A short section on ethnic groups and lan- guages precedes a longer one on history, Above left: Segment of carved ivory horn, sur- mounted by a king on horseback.

The first outlines human origins but stresses the introductions of agricul- ture and metallurgy, as well as settlement patterns during the first millennium A.D., when centralized societies began to devel- op and Arab speakers crossed the Sahara. The second period, ca. A.D. 600-1885, be- gins with an appropriate caveat of the sort repeated in varied form elsewhere in The Dictionary, but not any too often: "The diversity of societies, languages, and cul- tures is far too great to support generaliza- tions about artistic and cultural trends" (p. 223). A few pages are given to West African urbanism and trade, then Western Bantu and Eastern Bantu traditions. This is of course broad-brush history, and it does get more detailed in later pages. Indeed, the emphasis given history by many authors is as refreshing as it is overdue in our field. The final introductory subject is religion, with about a page each (about 1,000 words if there is no illustration) given to indige- nous religions, Islam, Christianity, and modern developments. The introduction includes a detailed table of contents em- bracing the entire 227 pages, as well as ten bibliographies, most short. In all about 80 bibliographies are dis- tributed across this section on Africa, most with at least a dozen entries. We would perhaps not expect them to be consistent in length or coverage, and they are not; nor is any one nearly exhaustive. Indeed, nothing in this quite wonderful reference work is exhaustive, nor was it the editors' intention to have it be. Breadth, rather, seems to have been a major watchword, along with history and inclusiveness. The word overview could be applied to nearly every article (at least those on Africa) in this work. That said, a fair amount of original thinking on African art is pub- lished here for the first time. I estimate that twice as much has been written on African arts since 1966 than appeared before it. The Dictionary has drawn exten- sively upon this body of work and its 150- plus specialist authors, doubtless because this is the first time African arts have been seriously embraced in a single project on the history of world art by people, such as the editors of this work, who are not spe- cialists in the field. Part II: Art and Aesthetics. This section addresses two main subjects: approaches to the study of the arts, and aesthetic eval- uation. The article on "critical and schol- arly approaches" (P.L. Ravenhill) is a historiographic review of varied ways the forms and meanings of figural sculpture have been assessed. I found this essay illuminating. In fairly short compass it touches on many mistaken views of sculpture and erroneous constructions of African thought. Some of these are still very much at large, stalking campuses and coloring the minds of those who col- lect and otherwise deal with (and in) art. Essentialist and narrow approaches to style are outlined and the relationship between cultural style and individual creativity is queried-without an answer being supplied. The article goes on to examine elucidations of meanings as re- vealed by-sometimes rather incom- plete-studies of context. It looks at formalist "appreciations," those contextu- ally based and those not, both orders of which are sometimes visualized as tran- scendent of time, place, and circum- stances of manufacture. This essay leads logically into the sec- ond, aesthetic evaluation (H.J. Drewal) based primarily on indigenous systems of thought, though outside evaluations (e.g., by Ratzel, Picasso, and Alain Locke) are briefly assessed. It also examines the be- lief in cross-cultural, even pan-African, aesthetic criteria. The bulk of the article is given first to a brief, sweeping survey, then to case studies of Akan and Yoruba aesthetic systems; all feature ideas and evaluations by African makers and users of the arts, though as reported by out- siders. This essay is a concise synthesis of the work of many. I especially welcome its effort to move beyond sculpture alone to performance, body arts, and even nomads' responses to their beloved cattle. Part III: Contexts of Production and Use. This section boasts many subheadings: patronage, artists, trade, commercial pro- duction (tourist arts), and ritual. The roles and status of various types of patrons and artists are considered, along with their african arts . winter 1997 61 61 african arts - winter 1997</page><page sequence="5">COURTESY OF GROVE'S DICTIONARIES INC. relationships in leadership and cult-specif- ic contexts and how both economics and change may be affected in the commis- sioning of works of art. I found the entries on patronage (. Perani and N.H. Wolff) and artists (J. Picton) rather brief, if well handled as far as they went. An essay (M. Adams) on artists' division of labor ac- cording to gender is one of several articles that would not have appeared had this dictionary been published ten or twelve years ago. It mentions prevailing gender- specific technologies and materials as well as many exceptions, the latter useful cor- rectives on stereotypes. The essays on patronage and artists, on the other hand, both feature a distinction between "tradi- tional" and "modern developments." Such simplistic dichotomous classifica- tions (which also appear in some of the other African articles) ignore the more ac- curate but less facile model: a continuum of incremental and varying patterns of 62 change that often differ according to locale and medium, even within a single country. The next essay (M. Johnson) is on the external and local trade in goods and tech- nologies, followed by a shorter piece on traders as intermediaries (J. Perani and N.H. Wolff), patrons, and consumers. The next section (D. Crowley), on commercial production for outsiders, incudes three case studies: Chokwe, Kamba, and Ma- konde. As this is the main essay on tourist arts in The Dictionary, its brevity and nar- row focus are regrettable. It is a shame that the editors and consultants did not an- ticipate, ten or even five years ago, the burgeoning reality of African art as an international commodity. The final section, on ritual, outlines the use of body arts, masquerades, and other forms in puberty rites (M.J. Arnoldi), and is followed by an essay on sculpture and display in funerary contexts (C. Geary). These are useful if compressed accounts that mention varied situations among many ethnic groups. Both authors provide helpful conceptual introductions to the roles of arts before dis- cussing specific rituals and peoples, again in a case-study format. Part IV: Imagery and Iconography. This 24-page section opens with an entry on symbolism and ritual (F. Lamp), which begins with a general statement: "The overall purpose of African ritual is to promote increase; that is, to stimulate (for example) the fecundity of mothers, the potency of fathers, the fertility of domesticated animals and of the land, spiritually guided sharpness of mind, physical dexterity in both earthly and spiritual contexts, social harmony in the community and good leadership" (p. 260). The qualifiers (after "of the land") do not quite redeem the initial statement, which is uncharacteristically broad for this dictionary. Indeed, the author goes on to detail many examples of sexual and birth symbolism to support his case about increase, but for me this essay edges into over-interpretation, especially since he does not talk about symbolism that fosters (for example) "sharpness of mind" or "good leadership." The next entry (S.P. Blier), on gesture, divides the subject into gestures convey- ing religious themes, social roles, and emotional expression. While also inter- pretive in some instances, its only over- arching statements are that gesture is important, conventional, and culturally specific. An essay on portraiture (.M. Borgatti) follows; this is a dense and use- ful distillation of its author's earlier study--another recurrent feature of many entries-along with some additional ideas. Many authors appear to have rethought their subjects specifically for the compressed format of this publication; their essays are more readable than they african arts - winter 1997</page><page sequence="6">would be if the longer studies had simply been excerpted or rewritten in precis form. The bibliography on portraiture, with 47 entries, is especially long and thus more useful to specialists than the more usual abbreviated ones. The following en- try (S.P. Blier) on the symbolism of physi- cal anomalies in African art, on the other hand, seems to have been conceived en- tirely for this dictionary. This essay offers a fresh approach to a new subject that draws on many specific examples of mul- tifaced, exaggerated, aberrant images and those figures with extra, missing or un- developed features or limbs from cultures as distant from each other as the Rotse, Fon, Mbuti, and Dogon. The next edition of this work, however, could well include an entry on Janus or multiheaded images, for these are not given the space they deserve here. The next three entries, on mother and child, animal, and equestrian imagery (by the present author), I shall pass by without comment except to say that the essay on animal symbolism is about half the length of the original submission. I must admit, however, that I was given the opportunity to emend proofs of the article, but failed to do so out of laziness and distance from the subject when the proofs arrived. This is to say, The Diction- ary was thoroughly professional with authors, but the latter did not necessari- ly always reciprocate. Allen Roberts's Animals in African Art (1995) also renders my entry on animal imagery both sim- plistic and obsolete-something that is occasionally inevitable, I suppose, in any such omnibus publishing effort, where many years pass between the writing of an essay and its publication. Another original essay, on the trickster (D.J. Cosentino), indicates that this charac- ter/principle is widespread in African folklore, but that its visual manifestations are far more limited. The best example, pursued in this entry, is of course the Eshu/Elegba complex in Yoruba and re- lated cultures on the continent and in the diaspora (cross-referenced here).

COURTESY OF GROVE'S DICTIONARIES INC. (including textiles), beads, leather, mixed media, and gourds, this section is com- posed entirely of essays freshly written for this publication. They are welcome, even if they do not often give specialist read- ers new material. After all, while The Dic- tionary of Art is surely intended to be of use to those who wrote for it, it is students and the nonspecialist general public who constitute the primary target audience. There are vast quantities of valuable infor- mation here for them, along with bibli- ographies enabling them to pursue any subject further. This, as I see it, is what such a dictionary is about. Earth as material is divided into mud used for building and paint (N. Tobert) and mud used for ceramics (M.C. Berns and R.T. Soppelsa). Here, as in other en- tries in Part V, the authors survey the physical properties, basic manufacturing techniques, decoration, and varied types of objects. In the metal essay (E. Herbert), african arts * winter 1997 for example, iron, copper and its alloys, and gold are the main subjects; the author outlines the histories and distributions of technologies, mentioning several metal art forms in the process. The use of paint (F.T. Smith) is discussed under three headings: body and shrine art; domestic structures; and decoration of vehicles, textiles, masks, and other objects. Wood, then stone, are surveyed as widespread and limited, respectively (W.J. Dewey). A brief exami- nation of ivory sources, object types, and values (K. Curow) precedes a longer entry on fiber, divided into two units, weaving (J. Mack) and basketry (M. Carey). Weaving, not surprisingly, is a cat- egory discussed in many Dictionary en- tries, such as those on textiles; on several countries, areas, and ethnic groups (e.g., Mali, Madagascar, Fulani); and on dress. Remarkably, the editors have kept dupli- cation to a minimum. Thus weaving and textiles are handled differently in every 63</page><page sequence="7">instance. Beads (C.G. Kennedy) rightfully receive their own entry here, rather than being subsumed under some other cate- gory, and the same is true of leather (B.E. Frank). In both cases I wanted longer, more detailed essays, but these are consis- tent with those on other materials. Mixed media (C.M. Kreamer) too are recognized as important in Africa. Gourds (T.J.H. Chappel) are the final material in this sur- vey, the brief discussion covering their association with women and motherhood, their types and techniques of decoration, and designs (mostly nonfigurative). Part VI: Art Forms. At 71 pages this exploration of the major art forms on the continent (excluding Egypt and Roman North Africa) is the longest part of the African "book." It is divided into fifteen object types in the following partly logi- cal, partly arbitrary way: architecture, sculpture, masks and masquerade, body arts, dress, divination instruments, musi- cal instruments, currency/weights/mea- sures, tools and implements, furniture, tobacco containers and pipes, household utensils, and rock arts. Why, I wonder, is rock arts, the earliest of all these forms, discussed last? Where are modes of trans- portation, festivals, toys, and altars? Some of these topics are much more important 64 than tobacco equipment. As a partisan of festivals-for Africans themselves, among the continent's most compelling art forms-I am disappointed not to see them singled out for conceptual and selective culture-specific treatment, although festi- vals are not infrequently discussed briefly in entries on specific peoples. At 16 pages, the architecture entry (P. Oliver) is the longest single essay in the African part of The Dictionary. Labelle Prussin is conspicuous by her absence, except in bibliographies. The introduction outlines definition problems and regional settlement statistics. Next are some brief discussions of materials: stone, soil, brick, wood and palm, grass, hair, and hide. A section on vernacular architecture covers building types, scale, spatial organization, symbolism, and decoration. I was sur- prised to see the usage of "huts" main- tained for single-celled units, compared to "houses," defined as structures "con- ceived and built as a number of separate units, or to accommodate a variety of dis- crete functions" (p. 307). The author sur- veys basic structural forms, from simple domes to more complex rectangular, sub- divided buildings with hipped roofs and verandahs. The entry mentions palaces, shrines, and other religious buildings, as african arts winter 1997 well as meeting houses, granaries, and stores, citing some specific examples. Varieties of spatial organization and set- tlement plan are sampled. The tendency here-also encountered elsewhere in The Dictionary-is to enu- merate many varieties of type and style, form and function. Unless one is familiar with them (and few are), these citations begin to read a bit like laundry lists. In the architecture section the relative dearth of illustrations becomes notable, even lam- entable: ten photographs (but, curiously, no plans) are provided, while several hundred examples are discussed or men- tioned. The one page of text on architec- tural decoration, for instance, cites more than twenty examples but illustrates only one building, an Ndebele compound.

Collection of the artist</page><page sequence="8">brief section addressing Christian archi- tecture (cross-referenced to Coptic, Nu- bia, Ethiopia, and postcolonial examples in individual country entries) is followed by a longer entry on Islamic architecture, with subdivisions on secular and sacred forms and on decoration. An overview of Western architectural "imports," such as trading and slaving forts and castles begun in the fifteenth century, as well as European-influenced styles and types (fine seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Cape Dutch buildings in South Africa being prime examples), takes up less than a page. Another page is given to "mod- ernism," where a dozen-plus architects are cited by name (some with articles of their own elsewhere in The Dictionary). The architecture section closes with a 49- entry bibliography. The section on sculpture is compara- tively short, probably because so many other entries address the subject. The introduction (L. Perrois) is followed by about two pages on formal analysis (S. Vogel). The latter essay stresses the formal inventions and conventions of African sculptors, such as tendencies toward com- binations of abstract geometric and organ- ic forms, toward "active inner volume" and "active voids," and toward articulat- ed segments rather than continuous form. One of several bold, fascinating state- ments appears in the first paragraph of the conclusion: "In the context of Western art history, a striking feature of African art in general, and wooden sculpture in particu- lar, is that it is not normally narrative, does not depict movement or groups of figures interacting and is not pictorial; it does not seek to create any illusion of motion, per- spective, or verisimilitude. If an artist wants hair on his figure that exactly resembles hair, he will not hesitate to attach some of the real thing. If movement is wanted, the figure is worn or carried in dance" (p. 325). There is much to ponder in this pithy essay. The entry on ivory (K. Curnow) con- fines its discussion to those sculptures normally called "Afro-Portuguese," the earliest of African art forms made for export. One fine example from each of the two "schools" of sixteenth-century pro- duction is illustrated; the author enumer- ates main style features for each, giving special attention to African components. The subsequent essay on ceramic sculp- ture (M.C. Berns) neatly complements the earlier one in Part V (on materials and techniques). It emphasizes terracotta figu- rative elements or anthropomorphic ves- sels, most of which are made for ritual set- tings, and many by women. Igbo mbari houses provide the emphasis for an entry on unfired mud or clay sculpture (R.T. Soppelsa &amp; N. Tobert). The next essay con- cerns cement sculpture (D.H. Ross), an essentially twentieth-century phenome- non and a medium increasingly exploited. A second major essay in Part VI addresses masks and masquerades (D.A. Binkley). The author newly conceptual- izes one of Africa's premier art forms, initially illuminating Western views of isolated masks as sculptural objects in contrast with African valuations of mas- querades as performative ensembles. General ideas and processes that charac- terize the genre play against culture-spe- cific qualities of masks and masking in an apt balancing strategy that is also employed in many other Dictionary es- says. Observations on male dominance in masking, its use in defining gender and status difference, as well as mask- ing's association with political and spiri- tual authority, and its embodying of either ancestral or nature spirits, precede Mossi, Kuba, and Yoruba examples. In a section on forms and styles, the author addresses variations in type as well as Continued on page 85 african arts winter 1997 65</page><page sequence="9">Dictionary Continued from page 65 the symbolism of mask and costume materials, and of color. Cross-references to more expand- ed treatments of masking are numerous, lead- ing readers toward deeper, more detailed accounts. Another section highlights the manu- facture of masks and preparations of maskers, and then performance, which often invokes the skills of many: dancers, singers, drummers, and mask retainers. Rules and restrictions govern- ing both performers and audiences are dis- cussed, along with performance situations (e.g., day or nighttime appearances and solo or ensemble outings). Briefly exploring a variety of masking contexts, the author stresses their values and functions other than as entertain- ment, such as helping to effect-both create and resolve-life or community crises at initiations and funerals. Discussion of specific contexts among the Kuba, Dan, and Bamana precedes a short section on women's masking among Mende and related peoples. There follows a short entry on boys' masking (S. Ottenberg). The next section, on body arts (C. Adepegba and J.B. Eicher), divides into coiffure, painting, and marking, the last further divided into scar- ification, cicatrization (defined as the raising of keloids), and tattoo. The authors cite numerous specific variations for women and men in many parts of the continent, but advance relatively few broad principles. Eicher also wrote the sub- sequent entry on dress: she outlines a few gen- eral ideas-understanding both single items and ensembles, and the adaptation and trans- formation of outside ideas and materials, a process that can be called "cultural authentica- tion." Jewelry (M. Carey) is discussed as a form of dress, with a good balance between broad statements of a cross-cultural nature and cul- ture-specific examples. In about four pages, an entry on regalia (N.I. Nooter) introduces the subject, then subdivides it according to three useful form/function cate- gories: elevation, protection, magnification. The coverage focuses on West and Central Africa; it would be instructive to see regalia included from eastern and southern kingdoms. Problem- solving in Africa frequently involves divina- tion, whose instruments may sometimes be considered works of art. In this entry (D.H. Ross), examples are cited from about eight cul- tures in West and Central Africa, from elaborate Yoruba sculptures to the symbol-laden baskets of the Chokwe. Artistically embellished musi- cal instruments (M.T. Brincard) are introduced next, then surveyed according to type: chordo- phones, membranophones, and idiophones. A short essay on arms and shields (D. Pelrine), which have for some years been col- lected as works of art, is followed by entries on currency, weights, and measures (J. Rivallain) and tools and implements (P. de Maret), such as adzes and weaving apparatus. Often con- sidered minor arts, forms in these categories are nevertheless of considerable interest, and The Dictionary editors and consultants are to be commended for including them. Symbolic forms of currency (especially in Central Africa) and anthropomorphic adzes often encapsulate significant ritual and social values. The same may be said, of course, of some furniture, tobacco containers and pipes (both entries by M. Carey) and other household utensils (M. Bers and M. Carey). Stools and headrests, for example, are both ancient and exceptionally widely distributed, so it is not surprising that they may be aggrandized or accorded excep- tional cultural value. Likewise, Dan and near- by people have elaborated spoons into symbols of prestige and hospitality, and virtu- ally all peoples channel artistic energy into an almost limitless variety of gourd, ceramic, wood, skin, and fiber containers. Part VI ends with about six pages on rock arts (J.D. Lewis-Williams) which, after a histori- ographic introduction, are surveyed by region: North Africa, the Horn, Eastern and Southern Africa. A map identifies major sites and regions. Researchers' preoccupations are mentioned: "catalogues, counts, and chronologies" and visual comparisons used as evidence for "migrations, diffusions, and cultural contacts" (p. 370). After raising the question of dating dif- ficulties, the author follows with a regional sur- vey. Upper Pleistocene Bubalus Antiquus-era large game animals in the Sahara are followed by human and more animal imagery of the Round Head period (ca. 9000 and 8000 B.P.)- times when the Sahara had heavy rainfall, lakes, and Mediterranean-type vegetation. As the peoples of those early periods were hunter gatherers, the author applies his neuropsycho- logical model of shamanistic trances to inter- pret many of the images and designs. The subsequent pastoral period includes domestic, herding, hunting, and perhaps initiation scenes, many of them remarkably animated and natu- ralistic. Rock art of the Horn region, depicting cattle and people, appears to be later than early Saharan imagery; several styles of painting and engraving in this area figure in diffusionist models that are now questioned. Both Eastern and Southern African rock arts depict elements of shamanic trance, interpretations strength- ened by ethnographies of Sandawe- and San- speaking peoples. Combined human-animal figures, distorted humanoids, bending dancers, and "nosebleed" figures relate to trance states, and there are also many finely drawn animal images-giraffes, kudu, eland-in Zimbabwe and South Africa. This discussion is cross-refer- enced to the same author's article on the San, where other aspects of this interpretive model are discussed. Notably, the San area also includes the Apollo II cave, accepted by many to date back to 26,000 B.P. Part VII: Regions. This section devotes 43 pages to seven major areas (each with a map) beginning with North Africa (J.M. Bloom). Although discussion of the history and art his- tory of these regions is distinctly summary and broad brush, the continental framework allows trade, diffusion, migration, and other processes to define a greater Africa, in all senses, than sub-Saharan studies alone permit-especially since most of the latter also exclude southern (and eastern) parts of the continent. Thus Carthage in the sixth century B.C. is seen "trad- ing tin from Corwall, gold from West Africa, ivory from Central Africa and textiles" (p. 377). Architecture takes pride of place in this essay, african arts winter 1997 yet rock paintings at such sites as Tassili in Algeria are not neglected. Punic, Phoenician, and Islamic arts in the North are schematically outlined (and often cross-referenced to other essays). The next essay, on the Northeast (D. Appleyard), looks broadly at Sudan, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia, and Eritrea, all but the last also covered in separate country essays. But the usefulness of the regional survey is in the very absence of national borders which, of course, are relatively recent. Although prehistoric rock art is mentioned, greater space is allotted Egypt-derived architecture and sculpture from ancient Meroe, Aksumite monuments and stone sculpture, Christian arts adopted in fourth-century-A.D. Ethiopia and Nubia, and Islamic forms when Islam became the domi- nant religion in parts of Ethiopia and Somalia. The Western Sudan (P.M. McNaughton) is defined as the inland region from Lake Chad to Senegal and is surveyed in that direction, east to west. These broad surveys by region appear to be efforts at macrohistory, interethnic conti- nuities, and distributions of object types and styles. This is accomplished in the Western Sudan essay by drawing attention to (among other things) the several medieval and later empires or kingdoms in the area, complexes of anthropomorphic terracotta sculpture, cross- cultural distributions of horizontal masks in two subregions, and a tendency toward "pole style"-relative abstraction and elongation. At the same time the author correctly points out the "tremendous cultural variation" of lan- guage and style in this extended area, so his revival of the "pole style" notion (a coinage of Elsy Leuzinger in the '50s, I think) can admit, as it must, of numerous exceptions. He also acknowledges that the art history of this region is minimally known. In surveying subregions, he mentions a number of twentieth-century local traditions but does not pursue some cross-cultural macro possibilities. Among the widely distributed patterns that might have been discussed are the importance of nature spirits in divination, healing, and other cult activity, and the earthbound, sculptural archi- tecture identified by Prussin as the Sudanese style. Looking at the influence of Islam on the art and architecture of the Western Sudan would be another way of approaching the sub- ject broadly and historically. The Guinea Coast (F. Lamp) is here de- fined as extending eastward from Guinea Bissau through Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Cote d'Ivoire to Ghana and Togo. The helpful historical introduction speaks of the monu- mental effects of European contacts, begin- ning in the fifteenth century, in causing cultural realignments, trade, migration, repa- triation, and, in this century, a rise of urban- ism, with concomitant changes in the arts. Examples are Afro-Brazilian architecture and the cult of Mamy Wata. At the same time, the survival and standardization of early forms of Poro men's societies are also cited. The author briefly discusses cultural forms such as prod- ucts of the Sapi, Asante, and Dahomey king- doms and describes the intercultural male and female ritual organizations (e.g., Bondo, Poro) from C6te d'Ivoire westward. Masking 85</page><page sequence="10">from this area is shown to be varied and com- plex, though sometimes lent unity by the gen- dered sodalities and by a legendary founding ancestor mask type called Landai. The survey of six subregional styles usefully goes beyond "tribal style" models, looking instead at clus- ters of formal and functional traits. The regional survey of Part VII then jumps inexplicably from Togo to Western Equatoria, a zone seen as beginning in the Cameroon Highlands west to Bangui and southwest to the mouth of the Zaire, embracing much of Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Con- go, Gabon, and Equatorial Guinea. Thus all of southern Benin and Nigeria, from the Fon and Yoruba in the west to Cross River peoples in the east, is left out. This puzzling omission is a flaw in the otherwise carefully articulated coverage of the major regions. The Western Equatoria section (L. Siroto) is a sophisticated overview of a fairly diverse region whose core is composed of Bantu-speaking cultivator groups that migrated south into the forest area, with strong- ly centralized groups to the north in Cameroon, and the western Kongo-speaking states to the south. The core groups have varied art styles in keeping with scattered, loosely cohesive sociopolitical structures, while Kongo states' artistic influences have been notable in much of Western Equatoria. Artistic embellishment and personal decoration have featured in competi- tive displays. A visual art chronology has not yet been established, but the author suggests several bases on which one might rest. He identifies art contexts: family or male cults and protective spirits lodged in ancestral relics, as well as masquerades expressing wealth and prestige. Figural sculpture and masquerades are characterized, as is the region's penchant for using applique metal decoratively in sheet and wire form. Central Africa (A.P. Bourgeois), from the Atlantic to the western Rift Valley, embraces the modern nations of Zaire, Congo, Cabinda, Angola, and Zambia. In his introduction, which mentions early artifacts and the area's paucity of rock arts, the author frames stylistic concerns that are still based on the fifty-year- old work of Frans Olbrechts. Five style regions are catalogued, each with numerous substyles, most being defined by ethnicity (language); several dozen art styles are enumerated. The author identifies three major mask macrostyles along with a fourth leaf/fiber mask complex that appears to underlie much other masking in the region. Curiously, the Central African penchant for creating assemblage power images out of multiple materials is not played up as a cross-cultural phenomenon. Textiles, ceramics, architecture, and European influence are each given a paragraph. East Africa is taken as encompassing Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Tanzania, Zambia, and Malawi (J. Coote, J. Mack). This region too is one of great geographical, linguis- tic, and cultural diversity. Economies and lifestyles include agriculture, trade, and semi- nomadic pastoralism. There are some hunt- ing/gathering peoples as well, but only a few kingdoms, such as the Ganda of Uganda and the Lozi of Zambia. An area often misrepre- 86 sented as "without art," East Africa in fact has exceptional body art and far more masking (Chewa, Makonde, and other Bantu peoples) and figural sculpture than is usually recog- nized, in addition to some rock art and occa- sional terracotta sculpture. Pole sculptures, more or less anthropomorphized, are found among peoples from the southern Sudan (Bongo and Bari) to Tanzania (Zaramo), the best known being those of the Mijikenda of Kenya. Swahili architecture is often impres- sive, and many groups carve stools and neck- rests, while shields are either carved or fashioned from leather, then painted. Southern Africa (A. Nettleton), again lin- guistically and culturally diverse, is surveyed excluding the forms introduced and main- tained by European settlers beginning in the seventeenth century, which are addressed in the South Africa entry. The author stresses shared or cross-cultural contexts for art, such as important states that flourished in eastern parts of the area as early as the eleventh century. Several different empires or kingdoms waxed and waned, often leaving behind impressive stone-walled architectural structures. Fine bee- hive structures of mats over wood and wicker- work, as well as wattle-and-daub houses, were also made. (Some are still made, of course, and in saying this I point out a difficulty with tense that recurs in The Dictionary, which adopts the past tense almost throughout, even for art forms still very much extant.) Some states thrived well into the twentieth century and continue on today, even if in diminished form. In all cases prestige objects were/are fash- ioned for leaders and nobility. Many different peoples also have vibrant wall painting tradi- tions. Although figural sculpture is limited in the region, used mainly in initiations, headrests and stools are widespread; some of both forms are embellished by animal or human figures which contribute to their symbolism. Personal decoration in the form of beadwork and bead- ed leather (and later, cloth) garments are the region's most dramatic art forms, especially at marriage ceremonies and among healers and diviners. Sculptural cloth and bead-covered "dolls" are important in some areas, where in certain cases they were carried by young women who had difficulty conceiving. These seven regions pretty well span the continent apart from Egypt and the unac- countably missing peoples of southern Nigeria. The surveys-outlined here in a criminally abbreviated form-are themselves quite brief. Vast amounts of territory and hun- dreds of ethnic groups are scanned, and their art forms are mostly discussed in schematic terms. The most fruitful aspects of these broad sweeps are the occasions when cross-cultural, shared, and macro trends as well as broadly distributed object types or styles are featured. Otherwise the arts of specific ethnic groups would have been better left to their own more ample entries (although this was perhaps not known to the regional survey authors). An advantage of the regional surveys, however, is that a far greater number of peoples, and some of their arts, is covered here than in the 65 entries on specific groups. african arts* winter 1997 Part VIII: The Diaspora. This entry (D.J. Crowley), an introduction to New World African art influences and survivals and trans- formations, is supplemented elsewhere in The Dictionary by African-American paragraphs or sections in entries for all Caribbean countries and Brazil, and by an essay on African- American art (R. Perry). Still a part of the long section on Africa, this six-page overview on the diaspora begins with a history of slavery, identifying the main African regions and peo- ples affected. After a paragraph or two on reli- gious retentions and reinterpretations in the New World, the article turns to architecture, mainly to shotgun houses and an African- Brazilian named Lisboa. Sculpture, masks, and textiles are discussed briefly, the entry closing with "other arts" such as pottery, bas- ketry, and painting. Part IX: Contemporary Developments. Under the themes of continuity and change, this essay (J. Povey) offers a seven-page assess- ment of religious contexts and adaptations to contemporary markets. A page on new forms outlines recent Makonde sculpture and espe- cially the stone sculpture of Zimbabwe, stim- ulated by Frank McEwen, plus developments in Oshogbo, Nigeria; these of course are no longer "new." The continent (mostly south of the Sahara) is schematically surveyed in terms of art training and guidance, generally from the thirties until about 1970, covering a num- ber of key early figures and schools: Romain- Desfosse's in Zaire, Poto Poto in Brazzaville, and others in Dakar, Makerere, Khartoum, Addis Ababa, and Johannesburg and Soweto (Polly Street). Most of these owed their exis- tence to outsider stimulus and patronage. With coverage apparently ending in the 1970s, this entry is severely out of date, although its omissions of more recent developments are often corrected in the essays on specific African countries. Part X: Forgery. This two-page entry (T. Celenko) begins with a discussion of authen- ticity, then makes a distinction between a fake and a forgery. Three categories are suggested: intentional forgeries, middleman fakes (e.g., tourist arts later sold as "genuine"), and authentic objects (made in Africa and normal- ly used within its maker's ethnic group). Fraud has increased since about 1980, when prices for select Africa sculptures reached well over a million dollars, with workshops both in Africa and in Europe. According to the author, the experienced human eye is still the most effective tool of detection, although he also mentions microscopic, chemical, thermo- luminescence, radiocarbon, and radiography testing methods, sometimes along with their shortcomings. Part XI: Historiography. The brevity of this entry (A. Jones)-less than a page-indicates the extent to which our field has yet to fully historicize its subject-due to entrenched ahis- torical models such as "culture area" and "one tribe, one style." Improvements are being made by using archaeological excavations, European writings and pictures (from early eras), and oral traditions. Alas, this entry is simply too short to be very instructive.</page><page sequence="11">Part XII: Museums and Part XIII: Exhibitions. The first of these essays (both by J. Picton), only a column long, approaches a historicized laun- dry list, while the second, only slightly longer, offers more of a feel for the history, current nature, and problematics of exhibitions of African art. Strengths and weaknesses of sev- eral sorts of display are discussed, using exam- ples from the Museum of Mankind, London; the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the Museum for African Art, New York; the National Museum of African Art, Washington, D.C.; and the UCLA Fowler Museum of Cul- tural History, Los Angeles. Part XIV: Collectors and Dealers. Again in less than one page, the author of this entry (J.L. Stanley) speaks of several early "curiosity cab- inets" by name, early artist-collectors (e.g., von der Heydt, Tzara, Matisse), the American artist-dealer-collector Stieglitz, and the eccen- tric collector Albert Bares, plus collectors John Quinn, Agnes Meyer, and Walter Arensberg, among others, who were attracted primarily to the visual power of sculpture. Later, prestige, fashion, and investment became collecting motivations along with increasing rarity, auc- tions, and occurrences in Africa that have brought new objects to the market. Finally the gifts or bequests of specific major collectors to form or bolster museum collections are men- tioned, as is Ulli Beier's efforts to collect mod- ern African art-the results now lodged in Bayreuth, Germany. Part XV: Art Libraries and Photographic Col- lections. This entry (J.L. Stanley) covers a lot of ground in a single page. Major museums of ethnography, and their strengths, are cited along with colonial libraries and archives, and major university and art-museum library col- lections in the U.S. and Europe. The author notes the institutional shift from ethnography to art history, along with the increasing avail- ability of older material as a result of new media. The sad state of libraries and photo archives in Africa ends the entry. Country Essays Two other forms of articles-in addition to the long African section just outlined-constitute The Dictionary of Art's commitment to the arts of the continent. These are the 66 entries by ethnic group and those on the 46 countries that are members of the United Nations. They are conceived to overlap only in minor ways with one another or with the conceptual, the- matic, or overview essays in the long section. There are as well scattered essays on sites, cities, and individual artists and architects, but not in significant numbers. The country essays are of markedly differ- ent length and scope, from a scant few para- graphs (e.g., Djibouti, Equatorial Guinea) to quite substantial ones on art-rich countries: Ethiopia (16 pp.), Ghana (3), Nigeria (11), South Africa (21), Zaire (4). The pages allotted show certain inconsistencies not always easily justified by a country's size, number of ethnic groups, and culture history. Here, finally, we have a handful of African authors: Abdullah, Adande, Fosu, Oguibe, Magombe, Nour. But it is only a handful; the voices in The Dictionary are overwhelmingly American, British, and European, and today this is not acceptable. That mistake in judgment parallels what many will consider a neocolonial bias in many articles. Despite the recurrent statement that "this entry covers the art produced in the area since colonial times," for example, those countries whose essays contain an architec- ture section nearly always feature colonial buildings rather than indigenous or indeed postcolonial ones. Most entries in The Diction- ary are views from the outside, attempts to objectify the arts and their contexts and pack- age them manageably for a general audience. While this is perhaps to be expected in a pub- lication such as this, it seems that passing over potential authors from within ethnic groups or countries represented is a missed opportu- nity. The differences would sometimes be wholesale, sometimes nuanced, but the inside view would be discernible. Most country entries longer than a few paragraphs have an introduction setting forth geography, ecology, population, and history, followed by sections on architecture, sculpture, and painting; in the latter sections the stated emphasis is on arts produced since colonial times, with cross-references to relevant entries of the long Africa section and those on specific ethnic groups. In many cases too there are sec- tions devoted to modern patronage and art institutions. The longer essays-those on Ethi- opia, Nigeria, and South Africa, for instance- have many more subdivisions and more space devoted to cultural history. South Africa's entry has fourteen authors, not one of whom (judging from the names) is of black African heritage. Most of the art history discussed here is of European South Africa; the subdivisions noted above are supplemented by ones on inte- rior decoration, furniture, ceramics, glass, and metalwork. The entry covers cross-cultural communication and developments among black artists since apartheid began to be dis- mantled, and of art centers encouraging blacks such as those at Polly Street, Ndaleni (Natal), and Rorke's Drift. Nevertheless the articles on South Africa continue to express overwhelm- ing European dominance. Eurocentric handling notwithstanding, South Africa appears to have presented a special, perhaps uneasy case to the editors. It is among the few countries from which biographies of black African artists are included, the others being North African (Morocco, Tunisia, etc.), from which there are some 20 artist/architect biographies. The Dictionary publishes about 66 biographies of Africans all told, of which 45 are from South Africa. Such an imbalance is unten- able. Seventeen of these are white architects, three are white potters, ten are white artists. Another ten are black South African artists, among them Jackson Hlungwane (a self-taught outsider), Noria Mabasa (a self-taught clay sculptor), the photographer Peter Magubane, printmakers Azaria Mbatha and Cyprian Shilakoe, plus three exiled artists who live(d) in France, the U.K., or New York. These are altogether eccentric choices following no ap- parent logic. A few white, black, or mixed artist/architects from the Mediterranean and South Africa-however capriciously chosen- are given biographies here, but not Olowe or Areogun or Osei Bonsu or even Ben Enwonwu or Bruce Onobrakpeya. A few modern Ni- gerian and Kenyan architects get biographies, but no contemporary painters or sculptors, exiled or not. Thus the laudable general effort toward inclusion, often met, has some ambigu- ities and exceptions. The Dictionary claims to have published over 16,000 biographies of artists or architects. Twenty-one from all African countries, apart from South Africa, is almost ridiculous. No, it is ridiculous. Essays on Ethnic Groups The essays on ethnic groups, areas (e.g., Mid- dle Niger cultures, Nok), and sites (Ife, Great Zimbabwe, Igbo Ukwu, Timbuktu) are impor- tant to The Dictionary's coverage. Surely the most important sculpture-producing peoples are surveyed (maintaining that bias), but so are a few eastern and southern peoples one might not expect: Maasai, Makonde, Ndebele, Nuba, San, Shona, Swahili, Venda, Zulu. The choices are usually good although sometimes arbi- trary. There are entries on Akye and Venda but not Agni or Nguni; the Chamba, Bembe, and Nupe are represented but not the Turkana, Lulua, Kuyu, Ewe, or We (Guere). About 70 entries appear in the above categories, and of course they too vary in length and emphases. Most are between two and six pages, with one or two illustrations, enough space to discuss several separate categories or a few dozen object types. Here again a specific format is fol- lowed, though not rigidly: geography and economy, culture history, including origins when known and relationships with nearby peoples. Figure sculpture, then masks and masquerades typically constitute the next sec- tions (after architecture if it is considered notable in the area), followed by "other arts," sometimes with that heading or broken down into metalwork, textiles, festivals, domestic arts, or other relevant categories. These essays-like everything in The Dictionary-are dense and tightly organized, with few if any wasted words. Editorial control was well focussed. At the same time, all articles are not edited down to levels of uniformity or voice- lessness. The interests and approaches and style of an author usually can be seen from one essay to another, especially in the longer ones. A useful way to review the essays on eth- nic groups is to compare a few of them. Two pairs of articles of similar length for at least analogous cultures serve this purpose: first, those on the Senufo (T. F6rster) and Songye (D. Hersak), and second, the "Asante and related peoples" (D. H. Ross) and the Kuba (J. Vansina). Both pairs begin by placing the peo- ples geographically; all except the Asante refer to neighbors (who are mentioned in the body of the Asante essay), and their introduc- tions are abbreviated histories. For the Asante the author also cites European contacts and wars and notes the relationship between visu- al motifs and their many verbal parallels. The shorter Senufo and Songye essays then turn to african arts* winter 1997 87 87 african arts - winter 1997</page><page sequence="12">figure sculpture-divination figures and rhythm pounders for the former, power fig- ures of two main sizes and functions for the latter. A discussion of masks and masquer- ades follows, including a variety of forms, sit- uations, regional variations, materials, colors, symbols, and other meanings. Masking con- cludes the essay on the Songye, while staffs are briefly discussed before the ending of the Senufo entry. Both finish with bibliographies, as do all the entries on ethnic groups. After the history paragraphs, the Asante essay moves to regalia, subdivided into the Golden Stool (and other stools), chairs, state swords and their varieties, linguist staffs, umbrellas, palanquins, and personal adorn- ments. Considerable detail informs these three pages. In the Kuba introduction the author dis- cusses their emphasis on pattern rather than volume, and his view that sculpture represents states of being rather than action. The reader is then offered information about the following topics: the nineteenth-century influx of rich materials into Kuba areas; precolonial exports of works of art, some as souvenirs for Euro- peans; the specialized production of material culture, as well as imports; king figures and other figural sculptures and charms; decora- tive and domestic arts, including textiles. The last-mentioned arts are outlined with indica- tions of their great variety; nearly all are deco- rated with graphic motifs, over 200 of which are named and, taken together, reference many Kuba values. (Kuba patterns are thus loosely analogous to the far greater number of Akan visual symbols that call up proverbs or other verbal expressions.) A relatively short section on Kuba masking is followed by a few para- graphs on architecture. On the other hand, masks are quite absent among the Asante. That essay turns from regalia to beliefs and religious arts such as akua'ba, shrine sculpture, cast-brass kuduo (with their origin in Mamluk Egypt), and ritu- al ceramics. The entry ends with secular arts: goldweights, sheet-brass cosmetic containers (forowa), combs, pipes, and elaborate drums, some with figurative ensembles. Both essays feature many examples and enough discus- sion to provide readers with a reasonably full impression of the arts, but they do so by quite different means. Asante arts are catalogued in their considerable richness and variety, where- as the Kuba entry is aimed more at providing a conceptual understanding of Kuba arts and the principles underlying them, along with an emphasis on history-not unexpected, as the author is a historian. Thus these discussions are framed not only by the art but by the authors' own interests. Another example of "voice" may be cited, the article by R.J. and S.K. McIntosh on Middle Niger cultures. The authors are the archaeologists responsible for excavating Jenne-Jeno in Mali, which provided major amounts of hard data on these cultures so well known among art collectors, dealers, and scholars for their magnificent terracottas and copper-alloy sculptures. Apart from the McIntoshes' modest sculptural finds, the works of art are all illegally excavated and 88 hence without accurate provenance and con- textual information. The corpus has thus been ripe for interpretation, or as the authors would have it, overinterpretation of the type represented in the work of B. de Grunne. The latter's several publications are taken to task in sufficient depth (and with considerable passion) to render much of his "data" suspect. At the same time the Mclntoshes present much substantive information, derived from the archaeological record, to give a fairly com- plete if inevitably abbreviated account-also interpretive, but with more evidence behind it-of the cultures responsible for these won- derful sculptures. The Dictionary of Art is altogether impressive, a tour de force of almost gargantuan propor- tions, but also accessible and readable. Africa receives a fair shake (some will say much more than that), but the Eurocentric bias is just strong enough, and perhaps insidious enough, to put me off somewhat, to make me feel uneasy-and I am pretty far from being a political activist. I marvel at the logistical effort of marshaling some 120 of the most respected Africanists to this task. At the same time I lament the absence of any real African voice, of anything more than a token effort to include African authors. I also wonder if any efforts are being made to get The Dictionary of Art to Africa. It is unlikely that more than a scant handful of libraries or universities on the continent will have enough foreign exchange, and the justi- fication, to order copies for their people. Will we Euro-Americans continue to analyze the arts of a continent that has little access to our publications? This is far from a trivial ques- tion. And it provides a major challenge to Janet Stanley and others who have worked so hard and effectively on the book exchange program sponsored by the Arts Council of the African Studies Association. At least one question remains: Would the 237 contiguous pages on Africa constitute a useful stand-alone volume on the arts of the continent? If it were published as a separate book, I would have to say no, for two main rea- sons. The Dictionary is conceived and written as a reference work, an encyclopedia of enormous world coverage and considerable depth some- times, but it does not read very well or very entertainingly from cover to cover, owing to the density of most essays and the sometimes schematic, almost outlined nature of certain others. The other reason is the lack of illustra- tions; the general reader needs more visual han- dles to go along with the dense verbiage. Also, the entries on ethnic groups and sites would have to be included to amplify such a book, and with three or four times the number of pictures in these parts as well. What might be more fea- sible than a publication any different from the major one before us would be one or more CD- ROM disks that include all (or most) relevant African texts from The Dictionary, preferably in conjunction with illustrated material such as that now being assembled by Christopher Roy. Now that would be one hell of a resource on the arts of Africa! [ atrican arts winter 1997 b 0 0 k S Continued from page 19 Kenyan identity and gained her acceptance by Western institutions because her work is asso- ciated with African pottery traditions. Berns writes that Odundo herself believes she is trapped by definitions of her work as "craft," thereby limiting her access to projects labeled "art." African writers and critics ignore her work because they do not perceive it as overt- ly political, nor does it subvert assumptions about contemporary African-art history. Such conclusions miss the point, says Berns: Odundo's vessels are visionary, diffi- cult, and subtly opinionated. The artist's prowess over the past fifteen years has been maintained by absorbing hybrid influences through which she invites us to discover the beauty of her work. D MOMENTE DES ALLTAGS/EVERYDAY MOMENTS Fotodokumente aus Nordkamerun, 1950-1985/Documentary Photographs from North Cameroon, 1950-1985 Rene Gardi Museum fir Volkerkunde und Schweizerisches Mu- seum fur Volkskunde, Basel, 1995. Text in German, French, and English. 140 pp., 360 b/w photos, 3 maps. 48SF hardcover, 30SF softcover. Reviewed by Nicholas David When I arrived in the Mandara highlands of North Cameroon in January 1986 to launch an ethnoarchaeological program aimed at under- standing the nature and work of style in mate- rial culture, I began by borrowing copies of Rene Gardi's books from Pastor and Frau Eichenberger, his old friends and advisors still resident in Mokolo. (In an "everyday mo- ment" 44 years gone by, we meet a pith-hel- meted Gertrude Eichenberger and her Mafa pupils at their Soulede mission school.) My Mafa assistant and I spent several days work- ing through Gardi's photographs, exploring their precious ethnographic content at the same time as I rediscovered and, as always, was bowled over by their impact and beauty. The Museum fur Volkerkunde Basel mount- ed an exhibition of these photographs in late 1995. The prints, many enlarged to about 60 cm x 60 cm (if memory serves), were simply and well displayed, without the infuriating reflections that so often accompany such dis- plays. The images interacted evocatively with a limited number of artifacts-for the most part objects of daily life, and of an elegant sim- plicity. The closing of the exhibition coincided with a seminar on African iron working attended by Africanist and Europeanist eth- noarchaeologists, archaeologists, and archaeo- metallurgists who saw an extraordinary selection of films on Africans making iron; the oldest, showing the Dime of Ethiopia, dated</page></plain_text>
