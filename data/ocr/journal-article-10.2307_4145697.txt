<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS THE ANCIENT WORLD JEAN BOTTERO: Religion in ancient Mesopotamia. (Translated by T. L. Fagan.) x, 246 pp. Chicago and London: The University of Chicago Press, 2001. $30.00. Ever since publishing La religion babylonienne (Paris: Presses Universitaires de France, 1952 (pp. vii-viii)), Jean Bott6ro has dedicated himself to developing an ever-increasing understanding of ancient Mesopotamian religious thought. Almost every related field has been touched by his research: divination, hermeneutics, mythology, religious literature; his contribution has been of great significance to future studies. This work is a new synthesis of his experiences as a scholar, and consists of seven chapters, plus one of con- clusions: an interesting opportunity to follow the development of one of the most important interpreters of Mesopotamian thought. After the first chapter (pp. 2-4), in which Bott6ro explains religion by comparing it to love (a vertical 'love': a very interesting point!), he introduces his reader to the Mesopotamian world. In chapter iv he allows the texts to speak for themselves by providing translations of some remarkable poetic passages addressed to different divinities. From the reverential sentiment and the stereotypic terminology he deduces the concept the Mesopotamians had of the divinity: a being of high 'ontological density' (p. 38), which reveals itself through an irradiation of extraordinary and frightening luminosity, a being whom the faithful address without love, only for protection and to obtain success in life. Precursor of the later concept of transcendence, the author develops his interpretation on this 'sentiment of distance' (p. 40). Conceived as a projection on heaven of the relationships of human society- a parallel but much more powerful world-Mesopotamian religion is understood through the metaphor of the king, whose behaviours and privileges suitably match the relationship that correlates the gods to men. This metaphor forms the backbone of the author's interpretation-the true peculiarity of Mesopotamian religious thought. Out of this conception grows the religion of the intellectual el1ites concerned with speculation and knowledge and completely detached from the down-to-earth attitude of the remaining population. Yet every religion could be seen from this point of view. In today's Christian world do not women address the Lord-conceived as a most powerful king- to implore the safe return from war of their sons, husbands and brothers, even if their survival means other Christian men will be killed? On a popular ground, that of the daily toil to progress in life, all religions sink into 'superstitio' (in its late meaning of 'spoilt, unreasonable religion'), and it is hard to single out meaningful differences between them. This does not facilitate interpretation, but rather hinders it, as we will see below. Mesopotamian religion is described fully in chapter v. The pantheon was apparently formed by countless divinities whose Sumerian names are epithets explaining functions rather than proper names-this is another of the author's key concepts: the gods are considered functions rather than characters. The author masterfully outlines the religious context in which such a pantheon</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 67 flourished. Another careful and exhaustive description-of the cult-follows in the sixth chapter, examined in all its various aspects. In every topic dealt with in the two last chapters the author tries to distinguish the earlier Sumerian level from the subsequent superimposed Akkadian layer, thus providing a diachronic perspective, the kind of information we seldom come across in general treatises of this kind. In the seventh chapter, which concludes the exposition, the author considers the influences of Mesopotamian religion-evident in the biblical world-and its survival in the centuries of Late Antiquity, in the 'astral religion', spread through all the territories of the Roman Empire and beyond. The pages dedicated to this topic are exemplary for their clarity and accuracy. I hinted above at the difficulties resulting from the interpretation drawn by means of an 'anthropomorphic' key grounded on the 'metaphor of the king': the divinity conceived as a sovereign. It does of course explain many of the phenomena, yet it nonetheless leaves relevant doubts open. So, when the father relinquishes his reign to his son-in the correlation of An to Enlil- it can hardly be the projection in heaven of human institutions (p. 51), but it hints rather at the transmission of the divine 'power' from the unreachable starry sky down to earth through the intermediate atmospheric element. It assumes the guise of life (the breath of life), and of word (expression of thought), both aerial in their nature and thus characteristic of the god Enlil (Lord Air: p. 46). This transmission-in different ways-is the same as that we come across in the 'Marduk-Ea-Typ' incantations, when Asalluhi goes to his father Enki to ask him for help in dealing with the demons tormenting the patient; the same that is meant by the journeys of the gods (pp. 133f.); the same made possible by the rite of the hieros gamos (pp. 156f). The temple is first shown-according to the 'metaphor of the king'--as the place where the sovereign can rest peacefully, far from the troubles of everyday life (p. 115), but later as a place that is an essential and primary part of the Universe (p. 118). In fact the temple appears 'isolated', because it is dangerous, since it is charged with the melammu (p. 38), consistent with the latter interpretation and disagreeing with the former. Again we have to turn to the concept of transmission, which must be mediated, in order to make the divine splendour productive rather than paralysing. The king symbolizes the extreme point from which transmission enters human society: thus his dominant position and, in certain periods, his divinization in life or his divine birth. These conceptions look blurred when we turn to the records on mass religiosity, but are clearly distinguishable in the elaborations of the elites. If the reader lessens the 'weight' of the 'metaphor of the king', he will acquire from this book a complete and accurate portrait of the religious thought of the Mesopotamian civilization which other works of the same kind seldom provide.
