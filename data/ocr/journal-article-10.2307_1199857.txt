<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Volume XLIV OCTOBER 1964 THE SHEKHINA RAPHAEL PATAI* I IN BIBLICAL times God was believed to have dwelt in, or ridden upon, clouds as did Baal in the older Canaanite mythology.' The Hebrew mythological validation of the sanctity of the desert Tabernacle and the Solo- monic Temple was the myth of Yahweh descending in a cloud onto and into the sanctuary.2 The presence of God in this "cloud of Yahweh"3 was regarded as something more tangible even than its visual aspect: because of the cloud "Moses was not able to enter into the Tent of Meeting."4 Similarly, after the building of the Solomonic Temple was completed "the cloud filled the house of Yahweh so that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of the cloud, for the glory of Yahweh filled the House of Yahweh."5 The archaic nature of this mythologem of the deity's physical presence in his temple is attested by the poetic passage following the above statement: Then spoke Solomon: Yahweh said, "I dwell in darkness" But I built a house for Thee A seat to abide in forever.6 A careful perusal of all the passages referring to the manifestation of God in the sanctuary shows that the nouns "cloud" and "glory" are used inter- changeably, and that the "cloud" was undoubtedly regarded as the visible form taken by the "glory of Yahweh" when he wished to indicate his presence in his earthly abode, the sanctuary. The terminus technicus for the visible appearance of Yahweh in the sanctuary or in any other place chosen by him is the verb shakhan, meaning to dwell or abide. In the great and famous Sinai theophany, "Yahweh's glory dwelt on Mount Sinai";7 and subsequently he commanded Moses to build him a sanc- tuary "that I may dwell [w'shakihanti] among" the Children of Israel.8 Follow- ing the conquest of Canaan, God took up his abode on Mount Zion and is referred to by Isaiah as "Yahweh Zebaoth who dwells [shokhen] in Mount * The author holds the Dr.Phil. degree from the University of Budapest (1933) and the Ph.D. from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (1936).

It seems that the oldest Elohistic tradition used the term "Tent of Meeting," while the more recent priestly tradition preferred the archaic term mishkan, "dwelling,"'3 thereby giving emphasis to the idea that Yahweh actually "dwelt" (shokhen) in the desert sanctuary. An additional dif- ference between the old Elohistic and the later priestly traditions is that, according to the older tradition, Yahweh merely put in temporary appearances in the Tent of Meeting; he was a visit- ing deity whose appearance in, or de- parture from, the tent was used for oracular purposes.14 As against this, the younger priestly tradition makes Yahweh a permanent inhabitant of this sacred abode,15 thus retrojecting into the mythical past a belief that was an integral part of the Jerusalem-centered theology of the later monarchy, namely, that God's permanent abode was on Mount Zion, in his holy temple. II The term Shekhina does not appear in the Bible. Its first occurrence is in the Targumim, the Aramaic paraphrases of the Bible which began as an oral traditionl6 and were put into writing in the last few centuries before the Chris- tian era, in other words, some two to three centuries after the last biblical references to the mishkan, the sacred abode, in which God's glory, or God himself, was supposed to have dwelt. In the course of this time, Jewish the- ology has built new superstructures upon the biblical foundations endowing the deity, as Philo did, with male and female attributes, and supplying him, as rabbinical Judaism did, with personi- fied hypostases. This hypostatizing tendency was present, in a rudimentary form, already in the late biblical period. For example, Wisdom (hokhmah) and Intelligence (binah) are described in Job17 as a personage whose way is understood and whose place is known only by God, while Proverbs18 asserts that Wisdom was the earliest creation of God, and that ever since those pri- meval days she (Wisdom) has been God's playmate. In the Apocrypha this role of Wisdom is even more emphasized.19 A passage in the Wisdom of Solomon states that "she [Wisdom] proclaims her noble birth in that it is given to her to live with God, and the Sovereign Lord of all loved her."20 It was observed by Ger- shom Scholem that the term "symbi- osis" used in this passage appears again in the same chapter in the sense of marital connubium, and that therefore it is clear that Wisdom here was re- garded as God's wife.21 Philo states quite unequivocally that God is the husband of Wisdom.22 Wisdom (hokhmah) played an im- portant role among the Jewish Gnostics. References to the role of Wisdom in the primordial days of the world seem to indicate the existence of a gnostic 276</page><page sequence="3">THE SHEKHINA hokhmah myth which originated in Jew- ish circles and which was hypothetically reconstructed as follows: Out of the primeval Chaos God cre- ated the seven archons through the in- termediacy of his Wisdom, which was identical with the "dew of light." Wisdom now cast her eidolon, shadow- picture, upon the primeval waters of the Tohu wa-Bohu, whereupon the archons formed the world and the body of man. Man crawled about upon the earth like a worm, until Wisdom en- dowed him with spirit. Satan, in the shape of the serpent, had intercourse with Eve who thereupon bore Cain and Abel. Thus sexuality is the original sin. After the Fall, there was a fight be- tween the sons of Seth and the sons of Cain. When the daughters of Cain seduced the sons of Seth, Wisdom brought the flood upon the earth. Later, in her efforts to help mankind, Wisdom sent seven prophets, corresponding to the seven planets, from Moses to Ezra. In this myth-cycle Wisdom, acting like a female deity, is something like the anima mundi.23 Whether this myth reconstruction is or is not justified in all its details could be decided only on the basis of a thorough study of the available refer- ences in Jewish, early Christian, and gnostic sources. However, there can be little doubt as to the importance of Wisdom in Jewish gnosticism which could build its speculations on the role assigned to hokhmah in the late books of the Bible itself. While Wisdom thus had all the pre- requisites to develop into a veritable female deity, no such development took place within Judaism. Instead, post- biblical Judaism created for itself a new concept of feminine divinity in the figure of the Shekhina, who first ap- pears in the Aramaic translation- paraphrase of the Bible, the so-called Targum Onkelos, which was prepared, according to some scholars, as early as the first century A.D., while others think that it attained its final form as late as the fourth century A.D. Most of them, however, agree that the author of Targum Onkelos used an older version as the basis of his translation. III The Shekhina (sh'khinah) is an ab- stract noun derived from the biblical verb shakhan and literally meaning "the act of dwelling." It is in the nature of these abstract nouns, constructed from the three verbal root-letters with the added -ah suffix, that they have the feminine gender. In actual usage, the term Shekhina, when it first appears, means that aspect of the deity which can be apprehended by the senses. Whenever the original Hebrew biblical text speaks of a manifestation of God through which he was perceived by man, the Targum Onkelos interpolates the term Shekhina. For instance, the verse "Let them make Me a Sanctuary that I may dwell [w'shakhanti] among them"24 is rendered by the Targum Onkelos as follows: "Let them make before Me a Sanctuary that I may let My Shekhina dwell among them." The original "I will dwell [w'shakhanti] among the Children of Israel . . . that I may dwell ['shokhni] among them"25 becomes in the Targum "I will let My Shekhina dwell among the Children of Israel . . . that I may let My Shekhina dwell among them." The biblical "that they defile not their camp in whose midst I dwell"26 becomes "that they defile not their camp in whose midst 277</page><page sequence="4">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION My Shekhina dwells."27 The Targum, evidently, could not tolerate a direct reference to God even in a poetic text, and thus it paraphrases the original "He [God] found him [Israel] in a desert land. ... He compassed him about"28 as follows: "He filled their needs in a desert land. ... He let them dwell around His Shekhina." From these examples, to which many more could be added,29 it appears that the earliest use of the term Shekhina was in the sense of an abstract hypos- tasis, interpolated wherever a biblical statement appeared to be too anthropo- morphic to the greater sensitivity of the Targumim. The fact that the noun Shekhina had the feminine gender (shekhinta in Aramaic) played no role at all in these early references. In the talmudic literature, the term continued to be used in the same sense. For example, Rabbi Jehoshua, the first- and second-century Tannaite, states that the following features were en- joyed by Israel in the desert: the man- na, the quails, the well, the Tabernacle, the Shekhina, the priesthood, the king- ship and the clouds of glory.30 A tal- mudic discussion flatly equates God with the Shekhina: "Rabbi Yose (sec- ond century) said: 'Never did the Shekhina descend to earth, nor Moses and Elijah ascend to heaven.' Is it cor- rect that the Shekhina never descended to earth? Is it not written, 'And Yahweh came down upon Mount Sinai'?"31 At the same time, however, the tendency is discernible to endow the Shekhina with attributes more physical than those associated with God and thus to distinguish between the deity himself who is beyond all sense-per- ception and his tangible manifestation as the Shekhina. One passage in which this physical view of the Shekhina is expressed with great clarity is the fol- lowing: All those years that Israel were in the desert, these two caskets, one of a corpse [of Joseph] and the other of the Shekhina [containing the two stone tablets], were car- ried side by side; and the passerby would say: "What is the nature of these two cas- kets?" They would answer: "One is the cas- ket of a corpse, and the other of the She- khina." "Is it the custom that a corpse should be carried with the Shekhina?" They would answer: "This one observed what is written in the other one."32 It is evident that the presence of the Shekhina in the casket is imagined in this passage in a manner corresponding to that of Joseph's body in the other casket-both are actual, physical pres- ences. Similarly, the biblical notion that the Tabernacle was built in order to serve as a dwelling place for Yahweh is transformed in talmudic literature into the idea that both the desert sanctuary and the Solomonic Temple were the earthly abode of the Shekhina. It was the Shekhina who, according to R. Azaria in the name of R. Yehuda bar Simon, the fourth-century Palestinian Amora, dwelt in the Temple, lining it, as it were, with love.33 The notion is made tangible by R. Yehoshua of Sikhnin in the name of R. Levi, the third-to-fourth-century Pales- tinian Amora: "A simile: Like unto a cave on the seashore: when the waves rise, it fills with water, yet the sea is in no way diminished. Thus it was with the Tent of Meeting: it became filled with the glory of the Shekhina but the world was in no way diminished."34 Ac- cording to R. Joshua (end of the first century A.D.), "while the Children of Israel were still in Egypt, the Holy 278</page><page sequence="5">THE SHEKHINA One, blessed be He, stipulated that He would liberate them from Egypt only in order that they build him a Sanc- tuary so that He can let His Shekhina dwell among them.... As soon as the Tabernacle was erected, the Shekhina descended and dwelt among them." To this Rabh (the early third-century Babylonia Amora) added: "On that day a thing came about which had not existed ever since the creation of the world. From the creation of the world and up to that hour the Shekhina had never dwelt among the lower beings. But from the time that the Tabernacle was erected, she did dwell among them."35 According to another opinion, the Shekhina originally did dwell here be- low, on earth. However, when Adam sinned, she removed herself to the first heaven. When the generation of Enosh sinned, she moved up from the first to the second heaven. The sins of the generation of the Deluge caused her to withdraw to the third heaven; those of the generation of the Tower of Babel, to the fourth. When the Egyp- tians sinned in the days of Abraham, she withdrew to the fifth heaven. The sins of the Sodomites impelled her to seek refuge in the seventh heaven. When the seven righteous (Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Levi, Kehat, Amram, and Moses) arose, they brought her back down to earth step by step.36 Since the Shekhina dwelt in the Temple, any desecration of that holy place affronted her directly. When King Manasseh set up a graven image in the house of God, he did this purposely so that the Shekhina should see it and be angered.37 The physical presence of the She- khina in the Temple, or in any other place on earth, was of such a nature that it could be localized, and her move- ments from place to place followed. The classical expression of this view is the statement of R. Jehuda b. Idi in the name R. Johanan bar Nappaha (a teacher in Tiberias who died in A.D. 279), according to which the Shekhina went through the following ten stages of wandering: From the ark-cover [she moved] onto the Cherub; from the Cherub onto the other Cherub; from the second Cherub onto the threshold [of the Temple]; from the threshold into the court [of the Priests]; from the court onto the altar [in the court]; from the altar onto the roof; from the roof onto the wall; from the wall into the city [of Jerusalem]; from the city onto the mount [of Olives]; from the mount into the desert.38 Each of these stations in the wander- ings of the Shekhina took her to a place more remote than the previous one from her original dwelling place over the ark cover. It was, of course, the sins of Israel which caused the Shekhina thus to go into exile, follow- ing which she waited six months in the desert for Israel to repent. When they failed to do so, she said, "Let them perish! ,,39 According to another version, the Shekhina dwelt for three and a half years on the nearby Mount of Olives, and cried out from there three times a day: "Return, you backsliding chil- dren!"40 When all this proved futile, she began to fly around and say, "I shall go and return to My place till they acknowledge their guilt."4 IV As to the presence of the Shekhina in the second Temple, there were di- 279</page><page sequence="6">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION vided opinions. Some said that while in the first Temple the Shekhina dwelt continuously, in the second Temple she was present only intermittently.42 Some sages, like the fourth-century A.D. Palestinian Amora, Shemuel b. Inya, asserted that the Shekhina did not grace the second Temple with her presence and that this circumstance constituted one of the seven features marking the inferiority of this sanc- tuary in comparison with the first Temple.4 Rabbi Johanan, too, was of the opinion that the Shekhina did not dwell in the second Temple, the rea- son being that it was built with the aid of the sons of Japheth, that is, the Persians, and, as stated in Gen. 9:27, God only dwells in the tents of Shem, that is in a temple built by the children of Israel themselves.44 As against this view, others held that the Shekhina was present in the second Temple,45 and that, following its de- struction, she transferred to several important synagogues in Babylonia, where her presence was both visible and audible. Especially two synagogues, those of Husal and of Shaf weyatibh, had the reputation of serving as dwell- ing places for the Shekhina, however, not simultaneously but alternatingly. The Shaf weyatibh synagogue in Ne- hardea was built, according to tradi- tion, by King Yechonia and his men, using stones and dust they had brought along from Jerusalem.46 At times the Shekhina would dwell in this syna- gogue, at others in that of Husal. Once, so the story goes, Shemuel's father and Levi were sitting in the Shaf weyatibh synagogue in Nehardea, when the Shekhina appeared and they heard a noise, whereupon they got up and left. On another occasion, blind Rabh Sheshet sat in the same synagogue when the Shekhina again came, but he made no move to leave. Thereupon minister- ing angels came and began to frighten him, but he said: "Master of the World! If one is afflicted and the other is not, who is to yield?" He (i.e., the deity) spoke to them: "Let him be!"'47 As to the precise nature of the noise made by the Shekhina, another talmudic passage describes it as follows: "The Shekhina rang before him [Samson] like a bell."48 As we shall see in another context, God's approach, too, was said to have been accompanied by the tinkling of bells. In general, it was an accepted article of faith that wherever the people of Israel went into exile, the Shekhina went along with them, whether to Egypt, to Babylonia, or to Edom (Rome), and that she would remain with them at the time of their redemp- tion.49 In addition to her appearance in places of primary or secondary sanc- tity, the Shekhina also showed herself to individuals and even to animals. Ac- cording to a Palestinian view, trans- mitted to Babylonia by Rabh Dimi (early fourth century A.D.), the She- khina spoke to Adam, to the Serpent, and to the fishes, and, as a consequence of this distinction, members of these three species copulate in a face-to-face position, while all the other animals perform the sexual act face to back.50 That the Shekhina can be seen is almost a commonplace in the Midrash. The sign of the Abrahamitic covenant which the children of Israel carried on their flesh enabled them to gaze at the Shekhina; but for the circumcision, they would have fallen on their faces at her appearance.51 The two sinners, 280</page><page sequence="7">THE SHEKHINA Nadab and Abihu, we read, "feasted their eyes on the Shekhina, but had no enjoyment from her; Moses, on the other hand, did not feast his eyes on her, but enjoyed her."52 Already as a babe Moses was joined by the Shekhina. When the daughter of Pharaoh found the ark of bulrushes into which he had been placed by his mother, and opened it, she saw the Shekhina in it.53 Of all men, Moses was the only one to whom the Shekhina spoke "every hour with- out setting a time in advance." There- fore, in order to be always in a state of ritual purity and readiness to receive a communication from the She- khina, Moses separated himself com- pletely from his wife.54 The Shekhina joins the sick to com- fort them55 and helps those who are in need.56 Moreover, she has special con- cern for the repentant sinners of Israel: these "are accepted by the Shekhina as if they were righteous and pious persons who never sinned. . . . They are carried aloft and seated next to the Shekhina.... He whose heart is broken and whose spirit is low, and whose mouth rarely utters a word, the She- khina walks with him every day."57 Good deeds, even if performed by idola- tors, attract the Shekhina: when the prophets of the Baal practiced hospi- tality, the Shekhina came down and rested upon them.58 If husband and wife are worthy and deserving, the Shekhina rests between them.59 On the other hand, Rabh Abin bar R. Ada, the Babylonian Amora of the third and fourth centuries, in the name of Rabh said: "He who marries a woman not suitable for him, when God lets his Shekhina rest, he will give testi- mony concerning all the tribes, but him.",60 A different view of the Shekhina shows her as being attracted by aes- thetic and aristocratic qualities: "The Shekhina rests only on him who is wise, heroic, rich and tall of stature."6' R. Johanan bar Nappaha (died A.D. 279) enumerated a very similar list of excel- lences as attracting the Shekhina: "God lets His Shekhina rest only on him who is heroic, rich, wise and modest."62 Ac- cording to yet another passage, "the Shekhina rests only where there is no sadness, no sloth, no laughter, no levity, no loquacity (or: merriment) and no senseless chatter, but only where there is rejoicing over the fulfillment of a commandment."63 And, finally, R. Hama b. R. Hanina, the Palestinian Amora of the third century, said: "When God lets His Shekhina rest, He will let her rest only on the noble fami- lies in Israel."64 Lest one think that the Shekhina was thought of as ranking merely with the angels, we adduce a few passages which emphasize her superiority to them: The splendor of the Shekhina feeds the ministering angels. Her radiance, how- ever, is so great that the angels must cover their faces with their wings so as not to see her.65 The ministering angels are removed from the Shekhina by myriads of parasangs, and the body of the Shekhina herself measures millions of miles.66 These ideas are complementary with- out being contradictory: on the one hand, the Shekhina can be so small as to find place in the Tabernacle or even in the small ark of bulrushes next to the child Moses; on the other, her size overshadows the world. A midrash neatly reconciles the two ideas: The emperor said to Rabban Gamaliel: "You say that wherever ten men are assem- 281</page><page sequence="8">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION bled, the Shekhina dwells among them. How many Shekhinas are there?" Thereupon Rab- ban Gamaliel beckoned the servant and began to beat him [saying]: "Why did the sun enter the emperor's house?" "[Nonsense]," said the emperor, "the sun shines all over the world!" "If the sun," answered Gamaliel, "which is only one of a thousand myriad servants of God shines all over the world, how much more so the Shekhina of God!"67 The problem of how to reconcile the omnipresence of the Shekhina with her "dwelling" in the sanctuary was solved in a different manner by R. Johanan bar Nappaha by the introduction of the concept of "contraction" of which the Kabbala was later to make extensive use in its cosmogony. Johanan explained that when Moses heard God say "Let them make Me a Sanctuary,"68 he was frightened by what he assumed would be a task of immense magnitude, be- cause he knew that even the "heaven and the Heaven of heavens cannot con- tain" God.69 But God reassured him that a small tabernacle would, indeed, be sufficient for him: "I shall descend and contract my Shekhina between them [the planks of the Tabernacle] down below."70 V These and many other similar pas- sages clearly demonstrate a pronounced tendency to personify the Shekhina and to conceive of her as a manifestation of the deity in a lower form, suitable to be perceived by the human senses. This Shekhina is the direct heir of the biblical cloud of glory which dwelt in the sanctuary and was the visible mani- festation of Yahweh's presence in his house. There is as yet no indication in any of these passages of the Shekhina being considered a divine entity sepa- rate from God to the extent of being apposable to him. However, in view of the mystical dualistic theosophy of Philo and the Cherubim symbolism of the second Temple,71 it was inevitable that the step from regarding the She- khina as the manifestation of God to seeing in her a discrete divine entity should be taken. The earliest evidence that it was dates from the end of the third century A.D. Before presenting the passage in question, a word has to be said about the relationship of the two talmudic concepts of the Shekhina and of the "Holy Spirit." As A. Marmorstein has convincingly shown, these two concepts were used synonymously in the talmudic period.72 When, therefore, a talmudic teacher speaks of the Holy Spirit, he may as well have used the term She- khina. With this in mind, let us quote a saying of R. Aha, a Galilean teacher, who lived circa A.D. 300: "The Holy Spirit comes to the de- fense [of sinful Israel by] saying first to Israel: 'Be not a witness against thy neighbor without a cause,'73 and there- after saying to God: 'Say not: I will do so to him as he hath done to me.' "74 This passage has great significance in the historical development of the Jewish God-concept. We have here a very early testimony as to the idea that the "Holy One, blessed be He" or God, and the Shekhina, or Holy Spirit, are two separate and discrete divine en- tities. The Holy Spirit is said here to have admonished God not to practice retribution and to refrain from punish- ing Israel. She ("she," because the "Holy Spirit," like the Shekhina, is feminine) was, therefore, considered to have an opinion, a mind, a will, and a personality of her own. She is ap- 282</page><page sequence="9">century, warned that one must care- fully refrain from implying a divine plurality even inadvertently in trans- lating biblical passages which contain references to the physical appearance of God: Rabbi Eliezer said: He who translates a Biblical verse literally is a liar, and he who adds to it is a blasphemer. For instance, if he translates the [Hebrew] verse "And they saw the God of Israel"78 [into Aramaic]: "And they saw the God of Israel," he is a liar, for the Holy One, blessed be He, sees but cannot be seen. If, however, he translates "And they saw the glory of the Shekhina of the God of Israel," he blasphemes because he makes here three [i.e., instead of one God he refers to three deities], namely Glory, and Shekhina, and God. What "And they saw the God of Israel" means is that their eyes were fed by the splendor of the Shekhina.79 R. Eliezer here objects to both the literal translation of biblical anthropo- morphic expressions and their para- phrase by the interpolation of such terms as "Glory" and "Shekhina." The basis of his objection to the first method is that it makes it appear as if God could directly be apprehended by hu- man sense organs, which, of course, is untrue with reference to a purely spir- itual deity. His objection to the second method must stem from the experience or knowledge that his contemporaries tended to regard such expressions as "Glory" and "Shekhina" as designa- tions for discrete deities. While R. Eliezer considered such a view as blas- phemous, others, as we have seen above, saw nothing exceptionable in it, at least as far as the Shekhina was concerned. While those passages establish the Shekhina as a separate divine person- ality, they indicate in no way her femininity except by the grammatical gender of her name. It should be em- phasized, however, that both in Hebrew posed to God and tries to influence him.75 The Shekhina plays a similar role in another passage which is of consider- ably later provenance. It is found in Midrash Mishle, whose late age is in- dicated by the fact that the first to quote it was R. Hananel (died A.D. 1050). In it we read: When the Sanhedrin wanted to add him [King Solomon] to the three kings and four commoners [who had no share in the world to come], Shekhina rose up before the Holy One, blessed be He, and said: "Master of the Worlds! Seest Thou a man diligent ... ? They want to count him among 'mean men.'" In that hour, a divine voice was heard saying to them: "Let him stand before Kings, let him not stand before mean men!"76 A clear-cut differentiation between God and the Shekhina is made by Moshe Hadarshan, the early eleventh- century midrashist of Narbonne, in his Bereshit Rabbati when he says, in the name of Rabbi Akiba (the second- century A.D. Tanna), that "when the Holy One, blessed be He, considered the deeds of the generation [of Enoch] and saw that they were spoiled and evil, He removed Himself and His Shekhina from their midst and ascended into the heights with blasts of trum- pets."77 VI Although three passages may be con- sidered rather meager evidence, they are sufficient to establish that the ideas of two separate divine entities did exist in talmudic times and that there were at least some teachers who saw nothing exceptionable in it. Others, however, took a different view, and op- posed any implication of such a plural- ity, thereby adding indirect evidence to the existence of such beliefs. R. Eliezer, the Palestinian Amora of the third THE SHEKHINA 283</page><page sequence="10">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION and Aramaic the gender of the subject plays a much greater role in the sen- tence structure than in Indo-European languages. In English, for instance, one can say, as in the last quoted pas- sage, "The Shekhina rose up . . . and said," without becoming aware at all of the gender of "the Shekhina." In Semitic languages the verb (as well as the adjective) has separate male and female forms; in the sentence "the She- khina rose up ... and said," therefore, both verbs impress the reader (or hear- er) with the femininity of the Shekhina by having themselves the feminine forms. Thus, even without any explicit pronouncement to the effect that the Shekhina was a female deity, her sex was kept in the forefront of conscious- ness by every statement made about her. In Midrashic homilies the talmudic sages allowed themselves considerable latitude in throwing light on the mys- tery of the deity by comparing him to human beings of both sexes. The fol- lowing passage can serve as an ex- ample. "Rabbi Shemuel bar Nahman (a Palestinian Amora of the third and fourth centuries) said: "It is the wont of the father to have mercy, 'Like as a father has compassion upon his chil- dren, so has the Lord compassion upon them that fear Him';s and it is the wont of the mother to comfort, 'As one whom his mother comforts, so will I comfort you.'81 God said: 'I shall do as both father and mother.' ,"82 It is, of course, a far cry from saying that God acts like a father and a mother to as- serting, as Philo did,83 that he has two components, a fatherly and a motherly. Yet the Shekhina, with her feminine gender, comes quite close, already in talmudic times, to being regarded as a feminine manifestation of the deity. The following passages, for instance, definitely point in that direction: R. Aha (Palestinian Amora of the early fourth century) said: When the Shekhina left the Sanctuary, she returned to caress and kiss its walls and columns, and cried and said: "Be in peace, 0 my Sanctuary, be in peace, 0 my royal palace, be in peace, 0 my precious house, be in peace from now on, be in peace!"84 In another passage it is the Com- munity of Israel (Knesseth Yisrael, also of feminine gender) who laments over the destruction of the Temple: The Community of Israel said before the Holy One, blessed be He: "Master of the World! I remember the safety, the security and the peace which I used to enjoy, and now it all departed from me. And I cry and lament and say, 0, if I could return to the former years when the Sanctuary stood, and when you used to come down into it from the high heavens, and let your Shekhina rest on me. And the nations of the world would praise me. And when I would seek forgive- ness for my sins, you would answer me. But now I am covered with shame and disgrace." And she also said before Him: "Master of the World! My heart breaks in me when I pass by your house and it is destroyed, and the voice of silence is in it and says: The place in which Abraham's seed presented sacrifices before you, and the priests stood on their platform, and the Levites intoned praise on their harps, how can it be that now foxes dance in it?! . . . But what can I do, since my sins brought this about, and the false prophets who arose in me led me astray from the way of life to the way of death ...." When the Temple was destroyed by fire, the Holy One, blessed be He, said: "Now that I have no seat on earth, I shall remove my Shekhina from her [the earth] and shall ascend to my first abode. .. ." In that hour the Holy One, blessed be He, cried and said: "Woe to me, what did I do, I let my Shekhina dwell below for the sake of Israel, and now that they sinned, I returned to my first place. ... I became a laughter unto the nations and a derision to the creatures." In that hour Metatron came, fell upon his face, 284</page><page sequence="11">Shekhina. The punitive aspect of the Shekhina, closely paralleled by the cruel aspect of the ancient Near East- ern love-goddesses, was to play an im- portant role in the Kabbalistic figure of the Shekhina-Matronit. A mixture of the punitive and the merciful aspects of the Shekhina ap- pears in the midrashim which attribute to her the function of taking the souls of exceptionally meritorious men. There were six individuals, we read in the Talmud, whom the Angel of Death could not overcome, and who died through a kiss of the Shekhina; they were Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.88 According to another passage, it was God who took the soul of one of them, Moses, by kissing him on his mouth.89 After Moses died, the Shekhina carried him four miles on her wings to the place where he was to be buried.90 Since Moses is said to have given up all carnal contact with his wife so as to be always ready to receive com- munication from the Shekhina, it seems probable that a notion clearly stated in the Zohar was present in a rudimentary form already in talmudic times: this is the idea that the relationship be- tween Moses and the Shekhina was like that of husband and wife.9l If so, there is an interesting parallel between the Shekhina carrying her dead husband, Moses, to his burial place, and the Ugaritic myth about Anath carrying the body of her husband-brother, Baal, to his burial place.92 VII We have followed in this paper the development of the Shekhina concept from its early targumic beginnings in the first or second century B.C. to the stage it reached a thousand years later, and addressed God: "Master of the World! Let me cry in Your place!" But God an- swered him: "If you do not let me cry now, I shall retire to a place into which you have no permission to enter, and shall cry there. . ." [Thereafter] God said to the minister- ing angels: "Come, let us descend, I and you, and see what the enemy did to my house...." When God saw the Sanctuary, He said: "Verily, this is my house, and this is my resting place, into which the enemy entered and did what he wanted." And God cried and said: "Woe to me because of my House! My sons, where are you? My priests, where are you? My lovers, where are you? What shall I do to you? I warned you but you did not repent."85 That the Shekhina is the love aspect of God is clearly stated in a parable which compares the Temple to Solo- mon's palanquin: just as the latter was inlaid with love, so did the Shekhina fill the sanctuary.86 While the Shekhina is thus unmis- takably the love aspect of God, she also represents the divine punitive power. This is most succinctly expressed in a Tannaitic passage which states that on ten occasions did the Shekhina descend from on high: after the Fall, when she entered the Garden of Eden to punish Adam, Eve, and the Serpent; when she confused the builders of the Tower of Babel; when she destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah; when she saved the children of Israel from the Egyptian slavery; when she drowned the Egyptians in the Sea of Reeds; when she appeared on Mount Sinai; when she led the Chil- dren of Israel in the pillar of cloud; when she entered the Sanctuary; and once more she will descend in the fu- ture in the days of the battle of Gog and Magog.87 Although the above list enumerates only nine (and not ten) descents-one evidently got lost while the tradition still circulated orally-it is interesting to note that five of the nine are punitive expeditions of the THE SHEKHINA 285</page><page sequence="12">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION just prior to its being taken up by Kab- balism and made into one of the funda- mentals of its mystical theosophy. At first, it seems, the Shekhina served merely as a convenient means of solv- ing the problem presented by biblical anthropomorphisms in the eyes of a later, more sensitive theology. By inter- posing the Shekhina, it was no longer God himself who was said to have acted in a human-like manner, but his "pres- ence" which, evidently, was conceived as something akin to a "presence" manifesting itself in a spiritualist's seance, a barely visible indication of what is acknowledged to be pure spirit and therefore not apprehensible by the senses. Before long, however, this spiritual "presence" began to take on substance. Her movements from place to place could now be discerned, and, having acquired a physical aspect, she became subject to historical events: more and more closely joined to the fate of Is- rael, she suffered their vicissitudes; ac- companied them into their exiles; and experienced the emotions, the despairs and the hopes, with which Israel re- acted to the blows dealt her by fate, or, as the Sages of the Talmud would have put it, took her share in the pun- ishments meted out by God to his sin- ful people. In this capacity the She- khina was very close to becoming iden- tified with the Knesseth Yisrael, the personified, female "Community of Israel." Next, almost inadvertently, as the distance between God and the Shekhina grew, the latter took on increasingly pronounced physical attributes. The more impossible it became to think of God himself in anthropomorphic terms, the more the Shekhina became human- ized. She now could not only be seen but also heard, and, having found her voice, it was inevitable that she should speak not only to men but also to God. Once she was allowed to do this, there was no longer any doubt that the deity was considered as comprising two per- sons: God and the Shekhina. In a plural concept of the godhead there was nothing strange, let alone heretical, in biblical times. Most of the nations in whose midst Israel dwelt recognized divine pluralities, and old Hebrew myth saw nothing remarkable in the fact that Yahweh appeared to Abraham in the shape of three men who, however, were unhesitatingly recognized by Abraham as one person. The narrative is masterly in conveying the mystery of this three-in-one deity by changing back and forth between plural and singular,93 to which has to be added the further mystery of the unexplained change-over of the "three men" into "two angels" by the time they reached Sodom, and their contra- dictory identification as Yahweh's mes- sengers.94 Philo's theosophic discern- ment of the two aspects of the deity95 is, in fact, not too far removed from this old biblical indeterminacy as far as the number of persons in the deity is concerned, nor is the talmudic postu- lation of God and the Shekhina as two divine entities. Philo assigned masculinity to one and femininity to the other aspect of the godhead. Such a step was never taken by talmudic Judaism, or, at least, such a thought was never formulated or ex- pressed, until the days of the Kabbala. Yet the very fact that all the names of God (Yahweh; Elohim; the Holy One, blessed be He; etc.) were masculine, while the name "Shekhina" was femi- 286</page><page sequence="13">nine (as were the other manifestations sexual differentiation, which came of the deity, such as the Holy Spirit, about, as it was bound to, with the the Memra, Wisdom, etc.), inevitably great medieval mystical movement of pointed in the direction of such a the Kabbala.

Prov. 24:29; Lev. Rab. 6.1. 75. Since the passage in Lev. Rab. 6.1., quoted above, speaks of the "Holy Spirit," and not the Shekhina, Gershom Scholem is technically correct when stating that Midrash Mishle (see below) contains the first and only midrashic reference to a differentiation between God and the Shekhina. Cf. Scholem, "Zur Entwicklungsgeschichte der kabba- listischen Konzeption der Schechinah," Eranos Jahrbuch, XXI (1952), 59. In substance, however, he is in error, because, as pointed out above, the differentiation between God and the Holy Spirit, found in Lev. Rab. 6.1., is essentially identical with a differentiation between God and the Shekhina. 76. Midrash Mishle ed. Buber, p. 47a, quoting Prov. 22:29; cf.

Bereshit Rabbati, ed. Albech. p. 27.
