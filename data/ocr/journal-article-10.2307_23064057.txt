<plain_text><page sequence="1">1 The First Fragment of Heraclitus LEONARDO TARAN The interpretation of Heraclitus will always remain controversial. The main reasons are his peculiar mode of expression, the fragmen tary character of the evidence, and the very way ancient authors quoted his sayings. If progress is still to be made, it is necessary to discuss the arguments given in support of one or another interpre tation in order to determine in each case what is probable, what is merely possible, and what is unlikely or impossible. Such a discussion should contribute to clarify the points on which scholarly opinion is likely to differ and to eliminate poor and irrelevant arguments. The following analysis of Heraclitus' first fragment has been prompted, among other things, by the preceding considerations. The fragments will be cited according to the numbers in the B section of chapter 22 of Diels-Kranz, Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker.1 For the sake of brevity my discussion takes its starting point from, and presupposes knowledge of, the commentaries of Kirk2 and of Marcovich.8 This explains the prominent character of my disagreements with these 1 I refer to the 6th edition, 3 vols., Berlin 1951-52.

Yet the matter is not so easily disposed of. For one thing, such connectives are sometimes added for no reason at all. Moreover, in this case, the variant may be due to a scribal mistake. For it is possible that the first rovbt in TOTAEAOrOTTOTAEONTOS was caused by dittography. On the other hand, bt is omitted both by Aristotle and by Clement, who does not depend on Aristotle,8 and there is no reason to think that they both purposely omitted this word. Such an omission would more probably be due to scribes. Consequently, it seems to be just as likely that Heraclitus wrote tov bt Xoyov as that he wrote to0 Xoyov. If I have printed the latter reading, it is only to call attention to the fact that the prevailing opinion is not as certainly right as its proponents believe it to be. And hereafter whenever I cite tov Xoyov as the reading at the beginning of our text, it is with the understanding that Heraclitus may well have written tov bi Xoyov. If tov bi Xoyov is the correct reading, then bt is either connective or inceptive. The latter possibility is that preferred by most recent scholars.9 However, even now there are some who believe that bt is connective and that in what preceded frag. 1 Heraclitus must have given a hint as to what he meant by this Logos.10 This last contention seems to me more than doubtful," and even if the bt is connective, it is likely, given the statements of Aristotle and of Sextus cited above, that not much preceded our text.12 On the other hand, if Heraclitus wrote tov Xoyov, it is likely that those words came at the very beginning of his treatise, and the same is true if bt is the right reading and is inceptive.13 8 This ought to be obvious, since Clement's citation is longer than Aristotle's. Cf. e.g. Gigon, p. 1, Verdenius, op. cit. (note 5 supra), pp. 274-75; Kirk, p. 36. 10 Cf. e.g. M. L. West, Early Greek Philosophy and the Orient (Oxford 1971), pp. 114-15. 11 West (cf. note 10 supra) cites with approval Diels' suggestion that something like 'Hpa/tXaro? 'E&lt;piaio&lt;; rait \iya preceded frag. 1. But he does so on the assumption, shared by others (cf. e.g. Burnet, p. 133 with n. 1), that 6 X0701; SHe refers to Heraclitus' own discourse. Yet it was because of this that Reinhardt, p. 217, n. 1 rejected the &amp;c, for there are strong reasons for thinking that in frag. 1 Logos cannot primarily mean Heraclitus' discourse or doctrine (cf. the concluding remarks of this paper). However, Reinhardt did not consider the possibility that the 5'e may be merely inceptive. 12 It is hardly likely that either Aristotle or Sextus' source, who knew the relative collocations of the present fragments 1 and 2 (cf. note 37 infra), would have said that what they cite of frag. 1 came at the beginning of Heraclitus' book if a long and/or important statement had preceded. 13 For inceptive cf. Ion of Chios 36 B 1 apxv &amp; roO Xoyov and Kirk, p. 36.</page><page sequence="4">4 Illinois Classical Studies, XI A more fundamental question is the construction of aiei. Aristotle cited the first words of our fragment precisely to illustrate his point that it is difficult to "punctuate" (Stacrrt^at) the text of Heraclitus, since it is unclear (adrjXov) whether aiei goes with what precedes or with what follows it.14 Modern scholars are not agreed on this: some take aiei with eovroq, while others attach it to a^vveToi. Prominent among the latter are Reinhardt, Snell, Kranz, Kirk, and Marcovich.15 Their main argument is (i) that aiei leading up to Kal... Kai is an archaic figure typical of Heraclitus' style. To this Marcovich has added two arguments: (ii) In aid a^vveroi yivovrai. avdpuiroi— in contrast to the rhythmical unit tov 8e Xoyov tov8' tovroq— - there is an intentional alliteration a-a-g-a; (iii) The construction of aiei with eovToq is a lectio facilior prompted by the influence of the epic formula aiev eovreq (Homer, II. I. 290, etc.). Now the second argument may be dismissed with the remark that it begs the question, since it simply assumes that Heraclitus meant aiei to go with a^weroi. Moreover, the allit eration alleged by Marcovich is of no significance as it is vowel alliteration only. The third argument implies a misuse of the notion of lectio facilior, but I postpone its discussion for later. As for the first argument, it is anything but decisive, aid followed and taken up by Kal... Kai is a normal construction in archaic and in later Greek, but so is also the use of Kal.. . Kai in the sense "both . . . and," even without a preceding aid. The essential point that must still be established is whether here Heraclitus intended aid to be taken up by Kal. . . Kai. I submit that there are strong reasons for thinking that he did not. However, before we go into this question, it is convenient to determine what would be the likely meaning of tov Xoyov tovS' eovTot;, if aid goes with a^vveroL. For, given Aristotle's statement mentioned above, one must acknowledge that the construction of aiei with what follows it must be possible, and hence that the construction tov Xoyov ro05' eovToq must also be so. Of those who take aiei with what follows, Kranz, Kirk, and others16 take tov8' as predicative: "The Logos being this." But in that case one would have expected toiovS' instead of tovS', or, at the very least, the tovS' to come after and not before eovToq. Kirk argues that the fact that in the next sentence Tovbe is not predicative in Kara tov Xoyov Tovbe "does not tell against its predicative 14 Cf. Aristotle, Rhetoric 1407 B 14-15 and 17-18. 15 Reinhardt, pp. 217-18; A. Busse, Rheinisches Museum 75 (1926), 206-07; B.

The probability then is that tov6' is attributive, and it is so interpreted by Marcovich and others.18 In that case, one must take iovroq existentially and probably having concessive force: "This Logos, existent, or real though it is."19 This meaning gives a reasonable sense, but it consid erably weakens the force of the whole first sentence of the fragment, especially when it is compared to the sense yielded by that sentence when aiei is construed with eovroq. One of the main objections against taking aiei with a^vveroi is that the former word, prominently emphatic here, and important for Heraclitus, as frag. B 30 shows (r/v aiei Kal eanv kcu earai),20 would be almost otiose. Its omission would not at all affect what he is saying, since Kal ■Kp'oaOev fj aKovaai Kal otKovaavrtc, to irpurov would suffice to convey the notion that men fail to understand the Logos both before and after they have heard it. There would be only slightly more emphasis if aiei were taken up by Kal... Kai. Kirk himself unwittingly betrays the weakness of taking aiei with what follows when he states that aiei with eovroc, makes sense "and expresses something that Heraclitus believed" but that "it is to be rejected only on the ground that aiei goes rather with a^weroi."2' Moreover, since Heraclitus says that men are uncomprehending both before they have heard the Logos and after they have heard it, it makes better sense to take aiei with eovroq. For, unless the assertion is made that this Logos exists always, that it is always present in the universe, that is, also before men have heard it22 from Heraclitus, it would be pointless to reproach 17 Kirk, p. 35. 18 Cf. P. Tannery, Pour I'histoire de la science hellene2 (Paris 1930), p. 198; Reinhardt, p. 217, SneW, Hermes 61 (1926), 365-66 = GesammelteSchriften, pp. 139-40; Marcovich1, p. 9 = Marcovich2, p. 9. 19 The meanings "existent" and "real" are frequently connected with each other and with the meaning "true." In the present case the. last mentioned meaning is also possible, if by "true" we understand what is the case in the sense of what is real; but the meaning "true" as the opposite of "false" is, I believe, impossible. Cf. Busse (above, note 15), pp. 205-06. 20 In 22 B 30 one must punctuate with a colon after «rraa, cf. Kirk, p. 310 with references. 21 Kirk, p. 35. 22 This to my mind is a decisive reason for rejecting those interpretations which, like West's (op. cit. in note 10 supra, pp. 115 and 116), take b X0705 to mean "This discourse of mine." If that were Heraclitus' meaning, then he would be blaming men only for not understanding the Logos after they have heard it. But the fragment as</page><page sequence="6">6 Illinois Classical Studies, XI them for not knowing it even before they had so heard it.23 Finally, with tovToq aid Heraclitus in all probability meant his readers and/ or hearers to recall the epic formula aitv tovroc, used of the traditional gods,24 and the similar use of ati by Pherecydes (7 B 1 Zaq fitv Kal Xpovoi; rjcrav atl Kal Xdovit]) and perhaps by other authors of cosmo gonies. Marcovich contends that (in Heraclitus) to take aid with tovroc, is a lectio facilior,;25 but this is really a misapplication of a valid principle of textual criticism. There a variant reading is considered to be a lectio facilior when it can be explained as an intentional change from a reading that is more difficult to understand. In the present case, however, it is most improbable that Heraclitus placed aid next to eoPToi; without intending his readers and/or hearers to recall the formula of immortality applied to the gods of traditional Greek mythology.26 And if he intended to allude to this formula, it was in order to suggest that it is the impersonal Logos, in accordance with which all things happen in the universe, that is eternal and not the traditional, anthropomorphic gods. And there is other evidence of Heraclitus' hostility to anthropomorphism and to traditional Greek mythological thought.27 The preceding are, I submit, valid reasons for thinking that Heraclitus meant aid to go with iovToq. If this is so, it is surely noteworthy that, with the exception of Aristotle, the extant ancient authors who in citing or alluding to this part of the fragment make it clear how they construe aiti, all took this word with iovToq. They are Clement, Amelius, Hippolytus, and perhaps Cleanthes.28 It must a whole and other relevant evidence (cf. e.g. 22 B 2, 17, 34, 50, etc.) show that Heraclitus supposed that men could understand the universe by themselves, since he blames them for not doing so. 23 This second argument has been rightly emphasized by Gigon, p. 6; Verdenius, op. cit. (note 5 supra), p. 279; H. Cherniss, Selected Papers (Leiden, 1977), p. 16, n. 13. 24 Cf. Homer, II. I. 290, 494, XXIV. 99; Odyssey I. 263; Hesiod, Theog. 21, 33; Op. 718. 25 Cf. Marcovich1, p. 9 = Marcovich2, p. 10. 26 The notion that aid can go both with iovroq and with a£werot (cf. e.g. Gigon, p. 2) must be rejected. Such an am kowov construction is impossible here, since in reading the text we would have to make a pause either after eovroq or after aid. This is precisely the point Aristotle makes when he cites the first few words of our fragment. His testimony is incompatible with Gigon's suggestion. 27 Cf. 22 B 5, 15, 30, 40, 42, 53, 56, 57, 62, 67, 104, etc. 28 That Clement took aid with lovTot; is clear from the way he cites the fragment (Strom. V. 111,7 [II, pp. 401-02 Stahlin]): am/cpv? &amp;( 'o juIf llpanXaro^ "tov Xoyov tovS' ebuToq aid," &lt;t&gt;r\a'w, "a^vvtroi kt\." Hippolytus for his part precedes the citation of B 1 with the words (Ref. IX. 9. 3 [p. 241, Wendland]) Sri Si Xoyoq eWiv ad to irav Kal Sia irai/ra; cue, ovTuq Xeya. Amelius, cited by Eusebius, Praeparatio Evangelica XI. 19. 1 (II,</page><page sequence="7">Leonardo Taran 7 also be said that, contrary to what is sometimes asserted,29 Aristotle does not state, nor necessarily imply, either, that the ambiguity of aid is incurable. For Aristotle was not concerned with analyzing the part of Heraclitus' statement he quotes. He was merely trying to find an example of ambiguity in "punctuation"30 in connection with the general rule "that a written composition should be easy to read and therefore easy to deliver; for it is the same thing."31 But this rule is violated when there are many connectives, "or where the punctuation is difficult, as in the writings of Heraclitus."32 He claims, after citing the beginning of Heraclitus' first fragment, that it is unclear (adr^Xov) whether aid goes with what precedes or with what follows it.33 Hence for Aristotle the very fact that two constructions of aid are possible suffices to make the construction aht)Xov and therefore difficult to read and to deliver, for we would have to stop and think and give arguments in favor or against one or the other construction.34 However, that something is abi)Xov means simply that it is not self evident or obvious; it does not necessarily follow that Aristotle himself, if that had been his purpose, would not have been able to decide in favor of one of the two possibilities he mentions. In other words, Aristotle is recommending that we write in such a way as to avoid all possible ambiguity, a rule he himself not infrequently violated. The next point is to decide how the initial genitive should be construed. Those who take aid with what follows, however they construe the words tov5' iovToq, take tov Xoyov as an objective genitive depending on a^weroL. Even some of those who take aid with eovToq also take the initial genitive to depend upon a^vcexoi, while taking ibvTOi~ aid as modifying tov Xoyov tovS'.35 However, if one takes aid with eovToq, there are good reasons for taking tov Xoyov Tovh' ioi&gt;Toc, p. 45 [Mras]), says: kcu oStoq apa r/n o X0701; KaO' dp cu'tl ovra ra yivbptva iyivtro, o&gt;$ av Koii 0 'Hp&amp;k\(ito&lt;; afraaat kt\. As for Cleanthes, if in line 21 of his Hymn to Zeus we read ahjO' yiyvtoOat ttocvtwu Xoyov aiev iovTot (cf. G. Zuntz, Harvard Studies in Classical Philology 63 [1958], p. 303), it is likely that he there had Heraclitus in mind and that he read aid with tbvroq in 22 B 1. 23 Cf. e.g. Calogero, Gior. Crit. della Filos. Ital. 17 (1936), 196. 30 Given the context, with biaari^ai Aristotle seems to mean some sort of dot or stop to be made at appropriate places of a text in order to facilitate the reading of it. Cf. also note 26 supra. 31 Aristotle, Rhetoric 1407 B 11-12. 32 Aristotle, Rhetoric 1407 B 12-14.

In the first place, the assertion of the perpetual existence of the Logos acquires emphasis from the beginning, and greater prominence is given to the state of ignorance in which men live. Secondly, the word ai-vveroi, which for Heraclitus, as Kirk himself says,36 has a positive meaning and which he employs in another fragment (B 34) in a similar way ("ignoramuses"), would be used here too in an absolute, derogatory, and not merely negative sense. According to the testimony of Sextus, the second fragment of Heraclitus in Diels' edition came soon after the first.37 If in the latter ctiei was meant to be taken with iovroc,, and if the whole initial genitive is absolute, then there is a striking parallel between roO Xoyov ro05' tovToc, aiti and roO Xoyov 5' eovroc, £vvov in 22 B 2, which is certainly a genitive absolute.38 It is in fact possible, perhaps even likely, that the first part of Heraclitus' book contained a series of predicates of the Logos, in the genitive absolute, followed by contrasting statements in which men's failure to understand was emphasized.39 Two additional questions concerning the first sentence are the meaning of the present yivourai and of to irpurov. To begin with the latter, in all probability here it means "once" rather than "for the first time."40 For it is Heraclitus' point that men are uncomprehending both before they have heard the Logos and also after they have heard it, not merely that they fail to understand it when they hear it for the first time. This latter meaning would leave open the possibility of men's understanding the Logos when they hear it for the second or third time, etc., and such a meaning is precluded by the rest of this fragment as well as by the rest of the related evidence.41 As for yivovrai, it is taken by Verdenius, who in this is followed by Kirk,42 as implying result: "men's coming across the Logos results in incomprehension." This meaning is possible but not necessary, and I doubt that it was here intended by Heraclitus. He thought that all 36 Cf. Kirk, p. 34. 37 Sextus (Adv. Math. VII. 133), having cited B 1 and having commented on it, says: oXiya irpoadu\6i&gt;v iin&lt;t&gt;tpa, and then quotes B 2. 38 I should like to emphasize that I do not base my interpretation of B 1 on the parallelism between B 1 and B 2, as some scholars do (cf. e.g. Gigon, p. 3). 39 Cf. 22 B 2. 40 Cf. Kirk, p. 34 with his reference to LSJ, s.v. Ille. 41 Both in this fragment and elsewhere (cf. e.g. 22 B 2, 17, 34, etc.) Heraclitus speaks of men's failure to understand as characteristic of the human condition. 42 Verdenius, op. cit. (note 5 supra), pp. 279-80; Kirk, p. 40.</page><page sequence="9">Leonardo Taran 9 men live in a common world, but that they fail to see the common law and system of the universe (cf. 22 B 1 14, 2, 30 , 894S); that is, they fail to see how things are related to one another and, hence, do not apprehend the Logos. Therefore, I think it preferable to take a^vveToi yivovrai to denote the state of ignorance in which men live despite the fact that the Logos is always there and that Heraclitus explains it to them. Like the above mentioned scholars, I see no contrast between eivai and yiyvtoOai implied in this fragment, as Gigon thinks there is.44 The purpose of the fragment's second sentence is not so much to explain the state of ignorance in which men live as to justify Heraclitus' assertion to that effect. It begins with a concessive genitive absolute, which tells us that "though all things happen according to this Logos," men are like people of no experience (aireipoiinv), i.e. they are ignorant. I believe the next participle, -xtipuntvoi, is temporal-con cessive rather than purely concessive,45 and not frequentative, as Diels and Marcovich, among others, take it.46 It is not the case that men are like the inexperienced each time they experience words and deeds such as Heraclitus explains. Rather, though all things happen according to this Logos, men are like the inexperienced even when they experience (i.e. are acquainted with) words and deeds such as Heraclitus explains. In other words, that men are ignorant before they have heard the discourse of Heraclitus is bad enough; but it is much worse that they continue to live in ignorance and fail to understand even when they become acquainted with Heraclitus' doctrine, for in this last case they had the opportunity to compare Heraclitus' statements with the facts, as all things happen according to this Logos. The word-play airtipoioiv-irtipuiitvoi is most probably intentional, as are the similar ones in 22 B 2, 28, 48, 114, etc. According to Kirk, "in the present case it is simply a stylistic trick and can imply no underlying connexion of sense between the similar word-forms, for the connexion is quite obvious."47 Yet it is difficult to agree that because a connection is quite obvious the word-play must be simply a stylistic trick and nothing more than that. The word-play here does convey the implication that men, though acquainted not only with 43 In B 89, at least the first part is, pace Kirk, authentic, cf.

Other fragments, too, stress men's characteristic inability to understand;48 but here, in 22 B 1, the point is made that if one fails to understand the Logos, then one cannot really possess any true experience, which among other things requires repetition and memory, memory of the connection between the things that constitute a single experience.49 Similarly, men may become acquainted (weip&amp;nevoi) with Heraclitus' doctrine more than once but they still fail to understand, and so are like the inexperienced. To my mind this is the reason why in this context the word onreipoq was used for "ignorant." In fact, this fragment, not mentioned by Liddell-Scott-Jones, s.v. aivtipot; (A), is evidence of the connection between the literal meaning "without trial or experience" and the absolute sense "inexperienced," "ignorant." The words iirtwv Kal epycov were probably meant to recall the epic formula eiroc, Kal epyov. Kirk says that in Heraclitus "the words are the means of explanation, the deeds or events are the things which are explained."50 This is true, but only up to a point. For there is here an implication that men could see the Logos in language itself even apart from their hearing it from Heraclitus. Now Heraclitus believes that his doctrine is instantiated in human speech (cf. for example the connection made between /Stoq and jiioq in 22 B 48 and that between fw vow and ft&gt;roq in B 114), and so I suggest that he meant that men by themselves could see the Logos there as well as in the facts of experience. If this is so, then it is likely that he used tireuii&gt; Kal epyuw as a polar expression for "the whole of human experience," as Reinhardt and others have thought.51 The verb Snjyev/xai has received little attention on the part of interpreters, even though there has been a lot of discussion as to whether Heraclitus' book was a collection of aphorisms or a continuous exposition.52 I agree with Walzer (p. 42, note 7) that dtijyel&lt;r6at indicates, not a collection of aphorisms but rather a descriptive writing, i.e. a treatise. The first fragment of Heraclitus supports such an interpretation and so do, among others, 22 B 114, 30, etc. It is 48 Cf. note 41 supra. 49 Cf.

But even if some of Heraclitus' utterances were aphorisms, it is unlikely that the whole book was merely a collection of such utterances. It is noteworthy that oko'mp iyoo Kara (frvoiv biaiptfjiv tKaoTov kcu 4&gt;pafav OKwq Ixei must refer to the whole or to most of Heraclitus' treatise and not merely to its first part. The two participial phrases, (duiyevfiai) Kara &lt;j&gt;vcriv diaiptuv eKaarov Kal 4&gt;pafav oKcoq e'xti, have given rise to several different interpreta tions. First of all one must decide what is here meant by diatptlv. Marcovich takes it in the literal meaning "to divide," in the sense of "taking apart." As examples he gives the bow in 22 B 51 (it consists of two arms and of the unifying string) and the analysis of a word, as in 22 B 48 ("the name and the function are the two constituent parts of every given thing").53 However, even apart from the fact that his interpretation of B 51 is questionable and that the implication he sees in B 48 is too far-reaching,54 it is doubtful, in the light of our evidence, that Heraclitus devoted the essential part of his treatise to the type of analysis Marcovich describes.55 But I think Marcovich is right in his attempt to relate the two participial phrases to the rest of Heraclitus' statements. However, if we are to take diaipeiv eKaarov in the sense "to divide each thing," I believe that Heraclitus was thinking of his predecessors' procedure of dividing their main "ma terial substances"56 into contraries. Thus, for example, Anaximenes asserted (using the mechanism of condensation and rarefaction) that all was air and then proceeded to divide this body into contraries: hot and cold, humid and dry, etc.57 It is this procedure on the part of his predecessors that Parmenides illustrates when he describes the opinions of mortals.58 If this is what Heraclitus meant by Siaipeiv tKotoTov, then we must think of his doctrine of identity-in-difference, of the unity of contraries, etc., which presupposes not only some sort of classification of things into contraries but also contrariety in the 53 Marcovich1, p. 10 = Marcovich2, pp. 10-11. 54 Even in B 48 itself I cannot see that Heraclitus implies that the name and the function of the bow are its two constituent parts. 55 Heraclitus seems to place more emphasis on the bringing of things together rather than on "taking them apart." The unity of things, i.e. of contraries, seems to be what he claims as his most original contribution. Cf. 22 b 2, 10, 30, 41, 51, 54, 57, etc. 56 By this expression I mean to refer simply to the most widely distributed bodies in the universe mentioned by the Presocratics, e.g. water, fire, etc. 57 Cf. Anaximenes 13 A 1, A 4, A 5, A 7, B 1, B 2, etc. 58 Cf. Parmenides 28 B 8, 55-59 with L.

This procedure could be illustrated by fragments such as B 12 irorafioiaiv rolaw avroiaiv tufiaxvovoiv trepa Kal trepa vbara tirippti, B 36 \//vxfi&lt;JLv Oavaroq vbcop yev'eodaL, vban be davaroq yr\v yevtadai, B 48 tu&gt; to^u ovo/xa ffioq, epyov be davaroq, B 61 daXacaa vbup Kadap&amp;TaTov Kal pLapoirarov, LxSvai pev iroTipov Kal &lt;tojtt)plov, avdpuiroic, be airoTov Kal oX'edpiov, etc. However, it is also possible that we must take biaiptiv here in the more general sense "to distinguish," as Kirk59 among others does, for Heraclitus may have meant merely to say that each thing60 is described by him Kara cpvoLv. But I cannot agree with Kirk that biaipeuv here is (merely) the process of analysis that leads up to a judgment. It seems to be rather the process by which a thing is described and thereby is differentiated from anything else, though of course in Heraclitus that very differentiation will show it to be related to everything else. As for Kara 4&gt;v&lt;nv, I should prefer to take it not as "according to each thing's origin," nor as "according to each thing's nature," nor as "according to each thing's real constitution," but in its true adverbial meaning "properly," "as it ought to be (sc. described)."61 One objection common to the rejected interpretations is that at this stage in his book it is not likely that Heraclitus would have written Kara (frvaiv biaipeaiv if he had meant to ascribe to &lt;f&gt;v(TL&lt;; a technical meaning. I agree with Verdenius and Kirk62 that oKuq e\(i is not a different process from Kara (frvoiv biaip'euv, but that the two are related. Heraclitus proposes to describe each thing correctly and so to be able to state how it is. In the third and final part of the fragment, Heraclitus proceeds to describe the kind of life the rest of men (row; be aWovc, avdpuirovi^ lead because of their ignorance of the Logos, in strong contrast with Heraclitus' own condition (f'^cb birjyevixai kt\.). Kirk and Marcovich, among others, take the final part of the fragment to mean that the rest of men fail to understand what they do once they are awake (taking tytpdtvTtq as an ingressive aorist participle), just as they forget what they do when they are asleep: "But the rest of men fail to notice what they do after they wake up just as they forget what they do when asleep" (Kirk's translation). Before discussing this interpre tation it may be well to indicate a point of agreement: -kolovoiv, which must also be supplied with the second clause, should not be interpreted too literally, itoiuv here refers not only to what men actually do but 50 Kirk, pp. 33 and 41-42. 1,0 In any interpretation of the words in question &amp;aarov is a rhetorical exaggeration. 61 Cf. J. W. Beardslee, Jr., The Use of cfivau in Fifth-Century Greek Literature (diss., Chicago 1918), p. 47. 1,2 Verdenius, op. cit. (note 5 supra), p. 273; Kirk, pp. 42-43.</page><page sequence="13">Leonardo Taran 13 also to their mental and emotional life. Moreover, the second clause refers to our dreams when we are asleep; it certainly does not refer primarily to the motions or gesticulations we may perform while we are asleep.63 The difficulties of the interpretation they have adopted have not escaped Kirk and Marcovich themselves, and are indeed formidable. If we take t-mXavdavovrai to mean "they forget," then Heraclitus would be saying that men once they are awake fail to recognize, to see the ever-present truth just as they, on waking, forget what they did in sleep, that is, they forget their dreams. However, in the first place, it is not the case that men always forget their dreams; quite frequently they do not forget them. And so we would have a first important inconcinnity. Heraclitus would be comparing the perpetual failure of ignorant men to understand the truth with something that happens to men sometimes only. And there is evidence in Heraclitus himself that he did not think that we always forget our dreams.64 Secondly, and even more important, even if men did forget their dreams, it is hard to see the propriety of comparing men's customary failure to know the truth with the fact that once they are awake they forget their dreams. This difficulty should not be dismissed with Kirk's remark that "slight inconsistencies in complex images are not uncommon in the archaic style."65 The comparison would not be slightly inconsistent but rather a non sequitur. Marcovich for his part betrays the weakness of the interpretation to which he subscribes when he states that "the sentence would be complete in itself even without tvLXavdavovTCU, (which cannot mean the same as XavOavei): possibly Heraclitus added this word for the sake of balance or of the word-play."66 For we would have to suppose that for the sake of balance or of word-play Heraclitus added a word, iinXavdavovTOLi, and ruined the whole point of the comparison, as without it the statement would yield a good sense: "But it escapes the rest of men what they do once they are awake, just as it escapes them what they do while they are asleep." I agree with Marcovich that iiriXavdavovTai does not mean the same as the preceding XavOavei, but to decide what Heraclitus had in mind it is necessary to see first what he meant by the comparison in general. One must note two points. First, that to the man who knows the Logos, specifically Heraclitus himself (eyco), the nescience of the rest 63 Contrast West, op. cit. (note 10 supra), p. 116, who thinks that the reference is to bodily movements which men make while asleep. 64 Cf. 22 B 21 with B 26; B 75; B 89. 65 Kirk, p. 44. 66 Marcovich1, p. 10 = Marcovich2, p. 11.</page><page sequence="14">14 Illinois Classical Studies, XI of humanity in wakefulness is strongly contrasted. Secondly, Heraclitus must have meant to compare men's failure to apprehend the Logos when they are awake with what happens to them when they are asleep and dreaming. In other words, he is comparing two states, and we must keep in mind that to sleep and dream is for Heraclitus, as Kirk himself says, "a real if diminished form of activity."67 Now tiriXavdavofiai. literally means "to let something which one previously knew escape one's notice";68 here, used of what happens to men while they are dreaming, it must refer to this: the successive images we see in our dreams escape our notice in such a way that we do not understand — because we are not conscious of—the nature of what we do in our sleep. This is in fact the way in which some interpreters have understood iiviXoLvOavovTai in this fragment.69 To Kirk's and Marcovich's objection that there is no parallel to such a meaning, one must answer that it is the context that is crucial for deciding what a word means. Moreover, the middle t-KiXavdavo^ai or eVtX^o^at frequently bears the meaning "to forget" in the sense of "not being conscious of." Thus, for example, when at the beginning of Plato's Apology (17 A 2-3) Socrates says eyu&gt; 8' ovv /cat avToq U7r' avrchv oX'iyov efiavTov tirtXaOofiriv, he surely means to say that the effect of his accusers' speeches was such that he almost "forgot himself" in the sense of "not being conscious of who he really was." If this interpre tation is right, then the comparison makes sense: "(in contrast to Heraclitus who knows the Logos) it escapes the rest of men what they do once they are awake, just as when they are asleep they are unconscious of (i.e. do not understand) what they do." Heraclitus does not mean to say that the rest of men when awake have no knowledge at all of what they do but only that the true significance of it escapes them. For example, they see day and they see night, but they do not understand that night and day are a single thing (cf. 22 B 57). The interpretation of the final comparison given here makes better sense of eyep8evreq as an ingressive aorist than that of Kirk and Marcovich does. In their interpretation the comparison would be between two things that happen when men are awake: they fail to understand the Logos just as they forget their dreams. In my interpretation, men, once they are awake, fail to understand the Logos just as when they were asleep they did not understand their 67 Kirk, p. 44. 68 Kirk, p. 44. 69 Cf. e.g. Gigon, p. 6; Kranz FVS6 I, p. 150; Walzer, p. 41; H. Frankel, American Journal of Philology 59 (1938), 318 with n. 18.</page><page sequence="15">Leonardo Taran 15 dreams. The implication is that the waking life of the ignorant majority has a dreamlike quality. This fragment, then, implies the geometrical proportion-pattern "the man who knows the Logos is to men awake who fail to understand it as the latter are to those who are asleep and dreaming."70 The pattern A:B::B:C was used by Heraclitus in other connections also,71 and the specific one implied in the first fragment is also to be reconstructed with good probability from other texts.72 This is not the place to discuss the meaning of Logos in Heraclitus, since several other fragments would have to be taken into account. Nevertheless, something can be gathered even from this fragment itself, and belongs to the present discussion because it affects the interpretation of our text. The main point is that the Logos cannot be simply Heraclitus' discourse,73 nor can it even refer principally to it.74 For it is clearly implied here that men could have known the Logos even before they heard it from Heraclitus.75 All things happen according to the Logos, yet men are like the inexperienced even when they experience such words and deeds as Heraclitus describes; it follows that the Logos is always there but men fail to understand it because they fail to see the connection that exists between all the facts with which they are acquainted. In short, the Logos must be a formula or pattern in accordance with which all things happen in the universe. The discourse of Heraclitus expounds and explains this Logos, but the Logos' existence is independent of it. The discourse of Heraclitus "is" the Logos only in the sense that it describes the formula according to which all things happen in the universe; but the two are not identical, and they are clearly differentiated in frag.
