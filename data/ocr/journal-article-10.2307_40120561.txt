<plain_text><page sequence="1">^ J. M. G. Le Clezio. La fievre. Paris. Galli- mard. 1965. 231 pages. 11.70 F. The second book by a young novelist who happens to have been praised almost extrav- agantly for the surprising success of his first one is traditionally awaited by critics with ferocious suspicion. But they had to concede that Le Clezio, with this remarkable collection of short stories, confirmed the testimonies of esteem which had welcomed Le proces-verbal in 1964. He has an original style, precise, clear- cut, concrete, with far fewer obtrusive man- nerisms than Hemingway or Robbe-Grillet. As in his novel, which had tended to be repeti- tious and monotonous and palled on the reader in the final chapters, he practices a sort of literary collage, inserting newspaper clippings, publicity slogans, signs read on store windows, into his narrative. He is a master of cool, swift description of a world from which the char- acters feel alienated. But he is no realist. Unlike the "new," and already dismally "passe," novel of the last few years, he does not banish character or a con- tinuous and cumulative story, and he is not afraid of anthropomorphism or, very plainly, of showing sympathy and tenderness. He delves into the dim beginnings of our sensa- tions, even into our tropisms, more searchingly than some of his elders who seemed too con- cerned with demonstrating theoretical views when they attempted to out-Proust Proust. Most of the nine stories of this book reveal the author's finest gift: an acute awareness of the suffering body. A man is seized by a sudden and hallucinating fit of fever. Another one, Beaumont, discovers pain when maddened by an excruciating toothache. Paoli, in "L'homme qui marche," abandoned by his wife, walks on and on along drab streets to numb his sorrow. Most of Le Clezio's characters walk mechani- cally, endlessly, as if to empty their bodies of all consciousness and lose themselves into ob- jects. One is reminded of Sartre's Roquentin. But those walkers in pain do not philosophize. "Le monde est vivant" is the most poetical of those stories and the only one unafflicted with physical pain. The most pitiful is probably "Martin": a twelve year old boy, with a ridicu- lously huge head, hydrocephalic and extra- ordinarily precocious, lecturing already on Descartes, Ruysbroek, and comparative reli- gion, is tormented by other children who force</page><page sequence="2">FRENCH: FICTION 171 him to crawl on the sand and to dig for his glasses, which they have cruelly taken away from his nearsighted eyes. Again the physical moves of the learned boy having to grope his way awkwardly like an animal with a mon- strous head are graphically analyzed. The words "anguish" and "sorrow" are never written and do not have to be. The rendering of the anguish of suffering has seldom been more masterly. Henri Peyre Yale University</page></plain_text>
