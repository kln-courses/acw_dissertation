<plain_text><page sequence="1">Barbara Frischmuth. Amy oder die Metamorphose. Salz- burg. Residenz. 1978. 296 pages. Frischmuth's latest novel, the sequel to Die Mystifi^a- tionen der Sophie Silber ( 1976; see WLT 51:2, p. 269), depicts Amaryllis Sternwieser's reincarnation as Amy Stern, a young student working as a waitress in Vienna, and her gradual evolution into an artist. At the end of the first novel, human abuse of the environment had caused a crisis in the spiritual world: either the spirits could re- treat into their respective elements and rebel against hu- manity, or they could retain an anthropomorphic form and enlighten individual human beings through a discreet use of their supernatural powers. Amaryllis Stern wieser, the fairy of memory, sleep and death, proposes a third, more radically Utopian plan: i.e., to become mortal themselves and, in the guise of women and children, to effect changes in the existing power structures. Although most of the spirits choose the second possi- bility and appear in Vienna as different but recognizable characters, Amaryllis Sternwieser undergoes the trans- formation to mortality. As she awakens from her meta- morphosis, she is a tabula rasa: she has lost all conscious- ness of her previous incarnation and does not yet possess the memory of Amy Stern. She must therefore experience yet a second transformation in order to discover who she is, what her own specific role as a woman is, what goals she has, and what problems she has to face. Amy Stern's second metamorphosis is facilitated by her encounters with self-reliant women from all social classes, a lover and paternal emissaries from the spiritual world. Through these experiences she regains the memories of her mortal past, intimates a vague connection to the spiritual world and determines her present identity in its relationship to a sense of future mission. She eventually decides to aban- don her medical studies in favor of a career as an author, to reject offers of patronage and retain her job as a waitress, and to accept society's challenge to succeed both as a single mother and as a serious writer. Similarly, her didactic epic, "Literature of the Dolphins," does not conform to the standards of popular taste but nevertheless has pretensions of mediating widespread social changes by providing hu- man beings with more intelligent models for social inter- course. Finally, despite her fairy heritage and despite the some- what fantastic opportunities that her spiritual mentors create for her, Amy Stern's experiences, problems and de- cisions resemble those of many women in contemporary West European society. On this more realistic level they can therefore be regarded as potential feminist alternatives to women's traditional role within society. Whether Amy Stern will succeed in her emancipated and emancipatory endeavors or whether the existing relationships of power can be changed through feminist art remain open ques- tions at the end of the novel. Perhaps Barbara Frischmuth could be persuaded to suggest some tentative answers to them by continuing the story of Amy in her next novel. Susan L.
