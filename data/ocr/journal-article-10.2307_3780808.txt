The book of essays under review is the companion volume to the exhibition De wereld binnen handbereik, which was held at the Amsterdam Historical Museum from 26 June to i I Octo- ber i992. An extensive catalogue, in which every object was il- lustrated and described, was also made available to visitors.' The Amsterdam show overlapped in time with a similar one, called The age ofthe marvelous, originally held at the Hood Mu- seum of Dartmouth College, to which a book of essays has also been devoted. Both exhibits followed by only a few years the symposium volume The origins of museums, and Schnapper's Le lion.2 Cabinets of curiosities and Wunderkammern have clearly drawn the attention of historians of art and of early modern culture in recent years. The four books that I have just referred to differ in their con- ceptual scope. The age of the marvelous ranges most broadly and provides the most comprehensive intellectual background. The editors of the accompanying book of essays view the cabinet of curiosities as only one of several manifestations of the seven- teenth century's fascination with things that "had the capacity to excite the particular responses of wonder, surprise, astonish- ment or admiration."3 Beyond the range of the Amsterdam ex- hibition, it discusses documents and objects related to artificial monsters and machines in spectacles, pageants and gardens, miraculous religious events, and trompe 1'oeil painting. The es- says byJoy Kenseth andJames V. Mirollo set the material exhib- ited in the context of contemporary poetry and philosophy. It also includes an essay on cartography by James Welu (who has written extensively on maps in Dutch art), which would have been a very suitable topic for the more narrowly conceived We- reld binnen handbereik. As it is, maps and globes are barely touched on in the Dutch volume (in essays by Roelof van Gel- I Exhib. cat.

The Amsterdam exhibitors deliberately focused on Dutch collectors and collections of natural and artificial objects in the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. The companion volume contains essays on travel to exotic places and the im- portation of rare objects (L. Noordegraaf and T. Wijsenbeek- Olthuis), on the way collections were arranged and fitted into Dutch interiors (W. Fock), on the Schatzkammern of Dutch humanists (C. L. Heesakkers), on the collection of shells (H. E. Coomans), on Dutch collectors and their collections (two essays by J. van der Veen), on representations of foreign peoples and the mentality of collectors (J. van der Waals), on books and cat- alogues describing contemporary collections (J. van der Waals), on the relation between cabinets of curiosities and the develop- ment of science (K. van Berkel), on the impact of the French "beau ideal" on Dutch art collections (H. T. van Veen), and on the visits and the comments made by foreigners on Dutch cabinets (R. van Gelder). The introductory essay on Dutch collections of art and rari- ties, 1 585 - 1735, by Roelof van Gelder, one of the editors of the volume, makes clear that these collections, in contrast to the situation that prevailed in the rest of Europe, belonged to burghers and regents rather than to kings, nobles and prelates. The absence of princely collections, as van Gelder points out, is an important reason why almost all Dutch cabinets eventually left the country: they were sold at auction after their owners died or resolved to turn them into cash, and many were bought by foreign princes. Among these noble buyers may be cited the English Prince of Wales, the King of Denmark, the Elector Pa- latine, and Tsar Peter the Great. A significant number of the ethnographic artificialia in the Amsterdam show, borrowed from the Copenhagen Etnografisk Samlung, had originally come from the famed cabinet of Bernardus Paludanus (1550- I 633) in Enkhuizen, which was sold by his heirs in i 65I to Fre- derick iII von Schleswig-Holstein (later King of Denmark). The decision to limit the exhibition and the companion vol- ume of essays to the collections of burghers and regents had the effect of ruling out the collecting activities ofJohan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen, to whose Brazilian explorations an exhibit had already been devoted at the Mauritshuis in 1979/i980 (Zo wijd de wereld strekt). This, in my view, was a mistake, if not for the exhibition itself, at least for the companion volume. A book that is going to be the chief source for the scientific study of exotica in seventeenth and early eighteenth-century Netherlands can- not omit some discussion of the works of Frans Post (who is only mentioned once in the book under review, in connection with a Haarlem collection) and Albert Eckhout (who is not mentioned at all). The minimal space devoted to Dirck Valkenburg (i675- I 727) is not adequate compensation for the absence of Post and Eckhout. To this may be retorted that Valkenburg fitted into the exhibition because, unlike his older colleagues, he carried out contracts for the burgher-collector Jonas Witsen. But this only shows that consistency of purpose may sometimes get in the way of the goal of achieving a deeper understanding of a subject.4 These reservations aside on the scope of the project, I admir- ed the exhibition (or at least the catalogue, since I did not have a chance to see the show itself) and found much material of inter- est and lasting value in the essays. It should be read by any one wishing to know something about the collection of naturalia and artificialia and the mentalities of the Dutch curieux who assembled them. It makes a significant contribution to the stu- dy of seventeenth and early eighteenth-century mentalities, and especially of contemporary attitudes toward science. The material on art collections, which I discuss in the latter part of this review, also contains valuable things but is less original and more open to debate. Some of the essays give evidence of the tension between the encyclopedic motive for collecting-properly speaking, bring- ing the world within a hand's reach of the exhibition's title- and the interest in the rare and the unusual. Francis Bacon at the close of the sixteenth century referred to cabinets that con- tained "whatsoever singularity, chance and the shuffle of things has produced. "5 To put together a cabinet of curiosities worthy of its name, it was not enough to fill it with insects found in the woods next door or with shells lying in the Haarlem dunes. A 4 The exhibition catalogue was less consistent in this respect than the volume of essays. It included a Brazilian landscape by Frans Post, which was probably painted when the artist was carrying out commis- sions for Johan Maurits van Nassau-Siegen, and makes frequent men- tion of Albert Eckhout, some of whose paintings show ethnographic artifacts that belonged to private collectors (cat. no. 32, for example).

(note 3). 6 Unicorns were supposed to be horse-like creatures with a single horn on their forehead; the horns of unicorns that actually entered collec- tions were narwhal bones. Rhinoceros horns, then and still nowadays in certain parts of Asia, were held to have strong aphrodisiac proper- ties. Remoras are fish with a dorsal fin that can attach itself to the hull of a ship; it was believed that they could stop it in its course. The bezoar stone, which is produced in the stomachs of certain ruminants, was sought after as an aid to painless childbirth. The ammonite is a creta- ceous fossil which early naturalists thought was a leftover from the bib- lical deluge (some people believed that fossils were sports of nature which were not of organic origin at all).The gray amber secreted by certain types of whale was thought to have medicinal properties. Col- lectors in the first half of the seventeenth century believed that birds of paradise had no feet (most specimens arrived in Europe without feet because traders, perhaps to show off their plumage to better advan- tage, had cut them off). Schnapper, op. cit. (note 2), p. 8i, tells a reveal- ing anecdote about a French collector who received a specimen that did have feet. He lopped them off, "de crainte qu'on ne dise que ce n'est pas un veritable."</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS I0I distinguished Theatrum Mundi had to be as comprehensive as possible, not about the universe as a whole but about its singu- larities: it should if possible contain at least one specimen of the unicorn, the rhinoceros horn, the remora, the bezoar stone, the ammonite, the bird of paradise, a piece or two of gray amber, as well as specimens of the other wonders of the world.6 The world of the seventeenth century, as Schnapper felici- tously put it, was "incompletement desenchante"7-it had not yet been purged of its magic. But as time passed, the ob- jects of collections gradually lost some of their magic, as they became more common, and hence cheaper, in part because travel to far-off regions had become more frequent. First, if these objects existed at all-it had become obvious to many curieux that unicorns were not be found on earth and that the horns of these mythic beasts were merely narwhal bones-they did not have the properties they were alleged to have. Remoras did not stop ships. Bezoar stones did not facilitate childbirth. Birds of paradise had feet. Secondly, a sea-change took place in the intellectual climate in the second half of the seventeenth century which brought about a depreciation of collectible won- ders. Renei Descartes in his Recherche de la ve'riti par la lumiere naturelle, written no later than i641, assailed "unfettered curiosity." Science, he suggested, must rest on the study of "common things that every one has heard of" and not on "sin- gularities" and "things that are strange in nature."8 La Bruyere in i69i published his influential essay ridiculing the amateurs of curiosities. Boileau, the great protagonist of classical taste in art and poetry, inveighed against these and similar excesses. Religious thought in France, especially in the circles close to Port-Royal, was shorn of its more extreme superstitions. Some of these rationalist ideas no doubt made their way to the Neth- erlands or developed there independently. The dogmatism and stridency of Dutch Protestantism, so conspicuous in the first quarter of the seventeenth century, gradually subsided. Men of science such as Jan Swammerdam, Frederick Ruysch, and Anthony van Leeuwenhoek were able to develop their em- pirical interests, less encumbered than their predecessors had been by religious prejudice. By the end of the century, the Cal- vinist opinions of Nicolas Witsen, a major collector of naturalia and ethnographic artiqicialia, appear quaint and old-fashioned, at least by wider European standards. Witsen, who was stren- uously anti-Catholic-van der Waals calls him an "echte pa- penvreter" (a veritable devourer of Papists)-was viscerally upset by the sight of Buddhist statues from Ceylon, which he called "images of the devil," worse even than Catholic idols.9 Compare this with the objective, dispassionate attitude toward Japanese religion of Engelbrecht Kaempfer, who was io years younger than Witsen: "The Japanese profess a great respect and veneration for their gods, and worship them in various ways, and I think I may affirm that in practice of virtue, in pu- rity of life, and outward devotion, they far outdo the Christians: careful for the salvation of their souls, scrupulous to excess in the expiation of their sins, and extremely desirous of future happiness."'" The Amsterdam exhibit was initially conceived by Jaap van der Veen, an art historian. He was joined in the editorial com- mittee by Roelof van Gelder, a historian tout court, who has contributed many articles on cultural and art historical sub- jects to the NRC Handelsbiad, and by Jan van der Waals, who is also an art historian. Given this intellectual sponsorship, I would have expected De wereld binnen handbereik to have devoted more space to the art-historical significance of the ex- hibition. The essays by Jaap van der Veen and Hendrick van Veen contain many germane comments on art collections. But the other art-historical aspects of collections, particularly of exotica, are barely touched upon. These include the decorative schemes on the basis of which exotic objects were displayed in cabinets of the period, the incorporation of naturalia and arti- ficialia in paintings and other "high art," and the way artists represented such objects when they made prints or paintings after them. On decorative schemes, one might have wished to learn more about the arrangements of shells, insects, and butterflies in col- lections that survived or in contemporary images. The highly symmetric and curvilinear patterns in the arrangement of shells remind one of the decorative flourishes in late seven- teenth-century French books. The striking anthropomorphic clock face of circa I700 (illustrated in color on p. I93 in the volume of essays), made up of shells, coral, and mother- of-pearl, bears some similarity to Oceanic artefacts (as well per- haps as to Arcimboldo's conceits). On the incorporation of exotica into high art, some of the authors do refer to shells (naturalia) and porcelain cups and bowls (artificialia) shown in still lifes. But, for the most part, they neglect ethnographic objects in portraits and history paintings, which may even be more revealing. According to Ezzio Bassani and Malcom McLeod," St Paul's sword in the picture by Rembrandt in Nuremberg, dated i630, was a pro- duct of the Akan culture in Africa. A similar sword appears in one of Albert Eckhout's paintings, together with a basket of the 7 Schnapper, op. cit. (note 2), p. 309. 8 Cited in K.

I have not been able to verify these assertions, but, since both sword and basket, or objects very similar to them, were illustrated in the catalogue of the Ole Worm collection (I 655), a souvenir of their appearance might have been includ- ed in the exhibit or illustrated in one of the essays. If Bassani and McLeod are correct, one can only wonder how Rembrandt had latched on to the Akan sword when he was still living in Leiden. The way artists represent the esoteric objects that they copy is also a subject worthy of study. Van der Waals tells us (p. 155) that when the devout and prudish Nicolas Witsen wished to have an Indian yogi copied after an existing drawing, he order- ed the artist to cover his nakedness. The biography of Engel- brecht Kaempfer in the catalogue of the Amsterdam ex- hibition observes that the prints after the original drawings were altered in the first edition of the book, which was publish- ed in England; these changes were made to conform to Europe- an conventions, especially in the way Asiatic clothing was depicted. H.E. Coomans, who is an expert on shells, points out that Rembrandt's only etching of a shell (conus marmoreus) is wound the wrong way,'2 presumably because Rembrandt drew it as it was in reality, and the etching reproduced it in mirror image. Would he have made this mistake if the etching had been commissioned by a knowledgeable collector? We learn from another source that Rembrandt and Willem Schellinks both copied the same Mughal painting of an emperor in apo- theosis. The copies are preserved and so is the original (in the Bodleian Library).'3 If all three objects had been exhibited, or at least illustrated, the conscious and unconscious omissions and distortions that almost invariably affect free copies, partic- ularly of rare and exotic originals, would have been revealed in an instructive way.'4 I turn now to the essays by Jaap van der Veen and H. van Veen on collections of art. I have reservations about the first, although I agree with many of the points it makes; as to the second. I think that a quantitative aDproach can help both to firm up and to refine its conclusions. Van der Veen explains in his first essay that the concept of a "collection" that he will adopt excludes "wall decoration" as well as family portraits. (p. i20). He informs his readers that he will follow Roelof van Gelder's definition of a "collector" (p. 2i): "An individual will be considered a collector who des- ignates himself as such or is designated by some one else as such or whenever a catalogue, an advertisement for an auction, a testament, a letter or some other source makes it appear that he was a collector. A probate inventory can also supply an affirmative answer wherever such an inventory contains a sizable number ("omvangrijke hoeveelheid") of rarities." This definition may be suitable to identify collectors of naturalia, rare coins and medals, and ethnographic material who corres- ponded with each other, compiled catalogues of the objects they owned, or had a notice printed of the things they or their heirs wished to sell at auction. But it will not serve to segregate the "true collections" of works of art from those that were as- sembled to decorate and adorn burghers' homes. Seventeenth- century collectors of paintings were very rarely identified as such in notarial documents, letters, or laudatory poems, at least in documents that have been preserved. Furthermore, how large is the "sizable number" required for an ensemble of paintings listed in an inventory to qualify as a "collection"? As van der Veen acknowledges, seventeenth-century collections were almost never set apart in a special room reserved for their display. Highly valued works of art turned up in cellars, back rooms, and kitchens as well as in the front hall, the inner hearth, and, at least in later years, the dining room. It is futile, in my judgment, to try and separate those that hung on the walls and were "merely decoration" from those that were prized objects of collecting. Family portraits could be routine and virtually anonymous in their execution; but if they were painted by Rembrandt, Bartholomeus van der Helst, or Govert Flinck they were transmuted into high art.

Skelton, "Indian art and artefacts in early European collecting," in Imsey and MacGregor, op. cit. (note 2), p. 279. 14 The catalogue of Peter the Great's Kunstkammer offers two reveal- ing examples of the misinterpretation of exotic objects. A Greco-Bac- trian cup was mistaken for an item of headgear, and a plaque depicting the Bactrian goddess Khavaninda was said to be "the figure of an angel holding a heart in the right hand;" see 0. Nerov, "'His Majesty's cabi- net' and Peter I's Kunstkammer," in Imsey and MacGregor, op. cit. (note 2), p. 6o. These are of course written descriptions, but artists' representations must also occasionally have been subject to such er- rors. In P. Lunsingh Scheurleer's article, "De moghul-miniaturen van Rembrandt," in H. van Muyzenberg and T. de Bruijn (eds.), Waarom Sanskrit? Honderdvyfentwintig jaar Sanskrit in Nederland, Leiden i99i, a miniature from a Mughal atelier, dated i654-56, and its copy by Rembrandt, drawn only a few years later, are illustrated side by side (pp. ioo-oi). It clearly appears that Rembrandt has eliminated the er- rors in perspective in the original (particularly in the dishes lying on the ground). He has done away with the flowers in the foreground, and he has altered the shape of the hat worn by one of the seated literati in a way that makes it seem more like the headgear worn by some Amsterdam Jews of the type that he had portrayed in other drawings. I am grateful to Professor Egbert Haverkamp-Begemann for drawing my attention to Lunsingh Scheurleer's article. I5 Of the go collectors in Jaap van der Veen's appendix, 67 owned na- turalia. His definition of artificialia is so wide - it includes porcelain, which was present in most of the better-off households by the end of the seventeenth century - that I did not find it very helpful. Among the few collectors in van der Veen's sample who possessed neither naturalia nor artificialia (other than paintings, drawings and prints), none were prominent art collectors. They seem to have been chosen because they were the relatives of great collectors of naturalia, such as the various members of the Witsen family.</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 103 contained a great deal of naturalia, of artificialia or both, van der Veen has made the task easier for himself.'5 It would have been more difficult to put together a sample of go genuine col- lectors of art without making arbitrary decisions about the number or the quality of the objects they possessed. An alternative to Roelof van Gelder's definition, insofar as works of art are concerned, would be to designate as a collec- tion any ensemble of paintings, drawings and prints listed in a probate inventory that had been appraised by members of the city's Guild of St. Luke. When teams of two or three of these experts, who usually numbered among them at least one art dealer, appraised a collection, their attributions were likely to be correct and the prices they set for the objects fairly faithful approximations to their market value.'6 Out of a sample of 32I Amsterdam inventories containing at least one attributed painting that I have assembled, dated between i6oo and i679, 32 were appraised by one or more painters or art dealers.'7 On average the number of attributed pictures these inventories contained was twice as large as average (17.6 versus 8.9). This definition, while it would be useful as a starting point, would still rule out numerous inventories containing some of the most important collections recorded in Amsterdam, including those of Anthony Gaillard (I55 attributions) and Herman Becker (I38 attributions). We are indebted to Jaap van der Veen for the careful and time-absorbing research he has done on the religious, profes- sional and educational background of the go collectors in his sample. It is of some interest to learn that i6 of them had stud- ied at a university, I2 belonged to the regent class, 8 occupied municipal functions, 24 were successful merchants and so forth.'8 When we learn that I3 of them were doctors, apothe- caries, or surgeons or dealt in drugs, we should keep in mind that the sample is heavily biased toward collectors of natura- lia, many of whom began to acquire bezoar stones, unicorns, and dried plant specimens as part of their trade or profession. My only serious reservation to van der Veen's statistical analy- sis concerns his conclusion that "the religious aspect seems not to have played a prominent role in collecting" (p. 249). This, he argues, follows from the diversity of religious beliefs of the col- lectors in the sample. If there were i I Mennonites among them, the reason lies in the fact that "in the middle of the seventeenth century the cloth industry was flourishing and many cloth mer- chants happened to be Mennonites." A closer look at the bio- graphical data in van der Veen's appendix suggests he did not do full justice to his material. Out of go collectors in his sample, he was able to ascertain the religion of 79 individuals.'9 Of these only four (5%) were Roman Catholic (two collectors of natura- laa, one of artificialia, and one chiefly of paintings). This is of course a much smaller proportion of the Amsterdam popula- tion than Catholics represented in the seventeenth century (somewhere between 20 and 30 percent).20 Of the 63 collectors of naturalia whose religion is known or suspected, 45 were Re- formed (i.e. belonged to the dominant Calvinist sect, including Remonstrants), 6 were Lutheran, 9 were Mennonites, and one (Maria Sybilla Merian) was a Labadist. As we have just seen, only two were Roman Catholic. Antoine Schnapper had al- ready observed that many pharmacists and physicians who owned cabinets of naturalia in France were Protestants: "Scientific curiosity was more widespread among Protestants who were freer from [the restraints of] religious tradition." If we now focus on the overall Protestant group, the propor- tion of Mennonites in van der Veen's sample does seem extra- ordinarily high. I would be tempted to attribute it to the mentality of members of the sect rather than to the epipheno- menon of their occupation. The same applies to the Lutherans whose numbers also appears higher than one would have expec- ted. Finally, I turn to Henk van Veen's essay on "Extraordinary collections, Italian art and classical sculpture in the Nether- lands." His main argument is that, in the second half of the seventeenth and in the first quarter of the eighteenth century, the French conception of the "beau ideal" gradually began to dominate Dutch taste in art, at least among the virtuosi and the other opinion leaders of the time. It was largely in pursuance of this ideal that wealthy and enlightened Dutch collectors bought Italian paintings and drawings. He recognizes, as does van der i6 Van der Veen sheds doubt on the connoisseurship of notaries and their clerks (p. I i9) but makes no mention of guild appraisers. With respect to notaries, my impression is that their degree of expertise var- ied widely. Lambert Lamberti in Amsterdam and Willem de Langue in Delft were among those notaries who had considerable expertise, but many of their colleagues probably did not. The female lay assessors ("taxeersters" in Amsterdam), even though some of them seem to have been barely literate, should have been able to recognize conspicuous signatures (which may explain why so many still lifes were attributed to the still life painter Elias Vonck, whose signature was so large it could be read from a distance). Both notaries and lay assessors proba- bly also received information about the authorship of the works of art they inventoried from the relatives of the deceased (in cases of invento- ries made after death) and, afortiori, from the bride and bridegroom to be (in cases of inventories of movable assets contributed by both parties to a marriage.) I7 Art dealers' inventories have been excluded from the sample. I8 Some of these collectors belonged to more than one category. i9 This includes individuals whose religious affiliation van der Veen was able to infer from documentary evidence but without certainty. Infra, I count among the affiliates of a religion those who converted to that religion (and exclude them from the religion out of which they converted). 20 It may be that the proportion of Catholics among well-off burghers possessing significant collections was smaller than in the population of the city as a whole. But it must still have been much higher than 5%. 2i Schnapper, op. cit.

Some collectors, like Mi- chiel Hinloopen, would have liked to buy Italian paintings but they could only afford prints (p. I14). He supports his claim about the Dutch elite's admiration for French classical ideals by citing the dedication of Jan de Bischop's Icones to Constan- tijn Huygens the Younger. This dedication is indeed full of praise for French art in general and for Nicolas Poussin in par- ticular. He also cites the writings ofJan Six and Franqois Fagel, who had a passion for Renaissance art, and the "art trips" to France of the young Huygens and of Philips de Flines. Final- ly, he suggests that the elite's patronage of classically oriented Northern artists such as Gerard de Lairesse and Adriaen van der Werff helped to diffuse, and reinforced, the French ideal. All this is basically correct in my view, but it may require some adjustment to bring it into clearer focus. The scarcity22 and the high prices23 of Italian and French paintings in the pe- riod i 6oo-I 7 I 5 can be documented on the basis of extant inven- tories. Nevertheless, it should be pointed out that a substantial number of Dutch (and Flemish) pictures were appraised at higher prices than they were. In the inventory of the art dealer Johannes de Renialme (i657), which was appraised by two painters, the prices of nine paintings by Dutch artists exceeded the Italian-French average (Porcellis, 250 and 300 guilders, Lievens, 300 and 350 guilders, Hercules Seghers, 300 guil- ders, Rembrandt, 350, 400, 6oo, and I,500 guilders). In the collection of Joseph Deutz (i686), i6 out of 47 paintings attri- buted to Dutch and Flemish masters exceeded the average of the prices of Italian pictures (i io guilders). These included the Seven works of charity by Michiel Sweerts (i,ioo guilders), a landscape by Paulus Potter (225 guilders), a hay wagon by (Philips) Wouwerman (I I5 guilders), and three landscapes by Karel Dujardin that were estimated between I25 and I 50 guil- ders. In the Peronneau collection, two paintings (a "Lazarus" by Marten Pepijn estimated at i8o guilders and a "Bacchana- lia" by Baburen, 150 guilders) exceeded the Italian-French average (125 guilders). In the sample of Amsterdam invento- ries available for 1700-15, there were very few Italian or French paintings. But it is noteworthy that the average price of the i9 pictures attributed to Rembrandt was I95 guilders, of the seven attributed to de Lairesse, 306 guilders, and of the five attributed to Gerard Dou, i82 guilders. These prices were fully comparable to those of top-drawer Italian paintings, at least of those that were bought by Dutch burghers and patri- cians.24 It would appear that Dutch collectors were willing to pay "Italian prices" for Dutch and Flemish pictures, some of which, like Rembrandt's, Porcellis's or Potter's, could hardly be said to conform to the French "beau ideal." But if we look more closely at the Italian pictures collected, it is not clear that they represented this ideal either. Were the paintings of Palma Giovane, Titian, Tintoretto and the Bassanos, whose prices normally exceeded 200 guilders, models of classical harmony, transparency and repose ? Another disturbing fact is that, with the exception of a few pictures attributed to Poussin25 and to Claude Lorrain, who both spent most of their life in Italy, (exclusive of art dealers' inventories), I only found io that contained Italian or French paintings. There were 2,670 attributed paintings other than designated copies in these inventories. Of these, i% were attributed to Italian (24 paintings) and two to French masters living in Italy (one each by Jacques Courtois and Claude Lorrain). The art dealer Johannes de Renialme, who sold high-priced paintings to an elite clien- tele, had 268 attributed paintings other than copies in his 1657 invento- ry; of these, 13 were given to Italian masters, two to French masters (Claude Lorrain and Valentin de Boulogne) and one to a Spanish paint- er living in Italy (Ribera). In the collection ofJoseph Deutz, cited in van Veen's essay, there were 63 attributed paintings, of which five by Italian artists. Of these latter, three were said to be by Italian painters but were not attributed by name (Gemeentearchief Amsterdam, PA 234, inv. nr. 309). The Peronneau collection, the inventory of which was dated I 692 (published by A. Bredius, Kunstler-Inventare, 8 vols., The Hague 1915-22, vol. 3, pp. 849-51) was probably unique in its concentration on Italian and French paintings (i9 Italian and io French originals, including Courtois, Nicolas and Gaspard Poussin, Vouet and Claude Lorrain). In a large sample of transcripts of Amsterdam inventories, dated between I700 and I7I5, contributed by the Amsterdam Munici- pal Archives to the Getty Provenance Index, there were i,09i attribut- ed paintings. Of this total only 29 originals were attributed to Italian and three to French painters (Nicolas and Gaspard Poussin, Frangois Perrier). 23 The average price of Italian paintings in de Renialme's stock was 230 guilders, of those in Deutz's collection, I IO guilders, of those in Peron- neau's collection 125 guilders, compared to 67 guilders for the Dutch paintings. The average price of attributed paintings (almost all of which were attributed to Dutch or Flemish masters) in a sample of Amster- dam inventories containing attributions was 47 guilders (sample of 275 paintings). 24 Very few, if any, Dutch collectors could afford the most expensive Italian paintings that were sold at auction in Amsterdam for resale to princely collectors abroad. Raphael's portrait of Baldassare Castig- lione, for instance, remained for a few years in Lucas van Uffelen's col- lection in Amsterdam. It was sold at auction after van Uffelen's death where it was bought for the unprecedented price of 3,500 guilders by the Portuguese merchant Alfonso Lopez, who later resold it to Maza- rin. For details on this sale and other information on Italian paintings that left the Netherlands, the article by Frits Lugt, "Italiaansche kunst- werken in Nederlandsche verzamelingen van vroeger tijden," Oud Hol- land 53 (1936), pp. 97-132, is still worth consulting. 25 In exhib. cat. Franse schilderkunst uit Nederlands bewit, i6oo-i8oo, Rotterdam (Boymans-van Beuningen Museum) 1992, there are some interesting data on French paintings, including important pictures by Nicolas Poussin, in the stock of the Rotterdam art dealer Jaques Meyers, which were listed in his catalogue of 17I4. These data supple- ment the material on Meyers in van der Veen's essay (p. I27). Accord- ing to him, the paintings in Meyers's stock were for the most part destined to be sold to foreign collectors. It is not clear whether Meyers was himself a collector.</page><page sequence="7">BOOK REVIEWS I05 French painting was very poorly represented in Dutch collec- tions. There were no works at all in any inventory that I could find by French classical painters of the likes of La Hyre, Le- sueur or Lebrun. Among the classically oriented Italian paint- ers, Domenichino, Albani, and Lodovico, Annibale and Augostino Carracci shone by their nearly total absence.26 One would surely have expected to find some of these French and Italian painters in Dutch collections if there had been an all- consuming fashion for classical models. It would appear, rath- er, that wealthy Dutch collectors who were able to pay very high prices for works of art were just as willing to buy Dutch or Flemish paintings by major masters. Only very few collec- tors, such as Peronneau (who had spent many years in Italy), actually seemed to prefer Italian to native artists. Buying Ital- ian or French art may have conferred prestige on the collector; but it is not evident that it brought more pleasure than acqui- ring Dutch paintings, whether they incorporated the "beau ideal" or not. The collections of middle-class Dutch citizens, at least prior to 1700, contained virtually no Italian or French pictures. Yet they too could have bought paintings by lesser Italian or French masters that cost no more than most Dutch painters.27 The fact that they did not do so suggests that the diffusion of French ideals was less wide and less deep than Henk van Veen's essay might lead us to infer. JOHN MICHAEL MONTIAS YALE UNIVERSITY NEW HAVEN 26 The only painting attributed to Lodovico, Annibale or Agostino Carracci that I have been able to locate in a seventeenth or early eight- eenth century inventory was recorded in i686 in the collection of the widow of the painter Nicolaes Rosendael; see Bredius, op. cit. (note 25), vol. 4, p. 1306. In the 1752 inventory of the painter Anthony de Waerdt, two paintings by "Carracci" were mentioned, but the low pri- ces of the Italian and French paintings in his collection (7 guilders for a Poussin!) throw doubt on these attributions. On the misattributions to Italian masters in Dutch seventeenth and eighteenth-century collec- tions; see Lugt, op. cit. (note 24), p. I IO. 27 De Renialme's stock included two paintings by (Francesco or Carlo) Carboni estimated at 6 and 48 guilders respectively, and one by Bresaldi at 36 guilders. A painting by the Bolognese artist Cantarini in the Noi- rot collection was estimated at 50 guilders. These were typical prices for less well- known Italian artists-and entirely within the range of mid- dle-rank Dutch painters.</page></plain_text>
