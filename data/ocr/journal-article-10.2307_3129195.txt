It was voted to accept the proposal of the National Board of Officers that Article III, Section I, of the Constitution of the American Philosophical Association be amended as follows: "To the first sentence of Section I add, 'and a secretary elected by the foregoing members for a three year term and eligible for re-election'. Strike out sentences four and five of this section." President Prall announced that an invitation had been received from the American Documentation Institute of Washington, D.C., to nominate a member from the American Philosophical Association to serve on the In- stitute. President Prall stated that action would be taken in this matter by the National Board of Officers. The invitation of the University of California for the 1938 meeting of the Division was accepted. Since the Pacific Coast Economics Association and the Pacific Sociological Society would also be meeting at the University of California at that time, it was suggested that one joint session be held at which papers from the three associations be presented. It was recom- mended that the Program Committee be asked to consider this suggestion. The Executive Committee presented an invitation from the University of Washington that the meeting of the Division be held at that institution in 1938 or I939. After discussion, in which it was pointed out that the long distance between Seattle and Los Angeles would make it difficult for members from the south to attend, it was recommended that some ex- pression of willingness to meet in the north in 1939 be incorporated in the minutes of this meeting. On recommendation of the Executive Committee, the following were elected to active membership in the Pacific Division: Dr. Harry Girvety, Professor Neal K. Klausner, Professor Cornelia G. LeBoutillier, Professor John R. Reid. Henry Lanz and Otis Lee were elected to the Executive Committee for a term of two years. The following officers were elected for 1938: President, R. T. Flewelling; Vice-President, W. R. Dennes; Secretary-Treasurer (for a term of three years), Paul Marhenke. A unanimous vote of thanks was extended to President Edmunds of Pomona College and to the members of the Association at Pomona and Scripps Colleges for their gracious hospitality.

It was voted that all be included in the minutes of the Division, and published in the annual Proceedings, and they are accordingly here included. With deep regret and sorrow we record the death of our colleague, Professor Walter G. Everett, on July 29 last in Berkeley, California. Pro- fessor Everett was born in Rowe, Massachusetts, August 2I, I860, and entered Brown University in the class of I885, with which he graduated. He obtained the Master's degree in I888, the Doctor's degree in 1895, and carried on graduate study for a year at the Universities of Berlin and Strassburg. He began his teaching at Brown in I894 as Instructor in Greek and Latin. His personal interest and particular study, however, had always been centered upon problems of philosophy. Because of this, and in accordance with President Benjamin Andrews' desire at that time to em- phasize the importance of philosophy and to expand the personnel of the department, Professor Everett was in I896 appointed Associate Professor of Philosophy. Later he was appointed Professor of Philosophy and Romeo Elton Professor of Natural Theology, and occupied this chair until his retirement in I93o. During the year I912-I3 he served as acting-president of Brown University. In 1935 Professor Everett was further honored by Brown when, at Commencement, the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred upon him. His retirement from regular teaching marked no cessation of intellectual activity; and for several years thereafter he visited, and delivered lectures at, numerous Colleges and Universities in all parts of the country. In 1931 he was signally honored by an invitation to deliver the annual Howison Lecture at the University of California. In 1921 Pro- fessor Everett was appointed by the American Philosophical Association a delegate to the Allied Congress of Philosophy in Paris; and in 1922 was elected President of the Association. His greatest philosophical reputation botb as teacher and writer was achieved in the field of Ethics. His chief work, the treatise entitled Moral Values, received the highest praise in this country and abroad both for its philosophical content and for the outstand- ing excellence of its literary form. It has been and still is widely used as a textbook in courses in Ethics, and a few years ago was translated into</page><page sequence="4">No. 2.] AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION 187 Japanese by one of Professor Everett's former students. Professor Everett was further honored in being selected a few years ago in a referendum by the American Philosophical Association as one of thirty-four American Philosophers to contribute one of the essays to the two volume collection entitled Contemporary American Philosophy. Professor Everett made deep and lasting impression on the many students to whom he lectured during his forty years at Brown, for he loved teaching and gave to it of his best; and his charming personality and unfailing courtesy quickly won their regard and affection. As a friend, to colleagues and other associates, he was un- failingly kind, sympathetic, and eagerly helpful. In him indeed, graciousness of manner was no superficial vestment but rather the spontaneous expres- sion of genuine kindliness of spirit and distinction of thought. His students, his colleagues, and in truth all with whom he came in contact felt it a privilege to have known him and to have been associated with him. In his death we have sustained a great loss, but the influence and memory of his devoted work in the service of philosophy will long endure. (C. J. Ducasse) Orlin Ottman Fletcher who died October 20, I937, at the age of 90, was one of those superior men who keep their philosophic lights shaded by other interests throughout much of their lives, only to have them burst forth with an unusually illuminating glow in their latter years. Born July 29, 1847, in Scotland, Ontario, Canada, his early education was guided by the maxim that "with a good text-book, a good mind and a will to study, no one needed a teacher". He himself, however, became a teacher when but thirteen and taught throughout his teens and early twenties. In his middle twenties, concurrently, he studied law, intending to make that his vocation, but on the death of his young wife in I874, he turned to the ministry. For 34 years, 1874-1908, the service of the Baptist Church had his effective statesmanship. Meanwhile, he studied at Chicago University, 1880-83, earn- ing both the A.B. and B.D. degrees in three years while preaching, teaching mathematics, proof-reading for the Hebrew Review, and taking charge of President Harper's foreign correspondence. In I886 he took an A.M. degree at Colgate. He was nearing 6I before he found himself in circumstances in which he felt that he could honestly accept a university appointment. Furman University called him at that time, and from 1908-27 he taught philosophy and social sciences with a comprehensively informed outlook and a constructive view which led his students characteristically to regard him as by much their greatest teacher. In 1913 he published his Introduction to Philosophy, a substantial work which circulated over twenty years and won its author an immediate acknowledgment as a strong yet careful thinker. Among the institutions where he lectured on special invitation was Princeton University. Among the manuscripts which he left unpublished were studies in Medieval Philosophy and in contemporary trends and prob- lems. His was a spontaneously inquiring and likewise a continuously syn- thetic mind. Though a Scottish realist from his early background, he became convinced quite soon in life that a pure objective realism ignores the charac- ter of subjects in the experience-equation and lends itself to an unin- telligible pluralistic view. Objective idealism, on the other hand, enabled him to take full cognizance of minds as subjects of experience and of the universe as an intelligible whole and yet to "believe in the substantive reality of cognized objects, in the objective reality of their perceived modifications, in the objective reality of cognized relations, and in the objective reality of value and truth judgments". In practice, as in theory, 0. O. Fletcher was a realist in his idealism. (W. P. Warren) In the sudden death on September 9, I937 of Moritz A. Geiger, Professor of Philosophy at Vassar College, The American Philosophical Association lost a member of rare intellectual and personal gifts. Born on June 26, i88o in Frankfort, Professor Geiger studied philosophy at Munich, Leipzig, Gottingen, and also for a time at Harvard when James and Royce were teaching. Thereafter he taught philosophy, first at Munich and then in</page><page sequence="5">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLVII. Gottingen until I934, when he left Germany and became chairman of the Department at Vassar College. He was also twice a visiting lecturer at Leland Stanford. Moritz Geiger's philosophical views were formed along the lines of phenomenological realism under the double inspiration of Lipps and Husserl. He wrote with special distinction upon the philosophy of mathematics and of esthetics. What was most characteristic and significant was the living rapport of his philosophical thinking with developments in the general intellectual world of our time, in its sciences and arts. It was this rapport, coupled with a most appealing human warmth and a genial love of teaching, that qualified Moritz Geiger to interpret and exemplify the philosophical spirit to his students in a most effective and genuine sense. The success with which, in the short time of three years, he reworked the technical habits of thought developed during years of advanced work in German universities, so as to become a truly philosophical educator of American undergraduates, was an outstanding achievement, quickly ac- knowledged by the enthusiasm and esteem of his students and colleagues at Vassar. His last published book dealt with the relations between the ap- proach to reality in philosophy and in the sciences. He had recently begun to resume writing after the interruptions occasioned by the last few years. A book on esthetics was virtually completed in manuscript. There also exist chapters of a work devoted to the theme he so finely illustrated in his life: the cultivation of the human personality to a higher form of sub- jectivity by the mind's endeavor to acquire objective science. Though mis- fortune did not allow him to complete his work in America, we were greatly privileged to have his philosophical existence established so effectively amongst us for even a brief time. And we shall like to remember also his understanding enjoyment and appreciation of contacts with students and teachers in this country. (Horace L. Friess) The Nominating Committee (W. H. Sheldon, chairman, Harold A. Larrabee) presented the following nominees: for President, George H. Sabine; for Vice-President, Sterling P. Lamprecht; for new members of the Executive Committee, A. G. A. Balz to serve for two years, and Paul Weiss to serve for three years. All were unanimously elected. President Cunningham announced the following new appointments to the Nominating Committee: W. P. Montague, chairman, for one year to com- plete the unexpired term of the late Professor Everett, and C. I. Lewis for three years. Brief reports from the national committees on Publication and on the Carus Lectures were read by the secretary. Professor Ducasse, chairman of the national committee on Bibliography read the report which appears in these Proceedings. Professor Balz in his capacity as representative of the Eastern Division on the joint committee of the Eastern and Western Di- visions on Opportunities for Employment reported the activities and future plans of this committee. The following recommendations of the Executive Committee were pre- sented to the meeting and unanimously approved: (I) That the Division express to the National Board of Officers its interest in the international bibliography. (2) That the Division propose to the National Board of Officers that the present Committee on Bibliography be constituted a stand- ing committee of the National Association and that it be augmented to include members of the Association who would be suitable to act as liaison agents between the Association and the International Committee on Bibliog- raphy. (3) That a cordial vote of thanks be accorded to Professors W. I88</page><page sequence="6">No. 2.] AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION P. Montague and George P. Adams for the generous gift of $430.58 to the Philosophical Association for the purpose of aiding members to purchase copies of the first two volumes of the International Bibliography of Phi- losophy. (4) That the invitation of the American Documentation Institute that the Philosophical Association become a nominating agency for the Institute be referred with power to the Committee on Bibliography. (5) That the invitation of Wesleyan University for the 1938 meeting of the Division be accepted. (6) That the Division record its interest in and approval of the study of the status of the liberal arts and sciences in the college curriculum undertaken by the Senate of the United Chapters of the Phi Beta Kappa. On recommendation of the Executive Committee, the following were elected to membership in the Division: Active members: Dr. Richard B. Brandt, Prof. Peter A. Carmichael, Prof. Robert F. Davidson, Dr. Frederick C. Dommeyer, Prof. Christopher Browne Garnett, Jr., Dr. Thomas A. Goudge, Prof. Samuel G. Hefelbower, Dr. J. W. A. Hickson, Dr. Allison Heartz Johnson, Dr. Furman Gordon McLarty, Prof. Walter G. Muelder, Prof. Louis William Norris, Prof. Stephen B. L. Penrose, Jr., Prof. R. Bruce Raup, Dr. Pasquale Romanelli, Dr. Alden Weber, Dr. Julius Weinberg, Dr. Frederic L. Will, Dr. Milton Williams. Associate members: Mr. Sterling E. Hess, Mr. James P. Pettegrove, Dr. Lewis S. Feuer, Dr. Gerhart H. Saenger, Dr. Victor L. Dowdell. The Executive Committee unanimously recommended the approval by the Division of the proposal of the National Board of Officers that Article III, Section I, of the Constitution of the American Philosophical Associa- tion be amended as follows: "To the first sentence of Section I add, 'and a secretary elected by the foregoing members for a three year term and eligible for re-election'. Strike out sentences four and five of this section." By mistaking the provisions for constitutional amendment of the Eastern Division for those of the National Association the unanimous recommenda- tion of approval was presented to the Division but final vote was deferred until the next annual meeting. On recommendation of the Executive Committee it was voted that the National Committee on Bibliography consider bringing up to date Professor Schneider's Bibliography of John Dewey's writings; and that the program committee for I939 plan a divisional meeting (presumably at Columbia) in honor of John Dewey. On motion of Professor Montague a unanimous vote of thanks was extended to Princeton University and especially to the members of its Department of Philosophy for their cordial and gracious hospitality. At the banquet the following resolutions, presented by President Cun- ningham, were adopted: WHEREAS the history of philosophy, as of other branches of scholarship, plainly teaches that freedom of thought, of discussion, of teaching, and of inquiry are essential to the fruitful prosecution of its tasks; and WHEREAS, at the present time, these fundamental rights of the scholar are often invaded in practice and even denied in principle; I89</page><page sequence="7">THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW Now therefore we, the Eastern Division of the American Philosophical Association, assembled at our thirty-seventh annual meeting, do publicly affirm our conviction that unhampered investigation and the free interchange of ideas are indispensable for education and for the development of any high form of social and civic life; And we express to the American Association for the Advancement of Science and to the British Association our hearty approval of their efforts on behalf of the free search for truth, and we authorize the officers of our Association to cooperate with such efforts.
