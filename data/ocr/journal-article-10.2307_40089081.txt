Versions of the Popol-Vuh By E. Abreu Gomez The Popol-Vuh is one of the most valuable examples of primitive native literature in America. Hubert Howe Bancroft says that it is "in its strange, rude eloquence and poetic originality, one of the rarest relics of aboriginal thought." It is not easy to give an exact interpretation of its complex contents. Scholars have scarcely begun to accom- plish this. In its pages are fused mystical and historical elements which it is de- sirable to delimit scientifically and intel- ligently. It is necessary to distinguish the realm of dreams from the realm of facts. Father Francisco Ximenez, its first Castilian translator, said that its themes were like "stories for children." Some, rightly, have interpreted this opinion as irony on the part of the missionary. The Abbe Brasseur, its first French translator, gave importance to its historical signifi- cance. Max Miiller emphasized its lit- erary value. Rudolf Schuller believed that it was the interpretation of old Quiche pictorial writings. Rafael Girard attributes an esoteric meaning to it. Dan- iel G. Brinton observed, with good judg- ment, that it is dangerous to exaggerate unilateral interpretations. Part of its material is enigmatic. The core of its documental truth must be ap- proached from three points of view: the linguistic, the ethnic, and the religious. In fact it is necessary to progress in the literal interpretation of its text; to see what points derive from other native peoples (the Toltecs, for example); and what kinds of Christian interferences influenced its last Indian editor. The Popol-Vuh, at any rate, reflects the theo- ENRICO PEA</page><page sequence="2">NOT IN THE REVIEWS 143 logical concept of a people which ex- tended from the adoration of animals to the adoration of the stars, until it reached that of anthropomorphic beings. It must be said that even today it is a living book. Many of its legends survive among the Indians residing in Guate- mala and Yucatan. Its legends have gone beyond the limits of the hermetical. The artistic enjoyment of its episodes pre- vails over what the words depict or the metaphors hide. On the other hand, one must not rely, with too much reverence, on the order of its legends, since, com- ing from different sources and, more- over, of an oral character, the transpo- sitions which are evident are under- standable. These irregularities have al- ready been observed by Father Xi- menez and the Abbe Brasseur. Father Ximenez noted that unnecessary repe- titions exist in the text; and the Abbe agreed that many of its passages are transposed. It is known that the Quiche Indians of Guatemala kept a book called the Popol-Vuh. They kept it, possibly, writ- ten in hieroglyphic form or, perhaps, with more advanced characters, which we cannot read today. Perhaps this text was destroyed at the time of the fire in the city of Utatlan. After the Conquest, other Indians, familiar with the legends contained in the lost book, wrote it again, in Quiche but with occidental charac- ters. Some critics attribute to a single author (Diego Reynoso) the restoration of this book. This second version of the Popol-Vuh was kept for a century and a half in the rectory of the church of Saint Thomas of Chichicastenango (formerly Chuila) in Guatemala. Father Francisco Xime- nez discovered it at the beginning of the 18th century. This priest copied the Quiche text and translated it twice into Castilian; the first in a literal form and the second attempting to interpret better the meaning of its passages. The Quiche text discovered by Father Ximenez has also been mislaid. From its copy and from the cited versions come RODOLFO USIGLI the translated texts of the Popol-Vuh known today. It is not known with cer- tainty how many new copies have been made of the three manuscripts of Father Ximenez; nor can it be accurately deter- mined which of them some of its mod- ern translators have used.

Sancho, Anglo-Saxon ancestor of William James, pragmatic and realistic . . . plants himself on the coast in a pos- ture of defense against the Indians and Jack Frost; Sancho the farmer and woodcutter. The conquest of the Hinter- land comes later. Don Quixote - now called Cabeza de Vaca, now Almagro, now Pizarro - promptly struggles all over the continent, undeterred by the anfractuosities of the terrain, by the lofty mountains which before his day had been impassable, faithful to the defini- tion of the knight errant: 'He ventures into intricate labyrinths, at every step he achieves the impossible, he with- stands the burning rays of the sun on the desert "History has recorded the fruits of both enterprises. We of the Quixote clan are still scattered hither and yon: the Sanchos have held together steadily, even when the hour arrived for their trek to the West, always sure and solid of foot, to the conquest of a tangibly rich and dazzling El Dorado. We of the Quixote family know well that we are gallant knights, but for all our knightli- ness there are times when we would give an eye if we could emulate the solid achievements of Sancho." Stefan Andres By Karl O. Paetel [El Greco malt den Grossinquisitor. Miinchen. List. 1947. - Requiem fur ein Kind. Hamburg. Ellermann. 1948. - Wir sind Utopia. Miinchen. Blaue Presse. \9W.-Tanz durchs Laby- rinth. Dramatische Dichtung. Miin- chen. Piper. 1948.-] Some years ago, the Frankfurter Zeitung acclaimed Stefan Andres "one of the most absorbing young writers in Germany." This evaluation is thorough- ly corroborated by these four books, all of which are now available in conti- nental editions. Born 1906 in the Moselle region of Germany, Andres has never con- formed to traditional Western Christian thought; as a devout "heretic" he has never ceased to affirm the dignity of man and the autonomy of his conscience. Andres* parents had originally hoped that he would be ordained a priest; after serving a two-year novitiate with the order of the Capuchins, he concluded, however, that God is more authentically served in this, rather than the other, world. Yet Andres cannot be rightly called irreligious: like so many others of simi- lar post-nihilistic bent, he attempts a cross-cultural re-examination of con- temporary values. To this end, he stands completely detached from various re- ligious, philosophic, and political fads. This orientation, the leitmotif of Andres* total work, has been most sharply de- fined: "Know ye, it is useless to kill the inquisitor. More properly, we must seek to delineate the face of these blas- phemers of Christ." The prefatory comments to Wir sind Utopia - dedicated to German prisoners of war detained in England - refer, how- ever, to quite a different war. The au- thor describes how the transitory politi- cal commitments of life dissolve into the religious question of each individ- ual's personal death. His heroes echo those complex and perennially insolu- ble questions regarding the nature of Man and his relation to God. Just how such questions have obsessed all camps and all times is most radically summar- ized in Andres' Tanz durchs Labyrinth. In the five vignettes which comprise this prose-play, man's specific acts are seen as mere passing variants of the eternal</page><page sequence="4">NOT IN THE REVIEWS 145 struggle between Force and Freedom. Logically enough, one of the charac- ters who throughout the play is a pre- sumably detached, cynical observer, must, in the end, become an actual par- ticipant in the human condition. Only when stripped of his freedom can he voice the age-old cry: "Man is the meas- ure of all things!" This statement is not the naive senti- ment of a believer in eternal progress: it is a faith derived from Andres' most critical scrutiny of his own personal ex- perience. In the Requiem fur ein Kind; he puts it this way: "You did not understand - not a single word, And only later echoed in your void: You did not love enough! - the Master spoke." In a short biographical sketch, In Praise of Ancestry, Andres once speci- fied what he regarded his task as a writer. He wished "to free himself from multiple disturbances and in quiet sim- plicity, in a silence of creation which is this very drive to simplicity, seek a closer approximation to God." ALEX RICKENBACH, of the Legation of Switzerland, in charge of the Swiss Book Exhibit now touring U.S.A. A Minority Report "Dilettante in all the disciplines, but never a guide for the intelligence nor a reformer of society, nor a philosopher of existence, in its metaphysical sense, Goethe makes a poor showing. . . . blind from the light of the sun, he did not have eyes for the invisible nor ears for the. voice which speaks through the tor- mented soul of prophets. ... If sometime Goethe felt the Christian spirit it was according to the Lutheran atmosphere of the Reform. A subconscious aversion made him seek refuge in paganism. . . . All this nothingness of the Goethean message is enfolded, of course, in the magic of an unsurpassed poetry. . . . song without faith, music of images that do not make sense because he tries to apply to the spirit organic laws which belong to biology."

ERNST KREUDER, reviver of German Romanticism In Mexico and America the renascent movement of literary modernism had to wait for Amado Nervo before it could boast a great religious poet ... at first the religious theme is for Nervo rather a romantic recourse than a living experi- ence. There is something artificial, rhe- torical in his compositions of that period. . . . However that may be, we owe to Amado Nervo some of the most beauti- ful religious poetry that has been writ- ten in America, and certainly the most evangelical written until then. (La Nueva Democracia. Oct. 1949.) Under new directions issued by the Nobel Committee of the Swedish Acad- emy, societies of authors in all countries have been invited to suggest candidates. Whether this is a stroke for, or a blow against, the cause of true "world litera- ture" is at least an open question, for obviously these national societies are ex- pected to sponsor and to champion a "native son."</page></plain_text>
