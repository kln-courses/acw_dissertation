<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mapping Perceptions of Animal Experimentation: Trend and Explanatory Factors* Fabienne Crettaz von Roten, University of Lausanne Objective. The goal of this article is to map out attitudes toward animal exper- imentation in Switzerland, more specifically, to document the current attitudes, analyze the change of attitudes over the last 10 years, and explain these atti- tudes. Methods. This study analyzes a series of Swiss surveys that measure public attitudes toward the environment and science (ISSP, 1994, 2000; EB, 2001, 2005). Results. It is shown that the relative majority of Swiss are against animal research in 2005 and that refusals are increasing since 1994. Attitudes toward animal testing are explained by attitudes toward science, attitudes toward nature, and values. Conclusions. The study of attitudes toward animal experimentation makes important contributions to sociology and, in particular, to the public un- derstanding of science (PUS) research. For a long time, news agencies have reported on the activities of animal research opponents. Animal-rights activists vandalized many laboratories in the United States until the end of the 20th century but activism seems in a lull in recent years. In fact, most actions now occur in Europe; they can take diverse forms, such as hate campaigns, vandalism, verbal or physical attacks on scientists conducting experiments and pharmaceutical companies' share- holders, protests against the construction of animal research laboratories (University of Oxford and Cambridge, UK 2004), as well as calls for the retraction of research papers from scientific journals. Although some authors conclude that the opponents of animal testing are winning public sympathy, others state that the population has turned against animal activists (John- ston, 2006). In Switzerland, where the political system of direct democracy allows the public to launch a campaign to collect signatures for a so-called initiative on any subject, animal experimentation was the object of a referendum in 1985, 1992, and 1993. Each time, the citizens refused to abolish animal research. In addition, the number of experimental animals used fell strongly between *Direct correspondence to Fabienne Crettaz von Roten, Observatoire Science, Politique et Société, University of Lausanne, Bâtiment Vidy, 1015 Lausanne, Switzerland ( Fabienne.

The use of animals in experimental research parallels the development of sciences: among others, medicine, biology, pharmacology, biomedicine, and biotechnology (Baumans, 2005). In the case of monkeys, Haraway (1989) studies the creation of an important laboratory, by R. Yerkes, and she describes how primates became the most practical producers of knowledge that interests science-based industries. In the case of mice, Rader (2004) explores how their status came to be that of the omnipresent vertebrate experimental organism in biomedical sciences - in institutional and scien- tific terms. Recently, animal experimentation was again on the Swiss public agenda, with surprising results: in November 2005, an initiative succeeded in pre- venting the construction of an animal research laboratory at the University of Lausanne.1 Furthermore, there is a collection of signatures for an ini- tiative to restrict animal research at the Geneva University laboratories. Clearly, animal experimentation is an important political issue in Switzer- land that warrants further investigation. Contrarily to other countries, there are few results on the public's attitudes toward animal research in Switzerland: the goal of the present article is to fill this gap. In the United States, the National Science Foundation surveys show that between 1988 and 2001 the acceptance of animal experimen- tation decreased: in 1988, 53 percent of Americans approved animal re- search; in 2001, only 44 percent approved it (National Science Board, 2002). If one compares Europe (EU 15) between 2001 and 2005, one notes only a slight reduction in the acceptance of animal testing (45 percent in 2001 compared to 43 percent in 2005) while at the national level, many European countries record a strong reduction in the rate of acceptance (Denmark and Greece -16 percent, Portugal -12 percent, Sweden -10 percent; only two countries, Spain and Belgium, do not record a decrease) (Crettaz von Roten, 2006a). This article also investigates explanatory factors of current attitudes to- ward animal experimentation in Switzerland. The literature identifies two types of predictors: some are intrinsic to the experiment itself (type of research, particular species, animal suffering, and possibility of alternatives), while others are extrinsic, that is, related to the characteristics of the re- spondents (sociodemographics, conception of nature and science, psycho- logical factors, values) (Hagelin, Carlsson, and Hau, 2003; Serpell, 2004; Crettaz von Roten, 2006a). In this research, we document the role of the conception of nature and science on the perception of animal research. 1Analysis of the campaign shows that the opponents of the laboratory built their strategy on budgetary argument, the lack of trust toward the requests of the researchers, and in- creasing sensitivity to the animal cause (Blanchard, 2006).</page><page sequence="3">Mapping Perceptions of Animal Experimentation 539 Philosophers, historians, and social scientists have widely studied the var- ious conceptions of nature, including, among others, whether nature is considered spiritual or sacred or not, and including the type of relationship with human society - separation, with opposition between nature and hu- mans; connection, with dominion of nature by humans; or integration, with harmony between nature and humans (Frank, 1997; Strauss, 2005). Re- searchers have also stated that the conception of nature is socially con- structed and varies according to cultural and historical determinations. In the West, the redefinition of nature over the last century facilitated the emergence of world mobilization for the environment (Frank, 1997) and animal rights (Kruse, 1999; Taylor, 2005). In particular, since the 1970s, the animal-rights movement has challenged the use of animals in modern Western society by rejecting the idea of dominion of human beings over nature and animals and stressing the intrinsic value and rights of individual animals (Singer, 1975; Clark, 1984; Regan, 1988; Jasper and Nelkin, 1992). In a climate of ontological insecurity, defined as "the fragmented and fugitive nature of postmodern labour markets, communities and domestic relations" (Franklin and White, 2001:224), leisure activities associated with animals and pet keeping have increased, with companion animals becoming common objects of love, care, and protection (a shift from anthropocentrism to anthropomorphism).2 Therefore, pet ownership is likely to be associated with rejection of animal experimentation (Driscoll, 1992; Hagelin, Carls- son, and Hau, 2003). Besides the conception of nature, the opposing viewpoints about animal experimentation also concern science (Cothran, 2002): it questions whether animal experimentation is scientific, whether experimenting on nonhuman primates is vital to science, whether experimenting on dogs has led to med- ical breakthroughs, and whether scientists should pursue new forms of an- imal testing. Animal-rights activists have less faith in science and are more "willing to explore alternatives to the Western, reductionist, scientific un- derstanding" (Broida et al., 1993:136); they regret that modern science is linked to the pursuit of profit and they are "concerned with the (ethical) limits and (empirical) boundaries of modern science" (Taylor, 2005:7). A positive attitude to science seems likely to be related to animal exper- imentation approval. Our study aims to initiate a line of analysis that seeks to map out public perceptions of animal experimentation in Switzerland. This article, first, analyzes the evolution of attitudes toward animal research over the last decade, and then determines explanatory factors of these attitudes. 2A poster put up by opponents to the animal research laboratory at the University of Lausanne (2005) attempted to make the laboratory mouse look like a familiar animal, similar to a pet or animal cartoon character.</page><page sequence="4">540 Social Science Quarterly Methods Data The issue of animal research has not given rise to specific surveys in Switzerland. Therefore, we performed a secondary analysis of the Interna- tional Social Survey Program (ISSP) Environment survey (1993, 2000) and the Eurobarometer (EB) Science (2001, 2005). The ISSP survey3 is an annual, cross-national collaboration within which countries each undertake a survey on rotating issues with nationally rep- resentative samples of the adult population (sample size between 1,000 and 1,400). Twenty countries participated in the 1993 survey that dealt with environmental concerns; the Swiss National Science Foundation financed its realization a year later. Thirty-two countries, including Switzerland, partic- ipated in the 2000 Environment survey. The EB surveys,4 financed by the European Commission, have been conducted between two and five times per year since 1973; they measure the state of public opinion toward the European Union and other issues, in- cluding science. The national samples come from a multistage random de- sign of the adult population, with approximately 1,000 face-to-face interviews conducted. Twenty countries participated in the 2001 survey that dealt with attitudes toward science; the Swiss National Science Foun- dation financed its realization the same year. Thirty-two countries partic- ipated in the 2005 Science survey, including Switzerland. Measures of the Dependent Variable There are different questions that measure acceptance of animal exper- imentation. Hagelin, Carlsson, and Hau's (2003) review of surveys identifies three main variations in wording of the question: whether the type of re- search is specified, whether particular species are mentioned, and whether the word "pain" is used. Different phrasing of questions causes different answers within the same population. The ISSP and EB surveys do not use the same questions: "It is right to use animals for medical testing if it might save human lives" for the former, and "Scientists should be allowed to experiment on animals like dogs and monkeys, if this can help resolve human health problems" for the latter. To summarize, the questions specify the same type of research (medical re- search), and neither mentions the pain inflicted on the animals. However, the ISSP question does not state the particular species involved in the re- search and is thus a very broad measure, whereas the EB question specifies 3See (http://www.issp.org). See ( http:// ec. europa. eu/public_opinion/index_en. htm ) .</page><page sequence="5">Mapping Perceptions of Animal Experimentation 541 the species - "like dogs and monkeys." Previous studies have illustrated the effect of speciesism,5 that is, the use of dogs and monkeys results in lower support for experimentation than other species such as small rodents (Dris- coll, 1992, 1995; Hagelin, Carlsson, and Hau, 2003). Measures of the Independent Variables To investigate explanatory factors of current attitudes toward animal testing, the EB Science survey 2005 was used, as it is the latest survey with the greatest number of explanatory factors found in the literature. The independent variables are sociodemographic variables, scientific knowledge, and items measuring attitudes toward science and technology, attitudes toward nature, and values. Sociodemographic Background. In addition to gender (coded 1 for men; 2 for women), the following three variables were included in the analysis: age (in years), education (highest level achieved, transformed into three dummies: one differentiating the upper secondary level (coded 1) from the other levels (coded 0), one differentiating the tertiary level (1) from the other levels (0), and one differentiating the students (1) from the other levels (0)), and city size of residence (living in a city with more than 100,000 residents (coded 1), between 10,000 and 99,999 residents (2), between 2,001 and 9,999 residents (3), and less than 2,000 residents (4)). Scientific Knowledge . The level of scientific knowledge was measured us- ing 13 true/false questions about the theoretical and factual findings of science.6 Each item was dummy coded so that a value of 1 was assigned to the correct answer and a value of 0 to the incorrect answer and "don't know." The scores on these 13 questions were summed and then trans- formed into two dummies: one differentiating the low level of knowledge (0 to 4 correct answers coded 1) from the other levels (coded 0), and one differentiating the high level of knowledge (10 to 13 correct answers coded 1) from the other levels (coded 0). Attitudes Toward Science . Attitudes toward science are measured by 20 five-point Likert-type items,7 by level of information on new medical 5 Arbitrary discrimination on the basis of species membership.

Attitudes toward nature are measured by three five-point Likert-type items: "We have a right to exploit nature for the sake of human well being"; "We have a duty to protect nature, even if this means limiting human progress"; and "We have a duty to protect the rights of animals whatever the cost"; by level of information - on a three-point Lik- ert-type scale - on environmental pollution and by level of approval - on a four-point Likert-type scale - "of cloning animals such as monkeys or pigs for research into human diseases" and "of developing large biodiversity parks in Switzerland to protect and re-introduce animal and plant species." Values. Values are introduced by three items measuring how impor- tant - on a four-point Likert-type scale - the respondent considers: "toler- ance and respect for other people"; "protecting the dignity of any human unborn life"; and "protecting information about our private life from mis- use and exploitation." We performed an ordinary least square regression model with an iterative procedure (STEPWISE) to determine the simplest model. Findings Evolution of Acceptance of Animal Experimentation An analysis of the data shows that, since 1994, the acceptance of animal research has decreased consistently in Switzerland (Table 1). Particularly, the acceptance of animal research decreased by 4.2 points from 1994 to 2000, by 10.2 points between 2000 and 2001, and by 13.3 TABLE 1 Evolution of the Percentage of Acceptance of Animal Experimentation, ISSP and EB 1994-2005 Year 1994 2000 2001 2005 Acceptance of animal experimentation 62.4a 58.2a 48.0b 34.7b alt is right to use animals for medical testing if it might save human lives. Scientists should be allowed to experiment on animals like dogs and monkeys, if this can help resolve human health problems.</page><page sequence="7">Mapping Perceptions of Animal Experimentation 543 points from 2001 to 2005. Moreover, we observed an inversion of the majority's point of view: until 2000, more than 50 percent of respondents were in favor of animal testing (62.4 and 58.2 percent, respectively), in 2001, the percentage in favor was just below 50 percent (48 percent) and in 2005, the relative majority is against animal research (49.6 percent disap- prove whereas 34.7 percent approve). It is important to point out that the difference of 10.2 points observed between 2000 and 2001 is partly produced by the exact phrasing of the question used in each respective survey. If part of the decrease between 2000 and 2001 is due to the indicator, we should not overinterpret this interval of time, but focus on the two decreasing trends from 1994 to 2000, and from 2001 to 2005. Besides acceptance and rejection, some respondents choose explicit "don't know" or neutral responses "neither . . . nor" (NSRs). These responses suggest that the cognitive stimulus is insufficiently strong to produce a clear evaluative response to the attitude object. By quantifying those responses, we measure the difficulty of evaluating an object, that is, an index of cognitive and evaluative distance (CED) (Pardo and Calvo, 2006). For these authors, there are many possible reasons for a high CED: low salience of the object, complexity or cognitive barriers, and/or ambivalent perception. Animal experimentation is an issue on which few people have no opinion: the cognitive and evaluative distance is around 14 percent (e.g., 12.2 percent in 1994, 15.8 percent in 2005), which is considered to be quite low (in their study of science perceptions, Pardo and Calvo (2006) found an average CED of 24 percent). Finally, for animal experimentation, most of the CED are neutral responses, not "don't know" responses (e.g., 9.9 percent of neutral responses out of a total of 12.2 percent CED in 1994, 13.1 percent of neutral responses out of a total of 15.8 percent CED in 2005), indicating more ambivalence rather than low salience or cognitive barriers. Explaining Attitudes Toward Animal Experimentation How does one explain the current attitudes toward animal experimen- tation in Switzerland? The optimal model, which explains 30 percent of the variation in the attitudes toward animal experimentation, is multicausal and includes variables from four explanatory factor families: sociodemographic factors, and factors related to science, nature, and values (Table 2). A pos- itive beta coefficient indicates that an increase of the factor in question implies a higher degree of acceptance of the animal research, controlling for the other independent factors, whereas a negative beta coefficient indicates that an increase of the factor in question implies a lower degree of accep- tance of the animal research. Men are more likely to accept animal experimentation than are women. The acceptance of animal experimentation is also linked to positive attitudes</page><page sequence="8">544 Social Science Quarterly TABLE 2 Results from the Stepwise Regression Analysis to Explain Attitudes Toward Animal Experimentation on Selected Independent Variables, EB 2005 Unstand.

These five significant explanatory factors indicate that these five aspects of the relationship between science and society (informa- tion, engagement toward science, influence on everyday life, link between science and industry, and governance of science) intervene independently on attitudes toward animal research. Animal research advocates are found to have less protective attitudes toward animals, less desire to develop large biodiversity parks, more positive views of cloning animals, and to be less informed about environmental pollution. Finally, we find that animal experimentation acceptance is linked to a specific value: animal research supporters are less concerned about the pro- tection of information about private life. Other factors found significant in the literature (age, education, city size, scientific knowledge) are not significant once these 11 variables are incor- porated into the model (redundancy of information).</page><page sequence="9">Mapping Perceptions of Animal Experimentation 545 Discussion Following a downward trend, the relative majority of the Swiss popu- lation rejects animal experimentation in 2005. This result sheds light on recent political events in Switzerland, such as opposition to an animal re- search laboratory in the Canton of Vaud and an initiative to restrict animal research in the Canton of Geneva. Understanding attitudes toward animal testing is therefore an important political and sociological issue, with significant ramifications for the country. Perceptions of animal experimentation are explained by a multicausal system that exhibits similarities and dissimilarities with literature findings. More opposition to animal experimentation is found to be linked with women. This gender difference was explained, for some authors, by the different socialization patterns among men and women, which emphasizes a relational orientation of care for women as well as nurturing and empathy that extend to animals (Herzog, Betchart, and Pittman, 1991; Pifer, Shim- izu, and Pifer, 1994). Other authors suggested that this difference is linked more with women's experience of social inequalities (oppression and male domination), which incline women to embrace more egalitarian ideology: women see animals as a symbol of their own victimhood and are thus more concerned for the rights of animals and more opposed to animal experi- mentation (Donovan, 1990; Peek, Bell, and Dunham, 1996). Attitudes toward science constitute the most important family of explan- atory factors, with five significant items among 11 predictors of attitudes toward animal testing. However, our predictors differ from those of the literature: Broida et al. (1993) reported the influence of faith in science; Peek, Bell, and Dunham (1996) reported people's views of the harm posed by science. The latter predictors are global indicators, whereas we found indicators of engagement with science (scientific information, participation in debate, and involvement in decisions about science). This may be linked with the relationship between science and society: the attitudes toward sci- ence are on the whole positive in Switzerland but we observe an increase of negative and ambivalent attitudes. The support for research decreases from 81.3 percent in 2000 to 68.3 percent in 2005; the perception that the "benefits of science are greater than any harmful effects it may have" de- creases by 14 percent from 2001 to 2005 (Crettaz von Roten, 2006b). Among the successive explanations for the deteriorating relationship be- tween science and society,8 lack of active public participation is now em- phasized (Gibbons, 1999; Bauer, Allum, and Miller, 2007). Following our analysis, public engagement seems also pertinent in the case of animal 8Bauer, Allum, and Miller (2007) review key issues of public understanding of science research over the last 25 years, from the science literacy paradigm between 1960 and 1985 focusing on public deficit knowledge to the current paradigm from mid 1990s onward focusing on public participation ana deliberation.</page><page sequence="10">546 Social Science Quarterly experimentation. Finally, Pifer, Shimizu, and Pifer (1994) established an inconsistent relationship between scientific knowledge and attitudes toward animal research (positive relationships in some countries and negative in others). In the present analysis, the level of scientific knowledge is not significant once the above explanatory variables are included in the model. The significance of attitudes toward nature is consistent with previous results that found a connection between "pro-environment" attitudes and opposition to animal research (Pifer, Shimizu, and Pifer, 1994; Jerolmack, 2003). Animal experimentation opponents adopt a more holistic vision of humans' place within nature, one where human beings have a place in nature, not as dominators, but, rather, as protectors of animals, biodiversity, and the environment (Frank, 1997; Taylor, 2005). Finally, the presence of an item related to cloning animals among this group of predictors - with the highest beta coefficient - is not surprising because concerns toward cloning arise partly from the belief that it is "against nature" (Einsiedel, 2000:944), that is, cloning revives concerns of the unforeseen consequences of inter- fering with nature. On the whole, the Swiss respect and value nature: in 2000, 28.2 percent agreed that "[n]ature is spiritual or sacred in itself' (21.4 percent in 1994), and 17.1 percent agreed that "[n]ature is sacred because it is created by God" (14.2 percent in 1994). More, people give importance to respect and protection of nature and animals: in 2005, 93.1 percent believed that "[w]e have a duty to protect nature, even if this means limiting human progress"; 78.9 percent believed that "[w]e have a duty to protect the rights of animals whatever the costs." At first glance, the influence of valuing the protection of one's privacy on attitudes toward animal experimentation may appear quite surprising, but there are a number of hypotheses that may shed light on the findings. On one hand, preserving privacy is a fundamental right, established in the universal declaration of human rights; privacy is associated with autonomy, dignity, trust, and liberty, a series of issues that are raised in the animal research controversy (the dignity of laboratory animals, trust in animal ex- perimenters and the regulation system). On the other hand, the right of privacy concerns, in the information society, the ability of individuals to control the collection and use of personal information held by others, in particular with information and communication technology. Therefore, privacy may be linked with animal experimentation via the notions of rights, dignity, and trust, or via the notions of science and technology. The controversy over animal research is one of the most cited science controversies (Nelkin, 1995). In general, science controversies reflect an increase of ambivalent attitudes toward science and technology, but protests are "less against science than against the use of the scientific rhetoric to mask political and moral choices" (Nelkin, 1995:447). This is particularly true in Switzerland where, according to EB 2005, decisions about science and technology should be based on moral and ethical criteria (60.2 percent) and not on an analysis of the risks and benefits involved (24.1 percent) (Crettaz</page><page sequence="11">Mapping Perceptions of Animal Experimentation 547 von Roten, 2006b). With this 60.2 percent approval of ethical and moral decisional criterion in science, Switzerland is largely above the European average (32.9 percent), and is exceeded by only two other European coun- tries (Norway at 62.5 percent and Iceland at 64.3 percent). With 49.7 percent of inhabitants who often think "of the significance and the meaning of the life," the Swiss level of spirituality measured in this study is also above the European average (35.2 percent). Therefore, spiritual and ethical di- mensions, often excluded from the scientific debate in favor of technosci- entific arguments more easily negotiable, must be integrated in the democratic debate on animal experimentation. From the above elements of discussion, mapping perceptions of animal experimentation improves our understanding of the relationship between science and society because animal experimentation is an important point in the public's relationship with science. This line of research merits further developments: improving the indicators of perception of animal experi- mentation, exploring new predictors, and analyzing longitudinal data. Fu- ture research should also contextualize survey results through a framing of media coverage on animal experimentation. Finally, the asymmetry in the study of the relationship between science and society could be overcome by studies on scientists active in animal experimentation: their views, practices, and experiences with regard to public communication and engagement. Such studies would have practical outcomes, as it is one of the most difficult areas of public engagement for scientists (Rothwell, 2006).
