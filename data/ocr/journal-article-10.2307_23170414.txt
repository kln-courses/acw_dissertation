<plain_text><page sequence="1">SOCIAL ANALYSIS No. 14, December 1983 THE PROCREATIVE MODEL: The Social Ontological Bases of the Gender-Kinship System Anna Yeatman Increasingly, students of the social classification of persons by gender, and of the social relation between those so classified, locate these phenomena within a symbolic, or cultural, ordering of reality. In suggesting that sex difference enters into social life only as its reality is socially constructed, such studies are in line with Durkheim's proposition that society is the idea it has of itself.1 Here I want to pursue this direction and to argue that, where sex difference is deployed as a basis for the classification of persons into mutually exclusive gender categories, it is because of some specific way in which society understands its own life. Specifically, I want to argue that gender classification arises out of a particular type of cultural reason, and that this cultural reason is an aspect of a more general type of social ontology. In the still emergent tradition of gender studies, there are two, justly celebrated, theoretical analyses, each of which have provided the basis for further enquiry and debate. I refer to the two contributions by Rosaldo ( 1974) and Ortner (1974) respectively.2 Without in any sense detracting from what their contributions do achieve, I think it is reasonable to say that neither really locates the specific qualities of gender as an idea, let alone explores how that idea derives from certain ontological assumptions about the nature and bases of social life. Their arguments tend to elide the distinctive characteristics of a gender code: a clear index of this is the collapsing by each author of these characteristics into another order of dual classification of social being. Thus, Rosaldo collapses the masculine-feminine duality into that of "public" and "domestic"; and Ortner collapses it into that of "culture" and "nature". In this, Rosaldo and Ortner are not alone. There has been a general neglect of the social ontological bases of gender. I agree with the broad thrust of Langness's (cit. by Porter Poole 1981:118) contention that "The issue involved respecting the relative position of the sexes is not merely of men versus women but, rather, one involving fundamental historical, philosophical and religious convictions about the nature of the life process itself." However, I should wish to translate this claim less discursively. My central proposition here is that "gender" and "kinship" go together: they presuppose each other, and they belong to a type of social ontology which I propose to name "the procreative model." The procreative model is a theory of social life which accounts for its bases and continuity in terms of the idea of parentage. Others begin to glimpse the intrinsic connection between gender and kinship, but, as yet, this is, largely, an untheorised connection. In this, undoubtedly, they have not been helped by the highly convoluted and contested domain of kinship studies. Specifically, they have been positively hindered by the way debate in this domain is still structured by the issue of whether the fundamental bases of kinship are natural or social in character. As Craig (1979:94) points out: "What has been missing from the debate is a consideration of the philosophical aspects of kinship." This has had as its consequence an astonishing neglect of the relationship between what Craig calls "the ontological aspects of kinship" and the ontological aspects of what we regard as "myth". 3</page><page sequence="2">Until we locate these ontological aspects of kinship, I do not believe that we can determine "what kinship is all about", to adopt David Schneider's (1972) phrase. The perspective which sees kinship as the elaboration of a genealogy is correct, but only if this genealogy is understood as the outcome of the idea of parentage. Once kinship is conceptualised within what I am calling the procreative model of social life, it is possible to transcend, as well as to retain, the kernel of truth offered by the respective positions in the debate as to what kinship is all about. I refer to the debates between "genealogical" and "sociological" theories of kinship, on the one hand, and "descent" and "alliance" theories of kinship on the other.3 My intention here is to offer only a preliminary sketch of the procreative model and, specifically, to show that gender is a necessary aspect of the idea of parentage. Undoubtedly, this model as I present it will require considerable revision and refinement in future work, and this is as it should be. I have organised my explication of the procreative model into three sections. In the first section, I outline the general presuppositions of a traditionalist social ontology, i.e. one which is couched in terms of the procreative model. In this section I begin to use an ethnographic case for illustrative purposes, a case which I exploit further, and in more detail, in the following two sections. This is the case of the Walbiri Aborigines, for which I draw on the excellent ethnographies of the Walbiri provided by Meggitt (1962, 1972) and Munn (1973). In the second section of my argument, I focus more specifically on the idea of parentage, and argue that it requires to be differentiated into the two principles of patri-parentage and matri parentage. This differentiation concerns the macro-cosmic level of the social system: in other words, it involves the articulation of the social system in its integrity as a whole and continuous society, and it involves the internal segmentation of the social system. My point is that the macro-cosmic differentiation of parentage by gender is related to, but is not the same thing as, the gender classification of individual persons. In my third section, I proceed to discuss the gender classification of individual persons and to show how it, too, is a necessary outcome of the idea of parentage. I complete the paper by offering a few concluding remarks. I I now want to present a broad profile of the social ontology which is the basis of a gender-kinship system. This profile is, needless to say, of ideal-typical status. This type of social ontology, for reasons which I will explain, identifies society with a specific life-world, which is understood to be "the" world. There is, accordingly, a marked tendency for this social ontology to merge with a cosmology and a cosmogony. And, again for reasons which will become evident, cosmology and cosmogony tend to merge: i.e. the laws governing the world and its continuities tend to be identified with the laws of coming into being in a primordial sense. In this cosmogony-cosmology, the dynamic of the generation and the renewal of life — as a life-world and its particular components — is located in a divine, or semi-divine, creative life-force. This life-force operates, in both primordial and secular time, in terms of the procreative model. Before this life-force creates the world it is an undifferentiated whole, which contains within itself all potential determinations of reality, including those which account for difference. Once the world, i.e. a life-world which is ordered, differentiated, and named accordingly, is created, it must be continually regenerated. This regeneration recapitulates the primordial coming into being of the world. Regeneration of the life-world occurs through the effective invocation of the life-force by human members of that life-world. They can effectively invoke the 4</page><page sequence="3">regenerative powers of the life-force because they are derivations of it, and, accordingly, share some degree of identity with it. Their own coming into being, and their trans-generational continuity, depend on the effective translation into actuality of the creative life-force. We have, in effect, one life-world which is being regenerated continually through the actualised creative potency of this divine life force. Several points may be made about this type of social ontology. First, since the life-force generates and regenerates the world, including what we "modern" social scientists discern as a society, its moral agency informs all existence, and the laws of coming into being by dint of this agency are seen to cover all that exists. No special identity accrues to "society" within this cosmos, because it has no distinctive laws of its own. The "modern" tendency to distinguish between "society" and "nature" holds no meaning nor value for this type of social ontology. Second, there is in this construction of reality no "historical" time. There is no "accumulation" of an object-world, since all that occurs is a perpetual re-generation of the world that was originally created. "Social" practices and ways of seeing are legitimate only as they conform to the "word" of the life-force, which, in creating everything, named and ordered them. This social ontology implies, then, a strictly traditionalist and customary epistemology: '"We must do what the gods said in the beginning'; 'Thus the gods acted, thus men act'" (Eliade 1958:417). There is no "past", "present", and "future". Instead, there is, first, the eternal time — what Eliade ( 1958:430; and see 1954) calls "the 'eternal now' of mythical time" — of the original creation and its perpetual re-generation. In contrast to this sacred, primordial, cosmic life-cycle are the secular or profane rhythms of the created world in its phenomenal aspects: the rhythms of profane, everyday experiences, or what Munn (1973:88), in reference to the Walbiri, calls "the micro-temporal cycling of daily life". Within primordial time is a distinction between the regeneration of the communal character of the life-world and the regeneration of individual members of whatever species who belong to that life-world. These temporalities are expressed as two distinct levels of the operation of the "eternal now". Finally, the idea of a creative life-force is a primitive idea of the will.4 This is expressed in two respects. First, as generative potency — i.e. prior to its realisation — the creative life-force is an undifferentiated whole which, because it is the source of all determination, is itself undetermined: in this sense, it is self-created. Secondly, the realisation of this generative potency conforms to the logic of realisation or, objectification, of the will. The realisation of the creative life-force means it assumes the form of finite or limited determinations, which, in their aspect of limitation, contrast with the undetermined aspect of generative potency as such. It also means that the life-force assumes objective or phenomenal form, which presupposes that the life-force finds presented to it materials or forms through which it can work, just as these materials or forms become imbued with "life" only as they are infused by the life-force. As we shall see, if the life-force is a primitive idea of the will, it is one which binds the will within a vitalist ontology, and constrains its creative assertion to take the form of pro-creation. Thus, to recapitulate these points in some more concrete fashion, we find in "myth" a postulated creation ex nihilo (see Eliade 1958:ch. 7, and 1969:ch. 5): this is the idea of the self-created will. The creation ex nihilo is the coming into being of, simultaneously, the (pro-)creator will(s), and the material of its (their) realisation. This may be the point, as it is for the Australian Aborigines, at which the life-force is expressed as the coming into being of ancestral heroes, who confront a landscape which, through their wandering over it, they shape and name.As Eliade (1969:35) remarks in reference to the Aranda tribes: "Such works constitute properly speaking a cosmogony; the ancestors did not create the earth but they gave form to 5</page><page sequence="4">a pre-existent materia prima. ' The account in "Genesis" (King James version of the Holy Bible:ch. 1, v's. 1 and 2) conforms to the same logic: "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth"; "And the earth was without form": so God proceeds to give it form by creating the different elements, all the different species of fish, beast, fowl, and vegetation, and by creating human life. Meggitt (1972:71) usefully distinguishes the pre-actualised potency of the life force, and the phenomenal world to which this life-force gives life, as the "noumenal" and "phenomenal" aspects of "existence" respectively. Actually, we confront here three terms of "reality": the life-force as such; the phenomenal world which depends for its on-going existence on a revivification by the life-force; and, vivified phenomenal entities, which thereby are existences which have both noumenal and phenomenal aspects. As such existences, human beings have both these phenomenal and noumenal aspects. It is through their noumenal aspect that they can invoke the re-generative potency of the life-force. If it is the case that society can conceive for itself no discrete existence relative to the life world of which it is part, nevertheless the distinctive characteristic of social life as a mode of life which "thinks" itself is clearly expressed in this idea of the noumenal aspect of human existence. It is this which justifies my location of this cosmogony-cosmology as a type of social ontology. It is the special task of invoking, which is to say, willing, the regenerative power of the life-force that falls to the human members of the life-world concerned. Their noumenal aspect is a derivative power of creation. And, if they credit a non-human creature with this power, it appears to be because this creature is the form through which the life-force chooses to operate, not because this creature, or the species to which it belongs, are, in themselves, phenomenally manifest derivations of the life-force.5 The derivative creator identity of humans is expressed, e.g., in "Genesis", where it is proposed that "God created man in his own image" (ch. 1, v. 27, emphasis in the original): thus, the "breath of life" which God breathed into the dust from which he formed man, (ch. 2, v. 7), is a particle of the divine life-force itself. It is this which explains why God gave man dominion over, and correlative responsibility for, the life-world in which he found himself.6 If humans become derivative creators whose creative power derives from that of the life-force, the life-force in its turn depends, for its effective existence, on their invocation of it. In this way we can gloss Evans-Pritchard's (1956:144) aphorism: "Religion is the reciprocal relation between god and men". If we accept something like the drift of Durkheim's ( 1915:466) proposition, "If religion has given birth to all that is essential in society, it is because the idea of society is the soul of religion", we reduce the life-force to the status of an anthropomorphic projection. What is significant, however, is the consequences for how society understands its own life when such a projection is operative. The most important consequence is that society projects its own agency and creativity onto the life-force and its expressions in ancestral heroes and the like. Since society has no discrete identity in relation to the life-world, there can be no conception of societal continuity. That is to say, humans cannot distinguish what they have created as a separate and enduring domain of objects, which, as objectifications of human agency, function to distil and secure a transgenerational identity for society. Trans-generational continuity there is in the traditional social ontology, but it is a continuity which derives not from a sense of history, viz. the accumulated objectifications of human agency through time. Instead, it derives from the continuity of the life-force, or, more accurately, from its eternal presence. It is the cycle of replacement of one generation of humans by another which attests to the perpetuity of the life-force. Trans-generational continuity is expressed as the 6</page><page sequence="5">perpetual generation of new human lives. This is why, in the traditional social ontology, as Hocart (1936:65) puts it: "Procreation is... the prototype of creation". Thus far, I have discussed the general features of the traditional type of social ontology. Meggitt's (1972:71) analytical presentation of the meaning of the "dreamtime" for the Walbiri aborigines effectively illustrates most of these features: The dreamtime, however, is not seen merely as a discrete period of activity that occurred once and for all early in a temporal sequence, which, in doing so triggered subsequent events so that they inevitably recur through time. Rather, the dreamtime is also an enduring level of being which continues as a noumenal ground that parallels and sustains the ongoing flow of phenomenal existence. Men, as representatives par excellence of the phenomenal world, must constantly act, using the ritual innovations of the dreamtime as models, to stimulate the causal efficacy of the dreamtime which, in turn, through spiritual, noumenal catalysts, guarantees the continuity of the phenomenal events. Indeed, the continuing reproduction of living species, whether floral or faunal, depends on the recurrent absorption by their phenomenal progenitors of such noumenal entities. Similarly, the contemporary recounting of the totemic myths and the charting of the related songs, by reproducing the processes of naming begun by the dreamtime heroes, help to define anew the patterns to which the phenomenal world conforms. These ideas are, in effect, the Walbiri gloss on Durkheim's distinction between the sacred and the profane. I now want to turn to the way in which this traditional social ontology takes the form of what I have called the procreative model. The nature of the life-force is condensed in the idea of parentage. I must stress, as will become increasingly apparent, that it is the idea of parentage which is at issue, and that this idea is one of macro-cosmic dimension. The conception of the life-force is a conception of creation in terms of procreative power. In this sense, the life-force is the parent of all those beings which owe their existence to it. Since the life-force becomes effective in its procreative and regenerative power only as it is ritually mediated by the human members of a life world, it is these human ritual principals who stand for, and express, this idea of parentage. I will now elaborate these points, with illustrative reference to the Walbiri case. The Walbiri idea of the dreamtime is the cosmogony-cosmology which is the underpinning of the Walbiri as a moral community: it is the reference point for the collective identity of the Walbiri. In general terms, the Walbiri idea of the dreamtime conforms to that of other Australian Aboriginal societies. In the dreamtime, supernatural ancestors — ancestral "heroes" — emerged from the ground: The forms of these chtonian beings were varied; some emerged in animal forms, others as men and women. But all of them had something in common: the theriomorphic ones acted and thought like humans, and those in human forms could change at will into a particular species of animal. These chtonian beings, commonly designated totemic ancestors, began to wander on the surface of the earth and to modify the land, giving the ... landscape its actual physical features. Such works constitute properly speaking a cosmogony; the ancestors did not create the earth, but they gave form to a préexistent materia prima. (Eliade 1969:84-85). Meggitt's (1972:71) account confirms the relevance of Eliade's account of the Aranda cosmogonie myth to the Walbiri case, and makes some additional points: ... the dreamtime entities, whether theriomorphic or anthropomorphic, brought order, meaning and obligation to the world, so that all of its 7</page><page sequence="6">constituent elements, natural and human, became amenable to common lawful processes and regularities that are still operative. The dreamtime beings effected this transformation partly by performing for the first time the rituals that Walbiri enact today and partly by simply giving names to the ñora, fauna, and topographical features they encountered and sang about in their travels. Part of this dreamtime bequest is the very culture the people now possess — their technology, social groupings, rituals, moral and jural norms, and, not least, their metaphysical monism that regards man, society, and nature as interlocking and interacting components of a larger, functionally integrated totality. In their view, each part of this system has an eternal, moral commitment to maintain itself unchanged for the benefit of the others and to contribute to the integrity and proper functioning of the whole. As these ancestral heroes tracked across the country, they left particles of their "fertility power, the power of generation" (Munn 1973:29) in the soil. They then returned into the earth (Meggitt 1962:60), but their fertility power, in specifically localised ways, remained in the world. It is this which allows it to be the effective noumenal underpinning of the phenomenal life-world of the Walbiri: "Although the totemic beings either departed from the Walbiri territory or vanished into the earth within it during the dreamtime, they still exist and their powers and actions directly affect the contemporary society" (Meggitt 1962:60). In this cosmogony-cosmology, creation is conceived in terms of the idiom of procreation. More pointedly, we can say that creation is conceived as parentage. The Walbiri cosomogony-cosmology may be viewed as an extended elaboration of the idea of parentage, a point to which I will return in the next section. At this point, I want to indicate the way in which the supernatural heroes are ancestors, or parents, of the Walbiri. They are ancestors of the Walbiri, because each Walbiri is the incarnate form of a particle of the generative power of these beings: As invisible potency, they are thought of as being localized inside the ground or inside the bodies of human beings and other living creatures. Thus, when a woman becomes pregnant, Walbiri say that she has been entered by the guruwari of a particular ancestor. The standard explanation is that a small childlike creature (guruwalba) who lives in the trees at ancestral sites has thrown a missile (for example, a boomerang) at the woman, and so lodged in her the guruwari of the ancestor associated with the site. This guruwari is also inside the child when it is born. The guruwari of a kangaroo ancestor, for example, is contained in the localities to which he traveled, in living kangaroos, and in human beings whose mothers were impregnated by the guruwari of this ancestor (Munn 1973:29). In this way, each Walbiri person is a derivative expression of the ancestral life force, as this is expressed in a community of ancestral heroes. When a Walbiri dies, and the incarnate form, which a particle of the life-force had animated, perishes, this generative particle returns to the ancestral pool of procreative power. As life-givers, the ancestral heroes are the "parents" of the Walbiri. As is clear, this idea of parentage connotes a shared connection in the same life-force between the ancestral hero and his progeny. This shared connection is a lineal principle, which represents the continuity of a particular regenerative cycle. In the phenomenal world, this lineal principle is expressed as the idea of common descent linking three generations, where the third generation represents the replacement of the first generation, and where the idea of parentage is dramatized in the connection between the second and third generations. The continuity of this regenerative cycle derives from the perpetuity of the ancestors and their procreative power. It is their</page><page sequence="7">perpetuity which is the guarantee of the perpetuity of the Walbiri, and of their life world. As suggested, if the idea of parentage connotes a perpetual "line", it also connotes the circle, or cycle, of generation, death, and regeneration.8 This eternal cycle of generation, death, and regeneration is differentiated to become an asymmetrical relation between two terms: the eternal, supernatural ancestors, or life-givers; and the Walbiri, their incarnate and perishable manifestations in the phenomenal world. Just as the relation of parentage between ancestral hero and his progeny is phenomenally manifest as a relation of parentage between two adjacent generations of Walbiri, this asymmetrical relation becomes the basis of classification of the Walbiri by gender. I will develop this argument in the third section of this paper. It is the idea of parentage, then, which determines this account of "origins" in terms of the generative powers of ancestral heroes. More accurately, this idea of parentage is the idea of a parental will. This comes out clearly in the way in which the ancestral parents never "die", but are perpetual (pro-) creators in relation to a life-world they produce and regenerate. The identification of the ancestral heroes with a parental will is expressed in two further features of how they are conceived by the Walbiri. First, they are self created, which expresses their freedom from determination.9 Second, and as a corollary, their freedom is expressed in their pansexual or androgynous character. Stated more precisely, their generative potency is a universal procreative potency, limited by neither male nor female procreative characteristics, but combining both. I want to stress this androgynous character of the cosmogonie parental will(s): Eliade's comparative discussion of divine androgyny is pertinent here. In particular, he (1974:420-44) points to "the androgyny of the first men". Elsewhere (1960:173-176), Eliade discusses the sacred or "cosmic hierogamy, the marriage between Heaven/Earth" as a "cosmogomic myth of the widest distribution". He comments (1960:176, emphasis in the original) further: Androgyny is an archaic and universal formula for the expression of wholeness, the co-existence of the contraries, or coincidentia appositorum. More than a state of sexual completeness and autarchy, androgyny symbolises the perfection of a primordial, non-conditioned state. It is for this reason that androgyny is not attributed to supreme Beings only. Cosmic Giants, or mythical Ancestors of humanity are also androgynous. Adam, for example, was regarded as an androgyne ... A mythical Ancestor symbolises the commencement of a new mode of existence; and every beginning is made in the wholeness of the being. To this point, I have argued that the creative life-force is conceived in terms of the idea of parentage. To conclude this section, I want to return to an earlier point, namely, that the effective translation of the life-force into phenomenal reality depends on human action. The distinctive type of action involved is ritual. There is a real sense in which we find here an inversion of the cosmogonie procreative relationship: through ritual, it is human actors who "give birth" to the ancestral heroes. This they do through becoming identified with the ancestral life-force by making sensory contact — through wearing, speaking, eating (etcetera) — with the phenomenal forms (or "totems") in which the life-force is thought to inhere. By so doing, these ritual actors themselves become embodiments of the life-force. They can proceed to regenerate their world, or, at least, to secure the conditions of its regeneration, because they have become this cosmogonie power.10 Among the Walbiri, for example, a particular body design represents the phenomenal manifestation (the guruwari) of a particular dreamtime ancestor." In the painting of this design on a ritual principal's body, the ancestor is re-embodied: 9</page><page sequence="8">his re-embodiment is this particular human being wearing the guruwari on his body.12 In her discussion of the Walbiri Banba or fertility ceremonies, Munn (1973:185-186) elaborates: In the construction of ceremonial paraphernalia and the decoration of the dancer, the ancestor is reembodied. The term balga is often used in this context. It denotes physical presence, flesh or body, as well as material plenty. Expressions such as balgadjari, 'to be born', or balga-ma-ni, 'to bring into being', 'make physically present', may be used to refer to the ceremonial construction of guruwari. Referring to a kangaroo ceremony, one man remarked that the patrilineal lodge owing the ceremony might ask the workers to prepare the ceremonial paraphernalia by saying, "You make meat. It will be born then. It will have fat. I want to eat". He also explained in English, "You make'm father, I want to eat." The ceremonial constructions reembody the ancestor and as part of this process aid in continuing the supply of kangaroos in the country; that is, in effect they reembody the kangaroos as well. The human ritual principals proceed to (re-) enact the creation, an event which is couched in procreative idiom, and which includes symbols of both male and female sexuality (see Munn 1973:191-208). Even when it is the regeneration of a particular species, or of a type of life giving phenomenon (e.g. rain), which is the object of ritual, and it is, therefore, the ancestor responsible for this particular aspect of the life-world who is reembodied, the ritual acting out of his generative power conforms to the structure of the cosmogony in general.13 In becoming the ancestral life-force, the ritual principals are "taken out of profane 'becoming'" and are placed within the dreamtime: "Every ritual, and every meaningful act that man performs repeats a mythical archetype; and ... this repetition involves the abolition of profane time and placing of man in a magico-religious time which has no connection with succession in the true sense, but forms the 'eternal' now of mythical time" (Eiade 1958:429-430). II Gender is contained in the principle of parentage. That is, parentage must of necessity be expressed as a dual principle: patri-parentage and matri-parentage. Gender differentiation is, at bottom, this differentiation of parentage. Before I proceed to argue this proposition, it will be useful to have some illustrative materials at hand. Once again, I draw on the Walbiri case. In Walbiri society, the central axes of the idea of parentage are clearly marked, both as structural principles of Walbiri social organisation, and as a symbolic grid for Walbiri lived experience and ritual. These axes are, first, the synchronic differentiation of parentage into patri- and matri-parentage; and, second, the diachronic differentiation of parentage as a distinction between parents (progenitors) and their children (progeny). The social structural expression of the idea of parentage comrpises the so called subsection system of the Walbiri. Munn ( 1973:13-15) neatly summarises the coordinates of Walbiri social structure: Walbiri social structure includes groups and categories built out of patrilineal, matrilineal and generational principles. Walbiri recognise three type of moiety divisions: patrilineal, matrilineal and generation moieties. The latter are constituted by the separation of adjacent generations and the equation of alternate ones. The matri- and patrimoieties are both exogamous, whereas the generation moieties are endogamous. The subsection system organises the differentiation of, and relationship between, 10</page><page sequence="9">these patrilineal, matrilineal and generational principles. The most economical way to present the subsection system is diagramatically, and here I reproduce Munn's (1973:17) diagram. FIGURE 1 THE WALBIRI SUBSECTION SYSTEM A2 Ego, B, S. S, F.

Ego, etc., (italicised) - additions made by present author 11</page><page sequence="10">The subsection system articulates Walbiri society as a community of parentage, subdivided in accordance with the internal principles of differentiation of parentage. In terms of the classificatory grid which constitutes the subsection system, all Walbiri are "kin" to each other. Clearly, both "descent" and "marriage" are entailed in this structural expression of "parentage". Indeed, marriage functions to provide matrilineal links between the two patrimoieties: thus, ego's Z's S (or, D) and his mother belong to the patrimoiety opposite to his own. Both his wife and his mother belong to the same patrimoiety, but they belong to opposite matrimoieties. It is patri-parentage which symbolically represents the lineal continuity, or corporate character, of Walbiri society. This is expressed in the following ways. Each patricouple of subsections contains several patrilodges: sons are initiated into their father's lodge. Each lodge is the ritual principal for a specific ancestral dreaming, and they are responsible in this role to, ultimately, the Walbiri community as a whole. In this regard the patrilodges are components of a ritual division of labour. Each has, as its role, the task of maintaining a specific ancestral procreative potency with regard to persons and to a specific species, or life-giving element (e.g. rain), in the Walbiri life-world. Thus, the patrilodges are responsible for ritually securing the pools of guruwari, which enliven foetuses, and the species, vegetation, and general environment on which the Walbiri depend. As Meggitt (1962:212) puts it: "Each dreaming... occupies a definite place in the overall unity of man and nature, and its lodge has an homologous status in the total system of lodges and dreamings; the patrilines thus have complementary ritual functions in maintaining the whole socio-religious framework". The patrilodges are corporate in character. Their perpetuity derives from the perpetuity of the specific ancestral dreaming with which they are associated. This association means that the ancestors themselves are conceived as belonging to one of the four father-son subsection couples (Munn 1973:25). The corollary of this is that, while a lodge is the immediate ritual "master" of a specific ancestral dreaming (Munn 1973:25; Meggitt 1962:ch. 12), these rights belong, in a classificatory sense, to all men of the subsection pair from which the lodge is drawn, and, ultimately, to men of the same patrimoiety (Munn 1973:25). In summary, then, the principle of patriparentage articulates the cosmic life forces to which the Walbiri owe their coming into being, and on which their regeneration depends. Patriparentage has generic and genetic aspects. The generic aspect is expressed in the patrilodge's responsibility for a specific ancestral dreaming and the life-giving power it represents with regard to both the Walbiri community and some specific features of their life-world. The genetic aspect is expressed in the lodge's responsibility for maintaining ancestral creative potency through which specific Walbiri individuals come into being. Since a Walbiri father need not have the same individual guruwari as his children do (Meggitt 1962:208; Meggitt 1972:78), this genetic responsibility is indirect. However, a Walbiri father has direct genetic responsibility for his son's assumption of his patri-spirit through his initiation into his father's lodge. As brothers of the same lodge, and sons of the same ancestral dreaming, fathers and sons assume the same identity: thus, regardless of generational affiliation, all patri-lodge members become a community of brothers, and they "regard their common dreaming as father" (Meggitt 1972:76). Fathers and sons are custodians of their shared patri-spirit, which they hold in trust for their daughters and sisters:14 "Yalyu-djinda, 'one blood', is an expression Walbiri men use to refer to the unity of the patrilineal lodge (women do not share this 'blood')" (Munn 1973:192). The matrimoieties are, also, internally differentiated. The principle of differentiation operates in relation to a given individual, and specifies for him or her a range of maternal relatives, or, matriline. Accordingly, these rnatrilines are not 12</page><page sequence="11">corporate lineages, like the patrilodges (see Meggitt 1962:201). They function as a group in relation to an individual's betrothal, marriage and death.15 Just as the patrilodge entails a shared "social personality" (Meggitt 1962:210) among its members, members of a matriline share in the same matrispirit: Although, like a lodge patrispirit, it is called bilirba, the matrispirit does not represent any particular natural species, or object and has no other title to distinguish it from the spirits shared by members of other matrilines. It is regarded as a non-material, pallid, tiny 'child' that resides either in a woman's uterus or behind her navel. When she is pregnant, a part of her matrispirit transfers to the foetus, where it becomes a double of the parent spirit. A man's matrispirit is located in his kidney fat (Meggitt 1962:192). We can locate these principles of parentage at the level of an individual Walbiri's identity. The "individual" aspect of his or her identity is constituted by his or her conception dreaming (or guruwari). At the same time, the mode of acquisition of this individual identity marks the Walbiri individual as a "child" of one particular ancestral "parent" or other. Accordingly, the individuation of the Walbiri emanates from their shared community of ancestral parents: "whereas the assumed possession of conception dreamings helps to account for the fact that all Walbiri are human and are people, albeit intimately related to other species, their random acquisition explains why all Walbiri differ as individual personalities" (Meggitt 1972:88). In contradistinction to the individual aspect of an individual personality is a collectively shared component of his or her personality. This component is differentiated by gender. Men's "social personality" is constituted by both a patrilodge spirit and a matrispirit. This is the basis for men being able to represent both principles of patri- and matri-parentage. Women's "social personality" comprises only their matrispirit. I will turn to the reasons for this gender differentiation of identity constituted through parentage. For the present, I simply want to indicate the way in which all aspects of a Walbiri's identity are constituted by the principle of parentage, and to point out that gender differentiation of parentage enters into the constitution of this identity. Up to this point, I have argued that the principle of parentage is differentiated by gender. It remains for me to show the necessity of this differentiation, that is, to show that the idea of parentage requires gender differentiation. In particular, I wish to propose that the idea of parentage cannot emerge except as gender functions to differentiate it. This is achieved by gender in several key respects. It is first necessary to distinguish the general differentiation of parentage by gender into the principles of patri-parentage and matri-parentage from the classification of persons in terms of gender. These are both elementary aspects of the idea of gender, and they arise from the same general structure of thought. However, they are to be distinguished because they correspond to two different principles of articulation of what we may term the "social system". The differentiation of parentage into patri- and matri-parentage corresponds to a macro-cosmic principle of articulation of the social system, where what is at issue is the integrity of the social system as a system, and its internal segmentation. The differentiation of persons by gender corresponds to the principle of articulation of the social system which links and integrates its corporate, or communal, and its individuated levels of social action. These propositions will become clearer as I proceed. Thus, first, I want to show that the idea of parentage cannot serve as a principle whereby the social system is both secured as a system and internally segmented except as gender differentiates parentage into patri- and matri-parentage. The 13</page><page sequence="12">following points may be made. The idea of parentage signifies the continual generative and regenerative action of a cosmic life-force in relation to a specific community and its life-world. This community constitutes its identity and its corporate or perpetual character in these terms. The idea of such lineal continuity requires to be set off in relation to what is not continuous in this way. Among the Walbiri, patri-parentage represents the cosmic life-force, and, accordingly, it stands for the integrity and perpetuity of Walbiri society. Matri-parentage, by contrast, lacks this corporate character, and, in so doing, serves to highlight the significance of patri-parentage. More substantively, insofar as the matriline concerns the betrothal, marriage and death of individuals, it, in a generic sense, stands for the perishability and life-cycle of individuals in contrast to the patriline's evocation of the perpetuity and continual regeneration of the whole. Secondly, matn-parentage functions to differentiate the idea of parentage in a crucial way. Taking the Walbiri case once more, it can be seen, in regard to the subsection system, that father and son have mothers who belong, respectively, to different subsections, and, more critically, to different matri-moieties. Accordingly, while father and (initiated) son are of the same substance in sharing the same patri-spirit, and in representing a particular aspect of the cosmic life-force, their respective matri-spirits, or matri-substances, are different. Now, the idea of parentage requires that the distinction between progenitor and progeny be culturally inscribed. Otherwise, the procreative re-generation of a life-world cannot find expression in social action. The Walbiri inscribe this distinction in their differentiation between adjacent generations; but the generational subsection division can have no force unless there is something which substantively distinguishes the identity of father and son. It is matri-parentage which functions to mark the distinction between progenitor and progeny. At the same time, the replacement value of the third for the first generation is marked in the way in which ego and his grandfather have the same matri-substance, and share the same patri substance: they share exactly the same "social" personality. Finally, matn-parentage functions to provide the internal principles of segmentation of the Walbiri community. The patri-moieties, and their patrilineal sub-segments (or, sections) are differentiated by distinctions of matri-parentage, just as these distinctions function simultaneously to provide links between the two patri-moieties (see fig. 2). As we can see also from figure 2, wives are an additional means of conferring on each patri-segment and patri-subsegment a distinct identity, as well as providing an additional set of links between the two-patri moieties. Since I would regard "mothers" and "wives" as different expressions of the same broad principle of matri-parentage as it emanates from the procreative model, we may say that matri-parentage functions to secure the internal differentiation of this patri-laterally defined procreative community. In this, matri parentage entirely conforms to the way in which any principle of "differentiation" operates: it divides while at the same time it links up, through making mutually dependent, whatever societal sections are at issue. In providing the basis for the internal differentiation of this procreative community, matri-parentage indicates the way in which the idea of parentage is required to conform to the logic of social life, for society by its nature connotes differentiation or some kind of plurality, rather than the one. It is to be noted that, while I have selected a patri-lineal society as my case in point, the essence of my argument is that the idea of parentage requires a differential between patri- and matri-parentage. Thus, in a matri-lineal society, if my argument is well-taken, it will be patri-parentage which serves to highlight, and differentiate, the perpetual, matri-lineally defined social system. Furthermore, it will now be clear that if the idea of parentage requires to be differentiated by gender, 14</page><page sequence="13">this has as its consequence the mutual requirement of both "descent" and "exchange" as modes of actualisation of the idea of parentage. The question arises: what has all this to do with the social classification of humans into mutually exclusive gender categories, and with the asymmetry (Rosaldo 1974:17-43; Ortner 1974:67-89) in cultural valuation and social status that seems to follow for "men" relative to "women", once humans are classified in this way? Evidently, the ideas of patri-parentage and matri-parentage imply that fertility in general is culturally differentiated into masculine and feminine procreative contributions. But, we would err if we assumed that the cultural principles of patri-parentage and of the masculine procreative contribution must be enacted by persons who are classified as "men", to the exclusion of those classified as "women". Just as we would err if we required the ideas of matri-parentage and the feminine procreative contribution to be enacted by persons classified as "women". The point is made when we remind ourselves that a patriline, and a matriline, comprise both "men" (sons) and "women" (daughters). Thus, matri-parentage is enacted as significantly — if not in the same way — by mothers' brothers as by mothers, just as patri-parentage, with the same qualification, is enacted by fathers' sisters as by fathers. If, then, a "man" can represent the principle of matri-parentage, and a "woman" that of patri-parentage, we must not directly conflate the classification of persons by gender with the internal differentiation of parentage by a gender code. It is quite clear that at the level of integration of the social system as a system "men" and "women" are not needed as actors to perform the masculine and feminine principles of parentage. For at this level the structural differentiation of group FIGURE 2 MATRI-PARENTAGE AS THE PRINCIPLE OF DIFFERENTIATION OF THE WALBIRI PATRILATERAL PROCREATIVE COMMUNITY Mothers: Patrimoiety 1 Patrimoiety 2 Wives: Patrimoiety 1 Patrimoiety 2 A2 Djangala Al Djambidjimba CI Djagamara C2 Djuburula B1 Djabanangga B2 Djabangari D1 Djungarai D2 Djabaldjara -M=Nabangari -M=Nunbarai -M=Nabangga -M=Nabaldjari -M- Nambidjimba -M=Nabarula -M=Nagamara -M=Nangala (B2) (Dl) Patrimoiety (Bl) 2 (D2) (Al) (C2) Patrimoiety (CI) 1 (A2) A2 Djangala Al Djambidjimba CI Djagamara C2 Djuburula Bl Djabanangga B2 Djabangari Dl Djungarai D2 Nabaldjari -W=Nungarai -W=Nabangari -W=Nabaldjari -W=Nabanangga -W=Nabarula -W=Nambidjimba -W=Nangala -W=Nagamara (Dl) (B2) Patrimoiety (D2) 2 (Bl) (C2) (Al) Patrimoiety (A2) 1 (CI) 15</page><page sequence="14">identities in accordance with the dual principle of patri- and matri-parentage allows these groups to dramatise the respective masculine and feminine procreative contributions. Indeed, for reasons that will become clear, at this level, the persons who enact the masculine and feminine procreative contributions are "men" belonging to appropriately differentiated groups. The Walbiri banba ceremonies, as analytically presented by Munn (1973:ch. 7), exemplify this point very well. The banba ceremonies are fertility ceremonies, where it is the cosmic dimension of fertility that is involved. Accordingly, they are an example of cosmic ritual, which is operating on the macro-cosmic dimension of the social system. There is a division of labour in this cosmic ritual. On the one hand we have men of a specific patrilodge, who are the "masters" of the particular ancestral dreaming(s) with which this lodge is identified. Accordingly, it is these men who become the ancestor as he is ritually re-embodied in their ritual decoration and in their "dancing," or actualising, this ancestor's generative potency. On the other hand, as co-participants in this ritual, we have men belonging to the patrimoiety opposite to that of the masters-dancers of the ceremony. These men make the ceremonial paraphernalia, and decorate the dancers. Munn (1973:185 186) convincingly argues that, in so doing, these "workers" are bringing into being, or giving birth to, the ancestor. The workers, thus, open or prepare the way for the ancestor to re-emerge from the earth by making the materials for his phenomenal emergence or re-incarnation. It is the masters-dancers who animate these materials, and who thereby become the ancestor as he is enabled now to be existent in the phenomenal world. As Munn (1973:194) makes clear, the iconography — as expressed in body and headdress designs — involved in these ceremonies deploys symbols that bring together both feminine and masculine (pro-creative) sexuality. Thus, the men who are dancers represent the creative generative power of both sexualities as these are aspects of a pansexual, cosmic fertility. Indeed, in this regard, the masters-dancers are marked as "men", for it is men as a cultural category who represent the procreative life-force, as I shall show below. In contrast, the workers do not represent the procreative life-force, but rather the phenomenal process through which the life-force can become efficacious in the phenomenal world. It is women as a cultural category who symbolise this phenomenal process, as, again, I develop below. Accordingly, in the context of this cosmic rite, and relative to the masters-dancers, the workers are not "men" but "women".16 This is in accordance with the structural placement of the workers in relation to the masters-dancers, since, respectively, they are men of opposite patrimoieties connected by maternal-affinal links. That is, it is women, as mothers and wives {viz. mothers of future patri-laterally linked sons) who connect the workers to the masters. Thus, since in this context it is the masters-dancers who stand for the patri-lateral, cosmic life-force, the patri-lateral identity of the workers is bracketed, and their ability to represent the principle of matri-parentage in its cultural significance comes to the foreground. On the cosmic plane, then, banba ceremonies symbolically condense the central features of the Walbiri socio-cultural universe, and its ongoing re generation. The men of both patri-moieties represent the two principles of parentage: i.e. the differentiation of the patri-laterally defined, universal principle of parentage in two exogamous communities now functions to dramatise the distinction between, and mutual dependence of, patri- and matri-parentage. The issue, of course, is why it is persons classed as men who enact the idea of matri-parentage, and why it is that women, of the appropriate moiety, and in the appropriate place, are not included as participants in this cosmic dramaturgy. Stated differently, why is it that persons classed as women are not deployed to represent 16</page><page sequence="15">the feminine procreative contribution and the principle of matri-parentage? These are questions pertinent not only to the Walbiri case. It would seem to be a universal feature of gender differentiation that it is men who are the cosmic ritual specialists, and that they have a co-relative macro-cosmic authority, which legitimates their role in representing the claims of the whole socio-cultural system in relation both to other such systems, and to its internal components and members. Women, by contrast, may have a significant role to play in ritual activities which enhance the health and well-being of individuals. Their's, however, is a micro-cosmic type of ritual, and this correlates with women's status as one placed under the authority of men.18 At the level of the procreative generation of social life, men are associated with the cosmic, or macro-temporal, cycle of generation and re-generation of the whole life-world with which a particular society identifies itself. Women, on the other hand, are associated with what Munn (1973:214) calls "the micro-temporal rhythms of the daily cycle", and of the individual life-cycle. At the macro level of the social system, the idea of parentage operates to constitute the identity of the society by constituting a community of shared life substance. Also at this level, the gender differentiation of parentage into patri-and matri-parentage operates to constitute the segments of this community, and to articulate their mutual relationship and interdependence. As I have implied, if gender differentiation is concerned at this level, it is not the same as the classification of persons, or individuals, by gender. I now want to tackle this gender classification of persons. Here it is necessary to ask: (1) why does gender require to operate at the level of the social classification of individuals? (2) how, and in what way, does gender at this level conform to and elaborate the idea of parentage? (3) why are male and female individuals classed as "men" and "women" respectively as these categories are meaningfully determined as distinct aspects of the idea of parentage? and (4) what is the relationship between the different levels of operation of the gender differentiation of parentage? In what follows, I discuss these questions, through a mix of propositional argument and discursive elaboration. The first issue concerns why it is that the gender differentiation of the idea of parentage must operate at the level of the social classification of persons and not just at the level of classification of groups. Let me clarify the distinction I am making here. Gender classifies persons insofar as it enters into the constitution of their individual as distinct from their social personality: i.e. at this level, gender concerns the constitution of individual identity. It follows that the gender identity of an individual is not the individualisation of a corporate, or communal identity, as is the patri-lateral or matri-lateral location of the individual as a member of the community, or, of one of its segments. What a "man" shares with other men qua men, or a "woman" with women qua women, is not some shared life substance which makes them individual expressions of the same communal substance. In this latter case, individuals have the same identity, and are substitutable for each other. In contrast, an individual man (woman) is like other men (women) only in the degree to which a shared masculinity (femininity) colours, or determines, his (her) individuality. Gender classification of persons is a principle of individuation of social being precisely because one man (woman) is not substitutable for another insofar as it is his (her) identity as this (individual) man (woman), rather than his (her) identity as a member of a corporate group, which is at issue. This is underlined by the core relational feature of the gender classification of persons: this is its expression as a relation between an individual man and an individual woman, a situation not qualified by polygamy. To be sure, on the basis of their being classed within gender categories, men and women, respectively, can collectively dramatise the meaning of these categories as categories, and the 17</page><page sequence="16">relationship between them. However, such collective enactments of the gender classification of persons are merely the expression of the generic features of this classification, and their role is to bring out the generic features of the relationship between an individual man and an individual woman. This is why these collective enactments of the gender classification of persons do not constitute men and women as groups with a corporate identity vis-à-vis each other, but, instead, constitute them as distinctive categorical expressions of individuality. Clearly, gender is a determination of individuality. Moreover, it constrains individuality to be expressed in a generic or categorical form. In this respect, the operationalisation of gender at the level of individuality connotes a very limited principle of individuation. My point, however, is that the gender classification of persons requires individuality in the sense that it is a determinate relation of mutual recognition between individuals as individuals. Why this should be so is not difficult to explain. When a society understands itself in terms of the idea of parentage, this idea must be elaborated in such a way as to afford a mode of integration between the corporate and the individual levels of the social system. Evidently, the macro differentiation of parentage does not afford this. The gender classification of persons does. Specifically, it effects this integration between the corporate and individuated levels of the social system by locating those of one gender category as the expositors of the corporate aspect, and those of the other gender category as the expositors of the individuated aspect. It is then the relation between the two, as gender-determined individuals, which effects that integration. This requires to be a relation between individual expositors of the gender categories because only then is it possible for the individual to be secured recognition as an individual, even while their individuality is mediated by its being subsumed within a corporate moral order. For reasons I will explain later, it is "women" who are delegated the role of expressing and maintaining individuality, the individuality of themselves and of others placed under their individual care. It is "men" who, as individuals, stand for the corporate identity and good of the whole, in contrast and in relation to merely individual identity and interest.19 Men can do this only as they present themselves as individuals to women. In so doing, they secure the subordination of their own individual aspect to the corporate aspect of their identity, even as they derive, from women, some recognition for their individuality. Lacking in this corporate aspect of their personality, and standing for the idea of individuality itself, women accept their subordination to the corporate social order only as this is expressed as their subordination to the individual men with whom they are placed in relationship. Indeed, if men collectively attempt to assert their authority over women, women are likely to sceptically bracket or even question this expression of masculine authority, even while they continue to accept their subordination as individuals to the authority of the individual men to whom they relate.20 If the idea of parentage must be specified in such a way as to integrate the corporate and the individuated aspects of the social system, it is now necessary to explain how the gender classification of persons is an elaboration of the idea of parentage which conforms to this requirement of integration. Here we return to the nature of the procreative life-force, and to the conditions for its effective translation into phenomenal existence. To briefly recapitulate, the life-force is a merely noumenal principle of causality, where causality takes the form of procreative power. In order to become phenomenally efficacious, the life-force must find to hand a phenomenal vehicle through which it can operate. Its operation through such a phenomenal vehicle allows it to take on phenomenal characteristics: these are not reducible to the life 18</page><page sequence="17">force; they are the conditions of its manifestation in real, sensual existence. "Birth", then, is necessarily conceived in these terms. Moreover, the phenomenal translation of the noumenal principle is the conversion of a cosmic and eternal temporality into the particular and finite temporality of an individual unit of life, whether this unit be an individual human being, or an individual harvest. In effect, the phenomenal translation of the cosmic, noumenal principle of parentage forces it to become actualised as a particular and, thus, limited determination. Alternatively, the phenomenal translation of the life force can be regarded as the individualisation of this universal principle. Ihe logic oí operation oí cosmic parentage, then, is expressed as a distinction between its noumenal, universal, eternal quality, and the finite, mortal and particular expression of its phenomenal coming into being. This distinction perfectly accords with that between the corporate and the individuated levels of the social system; and the necessity for the integration of the corporate and individuated level accords with the mutual dependence of the noumenal procreative principle, and of the phenomenal vehicles through which it operates. It is the gender classification of persons which expresses, within society, this distinction between noumenal causality, and the phenomenal means of its operations. "Men" are those persons classed as representatives of the noumenal quality of the life-force: indeed, "men" are those who represent procreative power. "Women" are those persons classed as representatives of the phenomenal vehicle and processes through which the noumenal principle becomes manifest. In this regard, men and women are aligned with qualitatively very distinct procreative contributions. To be a woman means to be defined in terms of the phenomenal conditions of realisation of the procreative life-force. It is the provision of these conditions which is her distinctive procreative contribution. This distinctively feminine contribution is not the same thing as the female aspect of cosmic, pansexual procreative vitality. The procreative life-force, always, has male and female aspects, precisely because this pansexuality distinguishes it as the undifferentiated, pre-actualised whole. Thus, we can have, e.g., the procreative life-force conceived in terms of "Mother Earth", without this in any wise contradicting or qualifying the gender classification of persons in terms of qualitatively distinct procreative contributions.21 This point bears some emphasis, and it is in its elaboration that the similarity, as well as the distinction, between the macro differentiation of parentage in gender terms and the gender classification of persons can emerge. In a matrilineal society, the pansexual life-force, or the cosmic principle of parentage, are matrilineally defined. Yet this occurs without causing an inversion in the normal gender classification of persons. It is still men who are culturally identified with the life force, and women who are identified with the phenomenal means of its realisation. The matri-lineal cast of the life-force is expressed in it being mothers' brothers — rather than fathers — who are the cosmic ritual specialists. In the matrilineal society, too, there is the same requirement that, at the macro level, and for purposes of the internal segmentation of the social system, the idea of parentage be differentiated into matri- and patri- parentage. What occurs here is an inversion of how these principles are expressed in the Walbiri patrilineal case. It is patri parentage which functions to internally differentiate the community of matri parentage. And, at this macro-cosmic level, it is the principle of matri-parentage which is identified with the ritual deployment of the procreative life-force, and is, accordingly, the exponent of the pansexual or androgynous character of the life force. The principle of patri-parentage, in this context, is symbolically aligned with 19</page><page sequence="18">the feminine procreative contribution. This notwithstanding, the usual order of the gender classification of persons continues to operate.22 Now, I want to elaborate, more discursively this time, the points I have made about how the gender classification of persons entails the contribution of men and women as making qualitatively distinctive procreative contributions. Let us take the Walbiri case once more. Walbiri conception beliefs conform to this association of men with the noumenal, and of women with the phenomenal, aspects of the life force. Guruwari emerge from the land in which the ancestors left their procreative power, and they enliven, or animate, phenomenal materials within a women's womb. It is the naming of this occurrence, and the identification of which ancestral guruwari is responsible, which is the point at which the woman's pregnancy is constituted as real in ritual, or social, terms. It is quite pointless to dispute whether these or other "natives" (see e.g. Monberg 1975) "understand" the "biological facts" of human procreation as moderns construe them. At least, this is a pointless exercise if we grant the constitutive role of culture with regard to what is "real" for any particular society.23 For the Walbiri, at least at the level of macro-cosmic ritual concern, it is the noumenal principle, rather than its phenomenal mode of operation, which is of most significance. Indeed, with regard to the phenomenal mode of operation of the life-force, the Walbiri seem to have quite a reasonable notion of the facts of life, certainly as reasonable as any found in modern, western "folk" ideas of conception and of how it operates. Meggitt ( 1962:273) remarks, in a manner fully in accordance with my argument, that among the Walbiri: In ritual contexts, men speak of the action of the guruwari as the significant factor; in secular contexts, they nominate both the guruwari and sexual intercourse. The women, having few ritual attitudes, generally emphasise copulation.24 The equation of "men" with the noumenal aspect of parentage, and of "women" with the phenomenal mode of translation of the life-force, can be illustrated by countless examples. One such is provided in Gillison's (1980:143-174) account of the Gimi people of the Eastern Highlands of Papua New Guinea. For the Gimi, the procreative life-force is identified with — as Gillison interprets it — an idea of the "wild": The idea of "the wild" is central in Gimi thought. It refers to pure forms of plant and animal life which occur "spontaneously" in the rainforest but which originate from an immortal human essence. The fantastic variation and abundance of the Gimi wilderness demonstrate the in finite creativity of this transmogrified male spirit. Both the uncultivated and the after-life are designated by the word kore ... "ghost" or "ancestor" is kore bana (literally, "wild man"). After death, men's spirits collectively constitute a forest reservoirfrom which emerges the animating life-force of new generations (Gillison 1980:144). This idea of the wild is the basis of the distinctive identity of men in Gimi culture: Things in the wild exist in their original, eternal and in that sense perfect form. The stated aim of men's initiation rites is to achieve the 'ideal type' in nature. By decorating their bodies elaborately with feathers, the boys 'become' birds: their purpose is to be changed by sharing an avian existence rather than to change the birds by bringing them under human control. In the songs and rites of male initiation, the stages of men's existence are symbolically identified with elements of the natural universe (korena): the fruit of trees (adult men) is food plucked by birds (initiates or spirits of the recently dead). Trees grow out of mountains (the no-longer-individuated 20</page><page sequence="19">ancestral mass) from which issue rivers (the flowing and prolific ancestral fluid, kore abe, literally "male spirit urine", a euphemism for semen).The rivers' headquarters are abundant sources of birds and flowers, symbols of the 'initiates' gorgeous emergent manhood. Trees (men in their prime) form the productive core of this system: the fruit at their "heads" feeds the bird-initiates and the rich decay of falling detritus nourishes the ancestral mass beneath them (Gillison 1980:146-147). The identification of women with the phenomenal vehicles through which the life-force operates is very clear in the Gimi case. The initiated man's semen is conceived as the expression of the ancestral life-force and the Gimi "Theory of procreation ... gives all the credit to semen and treats women as sterile vessels (Gillison 1980:162)". Gillison (1980:163) elaborates: We have seen how the bride-initiate is made publicly to eat wild foods which represent her husband's ancestral semen and his spirit-child. By implication she will serve merely to incubate a foetus whose body is derived from his father's semen and whose animating life-force is derived from the kore. Even a female child is symbolically male in the sense that it is wholly derived from the father or his ancestors. If the Gimi so forcefully exclude women from the noumenal aspect of parentage, they stress women's role in the phenomenal aspect of parentage. It is women's nurturing of the child, as of other individual expressions of life, which is responsible for the phenomenal integrity and growth of these individual existences: Both sexes say that women's intense and prolonged physical and emotional attachment to infants, pigs and crops has uniquely nurturant properties. Women breast feed shoats as well as babies and they often sleep embracing both their young.The vigour and fruition of all nurtured life is believed to depend upon exclusive attachment to, or symbolic incorporation by, individual female caretakers ... Their [the "magically nurtuant songs"] imagery suggests that the reciter's tie to her nonhuman dependants is modelled upon the bond of motherhood, especially as it exists in utero ... In order to take root and prosper, new life must achieve a state of unison with the female (Gillison 1980:147-148). The basic proposition here is that, as regards the constitution of gender at the level of individual persons, "men" stand for the cosmic life-force, and "women" stand for the phenomenal conditions of its operation. Before I elaborate on this further, two points are worth making. First, it will be clear from the examples cited, that precisely how the life-force and the phenomenal conditions for its actualisation are conceived will vary in accordance with each specific culture's version of the procreative model of social life. This variation bears further enquiry, and the aim of such enquiry should be to establish a properly comparative understanding of this procreative model. However, this is a task for future work. Secondly, it is important to remark on the consistency in the cultural identification of males with the noumenal principle, and of females with the phenomenal conditions of its realisation. It is difficult here to avoid some reference to biological sex difference as placing some constraint on which sex is assigned to which gender category as the latter is constituted in terms of the requirements of the procreative model. It is women's biological role in pregnancy, parturition, and lactation which, undoubtedly, suggests her association with the phenomenal vehicles of the life-force rather than with the life-force itself.25 To make this point is simply to remind us that, in imbuing natural limits with meaning, a symbolic order does not dispense with them. However, it is equally clear that biological sex difference in 21</page><page sequence="20">no wise accounts for the way in which the procreative model invests it with meaning. It is the requirements of the idea of parentage which constrains sex difference to be inserted within a dual order of meaning. There is certainly nothing in the characteristics of sex difference as such which suggests or gives rise to a dual order of noumenal and phenomenal being. In the biological aspect of sex difference as it bears on human procreation, all we find is an organic symbiosis between male and female reproductive biologies, with nothing privileging this relationship to become a causal relation between two distinct ontological principles wherein the idea of "cause" is the idea of a self creating origin. Sex difference, then, is presupposed by the procreative model and, accordingly, limits it; but, sex difference in no wise accounts for the dual order of meaning through which males and females become, respectively, men and women.26 The Gimi example underlines the way in which women are associated with all the phenomenal aspects of the way in which the life-force animates a new unit of life. Thus, women are not only the phenomenal vehicles through which the life force operates to animate new units of life. They are also identified with the phenomenal processes of growth of these new units of life, as these processes concern the transition from the birth to the maturation of these units. It is this which accounts for the distinctive association of women with the nurturance of infants and young children, that is with the securing of the phenomenal integrity of new units of life which are not themselves able to care for their phenomenal being. Munn's (1973:34-35) discussion of Walbiri women's ritual designs {yawalyu) offers instructive illustration of this point. Yawalyu designs are painted on the breasts of young girls: Munn (1973:43) comments that this "is part of the general procedure of painting girls occasionally from childhood through puberty in order to 'grow them up'." Munn also comments (1973:44) that: Small boys may also be painted with yawalyu, for the casual painting of small children is part of the role played by women in caring for them and nourishing them with their milk to make them strong. The same expression, wiri-ma-ni (makes big or makes strong) is used to refer to the effects of both activities — that of painting a child and nourishing him ... Similarly, when women paint themselves as part of the [boys' initiation] circumcision ceremonies, this painting is regarded as part of their role in maintaining the novice's life and strength, helping, therefore, in the process of "growing him up". In effect, women are associated with all aspects of the individual's life-cycle, where what is at issue is the coming into being, maturation, and death, of the individual phenomenal husk of the life-force. This is actually, however, to associate woman with individuality itself. For, even while individuality as an expression of life derives from the life-force, as is evidenced in the conception guruwari of the Walbiri as individuals, this individuality exists only as the life-force is made manifest in individual phenomenal forms. Indeed, the phenomenal manifestation of the life-force in new units of life is its translation into another domain of being, where what is eternal and undetermined becomes mortal, and determinate as a specific individual expression of life. A further illustration makes this point graphically. I take the case of the Bimi Kuskusmin, a West Sepik people of Papua New Guinea, as it is presented by Porter Poole (1981:1 16-166). This is a patrilineal society, and so it is men's procreative contribution as fathers which creates the aspects of personhood (Porter Poole 1981:131-132): "Semen contains and transmits the dual spirit entity kusem — manifested as finiik and khaapkhabuurien" (Porter Poole 1981:131). Porter Poole (1981:132) says "The finiik represents the social dimensions of personhood": "It 22</page><page sequence="21">stores collective knowledge and experience and becomes the conscience and the valued intellect of the person". The khaapkhabuurien aspect of personhood, by contrast, concerns the individual dimension of personality: "In general, it represents the unpredictable and rather idiosyncratic aspects of personality that differentiate individuals from one another", and thereby "it contrasts with the moral and jural aspects of personhood that are associated with the finiik The khaapkhabuurien aspect of personhood emanates from the life-force, as this is mediated through the masculine procreative contribution to the coming into being of individuals. However, the way in which it asserts itself depends on individual experience in the phenomenal world, especially as this experience is developed early in association with the individual's mothering by women: As the image of the idiosyncratic individual, the khaapkhabuurien is associated with the disordered, compulsive, wild aspect of personality. It bears the imprint of personal experience and is the locus of individual peculiarity and resentment as a consequence. The early experiences of all children in the female domain are instrumental in its formation; for, although it is sometimes said to be a male procreative contribution in substance, it is initially tabula rasa in character (Porter Poole 1981:132). The finiik, then, represents the corporate aspect of personhood, the khaapkhabuurien the individuated aspect of personhood. Women's special association with the latter aspect is expressed in the Bimi-Kuskusmin belief that, in women, the khaapkhabuurien aspect of their personalities is strong, and, relative to men, less securely placed under the domination of the finiik aspect of their personalities. In the personalities of men, the balance between the two aspects is the reverse: Thus, in men ... the finiik dominates the khaapkhabuurien as a consequence of their possession of semen (through procreation and ritual taro) and their endurance of initiation. In women, however, the finiik is weakened and the khaapkhabuurien is strengthened by pernicious female influences, notably menstrual blood (Porter Poole 1981:132-133). Women's association with the phenomenal being of individuals is, then, their distinctive association with individuality. This means their special association with the individual life-cycle, since it is this phenomenal cycle which is the mark of individual existence, as this is demonstrated by the birth, maturation, and death of the individual. Accordingly, women have a special association with birth and infancy, as they do with the decay of the phenomenal husk of the individual in death. Moreover, women must be involved in an aspect of the initiation rites of men, whereby the boy's individual aspect of his personality is relocated within, and dominated by, a newly matured corporate aspect of his personality. In such rites, the presence of women symbolise the former aspect of the boy's identity, even while their loss of the boy to the masculine domain of macro-cosmic concerns, and their ritual exclusion from the macro-cosmic aspect of the initiation rite, marks the limitation arising from their association with individuality. Women are individual persons just as men are; like any individual they come into being through the action of the life-force. Thus, among the Walbiri, women have conception guruwari just as men do. Women's shared status with men as persons concerns, as we have seen, the individuated, not the corporate, aspect of personhood. The consequence of this is a distinctive association of women with threats to corporate order, in all its aspects: moral, cognitive, and structural. Women are placed as men's dependents with regard to the corporate order and identity of the society to which they belong. And, in order to secure the corporate order against the threat both of disorderly individuality and of transience that 23</page><page sequence="22">women represent, men are placed in a position of domination with regard to women, and to "womanly" persons, i.e. uninitiated boys and girls. Gender concerns dimensions of personhood, where personhood connotes both individual identity as a member of society, and the capacities of the individual as a social actor. An individual's father or mother locates him or her in terms of the patri-lateral or matri-lateral principle of association at the level of the social system as a whole; and both parents locate the individual within the patri-lateral and matri lateral principles of segmentary association. These locations of the individual, however, are derived: they do not belong to him (her) in his (her) own right in contrast to his (her) status as a person; and to be a social actor, the individual must have his (her) own location within the sphere of social action. Thus, for an individual to become a man, he must assume a corporate aspect of his own personality. It is not enough for this corporate orientation of his identity to be held in trust for him by those who represent the idea of parentage on the cosmic plane, i.e. by his male, socially adult kin. Instead, to become a man, the individual must acquire, as an aspect of his own personality or capacities as a social actor, this corporate orientation. Until he acquires this new aspect of his personality, a young male is like a woman, a status that is underlined by his dependence, as an immature unit of life, on women for his phenomenal integrity. To become a man, an individual has to be ritually killed, and to be born anew. Here we see the procreative idiom governing the way in which acquisition of a new identity as a masculine individual actor is understood. The ritual rebirth of the boy signifies his accession to participation, as an actor in his own right, in the corporate community of noumenal parentage. He is now enabled to become a noumenal parent, and thereby to represent, indeed, ritually embody, the ancestral life-force in its corporate aspect. The acquisition of masculinity through ritual rebirth is usually referred to as an initiation rite. This ritual rebirth of the boy as a man is quite different from his original birth as an individual person. The ritual quality of the former is dramatised by the way in which the boy has to actively participate in his rebirth, in his being systematically educated in all aspects of cosmic ritual. Moreover, the rebirth of individuals as men radically changes the character of their relationship to, and dependency on, women. In relative terms, the corporate aspects of the initiated man's personality brackets their individual aspect, while for women, the inverse holds true. Now, these men regard women as the phenomenal vehicles through which they assert ancestral potency, and their dependency on women is the dependency of the noumenal principle on phenomenal vehicles for its actualisation. It is this relation — including as it does women's dependency status with regard to men as exponents of the corporate order — which determines the gender classification of persons as a division of labour, and as a principle of exchange.27 Concluding this section, we may say that men: women: the noumenal: the phenomenal, or, men: women: the corporate: the individual. It is quite clear that the ontological thrust of these terms is one which only examination of the procreative model of social life can illuminate. In other words, the gender classification of persons derives from the procreative model of social life: it certainly in no sense precedes it, as "essentialist" attempts to derive masculinity from maleness and femininity from femaleness would have it. Indeed, from the manner in which the gender classification of persons operates, we can see how little manhood has to do with maleness, especially insofar as man's identification with the noumenal principle of parentage means his identification with a pansexual, androgynous principle. Similarly, womanhood has more to do with "individuality", and with the individual meaning of a human life-cycle, than it has to do with even the reproductive identity of her as a female. 24</page><page sequence="23">IV In this brief concluding section of my paper, I will not attempt to recapitulate my argument, but, simply, make some final comments. My general intention here has been to show that the bases of gender lie within a particular type of social ontology, which I have termed the procreative model of social life. In this, I have emphasised the point that gender is integrally tied up with kinship. They are aspects of the same idea: the idea of parentage. With regard to the idea of parentage, I distinguished the gender coding of macro principles of parentage from the gender classification of persons. It could be that we may wish to reserve the term "kinship" for the former, and the term "gender" for the latter. I have emphasised, however, the inseparability of kinship and gender as far as their shared context of meaning goes. In this, I am attempting to preclude the perception of gender and kinship as distinct and separate principles of social structure, a perception which arises when the macro principles of parentage and the gender classification of persons are not discerned as different levels of operationalisation of the same idea. In my explication of what I have called the procreative model of social life, accordingly, I have attempted to show what kinship is all about, if by kinship we mean the idea of parentage in all its levels of operationalisation. To take the investigation of this idea further, two lines of social research are called for. First, it is quite clear, that if kinship requires to be understood in terms of the type of social ontology I have termed the procreative model, then we can no longer treat comparative religion, the study of myth, and kinship studies as separate domains of inquiry. And, if, for the substantive aspect of kinship to be grasped, kinship studies require to be situated in reference to comparative religion and myth, such cross-reference may reveal the secret of the mythico-religious construction of reality to be kinship, or, more accurately, the idea of parentage. Secondly, it is the case that current ethnographically based analyses of gender which stress a culturalist approach to gender (e.g. Porter Poole 1981; and Gillison 1980) are laying bare aspects of this procreative model, and, in so doing, are affording very richly suggestive glimpses as to the substance of kinship. The difficulty with such studies, given the mutual determination of both kinship and gender as facets of the procreative model, is their one-sided emphasis on gender. Certainly, owing to the past entrapment of social science itself within a rationalised version of the procreative model, the recent task has been to assert the salience of gender, and of, specifically, women in the workings of most societies. It seems to me that, now, this task may be regarded as one completed, and there is very little legitimate basis for studies continuing to abstract gender from its context within the procreative model of social life. NOTES 1. "For a society is not made up merely of the mass of individuals who compose it, the ground which they occupy, the things which they use and the movements which they perform, but above all is the idea which it forms of itself' (Dürkheim 1915:470). 2. Rosaldo's theoretical perspective on gender centrally informs Chodorow's important and influential The Reproduction of Mothering (Chodorow 1978). There is some dispute concerning the general applicability of Rosaldo's model, with La Fontaine (1981:346), for example, arguing that: "The division into domestic and public which is made in some, but not all societies, is not a description of structural cleavages but a symbolic statement whose meaning we must interpret in each instance where we find it." However, it is perhaps Ortner's model which has generated the more substantial critique to date, where a number of authors have proposed the nature-culture duality to be a distinctively "modern" 25</page><page sequence="24">or "western" way of seeing, and to be inapplicable to many tribally-based cultures. See the collection edited by MacCormack and Strathern (1980), especially the contributions by Gillison (1980) and Strathern (1980); and see also Brown and Jordanovna (1981) and Brown (1981). 3. For some discussion of the debate between "biological" and "sociological" theories of kinship, see the very contrasting positions offered by Schneider ( 1972) and Scheffler ( ! 978). And for some discussion of "descent" and "alliance" theories, see Schneider (1965), and Weiner (1982). 4. My conception of "the will" is derived both from Hegel (1952), and from my reflections on the central presuppositions of Marx's social ontology. For an excellent account of the latter, see Gould (1978). 5. I am indebted, for this point, to Evans-Pritchard's (1956:ch,3) account of totemism in reference to Nuer religion. Evans-Pritchard says ( 1956:78), "though totemic spirits are classed as kuthpiny, spirits of the below or of the earth, people sometimes went out of their way to explain ... that it is not the species themselves, the material things one can see, that they pray and sacrifice to, but the spirits associated with them, and to emphasise further the difference between the species and the spirits they added that while the species are creatures on the earth the spirits are with God in the sky". Further on he remarks ( 1956:79): "It is clear also in stories of how the ancestor of a lineage was aided by the totem that Nuer are thinking not so much of the animal as such aiding him as of Spirit making itself known to the ancestor in the creature and helping him through it. Nuer further distinguish between totem animal and totemic spirit when the animal harms a man who respects it and he retaliates by harming the animal. It is not the spirit he complains against but the animal, which is here regarded as separate from the spirit and incurring liability simply as a creature. On the other hand, when a totemic spirit seizes one of those to whom it stands in a spiritual relationship and causes him sickness, the sickness is attributed to the spirit and not to the totemic species, a member of which obviously has not seized him." 6. Thus, ch. I, verses 27 and 28 of "Genesis" read: "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female he them. "And God blessed them, and god said unto them. Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth." 7. Munn's (1973:ch. 5) chapter on "Guruwari Designs, Sons and Country" is especially illuminating with regard to the way in which the ancestral heroes become concretely manifest in the visible signs left in their tracks across the country. Munn (1973:131-132) remarks: "The most general premise behind the Walbiri conception of ancestral times is that all ancestors traveled routes which can be located in the country. The major topographical features are viewed as having been created through ancestral events, and may be thought of as metamorphoses of parts of an ancestor's body, or as due to his bodily imprints in the country. As a result, an ancestor can be 'followed', ... literally kept track of, through his site associations. Each ancestral journey begins with an emergence from the ground and is finalized in a return to the ground, whether at the site of emergence or at some place far distant from it. Ancestors are thought to remain today inside the ground." 8. M unn ( 1973: especially ch's 5, 6 and 8) convincingly argues for the centrality of circle-line motifs in Walbiri iconography, and I am aware that I have theoretically processed much that lies latent within her analysis. 9. Here I am assuming that, in this respect, they conform to what Eliade (1969:84) says of their equivalents among the Aranda: "Life existed fully below the surface of the earth, in the form of thousands of slumbering supernatural beings. They also were uncreated (as a matter of fact they are called 'born out of their own eternity', ahijirana nambakala). Finally they awoke from their sleep and broke through the surface of the earth. Their birthplaces are impregnated with their life and power." 10 For the general features of my understanding of ritual, I am greatly indebted to A.M. Hocart's (1936:41-60) account. 11. Munn's (1973:28-29) point is important here: "The term guruwari has two basic linked denotations. On the one hand, it is the name for graphic designs representing the ancestors ... and may be extended more generally to any visual sign or visual embodiment of ancestors such as footprints, topographical features resulting from their imprints or metamorphoses, ceremonial paraphernalia, or design-marked sacred boards and stones left by them in the ground. On the other hand, the term refers to ancestral fertility power, the power of generation, which is an essentially abstract or invisible potency left by the ancestors in the soil as they traveled through the country. Guruwari are both the essential visible forms and the essential invisible potency of the ancestors." 12. Munn (1973:190) mentions the significance of the "'masking' quality of the body decorations typical of banba ceremonies, where the dancer's face and torso are generally covered with decorations. In this way his personal identity — his physical body — is overlaid by Guruwari, by forms epitomizing his ancestral, social identity." 13. Ina number of places (e.g. 1960:162-163), Eliade makes the point that "to the 'primitive' mind all regeneration implies a return to the origins, a repetition of the cosmogony". Thus, among the Navajo (ibid. : 163), "T o restore the health of a patient they reenact, in his presence, the coming into being of the 26</page><page sequence="25">world; they re-actualise the emergence of the first human beings from the bosom of the Earth. It is because this anthropogeny is rendered present and active (preceded, moreover, by a recitation of the cosmogony), that the patient recovers: he feels in his intimate being the primordial process of emergence," 14. "A man exercises his patrispirit for his sisters' and daughters' spiritual, as well as economic, welfare. Thus, such women are thought to 'have that patrispirit'. One consequence of this belief is the allocation to the elder sister, father's sister, anf f.f. sr. of a novice definite and significant duties in the public ceremonies that precede his circumcision and initiation into the lodge, whose spirit the women already, in a sense, possess" (Meggitt 1962:210). 15. "In ordinary discussion and in everyday behaviour, little distinction is made between the members of a man's matriline and all his maternal kin who are also countrymen; but, when the matriline functions on significant occasions, it is singled out as a separate group, whose collateral limits tend to be set at the range of the matrilateral parallel cousins of the central figure ... "In particular situations ... the matriline tends to be defined as the group that includes the mother's mother, mother's mother's children, m.m.d. children, m.m.d.d. children and the m.m.d.d.d. children." (Meggitt 1962:194). 16. Here I am taking Munn's analysis further than she actually goes; however, see the suggestions of her note (Munn 1973:188), which discusses how the "ceremonial production process communicates between the moieties symbols of sexuality and procreation." She (1973:208) remarks: "On the basis of the characteristics of banba ceremonies described here, it is possible to suggest that the banba production of ancestral forms constitutes a process whereby sexual-procreative resources are transferred from one patrimoiety to the other, and from maternally-affinally linked males into a patrilineal descent group, a process that makes possible trans-generational cosmic continuity. What the workers make is the guruwari of the ancestor, that is, his procreative potency as well as his visual identity marks. Through their performance, the masters realise the generative potential of the ancestral forms, it is as if they change ancestors into descendants, and so maintain the continuity of species and persons." 17. "The [Walbiri] feminine role ... is focussed on the personal, biological, and family plane of life maintenance. The part women play in ritual (including their role in men's initiation rites) and the major functions of their own ancestral designs tend to be confined to such matters as female sexuality, personal health, and the growth of children. While men also perform rituals, notably ilbindji, with a parallel focus on masculine sexuality, these form only a part of their wider ritual interests" (Munn 1973:213, emphasis added). See, for more developed discussion, Munn 1973:34-49. 18. Here it will be noted that I am adapting the terms of Rosaldo's( 1974:17-43) analysis, and that I am avoiding the culture-bound quality of her terms "public" and "domestic". 19. Strathern (1981:166-192) offers an ethnographic analysis which is very instructive here. She comments (p. 175), in reference to the Hageners who provide her case, that: "Unaligned self-interest is portrayed as typically female". And, Strathern makes the important point that what is at issue are "gender constructs": accordingly, a man judged to be too intent on his "personal" concerns, relative to the interests of his group, will be considered as acting like a woman. Strathern generalises this point (p. 178): "An individual Hägen woman is not entirely identified with the stereotypes of her sex. In using gender to structure other values, then, Hageners detach qualities of maleness and femaleness from actual men and women. A person of either sex can behave in a male or female way." Thus, we can have "manly" women, and "womanly" men: here, precisely, individuality determines gender identity just as it is determined by it. 20. The dramatic plot of Lysistrata is a good case in point. 21. Eliade (1960:165) remarks that "human beings were born from the Earth is a belief of universal distribution". How this birth operates shows it to be women who are identified with the phenomenal translation of this life-force: — "According to innumerable beliefs, women became pregnant whenever they approached certain places; rocks, caves, trees or rivers. The souls of the children then entered their bodies and the women conceived. Whatever was the condition of these child-souls — whether they were or were not the souls of ancestors — one thing was certain: in order to become incarnate they had been waiting somewhere, in crevasses or hollows, in pools or woods. Already then, they were leading some sort of embryonic life in the womb of their real Mother, the Earth. That was where children came from. And thence it was, according to other beliefs still surviving among Europeans of the nineteenth century, that they were bough by certain acquatic animals — fish or frogs, and especially by storks" (Eliade 1960:166). Eliade (1960:176-177) reminds us that "Mother Earth" is an androgynous source of life. 22. Weiner's (1978:182) account of the matrilineal Trobriander procreative beliefs, at first sight, may seem to challenge the universality of my model, and to indicate that it has a patrilineal bias. However, more closely examined, what Weiner says accords with my argument. Trobriand women contribute the matriline's blood — a phenomenal substance? — to the substance of a child, while the remainder of the "inner substance" of the child is "a spirit-child which symbolizes the reincarnation of a baloma (ancestral) spirit": — "In this perspective, the inner substance of a child is dala blood (sibububula, the formation of the foetus by blood and baloma), conceived through the union of a woman and a spirit child which symbolizes the reincarnation of a baloma (ancestral)spirit". What we need to know is whether mothers' brothers (viz. men of the matriline) have some privileged, cosmic ritual association 27</page><page sequence="26">with baloma spirits, in contrast to their sisters. If they do, my model holds in this case. It also stands to reason in a matrilineal case that fathers, and the differentiated principle of patri-parentage, may be symbolically aligned with that element of the feminine procreative contribution which comprises the nurture of the phenomenal identity of the child: "the growth of a child (i.e. its external form) is shaped by a man from another dala [matrilinej'. And, it is instructive that "At death ... [it is] women ... [who] 'untie' the deceased from all its connections with the living: thereby at death, once again, symbolically reproducing pure dala." This accords with women's generic association with release from the mortal, or phenomenal, coil, a point I elaborate upon below. Again, we need to know whether it is mothers, or their brothers, who are ritually responsible for maintaining the noumenal pool of baloma, and for the return of an individual's baloma, on their death, to this pool. 23. This is the point that Montague ( 1974) is attempting to make. His critics, such as Scheffler ( 1978:5 13), overlook the fact that Montague's stress is on the social ontological aspect of "procreative beliefs", and that, in any case, he does not allege simple ignorance on the part of Australian tribes with regard to the biological aspect of procreation. Scheffler's disingenuousness in this regard is on behalf of his own agenda, viz. a case that aboriginal kinship can be reduced to being an elaboration upon its allegedly basic core structure, the nuclear family, which he conceives as a set of "genealogical" (i.e. biological) relationships. Necessarily, such an agenda brackets any enquiry into the social ontology expressed in "kinship." 24. Meggitt (1962:272-273) elaborates: "All the older men with whom I discussed the matter held that copulation and the entry of a guruwari into the woman are both necessary preliminaries to childbirth; but in general they thought the action of the guruwari to be more important, because it animates the foetus and helps to determine its future character or personality." "The women, on the other hand, were emphatic that coitus is the significant antecedent of parturition; the entry of the guruwari is a secondary event that identifies the child formed of the menstrual blood." Note that both men and women agree as to the role of the guruwari in giving identity to the foetus. 25. As Sahlins ( 1977:65-66) remarks: "... a law of nature stands to a fact of culture only as a limit does to a form, a constant to a difference, and a matrix to a practice. It will never be possible to explain the cultural properties of any such fact by referring it to underlying contents of a different order". 26. J.A. Barnes (1973:59-61) argues that "physical maternity" is empirically self-evident in a way that physical paternity is not. In so doing, he appears to be making the same point as myself. However, this is not the case. Barnes derives the meaning of women's procreative contribution ("physical maternity") from the empirically evident biological facts concerning women's role in pregnancy, birth and lactation. He ( 1973:68) is thereby constrained to argue that "Fathers are not self-evident as mothers are", a point that may sit well with our contemporary, western matri-focal domesticity, but which does not make any sense with reference to societies ruled by the procreative model. Accordingly, Barnes argues the proposition "Genetrix: Genitor: Nature: Culture". This is to explain "women" by an empiricist logic, and "men" by a culturalist logic, the upshot of which is to create a radical incoherence in any sociological theory of gender. My point, of course, is the same point Sahlins makes: a biological fact, however evident it is to the human sense, cannot determine meaning; it can only constrain its application. 27. This exchange, frequently, appears to be symbolically expressed in an exchange of meat (masculine — the noumenal principle) for vegetable foods (feminine — the phenomenal principle). This is true for the Walbiri as for other societies (see e.g. James F. Weiner 1982). And, in many societies, the "bride price" comprises cattle, or "meat", in exchange for the distinctively feminine procreative contribution the wife represents in her own person.
