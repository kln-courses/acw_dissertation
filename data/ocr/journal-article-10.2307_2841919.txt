<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES on FETICHISM. By HODDER M. WESTROPP, Esq.* I HAVE been induced to lay before the Society a few desultory remarks which have been suggested to me in reading Professor Max Muller's Essay on Fetichism, which forms part of his history of the development of religion. I myself wrote some time ago a paper on the cycle of develop- ment of religion. In this I endeavoured to trace the different stages of religion from its lowest phase up to the highest culminating point in the idea of a sole supreme deity; but I went further: I traced the decliiie and decay of religion, for it is my belief that all things that have growth and progress have a cycle of development, that is, pass through the stages of rise, progress, maturity, decline and decay. Of this we have ample proof in the religions of Egypt, Assyria, Persia, Greece, Rome; they have had their rise, progTess, maturity, decline, decay and utter extinction, and it appears evident that there is marked decline in the religions of the present day. In " Chips," vol. i, p. 23, Professor Max Muller also notices the inevitable decay to which every religion is exposed. With regard to the development of religion, my view is this At the base of the scale of the development of religion there is a stage of practical atheism, an ignorance of God, of whicl there are several proofs amiong, very low and degraded races. As Captain Burton remarks, " Atheismn is the natural condition of the savage and uninstructed mind." The first step upwards is fetichism, as Mr. Tylor defines it, a belief that a spirit is considered as embodied in certain material objects, as a stoclk or stone, and that such objects are treated as having consciousness and power, and are to be worshipped, prayed to, and sacrificed to. This is undoubtedly a phase of mind peculiar to a very low state of culture, whether negro or Portuguese, and consequently is found among all peoples in that low stage, whether in ancieiit times, or among the nearos, or among the ignorant and uneducated of the * Read May 27th, 1879.</page><page sequence="2">H.

The Portuguese "worshipping dauby irmages, handling rosaries," as Professor Max Muller describes them, with whom consequently the idea of a God was in abeyance, were as mauch Fetichists as the poor negro. If we take the development of the individual man as an analogy to that of the human race, there must have been a time when the savage man had no belief in spiritual beings, as there is every certainty that a child of one or two years old, whose fallow mind may be considered a representative type of the savage mind in its earliest phase, has no idea of a spiritual being; there must have been a period when the mind of the savage man was in a blank and fallow phase, as we see in the child. Fetichism thus corresponds to that early stage in child- hood when it attributes personality, its own life and conscious- ness to all material objects which it comes in contact with, a phenomenon often seen in children. The next stage in the development of religion was nature- worship, or the adoration of the sun, moon, the elements, etc., then was evolved the personification of these, which led to idolatry, anthropomorphism, and polytheism; the development of religion passing through other phases in the ascending scale reached its highest stage in the final elaboration of the human mind, the idea of one absolute and supreme Godhead. There is one phase of religion in the later stage of its cycle of development which I would wish to reinark: a return to the lower beliefs of early ages, that is to fetichism. As man il the later stage of his cycle of development returns to second child- hood, so religious belief returns to its primitive phase. Hence the reason we see the evidence of fetichism, in the later stages of religious development, and in the modern corruptions of the Hindoo religion, as remarked by Professor Max Miiller, and, as he mig,ht add, in the Roman Catholic. For the doctrine of the real presence is in reality pure fetichism, as Mr. Baring-Gould defines it, "the concentration of spirit or deity in one point." The doctrine that a spirit is " embodied in, or attached to, or conveying influence through certain material objects," and hence the worship of stocks and stones. (" Primitive Culture," vol. ii, p. 144.) Hume has, too, observed this phase. "It is remarkable," he writes, " that the principles of religion have a kind of flux and reflux in the human mind, and that men have a natural tendency to rise from idolatry to theism; and to sink again from theism to idolatry. The feeble apprehensions cannot be satisfied with conceiving their deity as a pure spirit and perfect intelligence, and yet their natural terrors keep them from imputing to him the least shadow of limitation and imperfection. They fluctuate</page><page sequence="3">306 H. M. WESTROPP.-NOteS on Fetichism,. between these opposite sentiinents. The same infirmity still drags them downwards, fromii an omnipotent and spiritual deity to a limited and corporeal one, and from a corporeal and limited deity to a statue or visible representation." Mr. Tylor makes a similar remark: " The hiistory of religion displays but too plainly the proneness of mankind to relapse, in spite of reformation, into the lower and darker condition of the past." Professor Max Muller observes that there are no traces of feti- chism in the earliest hymns of the Vedas. These appear to me to have been written soon after the phase of nature-worship had pre- vailed, for as the Professor writes (" Chips," vol. i, p. 238): " In the Veda, the names of the so-called Gods or Devas betray their original physical character and meaning without disguise. The fire was praised and invoked by the name of Agni; the earth by the name of Prithri; the sky by the name of Dya. The suln was invoked by many names, such as Surya, Savitri, Vishnu, or Mitra. The moon was alluded to under the appellation of Soma." The Hindoos had, it is evident, then grown out of, and forgotten the phase of fetichism. It appears that at the time the Veda was written the phase of personification of tlle elements and powers of nature was beginning to be developed. There is a passage in Professor Monier Williams' " Progress of Indian Relioious Thought," which shows that fetichism, which appears to be an invariable first step in the development of reli- gions in all countries, was developed in India in the Veda age. The following are his words: " It is certainly probable that fetish superstitions of the lowest type prevailed in India at the time when the Veda hymns were composed. Evidence of the exist- ence of such superstitions is deducible from the Veda itself. In the Atharva-Veda divine powers are sometimes attributed to the ladle, and other wooden implements of sacrifice. Examples of this primitive form of religion are traceable in the super- stitious observances of the Hindoos, from the earliest period up to the present day." In an article on India in " Chambers' Cyclopmedia," I found the following passage: "The iindoos as depicted in their hymns (the Rig Veda) are far removed from the starting-point of human society, nay, they may fairly claim to be ranked among those already civilised communities experienced in arts, defend- ing their homes and property in organised warfare, acquainted even with many vices which only occur in an advanced condi- tion of artificial life." From this picture of Hindoo life in age of the Rig Veda, there would be consequently very liLtle reason to expect to discover traces oi fetichism in the Rig Veda. But if everything has a Ibeginning, a first step in its progress towards</page><page sequence="4">H. M. WESTROPP.-Notes on Fetichism. 307 maturity, Indian religious thought must have had as an initial step a phase of fetichism in its first crude stages. Professor Max Muller puts the questions: " Whence came the idea of anything, invisible, say a spirit, to be embodied in certain material objects ? How can we get trustworthy accounts of the present state of religious thought among savages and, what is most important of all, of its antecedents and origin ?" The only origin I would suggest for the idea of anything invisible to be embodied in "a certain material object" is that it took its rise in that analogous phase in childhood, when it attributes life, feelings similar to its own, to material 'objects. The savage (a child too) does the same. In considering the notices by travellers of religious thouglht among savages, we must take into account the period and the phase of thought developed at the period when the notice was written. The phase of thought among certain savages, for example, may have been different at the time of Captain Cook and other travellers, and at a later period. Even among savages there is evidently a progress in the development of religious thought, and in the course of even 100 years they may have advanced a good deal. Professor Max M}uller quotes Mr. Tylor's notices of the contra- dictory accounrts of writers in their statements with regard to religious thought, viz.: in Germainy, the most ancient instance on record, he says, is the account given of the religion of the Germans by Caesar and Tacitus. Caesar states that the Germans count those as Gods whom they can perceive, and by whose gifts they are clearly benefited, such as the sun, the fire, and the moon. Tacitus declares " that they call by the names of Gods that hidden thing which they do not perceive except by reverence," but it must be remembered that near 150 years intervened between the times of Coesar and Tacitus, hence I would say the reason of the difference of phases described. In Coesar's time the Germans were evidently in the phase of nature-worship. In the age of Tacitus they had, it is clear, grown out of that stage, and had developed a higher phase of religious thought. We might remark the same contradictory beliefs, the same inconsistencies in the Vedas (though bearing the same name), for in them there appears to be different phases of thought, but it is evident this is from their being composed at different periods. In the earlier hymns nature-worship is evident, "a mnore childlike state in the history of man," as Professor Max Muller writes; while in the later portions we find a higher idea of divine and supreme power, such as that of Varnua as Lord of all-of heaven and earth. Professor Max Muller in his article on</page><page sequence="5">308 H. M. WESTROPP.-NOteS on Fetichism. the Veda assigns 1200 B.c. as the earliest time for the Vedic hymns, anld in the opinion of the author of the article in " Chambers' Cyclopaedia" on India, the latest writings of the Vedic class are not more recent than the second century. There must consequently have been many phases of thought and religious development, and many contradictory beliefs in a thousand years. It appears to me that fetichism does not consist, as Professor Max Mfuller observes, in cherishing the bones or hairs of the departed, in the reverence of any particular object, as a stock or a sceptre, but it consists in attributing to any object, life, conscious- ness, a power to do good or evil, a power to grant prayers-in fine, a human will and mind. A savage when he prays to his fetish does not do so for the sake of cherishing it, it is for the purpose of obtaining an answer to his prayers from an object which he thinks is endowed with a human will and mind, and has a power to grant them. Fetichism has two phases-the first phase is when a savage attributes life, consciouslness, personality, a power to do good or evil, a power to grant his prayers to any object, a stone, etc., as he does to his father, or to some person in authority, but this does not imply that he considers his father, or the person in authority, a god or spirit. The savage merely recognises in the stonle a power like that of a person in authority to grant his prayers; he has here no idea of a god or spirit; he transfers by analogy the power which he sees in a human being in authority to the stone or other object. The second phase is when a spirit, a god, a power from on high is supposed to dwell in an object, and which colnsequently ought to be worshipped and propitiated; the savage again reasoning from analogy to the reverence and respect which is paid to a person high in authority and power (the Semitic name for god, El, means the powerful one, the person in au- thority). When the savage reaches this stage he must have some idea of spirit or power above man. This conception of a spiritual agency, as a writer in the " Times " says, grows gradu- ally from the sight of invisible power in nature, and from the inevitable connection of the idea of force with the idea of will. The idea of a superior power, a god in the mind of primitive man, is an induction resulting from his perceiving so many powers in nature superior to man, such as the sun, the sky, the storm, lightning, etc. The conviction thence arises in his mind of the existence of a power which he endows with personality, with a higher human will and mind, and which ought, reasoning from analogy, to be worshipped and propi.</page><page sequence="6">H. M. WESTROPP.-Notes on Fetichism. 309 tiated, as he reverences and propitiates a mail high in authoritv and power. The idea of a deity, a mind, an intellect, pervading and governing all nature by fixed and invariable laws, is that grand induction which arises alone in the philosophic mind, resulting from the proofs of the supremacy of law, the evidence of design and order, and the presence of beauty and harmony in the entire system of the universe. The savage worshipping a rude stone that it may grant his prayers, belongs to the first phase of fetichism; presenting food to a tree, because the fetish, an invisible spirit, dwells in it, belongs to the second. The instance of a negro tribe, mentioned by Professor Max Muller, which believes in gods or in a supreme god, is an instance of a tribe that has grown out of fetichism; and to use the words of Waitz, has " progressed much further in the elaboration of their religious ideas." Fetichism may be, however, retained in a higher phase of reli- gion, as Professor Max Miller observes;among the Hindoos, and as may be observed among the Roman Catholics of the present day, worship of the host, in which the deity is supposed to be present, is pure fetichism of the second phase. In Professor Max Miiller's lecture he remarks that the Hindoos could not have passed throuigh the fetichistic phase, as there is no trace of fetichism in the Veda; he might just as well say the Greeks never passed through a Stone Age, as there is no mention of stone weapons in Homer. We have, however, plenty of evidence that the Greeks did pass through that stage, from the number of stone ilplements found in Greece. A writer in the "Times" also remarks that everybody will not be satisfied with the lecturer's inference- that the earliest religious creed of uncivilised tribes cannot have beeii fetichisin, because the Vedic hymns are free from that form of superstitionl. The Vedic hymns may have been written 3,000, 4,000, or perhaps 5,000 years ago. But we dare say Professor Max Muller believes that the human race was old even when the Vedic hymns were composed; and how can they bear witness to the belief of i;he unrecorded arntiquity ? Everything must have had a beginning; language is traced to its first phase in inarticuilate sounds, expressive of human wants, which were the roots and germs of words; writing to its earliest formation in picture drawing; niations to an early Stone Agre, traces ot which are found all over the world; aiid religion to its earliest phase of fetichism. Professor Max Miller puts the question: How do people pick up the conicepts of a supeinatural power, of a spirit, of a god in a</page><page sequence="7">310 H. M. WESTROPP.-NOteS on Feticltism. stone or shell ? The question may be also put, How do children, savages, uneducated people, pick up a belief in spirits and ghosts ? These ideas appear to be natural instincts peculiar to human nature, which spring up spontaneously, like weeds, in the minds of the rude and uneducated all over the world; but we can no more discover their origin than we can tell why certain weeds spring up in a poor soil. My position would be this: That those who believe in a primordial fetichism must take it for granted that human beings passed through a rude and primitive phase when their minds were naturally and instinctively endowed with certain vague ideas of spirits and ghosts, which seem to be the spontaneous outgrowth of minds in a rude and primitive phase in all countries and ages. In the same way we must take it for granted that every human being must have passed through a stage of infancy. Mr. Tylor writes me: " It is very unfortunate that fetichism has come to mean two different things, viz. : "I. Personification of objects, or treating ]ifeless things as alive and personal. "II. Possession of objects by spirits or souls, so that they become divinely active, and to be worshipped. It is in this second sense tlhat I have most looked into fetichism, but in this sense you will see by prinlitive culture that I do not regard it as the original stage in the development of religion, but as a secondary stage arising out of animism. It is this animism, the doctrine of souls and spirits, arising out of a combination of the notion of life with the images seen in dreams, that I look upon as the fundamental fact of theology." He here gives, as I have already pointed out, the two phases of fetichism; the first of which appears to be the initial steps towards the development of religious thought; the other is evidently, as Mr. Tylor writes, a secondary stage. Professor Moliier Williams, in his " Progress of Indian Religious Thought," appears to me to describe the first stage of fetichism very accurately: " It seems that fetichism must be described as the religion of the childhood of the human race. A child inakes a fetish of a doll, or of any other plaything when it animates it with life and personality, and talks to it as if it were a living being, capable of human feelinigs and affections. A savage makes a fetish of any roughly-carved block of wood or useful object, when he animates it with a soul, addresses it as it were capable of understaniding human lanlguage, asks it for a boon and abuses it if his prayer is not g,ranted." In the second stage of fetichism, when a spirit is supposed to dwell in an object, Mr. Tylor's term of " anlimism'" might be more properly adopted.</page><page sequence="8">Discutssion. 31 1 DISCUSSION. M{r. KEANE differed altogether from Professor Max Muller in so far as he regarded fetichism not as a corruption of a high form of religion, but as the starting-point of all religion. It was based essentially on ignorance, fear, and want; ignorance of the real causes of outward phenomena, fear of the consequences, want of the necessaries of life. It arose with the first awakening of conscious thought in the infancy of mankind, and was in principle an exteii- sion of the still faintly developed conception of the ego to external objects. lgnorant of the causes of lightning, floods, gales, and overawed by their injurious eftects, the savage instinctively attributed life, will, intelligence, to these phenomena, and to the natural forces generally. In short, he personified, animated, endowed them with human faculties, and with the power of injuring or benefiting, whence the necessity of propitiating them. But all this seemed ulti- mately to resolve itself ilto the primary idea expressed by the words personification, animism, anthropomorphism, fetichism itself, words which in this connection he had never been able very clearly to distinguish in his owi1 mind, and of which he would be glad to have accurate definitions. Mr. BERTIN remarked that this belief in a soul or shadow, for even material objects appears spread all over the world; as it is well known the Red Indians gave soul to the objects, and the shadow of the dead carried in his next life the objects buried with him. The same belief is noticed amongst the ancient Egyptians; this soul or shadow is called Ka, which is translated, perhaps wrongly, living " image," it should rather be " spiritual image." The Egyptians seem to have believed that the body and the soul had a Ka, for in the book of the dead, the soul (under the image of the bird) and the body are both taking the drink of life. The Egyptians used to swear by the Ka of the king, looked upon as more sacred still than the real body. The same belief existed to a very small extent among the Assyrians. But the Greeks carried it very far, as it is seen in Homer. Plato, in the Gorgias, seems to have reversed the theory: for him, this world is only the faint image, the shadow of one higher and more substantial. He did not think there was any doubt that, as said in the paper, all self-grown religion started from fetichism, anid decayed to be replaced by a higher religious form. Every special form of religion must grow and decay, as every man grows and dies; the humanity does not die with him; so survives religion. The new forms, the new cultes, as is very well expressed in French, borrow from the decayed ones, as the new generations borrow from the preceding ones.</page></plain_text>
