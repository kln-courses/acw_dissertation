<plain_text><page sequence="1">JEAN TRELOGGEN PETERSON University of Illinois Generalized Extended Family Exchange: A Case from the Philippines This article distinguishes between concepts of household andfamily, and explores generalized exchange between households within extended families. Conceptions of essential structural dif- ferences between generalized and dyadic ex- change are adaptedfrom Levi-Strauss to evaluate implications of exchange within these extended family networks. Qualitative and quantative data from three highland Philippine communities are presented to illustrate these conceptions, and to demonstrate the interaction of lateral and inter- generational exchange within extended families. Cooperation, diversification of economic endeav- or, fosterage, and family size are all pertinent to generalized exchange. Examples are offered of the application of this perspective to examination of low-income families in the United States, espe- cially in meeting the needs of dependent elderly and female-headed households, and to issues of family planning and economic development inter- nationally. Generalized exchange among households within the extended family is often central to the welfare of the family. This article explores this premise using three conceptual frameworks. First, I differ- entiate between household and family, and sug- gest that, by failing to distinguish adequately be- tween these two concepts, much of family studies in the United States has tended to focus on coresi- dential arrangements to define and study the fam- ily. Second, I adapt from Levi-Strauss (1949) a conception of generalized, as opposed to dyadic or restricted, exchange to argue that generalized exchange is often typical of extended families, and may be crucial to family welfare. Much of our analysis of families, however, has focussed on dyadic exchange and particularly the coresi- dential marital dyad, and thus has overlooked im- portant sources of family support for some popu- lations. With these first two conceptual issues in mind, I offer data from the Philippines to demonstrate how interhousehold, generalized exchange oper- ates-both laterally and intergenerationally-and how examination of this phenomenon can en- hance our understanding of family organization as a means of assuring family welfare. Specifically, I find that these Filipino families rely on coopera- tion and diversification of endeavor among indi- vidual members, family size, and fosterage to maintain an active, lateral, and intergenerational network of generalized exchange. I suggest that this approach is useful both in the United States and internationally in addressing a range of con- temporary social issues. Finally, I suggest that, by examining the family in its cultural and economic contexts from a cross-cultural comparative per- spective, and by remaining attentive to the possi- bility of generalized exchange between house- holds, we may better understand diversity of fam- ily organization.

Much of the research on the family assumes implicitly that family equals household equals coresidence. Given that house- hold and family are conceptually and actually dif- ferent units, it is clear that failure to maintain the distinction obscures adequate descriptions of the family, and identification of what is, in fact, hap- pening to that social institution. Consider, for ex- ample, the observation by Mary Grace Kovar, a statistician for the National Center for Health Statistics, that there is justifiable concern about "what constitutes a family" (Stanfield, 1992). She explains, The Census Bureau-and by default everybody else--defines family as "people related by blood or marriage living in the same household" and household is defined by separate entrance and cooking facilities. So you could have children living with unmarried parents but [the statisticsl] don't pick it up appropriately. Or a woman lives next door to her kids and sees them all the time, but we interview that woman and say she is liv- ing alone (p. 1564). A separate literature has focussed on house- holds exclusively, essentially neglecting the fami- ly (e.g., Binswanger, Evenson, Florencio, &amp; White, 1980; Wilk &amp; Netting, 1984 ). In this ap- proach, any interaction among households-for example, within the extended family-is ignored, and the household is discussed as if it were a rigidly bounded unit. Within this literature, there is further confusion between those who define household in terms of function (pooling re- sources, child care, etc.; Wilk &amp; Netting, 1984), and those, including the national census, who as- sume that household may be defined adequately in terms of coresidence. This distinction-be- tween a functionally defined household based on pooling of labor and resources, and household de- fined in terms of coresidence-is pertinent to the argument I present here, as well. Functional defi- nitions recognize that resource flows, especially the pooling of resources-that is, holding and managing resources in common-yield a distinct picture of the household, one that may vary from that developed out of coresidential definitions. Pooling, as used in functional definitions of the household, may occur among two or more coresi- dential units, or we may identify two or more functionally distinct subgroups (households) within a single dwelling unit. Support of the sort so frequently discussed in studies of African American extended family networks, for exam- ple, may occur both within households and among households. A recent article from The Population Council (Bruce &amp; Lloyd, 1993) suggests that the house- hold may be an insufficient unit of study given the relevance of resource flows among coresiden- tial units. That study re-evaluates recent work on female-headed households to suggest that ap- proaching the household as a bounded unit and addressing household "headship" alone, a preva- lent practice in research on women in develop- ment and much of the literature on African American families, do not provide adequate "pol- icy tool(s) for identifying vulnerable households, women, and children" (p. 2). Bruce and Lloyd (1993) recognize that "family necessarily tran- scends the boundaries of the household" (p. 3), and may be more important than coresidential ar- rangements or parents' marital status in affecting the welfare of vulnerable populations (p. 30). They call for "a new research focus on the family that transcends the physical and temporal bound- aries of the household, and for a policy focus that inquires into meaningful family relationships" (pp. 3-4). While most treatments of the extended family identify whether they are addressing extended family support within or beyond the household, they fail to recognize any essential difference be- tween the two. The perspectives summarized above clarify that there are, indeed, differences in how extended family support within and beyond the household function (cf. Hofferth, 1984). The following are advantages of extended family, or other support organized within households: (a) ability to coordinate short-term, recurring labor needs; (b) ability to organize short-term, recurring child-care needs, or needs of other dependents; (c) flexibility, that is, ability to change member- ship and organization almost literally overnight; and (d) ability to pool resources, to draw on those pooled resources on a daily and recurring basis, and, consequently, to achieve some economies of scale. This economy is most salient in terms of housing. Disadvantages of household level orga- nization include the following: (a) while individu- als are producing for the household, they are also calling upon and consuming the resources of that household; (b) shared endeavor and pooling leave the household vulnerable to shared failure, or hardship, with little potential, as an isolated unit,</page><page sequence="3">572 Journal of Marriage and the Family to recover; (c) members lose autonomy over the products of their labors, and some may contribute more than they receive; and (d) incompatibility in interpersonal relations cannot be easily tolerated. We can imagine some optimal size and organiza- tion of individual households under varying cir- cumstances of context and need, and a consider- able literature addresses this kind of variation among households (e.g., Wilk, 1984; Wilk &amp; Netting, 1984). Extended family support beyond the house- hold offers a different set of advantages. By man- aging diversity of economic activity, complemen- tarity of those activities, and sustaining coopera- tive relations within the extended family, extra household extended families are able to effective- ly respond to crises in ways that households alone cannot. In part, this is true because the extra household extended family, unlike household members, can contribute to a given household, without drawing upon its resources. Through these various mechanisms, the extended family beyond the household can be seen as providing a source of stability that is lacking in the isolated household. Although the extrahousehold extended family provides stability, it is less flexible than the household; typically, there are relatively few formal means of modifying family membership, including birth, adoption, marriage, and divorce. Understanding differences between the house- hold and the family or, more specifically, the ex- tended family, can improve our understanding of adjustments to short-term needs at a household level, as opposed to much more basic social change, or change in family values. It can also help us appreciate how families operate and what affects variation among families in diverse cir- cumstances, independent of any specific cultural expectations of appropriate family form. Finally, recognizing these distinctions can help us better evaluate social needs and plan to meet them. STRUCTURE OF EXTENDED FAMILY EXCHANGE To borrow a set of terms from Levi-Strauss' dis- cussion of Australian marriage (1949), we can think of the structure of family networks as in- volving both restricted and generalized ex- changes. Levi-Strauss characterized restricted ex- changes (of wives, in his analysis) as reciprocal exchanges between two groups or lineages. Thus, A gives to B, and B gives to A. These are compa- rable to dyadic exchanges as described for some extended family networks (see Johnson &amp; Catalano, 1981). Generalized exchanges are those in which A gives to B, B gives to C, C gives to a D, and D gives to A. Generalized exchanges, as discussed by Levi-Strauss, need not be completed within a single generation or in the strictly circu- lar pattern I have described. Participation in generalized exchange repre- sents an investment in collective future welfare and prosperity. Calls upon kin and responses to kin simultaneously strengthen and reinforce so- cial ties (Peterson, 1989). The importance of the Levi-Straussian distinction lies in his observation that generalized exchange, more than restricted exchange, promotes interdependence and social solidarity. It is a firmer sort of social "glue" (cf. Johnson, 1982). Applied to resource flows within the extended family, one must, of course, ac- knowledge that restricted exchange does occur within dyads, but it is important to recognize, as well, that generalized exchange is pervasive, and important to the resilience of extended family net- works over time. THE PHILIPPINE STUDY The Philippine data presented here demonstrate the structure and management of extrahousehold, extended family exchange, and emphasize the achievements that generalized exchange can sup- port. Methods Primarily two types of interview data were uti- lized in the research presented here. Quantitative data were collected by surveying a random sam- ple of dwelling units in each community. In Communities A and B, no household lists were available, so sketch maps were developed show- ing residences, and one-third of these dwellings were randomly selected for interview. In Community C, this random selection was made from household lists generated by a census com- pleted by the local government a few months be- fore this research was initiated. These interviews typically required 2 or more hours each and, whenever possible, were administered with both male and female household heads present. The data presented here are based on questions about children and siblings of male and female house- hold heads living in other houses. These data, therefore, reflect two avenues of interhousehold, intrafamilial exchange, but do not address the in- tense exchange or pooling of resources among</page><page sequence="4">Generalized Family Exchange 573 siblings or parents and adult children who share the same household (see Peterson, 1992, for a dis- cussion of this). The interview consisted of struc- tured questions, often eliciting strictly quantita- tive data. A wide range of questions was asked, covering subjects' residence histories (where they lived, the dates of residence, reasons for moving) and collecting similar data on employment histo- ry, educational background, and other demo- graphics of household members. Names of chil- dren and siblings residing in other houses were elicited, household inventory was taken, and farm land was inventoried, and, for a subsample, mea- sured. The quantitative data presented here were drawn from questions on the survey regarding de- mographic attributes of children and siblings re- siding in other houses, and from questions that asked, "How do you help them?" and "How do they help you?" The responses were organized into four categories for statistical analysis. In addition to these interviews, individuals were selected in each community for reconstruc- tion of family histories. These individuals were selected for their ability to recall details and their willingness to give time and thought to the pro- ject. Whenever possible, selected members of their kin networks were interviewed, as well, in order to provide additional perspectives on the family history. Whenever possible, both males and females and representatives of different gen- erations were interviewed. These interviews re- quired from 2 to 8 hours with each individual. Each respondent was asked to recall his or her own life history. To stimulate further recollec- tions, respondents were asked, for example, to re- call what life was like in childhood, major turning points in life, and happiest and saddest events. Probes were employed to clarify reasons and cir- cumstances surrounding life events. In addition, a genealogy was elicited from each respondent in the life history component of the project, and, within each geneology, information was elicited regarding patterns of coresidence, circumstances of marriages, reasons for changes in residence or employment, and so forth. Most of these inter- views were formally scheduled, but participant observation was used, as well; my assistants and I lived with these people as neighbors, attended rit- ual events, participated in market days, and so forth. There were many informal opportunities for observation of actual interactions and exchanges. All formal interviews were taped and tran- scribed, and comparisons were made with data elicited from other respondents about similar events or individuals. These data were also com- pared with the resident histories and employment histories from the survey interviews. A time line was developed for each extended family, discrep- ancies were identified and rectified, and gaps were filled in until a coherent history could be de- veloped. The Social and Economic Context Benguet Province in the Philippines is a rugged mountainous area that experienced its first signifi- cant commercial economic development in this century. With a majority of residents living below the poverty line, this area offers, at best, a precari- ous and economically marginal existence to most inhabitants, and, throughout the region, organiza- tion of the extended family is an essential feature of domestic and extended family welfare (Peterson, 1989, 1990, 1991). Traditionally, the Kankana-ey and Ibaloi peoples of this province made their livings by growing irrigated rice in high valleys and along the lower slopes of the mountains, or by growing yams and tree crops on the higher slopes of the mountains. They also dug gold from the mountains and panned for it in their rivers, carrying these treasures down to the low- lands to trade for Chinese porcelains and beads; but significant economic development did not occur until this century, most dramatically fol- lowing World War II and national independence. The traditional culture persists and is expressed in technology, kinship, and religious practice, even among Christians. Benguet is now a busy com- mercial farming, mining, logging, and tourist area, which has experienced expanding industrial prospects in recent years; nonetheless, the majori- ty of residents continue to live below the poverty line, and most communities lie far from roads, schools, salaried or wage employment, health care, and other amenities of modern life. Given the lack of economic opportunity, Benguet resi- dents survive largely because of their ability to organize their social environment effectively. Specifically, they rely on interhousehold, extend- ed family cooperation and on diversification of economic endeavor to see them through crises and to promote economic advancement whenever possible. The specific nature of economic chal- lenge varies from one community to another, and the content and specific strategies of extended family exchange vary to meet it. Three communities were selected for study on the basis of their primary economic orientations</page><page sequence="5">574 Journal of Marriage and the Family in order to explore their responses to economic circumstance. Community A is the most tradition- al of these three, and its lack of access to partici- pation in the commercial economy is a primary difficulty. Access to commercial farming is limit- ed principally by altitude, inadequate roads and transportation, and lack of credit and appropriate technology. Farmers there continue to cultivate rice along the valley floor with traditional plows and draft animals, and to cultivate yams and tree crops on the upper slopes with simple tools and arduous human labor, raising enough for home consumption and, with luck, sometimes a small surplus to sell locally. A few families with fields at higher altitudes and access to roads grow one or more crops of temperate climate vegetables each year for a commercial market. Market access is limited to a narrow dirt road that winds along the mountainside to this community, but does not extend beyond, and that is blocked by landslides every rainy season. None of these farmers own vehicles and all are dependent on the daily bus, or on vegetable dealers, to transport produce to mar- ket. Community B stretches along the upper slopes of a nearby mountain, reaching at some points down into higher valleys. It is almost wholly de- pendent on commercial production of temperate climate vegetables, which were introduced to the area in this century. All cultivation is done by hand, and all produce is carried up steep moun- tain slopes to the road on human backs. Although residents of Community B enjoy better access to schools, a road, and health care than do their counterparts in Community A, this form of pro- duction, dependent as it now is on imported seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and on rainfall or costly irrigation, is risky, and capital and labor intensive. Commercial vegetable pro- duction promises potentially substantial gains, but often generates staggering losses. Community C is a neighborhood in Baguio City. Residents, some of whom grow flowers for a commercial market, enjoy access to jobs in the city, principally as skilled and unskilled laborers and as domestic helpers, or in small-scale buying and selling. Although this community benefits from a support infrastructure lacking in the other two communities, economic impediments still limit access to educational participation and health care in this community. Like residents of the other two communities, they are poor. A Family History Family histories from Benguet Province illustrate the complexity and economic value of extended family support networks. One example of such a history will demonstrate the dynamic of the ex- changes that typically occur. Hector and Zenaida married in 1910, initially living with her family and pooling resources with them. Both Hector and Zenaida had been employees of an American who taught them how to plant temperate climate vegetables. By 1913, they had two children and established a home independent of Zenaida's parents. Eventually eight more children were born. When their first-born was six they began farming their own land. Of the first five children, only the fourth, Ester, finished high school. Ester com- pleted a teacher training course in Baguio City, and returned home to teach elementary school. She encouraged the education of five younger siblings and helped support their school expens- es. She also took in and reared her sister's daughter, a brother's two sons, and two children from an indigent family. Ester married in 1967 when her foster children, with the exception of one widowed foster daughter, Linda, who con- tinued to live with her, were grown and on their own. This widowed foster daughter and her three children continue to live with Ester from time to time when they encounter particularly difficult economic periods. Hector and Zenaida's fifth-born child, Victor, finished high school with support from Ester and married Joanna in 1945. Victor and Joanna's first child died, and a daughter, Selma, was born in 1947. Victor worked as a farm man- ager for a wealthy farmer until 1957, when, by borrowing money from his siblings, he was able to begin farming on his own. He and Joanna had eight children at this time. From 1957 to 1962, Victor and Joanna worked hard to extend their farming operation; they acquired land and learned to fertilize. During this period they planted as many as four crops a year. This effort was aimed at sending Selma to college and, with additional support from their siblings, especially Joanna's younger brother and sister, both of whom had finished high school, they were able to do so. By 1967, Victor found himself always in debt for farming expenses and decided to cut back on farm inputs and, as he expresses it, "do with less." Although he and Joanna still had nine children at home, Selma, who had graduated from college and was working in the city, sent a majority of her paycheck home to her parents. It was during this period that Hector's younger sister had an opportunity to sell 2</page><page sequence="6">Generalized Family Exchange 575 hectares of family land and to buy 50 hectares of pasture and orchard land at a lower altitude. She sought the council of her siblings, who agreed that she should accept the opportunity. Hector explained the value of this move by pointing out that when his sister needs produce or a small cash loan, those siblings who are vegetable farmers can provide it, and if the vegetable- farming siblings are in need of capital when crops or market prices fail, this sister may be able to make a loan. It was also during this peri- od that a younger brother left farming to become a small-scale merchant in the Baguio market, a move Hector explicitly sees as offering further risk reduction to the extended family. Once Selma was established in her new job in 1967, her younger brother, James, started col- lege, with Selma paying his tuition and living costs. In 1968, Selma married a farmer, George, but continued to live and work in the city. In 1969, their first child was born, and George's eldest sister, Lourdes, a single woman who was a travelling buyer and seller of farm produce and inputs, abandoned her business for a time to take up farming and, with her new sedentary lifestyle, provide care for this child. In 1971, James fin- ished college and began supporting his younger sister, Juliet, in college. Three intervening sib- lings, two girls and a boy, completed high school, but did not go on to college. Also in 1971, Selma's second child was born and Selma gave up her job to join George on his farm. A third child was born in 1973 and, in 1974, George and Selma retrieved their first-born from Lourdes, who returned to her business. In 1977, George and Selma moved to Community B, where they could be near Selma's parents and Selma's new job in a mu- nicipal office. George turned his farm over to his brother. Selma's father provided farm inputs, tools, and land to help George and Selma get es- tablished in their new community. Selma and George began paying school expenses for Selma's three youngest siblings, two boys and a girl, and provided substantial financial help to the widowed Linda and her three children, as well. In 1977, the eldest of Selma's younger sib- lings started college, followed by the next in 1979. In 1980, Juliet finished college, and she and James helped Selma and George with the expenses of these three younger children. Selma, out of her salary, paid their tuition, fees, and room and board. In 1981, George's brother's son came to live with George and Selma in order to attend high school and help on the farm week- ends and after school. He returned home during holidays and worked for his parents. By 1983, Hector and Joanna had only one child still at home, and George was relieving Hector of many of his heavier farm chores. This family history is very like others I col- lected in its evidence of cooperation in parent- child, sibling, and affinal relations, in the mecha- nisms utilized to establish and maintain coopera- tion, and in the importance of both cooperation and economic diversification to family welfare. These histories vary principally in the specific choice of economic strategy emphasized by dif- ferent families and in the degree of success achieved. This family successfully combined principally commercial farming and education as avenues to assured material welfare, with some dependence on emigration to different environ- mental zones for agricultural diversification, and on occasional exploitation of urban employment and business enterprise. Other families rely more heavily on emigration to the city, or invest sub- stantial resources in the development of farming enterprises in the lowlands. Roberto, for example, describes how his father acquired a large tract of land in the Cagayan Valley that was developed by a series of Roberto's cousins to provide a hedge against crop failure in the highlands. Angela, who manages both a business and a flower farm in Community C, persuaded her ex-husband and his new wife to maintain her family land in the coun- try, and she took in her brother's son, his wife, and their infant son when they immigrated to the city to find work. Some families offer support for foreign migration, and Primo, for example, is ex- plicit about his expectation that, having contribut- ed to airfare to send his wife's brother and sister to the United States, they will send him money when he needs it. Not every family is as success- ful as the one described in this history. Some can- not sustain the resources necessary to establish an independent commercial farming enterprise or ed- ucation, and some fail because of an inability to maintain cooperative relations in the extended family. The mutual support described here serves two basic purposes. On the one hand, it cushions against crisis and sustains during difficult transi- tions or periods of dependency. For example, the fosterage of children relieves vulnerable house- holds of some responsibility, or it provides labor or some forms of support to households receiving children. The widow, Linda, and her children can and do draw heavily on support from the extend- ed family whenever they need it. Other analyses of this population fully address the frequent role of these exchanges in meeting need (Peterson, 1989; cf. Taylor, 1990). On the other hand, these networks can promote increasing prosperity, for</page><page sequence="7">576 Journal of Marriage and the Family example, by providing support for children's edu- cation. It is significant in this case that, although these people are poor, substantial numbers of children receive secondary, and even higher, edu- cation (Peterson &amp; Paranjape, in press). Prosperity is promoted, as well, when network members farm collaboratively, cooperate in land acquisition or participation in new technologies, or support foreign migration. In this respect, it is not surprising that the literature on extended fam- ily networks reports actively functioning net- works among both the very poor and the very rich (cf. Hofferth, 1984). The complexity of this exchange could not be captured by approaching the family as a coresi- dential unit, by examining only single dyadic re- lationships, or by focussing only on relationships most culturally relevant in a Euro-American con- text, such as marriage or the parent-child relation- ship. Such an approach could not, for example, explain how Victor and Joanna were able to es- tablish an independent farming operation in 1957 or how very poor farmers are able to provide col- lege education for their children, or explain the advantages of Hector's younger brother becoming a merchant or the benefits of Lourdes abandoning her business. It could not recognize the female- headed households in this family history as exam- ples of positive, productive, coping strategies. Without information about the social and eco- nomic context, many strategic activities of this network, and the generalized exchange they prac- tice, would be overlooked. The network of exchanges described in the family history above, illustrates generalized ex- change, as defined by Levi-Strauss, in that the principal contributions recalled are not strictly dyadic (cf. Hill, Foote, Aldous, Carlson, &amp; MacDonald, 1970). Contributions are made in one generation and returned in the next, or made to one sibling and received from another. Thus, Joanna's brother and sister provided principal support for Selma's education. Selma supported James' education, and James, in turn, supported Juliet. Similarly, George's sister, Lourdes, made a significant life readjustment to care for George and Selma's oldest son in a foster relationship, and George and Selma fostered George's broth- er's son. While Ester received support from her parents, she gave support to her younger siblings and siblings' children and to unrelated children, as well. It is significant, also, that none of these exchanges represents what economic anthropolo- gists call measured reciprocity; that is, no ac- counts were kept. Rather, generosity was assumed to serve the collective well-being of the group and need directed the flow of exchange (Peterson, 1989; Sahlins, 1965). It is important to note that restricted exchange and measured reciprocity re- quire some equality of support ability and some degree of complementary needs. Generalized ex- change does not and, therefore, offers a more flexible response to both crisis and opportunity. It is also significant that these exchanges are both lateral and intergenerational. The quantita- tive data collected for the Philippine study demonstrate the structure of these lateral and in- tergenerational exchanges more clearly, perhaps, than do the family histories, and demonstrate how these exchanges are activated at different points in individual life cycles. They also demonstrate the importance of locating analysis in the context of specific communities to appreciate variation as a response to local conditions. The Survey The survey data illustrate the structure of lateral and intergenerational linkages. Elsewhere (Peterson, 1990), I have demonstrated active ex- change of goods and services within sets of adult siblings who are members of different house- holds, and interpreted these data as representing a flow of support among siblings to those experi- encing greatest need, specifically, those who are rearing children (Peterson, 1990; cf. Turke, 1989). These exchanges among siblings are ex- amples of lateral exchanges, and examination of sibling relationships alone, independent of the broader family network, might suggest neglect of the elderly. The survey data presented here, how- ever, demonstrate that these elders, as parents, re- ceive more contributions from children than do parents in other age categories. For them, inter- generational linkages are particularly important. They, of course, have more children and more mature children to provide various forms of sup- port, and, if they are among the few survivors of a once-large sibling set, they may have fewer living siblings than do younger persons. Nonetheless, these patterns of children's support to parents, and of support among siblings, suggest comple- mentarity not only among roles (Peterson, 1990), but also among lateral and intergenerational sets of relationships within the extended family. In short, this provides additional evidence of the ef- ficacy and significance of broad-based, inter- household support.</page><page sequence="8">Generalized Family Exchange 577 In Communities A and C, those over the age of 50 receive assistance from their children more often than younger parents do, and most of that help is given in the form of labor and money (see Table 1). This, in contrast to the low rates of sup- port from siblings, suggests a shift from greater dependence on siblings, and probably on parents, in young adulthood, to equal dependence on sib- lings and children in middle age, and to greater dependence on children among those over 50 (cf. Chatters, Taylor &amp; Jackson, 1985). Only in Community B, the labor-intensive commercial farming community, do younger par- ents receive more substantial support from their children than older parents do. In that community, parents between 36 and 50 years of age (n = 23) receive the most contributions in every category, and labor is the most common form of support (95.6% of all contributions to this age category). In this community, those in the ages 36 to 50 cat- egory make heavy claims on both children and siblings in every category. While the shifts in sources of support found in Communities A and C are perhaps a self-evident product of family maturation, they nonetheless re- flect complementarity of kin relationships in meeting needs differentially over the life cycle (cf. Taylor, 1986). The anomaly of Community B can be accounted for in terms of its unique eco- nomic orientation and it demonstates the impor- tance of examining family relationships relative to economic context. As I have observed above, persons in the middle years must make especially heavy claims on resources from the entire extend- ed family, and this is most evident in the costly and labor intensive economic context of Community C. Like other communities, the de- mands of dependent children are greatest during this midlife period, but these farmers, more than residents of Communities A or C, meet this need with substantial intensification of the farming op- eration by multiple cropping and by increasing the use of labor-intensive farm inputs. This inten- sification is evident in the fact that, in Community C, the majority of total contributions among siblings, and 45.8% of children's total contributions to the group in this age category, are in the form of labor. Strategies and Mechanisms of Extended Family Exchange Clearly, the family exchanges described for Benguet Province meet human needs effectively, and we need to understand better the strategies and mechanisms which promote their effective- ness. The approach taken here to studying family life in context demonstrates four features of this exchange. They are cooperation, diversification of activity within the sibling set, fosterage, and family size. Cooperation. The importance of cooperation is discussed repeatedly in the family histories col- lected. As one old man put it: With help from parents-in-law a young farmer will not need so many inputs, for example, farm implements. He utilizes the farm implements of his parents-in-law.

In the starting most must have capital, they live with their par- ents-in-law so they get to utilize the land of their parents-in-law. One married couple expressed the importance of cooperation as follows: WIFE: For me, if it were always the bank and there were no other individuals helping us out, I don't think it [the farm] would survive, because if they [the bank] gave them [the farmers] a loan and they [the farmers] won't be able to repay them, they [the bank] won't lend again. And they might take the land. Farmers become tenants on their own land. If all the members of the family will be cooperative in helping each other, so that if possible they will avoid borrowing from the bank, then that will preserve the land and the members of the family. HUSBAND: Brothers and sisters lend the equipment, money. I lend them money when I have it. Whoever has the money just gives it. When you need to borrow you go to the family. JTP: Who do you go to first? HUSBAND: Brothers and sisters, then cousins. You might go to parents if they have the money, but parents can't really afford it. Maybe they are still taking care of the family and maybe they are old. Older children might get help from parents, but then they help the younger ones. WIFE: Whenever family needs, also, they will ask for it, and sometimes they will need help for har- vest. We supply. Sometimes we have a good harvest and we check if they are in need. HUSBAND: Some families are more successful than others because of the location and quality of the land. WIFE: The water system and sometimes the person- ality of the family. They don't like to work. They don't help each other. HUSBAND: They are lazy. WIFE: And especially some are very selfish with each other. HUSBAND: They will have a harder time because they must all help each other. WIFE: I think there is no farmer here who made good in farming without the help of the family. They can't farm on their own. They must have some help. All in the family are working. HUSBAND: If we cooperate we can help each other. Economic complementarity and diversification. One woman discussed the need for diversification to assure the welfare of farmers by saying: That's why some of these families are sending their children to school, so that in case they would not have anything to get from farming there are some children who can help. A man described this strategy as follows: My parents tried to sacrifice to keep us in school. Because the parents are hard up those children who are already established will help out.... Now some people will want the college education for their children, because farming is a hit or miss proposition. There is a drought, or calamities, or [you] have a very good crop, but no price. So sometimes it seems that it would not be very good to encourage the children to go to farming because of the risk. Some are forcing their children to go to a profession. They can al- ways predict an income. Farming is so much hit or miss, and if we all go into farming there is not any way to deal with that. Another man commented: I really encouraged my children to get an educa- tion because I come from a poor family. It is good for some children to be professionals, then they can have work even if there is no more land, and they can help each other. Clearly education is attractive because an edu- cated child can be called upon in times of acute economic need or when parents are old and in need of assistance. The specific skills acquired through education may be attractive, too. I asked one man why his daughter went to college, and he replied: It happens in business farming that we are re- quired by the BIR [Bureau of Internal Revenue] to have accounts. So I have to hire always the bookkeeper to do our books. So I thought of'ask- ing her to take up bookkeeping. So she took that course... [and] is our bookkeeper. Even most of the farmers, the relations of her husband, use her. Education is a family matter and not simply an individual's choice, as reflected in this daughter's response when I asked her to recall the happiest time in her life. Now married, gainfully employed and the mother of three healthy, competent, at- tractive children she responded: Probably when I finished college, [when] I fin- ished my education. I made my parents happy. The employment of educated members is also seen as an important means of supplementing household income from the farm, and of obtain- ing fringe benefits, such as insurance and retire- ment, which may be provided.</page><page sequence="10">Generalized Family Exchange 579 Education, although gaining importance as a means of providing access to off-farm employ- ment, is not the only avenue to diversification. Thus, Victor supported his sister's purchase of land at a lower altitude and a brother's retailing activities for the complementarity they provided to his own farming effort. Similarly, Roberto's family and Angela developed deliberate strategies to achieve diversity of economic endeavor within the extended family. Cooperation and diversifica- tion go hand-in-hand. While cooperation, espe- cially through exchange, enhances extended fami- ly endeavor to promote well-being, it is especially effective when combined with diversification of economic endeavor. Fosterage and extended family linkages. Fosterage appears to be especially relevant to the development of the family networks described here (cf. Stack, 1974; Taylor, Chatters, Tucker, &amp; Lewis, 1990). In the data discussed here, Ester, Lourdes, Angela, and George and Selma all pro- vided foster care for younger kin at one time or another. Elsewhere (Carroll, 1970), fosterage is seen as a mechanism that provides children to those who have none, provides nurturance to chil- dren who lack parents, or adjusts gender ratios within families. It is evident from the Philippine data that fosterage also plays an important role in the development of intergenerational bonds and extended family linkages. Family histories reveal numerous cases of children fostered so that a mother may be free to work in the city, because the parents lack the resources for caring for all of their children, or in order to give children easier access to schools. The child who spends a period of time in another household away from parents often forms exceptionally close bonds with those members of the extended family. These particu- larly tight linkages become especially important in the formation of the extended family network across generations. Family size. The developmental organization of extended family exchange suggested by the sur- vey data is supported by the family histories, and it is shown to be far more complex than the sur- vey data alone suggest. Fosterage, affinal rela- tions, cousin relationships, and diverse cross-gen- erational bonds combine to produce a highly ef- fective support network capable of achieving eco- nomic diversity to meet crises and expand eco- nomic options. Family size is crucial to the devel- opment of an effective intergenerational kin sup- port network like the ones described here. While large sibling sets-for example, those with five or more children spaced 2 or more years apart- offer substantial potential for this intergenera- tional bonding and cooperation, small sibling sets do not. The eldest of five children may be 10 years older than the youngest, and, therefore, suf- ficiently independent and prosperous to lend sig- nificant support to his or her younger siblings as they mature. Reciprocally, his or her children may receive support from younger aunts or uncles who are not yet parents themselves. Together, these exchanges promote bonds that endure across generations. On the other hand, smaller sibling sets-those with only two or three chil- dren all within the same family developmental range as they mature and establish their own households, are somewhat limited in their ability to meet each others' needs. Three children, for example, born within 4 or 5 years, experience similar needs at about the same time as they enter adulthood; their children will be of about the same age, and, although helpful mutual exchange may occur, the potential for intense, reciprocal, complementary exchange will be more limited than within the larger sibling set. It is not surpris- ing, therefore, that although other research (e.g., Sussman &amp; Burchinal, 1962) demonstrates the existence of extended family exchanges in indus- trialized countries, these networks are less active and more focussed on affective relations than in the Philippine case described here. Large sibling sets serve parents well, too. There are more children to make returns to aging parents, and at least some of those children, be- cause of the age span in a large sibling set, are likely to be able to assist parents when others can- not. Thus a 70-year-old parent whose health is failing may receive little from the 42-year-old offspring who is struggling to launch his or her own family, while still meeting the needs of young children at home, but the 23-year-old, still single, may be able to provide quite ample sup- port. Fewer children, more closely spaced, may have difficulty meeting the needs of both their parents and their children. Economic cooperation among larger sibling sets, therefore, alleviates some of the stresses of what is referred to in the United States as the "sandwich generation," and of what Oppenheimer (1974) has referred to as "life cycle squeeze."</page><page sequence="11">580 Journal of Marriage and the Family DISCUSSION Understanding extended family organization from a global perspective, I believe, is crucial to devel- opment of a theoretical framework applicable to diverse cultural contexts, and to several areas of effective policy development in the United States and internationally. I address four areas of theo- retical and applied interest. Family Supportfor Dependent Elderly The survey data on support received by the elder- ly, and the structural attributes of that support in the Philippine highlands, invite comparison with attributes of family support of dependent elderly in the United States. Before embarking on this comparison, I must call attention to some of the limitations in such a comparison. First, the United States studies I cite refer, in most cases, to depen- dent elderly, those who suffer poor health and are in need of support services including assistance with bathing, dressing, and so forth. The Filipino population described in the survey is younger, and certainly some of them are more able-bodied. Second, health care in the United States provides for survival of elderly to a dependent age; in the rural Philippines, some of these ailing elderly would not survive so long. Third, the formal sup- port services available in the United States, atten- uated as they are compared to other industrialized countries, are not found at all in the Philippines; if the family or community cannot meet the needs of their elderly members, those needs will not be met. Finally, the family histories from the Philippines offer a diachronic perspective on fam- ily support, while the studies cited from this country are based on data which do not explore family history, and, therefore, do not capture a di- achronic perspective. Given the addition of time depth, it is possible that the picture of these American families would look somewhat differ- ent, as well. The literature on family care of dependent el- derly in the United States distinguishes between dyadic support and support from the family as a functional unit (Johnson, 1983). Dyadic support refers to support received within a single relation- ship, that is from a spouse, child, sibling, or friend. Dyadic support is found to operate accord- ing to what Shanas (1979) has called the "princi- ple of substitution." According to this principle, certain relationships are called on first in eliciting help and, if no individual exists within that rela- tionship, a substitute will be found within another relationship. Thus, among Euro-American sam- ples, married elderly will turn principally to the spouse for assistance, but unmarried or widowed elderly will turn to a child. One principal relation- ship is activated at any given time. There are two types of dyadic relationships, those with peers (spouse or siblings) and those with a younger per- son (a child). Each is characterized by certain limitations. In the case of peers, the elderly peer is often in poor health, as well, and it may be dif- ficult to provide the necessary care (Johnson, 1983; Johnson &amp; Catalano, 1981). Younger per- sons may encounter difficulty in meeting the needs of dependent elderly family members be- cause of competing demands from their own nu- clear families (Johnson, 1983). Moreover, re- ciprocity, or lack thereof, can be a source of con- flict or stress in these relationships (Johnson, 1983). These dyadic relationships can be charac- terized in Levi-Straussian terms, as examples of restricted exchange. LeviStrauss (1949) argues that such exchanges are "not capable of attaining any other form than a multitude of little closed systems ... without ever realizing a global struc- ture" (p. 553). Seen from this perspective, dyadic exchange might produce a less well-integrated, and less flexible, extended family system. Elderly assistance from the family as a func- tional unit is an example of generalized exchange, on the other hand, with greater potential for what Levi-Strauss (1949) calls "organic solidarity" (p. 548). It is more likely characterized by comple- mentarity than substitutability. Thus, a child in the middle years of life, who is supporting young children, may be unable to provide much support, but an elder grandchild can live with the depen- dent grandparent to help out, while the youngest unmarried child of the dependent elder provides financial aid, and a nephew helps by contributing his labor to growing a few food crops (see Peterson, 1989, 1990, 1991). Comparison of sur- vey data on sibling help, as opposed to child-to- parent assistance, as well as the qualitative data on family histories, suggest just this sort of com- plementarity. Chatters, Taylor, and Jackson (1985) refer to this pattern, which, significantly, they find among African Americans, as the "shar- ing of support duties across several helpers" (p. 613). Presumably this kind of sharing reduces the stress of support which falls on one or two rela- tionships in the case of dyadic support. On the whole, although Chatters and associates suggest that their data on African American elderly "high- light the possible operation of a hierarchy of sup-</page><page sequence="12">Generalized Family Exchange 581 port resources" (p. 611), they emphasize the greater breadth of support among African Americans. They also identify attributes of elderly African Americans which distinguish them from Euro- American elderly, and which are similar to the at- tributes of the Philippine populations described here. Older African Americans represent one of our country's most severely disadvantaged groups, limited by inadequate housing, incomes below poverty level, and little formal education. These difficulties are exacerbated by "limited ac- cess to formal societal supports due to discrimina- tion in the areas of education, health care, and the labor market" (p. 606). These conditions are re- markably similar to the conditions of the Philippines and other less developed countries, where limited services, limited educational partic- ipation, limited health care, and general poverty create a context quite different from that experi- enced by most Euro-Americans. This supports the position that social and economic disadvantage promote extended family exchange. A final point of comparison between American and Filipino elderly support draws on my discussion earlier in this article of the house- hold and the family. Shanas (1979) and Johnson and Catalano (1981) find that spouses offer the principle support if they are living. Given my dis- cussion of the benefits of intrahousehold support as opposed to interhousehold support, this is not surprising; daily, recurring needs can be met most effectively within the household and spouses are likely to be coresidential. Extended Families and Female Household Heads The literature on female-headed households typi- cally operationalizes family as a coresidential unit (Dressler, Hoffner &amp; Pitts, 1985; Hofferth, 1984), operationalizes the household as a coresidential unit (Dressier et al., 1985; Hofferth, 1984; McLanahan, 1985; Taylor, 1986), and, therefore, implicitly assumes that household equals family. This tendency persists, sometimes to the extent of overlooking cultural differences or ignoring the extended kin network altogether (McLanahan, 1985). As Dressier and his associates (1985) ob- serve, for example, among African Americans, "family and household are not coterminous" (p. 861). (See Gonzalez, 1969, on the need for "rigid distinctions" between household and family among New World Africans.) Research often does not distinguish between them (see Dressier et al., 1985; cf. Hofferth, 1984; McLanahan, 1985; Taylor, 1986, 1990). Further, this literature appears to be particularly concerned with the presence or absence of a marital dyad within the coresidential unit. This preoccupation introduces a cultural bias that fails to address other highly relevant relationships and sources of support, such as those between grandparents and grand- children, siblings, and so forth, within and among households (see Dressier et al., 1985, for an ex- ample). Bruce and Lloyd (1992), as noted above, have recognized the importance of what I have identi- fied as interhousehold, generalized support in re- lation to variation among female-headed house- holds internationally. From this international work we know that exclusively female-headed households (those in which there are no adult males) are different in two important respects from households that include adult males. Some studies report that in some female-headed house- holds, in spite of poverty, a greater proportion of household budget goes to children and to overall nutritional quality (see Thomas, 1992), as op- posed to alcohol and other luxury items (Hoddinott &amp; Haddad, 1991). Children in this type of household have also been found to be healthier (Kennedy &amp; Peters, in press). On the other hand, we know that these households are likely to be among the very poorest of the poor (Buvinic, Valenzuela, Molina, &amp; Gonzales 1992; Taylor et al., 1990). Apparent discrepancies of this magnitude demand clarification, and may be explained by recognizing the relationships among households and families, and between dyadic or restricted responses and generalized exchange. These observations are not new, but recent litera- ture-especially on African American families and on female-headed households-suggest that we need to be reminded of them. Examination of these two areas of social con- cern in the United States, and comparisons with the Philippines, suggest the possibility of two very basically different structures of family sup- port-one restricted or dyadic, and heavily de- pendent on single (spousal, parent-child) relation- ships, and the other, broad-based, generalized, and flexible. Research has tended to evaluate all support relationships relative to Euro-American or middle-class expectations of dependence on specific dyads.</page><page sequence="13">582 Journal of Marriage and the Family Family Planning Turke (1989), writing about international devel- opment and Third World families, identifies ad- vantages of generalized extended family organi- zation, including "that they provide opportunities to disperse the costs of childrearing from parents who are in their reproductive prime of life to close relatives with diminished ability to produce children of their own" (p. 66). Sibling relation- ships, in particular, have bearing on the effective- ness of the kinship networks in that "in traditional societies siblings are likely to somewhat (or in some cases completely) offset the negative effects they have on each other while young through the assistance they provide to each other as adults" (p. 88). Kin support, and especially sibling support, are among considerations that prompt Turke (1989) to challenge Caldwell's (1981) theory of fertility decline. Given that parents may be simul- taneously receiving support from some children and giving support to others, the issue of the di- rection of net wealth flow between parents and children may be more complex than what has been previously suggested. While net wealth flow is important to macrolevel demographic change, especially to fertility decisions, for the poor any wealth flow may be critical to survival. It is possi- ble to conceive, not of a life-time balance sheet expressed as net wealth flow, but of certain ex- changes which are critical to survival or opportu- nity at a given time. The Philippine data, seen from the approach taken here, support this per- spective. These perspectives on extended family exchange clearly have implications for family planning decisions and resulting family size that may be applicable in the United States, as well, particularly in studying support networks of ado- lescent mothers. Planned Change The kin support network represents an essential form of human collateral which needs to be con- sidered in economic development planning, and the value of that collateral and the form it takes vary with stage of family development. For exam- ple, very mature households or young persons with no dependents may be better able to take risks or to invest labor than midlife households or young independent couples with young children. A range of technological packages, targeting a range of family capital and labor capability, may promote more effective agricultural development efforts, as opposed to a single package which may be infeasible for many families or households, given the human resources available to them at a given stage of family development. Moreover, "innovative" farmers, in the parlance of agricul- ture extension, may be those who have the where- withal in terms of human capital to accept innova- tion, and "conservative" or "traditional" or "back- ward" nonadopters of new technologies may only be those who, at a given point in time, do not have the human resources to adopt the technology offered, but who might be able to adopt a less capital- or labor-intensive technology. Human re- sources within the extended family will affect a family's capacity to make good use of credit and to repay loans, as well. While recognition of the complexity and effi- cacy of the family support network can enhance development efforts, failure to do so can jeopar- dize family welfare (cf. Taylor, 1990). Limitation of family bonds or encouragement of nucleariza- tion of the family anywhere in the world, for ex- ample, through resettlement, urban zoning, or family policies, without concomitant develop- ment of alternative support structures or assured economic well-being, could adversely affect fam- ily welfare. I cannot leave this discussion without address- ing a tendency among anthropologists to view the difference between what I have called restricted and generalized social and economic exchange in terms of evolutionary change or "modernization." Turke (1989) argues that sibling dispersal-that is, geographic dispersal-is characteristic of "modern" societies and, therefore, that the sup- port among siblings that I have identified as gen- eralized exchange, is typical of "traditional" soci- eties. A similar line of reasoning is offered by LeVine and White (1992), who identify greater investment in each of fewer children as an at- tribute of "modem" societies. If, as I argue here, generalized support of dependent family members is characteristic of African Americans and other populations in the United States, these discus- sions of modernity would imply that large num- bers of Americans are not "modem," or that their cultures have constrained their progress. This, in- deed, is the tone of many discussions of African American families or of "familism" among Hispanics (see Vega, 1990). I suggest that dyadic exchange and intense dyadic relationships serve well for those populations for whom upward mo- bility is unimpeded, but less well for those whose access to prosperity is limited by social and eco-</page><page sequence="14">Generalized Family Exchange 583 nomic discrimination. Coontz (1989) provides an insightful analysis of the deterioration of the face- to-face community in the United States, and con- comitant class mobility, especially during the nineteenth century. Families who were able to re- structure themselves so as to invest heavily in few children-and, I would add, limit claims on their resources by extended family members-could, indeed, achieve upward mobility. Many could not. I have suggested that there is a dynamic inter- action between family form, household organiza- tion, and a larger social and economic context. This perspective is contrary to the position that family form causes social outcomes (see Hofferth, 1984; McLanahan, 1985; Zinn, 1989). This examination of different structures of ex- change within and among households may sug- gest future directions for improving our under- standing of the relationships among culture, fami- ly, and economy.
