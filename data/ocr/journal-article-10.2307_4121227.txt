<plain_text><page sequence="1">REPLY TO HILBERT Arnold Arluke Northeastern University Clinton Sanders University of Connecticut We hoped that our article, "If Lions Could Speak" (The Sociological Quarterly 34: 377- 390), would encourage scholarship in the area of animal studies and define such work as a legitimate field of inquiry, as well as to generate discussion about how to undertake a sociological understanding of human interaction with nonhuman animals. Clearly, Rich- ard Hilbert's thoughtful response is a wonderful example of the latter. To briefly summarize his major points, Hilbert agrees with us that research on human exchanges with animals is a relevant and interesting endeavor for sociologists. However, Hilbert maintains that there can be no acceptable evidence in the study of the animal's perspective because it all would be anthropomorphic. As mere human projections, he argues, all we can learn is more about the human mind. Even the "fact" of human mindedness is as questionable a piece of ideology as is our position that nonhuman animals engage in minded behavior, according to Hilbert. In his view, attention should be redirected at "sentience" instead of "mind," and the more appropriate resumptive function should be that humans are animals rather than that nonhuman animals behave like humans in certain circumstances. We agree with Hilbert's emphasis on the shared "animality" of humans and nonhuman creatures and with his position that much can be learned by exploring these common- alities. However, glossing over significant differences between humans and nonhuman animals-as done by some sociobiologists-may lead to ideologically and empirically questionable conclusions (e.g., human aggression and sexual inequalities are "natural" and therefore justified) while, on the other hand, potentially leading to perspectives which do nonhuman animals a disservice by anthropomorphically portraying them as far more similar to humans than they actually are. Elizabeth Marshall Thomas (1993) demonstrates this latter failing in her current best selling book detailing her speculations about the subjective experience of domestic dogs. Focusing then on the "sentience" common to humans and nonhuman animals is, we maintain, overly expansive. While focusing on "feelings and sensations" is interesting and can lead to sociologically significant insights, our intention in "If Lions Could Speak" was to call for research on the intersubjective features of social exchanges between humans and nonhuman animals.

We strongly agree with Hilbert that mind is a social accomplishment (Gubrium 1986; Sanders 1993). The most appropriate route to understanding social interactions, therefore, be they human-to-human or nonhuman-to-human, is to focus on collective action as a practical endeavor premised on interactants' (often mistaken, typically tenta- tive) estimates of how others understand what is going on and how they would like things to proceed. We submit that it would be wrong to neglect the study of communication between humans and nonhuman animals; attending to these exchanges will likely generate a richer, and certainly less anthropocentric and phonocentric, sociological understanding of these matters. While such study necessitates the attribution of at least some linguistic ability to animals, Hilbert is concerned that we label too much as animal language, and that to do so is the "grossest anthropocentrism of all." But we do not, as Hilbert contends, gloss the obvious linguistic difference between humans and animals. Rather, we acknowledge it but ask how animal mindedness might be approached from a nonpositivist perspective that sees animals as more than behavioristic machines (see Wieder 1980). Because animals cannot speak to us in our own terms, Hilbert would have us throw up our hands and say that it is impossible to cross species barriers and understand the animal's experience. He suggests that if we applied the standards we advocate for studying animal minds to the study of women, men would construct an assumingly incorrect picture of what it is like to be a woman. Only if women can talk back can an accurate picture be constructed according to Hilbert. Yet there are human groups where verbal communication is severely curtailed if nonexistent, and yet ethnographers have sought to penetrate these minds too as in the case of Alzheimer's patients, the severely retarded, and others. What Hilbert fails to see, however, is that because animals are seen as language deficient, in human terms, the social scientific community suffers from a bias that minimizes animal "intelligence" and draws overly rigid boundaries between humans and other animals. To accept this bias leaves one forever locked in the same human categories of communicating and knowing, denying the possible discovery of animal-based or animal-sensitized categories. We disagree, then, with Hilbert's premise that the standards for understanding minded- ness must be the same whether we are looking at humans or animals. Instead, the question should be, given the possibilities and constraints of studying the animal's mind, what standards of scholarship might be acceptable to our community? Such debate is precisely what we hoped our writing would stimulate. For example, one question is what constitutes acceptable data in discussions of animal mind? While any attempt to construct theory does violence to that theorized, our article advocated the massing of diverse data from settings in which people and animals interact in order to build a general, sociologically informed, description of human-animal ex- change. However, Hilbert shortchanges much of this data. He erroneously maintains that we attribute "scientific" status to certain material about animal experiences because it is written "eloquently." What makes us take seriously an observation is not the writing ability of authors, but rather the nature of their relationships with animals. Just as we attribute "scientific truth" to ethnographic research, it is not unreasonable to frame the relationships that some people have with animals as a form of participant observation. In this regard, the same question that haunts ethnographers of human culture should also plague those seeking to understand animal culture; namely, is it "all just in your head?"</page><page sequence="3">Reply to Hilbert 539 Equal rigor, system, and candor are required of both lines of research, and these standards can be applied to anyone even if they are not officially an ethnographer.
