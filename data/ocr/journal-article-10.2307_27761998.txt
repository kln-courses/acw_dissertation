<plain_text><page sequence="1">STEPHEN J. SUMMERHILL Death and God in Unamuno: Towards a Theory of Creative Symbolic Imagination El prop?sito de este estudio es analizar el papel de la imaginaci?n en Unamuno a trav?s de dos temas centrales en su obra, la muerte y Dios. Las descripciones de la muerte hechas por Unamuno a partir de la crisis de 1897 muestran que la angustia provocada por su encuentro con la nada proven?a de una imagen. Esto llev? a Don Miguel a replantear de manera impl?cita la naturaleza de las im?genes, y comenz? a entenderlas no en t?rminos de su relaci?n con el mundo exterior tal como se halla propuesta en la teor?a mim?tica, sino en t?rminos de la conciencia que las produc?a. La imagen de la muerte resultaba "verdadera" en el sentido de revelar y expresar la dimensi?n afectiva del ser humano. Tras una consideraci?n de estas ideas en el contexto de la teor?a de la imaginaci?n, se pasa al estudio de la imagen llamada Dios, que surge en reacci?n contra la de la muerte. Dios es enten dido por Unamuno como la forma de un deseo de inmortalidad. La imagina ci?n as? aparece con una funci?n simb?lica, como se puede comprobar si comparamos a Unamuno con diferentes te?ricos del s?mbolo. Si seguimos el pensamiento de Don Miguel, el s?mbolo se manifiesta en la narratividad m?tica cuya funci?n es servir de ideal o valor colectivo a una cultura. Esto aclara la conocida paradoja unamuniana de que lo ficticio es real, y puede servir de punto de partida para un futuro estudio de su concepto mitopo?tico de la literatura. Unamuno often spoke of the prominent role which he felt imagination played in human life, and in many of his articles, would urge his readers to become more open to its workings in their daily lives. He thought that in general the Hispanic peoples suffered from a chronic debility of imaginative powers, and he frequently contrasted this poverty to the wealth of fantasy shown by other supposedly more pedestrian peoples: Si en la Am?rica espa?ola y en Espa?a falta eso que llaman esp?ritu pr?ctico, es porque en ellas falta esp?ritu po?tico, que es el m?s pr?ctico de todos ; si no prosperamos m?s en la riqueza p?blica, en la agricultura, en la industria, y en el comercio, es porque andamos escasos de imaginaci?n, y a la escasez de ?sta hay que atribuir el atraso en REVISTA CANADIENSE DE ESTUDIOS HISP?NICOS Vol. Ill, No. 1 Oto?o I978</page><page sequence="2">48 que aqu? est? el cultivo de las ciencias. Nos superan otros pueblos en el mundo de los llamados negocios, porque tienen m?s libre el juego de la fantas?a y lo aplican a los negocios mismos. ("Consideraciones sobre literatura hispanoamericana" (1905); , 922)1 To Don Miguel, imagination was the most essentially poetic activity of man, a conviction which, in his article "Intelectualidad y espiritualidad" (1904), led him to speak of "la superioridad de lo que llamamos imaginaci?n sobre todas las d?mas llamadas facultades del esp?ritu, y la mayor excelencia de los poetas sobre los hombres de ciencia y los de acci?n" (1, 1141). And again, in "? Plenitud de plenitudes y todo plenitud!" (1904), he called imagination "la facultad m?s sustancial, la que mete a la sustancia de nuestro esp?ritu en la sustancia del esp?ritu de las cosas y de los pr?jimos ..." (1, 1174). In spite of such statements however, Unamuno never elaborated any of his ideas on imagination into a systematic theory, with the result that it is often extremely difficult to determine exactly what was its role in his thought. It is undoubtedly for this reason that, in spite of all the commentary so far produced on him, few readers have attempted to analyze his idea of it. Such a situation is beginning to change however, thanks in large part to the recent and excellent introductory study of E. Inman Fox, "Unamuno y la imaginaci?n creadora."2 Here, for the first time, an attempt is made to isolate the theme of imagination from the profusion of ideas running throughout Unamuno's writings, and to show how it occupies a significant place in his work as early as En torno al casticismo (1895). As Professor Fox points out, Unamuno actually placed imagination at the very centre of his thought, for in his famous "agonia" or struggle against death, it is "por v?a de la imaginaci?n [que] Unamuno se salva de la nada, porque es la ?nica arma que sirve en la batalla con la raz?n. Y la vida es lucha en que la imaginaci?n presta la ?nica posibilidad de desesperarse uno, en vez de resignarse."3 In the present study, I would like to follow up on some of Professor Fox's points by carrying the discussion of imagination into areas which, because of the necessarily introductory nature of his analysis, he either does not mention, or does not develop in detail. What interest me in particular are the underlying notions about imagination running throughout Unamuno's statements on two questions central to all of his writings, death and God. The issues of death and God have, of course, long been seen as important in Unamuno criticism, for, as Don Miguel himself makes abundantly clear, the dilemma of personal immortality about which he was so concerned hinges upon a radical awareness of death, and a consequent reaction against it in search of God. On the other hand, these problems have always been dis cussed in exclusively existential or theological terms, that is, as metaphysi cal, moral, or religious issues of human existence, and though one cannot</page><page sequence="3">49 deny the validity of such approaches to Unamuno, one must also realize the extent to which they ultimately depend upon imagination. Death, for exam ple, is a dilemma central to all existential perspectives, and yet what has never been considered is the fundamental role played by imagination in Unamuno's conception of it.4 By the same token, it has frequently been noted that the God whom Unamuno finds in his thought is imaginary. And yet, awareness of this fact has typically led criticism into theological debates about whether or not Don Miguel really believed in God, whereas it would have been much more important to establish the implications about imagina tion suggested by such a position.5 In order to determine if an imaginary God could be real, one must first determine what images are, and what is their relationship to reality. This is a task which remains to be done in Unamuno criticism, and the present study is meant as a step toward achieving it.6 Now, it is well known that one of the most recurrent ideas in Unamuno's works is the notion that what we normally take to be real is in fact far less real than what we normally take to be fictional. One need only recall for example, his many assertions that man is fictitious, or that life is a dream, or the oft-repeated idea that fictional characters are, as he usually phrased it, "real and true" or "the real reality. "7 Various interpretations have been suggested for this play on words: his belief that man is insubstantial, i.e., "fictional"; his belief that human existence is similar to fiction in that both possess a biographical structure.8 And yet, how not see in the deliberately ambiguous usage of terms like "dream" or "fiction" a clear questioning of the nature of the imaginary, and an attempt to propose the notion that images are in some way real? In other words, the Unamunian idea that the fictional is "more real" than reality implies a conscious rejection of the mimetic or as sociationist theory of imagination dominant in his era, and an insistence that certain images assumed by that theory to be no more than unreal copies of sense impressions received from the external world, are in some way more real than that world, and at times, even its source.9 This would be true moreover, as much in instances where imagination finds expression in works of literature, as in that other case of fictionality, God. Of course, to say this means nothing unless we specify as closely as possible how Don Miguel felt justified in believing this, that is, unless we try to understand his idea of imagination. Here is where the combined problems of death and God come in. In many ways, these two questions stand as an essential paradigm of imagination in Unamuno which gradually expands to include nearly every facet of his thought. And since he refused to theorize about his images, it has seemed to me that the most effective way of drawing out his ideas is to start at the point where imagination is first attributed an important role in his thought, and to thread our way through his labyrin thian path toward the creation of an imaginary reality. As we shall see, there</page><page sequence="4">50 are actually a number of ways of understanding the unreal as real in Unamuno, and one of our major problems is to keep them all clear as we proceed. Before beginning, it should be noted that the major emphasis of what follows is to describe and understand the essence of imagination in Una muno's thought, and that, in this sense, the direction being developed is that of a phenomenology of death and God. My procedure in all instances is to recognize the primacy of what Husserl calls "dator Intuition," and to proceed from there toward an "eidetic" analysis of the phenomena intu ited.10 This is appropriate to Unamuno because, as we shall see, one of the main results of his crisis in 1897 was to lead him toward positions which are often similar to those of phenomenology, though always in an implicit, never clearly defined manner. Unamuno was not a phenomenologist, and much in his work also responds to other traditions, as we shall also see at different times. Nonetheless, if one were to seek a systematic philosophy which would be compatible with most of his fundamental ideas, and at the same time capable of clarifying their meaning, it would undoubtedly be phenomenology, which is why it is emphasized here. We may begin where Don Miguel himself began, in the question of death as it first made its appearance during and after his crisis in 1897.11 In his Diario ?ntimo, Unamuno tells us that, until very recently, he had lived like others live, unconcerned about death, and viewing it more or less abstractly as an inevitable condition of all life: "Viv?a alegre y animoso, sin pensar en la muerte m?s que como se piensa en una proposici?n cient?fica y sin que su pensamiento me diera m?s fr?o ni calor que el que me da el de que el sol se apagar? un d?a ... He vivido como los que se llaman sanos de esp?ritu, fuertes de ?l, equilibrados y normales, considerando a la muerte como a una ley natural y necesaria condici?n de la vida" (vm, 836-37). Suddenly however, this is no longer possible, for he has encountered death and, significantly, feels as if he has been awakened from a dream: "Y he aqu? que ahora no puedo vivir as? y veo esos a?os de ?nimo, de br?os de lucha, de proyectos y de alegr?a como unos a?os de muerte espiritual y de sue?o" (vm, 837). He has a certain nostalgia for the happiness which has been torn from him he says, but at the same time, he feels that he cannot now go back to it. Reality itself is different: "Pero la realidad ahora es otra. Ya no volver? a esa vida, ya no sanar?, tal como mis amigos entienden esto de sanarse, ya no podr? vivir como he vivido. ?Qui?n me ha arrancado de ese sue?o? ?Qu? ha sido esto?" (ibid.). Throughout the following years, Don Miguel was to return over and over again to this initial and by now celebrated discovery of death. We may call it</page><page sequence="5">51 his "moment of anguish." There are, he tells us on numerous occasions, special moments in the life of each person when, in the most unexpected of circumstances, an overpowering sensation of death is felt, and the individual possesses a vivid awareness of his or her mortality. The person feels that one day, he or she will cease to exist, and as a result, a dizzying sensation of anguish is provoked. As Unamuno said in one of his clearest references to the experience in Vida de Don Quijote y Sancho (1905): "Porque hay veces en que sin saber c?mo ni de d?nde, nos sobrecoje de pronto y al menos esperarlo, atrap?ndonos desprevenidos y en descuido, el sentimiento de nuestra mor talidad. Cuando m?s ento?ado me encuentro en el tr?fago de los cuidados y menesteres de la vida, estando distra?do en fiesta o en agradable charla, de repente parece como si la muerte aleteara sobre m?. No la muerte, sino algo peor, una sensaci?n de anonadamiento, una suprema angustia" ( , 209-10). It is important to observe that, of the many passages in Unamuno's work which describe this sensation of anguish, the majority are phrased in such a way as to provoke an identical sensation on the part of the reader: "?Te puedes concebir como no existiendo? Int?ntalo ; concentra tu imaginaci?n en ello y fig?rate a ti mismo sin ver, ni o?r, ni tocar, ni recordar nada ; int?ntalo, y acaso llames y traigas a ti esa angustia que nos visita cuando menos la esperamos, y sientas el nudo que te aprieta el gaznate del alma, por donde resuella tu esp?ritu" (ibid.). Don Miguel was trying to make as many people as possible undergo exactly the same sensation of dying that he had felt so that they too would experience anguish: "Rec?jete, lector, en ti mismo, y fig?rate un lento deshacerte de ti mismo, en que la luz se te apague, se te enmudezcan las cosas, y no te den sonido, envolvi?ndote en silencio, se te derritan de entre las manos los objetos asideros, se te escurra de bajo los pies el piso, se te desvanezcan como en desmayo los recuerdos, se te vaya disipando todo en nada, ..." (Del sentimiento tr?gico de la vida, vu, 134). All of these passages are of course, extremely well known, for it is in them that critics have found the nucleus of Unamuno's existentialism. As Juli?n Mar?as says, Unamuno "nos pone delante de [los ojos], con la m?xima energ?a, la realidad de la muerte y su problematicidad, y nos obliga, queramos o no, a contar con ella."12 Through a personal confrontation with death, Don Miguel encountered an anguish of ontological implications similar, in fact, to what Kierkegaard calls "despair" in The Sickness unto Death ;13 and he came to believe that his and everyone else's consciousness would one day cease to exist. This would be the cornerstone of his never clearly stated conviction that existence is insubstantial ; and it would explain, for example, his affirmation at the end of the passage quoted above from Vida de Don Quijote y Sancho, that anguish gives man a "substantial knowledge" of reality: "Y esta angustia, arranc?ndonos del conocimiento</page><page sequence="6">52 aparencial, nos lleva de golpe y porrazo al conocimiento sustancial de las cosas" (m, 210). "Apparential knowledge" would be the erroneous belief that existence is substantial, while "substantial knowledge," ironically, would be one's anguished awakening to impermanence and finitude. Without exactly denying this interpretation of Unamuno's anguish, it should, however, be pointed out that there is another side to his confronta tion with death which seems much more likely to have been the veritable "substantial knowledge" he had in mind. We may begin to glimpse it if we notice that, whenever he describes his actual experience of anguish, Una muno always uses expressions which point not simply to death, but also to an act of imagining consciousness, expressions such as "imag?nate" or "con centra tu imaginaci?n en ello y fig?rate." In another reference to the same experience in the Diario ?ntimo, he even mentions imagination twice in the same sentence: "Pero es mucha mayor tortura la de la imaginaci?n al esforzarse por imaginarse como no existiendo" (vin, 838). From early in the crisis then, we find him carefully discriminating between actually dying and imagining oneself as if dying, and it is only the latter which is immediately present in his texts. The moment of anguish, we must say, was not a confrontation with death itself (a point which is, after all, self-evident), but with an image of death, a purely "fictitious picture" in which consciousness imagines itself as if ceasing to exist. And if death becomes an issue during the experience, it does so only through imagination, which is mediating its appearance and presenting it in the particular form of a cessation of con sciousness. The point is important but developed by Unamuno with such ambiguity, that it is often difficult to see. Don Miguel rarely ever reflected upon the image of death as image, and therefore seems not to attribute any sig nificance to this question of imagination. When describing death, he tried to present it with great immediacy, as if it really and truly were taking place before our eyes. This leads one to believe both that death as reality was the only issue of concern to him, and that he actually believed death to be the way he was imagining it.14 It is logical then, that his commentators should have disregarded imagination, since he himself does not stress his interest in it.15 The idea however, is not to deny Unamuno's pre-eminent concern for death, but to bring out his equally important attempt to transcend it by proposing a creative dimension of the self which could only be uncovered and expressed by imagination. In effect, we must not be deluded by Don Miguel's skill in constructing verisimilar fictions. He was fully aware of the image as image, knew that it may not even be similar to a real death, and in fact, made it clear on a number of occasions that the image of dying could provide no knowledge whatsoever about death itself.16 If he described death</page><page sequence="7">53 with great immediacy then, it was not because he wanted to show "the reality of death and its problematicity" (in Juli?n Marias' words), but because he was trying to provoke his readers into a new understanding of imagination and the self. In other words, when describing death, Don Miguel was encouraging his readers to activate their imaginations by configuring an unreal cessation of consciousness. In order to carry this off effectively, he had to downplay the unreality by making death appear as realistic as possible. This would make the readers "suspend their disbelief" in the image, and feel with great immediacy a sensation of actually dying. The result would be a realization of the problematicity of death, and at the same time, a demonstration of the capacity of imagination to reveal the affective core of the self. For, as Unamuno often said, anguish forces consciousness to stop and reflect upon what is happening to it: "Es la congoja lo que hace que la conciencia vuelva sobre s?. El no acongojado conoce lo que hace y lo que piensa, pero no conoce de veras que lo hace y lo piensa. Piensa, pero no piensa que piensa, y sus pensamientos son como si no fuesen suyos" (Del sen timiento tr?gico de la vida, vu, 235). Such "thinking about oneself thinking" meant turning inward and recognizing oneself in the act of imagining death and feeling anguish. And at that point, he believed, one discovers that the image has awakened a deep-seated and spontaneous desire to resist annihila tion by creating the life which death seemed to deny. This urge to struggle against death was, of course, his famous longing for immortality, the vital nucleus of the self. In Unamuno's conception, it was an irrational impulse for self-transcendance, a "querer ser" which was rooted in affectivity and volition, and which constituted both the essence of existence and the origin of knowledge.17 To feel it within oneself was the ultimate "substantial knowledge" of which one could be aware, and it was imagination which was responsible for discovering it. Seen in this way, the moment of anguish points to Unamuno's well known vitalism with its emphasis upon feeling and will. What is significant from our point of view, however, is this deliberate ambiguity between reality and fiction in the encounter with death, and especially its implications for a new understanding of imagination. In effect, by showing a fictional death as real, Don Miguel was subtly proposing a non-representational idea of imagination in which the image was being seen in relation to subjective feeling rather than solely in relation to the external world. As experience of consciousness, the image of death was no less real than any other event; and since it had been a catalyst in the revelation of the self, it was central to the acquisition of knowledge: not, to be sure, a rational knowledge, but an equally important awareness of interior being. To reduce fiction, i.e., imagi nation, to the status of an illusion thus became impossible, because it was "real and true" in terms of the self and feeling. Here, clearly, is a well</page><page sequence="8">54 known polarity in imagination theory, the difference between what one critic has called "the mirror and the lamp,"18 that is, between exterior and interior interpretations of images. That Unamuno was fully aware of it is evident in a key passage of Vida de Don Quijote y Sancho, where he asserts that one of the most significant aspects of his moment of anguish was that it led him to a change in his ideas from representation to creation, from the notion of reflecting the world in the mind to that of founding or originating it in feeling: "Y en esa angustia, en esa suprema congoja del ahogo espiritual, cuando se te escurran las ideas, te alzar?s de un vuelo congojoso para recobrarlas al conocimiento sustancial. Y ver?s que el mundo es tu creaci?n, no tu representaci?n, como dec?a el tudesco. A fuerza de ese supremo trabajo de congoja, conquistar?s la verdad, que no es, no, el reflejo del Universo en la mente, sino su asiento en el coraz?n" (m, 210). Since Don Miguel does not explain himself clearly on this point, it would be well to stop here and consider his ideas in the context of imagination theory. This will permit us to establish an initial comprehension of the question of fictional reality, while showing that Unamuno actually belongs to an important intellectual tradi tion in the post-Romantic era. It is not an exaggeration to say that, in all discussion of imagination, two large groups of theories, each oriented in opposite directions, have vied with one another throughout history in a long and as yet unresolved struggle for domination. The first and more widely known group includes what are variously called the "representational," "associationist," or "mimetic" theories. These dominated the positivistic environment of Unamuno's early years, and in general, view images in terms of the external world, that is, as unreal copies of real objects existent in the world. From this point of view, an image is a kind of residual impression of a real object which had been sensuously perceived at some previous time, retained consciously or uncon sciously in memory, and then re-presented later as an unreal semblance in the imagination. The representation itself is usually understood as originat ing in an association of ideas. As R.L. Brett explains it, this is the "mental habit we all have of contiguous association, that is the ability of one image to recall another that has previously been connected with it. Thus the scent of lavender which we are now experiencing will recall an image of the cottage where we spent our holidays, because lavender grew in the garden there. "19 Since the image is understood as a copy of the sensuously perceived in mimetic theory, it is fundamentally secondary in the system of reality, and this in turn has often led to a general devaluation of images from this perspective. Many proponents of mimesis tend to see images as little more than false or illusory objects which may well lead to incorrect judgments about reality if one does not exercise special care with them. The English empirical tradition exemplified by Hobbes and Locke is well-known for this</page><page sequence="9">55 attitude; and we readily recall the notion of la folle du logis, a nineteenth century metaphor for imagination which saw it as a kind of siren, an enchantress who enticed one to seek escape from "the harsh realities of life" by hiding in a never-never land of fantasy. From the mimetic point of view, this would typically be seen as self-destructive, as is evidenced by such celebrated literary characters as Don Quixote or Madame Bovary, both of whom live in unreal fantasy worlds which bring about only disillusionment and even death when the real system of reality is eventually, inevitably it almost seems, re-imposed. Such a final solution is the most reasonable one from that perspective, for though painful, it re-establishes the proper order of reality. The mimetic approach to imagination corresponds to a realistic philosophical point of view,20 and to consider the other perspective, we must turn to the neo-platonic, idealistic and phenomenological traditions. Making due allowances for differences within each of these schools, some of which shall be considered momentarily, it may generally be said that these theories do not exactly deny the idea of the image as copy of external reality; rather, they view this as elementary and insufficient to account for it. They are basically genetic in orientation, and insist that the image must be understood in terms of its relationship to the consciousness which produces it, rather than solely to the external world. From this point of view, the mimetic theory is often criticized because it reduces the mind to a passive role in the elaboration of images, whereas the psyche is felt to be much more active and responsible for its imaginary world. Perhaps the clearest formulation of this position in a contemporary context is the phenomenology of Jean-Paul Sartre. In his two works, L'Imagination and L'Imaginaire,21 he attacks the mimetic theory for what he calls its "illusion of immanence" : images he tells us, are not "things" passively received in consciousness, "things" which can then be compared to supposedly similar "things" outside of it. Rather, they are acts of consciousness, "une certaine fa?on qu'a la conscience de se donner un objet."22 For Sartre, one must first understand images in terms of consciousness, that is as legitimate acts which appear or disappear in function with a consciousness which produces them. In this way, they cease being viewed solely in terms of the external world, and tend to lose their inferiority to it. To imagine is no less a veritable concrete experience than is to perceive or to conceptualize, and it can possess a positive value as part of personal experience. In itself, this is only a point of departure in any genetic account of images, as we shall see momentarily. What can be noted here, however, is that it was precisely this interior orientation with its emphasis upon consciousness, which Unamuno began to insist upon with ever greater certainty after his crisis in 1897. He began a deliberate campaign to undermine the mimetic</page><page sequence="10">56 assumption that images are merely illusory by showing his imaginary death as subjectively "real and true." This happened because the self which the image had uncovered now appeared as the ontologically prior reality of all mental activity,23 and therefore became the determining factor in establish ing the basis of imaginary activity. Unamuno would insist upon this point throughout the rest of his work, for as he said later in "Salvar el alma en la historia" (1915) : "Y para m? m?s inmediato y m?s real y hasta m?s duradero es un sentimiento m?o, un dolor, un goce, una idea, una esperanza, un ensue?o, que un dedo de mi mano, o que mi h?gado mismo. Un estado de mi conciencia tiene para m? tanta realidad, por lo menos, como mis piernas, mis brazos o mi cabeza" (vil, 1002). On the other hand, it is insufficient merely to establish this interior perspective if we do not further clarify which kind of subjectivistic theory seems operative in Unamuno. The fact, for example, that the issue of imagination is being formulated as a problem of reality and truth is less reminiscent of Sartre than it is of idealism, especially the Romantic question of imaginary knowledge. The belief that imagination could provide a valid form of knowledge about reality was, of course, one of the essential themes of idealism, and constituted a means by which writers of the Romantic period tried to vindicate the interior life over and against the mechanistic rationalism of the Enlightenment.24 By providing what Kevin Kerrane in reference to Kant calls "a special form of knowledge, a formulation of experiential particularity rather than logical universals,"25 imagination came to function as revealer of the interior life, and it is this same reality and truth which is being defended by Unamuno. The Romantic origin of Don Miguers ideas becomes all the more evident if we realize that the idea of imaginary knowledge was notoriously ambiguous in its own period, and that this same ambiguity likewise appears in Una muno. Whereas rigorous idealism limited images to phenomena of the mind and therefore allowed the truth to which they gave access to be no more than interior being, many went beyond this into what is essentially a neo-platonic position by proposing imaginary knowledge to be a revelation of a supersensuous Reality and Truth. Schelling's Naturphilosophie, with its notion of a "world's soul," is an example of this tendency to extend the imaginary almost into a religious domain.26 Unamuno, too, often suggests this same ambiguity about the full reach of imaginary knowledge. Since the image of death is partly pointing toward God, as we shall see momentarily, it is tempting to take his affirmation of a "conocimiento sustancial" as an allusion to a superior Truth and Reality. However, he was always uncertain about how really Real such a creation was, and therefore held off from proceeding fully into such a mystical belief. In the end, then, the imaginary knowledge is primarily an idealistic concept</page><page sequence="11">57 which refers to awareness of self and feeling, but which vacillates in a failed struggle to become a neo-platonic vision of Reality. It is this vacillation, this struggle to transform interior truth into superior Truth, which is very reminiscent of the whole issue of imagination as it appears in the Romantic era. All of this places us at a first level of understanding in Unamuno's celebrated ambiguity about reality and fiction: not simply the idea that human existence is insubstantial as has so often been said, but the far more complex notion that imagination is as real as, or more real than, what is normally taken to be real (the sensuously perceived) because it uncovers the interior dimension of feeling. We shall soon see other reasons for asserting the fictional to be real, some of them more important, I believe, than this first one. Even then, however, the basic notion of the capacity of imagination to awaken a "new reality" of affective life always stands as primary in his writings, and as an initial point upon which other ideas will be based. Now, the moment of anguish forced Unamuno to turn his back on the exterior world and journey adentro to imagination and feeling. On the other hand, since he was concerned about the ongoing experience of anguish, he did not stop to consider further aspects of his image of death, but turned instead to subsequent states provoked by the angustia. This in turn led to still more implications about imagination, which now became charged with the task of bringing him back to the exterior world. The return trip would have as its goal a material "real-ization" of feeling, that is, nothing less than an actual creation in matter of this almost ineffable realm, the affective. This is the ultimate sense of the passage quoted above which contrasts representa tion to creation: once he had discovered that truth does not lie in seeing images as imitations ("el reflejo del Universo en la mente") but as revealers of feeling ("su asiento en el coraz?n"), he could set out on the road to creation. This leads directly to God and the other ways in which Unamuno understood how fiction can be real. Unamuno came closest to giving his most complete account of God in the second half of Del sentimiento tr?gico de la vida. Though the ideas expressed there are well known, they may be recapitulated briefly here in order to establish the outlines of the issue before us. Don Miguel describes the state of anguish which results from the image of death, and says that, in the midst of its sorrow, consciousness begins to feel compassion first toward itself, then toward all things, because nothing seems permanent: Seg?n te adentras en ti mismo y en ti mismo ahondas, vas descubriendo tu propia inanidad, que no eres todo lo que eres, que no eres lo que quisieras ser, que no eres en</page><page sequence="12">58 fin, m?s que nonada. Y al tocar tu propia nader?a ... te compadeces de todo coraz?n de ti propio, y te enciendes en doloroso amor a ti mismo, matando a lo que se llama amor propio ... ... Porque de este amor o compasi?n a ti mismo, de esta intensa desesperaci?n, porque as? antes de nacer no fuiste, as? tampoco despu?s de morir ser?s, pasas a compadecer, esto es, a amar, a todos tus semejantes y hermanos en aparencialidad, ... (vil, 191) He is describing here a situation of sympathy felt toward the universe which depends upon imagination, and which involves an act of personalizaci?n or anthropomorphic animation. Consciousness configures an image of exterior objects as if endowed with the same feeling of anguish that is being suffered within. The projected feeling of one's own anguish and desire to be perma nent then begins to stand out by itself as a quality common to all things, and is sensed as if it were a living person independent of both the individual consciousness which is projecting it, and the world upon which it is being projected. It is this animated quality which is none other than God: El amor personaliza cuanto ama. S?lo cabe enamorarse de una idea personaliz?ndola. Y cuando el amor es tan grande y tan vivo, y tan fuerte y desbordante que lo ama todo, entonces lo personaliza todo y descubre que el total Todo, que el Universo, es Persona tambi?n que tiene una Conciencia, Conciencia que a su vez sufre, compadece y ama; es decir, es conciencia. Y a esta Conciencia del Universo, que el amor descubre personalizando cuanto ama, es a lo que llamamos Dios, (vu, 192) God then, is a "proyecci?n de nuestra conciencia a la Conciencia del Uni verso" (vii, 207) an imaginary form of man's desire to be permanently conscious. Given such ideas, the basic point about God in Unamuno is that he is a vision or image of the ideal fabricated in response to the feeling of perma nence which is uncovered by the image of death and anguish. Consciousness reacts anguishedly against the image of death by feeling a desire to become permanent; and the imagination then starts to give form to this feeling by picturing the universe as if also struggling to become permanently con scious. As this is done, consciousness begins to feel as if everything outside of it were alive, just like itself, and gradually there appears a Total Person incarnating this quality of permanence and imagined as capable of guaran teeing it in the universe. This imaginary person is God. He is the subjective desire for permanence achieved on the imaginary plane, the most complete of man's "locos ensue?os" (vii, 252), a "dream" endowed with an thropomorphic or human form. The essential postulation upon which this approach to God is based was seen above in reference to the image of death, a fundamental priority</page><page sequence="13">59 accorded by Unamuno to feeling and desire as origin and source of the image. The desire to be permanent functions as a kind of unconscious drive motivat ing the act of imagining consciousness: "Y recordando lo que en otra parte de esta obra dijimos, podemos decir que ... las cosas ideales brotan del amor y del amor brota Dios, en quien esas cosas ideales conglobamos, como en Conciencia del Universo" (vu, 198).27 The result is that the image stands first and foremost as an actualization of feeling and desire. This is why Unamuno always emphasized the predominance of querer in God: "Es la esperanza en Dios, esto es, el ardiente anhelo de que haya un Dios que garantice la eternidad de la conciencia, lo que nos lleva a creer en El" (vu, 219). In effect, man creates a transcendant creator as an expression of his wish to be permanently conscious. Now, though Don Miguel never made himself very clear on this point, the most immediate consequence of his position is to complete the implications of his reflection on the image of death by rendering the mimetic theory inadequate as an account of God. God cannot be understood as a copy of some pre-existent person or thing taken as real, because the activity of imagining does not consist in reproducing but in giving form to desire. Before all else, God is a figure of human hope, "el ensue?o de la esperanza" (vu, 227) in Don Miguel's phrase. He is an absence rendered present imaginatively.28 He is not a "re-presentation," but an invention, to use a term employed by Unamuno in other similar contexts.29 This does not mean that the actual image lacks elements developed through association with the concrete mate rial world. On the contrary, we have already seen that it is analogous to a human being in its form insofar as it is anthropomorphic in appearance. In fact, it could not be otherwise in Unamuno's conception, for all forms of an "other life" take their shape from those of this world: "Y no nos es en efecto, pensable otra vida sino en las formas mismas de esta terrena y pasajera" (vu, 242). But in Unamuno, such associations must be understood as instruments of an ontologically prior feeling which uses them for its purposes. In other words, the forms of imagining consciousness come from experience of the material world, but they are used for a purpose, and this purpose belongs to consciousness, which alone is responsible for using or combining them in this way.30 Feeling transfigures31 the forms of imagining consciousness into significant or meaningful form, and it is this, the significance of the image, which assures that it is not an imitation but an invention of consciousness. In speaking thus of meaning, we reach the heart of both God and imagina tion in Unamuno. God for Don Miguel, is essentially a meaning in imagi nary form, a meaning which has been invented by consciousness in dialecti cal reaction against the earlier image of death, and in response to conscious ness' longing for permanence. Faced by an imaginary death, consciousness reacts by feeling a desire not to die, and then proceeds to give form to this</page><page sequence="14">60 feeling by configuring a "counter-image" of the missing meaning. Imagina tion thus emerges as a mental capacity whose primary task is to provide significance. This immediately places us in the domain of symbolism. At one point in his Diario ?ntimo, Don Miguel indirectly alludes to his idea of God as a "s?mbolo," and though the context of the passage does not clarify what he understands by the term,32 there can be little doubt but that this is the word which most adequately accounts for his whole vision of God. The term symbol is, of course, one of many which point to the idea of giving meaning through a process of relating one thing to another,33 and though there has long been widespread confusion about such signification words (like index, icon, and especially sign and allegory), recent studies provide clear distinc tions which help to avoid uncertainty. According to the French an thropologist Gilbert Durand,34 a symbol properly speaking is the imaginary appearance of some non-sensuous meaning, either of the unconscious or of the supernatural, which, because by definition it cannot appear in material form, is only accessible indirectly (i.e., symbolically) as an image. The symbol stands for something conceived as mysterious or unspeakable, while at the same time it seems to take on the very qualities of its meaning and become it in a way. This makes it fundamentally paradoxical: on the one hand, it is inadequate to its ultimate meaning, but on the other, it is conceived as analogous to it, and often just as sacred or mysterious as that for which it stands. Unamuno's God is very close to this idea. On the one hand, he under stands God as nothing less than a fully transcendant and mysterious being, "lo absolutamente indefinible" (vu, 210), a being felt as supreme and beyond the power of man to grasp, "la divinidad sentida como persona y conciencia ?nica, fuera de nosotros" (vil, 203). And yet, throughout his entire presen tation of his ideas, he never loses sight of his sense that the image is an expression of the self's longing for God: "Y la creencia en un Dios personal y espiritual se basa en la creencia en nuestra propia personalidad y es piritualidad. Porque nos sentimos conciencia, sentimos a Dios conciencia, es decir, persona ..." (vu, 198). Indeed, feeling is so pre-eminent as the ultimate basis of God that the imaginary configuration even takes on a certain secondarity, for he says that he does not care what God actually "looks like," and leaves it up to each person's fantasy: "Y tal es el Dios del amor, sin que sirva el que nos pregunten c?mo sea, sino que cada cual consulte a su coraz?n y deja a su fantas?a que se lo pinte en las lontananzas del Universo, ..." (vil, 215). And yet, none of this detracts from the mysterious and sacred reality which seems incarnated in the vision. Here then, we see what might be called the constant tension of all symbols: on the one hand existing as epiphanies which are sacred and mysterious ;35 yet on the other, perpetually referring to something else as the final sense of their being.</page><page sequence="15">61 There is another aspect of Unamuno's God which likewise points to symbolism. Ever since Kant first formulated a theory of symbolic imagina tion in his Kritik der Urteilskraft, it has been common to distinguish symbols from concepts, that is, to oppose the concrete or aesthetical idea to the abstract or rational idea. Thus, as Kant explains it, one of the peculiar characteristics of the symbol or aesthetical idea is that it is prior to abstraction and acts as a kind of stimulus to reason without however reason ever being capable of defining it: "unter einer ?sthetischen Idee aber verstehe ich diejenige Vorstellung der Einbildungskraft, die viel zu denken veranla?t, ohne da? ihr doch irgend ein bestimmter Gedanke, d.i. Begriff ad?quat sein kann, die folglich keine Sprache v?llig erreicht und verst?ndlich machen kann."36 This seminal idea is undoubtedly the origin of Unamuno's insistence upon the priority of his "Dios cordial" over the "Dios racional" of theology. Don Miguel felt it very important to keep clear that his God was felt not reasoned and that, consequently, no concept of God could ever adequately com prehend the immediately loved God whom he had in mind: "El conocimiento de Dios procede del amor a Dios, y es un conocimiento que poco o nada tiene de racional. Porque Dios es indefinible. Querer definir a Dios es pretender limitarlo en nuestra mente, es decir, matarlo. En cuanto tratamos de definirlo, nos surge la nada" (vu, 208). In other words, Unamuno's God is very much an aesthetical idea in Kantian terminology, a symbol which could never be encompassed by reason; and the God of theology is but reason's inadequate attempt to grasp this image: "Y de este Dios surgido as? en la conciencia humana a partir del sentimiento de divinidad, apoder?se luego la raz?n, esto es, la filosof?a, y tendi? a definirlo, a convertirlo en idea. Porque definir algo es idealizarlo, para lo cual hay que prescindir de su elemento inconmensurable o irracional, de su fondo vital" (vu, 203). As Kant says, when symbols are produced, "so ist die Einbildungskraft hiebet sch?pferisch, und bringt das Verm?gen intellektueller Ideen (die Vernunft) in Be wegung."37 Finally, we can see symbolism in Unamuno's God by considering what Durand says about the general sense of symbolic imagination or "la fonction fantastique," as he calls it. Essentially, he tells us, symbolic imagination is a dialectical activity of consciousness which "a pour scandaleuse fonction g?n?rale de nier ?thiquement le n?gatif."38 By this he means what he calls "l'euph?misme," a capacity of consciousness to negate experiences which seem to it negative, particularly the most negative one of all, the threat of death, by proposing an image of something better. This image is the symbol: "Le sens supreme de la fonction fantastique, dress?e contre la destin?e mortelle, est donc l'euph?misme. C'est ? dire qu'il y a en l'homme un pouvoir d'am?lioration du monde. Mais cette am?lioration n'est pas, non</page><page sequence="16">62 plus, vaine speculation 'objective/ puisque la r?alit? qui ?merge ? son niveau est la cr?ation, la transformation du monde de la mort et des choses en celui de l'assimilation ? la v?rit? et ? la vie."39 The idea here is that of possibility: imagination is a capacity to improve upon the present by proposing a symbol of something better, the possible.40 Creation could then result if the symbol could be brought into existence outside the consciousness of the imaginer. This last part will come momentarily ; for the moment however, it should be noted that, from the point of view of Durand, the symbol "appara?t comme r?tablissant l'?quilibre vital compromis par l'intelligence de la mort,"41 and is called by him "la figure m?me de notre esp?rance essen tielle,"42 a phrase remarkably similar to Unamuno's "ensue?o de la esperan za" mentioned earlier. At the same time, Durand insists that the study of symbols "d?bouche sur cette in?vitable constatation: r?gime diurne comme r?gime nocturne de l'imagination43 organisent les symboles en des s?ries qui reconduisent toujours vers une infinie transcendance qui se pose comme valeur supr?me. Si le symbolologue doit ?viter avec soin les querelles des th?ologies, il ne peut gu?re esquiver l'universalit? de la th?ophanie." 44 In other words, symbolic imagination always leads to the single great issue which Unamuno made the cornerstone of his thought, the visible appearance of God to man. Don Miguel thus appears to have been eminently justified in conducting his discussion of imagination at the level of nothing less than God himself, for he was really dealing with symbolic imagination ; and it is here, on the level of theophany, that symbolism must face its ultimate reason for being. This reason, as both Unamuno and Durand indicate, is to become more than a merely escapist route into illusion by opening up a future, possible realm of human freedom: Los m?s locos ensue?os de la fantas?a tienen alg?n fondo de raz?n, y qui?n sabe si todo cuanto puede imaginar un hombre no ha sucedido, sucede o suceder? alguna vez en uno o en otro mundo. Las combinaciones posibles son acaso infinitas. S?lo falta saber si todo lo imaginable es posible, (vu, 184) And: Cuanto ha sido no puede ser sino como fue, y cuanto es no puede ser sino como es ; lo posible queda siempre relegado a lo venidero, ?nico reino de la libertad y en que la imaginaci?n, potencia creadora y libertadora, carne de la fe, se mueve a sus anchas, (vu, 226-27) Compare both of these statements with the following one of Durand: Ce qui leste d'un poids ontologique le vide s?miologique des ph?nom?nes, ce qui vivifie la repr?sentation et l'assoiff? d'accomplissement, c'est ce qui a toujours fait</page><page sequence="17">63 penser que l'imagination ?tait la facult? du possible, la puissance de contingence du futur. ... Aussi l'imaginaire, bien loin d'?tre vaine passion, est action euph?mique et transforme le monde selon l'Homme de D?sir .. ,45 At the same time, Unamuno was deeply aware that a symbol ultimately stemmed from the past, not simply the individuar s own personal world, but above all the collective past of a people. Thus, it would have been meaning less in his view to seek symbols unrelated to the cultural past of Spain. As he said in "Pasado y porvenir" (1908) : "Esto es lo que creo no debe usted perder de vista y es que el porvenir brota del pasado y que no pueden imaginarse y representarse un porvenir ni los hombres ni los pueblos que no tienen pasado y memoria de ?l. Las esperanzas se costituyen [sic] con recuerdos y quien no recuerda no espera" (iv, 929). On the other hand, behind Unamuno's ideas there was always a deep seated doubt about actually being able to give a full existence to the symbol, at least to the particular one called God. He did however propose a series of ideas which try to explain how this would be done, and it is to them, the final level of making fiction real, that we must now turn. Up to this point, we have traced Unamuno's thought to a doctrine of symbolism. However, we have yet to leave the solitary confines of individual consciousness where the symbol is first generated; and no matter how significant - how "real and true" - Unamuno might have believed this to be, it is still very dubious whether one could validly convince anyone of its reality at such an aethereal level. But Don Miguel was well aware of this problem, and always insisted that everything individual must be transcended into a social and historical order, even if antagonistically: "Y todo lo que el hombre hace como mero individuo, frente a la sociedad, por conservarse aunque sea a costa de ella, es malo, y es bueno cuanto hace como persona social, por la sociedad en que ?l se incluye, por perpetuarse en ella y perpetuarla" (vu, 235). In other words, he knew that the symbol would remain incomplete and fundamentally frustrated unless it in some way became operative within a collective and historical setting. Theoretically, this should not have presented any problem because, though his description has been strictly ontogenetical up to this point, he felt that imagination was fundamentally a "social sense" which worked primarily on a collective or communal level of existence. This was related to the idea mentioned above about the emanation of the symbol from the collective past of a people, and it dictated that the symbol should spring spontaneously from all men in more or less the same form, particularly the symbol called God because: "... si hay sentimiento y concepto colectivo, social, es el de Dios, aunque el individuo lo individualice luego" (vu, 202). On the other hand, he also believed that</page><page sequence="18">64 post-Renaissance man had suffered a loss of social consciousness, largely because of the dominance of reason in society,46 and this in turn had atrophied imagination in most men. His task then, was in opposition to his society and conducted largely in isolation as an attempt to awaken individu als to their dormant power of giving meaning. In order to see how God and symbols are created in Unamuno, we may begin by considering a 1905 essay, "Sarta de pensamientos." The article covers a series of themes among which is one about man's fear of knowing himself. Don Miguel suggests that strange, inexplicable ideas frequently pass through men's minds but that they are constantly rejected as locuras because people are afraid to abandon the categories of thought within which they were raised as children. One such notion which keeps occurring to him is that these very ideas actually come from another world which is trying to force its way into his own pre-set habits. This of course sounds strange, but that is the point: Unamuno feels that he must remain receptive to these follies and allow the "other" universe to speak itself through him: Es una de esas cosas que se nos ocurren de repente, sin enlace alguno con el curso de nuestros pensamientos, sin justificaci?n ni aun para nosotros mismos. Mas por esto mismo debo agarrarla y fijarla en escrito ; porque no es m?a sino que ha venido a m?, no s? de d?nde ni para ir a d?nde ; porque es un meteoro, un aerolito ideal que cruza por la atm?sfera de mi mente, surc?ndola desde no s? qu? ignoto asteroide perdido en los abismos del firmamento de las ideas madres, (vu, 434) In the end, "Es mejor que hable el universo por nuestra boca que no el que queramos hablar en nombre de ?l" (ibid.). It is this notion of "ideas madres" which holds the key to the realization of the symbol in Unamuno. The idea can best be understood in the context of mythical archetypes. Unamuno believed that the anthropomorphic symbol originated in a transsubjective source within consciousness, imagination, and that it strove to become incarnate through language, especially in the form of a narrative or story. Properly speaking, such a story would be a myth, though he often also called it a leyenda. In the case of God, this myth would be found most of all in the Book of Genesis, with its many imaginary stories describing in symbolic fashion underlying patterns of man's relation ship to the divine and to other men. Because the world of symbolic imagina tion is transsubjective, the myths themselves are not controlled by con sciousness, which thus is limited to transcribing stories which it does not completely understand. This very fact however also means that the tran scribed stories evidence patterns of repetition, archetypal structures, among differing particular examples and at different points in history. Don Miguel never went so far as to try to organize these archetypes systematically</page><page sequence="19">65 because he was more interested in the underlying nature of myth itself. This, however, did lead him to concentrate upon one particular pattern which he saw as a kind of "metamyth," a myth about the very problem of mythifica tion. This was the story of Christ in the New Testament, whose doubting self-sacrifice to the symbol called God was repeated at a later historical moment in Don Quixote's failed attempt to live under the aegis of the imaginary, and then was re-written by Unamuno himself in the novel San Manuel Bueno, m?rtir.47 These three narratives would all constitute par ticular versions of an archetype which describes the very dialectic of imagina tion itself, that is, the problematic attempt of someone to negate a dissatisfac tion by creating a life in which the imaginary is pre-eminent. Now, because Unamuno felt that mythical narrative expressed a "truth" about man, he believed that it could and must function as a frame of reference through which to understand the events of the exterior world. In any given myth, this referentiality may not immediately be apparent since its form is symbolical rather than direct, and it may therefore appear to lack verisimilitude.48 This however would be a secondary problem because all symbols require interpretation to elicit their meaning, and once this is done, their reference to everyday life can be clarified.49 If such clarification is established, and if the myth does indeed come to be seen as a frame of reference to the world, then it is acting as a source of values, and to that extent, has become real. As Mircea Eliade has said of myth among peoples in archaic societies: "... the myth is regarded as a sacred story, and hence a 'true history,' because it deals with realities."50 As soon as one concedes an initial significance to imagination as discoverer of an interior truth, then the narrative which records it "becomes," in Eliade's words, "the exemplary model for all significant human activities."51 It becomes, as Unamuno so often said, a "fictional reality." It was this last stage of the imaginary to which Unamuno's celebrated ambiguity about reality and fiction finally pointed: not simply the non sensuous reality of interior feeling, not simply the reality of symbolic imagination, but, as a result of both of them, the reality of mythical narrative as exemplary model for understanding existence. It is no coinci dence that Don Miguel called a volume of his short fiction Tres novelas ejemplares. Though the explicit allusion is to Cervantes' exemplary novels, there can be little doubt but that he ultimately meant the exemplarity of myth, as could be shown, I believe, by a careful analysis of the prologue which precedes the volume.52 The final sense of this is to suggest that imagination, far from merely copying the world as had been proposed in the mimetic theory, is affirmed as its source, because history, the concrete particular of existence, is understood as a product of symbols. Imagination ends up as nothing less than the creator of reality.</page><page sequence="20">66 This final stage in Unamuno's thought was developed above all after World War I, and shifted the terms of the original ambiguity from a question of reality and fiction to one of history and myth. In what was a deliberate attempt to disrupt the Aristotelian opposition between history and poetry, Don Miguel insisted that history begins in the myth or legend which is transmitted from generation to generation in "faith-making" documents, that is, fictional tales which are believed as real and then chronicled by later historians. As he said in "En San Juan de la Pe?a" (1932): "Que el hecho hist?rico es espiritual y consiste en lo que a los hombres se les hace creer que queda de lo que pas? en la leyenda. La leyenda empieza con el documento fehaciente, que hace fe, que hace creencia, y se agranda con la cr?nica" (1, 685-86). It was this conversion of history into myth which allowed Una muno to say of himself in C?mo se hace una novela (1927) : "Somos b?blicos. Y podemos decir que en el principio fue el Libro. O la Historia. Porque la Historia comienza con el Libro y no con la Palabra y antes de la Historia, del Libro, no hab?a conciencia, no hab?a espejo, no hab?a nada" (vm, 732). The objection that God or any other symbol is still not actually real within such a vision because he never escapes imagination, even if that of a whole society, of course remains an issue. But this was the issue for Unamuno: he was fully aware of the fictitious element behind all symbols and myth, and was simply pointing out this ultimate dependence upon personal and collec tive faith in the capacity of imagination to play a significant role in existence. Don Miguel left open what would really happen if men were actually to possess such a full faith. In his article "El sepulcro de Don Quijote" (1905), he said that his readers should undertake a contemporary crusade in search of the sepulchre of "Our Lord" Don Quijote.53 In spite of his apparent extrava gance, his meaning is clear and consistent: if one accepted the novel as myth, then one would believe its events to have occurred, could set out to find evidence of it in the external world, and create this evidence as needed. This he insinuates, was exactly what the mediaeval crusaders did when they found the sepulchre of Christ: their belief was founded in a mythical narrative, the New Testament, and they then made the external world conform to that conviction. Did this mean that the sepulchre of Christ was an "illusion" ? If one believes symbols to be nothing more than that, then yes, it was. But if one believes them to be true in their signification, then it was not. It was not insofar as men made it real according as they had faith in the creative power of the imagination and their feelings; it was not insofar as man's querer or desire (redemption and everlasting life) took precedence in the governance of life. In the same way, Unamuno was fully aware that Don Quijote was not real in the sense of existent in the external world ; but he was suggesting that, as myth, he becomes real whenever a reader takes his story as exemplary model for existence. This was what Don Miguel ultimately</page><page sequence="21">67 wanted, to awaken his readers to a possible mythical basis in such texts, and thereby discover both the symbolic signification communicated in them, and the underlying factor of imagination upon which they depended. If this could be done, then the works would become, as he so often said, "real and true," and the world of symbolic imagination, with its emphasis upon the urge of man to create a better future, would become an operative fact. The analysis of death and God in Unamuno has revealed a doctrine of creative imagination in which individual feeling expands into symbolical archetypes whose ultimate function is to give a subjectively concrete and objectively universal meaning to history. In the remaining paragraphs, it would be appropriate to suggest some implications of this theory for an understanding of both Unamuno's work in general, and his place in modern thought. As mentioned at the outset, previous commentary on death and God in Unamuno has approached the problem from an existential and/or theological point of view, and frequently become embroiled in such difficult-to-resolve issues as whether or not Don Miguel sincerely believed in God. Though much of the controversy which used to surround these questions has by now largely abated, the general consensus of opinion has been to suggest that, because he saw death as a definitive cessation of consciousness, and because he proposed a merely imaginary God, one has little choice but to regard him as an atheist. Without wishing to raise the spectre of renewed controversy over these issues however, it must be noted that all of this discussion was conducted without taking into account Unamuno's questioning of imagina tion, and his attempt to re-formulate the issue of fantasy in terms of feeling, symbols and myth. It therefore reached conclusions on the basis of the assumption that images are nothing more than unreal, that is, assuming the very question which Don Miguel was trying to transcend through his assertion that they are both unreal and real at the same time: unreal because imaginary and therefore originally existent in consciousness ; real because founded in feeling, expressive of meaning, and therefore capable of motivat ing acts. As soon as one takes this into account, it becomes clear that such issues as the cessation of consciousness at death or the reality of God are far more complex than has often been assumed, and that Unamuno may well have been correct in his ideas, though this cannot be proved definitively,54 and depends upon the legitimacy one accords to his implicit theory of symbolic imagination. That really is the issue, the validity of symbolism as an explanation of the operations of the imaginary, and it requires reference to others in the post-Romantic era who have also developed theories in that direction. Which brings us to a complex question underlying Unamuno's thought,</page><page sequence="22">68 the contemporary fascination with symbols and myth. Beginning with Romanticism, interest in imagination grew steadily in European thought until eventually establishing itself as one of the predominant tendencies of the first half of the twentieth century. In the last few decades, this attraction for "the poetic side of man" has shifted radically, yet the fact that writers as prominent as Frazer, Freud, Jung, Cassirer, Eliade, Bachelard, and many others all gave it a central place in their works attests to its importance in the period. Without meaning to simplify a complex growth of ideas, it could be said that a key factor in this development was an ever wider acceptance of the theory of the symbol. By elaborating the idealistic notion of imagination as mediator between perception (the concrete) and conceptualization (the abstract), these thinkers came to see images in their own right as "concrete universals," indirect expressions of personal and collective meanings. This shifted the focus of discussion away from the mimetic theory, with its devaluation of the imaginary, and tended to suggest that the world of imagination contains a certain validity which only needs interpretation or translation into the language of universals to be shown. At the same time, the idea of symbolism remains essentially rationalistic, and this permitted both a systematic inquiry into the domain of the imaginary, and a series of hermeneutic methods through which to explain its sometimes strange, irrational forms in rational terms. What followed is of course well known: psychiatry, with its extension into Jung's theory of the collective uncon scious and archetypes; the many modern studies of myth; and even the highly suggestive works of individual thinkers with their own systems of inquiry such as that of Bachelard with his reference to the four elements. Unamuno, I would say, participates fully in this trend, particularly that side of it represented by its more "poetic" or creation-oriented spokesmen such as Jung, Bachelard, the above-mentioned Gilbert Durand, and even, one might suggest, the surrealists. It would be highly instructive to conduct a close comparison between Don Miguel and such writers because they could no doubt help to clarify what are often disorganized statements on his part. There would remain, however, a basic difference which will always separate Unamuno from modern symbology, his insistence upon living his symbols rather than abstracting from them. Because of this, Don Miguel did not develop a system of interpretation, contributed minimally to the theory of archetypes as a whole, and remained always anchored in the concretely lived symbols of Spanish history. Symbolic imagination was a way of life for Unamuno, not a field of study ; he was moving toward a theory of it, but believed that reflection on it would undermine it as symbol and therefore destroy its essential nature, which was to be felt and imagined by conscious ness. This at times makes him somewhat elementary in his ideas, still too connected to ethnic theories of the nineteenth century, and still too preoc</page><page sequence="23">69 cupied with the old idea of the unreality of images, to have carried his sense of their reality into a serenely organized analysis of symbolism. On the other hand, this very excess of passion led him to live the issue of symbolism and myth so intensely that the full ontological implications of the question can be seen very clearly in his work. Can one who apprehends a symbol as symbol ever attribute such reality to it that it ceases being taken as representative and comes to be felt as directly factual? Can one who knows a myth for what it is ever sense it as literal history? Don Miguel was unable to overcome this, perhaps the central, dilemma of his work ; and this inability suggests that the question of the reality of myth is unresolvable in a modern context. Rational man must take imagination as real only in a symbolic manner, and this implies a hermeneutics which Unamuno does not give us yet which must be present if this same man is to become aware of the "truths" of fantasy. Unamuno was trapped in an impasse which makes him too rationalistic for those who believe their symbols literally, and too passionate for those who see them for what they are. Apart from this, there is one large area where the question of symbols and myth deserves close attention in Unamuno, his theory and practice of literature. Don Miguel's statements on literature have become well known over the years, yet rarely have they ever been analyzed in the context of symbolic imagination. In fact, however, his turn to death and God during his crisis in 1897 produced a mythopoetical concept of the literary which led him to question many basic aspects of literary theory, and at the same time to develop literary texts in accordance with his new ideas. Through his under standing of imagination as inventor of exemplary models of existence, literature took on an ontological role in the creation of reality. This ontology of literature needs to be studied, and, anticipating the direction such investi gation would take, I suggest that it would lead in the same direction as does Heidegger for example, when he says that "die Kunst in ihrem Wesen ein Ursprung und nicht anderes ist: eine ausgezeichnete Weise wie Wahrheit seiend und d. h. geschichtlich wird."55 In other words, it would be an ontology of literature whose central focus would lie in literature as origin and as historical revelation of reality. Then there is the question of the form of literature, Unamuno's move ment toward mythical narrative, a development which foreshadows the appearance of myth in much modern literature. Many celebrated debates which have surrounded Don Miguel's ideas on the literary - the autonomous character, realism, "viviparous" composition, etc. - could be clarified through a study of myth as the governing factor in the elaboration of works of art. To take on example: the apparent lack of verisimilitude which has so often been a source of irritation among commentators of Unamuno's novels, can be partly explained by the fact that his concept of the literary real was</page><page sequence="24">70 intertextual in its origins, not realistic, and used as its foundation previous myths which he was consciously reworking. This shift in the concept of verisimilitude is central to contemporary literature, and one of its earliest appearances can be found in Unamuno. Of course, the full ramifications of these questions cannot be dealt with here. Having established the basic points about symbolism, however, we are now in a position to begin such an enterprise, and hope to do so in the proximate future. The Ohio State University NOTES References to Unamuno are from the Obras completas, ed. Manuel Garc?a Blanco, 9 vols. (Madrid: Escelicer, 1966-1972). Volume and page number will be included in parentheses following the quotations. 2 E.

Vald?s, Death in the Literature of Unamuno (Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1964). 5 The typical reaction of the theologian to Unamuno's God can be seen in Joan Many?: "Ateo es todo aquel que niega la existencia real de Dios. Ahora bien ; la existencia real de Dios, lo mismo la niega el que lo hace franca y expresamente que el que no la admite m?s que como producto de nuestra ficci?n mental. Dios, el Dios de la religi?n, o es una realidad extramental o es la nada divina. Ergo ..."La teolog?a de Unamuno (Barcelona: Vergara, i960), pp. 78-79. For a review of the various long-standing debates surrounding Unamuno's theology, see Allen Lacy, Miguel de Unamuno: The Rhetoric of Existence (The Hague: Mouton and Co., 1967), pp. 240-84. 6 From all of this, it follows that the present study should in no way be conceived as a theological or religious discussion. 7 Don Miguel's statements are of course celebrated. A few typical examples follow. In "Sobre la lectura e interpretaci?n del 'Quijote' " (1905), he writes: "A nadie se le ocurrir? sostener en serio, no siendo acaso a m?, que Don Quijote existi? real y verdaderamente e hizo todo lo que de ?l nos cuenta Cervantes, como la casi totalidad de los cristianos creen que el Cristo existi? e hizo y dijo lo que de ?l nos cuentan los Evangelios ; pero puede y debe sostenerse que Don Quijote existi? y sigue existiendo, vivi? y sigue viviendo con una existencia y una vida acaso m?s intensas y m?s eficaces que si hubiera existido y vivido al modo vulgar y corriente" (1,1230). There is of course the celebrated case of Niebla (1914) where the fictional character Augusto P?rez tells the author that he is real and that the latter is merely a pretext for the character's appearance (11, 666). And in the epilogue of San Manuel Bueno, m?rtir (1933), Unamuno says: "De la realidad de este San Manuel Bueno, m?rtir, tal como me le ha revelado su discipula e hija espiritual Angela Carballino, de esta realidad no se me occure dudar. Creo en ella m?s que cre?a el mismo santo; creo en ella m?s que creo en mi propia realidad" (11, 1153). 8 Both of these interpretations were first proposed in Juli?n Mar?as, Miguel de Unamuno (Madrid: Espasa-Calpe, 1943). The notion of human insubstantiality can be found in the</page><page sequence="25">71 explanation of Niebla, pp. 101-102. The Ortegan idea of life as a biography or novel is developed on pp. 29-33 ? My point is not to deny these ideas, both of which seem correct, but to develop another aspect of the whole problem. 9 A more detailed reference to theories of imagination will be made further on. 10.

This latter requires one to turn away from the imaginary object or event, and consider instead its manner of apprehension: "Ainsi l'image comme image n'est descriptible que par un acte de second degr? par lequel le regard se d?tourne de l'objet pour se diriger sur la fa?on dont cet objet est donn?." L'Imaginaire: Psychologie ph?nom?nologique de imagination (Paris: Gallimard, 1940), p. 13. It is this reflection which Unamuno does not explicitly perform in his texts. 15 Actually, Marias sees very clearly that the moment of anguish springs from imagination, but he does not consider this important, and looks through it to death itself. This is evident on p. 203 of his study, op. cit. 16 In the Diario ?ntimo for example, Don Miguel says: "La imaginaci?n acude a enga?arnos y como nos representamos el mundo continuando existiendo despu?s de nuestra muerte, no pensamos que ese mundo que nos representamos sobrevivi?ndonos no pasa de ser una representaci?n que morir? con nosotros ..." (vm, 848). Then, a few lines later, he says: "Si es la nada el mundo que te imaginas sobrevivi?ndote, no pasa de ser una imaginaci?n tuya que contigo morir?" (ibid.). Both of these statements show his awareness of the unreality of the image of death. 17 In Del sentimiento tr?gico de la vida (1913), Unamuno makes this clear: "Qued?monos ahora en esta vehemente sospecha de que el ansia de no morir, el hambre de inmortalidad personal, el conato con que tendemos a persistir indefinidamente en nuestro ser propio y que es, seg?n el tr?gico jud?o [Spinoza], nuestra misma esencia, eso es la base afectiva de todo conocer y el ?ntimo punto de partida personal de toda filosof?a humana, ..."

To be sure, Una muno still places great stress upon feeling, unlike Husserl, and of course, he never develops anything like an epoch?. His position is similar however, in that the world is not drained of its factual reality (as it is, for example, in idealism), while at the same time, consciousness is made, as Neil Oxenhandler has said, "a precondition which makes possible the apprehension of the natural world." See "The Quest for Pure Consciousness in Husserl and Mallarm?," The Quest for Imagination: Essays in Twentieth Century Aesthetic Criticism, ed. O.B.

R.L. Brett also refers to the two interpreta tions of truth in his study of Coleridge, Fancy and Imagination, pp. 45-48. 27 The allusion here is to chapter two of Del sentimiento tr?gico de la vida, where Unamuno had proposed an epistemology based upon the priority of consciousness as constructor of reality. 28 This is not the same as Sartre's celebrated description of the image as " 'intuitif-absent' ; donn? absent ? l'intuition," L'Imaginaire, p. 33. For Unamuno, the emphasis is always on the presence of God, whereas for Sartre, it is always on the absence of the real, as his next sentence demonstrates: "En ce sens, on peut dire que l'image enveloppe un certain n?ant." At bottom, Sartre constructs simply another version of mimesis, and this makes him very distant from any creative theory of imagination. 29 In "La Atl?ntida" (1924), Unamuno says: "Platon invent? mejor que descubri?, cre? la Atl?ntida. Porque se dice inventar de algo que no exist?a antes ; as?, la invenci?n de la p?lvora, la invenci?n de la imprenta" (1, 559). 30 Here would be an essential difference with a neo-platonic view, which would see God as working through consciousness. Unamuno is so ambiguous however, that he frequently suggests such an idea: "El poder de crear un Dios a nuestra imagen y semejanza, de personalizar el Universo, no significa otra cosa sino que llevamos a Dios dentro, como sustancia de lo que esperamos, y que Dios nos est? de continuo creando a su imagen y semejanza" (vu, 223). For a brief but lucid discussion of the complex question of neo platonism in Unamuno, see Hugo W. Cowes, "Problema metodol?gico en un texto l?rico de Miguel de Unamuno," Filolog?a, vu (1961), 48-49 and . 14. 3 The term "transfigures" is from Gilbert Durand, L'Imagination symbolique, ze ed. (Paris: P.U.F., 1968), p. 8, where it is used to stress the transformation of the image by its underlying meaning. 32 The passage reads: "La soberbia peor, la velada, la recojida, la encerrada, es la que me lleva a aceptar todo lo exterior, a cumplir todo lo que el pueblo fiel cumple, a acatar su credo, a rezarlo con ?l, pero reserv?ndome el entenderlo de un modo que creo m?s elevado, tom?n dolo como s?mbolo, busc?ndole en la alta m?stica m?s profunda significaci?n. A?n no tengo la ley y quiero el esp?ritu" (vm, 806). 33 The term "symbol" means etymologically "thrown together." 34 Durand, pp. 5-15. The best overall discussion of the distinctions between various significa tion words is that of Roland Barthes, "El?ments de s?miologie," Communications, 4 (1964), 103-05. 35 "Epiphany" is a word frequently applied to the capacity of the symbol to make the mysterious appear. See Durand, p. 9. 36 Immanuel Kant, Kritik der Urteilskraft und Schriften zur Naturphilosophie, Werke in Sechs Banden, ed.

Imagination on the other hand, was basically ethical in its aspiration to improve upon the present, and in its capacity (shown in the process of imagining God) to make the person feel compassion for the other. This is why Don Miguel often spoke of imagination as the key to tolerance in society as well as fundamental in all great artists: " ?De d?nde sino de falta de imaginaci?n proviene la intolerancia? El intolerante lo es, no porque se imagine con gran vigor sus propias creencias, no porque se las imagine con tanto relieve que excluya las dem?s, sino por ser incapaz de ponerse en situaci?n de los otros y ver las cosas como ellos las ver?an. El poderoso dramaturgo siente con igual fuerza las situaciones m?s opuestas ; el autor de un di?logo pol?mico ahora opina esto y luego lo contrario. Los m?s grandes imaginativos son los que han sabido ver el fondo de verdad que hay en las m?s opuestas ideas. Los dogm?ticos lo son por pobreza imaginativa" ("La imaginaci?n en Cochabamba," ni, 526). 47 This of course was not the only myth considered by Unamuno, for we readily recall the Cain-Abel structure, that of Rachel, and the whole problem of Unamuno's "other," the "legendary" self which was ultimately his real one. None of these are ever developed however, into a systematic typology of archetypes. Among the very few critics who have begun to work on the archetypes of Unamuno, see Mario J. Vald?s, "Archetype and Re-creation: A Comparative Study of William Blake and Miguel de Unamuno," University of Toronto Quarterly, xl (1970), 58-72; and "Metaphysics and the Novel in Unamuno's Last Decade: 1926-1936, "Hispan?fila, xliv (1972), 33-44. Paul Hie, Unamuno, An Existential View of Self and Society (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1967) also has interesting analyses of specific myths in Unamuno. 48 One of the most ambiguous directions of Unamuno's thought was his insistence upon the mythical nature of literary realism, i.e., literature which seemed to use a directly referential language. The entire question of realism in Unamuno remains to be studied thoroughly. 49 Ever since Kant established the priority of the symbol over reason, an important line of thought has always insisted that no symbol can be exhausted in its interpretation, and that every symbol is therefore capable of connoting multiple, even contradictory, meanings, all of which are equally valid. In all cases, however, interpretation is still required and clarification of meaning does result. 50 Mircea Eliade, Myth and Reality, trans. Willard R. Trask (New York: Harper and Row, 196}), p. 6. 51 ibidem. 52 A close analysis of the prologue to the Tres novelas ejemplares would show that Unamuno was suggesting literary characters as real because symbolic: "Pues bien, un hombre, y un hombre real, que quiere ser o que quiera no ser, es un s?mbolo, y un s?mbolo puede hacerse hombre" (11, 974). The question then is for the reader to feel the exemplarity of this, a problem with which Unamuno fought exasperatedly because few, apparently, could. See his remarks on the readers "que leen para no enterarse o para matar el tiempo," in the same prologue, pp. 976-77. 53 O.C., m, 51-59. 54 In the end, the questions of death and God are being deliberately left open by Unamuno: they are mysteries for which no definitive answer is possible. At the same time, one could</page><page sequence="28">74 argue that if a society accepts its symbols as real, then they are in fact real, and might even cause phenomena to occur in the world, thereby confirming their reality. This, at least, would be the ultimate conclusion implicit in Unamuno. Moreover, one could also argue that any doubts Don Miguel had about God stemmed from the lack of collective support he received for his position: as he himself said, myth is collective and needs the general faith of society to keep it alive. 55 Martin Heidegger, "Der Ursprung des Kunstwerkes," Holzwege (Frankfurt: Vittorio Klos termann, 1950), p. 65.</page></plain_text>
