<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ulster Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 56, 1993 A WOODEN FIGURE FOUND AT LETTERS H EN DON Y, COUNTY LONDONDERRY by B.B. WILLIAMS Department of the Environment (N.?.), Environment Service A wooden figure found in a bog is considered to he a religious statue of the Penal period. In 1978 during a period of summer drought, two school boys playing by a marshy pool near their homes found a wooden statue of a woman embedded in peat. The figure was taken to one of their homes where it was viewed as a curiosity and used as a plaything. Despite exposure to the atmosphere, painting and an accident which caused some damage, it had survived in remarkably good condition when it came to my notice in 1988. LOCATION The site of the discovery is in Lettershendony townland County Londonderry (Irish Grid map sheet 37, grid reference C5034 1439; altitude 200 ft + O.D.). The figure was buried on level ground covered with blanket bog, some 80 m. N of the summit of a small hill. This lies in the upper reaches of the Muff River 8 km upstream from Lough Foyle. According to the Ordnance Survey Memoirs compiled in the 1830s there were formerly two archaeological sites in the townland which are now unlocated. A 'dolmen' was situated 1 ?/4 miles SW of Eden Reagh Beg and an earthen rath was set in a boggy area. The name Lettershendony, Leitir-Sean-Domhnaig, meaning 'the wet hill slope of the old church' (Munn 1925,112-13), gives some indication of an ecclesiastical association. Ann Hamlin has kindly provided the following additional information on the ecclesiastical association of the area. The Ordnance Survey records a church site in the neighbouring townland of Killennan, and the site of Seinlis Fort in this townland has led to the suggestion that one of the seven church (demnach) sites attributed to St Patrick in the Faughan area, Domnach Seinliss, was hereabouts (Stokes 1887,155; Munn 1925, 111-12; Lacy 1979). A large, plain ringless cross which once stood in adjacent Oghill townland now stands in the Catholic graveyard in Mullaboy (Preliminary Survey 1940,198 and pi. 46). DESCRIPTION The figure is carved in the round and represents a seated woman wearing a full-length mantle, holding an object on her knees (Pis I?VIII; Pis I-IV show the figure in its original state and V-VIII after conservation). It is carved from a single piece of wood identified as elm, ulmus, by MarieNeill, and is 0.80m high, 0.30m wide at the shoulders and 0.27m thick. The figure is portrayed with a high protruding forehead, and simple eyes and nose representing facial details. The pronounced breasts clearly establish that the figure is female. The shoulders, arms and elbows are hinted beneath the mantle, while the hands are simply carved holding a sub-rectangular object, perhaps a basket, on the lap. Chisel marks are still visible, particularly on the front of the figure, while the smooth surface of the mantle at the back has been carefully created with a rasp; diagonal score lines are clearly visible (PI. II). Traces of six coloured paints on the figure were analysed by John McCrae and found to be modern domestic paints. When the object was first reported by the mother of one of the finders, Sheila Kearney, no mention was made of any other figure, but at a later interview she said thai the figure of a child had accompanied the female but that this was subsequently lost when it went to the other boy's home, Certainly the figure was damaged at the front, with modern gashes visible on the 'basket' and the right knee (PI. I). The figure has been restored and conserved by Malcolm Fry (DOENI), Before conservation the wood was extremely friable, overpaintcd and rotten towards the base. Significant portions required restoration in order to achieve full stabilisation. Using standard conservation laboratory techniques the overpainting was removed as far as possible, the wood was stabilised by impregnation with resin and badly damaged areas were restored using an epoxy putty (Pis V-VIII). DATING A sample of wood removed from the figure before conservation was submitted for radiocarbon dating (UB 3095) and provided a result of 173 ? 35 B.P. The calibrated age lies between 1650 and the present at 95% significance, with the highest probability between A.D. 1736 and A.D. 1807. DISCUSSION The recovery of a carved wooden figure in County Londonderry is a rare and welcome occurrence. There can be little doubt that this is a religious statue, carved in the round, perhaps as a processional figure rather than designed for a niche. While the colours which were analysed were found to be modern household paints, it seems certain from the rather sketchy facial details that 148</page><page sequence="2">the figure originally had a polychrome finish. The radiocarbon date firmly assigns the Lettershendony figure to a relatively late date, most probably between 1736 and 1807. It seems likely that the statue was placed in the bog for safekeeping during the 'Penal' era when Roman Catholic worship was severely restricted, between 1691 and 1793. Its style has been described as late medieval on the basis of photographic examination by Catriona MacLeod and John Bradley (pers. comm.). The persistence of an old style is understandable in a country where Roman Catholic religious art and worship were forbidden. The Lettershendony figure shows no Continental European influence, evident elsewhere in medieval and post-medieval statues in Ireland (MacLeod 1947) but seems rather to represent a native Irish tradition. No comparable statues are known in Ireland, and there are no obvious parallels in the Penal crosses (Lucas 1954-5) or in decorated mass rocks and caves. The possibility for a much earlier date for the figure was considered before the radiocarbon date became available (Warner pers. comm. and Coles 1990,330). Attention was drawn to the similarity between the Lettershendony figure and the Romano-Celtic single mother goddess type found in Britain. This was considered and rejected on the grounds that the statue was rather too large for a domestic niche shrine. The full-length mantle over the head and continuing down over the shoulders and the facial details are not in a Celtic or Classical style (Webster pers. Comm.). The figure is now on display in Derry Museum. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The writer would like to thank Sheila Kearney who reported the find to Historic Monuments and Buildings staff of what is now the Environment Service. Conservation work was done by Malcolm Fry and the photographs were taken by Simon Burch and Anne Murray, to all of whom thanks are due. Thanks also go to John Bradley, Catriona MacLeod, Richard Warner and Graham Webster for helpful comments and observations. REFERENCES Coles, B. (1990).
