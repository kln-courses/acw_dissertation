(SP-344) Design and Application of Commercial Type Tires. J. A. Davisson, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. Basic tire design factors, performance properties, applica- tion requirements, and their interrelated effects are discussed to furnish general insight into commercial- vehicle tire engineering. The subject is covered compre- hensively to illustrate the numerous considerations and decisions affecting the design and use of commercial- vehicle tires. The information is presented primarily from the perspective of the tire engineer with the objective of providing a fundamental background for the vehicle designer and operator. 1969 SA E Transactions 690002. (SP-345) Looking in on Diesel Combustion. W. M. Scott, Ricardo &amp; Co. Engineers (1927) Ltd. High-speed cine photography has been used to study the combustion process in a variety of diesel chambers. These chambers, used in engines of 12-1200 cu in. swept volume per cylinder, differ considerably in the level of air utilization achieved within the cylinder at acceptable exhaust color or temperature. These differences are attributed to the method of fuel/air mixing employed and the influence of fuel injection, air motion, and fuel quality are discussed. It is concluded that while there is an obvious correlation between air utilization and the level of air swirl or turbulence employed, from other points of view high gas velocities are undesirable. Further development will therefore depend largely on the evolution of the fuel injection equipment toward the achievement of good mixing and combustion control with reduced gas veloc- ities.

Campbell, Fisher Body Div., GMC. New side safety structural changes have been developed for some 1969 model General Motors cars. The research covered two years, during which time crash situations were simulated and analyzed, field data were studied, and various approaches to side protection were investigated. A low-weight, high-strength steel beam was developed and positioned horizontally in the door. In addition, the supporting body structures were reinforced. The resultant structure reduced penetration into the passenger compar- tment during side collision tests by causing a deflecting action between the two cars, and by preventing ride-over of the striking vehicle into the struck car. Fisher Body has recently developed the basis for a static laboratory technique of testing that measures the strength of side impact structure in such a way as to allow tryouts of designs early in the program. Because of the number of GM cars designed each year, this will curtail the extensive time and cost factors previously involved in dynamic testing. 690004. Ford "S" Frame. N. Baraços and A. Rhodes, Ford Motor Co. For the 1969 Ford/Mercury vehicles, the front rails of the frame consist of heavy box members, which are shaped to curve outward in the shape of an S for greater energy absorption during impact. In addition, the frame has been lengthened to increase the effective front end collapse distance. The effect of these changes is to increase the initial vehicle deceleration values and to reduce the deceleration values during the latter phases of the collision. As borne out by test results and crash theory, the reduction of deceleration values during the latter phases of the collision results in lower restraint system loads. The safety testing of the new concept consisted mainly of front impact barrier crashes. However, during the earlier stages, a series of vehicle-to-vehicle head-on collisions were conducted to determine its performance within this environment. Seat belt load test values were verified by utilizing the Cornell computer program in conjunction with the seat belt anchor deceleration test values, recorded at the frame B pillar. 1969 SA E Transactions 690005. The Crash Survival Space. E. Franchini, Chief Structure Dept., Auto Avio Res. Labs., FIAT. Occupant's protection requires two design considerations: (1) reduction of decelerations on the occupant (restrained by a belt) by intentional deformabili ty of the structure; (2) limitation of passenger's compartment deformation to avoid passenger crushing. It is thought that the second trend should have basic importance. It is necessary to ensure a minimum space called "survival space." This is also necessary in the event of severe crashes. A survey is made of structure deformations due to longitudinal, transversal and vertical loads dynamically or statically applied on truck's cabs and car passenger's compartments. A high-power static test rig permitting the study of structure is described. Orientative values of the survival space are proposed for truck cabs and car passenger's compartments. 690006. Exhaust System Design - Art or Science? C. D. Shepherd, Arvin Industries, Inc. The basic problem in the design of automotive exhaust systems is being able to determine the sound level required, the frequencies which are most objectionable, and the best and most economical way to silence this noise. In addition, the recent proliferation of car models and/or engine combinations has enlarged the problems of design by the cause-and-effect approach. In order to reduce this lead time certain methods of instrumentation and computerization have been imple- mented by exhaust system design and development engineers. These methods are described briefly, as well as certain novel silencing devices that have been utilized to meet individual manufacturers requirements. Exhaust system designers have long been concerned with the corrosive elements in exhaust gases formed in the 67</page><page sequence="3">690007-690014 68 combustion process. The significant advances in developing materials that reduce corrosion are also discussed. 690007. Air Cleaner Design - Present and Future. Peter E. Sherburn, Canadian Filters Ltd. Present general design criteria for the broad range of product collectively described as automotive induction air cleaners are reviewed here. The many types of current air cleaner designs are categorized and the relative advantages of particular designs are briefly discussed. The application of basic acoustic and filtration technology to the design of air cleaner product is examined. Finally a few of the many possible trends in future air cleaner design and performance are highlighted. 690008. Engine Bearing Design: 1969. A. O. DeHart, General Motors Res. Labs.; and D. H. Harwick, Delco Moraine Div., GMC. Design considerations are given for automotive engine bearings based on the present state of knowledge. It is written from the viewpoint of what an engineer should know to develop successful bearings for modern automotive engines. It is not intended to give the details of the design procedures. The effects of engine operating conditions are considered and the role of analytical procedures are discussed. The many factors, including lubrication, geometry, and materials, over which the designer has control are discussed with respect to how these factors can affect bearing performance. Procedures are outlined for the engineer to use in checking the validity of the design work. 1969 SA E Transactions 690009. Stamping AZDEL - A Reinforced Thermoplastic Sheet. P. H. Hofer and A. R. Tavarozzi, Union Carbide Corp.; and G. J. Wagerson, PPG Industries, Inc. The characteristics of Azdel, a glass fiber reinforced thermoplastic sheet especially adaptable to auto and truck body structures is described. This lightweight, tough, dent-resistant, and corrosion-resistant material is successfully formed by methods simple to, but more economical than, metal stamping processes. The paper describes the various forming methods and explains how present equipment for metal stamping can be used in plastic forming. 690010. Vibrin-Mat Sheet Molding Compound - A New Generation of Fiberglass Reinforced Polyesters. James P. Walton, Marco ChemicaliDiv., W. R. Grace and Co. New low shrinkage glass fiber-polyester composites in sheet form have been developed to compete with steel and die castings in many automotive applications. These new molding materials overcome previous difficulties encountered with glass reinforced polyester resin com- pounds. A smooth, fiber pattern free surface is obtained "out of mold," thus eliminating much of the costly sanding and surface preparation previously required in this process. A more automated molding process is also possible using the compression or injection molding process. The compounds are prepared by continuous method in sheet form for ease in production handling and improved mechanical properties. Preparation, manu- facture, and cost considerations with typical applications are presented. 690011. Hybrid Integrated Circuits in Vehicular Applications. Douglas W. Taylor, Motorola Semiconductor Products Inc. In this paper hybrid integrated circuits are defined by comparing them with monolithic (single chip) integrated circuits and conventional discrete component circuits. Some of the currently popular hybrid integrated circuit techniques are reviewed. The utility of hybrid integrated circuils for automotive applications is discussed. This leads to consideration of some of the basic problems in applying electronics to automobiles. 1969 SA E Transactions 690012. The ABC's of Monolithic Integrated Circuits. M. V. Hoover, RCA Electronic Components. Advances in integrated-circuit technology are making practicalinew orders of magnitude in equipvent complex- ity, performance, and reliability. This paper describes design principles, fabrication techniques, and application considerations for monolithic integrated circuits, in which both active and passive components are formed upon or within a single semiconductor substrate. 1969 SA E Transactions 690013. Discrete Assemblies versus Thick Film IC's. Eldon L. Hoffman, Semiconductor Div., The Bendix Corp. With the increasing emphasis on the use of integrated circuils in automobiles, the automotive engineer will be under greater and greater pressure to understand, design around, and use unfamilar integrated circuit technologies. This article discusses one of the integrated circuit technologies, thick film. Thick film manufacturing processes are compared to discrete component assembly manufacturing processes. The comparative economics is also discussed. This cost of use comparison is perhaps the most important topic because, if size and performance are equal, cost will be the deciding factor. 690014. Evaluating Effects of Fuel Factors on Stabilized Exhaust Emission Levels. C. A. Hall, A. E. Felt and W. J. Brown, Research Laboratories, Ethyl Corp. Single-cylinder engine studies show that the severity of the test cycle used for deposit accumulation markedly affects the level of exhaust emissions obtained with stabilized</page><page sequence="4">690015-690017 combustion chamber deposits. These studies also show that the relative stabilized emission levels with nonleaded and leaded fuels vary significantly with the aromatic content of the base fuel. An extensive evaluation in three groups of passenger cars operated by their owners in normal service showed no significant difference between the stabilized emission levels obtained with commercial nonleaded and leaded fuels. A dynamometer engine test procedure has been developed that simulates short-trip, city-type operation. The accelerated cooldown procedure allows for rapid accumulation of test mileage. Using this dynamometer procedure, the stabilized deposit emission levels of a commercial leaded fuel and a prototype nonleaded fuel are compared. 1969 SA E Transactions 690015. Effects of Tetraethyl Lead Concentration on Exhaust Emissions in Customer-Type Vehicle Operation. J. C. Gagliardi, Car Systems Re- search, Ford Motor Co.; and F. E. Ghannam, Applied Research, Ford Motor Co. Effects of various concentrations of tetraethyl lead on exhaust emissions were investigated. Eight Ford Galaxies equipped with production non-exhaust emission equipped 289 cu in., 2-V engines were operated in customer service for 18,000 miles in the Detroit area. Four fuel blends were used in mileage accumulation - Indolene Clear (a full boiling range nonlead gasoline), Indolene 5 (Indolene Clear &amp; 0.5 ml TEL/gal in a motor mix blend); Indolene 15 (Indolene Clear &amp; 1.5 ml TEL/gal in a motor mix blend), and Indolene 30 (Indolene Clear &amp; 3.0 ml TEL/gal in a motor mix blend). All engines were operated on the same petroleum base engine lubricant. Exhaust emissions were monitored at approximately 3000-mile intervals using the California Motor Vehicle Pollution Control Board 7-mode procedure. Additional 7-mode tests were obtained on each engine after combus- tion-chamber deposits were removed at the completion of the mileage accumulation phase. The increase in exhaust hydrocarbon emissions of vehicle operation on the leaded fuels was substantially higher than the hydrocarbon increase of vehicles operated on Indolene Clear. At the 12,000-mile point, for example, the average hydrocarbon increase for the leaded fuels was approximately 100 ppm as Hexane while the hydrocarbon increase on Indolene Clear was negligible. No deleterious effect, due to fuel used, was observed on any engine component. 690016. Effects of Tetraethyl Lead on Catalyst Life and Efficiency in Customer-Type Vehicle Operation. E. E. Weaver, Powertrain Systems Research, Ford Motor Co. Effects of four levels of tetraethyl lead on the efficiency and life of a commercially available hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide catalyst were investigated. The four fuels used in mileage accumulation were the base Indolene with no added lead and blends containing respectively 0.5, 1.5, and 3.0 ml TEL per gal. The vehicles were eight Fords equipped with 289-cu in. non-emission controlled 2-V engines unmodified, except for a lean carburetor and the catalytic exhaust system. The eight vehicles were paired off and each pair operated on one of the four fuel blends. In each pair, a radial-flow converter, which required no supplemental air, was located under the front seat in one vehicle and near the rear axle in the other vehicle. Exhaust emissions were monitored at approximately 3000-mile intervals during accumulation of 18,000 miles in customer type service. TEL in the fuel adversely affected the rate of warmup, the ability of the catalyst to remove hydrocarbons from the exhaust and accentuated the differences in the performance between front and rear converters as mileage was accumulated. On nonleaded fuel, the catalyst performed well in preferentially removing olefins and aromatic hydrocarbons to yield an exhaust of very low reactivity, until problems were encountered with losses of catalyst. The catalyst removed CO, aliphatic aldehydes, and acetylenes equally well on leaded or nonleaded fuel. 1969 SA E Transactions 690017. Effect of Combustion Chamber Deposits and Driving Conditions on Vehicle Exhaust Emissions. Alden J. Pahnke and James F. Conte, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. Two consumer-type vehicle tests to determine the effect of leaded and unleaded gasoline on exhaust emissions have been completed. One test involved 122 cars without exhaust control systems and the other, 36 cars with exhaust control systems. In both tests, hydrocarbon exhaust emissions of the leaded and unleaded cars increased during the initial period of mileage accumulation and then leveled out as equilibrium was reached. Average hydrocarbon emission levels of the leaded cars were higher than those of the unleaded cars with the difference or net lead effect amounting to seven per cent in both the 122-car and the 36-car tests. No significant differences in carbon monoxide or nitrogen oxide emission levels were observed. Photochemical reactivity levels were essentially the same for the leaded and unleaded car groups in the two tests. A limited study of the effect of mileage accumulation conditions on exhaust emission levels was carried out. Results obtained under rapid or accelerated mileage accumulation conditions did not correlate with consumer test results. The role of combustion-chamber deposits in in- creasing hydrocarbon exhaust emission levels during the initial period of operation of a vehicle has been consid- ered. Bulk volume of deposits appeared to be a better parameter than deposit weight for relating hydrocarbon exhaust emissions and deposit properties. 1969 SA E Transactions 69</page><page sequence="5">690018-690023 70 690018. Inlet Manifold Water Injection for Control of Nitrogen Oxides - Theory and Experiment. J. E. Nicholls, I. A. El-Messiri and H. K. Newhall, Department of Mechanical Engrg., University of Wisconsin. Parallel theoretical and experimental studies of the influence of inlet manifold water injection on nitric oxide emission from spark-ignition engines have been per- formed. Theoretical analysis based on chemical equilibrium calculations indicates that the reduction of combustion temperature due to water injection at rates comparable to the engine fuel consumption rate is sufficient to yield significant reductions in nitric oxide emissions. Theoretical results further show that water injection may be accompanied by increased volumetric efficiency due to evaporative cooling of the inlet charge during induction. Experimental results obtained through modification of a CFR test engine confirm the predicted effectiveness of water injection on nitric oxide control. For a water injection rate 1 1/4 times the engine fuel consumption rate, nitric oxide reductions of over 90% were achieved. While no change was observed in volumetric efficiency with water injection, modest improvements in bmep and bsfc were observed. 1969 SA E Transactions 690019. Reduction of Nitrogen Oxides in Automobile Exhaust. Jack D. Benson, General Motors Res. Labs. Although the control of nitrogen oxides from automobile exhaust has not been resolved, several methods have been investigated to determine how much control is possible and what penalties are involved. By selectively adjusting the spark timing, carburetion, and exhaust recirculation rate on one test car, a control system was developed which reduced nitrogen oxides while maintaining hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide control at current (1968) Federal levels. However, some loss in fuel economy was incurred, and driveability problems were observed. Application to other car models, deposit accumulation, durability, and performance under extreme weather conditions are all open questions at this time. 1969 SA E Transactions 690020. Investigation into the Formation and Modifica- tion of Emission Precursors. E. S. Starkman and H. E. Stewart, Thermal Systems Div., Univ. of California.; and V. A. Zvonow, Thermal Sys- tems Div., Univ. of California, and Lugansk Machine-Building Institute, USSR. An hydraulically actuated valve was used to sample directly the combustion chamber of a spark-ignition engine in order to determine the time history of gas composition. The cold wall was found to influence equally carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and nitric oxide formation, as it has been previously shown to influence unburned hydrocarbons. Results indicated that sample fraction should be at least 1% of cylinder content if the chemical analysis is to reflect conditions away from the wall reliably. There was evidence that large gradients in composition are created across the combustion chamber and these gradients persist throughout the expansion. Examination of engine operating variables, such as spark advance, compression ratio, mixture strength, and speed, provided more evidence of the role which chemical kinetics plays in determining the concentration of nitrogen oxides appearing in engine exhaust. 690022. Some Aspects of Designing Industrial Test Programs. J. D. Hromi, Ford Motor Co. To provide sound answers to specific problems, it is possible to design appropriate test programs using methods developed by mathematical statisticians. A simple factorial design, as applied to the study of green compressive strength of a foundry sand mix, is outlined and discussed in some detail. The efficiency with which conclusions are drawn from the test results is attributed to the fact that factorial and fractional factorial designs enable the test engineer to use every observation in making each conclusion. Furthermore, the same designs provide an opportunity for examining the behavior of one variable at more than one level of each of the other variables included in the test program. Some simple methods of numerical analysis are applied to test data preliminary to their interpretation. 690023. Measuring Effectiveness of a Continuing Education Course for Engineers Using Videotape and Telephone for Remote Instruction. John J. Herring, Jr., Taylor Forge Inc. The techniques used to conduct and evaluate a unique continuing education course for engineers are described. A course in "Statistical Design of Experiments" was taught using videotaped lectures, a conference telephone, and the Victor Electro- Writer. The course instructor of the University of Wisconsin, visited Cummins Engine Co. only once during the 16-week lecture series. All of his teaching was done from his office in Madison. At one point during the program he was called away from campus on business but managed to join the class by telephone from his motel room in Texas. This course was the fourth in a series which began in February 1966, all were taught by members of the faculty of the University of Wisconsin. Dr. Philip S. Myers, professor of Mechanical Engineering, coordinated activ- ities on campus. Fifty-four of Cummins' engineers completed the course at an average cost less than half that which would have been incurred had they traveled to attend regular classes. In addition, the course content was specifically designed to meet Cummins' needs and the examples and problems were related to the work being done by these engineers during their daily activities.</page><page sequence="6">690024-690032 690024. An Example of Experimental Design Methods. T. O. Wagner and J. W. Gorman, American Oil Co. The application of experimental design methods to practical engineering problems is illustrated by an example involving road tests to measure how elevation affects octane requirements of automobiles. The example describes steps involved in developing an efficient statistical design that fits technical requirements of the problem, and describes analysis of data and interpreta- tions of results. 1969 SA E Transactions 690025. Design Considerations for Deep Submersible Vehicles. Samuel Feldman, Deep Submergence Systems Project Office, Dept. of the Navy. The U. S. Navy is currently designing and developing a deep submergence search vehicle which will be capable of search, work, and exploration of the ocean floor to depths of 20,000 ft. This paper discusses the influence of mission require- ments and operational constraints on vehicle design. The effects on vehicle weight, endurance, and depth are examined against various design parameters, cush as pressure capsule configuration, material, buoyancy, power sources, and so forth. 690027. Coast Guard Role in Civil Submersible Safety. Charles B. Glass, United States Coast Guard. The Coast Guard has a primary duty to administer laws and promulgate and enforce regulations for the promotion of safety of life and property on the high seas and on waters subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. The rapid expansion of undersea activity indicates a need for government regulation without waiting for a disaster to provide the impetus. The expected Coast Guard relationship to civil submersible safety is discussed from the standpoint of legislation; preparation, promulgation and enforcement of regulations; duplication of efforts by other organizations; and avoidance of unnecessary interference with use of new developments and technical advancement. 690028. Research Submarines with Minimal Ocean Dis- turbance. S. Way, Westinghouse Electric Corp. In océanographie studies by use of powered submersible research vehicles, speed is usually of slight concern, but it may be quite important to avoid noise, agitation of the surrounding water, or stirring of the ocean bottom materials. For these reasons, propulsion by means of a system that derives its thrust by action upon a very large expanse of the surrounding sea is desirable. The electromagnetic propulsion system is eminently suited for such applica- tions. With secondary batteries of modern type, and use of a superconducting magnet, the performance, at the acceptable low speeds, of electromagnetically propelled research submarine vehicles is attractive from the range and efficiency standpoints, and gives the above mentioned advantages of silence and minimal disturbance. An example for a 15-ton submarine is given. Scaling relations are indicated to facilitate scale up or scale down from this size. Though the electromagnetic method is attractive as a quescent propulsion means, it poses certain other problems that must be dealt with in any future develop- ment program. 1969 SA E Transactions 690029. Underwater Navigation and Reconnaissance Trainer. Alan Herman, Physical Sciences Lab., Naval Training Device Center. In recent years the phenomenal growth in the number of research submersibles has given rise to the need for research into trainers for submersible pilots and scientific observers similar to those used by aviators in Link-type trainers. This paper presents the design approach being taken by the NAVTRADEVCEN in building a device which will be used as a research tool for future trainers. The system which includes a vehicle that moves in a tank of water containing bathymétrie models is described. Details of a sophisticated optical system which is used to scale the view realistically as seen through an underwater TV and an optical port are presented. How the vehicle is provided with 6 deg of freedom of motion and is navigated using simulated sonar guidance systems and other instrumentation standard on Alvin-type submer- sibles is discussed. 690031. The Variable-Geometry Power Turbine. Chris- tian J. Rahnke, Ford Motor Co. In gas turbine vehicular applications, a power turbine with a variable-position nozzle results in several operating advantages. These advantages, as well as the design considerations of a variable-nozzle power turbine are described. Test results are presented and discussed for two different variable-nozzle power turbine configurations. The first configuration consisted only of the nozzles and rotor while the second configuration included both the turbine stage and its associated ducting. Discussion: Elgin E. Flagg; General Electric Co.; Thomas P. Moffitt; NASA 1969 SA E Transactions 690032. The Power Turbine and Its Diffuser. Charles A. Amann and David W. Dawson, General Motors Res. Labs. In a free-shaft gas turbine engine the static efficiency is a more realistic figure of merit for the power turbine than the frequently used total efficiency. The influence on these two efficiencies of design work coefficient and flow coefficient is examined. The effect of an annular diffuser located behind the power turbine for partial recovery of the otherwise-unavailable kinetic energy is discussed, both at design and off-design operating conditions. Test results from power turbines and exhaust diff users serve to 71</page><page sequence="7">690034-690038 72 illustrate the application of some of the concepts considered. Discussion: Howard G.

The results of an investigation directed toward demon- stration of a fluid-cooled turbine for an advanced small gas turbine are presented. The primary objective was to advance and demonstrate high turbine inlet temperature technology utilizing a thermosiphon cooling system concept for a small gas turbine engine to the level that will provide a potential for doubling the specific horsepower relative to current small aircraft propulsion engines. 690035. Design and Test of a Small Turbine at 2500 F with Transpiration Cooled Blading. S. L. Mosko- witz and T. E. Schober, Curtiss- Wright Corp. With the increasing need for high-performance, small gas turbine engines in the 500-1000-hp class, there is a requirement for use of high turbine inlet temperature in the range of 2500 F. Engines designed at these temper- atures will supply more than twice the horsepower available in present day noncooled engines. Reliable operation of the turbine component at gas temperatures that exceed the melting temperature of the materials, however, requires selection and application of an efficient and practical blade cooling method. This paper presents the design of a transpiration aircooled, single-stage, high-work, axial-flow, small turbine suitable for 2500 F turbine inlet temperature and capable of driving an 8/1 pressure ratio 4 lb/sec compressor. The manufacturing techniques associated with incorporating transpiration cooling into the small blading and the electron beam welding of these blades to the disc to form an integrally welded rotor assembly are also discussed. The results of the experimental testing of cascade and full stage component of this small turbine design at gas temperatures to 2500 F are presented. 690036. Influence of Gas Turbine Cycle Parameters on Regenerator Geometry. Homer J. Wood and William A. Bass, III, PowerDynetics, Inc., dba H. J. Wood and Associates. Two nondimensional parameters are used to describe relative sizes of regenerative heat exchangers, regardless of type or surface characteristics. They are related to gas turbine cycle factors to demonstrate that, for fixed bsfc goals, heat exchanger matrix sizes are very sensitive to turbine inlet temperature, pressure ratio, and flow path efficiency. Methods for optimizing engine cycles to minimize the sizing factors are described. A general trend toward higher pressure ratios in future recuperative gas turbines is indicated.

Goss and Daryl J. Rinehart, Columbus Labs., Battelle Memorial Inst. A new approach is presented for analyzing the interrela- tionships among transportation technology, place, and people in major urban activity centers. Such a com- prehensive approach is necessary in order for trans- portation system designers to understand the importance of developing transportation concepts with design char- acteristics that are responsive to urban travel needs and compatible with existing or proposed land-use envi- ronments. In addition, examples of current transportation system deficiencies in downtown areas are presented to stimulate an awareness among system designers of the role of transportation in achieving a viable downtown area and the types of system characteristics that must be implemented to achieve this viability. 690038. Case Studies of Seven New Systems of Urban Transportation. Eugene T. Canty, Transporta- tion Res. Dept., General Motors Res. Labs.; and Albert J. Sobey, Transportation Technology Div., Sverdrup and Parcel and Associates. An Implementation Study of New Systems of Urban Transportation has been completed by GM Research Laboratories for the U. S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. This has included the study of improved methods for the design, analysis, and socio- economic evaluation of new systems of urban trans- portation by means of which comprehensive planning of transportation may be achieved, taking into account user needs, urban planning goals and overall social objectives. The study has also included the conduct of seven case studies, each of a selected new system concept in a particular urban transportation application. This paper describes the results of the seven case studies which apply a broad range of technology to some of the more urgent transportation requirements in certain America cities. Two of these systems (the rail pallet system and the automated highway), are automobile-oriented to complement evolutionary improvements in conventional freeway systems, three of the systems represent advances in motor coach public transit, and two of the systems (network cab and multimodal capsule) are for application in special areas and are designed to interface with both private and public modes of transportation. The study has enabled a number of conclusions to be drawn relative to the technical feasibility and cost of the several new system concepts, as well as the likely degree of their social acceptability. 1969 SA E Transactions</page><page sequence="8">690039-690045 690039. Telecar Baggage System - Design to Handle the Passenger Volumes of the 1970's. W. S. Pickrell, Docutel Corp. Major airports throughout the world are faced with serious problems in the handling of passengers and their baggage, problems which are certain to increase with the anticipated increase in passenger traffic. One solution to these problems is a total airport system which incorporates throughout high capacity, reliability, and installation flexibility to satisfy specific requirements. Called the telecar baggage system, it sorts a high volume of baggage by carrier, flight, and destination; allows dispersed and remote check-in and claim of baggage; and has the ability to select, remove, or redirect an individual bag. 690040. Busways - Rapid Transit for an Intermediate- Sized Metropolitan Area. Joseph C. Corradino, Simpson and Curtin, Transportation Engrs. As federal funds have become available for analyzing transportation problems confronting urban areas, more communities have explored rapid transit as a vital element in a transportation system. These efforts have led smaller areas, with projected 1980 populations of less than 2,000,000 people, to the conclusion that busways may be the answer to their traffic problems. A busways system consists of a network of buses which circulate through residential communities for local pickup, then speed over reserved trunk lines to the focal point of the community, which in most instances is the central business district. It can provide fast, comfortable service. The system can be established quicker than most other high performance rapid transit systems and at one-half to one-tenth the cost. Because of these capabilities, busways has become the rapid transit system of the future for intermediate-sized areas. Even in large metropolitan areas where other forms of rapid transit are programmed for the future, busways can serve as an interim relief measure alleviating com- muter congestion with a fast, convenient alternate to auto travel. 690041. Comparative Analysis of Public Transportation for Small and Medium Size Cities. Howard R. Ross and W. Robert Hamilton, Sverdrup and Parcel and Associates. A comparison of various land transportation systems, including rail rapid transit, automatically guided buses, manually controlled buses on private right-of-ways, conventional buses, and personal transit systems is made for small and medium sized cities. These systems are compared on the basis of cost of installation and operation as well as social factors. Some parametric cost data are presented for various parts of the overall transit systems as well as relative cost of each system for a range of patronage. 690042. Social and Economic Factors Affecting Current and Future Transportation Systems. K. Philip Rahbany, Texas A and M University. The readiness with which a transportation mode can be cashed-in (liquidity of transportation) is a critical aspect of demand for transportation and therefore the design of transportation systems. This factor as well as the use of transport vehicles for nontransport functions and ex- panded public sector participation in determining con- sumer preferences are significant influences on present and future transportation. 690043. Developments in Steam Powerplants for Auto- mobiles. Samuel S. Miner, Steam Automobile. Lower emission characteristics of external-combustion engines, compared to internal-combustion engines, have brought on renewed interest in the use of steam power in automobiles. The practical effect of the progress made for the steam automobile appears to be that actual operating efficiencies of automobile steam powerplants and internal-combustion powerplants are now relatively close together. In con- sequence, the principal factors affecting choice in a given application may well become such properties as relative pollutant emission and noise levels, torque-speed relation- ship, or multifuel capability. In short, certain char- acteristics of the steam powerplant may make its use preferable, in some cases, to the internal-combustion engine, which would otherwise be suitable. 690044.

Reciprocating and rotary Rankine cycle engines using steam and organic fluids are discussed. These theoretical engines are then compared to the present existing Otto cycle. The comparison considers size, torque, economy, emissions, response, maintenance, and reliability. Ad- vantages and disadvantages of the various power systems are discussed and problem areas are identified. 690045. Proposed Reciprocating Internal Combustion Engine with Constant Pressure Combustion in a Combustion Chamber Separated from Cylinders (Modified Brayton Cycle). Glenn B. Warren and John W. Bjerklie, Mechanical Technology Inc. A reciprocating engine with gas turbine type combustion at nearly constant pressure is being proposed for automotive application after an extensive design and computer analysis. It appears to have the expected advantages of 20-30% reduced fuel consumption and of almost complete elimination of undesirable exhaust elements leading to air pollution. It should operate well on a wide range of fuels without regard to octane or cetane number and, hence, would need to have no lead in the fuel. It should weigh little, if any, more per unit of maximum output in the supercharged condition, and it 73</page><page sequence="9">690046-690051 74 can be manufactured largely on the present tooling of the automotive industry. The overall engine envelope seems to present no problems for modern low profile motor cars. It should serve well in various numbers of cylinders and sizes throughout the present range of automotive requirements. A comparison of automotive emissions between engines via the "adjusted-to-stoichiometric" method is included. 690046. Development of Portable, Reciprocating Engine, Rankine Cycle Generating Sets. Sotiris S. Kitrilakis and Edward F. Doyle, Thermo Electron Corp. Three steam engine driven prototype portable generator sets ranging in power from 100 W (e) to 1500 W (e) are described. To a large extent, these sets have demonstrated the potential capability of the Rankine cycle for low noise, low exhaust emissions, high reliability, acceptable efficiency, and multi-fuel operation. Design criteria used in the development of these units and their general applicability to reciprocating Rankine cycle systems are discussed. Recent developments make this power cycle attractive for commercial applications in present sizes as well as in scaled-up versions. 690047. Application of Modern Heat Transfer and Fluid Flow Experience to the Design of Boilers for Automotive Steam Powerplants. A. P. Fraas, Oak Ridge National Lab. Developments in boilers and other types of heat-transfer equipment in recent years have improved our under- standing of heat-transfer and the fluid flow phenomena involved. These developments are reviewed, and their implications relative to the design of boilers for modern automotive steam powerplants are considered. A new approach to automotive boiler design, intended to exploit these new concepts, is suggested. This entails the use of a recirculating boiler with a regenerator, a combination that should reduce the size, weight, and cost of the boiler as well as increase the thermal efficiency of the powerplant. A design procedure is proposed. 1969 SA E Transactions 690049. Ultrasonic Measurement and Influence of Non- metallic Inclusions on Fatigue and Engineering Behavior of Medium- and High-Strength Steels. Raymond A. Cellitti and Clarence J. Carter, International Harvester Co. An automatic computerized ultrasonic cleanliness rating system for measuring nonmetallic inclusion content of semifinishhed materials such as steel billets is described and discussed with regard to its function and reliability. Correlative studies relating inclusion areas as measured by light microscopy and magnetic particle inspection were within reasonable agreement with inclusion areas assessed ultrasonically. To provide design engineers with material quality acceptance standards that are related to mechanical behavior, mechanical tests were performed on high strength (280 ksi ultimate) steel exemplifying various ultrasonic cleanliness levels. A significant impairment in ductility (% reduction of area) is encountered with increasing ultrasonic inclusion severity. Uniaxial fatigue under unidirectional and reversed loading conditions are markedly influenced in proportion to the ultrasonic signature number. Impact and fracture toughness parameters are sensitive to a lesser degree. Discussion: J. P. Sheehan; ITT Research Institute 1969 SA E Transactions 690050. Evaluating Component Fatigue Performance Under Programmed Random, and Programmed Constant Amplitude Loading. S. R. Swanson, Testing Res. Lab., MTS Systems Corp. Testing for the evaluation of fatigue performance of materials subjected to variable loading in service, it is generally conceded, must contain variable loading as well. Single-level fatigue testing just will not provide an accurate answer. Two methods of fatigue testing using variable amplitude have been advocated in the literature. The earlier method, developed by Gassner, involves the stratification of the service load spectrum into eight levels, from the maximum load to the minimum. The number of cycles at each level is developed from the load spectrum. The loads are then applied in a stepwise ascending- descending manner beginning with a mid-level. The second method involves the use of a clipped random process, whose intensity (rms) is varied throughout the test in a random stepwise manner, such that the final accumulation of loads is asymptotic to the desired load spectrum. These two methods are examined in detail in this paper. A test program, involving automotive stub axles was developed, in which as many factors as possible were kept common to both types of tests. It is hoped that the results are a fair assessment of the two methods. 690051. Holographic Nondestructive Testing in the Automotive Industry. R. M. Grant and G. M. Brown, GC Optronics, Inc. Holographic interferometry - a unique and versatile new method of nondestructive testing - is now available for industrial design and quality-control purposes. Coherent laser light is used in recording and reconstructing 3-dimensional images and interference fringe patterns. Holographic nondestructive testing can quickly, ac- curately, and reliably detect hidden flaws in tires, rubber-to-metal bonds, metal-to-metal bonds, and other objects of interest to automotive engineers responsible for design and testing. Through mild stressing (heat, pressure, creep, vacuum, vibration, and so forth) of the test object, well below its elastic limit, subsurface anomalies are manifested in the form of minute surface displacements. These displacements, as small as a few microinches, are easily apparent in holographic interferograms, clearly</page><page sequence="10">690052-690058 indicating the location, size, and shape of a variety of common anomalies. 1969 SA E Transactions 690052. Electrically Heated, Tempered Safety Glass Backlight. Russell G. Whittemore, PPG Indus- tries, Inc. A typical electrically heated, tempered backlight is described and its merits listed. Design criteria including line or stripe spacing, width, and location, together with bus construction and electrical reinforcement are dis- cussed. Defogging and deicing capabilities are reviewed. Variations in power output with ambient temperature are particularly noted. This new product appeared on some 1968 American automobiles as an option, and on additional 1969 models. It is an important contribution to safety because of improved visibility to the rear. 690053. Development of Antenna Windshield. David R. Grove, Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Co. The development of a windshield antenna for automobiles is discussed. A review of the program since 1957 is presented, then the author describes various problems encountered in constructing an acceptable windshield antenna. 690054. Welded Fasteners. William J. Evans, Welding Development Dept., Ford Motor Co. Resistance spot welding, projection welding, and drawn arc stud welding, are discussed as processes for the attachment of welded fasteners. Recent development work in the drawn arc stud welding process is emphasized. The drawn arc stud welding process offers the greatest flexibility of fastener design with minimal heat affected zone problems. 690055. New Criteria for Self-Loosening of Fasteners Under Vibration. Gerhard H. Junker, European Res. and Engrg., Standard Pressed Steel Co., Unbrako Koblenz. The theory of self-loosening of preloaded bolted con- nections when subjected to vibration is discussed. The significance of self-loosening as a cause of failure is explained, and design guidance to avoid self-loosening is given. The test methods are described and discussed in connection with a newly designed testing machine that yields quantitative data for evaluating locking properties. These methods can be applied to all types of locking elements. Finally, a simplified method for broad scale testing and inspection is proposed. 1969 SA E Transactions 690056. Geometrical Analysis of Hole Sizes for Thread- Forming Screwsi J. J. Lawser, Ford Motor Co. The practicability of specific hole sizes is known to be influenced by power tool dynamics, material char- acteristics, finishes, and screw type. Less attention has been paid to resulting internal thread goemetry. Histori- cally, the engineer controlled tapped hole thread geometry by appropriate thread form specifications. The advent of thread-forming screws has seriously limited his direct knowledge of internal thread geometry. This paper derives the important geometrical parameters for internal threads produced by thread-forming screws. Equations relate internal thread geometry to external thread form and hole size. Without complete standards for thread-forming screws, the technique is illustrated for a type C and a sharp crested nonstandard thread form. Per cent thread and per cent volume filled between threads are given by charts. 690057. Torque-Tension Test Data Acquisition and Re- duction. H. W. Ellison and G. L. Van Ermen, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. One of the functions of the Fastener Technical Section at GM Engineering Staff is to investigate the basic variables which affect fastener torque-tension relationships. The primary tool used for these investigations is the FTS Torque-Tension Test Machine. This machine has the capability of applying and measuring the torque to tighten, the resulting tension, the shank torque in the bolt, the number of degrees of rotation, and driver speed and air line pressure. In typical torque-tension testing, the tension in the fastener, the total tightening torque, and the torque in the bolt shank are measured using strain gaged load cells. In order to minimize test, and particularly, data reduction and analysis time, a computerized recording system is used. As a test is run, electrical signals from the load cells are stored and then automatically read into an IBM 1800 computer. The computer converts and analyses the data, computes statistics, and prints out a tabular and graphic summary of the' data. 690058. Application of Reinforced Plastics for Exterior Body Components. R. H. Spence and G. M. Wolf, Body Engrg. Office, Ford Motor Co. During the past 15 years, glassfiber mat or preform impregnated with polyester resins have been compression- molded as exterior panels for a complete plastic body or for individual body panels adjacent to steel panels. The recent introduction, however, of new, smooth surface, glassfiber reinforced polyesters, particularly bulk molding compounds, has accelerated the use of these thermoset plastics as a replacement for painted zinc die castings. These new type compounds can be molded into parts that are substantially void of sink marks, readily paintable with little or no sanding, and able to withstand present production and repair paint oven temperatures without cracking or distortion. Volume use in the future depends on the success of current production experience and projected economic savings. 1969 SA E Transactions 75</page><page sequence="11">690059-690065 76 690059. Current Trends in High Density Flexible Foams and Solid Urethane Materials. R. C. Burck, Cellasto, Inc. Cast solid urethane elastomers can be formulated to vary some properties. The injection molding grade urethanes can be blended with other plastic resins to lower cost and to modify properties. There is now a trend toward custom formulation for specific end use applications. Micro- cellular urethane elastomers combine the "toughness" of solid urethanes with the advantages of a cellular structure. This material performs as a self-compensating bumper. It responds gently to light loads but firms up under heavy loads. Microcellular elastomers are now used com- mercially in a number of automotive applications such as auxiliary springs, under-car bumpers, vibration damp- eners and seals. 690060. New Concepts for Polyurethane Foams in Auto- motive Body Design. William R. White, Mobay Chemical Co. Sandwich structures provide high stiffness at low weight and the use of polyurethane foam core has provided a versatile material for some time. Polyurethane duromer is the name of a new material which can produce a strong structural sandwich composite molding with integral solid urethane skins and a microporous core. Skins and core are produced simultaneously in a single operation from identical raw materials. The process is similar to injection molding, at relatively lower costs. These factors may provide the impetus to efforts directed toward making automotive body panels of plastic in economical mass production. 690061. The Fiat 124 AC Engine. A. Lampredi and C. Pollone, FIAT, S.p.A. The Fiat 124 AC engine for the sports car derives from the 124 A engine for the sedan. The two engines have many parts in common so that, although different in configura- tion, both can be machined on the same production line. The main feature of the sports engine is the use of a cylinder head with twin overhead camshafts and directly controlled, inclined valves, suitable for high rpm operation and high specific power without affecting the inherent flexibility of the engine in town traffic. For export to the United States, emissions are controlled to the levels required by the current Federal Regulations. 690062. Demonstration of a Self-Contained Organic Ran- kine Silent Engine. V. R. Degner and W. W. Velie, Rocketdyne Div., North Amer. Rockwell Corp. Development of a self-contained externally fired Rankine cycle power system capable of silent operation in a tactical combat environment is described. System working fluid considerations, including ultimate application re- quirements, materials compatibility, thermal stability, lubricating properties, and thermodynamic characteristics, led to the selection of monoisopropylbiphenyl primarily because of its low melting temperature. Over 400 hr of testing, conducted on this self-contained system to assess the noise and performance characteristics under a range of ambient conditions, are reported. These test results establish the basis for applying this concept of dynamic power generation to a relatively wide range of future military requirements. 690063. Rankine Cycle Working Fluid Selection and Specification Rationale. John Bjerklie and Stephen Luchter, Mechanical Technology Inc. Few practical applications of the organic Rankine cycle powerplant have been realized despite much interest expressed in the literature. One reason is high develop- ment cost for as yet unsubstantiated advantages; another is the technical problem of an ideal working fluid, which is crucial in this powerplant concept. As a preliminary, these authors attempt to define an "ideal" fluid, which can be then constructed by the chemical industry. To this end, the thermodynamic and aerodynamic characteristics of such a fluid are analyzed. Examples of specifications are then introduced. The conclusion is that "ideal" fluids can be specified as a function of application. 1969 SA E Transactions 690064. Torsionally Elastic Agricultural PTO Drivelines and Their Application. T. Trojanowski, Hayes- Dana Ltd. Farm implement sizes are increasing rapidly. The in- creases in rotating mass, the uneven load cycles, and the high probability of impact loads inherent in farm applications result in peak drive train torque loads which are very high compared to the average torque required. This paper discusses the conditions under which these peak torques arise, and the effects of torsional elasticity in reducing these peak torques, thus reducing stresses on all drive train components such as universal joints, gears, shafts, and so forth. 690065. Accident Prevention in Agriculture, with Special Reference to Power Take Off Drive Shaft Shields. R. J. Tristram, Atkogards Ltd., Eng- land. The combination of plastic power-take-off shield, the tractor master shield and the implement end shield, has become firmly established for world-wide use. From time to time "specials" appear, but they are in the minority. Materials for the construction of the power-take-off shaft shields have been researched effectively, so that now there exist shields that have physical properties that satisfy all requirements of world temperature ranges. To ensure the high quality, desirable in this particular equipment, many countries as well as making the use of a shield, a legal necessity, have instituted test schedules to which shields have to be subjected before sale is allowed in their respective areas. Today, there exists a keen awareness of the need for safety on the farm, and there can be no denying the fact</page><page sequence="12">690066-690072 that the physiccal wellbeing of farm workers is of vital importance to us all. The benefits of mechanization, with the resultant increase in crop yield, and so forth, cannot be fully realized if men are laid low because of accident. 690066. Gyroscopically Induced Failure in Multiple Disc Clutches, Its Causes, Its Characteristics and Its Cures. Conrad R. Hilpert, Rockford Wks., Twin Disc Inc. A failure commonly called "clutch plate flutter" is described, and the developed cures are presented. The complete theoretical and practical cases are detailed with mathematics, illustrations, and explanations. It is con- cluded that flutter is gyroscopic in origin, can be defined mathematically, occurs only in counter-rotating clutches, and can be eliminated by minor design innovations requiring no additional parts. 1969 SA E Transactions 690067. Instrument Panel Impact Characteristic Studies - G Loadings, and Force-Deflection Analyses. Charles E. Austin, George O. Buesking and Jack B. Lutz, Engineering Office, Chrysler Corp. A series of controlled impact experiments have been conducted using test samples in a variety of shapes, materials, and adaptations as part of a continuing program to establish impact safety performance guidelines for vehicle interior surfaces. This paper is a progress report on the nearly 200 tests conducted to date. The paper discusses: 1.The planned program and results to date. 2. Several approaches for analyzing impact data. In addition, the Appendix of the paper contains force-deflection data for a number of selected impact tests. Force-deflection information is useable in computer applications for simulating the impact performance of configurations, and its analysis may well become an important future technique for interpreting impact data. 690068. Passenger Protection from Front-End Impacts. Derwyn M. Severy, Harrison M. Brink and Jack D. Baird, Inst, of Transportation and Traffic Engrg., Dept. of Engrg., Univ. of California. Scientific methodology and engineering techniques were applied to a series of 13 automobile collision experiments involving the front-end impact exposures of full-size passenger vehicles rear ending identical sedans. The purpose was to evaluate the relative protective merits of seat designs, steering columns, windshields, restraints and general interior surface design with respect to the many variables common to front-end impacts. The front-end collisions reported in this paper provide additional design data for protection of motorists from collision-injuries for the wide range of exposure speeds from 10 through 55 mph. 690069. Roof and Windshield Header Constructions. E. H. Klove and G. W. Ropers, Fisher Body Div., GMC. The history and problems of dynamic testing procedures relative to roof structure are discussed briefly. A new static laboratory testing technique is discussed. Windshield header design, the development of testing procedures, and the evolution of a windshield header design that provides a skidding action are also covered. Tests conducted on the new design windshield header indicate that there is a definite reduction in potential head injury as a result of impact as compared to the conven- tional header construction. The new header surface minimizes the rearward head rotation and the abrupt change in head movement which occurs when contact is made with the rear wall of the header surface. 690070. Model Study of Automobile Collisions. Richard I. Emori and Dan Link, Department of Engrg., University of California. It was found by dimensional analysis that the vehicle motion during and after collisions may be studied with scale models, in lieu of full-size automobiles. The scale models were designed to exhibit the same coefficients of restitution and friction between the vehicle bodies in collision and the same coefficient of friction of tire on test surface as full-size automobiles. Post-collision motions of the model vehicle well duplicate those of corresponding full-size automobile tests, resulting from similar impulse exchange in collision. 690071. Electric- Wheel Vehicle Propulsion System. C. W. King and George C. Collins, Delco-Remy Div., GMC.; and Walter Slabiak, Propulsion Systems Lab., U. S. Army Tank Automotive Command. An electric-wheel vehicle propulsion system has several potential advantages in the area of mobility, vehicle- design flexibility, and the accomplishment of multiple functions. Such a system has been developed and applied to an M-35 military vehicle. The system consists of six-wheel mounted and unique brushless synchronous motors powered by an engine-driven alternator. This paper describes the application of these brushless synchronous motors in the M-35 vehicle which serves as a testbed and reviews the subsystems necessary to achieve a functional vehicle. Subsystems examined include the power train elements (engine, alternator, power con- verters, motors), the dynamic braking system, the engine alternator control loop, the motor field control loop, and the operator controls. Preliminary test results also are reviewed. 1969 SA E Transactions 690072. Development of Electric Vehicles in Japan. Yoshizo Miyake, Government Industrial Res. Inst., Japan. A comprehensive review of prototype electric vehicles developed in Japan and the extensive research being done 77</page><page sequence="13">690073-690082 78 to improve battery and fuel cell power sources is presented. Descriptions and specifications of the various models are included. Commercial as well as academic and government research projects are listed. The development of these vehicles is firmly based on experience gained during the war years and present objectives are concentra- ted on obtaining greater cruising ranges and the perfection of more reliable and more easily serviced power supplies. 690073. Future Electric Cars. George A. Hoffman, Institute of Transportation and Traffic Engrg., Univ. of California. The economics involved in achieving pollution-free vehicles, as projected through the end of the century for both exhaust-suppressed combustion engines and electric powerplants, points to battery-operated cars as ultimately the less expensive means of curbing automotive emissions. However, it is predicted that all-electrics will outnumber combustion-engine vehicles after the start of the 21st Century, at the earliest, and then only at the price of mediocre top speeds and performance when using non- hazardous batteries. Unlimited range electric cars will become possible with the rapid replacement of depleted batteries at service stations, eliminating the need for recharging at home by drivers. To close the 30-year gap between quantity production of all-combustion and all-battery automobiles, a hybrid vehicle concept is described, whose power system consists of a small turbine, generator, electric motor and batteries. 690074. Stir-Lec I, A Stirling Electric Hybrid Car. Paul D. Agarwal, Robert J. Mooney and Richard R. Toepel, General Motors Res. Labs. An experimental vehicle design by the GM Research Laboratories to explore the use of a low-emission engine and electric drive system in a small car is described. For this study, a 1968 Opel Kadett has been modified to use a variable-speed ac electric motor to drive the rear wheels through reduction gears and the differential. Batteries provide electric power to the motor through electronic circuitry that gives the variable frequency required for speed control. A small Stirling engine, driving an alterna- tor, supplies energy to the batteries. 690075. Elimination of Temperature Induced Nonuni- formity in Tires by Air Ring Control. Frank J. Cimprich, B. F. Goodrich Co. Tire cooling apparatus has been invented which cools the tire evenly during the conventional postcure inflation cycle after removal of the tire from the press. It consists of a hollow tube in the form of a ring having a series of holes located around its inside periphery to direct cooling air over the entire surface of the tire. In addition to the mechanical nonuniformities in tires, tires made with thermoelastic cords exhibit another class of nonuniformity due to temperature differences across the tire cooling unevenly in free air. The coupling of these two nonuniformities prohibits proper grading and testing of tires. The apparatus offers a postcure inflation treatment of vulcanized nylon and polyester tires pro- viding a uniformity of quality throughout the tire with a higher percentage of acceptability when measured for force variation uniformity. 690076. Uniformity Control of Cured Tires. Clarence Hof el t, Jr., Experimental Testing SSection, Gen- eral Tire and Rubber Co.; and John E. Cori, Experimental Testing Section, General Tire and Rubber Co. Tire uniformity alteration is a method to reduce non- uniformity levels of cured tires to a selected minimum value. The process includes removing a very small amount of rubber from strategic regions on the tire tread. The method is used in tire production and is an effective corrective procedure. When the tire and wheel system is considered, demonstrable improvements in vehicle shake are obtained. 690077. Equipment for Measuring Forces and Moments on Passenger Tires. H. D. Tarpinian, Uniroyal Tire Co. A new machine for measuring tire engineering parameters is described. The machine measures forces and moments on a deflected, rolling tire as functions of slip angle, camber angle, and deflection. Ease of tire mounting, simple operation, and convenient data collection are important features of this machine. Typical measurements of cornering force, aligning torque, enveloping forces, and nonuniformity are presented. 690082. Status of Transportation Engineering Curricula at Ohio State. Johannes F. Schwar, Department of Civil Engrg., Ohio State Univ. Transportation engineering education should cover all modes of transportation (highways, railways, airways, and the like). Traditionally, courses in transportation engineer- ing education have been offered almost exclusively in civil engineering, with emphasis on highway engineering during recent years. To cover the broad subject area more adequately future curricula should be stratified by function (planning, design, construction, and operation of multimodal system) rather than by mode. Ohio State, in changing from a 5- to a 4-year undergraduate curriculum, is revamping its transportation engineering offerings. The new curriculum will include three required courses in transportation, structured by function and cutting across the various transportation modes. In addition, a number of electives on specific topics will be available. The graduate program will be similarly expanded. The development of the new curric- ulum at Ohio State is described in detail, along with methods of attracting students to the program.</page><page sequence="14">690083-690089 690083.

Davis, Falk Corp.; and O. A. Uyehara and P. S. Myers, Dept. of Mechanical Engrg., Univ. of Wiscon- sin. To determine the effects of knock in a spark-ignition, single-cylinder engine with cooled exhaust upon the exhaust composition, exhaust products (carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and total hydrocarbons) were measured by non-dispersive infrared analyzers (NDIRA) and by a flame ionization detector (FID). Individual hydrocarbons were separated on a gas-liquid Chromatograph. In fuel-rich mixtures, the FID indicated noticible decreases in the hydrocarbon concentrations in the presence of knock. The NDIRA did not indicate a decrease in the hydrocarbons at knock of lower intensities but showed decreases in hydrocarbons at knock of higher intensities. Chromatograms indicated at preferential de- creases in acetylene at the time of knock, causing different responses at lower intensities. In fuel-lean mixtures, no apparent effect of knock on the hydrocarbons was indicated. Thus, it was concluded that in fuel-rich to stoichio- metric regions, knock generally decreases the hydro- carbon concentration in the exhaust and the extent of the decreases is greater with the intensity of knock. 1969 SA E Transactions 690086. Activated Carbon for Effective Control of Evapo- rative Losses. Ronald S. Joyce, Paul D. Lang- ston, George R. Stoneburner, Charles B. Stun- kard and George S. Tobias, Pittsburgh Activated Carbon Div., Calgon Corp. The factors that govern the performance of activated carbons for the control of evaporative emissions in an automobile are discussed. First, the physical properties that affect its ability to store and subsequently release hydrocarbon vapors are considered. Secondly, accelerated test procedures are described to evaluate the adsorptive stability of the carbon. The results of these tests are discussed and related to long-term performance. Finally, the adsorption-desorption principles applicable to evapo- rative loss control are outlined. Guidelines are presented for the application of these factors to the design of effective systems. It is concluded that activated carbons commercially available at present, can meet the capacity and durability requirements of the automobile envi- ronment. Discussion: Donald A.

Nelson, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. Evaporative emissions from automobiles can be reduced by lowering gasoline volatility. A 3 psi reduction in Reid vapor pressure will reduce evaporative losses by about 50%. A test program was conducted to determine if new and used cars presently on the road in the Los Angeles basin could operate satisfactorily on lower volatility gasoline. The results of this program indicated that gasoline with reduced volatility gave acceptable drive- ability and could be used to provide a significant reduction in hydrocarbon emission.

Jackson and Robert L. Everett, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. The effect of fuel composition on automotive evaporative emissions has been studied using five cars, not equipped with evaporative emission controls, and a total of 31 fuels. The amount of evaporative emissions increased with increasing fuel volatility. Also, the evaporative emission photochemical reactivity per gram increased with in- creasing C4 and C5 olefins in the fuel and decreased with increasing C4 and C5 paraffins. For an assessment of the smog potential of evapora- tive emissions, the amount and reactivity per gram should not be considered independently, since they both are simultaneously dependent on fuel composition. The product of amount and reactivity per gram (the evapora- tive reactive index) is a good measure of the contribution of evaporative emissions to photochemical air pollution. An empirical equation for predicting the evaporative reactive index from fuel properties has been derived. First, the two-part equation predicts the emission amount from the per cent fuel evaporated in an ASTM distillation at 160 F and the fuel's Reid vapor pressure. Second, the reactivity per gram of the evaporative emissions can be determined from the per cent C4 and C5 olefins and the per cent C4 and C5 paraffins in the fuel. Discussion: R. S. Spindt, J. C.

Results show that diluting the concentration of light olefins in the original fuel, normally accomplished by additions of light paraffins and saturate base stocks, will reduce the hydrocarbon reactivity of evaporation losses. 690090. Theory and Practice of Plating on Plastics. E. B. Saubestre, Enthone, Inc. Plating on plastics is a commercial operation, yet it is not known why metals adhere to plastics. Two leading theories emphasize mechanical and chemical bonding; these are discussed and related to the formulation of chemical etchants. Pull test adhesion values are related to the effect of etchants on ABS and polypropylene surfaces. The three principal methods for plating on plastics are then outlined. 690091. Plating of ABS. David C. Johnson, Marbon Chemical Div., Borg-Warner Corp. Fully automated, reliable high volume, low cost produc- tion of plated ABS is a fact today for an ever increasing variety of parts. The necessary steps from design through production are discussed. Key factors in designing the part and mold, setting molding conditions, and tips for good plating are included. 690092. Research Study of Performance of Various Plated Plastics. William P. Innes, MacDermid Inc. Electroplated ABS and polypropylene are tested, com- paratively and with identical plate composites, for metal to plastic adhesion, resistance to humidity, thermal cycle, outdoor exposure and CASS. Results are discussed in terms of functional behavior of plated plastics. Based on the tests run, appropriate grades of ABS can be plated satisfactorily when properly molded for plating. The results show that adhesion of plate to ABS is substantially reduced in areas of high stress due to improper molding. The adhesion of metal to polymer on polypropylene is greater than on ABS. Stress due to improper molding of polypropylene does not reduce the adhesion in stressed areas to as great a degree as ABS. Water absorption of polypropylene is substantially lower than ABS which together with the higher adhesion property may account for the apparent superior outdoor weatherability of plated polypropylene. 1969 SA E Transactions 690093. The Plated Barracuda Grille. E. L. Scholl, Chrysler Corp.; and W. J. Best, Detroit Plastic Molding Co. The 1968 Barracuda grille, originally designed as a painted ABS grille, was chromium plated for a special springtime model release. This was the first plated ABS automotive grille in the industry. A composite plated coating of bright acid copper and three nickel coatings was used. The plated grille was placed in production in December 1967. Although the field service period has been too short to be conclusive, at this date, the application appears very successful. This paper provides a fresh insight into the close interdependence of the vendor and the manufacturer in automotive plating. 690095. Metallographic Examination of the Corrosion Mechanism of Plated Plastic. R. H. Munson and A. M. Melford, Body Engineering Office, Ford Motor Co. Since 1963, the Ford Motor Co. has conducted various corrosion tests on plated plastic. Using a molded ABS 1965 Continental emblem, plated first with a single, bright and Dur-Ni nickel system, and then with a dual system (semi-bright, bright, and Dur-Ni nickel), Ford was able to determine the extent of corrosion. It was found that corrosion penetration through the nickel deposit, with either the single or dual systems, was significantly reduced with Dur-Ni nickel. 1969 SA E Transactions 690696. History of Truck Suspension - Tandem Suspen- sions. Edward D. Hendrickson, Hendrickson Mfg. Co. The problems encountered with early four-wheel solid tire trucks are outlined. The evolution to pneumatic tires and then the addition of the third axle are covered. The many different types of suspension developed are illustrated, as well as the corresponding drive and trailer axle assemblies. Finally, the economics of the dual-axle concept are shown to be still current today. Discussion: W. S. Coleman; White Motor Corp.; Bob Norrie; Ken worth Motor Truck Co. 1969 SA E Transactions 690097. Hollow Rubber Springs for Progressive Rate Suspensions. H. Viereck, Go-Tract Div., Rolls- Royce (Canada) Ltd. A series of rubber compression springs are described that obtain large deflections and progressive rates from a special configuration. Functioning of the basic spring is explained. Factors influencing the performance and service life are discussed. Examples of progressive rate suspensions using hollow rubber springs singly and in combination with other spring media are presented. 690098. Subjective Truck Ride Evaluation by a Qualita- tive Scale. Joseph T. O'Hagan, Jr., Ford Motor Co. A new qualitative ride comfort scale was used by professional heavy truck drivers to report differences, which were found to be statistically reliable, in overall ride quality of 18 heavy trucks. Each truck was evaluated at each of three speeds by both the driver and a rider. The effects of speed and evaluator position on ride evaluation also produced differences that were found to be reliable. In addition to overall ride evaluation, four compo- nents of motion were rated on a 2-point scale as either</page><page sequence="16">690099-690104 "objectionable" or "not objectionable." Although the structures of the overall ride and of the motion compo- nents scales were different from each other, we found a statistically reliable correlation between the two, sug- gesting that a common subjective criterion had been applied by professional truck drivers in evaluating both overall ride and component motions. 690099. Truck Ride - A Mathematical and Empirical Study. W. D. Walther, Dayton Steel Foundry Co.; David Gossard, Purdue Univ.; and Phillip Fensel, Brown Univ. "Truck ride" in this study refers to some vehicle ride parameters involved in tractor-trailer combinations. For the study, a mathematical model of a tractor-trailer vehicle as a vibrating system was developed. Principles of vibration theory were applied to the model while a digital computer was employed to investigate the complex system. To parallel the analytical investigation of the tractor- trailer vehicle, vehicle studies were conducted using a magnetic tape recorder and associated instrumentation installed in the tractor. Parameters studied included coupler position on the tractor, laden weight of trailer, spring rates of the different axles of the combination, damping capacity associated with each spring rate, vehicle speed, and "tar strip" spacing of the highway and cab mountings. The mathematical results were used as a basis for empirical study. A comparison of calculated and empirical data are reported. Correlation of computed results with published ride characteristics of tractor-trailer combina- tions was also made. Discussed are some characteristics for significant ride improvement as well as limitations of some parameters for improving ride. Discussion: R. N. Janeway; Janeway Engineering Co.; Richard J.

Two laboratory heats of Waspaloy were melted with carbon contents of 0.01 and 0.10%. The properties and chemical gradients were measured. Tensile ductility as-cast and heat treated of the 0.01% carbon heat was markedly superior. Segregation of titanium and molyb- denum was shown to exist but the higher carbon alloy formed. 690101. Deformation Processing of Superalloy Gas Tur- bine Components. A. J. DeRidder and R. J. Noel, Ladish Co. Three important wrought superalloys - Waspaloy, Inconel 718, and Astroloy - are selected for analysis here because of their promising use in the manufacture of gas turbine components. Their exceptional high temperature perfor- mance is explained in terms of alloy segregation, thermo- mechanical techniques, precipitation factors, and final forging characteristics. 690102. Fusion Welding of Age-Hardenable Superalloys. G. S. Hoppin, III and R. E. Yount, Aircraft Engine Group, General Elee. Co. Successful fusion welding of high-strength, high-tempera- ture superalloys is essential to the economic manufacture of modern lightweight, high-performance gas turbines. To achieve this, recognition of certain inherent problems and limitations in the welding of these alloys is vital, as the precipitation-hardened iron and nickel-based superalloys are intrinsically more difficult to weld than the solid solution strengthened alloys of iron, nickel, and cobalt that are also employed in gas turbine manufacture. This paper reviews the problems and some of the solutions to these problems in welding the wrought alloys A-286, alloy 718, Rene 41, and Rene 77. These alloys have been chosen for discussion both because of their wide usage in modern gas turbines and because they exemplify differing types of fusion welding problems in superalloys. 690103. Application of New Concepts to the Design of an Advanced Nickel-Base Superalloy - Udimet 710. T. W. Cowan and W. B. Aufderhaar, Special Metals Corp. Sulfidation attack of nickel-base superalloys operating in salt air environments has received major technical attention in recent years due to the rapid and catastrophic nature of such attack. Also, structural stability of nickel-base alloys subjected to long exposures at elevated temperatures has received considerable technical interest because of the often associated property degradation with structural changes, and the need to produce reliable material behavior over longer periods of time. This paper briefly reviews the technology of sulfida- tion attack and structural stability and discusses the application of knowledge gained to the design of a new nickel-base superalloy, Udimet 710. 690104. Human Criteria for Protection from Vehicle Crash Impact. John P. Stapp, National Highway Safety Bureau. Human criteria for impact tolerance and survival are appropriate for standards in military and aviation space flight, when based on experiments with human volunteers representative of air and space flight crews. Automotive crash also involves pregnant females, infants, small children, the aged and infirm - for humanitarian reasons excluded from painful and hazardous experiments. The automotive crash repertoire is limited to com- parison with the variety and velocity of aerospace impact producing situations. An approach is suggested for standardizing vehicle crashes. On that basis, determining occupant exposure to crash forces then modulating exposure to within human tolerance and survival limits. This will expedite evolution of crash protection. 81</page><page sequence="17">690105-690110 82 690105. Methods for Determining Driver Reach Capabil- ity. J. W. Chaffee, Automotive Safety Res. Office, Ford Motor Co. A method of measuring the reach that may be expected from the driving population in an automotive package is described. An example is given of the application of the method to define, for a given passenger car basic seating geometry, a one-handed maximum grasping reach bound- ary, termed "ergosphere." Reach capability is statistically distributed; hence no unique reach boundary exists. Rather, there is a different reach boundary for each percentile level that may be considered. A very simple basic package geometry is used in the example, and as a consequence, the resulting ergosphere does not show the effects of steering wheel placement and other controls, nor of body restraints such as lap and shoulder belts.

The "LXX" - A New Concept in Tires. John D. Kelley and William R. Woodall, Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. A completely new tire concept has resulted in a develop- ment which goes far beyond body constructions, cord materials, compounds, and tread designs. Basically this is a new, shaped tire that offers significant improvements in tire safety, durability, and performance. Since this new tire, the "LXX," utilizes a new rim which is large in diameter and low in stresses, the automotive engineer is afforded greater latitude in optimizing braking systems. 1969 SA E Transactions 690107. Performance Characteristics of Low Aspect Ra- dial Tires. R. L. Carr, B. F. Goodrich Tire Company. Performance of low aspect ratio radial passenger tires is discussed. The performance characteristics considered are: treaé wear, ride softness, traction, and tire strength. A review òf low aspect ratio radial ply construction and inflated:profiles of various other tires are included along with styling of the ultra low profile radial tire, as it relates to overall vehicle appearance. 690108. Low Power Loss Tires. W. W. Curtiss, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. Rolling resistance is discussed as applied to pneumatic tires. Reference is made to the low power source vehicles under development and the importance of providing a tire compatible with this type of vehicle. The emphasis is placed on minimizing the power consumption in tires and the relationship of this minimization to the other perfor- mance properties of the tire. Basic relationships of rolling resistance are discussed as associated with structural and environmental factors in both low and high speed operation. The discussion covers only tire service over hard surfaces and is primarily concerned with passenger car tires. 690109. Random Vibration Analysis and Vehicle Develop- ment. Andrius A. Butkunas, Engineering Staff, Ford Motor Co. General methods are described for the use of random vibration analysis techniques in vehicle development activities. The success in the application of the described techniques depends to a large extent on a thorough understanding of all factors controlling vibration meas- urements in an on-the-road vehicle environment. Basic philosophy as well as specific recommendations are given for design of test procedures in vehicle evaluation and problem diagnosis tasks. The use of random vibration analysis techniques has already resulted in better understanding of vehicle vibration phenomenon encountered. In particular, in recent years very significant work has been done by Ford and elsewhere on fundamental vibration sources such as road profile perturbation and rotating tire inputs. Good understanding of the relative importance of a particular vibration source in a given problem is required before a successful test plan can be prepared. The final and most important task facing the develop- ment engineer is an effective description of the mechanism by which his particular vibration problem comes about. Such a description includes identification of predominant vibration sources, determination of pertinent system parameters, and, for continuous elastic structures, the description of mode shapes. 1969 SA E Transactions 690110. Laboratory Simulation of Vibration Environment Encountered in Rail Shipment of Automobiles. Duane J. Bonvallet and Raymond D. Isaacson, Proving Ground, General Motors Corp. Data recorded during a railroad shipment of automobiles were used to determine the cause of auto frame damage. This paper points out that the damage is caused primarily by the vertical motions of the rail car. These motions were duplicated by a relatively simple simulator consisting of tape controlled servo hydraulic rams and a platform. The simulator reproduces automobile damage experienced on railroad shipments, and has been used to evaluate rapidly different methods of attaching automobiles to the rail car.</page><page sequence="18">690111-690117 690111. Application of the Probability Theory to the Design Procedure of an Endurance Test Track Surface. Ichiroh Kaneshige, Isuzu Motors Ltd. The probability theory is applied to the design procedure of a test track surface in order to obtain good similarity in statistical data between the endurance test results on the test track and the real situation with customer usage, and to reduce the endurance test peroid. The test track surface design is made by using the expected power spectrum of road surface and cross spectrum between two longitudinal lanes on the road surface. Those spectra are to be induced from various measured spectra. Experimental results on this test track and the other tracks are also discussed in this paper. 690112. New Developments in Bearing Materials. G. C. Pratt, Glacier Metal Co. Ltd. The increasing use of tin/aluminum alloy as a material for bearings in automotive applications is the subject of this paper. Various metal combinations are discussed and their advantages or disadvantages are compared. Compatibility of metal components in alloys is a matter of extreme importance in their manufacturing processes and in their performance acceptability. These problems are related to the economic and durability aspects of the several alloys and also to the increasing use of plastics in less demanding applications. 690113. Performance Characteristics of the General Mo- tors Aluminum-Babbitt Bearing Material. J. C. Bierlein, A. O. DeHart and R. C. Rosenberg, General Motors Res. Labs.; and A. W. Rike, Delco Moraine Div., GMC. A new aluminum alloy bearing material containing lead base babbitt is described. This material provides the performance advantages of an overplated babbitt con- struction without requiring the plating procedure. Perfor- mance characteristics including fatigue, wear, score, and corrosion resistances and embedability are compared to standard SAE bearing materials on the basis of laboratory tests. Extensive engine dynamometer and vehicle field tests are described to show the excellent durability of this new material. 690114. Journal Center Orbits in Piston Engine Bearings. Joseph M. Ross, Cleveland Graphite Bronze Div., Clevite Corp.; and Robert R. Slaymaker, Cleveland Graphite Bronze Div., Clevite Corp.; and Case-Western Reserve Univ. The classic problem of dynamically loaded bearings is dealt with. It differs from previous, related work by being directed toward the engine designer rather than a PhD thesis committee. An automotive engineer, aided by a computer, can use the included computation procedure to get a reasonable picture of bearing performance. He can discover the effect of changes in speed, power, dimen- sions, and oil on potential trouble spots and he can see the difference in behavior of main bearings, crankpin bear- ings, and wrist pin bushings. Typical orbit diagrams, based on this procedure, are included for comparison with photographs of test bearings for which the journal paths were drawn. Discussion: J. F. Booker; Cornell Univ.; F. A.

The development and ultimate viability of electric vehicles depend basically on one major factor: economics. This paper discusses the early development of electric vehicles and the reason for their inability to compete with the more economical gasoline-driven vehicles. A comparison is made between electric transportation in the U. S. and other countries. Reasons are presented for the growing industrial and commercial transportation market for electric vehicles, compared to that of electric passenger vehicles. Since current transportation modes will not be sufficient to meet future demands, new uses and recent planning for electric vehicles are discussed. 690116. Economic Fastors in the Production and Mar- keting of Electric Vehicles. Lloyd D. Orr, Indi- ana Univ. Interrelated technical and economic factors that will influence the decisions on development, production, and marketing of electric vehicles are discussed. It is suggested that the attractiveness of electrics for a wide range of limited-use purposes, and their small economies of scale in production and marketing will prove attractive to small and medium size firms .who wish to enter the automobile industry. The paper also describes the use of input-output analysis as a technique for assessing the impact of an electric car innovation on resource use and industrial structures. 690117. A Drivable Electric Car Simulator. Leonard P. Gau, Research Office, Chrysler Corp. Alterations to a conventional passenger car that give it the acceleration and range performance characteristics of a battery-powered electric car are described. Acceleration tailoring is accomplished by engine and drive train modifications. Range performance is duplicated by an on-board computer designed to measure power consump- tion and impose those constraints characterizing electric propulsion in the foreseeable future. As such, this simulator is usable for conducting experiments designed to yield knowledge about a broad spectrum of acceptable performance limitations as might be imposed by safety considerations and attitudes of the general motoring public. 83</page><page sequence="19">690118-690124 84 690118. The M.I.T. Electric Car. Leon S. Loeb, M.I.T. Electric Car Project, Massachusetts Inst, of Technology. Designed as a test bed for electric vehicle components, the M.I.T. electric car, Tech I, is adaptable to a number of different power source-control motor systems. This paper discusses the performance of the systems incorporated in the vehicle as of October 1968, and outlines plans for future upgrading of the battery, motor, and control systems, culminating in the evolution of the Tech II electric car. 690119. New Ford Midrange Diesel Trucks. E. J. Geiger and L. L. Langlois, Ford Motor Co. The traditional advantages of diesel power, such as fuel economy and dependability, enjoyed for many years in the heavy duty line haul diesel usage, can now be experienced by the users of medium heavy trucks. In April 1968, Ford Motor Co. introduced a midrange diesel truck series powered by the "Ford V-Series Diesel by Cater- pillar." This paper discusses the pertinent design and development experiences which we encountered and how they were treated. A great deal of care was necessary in the selection of program objectives to assure that they were realistic and desirable. These as well as the objectives established for the total vehicle and engine will be discussed. Cooling, engine mounting, transmissions, and rear axle were component areas requiring special attention and will be treated in some detail. A test and prove-out program was developed which assured that the design objectives had been totally achieved. Since it was impractical to wait until full prototypes were functional before testing could begin, a series of component durability tests were initiated, which provided early insight and design direction or verification. This will be discussed together with the service life factors for the engine and total vehicle. 690120. Caterpillar's 1100 Series Direct Injection Diesel Engines. Roger A. Stapf and Donald W. Knopf, Caterpillar Tractor Co. A new family of lightweight, high speed, direct injection, diesel truck engines has been developed for medium-duty applications. These 4.5-in. bore, 90-deg V, 8-cyl, naturally aspirated engines are rated at 150, 175, 200, and 225 hp. Three displacements are utilized within a common engine package size to produce these ratings. Several unique design features, including a 2-ring piston and a specially angled main bearing cap are incorporated in these engines. 690121. Plastics in the British Automotive Industry. Roy Prosser and Denis Sandiford, Plastics Div., Development Dept., Imperial Chemical Indus- tries Ltd. Industry in the United Kingdom uses 105 lb of plastics annually (62 lb/vehicle), nearly all the common plastics are employed. Half the total divides equally between Polyurethane foam and soft PVC. Of the thermoplastics used polypropylene shows the greatest growth rate. Principal areas of increase foreseen are extensions of existing applications, adoption for more arduous mechan- ical duties and possible use as body structures. If these expectations are realized consumption by 1980 could reach 700 lb/year. (200 lb/vehicle). Some groups on both sides of industry are conducting costly development studies, which are necessary in view of the present inadequate state of knowledge of the limita- tions and applicability of the synthetics to vehicle construction. Historical cost trends, upward for steel and downward for plastics, will continue; by 1980 it is foreseen that cost parity between plastic and steel body parts could be reached; the prospect will continue to stimulate technical innovation leading to more massive adoption of plastics in automobiles. 1969 SA E Transactions 690122. Plastics: Is the European Car Different? Jean Nouaille Degorce, Du Pont de Nemours Inter- national S. A. The basic differences in the European automotive indus- try as compared to the U. S. industry lie both in the structure of the industries (numerous manufacturers in distant geographical locations throughout Europe) and in the type of product made in Europe (usually a car smaller than the U. S. compact in 1968, with more limited power). These geographical and economic considerations explain to some extent the differences with respect to applications of plastics in European and American cars. Present differences originated in the transient steps of evolution and not in basic dissensions in engineering considerations. In the long run it can be assumed that solutions which are economically justified will be adopted on both sides of the Atlantic. 690123. Use of Elastomers in European Automobiles. Henry E. Lenaerts, Du Pont de Nemours International S. A. Some recent developments in the area of elastomer applications in European automobiles are reviewed. The developments covered are limited to those recent ones which are different from parts and applications used in the United States as a result of the basic difference in design concept because of size, weight, power, and methods of transmitting power. The automobile compo- nents discussed include door seals, the ignition system, radiator and heater hose, engine and valve seals, camshaft and steering components, disc brakes, power transmission, transmission belts, and glazing. 690124. Evolutionary Development of the Public Trans- port System. B. W. Firth, University of Nevada. Numerous conceptual and feasibility studies have been published for transportation systems involving révolu-</page><page sequence="20">690125-690130 tionary departures from established systems. Such pro- posals can be assessed properly by comparison not with systems existing today but only with such systems as they might be at an appropriate future date given the same environment and management as assumed for the novel system. The public highway/free-ranging vehicle system is studied on the assumptions that it is operated as rewardingly as its limitations allow and that these limitations are extended continuously by the normal process of technical innovation. It appears that the system is fully able to meet the needs of a country having a well-developed air transport system, and that further development of the existing system is advantageous compared to introduction of a novel system. The only radical change needed is the introduction of good management. 690125. Social Change - Transportation Requirements and 1990 Plans. Irving J. Rubin, Detroit Re- gional Transportation and Land Use Study. The Detroit Regional Transportation and Land Use Study, known as TALUS, began in July of 1965. The project is similar in nature to other studies which have been completed recently or are under way in more than 200 urbanized areas throughout the United States. The purpose of the study is the development of a comprehensive plan to guide growth and development of the seven-county Southeast Michigan Metropolitan Re- gion through 1990. TALUS will be making recom- mendations for highway and public transportation facili- ties, airports, harbors and railroads, sewer and water facilities; these recommendations will be based on a land use plan dealing with the residential, commercial, indus- trial, agricultural and recreational uses of land throughout the region. The broad comprehensive nature of the study and the recommendations which will flow from it are required if we are to respond adequately to the problems of the present and the potential crises of the future. It is becoming increasingly evident that population growth, affluence and technology will continue to generate problems within our metropolitan regions which cannot be resolved by the uncoordinated actions of a multiplicity of special-purpose operating agencies, however broad their geographic jurisdictions; nor, by the largely pa- rochial decisions of a proliferation of local governmental agencies competing among each other for the affluent households, the "clean, acceptable," research-oriented industrial activity, the prestige shopping centers, and the limited supply of State and Federal aid. The study operates as a special project of the Planning Division of the Southeast Michigan Council of Govern- ments. 690126. Motors for Electric Vehicles. Charles M. Wheel- er, General Elee. Co. D-C series motors have historically been used for driving electric vehicles. Solid state control has made it possible to operate a-c motors from d-c power sources. Controllers for a-c motors must invert, modulate voltage and frequency, and commutate the d-c power. Although the d-c motor is heavier than a-c motors because com- mutation devices are self-contained, controllers for d-c motors need only to vary the voltage. Thus, d-c drive systems are simpler and less costly than a-c systems. Unlike internal-combustion engines, the continuous torque rating of a motor is considerably less than its maximum torque. Several kinds of enclosures are avail- able for d-c motors for matching average torque capability with load requirements and, d-c motors are well adapted to highway vehicles. Brush life is no problem, more than 50,000 miles between brush changes is easily obtained. Regenerative braking, so attractive in concept, gener- ally does not prove economical for passenger-type highway vehiclles. Dynamic braking is costly to install and control. At the present state-of-the-art, the d-c motor, earliest of all traction motors, is still the top contender for driving highway vehicles. 690127. Controllers for Electric Cars. A. W. Hartman, Hartman Electrical Mfg. Co. The speed controllers used in the Henney Kilowatt car and in the old and more recent Mars II electric cars are described. The latter now utilize series-paralleling of the bat- teries, plus intermediate steps of series-paralleling of two series fields, to obtain a wide range of running speed control. 690129. Review of Battery Systems for Electric Vehicles. Giovanni Caprioglio, Gulf General Atomic Inc. The requirements of a vehicle are classified into perfor- mance, economy, and convenience factors. Advances in the present battery technology provide the conditions for the competitive existence of electric vehicles for special uses.

Moyer, ATTO Labo- ratories, Inc. The charging requirements of series-and/or parallel- connected groups of individual cells, with and without connected loads are discussed here. The importance of their internal resistance and counter emf when charged from probably energy sources having widely varying voltage and limited current capabilities is also covered. Rapid recharging, control means, circuitry, and compo- nent devices are discussed. An extensive bibliography covers items of historical and related interest and is useful for further knowledge of specific items such as British and American surveys comparing battery types, fuel cells 85</page><page sequence="21">690131-690135 86 versus fused-salt electrolyte batteries and combinations thereof, renewable electrode recharging, and so forth. 690131. Factors Influencing Automotive Air Conditioner Evaporator Optimization. Willard R. Zahn, York Div., Borg-Warner Corp. On the basis of calculations from a computer program developed specifically for fin-tube coils cooling air by refrigeration evaporation, data are presented and dis- cussed showing the effect of core design (tube diameter, tube arrangement, and core depth), and of operating limits (face velocity, air and refrigerant pressure drop) on "optimum" designs of automotive air conditioning evap- orator coils at a typical operating point. Calculations are also made showing the effect of changing the operating conditions on the capacity of several core designs. It is shown that the "optimum" depends on many factors. The complex interaction of these factors makes the optimum for one specific car model or operating condition not likely to be the same as for another. 690132. Automobile Air Conditioning System Perfor- mance Evaluation. F. W. Deady, Chrysler Corp. Criteria for the objective consideration of air cooling system performance acceptability are described. These include the ability to cool under "design load" conditions and the ability to modulate cooling output smoothly under less than design loads. Various test techniques for measuring system behavior under laboratory and over-the-road conditions are also discussed. The controlled ambient test chamber is des- cribed, as are the 25 mph cool-down test, the city traffic test, road testing, and vehicle preparation. Data taking techniques and jury evaluation are also treated. 690134. Theoretical and Experimental Analysis of Air and Gas Flows in a Crankcase Scavenged Two-Stroke Engine Employing Boost Ports. F. J. Wallace and P. V. Langell, Bath Univ. of Technology. A complex flow system consisting of three interconnected volumes with piston controlled ports and an external exhaust system has been analyzed for a small, high-speed, crankcase compression 2-stroke-cycle gasoline engine using: 1. Quasi-steady flow equations for all port flows. 2. The method of characteristics for exhaust duct flow. 3. The unsteady flow energy equation, perfect gas state equation, and perfect mixing assumptions for all volumes. The overall correlation between theoretical and ex- perimental air consumption trends was found to be satisfactory. The inclusion of equations expressing changes in chemical composition of the gases leads to valuable insights into the scavenging behavior of the engine. Charge purity and trapping efficiency both decrease markedly with increasing engine speed, and can be improved only by careful exhaust and inlet tuning, which has not been attempted in the present experimental and theoretical program. The analysis provides a valuable tool in optimizing port areas and timings that otherwise could be achieved only by lengthy experimental trial and error procedures. The presence of boost chambers and ports in the engine is incidental for the purposes of this paper. 690135. Simulation of a Crankcase Scavenged, Two- Stroke, SI Engine and Comparisons with Ex- perimental Data. Roger B. Krieger, Institute Francais de Petrole.; Richard R. Booy, Out- board Marine Corp.; and P. S. Myers and O. A. Uyehara, University of Wisconsin. A detailed mathematical model of the thermodynamic events of a crankcase scavenged, two-stroke-cycle, spark- ignition engine is described. The engine is divided into three thermodynamic systems: the cylinder gases, the crankcase gases, and the inlet system gases. Energy balances, mass continuity equations, the ideal gas law, and thermodynamic property relationships are combined to give a set of coupled ordinary differential equations which describe the thermodynamic states encountered by the systems of the engine during one cycle of operation. A computer program is used to integrate the equations, starting with estimated initial thermodynamic conditions and estimated metal surface temperatures. The program iterates the cycle, adjusting the initial estimates, until the final conditions agree with the beginning conditions, that is, until a cycle results. The combustion process is described by dividing the cylinder gases into two systems, one corresponding to the burned region and the other to the unburned region. As combustion takes place, the boundary between the two systems moves, and mass is transferred from the unburned system to the burned system. The effects of dissociation of the combustion products are included by using empirical curve fits for the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of the combustion products of air and CnH2n fuel. The instantaneous mass flow through the engine is computed from stagnation conditions upstream and downstream of each flow restriction using steady flow coefficients. The motion of the reed is described by the solution of an equivalent spring -mass system. A theoretical relationship between scavenging efficien- cy and delivery ratio assuming perfect mixing is em- ployed. The delivery ratio actually used in this expression is multiplied by a factor chosen to give the best agreement between computed and experimental BHP. An arbitrary model which has characteristics in common with the real process is used to compute the vaporization rates during the cycle. The heat transfer surfaces for each system are divided into several different areas, each considered to be at one uniform temperature for the cycle. At the end of each iteration, a one-dimensional heat transfer rate balance is performed on each surface to obtain better estimates of the metal temperatures for the next cycle.</page><page sequence="22">690136-690141 Experimental data from the simulated engine are compared with the computed results.

Kazunari Komotori and Eiichi Watan- abe, Keio Univ. In order to increase the air charge of crankcase-scavenged 2-stroke-cycle engines, the relations between delivery ratio and engine speed were investigated on a rotary disc- valve inlet port engine and on a conventional piston-valve inlet port engine by varying through wide limits the angle area and timing of the inlet port. For the inlet port configuration tested on the first engine, it was found that there was an optimum cut angle of the rotary disc valve, which produced a certain angle area. To improve the delivery ratio characteristics at a given speed, it was not necessary to change this angle area; it was effective to change only the timing of the inlet port by shifting the disc valve around the crankshaft. For the piston-valve inlet port engine, the results showed that a wide, low port, which was also found to have a higher flow coefficient, produced a higher delivery ratio over the entire engine speed range than a narrow, high port. For the configuration tested (with no inlet or exhaust pipes), the maximum delivery ratio of the wide, low port was nearly in proportion to the effective crankcase stroke. 1969 SA E Transactions 690137. Study of Factors Affecting Carburetor Perfor- mance at Low Air Flows. K. C. Bier, J. J. Frankowski and D. K. Gonyou, Colt Industries, Holley Inc., Carburetor Div. Carburetor repeatability at idle was investigated both on the carburetor precision flow stand and on a chassis dynamometer equipped with exhaust emission test equip- ment. It was determined that some factors which signifi- cantly affect idle fuel flow repeatability on the carburetor test stand are: 1. Surface roughness of mating parts in the fuel bowl inlet system. 2. Inlet valve eccentricity. 3. Hydraulic shock in the fuel supply circuit. In addition, vehicle testing had demonstrated that carbon monoxide changes at idle may occur with constant fuel-air ratio due to changes in fuel temperature. Cycle tests have also shown a relationship between fuel tempera- ture and carbon monoxide levels. 690138. Process and Control for Producing Anti-Emission Carburetors. James E. Eberhardt and John A. Beck, Carter Carburetor Div., ACF Industries, Inc. The advent of emission controls for automobiles in California in 1966 triggered a period of expansion in carburetor technology. The industry's design and applica- tion engineers have been diligently developing carburetors that satisfy the early California and the 1968 nation-wide emission limits while maintaining performance char- acteristics. The present paper expains the need for improved carburetor uniformity; describes a program currently in operation to achieve uniformity; and illus- trates process changes being generated as a result of the program. 690139. Progress Report on the Development of Exhaust Manifold Reactors. E. N. Cantwell, II. T. Ro- senlund, W. J. Barth, F. L. Kinnear and S. W. Ross, E. I. duPont de Nemours and Co. Exhaust manifold reactor systems using air injection have been developed to control exhaust emission levels of a variety of vehicles to less than 50 ppm hydrocarbons and 0.5 per cent carbon monoxide. These systems have been shown to be compatible with other control systems used to reduce evaporative emissions and oxides of nitrogen. Manifold reactors were constructed which were suffi- ciently durable to control emissions effectively for 100,000 miles when run in accordance with the mileage accumula- tion schedule suggested in the Federal emission control device certification procedure. Problem areas hampering immediate application of reactor systems are described. Manifold reactor units are large and will not fit in the engine compartments of many vehicles; furthermore, some current engine configurations are not suited to the installation of reactors. Current reactor construction techniques are costly and materials of proven durability are relatively expensive. In addition, at the present stage of development, some carburetor enrichment is required which results in lower fuel economy. While preliminary work has indicated that these problems are probably amenable to solution, much additional development will be required. 1969 SA E Transactions 690141. Tune-up Inspection a Continuing Emission Con- trol. Gary W. Dickinson, Howard M. Ildvad and Raymond J. Bergin, General Motors Corp. This paper presents results of a program conducted during 1968 to evaluate the capability of an engine tune-up inspection to reduce exhaust emission levels of a car population. Tune-up parameters such as ignition timing and carburetor idle mixture and speed were evaluated. The test sample included 478 privately-owned passenger cars, 1959 through 1968 models, being operated in the Los Angeles area. As received average exhaust emission levels in this population were found to be 675 ppm HC and 2.73% CO. Adjustment of only idle speed and mixture reduced HC by 10 percent and CO by 16 percent, while oxides of nitrogen increased slightly. If applied to the car and light truck population of Los Angeles County, this tune-up program could result in reducing the daily output of 87</page><page sequence="23">690143-690146 88 hydrocarbon by 100 tons and carbon monoxide by 1050 tons. This in effect would advance the present automotive exhaust emission control program in California by 2 to 5 years. Considering the small annual cost per car, less than three dollars, the effectiveness in reducing exhaust emissions to the atmosphere, and the high customer acceptance of the adjustments at 93 percent, this type annual minor tune-up approach is ideal for current statewide programs of emission control from the auto- mobile. 690143. Evolving Role of the Engineering Profession in Motor Vehicle Safety. Robert Brenner, National Highway Safety Bureau. The respective responsibilities of industry and Govern- ment to improve vehicle safety performance are indisputa- ble. The available resources to meet these responsibilities including manpower, facilities, and budgets are very limited. A cooperative division of workload is strongly indica- ted, starting with planning for ways and means whereby both groups can contribute to an ever-broadening fund of knowledge in vehicle safety performance without com- promising their diverse responsibilities. This highlights the evolving roles of the engineering profession in motor vehicle safety: to work toward the full and efficient utilization of our nation's resources for expanding the fund of knowledge on vehicle safety performance. Engineers are members of a profession historically dedicated to the betterment of mankind. The trust is the same whether exercised in industry, Government, or the academic world. These groups need not be reluctant to exchange factual information. They need not fear facts, only ignorance of facts. No less vital is the need to work in unison to fill the many gaps in our present understanding of vehicle safety performance, to augment the fund of knowledge which industry and Government alike must draw upon to make reasonable and rational decisions in their respective areas of public trust. 690144. Automotive Engineering Effectiveness in State and Community Highway Safety Programs. B. M. Crittenden, Highway Safety Programs Service, National Highway Safety Bureau. The staff of the Motor Vehicle Safety Performance Service will continue to work with the automotive industry in its efforts to design a better and safer car. The results of the combined efforts of industry will be a vehicle with reduced crash potential, improved crashworthiness to reduce the effects of highway crashes on occupants and pedestrians and which will facilitate post crash activities. Those in the Highway Safety Programs Service are working hard to increase crash avoidance capabilities of drivers and pedestrians on our streets and highways, to mitigate the effects of crashes on drivers, passengers, and pedestrians by creating a "forgiving" highway envi- ronment and by improving the survivability opportunities of those who become casualties. The time has long since passed when we can transfer responsibility for vehicle and highway safety to others. No longer can we blame only the "nut behind the wheel." We are not relieved of our responsibility to protect the occupants of vehicles, or others outside the vehicle who may be involved. The components of highway safety are inseparable, and cooperative effort is needed. We must realize and accept our moral responsibility to improve highway safety. We must act to improve conditions where we have the opportunity to do so. Success in each area will compound and generate new successes in the other. The result will be achievement of our common goal: the reduction of frequency and severity of highway crashes and of the economic losses and human suffering which inevitably accompany these crashes. 690145. Planning for Quality in Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. H. M. Jacklin, Jr., Motor Vehicle Safety Performance Service, National Highway Safety Bureau. The Motor Vehicle Safety Performance Service is con- cerned with all three phases of motor vehicle safety: 1.The pre-crash phase (accident avoidance). 2. The crash phase (crash-injury reduction). 3. The post-crash phase (post-crash factors). In the accident avoidance phase, we are striving to assure that the consumer will be furnished with every increasing safety performance capability with respect to (a) visibility, (b) lighting, (c) brakes, (d) handling char- acteristics, (e) tires, (f) communications, (g) controls, (h) reliability, and (i) general vehicle performance. In the crash-injury reduction phase, we are striving to assure that the consumer will be furnished with every increasing safety performance capability involving (a) active and passive occupant restraints, (b) glazing, (c) crashworthiness of the passenger compartment, (d) struc- tural integrity, (e) crash energy absorption. Let us assume that the improvements in the crash- injury reduction features of the vehicle resulted in the occupants surviving the crash. Our goals are to assure that the consumer will be furnished with every increasing crash survivability safety performance capability with respect to (a) not being trapped in the vehicle, (b) not being burned or asphyxiated, (c) not being drowned, and (d) not having injuries compounded in being rescued from the vehicle. We are also concerned with assuring compliance with these standards by the motor vehicle and the equipment manufacturers as well as with the control of safety defects through identifying and reviewing safety defects and monitoring defect notification campaigns. 690146. Research and Development Efforts in Support of the Rule-Making Process. John T. Holloway,</page><page sequence="24">690147-690151 National Highway Safety Inst., National High- way Safety Bureau. The National Highway Safety Institute conducts or sponsors the research, development, testing and evalua- tion required to support the National Highway Safety Bureau administration of the provisions of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 and the Highway Safety Act of 1966. Sub-elements of Institute are responsible for the related areas of safety manpower development, demonstration projects, technical documen- tation, in-depth accident investigation and analysis, and research and test facilities. The Institute has the job of managing and directing research, development, testing and evaluation contract activities. 690147. Issues of Complying with Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards and Other Requirements. Fran- cis Armstrong, National Highway Safety Bu- reau, Federal Highway Administration, U.S. Dept. of Trans. The implications of applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Performance Standards issued under provisions of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 and other provisions of this law relating to defects of notification and corrective recall campaigns are discussed. Bureau action is taken in the following areas: manufac- turer's certification, defects review, the repair and "after- market," and the responsibility of the parts manufacturer. 690148. Potential of the Air Cushion Vehicle for Off-Road Mobility. O. Douglas and C. E. Burr, Bell Aerosystems Co. Some of the conditions encountered in off-road mobility are examined and the inherent abilities of the air cushion vehicle to enhance mobility in these conditions are outlined. A marked degree of improvement in operating efficiency has been attained through the development of seals, control power, propulsion, and overall refinement. Specific configurations for both civilian and military tasks have been built and operated effectively. Analysis of an amphibious landing operation produces a ready assess- ment of the applicability of the vehicle to Southeast Asia beach areas and analysis of several typical missions conducted in South Vietnam shows a high degree of applicability in a widely varied terrain. 690149. Design and Development of the Twister Testbed. W. Brannon, R. H. David, W. Hodges, Jr. and W. R. Janowski, Ground Vehicle Systems, Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. A new, high-performance ground vehicle known as Twister has been built and tested. The vehicle incor- porates features designed to meet military needs for a substantial increase in cross-country speed, all-terrain mobility, and platform stability. Twister design is based upon a dual body joined by a unique pivot yoke permitting three degrees of freedom between the bodies. Significant departures from current practice have been made in the application of a dual power supply, individual walking beam suspension, coordinated Ackerman/yaw steer and unique tire design and application. Aspects of the Twister development program presen- ted in this paper include the design and development of a full-scale testbed and the results of the three years of test operations in both engineering and natural terrain environments. 690150. On the Prediction of Off-Road Vehicle System Mobility. G. E. Bartlett, M. R. Belsdorf, J. N. Deutschman and R. L. Smith, Cornell Aero- nautical Lab., Inc. Rationale is presented for improved off-road mobility performance prediction capability through mathematical modeling of the vehicle-terrain system. A hybrid model is described which combines the advantages of real time analog computation for vehicle dynamics with versatile digital function generation for terrain. The vehicle, either wheeled or tracked, is modeled as a rigid body with 5 deg of hull freedom and with a realistic suspension system (appropriate for the running gear) and power train. Model resullts are presented for a representative wheeled vehicle traversing off-road terrain. Also discussed are extensions of model capability ot predict performance of advanced vehicle concepts, and to introduce the driver "into the loop" via a driving simulator which provides visual and motion cues. 1969 SA E Transactions 690151. A Statistical Approach of Determining Cross- Country Speed. Roger R. Gay and Willard P. Harju, Systems Concept Div., Dev. and Eng. Directorate, U.S. Army Tank- Automoti ve Com- mand. The problem of quantifying the cross-country speed capability of military vehicles is discussed. While numer- ous tests have been run to evaluate various aspects of cross-country speed, such as obstacle crossing capability and maximum speed over a specified standard course, quantitative evaluation of the total man-machine system has only been superficially attempted. Recognizing the complex interactions of the man-machine system within various environments, the project was designed specif- ically to allow separation of various factors in order to determine the relative cross-country performance of vehicles. Two separate tests were established. The first test determined the relative cross-country performance of nine different vehicles by utilizing 18 drivers and 27 test courses in three varied terrains for a total of 563 test runs. Interesting ancillary results indicated the effects that experience and learning have on driver performance and to what extent variations among drivers influence the outcome of a vehicle test. The second test quantified the effect of varying driver's vision on the cross-country performance of an armored, tracklaying vehicle. 89</page><page sequence="25">690152-690157 90 The test vehicle was driven in three distinct vision configurations. Testing involved 81 runs by nine drivers over nine courses on a single terrain. In both tests the data consisted of the average time required for the vehicle to travel between two established points with a free path in between. Terrain areas were selected to minimize the go/no-go obstacles while still requiring rigorous cross-country operation. Due to time limitations only preliminary results are presented for the second test program. 690152. The Air-Cell Suspension System - A Solution to Off-Road Mobility Problems. G. H. Howe and C. G. Wells, LTV Aerospace Corp. The air cell track/suspension concept originally applied to the pneumatic all-terrain amphibian vehicle is shown to offer a unique solution to off-road mobility problems of tactical vehicles. Analog computer simulation techniques were employed to determine ride characteristics and experiments with scaled models were conducted to analyze air cell performance in water and soft soils. This paper covers current efforts to develop and perfect the air cell concept, concentrating on analytical studies and recent significant design improvements that promise improved suspension capabilities. 690153. Elliptical Wheel Concepts. W. R. Herling and E. G. Markow, Grumman Aircraft Engrg. Corp. Designing wheels for vehicle operation on a variety of soil conditions has been approached in several ways. Each method generally tries to develop a large ground contact area to minimize soil bearing pressure and motion resistance. Tracks and large diameter wheels are com- monly used to cope with off-road driving conditions. While they can effectively deal with the soil mechanics aspect of the problem, tracks and large wheels in certain design applications are unacceptable solutions because of their required size and weight. As an off-the-road locomotion device a hybrid design is proposed that provides the required large soil bearing area and also approaches the stability and efficiency of a circular spoked wheel. Several models of this device have been built and tested, the latest of which is currently being developed under contract from the U. S. Army Tank- Automotive Command. 690154. Improved Methods of Evaluating Modern Gear Lubricants. R. I. Potter, J. C. Gagliardi, W. J. Skutnick and O. K. Walthall, Ford Motor Co. Three test methods used to evaluate rear axle lubricants are described: the Ford motored rear-axle test, the high-speed Timken test, and the rear-axle score test. In each instance, results are described, including the develop- ment of new rear axle test methods. Lubricants success- fully completing these tests are considered for further evaluation. 690155. Evaluation of a Radiometric Method of Deter- mining Engine Oil Economy. Roger C. Knop, Muskegon Piston Ring Co. The adaptation of the bromine 82 radiometric method of measuring oil economy to piston ring research and development testing is discussed. Comparisons are made with the conventional drain and weigh measurement method, showing that the radiometric method decreases testing time, while giving more and precise data. The radiometric method is uniquely capable of measuring the oil economy of each bank of a V-8 engine separately. Two banks of an engine do not have the same oil economy, but by establishing proper oil economy baselines for each bank, split engine tests could be conducted. Using data obtained by the radiometric method, it was found that the engine break-in period can be reduced from 11 to 6 hr. The radiometric method shows high oil economy under steady state low speed, high manifold vacuum engine operating conditions. Initially such data appeared questionable, but comparisons with drain and weigh oil economy, plus the use of an exhaust afterburner, shows the radiometric data to be correct. The use of special nonleaded fuel is discussed, as well as personnel radiation exposure experiences. 690156. Heating Effects in the Cold Cranking Simulator. F. F. Tao and J. K. Appeldoorn, Esso Res. and Engrg. Co. A mathematical study has been made of the extent of viscous heating in the cold-cranking simulator. In all cases, the temperature rise is so small that it can be neglected. The instrument is therefore suitable for use as a practical viscometer within the range of 10-80 poise. The operating shear stress is constant at about 700,000 dynes/sq cm which is high enough to bring about almost complete shear thinning of a polymer- thickened (10W-30) oil. Discussion: W. A.

Stewart, C. R. Spohn and W. A. P. Meyer, Gulf Res. and Dev. Co. The influence of lubricating oil formulation on the winter hot-starting torque requirements of an automotive engine was investigated in a four-part study. Commercial multi- grade oils, V.l. improved oils, oils containing oiliness agents, and experimental oils in the new and used condition were evaluated for their low-speed, hot cranking torque requirements. These torque requirements were determined using a test stand engine equipped to measure cranking torques at selected cranking speeds from 5 to 236 rpm. The ASTM D 445 viscosities at 210 F were shown to</page><page sequence="26">690158-690169 be inadequate for predicting the low-speed, hot cranking torque requirements of the oils evaluated in this study. Several oiliness agents effectively reduced the low speed, hot cranking torque requirements of a crankcase oil. Discussion: W. W. Crouse, W. A. Wright; Sun Oil Co.; R. L.

Marshall, Texaco, Inc. The automated fuel injector shear stability tester, a simple mechanical bench test for evaluating shear stability of polymer-containing oils, is described. Its advantages include unattended operation, fast, repeatable results, relatively small sample size requirement, and availability of several levels of shearing severity. The test shows good agreement with viscosity loss due to shear for various polymer types in a motored engine and in field tests of automotive crankcase oils. Good correlation with road test data for automotive transmission fluids is also shown. 690160. Engine Speed Control Requirements for Utility Vehicles. Edward L. Dold, Philadelphia Elee. Co. Operators of utility vehicles have need for special engine speed controls. Recently acquired data on pump delivery rate, while preliminary in nature, point to the damage caused by engine overspeed while operating pto-driven hydraulic pumps. Good engine speed-control devices must not only protect the engine itself, but must protect the pumps of high powered hydraulic systems. Other requirements for speed control on utility vehicles are that they be simple, dependable, maintenance free, and adaptable. 690161. Review of Throttle Controls. Robert G. Bakula, McCabe-Powers Body Co. The utility truck field requires many types of throttle controls, both remote and automatic, for the vehicle engine and auxiliary power source. This article reviews these applications from the aerial bucket truck used on overhead high voltage line work, to the underground equipment unit burying or reclaiming cable. 690163. Concepts of Human Factors Engineering. J. B. Liljedahl and E. J. McCormick, Purdue Univ. The necessity for designing farm and industrial tractors which have logical, rather than arbitrary, safety features is emphasized. The paper urges those who buy and use farm equipment to exercise their influence on tractor design by purchasing only those vehicles which meet recommended standards for safety and construction. 690164. Truck Emission Control. T. F. Havens, Motor Truck Engrg. Dept., International Harvester Co. Control of emission components from vehicles is directed initially at the largest class of vehicles, passenger cars, and light trucks. Subsequent application of control systems to heavy trucks recognizes the peculiar use factors of the heavier vehicles. Control systems in customer use must receive proper maintenance to insure continued emission control. 690165. Application of Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards to Public Utility Vehicles. R. R. Noble, Dodge Truck Operations, Chrysler Corp. Federal Safety Standards applicable to trucks are de- scribed in this paper. The major requirements of the nine truck standards effective on Jan. 1, 1969 are discussed as applied to complete vehicles, chassis-cab vehicles, and chassis-cowl and stripped chassis units which by sub- sequent modification, alternation, or addition are develop- ed into vehicles specifically utilized in public utility service. 1969 SA E Transactions 690166. Experiments on Effects of Atmospheric Condi- tions on the Performance of an Automotive Gasoline Engine. Keitaro Nakajima, Kazuo Shinoda and Kuniyasu Onoda, Engine Engrg. Dept., Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. A series of experiments have been carried out to clarify several problems of the gasoline engine: 1.How do atmospheric conditions affect the perfor- mance of automotive gasoline engines? 2. How should the engine be tuned to get the best performance under various atmospheric conditions? 3. What is the best way to correct the observed performance to that under standard atmospheric condi- tions? How much accuracy will be achieved by this method? Various atmospheric conditions have been applied to a 4-stroke cycle 4-cyl gasoline engine in the laboratory, and dynamometer tests have been conducted at wide open throttle. Results obtained are given and discussed in this paper. Discussion: Joseph H. Budd; Deere &amp; Co.; Authors' closure 1969 SA E Transactions 690169. Design and Performance Characteristics of Hy- brid Vehicle Power Train. George H. Gelb, Neal A. Richardson, T. C. Wang and Robert S. DeWolf, Power Systems Div., Systems Group, TRW, Inc. An analysis was carried out to determine the design requirements and performance characteristics of a hybrid vehicle containing an internal combustion engine, bat- teries, generator, traction motor, and power conditioning. Consideration of urban and high speed highway operation leads to special requirements for a high power density battery. Detailed modeling and simulation of power train components and their interfaces on an analog/digital computer allowed an evaluation of the total vehicle 91</page><page sequence="27">690170-690179 92 system when driven in urban traffic. Results show that presently available components or those which could be developed in the near term can be combined to make an attractive vehicle propulsion system offering improved fuel economy. 690170. Advanced Door-to-Door System for Interurban Transportation. Richard K. Boyd, Steven E. Plotkin and Kenneth K. Tang, TRW Systems Group. Because of its privacy, convenience, and flexibility, the private automobile deserves serious consideration as an element of any future door-to-door, interurban trans- portation system. This paper presents a description of a possible candidate system wherein automobiles as we know them today are used in conjunction with other major sub- systems to provide high-speed, high-capacity, and high- safety interurban transportation. The system incorporates several advanced subsystem concepts, including a deterministic control system, a functional train headway policy, high-speed switching, and a unique station layout. 690172. "In-Car" Fatigue Data Acquisition. F. R. Holli- day and C. R. Allmen, Engrg. Staff, Chrysler Corp. In-car measurement of vehicle loads and stresses is a basic step in solving fatigue design problems associated with passenger cars. The application includes measuring systems and techniques for evaluating fatigue design problems related to energy-absorbing steering columns and automotive gas turbines. 690173. Radio Telemetry Applied to Vehicle Handling Tests. Marvin K. Stark, Proving Ground Sec- tion, General Motors Corp. The development of radio telemetry instrumentation systems in the aircraft and missile fields has provided the automotive test engineer with a useful measurement tool.

Application of Variable Depth Siderail to Heavy Truck Frames. G. C. Carver, A. O. Smith Corp. The heavy truck frame design engineer is faced with many factors when selecting a frame siderail. These factors must be weighed if the siderail is for one truck for a special application, or for a family of frames for tens of thousands of trucks involving the entire spectrum of heavy truck usage. In this paper the various parameters of side bar selection are explored, and a lighter, less expensive design presented for higher gvw siderail applications. 1969 SA E Transactions 690175. Stresses and Deflections in Truck Side Rail Attachments. D. W. Sherman, Dana Corp. Although the carrying capacity of truck side rails is directly related to their cross-sectional properties, and limited thereby, they must be adequately positioned and stabilized by "attachments" if their full potential is to be realized. Furthermore, while the capacity off a truck frame cannot exceed the capability of its rails, such value is sometimes not achieved. Frame rails do fail at lesser values, at points other than maximum bending stress. Why this happens and how it affects designers is discussed in detail with special emphasis on the structural nature of frame parts; primary input forces; stress concentration; action of flat surfaces; and side load generation and influences. Illustrations graphically depict the small but destructive distortions that can occur at attachment points. 690176. Truck Frame Side Rail Buckling Stresses. Lewis F. McNitt, Midland Frame Div., Midland-Ross Corp. The critical buckling stress of a given truck frame side rail flange is dependent upon the magnitude and stress distribution across the flange. This distribution is a function of the method of load application, crossmember spacing, and the type of attachment between the cross- member and frame side rail. The tests conducted during this program revealed that based upon the specimens tested they could be made to carry 50% more load for the same overall structural weight by selecting the proper loading system and by choosing the proper crossmember spacing. 690178. Nylon 11 Composites for the Automotive Indus- try. J. Bedarida and G. Raveau, Aquitaine- Organico, Sub., Société Nationale des Petroles d'Aquitaine. The increasing use of polyamides, in particular Nylon 11, in automobiles is discussed. By composite formulations, Nylon 1 1, in addition to providing the usual advantages of nylon, provides new areas of application, such as fuel lines, timing belts, metal coatings, etc. Further, other types of composites, such as with polyurethane or polyethylene, provide the automotive industry with materials for fabricated parts, such as reinforced hoses, hydraulic brakes and rotomoulded tanks. 690179. Realistic Measures of Performance of Glass Reinforced High Density Polyethylene. Yeates Conwell and David S. Stotz, E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co. Inc. The increasing use of plastics as strong, load-bearing materials in industry has raised certain questions about the standard tests used to describe their performance. Even after all of these tests have been run, there are still several unanswered questions. How will the fabricated part stand up under impacts in service? What kind of melt flow can be expected in the normal injection molding</page><page sequence="28">690180-690184 process? Will increasing glass content improve stress crack resistance? What is the effect of fiber orientation on material properties? These are the questions that this paper attempts to deal with in terms of Alathon glass-fiber-reinforced high-density polyethylene. Because they represent difficult areas of interpretation, they are in need of more attention. Other standard test results for the Du Pont family of glass-reinforced high-density polyethylene resins are also presented. 1969 SA E Transactions 690180. New Digital Method for Measuring Gas Flow Velocity by Electric Discharge. Shunichi Ohi- gashi, Yoshisuke Hamamoto and Seiichi Tana- be, Department of Mechanical Engrg., Kyoto Univ. A new measuring technique of gas stream velocity has been developed, based on the phenomenon that the path of an electric discharge moves downstream under the influence of the gas stream. A probe (a thin conductive wire grounded by a resistance) is placed at a fixed distance downstream from the electrodes. When the discharge path arrives at the probe, the probe voltage rises rapidly. By means of measuring the time interval elapsing between the beginning of the spark and the rising of probe voltage, the stream velocity can be determined by a formula, con- taining a constant K. As the result of preliminary tests, it was confirmed that the constant K is independent of distance downstream of the probe from the electrodes, intensity of turbulence, temperature, and pressure of flowing gases, and depends only on the electrode spacing. The digital measurement of the time interval can be made easily. This technique can be applied not only to a steady flow but also to a pulsating flow such as that in the inlet and exhaust pipe or the air flow in the cylinder of the internal combustion engine. In this paper, the details of the measuring technique and some results obtained by applying this technique to the inlet flow, exhaust flow, and air flow in the cylinder of two-stroke cycle spark-ignition engines are described. 690181. The Development and Evaluation of an Electronic Indicated Horsepower Meter. John W. Alyea, Raychem Corp.; and O. A. Uyehara and P. S. Myers, Mechanical Eng. Dept., University of Wisconsin. A complete electronic system for accurately and contin- uously measuring the indicated power of a reciprocating engine is presented in this paper. This includes an analog switching technique for separating the pumping power of a four-stroke cycle engine from the net cycle output. An analysis and evaluation of the individual compo- nents and circuits composing the complete instrument is made to determine the accuracy and limitations of the system and techniques used. The measurement of cylinder pressure, the weakest link in the entire system, is analyzed in detail to determine the pressure measuring require- ments for the measurement of indicated power and the ability of some commercially available analog pressure transducers to meet these requirements. Data from a single-cylinder, CFR, spark-ignition engine are presented and used both as a means of evaluating the instrument and pressure transducers as well as to supply information on engine friction.

The Willans line represents the relationship between fuel energy input and engine output. Extrapolation to a zero line of fuel input provides a useful approximation of the mechanical losses. Linearity of these curves is assumed in the range from low load downward to a hypothetical zero value of the indicated work. A critical analysis revealed that these lines must have a continued curvature and also that the location of the zero point of indicated power does not coincide with zero fuel input. The paper suggests corrections and defines a directional field which may improve the accuracy of the loss analysis. 690183. Field Experience with the Energy Absorbing Steering Column. L. C. Lundstrom, General Motors Corp.; and W. G. Cichowski, General Motors Proving Ground. General Motors introduced in its 1967 passenger cars the energy absorbing steering column, which was evaluated in the laboratory and in prototype vehicles before its introduction to the public. A statistical study of steering control system performance has been conducted on 3000 1968 General Motors vehicles which were involved in accidents. This field accident study is then compared with raw accident data obtained from Automotive Crash Injury Research. Various other aspects of the performance of the energy absorbing steering column are investigated in this summary of field accident experience. 1969 SA E Transactions 690184. Accident Investigations of the Performance Char- acteristics of Energy Absorbing Steering Col- umns. Donald F. Huelke, Department of Anat- omy, Medical School, Univ. of Michigan.; and William A. Chewning, Highway Safety Res. Inst., Univ. of Michigan. Investigations of 1967 and 1968 model cars indicate that the injuries sustained by driver impacts to the steering assembly are markedly reduced because of the energy- absorbing steering column. Drivers, however, are sus- taining facial injuries from impact to the steering wheel rim even in low-speed crashes. In more severe head-on collisions, the driver is compressing the energy-absorbing column and is striking his face on the upper padded instrument panel in front of the steering wheel. Relatively severe facial fractures are sustained by impacting this portion of the panel. 93</page><page sequence="29">690185-690191 94 690185. Correlation of Accident and Laboratory Impacts to Energy- Absorbing Steering Assemblies. L. M. Patrick and D. J. Van Kirk, Biomechanics Research Center, Wayne State University. Data are presented for 19 frontal-force collisions involving vehicles with collapsible steering columns with collision severity rating from minor to very severe (1-7) and an injury severity index from minor to fatal. Injury results are compared to laboratory experiments in which a force of 1800 lb distributed over the rim and hub was measured for a fairly stiff wheel and collapsible column combination. When the steering wheel did not deform excessively and the force reached the 1800 lb level as evidenced by column collapse, there were no serious thoracic injuries. Gross deformation of the steering wheel with exposed sharp spoke ends or small diameter hub resulted in serious abdominal and thoracic injuries. Two cases of hood intrusion are presented, each of which resulted in fatalities. 690186. Solar Heat Reflecting Coatings. Charles F. Pickett, U. S. Army Coating and Chemical Lab. Tests conducted at the U. S. Army Coating and Chemical Lab., Aberdeen Proving Ground, indicate that some pigments are better than others in reducing heat buildup on painted surfaces from solar radiation. Special tests were also conducted to check the application of paint on automobile surfaces, using 12 automobile finishes found on 1969 models. Results reveal that both light and dark colored paints can be formulated to reduce solar radiation heat buildup without impairing the durability of the finish or adding to production costs. 690187. Urethane Paint Technology. Paul Rosenberg, Midland Division, The Dexter Corp. The field of polyurethane chemistry as it applies to paint technology is reviewed. The types of polyisocyanates, reactive resins, and modifying materials commonly used in formulating industrial urethane coatings and the relationships these compounds have to formulating, compositional performance and film properties and performance is discussed. Application techniques, storing and handling consid- erations, and the toxicity of raw materials used in industrial coatings are also discussed. End use applications of urethane coatings in a spectrum of markets and present usage on integral skin polyurethane and polycarbonate parts which are used in present automotive application are described. 1969 SA E Transactions 690188. Lockheed-Georgia Low Speed Wind Tunnel - Some Implication to Automotive Aerodynamics. J. B. Cummings, Lockheed-Georgia Co. A brief description of the Lockheed-Georgia low-speed wind tunnel includes discussions of facility characteristics, such as the test section sizes, speed ranges, readout system capability, balance system limits, and instrumentation hookup capability and versatility. Accessory equipment is also described as it can support wind tunnel testing of automotive vehicles. 690189. A Method of Estimating Automobile Drag Coef- ficients. R. G. S. White, Motor Industry Re- search Association. A method of estimating the drag coefficient of a motor vehicle to an accuracy of about ± 7% is presented. In this method, the vehicle is divided into nine feature categories, and rating numbers are assigned to each category depending on the merits or demerits of the particular design. The method is not intended to be a substitute for wind tunnel testing, but to provide guide lines for stylists so that they can avoid undesirable body features in the early stages of design. 1969 SA E Transactions 690190. Marine Corps Marginal Terrain Vehicle XM 759. R. C. Tashjian and J. A. Simmons, U. S. Marine Corps. The U. S. Marine Corps, in conjunction with the U. S. Army, is developing a marginal terrain vehicle, based on the airoll principle, to replace the M76 and Ml 16 vehicles. The first phase of the XM759 development program established the overall vehicle configuration. Following approval of the basic design, detail design and pilot fabrication were developed. Initial testing was considered unsatisfactory. However, after tire modifications involving a Chevron tread design, slope-climbing capability was achieved with no reduction in mobility. Extensive mobility tests have verified that the marginal terrain vehicle can negotiate the most extreme soft soil conditions. 690191. Exploring The Potential of a Quadruped. Ralph S. Mosher, General Electric Company. Human nature abounds with examples of high perfor- mance ambulation. Wheels and tracks work fine, but how about the use of legs for the special cases where wheels and tracks won't work? A most pertinent difficulty in design is caused by the need for a complex control system, as represented in the neurological control system of animals. Machines can be made to perform with human-like ability and intelligence by simply causing the machine to mimic operator actions and reflect force information back to the operator. This force and position sensing function must include spatial correspondence. This allows the adaptive, reflex control of man to be transmitted directly to the machine. Such a closely coordinated man-machine system will exploit the union of man's superbly integrated sensory system with the tremendous power potential of machinery. For the purpose of solving special off-the-road locomotion problems, a 3000-lb research test bed model of a quadruped is being built applying this man-machine control concept.</page><page sequence="30">690192-690196 Plans are now underway for preliminary testing to show maneuvering capability. Based on preliminary test results, additional develop- ment programs may be planned. The objective of any new programs will be to extend the quadruped capabilities and demonstrate practicality in field applications. 1969 SA E Transactions 690192. Interactive Computer-Graphics as an Engineering Tool. W. L. Johnson, Technical Computer Services, Ford Motor Co. The majority of facilities using interactive graphics are located in research environments at universities, govern- ment-supported research houses and industry research centers. A few aircraft firms are using graphics in design and production situations, but under circumstances where costs are subordinate to delivery schedules, and other considerations. More recently a few corporations have developed applications of interactive graphics in cost- conscious situations (notably, Motorola in integrated circuit design and Beckman Instruments in optical design), but these have been highly specialized applica- tions. In none of these installations is the cathode ray tube display a tool available to the general user. The high cost of this equipment and the slow emergence of truly powerful and general time-sharing systems have been partially responsible for this situation. Also partly responsible is the relatively low resolution of the cathode ray tubes and the lack of a fast, convenient, high-resolution graphic input device. These deficiencies result in the cathode ray tubes being inconvenient to use in conjunction with engineering drawings, which represent the major commodity of the other graphic devices. This paper discusses the efforts at Ford to develop a graphic facility which is both versatile and easily used and to find and exploit appropriate applications, thus making interactive computer-graphics a general engineering tool. 690193. Design of Production Windshields with Computer Graphics. Eric Norton, Jr., Methods Eng. Dept., General Motors Corp. The approach employed by GM Styling Staff personnel in developing automobile windshields from the daylight opening line with computer graphics is explained. The manual method for developing windshields is examined first. This is followed by a brief resume of the major software and hardware components used by the wind- shield program in the DAC-I (design augmented by computers) system. The general procedure for producing an automobile windshield with computer graphics is then presented. Conclusions based on the use and potential of computer graphics in a production environment and the ability of designers to relate to the graphic console terminates the report. 690194. Windshield Wiper System Design by Computer Graphics. Larry L. Saathoff, Chevrolet Motor Div., GMC. A Computer Graphics Design System (CGDS) has been developed that has extensive industrial design capabilities. This paper describes how the system is used for designing windshields and windshield wiper systems by using automatic drafting machine techniques combined with a graphics computer approach. As applied to this paper, its capabilities include windshield surfacing, eye range contour development, eye range area calculation, wiper pattern development, and calculation of the actual area wiped. By comparing CGDS to manual drafting methods, the results indicate that the CGDS approach is a commercially practical concept of design that has many substantial economic advantages over conventional draft- ing methods. 690195. Application of Computer Graphics in Aircraft Design. R. Q. Boyles, Lockheed-Georgia Co., Div., Lockheed Aircraft Corp. The development of interactive, graphic display devices as interfaces between engineers and computers has opened a new era in man-computer synergetics. Merging the attributes of the digital computer with those of the human in an environment in which there is a freely flowing interchange of information promises great improvements in creativity and productivity. A program developed as a prototype computercentric engineering system at the Lockheed-Georgia Research Laboratory is demonstrating this capability. This program encompasses the aircraft preliminary design process. It provides a capability to evolve rapidly and refine aircraft configurations by graphically and numerically defining aircraft components through interactive, on-line computer graphic display devices and unique, surface definition programs; to direct the computer in analyses of the components or configurations; and to review the results of the analyses directly on the computer-driven display. Iterations to investigate the effects of modifications to component design, configuration arrangement, missions parameters, or analytical methods are possible at any time throughout the process. A time compression of the preliminary design process of up to ten-to-one is one goal of the program. This paper describes and illustrates the operation of this prototype system and comments on some of the implications of the concept to future engineering proc- esses. 690196. Thermal Scale Modeling of Spacecraft. V. G. Klockzien and R. L. Shannon, Space Div., Boeing Co. The utilization of scale models in the development of spacecraft thermal control systems is discussed. The criteria necessary to establish thermal similitude are developed as well as techniques for designing scaled thermal models. The application of thermal similitude criteria in experimental programs designed to verify the similitude criteria is reviewed. Several research programs which have applied thermal scale modeling to a radiation- 95</page><page sequence="31">690197-690204 96 conduction heat transfer system (unmanned spacecraft) and to a radiation-conduction-convection heat transfer system (manned spacecraft) are reviewed and evaluated. Recommendations as to the utilization of thermally scaled models are made, along with a discussion of the limita- tions on the use of such models. Finally, recommenda- tions are made for further research. 1969 SA E Transactions 690197. Combined Radiation and Conduction Heat Trans- fer: Application in Design. Dudley G. McCon- nell, Lewis Research Center, NASA. The heat equation for combined radiation and conduction transfer, applied to a plane stratified absorbing-emitting medium is presented. Two special cases are discussed. In the first case, the solution for the temperature profile around an opaque hollow sphere is presented. The sphere is subject to external radiation; it has arbitrary conduc- tance and variable surface optical properties. This case shows the individual and combined effects of the conduc- tance parameter, mu, and the surface radiative properties, absorptance and emittance. The second case concerns temperature profile and heat transfer through a layer of solid condensed gas. Here the temperature profile shows that effect of volume absorption is much like that of a distributed heat source. The author also discusses the diffusion approximation and some recent modifications to include conduction. 690198. Engineering Technique to Optimize a Constant Thickness Fin with Arbitrarily Distributed Heat Sources. A. J. Gopin, Space Systems Div., Hughes Aircraft Co. An approximate physical model is postulated in order to simplify the boundary conditions associated with a fin of uniform thickness and arbitrarily distributed heat sources. Each heat source and adjacent portion of the fin is considered independently and a closed form solution of the field equation is derived. The solution is expressed in terms of the modified Bessel functions of the first and second kind. Use of the solution to the approximate model, along with thermal engineering design criteria, permits a linear combination of the independent portions of the fin in order to select the optimum over-all fin geometry. The validity of the approximate model is verified by comparisons with test data. Comparisons are also made with standard lumped-node finite difference analysis. 1969 SA E Transactions 690199. Some Aspects of Thermal Modeling Theory and Analysis as Applied to Spacecraft Temperature Control. Robert D. Karam and Robert J. Eby, Fairchild Hiller Space and Electronics Systems. A description of digital computer methods and numerical techniques which are used in evaluating temperature distributions in spacecraft structures is presented. The theory and application of thermal modeling from the point of view of comparing the accuracy of simplified analytical models with zonal and nodal methods are discussed, and an example is given to illustrate the general theory. 690201. Fluid and Thermodynamic Modeling of a Nuclear Rocket Vehicle. D. E. Westerheide, R. C. Erick- son and F. P. Kirkland, Fort Worth Div., General Dynamics Corp. The design of a nuclear rocket vehicle requires a thorough understanding of the fluid and thermodynamic behavior of the liquid-hydrogen propellant under severe envi- ronmental conditions, including nuclear radiation. To gain a better understanding of this behavior, ground testing under simulated conditions is required. Adequate simulation of most individual phenomena can be achieved by careful selection of test conditions. This selection is based on derived nondimensional groups. Similarity analyses were performed to define the nondimensional groups and boundary conditions neces- sary for simulating the liquid-hydrogen-propellant be- havior of a nuclear rocket vehicle. The modeling tech- niques-dimensional analyses and normalization of gov- erning equations-are described in detail, and the use of the derived scaling groups in developing a test design is demonstrated. 690202. Generalized Approach to the Thermal Analysis of Orbiting Spacecraft. Robert F. Greene, Jr., Richard E. Turner and Nathan D. Watson, Langley Res. Center, NASA. A generalized approach used in the thermal analysis of complex orbiting spacecraft is presented. The approach, consisting of the development of a mathematical model and its refinement, using verification testing, has allowed close predictions of actual spacecraft temperatures during flight. The application of this approach in the analysis of the Injun V (Explorer 40) spacecraft is presented as an example. 690203. A Hybrid Battery System for Electric Vehicle Propulsion. George A. Dalin and Frederick P. Kober, Yardney Electric Corp. A hybrid battery consisting of paralleled air-zinc and nickel-zinc batteries is considered for propulsion of electric vehicles. The operating lives of these couples in relationship to catalyst and separator composition are discussed. Performance data are presented and used to calculate energy density and power density as a function of the relative sizes of the two component batteries. 690204. A Mechanically Rechargeable 1-KW Zinc-Air Battery. Romeo R. Witherspoon, Electrochem- istry Dept., Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. Although the zinc-air battery system has been known for many years for its excellent energy storage characteristics (50-60 Whr/lb), the system has been limited in its applications by the low power output capability (less than</page><page sequence="32">690205-690210 1.0 W/lb). More recently, efforts have been made to increase the power output and maintain the good energy storage characteristics of this system. A mechanically rechargeable, 1-kW zinc-air battery has been designed, built, and tested which achieved a power density of 14-26 W/lb and an energy storage capacity of 30 Whr/lb. The battery weighed 72 lb and was used to replace 260 lb of lead-acid batteries as the power source in a 1-hp two seater Cushman electric cart. 690205. Fast Transient Response Fuel Cell - Battery Hybrid Power Source. Galen R. Frysinger, U.S. Army Electronics Command. The integration of a molten carbonate fuel cell with a molten electrolyte battery both electrically and thermally produces a highly efficient power source with a fast transient response. Since most practical high pulse applications utilize electronic chopping circuits, micro- second and millisecond response characteristics of a power source are of importance. Ceramic monoblock construction of a hybrid package can be designed with optimum response characteristics as well as the ability to accept high reverse power flow. 690206. A Sealed Lithium-Chloride, Fused Salt Second- ary Battery. R. A. Rightmire, Res. and Dev. Dept., Standarrd Oil Co. (Ohio).; and J. W. Sprague, W. N. Sorensen, T. H. Hacha and J. E. Metcalfe, Res. and Dev. Dept., Standard Oil Co. (Ohio). A sealed, secondary fused salt battery has been developed which has promise as a battery for electric automobiles. The battery uses active carbon plate cathodes, solid aluminum-lithium alloy anodes, and a fused lithium chloride-potassium chloride electrolyte. Cathode capacity is enhanced by the chemisorption of electrochemically active additives onto the carbon surface. The battery operates between 662 aand 932 F. The best energy density achieved to date on a cell is 37.6 w-hr/lb. An improved carbon cathode being develop- ed should enable an energy density of 70 w-hr/lb to be achieved. Insulation bus bars and internal heating coils are expected to add 15 percent to the weight of the battery. A five-cell battery of sub-optimum design has oper- ated satisfactorily for short cycles. Parasitic leakage currents of less than 0.3 percent energy loss per hour have been demonstrated. Cycle life of over 1000 has been attained on electrodes. 690207.

Bomkamp, The American University.; and Robert A. Rightmire and James W. Sprague, Standard Oil Co. (Ohio). High energy density secondary battery systems are being considered for application in military electrical vehicular propulsion. Battery evaluation is carried out with a facility which controls tests by automatically maintaining elec- trical levels and changing modes of operation at present limits. Lithium-chlorine cells tested and reported on demonstrate development improvement in energy output and efficiencies. Cell cycle life and rates are approaching goals for system applications. Responses of the system to milk truck and random military programs are analyzed. 690208. Computer Study of Gasoline Volatility and Vehicle Performance. G. D. Ebersole, Res. and Dev. Dept., Phillips Petroleum Co. A plausible mechanism of vapor lock during full throttle acceleration has been simulated on a digital computer. The computer program, which is based on empirical data from the fuels and vehicle, has been used to study the relationships among fuel composition, ambient tempera- ture and elevation, changes in fuel system design, and vehicle performance.

Hugh R. Jackson, Fuels and Lubricants Div., Atlantic Richfield Co.; and O. W. Wallin, Jr., Arco Chemical Co. Div., Atlantic Richfield Co. Ice formation in the carburetor during periods of adverse winter weather has been the subject of much study in the past. Engine changes and modifications, necessitated by the introduction of automotive emission standards, may have influenced the performance of late model cars under icing conditions. The effect of these emission control systems on carburetor icing was investigated using high volume recent model cars in an all-weather chassis dynamometer. The performance of certain types of anti-icing additives was also evaluated. 690210. Fuel Requirements of Passenger Cars Through- out the World. F. B. Fitch, Research Dept., Mobil Res. and Dev. Corp.; and R. H. Thena, International Div., Mobil Oil Corp. The changes in the fuel quality requirements of passenger cars that have taken place during the past 10 years in the United States, United Kingdom, France, Italy, Germany, Australia, and Japan are reviewed. Included is an analysis of the major differences in the vehicle design and fuel quality trends. During the study period, total car registrations have increased by 45% in the United States, two to six-fold in Europe, and 1968 registrations in Japan are estimated at 30 times those in 1958. The average of the vehicle octane number requirements of the new cars registered each year in each country has increased six to ten numbers during the study period with the exception of the United States, where the 50% satisfied level of new cars increased only 97</page><page sequence="33">690211-690217 98 one octane number. The substantial increases in anti- knock requirements since 1958 can be attributed to changes in engine design to improve efficiency and power, and a customer acceptance and demand for the higher performance cars. Premium grade gasoline quality has been increased to meet the higher antiknock requirement needs of the vehicle populations and is now at fairly uniform 98 to 100 research octane numbers in all the major markets of the world. Significant portions of the higher performance cars and some of the newer large volume production models require fuel quality levels significantly above those which will be available at reasonable costs from existing refining facilities. Also, this study points out that some car models show significant increases in under-hood temperatures which may cause operating limitations due to vapor lock during summer periods. Discussion: D. W.

Kohl, Research Center, Texaco Inc. A review of passenger car performance trends over the past 18 years as observed from new car performance testing of a test car fleet (totaling 200 cars) is presented. The relation of the make-up of the test car fleet to the national average is shown. Trends in operating variables such as horsepower, thermal and volumetric efficiencies, fuel and air consumption, crankcase ventilation and blowby, octane requirement, vapor locking tendencies, and various temperatures are presented. Possible changes in these trends due to the incorporation of exhaust emission control devices on the vehicles of the 1966 through 1968 model years are considered. 690212. A Statistical Approach to Describing Vehicular Driving Cycles. F. Beckley Smith, Jr. and W. A. P. Meyer, Gulf Research and Development Co.; and R. U. Ayres, International Research and Technology Corp. Characterization of a vehicular driving cycle in terms of a joint density function for three variables - vehicle accel- eration, vehicle speed, and road gradient - is presented. Application of this density function to determine the energy requirements associated with propelling a vehicle around a 47-mile city-suburban driving cycle is demon- strated. 690213. Evolution of Sure-Track Brake System. R. H. Madison, Ford Motor Company.; and Hugh E. Riordan, Kelsey-Hayes Co. The history, system philosophy, design evolution and performance of the sure-track anti-lock automotive braking system are presented and discussed. Considera- tions of performance, driver skill, reliability and com- mercial acceptance resulted in the choice of a vacuum- electronic rear wheel antilock system that incorporates individual wheel speed sensing and control of braking as a pair. The system provides superior directional stability under "panic" braking conditions while maintaining stopping distance equal to or shorter than those for locked wheels under most road conditions. 1969 SA E Transactions 690214. Measurement of Tire Brake Force Characteristics as Related to Wheel Slip (Antilock) Control System Design. J. L. Harned, L. E. Johnston and G. Scharpf, General Motors Engineering Staff. Tire brake force characteristic data are presented that should be helpful in the design of wheel slip control systems. Correlation of these data has been established with antilock system performance. Experimentally meas- ured mu-slip curves are given for a large number of tire/road pairings. These measurements cover a wide range of commercial tire types on dry and wet road surfaces and glare ice. It is shown how wet road characteristics are affected by road construction, water cover depth, and tread wear. The measuring system used to obtain these data is described and variability of the experimental measurements is discussed. 1969 SA E Transactions 690215. Road Testing of Wheel Slip Control Systems in the Laboratory. Edwin E. Stewart and Lauren L. Bowler, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. The use of a laboratory simulator to evaluate the performance of wheel slip control systems under con- trolled operating conditions is reported. It is shown how an analog computer can be interconnected with a hydraulic brake system and wheel slip control hardware to form a hybrid simulation of a vehicle installation. An analog computer can also be used to simulate vehicle dynamics and tire-to-road friction characteristics. Simu- lator accuracy is established by correlating laboratory results with road data. Advantages and disadvantages of using the simulator in lieu of experimental road testing are pointed out. 1969 SA E Transactions 690217. Maraging Steels for Die Casting Dies. Alexander Nagy, Specialty Steel Div., Universal-Cyclops. A new family of steels, called maraging steels, is being used quite successfully as die casting dies for casting aluminum. The maraging steels were developed for high strength pressure vessel applications such as solid fuel rocket motor cases. These steels have high strength with excellent toughness. In addition, they are relatively easy to heat treat and have good dimensional stability. Repairs by welding are accomplished with relative ease.</page><page sequence="34">690218-690225 690218.

Cummins V903 Engine. J. L. Butler, Cummins Engine Co., Inc. The Cummins V903 engines were developed for auto- motive and construction market requirements of light- weight, compact diesel engines in the 280-320 hp range. The engine design and development objectives were to obtain relatively high reliability and durability combined with good thermal efficiency in a compact package size. These objectives were achieved by careful attention to design details, combustion system development and extensive laboratory and field evaluations. 690220. Caterpillar's 5.4 Bore, V12 Engine. R. A. Kern and A. E. Liffengren, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Described and illustrated is the D348, a diesel engine in the 1000 horsepower class, which features turbocharging, aftercooling, overhead camshafts, and four valves per cylinder. Easy valve adjustment, unit removal and installation, and simple timing procedures exemplify design emphasis on serviceability. All components are either permanently lubricated or are lubricated by the engine lubricating oil system to minimize maintenance requirements. The basic vehicular engine with a weight- to-power ratio of 6.6 lb/hp and a specific output of 0.55 hp/cu. in. displacement is readily adaptable into indus- trial, marine, and electric set configuration. 690221. Damping Capacity of Pearlitic Gray Iron and Its Influence on Disc Brake Squeal Suppression. Edwin J. Miller, Metallurgical Engineering Dept., Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. A major increase in damping capacity of pearlitic gray iron for brake discs has been obtained by modification of chemical composition. Car tests indicate that sufficient disc damping can be obtained to substantially reduce squeal tendency in disc brakes. The investigation showed that the frequency dependent damping is due to magneto- elastic and elastoplastic mechanisms at low frequencies. Apparently, the contributions from both mechanisms are enhanced by an abundance of large graphite flakes and a coarse pearlitic matrix microstructure. High carbon and silicon concentrations with minimal pearlite stabilizers are required. High damping capacity brake discs exhibited good braking characteristics and appeared significantly more wear resistant than conventional brake iron discs. 1969 SAE Transactions 690222. What the Brake Engineer Wants from Brake Fluid. R. H. Hellmann, Buick Motor Div., General Motors Corp. Do the brake fluid suppliers really know what the brake engineer wants from brake fluid? Of course they realize that the safety conscious brake engineer wants improve- ments in boiling point. But do they realize that he is interested in other characteristics which in the long run will help improve the end product - the automobile? One brake engineer speaks out about the characteristics he would like in brake fluids. 690223. Boiling Point Precision Data for SAE Brake Fluids. Ramsey B. Broadwater, Union Carbide Corp.; and Michael Neale, Dow Chemical Co. The precision of measuring the boiling point of high boiling brake fluids was determined by 18 laboratories on three brake fluid samples (374, 450, and 550 F). Tests were made using both a heating mantle and an electric heater. Reproducibility on the 374 and 450 F fluids. Two results (each the average of duplicates), obtained by analysts in different laboratories, should be considered suspect (95 percent confidence level) if they differ by more than 9 F.

Two results (each the average of duplicates), obtained by analysts in different laboratories, should be considered suspect (95 percent confidence level) if they differ by more than 19 F. 690224. Fluid Level Indicators in Master Cylinders of Automotive Vehicles. S. E. Stone, Hydraulics Div., Bendix Corp. A number of fluid level warning indicators are currently available for adaptation to master cylinder reservoirs of the brake system. Their purpose is to provide warning of possibility of failure of the system in the immediate future. The types of indicators, degree of sophistication, ad- vantages and disadvantages are discussed. 690225. Techniques for Automated Data Transmission. Donald G. Koepsell, Design and Installation Center, Systems Dev. Div., IBM Corp. Advances in computer design and applications have brought about an increased use of electronic transmission systems for conveying information. Discussed in this paper are the components of the system (terminals, channels, multiplexor, computers). Data communications applications are of two major types - intraplant and interplant. Examples of the former are data collection, quality control, assembly line broadcase, process control, and conversation programming. Examples of interplant 99</page><page sequence="35">690226-690232 100 communications are order entry, scheduling, and remote job processing. Each of these applications is discussed in detail. 690226. Computer Control of Motor Gasoline Blending. R. W. Weiland, Humble Oil and Refining Co. The Baton Rouge Refinery of Humble Oil and Refining Co. is implementing an advanced computer control system on its new in-line motor gasoline blending facilities. This paper first deals with the complexities of gasoline blending which dictate the use of both off-line and on-line computers. It then discusses the major functions of the computer system, which include: the planning, scheduling, optimization, and control of all motor gasoline blending operations within the refinery. The system involves three digital computers, an extensive communications network, and some advanced on-line analyzers. This project is illustrative of a multilevel, multicomputer control system which has been designed to solve a number of complex problems for a number of different users within the refinery. 690227. Applications of Automatic Process Control to Engine Development Testing. Roger Wellington, Detroit Diesel Engine Div., General Motors Corp. Engine development entails about equal measures of performance testing and durability, or life testing. The differing requirements of these two types of testing have resulted in separate data acquisition systems. For perfor- mance work the system design reflects the needs for flexibility, accuracy, considerable calculation of data, and for the printing and plotting of results. For a durability facility, where the output is test hours instead of data, the data system design stresses test monitoring and control. This system has not yet gone on line, although a hand wired system has been in service for ten years. 690228. Computerized Control of the Foundry Process. J. G. Schofer, Indianapolis Foundry, Chrysler Corp. Computers for data processing and process control are being used for foundry management. Data processing applications are listed with brief explanations. The process control application is melting control of a 108 in. water wall cupola being continuously tapped into a 100 ton electric induction holding furnace. The process control computer project objectives, computer system, and instru- mentation are described. 690230. Free Piston Stirling Engines - Some Model Tests and Simulations. William T. Beale, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, Ohio University. Model tests of several 0.1 -hp free-piston stirling-cycle engines were made. They showed good piston displacer phasing and thermal efficiency in the 10 percent range. An instructive isothermal computer simulation was developed which compared reasonably well with model data and allowed investigation of parameter changes. Some pos- sible configurations, power transfer, and control methods were considered. 690231. Unconventional Thermal, Mechanical, and Nu- clear Low-Pollution-Potential Power Sources for Urban Vehicles. Joseph A. Hoess, Columbus Labs., Technical Planning Div., Battelle Mem- orial Institute.; and Ralph C. Stahman, National Air Pollution Control Administration, Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare. A wide variety of unconventional thermal, mechanical, and nuclear systems and devices are reviewed to deter- mine which, if any, might be suitable within the next ten years for application as low-pollution-potential power sources for urban vehicles. This paper also points out which of those found suitable are most promising for such application. It is concluded that, of the many types of unconventional nonelectrochemical power sources that are even conceptually possible as vehicle drives, only three appear to offer the near-future possibility of supplanting the internal-combustion engine in many urban automotive applications: rankine-cycle engines (which includes steam), gas turbines, and stirling-cycle engines. For general urban automotive application, the rankine-cycle class, followed closely by the gas turbine, appears to be the most competitive. All of the more exotic types of systems (direct thermal-electric converters, pure mechan- ical and thermal energy storage, and nuclear systems) will continue to be too big, too heavy, and too expensive to be competitive. 1969 SA E Transactions 690232. Metal Hydrides as a Source of Fuel for Vehicular Propulsion. K. C. Hoffmann, W. E. Winsche, R. H. Wiswall, J. J. Reilly and T. V. Sheehan, Brookhaven National Lab., Associated Univer- sities, Inc. Studies of the equilibrium relationships and kinetics of the reversible reaction of hydrogen with magnesium-nickel and magnesium-copper alloys indicate that such systems have properties that may form the basis of a convenient and inexpensive method of storing hydrogen. This unique hydrogen storage technique offers the possibility of utilizing this clean and potentially economical fuel for motor vehicle propulsion. A vehicle propelled by a hydrogen-fueled internal-combustion engine would pro- duce an exhaust that is inherently free of the hydrocarbon, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide pollutants that are major contributors to the atmospheric pollution problem in urban areas. The characteristics of this vehicular propulsion concept have been estimated and indicate that the hydrogen engine is potentially superior in performance to other inherently hydrocarbon-free propulsion concepts such as battery and fuel cell powered electric drives. 1969 SA E Transactions</page><page sequence="36">690233-690241 690233. On Development of Vehicle Dynamics by Means of a Digital Computer. Teruo Maeda and Hitoshi Uemura, Vehicle Design Dept., Nissan Motor Co., Ltd. Throughout the development of a small sized passenger car, a simulation method using digital computers has been proved to be useful in achieving the desired dynamics. Among the types of independent rear suspension systems available, the semitrailing type has been shown preferable because of its negligible effect on jackup. Ride motion is discussed within the concept of "dynamical pitching centers." In some cases, shock absorbers proved very effective in controlling the pitching mode. A system having four degrees of freedom was used for the analysis of steering response. A practical method for evaluating driver reaction is proposed. 1969 SA E Transactions 690234. Considerations in Determining Vehicle Handling Requirements. Walter Bergman, Ford Motor Co. The many facets of vehicle handling are examined and handling as related to real life conditions. Included is a description of driver-vehicle handling qualities in terms of safety and performance. The mechanics of accidents as well as the primary and secondary driving events influ- encing the accident situation are analyzed. The impor- tance of the unexpected event is brought into focus and discussed. Subjective evaluation, performance task testing and response measurement methods are reviewed and compared in terms of merit in developing desirable vehicle handling characteristics. New test methods for measuring effects of braking and acceleration in cornering are described and illustrated with experimental results. The results of preliminary studies attempting to find correla- tion between objective measurements and subjective evaluation are shown. 690235. Programming Time-Sharing Digital Computers for Linear Dynamic Simulation. Ronald L. Leffert, Vehicle Dynamics Lab., General Motors Proving Ground. The use of a time-sharing digital computer for computa- tion of dynamic system responses is discussed. The program illustrated is a dynamic simulation of the linear vehicle directional control problem. State variable and matrix algebra techniques are used to calculate steady- state and transient responses of the linear directional control model for use in suspension analysis. 690236. Effect of Porosity on the Mechanical Properties of Sintered Nickel Steels. Andrew F. Kravic, Development and Research Dept., International Nickel Co., Inc. All mechanical properties of powder metallurgy materials, including sintered nickel steels, are direct functions of sintered density or its inverse, porosity. Mechanical properties, such as tensile strength, ductility, impact strength, and fatigue limit, are dependent on sintered density, alloy content, and heat-treatment. Other proper- ties, such as the modulus of elasticity and Poisson's ratio, are solely functions of sintered density. Sintered nickel steel with less than 8% porosity can be case carburized. Case hardening improves the smooth and notched fatigue limit of high density sintered nickel steels. 690237. Control for Durability in Sintered Steel Parts. S. W. McGee, Burgess-Norton Mfg. Co. Much has been published concerning theory and practice in the compaction and sintering of powder metallurgy articles. Nevertheless a gap exists between knowledge of the controls necessary in manufacturing practice and the resulting properties of fabricated powder-metallurgy articles. This paper is offered as an attempt to narrow this gap. 690238. Fabrication and Testing of 105-mm Sintered Iron Rotating Bands. F. I. Zaleski, Frankford Ar- senal, U. S. Army. The fabrication process and mechanical testing proce- dures used by the Frankford Arsenal in the production of 105-mm sintered iron rotating bands (for spin-stabilized ammunition) are discussed. It was demonstrated that 105-mm bands can be fabricated to meet the class 3 density range of the current military specification (MIL- R-11073) using conventional sintering temperatures (2050 -2100 F) and sintering atmospheres (dissociated am- monia). The major processing requirement was that density must be closely controlled and kept in the upper portion of the density range, approximately between 6.00 and 6.19 g/cc. Two commercial reduced-type iron pow- ders were found to be suitable for the production of these bands. The existing methods of test for tensile strength and ductility of bands in the specification appear adequate. A more sophisticated hydrostatic type testing device did not yield more consistent or uniform test data. 690239. Knitted Vinyl. P. Dan O'Kray, Vinyl Operations, Industrial Chemical Products Div., Ford Motor Co. Knitted vinyl is produced by slitting calendered polyvinyl chloride film and knitting the resulting "threads" into a material having physical properties characteristic of vinyl upholstery combined with the styling flexibility of textiles. The porosity of the product makes it the most breathable type of supported polyvinyl chloride yet introduced. 690241. Angular Color Measurement on Automotive Materials. Ruth M. Johnston and Ralph Stan- ziola, Kollmorgen Corp. The new Trilac goniospectrophotometer, discussed in detail here, offers a valuable measurement dimension for characterizing the optical nature and appearance of materials which reflect light differently when the angles of illumination and viewing are changed. Use of this device is particularly helpful to the stylist who wants to be sure that various automotive trim materials will retain a 101</page><page sequence="37">690242-690247 102 coordinated appearance when viewed under varying lighting conditions. 1969 SAE Transactions 690242. The Role of Foams and Fiber Paddings for Greater Luxury in Automobile Interiors. Richard A. Singer, Allen Industries, Inc. A review of the current applications of foams and fibers in automotive interiors, and a preview of future develop- ments and processes, such as mechanical bonding of foam and cover material, an improved method of tooling for plastics, self-skinning foams, molded fibers; and as yet, unexplored uses for new decorative products. 690243. A Survey of Automotive Occupant Restraint Systems: Where We've Been, Where We Are and Our Current Problems. R. G. Snyder, University of Michigan. In recent years, automotive occupant restraint system development has gained impetus, stimulated, in part, by new federal standards. But in the resolution of the basic question of whether automobiles should be equipped with restraints, many new problems have arisen, including, ironically, some brought on by regulation. While there is little doubt that restraint systems can provide the single most important contribution to occupant protection, such restraint systems remain useless unless adequately in- stalled and properly worn. Current problems involve not only what concepts provide most promise for future restraint systems, but diverse and often conflicting industry and governmental opinion about what are the best interests of the motoring public. Restraints are still not provided in buses, trucks, and utility vehicles. In addition, the problems of child and infant restraints and restraints for retrofit in older vehicles remain unresolved. The systems approach, while often alleged, is seldom effectively utilized. This paper surveys the present status of automotive occupant restraint systems and suggests how current problems may influence future design. 1969 SAE Transactions 690244. Comparison of Occupant Injuries With and Without Seat Belts. Donald F. Huelke, Dept. of Anatomy, Medical School, University of Michi- gan.; and William A. Chewning, Highway Safety Research Institute, University of Michigan. Modulation of the occupant's movement within the vehicle by the seat belt reduces the potential for striking certain structures and decreases severity of the injuries. The seat belt also functions to direct the upper torso, especially the head, to specific interior surfaces. Design modifications of these areas are needed to prevent serious facial fractures that have been seen. Lap belted drivers contact the steering wheel rim or instrument panel in front of the wheel in head-on crashes; the front passenger strikes the upper instrument panel. Improper positioning of the lap seat belts produces serious intraabdominal injury, especially in the case of the rear passengers. Seat belt fatality cases were, in general, due to collapse and compromise of the occupant space as typified by the broadside intersection collision. 690245. Case Comparisons of Restrained and Nonre- strained Occupants and Related Injury Patterns. Arnold W. Siegel, Wayne T. Van Wagoner and Alan M. Nahum, School of Medicine, Univ. of California, Los Angeles. Restraining devices continue to be the most effective means of lessening injuries in automobile collisions. Evidence from the Trauma Research Group's case files illustrates how injury is avoided or minimized by use of lap, shoulder, and diagonal seat belts in several types of crashes, under various angles of impact. Prevention of fatal ejection, the improved chances a restrained driver has of retaining control of his car, and the attenuation of interior collision forces, such as result in jackknifing, are topics discussed, as well as the contribution of major automobile design improvements. 690246. Restraint Systems in Racing Accidents. John D. States, Orthopaedic Surgery Div., Univ. of Rochester.; and David Ryon, Rochester Applied Science Associates, Inc. Some 634 accidents occurring in races sanctioned by the Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) are reviewed. Shoulder harnesses were used in 275 of the accidents. Inverted Y or double, separately anchored, shoulder harnesses were used almost exclusively. A significant decrease in the frequency and severity of injuries occurred after harnesses were introduced. Injury from the restraint system was very infrequent; submarining occurred only once. Deep bucket seats, providing lateral support for the chest and forward support for the buttocks, appear to improve the effectiveness of restraint systems. The Y harness functions well in production seats without lateral support because lateral displacement of the shoulders and upper torso can occur without risk of neck injury. 690247. Testing Programs and Research on Restraint Systems. R. W. Armstrong and H. P. Waters, Occupant Restraint Systems Section, Office of Vehicle Systems Research, National Bureau of Standards. Extensive research in the field of occupant restraints has been made by the Office of Vehicle Systems Research at the National Bureau of Standards. Portions of that research, consisting of human dynamic sled tests at Holloman Air Force Base, tests of restraint systems on the NBS sled, and a variety of strength and degradation tests of seat belts are reported. The geometry of restraint systems in 1968 model production automobiles is docu- mented. Results of 75 human tests reported indicate the nature of human kinematic response to deceleration in seat belts and the forces the seat belt might be expected to</page><page sequence="38">690248-690255 withstand. Requirements for dynamic tests of seat belts have been investigated as well as degradation tests for improvement of the federal standards for seat belts for use in motor vehicles. 1969 SA E Transactions 690248. Multidimensional Mathematical Modeling of Occupant Dynamics Under Crash Conditions. V. L. Roberts and D. H. Robbins, Highway Safety Research Institute, University of Michigan. A series of mathematical models of the interaction between an occupant and the interior of a vehicle is presented. The following parameter studies using an 8-mass, 2-dimensional model are discussed: belt material properties, belt slack, belt geometric configuration, and comparison of seats with and without headrests in rear impact. Imaddition, it is demonstrated by example that simple mathematical models can perform a valuable service in laying the groundwork for more sophisticated analytical and experimental work as well as yielding short term results. Finally, 3-dimensional models are discussed. It is shown that a 3-mass, 3-dimensional model is a logical extension of current simulation efforts in order to provide insight into occupant response in oblique and lateral impact as well as nonsymmetric restraint systems. 1969 SA E Transactions 690250. Projected Evolution of Restraint Systems. L. M. Patrick, Department of Engrg. Mechanics, Wayne State Univ. A voluntary increase in usage of restraint systems can be achieved by educating the driving public to their advan- tages and by improving them by the addition of self- storing inertia reels, easier identification of mating parts, automatic adjustment, improved anchor location, and more convenient methods of buckling. Finally, mandatory use of present upper torso and lap belt restraint systems through legislation would show a step decrease in injuries and fatalities. A foolproof interlock between the restraint system and the ignition system is an alternative to legislation. 690251. Tomorrow - the Federal Government and Re- straint Systems. Dean F. Niedernhof er, Motor Vehicle Safety Performance Service, Federal Highway Administration.; and Robert L. Carter, National Highway Safety Institute, Federal Highway Administration. Basic packaging concepts are applied as a means to solve the principal demand of safety for automobile occupants. Various types of crashes are studied for the purpose of demonstrating that injuries and fatalities can be reduced by adapting packaging techniques to the vehicle. 690252. Correlation of Air Charge Temperature and Ignition Delay for Several Fuels in a Diesel Engine. N. A. Henein and Jay A. Bolt, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, University of Michi- gan. A correlation between the ignition delay, based on the start of pressure rise due to combustion, and the mean air charge temperature has been obtained for diesel, com- pression-ignition-turbine-engine, and gasoline fuels. The experimental work was done on a single-cylinder open-combustion-chamber research engine. The intake air temperature was varied over a wide range from atmos- pheric to about 750 F. The experimental data indicated that the best correla- tion of the ignition delay and the reciprocal of the absolute temperature is of an exponential form. The apparent activation energy for the three fuels was found to have a straight line relationship with the cetane number of the fuel. 690253. Ignition Conditions in Diesel Engines. A. Andree and S. J. Pachernegg, AVL - Institute Prof. List, Austria. A working theory applicable to a wide range of problems from cold-starting behavior to combustion efficiency of extreme fuel loading in super-charged engines is presen- ted. The theory correlates cetane number with the time/ temperature integral of the compression cycle and empha- sizes the need for quick and complete combustion of a large amount of fuel in a geometrically limited space.

Calculation of Spray Penetration in Diesel En- gines. I. Hakki OZ, I.T.U. - Istanbul, Turkey. The mechanism of spray formation at high velocities is so complicated that it cannot be subjected to a complete mathematical treatment. Despite numerous studies made since Plateau, no reliable formula is known that can be used to calculate directly and accurately the spray characteristics such as cone angle, spray velocity, droplet size, and droplet distribution in diesel engines. Here, an attempt is made to eliminate the complex, laborious, high-pressure part of spray measurement and to calculate spray penetration by carrying out spray measurements in the atmospheric air alone. 1969 SA E Transactions 690255. Development and Operational Results of the Man FM Combustion System. J. S. Meurer and A. C. Urlaub, Maschinenfabrik Augsburg-Nurnberg AG. The development and testing of the FM combustion principle, which combines the mixture formation process of the M system with electric spark ignition and thus brings together the advantages of the traditional diesel and gasoline engines, are described. The FM process is particularly suitable for burning gasolines. What is more, practically all liquid fuel cells can be used without any restrictions as regards the octane and cetane numbers. This is possible at the same compression ratios as normal diesel engines. 103</page><page sequence="39">690256-690263 104 FM engines operated on gasoline attain the same economical, low specific fuel consumption as diesel engines at all load and speed ranges. The peak pressures are lower, and the CO and unburned hydrocarbon contents of the exhaust are greatly reduced. Discussion: P. H. Schweitzer; Optimizer Control Corp.; D. Broome; Ricardo &amp; Co.

Six problems encountered in the design of universal joints for automotive drive lines and their solutions are outlined. Solutions ncluded: elimination of undercuts from opera- ting area of journal surface, control of uniformity of loading on ground and thrust surfaces touched by the needles, use of dual-system precision seals, use of plastic retaining rings to freeze the joint on center, and removal of impediments to the process of precession. 690257. The Tri-Pot Universal Joint. J. M. Roethlis- berger, Saginaw Steering Gear Div., GMC.; and F. C. Aldrich, Oldsmobile Div., GMC. The Tri-Pot universal joint, a tri-axial variant of the conventional ball and trunnion joint, satisfies design requirements of the Toronado inboard drive axle. While the conventional pot joint may meet basic requirements, its nonconstant velocity produces vibrations under heavy torque. By evaluating the Tri-Pot joint statistics and kinematics, its constant velocity can be justified. Having three equally spaced drive elements, the Tri-Pot joint offers rotational motion at constant angular velocity. Friction is translated into a cyclic axial force along the spider and axle shaft axis. Thus, the Tri-Pot joint satisfies both the angular and axial travel requirements for the inboard drive axle joint. 690258. Driveline Tuning for Quieter Vehicles. A. H. Berker and B. J. Hoover, Ford Motor Co. A systematic vehicle design and development procedure to minimize axle noise through driveline tuning has been developed. This method reduces engineering lead time and optimizes the vehicle design through the utilization of computer analysis, laboratory testing, and road testing. 1969 SA E Transactions 690259. Axle Noise Control - The IVA Propeller Shaft. Walter M. Esser, Chrysler Corp. A dynamic absorber is now in production which will effectively reduce rear-axle whine in automobiles. Simple construction and ease of assembly, combined with adaptability to existing drivelines, produce a low cost replacement for present axle noise control devices. This paper deals with the causes of axle noise, how to deal with offensive resonances, and the new internal vibration absorber (IVA) designed to overcome these problems. In the 1968 model year, 500,000 IVA equipped automobiles were released and this number was increased to two million for 1969. 690260. Technological Development Directing the Path to Fully Automatic Vehicle Control Systems. S. I. MacDuff, J. G. Rivard and E. J. McGlinn, Bendix Corp. Future automotive control systems are being strongly influenced by a changing environment. New technology advances are providing vehicle control system design concepts which are more ideally suited to the man- vehicle-environment system which must be considered. The emphasis in this paper is on the evolutionary nature of the changes possible with application of the new technologies. The ultimate realization of semiautomatic control systems and eventually the fully automatic control system will be preceded by improvements in the three basic vehicle controls. Advanced control concepts are being developed for adaptive braking, adaptive steering, and anti-slip traction power application. 690261. Heat Treatment of Automotive Crankshafts. J. A. Halgren and P. E. Cary, Manufacturing Res., International Harvester Co. The need for adequate strength in crankshafts is dis- cussed. Heat-treat methods that will provide adequate wear resistance or adequate strength, or a combination of both, are described. Details of the heat-treat process are presented and the results obtained on several steels are shown. The combinations of heat-treatments and mate- rials presented here provide the engineer with several alternatives for ensuring adequate crankshaft design. 690262. Metastable Austenitic Steels with Ultra-High Strength and Toughness. W. W. Gerberich, Lawrence Radiation Lab., Univ. of California, Berkeley. A combination of chemical balancing and thermal- mechanical processing has led to a new class of high strength steels. These steels utilize the strain-induced austenite to martensite transformation to produce unusua- lly good combinations of strength, elongation, toughness, and corrosion resistance. The principle behind enhanced elongation is discussed in terms of the increased work- hardening rate provided by the hard martensitic phase. The mechanism responsible for enhanced toughness is described in terms of the plastic energy absorption occurring during the transformation. It is further shown that elongation is three times greater, toughness may be two times greater in thin or thick sections, and corrosion resistance is an order of magnitude greater than the comparable properties of conventional, high-strength martensitic steels. 1969 SA E Transactions 690263. Properties and Applications of Low Carbon Martensitic Steel Sheets. W. H. McFarland and H. L. Taylor, Inland Steel Co.</page><page sequence="40">690264-690270 The mechanical properties and microstructures of low carbon alloy-free martensite steels are discussed as well as engineering aspects such as joining techniques, fatigue, protection from corrosion, and forming practice. With the properties that have been developed, it is shown that the low carbon martensitic steels can compete with high carbon quenched and tempered or austempered steels as well as such high priced materials as aluminum, titanium, and stainless steel. Similarly, the relatively low cost of low carbon martensitic steels, plus their high strength to weight ratio, makes these steels potential substitutes for plastics and fiber glass. Crash bars, welded tubing, fasteners, small spring-type parts, and corrugated panels are discussed as applications and supporting data are presented. 690264. Measuring Tensile Strength with X-Rays. John A. Larson, Research Office, Chrysler Corp. An X-ray diffraction analysis involving integrated inten- sities was applied to a series of 99.85 percent Cu, 0.15 percent Cd alloys which had been cold-rolled and annealed. It is shown that the reduction in integrated intensity, due to exttinction, can be correlated with tensile strength. In addition, it is shown that the annealing behavior of this alloy can be characterized by a tempering parameter containing both time and temperature. 1969 SA E Transactions 690265. Holographic Measurement of Compressor Blade, Turbine Blade and Airframe Panel Vibration Distribution. W. G. Alwang, R. Burr and L. A. Cavanaugh, Pratt and Whitney Aircraft, Div., United Aircraft Corp. Holographic vibration tests have been conducted to determine the vibration mode shapes of jet engine turbine and compressor blades and airframe panels. Tests were conducted using piezoelectric transducers, electromech- anical and electromagnetic vibrators, and acoustic drivers of excitation. Time average holograms were obtained and the vibration pattern used to locate nodes and antinodes and to measure relative displacements. 1969 SA E Transactions 690266. Application of Laser Doppler Velocity Instru- mentation to the Measurement of Jet Turbulence. Robert M. Huffaker, NASA/George C. Mar- shall Space Flight Center.; Charles E. Fuller, Hayes International Corp.; and T. R. Lawrence, Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. Approximately four years ago, NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center initiated a program to develop a laser Doppler heterodyne technique for the measurement of a local mean and fluctuating gas velocity with high spatial and temporal resolution. This paper contains design considerations and description of a 3-dimensional laser Doppler velocity instrument. This instrument has been applied to the measurement of subsonic jet turbulence. Comparison of these measurements with similar hot wwire anemometer data indicate the laser Doppler velocity instrument is capable of making accurate turbulence measurements. 1969 SA E Transactions 690267. TECHNA - A Concept Car to Challenge Auto- motive Engineers. G. H. Muller, Ford Motor Co. TECHNA was conceived in the second half of 1965 by fifteen engineers of the Ford Car Systems Research Activity, and engineered in detail in 1966 by a team of fifty engineers and designers, and built in the first half of 1967 by the Company Fabrication and Services facility, with the assistance of five manufacturing divisions of Ford Motor Company and fifty-eight suppliers. The basic concept is SPACE4- more space, of course. The objective was to design, build, and demonstrate a novel relationship between occupant accommodations and componentry in response to the want for more space for a 6-passenger vehicle, that is: More space inside the vehicle, and more space at and through the apertures providing access to the vehicle. A further objective was to submit the concept to two constraints, thus making its achievement more difficult. First, obtain a low silhouette and, second, provide safety in comfort. 690268. Torque Capacity of a Multidisc Clutch. R. N. Reddy, D. D. Sen and M. S. Keshav, Central Mechanical Engrg. Res. Inst., India. Multiplate clutches are often designed without consid- ering the effect of spline friction and the friction coefficient velocity characteristic of the friction linings. Such designs give an underrated clutch for a given torque duty. An attempt is made in this paper to clarify the factors that must be considered in the clutch design. 690269. Have We Finally Found the Right Design for Tire Studs? Bertil Riettz, Fagersta Bruks AB, Swe- den. Studs are the best and most used antiskid device for tires today. Cemented carbide has, due to its extreme hardness, contributed highly to this state. The paper reviews the history of antiskid devices, and states the basic principles for the construction and function of studs as well as their fitting into tires. Special problems with regard to heat buildup and wear are treated, and how these matters influence the choice of material and design for the stud jacket. The ability of the stud point to penetrate into ice of various hardness is considered. 690270. Influence of Some Side Mirror Parameters on the Decisions of Drivers. Pieter L. Walraven and John A. Michon, Institute for Perception RVO- TNO, Soesterberg, The Netherlands. General considerations about the use of convex mirrors indicate that they may be very useful to enlarge the field of view. There seems to be no need to use smaller values for the radius of the mirror than 1000 mm. 105</page><page sequence="41">690271-690302 106 A reaction time experiment is described in which plane mirrors of equal size at different positions on the fender are used. There are indications that the position of about 20 degrees out of the line of sight straight ahead might be optimal. Whether this also holds for convex mirrors is not investigated. An experiment is described in which a driver must decide whether he can overtake a car in front of him, while a car behind him is approaching. This is done with several speeds of the car behind and with different curvatures of the side mirrors. Especially if the radius of curvature is not less than 1200 mm, no serious effects on driver behavior is observed. The instrumented car used in the studies is briefly described. 690271. Designing and Evaluating Rear View Mirrors by Computer. Harold W. Krauss, Gene Scofield and Paul Young, Engineering Center, Chevrolet Motor Div., GMC. The engineer, using a digital computer to analytically evaluate a rear view mirror, can now obtain a full scale, body view drawing of the mirror, eyes, and vehicle components. An accurate reduced scale drawing also is produced describing the ambinocular field of view defined by the entire mirror. In addition to the design function, the computer can be used to show compliance to the viewing requirements of the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards. The great number of available design options make this technique a comprehensive, flexible, and economic tool. 690272. Elastic Vibration Analysis of Passenger Car Bodies (Bending and Torsion). Kiyoshi Miki, Mamoru Nagai and Eiji Adachi, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. This paper presents the outline of a theoretical analysis of bending and torsional vibration of passenger-car bodies. Body structure is simulated by a framework with tension rigs and additional panel stiffnesses* The framework is a 3-dimensional model for the bending and torsional vibration, or 2-dimensional for the bending vibration, and is analyzed by the lumped mass system. All input data are calculated from drawings, and therefore characteristics of body structure are forecast and controlled in the design process. The analysis is also applicable to coupled vibration and forced vibration problems. 1969 SA E Transactions 690275. Gall Resistance of Cast Graphitic Aluminum Alloys. F. A. Badia and P. K. Rohatgi, Inter- national Nickel Co., Inc. Gall resistance of cast aluminum alloys containing dispersed graphite particles was investiated. The graphite particles were introduced by injecting nickel-coated graphite powders through an inert gas stream into molten aluminum alloys and then rapidly solidifying the melt in permanent mold castings. Incorporation of graphite particles permits aluminum alloys to withstand poor lubrication conditions (low bearing parameters) success- fully without galling. Gall resistance increases with graphite content over the range studied. Aluminum- silicon-nickel alloys containing more than about 1.8 weight % graphite in one or both mating members are able to run under conditions of boundary lubrication without galling. Dispersed graphite improves the gall resistance of aluminum alloys through a combination of several mechanisms; the principal one being the formation of a graphite-rich layer on the bearing surface of mated members. 1969 SA E Transactions 690276. Engineering Laboratory Testing with Computer Data Acquisition System. Harlan W. Van Ger- pen, Product Engineering Center, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works. Experience with a data acquisition system at the John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works Product Engineering Center is described. This system handles the engineering design calculation load and, on an interrupt basis, logs data from test stands. In addition, several applications are discussed which make use of the high-speed acquisition system for more accurate recording of high speed phenomenon. 690301. A Survey of Total Energy in the United States and Canada. W. G. Bair, Institute of Gas Technology. Total energy systems are being installed increasingly in office and industrial buildings, schools, and shopping centers. This paper surveys existing systems, including operating data, distribution, and types of installations. Several recent equipment developments are mention- ed, including a completely packaged engine-generator set heat recovery modules, sets of two or more turbine alternator modules for continuous-duty precise power requirements (such as computers), complete turn-key plants, and installations combining steam and gas tur- bines. 690302. Designing Cast Components For V-8 Engines. J. L. Flitz, J. A. Williams and W. E. Wistehuff, Central Foundry Div., General Motors Corp. Product development work in the foundry is helping the engine designer to achieve his objectives with respect to reliability, performance and cost. For example: 1. Production experience with a simplified coring system for V-8 cylinder blocks shows it to provide cleaner, more accurate castings while simplifying core making and core handling operations in the foundry. The key to the success of this program was to design specifically for the foundry process. 2. Nodular iron crankshafts, ArmaSteel connecting rods and aluminum pistons can be developed in less time as a result of design parameters and pre-engine testing techniques developed specifically for each of these parts.</page><page sequence="42">690305-690312 Time is saved by detecting and correcting design deficien- cies before engine testing begins. 3. New ways are being found to improve the perfor- mance and utilization of engine castings and to reduce manufacturing costs. This is done by marrying the technologies of metal casting and engine component development. 1 969 SA E Transactions 690305. Aerodynamic Improvements for Agricultural Air- craft. Michael R. Smith, Dept. of Aerophysics and Aerospace Engineering, Mississippi State University. During the past four years, the Dept. of Aerophysics and Aerospace Engineering conducted evaluations of five agricultural aircraft to determine their performance, handling characteristics, and modifications to improve their safety and economy. As a result, several modifica- tions were made to the basic aircraft to improve its performance. Réévaluation of the modified aircraft's performance showed that these modifications were benefi- cial. The evaluations showed that the greatest impediment in obtaining increased safety and performance is usually the dispersal systems used to distribute seed, fertilizer, and chemicals. Some effort was devoted to designing improved dispersal systems with lower power requirements. Results of the evaluation tests are represented. 690308. Functional Compatibility Analysis of Aircraft - Engine Fuel Systems. Cesar Gonzalez, Cessna Aircraft Co. The range of performance demands placed on fuel systems incorporated on piston business aircraft is rapidly expanding with the continued rise in operating altitudes, rates of climb, cabin pressurization levels, and turbo- charging capabilities. Fuel systems cannot be considered any longer as separate links of a chain leading the fuel from the tanks to the fuel injector or carburetor, since incompatible component characteristics at any point can defeat an otherwise ideal system. Compatibility requirements between engine and air- frame supply systems are discussed in this paper, and several component features are analyzed in an effort to categorize and group these components in integrated systems with degrees of sophistication or simplicity in accord with the particular application. 690309. Correction of Turbocharged Engine Performance to Standard Conditions and Prediction of Non- standard Day Performance. Leon M. Yanda, Aero Commander Bethany Div., North Ameri- can Rockwell Corp. The expanding use of turbocharged reciprocating engines in light aircraft applications has accentuated the need for a performance correction procedure and a method of predicting nonstandard day turbocharged engine perfor- mance. Hie procedure proposed is outlined and equations are derived to account for the effects of exhaust gas temperature, exhaust back pressure, intercooler, compres- sor, turbine, fuel flow rate, altitude, and airspeed. Each effect is examined individually and weighed accordingly in the final relationship for standardized horsepower. A comparison is made between predicted performance and actual test data, to illustrate the accuracy and limitations of the correction procedure. 1969 SA E Transactions 690310. Garrett TSE36-1 Propulsion Engine: Design and Operational Considerations. Jere G. Castor, AiResearch Mfg. Co. of Arizona, Div., Garrett Corp. The aerodynamic and mechanical design philosophy for the AiResearch model TSE36-1 240 shp gas turbine propulsion engine, which is currently being developed for the small 2-3-place single-engine helicopter market, is presented. The program objectives are to provide engines that have a low selling price and a low cost of ownership. The engine design is highly flexible and, thus, will be suitable for turboshaft and auxiliary power unit applications. This creates a large production base which, along with simplicity of design, will result in a low initial cost. Low cost of ownership will be possible, due to a modular maintainability concept, high component reliability, and multifuel and oil operating capabilities. Experimental flight, development, performance, growth, and official FAA engine tests completed to date are also discussed. 690311. Developing, Qualifying and Operating Business Jet Thrust Reversers. J. S. Mount and D. W. R. Lawson, Rohr Corp. The types of thrust reversers currently employed for business jet aircraft are briefly reviewed and their main features noted. The different types of reversers applicable to various powerplants - straight turbojets, low bypass ratio turbofans and high bypass ratio turbofans are pointed out, with comments on weight and cost. The advantages of reversers for business operations are listed and quantified and potential new uses are discussed. Alternate approaches to the thrust reverser control system are presented, with emphasis on the required procedures at the pilot station. Current federal aircraft regulation requirements for ground and in-flight qualification of reversers are discussed and experience gained from development and qualification tests on specific installa- tions are described. 690312. Design Considerations for Decongealing Oil Coolers. Robert W. Cummings, Harrison Radia- tor Div., General Motors Corp. As commercial aircraft become capable of operating at higher altitudes, designers have become concerned with the possibility of oil congealing in the engine oil cooler when cooling air temperatures reach -30 to -40 F. The 107</page><page sequence="43">690313-690321 108 initial reaction has been to install so-called "decon- gealing" type oil coolers. This paper discusses designs now in use and examines the factors which cause congealing problems so that the engine oiling system can be properly designed to avoid oil congealing in the coolers. It points out that, through added bulk, weight and expense of special "decongealing" features. 690313. Conversion of Light-Weight Commercial Aircraft to Fulfill a Specific Military Mission. Jack R. Sattler, Cessna Aircraft Co. The concept of converting in-production lightweight commercial aircraft to fulfill a specific military role presents significant engineering opportunities. The con- version of the Cessna Super Skymaster, featuring a tandem engine installation, to the role of a forward air control aircraft is an example of such a program. The exact nature of the conversion consists of modifying the basic commercial configuration to the mandatory requir- ements of the user. Visibility, electrical and electronic systems, and external stores capability are areas requiring special design attention. 690314. Special Operations Use of General Aviation. John C. Gruver, Chief Command Briefing Team, Special Operations Force, U. S. Air Force. The advantages and disadvantages of adapting civilian "off-the-shelf" aircraft to support and augment military operations are discussed. One advantage is that it provides the U. S. with a standing paramilitary force that can be quickly assembled. Modifications to various models are discussed in some detail, listing both the benefits and shortcomings of each based on USAF Special Operations Force experience in using general aviation aircraft for reconnaissance, liaison, courier, ambulance, infiltration, transport, leaflet dropping, mosquito control, and agricul- tural purposes. 690315. Development of Army Utility Aircraft Model U-21A. J. A. Veerkamp, Beech Aircraft Corp. The Army Utility Aircraft Model U-21A was procured as an off-the-shelf unpressurized version of the Beech King Air. The major changes are outlined and several problem areas discussed, especially electronic testing. A brief description of the configuration control exercised by the procuring agency is included. 690316. Explosive Fabrication of Aircraft Components. G. J. Lemonds, Explosive Fabricators Corp., Div., Tyco. Only recently has explosive fabrication been accepted as a useful manufacturing process in the aircraft industry. At the same time, new techniques are being discovered. This paper covers aircraft components currently in production or development, as well as some future applications of this process. 690318. Electron Beam Welding in Aircraft Components. A. H. Lippitt, Beech Aircraft Corp. Some of the characteristics of electron beam welding that can be exploited by the design engineer, together with precautionary notes on limitations are discussed. Specific examples of electron beam welded aircraft components are cited. 690319. Manufacture of Tubular Products by Hydrostatic Extrusion. A. M. Sabroff, B. D. Richardson and R. J. Fiorentino, Metalworking Div., Columbus Labs., Battelle Memorial Institute. Hydrostatic extrusion has been demonstrated to be a promising method for the manufacture of tubing in a variety of materials. In development studies at Battelle, the process has been used to fabricate tubes from alloy steels, hard aluminum alloys, and titanium alloys. This paper describes the equipment and techniques utilized in hydrostatic tube extrusion, and discusses how the process fits into commercial tube production operations. The potential capabilities for applying the hydrostatic ex- trusion process as a substitute for hot extrusion or as a substitute for conventional drawing or tube reducing of tubes produced by other means are summarized for a variety of materials. 1969 SA E Transactions 690320. Changing Airworthiness Requirements for Air Taxi Operators and Their Effect on Manufac- turers of Small Airplanes. Herbert Slaughter and Nicholas S. Dobi, Dept. of Trans., Federal Aviation Administration. Important provisions are highlighted with respect to the additional airworthiness standards being considered by the Federal Aviation Administration for small airplanes capable of carrying more than ten occupants, which are intended for use in air taxi and commercial operations. Information is presented on the background leading to these provisions and on their impact on manufacturers and operators. These new standards would result in a significant increase in the level of safety which is more commensurate with the class of operation, the increased occupant capacity, and the expanded volume of opera- tions anticipated for these airplanes. 1969 SAE Transactions 690321. FAA Crashworthiness Program for Large and Small Airplanes. J. E. Dougherty, Jr. and N. N. Shapter, Dept. of Trans., Federal Aviation Administration. The nature of the current crashworthiness requirements contained in the United States airworthiness standards are outlined briefly, with primary emphasis on those for fixed-wing airplanes. The authority for and origin of such requirements is traced. Special attention is focused on the recommendations of the Federal Aviation Administra- tion's Task Force for Crashworthiness and Emergency Evacuation. During the past two years this team has</page><page sequence="44">690323-690330 studied the subject intensively. An indication is provided of trends for improved means to cope with occupant protection in a survivable crash environment. This includes protection against serious injury in the event of damaging ground impact as well as the rapid, safe evacuation of the airplane's occupants. An indication is also given of areas wherein further regulatory action is proposed to amend the transport category requirements. Also discussed are actions to improve the level of safety of future air-taxi airplanes. 690323. High Altitude/Cold Weather Operation of Ham- ilton Standard Propellers. William H. Furnivall and Robert L. Mettey, Hamilton Standard Div., United Aircraft Corp. AircrafJ propellers normally operate at extremes of environmental temperature. Specification of lubricants for these highly stressed and precision machined mechanisms has evolved over the past 40 years, with the requirements for each generation of propellers becoming increasingly stringent. Experience with aircraft propellers is applicable to comparable mechanisms exposed to similar envi- ronments. 690325. Surveillance of Small Turboprop Engine Problem Areas by Soap (Spectrometric Oil Analysis Procedure). F. L. Roberts and M. S. Roush, AiResearch Manufacturing Co., Div., Garrett Corp. The lubricating system of a small turboprop engine is described in terms of capacity, temperatures, type of lubrication, material of oil-wetted parts, system routing, and problem areas. The customer's installation and parent lubricating system are described and their importance discussed. A discussion of the Spectrometric Oil Analysis Procedure is presented with reference to the sampling, interpretation of data, and a history of selected impending failures. The use of SOAP analysis to allow replacement of marginal design parts is discussed. The necessity to monitor engine lubricating systems during engine develop- ment is emphasized. 690326. Outside Looking in Attitude Gyros. C. R. Bonn- ell, Humphrey Inc. An electric outside-in attitude gyro display system was prototyped and flown to compare the display with the contemporary inside-out display developed by Elmer Sperry nearly 50 years ago. The outside-in display system was evaluated to be superior in extreme attitudes and the spiral dive problem. The electric prototype was evaluated also to have alternate power sources advantage over air gyros on single engine aircraft. Government regulations relative to attitute gyros and displays are concluded not to conflict with outside-in gyros. A concept of control indicator to performance indicators scan is suggested to be considered in this integration of instruments. 690327. The Future of Cockpit TV-Radar. George M. Kirkpa trick, Syracuse University Research Corp. The effectiveness of TV-radar in providing pilots with navigational, weather, and traffic data is reviewed. The results of a feasibility test conducted by the FAA is analyzed. Safety factors and the need for improving the quality of radar picture transmissions are discussed. The future of televised radar depends in great part on low initial cost of equipment, improved ability to supply traffic information simultaneously to numerous aircraft, and greater emphasis on the potential of this important electronic aid in supplying pilots with valuable informa- tion. 690328. Human Factors Evaluation of Aircraft Engine Instrument Displays. Christopher L. Lair and Kenneth W. Bender, Cessna Aircraft Co. Relative merits of three types of aircraft engine instru- ments were examined in respect to aircraft changing conditions. The experimental design considered inter- ference, workload, age, and experience. Instruments were comparable so far as instrument size and characteristics would allow. Experimental results and comments indi- cated the experimental apparatus and failure parameters were comparable to actual aircraft situations. It was discovered that vertical-scale engine instruments required less recognition and scan time. Age and flight experience were not significant in this experimental design. 690329. Modular Hydraulic Power Systems for General Aviation. Herbert W. Pepper and Charles E. Rees, Jr., ITT Aerospace Controls. Renewed emphasis of hydraulic power for use in general aviation has increased the need for modulized hydraulic pumping systems in order to reduce the complexity levels of "multiple plumbed built to order" hydraulic systems. Through the use of electric motor driven modular hydraulic power systems, flexibility of system location, modular maintenance capabilities, and single point per- formance responsibilities can be coupled into one package to provide general aviation with a low cost, compact hydraulic power source. 690330. Pressurized Navajo Environmental System. Lewis E. Herr, Piper Aircraft Corp. When the performance envelope for the pressurized Navajo was finalized, it was apparent that a sophisticated environmental system was needed to guarantee passenger comfort. The environmental studies centered around the ventilation, pressurization, heating, and aircooling sys- tems. This paper discusses parameters that governed the selection of each system design, and how they were integrated into a proper functioning overall system. The hardware that was needed together with those factors that govern their selection are also discussed. Development of the various systems imposed many problems and the solution to these problems required 109</page><page sequence="45">690331-690336 110 many changes. Some of the more important of these are described in detail. 1969 SA E Transactions 690331. Turbo Commander Bleed Air Environmental System. Charles R. Holt, Aero Commander Bethany Div., North American Rockwell Corp. A unique bleed air environmental system has been developed for the Turbo Commander. This system utilizes air-to-air jet pumps as "flow multipliers" to reduce engine bleed flow requirements. Bleed power extraction is reduced from an unaccep tably high 12% to a more reasonable 6%. The system is integrated with the original air cycle cooling system and heating is by compression heat. The jet pumps furnish a solution to the problem of high bleed power extraction common to turboprops, at a modest increase in cost and weight and at practically no decrease in reliability or maintainability. 690332. On-Board Gas Turbine APU's for Executive Aircraft. J. P. Wojciehowski, AiResearch Mfg. Co. of Arizona Div., Garrett Corp. Gas turbine auxiliary power units (APU) have been used in military aircraft for more than 20 years. This experience has demonstrated the reliability and utilitarian value of the gas turbine auxiliary power unit in providing a-c and d-c power, cabin pressurization, refrigeration, and pneu- matic power for main engine starting. After many years of successful military use, the on-board gas turbine APU was utilized in several commercial airline applications. The inherent advantages of the gas turbine were successfully demonstrated on these initial applications. Today, all new jet transport aircraft are utilizing the on-board APU concept of self-sufficiency. Only recently has this concept been initiated into the executive aircraft field. The advantages are even more desirable for this type of aircraft, since they frequently operate from stations without adequate ground support equipment. This paper discusses briefly the history of the on-board gas turbine APU, a variety of business and utility aircraft applica- tions, and illustrates some of the typical installations. The operational and economic aspects of on-board gas turbines in this class of aircraft are also covered. 690333. Anti-Icing Today's Business Jets. Lawrence D. Smith, Lear Jet Industries, Inc. The extended use of today's business jets has also extended the requirements to operate in all types of weather environments. One of the problems of all-weather operation is the formation of ice on aircraft surfaces, such as windshields, wings, etc., which has plagued pilots and aircraft designers for many years. The complete icing problem, including the types of atmospheric conditions that can produce ice, the types of ice formations that can develop, the types of systems used to prevent or remove ice formations, a method of analyzing the requirements of these systems, and the testing required to develop and prove each system are discussed. The paper is primarily intended to acquaint the analyst or the designer with the requirements and performance criteria of an anti-icing system for a given aircraft. 1969 SA E Transactions 690334. Simplified Fuel Systems for Light Aircraft. Richard G. Reese, Ted Smith Aircraft Co., Inc. Considerable loss of life, injury, property damage, and monetary loss is caused by improper fuel management of both single and multiengine general aviation aircraft each year. To reduce this loss, it is up to the manufacturer to design simplicity into the operation of fuel systems so that ultimately, the pilot need only turn his fuel system on prior to each flight without any further requirements for fuel management until engine shutdown. The fuel capac- ity required by the modern high performance single and twin engine aircraft generally requires multiple tank fuel systems with the associated selector valves that require numerous careful and timely tank selections during the course of the flightt. It is the object of this paper to describe the history of development of the multiple tank fuel system used in all the Aerostar series of aircraft. The finalized system is an on-off system that does not require any in-flight fuel management and is of a fail-safe type of design. 690335. Bioengineering of Impact Survival in Business Aircraft. Richard G. Snyder, University of Michigan. Data from accident investigation of business aircraft involved in survivable accidents indicate that serious injuries and fatality to the occupants occur most fre- quently as a result of the unprotected head and neck or chest flailing in contact with the aircraft controls, instrument panel, or structure. Improvement of current aircraft to provide increased occupant safety and survival during crash impacts is both necessary and feasible. Design considerations include folding seatback locks to prevent collapse, increased seat tiedown to structure, instrument panels and glare shields designed to absorb energy through structural design and padding, stronger seat structure, lateral protection, design and packaging of knobs and projections to minimize injury in contact, and installation of upper torso restraint. In the future passive restraint protection could be provided by current ex- perimental systems such as the air bag, and the use of side control-type devices to eliminate control wheel injuries. The single most important occupant protection advance would be through installation and use of upper torso restraint. 1969 SA E Transactions 690336. Crash Load Vectors in Severe but Survivable Light Plane Accidents. A. Howard Hasbrook, Aeromedicai Research Branch, Federal Aviation Administration. Slow speed, survivable crashes of light weight aircraft are</page><page sequence="46">690337-690343 discussed. In presenting several theoretical cases, varia- tions in vectorial angles and magnitude of crash load are discussed. The effect of crash load vectors is also related to the human occupant. 690337. A Low Cost Inertial Measurement Unit for Business Aircraft. Frank T. Gasper and Herbert S. Ross, Kearfott Systems Div., Singer-General Precision Inc. Dramatic advances in the area of low cost inertial platforms have rapidly hastened inertial navigation applicability for today's commercial and business aircraft. Even in the recent past, a navigation system's inertial measurement unit with its extremely precise sensors, has conventionally been considered a prime source of high cost. A "reduced cost system" which would be attractive to the business and private aircraft market place, should begin, therefore, with a stable element of inherent simplicity featuring drastic new low cost designs and innovations in sensors, components, and fabrication techniques. In addition, these features must offer im- proved reliability, reasonable maintenance concepts, and adequate performance. Finally, in order to insure its acceptance, the design of this low cost IMU must emphasize compatibility with existing aircraft interfaces and procedures. 690338. Complementing VOR/DME with INS - An Improved Navigation System. N. B. Hemesath, D. H. Meyer and H. M. Schweighofen Collins Radio Co. The trends in air navigation, as indicated by military developments and current activity in the development of new aircraft for the airlines point to: 1. Continued use of VOR/DME as the basic short- range (continental) navigation aid. 2. Inertial navigation systems (INS) as the primary long-range navigation aid and source of improved attitude and heading information 3. Increased digital computation and control for navigation and aircraft flight management. This paper discusses how the INS and digital com- puter can be used to complement the VOR/DME system to provide improved navigation accuracy and smoother operation in the VOR/DME environment. 690339. Advanced Concept for Airborne Inverters (Digital Inverter). Richard J. Lukso and Richard E. Spielmaker, Jet Electronics and Technology, Inc. A new and unique type of static inverter (called a Digital Inverter) is described for aircraft in the power range 400-4000va. The advantages of the inverter are precise frequency control, low weight, stiff load driving capabil- ity, and high reliability. 690340. Aircraft Proximity Warning Devices. Wayne G. Shear, Avionics Div., Bendix Corp. Some tangible progress has been made recently in electronic proximity warning devices for specialized applications. This paper discusses recent efforts in this field for U. S. Army Aviation helicopters. Such devices have been demonstrated and are feasible in certain environments. The technical limitations of an interrogator transponder range/altitude proximity warning device are covered. Current status of other radio frequency and infrared proximity warning devices and the compatibility of these devices with the Air Transport Association Collision Avoidance System are discussed. 690341. Potential Structural Materials and Design Con- cepts for Light Airplanes. Ladislao Pazmany, San Diego Aircraft Engineering, Inc. A greatly expanded market for light airplanes and helicopters will be realized only if consumer prices can be reduced sufficiently to accommodate mass financial capability. Although manufacturing practices have min- imized costs as much as possible, the wide disparity in the material/labor cost ratio must be narrowed considerably. A reduction of as much as 49% in customer cost is possible if newer materials and processes are introduced and if automotive mass production methods are used. This paper reports a cost and performance study of aircraft using present methods and materials as compared with others already developed or being developed. 1969 SA E Transactions 690342. Application of Glass-Reinforced Plastic Molding Compounds in the OV-10A Airplane. David N. Ulry, Columbus Div., North American Rockwell Corp. Glass-reinforced plastic molding compounds have demon- strated functional reliability with significant cost savings in certain portions of the OV-10A aircraft. New applica- tions of these materials could form the foundation for revolutionary changes in aircraft construction. These materials, formulated of fiber reinforcements and thermo- setting plastic resin binders, are currently in use in many nonstructural portions of military and commercial air- craft. Development of new higher strength reinforcing fibers and resin systems offers the promise of widespread use of die molded plastics throughout all portions of flight vehicles, including structural components. 1969 SA E Transactions 690343. Metallurgical and Production Developments of Cryogenic Quenching. E. Dullberg and M. Meyer, Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corp. Cryogenic quenching ("cryoquenching") is a process whereby the substitution of liquid nitrogen for water as the quenching medium during the heat-treat cycle pro- duces distortion-free parts. Cryoquenching is now saving thousands of man-hours in the aerospace industry and has substantially increased the tool life of drop hammer dies, form dies, and press blocks. When fully optimized, the process will ultimately lead to an automated heat-treating 111</page><page sequence="47">690344-690350 112 opération, with high-quality hardware, manufactured at minimum cost, as the end product. 1969 SA E Transactions 690344. Distance-Measuring Equipment for the Super- sonic Transport and the Corporate Twin. Paul G. Wulfsberg and John L. Aker, King Radio Corp. VOR and DME (VORTAC) provide the major enroute navigation systems in use in the U. S. today. New technology in DME has now provided a system having operational characteristics never previously obtained. Instant frequency channeling and distance search, together with a digital display of distance and ground speed which is virtually errorless, provide new operational flexibility. The unit has no moving parts. In addition, the accuracy of the new DME system is especially timely for area navigation employing a single VORTAC station. It is the purpose of this paper to discuss this DME and the technology which made it possible. The new system is one-half the size and one-third the weight of existing airline DME equipment thus making it excellent for corporate aircraft as well as the supersonic transports of the future whether they be business or airline aircraft. 690345. Design and Operational Considerations for the Course Line Computer. H. W. Beningfield, Narco Avionics Div., Narco Scientific Indus- tries. A course line computer has been developed for use in personal and business aircraft. The design provides accuracy adequate for enroute and terminal area naviga- tion, while minimizing cost. Applications and limitations of the course line computer are discussed. 690346. Electrical Power Sources for Business Aircraft. Theodore T. Tañase and John Camp, Vickers Aerospace Div., Sperry Rand Corp. A new electromechanical constant-speed drive is being developed specifically for business aircraft which require up to 15 kva of conditioned a-c power. This drive offers weight savings generally associated with hydraulic con- stant-speed drives and prices approaching inexpensive inverter systems. The relative weights and prices are shown for all three systems (d-c/inverter, electromechanical, and hydraulic drive) to assist the engineer in choosing the proper electrical power source for his aircraft. 690347. (SP-347) Engineering Know-How in Engine Design - Operation and Application of Hydraulic Valve Lifters. Roy F. Abell, Eaton Saginaw Div., Eaton Yale &amp; Towne, Inc. The theory and practical design of hydraulic valve lifters for modern automotive engines are reviewed. Require- ments for a successful hydraulic valve lifter application are discussed. Service considerations to be kept in mind when using hydraulic lifters are reviewed. 690348. (SP-347) Engineering Know-How in Engine Design - Compressive Strength of Nonmetallic Gaskets. E. M. Smoley and F. J. Kessler, Res. and Dev. Center, Armstrong Cork Co. A compressible gasket composition appears to exhibit a critical strain for a compressive strength failure. The strain is defined from plots of stress or strain versus weight density of the gasket in the state of compression. A method is suggested for measuring the critical strain in joint assemblies exposed to a service environment. Also mentioned is the relationship of the strain to the stress, time, temperature conditions required for a strength failure. A flange test is pointed out as an approach to evaluating strength for elastomeric gaskets. Practical design guides are listed for increasing the resistance of nonmetallic gaskets to strength failures in flanged joint assemblies. 690349. (SP-347) Engineering Know-How in Engine Design - Superior Engine Oils for Mixed-Fleet Service. A. B. Sarkis, Technical Service Dept., Mobil Oil Corp. The development of a superior engine oil, specifically designed to give outstanding performance in mixed-fleets powered by modern diesel and gasoline engines, under a wide variety of applications and service conditions is described. A 10-point program was set up, which started with a study of critical equipment requirements and oil performances in the field and duplicated them in the laboratory to screen experimental formulations. The additive building blocks and their functions are outlined, as well as the specification engine tests which were utilized to screen candidate formulations. The extensive controlled and documentation field tests utilized to verify that the selected candidate does indeed meet the stringent targets outlined at the initiation of the develop- ment program are also described. The oil successfully meets the requirements of the most severe diesel engines in today's fleet market and exceeds MIL-L-2104B specifica- tions as well as the car manufacturers' highest 1969 MS performance in gasoline engines. 1 969 SA E Transactions 690350. California's Industrial Safety Code. Albert C. Beeson, Dept. of Industrial Relations, State of California. California's system for the adoption of safety regulations requires proposed codes to undergo numerous checks and reviews - reasonable assurance that they will be practical and effective. Within these limitations the Division of Industrial Safety has the authority to promulgate safety codes having the effect of law. The arrangement is effective and provides a degree of flexibility, perhaps not available through formalized legislative action, that allows for prompt revision and updating as necessary. Preliminary revision work applicable to California's rollover protection regulations for construction scrapers is now in progress.</page><page sequence="48">690351-690360 690351. Manufacturers9 Approach to Construction Equip- ment Safety. H. T. Larmore, Performance Stand- ards Administration, Construction Industry Manufacturers Association. The manufacturers of construction machinery, through their Construction Industry Manufacturers Association, have developed a performance standards activity to act as a focal point for safety standards for the industry, construction equipment users, and government regulatory bodies. Written policies and procedures guide this activity toward the objectivee of worldwide development and standardization of good safety codes and regulations. Coordination and cooperation with SAE and other technical societies is a vital part of this activity. 690352. Construction Safety - Programming - Manage- ment - Results and Problems. J. J. Williams, Morrison-Knudsen Co., Inc. Safety in the construction industry can best be achieved by management-supervisor-worker-oriented program. Planning and implementation of accident prevention is advisable through employee training, job evaluation, and the development of a procedural safety manual and inspection standards as a routine function. Competency in maintenance, assembly, repair, and cleanup, are essential in the area of equipment. 690353. Comparison of Time Domain and Frequency Domain Analysis of Off-Road Vehicles. William F. Lins, Francis B. Hoogterp and Fred Pradko, Scientific Computer Div., Mobility Systems Lab., Army Tank- Automoti ve Command. An investigation of the differences involved in using time domain and frequency domain techniques to analyze the dynamic response of a vehicle traversing nondeformable, off-road terrain is described. A comparison among the computed results, the computation times, and the costs for each method is made. A comparison showing simulation on both analog and digital computers is also presented. 690354. Desert Testing of Military Vehicles. William L. Snider, Yuma Proving Ground, Dept. of the Army. The desert environment, its effect on the operation of military vehicles, and the procedures by which the U. S. Army insures that equipment is capable of successful operation in the desert are described. The recent history of military operations in desert areas is briefly reviewed to show the origins of the requirement for environmental testing, and tests performed by Yuma Proving Ground as a part of the Test and Evaluation Command's indepen- dent evaluation of Army vehicles are described. Criteria for successful operation in the desert and some of the problems experienced are discussed to show the need for careful attention to environmental factors early in the design of new vehicles. 690355. Mobile Data Acquisition System. Arthur O. Beer, Construction Equipment Div., Westinghouse Air Brake Co. Mobile data acquisition systems are described and compared. A recent system using RF telemetry for job site load cycle data acquisition from earthmoving equipment is discussed. 690357. Soil Bin Scale-Model Testing. James T. Gray, Earthmoving Equipment Div., General Motors Corp. New soil bin facilities are described. Fundamental values of soil bin scale-model testing are discussed. One of the major values of soil bin scale-model testing is the reliable prediction of vehicle performance by "scaling-up" of the soil bin scale-model data. Recent studies have shown that scraper model and full-size loading force correlations can be made, and that crawler tractor model and full-size drawbar force correlations can be also made. 690358. Hydromechanical Transmissions as Applied to Mobile Equipment. John G. Macdonald, Domin- ion Road Machinery Co., Ltd. A direct hydrostatic transmission was tested in a grader in 1961 and 1962. Certain difficulties experienced led to the development in 1963 of a novel hydromechanical trans- mission using the same pump and motor units. Fifty graders using this new hydromechanical transmission have been placed in service since 1964. Some of these transmissions have now recorded over 8000 hr operation in the field. The development and operating principles of the new transmission are described. 690359. The Nulastic Damper - A New Concept in Torsional Vibration Control. Ralph H. Katzen- berger and Sanford A. McGavern, Schwitzer Div., Wallace-Murray Corp. Increased displacement and operating speeds of internal- combustion engines as well as higher combustion pres- sures have compounded the problem of crankshaft torsional vibration control. A new type of vibration damper has been developed which combines the advan- tages of both the tuned absorber and pure viscous types and which can be produced at a lower cost than conventional viscous designs. 690360. Engine Converter Performance and Vehicle Ap- plication. D. F. Mueller, Allison Div., General Motors Corp. The torque converter function, a method of matching engines and converters, and some general factors relating to application of torque converter type transmissions in vehicles are presented. Also, various types of torque converters and torque converter transmissions are review- ed to show how the hydrodynamic transmission concept has been tailored to special duty for special vehicle classes. In obtaining a familiarization with and a speaking knowledge of the terminology associated with torque 113</page><page sequence="49">690361-690368 114 converter transmissions, the vehicle design engineer will have another tool at his disposal to aid in the preliminary selection of promising vehicle power package components. Thus, correlation between the vehicle design engineer and the transmission application engineer can be reduced to a minimum, and a quicker final selection can be effected. 690361. The Vital Shift from Managing Workers to Managing Managers. Thomas S. Roberts, Bu- reau of Industrial Relations, University of Michigan. Successfully moving up through the managerial ranks creates special problems for engineers. Not only must they learn how to deal with subordinate managers who behave differently from workers, but they must master a basic change of orientation. Inability to make this vital shift severely limits individual potential as well as organiza- tional potential. 1969 SA E Transactions 690362. Management Research Methods for Engineering Managers - A Progress Report on an Ex- perimental Graduate Course. Charles W. N. Thompson, Technological Inst., Northwestern Univ., and Bradley Univ. As part of a graduate program in engineering administra- tion, a class of 16 experienced engineering managers were offered a course in methods used by academic researchers to study the research and development process. The academic researcher's development of propositions which he then tests through field study or experiment was presented as a method analogous to the design and testing process which the engineer uses for solving technical problems. Each engineering manager selected a manage- ment problem which he was concerned with, developed his propositions, and tested them under laboratory conditions. The class was able to use this method in evaluating management problems and proposed solutions, but, as of the time of this report, no field testing has been accomplished. 690363. Systems Analysis as a Research Tool for the Construction and Earthmoving Industry. Lloyd E. Johnson, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Engineers and scientists concerned with the creation of intricate organizations of equipment and people have evolved numerous useful analytical techniques which have become a discipline, the science of systems. Prodducers of major components for earthmoving and construction machines, as well as customers for complete systems, profit by using proved simulation techniques to predict and to optimize overall performance before making major investments in hardware. Research managers can utilize such system-oriented techniques to develop forecasts of technological objectives and to plan, organize, and evaluate complete research programs. Methods being evolved will enable them to integrate more rationally such incommensurate factors as psychological, social, political, and economic values. 690364. Oil Shale Will Demand Efficient Materials Handling. Stanley H. Dayton and Douglas Carthew, Engineering and Mining Journal. The state of the art for in situ methods is not sufficiently developed for commercial recovery of oil from shale, and therefore, underground room and pillar mining will probably be the first methods used. However, this will involve equipment that is associated with large scale, open pit mining. Practically all investigations of commercial oil extraction have been confined to relatively thin strata in a small area held by private firms because the formations that range from 1000-2000 ft thickness lie within public lands and are not open to leasing. This paper describes present commercial resources, methods used in extracting oil from shale, and projected development. 690365. California Water Resource Development. Alfred R. Golze, Dept. of Water Resources, Resources Agency, State of California. Construction of California's great State Water Project requires moving almost 1/2 billion cu yd of material, enough to construct about 137 pyramids the size of the Great Pyramid of Egypt. The state's mushrooming population, which has made it no. 1 in the nation, and the continuing demands of its agricultural industry for more and more irrigation water have led to construction of a multibillion dollar project. Construction of the many dams, power, and pumping plants, and miles of aqueducts has employed large fleets of earthmoving equipment. This paper briefly portrays California's water resource develop- ment program; describes in some detail the major construction features of the State Water Project and the role of earthmoving equipment in its construction. 690367. Conservation of Power for an Elevating Scraper Hydraulic System. Daniel B. Shore, Melrose Park Works, International Harvester Co. A systems approach towards reducing power losses in hydraulic systems includes: (l)a flow sensitive hydraulic detent release which automatically returns a control valve to neutral when the cylinder reaches the end of its stroke; (2)a two pump steering system that provides a power savings during small corrections by discharging the large pump flow at low pressure; and (3)the secondary applica- tion for a pump in order to avoid increased total system delivery. 690368. Hose, Tube Assemblies, and Related Hydraulic Components. Michael A. Chermak, Eastman Div., I-T-E Imperial Corp. A state-of-the-art report on recent progress made by the hose and tube assembly industry, this report includes the latest developments in hose, coupling practices, bent tubing, product reliability, and manufacturing processes and describes how these new concepts are intended to aid the mobile equipment designer. Also included, is a brief insight into future requirements and the problems which must be overcome to reach these goals.</page><page sequence="50">690370-690377 690370. The Athey Blade - A New Concept for a Practical Maintenance Grading Machine. R. A. Esmonde and J. L. Highfill, Athey Products Corp. A new concept for a practical maintenance grading machine, including details of previous equipment and studies made to determine what improvements and new concepts could be incorporated, is discussed. The en- gineering and manufacturing program planned and executed to complete design and development of a prototype unit within a specified time period is described. Engineering features of the unit such as power train, hydraulics, and circuits are explained. Special emphasis is placed on the study made on appearance and styling; to the achievement of operating improvements; and to the design steps taken to insure ease of serviceability and machine maintenance. Data are supplied on tests on the prototype including initial durability trials, engine performance trials, and subsequent field trials by a variety of operators. Results of these trials were then translated into improvements in the production model. The paper concludes with a description of the production unit and gives applications for this equipment in construction and earthmoving industries. 690371. Sonic Testing of Gray Iron Sleeve Castings to Predict Tensile Strength. Donald A. Rhoda, Perfect Circle Sleeve Div., Dana Corp. The application of resonant frequency measurements and their correlation with casting properties (that is, tensile strength, modulus of elasticity, etc.) has been in limited use in this country for several years. This paper describes the installation of this method of nondestructive testing to predict tensile strength of alloyed gray iron sleeve castings. A statistical approach was used to analyze and reduce the raw data to a workable quality control tool. 1969 SA E Transactions 690372. Answers Not Found in Engineering Handbooks. C. G. A. Rosen, List-Rosen-Wittek Associates, Inc. Although engineering handbooks represent an achieve- ment in cooperative problem solving, an engineer cannot rely on handbooks alone to define causes. Essential to locating the grounds for a solution is a combination of technical and nontechnical abilities. A sharpened sense of analysis, reliance on experience as well as training, and conscious effort to be creative are needed. 690375. The Piloťs Choice - Off the End or Off the Side of the Runway. Philip Donely, Langley Research Center, NASA. The study of deceleration and control of aircraft on the ground is particularly interesting when ground friction has disappeared. If, for any reason, ground friction is lost or only sliding friction exists, the crew must depend on aerodynamic and propulsive forces to control and decel- erate the airplane. This requires the highest degree of skill and understanding of the vehicle on the part of the crew. The purpose of this paper is to indicate the forces, favorable and unfavorable, acting on an airplane during ground roll when the pilot is faced with a slick surface and a cross-wind. Since aircraft differ widely in their detailed characteristics, a "composite" jet transport has been developed on which to base some simple calculations. The discussion may be considered as calling attention again to the fundamental elements of the deceleration and control of aircraft on the ground. 690376. Effective Braking - A Key to Air Transportation Progress. L. S. McBee, Douglas Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. The progress of aircraft braking systems is reviewed. Current areas of study relating to systems, brakes, tires and runway interface are discussed. Studies are under way by companies and agencies, both foreign and domestic, for improvement of braking efficiencies to meet future needs. These studies include the topics of brake designs, heat sink material, braking control, tire runway interface and tire design. The specific subject of tire-runway interface has received considerable attention during the past few years. The interface phenomenon involves many facets. Particular emphasis has been directed to friction measurements of runways for both wet and dry conditions, aircraft braked roll-out distances while on wet runways, and friction improve- ments which may be realized through runway grooving and water removal. The above topics are reviewed and an accounting of the work in progress at Douglas in runway water removal and roll-out prediction contract work for the FAA is given. The current studies are a guide to future develo- pments. A practical look is taken at brake materials, cooling concepts, and skid control systems which may be expected in the future. Effective aircraft braking cannot be attained without satisfactory surface contact to provide good ground coefficients. Accordingly, tire-runway inter- face, runway grooving, water control, and runway friction measuring equipment will contribute to future braking. The most radical concept for commercial air trans- portation is the use of recovery equipment which can potentially eliminate many braking problems. 1969 SA E Transactions 690377. An Operational Viewpoint of Jet Airport Run- ways. Mel Volz, United Air Lines, Inc. Basic design, construction, and operation of a jet runway are reviewed from the operational viewpoint. In basic runway design the controlling factors are usually site location and climatology. A prime requisite during the construction of a new jet runway is the need for a high coefficient of friction between the airplane tire and the runway. An analysis of factors affecting runway design such as: texturing of surfaces, drainage requirements, in-runway 115</page><page sequence="51">690378-690384 116 lighting, seal coating of surfaces, and runway grooving is presented. Further complicating the problem of runway design, natural elements such as water, slush, ice, and snow have to be considered and provision for the elimination of accumulations must be made. If jumbo jets are to be operated safely and reliably, jet operational runway problems must be solved. 690378. A Review of Operational Experience and Pilot Considerations for Aircraft Ground Operations. Paul A. Roitsch, Pan American World Airways, Inc. A study of jet transport accidents occurring in the ground phase of operations has produced interesting findings. The refused takeoff is the most critical maneuver in ground operations. Neither runway slipperiness nor engine failure has proved to be a dominant factor in the precariousness of this operation. Activities are reviewed that can and must take place before a deceleration is attempted in order to enhance the probability of an unexciting stop. The contributions of several supporting institutions in these activities are outlined. Emphasis is placed on pilot anticipation of conditions and preplanning actions. Once all precommitment activities are properly ac- complished, the deceleration itself is relatively straight- forward. The physical techniques using known airplane dynamics are briefly discussed. 1969 SA E Transactions 690379. GE4 Supersonic Transport Engine-Development Progress and Status. J. C. Pirtle, General Electric Co. The Phase III program for development of the U.S. supersonic transport was initiated on January 1, 1967. This program includes design and flight qualification of the engine, and 100 hr. of flight test in two prototype aircraft. The GE4 Phase III development program, now entering its third year, has passed several major miles- tones. Prototype engines have been built and tested to thrust levels in excess of 63,000 lb. Component tests, sea level engine tests, and simulated flight 'testing are being conducted and results are described. A general description is provided of the engine, its performance, and the design features to meet the requirements of the commercial supersonic transport. Technology advancements in com- ponent design, materials and joining techniques are described as they relate to the development program. A brief discussion of development problems encountered and their solutions is included. 690380. Propulsion Requirements for the Future STOL Transport. Gerald L. Brines, Commercial V/STOL Propulsion, Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft. The influence of some of the key performance char- acteristics of typical future STOL transport aircraft on the requirements of the propulsion system is examined. Airplane characteristics such as take-off field length, cruise altitude, cruise speed and range are examined to see how they influence the choice of engine cycle. The effect of engine design variables, such as overall pressure ratio, bypass ratio for turbofans and turbine temperature, are discussed. Potential trade-offs of engine thrust to weight ratio, performance, and cost are reviewed. Propulsion system installation and integration problems peculiar to the STOL transport are also discussed. 690381. Booster Engines for Commercial Airliners. Harry E. Shaner, Allison Div., General Motors Corp. Some of the fundamental advantages of using special booster engines for augmenting the takeoff thrust of commercial transports are discussed. The additional thrust provided by this principal offers increased route segment versatility by providing a wider range of tradeoffs in the takeoff distance, payload, range, safety, and noise level patterns for a particular aircraft. It further describes the flexibility in configurations that this principle provides the manufacturer for a given model. Also discussed in general terms is how the limited flight envelope and short operating time required for booster engines can be used to effectively reduce the engine's weight and volume. 1969 SA E Transactions 690383. New York State's Role in Meeting Total Trans- portation Needs. J. Burch McMorran, New York State Commissioner of Transportation. New York State Department of Transportation plans for carrying out its programs for highway improvements, amounting to more than one billion dollars a year, and immediate and long-range plans for all modes of travel in the state - automobile, bus, subway, truck, railroad, ship, and airplane - are discussed. Such future possibilities as dial-a-bus systems, air cushion and electric automobiles, and "third generation" roads for directing vehicles at high speeds to distant points by means of electronic sensory devices are covered briefly. 690384. Regulation of the U.S. Inland Water Trans- portation System. Noah Prawdę, Bureau of Operations, Interstate Commerce Commission. The United States inland waterway transportation system is reviewed in terms of the waterway upon which the carriers operate, the carriers and their equipment, and government regulation of the system. A historical review of the system prior to 1940 is presented. Initially, various states made necessary improvements on rivers and harbors, but in 1818 Congress determined the federal government had the power and responsibility to pursue waterway development. The prime government policy governing our domestic waterways was that they remain free common highways accessible to ali without tax or toll. In 1940 part III of the Interstate Commerce Act was added, further regulating water transportation by the federal government. Since 1940 inland water carriers increased their</page><page sequence="52">690386-690391 operational capacity through use of more powerful vessels, larger barges, and development of navigational aides, permitting around-the-clock operation. Some future innovations attracting attention are containerization, LASH containership cargo handling, hovercraft, and hydrofoil vessels. 690386. Dynamic Simulation - A Tool for Engine Compo- nent Design. William B. Gardner and Frank Sampl, Jr., Pratt and Whitney Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. The dynamic simulation of a gas turbine engine is shown to be a valuable tool for the component design of the engine. A brief discussion of simulation methodology is followed by three examples of how a dynamic simulation can be used. Thhe first example discusses the design of an engine when the conflicting requirements of rapid engine acceleration and distortion tolerance are considered; and how dynamic simulation can point out trouble areas. The second example discusses how dynamic simulations can aid the engine designer in the selection of engine configuration. The third example shows how dynamic simulations can be used to select and modify the operation of the engine control system so that overall engine stability is improved. 690387. Design Considerations for Large Fan Blades. J. I. Goatham, Rolls-Royce Ltd. Design problems associated with large fan blades our outlined. A discussion of some of the major points arising from the aerodynamic program which initiated the mechanical design and rig test program to support it is included. General design considerations are briefly cov- ered and the discussion is concluded by considering problems of designing fans with acceptable vibration characteristics and also designing with new materials. 1969 SA E Transactions 690388. Design Criteria for Turbomachinery Periodic Structures to Improve Tolerance to Inflow Distor- tion and Resonant Oscillatory Flows. J. S. Alf ord, General Electric Co. Typical problems caused by pressure waves of large amplitude propagating in a circumferential direction in turbomachinery are discussed. Opportunities for design control of cascade resonance as a means of protecting turbomachinery from these pressure waves are presented. Some of the critical areas are compressor rear frame diffuser and main combustor instability, afterburner screech, shock wave flutter instability of high-pressure ratio, variable-geometry jet nozzles, compressor stall, compressor stage 1 blade fatigue failures, and labyrinth air seal fatigue failures caused by flexural vibration of the thin walls.

Morrison, Boeing Co., Commercial Airplane Div. The development of the 747 nacelle was divided into four distinct programs: 1.The outdoor test rig X-307 at Pratt &amp; Whitney. 2. The B-52 flying test bed based at Bradley Field near Hartford, Connecticut. 3. The Boeing ground test rigs in the Seattle area. 4. The Boeing 747 flight test airplanes. These tests appear to be paying off in the trouble-free operation demonstrated in the flight tests to date. The low drag of the airplane from tests conducted so far indicates success in making a slim, aerodynamically efficient nacelle. The good serviceability demonstrated in the 747 nacelle design has contributed by keeping the flight test program moving. The use of borescope inspection pro- cedures has eliminated needless engine removals for teardown inspections. 690390. Propulsion System Design for Maintainability in the Lockheed 1011. John F. Stroud, L-101 1 Fluid Mechanics.; and C. R. Davenport, LIO 11 Main- tainability Design. The steps involved in design and development of the L-101 1 propulsion system, with emphasis on maintenance aspects of the program, are summarized. System require- ments, including maintainability and reliability, perfor- mance, and noise are reviewed. Major factors leading to determination of the propulsion system configuration are summarized and the rationale for meeting requirements of the various components leading to a well balanced propulsion system is presented. It is shown that the three-spool RB.211 engine satisfies requirements for minimum maintenance of the basic engine. The paper also indicates advantages of an intermediate-length cowl in conjunction with an integral fan duct and reverser and engine accessories mounted externally on the fan case. Finally, certain key design features of the propulsion system are described as they relate to system and component maintainability. 1969 SA E Transactions 690391. Douglas Design for Powerplant Reliability and Maintainability. L. A. Wright and J. W. Jon- geneel, Douglas Aircraft Co. Reduction of aircraft maintenance costs has been a challenge to aircraft operators for many years. It is well known that powerplant maintenance costs are a signifi- cant percentage of these total costs. Douglas Aircraft Co. is using new methods, checks, and controls during the early design phases to guarantee that established goals for the DC- 10 will be achieved. Programs have been develop- ed that will result in high system reliability and ensure optimum maintainability. This paper describes the imple- mentation of these programs for powerplants and asso- ciated systems. 117</page><page sequence="53">690392-690398 118 690392. Area Navigation in the Common System. Robert W. Martin, Federal Aviation Administration. Area navigation offers a means of establishing an air route system without the constraints entailed in flying toward or away from the signal source. In terminal areas, an area navigation system of routes, combined with air traffic control computer-aided sequencing and airborne colli- sion-avoidance technology, offers possibilities for estab- lishing future methods of moving high volumes of traffic on and off a complex of multiple parallel runways. Such a system would reduce air-ground communications and controller workloads which are serious limiting factors in today's system. In the en route system, the use of area navigation will result in more efficient utilization of airspace, although regimentation of traffic will continue to be necessary in areas of high traffic density. An area navigation system, based on VOR/DME inputs is possible in the near future. The use of precision and doppler VOR inputs in a system of area navigation should make a reduction in lateral separation possible, particularly in airspace close to the signal source. 690393. United Air Lines' Evaluation of the Hughes Pictorial Navigation System. Roger J. Phaneuf, United Air Lines, Inc. A moving map display system, developed as a joint project by the Hughes Aircraft Co., United Air Lines, and Jeppesen Co., was installed in a Boeing 727 and operated for approximately 193 flight hours, primarily in the high traffic density environment between the Chicago and New York areas. As a result of the evaluation program, the advantages of navigation without the geographic restrictions of ground based radio aids were further substantiated. In addition, it was concluded by United flight crew person- nel that the operational advantages of a pictorial display were sufficient to make the display an essential compo- nent in any area navigation system. Also recognized was the fact that this system can represent only a single step in what must be a large integrated program including all the participants in Air Traffic Control, both ground based and airborne. 690394. An Airline Looks at Area Navigation. Stanley L. Seltzer, American Airlines, Inc. To evaluate area navigation techniques in the air traffic control system, a series of test programs have been undertaken by American Airlines. Operations have been conducted in various types of jet transports during the course of regular airline service. Systems used were based mainly on VOR/DME signals, but some tests involved use of an inertial navigation system. Further trials are currently in progress as part of the airline STOL evaluation project in which a number of additional systems are being examined. 1969 SA E Transactions 690395. Ground Access to a Choice of Airports. Martin S. Gordon, Abt Associates, Inc. A survey of ground access/egress patterns at the three Washington area airports, including local origin/destina- tion as well as ground modal choice, suggests that a major factor in airport ground congestion is the presence of airport visitors other than air travelers and employees. These extraneous visitors are largely generated by inade- quate public transportation services for travelers with suburban origins and destinations. The problem may be somewhat alleviated by tailoring air service so as to provide separate suburban catchment areas for each airport. 690396. Rail Access to Airports: A Perspective View. Edward S. Olcott, General Planning Div., Port of New York Authority. As the aviation industry continues to grow, one of the most vexing problems it faces is movement of large numbers of people between center cities and the airport. The author points out that rail transit is not a universal panacea to the solution of the problem; rather the answer must be tailored to specific factors relating to individual airports and their role in the particular urban transport complex. A detailed comparison of JFK International Airport (where rail transit is feasible) and Newark Airport (where it is not) in terms of traffic potential, inconvenience, travel time, effects on existing commuter facilities, and costs is included, illustrating that generalization is not the answer. The aviation industry must look upon ground trans- portation as an integral part of the total aviation and airport system of this country and must include it in planning to meet present and anticipated future condi- tions. 690397. Potential of Abandoned Rail Right of Way as Means for Airport Access. Frederick A. Koo- manoff, Alan M. Voorhees and Assoc., Inc. Use of railroad rights of way linking airports in hub regions by means of dispersed collection and distribution points in urban and suburban areas for processing passengers and their baggage is proposed as a potential solution to the critical airport processing and access problem. The creation of a Federal Land Bank to hold in escrow abandoned railroad rights of way and to obtain land outside of metropolitan areas for large airports is recommended. 690398. Guideways to Airways - Intermodal Access Problem. Dwight M. B. Baumann and Steven H. Kaiser, Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The airport is but a part of the transportation system of an urban area. While access to the airport is a significant problem faced by millions of travelers and affects a wider spectrum of our population each year, it does not yet command a sufficiently large urban transportation mar- ket, as compared to the urban commuter market, to justify</page><page sequence="54">690399-690405 the construction of airport-access-only, ground-trans- portation systems. Dual-mode vehicle systems that combine the advan- tages of both automobile and transit systems are investi- gated as potential solutions to the airport access problem. These are particularly interesting because they also show promise of a major solution to the general urban transportation problem. Special consideration of an airport access system as a demonstration site for new urban transportation projects is presented. 1969 SA E Transactions 690399. Airport Terminal Planning for Tomorrow's Air- craft. Thomas M. Sullivan, Dallas-Fort Worth Regional Airport Board. Using the Dallas-Fort Worth Regional Airport as a reference point, the author considers the major prerequi- sites of airport terminal planning. A general criterion is projected concerning expansion and automation. With passenger convenience in mind, the paper stresses the importance of building terminals in stages as increasing traffic warrants and suggests that suitable backup meas- ures should be provided as security against automation failures. Terminal layout problems are discussed together with their possible solutions, as related to such factors as population density and available land space. 696400. Air Freight An Engineering Challenge. R. F. Lambert, American Airlines, Inc. Some programs that air carriers are currently testing are discussed, including an air flotation system for freight container movement and use of linear induction motors to power rails for baggage cart movement. Current jet freighters can carry approximately 80,000 lb. of cargo. There are current problems related to this massive cargo movement which require solutions, but there will be even greater problems in the immediate future when jumbo jets carrying upwards of 300,000 lb of cargo are in operation. Some of the problems yet to be faced include the lack of real estate for freight terminals on the airport proper, methods of loading large cargo containers, development of intermodal containers and implementation of com- puterized bookkeeping methods. 690401. New Approaches to Airport Access. Robert A. Nelson, Office of High Speed Ground Trans., Dept. of Trans. The Office of High Speed Ground Transportation has chosen two situations in which to consider the usefulness of high speed ground transportation for airport access. One would involve rail passenger service to and from an airport. The other would test the feasibility and practi- cality of an advanced high speed ground system. Although both projects would take the form of demonstrations, nevertheless the Office is doing as complete feasibility analysis as possible prior to any commitment to hardware. Plans for each of these projects are discussed. 690402. Metropolitan Airports for V/STOL Aircraft. Albert C. Martin, Albert C. Martin and Asso- ciates. The growing crisis of airport congestion, both in the air and on the ground, is stimulating interest in the concept of specialized downtown airports for carriers of short-haul traffic. These carriers principally are short takeoff (STOL) and vertical takeoff (VTOL) aircraft. Although these types of aircraft have been in use for years, manufacturers are now working on development of larger and faster short-haul aircraft. At the same time, both federal and local government agencies are studying various V/STOL- port proposals. In New York City, a 10-story 2000-ft long STOL-port with dual runway is envisioned on Man- hattan's Hudson River waterfront. Los Angeles has completed a plan for a downtown Metroport for V/STOL aircraft, designed to reduce noise levels by directing aircraft over freeways, and to accommodate 6 million passengers by 1980. 690403. Control Concepts for a High Bypass Aircraft Turbofan Engine. David A. Evens, Woodward Governor Co. The engine main fuel and geometry control design concepts and their relation to engine requirements for a large, high bypass, aircraft turbofan engine are examined. This class of engine is representative of those powering the new "airbus" type aircraft which are currently under development. The functional design highlights of a simple, efficient, and compact control system are discussed and related to reliability, maintainability, and weight. 1969 SA E Transactions 690404. Lucas Fuel System and Electrics Applied on the RB.211 Engine. E. H. Warne, Lucas Gas Tur- bine Equipment Ltd. The increasing requirements of the modern advanced technology engine have involved a reappraisal of control philosophy to achieve the optimum form of control to suit a specific application, taking into account the need to produce the best engine performance, and at the same time maintain the highest reliability. Control system requirements have been considered and a system evolved which is described for the Rolls Royce RB.211 engine. The philosophies underlying this choice are presented and the hybrid electrical control system is discussed in detail. 1969 SA E Transactions 690405. The JT9D Engine Control System. Robert J. Bussolari, Hamilton Standard Div., United Aircraft Corp. The JT9D turbofan engine, soon to be in airline service on the next generation of advanced jet aircraft, will incor- porate the Hamilton Standard JFC 68 main fuel control and EVC 3 engine vane control. Now in production, this control system embodies advanced control technology while retaining the basic advantages of present opera- tional systems. Its specific advantages are improvements 119</page><page sequence="55">690406-690412 120 in weight, performance, reliability, and durability over present commercial jet engine control systems. This paper presents a discussion of the design philosophy used in creating the system, a description of the system, and some advanced techniques used in its development. 1969 SAE Transactions 690406. LAMS B-52 Flight Experiments in Direct Lift Control. J. A. Lee and R. P. Johannes, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base. The results of a limited flight evaluation of direct lift control on a modified B-52 aircraft are reported. The evaluation was made in conjunction with concluding flights of the Load Alleviation and Mode Stabilization Program and represents the first flight testing of a blended closed-loop direct lift control system on an aircraft of this size and weight. By allowing the pitch and heave motions in the longitudinal axis to be decoupled, the system provided positive control of altitude displacements while holding pitch attitude constant. In both ILS approaches and aerial refueling tasks, controllability was significantly improved and pilot workload was reduced. 690407. Design and Development of the Fail Operative Automatic Landing System for the Lockheed L-1011. John A. Gorham, Lockheed-California Co. The operational characteristics, design processes and test programs which have been established to produce a fail-operative automatic landing system for the Lockheed TriStar are described. The operational characteristics are predicated on the anticipated changes in ATC procedures during the 1970's which may lead to increased automation of the airborne elements. The design processes involve the use of new electronic voting techniques and the considera- tion of the total airplane systems in view of the critical aspects of failure modes and effects. The test program is outlined and the use of many iterative stages of compre- hensive test facilities are described. Conclusions are made that unexpected benefits have been derived by the adoption of the total systems approach. 1969 SAE Transactions 690408. Human Factors in the All- Weather Approach. J. M. Naish and M. F. von Wieser, McDonnell Douglas Corp. Effects which normally diminish the value of a manually flown instrument approach are examined in the light of flight test results with the "head- up display". It is possible to avoid shortsightedness (space myopia) and disorienta- tion phenomena associated with poor external visibility, by choice of display position and format, allowing an efficient alternation between display and forward view. The display can also be designed to fit the man, in both static and dynamic characteristics, with benefits of rapid learning and accurate tracking. These results remove the basis for supposing man's intervention in the_ all-weather landing to be disastrous. On the other hand, man's participation may be necessary, because more information is connected with a safe approach than can be dealt with by an unaided machine. Synthesis of an automatic system with headup display may turn out to be the most acceptable solution to the overall problem of all-weather operation. 690409. Design and Control of the 747 Exhaust Reverser Systems. Stuart K. Wood and Joe McCoy, Boeing Co. The reversers for the 747 have been designed to produce a system that would be maintenance free, safe, reliable, and with adequate power always available for consistent function. These goals required ingenious design in structure, support systems, actuation, and control. To support these designs extensive test programs were required to cover the entire range of scale model testing, reingestion testing, nozzle testing, material selection, full scale component testing, full scale ground testing and flight testing. The first concern was in obtaining adequate power, which was resolved by using a hybrid air and a mechanical system, each to its best advantage. Detail design, maintainability, and reliability were then built into the system. Records of existing Boeing airplanes were studied and used as a guide whenever a trade study affecting either maintainability or reliability had to be made. 690410. Rolls-Royce Thrust Reversers - Compatibility and Reliability. M. J. Green, Rolls-Royce Ltd. Rolls Royce has been developing thrust reversers and noise suppressors since 1956 and over the years has produced units for a variety of civil and military aircraft. This paper describes the various models and specifies the essential requirements that ensure compatability and reliability among major applications. 690411. Design Features of the CF6 Engine Thrust Reverser and Spoiler. Dean Lennard, General Electric Co. The significant design features of the General Electric CF6 thrust reverser and spoiler are described, with emphasis on those items resulting from major operational and maintainability requirements. Specific items covered include operational characteristics, maintainability fea- tures, noise treatment, structural concepts and the control and actuation system. Also included is the development test program which has been established to assure high confidence in the capability of the reverser and spoiler designs to produce customer satisfaction when the CF6 engine is introduced into airline service as the powerplant for the McDonnell Douglas DC- 10. 690412. The SNECMA Thrust Reverser System of Con- corde's Prototypes. E. Caffier, SNECMA. The particular design of the SNECMA thrust reverser on Concorde results specifically from the general nacelle arrangement, and also from the exhaust system require-</page><page sequence="56">690413-690418 ments. In this context, the author justifies the present arrangement of the SNECMA thrust reverser system. He describes in detail the technological features and the tests completed, which allowed the thrust reverser system to meet performance, safety, airworthiness, and operational requirements for the flight development phase on the Concorde prototype. In this respect, further consideration is given to the reliability and maintenance aspects, as an important feature of the design. 690413. Total Airline Profit Model Program. R. B. Ormsby, Lockheed-Georgia Co. The total airline profit model program was developed to permit simulation and evaluation of total air cargo systems including the airplane; ground support equip- ment; cargo handling equipment; facilities and documen- tation; maintenance equipment and facilities; and person- nel. To aid in the identification of major system elements and in order to determine the relative bearing of these elements on profit and return on investment two air cargo system models were developed. The incremental profit model provides a measure of the incremental effect on airline profit of specific changes with respect to a baseline system. In comparison, the airline profit model provides definition of the total system, identification of associated cost elements, and the capa- bility to optimize the system for best economic operation. 1969 SA E Transactions 690414. Long Term Trends in Airlines Economics. James E. Gorham, Stanford Research Institute. To carry the tremendously increased passenger and cargo traffic expected by 1980, the airlines will have to expand their investment base, mainly in a highly competitive capital market. From an economics point of view, the airline industry's growth has also created some bad habits. Because reequipment cycles are geared to technological change, not to traffic service requirements, there has been a poor match between capacity growth and traffic support. This has had a disasterous impact on earnings, somewhat saved by lower break-even load factors and longer stage lengths, particularly in the last few years. However, if airline earnings continue to show a fluctua- ting pattern in the face of traffic and investment expansions ahead, disenchantment of equity capital investors and the lending public will make it difficult to secure the needed funds. Better management tools for cost control and operations monitoring, simulation of opera- tions before actual purchase, computer use wherever possible, and development of software to tap growing data bases for management information are suggested as improvements needed to counter this pattern. With rising pressures on equipment and supply costs, and limited technology-based cost reductions in prospect, cost control offers the only hopes for economic stability and sound future development of air transportation. 690415. Passenger Airplane Economics and Systems Application Considerations for Airline Opera- tions. Robert A. Taylor, Boeing Co. Fleet planning is the joint effort of the airplane manu- facturer and the airline in selecting the proper type and number of airplanes, and it involves analysis of individual airplane models, routes, and costs. When the evaluation is extended to entire fleets, it necessitates forecasts into the changing technological and marketing aspects of the industry. The subject of this paper is Boeing's integrated fleet planning program, a system which lends a sophisti- cated computer support to airline operations. 690416. Implementation of Successful VTOL Service. R. W. deDecker, Vertol Div., Boeing Co. The benefits to be derived from the implementation of a successful large-scale VTOL passenger service are review- ed, and various studies are examined, including the Northeast Corridor VTOL Investigation, which show that suitable aircraft will be available starting in the middle 70's, and that VTOL service can be economically attractive if an operating environment is created that is optimized for VTOL aircraft. If an optimized environment is not created, the implementation of successful VTOL service is very doubtful. Particularly important aspects of the operating environment, such as an air traffic control system, landing and navigation systems, vertiport location and operating regulations, are discussed. 690417. The Potentialities of VTOL Transportation Sys- tems in the Northeast Corridor. D. S. Lawrence and R. H. Shatz, Sikorsky Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. The potentialities of VTOL systems are examined in terms of cost effectiveness. A comparison of VTOL, STOL, and CTOL systems shows that the operational cost effec- tiveness of the VTOL system is at least competitive, and is frequently advantageous. When the costs of ground facilities, ground access time, and social penalties are added, VTOL is seen to have a significant advantage over CTOL and STOL systems. 690418. The Role of STOL in the Northeast Corridor. Lynn L. Bollinger, General Aircraft Corp. Well-proved, existing STOL technology today stands ready to serve increasingly urgent needs in the Northeast Corridor economically and profitably. There are no technical obstacles. A modernized regulatory framework appears to be the next requirement for progress. Federal authorities, however, are necessarily dependent upon a modicum of industry consensus and guidance. This has to date been conspicuously missing. The case studies and commentary in this paper are presented to help give industry personnel a better understanding of aspects on which unified action appears desirable. 121</page><page sequence="57">690419-690425 122 690419. Compound Helicopter as a Short-Haul Transport. P. W. Theriault, Lockheed-California Co. Short-haul transportation, particularly in the Northeast corridor, has been the subject of many studies. Several modes have been used and several others are being demonstrated or will be demonstrated. The emphasis here is on the air transportation mode and, in particular, on the compound helicopter as a moderately high-speed vehicle, which could provide an appreciable benefit to the public and the existing air carriers. 690420. STOL Demonstration Program. A. S. Crossfield, Eastern Airlines, Inc. The Eastern/McDonnell Douglas Demonstration pro- gram has resulted in quantitative authentication that a STOL transportation system can significantly reduce city-to-city block time. The accomplishment of this necessary event requires the construction of supporting facilities, timely action by government and industry, and continuing operational experience. Further development efforts in STOL aircraft and airborne avionics are required, with emphasis placed on total system integration. Refinement of the existing airborne navigation equipment and development of a reliable, all-weather terminal guidance system is necessary to free STOL aircraft from existing terminal area guid- ance/runway availability limitations. Advanced high cruise speed, STOL aircraft capable of operating from sites conforming to FAA STOLport criteria are requisite to implement this system. An expanded scale demonstration program using STOL aircraft and airborne precision avionics employing the experience gained in this demonstration is needed to provide the additional knowledge required to establish the full scale operational procedures, limitations and con- straints. 1969 SA E Transactions 690421. Planning STOL Facilities. Laurence Schaefer, Port of New York Authority. The development of STOL commercial aircraft is assumed to be an aid and a competitor to CTOL aircraft. The development of an IFR navigation system will permit STOL operations independent of and compatible with CTOL operations. The city center STOLport may have to be designed into an environment which creates additional challenge to the airport planner. Criteria have to be applied to sites restricted by surrounding obstructions, developed com- munities, congested ground access systems, and a reluc- tance on the part of the community to accept an aviation facility because of noise, congestion, and safety. STOL aircraft can help amelioriate airport capacity problems facing the nation today while offering the major segment of the short-haul market better service. Care in site selection will certainly be a major factor in the success of the new mode of air travel. 690422. Interface of VTOL, STOL, and CTOL Traffic in Busy Terminal Areas. Robert B. Meyersburg, Federal Aviation Administration. Airport congestion, combined with the rapid and contin- uing growth of corridor air traffic, has spurred the development of potentially viable VTOL and STOL systems. As these systems grow, they will introduce new close-in airports in metropolitan areas, as well as increase the efficiency of existing airports for medium and long-haul transportation. New and more efficient methods of utilizing the terminal airspace must be developed to control the mix of conventional and V/STOL aircraft to minimize traffic delays, and to support in every way the maintenance of a safe, fast, reliable all-weather intercity air transport system. This paper treats methods of interfacing CTOL and V/STOL terminal traffic to achieve these objectives. 690423. Modern Application of Engine Oil Analysis to Airline Operation. George J. Gunn and Robert L. Whittenberg, Maintenance and Engineering Center, American Airlines, Inc. The contribution of engine oil analysis to the safe and economical operation of aircraft is a proved fact to the military. Until recently, however, commercial airlines have only experimented with routine oil analysis. An effective, economical system has now been devised for application to commercial aircraft incorporating elec- tronic data processing equipment and a refined analysis technique. 690424. Lubricant Evaluation and Systems Design for Aircraft Gas Turbine Engines. R. G. Edge and A. T. B. P. Squires, Rolls-Royce, Ltd. Design of the oil system of aircraft gas turbine engines must keep pace with the ever improving performance which results in temperatures within the engine being continually raised. It is necessary to prevent the increased temperatures from causing rapid deterioration of the oil or failures of the bearings. Some of the design features of the Rolls-Royce RB 211 which are relevant to this require- ment are presented, together with methods used to evaluate and predict the performance of lubricants under operational conditions. 1969 SA E Transactions 690425. Evolution of the Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft JT9D Engine Oil System. Harry W. Reynolds, Jr. and Richard E. Moore, Pratt and Whitney Aircraft Div., United Aircraft Corp. Extensive commercial airline experience coupled with state-of-the-art advances in mechanical component tech- nology has resulted in an oil system design for the Pratt &amp; Whitney Aircraft JT9D engine which is optimized for the simplicity, dependability, and maintainability features required by the current trend toward longer time intervals between scheduled overhauls sought by the commercial airlines.</page><page sequence="58">690426-690433 690426. The EMF Stability of Type K Thermocouple Alloys. Teh Po Wang, Arnold J. Gottlieb and C Dean Starr, Wilbur B. Driver Co. Effects of environment on the electromotive force (EMF) stability of a thermocouple are discussed. Stability of EMF of 0.128 and 0.032-in. diameter type K thermocouples at 1800 F in air under laboratory conditions is presented and method of test described. The EMF change of an individual thermoelement with respect to its initial condition is compared with corresponding change in microstructure. Test data for the 0.032-in. diameter wire extend to 1000 hr while those for 0.128-in. diameter wire extend beyond 4000 hr. The stability of EMF for a temperature range of 1800-2200 F in air of a type K thermocouple is compared with Tophel Il-Nial II in both laboratory and industrial conditions. The EMF changes of a 0.128-in. diameter type K and a Tophel Il-Nial II couple of the same size upon exposure to a reducing atmosphere at 1750 F are presented. Approaches to the design of a more stable thermo- couple are discussed. 690427. Beryllium Oxide Insulators in Hyper-Environ- mental Thermocouple Application. Peter L. Fleis- chner, Jay R. Hodshon and Karsten H. Styhr, National Beryllia Corp. The concept that a "high purity" oxide ceramic is a generic term describing a family of materials, which could exhibit various performance characteristics in critical thermocouple applications, is introduced. Individual products require complete characterization of composi- tion and microstructure in order to predict the specific physical, chemical and thermal properties of the selected part. Recent applications of newer high purity fabrication techniques to hyper-environmental temperature sensors are presented, including the chemical vapor deposition of BeO. A brief discussion of the toxicity of BeO indicates tonnage quantities of beryllium compounds have been processed since they were recognized as toxic in the late 1940's, with few, if any, confirmed new cases of the beryllium disease. 690428. Traceability - with Special Reference to Temper- ature Measurement. J. M. Cameron and Harmon Plumb, Institute for Basic Standards, National Bureau of Standards. The requirement that measurements be traceable to national standards arose in response to needs for consis- tency between different parts of the measurement system. There is no single agreed-upon definition for traceability, but it has been taken to mean the existence of some chain of intercomparisons or calibrations fading back to the National Bureau of Standards. Like all procedural or material requirements, its presence or absence may bear little relation to the performance characteristic one is really interested in. The scientific problem of expressing the desired performance requirements in terms of the amount and type of evidence needed to determine the degree of consistency of measurement processes is discussed and illustrated for the measurement of tempera- ture. The importance of the study of measurement as a production process and the need for a program for the surveillance of the measurement process is discussed and plans for a new service for transfer of measurement capability in thermometry are presented. 1969 SA E Transactions 690429. A Discussion on Common Thermocouple Calibra- tion Problems. D. A. Toenshoff, Englehard Industries, Inc., Div., Engelhard Minerals &amp; Chemicals Corp. A discussion of common problems in thermocouple calibration is given. Major areas of concern are pointed out and some corrective or preventive action is indicated. By application of technique, good housekeeping, and concern for fine detail, calibration accuracy of calibration approaching that of the National Bureau of Standard can be obtained. 690431. Experimental Pyrometer for Turbine Blade Tem- perature Measurement. P. W. Mossey, General Electric Co. A pyrometer was built for the measurement of the surface temperature of turbine rotor blades on operating develop- ment engines. Two new concepts were used: a purged, line-of-sight viewing tube, and a method of signal processing to reject the interference of carbon particles in the turbine gases. This report describes the new system and the results obtained in testing on development engines. The data have been analyzed and recommendations are made to improve the measurement accuracy further. The py- rometer has potential for measuring, condition moni- toring, and in-flight engine control. 690432. A Radiation Pyrometer Designed for In-Flight Measurement of Turbine Blade Temperatures. R. Barber, Land Pyrometers Ltd. The principle of operation and design features of a pyrometer that has been developed to measure the surface temperature of high-pressure and low-pressure compressor blades of jet engines during flight are described. The pyrometer can measure temperatures above 700 C (1300 F) to an accuracy of ±5 C (±10 F). 1969 SA E Transactions 690433. Measurement of Jet Engine Combustion Temper- ature by the Use of Thermocouples and Gas Analysis. R. C. Williamson and C. M. Stanforth, General Electric Co. The measurement of jet engine combustion temperature is accomplished principally by the use of either thermo- couples or gas analysis. Although more tedious, gas analysis is required to measure the highest temperature levels such as in afterburners, while thermocouples are 123</page><page sequence="59">690434-690441 124 normally adequate to measure the exit temperatures from main combustors. The measurement techniques are presented and determination of the true temperature is described, along with the errors which are involved in each case. Advantages and limitations of the two methods are discussed, and criteria are presented to aid in the selection of the best method for a particular application. 1969 SA E Transactions 690434. Aircraft Fuel Vent Line Sensitivity to Lightning Effects. M. Markels, Jr. and J. M. Spurlock, Atlantic Research Corp. Div., Susquehanna Corp.; and J. D. Robb and J. R. Stahmann, Lightning and Transients Research Institute. Results of investigation to develop a technological basis for overcoming aircraft lightning-strike hazards associated with turbojet aircraft fuel vents are discussed. Flame propagation and arrester experiments were performed with high-voltage and high-current facilities and repeated in a combustion research facility using a drive tube to simulate impulse effects of natural lightning. Flame propagation through actual aircraft vent systems con- taining flammable fuel-air mixtures was demonstrated, and characteristic flame propagation properties were measured and duplicated in laboratory apparatus. Prelim- inary assessment of problems involved in designing effective flame arresters and explosion suppression sys- tems was made. Lightning-stroke patterns in fuel vent region were analyzed as to inferable hazard significance. 1969 SA E Transactions 690436. Ignition of Aircraft Fluids on High Temperature Engine Surfaces. William T. Westfield, Federal Aviation Administration. Ignitions of aircraft flammable fluids that result from contact with hot surfaces of an engine are influenced by the characteristics of the secondary cooling air and engine surfaces, ventilation rates of the nacelle engine compart- ment, direction and changes of direction of the cooling air, and changes in engine power while leakage is occurring. The temperatures of the engine surfaces are much higher in installations of the new generation high bypass-high compression ratio turbofan engines and magnify the hot surface ignition problem. The effects of these advanced technology engines on hot surface ignition of aircraft fuels and a petroleum-base hydraulic fluid were investigated under simulated flight conditions in a fire test program on a modified current turbofan engine installa- tion. All hot surface ignitions occurred in the form of explosions of varying degrees of severity. 690437. Nitrogen Inerting of Aircraft Fuel Tanks. K. R. Bragg, C. C. Rimmel and P. H. Jones, Systems Div., Parker Hannifin Corp. A solution is suggested to the problem of fuel tank fire protection by means of nitrogen inerting. Background relationships with the successful XB-70 inerting system, which led to the development of the commercial inerting system, are also discussed. Specifically, this paper shows how aircraft inerting system design is influenced by the release of air from the fuel at high altitudes. Data are presented to shov the likelihood of air saturated fuel, the way in which it is released from the fuel at high altitudes, and the effect of this release on the inert atmosphere in the fuel tanks. Problems created by this air release are discussed. Test data are presented on a scrubbing device that predictably provides controlled release and dilution of dissolved air from the fuel, thereby allowing the inert atmosphere to be maintained. Data are presented on the effect of this controlled air release on the fuel boost pump operation. Additionally, the status of the current inerting system flight test program, as installed aboard a military aircraft, is presented. 690438. Spark Ignition - Ignition of Flammable Mixtures as a Consequence of Gaseous Electronic Dis- charge. Elton L. Litchfield, Explosives Research Center, U. S. Bureau of Mines. The concept of minimum energy for spark ignition is summarized and then applied to the question of ignition hazard from triboelectrified fluids. It is shown that if certain auxiliary conditions are satisfied, assurance of safety can be given if, and only if, the electric field strength is maintained below the dielectric breakdown strength of the flammable air-vapor mixture. 690439. Special "Torque Measuring Dynamometer" for Slow Speed Axles. Kermit O. Allard, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works. A special dynamometer has been developed to accurately load and measure torque on slow-speed axle shafts. Quiet operation is attained by using multiple disc wet brakes. Accurate torque measurement and control are obtained by a mechanical-hydraulic servomechanism commanded by a scale beam. 690440. Implications of Safety Legislation on Equipment Design. E. W. Tanquary, International Har- vester Co. Safety legislation and its implication on equipment design in the agricultural and light industrial equipment industry is mounting at both a state and federal agency level. A need for greater recognition of the contributions which all members can make in the area of health and safety through technical societies such as SAE is in order. 690441. Effect of Electric Vehicles on the Power Industry. Edward Hines, Matthew S. Mashikian and Laurance J. Van Tuyl, Detroit Edison Co. Concern has been expressed over the effects on various industries if electric vehicles obtain an appreciable percentage of the automobile market. Given the state of development of such vehicles, the capability of the power industry, and the availability of off-peak power, it is felt</page><page sequence="60">690442-690450 that development of the electric vehicle market will be very gradual with minimum disruption of the automobile industry, the electric power industry, the petroleum industry, or their suppliers. 69044" , An AC Electric Drive System as Applied to a Tracked Vehicle. J. A. Kirtland and D. C. Andrus, FMC Corp.; and W. Slabiak, Pro- pulsion Systems Lab., USATACOM. An a-c electric drive system was installed and operated in a fully tracked, 12-ton military personnel carrier. The system consists of a conventional design 400 Hz brushless alternator, 2 d-c link inverters using high power SCR's, 2 a-c induction motors, and the associated control circuitry. This paper presents the design criteria which must be met for a tracked vehicle and points out those areas which are unique in such a vehicleee. Test results from over 600 miles of test track operation are presented. 690443. Comparative Study of Four Alloys for Automotive Brake Drums. S. K. Rhee, R. M. Rusnak and W. M. Spurgeon, Bendix Corp., Res. Labs. A drag dynamometer was used to evaluate the perfor- mance of automotive brake drums made from four kinds of materials with different thermal conductivities. In the order of decreasing thermal conductivity they are: chromium copper, aluminum/cast iron composite, cast iron, and nickel-aluminum bronze. All of the drums were of the standard configuration used in SAE J661a, or closely approximated it. The drums were run in conjunc- tion with three types of lining materials: nonabrasive, moderately abrasive, and highly abrasive. Temperatures near the lining/ drum interface, coefficients of friction, and lining wear were measured and compared. For a given amount of work done, the temperature near the drum surface was found to be lowest for the chromium copper drums, with progressively higher temperatures in the aluminum/cast iron composite, nickel-aluminum bronze and cast iron drums. Relative lining wear and coefficient of friction varied with the type of lining tested. 1969 SAE Transactions 690444. An Old Material Meets a New Challenge - Integral Cast Iron Hub and Disc Development. Gerald L. Goldberg and Trevor N. James, Budd Co. For economic considerations, the use of cast iron has been merged with the concept of an integral hub and disc for passenger car usage. This paper discusses the various problems involved in the utilization of cast iron and includes details of various tests and their results necessary to prove out this design. Discussed in particular are: foundry variables, hearing press fit, fatigue, physical and thermal properties, brake noise, and stud press fits. 690445. Nondestructive Testing of Brake Lining. G. B. Jacoby, Delco Moraine Div., General Motors Corp. Every piece of brake lining must meet standards which relate production lining to lining tested on the vehicle for approval. To accomplish this purpose limits have been set on cure, strength, hardness, specific gravity, and appear- ance, and these characteristics must be measured on a production basis. New techniques developed to measure these char- acteristics rapidly and nondestructively are: electrical conductivity for cure, loaded rollers for strength, and gamma radiation gauges for specific gravity. These techniques, plus Gogan hardness and visual inspection, have been coupled with systematic recording of measure- ments on experimental lining. 690447. Some Aspects of Metrication in Britain. Ewen McEwen and F. E. Butcher, Joseph Lucas Ltd. An evaluation of the metric system within the United Kingdom is presented. Psychological, administrative, as well as technical aspects of metrication are discussed. At the present time, the British Government supports the metric change, but is relying on industry to execute the program. Implementation and publicity of metrication are discussed in terms of trade and general acceptance. 690448. Canadian Views on Metric Conversion. Rowland Hill, Res. &amp; Dev. Labs., Northern Electric Co. Ltd. There are many indications that Canada is moving slowly toward adoption of the metric system. Some groups and industries are making extensive use of it; other groups are laying plans or making preparations. Some metric stand- ards are being published, while the Government of Canada is studying the implications of a change. As yet, no definite decision has been reached, and no national schedule for change has been established. Many Cana- dians are anxious to get on with the change, but realize that for economic reasons it will have to be coordinated with similar action in the United States. 690449. Noise Produced by the Injection Pump and Its Relation to Total Diesel Engine Noise. Klaus D. Zimmermann, Robert Bosch GmbH Stuttgart. Noise measurements with a truck diesel engine and its in-line injection pump are discussed. The measurements are carried out in anechoic chambers. The most important noise sources of the pump and the diesel engine are shown. Some noise decreasing influences on the injection pump are explored. The flange joint of pump and crankcase builds a bridge for bodily-vibrations in both directions. Thus, the airborne noise emitted from the pumphousing is, on this engine which has been tested, primarily due to bodily vibrations transmitted from the crankcase to the pump. 690450. Relation Between Noise and Basic Structural Vibration of Diesel Engines. T. Priede, E. C. Grover and N. Lalor, University of South- ampton. 125</page><page sequence="61">690451-690457 126 The relation between diesel engine structure design, its characteristics of vibration, and emitted noise are de- scribed. Special techniques developed for the investigation of the origins of noise and modes of vibration are discussed. On in-line engines the effect on noise and vibration of various design alternatives, such as wet and dry-liner, underslung crankshaft and skirted crankcases, intermains and without intermains crankshaft, designs, engine size, and number of cylinders are explored. On engines the origins of noise and the basic modes of vibration are established and the significance of the contribution of noise by covers is shown. A new form of in-line engine structure design has been investigated giving 10 db A overall reduction of noise. 690451. Some Observations of the Effect of Lubricating Oil Properties on Combustion Generated Engine Vibrations. Ernest S. Starkman, University of California, Berkeley.; and Anthony Bonora, Lockheed Missiles and Space Corp. Engine noise of the type related to a bending vibration of the crankshaft was investigated in a V-8 spark ignition engine. Abnormally high rates of combustion pressure rise were induced by introduction of carbon particles into the intake manifold, thereby providing multiple ignition sources in one cylinder. It was determined that wide variations in oil tempera- ture and viscosity had no influence on the occurrence of vibration or the apparent magnitude of the accompanying noise. However, lubricating oil bulk temperature and viscosity did each have some measurable effect on the magnitude of the crankshaft deflection. Upon completion of the investigation, examination of the bearing disclosed damage, caused by the protracted inducement of bending vibration, apparently while opera- ting with oil at very low viscosity. 690452. Automotive Piston-Engine Noise and Its Reduc- tion - A Literature Survey. Walter W. Soroka and Chi-Shing F. Chien, University of Cali- fornia, Berkeley. Sources of externally radiated automotive piston-engine and vehicle noise are reviewed and described in detail. The effects of various design and operational characters on intensity and character of noise, noise measurement, and analysis and identifications procedures are given extensive examination. A summary of current research on the reduction of engine noise is presented. 690453. Design Considerations for Zinc-Air Batteries. Nigel I. Palmer, William R. Alcorn and Daniel L. Mulkerin, Leesona Moos Labs. In a conventional battery, specific energy density is approximately constant, while power density may be varied by design. In a fuel cell, by contrast, power density is essentially constant and energy density can be varied. The zinc-air battery is an intermediate case with an electrode derived from each type. Consequently, the weight of zinc must be maximized with respect to the remainder of the battery, for maximum specific energy density, but must be minimized with respect to plate area, for maximum specific power density. This basic tradeoff implies that a design optimization of the zinc-air battery is required for each application. A design procedure is outlined and demonstrated for the case of an electric passenger vehicle. 690454. Design of an Electronic Automobile Employing Nickel-Cadmium Batteries. Victor Wouk and Harvey N. Seiger, Guitón Industries, Inc. A standard station wagon has been converted to an electronic car employing nickel-cadmium batteries for power, and a SCR chopper for speed control and regenerative braking. With this vehicle we can simulate the acceleration and deceleration performance char- acteristics of a hybrid battery system which will ultimately use high energy density batteries for range, and nickel- cadmium batteries for acceleration and braking. Acceptable acceleration to top speed and acceptable rates of braking down to very low speeds, are achieved. Circuits and some performance characteristics are de- scribed. 690456. Proportioning Valve to Skid Control - A Logical Progression. Frederick E. Lueck, William A. Gartland and Michael J. Denholm, Borg and Beck Div., Borg-Warner Corp. The development of a family of brake-control devices capable of handling all vehicles from passenger cars through air-braked heavy trucks is described. These devices consist of: hydraulic load-sensitive proportioning valves for passenger cars, light trucks, and vans; hydraulic load-sensitive proportioning valves for medium trucks; pneumatic load-sensitive proportioning valves for air- braked heavy trucks and tractor/ trailer combinations; skid control systems for passenger cars; and skid control systems for trucks and tractor/trailer vehicles. The paper explains how this broad approach to brake controls allows the selection of a system which can be tailored to the particular brake control needs of a specific vehicle and its duty cycle. Except for the passenger-car skid control, these devices are capable of being retrofitted on existing vehicles. 690457. Prediction of Surface Temperatures in Passenger Car Disc Brakes. Robert N. Noyes and Paul T. Vickers, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Analytical attempts to determine disc brakes temperature distributions, known to date, have all basically assumed the disc geometry could be approximated by a semi- infinite slab wherin a heat flux varying linearly with time is supplied to the slab at each of its two faces. This mode of attack will predict temperature patterns in the disc with good accuracy when it is assumed that: 1 . The disc is homogeneous. 2. Cooling occurs only at the rubbing surface.</page><page sequence="62">690458-690464 3. The deceleration rate during the braking is constant. 4. No thermal radiation takes place. 5. Conduction to and cooling from the hub is neglec- ted. 6. Disc material thermal properties are invariant with temperature. It is the purpose of this report to show an alternate method of analysis wherein a detailed temperature distribution throughout the actual geometry being investi- gated is determined as a function of time by a finite difference method of solution. None of the restrictions mentioned above need to be imposed and, in addition, all three methods of heat transfer can simultaneously take place in continuous fashion anywhere within or on the surface of the geometry. 1969 SA E Transactions 690458. Location, Accessibility, and Identification of Controls and Displays in 1969 Passenger Auto- mobiles. Donald W. Conover, Wesley E. Wood- son, Peter H. Selby and Gerald E. Miller, Man Factors, Inc. A human engineering survey of the control/display arrangements in 1969 passenger automobiles was conduc- ted under contract to the National Highway Safety Bureau. Survey rationale, methodology, and preliminary findings are presented. Marked variability was noted between various control/display arrangements and certain important driver compartment dimensions. This and other findings suggest need for development of human en- gineering design criteria against which to base future design standards for the driver-vehicle interface. 690459. Human Factors Considerations to the Design, Placement, and Function of Vehicle Controls. Earl D. Sharp, Aerospace Medical Res. Lab., Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. Research in human factors considerations to controls and control design conducted under the aegis of the Air Force is reviewed in this paper. Seven categories are discussed, with appropriate reference material. These general cate- gories include: checklists, guides, and manuals; control design; control coding; control forces; control spacing; gloved operation; and workplace layout. 690461. Special Purpose Urban Cars. James J. Gumble- ton, Daniel L. Frank, Stanley L. Genslak and Albert G. Lucas, General Motors Corp. Three small, lightweight 2-passenger urban cars have been designed to provide short-range personal transportation with some package-carrying capability. Top speed is 30 - 45 mph. Separate roads or restricted driving areas would be required for these cars, since they could not safely mix with full-sized cars and trucks. These small cars would help relieve urban traffic and parking problems. Their low power and energy requirements result in low vehicle emissions. This car series (model 512) utilized one basic body configuration as a test bed for a conventional gasoline engine, a battery-electric, and a hybrid gasoline-electric. The gasoline powertrain consists of a 19.6 cu in. 2-cyl engine coupled to an automatic variable-ratio V-belt transmission. The electric powerplant consists of a d-c series motor, solid-state controls, and a special lightweight 84-v lead-acid battery pack. The hybrid power system consists of an 11.7 cu in. gasoline engine coupled to a d-c series electric motor through an electromagnetic clutch. Electrical propulsion energy is provided by a 72-v lead-acid battery pack. Discussion: M. I. Weinberg; Cornell Aeronautical Lab., Inc.; Author's closure 1969 SA E Transactions 690462. Special Purpose Car For Commuting. E. A. Rishavy, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. A 3-wheeled commuter car (model 511) has been develop- ed to carry two people from home to work at freeway speeds. Many radical design and construction features are employed. The car is small and lightweight, a combination offering high fuel economy, low exhaust mass emissions and some help for the parking problem. The 5 1 1 car, in its present form, is still a test vehicle. Although several major problems are unresolved, the car has demonstrated the technical feasibility of its basic concept. Discussion: A. S.

French, Ricardo and Co., Ltd. Local heat fluxes have been measured over a wide range of loads and speeds on diesel engines of automotive and larger sizes, both two and four cycle, and with direct and indirect injection combustion systems. Empirical rela- tionships are presented which enable the distribution and the amplitude of the heat flux to be predicted for a target rating. Rigs for investigating the heat transfer conditions at coolant interface are described and typical values of heat transfer coefficient are given. Design techniques are described that have been evolved to permit satisfactory engine operation under highly rated conditions. 1969 SA E Transactions 690464. Experimental Instantaneous Heat Fluxes in a Diesel Engine and Their Correlation. T. Le- Feuvre, Thermo Electron Corp.; and P. S. Myers and O. A. Uyehara, University of Wisconsin. By the use of surface thermocouples to measure instanta- neous temperatures, the instantaneous heat fluxes are calculated at several positions on the cylinder head and sleeve of a direct injection diesel engine for both motored and fired operation. Existing correlations are shown to be unable to predict these data. 127</page><page sequence="63">690465-690471 128 An analysis of convective heat transfer in the engine leads to a boundary layer model which adequately correlates the data for motored operation.

Similarity Laws for Four-Stroke Engines and Numerical Results for the Intake Process Calcu- lated with the Method of Characteristics. Walter R. Brandstetter, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp. The theoretical investigation of the charging process results in 10 dimensionless parameters which specify the behavior of the unsteady process. The calculation of the volumetric efficiency and the oscillation phenomena in the intake system are therefore valid for all engine sizes. The influence of each parameter and the dependence on engine speed, intake pipe length, stroke-bore ratio, and the ratio of the intake pipe diameter to cylinder bore diameter are shown and discussed. 690467. Children's Automobile Safety Restraints: Char- acteristics and Body Measurements. Barry Grif- fith King, Elmer C. Paul and Carl R. Spitznagel, Dept. of Health, Education and Welfare. Percentile distributions of children's body measurements are presented for use in design and sizing of automobile restraint devices and as a basis for guiding parents in the selection of makes and models suitable for the child. The influence of these measurements on the stability, protec- tion, and surrounding clearance dimension requirements for seating systems for children weighing less than 50 lb and those more than 50 lb are discussed. 690468. New Concept of Stratified Charge Two Stroke Engine Yui and Ohnishi Combustion Process (YOCP). Saburo Yui, Ebara Mfg. Co., Ltd.; and Shigeru Ohnishi, Hokurikudenwakoji Co. A unique process for stratified charge in a 2-stroke gasoline engine provides outstanding improvement in performance and makes possible the control of known pollutants in exhaust emission without supplementary devices. The proposed process is intended to achieve virtual control of CO, unburned hydrocarbons, and NOx whhile maintaining satisfactory fuel consumption without erratic or irregular operation. Thus, a large part of the disadvantages of the 2 stroke engine will be overcome. No critical relationship exists among fuel components and response is good. Coupled with these features are adequately large power values and no smoke limit to pose opacity problems. 690469. Unsteady Flow Analysis of Exhaust Systems for Multicylinder Automobile Engines. G. P. Blair, Queen's University of Belfast, Ireland.; and J. R. Goulburn, Constantine College of Technology, Gt. Britain. Wave effects in exhaust systems can strongly influence the performance of an engine. Predictions of pressure-time variations at the exhaust valve by graphical methods, based on experience and the assumption that exhaust pulses will act as sound waves, have been of no design value with multicylinder engines. Now a numerical method, developed from the graphical, has been program- med for a computer, making possible rapid calculation on nonsteady flow properties of an exhaust system. When augmented by experimental testing of three disparate exhaust systems, such calculation proved useful in the design of exhaust systems for multicylinder automobile engines. This paper describes the engine investigations of the three systems involved and the derived design conclusions. Discussion: G. F. Leydorf, Jr.; American Motors 1969 SA E Transactions 690470. Heat Dissipating Capacity of Automotive I. C. Engine Lubricating Oil System. Hiroshi Hayashi, Research Div., Hino Motors, Ltd. A method to evaluate the heat dissipating capacity of the lubricating oil system of the automotive internal combus- tion engine has been developed. By introducing new parameters that control the heat dissipation of the lubricating oil system, it becomes possible to evaluate the heat dissipating capacity of the lubricating oil system by the test. In this paper, the method and some results obtained by applying it to an engine are described. 690471. Fatigue Properties of Gray Cast Iron. L. E. Tucker and D. R. Olberts, Deere &amp; Co. The fatigue properties of gray cast iron are presented. Included in these properties are monotonie tension and compression data and cyclic strain control fatigue data. Estimations of fatigue properties determined from the measured fatigue data are compared to predicted fatigue properties based on static properties. Samples with average hardnesses of 171 and 213 Bhn iron were tested and the results compared. The results of this investigation revealed that the strain amplitude cycles-to-failure plot of gray cast iron was independent of hardness of the iron. 1969 SA E Transactions</page><page sequence="64">690472-690479 690472. Residual Stress in the Induction Hardened Sur- face of Steel. Kentaro Ishii and Mitugi Iwamoto, Japan National Railway.; and Toshio Shiraiwa and Yoshiyasu Sakamoto, Sumitomo Metal Industries, Ltd. The residual stresses produced by static and progressive induction hardening processes were investigated using different diameter bars and different heating conditions. The x-ray diffraction method of stress measurement was used. Compressive stresses were observed at and slightly below the surface in the hardened zone, while lower compressive stresses or tensile stresses were seen at the ends of this zone. These stresses depended on the shapes and sizes of the heated zone and the cooling patterns. Shot peening was seen to convert the tensile stress to a compressive value. 1969 SA E Transactions 690474. Electronic Analyzer for Diesel Engines. R. Ger- mann, AVL &amp; Institute Prof. List, Austria.; M. Schwertfuehrer, Mobil Oil Austria A. G., Vien- na.; C. R. Forsman, Mobil Res. and Dev. Corp.; and W. R. Schwindeman, International Div., Mobil Oil Corp. An analyzer for diesel engines has been developed which enables rapid diagnosis of the injection system. This electronic device uses calibrated quartz pressure trans- ducers to measure the instantaneous pressure in each innjection line. The pressure signal from the first cylinder is used to produce synchronization with crankshaft rotation. The trace for each injection line is then displayed on a conventional cathode ray engine analyzer. The instrument also contains circuitry which gives precise measurement of nozzle statis opening pressure, and timing and timing advance at various speeds. 690475. Electronic Recording Blowby Meter. Bob Mayer- nick and William R. Clark, Perfect Circle Div., Dana Corp. An electronic, automatic, recording blowby meter for internal-combustion engines has been developed. The new meter can measure both dynamic and static blowby conditions. It also displays on graph paper a permanent record of engine blowby. The meter also is capable of finding malfunctions of its own and other operational systems. It is designed basically for dynamometer laboratory use but also has some degree of portability. 690476. Application and Development of the Tramasaf Headform. H. G. Holcombe, Inland Manufac- turing Div., GMC.; and J. K. Foster, GM Proving Grounds. The Tramasaf headform is being developed for use as a laboratory instrument to test the energy absorption capability of automotive components, and concurrently measure the extent of trauma to the human forehead. The Tramasaf headform is a three-part assembly consisting of: (l)a rigid, frangible headform; (2)a soft subcutaneous simulating layer; and (3)a skin simulating cover. The frangible headform now used is an injection molded acrylic plastic shaped in the form of a hemis- pherical shell. The subcutaneous simulating layer is 1/4 inch layer of a natural rubber compound. The skin simulating cover is a 0.030 inch layer of rubber. The most recently published biomechanics data have required a revision of the original development goals for the device. The paper describes these new goals, the stage of the progress, and some applications which verify the utility of the device. 690477. Human Head and Knee Tolerance to Localized Impacts. John W. Melvin and Peter M. Fuller, Highway Safety Research Institute, Univ. of Michigan.; and Roger P. Daniel and George M. Pavliscak, Engineering Staff, Ford Motor Co. The results of recent dynamic load measurements on human skull and patella bone, conducted with less- than-one-square-inch penetrators, are discussed in rela- tion to previously reported skull impact data from larger contact areas. These medical data are compared to the dynamic response of a large variety of natural and synthetic plastic materials, for use in trauma-indicating headform and kneeform design. Several bodyform designs are proposed as research tools. 1969 SA E Transactions 690478. Development of High-Temperature Coatings and Applications. John V. Long, Solar Div., Inter- national Harvester Co. As the demands for materials with improved high- temperature properties continue, more research is being directed toward combining materials into composites to provide properties not available in a single material. An excellent example is a coated metal where the corrosion and oxidation resistance or other properties of an alloy are improved or modified by a thin layer of ceramic, cermet or other metal bonded to the surface. Early developments during World War II and con- tinuing research have produced a number of high- temperature coatings which provide a designer with a unique method for extending a specific materials capa- bility. This paper is a brief review of some ceramic, cermet, and metallic coatings which indicates the scope of the coating development and application. 690479. Oxidation and Sulfidatlon Resistant Coatings for Superalloys. R. B. Puyear, Union Carbide Corp. Modern turbine engines require superalloy components, which have a combination of strength at high temperature and resistance to oxidation and sulfidation attack not obtainable with conventional alloys. These requirements 129</page><page sequence="65">690480-690487 130 are met by a composite of strong superalloy bodies protected with metallic diffusion coatings, formed by alloying the surface with aluminum and other elements. Novel processing methods are frequently required to meet the needs of today's increasingly sophisticated applications. By working together, engine producers and coating vendors have been able to develop procedures to meet these needs. 690480. Advanced Coatings on Superalloy Blades and Vanes for Hot Corrosion and Oxidation Resis- tance. D. K. Hanik, Q. O. Shockley and J. O. Hodshire, Allison Div., General Motors Corp. The need for surface protection of nickel-base alloys to prevent hot corrosion and/or sulfidation is discussed. Results of controlled engine test cycling and the rig testing of turbine blades are discussed to establish laboratory test correlation. The relative corrosion resistance of a number of commercial alloys is shown, and the response of these alloys to corrosion resistance with protective coating is covered in relation to their limitation in erosion/ ox- idation deterioration. Finally, some technology results and general methodology applied to electrophoretic processing for applying coatings of aluminum and combinations with chromium are described. The processing advantages and disadvantages of this coating process and general results are compared with present production. 690481. Surface Coatings Available to Industry Today. C. R. Most, Materials Systems Div., Union Carbide Corp. Surface coatings, used principally for their wear qualities, can be divided into three broad categories: chemical platings, hard facings, and flame spraying. Processes are briefly described; examples are given of the uses of the surface coatings produced; and comparisons are made. Particular attention is given to the various flame spray processes and coatings. The importance of particle velocity to the qualities of flame spray coatings is demonstrated. Examples are given of some recent advan- ces in the technology of flame spray surface coatings, and related data are presented. Porosity of coatings and porosity measurement techniques; efficacy of epoxy sealing of coatings for enhanced corrosion protection; very high purity plasma-applied compositions; and the use of plasma coating techniques to fabricate parts are discussed. 690483. Flame Spray Coatings for Wear. Walter J. Gagnet, Jr., METCO Inc. Initially, wire flame spraying was only capable of spraying low melting point materials such as zinc and aluminum. These coatings were used basically to achieve anodic corrosion protection. New flame spraying techniques such as the combustion powder process enabled industry to spray ceramics, self-fluxing alloys, and cermet mixtures. Use of fused coatings of self-fluxing alloys offered materials with greater resistance to wear, erosion, and abrasion. A further refinement in spraying techniques was plasma spraying with nontransferred arc equipment which allowed materials with extremely high melting points, such as tungsten, to be sprayed. With these newest develop- ments, flame spraying offers a wide spectrum of material selection to solve most of the wear problems in industry economically and efficiently. 1969 SA E Transactions 690484. Development of a Safer, Nonlacerating Auto- mobile Windshield. John R. Blizard and John S. Howitt, Corning Glass Works. A new, nonlacerating automobile windshield has been developed. It uses thin chemically strengthened glass. Concussion forces are limited to a safe level equal to or below that found in today's conventional windshields. This paper describes the windshield, tells why it works, and describes the development test program. 690485. Safety Performance of a Chemically Strengthen- ed Windshield. L. M. Patrick, K. R. Trosien and F. T. DuPont, Wayne State University. Safety performance of an experimental windshield with a thin, chemically tempered inner pane is compared with the standard windshield and other experimental wind- shields. The chemically tempered windshield has a penetration velocity of 35 mph, compared with 26 mph penetration velocity for the standard windshield, and it has lower peak head accelerations than other types used in the experiments. The windshield tested produces a bulge on impact, which decelerates the head over a long distance with low accelerations. The bulge or pocket is lined with particles that are less lacerative than the standard annealed glass. 690486. Bills of Material Data Structures For Use in Computerized Inventory Planning. Frank H. Veith, Jr., General Electric Co. Advanced techniques to structure bills of material file on random access devices so that they may be used effec- tively by a computer are demonstrated.

On the Vehicle Dynamic Response to the Steer- ing Control - Experimental Evaluation of the Response and Analytical Approach to the Design of the Performance with Seven Degrees Model. T. Kohno, S. Tsuchiya and N. Komoda, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. Experimental and analytical approaches are described that were developed to design and tune up not only steady-state but also dynamic characteristics of the vehicle maneuvering performance. Outlines of the testing methods and relationship between the measured typical characteristics and the drivers' feeling are presented. They were investigated and developed in order to qualify the general characteristics of production vehicle dynamics, effectively and accurately, and to apply the results to the vehicle design. As regards analytical approaches, the 7-deg theoretical model is introduced. It is established to analyze the influences on vehicle performance by changes in design parameters, including the lateral rigidity of tires, the torsional rigidity of the steering system, and some nonlinear damping in steering and suspension systems. The results of studies about the relationship between design parameters and vehicle characteristics - particularly dynamic character- istics - are then described. Some of the new points of view about dynamic vehicle performances are indicated and experimental data are used for substantiation. As the results of these researches, selecting procedures of vehicle parameters for designing and tuning vehicle performance are presented in the field of stability and controllability. 690489. Suspension and Steering of the VW 411 Model Year 1969. Albert Grotewohl, Volkswagen werk AG. After a short introductory consideration of wheel suspen- sion layouts, the influence of the suspension on major vehicle characteristics in the steady-state condition is investigated and the theoretical results compared at various points with measurements made on the VW 411. In the second part of the paper, the front and rear suspension and the safety steering system of the VW 411 are described in detail. 690490. "ACCU-DRIVE" Stability With Comfort the 1969 Buick Chassis. R. E. Owen and M. R. Ladd, Buick Motor Div., General Motors Corp. The 1969 Buick has a new type of front suspension. It utilizes a unique camber geometry for improved ride and handling on the many miles of expressway systems in use today, as well as the aging blacktop roads throughout our country. This system was developed because it is evident that the traditional camber geometry is no longer required for maneuvering today's power steering equipped cars. Goals set in the development of the new suspension were: First, to provide the easiest driving, best handling, and most stable automobile for today's modern roads, and second, to increase passenger comfort. The geometry of the new suspension system does this by providing automatic compensation that minimizes deviations caused by external forces, such as: 1. Uneven or rolling road surfaces. 2. Longitudinal grooves or ridges in the road surface. 3. Wind gusts. This new camber geometry also reduces steering wheel vibrations. 690491. Diesel Smoke - A Comparieon of Test Methods and Smokemeters on Engine Test Bed and Vehicle. F. Pinolini, Fiat, S.p.A.; and J. Spiers, Perkins Engines Ltd. An interim assessment of the characteristics of five smokemeters generally available in Europe, which are csrrently under investigation on a cooperative basis in seven countries, is given. This coordinated test program- me, begun in 1967 by a Smoke Measurement Subcom- mittee of the Coordinating European Council (for devel- opment of performance tests for fuels and lubricants) has also investigated alternative test methods, ranging from the constant full load, steady speed test to the so called "free-acceleration" method, on 60 different types of vehicle, representative of those in current use in Western Europe. The results of these tests are summarized, and it is concluded that the basic test for prototype approval for smoke emission level is that carried out as a series of full-load speeds, either with the engine on the test bed or with the vehicle on a chassis dynamometer. 690492. Steady-State Correlation of Diesel Smoke Me- ters - An SAE Task Force Report. A. W. Carey, Jr., Cummins Engine Co., Inc. An experimental investigation, conducted by an SAE task force to establish correlations between diesel smokemeters is described. Correlations between sampling meters (Bosch spotmeter, BP-Hartridge), opacity meters (USPHS, Beckman 912), and exhaust soot content are presented. 690493. CRC Correlation of Diesel Smokemeter Meas- urements. F. J. Hills, Mobil Res. and Dev. Corp.; and T. O. Wagner and D. K. Lawrence, American Oil Co. Diesel smoke measurements were made over a broad range of smoke intensities with seven different com- mercially available smokemeters using a 4-strokecycle engine and a 2-stroke cycle engine operated under steady-state conditions on two fuels of different smoking tendencies. Exhaust soot concentrations were also meas- ured by two filtering methods, and smoke was rated visually by two trained raters. Correlations among the smokemeter readings did not differ with either fuel or engine. A nomograph correlating smokemeter readings was prepared, and agreement with published data appears generally good except for high readings from one continuous filtering smokemeter to high sampling pres- 131</page><page sequence="67">690494-690500 132 sure, and unexplained low readings from a light-dispersion meter. The CRC Smokemeter Group believes these correlations, with the exceptions mentioned, give a firm basis for comparing measurements made with different smokemeters. 690494. Analysis of Failures. Charles Lipson, University of Michigan. Failures of machine components are described, systema- tized, and analyzed in this paper. An attempt is made to trace the causes of each failure, describe the mechanism, list the influencing factors, and suggest the remedies. A meaningful analysis of a failed part is one of the most useful sources of information available to the engineer. From the study of failure he can frequently learn whether the failure was caused by a defective design, inadequate material properties, poor production practice, or service abuse, and can thereby devise necessary improvements to eliminate failure. 1969 SA E Transactions 690495. Systems Approach to Product Failure Prevention. J. M. Leinonen, Ford Motor Co. Product failures in the customer's hands can be minimized through the use of a disciplined approach to vehicle proveout. In this paper, the Ford Truck Systems Engineer- ing approach to product failure prevention is presented including definition of objectives, program reviews, testing, manufacturing and processing considerations, control of critical supplied components, and periodic status assessment. In addition, the techniques used to resolve critical component failure problems during a new vehicle experimental development program are discussed. 690496. Rapid Product Problem Solving in the Auto- motive Industry. Robert L. Hauser, GMC Truck &amp; Coach Div., General Motors Corp. Product problems can be divided into two general categories: "vital few" and "trivial many." This paper suggests ways to identify the two types of problems and different approaches to solving each type. Recommendations are made for obtaining complete, accurate, and timely problem definition from the field. A system for identifying cause and responsibility for solution, and improving the efficiency of arriving at a satisfactory solution is recommended for "vital few" problems. A task force approach for solving "trivial many" problems is recommended. Specific field problems are used throughout the paper to illustrate the suggestions and recommendations. 690497. Technique in System Identification for Dynamic Mechanical Systems. C. A. Julien and H. M. Hung, United States Army Weapons Command. The "identification of systems" is a generalized form of curve fitting pertaining to systems for which a mathemat- ical model is known, and for which input/output data are empirically available, but for which actual values of parameters in the model are unknown and are sought. A technique for identification (that is, determination of parameters) in second-order, dynamic systems is presented and applied to a typical system; namely, a 2-axle rubber-tired vehicle. The scheme is based on establishing a set of system model equations and their use with system response data to define one or more residue functions in a manner analogous to the defining of an error function in curve-fitting by the collocation method. A performance index is defined by treating the residue as a measure of least squares fit, and the parameters are then determined by finding the set of values which simultaneously makes all the first partial derivatives of this index with respect to the parameters vanish. The technique is applied to the determination of nine system parameters in a nonlinear, 2-degree-of-freedom model of a vehicle/ tire suspension system. It is found to yield the correct values to within 5%. 690498. Two Applications of an On-Line Data Acquisition and Reduction System. Gene Altekruse, Inter- national Harvester Co. Manual and on-line computer systems for evaluating the performance of exhaust emission control systems for motor vehicles are discussed and compared. Also covered in detail are two applications for an on-line acquisition and reduction system with step-by-step procedures to aid those interested in reducing the delays normally ex- perienced with manual reduction. 690499. Computer-Aided Simulation of Engineering Sys- tems. Wayne C. Hamann, Ford Motor Co. The various computer techniques for simulation of dynamic mechanical systems are described. An example problem is solved, using the analog computer, a special- purpose digital program, an analog-to-digital simulation language (MMIC), and a problem oriented language (DYANA). The various methods are compared for time expended and efficiency in obtaining a solution. A number of typical automotive simulation problems are briefly described. The current and potential impact of time sharing and computer graphics systems on engineer- ing simulation is discussed. 690500. The Cadillac Development of an Integral Ductile Iron Steering Knuckle. R. J. Templin, J. T. Hoban and C. J. Cislo, Cadillac Motor Car Div., General Motors Corp. A new concept of a ductile iron integral steering arm, brake caliper support, and steering knuckle has been developed. This has inherently higher reliability, fewer fasteners, and fewer human variables than the assembly it replaces. This new integral knuckle has been tested alongside its multipiece-forged counterpart, with the following results:</page><page sequence="68">690501-690505 1.The endurance life of the ductile iron knuckle in every test is significantly superior to the parts it replaces. 2. Comprehensive car tests have not produced a single failure - or even revealed a significant problem area in the ductile iron steering knuckle. 690501. Design of Integral Ductile Iron Steering Knuckles for Disc Brake Vehicles. M. W. Devers and W. B. Larson, Central Foundry Div., General Motors Corp. With the advent of disc brakes as standard equipment on some vehicles, an integral ductile iron steering knuckle has been developed to replace the assembly of a separate forged knuckle, steering arm, and disc brake housing bracket. The flexibility of the casting process has been applied to take advantage of the properties of ductile iron and to permit combination of components. The simplicity of the integral knuckle concept, which eliminates assem- bly operations and fasteners, makes the design inherently more reliable. A series of nondestructive tests has been devised to assure casting quality. The paper describes the general approach to designing castings in ductile iron for this application, considering both functional and manufacturing requirements. 690502. Evaporator Emission Measurements with the Shed - A Second Progress Report. Stuart W. Martens, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. In January 1968, success in development of a new evaporative measurement technique by General Motors was reported. This technique originally proposed by the U. S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, houses the test vehicle in a sealed, fixed volume container so that hydrocarbon evaporative emissions from it can be determined on a weight basis by simply measuring the hydrocarbon concentration of the contained gases. Since the initial report, requirements to limit vehicular evap- orative emissions have become law and massive programs in the automotive industry to develop evaporative control systems have resulted. In spite of the fact that existing standards are based on trapping measurement techniques, the SHED (Sealed Housing for Evaporative Determina- tions) technique has been used routinely and found extremely valuable by GM divisions in their hardware development work. While it was the intent of the initial report to examine every possible question about the measurement technique, information on most of the questions was limited because of the broad scope covered. This paper will examine in more detail those areas which are currently considered to be of particular interest, that is, control of SHED interior air temperature during a hot soak, vehicle non-fuel "background" emissions, and SHED leakage. All vehicle evaporative emission test results are based, in all important details on specifications of the current federal test. 1969 SA E Transactions 690503. Performance of a Catalytic Converter on Non- leaded Fuel. Harold W. Schwochert, Engineering Staff, General Motors Corp. Catalytic converters have been combined with other emission control methods to arrive at very low emission levels. Two cars with catalytic converters successfully completed 50,000 miles on an AMA driving schedule. However, the catalyst required a nonleaded fuel for acceptable life and contained a noble metal which makes it unsuitable for large volume usage. The search for a physically durable, chemically active, and economical catalyst, which will operate with leaded fuel, continues. In addition, durability of the catalytic converter system under the wide variety of operating conditions in customer service must be established. 690504. Effects of Air-Fuel Ratio on Composition of Hydrocarbon Exhaust from Isooctane, Diisobu- tylene, Toluene, and Toluene-n-Heptane Mix- ture. J. S. Ninomiya and A. Golovoy, Applied Research Lab., Ford Motor Co. Changes in the chemical composition of the exhaust at various equivalence ratios (air-fuel weight ratios) when pure isooctane, diisobutylene, toluene, and toluene- n-heptane mixture are used as fuels in a single-cylinder engine, operating at constant conditions, are described. Isooctane and diisobutylene combustion produced large concentrations of olefins in the exhaust, while toluene produced small amounts of ethylene as its only olefinic product. The olefins, in general, showed a strong temperature dependence and exhibited maximum emis- sions near the stoichiometric equivalence ratio. Combustion of the mixture of 25% (vol) n-heptane in toluene reveals interesting information, compared to emissions from pure toluene: concentrations of ethyl- benzene, styrene, and dimethylacetylene surprisingly are increased by factors of 1.9, 1.9, and 2.1, respectively, probably because reactive radicals derived from h-heptane interact with toluene to form unsaturated molecules. 1969 SA E Transactions 690505. Auto Smog Inspection at Idle Only. Marian F. Chew, Auto Exhaust Emissions. Auto exhaust emission surveys and surveillance programs have shown 10/1 ranges in amounts of hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emitted by individual cars. Low levels of hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions can be maintained from properly tuned engines. The most practical method to reduce auto pollution would be to identify the high emitters and require proper maintenance. The purpose of this investigation was to examine existing data from auto exhaust emission surveys and surveillance programs in order to recommend a practical and efficient testing procedure for auto smog inspection. A new mathematical approach is used to discover which modes of the 7-mode standard test are most discrimina- ting for the high emitters of carbon monoxide and 133</page><page sequence="69">690506-690512 134 hydrocarbons. The idle mode is shown to be the best mode for identifying the high emitters. A 40-sec idle test is developed and applied to tune-up data. At reasonable emission level cut points, net hydro- carbon reductions over the total car population of 19% from uncontrolled cars and 13% from emission controlled cars are calculated. After maintenance the high hydro- carbon or carbon monoxide emitting uncontrolled cars showed an average hydrocarbon reduction of 49%. The emission controlled cars showed an average hydrocarbon reduction of 21%. 1969 SA E Transactions 690506. Mathematical Models for Prediction of Fuel Tank and Carburetor Evaporation Losses. W. J. Koehl, Jr., Research Dept., Mobil Res. and Dev. Corp. A comprehensive method for predicting the mass and composition of evaporative losses from fuel tanks and carburetors and a computer program embodying the method are presented. This method was developed as one phase of the work on automotive evaporative emissions in the Inter-Industry Emission Control program. It is presented as a tool to assist in the design and evaluation of fuels and vehicle evaporation control systems; it is not intended as a substitute for compliance testing. The prediction method makes use of published equations for carburetor loss, tank loss, and loss composition. Calcula- ted losses are compared with measured losses from several published studies. The accuracy and the limitations of the method are described, and some relationships between losses and fuel and fuel system parameters are shown. 690507. Determination of Passenger Car Tire Perfor- mance Levels - Treadwear. K. L. Campbell, Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. Treadwear is the most important aspect of tire perfor- mance to the consumer. Despite this, little is known about the fundamental mechanism of wear and no suitable laboratory methods are available for evaluation. Testing of treadwear must be done on the road and, as a result, is subject to a wide variety of ambient, vehicle, road, traffic, and driver differences. Typical mileages obtained in various parts of the country are reported here and current techniques used by tire companies to measure treadware are summarized. Various possibilities of improving wear and the effect these would have on other properties are also discussed. 690508. Determination of Passenger Tire Performance Levels - High Speed. R. H. Spelman, General Tire and Rubber Co. It is necessary to establish separate test procedures that evaluate the many different performance parameters required of pneumatic tires. The ability to operate at high speeds is one of the more important requirements. This paper describes the physical properties needed for various high-speed performance potentials. It also shows that, with a relationship established between laboratory and road, laboratory testing permits more accurate evaluation. 690509. Determination of Passenger Tire Performance Levels Tire Strength and Endurance. F. S. Vukan and T. P. Kuebler, B. F. Goodrich Co. Tire strength and endurance are two basic tire qualities on which values have been set in various standards as a measure of their performance in actual service. This paper describes the pitfalls in the present methods of measure- ment and presents data to show the limitations of present equipment and methods. 690510. Determination of Passenger Tire Performance Levels - Traction. J. F. Hutchinson and H. D. Becker, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co. A great amount of engineering and development work is under way at the present time on the important subject of tire traction, especially under wet surface conditions. Typical facilities used in the industry for traction testing of tires are described. Tests to date have shown that by far the most important variables affecting tire traction are: 1. Speed. 2. Road surface. 3. Weather conditions as they affect the road surface (wet, dry, icy). 4. Conditions of the tire, particularly whether it is new or worn to the tread wear indicators. By comparing test tires with production tires with known traction qualities, tire manufacturers produce tires which perform satisfactorily for wet traction. However, owing to the many variables which affect tire traction, and owing to wide deviations in the test data, the conclusion is reached that the state-of-the-art today for measuring traction does not warrant the recognition of a tire traction performance level which can be defined in specific terms. 690511. Problems of Obtaining Multiple Optima in Passenger Car Tire Performance. W. J. Dobie, Uniroyal, Inc. Some of the interactions that occur among tread wear, high-speed performance, strength, endurance, traction, are discussed, as well as how attempts by the tire designed to optimize performance in any one of these performance factors can affect others. This does not, however, mean that improved performance cannot be obtained without degrading the tire in other respects if some type of technological break-through is accomplished. 690512. Automotive Tube and Fin Air Conditioning Condenser. William Melnyk, Heat Transfer Div., McCord Corp.

One type of automotive tube and fin condenser being built today is discussed. The process from raw material to shipping with performance</page><page sequence="70">690513-690519 data showing the effects of capacity when using different tubing material is discussed. A brief description of the different fin arrangements currently in automotive use, with some basic information is also presented. 690513. Influence of Evaporator Surface Area Ratios on Condensate Freezing. J. C. Dudley, Modine Mfg. Co. The basic thermodynamic relationships involved in air conditioning evaporator performance and how they are related to the geometric configuration are discussed. The degree of freeze protection that may be achieved through careful design is also covered. Results of calculations and a road test are included to aid in visualizing the effects of varying the amount of internal surface in an evaporator on system performance. 690514. New Gasoline Formulations Provide Protection Against Corrosive Engine Wear. J. R. Hudnall, C. B. Hood and P. L. Gerard, Mobil Res. and Dev. Corp.; I. D. M. Burns, Mobil Oil Co., Ltd.; and A. Fiedler, Mobil Oil A. G. Deutschland. Results of recent studies show that significant supplemen- tal protection against corrosive engine wear can be achieved by selected gasoline formulations. Several approaches are shon to be possible. Antiknock scavenger formulation and control of gasoline sulfur content are potential methods. However, a practical and much more flexible method is shown to be the use of gasoline antiwear additives. Confirmation of additive antiwear performance in laboratory engines and chassis dyna- mometer tests is shown in the results of thousands of miles of field tests with taxicabs operated in congested city traffic, where significant reductions in rates of increase in oil consumption were observed. In addition, the value of selected additives to the motorist is established by results obtained in fleet tests conducted in consumer car service. 690515. A Technique to Characterize Quantitatively the Air/Fuel Mixture in the Inlet Manifold of a Gasoline Engine. Michael H. Collins, Shell Research Ltd. A new technique for quantitative characterization of the air-fuel mixture entering individual cylinders of a multicy- linder engine is discussed. The method described provides estimates of the weights of both air and fuel entering individual cylinders and the proportions of the fuel that are present as liquid at points just upstream of the inlet valves. The technique has been developed for steady- speed conditions and is not applicable to transient operating conditions. Discussion: David A. Trayser; Battelle Memorial Institute; I. N.

Multifunctional gasoline additives in use today fall in two general categories: the conventional type and the newer detergent-dispersant additives. The value of the detergent- dispersant lies in its ability not only to keep the carburetor clean but also to minimize the buildup of hard refractory deposits on automotive intake valves and to supplement the cleaning power of the engine oil. Engine tests confirm the effect of the detergent- dispersant. Cleanliness is enhanced in standard tests designed to measure lubricant performance under low and medium temperature engine operation. Intake valve deposits are modified in laboratory and field tests. Bench scale tests show that, when the detergent- dispersant is properly formulated, treated fuels may be satisfactorily handled by refiners in storage and distribu- tion systems. 690517. Cylinder Pressure Behavior with Runaway Sur- face Ignition. C. H. Phoebe and J. F. Wagner, Gulf Res. and Dev. Co. Cylinder pressure with extremely advanced ignition was studied to gain a better understanding of runaway surface ignition. How early ignition affects ignition lag and the effective burning time is shown on reproductions of the cylinder pressure versus time records and on replots of these data. An analysis of the polytropic process shows the change in cyclic work and heat rejection of typical cycles with progressively advancing ignition timing. The study has contributed a technique, using the cylinder pressure level at the time of normal spark ignition, to measure runaway surface ignition, and a new approach to study the events that can lead to engine damage from this uncontrolled ignition by consideration of cyclic work. 690518. Preknock Kinetics of Ethane in a Spark Ignition Engine. David R. Trumpy, Shell Research Labs.; and O. A. Uyehara and P. S. Myers, University of Wisconsin. A model describing the chemical reactions occurring in the fuel-air mixture prior to the arrival of flame in an engine was constructed and the energy equation, including the rates of reaction as predicted by this model, was integrated over the fuel-air mixture history. The kinetic model predicted sudden oxidation of the fuel in times of the order of magnitude of knock experimentally observed using ethane in a CFR engine. Discussion: G. A.

Labs., General Motors Co.; and Phillip S. Myers and Otto A. Uyehara, University of Wisconsin. Monochromatic ultraviolet absorbance, temperature, and pressure histories of unburned gas in a single-cylinder 135</page><page sequence="71">690520-690526 136 CFR engine under motored, fired, and autoignition conditions were recorded on a multichannel magnetic tape recorder. Isooctane, cyclohexane, ethane, n-hexane, n- heptane, 75 octane number, 50 ON,, and 25 ON blends of primary reference fuels were studied. Under knocking or autoignition conditions a critical absorbance at 2600 A was found, whose magnitude was independent of engine operating variables and dependent only on the knock resistance of the fuel. This absorbance increased rapidly when a certain temperature level was exceeded during the exothermic preflame reactions. 690520. Quieting Noise Mathematically - Its Application to Snow Tires. John H. Varterasian, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Annoying whines or discrete tonal noises often result from the normal operation of rotating equipment due to the even spacing of the basic load carrying elements. This applies to gear teeth, impeller blades, machine tool cutting blades, and snow tire treads, for instance. Whenever it is possible to unevenly space the elements, the whines can be effectively reduced. This paper uses snow tire tread noise to demonstrate a mathematical way for computing an uneven spacing so that the excitation or noise source is in the preferred form for whine reduction - white noise. White noise is analogous to white light which is comprised of many colors, each color having a different frequency. Thus, a mechanical design is computed using a criterion described in the frequency domain. The method uses the mathematics associated with classical "frequency modula- tion" theory and, therefore, is called "mechanical frequen- cy modulation." 690521. Load Transducer for Tire Cord. Samuel K. Clark and Richard N. Dodge, University of Michigan. The measurement of cord loads in pneumatic tires using a direct load transducer is described. Such an instrument is described in detail together with results of numerous tests. Tire engineers will find this paper of value since it outlines methods for determining cord loads under actual tire operating conditions. 690522. Cord Load Characteristics in Bias and Belted- Bias Tires. Joseph D. Walter and George L. Hall, Central Research Labs., Firestone Tire and Rubber Co. Two improved versions of a recently developed miniature force transducer were used to measure cord loads at the crown, shoulder, and sidewall of bias and belted-bias automobile tires under different testing conditions. As a transducer at a given location passes through the foot- print, a "basic shape" for the cord force pattern is generated for straight ahead rolling and cornering. Factors such as wheel load, inflation pressure, obstacle impact, tire speed, rim width, and frictional properties of the tire-drum interface can affect the total force excursion and/or the base line value but do not affect the basic shape of the patterns. For both bias and belted-bias construction significant ply-to-ply cord force variations were detected, and the cord force pattern observed in the first ply as the transducer passes through the footprint is nearly a mirror image of that in the second ply at the same location. 690523. Weighing Automotive Exhaust Emissions. Stan- ley H. Mick and John B. Clark, Jr., General Motors Corp. For more than a decade, the need for measuring exhaust emissions on the basis of weight of emissions per mile has been known. Because of the complexity involved in mass emission measurements, the original procedures and standards were expressed in terms of concentration. Since adoption of these early concentration standards, there has been continued effort toward development of mass emission measurement techniques. One such procedure has been proposed by the National Air Pollution Control Administration which employs a constant-volume blower and yields a concentration measure proportional to the mass flow. This equipment satisfies many of the objections to the previous mass measurement approaches, and is being considered for application in certifying 1972 model passenger cars. This procedure will measure higher mass emissions on both controlled and uncontrolled cars than those calculated using the 1970 procedure. General Motors has been working with the constant- volume sampler for the past year and a half. While this approach is competitive with any other known mass emission measurement technique, its meaningful use depends on many factors that must be closely controlled, since they affect the emission results. Before the procedure can be uniformly practiced, many more details of its use must be specified, and known sources of error must be resolved. Since all of these factors affect the weight of emissions that will be measured, rational standards cannot be adopted until the procedure is better defined. The various design requirements for the equipment are discussed along with the known limitations. 690524. Measurement and Prediction of Dynamic Pave- ment Loading By Heavy Highway Vehicles. Allan P. Whittemore, General Motors Proving Grounds. The measurement and prediction of dynamic tire-road interface forces of heavy trucks is covered. The develop- ment of equipment to provide continuous, accurate measurement of these forces is discussed. Pavement loads of three test vehicles under a variety of speed, load, and road conditions were measured. A time-domain analog simulation technique for predicting dynamic pavement loads based on measured road profiles and known vehicle characteristics is discussed. The simulation was also used to indicate the relative importance of vehicle parameters on dynamic pavement loading. 690526. Proposal for a Procedure for Evaluating Wet Skid Resistance of a Road-Tire-Vehicle System. J. J. Bajer, Ford Motor Co.</page><page sequence="72">690527-690530 At present, in order to cover all aspects of tire grip (cornering, deceleration, acceleration, effect of wheel hop), it is believed that the road-tire-vehicle system testing approach is the most meaningful and reliable. Well- defined testing surfaces are of paramount importance, and high-level test engineering expertise is a necessity. This paper will discuss the following: 1.A proposal for a road-tire-vehicle system testing procedure for evaluating tire skid resistance on wet, slippery roads. 2. The pros and cons of skid trailer versus complete vehicle tests. 3. The possibility of converting certain outdoor skid testing to indoor test equipment. 4. The effect of tire radial stiffness on wit skid resistance. 5. Performance of vehicle tests and tabulation of typical results. The objective of the proposed wet skid resistance test procedure is to evaluate the skid resistance of tires on various wet and slippery road surfaces, under various conditions of tire wear, and during various vehicle driving maneuvers. Tires are tested when they are new, partially worn, and totally worn, during performance of vehicle cornering, deceleration, and acceleration. Data obtained from these tests, make it possible to evaluate the wet road grip of tires as a function of the type of tire, the tread design and the tread compound. 1969 SA E Transactions 690527. Effect of Tractive Force on Directional Stability and Controllability of Vehicles. Tadashi Okada and Takeo Sagishima, Testing and Research Div., Toyo Kogyo Co., Ltd. Many studies have been made concerning the directional motion where only the steer angle of the front wheel is taken as an input. In the case of this input, it is possible to impose an assumption that the forward velocity of the vehicle is kept constant, and the equations of motion become linear and can be solved rather easily. These solutions are helpful in discussing the fundamental characteristics of the directional motion of the vehicle. However, the recent tendency of increasing the magnitude of the tractive force generated by wheels makes it inappropriate to disregard the effect of tractive force on the directional change of motion of the vehicle. In particular, tractive force has a powerful influence on a front wheel drive vehicle. Therefore, in order to make clear the directional motion where tractive force is an input, the following points are discussed in this paper. 1. A theoretical model of the vehicle with three degrees of freedom and the equations of motion based on it are established. These nonlinear simultaneous equations are approximated in linear form by applying the perturbation method and solved by the Laplace transformation. 2. The experimental method to measure the property of a tire and some of the experimental data are presented. These data are necessary for practical applications of the predictions obtained theoretically. 3. Transient responses of a front wheel drive vehicle and of a rear wheel drive vehicle are measured and compared with theoretical values. 4. A criterion is set up upon which the directional stability and controllability of vehicles are evaluated. 5. The means of improving the problems of the directional stability and controllability of a front wheel drive vehicle are suggested theoretically. 690528. The Study of Fracture Surfaces With the Scan- ning Electron Microscope. Om Johari, Metals Research Div., UT Research Institute. Direct examination of fracture surfaces is essential for understanding the mode and cause of failure. Low power optical microscopy, however, cannot reveal details at magnifications greater than 50x; the indirect technique of replica examination in transmission electron microscopy, while extensively used, requires considerable time and skill in preparing and handling the replicas and inter- preting results. The scanning electron microscope provides a unique tool for fractography because of its large depth of focus, wide range of useful magnifications, and satisfactory resolution. The technique is direct and fast, requiring very little specimen preparation, and the results are straightforward to interpret. These techniques are discussed with examples of fractography on tool and composite materials. 1969 SA E Transactions 690529. Product Reliability Programs Involve More Than Mathematical Methodology. H. S. Tolan, Jr. and J. Forgione, Ford Motor Co. A set of idealized engineering/manufacturing operational controls which can serve as models to mass production industry managements interested in implementing cor- porate-wide product reliability programs are described. Emphasis is on the modus operandi with which manage- ment should be acquainted and should support if the most effective use is to be made of the existing body of reliability methodology. The elements of a reliability program are defined, and a sound product specification system is shown to provide one of the most crucial elements. New specification system concepts are pre- sented which dictate the policies, procedures, organiza- tional structures and personnel responsibilities necessary to design and produce reliable products. 1969 SA E Transactions 690530. Hydraulic Brake Line Corrosion: An Initial Investigation of the Problem. A. G. Imgram, Battelle Memorial Institute.; and Donald K. Miner, Copper Development Association, Inc. Since little factual information has been available on the effects of service life on the performance of hydraulic brake lines, a program was initiated to obtain this information. Results of the program indicate that cor- 137</page><page sequence="73">690531-690539 138 rosive deterioration of the steel hydraulic brake tubing now being used on cars and trucks creates maintenance problems and can be a safety hazard. The investigation also showed that the performance of brake tubing now used becomes highly erratic after four to six years in service. Age of the vehicle appears to be more significant than mileage relative to brake tube corrosion. However, there are so many variables whiiich influence brake line corrosion that attempts to correlate the results of the investigation with any one factor, such as age, are difficult. The investigation also established that the appearance of brake tubing does not always give an accurate indication of its performance. 690531.

(SP-348) Fluidics - Review of European Fluidics. L. P. Gau, Chrysler Corp. Essentially leading developments of the newly emerging technology of fluidics have occurred in the United States and East and West Europe. Each tends to catch up very quickly with its front-running competition. For example, although pure fluidics was born in, and first exported by the United States, today you can buy Italian fluidics locally. Diaphragm element fluidics was first exported from Russia and East Germany, but may soon be surpassed by recent developments in the West. Industrial racing is no longer regional or national, but international in fluidics also. This review summarizes some of the specifics of that contest. 690536. (SP-348) Fluidics - Fluidic Vortex Valve Servo- actuators - An Advancement in Helicopter Flight Control Systems. W. D. Vann, U. S. Army Aviation Material Labs.; and T. S. Honda, General Electric Co. An experimental fluidic servoactuator system recently developed for the U. S. Army Aviation Materials Labora- tory is described. These actuators, developed for the pitch, roll, and yaw channels of a helicopter stability augmenta- tion system, utilized a vortex valve amplifier circuit to replace the more conventional spool valve, actuator combination. Vortex amplifiers with high turndown ratio, good linearity and low hysteresis were developed using MIL- H-5606 hydraulic fluid.

Approaches taken to adopt a power shift transmission driveline and a mechanical transmission driveline for gas turbine truck applications are described.

Various tests are also described. 690550. The Power Unit for Triples - A C.O.E. 4x4 Tractor. W. P. Panny and Arnold K. Riddle, North American Rockwell Corp. Two configurations of highway truck-trailer combinations being evaluated for hauling gross combination weight loads over 100,000 lb are triples (27-foot trailers) and long doubles (40-ft or 45-ft trailers). If and when these units become legal, the triples will probably be more widely used because of their better maneuverability, which would make it feasible to operate both on and off the thruways. It is generally agreed that two driving axles would be required for the higher gross combination weight loads in order to provide the needed gradeability and give acceptable axle component life and tire mileage. In the case of triples, the 4 x 4 tractor is the ideal power unit. Tests have shown that on snow-covered grades, the 4 x 4 has superior traction characteristics over the tandem 6x4 tractor having the same fifth wheel loading. The axles for a 4 x 4 power train should provide for a 2/1 proportioning of the torque between the rear and front axles for equal tire tractive effort. In order to obtain optimum axle life and tire mileage, the front axle should be designed to operate as a full-time drive unit. Discussion: T. E.

Computers Can Aid in Fleet Management. Brad- ford H. Kenyon and Pete Thatcher, Standard Oil Co. of California. Fleet management is now possible at a more profitable level than ever before. There are ways of reducing the cost of the record keeping, etc., required by the many regulatory bodies imposing themselves on business. It is possible not only to reduce these costs, but to actually increase the available information and to improve one's profit by pinpointing hidden cost areas within a fleet that are not now apparent. A fleet owner now can have current information on each vehicle - information to show which equipment is the most profitable to operate, information that allows for the testing of vehicle component parts, and even information to measure a vehicle's production compared with its cost of operation. Simple, flexible computer programs for vehicle man- agement are made available today by large petroleum suppliers. Because these programs have already been designed and have proved to be successful, there generally is no need to make any capital investment in order to use one. Further, these programs can be customized to fit the individual needs of any specific fleet with a minimum of implementation time. 690553. Equipment for Forest Fertilization. Jerry M. Page and M. Lee Gustafson, Technical Center, Deere &amp; Co. To meet future demands for forest products, intensive management practices must be implemented. Fertilization has great potential for increasing production, and it is receiving widespread interest in the timber industry. Helicopters and fixed wing aircraft have been used to broadcast fertilizer in most operational trials to date. Application cost has been a considerable portion of the total cost. Recent experiments using four-wheel-drive ground vehicles showed that application cost could be reduced considerably. Selective placement of fertilizer and combining operations are also possible with ground vehicles and cost can be reduced even further. Aircraft will continue to be used over difficult terrain and dense, natural stands where ground vehicles cannot operate effectively. The use of ground vehicles will increase, and the lower application cost should accelerate the growth of forest fertilization. 690554. Koehring Harvester for Pulpwood. John Kurelek and John J.

Features are: cylinder nonsymmetry, bulk modulus varying as a func- tion of pressure and entrained air, valve pressure/flow, and pump pressure/flow characteristics. Results indicate that the most critical parameters, based on effect on performance and difficulty in predicting their values, are damping and bulk modulus. The simulation can be readily extended to include other effects such as cylinder and load friction and Coulomb friction, time varying externally applied loads, and valve underlap or overlap. 690557. The Effect of Some Fuel and Engine Factors on Diesel Smoke. N. A. Henein and J. A. Bolt, University of Michigan. Possible mechanisms for smoke formation in the diesel engine are discussed. Emphasis is placed on the effects of some engine and fuel factors on carbon formation during the course of combustion, including cetane number, fuel volatility, air charge temperature, and after-injection. The tests were made with a single-cylinder, open chamber research engine, with three fuels, covering a wide range of inlet air temperatures and pressures. There is evidence that smoke intensity increased with increase in the cetane number of the fuels with inlet air temperatures near atmospheric. Increase in the air charge temperature caused an increase in smoke intensity for volatile fuels and had an opposite effect on less volatile fuels for the open chamber engine used. The smoke intensity was found to increase dramatically with after- injection, with all other parameters kept constant. The concept that flame cooling is the main cause for smoke formation is examined. The experimental results obtained in the study indicate that the chemical properties of the fuel are the main controlling factors in smoke formation. 690558. A New Generation of Multigrade MS Oils.

Selection of Frames, Springs, and Axles for Utility Vehicles. A. R. Kaduk, G. Mladsi and E. D. Clise, White Trucks Div., White Motor Corp. For proper frame selection on utility vehicles both the chassis frame rail resisting bending moment and moment of inertia must be considered, along with proper derrick subbase size. Utility vehicle springs should be designed to provide tolerable ride characteristics, and also function as a stable base for the operating derrick. Utility vehicle axles must be of sufficient size to safely support the vehicle during on or off-highway travel, and at the work site. 690564. Computer-Aided Spur Gear Design. D.

Specific conclusions are drawn pertaining to materials, functional requirements, and general sizes and shapes of seat belt components. Some comments are made regarding the necessary testing and information which is required to fully evaluate the proper attachment and location of the seat belt on construction equipment. 690569. Engineering Basics of Roll Over Protective Structures. G. L. Klose, Caterpillar Tractor Co. Widening horizons on the social implications of engineer- ing activity are creating new demands on technology. One of the demands on construction vehicle engineering groups is that operators be given reasonable protection against crushing should the vehicle roll over. In this paper the history of such structures is reviewed, basic design considerations are emphasized, and possible evaluation methods are presented. 1969 SA E Transactions 690570. Determining the Static and Dynamic Coefficient of Friction and Its Causes for Variation. Saul Herscovici, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works. A simple and economical testing fixture and method that may be used for determining the static and dynamic coefficients of friction and the operating conditions that cause their variation is described in this paper. Its advantages are compared to those of a partial vehicle test fixture. This testing method could provide a basic set of data that can be properly converted by the designer to predict the response of a clutch or brake in a new application. 690571. Mechanical Controls for Vehicles with Hydro- static Transmissions. Richard D. Houk, Morse Controls Div., North American Rockwell Corp.</page><page sequence="78">690572-690579 The major components of the hydrostatic transmission - namely, the pump and the motor - are described and their operation outlined. Then the five basic controls required on vehicles equipped with hydrostatic transmissions are discussed, namely: engine throttle, transmission, steering, service brakes, and parking brakes. 690572. Roller Traction Drive for Quiet, High-Speed Power Transmission. Lubomyr O. Hewko, New Departure-Hyatt Bearings Div., General Motors Corp. The principle of operation and dynamometer test results of a fixed ratio, planetary speed reducer which uses preloaded, lubricated rollers for transmittal of power is discussed. The unit features a torque actuated, automatic preloading mechanism, which prevents slippage even under severe overload and greatly improves reliability, life, and efficiency of the drive. Test results indicate efficient, quiet, and vibration free operation at pitch line velocities up to 30,000 fpm, such as might be encountered in turbo- machinery. Examples of roller traction drives ranging from 500 to 3 hp tested in several applications are also briefly discussed. Discussion: H. J.

Many vehicles today are called all-terrain vehicles although none of them have true all-terrain capabilities. To provide the performance capabilities required and the dependability needed, designers still find it necessary to design for the specific use intended instead of being able to design a universally accepted vehicle for many purposes. The introduction of recently available hydrostatic components and suspension components which eliminate the need for lubrication should extend the versatility and dependability of off-highway vehicles. 690574. New Concept - Small Two-Track All Terrain Vehicle. Herbert A. Jespersen, Cushman Motors. The design of a new concept of an all-terrain vehicle is described. It is new because of its small size, completely flexible rubber tracks, and twin, manually controlled hydrostatic transmissions for fully modulated control of the vehicle. Many configurations for this type of vehicle are outlined and the reasons for selecting the final design are given. 690575. Engineering Features of the Terra-Tiger Vehicle. L. R. McGrath, Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co. Scientific and technological advances with an assist from the population increase have been instrumental in the creation of more available time for leisure and enjoyment. The design of the Terra-Tiger, a six-wheeled, lightweight, highly maneuverable sports type vehicle was intended to fill a market which would help satisfy the needs of leisure time. The text of this paper describes the vehicle, its operation, and its engineering features. 690576. Fatigue Life of Forged Roller Bearings. Charles W. Williams and Joseph S. Learman, Federal- Mogul Corp. Accelerated life tests of roller bearings manufactured by conventional means and by forging from bar and plate are described; test results made by Weibull plot are also presented. Grain flows of traces manufactured by the various processes are illustrated and described. 690577. Rating of Tapered Roller Bearings Through Continuing Worldwide Quality Audit. H. R. Niefert, Timken Roller Bearing Co.; and F. J. Wren, British Timken. Periodic revision of tapered roller bearing ratings, and reappraisal of the rating formula used by Timken have been accomplished by a continuing testing program on standard product bearings. An extensive sampling plan, designed to include bearing product up to 6 in. OD from both domestic and overseas manufacturing plants, is fully described. A review of recent fatigue tests on over 5000 bearings substantiates experimentally the rating increases announced in 1967. Limited bearing fatigue tests under different conditions of lubricant, temperature, and speed than used for establishing bearing ratings have indicated the need for determining rating adjustment factors to compensate for the influence of the application environ- ment. 690578. Needle Bearings in Farm Tractor Drivelines. Charles E. Horn, Torrington Co. Prior to the late 1940's, there were not many applications of needle bearings in farm tractor drivelines. However, when more expanded performance was demanded of farm tractors, modern technology necessitated a new look at their use. This paper discusses the newer applications of needle bearings, dealing with the most basic types and uses. Requirements are listed and speeds and loads to which they are exposed are summarized. 1969 SA E Transactions 690579. Family of Military Engineer Construction Equip- ment (FAMECE). Allen O. Elkins and Henry W. Schaefer, U. S. Army Mobility Equipment Res. and Dev. Center.; and Dwight M. Brooks, Peat, Marwick, Mitchell and Co. A review of the U. S. Army concept for development of a Family of Military Engineer Construction Equipment (FAMECE) in light of basic problems facing the military engineer is presented. Problems evaluated are air and ground mobility, increased productivity, maintenance of unit integrity, and standardization of unit design. Although in the past the military attempted to develop lightweight, compact equipment which could be dis- assembled, such equipment did not perform to operational 143</page><page sequence="79">690580-690589 144 standards under field conditions. This led, however, to the FAMECE concept of a power module being utilized with a wide variety of work moduli. It addresses the problems of mobility, standardization, and logistics. At present, the program is well along in terms of conceptual design and is backed by several years of research, and development efforts. 690580. Wínterízation of Vehicles to -50F. John Bell, U. S. Army Mobility Equipment Res. and Dev. Center. General problems of subarctic operation, results of the 1968-1969 winter testing at Ft. Churchill, Manitoba, Canada, and the testing planned for the 1969-1970 season at Ft. Churchill are described. Significant findings from the 1968-1969 testing indicate the vital importance of care in preparation of vehicles for the arctic, the need for greater simplicity and reliability in design of winterization systems, and the inadequacy of currently used elastomeric components (hoses, o-rings, etc.). 1969 SA E Transactions 690581. Profile in Earthmoving - Caterpillar 992 Wheel Loader. J. L. Hasten, Caterpillar Tractor Co. The 992, 10 cu yd wheel loader represents Caterpillar's latest product specifically designed and developed as a primary loading tool for handling ore in mining and blasted rock; and other loading functions in the construc- tion industry. Loading performance and operator comfort as they relate to productivity rank among the primary objectives for the 992 because of the demanding nature of rock loading on machine and operator alike. This paper discusses 992 features including its unique structural design, drive line improvements, remotely located and driven pump system and other major engineering features and designs towards the objectives of high productivity, reliability, serviceability, and safety in operation and servicing. 690582. Performance Requisites for an Engineer. Nor- wood L. Snowden, Caterpillar Tractor Co. A view of performance requisites of the engineer, and the engineer as a manager, coupled with helps for measuring an individual against them are presented. The pprime measuring tool is face to face interviewing. A method of obtaining maximum efficiency from this tool by conduc- ting the interview without breaking the laws of listening is presented. 690584. Synthesis of an Engineer. Gordon L. Scofield, Michigan Technological University. The requisites of an engineer are discussed from the academic point of view. These requisites are related to the goals of engineering education. The synthesis of an engineer is considered to take place in the laboratory and classroom during the academic career of the student. The several aspects of engineering education are outlined and explored in order to stimulate thought on which ex- periences build technical competence and which ex- periences establish the complementary qualities required for a successful career in engineering. 690587. An Improved Lubricant for Hydrostatic Trans- missions. J. Q. Griffith III and C. R. Schoengold, Sun Oil Co. Automatic transmission fluids, motor oils, and multi- purpose tractor oils are now widely used in hydrostatic transmissions. These fluids provide adequate service in most of today's relatively low pressure equipment, but future requirements will be more severe and better lubricants will be needed for tomorrow's larger, higher pressure equipment. An improved hydrostatic fluid has been developed which should help optimize performance of present and future hydrostatic transmissions. Results of a 100-hr, 5000 psi hydrostatic pump test were excellent. Analysis of the used oil and examination of the equipment indicated the fluid would have continued to perform satisfactorily much longer. 690588. Type C-2 - A New Fluid for Heavy -Duty Powershift Transmissions. R. H. Schaefer and R. L. Black, Allison Div., General Motors Corp. The usage of special heavy-duty transmission fluids has proved their value over earlier use of engine oils in powershift transmissions. But due to continued demands by the earthmoving and construction industries for improved transmission performance and durability, the need for a significant increase in the quality of those transmission fluids became apparent. Thus, a specification for a new fluid, Type C-2, was developed. This paper discusses the new fluid specification in terms of its requirements, the procedures set up whereby the various companies of the oil industry may qualify their fluids, and the continuing program to evaluate the performance of approved Type C-2 fluids. 690589. Case 1970 Agri-King Tractors. M. R. North, J. I. Case Co. New models of farm tractors have been introduced by Case for 1970. They are designated the 770, 870, 970, and 1070 Agri-King Models, which replace the discontinued 730, 830, 930, and 1030 Comfort King Models. The program was initiated in the fall of 1964 with the intent of designing an all new farm tractor. These are completely new models of tractors with different styling, new engines, power shift transmission options, and other features. The 770 tractor is in the 55-hp class with a 251 cu in. displacement gasoline or a 267 cu in. displacement diesel engine. The 870 tractor is available with a 301 cu in. displacement gasoline or 336 cu. in diesel engine and is in the 70-hp class. The 970 model has a 377 cu in. gasoline or a 401 cu in. diesel engine and is in the 85-hp class tractor. The 1070 is available with only a 451 cu in. diesel engine, and is in the 100-hp class.</page><page sequence="80">690590-690598 690590. Case's New Family of Open Chamber Diesel Engines. Robert M. Riley, J. I. Case Co. A new family of open chamber diesel engines has been developed for heavy duty agricultural tractor and industri- al equipment applications. These 4 and 6 cyl inline engines have a common stroke of 5 in. Displacement is varied within common blocks through cylinder bore sizes of 4.125, 4.375, and 4.625 in. These engines are either naturally aspirated or turbocharged to obtain ratings from 67 to 180 bhp. They feature long life at medium speeds under heavy-duty conditions while maintaining an ex- ceptionally low specific fuel consumption. 690591. Depth Control of Integral Flexible Implements. R. W. Hook, John Deere Des Moines Works.; and K. E. Murphy, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works. The trend to larger and heavier integral implements mounted on faster and more powerful farm tractors has brought increased emphasis upon the parameters for balanced design of implement-tractor stability, weight distribution, and hitch lift capacity. This paper discusses how load and depth response for an entire integral flexible implement and additional tractor hitch lift capacity may be obtained with a single-lever hydraulic control system. The system utilizes gage wheels on a flexible implement that is mounted to the tractor 3-point hitch. The gage wheels, mounted on the flexible outriggers of the implement, are actuated by hydraulic cylinders connected in series with the tractor rockshaft cylinder. Cylinder displacements are sized so that the flexible outriggers lift in synchronism with the tractor 3-point hitch. All cylinders synchronize at each full stroke. Since draft loads are applied to the tractor 3-point hitch, the entire integral flexible implement is load responsive and maintains a uniform draft load over uneven terrain. 690592. An Auxiliary Front-Wheel Drive Using Tractor Hydraulics. Lester L. Nighswonger and James H. Polaček, John Deere Waterloo Tractor Works. The need for improving tractive performance of the farm tractor gave the impetus for developing this hydrostatic front wheel drive. Design features of the drive and its components are given along with a discussion of how it integrates into the basic tractor. Field studies comparing two wheel drive tractors with auxiliary front drive equipped tractors are presented. Some considerations made in arriving at front wheel torque are noted, as are various lab tests conducted in developing drive compo- nents. 690594. Analog or Digital Choice. J. R. Martin, Seaman Nuclear Corp. Digital control in the electronics field has come to be commonplace in the past decade. Analog systems are still the major control means in mechanical and hydraulic machinery. Examples of digital and analog systems in nature are related to common practice. Availability and economics of digital and analog equipment are reviewed. 690595. Solid-State Control Design Using Logic Modules. Lynn E. Nowak, Square D Co. The Norpak solid-state control system employs a single function approach to logic design. This means that one function, the NOR, is used alone or in combination with other NOR's to achieve all logic functions. Knowing the one NOR logic function permits understanding of at least 90% of the logic components in the system. 690596. New PCSA Standard for Hydraulic Cranes - Its Purposes and Implications. Robert Gagnon, Insley Mfg. Co. For several years, there has been a need for standards on a new type of equipment called mobile hydraulic cranes. This is a recent development which is advancing rapidly in design and offers extended mobility and flexibility in operation. In 19967, the Power Crane and Shovel Association general membership requested PCSA Standards Com- mittee to formulate and draft a standard for mobile hydraulic cranes which is now called PCSA Standard No. 2. The purpose of this paper is to outline briefly the background and activity of the committee and its working together with other important committees, to clarify some of the values in the standard and the importance of proper machine inspection and maintenance and application therein, and to recognize accepted standards for these machines. 690597. Design Factors for Hydraulic Crane Booms. L. W. Livengood, N. C. Hargreaves, G. C. Noll and R. J. Bushong, Koehring Co. Hydraulic crane boom design factors, such as loading, weight, extension method, and configuration are discussed with special emphasis on the practical aspects of their effect on mobility, lifting capacity, and boom length. A brief history of hydraulic cranes and telescopic booms as well as future potential is discussed. 690598. New NH-A Lightweight Heavy-Duty Engine. Orien A. Kruse, Studebaker Corp. The new Onan 25-hp, heavy-duty, aircooled gasoline engine features an aluminum die-cast cylinder block. The aluminum die cast construction combines the advantages of high thermal conductivity, minimum production cost, and is light in weight. The inherent balance of the 2-cy linder opposed configuration provides smooth operation over the oper- ating speed range. Pressure lubrication, full flow oil filtration, and high efficiency panel air cleaner are some of the features which assure durability in the severest application. 145</page><page sequence="81">690599-690608 146 690599. A Modern 2 Cu. In. 6.5-Lb. Logger's Chain Saw. Harry I. Hazzard, McCulloch Corp. The Power Mac 6 loggers chain saw at 2 cu. in. and 6.5 lb cuts 2.8 sq ft of wood per minute. It was designed to satisfy both the casual user and the professional market, where its light weight and ease of handling make it quite attractive. The weight and configuration of the saw are analyzed to show developments which permit more productive and safer modes of operation. Component design and functioning are reviewed principally in their relation to the whole package and its performance. 690601. Accelerated Testing of Light Industrial Machines. John L. Hobson and Kenneth O. Switzer, John Deere Dubuque Tractor Works. Accelerated testing has become a very big tool in the product engineering of light industrial machines. Meas- urements and testing under field and lab conditions produce information to guide the designer on new machines and rapidly measure his success. The availa- bility of advanced computer systems, tape recorders, lab test facilities and life prediction theory has improved the abiliy to predict life of the machine. This paper outlines some of these techniques being used at the present time. 690602. A Procedure for the Specification of Distributor Pumps for High Volume Production. P. Howes, C.A.V. Ltd. The D.P.A. distributor pump has been developed over the past 15 years by C.A.V. to meet the need of the European diesel industry for a preset pump suitable for high volume engine production. The procedure for arriving at F.I.E. specifications, starting with initial trials and working through to final production rehearsal, is described in this paper. A "master pump" system is used for monitoring and controlling production fuel levels. Among other factors brought out in the paper are delivery curve shape control, choice of advance curve and its influence on smoke, efficiency, and cylinder pressures. 690604. Hydraulic Filtration and Component Life Correl- ation. E. C. Fitch, Jr., Oklahoma State Univer- sity. A new method of correlating hydraulic component contaminant tolerance levels with hydraulic filtration performance has been developed using a cleanliness level chart. The chart provides a means of expressing contamin- ation levels from particle count data. Methods are discussed for deriving component tolerance levels and rating filter elements on the basis of their efficiency characteristics. The correlation achieved enables the designer to establish the performance, reliability, endur- ance, and ultimate life of the hydraulic equipment. 1969 SA E Transactions 690605. Hydraulic System Filters: How They Perform in the Field. J. L. Blaylock, Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co. The best method and usually the final test to determine the performance of a filter is to install it in the hydraulic system. Tests were conducted using this method of evaluation. It has been shown that the performance of a filter in a given system can usually be determined after a few minutes operation. Test data also indicate that if properly applied, partial flow filtration can achieve the same results as full flow. 1969 SA E Transactions 690606. The Importance of Silt Removal Filtration in Mobile Vehicle Hydraulic Systems. John A. Farris, Pall Corp. The causes of abrasive wear in mobile vehicle hydraulic systems are discussed and laboratory and field data are presented to show why ultrafine filtration is required to control degradation of fluid system components caused by abrasive wear. Among the advantages of ultrafine filtra- tion are the vehicle manufacturer's reduced warranty and flushing costs, and user benefits of longer fluid and component life, less downtime, fewer spares, and less maintenance man-hours. 1969 SA E Transactions 690607. The 920 and 930 The Design of Two New Wheel Loaders. Jack Jaeger, Caterpillar Tractor Co. The Caterpillar articulated wheel loader models 920 and 930 were designed for lightness, speed, and maneuvera- bility. The major design areas discussed are: loadability, frame, power train, ease of operation, safety, and serviceability. By comparison with the previous model 922, the 920, with the same bucket size and horsepower, is 5% lighter, has a 20% shorter turning radius, and displays an average production advantage of 43%. In comparison with the 2-yd, 105-hp 944, the 930, with a 1.75-yd bucket and 100 hp, is 15% lighter, has a 16.5% shorter turning radius, and displays an average production advantage of 10%. 690608. Long 5-N-l - The Evolution in Hydraulic Back- hoes. Brant G. Elliott, Long Manufacturing Co., Inc. The Long 5-N-l tractor-loader-backhoe combination is well-balanced, maneuverable, rugged, and economical to produce. Furthermore, it is capable of performing a greater variety of tasks than previous backhoes. The unitized frame has provided the ruggedness. The relatively short wheelbase of 78 in. and short turning radius in combination with the instant reversing trans- mission has made the 5-N-l highly maneuverable. The weight distribution in an unloaded condition is approx- imately one-third on front wheels and two-thirds on the rear or driving wheels. The quick-change feature for attachments on the loader and the center-mounted hydraulic crane have achieved a versatility heretofore lacking in machines of this type.</page><page sequence="82">690609-690616 690609. Versatility, Key to New Power Shift Transmission Concept. L. E. Henyon, Clark Equipment Co. A new series of power shift transmission is described and the analysis made in determining capacity requirements is explained. Design sequences are described which allow minimum component changes when progressing from minimum to maximum performance characteristics throughout the series. 690611. A Comment on the Statistical Energy Approach. J. L. Zeman and J. L. Bogdanoff, Purdue University. The statistical energy approach method for estimating the gross response in complex interconnected structural systems is described. The method is intended to compen- sate for the difficulties present in evaluating parameters and excitation needed when attempting to use traditional methods of linear vibration analysis. The amount of information needed to apply the method is modest and the formulas are easy to use. Some limitation on application is demonstrated by a detailed example. 690612. The NASTRAN Computer Program for Struc- tural Analysis. R. H. MacNeal and C. W. McCormick, MacNeal-Sch wendler Corp. NASTRAN is a large digital computer program for static and dynamic structural analysis by the finite element approach. The program is intended primarily for large problems with hundreds or thousands of degrees of freedom. All mathematical subroutines are designed for efficient solution of large problems by taking maximum advantage of matrix sparsity and handedness. A flexible executive system facilitates addition of new functional capabilities. The paper describes major functional capabilities of NASTRAN and convenience features for the user. 690613. Aircraft Engine Response Due to Fan Unbalance. H. L. Leve and F. A. Biehl, McDonnel Douglas Corp. The analytical procedures required in computing high- bypass turbofan-engine support system dynamic loads induced by a fan unbalance are discussed. The detailed analyses involve the coupling of pylon and engine vibration modes in the modal coordinate system and the determination of the steady-state response due to an unbalance in the rotating fan. Gyroscopic effects, engine case ovalization flexibility, and a redundant restraint to an external support are investigated. Graphs summarize the computed results and show the sensitivity to gyroscopic effects. 690614. An Integrated Aerospace Dynamic Program. R. W. Mustain, McDonnell Douglas Co. An integrated aerospace dynamic program encompasses a full range of dynamic tests and analyses required to evaluate, develop, and qualify an aerospace vehicle. Analyses are required to establish dynamic criteria and structural integrity of the aerospace vehicle. Dynamic criteria include shock, vibration and fluctuating pressure excitations during various phases of the vehicle life. Thus, criteria should be predicted for the transportation phase as well as for the flight mission. Analytical techniques should be used to predict liftoff excitations, aerodynamic excitations, engine transients, ordnance excitations, entry dynamics, and landing dynamics. Dynamic analyses are required to determine structural modes, frequencies, and responses for the evaluation of structural design and guidance system functions. Dynamic response of large equipment masses should be computed. Math models with varying degrees of complexity are required with matching computer programs. Dynamic analyses should be verified by ground test programs and flight test programs. Dynamic measure- ments should be made during transportation and flight to establish or verify environments and to assess the structural effects. Shock, vibration, and acoustic tests should be conducted to supplement analytical predictions and to test structures and equipment. Tests are required to verify dynamic environments, structural modes, structural integrity, and dynamic responses of local structure and large equipment masses. Wind tunnel tests should be run to study flutter characteristics of the structure and to refine fluctuating pressure levels in clean areas, protuber- ance areas, and bow shock areas. 690615. Mathematical Modeling Via Direct Use of Vibra- tion Data. Joseph P. Young and Frank J. On, NASA. The process of reducing a physical system to a mathemat- ical representation is a prevalent task mutual to all fields of analysis. Sometimes the system of equations, or mathematical model as commonly known, will be modi- fied on a trial and error basis to make the model respond in some predetermined fashion or react so as to match behavioral data obtained from the actual physical system. This paper presents a survey of activities to produce logically based schemes to generate mathematical models by making use of experimentally derived information. Primary attention is given to modeling of mechanical structures for purposes of dynamic analysis. Emphasis is given to current effort at Goddard and in particular to the recent studies designed to verify the practical effectiveness of a specific modeling scheme. Strengths and weaknesses of the various modeling schemes are discussed. The point is made that they all belong in the analyst's bag of tools and it is his task to best match the particular job. 690616. Design and Test Criteria for Components Subjec- ted to Explosive Shock Environments. S. R. Lane, TRW, Inc. Full-scale ground tests of explosive separation of missile stages defined the shock environment for sensitive components, and indicated the requirement for specifica- 147</page><page sequence="83">690617-690623 148 tion of test criteria according to component weight or location. Design and qualification test criteria for the components were derived by enveloping the peaks of ensembles of shock test response spectra. This approach was justified by analytical considerations. The resulting test criteria specified response spectra tolerance limits of &amp; 100% and -50%, and a damping ratio of 0.05 (Q = 10) for the shock response spectra analyses. A shock synthe- sizer electrodynamic shaker system was used successfully to conduct shock qualification tests using the criteria developed for the separation shock environment. 690617. Nonuniformities of Reverberant Sound Fields and Their Implications for Sonic Test Specification. David Lubman, Bolt, Beranek, and Newman, Inc. Nonuniformities of sound level occur in all reverberant rooms including those used in sonic testing. A theory is presented which describes these variations statistically in terms of analysis bandwidth and room reverberation time. The theory applies above a certain cutoff frequency and in regions remote from room boundaries. These nonunifor- mities produce uncertainty in the room averaged sound spectrum levels leading to potentially serious risk of undertest or overtest. A methodology is proposed whereby the risk of any degree of undertest or overtest can be predicted and controlled in advance. The methodology employs hypothesis testing applied to the known statistics of the sound field. 690618. Environmental Control System for Command and Service Modules of Apollo Program - System Description and Discussion of Problem Areas. Frank H. Samonski, Jr., NASA Manned Space- craft Center.; James M. Ross, North American Rockwell Corporation.; and Henry Nicolello, AiResearch Manufacturing Company. The significant problems encountered in the development of the environmental control sysstem for the command and service modules of the Apollo spacecraft are de- scribed in this paper. Three problem areas and the solutions are discussed in detail: corrosion in the cold- plates, deficiencies in the heat-rejection capability of the space radiator, and performance defects in the evaporator. A summary of the constraints imposed upon the envi- ronmental control system designer because of spacecraft and mission considerations is given. Also, a brief ex- planation of the environmental control system and its functions is included. 1969 SA E Transactions 690619. Lunar Module Environmental Control Subsys- tem. Richard Gillen, Manned Spacecraft Center NASA.; Frank Elliot, Grumman Aerospace Corp.; and Richard Wilde, Hamilton Standard Div, United Aircraft Corp. The lunar module environmental control subsystem provides life support functions, active cooling for the heat loads, and water and oxygen. Featured designs include brushless d-c motors, water sublimators, water-gas centrif- ugal separators, and cold rail electronics cooling. Testing proceeded incrementally from component development through flight vehicle vacuum chamber demonstrations. Major developments required were the water sublimators, water-gas centrifugal separators, oxygen pressure regula- tors, and iodine-water compatibility with the system. The flight records of the lunar module environmental control subsystem have been satisfactory. 690621. Transient Thermal Performance Prediction of the Lunar Module Environmental Control System. H. R. Howell and J. L. Williams, LTV Aerospace Corp., Missiles and Space Div. An analytical thermal model of the project Apollo lunar module and a digital computer routine for processing the thermal model are described. The thermal model simu- lates the environmental control system, the crew, and the vehicle structure. The computer routingg utilizes a unique computation technique to minimize computer time re- quirements. Experimental data from thermal vacuum tests of the lunar module and results of the transient thermal analysis are compared. Thermal predictions for nominal missions are compared with the Apollo 9 and 11 flight data. 690622. Environmental Control of Apollo Applications Program Orbital Assembly. Joseph C. Cody, NASA. The approach used to integrate the thermal and life support systems of several large spacecraft into a unified environmental control system is presented. Due to the size and complexity of the structure, a thermal model of the entire Apollo Applications Program Orbital Assembly could not be adequately formulated, therefore, output data from structural thermal models of the modules were utilized in a systems thermal model to evaluate the thermal interactions of the modules. Atmospheric models were built to predict the humid- ity, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide concentrations throughout the Orbital Assembly. Analysis were also performed to assure that the odor removal systems would adequately control atmospheric odors. The results of these studies have shown that the performance of the orbital vehicle environmental control system will meet requirements. 690623. Airlock Environmental and Temperature Control Systems. Leslie D. Calhoun II, McDonnell Douglas Astronautics. The principal objective of the Apollo Applications Program is to keep astronauts in space for extended periods of time. This paper reviews the environmental and temperature control systems needed to support men in space for periods up to eight months. The environmental control system must pressurize the various stages with mixed gas atmosphere, control oxygen pressure, remove</page><page sequence="84">690624-690631 carbon dioxide, and provide cooling for astronauts wearing liquid cooled garments. The temperature control system features a bifillar radiator for flow stability, electrical wall heaters for warmth, and thermal curtains to minimize heat loss.

The design of the thermal control and ventilation system for the Saturn IB Orbital Workshop is described and the design techniques employed are discussed. The thermal control system was designed in accordance with man's comfort and physiological requirements, with emphasis placed on analytical methods to verify system perfor- mance. The statistical procedure employed for evaluating off-design system performance is also described. 1969 SA E Transactions 690625. Lunar Module Thermal Control and Life Support Systems for Apollo Applications. Ronald E. Renman and Andrew R. Mendelsohn, Grum- man Aerospace Corp. A derivative of the Apollo Lunar Module is being developed to support the operation of a manned, earth orbiting solar observatory. Its thermal control and life support systems demonstrate how previously developed technology and hardware are satisfying mission require- ments which differ significantly from those for which the vehicle was originally designed. Thermal control is accomplished by active and passive means. The active portion of the system employs liquid heat transportttt and rejection networks. Insulation systems, thermal coatings, and conductive couplings are used as much as is practical to minimize the effects on the vehicle of variations in the external thermal environment. The Apollo Lunar Module life support system has been extensively modified to permit both shirtsleeve and extravehicular crew activities. 690626. Regenerative Carbon Dioxide Removal System for the AAP Cluster. Joseph B. Gillerman, AiResearch Mfg. Co., Div. of Garrett Corp. A regenerative carbon dioxide removal system being developed for spacecraft life support systems comprises two molecular sieve canisters. The canisters operate in cycles and maintain the carbon dioxide percentage within required levels for a three man crew over a minimum period of 28 days before regeneration is required. Unlike the expendable chemical removal techniques used for Gemini and Apollo, the cyclic, nonexpendable adsorption system can meet, with a minimum weight penalty, the carbon dioxide removal requirements of extended space flights planned in the future. 690628.

Net hardware - that is, hardware virtually complete and ready for installation and service is now being produced economically for the aircraft industry by modern casting processes. High-density parts are being made in complex shapes, tailored to the design engineer's requirements. The concept that has made this a reality is the monolithic shell mold. Complex configurations are practical, within rea- sonable limits, size is no great problem, and freedom in part positioning allows much more effective gating techniques. 690629. Shear Spinning - a Substitute for Forgings. Jack D. Stewart, Standard Pressed Steel Co. Shear spinning is being utilized as a substitute for forging. The attributes of forgings, grain refinement, flow patterns, microstructure, etc. are maintained or exceeded by this process. In most instances, a forging is still required, but if so, it is only a small fraction of the final spun part size. The process engineering, rather than the theoretical aspect of the shear spinning processes, are covered in this paper. 1969 SA E Transactions 690630. Electron Beam Weldments for Large Complex Shapes. William H. Beecher, Electron Beam Welding Systems, Sciaky Bros., Inc. An electron beam welding process, evolved from its primary use in research and development laboratories to a production method that now gives design and manufac- turing engineers a proved means of fabricating large complex structural members of the type used in the aircraft and aerospace industries, is described. Using this method of fabrication, many large complex forgings can be replaced with simpler and less expensive fabricated sections. In a number of applications, these forgings can now be replaced by two or more smaller simpler forgings; smaller forging used in conjunction with standard rolled sections; or assemblies made completely of rolled sections. Large assemblies which are beyond the capability of most forging presses can also be fabricated by the electron beam welding process. 690631. Mechanical GSE for the Next Generation Air- craft. George A. Olsen, Grumman Aerospace Corp. The importance of mechanical ground support equipment on current military aircraft is discussed, as well as the many influences of new aircraft configurations on the next generation of mechanical GSE. Primary emphasis is placed on outlining support philosophy, mechanical GSE configurations, operational site requirements, and aircraft missions with associated support needs. Future applications of the following support concepts are considered: trestle line testing, built-in test, total support packages, containerized shops, single GSE config- uration, Rapid Automated Problem Identification Data 149</page><page sequence="85">690632-690638 150 System software, and total weapons systems harmoniza- tion. Support techniques and mechanical test and support equipment are discussed relative to the following phases of operation: developmental, production and factory test, military operations, organizational level, intermediate level, depot level, and unique aircraft carrier and austere base operations. The summary highlights GSE trends in support concepts and hardware configurations and defines specific areas requiring improvements to assure future total support capability. 690632. The Economics of Integrated Logistics Support. Ernest C. Seaberg and Wendell A. Triplett, RCA. Techniques for evaluating the economics of integrated logistics support as applied to the selection of support systems are discussed. The prime objective here (and in the utilization of such techniques) is to develop methods for generating quantitative data for cost optimization of support philosophy including test equipment selection, manpower factors, inventory factors, facilities, deploy- ment, and equipment maintenance considerations. A deterministic model is described, including the enumera- tion of its capability in terms of versatility to evaluate many alternatives rapidly and inexpensively since it presently exists in the form of an operating computer program. This includes sensitivity testing of significant parameters to evaluate the cost effectiveness trends of support alternatives. Input data requirements are also reviewed along with various cost effectiveness indices used to judge the system's worth based on quantitative results representative of specific applications. 690633. Advanced Cargo Handling Systems. H. F. Mor- rison and C. B. Wright, Douglas Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. Advanced cargo handling systems will be heavily influ- enced by standardization of next generation air cargo modules, containers and pallet loads. These influences will be felt through the entire logistics system of military and commercial airlift. Terminals, cargo handling equipment, surface transportation, and management systems will be subject to new demands in capability, operation, and productivity. Of prime interest is the aircraft load/offload interface and its effect on present and future equipment. It is timely to consider the setting of future design require- ments to assure a support system that will complement the evolution of standard air cargo modules. 1969 SA E Transactions 690634. Problems of GSE Standardization. H. K. Hän- chen, Northrop Corp. Some significant problem areas for standardization of ground support equipment are discussed, including capa- bility, state of art and/or obsolescence, flight vehicle design, specifications, procurement, availability and logis- tic support. Investigation of these problem areas indicates that solutions are not readily available and present major challenges to both industry and using agencies. However, recognition of the problem areas is a significant step toward a solution. Considerable effort will be required for finding solutions, and it is recommended that a study or studies be conducted to establish more formal factors and criteria for assessing an item for standardization. The studies should seek to develop an evaluating methodology which could also be standardized. 690635. Trailer Design for Mobility. R. J. Benson, Advanced Mobility Associates. A few salient aspects of aerospace ground equipment needs are examined with respect to running gear and trailer mobility analysis considerations and design config- uration determinations. This initial analysis and config- uration rendering is highly germane to the AGE designer generation of all definitive and essential supporting logic for inclusion as part of the end item specification in serving all management levels as the procurement logic against which all further determinations will issue with confidence. Definitive procurement logic is also of extreme value to customer management as reflected in proposals from prime contractor management and as procurement logic serves the source management, in appreciably mitigating if not precluding the numerous delaying and costly problems previously found attendant to wheeled AGE trailer mobility. 690637. Advanced Integrated Life Support Systems - A Status Report. John B. Hall, Jr., NASA, Langley Research Center. For space missions exceeding several months it has become necessary to develop equipment to close the metabolic materials loops by recovering oxygen from expired carbon dioxide and reclaiming potable water from liquid wastes. This equipment, because of the complex nature of the physical and chemical processes involved, will require the development of advanced regenerative concepts with emphasis on maintainability, high relia- bility, and automation to insure mission success. Programs are already underway at the NASA Langley Research Center to develop such regenerative integrated life support systems. This paper presents the status of this effort, which includes the Integrated Life Support System, plans for the development of advanced subsystems, and a summary of NASA contract NAS 1-7905, Trade-Off Study and Conceptual Designs of Advanced Regenerative Integrated Life Support Systems. 690638. A Hydrophobic-Hydrophilic Zero Gravity Liquid Gas Phase Separator. C. G. Saunders, NASA, Langley Research Center. A number of zero-gravity liquid-gas phase separators, such as rotating units, elbow type units, porous plate, and the hydrophobic-hydrophilic type discussed in this paper are being developed for spacecraft use. The basic theory</page><page sequence="86">690639-690644 of this unit is presented and the application of surface tension phenomenon is discussed as they apply to the desiign. The materials of construction are covered, and the ultimate use on Apollo 11 is described. 1969 SAE Transactions 690639. Effect of Atmosphere Selection and Gravity Upon Flammability. R. A. Neustein, P. P. Mader, G. V. Colombo and D. E. Richardson, McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co. The relationship of gravity level and atmosphere composi- tion to the ignition and propagation of flame has been investigated so that accurate interpretation can be made of flammability data of materials considered for manned operations. Testing has been done at zero g in a KC-135 aircraft and at gravity levels up to 5g in a centrifuge test facility. The burnings were executed in 72-liter pyrex reaction flasks, in which pure oxygen, helium-oxygen, neon- oxygen, and nitrogen-oxygen atmospheres were evaluated. Data were recorded with high-speed photo instrumenta- tion. The ignition and flame propagation characteristics of a material are both measurements of its flammability. The ignition temperature is a function of oxygen partial pressure. Diluents, added to the atmosphere, increase the time required for a constant power ignition source to heat the material to its ignition point. The rate of flame propagation depends upon the gravity level and the atmospheric composition. The rate increases with gravity because convection, and the resulting supply of fresh oxygen to the combustion reaction, are increased. At null gravity, combustion proceeds at a very low rate and may stop. 1969 SAE Transactions 690640. Electrochemical Concentration and Separation of Carbon Dioxide for Advanced Life Support Systems - Carbonation Cell System. R. G. Huebscher and A. D. Babinsky, TRW, Inc. The carbonation cell system is an electrochemical system which concentrates and separates carbon dioxide from an enclosed environment. Areas of application include spacecraft, submarines, and aircraft employing closed- loop oxygen rebreather systems. Concentration and separation of the carbon dioxide are performed in two stages; Stage I is the concentrating stage upsing an alkaline electrolyte and Stage II, which uses an acid electrolyte, accomplishes separation of oxygen from the carbon dioxide. The effluent oxygen is returned to the enclosed environment and the carbon dioxide is discarded overboard. This paper describes the research and development toward the design of a four-man prototype system. Initial feasibility tests are summarized and results from endur- ance tests in excess of 2000 hours on the individual system stages are discussed. A comparison with other carbon dioxide removal systems is included. 1969 SAE Transactions 690642. Zero-G Water Separator Selection: A Perfor- mance Tradeoff. Richard W. Smith, McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Co. A trade-off study to select a water separator system for a 3-man, 140-day, zero-g mission is described. Included is a summary of feasible concepts, a compilation of data on existing hardware, and a comparison of the performance characteristics of each with respect to the overall system. Six approaches to zero-g water separation were considered and are discussed: hydrophobic/hydrophilic screens; integrated condenser-water separators; centrif- ugal separators; cellular sponges; vortex separators; and elbow separators. Some of these techniques have high- performance characteristics with regard to water removal efficiency. However, when reduced to hardware, these same techniques may not integrate well with the overall system. The system selected was the integrated condenser- water-separator. This system requires no power, has no moving parts, and has a very small envelope. 690643. Long-Term Operation of a Water Electrolysis Module. F. H. Schubert, TRW, Inc. A water electrolysis module (WEM) has been designed to provide 3.6 lb/day of oxygen at a current density of 100 amps/sq ft and at a pressure level of 80 psia. Although designed for aircraft application, the concepts employed in the design of the module make its use in other life support systems possible. One of the 10-cell water electrolysis modules fabrica- ted, and designated as WEM No. 1, has been successfully operated for 7525 hr. These hours consist of 300 hr of parametric, 180 hr of cyclic, and 7045 hr of endurance testing, to date. The endurance test program is being conducted at a current density of 80 amps/sq ft, a temperature of 175 F, and a pressure level of 30 psia. This paper describes the cell and module configura- tions and the materials of construction selected. Results of the parametric and cyclic test programs are presented and cell performance and servicing and maintenance require- ments discussed. The endurance test program of WEM No. 1 is presently continuing. 690644. Zero-Gravity Testing of a Waste Management System. Bert Cooper and J. V. Wagner, Fair- child Hiller, Republic Aviation Div. The testing of a waste management system designed and fabricated for use in a space vehicle is described. The system provides for the collection and inactivation of urine, feces, emergency diarrheal disorders, vomitus, and debris; the volumetric determination of each micturition; and onboard storage of the inactivated wastes within the waste management system compartment. The zero-gravity test program conducted in a KC-135 151</page><page sequence="87">690645-690649 152 aircraft provided the primary verification of the perfor- mance of the wastes within the waste management system compartment. The test hardware simulated the actual system to a high degree of fidelity with respect to operational characteristics of the airflow required in collection, mechanical functions and system pressure differentials, in order to minimize simulation errors. A unique, specially designed waste dispenser actually defecated and urinated to provide controlled variables of inputs to the waste management system, thereby eliminating the need of a human subject for the waste management system. Varia- tions in urine rates, quantity, and velocity as well as variations in fecal consistency, weight, and size were controlled, thereby establishing a common base to evaluate potential changes in the overall system. The test program flexibility provided the operations inputs necessary to establish a firm design configuration to be established prior to subjecting the system to environmental qualification. The successful completion of zero-gravity tests assured the designer that the waste management system will meet specification performance requirements in the space vehicle. 690645. Teflon Coatings. Charles M. Smyrk, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Co. The four major fluorocarbon polymers used by the coating industry today are discussed. The fluorine content and the strong carbon bond of these four polymers account for their unusual characteristics of chemical inertness, resistance to degradation, thermal stability, and low surface friction. As the fluorination is increased, the physical properties of the various classes of polymers are affected. Tables are presented illustrating these variances. In conclusion, the polymer polytetrafluoroethylene is analyzed. Its chemical and physical properties, methods of preparation and application, as well as uses are presented. An unlimited field is visualized for nonstick coatings (Teflon-S) with long lasting lubrication characteristics in both consumer as well as military applications. 690646. Recent Developments in Applications of Elec- troless Nickel Plating. Glenn Mallory, Allied Research Products, Inc. Recent developments in the field of electroless nickel plating are outlined. Metal ion reduction by boron- containing reductants is a significant advance and gives deposits which are phosphoros-free, metal-boron-alloys. Properties of these deposits such as composition, struc- ture, density, hardness, etc. are reviewed. Two types of reducing agents can be employed in aqueous electroless nickel systems. This paper stresses the preference for dimethylamine borane (DMAB) in the plating bath. The special properties of nickel-boron alloys and the versatility of DMAB plating baths suggest a number of applications such as plating of electronic components, high temperature applications, and applica- tions where uniformity and thickness of deposits is a basic requirement. The primary limitation of DMAB is the high cost of the chemical which might make certain applica- tions not economically practical. 1969 SA E Transactions 690647. Interface Formation, Adhesion and Ion Plating. Donald M. Mattox, Sandia Labs., Ceramics and Surface Physics Div. The surface condition and type of interface which is formed determines the adhesion which can be obtained in a film-substrate couple. Ways to control the surface condition and allow the formation of desirable types of interfaces before, during, and after the deposition of a coating are briefly discussed. The use of sputter cleaning as a surface preparation technique, and "ion plating" as a means of increasing adhesion by increasing the energetics of the deposition process are stressed. In the ion plating process, the surface to be coated is subjected to a high energy ion bombardment before and during the actual deposition. The principal benefits obtained by this process are the ability to: sputter clean the surface and maintain it "clean" until the first monolayer of film material is formed; provide a high energy flux to the substrate surface thus enhancing diffusion, chemical reaction, and the like; alter the surface and interfacial structure and thus change the interaction mechanisms and rates. Specific examples of the use of the ion plating technique to enhance adhesion, corrosion protection, and so forth are presented. 1969 SA E Transactions 690649. Commuter Air Carriers Concepts, Problems, and Potential. J. J. Quinn and Richard Engbaum, Golden West Airlines, Inc. The progress of fixed-wing commuter carrier operations on the West Coast during the initial two years of service are reviewed. How the insistent demands of public needs forced the ideal operational concepts to be modified and abridged to fit the existing environment are described. The airplane was available, but the ring of metropoli- tan stolports, the acceptance facilities at the major hub terminals, and the advanced navigational aids had not yet been budgeted, much less approved or provided. The problems that were solved in fitting the airplane into the existing air traffic system while providing high frequency passenger service within some sort of economic feasibility are discussed from a practical point of view. The non-existence of government subsidy further aggra- vated the situation. However, the infant industry now appears to have shaken out the majority of problems and the way is now clear to extrapolate a fairly sound indicated growth potential. With operating costs now beginning to be balanced by revenue, the successful commuter air carriers are now poised to turn increased public demand for rapid access to trunk airlines into widened profit margins.</page><page sequence="88">690652-690661 690652. High-Altitude Performance of High-Bypass-Ratio Engines - an Airframe Manufacturer's Point of View. D. W. Bouwer and G. J. Schott, Boeing Co. The traditional method of determining the net thrust of an engine in cruise is explained. It is shown to result in a satisfactory net thrust uncertainty for jet and low- bypass-ratio engines but to be unsuitable for high- bypass-ratio engines. A redefinition of net thrust results in a new thrust determination method, called continuity method, which yields acceptable levels of net thrust uncertainty. The new method no longer requires sup- porting tests in a simulated altitude facility. The question is raised whether in future programs the demonstration of guaranteed cruise performance of an engine should not be carried out in flight tests rather than in an altitude test facility. 1969 SA E Transactions 690655. Altitude Testing of High Bypass Ratio Fan Engines. Alan Yarker and Fred Stanhope, Rolls-Royce Ltd. By testing a large bypass ratio turbofan engine in an altitude test facility, the performance under simulated flight conditions can be measured. Good accuracy of the results demands careful selection and use of pressure transducers and load measuring equipment. Such a test measures thrust under quiescent air conditions. Model tests need to be used to determine the changes in engine flow and thrust coefficients brought about by the influence of the free stream flow. 1969 SA E Transactions 690658. A New Concept to Provide Emergency Auxiliary Power for Aircraft. C. E. Elliot and D. A. Straznickas, Sundstrand Aviation. A totally new concept for providing emergency auxiliary hydraulic and electric power for commercial and military aircraft is described. The approach is ideally suited for meeting the demands for secondary power during an all-engine-out situation. The concept is a totally self-contained, monofueled, turbine system. It consists of a constant speed turbine deriving its power from a monofuel, which is fed to a decomposition chamber and controlled by a unique fuel control system. Fuel is stored hermetically until required. It is then supplied via a positive expulsion tank system yielding attitude and altitude independent operation. Explanation is given specifically about system philosophy, fuel selection, fuel tankage, gas generator, turbine power conversion, control system and ground checkout. 690659. Emergency Monopropellant Auxiliary Power Units for Large Commercial Aircraft. A. Colin Stancliffe, Airesearch Manufacturing Co. The use of liquid monopropellant powered turbopumps designed to provide emergency hydraulic power for large commercial aircraft is discussed. This type of equipment has been used in the past in missile hydraulic power supplies, and the application to aircraft emergency use represents no major changes or advances in technology. Fuel selection criteria, decomposition chamber design, turbine design, and gearbox layout are discussed as well as the control system. The integration of this type of equipment into other power producing units is briefly described. 690660. Communication Satellites and Their Possible Influence on the Automobile. J. L. Huit, Rand Corp. The progress of communication satellites is briefly summarized and their future technological potential is highlighted. The promise of UHF satellites for mobile communication services is described, including new concepts permitting intense sharing of these frequencies with satellites without penalizing the established and allocated usage. The future of travel and the automobile is discussed, including the competition among various modes of travel and between travel and electronics for communicating. Some new ideas about future auto- mobiles, a freeway express transit, and an automated urban local transportation utility are presented, and an interpretation is made about the possible future role of the automobile. 690661. Major Subsystem Development in the Apollo Program. John H. Boynton, Aaron Cohen and Kenneth S. Kleinknecht, NASA. The development from program inception of major Apollo spacecraft systems is reviewed. Those subsystems which required significant advances in current technology are highlighted, and important system development derived from Project Mercury and the Gemini Program is discussed where pertinent. The overall approach to satisfaction of mission requirements in the Apollo space- craft is outlined in relation to the manned lunar landing. The paper illustrates that all mission-critical systems were designed with a high degree of reliability and redundancy because of the limited flight frequency, the denial of inflight maintenance, and the absence of an inflight rescue capability. For the lunar module, the first true spacecraft, significant unknowns that faced space- craft designers could not be effectively resolved in any of the earth-orbit flight programs. Based on the unqualified success of Project Mercury and the Gemini Program, however, major state-of-the-art advances were required for the entire Apollo spacecraft in only a few subsystems such as the guidance and navigation systems and certain crew-related subsystems. A summary of the mission accomplishments to date and a discussion of future flight programs using Apollo hardware is presented. A brief projection is given as to the major development tasks which might be required in order to introduce Apollo spacecraft components into follow-on vehicles designed for longer duration missions. 153</page><page sequence="89">690662-690667 154 690662. Lifting Body Flight Tests and Analysis. John G. McTigue and Garrison P. Layton, Jr., NASA Flight Research Center. Lifting entry vehicles offer significant potential in terms of performance and economy, as a result of reusability, for a variety of future space missions. In flight tests at the NASA Flight Research Center, Edwards, California, three vehicles - the M2-F2 (recently redesignated M2-F3), HL-10, and X-24A - are being used to investigate handling qualities and subsonic-transonic aerodynamics of lifting body vehicles. Flight results from approximately 50 flights of the vehicles indicate that a pilot can control, maneuver, flare, and land this class of vehicle. These flights have also provided valuable data on the aerodynamic behavior of the vehicles. 690663. Potential Materials for Gas Turbines Operating at 2200 F Blade Temperature. A. R. Stetson, Solar Div., International Harvester Co. A wide variety of materials are evaluated for their potential consideration as candidates for future use into gas turbine blading. Material categories include dispersion strengthened alloys, coated columbium based alloys, coated dispersion strengthened alloys, chromium cermets, coated carbon bonded-graphite cloth composites, refrac- tory metal wire reinforced superalloys, laminated metal- ceramic composites, an intermetallic compound, and superalloys as baseline. Nine tests to assess these material properties are described. Conclusions indicate that coated refractory metals and coated carbon bonded-graphite cloth composites have good potential for development, refractory metal wire reinforced superalloys have fair potential for development into 2200 F turbine blading, and all other candidate materials have poor potential for development. Low strength and poor impact resistance were the major limitations of the majority of materials evaluated. 1969 SA E Transactions 690664. Materials Applications and Structural Concepts for Hypersonic Air-Induction Systems. P. Paul Plank, Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co.; and Lawrence R. Phillips, Wright- Patterson Air Force Base. Typical Mach 6 hypersonic cruise vehicle data are used to define temperature, loads, and criteria, and to identify potential materials and structural concepts for air- induction systems associated with a two-dimensional variable-geometry inlet. It was found that the superalloys can be used at temperatures below 1600 F for 500 hr of life to satisfy the requirements of all air-induction system areas by cooling with liquid hydrogen. The thermo- structural concepts found to be most attractive for use in inlet designs are radiation-cooled surface panels with an insulated substructure and regeneratively-cooled plates over surface panel structures supported by an insulated substructure. 1969 SA E Transactions 690665. Reinforced Plastics Design Rolls-Royce RB. 162 Lift Engine. R. V. Blackhurst, Rolls-Royce Ltd. Glass-fiber-reinforced composites are being used success- fully in the Rolls-Royce RB.162 pure jet lift engine. It has been demonstrated that composites can be designed to replace conventional materials in certain environments and valuable weight will be saved, without incurring a high cost penalty. This paper deals with only the design aspects of the composite hardware, and covers the evolution of the production standard of intake and nose cowl, front bearing housing, compressor casing, and the rotor blading. 1969 SA E Transactions 690666. The Design of Boron/Epoxy Turboprop Reduc- tion Gear Case. David A. Turner and William E. Springer, Allison Div., General Motors Corp. The structural design of a composite material front housing for the T56 turboprop reduction gear case is described. The objective of the composite gear case is demonstra- tion of the feasibility of composites for stiff, lightweight gear reduction cases and the advancement of structural and material technology. Turboprop reduction gear assemblies have typically used magnesium or aluminum for the case structure. Magnesium has reasonable strength properties and low density but the modulus is also low; furthermore, it exhibits poor corrosion resistance. Aluminum has suffi- cient strength but the specific stiffness is similar to magnesium so the case is heavy for many applications. In addition to these disadvantages, the mounting require- ments for propellers, engine, and transmissions dictate high loads on the gear case structure. Consideration of these factors indicated the desira- bility of case materials stronger than magnesium with no weight penalty and adequate corrosion protection. A review of suitable case materials showed composites offer the major advantages. The selected boron/epoxy exhibits high strength and specific stiffness, lightweight, good corrosion resistance, and suitability for molding. 1969 SA E Transactions 690667. Lubricity of Aviation Turbine Fuels. R. A. Vere, Esso Research Centre, England. A laboratory test rig has evaluated European jet fuels with regards to lubricity and shows that the more highly refined fuels are poorer in lubricity than the conventionally refined fuels. The addition of a surface active additive such as a corrosion inhibitor improves lubricity. Ex- perience of additive addition to fuel for aircraft of two European airlines in 1968 confirms laboratory results. Highly polar compounds extracted from conventionally treated fuels significantly improve lubricity when added tc highly refined fuels. The blending of 10-20% of a conventionally treated fuel to a highly refined fuel improves lubricity to the levei of the conventional fuel. 1969 SA E Transactions</page><page sequence="90">690668-690675 690668. Methane Fuel Systems for High Mach Number Aircraft. Stanley Greenberg, Pratt and Whitney Aircraft. Problems and limitations associated with JP fuels at high Mach numbers have led to an interest in fuels with better heat sink and high temperature capabilities such as methane. Studies have shown methane to offer perfor- mance advantages for SSTs relative to JP, but the overall attractiveness of methane will depend upon the extent advantages are nullified by practical disadvantages. Problems and penalties of storing methane in an aircraft constitute some of the important "practical disadvan- tages." Several representative methane storage schemes for Mach 3-6 transport aircraft are evaluated, primarily on the basis of minimum weight. Fuel system weight (including tankage, insulation, plumbing, boiloff, etc.) is shown to be 6.3-13.6% of the fuel weight for methane depending upon the type of storage scheme used and upon the aircraft speed and range. By contrast, fuel system weight for JP is 2.5-3% of the fuel weight. Effects of the fuel system fraction (ratio of fuel system to fuel weight) upon payload are shown. This report serves as a "primer" on the topic of methane storage in aircraft. It also brings unresolved issues into sharper perspective and suggests what should be done to clarify the future role of methane as an aircraft fuel. 690670. Hydraulic System State-of-the-Art Advances on the 747 Airplane. A. B. Billet, Boeing Co. The 747 airplane, the largest commercial airliner, is the first American airplane for airline service to use fully powered flight controls without manual reversion. The four hydraulic systems permit the highest degree of reliability per system operation with all major controls powered by dual-tandem actuators or having redundancy in location of operation. This airplane has 500 hydraulic horsepower as com- pared to the 87 hydraulic horsepower used on the 707 airplane. Each system is powered by an engine-driven pump and an air-driven pump. The latter is operated during peak demands only. In 17,000 hr of ground and flight tests, the 747 hydraulic systems have achieved and exceeded required performance and reliability. 690671. Air Transport Food Systems Integration. L. W. King, Lockheed-California Co. Food service and galley integration and construction on transport aircraft are discussed. Integration of the galley system and the aircraft is the responsibility of the airframe producer. The air carrier participates in establishing performance requirements, optimizing design of new airborne equipment, and upgrading ground equipment and facilities to minimize obsolescence. Special attention is given to the galley system of the Lockheed-California L-1011. 690672. Development of the DC- 10 Automatic Landing Monitor. H. L. Harenberg, Jr. and J. H. Shan- non, Douglas Aircraft Co., McDonnell Douglas Corp. The development and introduction of an automatic landing system into revenue service is discussed, with particular emphasis upon the early achievement of a high level of pilot acceptance. The concept embodied in the performance and failure assessment monitor system of the DC- 10, and the extent to which this concept is expected to contribute to greater pilot acceptance and to increased utilization of the automatic landing system, is discussed in detail. This concept differs from previous automatic landing monitor systems primarily with respect to the scope of the monitor's view of the monitored process and the depth of the resulting assessment. Previous systems are based on some scheme of logically associating the outputs of in-line and/or parallel command signal comparators. The perfor- mance and failure assessment monitor assesses overall performance of the automatic landing mode of flight control system operations by comparing what the con- trolled aircraft is, in fact, accomplishing against an independent model of what it should be accomplishing. Failure verification and failure reversion control are based upon the availability of an immediate accurate assessment of the consequences of a failure indication. 1969 SA E Transactions 690673. Design and Testing of an Aircraft Nucleonic Fuel Quantity System. W. P. Walker and F. J. Steinbrenner, Lockheed Georgia Nuclear Lab. A new type of aircraft fuel quantity gaging system has been designed, fabricated, and is being flight tested. The system utilizes nuclear radiation to obtain a mass measurement of fuel quantity, be it fluid or in the emulsified state. This type of system offers advantages over present devices in the areas of maintainability, reliability, and accuracy. 1969 SA E Transactions 690674. Advanced Technology in Airline Passenger Ser- vices. Richard P. Ensign, Western Air Lines, Inc. The impact of airline transportation on the business and leisure worlds, the demand for greater effectiveness in servicing larger numbers of passengers each year, and the need for more stringent public health measures in the preparation, storage and service of foods are discussed. Technical advancements, particularly in low-temperature storage, as a solution toward meeting the high and low-temperature requirements of the U. S. Public Health Service and Western Air Lines operating experience with cryogenic cooling of galleys on their 707, 727, and 737 fleets are reviewed. 690675. Development Testing of the New Generation of Large Jet Aircraft. Edward J. Shockley and Herman W. Sisson, Lockheed-Georgia Co. 155</page><page sequence="91">690677-690684 156 The new generation of large transport aircraft require the utilization of improved development test techniques discussed in this paper to ensure timely and efficient development cycles. Although the development test program on the C-5, largest of today's airplanes, has not been completed, a comprehensive accumulation of signifi- cant data in all test phases and extensive experience in managing and conducting the testing of these hugh transports have been obtained. The C-5 greatly advances the state-of-the-art, but more important to this presenta- tion are the advancements in test techniques. Increased aircraft size and complexity require additional emphasis on early, valid planning for test facilities and support equipment. Improved techniques for data retrieval and additional sophistication in laboratory test loading sys- tems are essential for efficient accomplishment of the program. 690677. Some Recent Innovations in Wind Tunnel Test- ing Techniques. Francis M. Wilson, Jr. and Brooks W. Maddox, Lockheed-Georgia Co. In recent years, several innovations have been made in wind tunnel testing techniques which have significantly improved the testing cost effectiveness. Use of colored water spray in low-speed testing causes unsuspected vertices to stand out, allowing quick and accurate drag reduction filleting to be prepared. Simultaneous force and pressure model transonic testing has reduced the time and cost to arrive at a low drag airplane configuration by more than 50 percent. Means are being developed to predict high Reynolds number transonic airloads accurately from low Reynolds number data. The use of accurately sized glass beads to provide boundary layer transition for transonic testing has been found to reduce run to run drag data scatter by more than 50 percent. 690678. Integrated Flight Test Data System with Real- Time Graphic Display. J. A. Strom and L. D. Crowley, Douglas Aircraft Co., Mc Donnell Douglas Corp. Future flight test programs of sophisticated commercial and military aircraft, requiring a multitude of parameter measurements and fast data turn-around-time, dictate the need for a new approach to data acquisition and processing. This paper shows how these goals will be met using a total system approach to automate the process while keeping the "man in the loop." The airborne system includes universal signal condi- tioning, digitizing, high packing density serial tape recording, and simultaneous telemetry transmission for up to 400 data channels. The ground station permits real-time and nonreal-time processing of multiple data streams without the need for editing or pre-processing procedures. The principal features of the ground station include advanced data acquisition front ends, a third generation computer, and cathode ray tube graphic displays of data in engineering units which permit on-line interactive data processing by the flight test engineer. 1969 SA E Transactions 690679. Principles and Procedures Essential to Low Cost Launch Vehicle Goals. Donald M. Ross, Ed- wards Air Force Base. The importance of design, fabrication, and management procedures in reaching the objectives of low-cost launch vehicles is discussed. Principles and philosophies essential to low-cost launch vehicles are covered and supported with examples of proved practices in somewhat parallel fields of endeavor. Progress is reported on the technology phase of the Air Force's low cost propulsion development program. The presentation concentrates on the develop- ment of pressure-fed, liquid propellant rocket propulsion for meeting the program objectives. Most of the manage- ment aspects discussed relate to the fundamentals that are essential in meeting cost goals. 690680. Fabrication Techniques - HY-140 for Flight Type Pressure Vessels. R. A. Sipe and W. A. Jennings, Boeing Co. Fabrication results experienced with HY-140 steel flight- type pressure vessels are discussed. Hy-140 steel is a recently developed quenched and tempered alloy (5Ni- CR-Mo-V) structural steel with a yield strength of 140,000 psi. Fabrication techniques applied, the tooling used, and the problems encountered are described in detail. 690683. Noise Reduction Possibilities for a Light Helicop- ter. D. R. Halwes and C. R. Cox, Bell Helicopter Co. Results of a preliminary design study to establish the degree of quieting possible in a light helicopter are discussed. The study consists of analytical investigations of noise-reduction measures and of the penalties in performance and mission capabilities. Design data are presented for modified and redesigned versions of the OH-58A Light Observation Helicopter (LOH). The mod- ified version is a test bed for verifying the predicted noise reductions, while the redesigned version shows the extent of changes and increase in weight that are necessary to give an operational LOH the performance and payload of the OH-58A. Predicted noise, performance, and cost of the quiet versions are compared with those of the OH-58A. 1969 SA E Transactions 690684. Recent Research in Rotor Noise Reduction. Harry Sternfeld, Jr. and Robert H. Spencer, Boeing Co., Vertol Div. Although improved rotor technology has created rotary- wing aircraft with higher blade noise, adherence to the design criteria presented in this paper permits improved helicopter performance with improved noise levels. Single- rotor slap may be avoided by careful consideration of blade span load and tip speed. Tandem-rotor slap may</page><page sequence="92">690685-690693 similarly be avoided by maintaining adequate clearance between the rotor discs. High-speed or transnic slap can be eliminated by operating rotors below Mach critical for the specific airfoil section. Advanced airfoil design may permit higher speeds as well as lower noise levels. There is general agreement that our current noise- conscious society will not tolerate undue noise levels of any sort, and it is certainly true of aircraft development. Designers will have to deal with noise criteria for rotor design or risk unacceptably noisy aircraft. 690685. Rotor Blade Design for a Fan- Jet-Powered Heavy-Lift Helicopter. H. G. Smith and R. J. Sullivan, Hughes Tool Co., Aircraft Div. Technical considerations involved in the design of a lightweight, simple, and inherently fail-safe rotor blade for use on a large fanjet-powered heavy-lift helicopter are discussed. The structural design is oriented toward minimization of dynamic loads response, both as seen by the blade and as transmitted to the airframe and to the rotor controls. Unique to this blade design is the need to perform as a fanjet propulsion duct simultaneously with the other conventional rotor blade functions. Pressuriza- tion and thermal effects must thus be considered in the overall technical picture, as well as duct area and hydraulic diameter considerations. The propulsion gases under pressure act to provide inherent damage indication for the primary structure. The low dynamic response and the simple notch-free structure are expected to provide excellent fatigue life. Thermal environment permits use of all major rotor blade structural metals except aluminum alloy. The light blade weight in conjunction with the tip nozzle acts to inherently reduce the coning angle versus blade weight. Cost and maintenance are expected to be competitive with conventional shaft-driven rotor blades of similar size. 690687. Unique Features of the TF41 Turbofan. William H. Thomas, General Motors Corp., Allison Div. The TF41 turbofan is a joint development of the Allison Div. of General Motors Corp. and Rolls-Royce Ltd. It is in use in the U. S. Air Force Ling-Temco-Vought A-7D Tactical Fighter aircraft. This paper deals with a general discussion of the engine cycle and the low pressure/inter- mediate pressure compressor aerodynamic design. It also covers design, manufacturing, and development problems related to the front bearing support, and the design and manufacturing techniques for the bypass ducts and the annular bypass mixer. 690688. Design Considerations of the TF34-GE-2 High Bypass Turbofan Engine. P. Niederer and R. E. Houlihan, General Electric Co. The TF34 high bypass turbofan engine is being designed and developed to fulfill the powerplant requirements of the Navy S-3A (VSX) aircraft. The Navy established specific requirements from the start of the development program to assure that the TF34 meets the very stringent demands of its carrier-based anti-submarine warfare environment. This paper discusses the selection of the optimum engine cycle and the aircraft mission analyses conducted to demonstrate that the selected engine met ASW mission requirements. 690689. Eutectic Superalloys. E. R. Thompson and F. D. George, United Aircraft Research Labs. As a representative of eutectic superalloys, the mechanical characteristics of the Ni3Al-Ni3Cb eutectic are discussed and compared with commercially available superalloys. The thermal expansion and oxidation behavior of this alloy are also discussed. The microstructure of this material is lamellar in nature and consists of approx- imately 44% (vol) of the reinforcing phase Ni3Cb in a matrix of Ni3Al. Its melting temperature is 1280 C (2335 F), the eutectic composition is 68% (wt) Ni3Cb, and its density is approximately 8.5 gm/cc (0.3 lb/in.3). 1969 SA E Transactions 690690. Versatile Launch Vehicle Digital Autopilot. Nel- son G. Freeman and Peter B. Teets, Martin Marietta Corp. A new digital flight control system (DFCS) being used in the Titan IIIC space launch vehicle is discussed. In this system, flight equations for the boost phases and coasting phases are time-shared with guidance equations in a new, general-purpose digital computer. Special software has been incorporated in the DFCS so that it can be used for a broad spectrum of mission and payloads. In addition, malfunction-detection and correction logic has been incorporated into the software for improved mission reliability. The paper describes the special tools and techniques used in developing the DFCS software; it discusses some of the solutions to development problems concerned with digital filter accuracy, environmental noise susceptibility, and bending mode foldover; and it presents flight-test results. 690691. Semi- Active Gravity Gradient Stabilization Sys- tem. W. N. Redisch, NASA.; and A. E. Sabroff, P. C. Wheller and J. G. Zaremba, TRW Systems, Inc. A semi-active gravity gradient attitude stabilization system (SAGS) providing active pitch control and semi- passive roll/yaw control has been developed. The design and development of the SAGS controller for space flight test on the NASA developed packaged attitude controller secondary payload spacecraft are described and perfor- mance predictions are presented for the first flight test scheduled in August 1969. Initial in-orbit performance of Delta PAC-1 is summarized. 690693. VTOL Flight Investigation to Develop a Deceler- ating Instrument Approach Capability. John F. Garren, Jr., James R. Kelly and Robert W. Sommer, NASA. 157</page><page sequence="93">690694-690699 158 The inability of available situation displays to provide a decelerating instrument approach capability to a hover led to a flight research program in which control-command information was displayed for three degrees of freedom. The test aircraft (NASA CH-46C in-flight simulator) was stabilized with high-gain attitude command system. Using this system, the pilot was able to decelerate the aircraft to a hover while simultaneously followwing a 6:deg glide path. Although these tests deomonstrate the potential of this concept, a number of factors, including adequate integration of command and situation information, were identified as affecting pilot acceptance of the system. 690694. V/STOL Vertical Situation Display. Robert A. Bondurant III and John H. Kearns III, USAF Flight Dynamics Lab. The capability of V/STOL aircraft (including helicopters) to fly an assortment of approach and landing flight profiles dictated the need for a display that presents pilot situation information in the vertical plane. This paper describes the development of a display system known as the flight profile indicator (FPI) designed to provide this information in a manner analogous to that of the USAF horizontal situation indicator. The FPI is a cathode ray tube device that displays the geometrical relationship between the parameters neces- sary to determine the aircraft situation in the vertical plane. The significant advantage of the FPI is that it minimizes the pilot's need to interpret various kinds of vertical situation information presently available on aircraft instrument panels and provides a more rapid, accurate, and easier assessment of the aircraft status and flight progress in the vertical plane. It is not intended, however, to replace existing guidance and control infor- mation such as flight director displays; but will comple- ment current and projected navigational aids and dis- plays. 690695. Experiment Design and Data Acquisition for V/STOL Flying Qualities Simulations. Charles R. Chalk and David L. Key, Cornell Aero- nautical Lab., Inc. An approach to the design of flying qualities experiments is outlined, the data that should be collected is indicated, and several aspects of flying qualities simulation in variable stability aircraft are discussed. In particular, attention is focused on the need for properly collected pilot rating and pilot comment data, the need for acquiring control usage information with sugges- tions for the form in which this information should be documented, and the importance of identifying, verifying, and documenting the dynamics characteristics simulated when using variable stability aircraft. 1969 SA E Transactions 690696. Development of a Digital Variable Stability System. Boris G. Palarz, North American Avia- tion Div., North American Rockwell Corp. Evaluation of design parameters for VTOL fixed-wing aircraft are simplified and speeded up by the use of this digital variable stability system. This paper details the extensive preparation for developing the overall system and explains how and why the various subsystems were chosen. These development processes reflect guide lines for successful VTOL design practices, besides providing a truly flexible and complete system that allows various testing techniques to be devised so as to obtain meaning- ful and repeatable data. 690697. Adventures with Aluminaut. Arthur L. Marke, Reynolds Submarine Services Corp. The future of manned exploration of the seafloors of the world's oceans is discussed, with particular emphasis on the Aluminaut, a 50-ft long submarine, carrying a payload of six persons and 6000 lb with a capacity to submerge 15,000 ft. Various experiences of the Aluminaut are presented, including research and salvage operations. 690698. Development and Use of Underwater Work Systems. Charles E. Bodey and Ronald J. Knight, North American Rockwell Corp. Subsea work systems are summarized. These systems range from tools used to salvage cannon from "Vasa" in 1628 to the capability of the "Glomar Challenger" to coredrill in 18,000 ft of water in 1969. A variety of underwater work requirements are identified. Work systems, classified and described, include diving systems, submersibles, unmanned vehicles, and remotely controlled equipment. A specific system is detailed which utilizes an underwater one-atmosphere manned work station, and a manned submersible equipped with a manipulation capability. Technical descriptions of subsystem char- acteristics and hardware photographs are provided. 690699. Lockheed Deep Quest - An Advanced Sub- mersible for Deep Ocean Research. P. E. Sum- mers and W. P. Crenshaw, Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. The Lockheed Deep Quest submersible was designed and built as a mobile, deep ocean research and engineering test facility. The submersible combines excellent habita- bility with superior underwater performance, and has the capability to carry heavy, large volume payloads to depths down to 8000 ft. Deep Quest has been utilized in the evaluation of a variety of underwater work systems and instrumentation, including dual manipulators, a large object salvage module, a 6-bbl coring system, an experimental vane shear device, a sidelooking sonar, and an advanced doppler navigation system. This paper describes design features which represent advancements in deep ocean technology and, on the basis of material problems experienced, indicates major areas requiring further developmental effort. 1969 SA E Transactions</page><page sequence="94">690701-690706 690701. Developments in Soviet Aerospace Manufac- turing Technologies. Anton Dobler, Harry Koe- nigsberg and David Van Winkle, U. S. Air Force Systems Command. Soviet aerospace systems production capability has progressed rapidly during the past 15 years through sustained, intensive manufacturing technology research. Accomplishments and programs in forging, extrusion, metal working and metal joining technology are generally as advanced as those of the west. In forging and extrusion press construction, electro discharge machining, ultrasonic machining, glue welding, pulsed arc, magnetic arc and electroslag welding Soviet technology excels and is in advance of Western technology. Development programs are underway to continue to advance the state of the art for conventional as well as high-temperature structural application. Combined with demonstrated characteristics of ingenuity, innovation, and originality of approach a high potential exists for future achievement. 690702. Low Cost Solid Booster Technology. W. Cohen and R. A. Wasel, NASA. The technologies of solid rocket components and the effects of cost consciousness on the state-of-the-art are discussed. Motor case technology has developed steels which do not require quench-temper heat-treatment and have high flaw tolerance, thus providing major cost optimizing opportunities. Nozzle technology for large solid motors is surprisingly good and accumulating knowledge points to appreciably cheaper nozzles made of prosaic materials before developed in the future. Other areas reviewed in terms of cost appraisal are the case insulation, steering systems, and propellant and processing techniques. In conclusion, possible applica- tions for solid motors, either as prototype systems such as Titan III or intermediate type launch vehicles combining the solid booster first stage with a liquid fueled second stage for low earth orbit or lunar probes are outlined. 1969 SA E Transactions 690703. Large Launch Vehicles - Present and Future. William R. Lucas and Rondal G. Crawford, Marshall Space Flight Center, NASA. Large launch vehicle systems are examined in terms of design and operating characteristics and potential applica- tions. A brief history of the development of Saturn V is followed by a discussion of potential cost-saving simplifi- cations. Potentially attractive intermediate payload deriv- atives of Saturn V and the use of a nuclear third stage are considered along with potential missions. New concepts and technology discussed include low-cost expendable, partially reusable, and fully reusable systems in which the launch vehicle and spacecraft are integral. The need for, and desired characteristics of, a reusable "space shuttle" system are indicated and a brief description of alternate approaches to obtaining this system are presented. 690704. Apollo Spacecraft Propulsion Systems. Joseph G. Thibodaux, NASA Manned Spacecraft Center. The Apollo spacecraft has 50 rocket engines arranged in seven separate and independent systems. During a single mission there are approximately 100,000 rock engine firings. In order to accomplish a lunar landing, all of these engines and systems must work reliably. Redundant components and system backups capability are provided in the design. Backup operational modes are possible to return the crew safely at all times in the event a system failure causes a mission abort. These crew safety require- ments impose many unusual constraints which are not required in launch vehicle or unmanned propulsion system design and development. These requirements and how they affect system design and operation will be discussed and the systems' operational experience on Apollo 7, 8, 9, and 10 will be presented. 1969 SA E Transactions 690705. Survivability of Military VSTOL Transport Air- craft. A. H. Cooper, General Dynamics/Con- vair. Fixed-wing tactical military transports may suffer high loss rates from enemy antiaircraft fire while supporting forward area logistics bases. Future V/STOL transport aircraft have performance capabilities which may be exploited to improve survivability during forward area landing and takeoff. This paper examines the relative survivability associated with several typical flight patterns for each type of aircraft, including a random heading technique uniquely suited to V/STOL aircraft, and concludes that V/STOL aircraft can have significantly greater survivability than fixed wing aircraft. 690706. Design of Fighter Aircraft for Combat Surviva- bility. Dale B. Atkinson, Paul Blatt, Levelle Mahood and Donald W. Voyls, Wright- Patter- son AFB. Aircraft survivability niust be considered during prelim- inary design and during every succeeding phase of airplane subsystem and airframe construction. To en- hance survivability a minimization of vulnerability of critical systems and components must be designed and engineered into the aircraft system. Some areas wherein design application can reduce vulnerability of aircraft are crew protection as well as structural and fuel system components. Experience in southeast Asia indicates that many aircraft losses occur due to vulnerability of flight control systems to ground fire. This paper reviews in detail design parameters for hydraulic logic isolation elements, emergency flight control techniques, less flammable fluids, and integrated actuator packages which, together with redundancy and dispersion techniques, will increase the survivability potential to flight control systems. In conclusion, a systematic design procedure must be developed for all critical systems in the aircraft to assure 159</page><page sequence="95">690707-690715 160 that survivability is given prime consideration during the complete design cycle. 1969 SA E Transactions 690707. Survivability Design of Forward Air Control and Light Attack Aircraft. Richard J. Arnold, North American Rockwell Corp. Designing a high degree of survivability in a light combat aircraft presents a challenge to engineers because of the conflicting demands for simplicity, low weight and cost, and maximum protection. The North American Rockwell OV-10A Bronco is an example of a current program to provide original design survivability through reduction of the vulnerability of fuel, powerplant, flight control, and crew systems. This reduced vulnerability, combined with the ability to evade enemy ground fire, results in a high probability of survival in battlefield close support opera- tions. 690708. Survivability Considerations in the Design of Helicopters. Roland G. Bernier, Aberdeen Re- search and Development Center. Some of the main survivability considerations for heli- copter designers are reviewed. The military helicopter cannot escape bullet hits in performing its many assigned tasks; nor can it be protected from damage by armor like a tank. To survive means literally to continue to live in spite of damage, and this is the basic philosophy which must permeate every design aspect of the military helicopter. Every designer must consider bullets and other projectiles as part of the normal environment. There is no set method or limit to the challenge. 690709. Air Force System Safety Program. Howard S. Davis, USAF. The basic aim of the new Air Force safety program is to analyze each component and procedure of a system or modification of an existing system and then evaluate any imminent hazards. As a result, action will be taken to prevent the manufacture of any hazardous equipment. This approach will reduce any materiel deficiencies, including improper selection of materials or improper design of equipment. 690710. The NASA System Safety Program. R. Emerson Harris, NASA. The NASA System Safety Program, its implementation and supporting organizational structure are discussed. The program is related to overall safety activity and evolution of concepts, which were based on previously identified constraints. The concept of, "establishing the require- ments and then measuring the system safety program performance against those requirements" was described as the implementing technique. The results of the program are reviewed. 690711. System Safety-Commercial = Program Perspec- tive. Jack N. Funk and Richard B. Clarke, Boeing Co. Specific differences in requirements and philosophies of the design safety discipline which distinguish commercial from military aircraft programs are described. The military demands for quantum jumps in technology for its aircraft products are compared to the long-standing commercial requirements imposed by Federal Aviation Regulations and the constraints of a competitive market- place. The check and balance concept is defined for implementing a product safety program within the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. 690712. A Systems Approach to Flammability Control For Aerospace Safety Application. F. Y. Hayashi and N. R. Kiehlo, Autonetics Div., North American Rockwell Corp. The requirements for control of flammability and related hazards in materials and components used in aerospace avionics systems have been examined using a systems approach. Consideration has been given to a wide range of contributing factors, including acceptable risk, test meth- od, acceptability criteria, confidence level, and ignition source. 690713. Air Force Booster Growth Concepts. J. A. Saavedra, DCS/Res. &amp; Dev. Headquarters, U. S. Air Force. The current family of Air Force space launch vehicles, which has grown primarily from our series of ballistic missile programs, is described. Continuing evolutionary booster developments and improvements, in combination with space configured upper stages and strap-on rocket engines using solid fuels, have provided the Air Force with this versatile family of small, medium and large launch vehicles. Growth versions of these vehicles, attained through stage and component improvements, new combi- nations of stages, and application of advanced technology programs, are presented. These growth versions provide the Air Force with a number of options for increased launch vehicle capabilities in the 1970's. 690714. Apollo/Saturn V Launch Complex 39 Capa- bilities. Raymond J. Cerrato, John F. Kennedy Space Center, NASA. Launch Complex 39 (LC-39) located at the NASA John F. Kennedy Space Center is described. The physical characteristics, dimensions, capabilities, and limitations of all the LC-39 major components and other major facilities are described and depicted. The Apollo Saturn V processing flow (receipt of vehicle hardware through launch) including the "mobile concept," is described with particular emphasis on LC-39's high launch rate capability, economy of opera- tion, and superior flexibility. 690715. Saturn V For the '70's. J. W. Sandford, Space Div., North American Rockwell.; and J. E. Martin, Jr., Boeing Co. The Saturn V launch vehicle and its potential derivatives</page><page sequence="96">690718-690727 are the backbone of this nation's manned space program. In the past two years, this vehicle has progressed from development into its operational phase. This paper reviews the current status of the Saturn V and discusses its possible evolution and growth to meet the requirements of missions being postulated for the next ten years. These missions include extension of the Apollo lunar-landing program to permit more extensive manned exploration, launch of space station modules in support of an ultimate space base logistics support of early space stations, and unmanned missions to outer planets. Experience gained during operation of the Saturn V makes feasible substan- tial cost reductions in the prroduction, test, and launch operations of the vehicle. Potential methods leading to a low-cost Saturn V are also reviewed in this paper. 690718. Evaluating Philosophy in Launch Vehicle Pro- grams. E. W. Gomersa, Mission Analysis Div., NASA.; and J. W. Monroe, Space Div., Boeing Co. Analyses of economical orbital payload delivery systems generally indicate that the most fruitful areas for cost reduction lie within modified management, test, and operational philosophies. A recent study identifies the costs associated with processes, tests, operations, and other elements necessary to create, produce, and utilize a launch vehicle system under current philosophies. From this base, it is possible to examine the relative merits of alternatives to current management, test, and operational approaches. This paper discusses some of the issues and the facts involved, and deduces some potential methods for implementing cost-effectiveness in launch vehicle programs. 690719. Preparing and Selecting Engineering Supervisors. Robert D. Gray, California Institute of Tech- nology. The preparation and selection of an engineering super- visor can be achieved in an individual situation: an engineer and his supervisor. The native abilities, knowl- edge, and skills required to be an engineer provide a basis on which the added knowledge and skill required on an engineering supervisor can be superimposed, provided that the engineer has or can acquire the necessary interest in, and appropriate attitude toward, the job of supervising people and their work. A supervisor may give some specific work assignments to an engineer from which both may gain an indication of the engineer's interest or lack of interest in being a supervisor. The work experience will also help develop the knowledge and skills required of a supervisor. Higher management must provide an optimum "climate" including compensation, supervision, and com- munication to encourage the application of the engi- neering supervisor's knowledge and skill. 690722. Evaluating Progress in an Engineering Program. L. J. Adams and R. E. Dreith, Martin Marietta Corp. An evaluation process that has been used successfully on past programs to assess technical performance is de- scribed. The factors to be considered in selecting param- eters to be monitored, the assignment of responsibility to meet performance requirements, the methods of evalua- ting performance, the reporting systems, the methods of problem identification and resolution, and the outlook for future evaluation systems are discussed. 690724. Determination of the Influence of Propeller Thrust on CL and CD of an Airplane Using a Triple-Slotted Flap at Various Deflections. Har- lan D. Fowler, Burlingame, Calif. The influence of propeller slipstream on life and drag of deflected trailing edge flaps was previously described and applied to the Breguet 941 STOL. The method calculating transition velocities proved to be very accurate. Recently the Ames Research Center conducted tests of a four propeller model, a close replica of the Breguet, applying the same method and obtaining very accurate results. This paper gives detailed analysis of how the method can determine CL and CD under transition conditions. Design- ers of STOL aircraft where thrust approaches large values compared with gross weight will find the procedure useful. 1969 SA E Transactions 690725. Computer Planning With the Optical Image Terminal. L. P. Pipes, Lockheed Missile and Space Co.; and E. G. Perry, IBM. A new concept for remotely entering manufacturing planning data into a computer system is discussed. By standardizing planning operations and using "on line" questioning techniques, the volume of paper generated manually is reduced, time spans for original and change planning for fabricated parts is shortened, errors are decreased and subsequent engineering changes are im- plented faster. 690726. Design and Application of Four- Wheel-Drive AG Tractors. D. L. Christen, J. I. Case Co. Four-wheel-drive agricultural tractors are finding wide acceptance in the large tractor market. There are two basic design concepts, rigid frame and articulated, both of which have distinct advantages. At present the relatively low production volumes demand a modular design approach. The future will see a trend toward integrated components. There are seven manufacturers offering models that together cover the range of 100-220 drawbar hp. This paper presents a comparison of marketing and component features. 690727. Telemetry System for Data Acquisition From Test Vehicles. Ronald W. Orme, Garn F. Penfold and Kenneth R. Thomas, Engineering Res. Div., Deere &amp; Co. A 16-channel, 5-mile-range telemetry system has been constructed. This equipment can be easily adapted to a 161</page><page sequence="97">690728-690734 162 wide variety of vehicle measurement tasks. A modular signal conditioning concept has minimized the time required for initial setup on each measurement project. "Calibrating through" the system on all channels avoids some of the alignment pitfalls present in the day-to-day operation of a complex multichannel system. 690728. Silver/Zinc Battery Power for Deep Ocean Vehicles. G. W. Work and S. Fried, Yardney Electric Corp. The need for deep diving submersibles, the advantages of batteries located outside the hull as power sources and the place of silver/zinc batteries in this application are summarized. Environmental and operational factors which affect battery design and performance are discussed along with how the problems were overcome. State- of-the-art capabilities of silver/zinc deep ocean batteries are illustrated from data on several operational cells and batteries. It is concluded that this type of battery is suitable for deep ocean use and has the advantage of being already operational. 690729. Storable Fuel Cell Powerplants for Undersea Applications. Russell N. Edwards and Leonard J. Nuttall, General Electric Co. Storable powerplants are needed in many applications of submerged ocean systems. On the basis of cost effective- ness alone, it is shown that storable fuel cell powerplants for fixed and slowly moving mobile systems offer significant advantages over a range from 0.005 to 30 kW in the mission energy range from 0.01 to 100 megawatt-hr. Analysis of high pressure gaseous storage (compatible with deep submergence hulls) shows significant fuel storage volume advantages over storage of cryogenic hydrogen and oxygen. A unique hybrid fuel storage system, using LOX and high pressure hydrogen at LOX temperature shows reduced displacement, compared to both gaseous and pure cryogenic systems, for modest endurance periods. Long term storage involves substantial volume penalties for cryogenic reactants. High pressure gas storage may, however, be substantially excelled on a storage volume basis by solid reagents used to produce hydrogen and oxygen for the fuel cell as needed. Solid polymer electrolyte fuel cells have reached a high state of technology at which operating life times in excess of 10,000 hr may be expected with negligible deterioration of the cell performance. These thin membrane cells are direct descendents of the highly successful (although shorter lived) Gemini fuel cell system. The advanced membranes have been proven in 40 days of space flight with a bio-satellite mission and year long continuing testing on an advanced Air Force fuel cell program. The combina- tion of solid reagent fuel storage technology and these highly advanced fuel cell modules makes possible a cost effective, compact, and reliable storable fuel cell power- plant for marine applications. 690730. Hydrazine-Hydrogen Peroxide Fuel Cell System for Deep Submergence Vehicles. G. E. Rich, Lockheed Missiles &amp; Space Co. Present deep submersible power plants are limited in terms of on-board energy storage capacity. Of the planned advanced deep submersibles, the Deep Submergence Search Vehicle (DSSV) is an immediate and typical advanced power system application. This paper discusses DSSV power requirements and briefly outlines and compares the competing power system candidates. The pressure-balanced hydrazine-hydrogen peroxide fuel cell is identified as a leading competitor. A typical system approach is described, system design options identified, and system advantages cited. 690731. Stirling Engine for Underwater Vehicle Applica- tions. James N. Mattavi, F. Earl Heffner and Arpad A. Miklos, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. High efficiency, low noise level, and the ability to utilize unconventional energy sources make the Stirling engine a unique candidate for underwater applications. Basic descriptions of some current Stirling engines are presented along wih complete maps of performance data and other facts related to their underwater use with closed energy sources. Performance characteristics are predicted for powerplant systems combining Stirling engines with heat-storage and metal-combustion energy sources. 1969 SA E Transactions 690732. Rankíne-Cycle Powerplant with Boron Slurry Fuel. C. V. Burkland, CCI Aerospace Corp. A thermochemical powerplant for underwater applica- tions featuring a low-temperature Rankine-cycle power loop and a fuel consisting of elemental boron slurried in a water carrier is described. The special features of the boron slurry fuel that make it attractive for underwater applications are detailed and some exploratory test results shown. A typical application to a deep operating submer- sible is examined and comparisons made with battery and fuel cell power sources. 690733. Closed Brayton Power System for Deep Ocean Technology. Ray A. Rackley, AiResearch Manu- facturing Co. The chemically fueled closed Brayton-cycle power system is being evaluated for the United States Navy as an undersea source of electrical power. Two versions of this power system have been identified as particularily well suited to a typical 20,000 ft depth mission requiring 1000 kwhr of electrical energy. System schematics and detailed weight and volume summaries are presented. 690734. Some Control and Accessory Considerations for Turbine Engines - An Engine Manufacturer's Viewpoint. Bernard E. Erickson, Allison Div., GMC. The ever increasing turbine engine complexity dictates an</page><page sequence="98">690735-690740 increase in control and accessory complexity. Additional engine parameters must be monitored and controlled to assure proper engine operation. The guarantee of ex- tended life and reduced maintenance requirements cou- pled with the increased complexity require an almost perfect reliability in each subcomponent and in each component. Reduced maintenance will be obtained through condition monitoring. Integration of the engine- airframe control and the condition monitoring systems is mandatory if we are to attain our goals. Some future control and accessory considerations, such as improved utilization of existing components are briefly discussed. A prime area of concern and one requiring much work to attain our goal is in data conditioning. It is concluded that standardization and a tightly controlled sensor-transducer program will aid in achieving a totally integrated system. 690735. Accessory Considerations for Turbine Engines- User's Viewpoint. E. H. Toomey, American Airlines, Inc. Accessories are dealt with as parts of a whole and the contribution that each part makes to the success or failure of that whole. The view taken is that of a major airline as a typical user and it is intended to be from a vantage point that permits observation of a broad and complete picture. The scope of dealing with a multitude of accessories as individual units is portrayed through the use of typical operating statistics. The performance history and compo- sition of two "ordinary" systems - the lube and start systems - used on the current power plants are reviewed. They are used to emphasize the importance of under- standing the contribution that each item and accessory makes to the performance of the entire aircraft and the importance of system thinking. The importance of a system oriented effort, well integrated between the many organizations and companies involved in the design, development, test, and eventual use of each item is stressed. Finally an approach to achieving the above understandings and objectives is recommended, the focal point of which is a general specification for turbine engine propulsion systems. This general specification provides for centralization of responsibility for total system compat- ibility and requires endurance running of QEC with full nacelle and simulated loads, environments, etc. during the development program. 690736. High-Speed Transmission Shafts for Gas Tur- bine-Driven Remotely Mounted Accessories. Neal B. Rothfuss, The Bendix Corp. Remotely mounted gearboxes and complete auxiliary power systems, including hydraulic pumps, engine star- ters, and electric generators, may be driven from gas turbine engines through power transmission shafts that use material flexure to accomodate misalignments. Since the diaphragm type of flexible coupling does not require lubrication, it offers long life maintenance free operation, and long TBO's while operating at high speeds, high torque and ambient temperatures in excess of 800F. Many transmission shafts have an "on condition TBO; others range from 1500-3000 hr. Location of the accessory with respect to the engine is of major importance to the weight and complexity of the transmission shaft. Transmission of power over long distances can now be achieved by using supercritical shafts that employ simple hydraulic viscous dampers to control the dynamic response, even at each critical speed. 690737. Recent Developments in Pneumatic Starters for Jet Engines. Paul G. Stein, Hamilton Standard Division. Features of and improvements to the modern pneumatic starters used on turbojet engines for commercial and military aircraft are described. Containment material, improved gear material, windmilling reengagements, and the improved reliability of pneumatic starters are dis- cussed. 690738. Application of VSCF Generators for Gas Turbine Accessories. H. E. Porte, General Electric Co. An advancement in electrical power generation has been developed which improves the quality of power for airborne and ground-based electrical components. The improved power will allow electrical components to be designed smaller and lighter in weight. The accuracy of positioning devices and radar equipment is improved as a result of a more closely regulated frequency. The relia- bility and maintainability of the power equipment is higher than the equipment in use today because fewer moving parts are involved in converting the variable engine speed to a constant frequency electrical power. The equipment will require less maintenance, thus reducing downtime and the cost of ownership. The variable- speed-constant-frequency system has many advantages which puts it into a classification of an advanced electrical system. 690739. Some Controls and Accessories Design Appro- aches to Technical Requirements for Turbine Engines. George W. Barrett, General Electric Co. The development of aircraft and gas turbine powerplan ts has resulted in engine specifications and technical require- ments which are increasingly difficult for the engine controls and accessory design engineers to satisfy. The objective of this paper is to review the approaches being taken by the controls and accessory designers in an attempt to meet the challenges of engine control at minimum weight-long life with maximum reliability over a wide range of environmental conditions for future engines. 690740. A Critique of Turbine Accessories. J. E. Rich, Northern Natural Gas Co. Various problems that one company encountered with accessories on several different makes of gas-fired turbines are discussed. These turbines are used as prime movers 163</page><page sequence="99">690741-690747 164 driving centrifugal natural gas compressors on a pipeline transmission system. The accessories covered are: ignition system, lube oil cooler, tach generator, lube oil pumps, auxiliary gearbox, thermocouples, lubricators, inlet air filter, instrument air system, cab pressurization fan, and starter. 690741. Systems Concepts in Control Design for Indus- trial and Commercial Aviation Applications of Auxiliary Power Units. Frank J. Jandrasi, AiRe- search Manufacturing Co. of Arizona. In designing a system, the systems engineer must thoroughly understand the requirements, constraints, and values established by the customer, must plan and schedule a program to satisfy these conditions, while also considering cost, reliability, and maintainability. Using an APU system as an example, the author traces the development of a design for a control system. First the control system is evaluated as to require- ments, constraints, reliability, cost, and maintenance. A preliminary design is developed after conducting various studies, and a detail design implemented. Data obtained from system simulation aid in the development pattern of the control system. The development of the component and subsystem is also initiated, with the system develop- ment an extension of this work. The staffing and management of such a program are discussed. 690742. Direct Driven Gas Turbine Fuel Pumps. Charles W. Grennan and Evert von Moltke, Colt Indus- tries, Inc. The driving of fuel pumps by the gas turbine shaft is shown to offer potential savings in weight and size when the total accessory package and drive is considered. This is achieved by modifying standard pumping concepts in order to retain current performance and endurance characteristics. A review is presented showing the benefits of different pump concepts to engines of different power ratings. 690743. High Speed Pumps for Gas Turbine Engines. J. F. Murray, Borg-Warner Corp. Higher pump speeds and pressures with the consequent increase in output per pound is the surest way to meet the reduced pump weights required in future gas turbine engines. This paper discusses problems associated with operating pumps at engine shaft speeds or on drives independent of the engine. Mechanical and hydraulic problems related to different fluids, contamination, and minimization of fluid temperature rise are covered. In some recent engines, pumps have been operated successfully at higher speeds and pressures. Current pump speeds, however, are still far short of the smaller gas turbine shaft speeds. The paper covers the present state-of-the-art, current development programs, and a projection of future devel- opments toward higher pump speeds. 690744. Aircraft Hydraulic Pumps for High-Speed Opera- tion. R. P. Lambeck, Sperry Rand Corp. An increase in pump drive speeds is desirable in order to minimize pump size and weight. This paper reviews the relationship between pump speed and power loss, as well as some of the mechanical limitations encountered at higher speeds. It also discusses the trade-offs available involving weight, performance and life. The effects of temperature and fluid selection are included. 690745. Development of Mitsubishi DC2 Series V-Type Diesel Engines. Kenji Okamura and Koji Yama- da, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. Some research and development studies concerning Mitsubishi DC2 diesel engines are described. The engines are of 90-deg V type newly designed, for trucks or buses of more than 14 tons (30,900 lb) gross weight, after exhaustive fundamental researches and many years' experience. The series covers 6-, 8-, and 12-cyl engines of the water-cooled, precombustion-chamber type with a 130- mm (5.12 in.) and a 125-mm (4.92 in.) stroke. The engines are capable of developing a maximum output of 200-400 ps (197.5 - 395 hp) and combine high reliability with compact and light-weight construction. Naturally the use of common parts among these engines in series facilitates their parts' supply and maintenance. In addition to the naturally aspirated engines, turbocharged 8- and 12-cyl engines are available. 690746. Experience and Development of Turbocharged Diesel Engines in Scandinavia. Bertil Häggh and Ernst Holmer, Volvo AB. Swedish-manufactured turbocharged diesel engines for trucks and buses have gained considerable ground, particularly in Scandinavia. This is in contrast to other European countries, where the manufacturing of a smaller series of turbocharged engines has begun only recently. A short description of markets, engine types, and production is followed by a brief description of a turbocharged diesel engine and some of the experiences which lie behind it. Expected development within the truck engine field is also dealt with, especially in regard to turbocharged engines with low compression ratio. 690747. High Pressure Turbocharging of Two-Stroke Engines. S. G. Timoney, University College Dublin. An experimental program shows effects of various air charging system characteristics on performance of a highly turbocharged 2-stroke-cycle engine. The advan- tages displayed by a variable-speed blower drive led to the conception and development of a hydraulic auxiliary energy system to supplement power supplied to the turbocharger by exhaust gas. This system uses a small Pelton-wheel-type turbine, mounted on the turbocharger shaft and supplied with lubricating oil at high pressure from a pump located in the</page><page sequence="100">690748-690755 engine sump. Results from this system are good and allow flexible torque characteristics to be attained in an engine. 1 969 SA E Transactions 690748. Why Multicylinder Motorcycle Engines? W. Krautter, Krautter Engineering. As is demonstrated by means of equations, the subdivision of a certain displacement into larger numbers of smaller cylinders brings about a substantial increase in power - at this time more than twice that of single cylinder engines. Values of highly developed motorcycle competition engines are compared with these theoretical results and an amazingly high degree of agreement exists. These laws are not limited to motorcycle engines, but may be used for other applications also. 690749. Oil-Cooled Aluminum Alloy Diesel Engine Pis- tons - A New Approach. D. A. Law and R. A. Day, Wellworthy, Ltd. The constant demand by engine builders for increased brake mean effective pressure has made piston and ring temperature a serious limiting feature of engine develop- ment. The various methods previously employed to cool the piston are contrasted with the new approach of coring the oil-cooling passages by means of a water-soluble core. The development by Wellwortthy of three practical foundry techniques embodying this principle which also permits the use of armored top grooves is described, with typical examples of such pistons. The effects of cooling in terms of piston temperature distribution are shown. The technique so far covers pistons 3 to 10 in. in diameter, and is fully patented. Discussion: D. P.

The need for a compact piston arrangement is discussed, along with the steps followed to arrive at excellent oil economy. The paper presents other advantages related to cost savings, lower wear, and reduced engine friction. The paper discusses applications of the compact piston package along with its advantages in designing compact engines.

Law, Wellworthy, Ltd. This paper describes a cylinder plateau bore finish derived from a production process. The resulting surface is clean and free from ragged honing lines. Consistency in production is achieved as a result of the nonsensitivity of the process. Details of honing stocks, production process, control capability, and engine test results are discussed. Bore areas have been analyzed by viewing "Stereo- scan" shots of the honed surface. 690752. Power Part Parameters Affecting Lube Oil Consumption and Blowby in Small Bore, High Speed Diesels. Small Bore, High Speed Diesles. and Carl S. Weinberger, Koppers Co., Inc. Ten series of fractional factorial tests for oil consumption on nine small bore, high speed diesel engines have revealed favorable factors for top, intermediate, and oil rings, pistons, and liners that may be used in the initial design of a diesel engine. Blowby is much less affected by these factors, and so the factors may be chosen for oil control with but little penalty to blowby control. An enormous amount of additional work is necessary to refine further the parameters tested and to investigate new paramenters. 690753. New Developments in Piston Rings for High BMEP Engines. H. F. Prasse, H. E. McCormick and R. D. Anderson, TRW, Inc. Unpublished data on physical properties and bond strength of heavy-duty piston-ring facing materials inclu- ding the now used chromium and molybdenum are presented. Data on the new RC-1, RC-2, chromecarbide moly, and the new "moly-over" facings are provided, and low friction coatings are discussed. Engine test results on scuff and abrasive wear and performance in high-bmep diesel engines are reported. 690754. Development of Piston-Ring Coatings. William L. Brown, Dana Corp. The procedure used at Perfect Circle to determine coating application parameters is outlined, and coating quality and coating performance are evaluated for new piston- ring coatings. It includes descriptions of bench tests, procedures for measurement of physical properties, and descriptions of test techniques. The paper outlines a sound engineering approach to developing and evaluating wear coatings for piston rings which can be extended to other coating applications. 690755. Noise Reduction Techniques as They Apply to Engine-Generator Design and Treatment. Robert H. Pish and Roy W. Hu, Southwest Research Institute. Small engines may require soundproofing to eliminate one or more of the following effects: hearing loss, speech interference, community annoyance, detectability, and psychological disorientation. Detectability criteria are frequently associated with military applications and may require the use of a soundproof enclosure in addition to other engine treatments. Acoustical noise sources are conveniently classed as either aerodynamic or mechanical. Aerodynamic sources are predominant on small engines. Treatment of exhaust 165</page><page sequence="101">690756-690760 166 noise by individual components, e.g., muffler, is inade- quate; a system approach, through the use of an electro-acoustic analog computer, has proved to be a much more satisfactory procedure. To develop a soundproof enclosure for a 0.3-kw military engine-generator set several control techniques were required; (l)the enclosure had to be decoupled from the engine, (2)the panel structures had to have a high transmission loss (achieved through the careful selection of damping material), (3)cooling air inlet ducts and exhaust gas outlet ducts had to be properly treated to minimize noise conduction. The degree of noise reduction attainable was limited by specifications for size, weight, engine cooling at high ambient temperatures, and engine accessibility for starting and fueling. 690756. Periodic Noise in Bearings. T. A. Bailas, Timken Roller Bearing Co. In general, noise within an antifriction bearing can be classified as coming from random and periodic sources. The most annoying and preventable come from periodic causes, for example, a nick on a bearing raceway due to handling damage during assembly. As an aid in detecting such periodic sources in a tapered roller bearing, formulae are provided which determine the rate of contact for a specific point on one of the raceway surfaces, that is, cup, cone or roller. Some experimental evidence demonstrating the worth of such an approach is included. 690757. Development of a High-Speed Dynamometer and Preliminary Results Obtained from a C.A.V.01 Turbine. J. M. Adgey, A. B. Birks and G. P. Blair, Queens University of Belfast. Modern turbocharged diesel engines employ exhaust- driven turboblowers operating at high speeds up to 100,000 rpm. The performance assessment of such units demands precise and controllable power absorption and torque measurements at these very high rotational speeds. Speed, mass flow, static and dynamic pressures and temperatures must also be measured. The turbine power absorption and torque measurement present unique problems. The remaining parameters may present some difficulties but generally the problems are not so great. The design of a high-speed dynamometer and the development problems encountered are described. The dynamometer has been used to establish the performance characteristics of a C.A.V.01 turbocharger and these are reported. 690758. Induction System Deposit Technique for Motor Gasolines - Procedure and Utilization. A. A. Johnston and L. L. Stavinoha, Southwest Re- search Institute. The tendency of motor gasolines to form deposits on the intake valve and port surfaces of spark-ignition engines can be evaluated by a bench apparatus developed for the U.S. Army. The apparatus consists of a carbureted fuel-air system which sprays the test fluid on a heated deposit collecting tube at the rate of 2.0 ml/min rate. Combat gasoline (MIL-G-3056C), commercial (or VV-G-76) gaso- lines, and special solvents were evaluated, using a sample volume of 150 ml and the results obtained by this technique correlated with data obtained during a military vehicle fleet test are described. The procedure has also been used to study effects of gasoline additives, storage conditions, and storage duration on fuel degradation, and as an aid in the development of deterioration predictive tests. The results of a detailed procedure and round-robin tests of reproducibility initiated at Army petroleum testing laboratories within the United States are provided. 690759. Exhaust Emission Control Systems and Vapor Lock - CRC Road Tests. J. L. Keller, Union Oil Co. of Calif.; H. T. Niles, Ford Motor Co.; and H. A. Bigley, Jr., Gulf Res. and Dev. Co. Results of a series of vapor-lock road tests on 26 cars (1966 models), half of which were equipped with exhaust emission control systems, are presented. The objectives of the tests were to determine the effect of emission controls on vapor-locking tendencies, to study effects of fuel volatility and operating conditions on fuel system temper- atures, and to study correlation of these temperatures with temperature versus vapor/liquid ratio characteristics of fuels. The data obtained show no significant difference in vapor-locking tendency between the emission control equipped and nonequipped cars as groups, though significant differences are shown for some individual car pairs. An analysis is presented of the relation between fuel volatility, pump temperature during acceleration, and the onset of vapor lock. Discussion: Charles L.

Ward, Bartlesville Petroleum Research Center. A test procedure and correlations were developed for predicting the amounts of gum and lead precipitate that will form in a gasoline during storage for periods up to 32 weeks at 1 10 F. The amounts of gum and lead precipitate formed in 24 commercial and military gasolines during a 16-hr oven test at 200 F were compared with the amounts formed in the same gasolines stored at 1 10 F and analyzed following 8-, 16-, and 32-week storage periods. A direct relationship was found between the amounts of lead precipitate formed during the oven test and those formed during long-term storage. The gum relationship, however, needed adjusting in proportion to the amount of oxygen consumed in the gum-forming reaction. The storage performance of gasoline at temperatures below 110 F for periods as long as 5 years can be estimated with a modified Arrhenius equation which is presented.</page><page sequence="102">690761-690767 690761. Effect of Motor Vehicle Safety Standards on Manufacturers of Incomplete Vehicles. John Thomas, International Harvester Co. The National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 imposed new responsibilities on manufacturers of commercial motor vehicles, on truck body and equipment manufacturers and on dealers and distributors who offer these vehicles or equipment for resale. Applicable Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards are charted and respon- sibility for compliance and certification as divided between the original vehicle manufacturer and subsequent dealers and distributors is discussed. 690762.

Emission Control For Gasoline-Powered Heavy- Duty Vehicles. F. D. Griffith, International Harvester Co. Development of emission control systems for a complete line of heavy-truck gasoline engines is presented. Ex- perience gained in emission control programs for engines used in light-duty vehicles proved beneficial in estab- lishing basic guidelines for heavy-truck program. Various engine modifications, primarily concerned with induction systems and conbustion chambers, pro- vided sufficient emission reduction to meet 1969 Califor- nia and 1970 Federal standards. Secondary air injection into exhaust was not required. Durability tests required for certification indicated the necessity of adhering to recommended service procedures to maintain low emis- sion levels. 690764. Exhaust Emissions from Heavy-Duty Vehicles. Robert W. Olsen, U. S. Dept. of Health, Education, and Welfare.; and Karl J. Springer, Southwest Research Institute. Exhaust emissions from heavy-duty gasoline-powered vehicles have been studied in detail, under National Air Pollution Control Administration support, at Southwest Research Institute. The principal exhaust emissions studied were carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and oxides of nitrogen. A broad variety of vehicles was tested with three variable-speed experimental procedures using chas- sis dynamometers to simulate actual road operations. Approximately 150 trucks and buses of all weight classes were investigated to determine the ability of each vehicle to perform with the respective experimental cycle, each vehicle's contribution of contaminants on a mass basis per mile driven, and the applicability of these cyclic test procedures for federal testing. 690765. Present and Future Emission Standards for Heavy-Duty Vehicles. John A. Maga and G. C. Hass, California State Air Resources Board. From the initial motor vehicle emission standards that pertained only to exhaust of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide, the California laws have gradually expanded control of all types of pollution from automobiles. Whereas pioneer legislation applied to all types of vehicles, significant changes in the laws not set up separate standards for light and heavy duty vehicles and for engines using gasoline and diesel fuels. This paper reviews the history and status of present California and federal emissions standards for heavy duty vehicles and discusses possible future development in this particular vehicle class. 690766. Vehicle Equipment Installation for Best Ride Match. T. E. Kashmerick, Chevrolet Motor Div., General Motors Corp. Tremendously improved materials, finishes, installation and "sealed-for-life" components are already available for trucks, with many more on the way. Vehicle manufac- turing costs have gone up proportionately, not only to provide these improvements, but also to satisfy Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards which require greater safety and reliability. The questions come up as to whether proper maintenance is being universally adopted and possibly enforced by vehicle inspection, and whether the use for which the vehicle was intended is met by proper and careful selection and installation of bodies, operating equipment, application of vehicle to vocation and driver comfort. It is this area of adapting vehicle bodies, utility equipment and operational components that is discussed in this paper. Some of the more obvious areas of component selection which affect vehicle ride, handling and durability and which will be discussed herein include: 1. Single unit body application to single and tandem drive-axle vehicles. 2. Utility body application problems. 3. Liquid body operational effects on vehicle perfor- mance. 4. Single and tandem drive axle vehicles for highway tractor application and attendant fifth wheel location problems. 5. Vehicle adaptability to interstate fleet operational problems (bridge formula states vs. short overall length and maximum load problems). 6. Highway seams and related cycling problems. 7. Tire and wheel effects. 8. Related frame stiffness (bending and torsional). 1969 SA E Transactions 690767. Engine Oils and Engine Durability. P. A. Ben- nett, Res. Labs., General Motors Corp.

Engine and Transmission Lubricant Viscosity Effects on Low Temperature Cranking and Star- ting. M. L. Haviland, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Engine oil and automatic transmission fluid viscosities are major factors in assuring good starting and running performance in cold weather. To determine the contri- butions of the engine and transmission to the cranking and running effort, instantaneous torque and power, obtained with an instrumented engine-transmission appar- atus, were determined for five engine oils ranging in viscosity from 4 to 184 poise (SAE 5 W to SAE 20 W) and for four transmission fluids ranging in viscosity from 3200 to 83,000 cp at -20 F. Specific engine and transmission cranking variables - engine friction, compression and expansion, engine rotational inertia, and transmission friction and rotational inertia - were analyzed in detail. The engine required most of the cranking effort, which increased with increasing engine oil viscosity. Increasing engine oil viscosity increased engine friction torque but decreased engine friction power because of decreased cranking speed. Net cylinder torque input to the cylinder air, a result of compressing and expanding air in the cylinder, decreased with decreasing cranking speed. Both engine and transmission inertia could be neglected for most cranking conditions. A thermodynamic analysis of the cranking process revealed that cranking speeds should be high for good starting because heat losses from the cylinder gases are low and cylinder gas pressures and temperatures are high. A crankability factor, defined as the ratio of instantan- eous engine friction torque to cranking speed, indicated that engine crankability deteriorated drastically as engine oil viscosity increased above about 30 poise and starter motor stall was being approached. Results obtained with the engine-transmission appar- atus were corroborated by results obtained in car tests. In general, starting and running improved as the engine oil and transmission fluid viscosity were lowered. Trans- mission performance was unsatisfactory with fluid viscos- ities greater than 30,000 cp, as a result of inadequate fluid flow. Because of engine stall, a transmission fluid viscosity less than 3200 cp is desirable for low temperature running.

Stewart and C. R. Spohn, Gulf Research and Development Co. A reciprocating viscometer which was used for deter- mining cold-cranking properties of engine oils was modified so it could be used to predict low-speed, hot-cranking properties of crankcase oils in full-scale engines. Since the current 210 F ASTM D 445 viscosities of multigrade oils fail to predict their hot-cranking properties, there is need for such a unit. A high degree of correlation was obtained between the 210 F viscosities determined with the modified reciprocating viscometer and those determined using a full-scale test engine for a group of V.l. improved oils and a group of commercial premium multigrade crankcase oils. The correlation obtained between the two units for a group of 5W oils containing oiliness agents indicates the viscometer to be satisfactory for screening tests. In general, this viscometer can satisfactorily predict low-speed, hot-cranking prop- erties of oils in full-scale engines quickly and economic- ally. Discussion: J. M. Wakim; Shell Canada Ltd.; W. A.

Oilwell servicing techniques have caused the evolution of specialized vehicles to meet operational requirements. Present designs are not adequate by either performance or economic standards to meet today's service. Future vehicle design parameters will necessitate a different approach by the vehicle manufacturers to satisfy an increasing domestic and foreign market. The purpose of this paper is to present some of the limitations of present equipment and suggest requirements to be considered in future design. 690772.

Wear Phenomena of Chromium Plated Rings as Revealed by Radioactive Tracers. W. C. Pike, R. F. Pywe and S. G. Rudston, British Petroleum Co., Ltd. Chromium wear phenomena of three types have been investigated using a continuous radio-tracing technique in single-cylinder engines. The dependence of wear on load at high wall pressures was studied in a gasoline engine using taper faced rings. It was confirmed in a laboratory diesel engine that ring wear was primarily corrosive. Techniques were developed for the rapid assessment of lubricating oils and additives and some detailed examinations of effects of additives and their concentration have been made. Finally, ring scuffing in the gasoline engine was promoted by thermal distortion. 1969 SAE Transactions</page><page sequence="104">690774-690781 690774. Effects of Motor Oil Composition on Engine Wear. W. E. Waddey and A. F. Pearce, Esso Research and Engineering Co. A taxicab test was conducted to determine the effect of crankcase oil composition on engine wear. It was found that detergent-inhibitor treat, antiwear additive level, viscosity and V.l. improver type all affected wear in one or several engine areas. Moreover, it was shown that with an optimum balance of components, multigrade oils can be designed which are as effective in controlling wear as single-grade oils. 690775. Bench Test for the Evaluation of Silver-Steel Lubrication Properties of Railroad Diesel Oils. B. W. Turnquest, P. G. Culliney, R. J. Danehy and R. D. Fullman, Atlantic Richfield Co. A pin and disc machine has been modified for the evaluation of silver-steel lubrication characteristics of railroad diesel oils. Use of silver pins on polished steel discs at selected loads and rubbing speeds allows good correlation with known engine behavior. In comparison with wear and friction data obtained by the four ball method, this pin and disc test gives better correlation with engine tests than the modified 4-ball test. 690776. Spectrometric Analysis of Used Oils. L. L. Stavinoha and B. R. Wright, Southwest Re- search Institute. The techniques and diagnostic significance of atomic absorption, atomic emission, and infrared spectrometric analysis of crankcase lubricants are discussed with the use of supplementary data where pertinent. The parameters affecting used oil analytical data are discussed in terms of examples from Army general-purpose vehicle test engines. Wear metals in used gear oils are also discussed and examples are given. Analytic methods and their applica- tions are fully described, and the equipment and proce- dures for infrared spectroscopy and gas chromatography techniques are outlined. 690777. Lubrication of Teflon. Robert Bee Lewis, E. I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co., Inc. The outstanding dry friction characteristics of Teflon TFE can be imparted to a variety of filled and reinforced compositions, many of which offer superior unlubricated wear performance. A logical extension is the application of filled TFE as marginally lubricated or thin film lubricated bearings. Under conditions of very thin film lubrication, some filled compositions of Teflon out- perform conventional materials, such as babbitt and bronze. Guidelines for using filled compositions of Teflon with water lubrication are explored. Comparative test results are examined in light of theoretical relationships between thin film lubricated friction and wear perfor- mance. 690778. Lubricant Effects on Rear Axle Tapered Roller Bearing Wear. Ralph McClintock, Research Labs., General Motors Corp. Rear-axle tapered roller bearing wear has been studied in bench and car tests, using both commercial and ex- perimental gear lubricants. In bench tests, magnitude of wear was affected by both lubricant additive treatment and lubricant viscosity; increased wear resulted from reduction in viscosity with lead soap-active sulfur and Pb-S-Cl lubricants but not with P-S and Zn-P-S-Cl lubricants. Substantial decreases in wear from one bearing lot to subsequent lots apparently resulted from mechan- ical improvement in the bearing manufacturing technique. These wear decreases, for a given bearing speed and load combination, were accompanied by decreased tempera- ture annd thickness of roller-end surface film formed from the lubricants. In rear axle car tests run as far as 94,000 miles, P-S additive package blends having viscosities as low as 4 cs at 210 F performed satisfactorily, although bearing wear was somewhat greater than that with P-S blends having viscosities of 9 cs at 210 F.

(SP-350) Automated Engine Testing of Motor Oils. S. E. Shields, W. M. Herring and E. J. Bourne, American Oil Co. Computerized automation has been designed and installed on two laboratory engine stands in a pilot project aimed at improving repeatability and efficiency of motor oil testing via ASTM MS Sequence VB. Although testing experience is limited, practicality of operating the stands auto- matically has been confirmed; compliance with test specifications has been tightened; and potentials for reducing operating and clerical support have been demon- strated. Impact on improving repeatability of engine deposits is still inconclusive. The computer-aided capabil- ities are proving highly useful in evaluating the adequacy of the test itself. 690783. (SP-350) Computerized Data System for an Engine Test Laboratory. Robert A. Otcasek, The Lubrizol Corp. Accurate and timely recording of data is essential for the operation of an engine testing laboratory. A computerized automatic data acquisition system is described in detail. It is pointed out that setting up specifications and modes of operation for a system such as this are best arrived at by mutual discussions between the purchaser and supplier after the purchaser has gained a basic understanding of the operation and limitations of the equipment he is going to buy. System functions, operations, hardware, software, measurement methods, etc., are described. Measurement problems with solutions to these problems, along with operational experiences, use factor, operator acceptance and training for a 1 1/2-year period are presented. A closed-loop system for automatically controlling the speed of an engine is illustrated. 690784. (SP-350) Engine Dynamometer Test Stand Auto- mation for Motor Oil Performance Evaluation. J. R. Griffin, Chevron Research Co. Laboratory engine testing for motor oil performance evaluation is a major element of the total cost of motor oil development. Rising test costs and more exacting perfor- mance requirements led to the introduction of automated equipment to achieve operational simplicity, better data, and lower costs. This paper describes the design and construction of an automated test stand which provides mechanical and operational reliability at lower cost. 690785. (SP-350) Automatic Sequence Control of the Ford 5B Test. J. J. Gile and R. C. Hercules, Monsanto Co. The application of an automatic control system to the Ford MS sequence 5B test is described. A sequence timer and pneumatic controllers are used to accomplish more than 100 changes in engine speed, load, and temperatures throughout the 192 hr of test. Flexibility of the system, its cost, and maintenance are also discussed. 690786. (SP-351) Six- and Eight-Bolt Power Take-Offs. S. J. Haydock, Dana Corp. This paper presents various types of power take-off available today. Factors to be considered in selecting a good transmission and pto combination are pointed out. Particular attention is paid to the most common pto used in mobile equipment, the SAE 6 and 8 bolt version. Physical construction, mounting to the transmission, shifting, bearings, gears, capacity and controls are exam- ined. Engine speed range and the pitch-line velocity method of evaluating transmissions offer a way of judging performance. 1969 SAE Transactions 690787. (SP-351) Split-Shaft Power Take-Offs. L. J. Moyer, Dana Corp. Now available is a split-shaft power take-off that is capable of handling the accessory that requires up to 10,000 lb-ft of torque from a single output shaft. This new model employs extra-heavy-duty roller bearings in the input shaft, as well as in the output shaft. It requires less than 17 in. from front to rear and is especially good for installation in short coupled vehicles. It delivers the same rotation as the driveline or engine rotation and will have a wide variety of flange and yoke sizes to accommodate most propeller shaft manufacturers. 1969 SAE Transactions 690788. (SP-351) Front Power Take-Off Systems for Truck Engines. William H. Buelow and Earl C. Thayer, Rex Chainbelt, Inc. Four of the most widely used power take-off systems that take power from the front of a truck engine are described. Speed considerations, system power potential, power consumed and typical applications are covered. The systems discussed are hydrostatic systems, hydraulic systems, mechanical "drive" systems, and direct driven equipment. 1969 SAE Transactions 690789. (SP-351) Power Take-Offs from Transfer Cases. R. W. Cole, North American Rockwell Corp. The chief characteristics of various power take-off- equipped transfer cases and methods of adapting the power-take-off output to vehicle auxiliary mechanisms are described. Direct full torque power-take-off and indirect limited torque power-take-off are compared in relation to shaft connection and types of bearings, and lubrication. The transfer case power-take-off can have many efficient applications as a means of supplying extra engine power outlets in vehicles that require transfer cases. 1969 SAE Transactions 690790.

(SP-351) Belt-Driven Hydraulic Pumps. Berry E. Sanders, Tyrone Hydraulics, Inc. Application of hydraulic pumps, which are driven through belts and electric clutches and applied in the engine compartment of highway-type trucks is discussed. 1969 SA E Transactions 690793. (SP-351) Air-Driven Hydraulic Pumps. Richard Chaltry, Applied Power Industries, Inc. There is a growing demand today for design improvement in the operation of auxiliary functions on both off- highway and on-highway mobile type equipment. Faster, more efficient operation, better control, and less operator fatigue were the design goals considered in the design of the new air-driven hydraulic pump described in this article. Using the available pneumatic power source already incorporated in the design of most vehicles today, this efficient, light-weight, low-cost, high-cycling speed intensifier is limited in its application only by the imagination of the vehicle designer. 1969 SA E Transactions 690794. (SP-351) Exhaust Gas Energy as a Power Source for Conveying with Compressed Air. W. E. Woollenweber and J. R. Harper, Wallace- Murray Corp. The 3TC Turboconveyor provides a simple, low-cost source of compressed air for the unloading of bulk commodities and is the first unit specifically designed to accommodate all conditions peculiar to pneumatic con- veying operations utilizing the exhaust gases of the diesel engine as a source of power.

(P-28) Significant Trends in Human Factors Research on Motor Vehicle Accidents. Ross A. McFarland, Harvard School of Public Health. The number of fatalities and injuries from all types of motor vehicle accidents have been increasing throughout the world. This paper analyzes these statistics in an effort to find the causes of this high accident rate and to suggest possible solutions. Among the findings are: the number of people injured is increasing more rapidly than fatalities; the greatest percentage of fatalities occurs in the teenage and young adult age bracket with males predominating; alcohol is a dominating cause of many accidents; the personal and emotional maladjustment of the driver is a contributing factor; those related to old age, disease, and illness of drivers need to be more carefully studied and criteria for disqualification established. Possible solutions include: improved driver training; improved highway design, especially with regard to lighting; improved vehicular design. The author feels the latter is most important as it seems unlikely that driving habits can be radically improved. 690796. (P-28) Advances in Understanding of Experimen- tal Concussion Mechanisms. V. R. Hodgson, L. M. Thomas, E. S. Gurdjian, O. U. Fernando, S. W. Greenberg and J. L. Chason, Wayne State University. This paper is an in-depth study of the mechanism of concussion. Prior to 1967, concussion experiments were conducted exclusively on dogs, but after results of trials on dogs, cats, and stumptail monkeys, the authors concentrated on the latter. Varying numbers of blows, from different angles, were delivered to 12 monkeys. Results, both organic and behavioral, are discussed. 690797. (P-28) Protection of Car Occupants Against Side Impacts. R. D. Lister and I. D. Neilson, Road Research Lab., England. The different types of side impact, the consequential injuries and their relative frequencies, are given from the results of crash injury studies in the United Kingdom. The nature of the injuries sustained are considered in relation to the damage to the car in discussing the mechanism of these injuries. A simple theoretical representation shows that the relative velocity of the car occupant to the inside of the car is the most important feature in side impact accidents. One-fifth of the occupants were injured by intrusion of the side of the car, crushing them against some part of the interior. The location and effect of strengthening car sides and its possible interaction with the striking vehicle are discussed. 1969 SA E Transactions 690798. (P-28) Comparative Evaluation of Dummy Perfor- mance Under -Gx Impact. Richard F. Chandler and Robert A. Christian, National Bureau of Standards. Comparative evaluations of a variety of anthropomorphic dummies undertaken by the Office of Vehicle Systems Research at the National Bureau of Standards indicates a wide range of dummy performance. Dynamic tests, which were conducted on the NBS Dynamic Seat Belt Tester, 171</page><page sequence="107">690799-690803 172 simulated an impact environment with the dummies restrained by lap belt alone, or combined lap and torso diagonal belts of the type used in American automobiles. A variety of dummies, varying in construction from the most rudimentary to the most sophisticated, was tested. Test parameters included variations in impact velocity and acceleration. Each dummy was tested with both types of restraints, and sufficient tests were made to demon- strate the ability of the dummy to reproduce its reaction performance. These tests indicate that even when dummies are subjected to carefully controlled impacts with skilled technical personnel following identical procedures, it is difficult to reproduce test results. Techniques which were used to control dummy performance and modifications which were incorporated to improve reliability of the dummies are discussed. 690799. (P-28) Laboratory Studies on Laminated Safety Glass and Installations on Performance. R. G. Rieser and J. Chabal, PPG Industries, Inc. This paper is part of an extension of the laboratory studies reported at the Eleventh Stapp Car Crash Conference. The impact performance of laminated safety glass relative to penetration resistance, concussive hazard and lacerative damage has been expanded to additional laminated glass structures and installations at 45 and 90 deg impact angles. Severity Index values for a number of laminated panels have been obtained using a modified 22 lb head form that provides proper alignment of the internally mounted accelerometer with the test panel in free-fall impact studies. The effect of windshield installation on mean penetra- tion velocity, laceration, and Severity Index in full scale laboratory testing is presented for rubber channel and adhesive mounting systems. 1969 SA E Transactions 690800. (P-28) Biomechanical Analysis of Knee Impact. F. W. Cooke, Res. Labs., Franklin Institute.; and D. A. Nagel, Stanford University School of Medicine. This program of investigation was conducted to determine the nature and magnitude of the physical parameters which most significantly affect the degree of trauma produced by impact to the knee. Drop weight testing of unembalmed cadaver limbs utilizing a load cell to record forces and high-speed motion pictures to follow the kinematics of impact were the experimental techniques used. The principal results were: 1. Movement of the leg and deflection of the blow are very significant in reducing the energy absorbed by the knee and hence the trauma produced. 2. The severity of trauma produced depends on both the impact energy absorbed and the peak force generated. As the impact energy absorbed increases the tolerable peak forces drop. Finally, consideration is given to the application of these results to improving transportation safety and to methods for evaluating such improvements. 1969 SA E Transactions 690801. (P-28) Evaluating Knee-to-instrument Panel Im- pacts. Richard A. Wilson, Safety Res. &amp; Dev. Lab., General Motors Proving Ground. Independent accident investigators tend to agree that knee impacts to current production instrument panels are not a serious injury-producing event. This paper begins by presenting the status of lower-limb injuries in field accidents. A second phase presents the design background of a GM-developed laboratory machine for knee impact area testing. The biomechanic considerations of the device are discussed. Its design, instrumentation, and operation are presented. A subsequent portion of the paper treats the selection of a responsible impact speed for testing. Full-scale sled runs were made with driver and passenger dummies, both lap-belted and unrestrained, to determine the actual relationship between the initial knee-to-panel space and the resulting impact speed. 1969 SA E Transactions 690802. (P-28) Effectiveness of Safety Devices on Col- lision Consequences: A Fundamental Study. J. Hamon, Automobiles Peugeot, Paris Engin- eering Center. Statistics on road accidents indicate that most crashes occur at relatively low speeds and that the number of vehicles involved is smaller as the speed increases. A mathematical model is herewith presented to establish basic factors from which, with a given safety device, the degree of injury to a passenger can be predicted and held down to a predetermined level. A mathematical model of the crash characteristics of the vehicle and of a schematic 2-dimensional occupant will give figures to be compared to those obtained experimentally in a vehicle crash with 3-point safety belts. A comparison will then be made of the severity of impact at passenger level for different models of cars and for various restraining devices. 690803. (P-28) Correlation Between Windshield Head Injuries and Laboratory Tests - Part I: Feasibility of Relating Headform Impacts to Clinical Head Injuries. Leonard M. Cook and Raymond G. Rieser, PPG Industries, Inc.; and Arnold W. Siegel and Alan M. Nahum, University of California, Los Angeles. By duplication of glass fracture patterns, the feasibility of relating 22 lb headform impacts to head injuries sustained by occupants contacting the windshield in crashed vehicles has been established. For each suitable windshield sample selected from available 1966 to 1969 crashed automobiles, a vehicle analysis was performed. The unbroken sections of 33 selected windshields were subjected to dynamic loads</page><page sequence="108">690804-690809 using the 22 lb portable headform. This portable device mounted in a van is described. At impact, the deceleration and velocity were measured and lacerations rated on the basis of damage to simulated tissue and moist chamois. Achievement of duplication between headform and occupant head impacts permits a numerical assessment of windshield lacerative injuries and presents a tentative method for future programs involving correlation between laboratory and service performance. 690804. (P-28) Vehicle Rollover Dynamics Prediction by Mathematical Model. J. E. Ford and J. E. Thompson, Chrysler Corp. Improving occupant survivability during a rollover acci- dent requires a detailed analysis of the dynamics and statistical significance of a particular rollover situation as well as the structural performance of the vehicle involved. A two-dimensional model describing vehicle rollover has been developed which, in conjunction with a proposed index of performance, allows such an evaluation. Dy- namic equations of motion for ground contact and airborne travel are used in the model which is program- med for solution on a digital computer. The model is validated by comparison of a graphics console display of the model trajectory with filmed sequences of a vehicle rollover. Validation of the model establishes the feasibility of this approach for predicting the rollover characteristics of a vehicle and determining relative safety performance between vehicles. 690805. (P-28) The Anthropology of Anthropomorphic Dummies. H. T. E. Hertzberg, U.S. Air Force Systems Command. A program has been developed under the National Highway Safety Bureau, Department of Transportation, to create a set of standard body-forms for anthropo- morphic dummies representative of the American public. Planned sizes include "adult" to "infant" for both sexes. Committee members from both government and industry review anthropometric survey data and choose suitable dimensions, as available, for human body size, for arm, leg, and torso mobility, and for segment masses and e.g. locations. The resulting body-forms will become national stand- ards of size, form, mobility and mass distribution, to which dummies for the American market will have to conform. 690806. (P-28) Field Experience and Evaluation of TAD Project "Vehicle Damage Rating Scale.". Wil- liam S. Rouse and Francis Gendre, University of North Carolina. The TAD vehicle damage rating scale was field tested on a small scale for several months in North Carolina. A test of inter-rater reliability for highway patrolmen using the TAD scale showed there is relatively good agreement among raters as to damage type and severity level. Problems in the use of the scale are noted. A second test involved psychological scaling of the TAD manual pictures and showed that the various TAD scales lacked the desired scale characteristics of equal appearing intervals. A sample of 1329 accident reports was obtained and comparisons made between damage ratings, speed, and estimated damage cost adjusted for vehicle age as predictors of driver injuries. The tests showed that speed is less effective a predictor than either the TAD scale under some conditions, but the TAD scale proved superior for discriminating serious injuries from minor (or no) injuries. 690807. (P-28) The Performance of Automobile Glazing in Urban Accidents. A. J. McLean, Harvard School of Public Health. Laminated glass windshields have not yet been demon- strated to be safer than a less expensive, single sheet of tempered glass. Data from injury-producing urban traffic accidents in Australia, involving tempered glass wind- shields, reveal that while the windshield is a major cause of injuries, they were generally slight and rarely disfig- uring. By modifying the method of mounting the tempered windshield and by controlling the particle count near the periphery of the windshield, the risk of laceration may be greatly reduced. 690808. (P-28) Results of On-the-Scene Investigations of Accidents. Helgo Schneider, Technischer Über- wachungsverein Bayern e.V., München. Of importance for the success of accident prevention campaigns is a definite knowledge of the causes of accidents. Attempts to reconstruct the actual events of accidents through subsequent investigations of the vehi- cles and at the scenes of the accidents often remain very unsatisfactory, since decisive traces and influences-the key to the solution of the problem-have been altered or are no longer there at all. Through presentation of practical examples and results of first-hand experiences, we will show the advantages of securing and evaluating traces of accidents at the scenes by technical experts for subsequent objective reconstruction of the events. The general method of securing traces, as practiced by the experts of our accident department, will be shown in great detail, as will be the thought processes employed by our experts in connection with suitable individual cases. The results obtained in this manner may be divided into three main categories in connection with the causes of accidents. 1. Human error. 2. Inadequacies of the traffic area, including other external circumstances. 3. Technical deficiencies of the vehicle that endanger traffic. 690809. (P-28) Response of the Primate Thorax to Experimental Impact. David L. Beckman and Marvin F. Palmer, Highway Safety Research Inst., Univ. of Michigan. 173</page><page sequence="109">690810-690813 174 Thoracic force-deflection characteristics as affected by impactor mass have been measured in the living sub- human primate as a step toward the analysis of cardio- thoracic injuries. Mechanisms of injury were investigated by subjecting Rhesus monkeys seated on a stationary freely movable sled to static and dynamic chest wall displacements (64 tests) by means of a cartridge-fired projectile equipped with a 3 in. diameter impact plate and an accelerometer compensated force transducer. Forces up to only 30 lb were developed in static press tests for 2 in. deflections but up to 700 lb for the same deflection during dynamic tests. Dynamic tests were run at four different initial impactor weights at 1.0, 1.7, 3.2, and 4.7 lb. Increasing the impactor mass tended to flatten the force-deflection curves which, for the lower impactor mass, showed one or two distinct peaks. These results complement the extensive work of other investigators in this area and indicate the need for additional primate studies. 690810. (P-28) The Abbreviated and the Comprehensive Research Injury Scales. John D. States, Univer- sity of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry. A widely accepted injury scale is urgently needed by medical engineering automotive accident investigation teams. An informal committee of physicians, engineers, and other researchers has developed two scales. The Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) combines and details several existing scales including the DeHaven- Cornell scale, the commonly used police scale, and others. Injuries which are usually not fatal are rated with a 1 to 5 scale. Several scaling criteria were combined but with varying weights to establish the AIS ranking. The Comprehensive Research Injury Scale (CRIS) was developed to separate the criteria used in injury scaling. Five separate criteria are used: Energy Dissipation (ED), Threat-To-Life (TL), Permanent Impairment (PI), Treat- ment Period (TP), and Incidence (IN). The ED scale ranks energy dissipation in injury production, and will be of major value to vehicle designers concerned with human tolerance for injury. L and PI, in part, scale the economic effects of the injury. Anthropometric measurements easily determined by physicians are included in the IAS. Weight, height, total leg length, and tibial length are recorded. From this data, sitting height, knee height, and hip-to-knee distances may be determined. 1969 SA E Transactions 690811. (P-28) Mechanisms of Injuries to Unrestrained Drivers in Head-On Collisions. Gerhard E. Voigt, University of Lund (Sweden).; and Karl Wilfert, Daimler-Benz AG (Germany). Based on injuries determined by autopsies of 82 car drivers, who died after a straight head-on impact, and based on the deformation of the interior of the accident vehicles, the cause of the injuries was analyzed. This material can be divided into four groups, the characteristics of which are mainly defined by location and design of steering assembly, instrument panel, and seat. This evaluation led to a new explanation of the fatal aortic rupture at the classical site appearing very often, and to a number of conclusions relevant to the design of automobiles in terms of internal safety. Tests performed on the impact sled with cadavers and using various steering assemblies at impact speeds of approximately 37 mph confirmed the explanation of the mechanism of the aortic rupture as well as the satisfactory performance of a steering assembly with a shock- absorbing device which latter proved to be especially effective in preventing severe thoracic injuries. 1969 SA E Transactions 690812. (P-28) Safety Seat Designs. Derwyn M. Severy, Harrison M. Brink, Jack D. Baird and David M. Blaisdell, University of California, Los Angeles. Latest safety standards require that passenger car seats be only sufficiently strong to withstand 20 times their own weight during a collision. However, front seats should withstand the 30 G rear passenger impacts during frontal impacts. The current conventional car seat design cannot accommodate direct attachment of restraining systems or direct loading from rear seat occupants. This paper discusses seat concepts evaluated and reported upon in recent years. In addition, recom- mendations derived from full-scale collision experiments are discussed by the authors. 690813. (P-28) Comparisons of Car Crashes in Three Countries. G. Anthony Ryan, Monash Univer- sity Medical School, Australia.; and G. Murray Mackay, University of Birmingham, England. A comparative analysis of detailed road crash data from four different environments is presented. Three of the studies were on-scene investigations of crashes from Adelaide, Australia; Birmingham, and Worcestershire, England. The fourth set of data was taken from ACIR reports by Cornell Aeronautical Lab., Inc. of predomin- antly rural crashes in the United States. Where necessary the data were reanalyzed so that the variables being discussed were compatible. Comparisons are drawn between speeds at impact, areas of impact, vehicle damage severity, seated position, injury severity, anatomical injury distribution, and causes of injury for the four sets of data. The results show that there are considerable similar- ities between rural crashes in England and the United States, and urban crashes in Adelaide and Birmingham. Further, urban crashes have quite distinct characteristics from rural crashes. In urban collisions, speeds are low (22 mph), side impacts are frequent and lead to many injuries from the door structures. There are fewer injuries per person. In rural crashes impact speeds are higher, there are more frontal impacts and rollovers, and more injuries per person. The instrument panel, steering assembly, and</page><page sequence="110">690814-690817 windshield are the major causes of injury, regardless of whether the windshield is toughened or laminated glass, and ejection occurs with considerable frequency. The rank order of components which cause injury is discussed. The rank order changes when minor injuries are excluded. The research shows that the priorities for improve- ments vary with the environment, and a detailed knowl- edge of the crash circumstances in each country is required before design changes can have their maximum effect. 690814. (P-28) A Preliminary Study of an Effective Restraint System for Pregnant Women and Children. Donald J. Van Kirk and Albert I. King, Wayne State Univ. A survey of accident reports and experimental studies showed that the lap belt does not provide sufficient protection for the pregnant car occupant in whom fetal injury or abortion often resulted. A net- type restraint system was used on pregnant sub-human primates which were subjected to decelerations of over 40g in a forward- facing configuration. The animals surveyed multiple impacts without treatment and delivered healthy infants. The data presented include belt loads, body kinematics, and intrauterine pressure measurements. 690815. (P-28) Bíokínetic Study of the Head to Thorax Linkage. C. Tarriere and C. Sapin, Renault- Peugeot Assn. With a view to improving the significance of the results obtained during the simulation of the response of a man exposed to severe acceleration, the authors have studied a simplified model of the head to thorax linkage provided with a suspension. Preliminary calculations or responses from the beha- vior of models provide coefficients of stiffness and damping. The authors propose to authenticate experimen- tally these values and to compare them with values of volunteers in similar situations exposed to moderate forces. 1969 SA E Transactions 690816. (P-28) Two Anthropometric Test Forms - The Frontal Bone of the Skull and a Typical Facial Bone. Jule Brinn, Chrysler Corp. Two anthropometric test devices have been developed to simulate two different portions of the head-these are the frontal bone of the cranium and a typical facial bone. These forms are intended for eventual use in evaluating the crash-worthiness of automotive hardware. This project concentrated on duplicating the fracture behavior of the bone structure; no attempt was made to develop a skin simulant. The creation of a facial bone test device is a more challenging philosophical problem than the headform. A test form which geometrically matches the complete facila skeleton may be too complex to serve as a practical test device. A form which typifies the more prominent facial bones is suggested as being more suitable for near future usage. 1969 SA E Transactions 690817. (P-28) Living Human Dynamic Response to -Gx Impact Acceleration II-Accelerations Measured on the Head and Neck. C. L. Ewing, Naval Aerospace Medical Institute.; D. J. Thomas, Harvard School of Public Health.; L. M. Pat- rick, Wayne State University.; G. W. Beeler, Mayo Clinic.; and M. J. Smith, Naval Aerospace Medical Institute. A methodical investigation and measurement of human dynamic response to impact acceleration is being con- ducted as a Joint Army-Navy- Way ne State University investigation. Details of the experimental design were presented at the Twelfth Stapp Car Crash Conference in October 1968. Linear accelerations are being measured on the top of the head, at the mouth, and at the base of the neck and at the mouth. A redundant photographic system is being used for validation. All data are collected in computer compatible format and data processing is by digital computer. Selected data in a stage of interim analysis on 18 representative human runs of the 236 human runs completed to date are presented. Review of the data indicates that peak accelerations measured at the mouth are higher than previous estimates. The time relationship of the peak resultant mouth accelerations to the peak sled acceleration for this particular accelerator and restraint system is described. The maximum peak resultant mouth acceleration was 47.8 g and the peak mouth angular velocity on another run exceeded 30 rad/sec, on norminal 10 g, 250 g/sec runs. Clinical evaluation of the subjects before and after the runs disclosed no evidence of unconsciousness or neuro- logical deficit attributable to the acceleration. Representative plots of the human dynamic response are presented, discussed, and compared. A first-order linear regression analysis for the peak mouth resultant acceleration and the peak mouth angular velocity obtain- able from the peak sled acceleration is presented. 175</page></plain_text>
