<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> chapter 7 Bonbons and Bayonets: Mixed Messages of  Childhood in the Late Ottoman Empire   and the Early Turkish Republic Benjamin C. Fortna This chapter explores the conflicted nature of Ottoman and Turkish childhood  that emerges from a reading of children’s reading materials, including text- books and magazines produced during the period from the 1880s to 1930. It  argues that, as was the case in Western Europe and many other places around  the world, the image of childhood was constructed at the confluence of a num- ber of competing agendas in the political, social, economic and cultural  spheres. Drawing mostly on children’s reading materials produced both by the  state and private actors, the chapter explores the tensions, contradictions and  mixed messages with which primarily Turkish Muslim children were con- fronted in the late Ottoman and early Turkish Republican eras. In particular, it  examines the contrast between a fanciful, cartoonish world of sweets, dolls  and games and the stark world of warfare, sacrifice and service to the home- land, first the empire and then the nation. The dramatic military conflicts and  political developments of the period that saw the demise of empire and the  emergence of a nation state can, paradoxically, be seen to have been both cru- cial and surprisingly inconsequential in the shaping of children’s lives. The  complexities and contradictions of an age in flux help to explain the conflict- ing expectations which children in this period had to face in order to turn adult  conceptions of childhood into their own lived reality.  Introduction Childhood is almost always understood in different and contradictory ways. It is  experienced; that is to say, lived variously, remembered distortedly and concep- tualized imperfectly. Conceptions of childhood and youth have varied signifi- cantly over time and across cultural and geographical space, reflecting the larger  social, cultural and economic forces at play. To take one prominent example, the  contrasting mythologized Apollonian and Dionysian understanding of youth  identified by Chris Jenks reveal a fundamental difference in the way adults view  © benjamin c. fortna, ���6 | doi �0.��63/9789004305809_009 This is an open access title distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-   Noncommercial 3.0 Unported (CC-BY-NC 3.0) License. &lt;UN&gt; </page> <page sequence="2"> 174 Fortna the young.1 The Dionysian child is thought to be fundamentally bad, both impish  and corrupting, and thus requires adult supervision to correct his or her destruc- tive tendencies. The Apollonian child, by contrast, is understood to be inherently  good, innocent and angelic, but his or her innocence requires adult intervention  to allow the child’s intrinsic creativity the time to develop and mature. What is  interesting for the discussion here is the fact that both views depend upon a  fundamental boundary between childhood and adulthood, one that in many  locales had been erected only fairly recently in historical time as the understand- ing of the ‘new’ child came into being. Both views are, not surprisingly, adult  projections about what childhood should be in its ideal state. Those projections  have proved remarkably powerful but are themselves often tempered by real-life  conditions. As Philippe Ariès famously recognized, across historical time most  parents did not conceive of their children as inhabiting a separate stage of life  delineated by the term ‘childhood.’2 Even when in the relatively recent past this  began to change and young people came to be seen as and even defined by  inhabiting a distinct phase of life, many parents could not afford the luxury of  treating their offspring as if their youth isolated them from the realities of adult  concerns, economic ones first and foremost. While adult recognition of the category of childhood was coming into being,  the lives onto which adults projected their types and concerns were of course  inherently varied. A recent publication offering translations of a range of early  memoirs from the late Ottoman Empire and the early Turkish Republic under- scores this diversity. Even though the fact of authorship, and with it the access  to the literacy and education necessary to compose such reminiscences, entails  a fairly drastic reduction in the possibilities for representativeness of the sam- ple, the lives conveyed in this collection are nevertheless remarkably diverse  with respect to gender, geography, religion, social background and psychologi- cal composition.3 The linguistic, ethnic and cultural richness of the late  Ottoman Empire not surprisingly ensured that its children lived and subse- quently remembered their childhoods in a variety of different ways. This diver- sity of experience notwithstanding, a clear pattern emerges from an investigation  of the ways childhood was conceived and represented by adults. In the late  Ottoman and immediate post-Ottoman periods—times of  especially acute  upheaval, stress and anxiety in both family and imperial/national life—we can  1 Chris Jenks, Childhood (2nd edition, London: Routledge, 1996), 70ff. 2 Philippe Ariès, Centuries of Childhood: A Social History of Family Life, translated by Robert  Baldick (New York: Vintage, 1962). 3 Klaus Kreiser and Patrick Bartsch (eds.), Türkische Kindheiten ([Frankfurt am Main:]  Literaturca, 2012).

In fact, as we shall see, some adults were keen to assign  children the burden of saving the nation. Times of particularly acute stress perhaps naturally generate a degree of anxi- ety that places heightened demands on infancy and youth. The upheavals and  dislocations associated with the demise of the Ottoman Empire and the appear- ance of the nationally defined states that replaced it demonstrate these contra- dictions in especially sharp relief. Given inter alia the unprecedentedly rapid  pace of change in almost all spheres of life—the effects of warfare, including the  dramatic demographic shifts that frequently followed in its wake, the sometimes  abruptly changing ideology of the state and the increasing penetration of public  education with a concomitant rise in literacy and the dissemination of texts— this period placed particularly strong demands on its children. How childhood  was imagined, how it should be molded, the roles that the family and the teacher  ought to play in it, and the extent to which it was conceived as both a distinct and  a fully integrated part of first imperial and then national life: all were being  affected by the stresses generated by the break-up of the Ottoman Empire and  the coming into being of nation states in its stead.  Bonbons This heightened atmosphere exaggerated the pre-existing tendency to create  two distinct worlds of childhood. The first, referred to here in shorthand as the  world of ‘bonbons,’ is a realm of idealized, romanticized and proto-D isneyesque  fantasy. In this construction children are protected and isolated from adult  concerns. In the literature produced for children that was rapidly creating its  own publishing niche from the 1880s onwards children are frequently depicted  as being dependent on the wisdom, bounty and prescience of their elders but  otherwise isolated from the preoccupations of the grown-up world, quite like  their counterparts in the West.4 The first sign that this world was one that treated children as distinctly  different from adults appears in the way that the adult interlocutors address  the children in these texts. The introductions and opening lines of many of  the books and magazines catering to a young readership would frequently  feature passages in which children were spoken to in patronizing terms, such  4 Hugh Cunningham, Children and Childhood in Western Society since 1500 (London: Longman,  1995), 1. &lt;UN&gt; </page> <page sequence="4"> 176 Fortna as “my dears” or “my little ones.” The children inhabiting this world are said to  possess ‘mini-mini brains’ and appear to be completely dependent upon the  world of adults for protection, sustenance and moral guidance. Such forms of  address, while perhaps intended to be affectionate, nevertheless establish an  unmistakable hierarchical barrier between the active adult authorial voice  and the passive child audience. Defining the roles so clearly in this way set the  tone for the content that was to follow in these texts. Sometimes children are depicted as merely mouthing the words of adults,  giving a stilted and scripted aspect to their utterances. This combination of  ventriloquism and wishful thinking produced images such as that displayed on  the cover of one edition of the children’s magazine Gürbüz Türk Çocuğu [The  Healthy Turkish Child].5 Two young children are shown next to an easel sup- porting a blackboard. One of the children has a piece of chalk in hand; the text  beside them reads: “Every nation’s level of civilization is connected to the  importance and attention paid to its children.” These are hardly the words to  be spoken, let alone written, by children still to lose their baby fat. Putting  words into the mouths of children was consonant with a widespread strategy  aimed at framing their world in adult terms. Similarly idealized but presented as natural was the range of activities in  which children were represented. Whether depicted in the process of learning  or playing, children were shown in a range of stilted, demonstrational poses  reflecting an adult fantasy of childhood. This cocooned conception repre- sented children both visually through the increasingly widespread use of illus- trations and verbally as being engaged in a heavily idealized set of activities.  Such scenes mostly show little or nothing in the way of context. Rather, they  depict generically rendered children busy in the abstract projections of their  adult authors and illustrators. Whether playing games, reading or frolicking  with a variety of fluffy animals, the children shown in these images are invari- ably devoid of the normal markers of time and space that would indicate a  localized context for children’s activities. In fact, this world is so far removed from reality that it blends readily into fan- tasy. Animals that can speak, perform mathematical calculations and deploy  elaborate mechanical contraptions populate the reading materials that were  increasingly available for children. Indeed, many of these new publications  included cartoon drawings, underscoring their fictional nature. In this world read- ers encounter a talking horse, a lamb much like Bo-Peep who accompanies a child  to school and the duelling antics of a fox and rabbit who use elaborate mechanical  devices to gain the upper hand over their adversaries. Anthropomorphism plays a  5 Gürbüz Türk Çocuğu [The Healthy Turkish Child] April 23, 1927. &lt;UN&gt; </page> <page sequence="5"> Bonbons and Bayonets 177 central role; animals are frequently given human-like faces and expressions.  Perhaps the ultimate expression of this fantastic dimension is the category of sto- ries and illustrations that portray adventures in outer space, complete with rock- ets and space travellers. These hyper-fictionalized scenes represent the ultimate  representation of an escapist tendency in the depiction of children’s activities in  these sources. For example, the children’s magazine Yeni Yol offered a story in  which two boys were each encouraged to choose a book and to read it on their  own at school. One of the boys opts for a Jules Verne-like tale that contains an  account of lunar travel and the discovery of a new celestial body.6 In an era increas- ingly exposed to and interested in the possibilities afforded by newly developing  technologies such as rapid transport and new modes of communication by land,  sea and air,7 it was perhaps not surprising that children’s literature would engage  with the more imaginative—and entertaining—end of the spectrum. Even the school, the most common, grounded, everyday element on display  in characterizations of childhood, could be portrayed as a highly artificial  realm. In both the late Ottoman and early Turkish Republican periods the edu- cational institution was cloyingly depicted as a joyful world where grateful  children appreciated and even eulogized their schools and teachers. In these  texts, children are made to do all sorts of unlikely things in order to conform to  adult projections of an idealized childhood. Two examples convey the lengths  to which children’s authors went in trying to concoct an idealized fondness for  school. The first, a poem by the celebrated author and educationalist Tevfik  Fikret (1867–1915) takes the form of a dialogue between a girl named Şermin  and her grandmother. Understandably one of the great poet’s little-known  works, the poem details in highly stilted terms the things that its young female  protagonist Şermin loves the most. After mentioning the members of her fam- ily she dwells on her favorite sweets, such as rice pudding, candy and pastry, But most of all I love my school, My school I love very much Beautiful building! What things it teaches me.8 6 Yeni Yol 50, 13 Teşrin-i sani 1340 [November 13, 1924], 417. 7 For a discussion of the importance of the new as represented by technology in the late  Ottoman period, see Palmira Brummett, Image and Imperialism in the Ottoman Revolutionary  Press, 1908–1911 (Albany, ny: suny Press), 289 ff. 8 Sadrettin Celal, Cümhuriyet Çocuklarına Sevimli Kırâat (Istanbul: Kanaat Kütüphanesi, 1928),  9–10.

Fortna, Learning to Read in the Late Ottoman Empire  and the Early Turkish Republic (Houndmills: Palgrave Macmillan, 2011), 58–59. &lt;UN&gt; </page> <page sequence="6"> 178 Fortna Another perhaps equally far-fetched attempt expressed the sorrow that chil- dren allegedly felt at having to say goodbye to their schools at the start of the  summer holidays. In one children’s reader from the 1940s a child is made to pen  a letter to the beloved institution. It begins: “Dear School, We are parting. There  are tears in our eyes and a strange feeling of sorrow in our hearts [...].”9 To our  eyes these words may seem strange indeed, or at least wishful thinking, but  they are typical of the no doubt well-intentioned if somewhat pathetic  attempts to demonstrate idealized behavior to young readers that formed a  prominent element in the construction of the saccharine, idealized fantasy of  the world of bonbons.  Bayonets By contrast, the depiction of childhood as something startlingly grounded in  real-world concerns is referred to here as the world of ‘bayonets.’ In this realm  we encounter children who are not only firmly situated in the grown-up world  from which they were often excluded in the ‘bonbon’ realm but also heavily  engaged with it. Far from being sheltered from the worrying developments of  the outside world, children in this realm appear affected by both such ‘real  world’ events and phenomena as war, economic competition and the need for  national uplift and progress, and are depicted as being actively involved in  efforts aimed at improving both their own lot in life and the standing of their  country.10 In some cases the actions of children are described in these materi- als as being crucial to the prosperity—and even the survival—of the empire or  nation itself. The dualism between the world of bonbons and that of bayonets is discern- ible in all sub-periods from the 1880s to the 1930s but the balance becomes  noticeably more weighted in favor of the realm of the bayonet during periods  of crisis, and especially after 1911. From that year the Ottoman Empire entered  into a succession of wars, first the Italian or Libyan War [Trablusgarp Harbi],  then the Balkan Wars (1912–1913), followed by the First World War (1914–1918)  9 Muallim Cevdet [İnanç], Çocuklar için... Hayat bilgisine uygun yazılar ve temsiller  ([Balıkesir]: Türk Dili, 1943), 24. 10 Interestingly, in parallel but separate contexts Ottoman children were being encouraged  to pursue education in order to serve their own ‘nations’ or ‘races,’ what we would today  call ethnic or religious groups. Many of these groups used the purportedly essential differ- ences between groups as a spur to encourage striving for success. For a good example, see  Duygu Köksal’s description of Demetra Vaka (this volume). &lt;UN&gt; </page> <page sequence="7"> Bonbons and Bayonets 179 and finally the Greek invasion and ‘National Struggle’ which ultimately resulted  in the founding of the Turkish Republic in 1923. As might be expected under  these extremely trying circumstances, the depiction of children could change  dramatically to reflect the altered circumstances of the period and especially  the adoption of a seemingly permanent war footing. In general terms we can  notice a trend to portray children as much more independent, a virtue born of  the necessity of coping with the increasingly trying ‘demands of the present.’  But their independence needed to be subordinate to imperial/national inter- ests. They needed to be resourceful but also obedient, independent but also  orderly, on time and clean.11 They needed to be curious and intelligent but also  to conform to a long list of positive attributes that were drawn up by adults. Modelling a range of practical activities was the result of this approach. For  example, children were depicted as being taught to work, to save money and to  serve their country, first the Ottoman Empire and then after 1923 the Turkish  Republic. One story from 1909 combined these two goals by telling the exem- plary tale of a group of male students who had pooled their resources to start  a company. Standing before a model of a steamship, the story’s protagonist and  the boys’ teacher tells his students of another group of boys from the same  school who had formed a business partnership fifteen years earlier. By saving  their pocket money instead of spending it on sweets or entertainment, their  predecessors had saved enough to present their school with the very model  that stood before the present-day students of 1909. But, the teacher continued,  their partnership did not end when they left school but rather flourished as  they made their way into business. Eventually they were able to buy a real  steamship that was to be the first of many in their successful foray into the  world of commerce; their firm was held up before the rapt fictional audience  as evidence of the power of partnership, common endeavour, technology and  patriotic service.12 In these texts, the very point of childhood and education in  particular is to contribute to the nation and, in its more extreme expressions,  actually to save it by taking up arms, as we shall shortly see. In contrast to the serenely oblivious approach of the world of bonbons, the  mindset of the world of the bayonet brought politics to the fore. Political actors  appear prominently in these texts. The first to appear were the last Ottoman  sultans before they eventually give way to Mustafa Kemal, who assumes a  11 On the important role of punctuality and hygiene in late Ottoman approaches to school- age children, see Avner Wishnitzer, “Teaching Time: Schools, Schedules and the Ottoman  Pursuit of Progress,” New Perspectives on Turkey 43, 2010, 5–32. 12 Tüccarzâde İbrahim Hilmi, Altın Kitab: Çocuklara ilk kıraat (Istanbul: Kitabhane-i Askeri,  1327 [1909-1910]), 35–37. &lt;UN&gt; </page> <page sequence="8"> 180 Fortna remarkably conspicuous place in the children’s literature of the early  Republican period as, indeed, he did in society at large. Beyond political lead- ership, everyday concerns associated with warfare, hardship, suffering and the  application of effort and persistence are the hallmarks of this milieu, which  often seems unrecognizable by contrast with the world of dolls, toys and frivol- ity. This is part of a general trend towards representing the ‘real world’ of poli- tics, geography and adult concerns to children. The school played an important role in defining this world as well.  Increasingly represented as a microcosm for the political community—first  the empire and then the nation—the educational institution was a crucial site  in modelling an array of new behaviors and attitudes. These could assume an  increasingly political function, particularly in the early Republican period  when educational change played a crucial part in the Kemalist ‘revolution.’ But  they were part of a longer trend towards the politicization of education that  had begun in the late Ottoman period. In the last decades of the imperial era,  we begin to see visual representations of the Ottoman sultan appearing in chil- dren’s textbooks, first in the form of the royal coat of arms,13 and then portrait- like illustrations,14 along with maps of the Empire. Alongside them appeared  messages underscoring the importance of such qualities as obedience to those  in authority, respect for one’s elders, thrift and service to the Empire. This ten- dency, with some important adjustments, was continued and, indeed, consid- erably amplified in the period of the Turkish Republic. It now showcased the  role of Mustafa Kemal, soon to be renamed ‘Atatürk,’ who assumed the role of  Educator-in-Chief [Başöğretmen] as one of his myriad public personae.  Atatürk’s image appeared regularly in textbooks and magazines intended for  children in this period. Typical of the paternal image fostered in such publica- tions was that of Atatürk teaching the new alphabet from 1928. While he was  depicted as teaching the new script to the full range of the population, images  of him teaching the new letters to a child in his lap were particularly promi- nent.15 But it is important to remember that children’s publications from both  the late Ottoman and early Republican period enlisted a wide range of e minent  13 Çocuklara Rehber 20, 5 Rebiülahr 1315/21 Ağustos 1313 [September 3, 1897], 1. 14 Ali İrfan, Birinci Kıraat (Istanbul: İkbal Kütüphanesi/Şems Matbaası, 1328–1330 [1910–1912]), 5. 15 Yasemin Gençer, Chris Gratien and Emily Neumeier, “Child and Nation in Early Republican  Turkey,” Ottoman History Podcast, 102, April 19, 2013.

The ultimate expression of the world of the bayonet appears in the form of  the militarization of childhood, especially from 1911 onwards. The Italian inva- sion of Ottoman Libya and the subsequent war there was a conflict that, how- ever asymmetrical and however brief, had important implications for the  conceptualization of the Ottoman/Turkish nation.16 The shores of Libya may  have seemed remote to many in the Ottoman heartlands, but the outbreak of  the Balkan Wars in 1912 brought the reality of military conflict much closer to  home; the Empire’s heartlands responded by adopting a martial footing. Public  rallies and demonstrations, increasingly desperate news from the front con- veyed by an increasingly prominent press, the physical presence of long lines  of refugees with their oxcarts in Istanbul, and the overall economic crisis  underscored the proximity of the conflict. With the outbreak of the First World  War, the militarization of Ottoman society took on unprecedented dimen- sions.17 For many, the end of that brutal conflict, in which Ottoman mortality  rates made the Western Front seem almost benign, brought little relief. The  occupation and invasion of Anatolia by a combination of forces, including the  French in southeastern Anatolia and the Greeks in the west, occasioned armed  resistance and in many areas outright civil war.18 The succession of wars and the resulting militarization of Ottoman society  affected children in a variety of ways. Most apposite to this discussion of the  messages with which children were confronted as they learned to read was  the conflation of education and warfare. The blurring of the lines between the  civilian and military duties and responsibilities expected from and modelled  for children took a variety of forms. The subtler, or more nearly subtle, meth- ods included framing educational activities such as reading in an imperial or  national context. Illustrations increasingly captured students in patriotic  poses, whether depicting a child reading in a setting in which the national flag  16 Murat Belge, “Genç Kalemler and Turkish Nationalism,” in Celia Kerslake, Kerem Öktem  and Philip Robins (eds), Turkey’s Engagement with Modernity: Conflict and Change in the  Twentieth Century (Houndmills: Palgrave Macmillan, 2010). 17 Yiğit Akın, “The First World War and the Ottoman Empire: The Home-Front Perspective,”  paper presented to the soas Seminars on Turkey, London, March 8, 2013. 18 For a recent account of this period, see Ryan Gingeras, Sorrowful Shores: Violence, Ethnicity,  and the End of the Ottoman Empire, 1912–1923 (New York: Oxford University Press, 2009). &lt;UN&gt; </page> <page sequence="10"> 182 Fortna is draped across the top of the picture19 or playing football on a field in which  the flag flies from a pole situated behind the goal in the background of the  image on a magazine’s cover.20 In contrast to the lack of context displayed in  the world of the bonbons, the land of bayonets ensured that real-time national  referents were increasingly common in the depictions of children and their  activities, even if these were only subtly incorporated. Most efforts to infuse childhood with a military ethos were, unsurprisingly  perhaps, much more direct, sometimes jarringly so. Consider the poem enti- tled “You’ll Be a Soldier” [Asker olacaksın]. Accompanied by an illustration of  a toddler marching with a rifle while holding the reins of a toy horse on wheels  (Figure 7.1), the poem mixes together the worlds of childhood and the military.  The poem reads: Now shoulder your rifle, mini mini But tomorrow the game will end They’ll say to you: Move out, soldier! On your shoulders, pack and rifle...21 The shift from the realm of innocent play to deadly fighting is abrupt and even  rather surreal. Other poems presented for child readers are still more direct. The poem that  appears under the illustration mentioned above in which the flag frames the read- ing child, a work entitled “Mektepli” [The student] by the “national poet” Mehmet  Emin (Yurdakul), manages to combine bellicosity with zeal for learning: Friend! I am a little soldier: I have that blood in my veins; My eyes gleam with that fire; I also want to wage war; —O child, what is your strength? —Knowledge! My pen will be my weapon, My book will serve as my fort; 19 Mehmed Fuad Köprülüzâde, Cumhuriyet Çocuklarına Yeni Millî Kıraat (Istanbul: Kanaat  Kitaphanesi, 1926), 86. 20 Bizim Mecmua 18, 3 Ağustos 1922. 21 Seracettin [Hisaroğlu], Çocuk Kitabı: Kolay Kıraat (İlk mektep - İkinci sınıf) (Istanbul:  Kütüphane-i Hilmi, 1341 [1925]), 51. &lt;UN&gt; </page> <page sequence="11"> Bonbons and Bayonets 183 Figure 7.1  Illustration for the poem “You’ll Be a Soldier” &lt;UN&gt; </page> <page sequence="12"> 184 Fortna My days will be full of conquests; In every place I will be at the front. —O soldier, who is your enemy? —Ignorance.22 Some texts presented war and its destructive power in much more concrete  terms. One children’s magazine called its readers’ attention to the devastation  that resulted from the War of Independence. Describing the effects of the war  on Western Asia Minor, what had been “the most prosperous regions of  Anatolia,” the magazine’s editor referred to it as having been turned into “a  heap of ashes.” He describes how he wept at the site before cursing the “vile  and despicable enemy” but then in a dramatic twist links the recovery of the  nation to the very children he is addressing: “You are the ones whose minds  and efforts will rebuild the nation. All of our hopes rest with you. Work, my  dears.”23 The connection between education and militarization became even  more concrete as the Turkish Republic both continued to use schools as a  vehicle for infusing a martial spirit among its youth and used the army as an  institution to educate the broader public, as underscored by the phrase that  the government publicized on posters that said, “The Army is the People’s  School” [Ordu Bir Halk Mektebidir].24 It is important to note the heavily gendered way in which children’s wartime  duties are presented. Girls are expected to help out in the domestic sphere, by  working with their mothers. Female literacy is valued mainly for its ability to  enable girls to write letters to absent soldier fathers while boys drill and pre- pare to take up arms for the nation. In one representative children’s reader  from the early Turkish Republican era, all children are encouraged to love their  flag and pay reverence to Mustafa Kemal—the headmaster of the nation—but  the roles are quite gender-specific. Boys are represented playing a variety of  martial games (marching, shouldering rifles, etc.) while the girls are seen to be  taking care of domestic duties (sewing, cleaning, etc.). Girls are shown to  employ their educational attainments in a supporting role. A frequent trope is  for the good girl, after finishing her housework, to write a letter that will sur- prise her distant father with her ability to write and therefore to play her part  in keeping the nation together during times of turmoil: 22 Köprülüzâde, Cumhuriyet Çocuklarına, 86–87. 23 Yeni Yol 10, 8 Teşrin-i sani 1339 [November 8, 1923], 146. 24 On the subject of the Turkish “martial spirit,” see Ayşe Gül Altınay, The Myth of the Military  Nation: Militarism, Gender, and Education in Turkey (Houndmills: Palgrave Macmillan,  2004), 29 ff.

Your loving daughter Yıldız  Worlds Colliding For the most part the two worlds we have been analyzing here remained dis- tinct but occasionally they collided, sometimes jarringly so. Returning to the  toy soldier depicted alongside the poem “You’ll be a Soldier,” we have an  image that highlights the incongruity of the two worlds of youthful inno- cence and adult concerns. The toddler portrayed here is curiously suspended  between the world of toys and games, represented by the lead to the pull-toy  hobby horse in one hand, and the realm of violence and death, represented  by the rifle with its affixed bayonet held in the other, thus fittingly illustrat- ing the conflicted approach to children during this period of flux and,  increasingly, of acute societal and political stress. It would not be the first or  the last time that childhood and education were drawn into important polit- ical battles, of course. We need only think of the tussles over curricular  reform waged in both the late Ottoman and Turkish Republican periods or  the debates over the headscarf in more recent years to find other prominent  examples. What makes the mixed messages presented to children in the  materials we have been surveying here particularly noticeable is the clash  inherent in the juxtaposition between the two worlds that were otherwise  carefully kept apart. Some of the difficulty, if not downright ineptitude, in finding a balanced  approach to children can doubtless be attributed to the novelty of the situa- tion. The popular press and the idea of public education were still relatively  new phenomena in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century and  authors and publishers were struggling to come to terms with how to address  children and with finding the appropriate content to offer the new but growing  constituency of—and market for—the young reading public.25 In attempting  to find the right balance, publishers adopted a variety of modes of address,  ranging from the patronizing to the collegial and even at times the conspirato- rial.26 There were also many attributes that linked the two worlds. They both  25 For more detail, see Fortna, Learning to Read. 26 For examples of children’s publications attempting to forge an alliance against the  teacher, see Fortna, Learning to Read, 148 ff. &lt;UN&gt; </page> <page sequence="14"> 186 Fortna shared important common attitudes towards their child audience, such as the  frequently overweening didacticism inherent in their approach to children  and the distrust of larger social milieus outside the confines of the controlled  classroom or the carefully concocted text. But as we have seen, the contrasts between the two worlds could on occa- sion be remarkably sharp. When these worlds collided the result could appear  stark. For example, an early Republican-era children’s magazine cover featured  an illustration of a girl teaching Turkish to her dolls and stuffed animals. Next  to a caption which reads “Teacher Nebahat gives a lesson in Turkish,” the young  girl appears to be earnestly engaged in teaching a class composed of her  assembled dolls and playthings, some of which are seated on miniature chairs.  Outside of the frame the stern visage of Mustafa Kemal Paşa in military attire  surveys the scene. This is yet another image that neatly encapsulates the ten- sion between the serious and the frivolous at work in children’s literature from  this period.27 Even the cloistered activity of a child playing with her toys could  be confronted, even in pictorial form, with the adult world of politics and  nation, thereby producing an odd juxtaposition. From the perspective of the children, for whom after all these messages  were intended, it must have been puzzling indeed to negotiate the dichotomy  between these two worlds. Young readers were confronted with a variety of  mixed messages. The political ones were perhaps the most obvious. For exam- ple, child readers in the last years of the Ottoman Empire were encouraged to  devote themselves to the Empire and its sultan.28 It was not long, however,  before they were being encouraged to curse the former Ottoman ruler and to  despise the Empire almost as soon as it had been replaced.29 More coherent  were the intended contrasts put before children to reinforce behavioral or  moral lessons. The juxtaposition between the good child and the bad child was  a standard trope in the literature produced for children—and one of the chief  reasons for its rather stilted approach. The prolific late Ottoman writer Ahmed  Midhat Efendi virtually made a career out of the didactic style evident in his  Terbiyeli Çocuk [The Well-behaved Child],30 published in the mid-1880s, which  juxtaposes a well-behaved and a naughty child. Other publications picked up  on this theme. One item in a children’s magazine from the very early Republican  period contrasted a lazy child with his hardworking counterpart.31 The lazy  27 Yeni Yol 46, 16 Teşrin-i evvel 1340 [October 16, 1924]. 28 See, for example, İrfan, Birinci Kıraat, 8. 29 See, for example, Köprülüzâde, Cumhuriyet Çocuklarına, 3. 30 Ahmed Midhat Efendi, Terbiyeli Çocuk (İstanbul: Kırkanbar, 1303 [1885–1886]). 31 Yeni Yol 20, 17 Kanunusani 1340 [17 January 1904], 275. &lt;UN&gt; </page> <page sequence="15"> Bonbons and Bayonets 187 child has lost everything while his poor, hardworking opposite made some- thing of himself. Another version of this theme was to contrast the literate  child with his or her illiterate twin. The former is a happy child who receives  presents from his relatives, reads stories to his parents after helping them with  the housework and is given money to buy books, while the latter ignores his  teachers who punish him, is scolded by his mother for his disobedience and  locked in a cupboard for good measure.32 The question of how children responded to these mixed messages would  require additional research but we can hazard a guess that the responses would  have been diverse. It seems likely that some children were eager to join the  world of the bayonet while others were content to remain in the safe but illu- sory world of bonbons. What seems clear is that in their groping for ways to  speak to the young, the adults of the rapidly shifting late Ottoman and early  Turkish Republican periods attempted to establish a series of clear pedagogical  contrasts. This chapter has focused on the juxtaposition of the protected with  an engaged conception of childhood in order to highlight one of the many such  distinctions being drawn for children in this period. Other examples include  the contrasts between good against bad, new against old, Western against  Oriental or secular against religious. But children have always been forced to  accommodate and overcome the inconsistencies of adults. The transition from  Ottoman Empire to the Turkish Republic was perhaps only a rather exaggerated  case of the mixed messages with which children are confronted all the time.
