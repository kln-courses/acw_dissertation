Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009 John Cameron Mitchell's film Hedwig and the Angry Inch (2001) traces the sexual and spiritual journey of a partially transgendered rock star searching for her "other half." Her pursuit of erotic completion is depicted explicitly in "The Origin of Love," a song based on a creation myth told only in Plato's Symposium. This article demonstrates that the film owes a greater ideological debt to the Platonic dialogue than has been recog nized and investigates how the narrative of Hedwig's story visually dramatizes the Symposium's many forms of eros. Both works delineate a sphere of all-male sexuality to explore the origin and satisfaction of erotic longing while employing a female per sona to show that the highest form of love transcends physicality to culminate in the pursuit of knowledge. While Mitchell transports the premise of the Symposium to the cutting edge of cinema and music, he expands its ideological range to interrogate the definition of love and its intersection with gender identity. Introduction Hedwig and the Angry Inch (hereafter Hedwig) is the cinematic interpre tation of an off-Broadway rock musical dironicling the sexual and spir itual life of Hansel, an East German teen, transformed into Hedwig.2 1. An earlier version of this paper was presented at the annual meeting of the South Central Modern Languages Association, New Orleans, LA, 30 October 2004. Dis cussions of Hedwig with Catherine Freis, Rebecca Resinski and Matt Vieron improved the argument. Special thanks are owed to Anne MacMaster and Alexandra Pappas for thoughtful comments, and to the editor of IJCT, Wolfgang Haase, for his fruitful comments and for valuable bibliographic suggestions. 2.

Left physically indefinable ac cording to binary gender categories, Hansel constructs a feminine persona with his mother's name, Hedwig, a wig and a trousseau of women's clothes that mask "an angry inch" - the remains of his masculinity, used as a painful and poignant joke throughout the film. Although freed from Germany, Hed wig is jilted by the GI and stranded in a Kansas trailer park. Reinventing her self as a female glam-rock singer, she tours the country performing gritty rock music to unresponsive audiences in a series of dim salad-bar restaurants, shadowing her former lover, Tommy, a rock star who exploits her music. This physical journey mirrors Hedwig's attempt to reconcile her fractured physi cal and psychological identity through an external search for love with a dis appointing series of partners: her cold East German mother; Luther, the lecherous and treacherous American GI; Tommy Speck, Hedwig's young ini tiate into the mysteries of rock music and homoerotic love; and finally Yitzhak, a transvestite whom Hedwig dominates through a punishing and miserable marriage.3 Set in the late 1980's, in the years surrounding the fall of the Berlin Wall, Hedwig's story was inspired by Aristophanes' myth in Plato's Symposium, the famous etiology for love as a longing for reunification with one's "other half." The appropriation of Platonic thought is easily identified in the film's second song, "The Origin of Love," an inventive adaptation of Aristophanes' speech by musician and lyricist Steven Trask that serves as the film's thematic center. While this explicit use of the Symposium in Hedwig has been acknowledged in studies of the text's reception, the film's greater engagement with Plato's di alogue has yet to be explored fully.4 Jon Solomon, Martin M. Winkler, and Maria Wyke have advocated elo quently for the value of film as mediator between classical culture and mod ern contexts.5 Recent scholarship has supported these claims through the lyrics has been taken from this film version. Hedwig is primarily the product of two artists, John Cameron Mitchell (director/writer/star) and Stephen Trask (mu sician/ lyricist) whose collaboration is discussed below, pages 4-7. Elements of Hedwig's story exclusively used in stage performances are so noted. 3. The use of gendered pronouns for transgendered and partially transgendered in dividuals is a complex issue. For the sake of this argument, I have used he/him to refer to Hansel before his operation and she/her to refer to post-operative Hed wig since the character is consistently presented with a female identity following the sex-change operation (despite its failure) until the end of the film. Through out this argument the term "sex" refers to biologically and physically determined features, while "gender" refers to socially and culturally constructed identity through learned behaviors. 4. James Lesher discusses Hedwig briefly when cataloguing performances of the Symposium on stage and screen as a prelude to his study of artistic representa tions of the Symposium.

Following a comparison of the narrative frame of each work, I analyze Hedwig's homo sexual relationships as a contemporary reflection of the possible benefits and perils of love suggested by the Symposium's different speakers. Finally, I ex plore the ways in which Mitchell and Trask craft Hedwig as an embodiment of the daimonic nature of eros in Diotima's speech. As a male figure with a fe male persona who yet lives between genders, Hedwig refocuses Platonic in quiry from the nature of Love and the pursuit of Knowledge onto the nature of gender and self-knowledge. Throughout my argument, I pair aspects of "Introduction" to Classical Myth and Culture in the Cinema, ed. Martin M. Winkler (Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 2001) and "Neo-Mythologism: Apollo and the Muses on the Screen," International Journal of the Classical Tradition 11 (2004-2005), 383-423, on pages 383-86. 6. For the term, see Winkler, "Neo-Mythologism" (above, n. 5), 384. 7. Lesher ("Some Notable Afterimages" [above, n. 4], 315) counts six recent stage and screen adaptations, including Hedwig. Among these, Jonathan Miller's 1965 BBC production The Drinking Tarty is a sharp counter-point to Hedwig. It nearly omits discussion of homosexuality from Aristophanes' speech, and thus illus trates the force of contemporary social views on reception of the dialogue. 8. Lesher ("Some Notable Afterimages" [above, n. 4], 339). He carefully qualifies that the text has a dominant central message in Socrates' speech, but that this is not always readily seen or thought to be the most salient to writers and artists with individual artistic aims in drawing up on the dialogue (340). 9. Here I follow terminology outlined and illustrated by Lorna Hardwick, Reception Studies, Greece and Rome. n.s. 33 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003). 10. Philosophy is inextricably linked to music within the film. Young Hansel was kicked out of the German academy after dehvering, "You, Kant, Always Get What You Want," a paper on philosophy and rock music with a witty title that puns on an eponymous Rolling Stones song. 11. Janice Siegel's ("Tennessee Williams' Suddenly Last Summer and Euripides' Bac chae," International Journal of the Classical Tradition 11 [2004-2005], 538-570) demon stration of The Bacchae's influence on Tennessee Williams' Suddenly Last Summer provided a useful model for my analysis, since both films are based on plays in fluenced primarily by a single classical Greek model.</page><page sequence="4">Sypniewski 561 Hedwig with speeches in the Symposium to reveal a rich correspondence of ideas between film and dialogue. Hedwig and Reception of Plato's Symposium The 2001 film Hedwig and the Angry Inch resulted from seven years of collab oration between actor/writer/director John Cameron Mitchell and musi cian/lyricist Stephen Trask.12 Their debt to the Symposium for the 'The Origin of Love" is well documented; yet it is noteworthy that both artists experienced Aristophanes' speech within the context of the whole dialogue.13 While acci dental confluence may account for some of the narrative and conceptual sim ilarities for which I shall argue below, the artists' demonstrable engagement with the speech's larger philosophic context supports broader intertextual readings of text and film. Plato's Symposium was seminal in Hedwig's genesis, as Mitchell explains: "I'd seen a stage adaptation of the entire Symposium in LA, and that myth just stayed with me. It's interesting that it's a myth written by a man and didn't develop as a historical tradition, so it's very per sonal .... we had that before we had a story, a 2,500 year old myth, that was always the centre of it."14 When Mitchell met Trask, he was already nurturing the creative seeds of a story that would explore the divided self through Aristophanes' myth. He bought the Symposium for Trask, charging him to read it and create a song based on the myth within it. Trask's first song, "The Origin of Love," was the centerpiece of Mitchell's debut as Hedwig in 1994 at Squeezebox, a weekly drag night at Don Hill's in New York City. This groundbreaking act combined drag, rock music and aspects of musical theater to tell Hedwig's story, alter nating songs with tragicomic autobiographical monologues.15 Over four years, Mitchell and Trask molded the material into a rock mu sical that opened on Feb. 14th 1998 at the Jane Street Theater in New York City. Retaining the original music, they expanded Hedwig's character and her range of experiences, drawing on a number of literary, filmic and theatrical in 12. This development is traced at length in the documentary (Whether You Like It or Not: The Story of Hedwig, directed by Laura Nix [New York, NY: Automat Pictures, 2003], available on the 2003 Platinum Series DVD release of Hedwig and the Angry Inch [see above, n. 2]). 13. For example, when discussing the universality of the film's message, Mitchell qualifies that "people are interested in where our needs come from, and in not being alone; that's important in every culture. But this is a particularly Western myth, and Plato is the beginning of Western culture, really" 0ohn Cameron Mitchell, Interview with Cynthia Fuchs, PopMatters [2001], par 15: http: / / www. popmatters.com/film/interviews/mitchell-john-cameron.shtml 2001 [27 June 2007]). 14.

A German army wife, in whose trailer Mitchell played as a child, inspired Hedwig's char acter. Divorced by the soldier who brought her to the US, she supported her self by babysitting and prostitution. Hansel's life as "an ultimate outsider" in East Germany was influenced by the 1992 film I Am My Own Woman (Ich Bin Meine Eigene Frau), an autobiographical documentary on the transvestite Charlotte Von Mahlsdorf.17 Enmeshed with these influences, Plato's dialogue continued to structure the narrative of Hedwig. Mitchell explains that even Hedwig's failed trans gender "operation came out of all these divided - Plato, the divided self, the divided city of Berlin; and in the club we were developing it in, there was all this divided gender going on - so it just came out of the themes and the setting."18 In particular, Aristophanes' speech retained a central position from first drag performance to film debut. During initial club performances, simple drawings illustrating the myth were projected behind Mitchell as he sang "The Origin of Love" to help the audience, who might miss some of the lyrics in the chaotic club setting, grasp the symbolism of the myth at the heart of the story.19 For the film, Emily Hubley drew a full animation sequence, a graphic illus tration of the song's lyrics. Excerpts and still images from the animation are also used to bridge the transitions between scenes throughout the film, un derscoring Mitchell's claim that "Hedwig [is] a walking metaphor for this myth/'20 While Aristophanes' etiology of love plainly shaped the way Mitchell and Trask formulated Hedwig's initial understanding of erotic fulfillment, many aspects of the film's narrative demonstrate a more serious engagement with the Symposium's speeches. Throughout the film, failed relationships compel 16. The summary is drawn from Whether You Like It or Not (above, n. 12). 17. Interview with Cynthia Fuchs (above, n. 13), par. 9. Jens R.

The many lit erary and artistic sources for Hedwig's persona are worthy of study in their own right. For example, Hedwig was named after a woman destroyed by too much honesty in Ibsen's The Wild Duck. 18. Interview with S.F. Said (above, n. 14), par. 28. 19. To the same end, Trask's real-life rock band Cheater, playing Hedwig's band Angry Inch, lowered the volume and toned down their rock style so that the au dience would not miss the lyrics, and, consequentially, an essential part of the plot (Elizabeth Wollman, The Theater Will Rock.

This personal evolution can be read as parallel to the progressive reassessment of eros in the Symposium and its culmination in the mysteries of love revealed by Diotima: love is the pursuit of beauty in all things and knowledge itself.21 The conclusion of Hedwig echoes Diotima's speech through an evocative image of personal re-birth symbolizing knowl edge independent of sexual and romantic attachment while shifting abstract epistemological inquiry to personal discovery.22 Setting the Stages From the outset, Hedwig and Plato's Symposium share a conceptual framework that represents the physical journey as a metaphor for the psychological, the role of memory and recollection of past events told with a mythic tone, and the centrality of the listener or audience within both narratives. The Symposium, written sometime after 385 BCE, pretends to record a description in 406 BCE of the events of the symposium held in 416 BCE to celebrate Agathon's victory in tragedy at the City Dionysia. The events of this evening are reported within an elaborate narrative framework that begins with the answer to a question that is never reported, plunging the audience into the dialogue in medias res. Apollodorus, the primary narrator, weaves a complex tale for an anonymous friend while they walk down a road, the story of how he retold the events of the symposium where prominent Athenian guests, including Socrates, gave speeches on eros (172al-173d3). These he heard from Aristodemus, whose rec ollection of the symposium was framed by a journey with Socrates to and from Agathon's.23 Apollodorus reports, "Of course, Aristodemus couldn't remember exactly what everyone said, and I myself don't remember everything he told me. But I'll tell 21. Jeffery Carries neatly summarizes David Halperin's theory of Plato's "erotics of narrativity" which posits that the Symposium cyclically creates desire in the reader through eros for knowledge about Eros. Successive speeches on the nature of love invite the reader to accept and reject these arguments in turn, heightening desire for knowledge of the "True Nature of Eros" revealed by Socrates and Diotima ("The Myth Which Is Not One: Construction of Discourse in Plato's Symposium," in Rethinking Sexuality. Foucault and Classical Antiquity, eds. David H.J. Larmour, Paul A. Miller, and Chris Platter [Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1998], 104-21, quotation on 108). For Halperin's fuller argument, see "Plato and the Erotics of Narrativity," in Innovations of Antiquity, eds. Daniel Selden and Ralph Hexter (New York: Routledge, 1992), 95-126. 22. It is impossible when reading the Symposium, written only in majuscule letters, to determine, apart from context, whether eros refers to the god, the concept, or per haps more importantly, both since there was no linguistic or orthographic way to distinguish between Eros, the anthropomorphic personification of the concept as a god, and eros, the concept itself. The linguistic slippage results from such am biguity since doubleness in form is an equally important premise of Hedwig, in which Hedwig embodies both the union and disjunction of opposites. 23. On the mimetic nature of Apollodorus' prologue, see Kevin Corrigan and Elena Glazov-Corrigan, Plato's Dialectic at Play (University Park, PA: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 2004), 7-20.</page><page sequence="7">564 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / December 2008 you what he remembered best, and what I consider the most impor tant points" (178al-5).24 The reader is thereby introduced to the highlights of the event retold through the imperfect lens of memory and the narration of speeches removed three and four times from their original utterance. These many embedded layers of reported speech, grounded neither in time nor place, "heighten our sense that the Symposium is an evocation of the past, not in an historical but in a mythi cal sense."25 Accordingly, the act of reading the text is a model for the mes sage of the dialogue itself: the pursuit of knowledge is a process of uncovering layers of reported speech, each one closer to the real event, or the truth, a par allel to the "ladder of love" proposed by Diotima. Hedwig begins with a similarly disorienting immersion into the story with little immediate context. The first scene opens at a stage show by Hed wig's band Angry Inch, performing for an apathetic audience of diners un prepared for the film's opening declaration, "Ladies and gentlemen, whether you like it or not - Hedwig." Hedwig struts on stage in a skimpy denim out fit, flowing blond wig and exaggerated makeup, then defiantly introduces herself to the stunned crowd: "Don't you know me? I'm the new Berlin Wall, baby Try and tear me down."26 She immediately launches into an aggressive rock song, "Tear Me Down," which reveals that Hedwig is not a woman at all, destabilizing perceived reality for both internal audience of the show and external audience of the film. Yitzhak, the back up singer, speaks the song's most important lyrics: "We thought the wall would stand forever, but now that it's gone, we don't know who we are anymore. Ladies and Gentlemen, Hedwig is like that wall, standing before you in the divide between East and West, slavery and freedom, man and woman, top and bottom." Thus the song introduces vital questions: How can one determine the truth in an uncertain world? Are things (including humans) defined by their opposi tion to what they are not? Both questions are inextricably linked to Hedwig's primary need to find love. As Hedwig performs in a succession of Bilgewaters restaurants, site of her modern-day symposium, the staid diners function as silent interlocutors 24. All translations are from Plato.

These devices are also reemphasized in the final scene of the dialogue: 'Aristodemus couldn't remember exactly what they were saying - he'd missed the first part of their discussion, and he was half-asleep anyway - but the main point was that Socrates was trying to prove to them that authors should be able to write both comedy and tragedy" (223dl-d5). Thus the reader is re minded at the dialogue's end that the depiction of the symposium was entirely dependent on what Aristodemus could remember and how he reported it, while reiterating the value of hearing and recounting the speeches on love, especially Socrates'. 26. I am grateful to Wolfgang Haase for noting that the lyrics resonate with Ronald Reagan's famous charge to Mikhail Gorbachev in front of the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, 12 June 1987: "Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!"</page><page sequence="8">Sypniewski 565 for whom she recounts her failed transgender operation and her journey from Germany and across the US in pursuit of love. The film alternates between the depiction of contemporary events - Hedwig's performances and concur rent scenes of dramatic action within the film - and her recollection of the past related through on-stage soliloquies and rendered as narrative flashbacks.27 Hedwig's story, although autobiographic, is a myth of creation, equally im perfect and colored by memory as the events and speeches that Apollodorus recounts, one version of a story heard elsewhere. Finally, just as the Symposium uses physical progression to mirror intellectual advancement toward the truth, travel defines Hedwig's story: her physical movement parallels psychological transformation as she moves from Germany to the US, and as her band shad ows the tour of her former protege Tommy Gnosis.28 Tommy's stage name, the Greek word for knowledge in Gnosticism, chosen by Hedwig, symbolizes what she imparts to him and what she seeks for herself.29 Throughout the film Mitchell and Trask substitute Christian gnosis for Platonic philosophia to sym bolize the individual nature of Hedwig's quest for (self-)knowledge through erotic completion. Beyond framing devices, Hedwig adapts the conceptual structure of the Symposium, especially its progressive revision of the nature of eros.30 In the Symposium, the guests, suffering from the previous night's celebration, decide to drink lightly and send away the flute girl, a traditional symposiastic enter tainer, who also frequently provided sexual favors (176e4-10).31 Rejecting the 27. These past events are depicted in fantastic vignettes, often mythic or folkloric in quality. For example, when Hansel meets Luther, the film plays with the story of Hansel and Gretel, representing the sexual initiation with a candy trail that lures Hansel through a forest of rubble to Luther, part wicked witch, part big bad wolf lying in wait. Luther's menace is heightened by a long, tight shot on his mouth and gleaming teeth as he sweet-talks Hansel, emphasizing his voracious appetite and his ability to gobble Hansel up. On the prevalence of folkloric elements in Hedwig, see Dean, "'There Ain't Much Difference / Between a Bridge and Wall'" (above, n. 20). 28. Daniel M. Curiningham ("Driving into the 'Dustless Highway' of Queer Cinema," The Film Journal 5 [May 2003] http://www.thefilmjournal.com/issue5/high way.html [10 April 2007]) reads Hedwig's journey with Eve Sedgwick's formula tion of "queerness" as movement: "Queer is about being in flux; it is about moving or passing across sexualities, genders, desires and practices" (par. 1). Hed wig, in particular, "is on a philosophical tour to find her other half, a person who will compliment (sic), complete, and render her whole" (par. 8). 29. The significance of the name is clarified within the film. In a voice over, Hedwig says, "For his graduation present, I gave him his name, Tommy Gnosis, the Greek word for knowledge." For further discussion of this name, see below p. 571 and n. 46. 30. The word eros is most frequently translated as "love" since there is no English equivalent for the type of desire the term signifies. David Halperin clarifies that "by eros Plato refers not to love in the global sense in which we often intend that word but to one kind or aspect of love - or, rather to the intense desire which often goes by the name of love" ("Platonic Eros and What Men Call Love," Ancient Phi losophy 5 [1985], 161-204, on page 164). 31.

The men agree to spend the evening in conversation and accept Eryximachus' challenge to "honor the god" and "give as good a speech in praise of Love as [each] is capable of giving" (177d2-5). The six speakers praise the origins and benefits of Eros, suggestively expanding the traditional formulations of the male homoerotic relationship - a complex socio-political attachment that in troduced elite citizen young men into Athenian cultural and political life. With limited age-specific roles, it did not supplant heterosexual marriage and the production of citizen children.32 Yet within the all-male context of the party, implicitly and explicitly, the superiority of love between men is freely ex pressed in a way that challenges social norms. Both the context and structure of Hedwig echo several features of the Sym posium although with notable innovation. First, Hedwig offers a unique pic ture of a single-gender event. The main action of the film, following the musical, centers on a primarily "male" cast that features the all-male band Angry Inch, Hedwig, played by John Cameron Mitchell in drag, and her hus band Yitzhak, a former transvestite forbidden by Hedwig to dress as a woman.33 More importantly, a range of homoerotic possibilities, analogous to those presented by several speakers in the dialogue, is echoed by the many erotic roles played by Hansel/Hedwig during different stages of his/her life. Radcliff G. Edmonds demonstrates that mutability of erotic roles is essential throughout the Symposium in which "Socrates plays the role of both lover and beloved in these relationships and compels his partners [sc. Alcibiades, Agathon and Aristodemus] to do the same, breaking down the hierarchical relation and replacing it with a kind of philosophic reciprocity."34 Further, while the encomia of eros in the Symposium vary in length and tone, all no tably feature the incorporation and subversion of the previous speech, a fea 32. Representative views in the debate on idealized and real formulations of Greek homoerotic relationships can be found in Kenneth J. Dover, Greek Homosexuality, 2nd ed. (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1989); David Halperin, One Hundred Years of Homosexuality (New York: Routledge, 1991); David Cohen, Law, Sexuality, and Society: The Enforcement of Morals in Classical Athens (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991); James Davidson, Courtesans and Fishcakes (New York: Harper Collins, 1997); and Thomas K.

The film version supplements with characters whose actions were only related by Hedwig in stage performances: Luther, Hansel's first lover; and two women, Hansel's mother and Hedwig's publicist, Phyllis Stein. On stage and in the film, Yitzhak was played by the actress Miriam Shor, although her true sex was never revealed to audiences. Mitchell clarifies that "she doesn't play a transsexual; she plays a man who wants to dress as a woman... It disorients people and allows you to enter a world, where Hedwig is disoriented too" (Interview with Cynthia Fuchs [above, n. 13], par. 11). Gender and sex boundaries were further confused in the stage performances when female actresses played Hedwig in later years of the show (Whether You Like It or Not, above, n. 12). 34.

I turn now to an explication of how four of these speeches and their subsequent reappraisals are reflected in many as pects of the film: Hedwig, trying on new personas in a process of constant self-revision, adopts and then rejects several versions of love, each reflecting views of eros in the speeches of Phaedrus, Pausanias, Eryximachus and Socrates.35 Hansel and Virtuous Love In the Symposium's first speech, Phaedrus stresses the primacy of Eros who leads men to virtue while bestowing the greatest goods, with nothing better "for a young boy than a gentle lover, or for a lover than a boy to love" (178c3 5). More specifically, Love imparts guidance and infuses the homoerotic rela tionship with nobility, inspiring the erastes, the older active lover, and his eromenos, the younger beloved, with "a sense of shame at acting shamefully, and a sense of pride in acting well" (178dl-2). Further, Phaedrus posits that such lovers would make an ideal army as they will act nobly and avoid cow ardice at all costs. Each will "hold back from all that is shameful, and seek honor in each other's eyes" (178e6-7). Claiming that only an erastes, so pow erfully influenced by love, will die for a beloved (179b4), Phaedrus cites Achilles' self-sacrifice at Troy for his older lover Patroclus (179el-a7).36 In con tradiction to homoerotic norms, Achilles' actions are all the more noble: a young beloved who would willingly sacrifice himself for a lover, beyond the expected conventions of the relationship, would be held in the highest honor by the gods.37 Hence, for Phaedrus, the homoerotic relationship mutually in spires virtue, but more naturally in the lover: "And as for leaving the boy be hind, or not coming to his aid in danger - why, no one is so base that true Love could not inspire him with courage" (179a5-8). 35. Thus I omit the encomia of Agathon, on Love as Beauty, and of Alcibiades, who praises Socrates instead of Love. Although Alcibiades7 portrait of Socrates as both lover and beloved has potential resonance in Hedwig, the film's end suggests a clear break with the content of the dialogue after Socrates' discourse, as I will argue below. 36. The relationship between Achilles and his older friend and guardian, Patroclus, is not explicitly homoerotic in Homer's Iliad. However, other ancient sources, such as Aeschylus' Myrmidons, portray Achilles as the lover, despite being younger than Patroclus (Nehamas and Woodruff, Symposium [above, n. 24], 12 n.17). On homoerotic interpretations of their relationship in Homer, see W.M Clark, "Achilles and Patroclus in Love," Hermes 56 (1978), 381-396; and Carlos Es pejo Muriel, "Achilles and Patroclus in love: new contributions to Greek funeral ritual," Journal of Ancient Civilization 14 (1999), 19-25. For a queer reception of their relationship in popular form, see Andrew Callimarch, Lovers' Legends: The Gay Greek Myths (New Rochelle, NY: Haiduk Press, 2002), 101-110. 37. Here Phaedrus departs from the standard paradigm of the ancient Greek homo erotic relationship in which the younger lover is not expected to act out of love for the older lover, but rather from a position of calculated gain. Stanley Rosen (Plato's Symposium [above, n. 25], 56-57) notes that, in Phaedrus' formulation, the ero menos gains guidance and political advantage through reputation, even in the ex treme case of dying for the lover, which gives him the highest form of glory.</page><page sequence="11">568 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / December 2008 A parallel manifestation of homoerotic love is featured as a flashback in Hedwig that transports the audience to the time when Hedwig was still Hansel, a young man longing to be free of oppressive East Germany. In his first erotic encounter, Hansel meets Sgt. Luther Robinson while sunning naked on the rubble of a bombed church. The older soldier immediately begins to make advances despite the fact that he initially mistook young Hansel for a girl. Each man courts the other with age-appropriate behaviors according to ancient Greek norms: Luther plays the erastes in active pursuit, and Hansel the eromenos, the coy prize to be won. Luther's first love-gift is a bag of Amer ican Gummy Bears. Sweeter and softer than their bland East German coun terparts, they have an unusual flavor that Hansel finally identifies as "the taste of power." In the next scene, the song "Sugar Daddy" outlines Hansel's im mediate perception of the relationship that offers "the thrill of control" while he beckons Luther to woo him with a fantastic assortment of Western com mercial pleasures.38 Luther's most delicious gift is the means to escape to the US and the freedom Hansel desires. In this way, Luther aligns with Phaedrus' ideal soldier-lover: inspired by love and infused with virtue toward his beloved to aid him in any way. The next scene in the film strengthens this identification. Luther, in full military dress, meets Hansel's mother over din ner. Hansel declares succinctly: "He loves me, Mother. He wants to marry me. And get me the hell out of here." However, to marry Luther, Hansel must first undergo a gender reassign ment surgery to pass his medical exam. Additionally, he willingly takes on the female identity of Hedwig, the name of his mother who encourages the sacrifice of his manhood, affirming that "to be free, one must give up a little part of one's self." Hansel's physical and psychological feminization as Luther's lover is marked in this scene by the wig he puts on - a visual pun on his adopted name, He(a)d-wig.39 Hansel's sex change operation and feminized appearance, a metaphorical death of his masculinity, exemplifies the self-sac rifice that defines Phaedrus' virtuous love. An embodiment of eromenos' re ciprocal devotion to his erastes, it is justifiable and appropriate within the framework of the relationship: Luther, a noble guardian, liberates Hansel from the Eastern bloc and a bleak home life; Hansel, devoted beloved, kills his mas culine identity to become Hedwig. Both men briefly enjoy reciprocity in virtue, idealized as the greatest good of love by Phaedrus in the first speech in the Symposium. 38. He enumerates, "Whiskey and French cigarettes, / a motorbike with high-speed jets, / a Waterpik, a Cuisinart / and a hypo-allergenic dog. / I want all the luxu ries of the modern age, / and every item on every page / in the Lillian Vernon cat alogue." Although Hansel's material desires are flights of fancy, the song concludes with a formidable image of German national identity to articulate his innate sense of power over Luther: "It's our tradition to control, / like Erich Ho necker and Helmut Kohl, / remember him from the Ukraine to the Rhone ... Come on, Sugar Daddy, bring me home." 39.

He argues that since Aphrodite had two distinct mythic origins, she must be attended by two dis tinct versions of Eros, her constant companion. Accordingly, love can take two forms, a common and base "earthly" form that seeks only sexual gratification, an interest only in body rather than in soul (181M-6). In contrast, virtuous "heavenly" love seeks honorable action (181c2-181el). Here love is not praise worthy in and of itself; rather, it is qualified by the action it produces, and not every lover will be inspired by love to act nobly (180e5-181a6). The distinction in erotic intention that Pausanias draws may fittingly be applied to Hedwig's story. Just as the second speech in the Symposium challenges the first, the next episode in Hedwig vividly depicts how easily and quickly Phaedrus' formu lation of noble homoerotic behavior can be overturned. Just one year after the failed sex-change operation, Luther abruptly jilts Hedwig in a trailer park out side an Army base in Kansas, where she is stranded both physically and geo graphically. The scene visually emphasizes Luther's base and callous nature: he shrugs wordlessly while Hedwig, stunned, watches a lithe new eromenos struggle to carry Luther's luggage from the trailer. He personifies Pausanias' "common" sort of lover attached "to the body more than to the soul, and to the least intelligent partners, since all they care about is completing the sexual act" (181b3-6). An army of Luthers would not serve any beloved honorably In defining Heavenly Love, Pausanias claims that only the love between men, particularly an older male and an older boy, can lead to honorable action (181cl-4).40 He explains further that the Athenians support many types of ac tions that a lover performs to win a beloved while "no blame attaches to his behavior: custom treats it as noble through and through" (183b3-5). Pausa nias clearly frames the virtuous homoerotic relationship as reciprocal. Ex plaining the paradoxical Athenian custom of using attendants to shield male youths from the advances of male lovers, he argues that youth must be pro tected from the base and should not acquiesce to a suitor unless they will gain virtue (183c4-d8). The younger beloved reciprocates in virtue by devoting himself to the older partner and the education he imparts. Only when "the lover is able to help the young man become wiser and better, and the young man is eager to be taught and improved by his lover - then, and only then, when these two principles coincide absolutely, is it ever honorable for a young man to accept a lover" (184e2-4). Pausanias' model of Heavenly Love is reflected in Hedwig's next rela tionship within the film. Abandoned by Luther, Hedwig finds new inspiration in her first passion: rock music. A frumpy Hausfrau, she reinvents herself as a beautiful glam-rocker with ever-changing personae that evoke different eras 40. Kenneth Dover (ed. Plato: Symposium [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1980], 97) notes that "Pausanias will not allow 'heavenly' Eros ever to be hetero sexual," as reflected in its origins. Aphrodite Pandemia, Earthly Aphrodite, was born from the heterosexual union of Zeus and the nymph Dione; Aphrodite Oura nia, Heavenly Aphrodite, arose from the genitals of castrated Ouranos which washed ashore on Cytherea, a purely male genesis. Hence, Heavenly Aphrodite and her companion Heavenly Eros have no association with women (180d6-e2).</page><page sequence="13">570 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / December 2008 in rock and roll history.41 Soon after, Hedwig adopts the role of the erastes in a new relationship with teenaged Tommy Speck, whom she educates in music and love.42 In one of their initial encounters, Tommy questions Hedwig about Genesis. Embracing Eve's desire for knowledge, he asks Hedwig for "the apple."43 Responding to his biblical invitation, Hedwig dedicates herself to Tommy as an educator and lover. Her tutelage transforms his appearance, musical abilities, and his narrow construct of masculinity. Hedwig ousts Tommy's idols - Peter Frampton, Kansas and other hyper-masculine, long haired rockers - and introduces Iggy Pop, David Bowie and Lou Reed, 70s "crypto-homo rockers," while restyling Tommy in their androgynous image. Practicing the guitar assiduously while looking at the photo of the icons she has chosen, Tommy soon blossoms as a musician in an idyllic garden scene. In a montage of scenes, their burgeoning relationship is portrayed as a de lightful union of mentor and apprentice. Finally, when the musical talents of pupil equal those of teacher, Hedwig and Tommy are shown singing together in harmony, sharing a microphone. Hedwig partakes of the "heavenly" love as defined by Pausanias: reciprocity of virtue between lover and beloved with each obeying "the principle appropriate to him" (184d4). But this too is fleet ing. In the Symposium, Pausanias contrasts the man inspired by heavenly Eros with the image of the corrupt lover. The inspired lover is interested in older boys, ones who "have begun to form minds of their own," with whom the lover is "prepared to share everything" and "to spend the rest of his own life with him" (181d2-5). The lover "certainly does not aim to deceive him - to take advantage of him while he is still young and inexperienced and then, after exposing him to ridicule, to move quickly on to someone else" (181d5 7), exactly as Luther has done to Hedwig.44 The film further aligns Hedwig's 41. The film's persistent linking of music with ambiguity about gender and sexual ity implies a Dionysian subtext. On the late 60's rock scene and Dionysus, see Camille Paglia, Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1990). 42. Hedwig's feminine exterior may give pause in a comparison with the Greek erastes) however, while her external trappings are exaggeratedly feminine, the physical body remains predominantly male. Throughout the film frequent refer ences to and jokes about Hedwig's "angry inch" emphasize this crucial point which is unmistakable after the "drag disrobing" during Hedwig's last stage per formance. 43. The scene reflects Mitchell's own struggle with the story of Adam and Eve: "Why is God so upset that you wanted to know something, or eat of the apple? Why is that a bad thing? I never understood that. It never made sense. So, you disobeyed him, but that rule should have been disobeyed. In the gnostic tradition, Eve is connected to Jesus, as the knowledge-giver, and the creator god is not the over arching god, but an evil force, which is why the world itself is flawed. And the overarching force was an androgynous force, and Jesus and Eve are manifesta tions of that. And this idea of Adam and Eve being together and separating - the separating was the problem" (Mitchell's Interview with Cynthia Fuchs [above, n. 13], par. 16). 44. Luther's actions embody Pausanias' "common, vulgar lover, who loves the body rather than the soul, the man whose love is bound to be inconstant, since what he</page><page sequence="14">Sypniewski 571 actions with Pausanias' ideals in the scene where she first tells Tommy about her past, including her operation. The whistling sound of a bomb dropping set to Tommy's stunned look underscores the impact of this revelation. Tommy, at first undeterred, is the correspondingly ideal beloved. Modeling the pre cepts for eromenoi outlined by Pausanias, he pursues both his musical educa tion and Hedwig with passion. Their career and romance flourish; nevertheless, subsequent scenes clarify that he cannot fully reciprocate her devotion. Frustrated by the fact that Tommy "had maintained a near perfect ignorance of [her] front," Hedwig puts his hand down her skirt as they kiss passionately. Conflicted by the dissonance between his physical revulsion and emotional attachment, Tommy recoils while telling Hedwig he loves her. Hed wig counters, "Then love the front of me." Tommy runs. In the Symposium, Pausanias cautions lovers to be wary of young boys since it is uncertain "whether a particular boy will eventually make some thing of himself, physically or mentally" (181el-e3).45 This serves as a belated warning for Hedwig, whose erotic role as erastes presents further perils. Hav ing helped "the young man become wiser and better" (184d7-el), Hedwig ef fectively cultivated all aspects of Tommy's education. She even christens him with the stage name, Tommy Gnosis, to signify all that she teaches him.46 Nonetheless, Tommy betrays Hedwig. He steals the songs, the artistic prog eny of their relationship, to become a famous rock star while disavowing his debt to her. Yet another form of love eludes Hedwig. Much of the movie traces her attempts to see Tommy and gain the recognition that is her due, while she grasps for a new understanding of love. Tommy and Harmonious Love Hedwig and Tommy's failed love affair is the center of dramatic action of the rock musical and the film. Not surprisingly, many forms of eros described in the Symposium are reflected in the different stages of their relationship. Within the third speech of the Symposium, Eryximachus, a doctor, envisions eros as a broader phenomenon, omnipresent, both in body and soul, and controlling all things (186a2-b2).47 Revising Pausanias' categories of "heavenly" and "common" eros, he argues that the body exhibits two varieties of Love, and that "the love manifested in health is fundamentally distinct from the love manifested in disease" (186b7-8). He extends this metaphor to claim "medi loves is itself mutable and unstable. The moment the body is no longer in bloom, 'he flies off and away/ his promises and vows in tatters behind him" (183el-5). 45. Within the context of the dialogue, this may be an attempt to justify the socially taboo homoerotic relationship between two older men, a form of male homosex ual love not common in antiquity. Plato may have framed Pausanias' speech with arguments in keeping with his personal interests since he was well known to be Agathon's lover (Nehamas and Woodruff, Symposium [above, n. 24], 13 n. 19). 46. Mitchell chose Gnosis to evoke the idea that each person possesses an "other half," a doppelganger that has information that completes us, found in the Gnostic Gospels (Interview with Cynthia Fuchs [above, n. 13], par. 16). 47. I leave aside his parallels between astronomy and divination introduced briefly near the speech's conclusion.</page><page sequence="15">572 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / December 2008 cine is simply the science of the effects of Love on repletion and depletion of the body" (186c5-7). Eryximachus' physiological theory of eros is strikingly manifest in Hedwig. The film depicts the health and deterioration of Hedwig and Tommy's love as visible effects on Hedwig's physical appearance. In the beginning stages of their affair, Hedwig performs in a donut shop, and her transvestitism is at a peak: her features are soft, her makeup flawless, and a disco-era dress height ens her femininity.48 She is the object of desire of the men in the audience whose gazes she holds while singing the ballad, "Wicked Little Town" to Tommy. She appears similarly feminine and beautiful in pink tank top and miniskirt when Tommy professes his love in her trailer. Yet this constructed fa cade crumbles soon after Tommy abandons her, an illustration of her psy chological deterioration triggered by the relationship's failure. Embittered by Tommy's commercial success and full of rage, Hedwig performs in yet an other dreary Bilgewaters next to Tommy's packed concert stadium. Her an them, "Angry Inch," graphically narrates the harrowing operation that took her "six inches forward and five inches back." Grotesque make-up in dark unnatural colors, torn t-shirt and jagged zebra-striped pants manifest her an guish and the potential toxicity of love. Building upon his thesis that love guides medicine, Eryximachus argues that love controls even poetry and music: harmonizing opposite forces, re solving tonal discord, and creating rhythmic concord (187al-c5).49 Conse quently, music must be practiced in accordance with the heavenly form of Love, that is, with balance. "Music is therefore simply the science of the effects of Love on rhythm and harmony," and when performed basely, it is "com mon and vulgar" (187c4-e6). The harmonizing effect of love is most vividly portrayed in Hedwig during the pivotal scene between Hedwig and Tommy in her trailer. As Tommy practices a new song that he and Hedwig have written, he sings the first line again and again, repeatedly rutting a wrong note. The practice is interrupted when a neighbor croons the refrain of "I Will Always Love You" in perfect pitch. As Tommy fights frustration with his own discord, Hedwig etches his forehead with the Gnostic cross in silver make-up. Moving a mirror slowly in front of half of her face, Hedwig reflects Tommy's new image back to him. The camera shows how their faces merge from two distinct 48. Mike Potter, the film's make-up artist, sought to depict visually the power of love over Hedwig's appearance. Through meticulous cosmetics she was to transcend transvestitism (that is appearing like a man playing a woman), and instead seem truly feminine, as if transformed by love into the woman she wanted to become (Whether You Like It or Not [above, n. 12]). 49. Rosen explicates the deficiencies of Eryximachus' argument as a defense of ho mosexual love. "The medical principle he uses states that health is a harmony of opposites: hence, heterosexual love would be equated with health. If health is equated with heterosexuality, then homosexuality must be equated with disease. He tries to get around this by saying that it is right to gratify the good parts of a body and wrong to gratify the bad parts. But then this leads us to the idea that like must be with like (and is not the harmony of opposites). So either there is no nat ural principle of harmony or pederasty is not in keeping with medical doctrine" (Plato's Symposium [above n. 25] 101-102).</page><page sequence="16">Sypniewski 573 wholes into one, with complementary halves.50 Tommy soon sings the line perfectly: "Look what you've done ..." The lyrics reinforce the scene's mes sage: Hedwig has transformed Tommy. This moment immediately precedes the peak of Hedwig and Tommy's love as it is portrayed in the film - a pas sionate kiss, an intimacy for which Hedwig has longed. Their unification in love creates a musical harmony in Tommy that he did not previously possess, and Hedwig is the agent who brings him into balance. Hedwig and the Other Half The visual unification of Hedwig and Tommy's face in the mirror scene is a further depiction within the film of the idea that love is the pursuit of and re unification with the "other half." As discussed above, this concept is drawn explicitly from Aristophanes' speech in the Symposium which praises Love by clarifying its origin rather than its benefits. Before love every human being was two faced, four legged and with four arms - one half of its body com prised what is now a complete person. This race had three genders: those with two male halves descended from the Sun, the children of the Earth were dou bly female, while the children of the Moon were androgyne, half male and half female (189d6-190b4). After they attacked the gods, Zeus split them in half and ordered Apollo to turn each creature's face and neck to the wounded side "so that each person would see that he'd been cut and keep better order" (190e4-5). Feeling a great sense of longing, each half sought his or her original complement, the gender of which was determined by the original whole crea ture. When the two halves would find one another, "they would throw their arms about each other, weaving themselves together ... in that condition they would die from hunger and general idleness" (191a5-bl). Out of pity, Zeus moved their genitals around to the front of their bodies so that the androgyne would be able to reproduce, "but when male embraced male, they would at least have the satisfaction of sexual intercourse, after which they could stop embracing, return to their jobs, and look after their other needs in life" (191c6 8). Aristophanes' eros is, therefore, an essential longing for completion that clearly favors male-male pairings while accounting for all forms of sexual preference.51 The biologically and psychologically driven search for the other half as described by Aristophanes is the central metaphor used to structure Hedwig, 50. Rebecca Resinski suggests that the scene foreshadows Hedwig's self-acceptance later in the film and that any good Hedwig sees in Tommy is but a "projected re flection of herself" ("Before and Beyond Love: Hedwig and the Angry Inch and Plato's Symposium/' paper presented at the annual meeting for the American Philological Association, New Orleans, LA, 3 January 2003, 5). 51. Androgyne halves are described with an emphasis on their lecherous behavior (191d6-e2). Women are surprisingly given equal desire for other women (191e2 5). Male homoerotic relationships, rhetorically prominent as the third part of the tricolon, are described with an unusual equality, while defended against con temporary Athenian anxieties about their power to feminize, corrupt, and alien ate politically (191e6-b5). Carries ("The Myth Which Is Not One" [above, n. 21], 108-115) maintains that Aristophanes jokingly subverts traditional forms of Greek desire by creating a system that defines eros as a means to return to transgressive sexual behaviors, all but eliminating normal heterosexual relations.</page><page sequence="17">574 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / December 2008 symbolizing Hedwig's struggle to find love and a sense of wholeness.52 Threatening and powerful, Aristophanes' pre-lapsarian creatures were frac tured by divine will. In this way they serve as an archetype for Hedwig, phys ically and psychologically fragmented by surgery.53 However, Hedwig is an imperfect analog for half of the Aristophanic circle-creature, and her indefinite gender (no longer fully male, never made fully female) complicates reunifi cation with an external "other half."54 This is most clearly demonstrated in the second song in the movie, "The Origin of Love," which tells "the sad story of how we became lonely two-legged creatures." The song appropriates Aristophanes' myth and remains true to its presentation of love as an attempt to heal a painful separation.55 Hedwig sings, Last time I saw you We had just split in two You were looking at me I was looking at you You had a way so familiar But I could not recognize 'Cause you had blood on your face I had blood in my eyes But I could swear by your expression That the pain down in your soul Was the same as the one down in mine That's the pain That cuts a straight line down through the heart We call it love We wrapped our arms around each other Tried to shove ourselves back together We were making love, making love. 52. Sharon G. Dean recognizes the importance of Aristophanes' speech, but strips it from its larger philosophical context. She interprets it as a "myth about gender flux, fantastical and trenchant... rendered in humorous, almost primitive anima tion, throughout the film, providing a visual correlative for the true nature of myth and gender - as a journey, a destination, but not a location" ("'There Ain't Much Difference / Between a Bridge and a Wall'" [above, n. 20], 113). 53. The image of the divided self reappears at the end of the film but with different resonance. During her psychological collapse, tight camera shots of Hedwig singing "Exquisite Corpse" are splintered with shards of mirror to accentuate the lyrics: "I'm all sewn up / A hardened razor-cut / Scar map across my body / And you can trace the lines / Through Misery's design / That map across my body / A collage / All sewn up / A montage." 54. Hedwig's inability to be defined according to traditional categories of gender and sexual identity - neither man, nor woman, neither medically intersex nor trans gender, she cannot be properly gay or straight - is more than an academic issue for the queer and transgendered communities by whom she has been alternately embraced and rejected as an icon. For an example of the debate, see Jordy Jones, "Hedwig's Six Inches: Gender Without Genitals," Other 1 (June 2003), http: / / www.othermag.org/content/hedwig.php (22 June 2007). 55. For the complete lyrics, see Appendix below, pp. 584-586.</page><page sequence="18">Sypniewski 575 Hedwig's ballad defines love as the means to restore an essential unity, artic ulating Aristophanes' claim that "Love is born into every human being; it calls back the halves of our original nature together; it tries to make one out of two and heal the wound of human nature" (191dl-3). That this myth was learned as a bedtime story when Hedwig was still the young boy Hansel, told by his mother, emphasizes the primacy of the story to Hedwig's life as well as to her view of love as absence. While a surprisingly close adaptation of Aristophanes' speech, Trask's "The Origin of Love" globalizes the mythic pantheon, adding Norse Thor and "some Indian god" (who appears as Hindu Shiva in the accompanying ani mation), while replacing Apollo with Egyptian Osiris. A symbol of death and rebirth, Osiris is an ominous and appropriate addition to Hedwig's song. In de Iside et Osiride, Plutarch describes how Typhoeus jealously chops his brother Osiris into pieces, which he scatters throughout Egypt. Isis, Osiris' sister and consort, gathers these except for his genitals, which were thrown into the Nile and consumed by fish. To complete him for resurrection, she models a pros thetic version. Thus the mutilated Egyptian deity supplants the Greek god of music and healing. Hedwig's role as Osiris' avatar is emphasized in a later scene when she furiously reproaches Tommy for misnaming the god as "Cyrus" in his commercially successful version of the song. To deny Osiris is to deny Hedwig herself.56 The animation sequence drives home this point as the song draws to a close. A boy scrawls graffiti on a wall with lipstick: "Deny me and be doomed." In a secondary parallel, both dialogue and film suggest that sex is the means to make this reunion of lovers possible.57 However, Aristophanes' speech constructs sexual orientation as a function of biology, while Hedwig's erotic doctrine is more fluid. After performing "The Origin of Love," Hedwig muses, "It is clear that I must find my other half. But is it a he or she? What does this person look like? Identical to me? Or somehow complementary?" Each question she asks is predicated on her own self-knowledge, suggestively connecting gender and sexual identities. Although Aristophanes' myth allows for either possibility (he or she), Hedwig's nameless sex and self-identification as a woman both expand and complicate her search for love. Nonetheless, Aristophanes' myth powerfully influences the way the film presents Hedwig's vision of eros. It even brands her physically in the form of a tattoo of two interlocking faces - a yin and yang expressing the union of 56. I am grateful to the anonymous referee for IJCT who suggested this point. Tommy's full recognition of Hedwig's anatomical difference is critical to his ac ceptance of her. In a flashback, she bristles at Tommy's "near perfect ignorance of [her] front" and demands "love the front of me." See above, p. 571. 57. Paul. W. Ludwig ("Politics and Eros in Aristophanes' Speech: Symposium 191E 192A and the Comedies," American Journal of Philology 117 [1996], 537-62, quota tion on 547) asserts that Aristophanes' explicitly physical and sexual speech "clears away [the] Hgh-rninded distractions," the noble and virtuous aims of love suggested by Phaedrus and Pausanias, so that Socrates can start anew with the "true foundations of eros."</page><page sequence="19">576 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / December 2008 complementary lovers - an external emblem of her emotional longing. Hed wig thinks that she finds this completion in Tommy. When she first talks with him, she sees his eyes "are the same blue" as hers. In a later scene, their eyes are integrated visually in one face, half Hedwig's, half Tommy's, reflected in the mirror she holds (see above, pp. 572-73).58 Two pieces of the erotic puzzle are joined and, at least momentarily, Hedwig and Tommy are united through the collaborative production and performance of music. Aristophanes' words resonate: "I say there's just one way for the human race to flourish: we must bring love to its perfect conclusion, and each of us must win the favors of his very own young man, so that he can recover his original nature" (193c3-5). Rosen notes that a dangerous form of self-abnegation underpins Aristo phanes' Utopian vision of erotic unity: should halves be reunited into an orig inal whole, human nature would be lost, reverted to an earlier, barbarous state of willful self-deteiTmnation.59 For Hedwig, union with Tommy creates a sim ilarly ill-fated result. Rejected and swindled, she discovers that Aristophanes' erotic doctrine is temporary, its aim neither fully possible nor desirable. The original whole must be found elsewhere. Climbing the Ladder of Love The Symposium climaxes with Socrates' speech and a philosophic eros that transcends physicality and strives eternally for knowledge. To introduce his ideas, Socrates demonstrates that earlier speakers misconstrued Love - it does not automatically promote virtue in the lover, or the beloved, and it is not the search for a missing half - formulations of love which the narrative of Hed wig's story, as I have argued, similarly rejects in turn. Next, Socrates demon strates to Agathon that love cannot both possess and want something at the same time (199c3-201c9). To explain the intermediary nature of Eros, he re counts how Diotima, an enigmatic and powerful woman, revealed to him the true nature of love. The introduction of Diotima ruptures the ideological boundary of the evening from which women were omitted physically, and ideologically by the earlier speeches which effectively excluded women's eros.60 Her authoritative presence is all the more remarkable, since Socrates clearly ascribes the true erotic doctrine of philosophical discourse to her. As David Halperin argues, Diotima's feminine perspective allows her to propose an innovative model of male eros which is "not hierarchical but reciprocal... not acquisitive but creative," an erotic doctrine influenced by her gender that resonates vividly in Hedwig.61 58. In Phaedrus, 255c-e, Plato employs the mirror in a corresponding erotic simile that explains the way a beloved, newly experiencing eros, loves but without under standing. The beloved sees himself reflected in his lover, as if in a mirror, but is not cognizant of the reflection or its significance. I owe this passage to Carnes, "The Myth That Is Not One" (above, n. 21), 110. Maurizio Bettini (The Portrait of the Lover, trans. Laura Gibbs [Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press, 1999]) surveys ancient stories about lovers who desire an imago, including self-re flections. 59.

Born from the union of the deified personifications Poros, or "Re source," and Penia, or "Poverty," he embodies the middle ground between many antitheses: poverty and riches, wisdom and ignorance, beauty and ug liness (203b2-204c6). Plato's presentation of the daimonic force of Eros as "something in the middle" suggests a powerful form of categorical indeter minacy that may have influenced the conception of Hedwig. The film's open ing song compares Hedwig to the Berlin Wall, a symbol of division between "East and West, slavery and freedom, man and woman, top and bottom" (see above, p. 564).62 As the nameless middle between binary opposites, Hedwig both defies and concurrently enables traditional constructs of gender while possessing a unique ability to share in each. A barrier and a bridge, Hedwig tells the audience, "without me right in the middle, babe, you would be noth ing at all," evocatively claiming her power as an intermediary force akin to Di otima's Eros. Diotima next redefines the pursuit of eros from simple acquisition to "wanting to possess the good forever" (206all-12). For humans, this can only be attained by "giving birth in beauty, whether in body or in soul" (206b7-8), a mortal form of the divine immortality that Love desires (206e5-207a4). Human reproductive potential is divided between a physical pregnancy, lead ing to procreation of children, and a spiritual form - conception in "wisdom and the rest of virtue" which is born in the presence of beauty (208el-209e4). David Halperin argues that Plato first developed this extraordinary metaphor. By taking "an embedded habit of speech," he was first to re-embody it as "feminine" by associating it with the female person of Diotima through her extended use of gender-specific language, then to disembody it once again, to turn "pregnancy" into a mere image of (male) spiritual labor, just as Socrates' male voice at once embod ies and disembodies Diotima's female presence.63 Thus, through Diotima's persona and her procreative metaphor for philo sophical discourse, Socrates temporarily adopts a female voice to convey an essential part of his erotic doctrine, a form of intellectual transvestitism in the service of philosophy. Plato's unique, generative formulation of erotic desire as intellectual birth, as well as its transmission through a combination of male and female personalities, resonates vibrantly within the contemporary context of Hedwig. As they work on a new song, Tommy asks Hedwig what she thinks love is. She replies that "love is immortal... perhaps because love creates something that wasn't there before." When Tommy jokingly questions whether this is "procreation" or "recreation," Hedwig rejects specifically sexual imagery and suggests instead that love is simply "just creation." In the next scene "songs explode" from Hedwig and Tommy's collaboration, as if spontaneously gen erated by love itself.64 This creativity languishes within both as soon as they 62.

In this way, Hedwig allusively demonstrates a complex reflection of Diotima's message and medium. Hed wig's explanation of Love to Tommy refigures the content of Diotima's speech, particularly its procreative metaphor for the immortality and purpose of love. At the same time, the scene between Tommy and Hedwig described above offers a synoptic view of how Diotima functions in Socrates' speech. Hedwig's exaggerated feminine exterior, a gendered guise abandoned at the film's end, casts her as the wise priestess revealing the mysteries of love to Tommy's uninitiated Socrates.65 Concurrently, Hedwig facilitates Tommy's artistic cre ation, an intellectual midwife, who, like Socrates, enables other men in the di alogue to "give birth in beauty."66 Diotima's speech in the Symposium culminates in a challenge to the ex ternal pursuit of love. She explains to Socrates that physical forms of love, and "loving boys correctly," are but steps to climb in an ascent toward a higher form of spiritual love (211b5-6). She describes this mystery as follows: One always goes upward for the sake of this Beauty, starting out from beautiful things and using them like rising stairs: from one body to two and from two to all beautiful bodies, then from beauti ful bodies to beautiful customs, and from customs to learning beau tiful things, and from these lessons, he arrives in the end at this lesson, which is learning of this very Beauty, so that in the end he comes to know just what it is to be beautiful. (211cl-dl) Berlin where, as young Hansel, he dances ecstatically on his and his mother's bed to the song "Freaks." The song's lyrics, as well as his possession by the music, hint at his later androgynous and daimonic persona.

The film, as well as the play on which it is based, also draws upon the Gnostic Gospels to addresses the distinction between and confusion of the genders, in particular verse 22 of the Gospel of Thomas, quoted in the play manuscript: "Jesus said to them, 'When you make the two one, and the inside like the outside and the outside like the inside, and the above like the below, and the male and the female into one and the same, so that the male be not male nor the female female; and when you make eyes in place of an eye, a hand in place of a hand, a foot in place of a foot, and an image in place of an image, then you will enter the kingdom'" (Translation unknown. John Cameron Mitchell and Stephen Trask, Hedwig and the Angry Inch. Text and Lyrics [New ed. Woodstock, NY: Overlook Press, 2002], 37). 66. Edmonds ("Socrates the Beautiful" [above, n. 34], 270-77) observes that Plato in verts his metaphor of midwifery as the intellectual birth by a "pregnant" erastes stimulated by the beauty of the eromenos (cf. Tht. 149al-151e4). In the Symposium, "Socrates' presence serves as a stimulus for these youths to bring forth their own ideas, while he uses his philosophic skills to help them with the delivery" (271 72). Both formulations of the metaphor appear in Hedwig. Hedwig not only in spires Tommy's efflorescence, but also her own creativity languishes after their separation - she writes no new songs. There may be further influence of Socrates' education in midwifery by his mother on Hansel's introduction to the mythic ori gin of love by his mother, Hedwig.</page><page sequence="22">Syvniewski 579 Halperin argues that, in this formulation, "to study erotics is not merely to explore the phenomenon of sexual attraction but to inquire into the structure of reality; only a correct understanding of the nature of being will unlock the secret of our immortal longings."67 Diotima concludes by claiming that when an individual knows the Beautiful itself, only then will he be able to give birth to true virtue, not just images of virtue (211el-212bl). When her speech ends, Socrates abruptly concludes his own, suggesting strongly that Diotima was a guise assumed to add emphasis to his theory of eros. The final scenes of Hedwig, echoing both the ideas and the context of the conclusion of Socrates' speech, reinforce the poly valence of Plato's erotic doc trine within Hedwig's story. Unfulfilled by Luther, Tommy or any other "half," Hedwig abandons the external pursuit of love in the bodies and beauty of others. Unlike Diotima's truth which presents beauty and knowledge as universal principles, Hedwig's version is "relentlessly committed to the human realm and human experience": her pursuit of beauty is internal, her knowledge, specific to the self.68 Furthermore, unlike Diotima's description of ascent ever upward towards the heavens and Platonic Forms, Hedwig's in tellectual transformation requires descent and devolution before she resolves the disjuncture between the two halves of her fragmented psyche - her phys ically masculine body and her carefully constructed female facade. In a series of four scenes, Hedwig closes with an open ending that requires the viewer to reappraise the use of feminization as an agency of psychological growth. Al though there are many possible interpretations, further comparison with the Symposium reveals how the film tailors the metaphors of the text to a journey of self-discovery. In the middle of a concert, before her band and audience, Hedwig strips herself bare of all elaborate costuming, wig and makeup, the artificial means through which she fashioned her feminine identity. While the raucous music, lack of dialogue and fractured visual imagery in the scene can be read pes simistically as indicative of Hedwig's complete nervous breakdown, and the disrobing of drag costume as a loss of self, the imagery also suggests strongly catharsis and renewal. In the following scene, Hedwig appears suddenly and thoroughly deconstructed as Hansel once again in a dark, expansive space, potentially real or imagined. She stands as a mirror image before Tommy. He sings to her: Forgive me for I did not know 'Cause I was just a boy, you were so much more Than any god could ever plan More than a woman or a man And now I understand how much I took from you Well maybe there's nothing up in the sky but air And there's no mystical desire No cosmic lover, preassigned There's nothing you can find that cannot be found. 67.

Gender categorization ceases to be important: Hedwig is "so much more / than any god could ever plan / more than a woman or a man." A rejection of Aristophanes' "cosmic lover, preassigned," the lyrics also eliminate "mystical desire" for a form of self-determined knowledge. Tommy's sudden comprehension of the very things Hedwig has learned about love may be understood as the assimilation of his personality into hers, or perhaps the recognition that each individual has the potential to find such knowledge. The film, I suggest, pointedly denies the audience the satisfaction of a physical reunion between Hedwig and Tommy as the embodiment of her gnosis. Wearing the silver cross, the film's emblem of gnosis, Hedwig stares wordlessly into Tommy's eyes, then turns and walks away Their silent reconciliation serves as a metaphor for her psy chological unity, an internal completion rather than the Aristophanic union of halves. Hedwig also imbues the female persona with a generative power that can be assumed by more than one character. In contradiction to the way Diotima "depleted by Socrates,... vanishes," Hedwig's female persona lives through Yitzhak, a transvestite Hedwig married after her affair with Tommy.69 Throughout the film, as the dominant erastes, Hedwig solely enjoys sexual gratification and controls Yitzhak's artistic and personal development by re fusing to let him dress in drag and limiting his role on stage to backup singer.70 However, after the reconciliation scene, Hedwig appears on stage again, singing "Midnight Radio" with her band, undisguised, looking exactly like the young Hansel. Yitzhak subserviently attempts to put the wig back on Hed wig to reconstruct her in the only way she is known to him. Hedwig refuses and presents Yitzhak with the wig she no longer needs, releasing his hand from her embrace as a symbol of liberation from her domination. The scene il lustrates that Hedwig's internalized gnosis can guide her actions toward oth ers, beyond the self. The camera returns to Yitzhak in full drag: the wig - the emblem of femininity long denied - has magically transformed him into a beautiful, confident woman, freed to begin a journey of self-discovery. Leaving Yitzhak to revel in the audience's attention, Hedwig abandons her performance mid-song and stumbles naked into a dark alley that is illu minated at the far end. The tattoo on her hip of the interlocking profiles ap pears anew as one whole, unified face. The image may be read as an iconic negation of the premise of Aristophanes' myth: the pursuit of external com pletion yields to an integrated whole found within. The scene is silent; the camera follows Hansel /Hedwig's nude body from behind. Revelatory rather than erotic, this nudity visually synthesizes the three powerful images from 70. In scenes deleted from the film, but included on the DVD (above, n. 2), the origins of their relationship are explained. After Yitzhak, performing as "Krystal Nacht," upstages Hedwig in a drag show in a Croatian bar, he admires Hedwig and begs to be taken to America. Hedwig silently removes Yitzhak's wig, wipes the lip stick from his mouth, turns and walks away, effectively deconstructing his femi nine identity and her competition. Relegated to an inferior status, Yitzhak scrambles along behind Hedwig, carrying her bags. The image evokes Luther's young lover departing from the trailer park in Junction City.</page><page sequence="24">Sypniewski 581 Diotima's speech.71 First, it reminds the audience that ontological insights have not altered the physical reality of the body. It is still "something in the middle," leaving Hedwig's gender (and how she defines it) a mystery. Sec ondly, Hedwig's slow progress through the narrow shadows toward the light, a metaphorical birthing scene, depicts Diotima's description of male spiritual labors. Finally, nudity reveals the outcome of those labors. Hansel no longer hides behind the defense of Hedwig's facade; his acceptance of his nude body represents psychological growth.72 Thus feminine identity for Hansel /Hed wig has functioned much as Diotima for Socrates in the Symposium: a "sym bolic language employed by men in order to explain themselves and their desires to one another across generations."73 The film's closing scene, however, opens a philosophic dialogue beyond Platonic doctrine. As Rebecca Resinski has argued, by refusing to categorize Hansel/Hedwig as either man or woman, the end of Hedwig is a "trial bal loon" of Georgia Warnke's proposition that the removal of gender catego rization may enable a richer variety of features used to define human identity.74 Mitchell corroborates this interpretation: "Hedwig walks out into the world naked and whole because she doesn't see herself as half a man or half a woman, but both - and it's a good thing."75 And in true Socratic fashion, the film suggests that the answer to one question (What is Love?) simultaneously opens a new philosophic investigation (What is Gender?). Conclusion In discussions of Hedwig, Mitchell and Trask's lyric and visual translation of Aristophanes' speech has not gone unnoticed or unappreciated: since the early versions of the stage show, pop culture and mass media outlets ranging widely across music, film, theater, and queer studies have recognized that "Aristophanes Rocks."76 The story's dependence on Plato gained even greater attention with the film's release in 2001, and still continues because of Hedwig's 71.

Nearly every article, review, or interview observes Hedwig's debt to</page><page sequence="25">582 International Journal of the Classical Tradition / December 2008 status as a cult film.77 Academia, too, has embraced Hedwig, predominantly in the fields of sexuality and queer studies, but also in music and film, or some intersection of these.78 Yet even here, Plato usually figures as side note.79 Given the recognizable centrality of the Symposium to the creative genesis of Hedwig and the flourishing area of film studies within Classics, there has been sur prisingly little disciplinary interest in Plato's larger influence on the film, and relatively little appears in print.80 This may be due, in part, to Mitchell and Trask's sometimes free-wheeling and blatantly homosexual reading of the di alogue. H. Christian Blood aptly notes that the "good-faith mis-reading" of Stephen Trask, the openly gay lyricist for Hedwig, illustrates "how the queers - and the readers of Plato who are outside of the academy - are super-queer ing Plato."81 He quotes Trask on the premise of the Symposium: All the great fag writers and thinkers in Greece were all coming to dinner with their boyfriends on their arms, and they're all too wasted from the night before to do any more drugs or drink or party at all, except for Socrates, who, as far as I can tell, is tripping his brains out and spinning in a circle in the driveway. And they're all going to sit around, and someone says, "Why don't we talk about where love comes from, what love is." And Aristophanes tells this story that is in "The Origin of Love."82 Plato, although usually without much discussion.

It carries the threat of ideas, and ideas are much harder to sell. We fear that they will bore us (philosophy), corrupt us (Greek love) - or both."86 Whether or not we take this as the full ex planation for the popularity of Rome over Athens in film, one way to appre ciate Mitchell and Trask's collaboration is for its unabashed and outrageous provocation of audiences to engage with a cinematic version of Greece both philosophic and erotic. Through structural parallels, implicit thematic echoes and explicit cre ative reception, Hedwig and the Angry Inch gives a modern voice to questions raised in Plato's Symposium, itself an innovative, even revolutionary, deliber ation on the origin of love, its nature and purpose. As the film traces the phys ical and psychological development of Hansel/Hedwig, it evokes the various forms of eros in the speeches of the Symposium, dramatizing for contemporary audiences an inventive and powerful reception of the dialogue - a gender bending vision of love that transcends physicality and seeks ultimately to as cend to a form of gnosis. lens" ("'There Ain't Much Difference / Between a Bridge and a Wall'" [above, n. 20], 112-15, quotation on 113). 83.
