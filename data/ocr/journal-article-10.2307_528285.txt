<plain_text><page sequence="1">ORACLE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT BY ELIHU GRANT Haverford College How did man come by the notion that God speaks, or that he communicates with human beings after the analogy of man's revela- tion of himself to man through the senses ? An answer to this ques- tion would bear upon prophetic and poetic inspiration, theophany, oracle, and prayer. It relates itself to the mysterious processes of all intellectual communication whether between humans or between God and humans. The God who hears and speaks is one of the useful anthropomorphisms bequeathed to us by an early world. The God who sees and is seen did not fare so well, as a complete sensuous figure, among the Hebrews, at least. "Thou God seest me" persisted as one of the most helpful of religious and ethical concepts but the vision of the deity scarcely survives the prophets. It has been suggested that all oral communications between the divine and the human are divisible into two classes, roughly dis- tinguishable as theophanic and oracular, that the recorded experi- ences of human-divine intercourse are either, cases in which the divine took the initiative or those in which the human agent took the initiative. This may prove to be a false division and no distinction at all. Popular thought, to be sure, tends to conceive of human- divine relations under some such twofold classification. Folk- tradition sometimes suggests that the theophanic precedes the oracular because that seems to be the order of dignity which is itself a logical order. In the great world of nature is not man anticipated, appar- ently, by the powers outside himself ? In the more subjective world of thought and reflection it may be possible that man creates, finds his way, simulates nature, and reveals to himself a relationship to the greater world. It is at least commonly thought that nature suggests, teaches, and acts as mother and that man learns and appeals. But theophanies have also been recorded as following the human approach to, or presence in, a shrine, or in an act of appeal or worship. Being in a way of duty, or service, or worship, or actual oracular appeal, 257</page><page sequence="2">258 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES "the Lord met him" (cf. Gen. 32:1). We should, perhaps, not be far wrong in subsuming the theophanic under the oracular, so far as the nature of experience goes. The order of experience seems to be Nature, Oracle, Theophany. In the light of these considerations, if we ask the question, "Did the divine lead off in communication, or did man invent the concept of divine speech ?," we discover that we must separate for the time between the absolute or metaphysical aspects of the question and the historical facts or phenomenal order. Our present inquiry is of the latter kind and concerned with the historic origin of experiences and notions. It is exceedingly difficult to assure ourselves that we have the data for tracing man's experience in audience with the universe. By the time the human animal had become reflective he was already an ardent cultivator of the resources about him and a too suggestive interpreter of natural phenomena. When we consider the nature of the mind it would appear as if, in the courtship between man and nature, man was reprehensibly the aggressive one; he provided both question and answer, or to change the figure, he was inclined to stage the entire play and act all the parts, finding now and then, however, that it was necessary to dodge if his mountains, or sky, or other properties threatened to fall upon him. He felt moreover the impulse to impute a soul like his own to all the figures about him. We cannot take testimony from that which is early in time so we turn hopefully to that which is remote or primitive in space and hunt eagerly among the simple-mannered for something analogous with early mankind. But the analogy does not hold perfectly, though it is probably one of our best aids. Our next recourse is to the growing child but the speed with which he accomplishes his phases and the constant interference with his processes by adults makes it difficult to appraise the data. In despair we turn to the behavior of the lower animals, but that is too much of a good thing, carrying us too far back. The portion of the human diary which we need is defaced. We are able to observe man's reactions to the pangs of hunger, to cold, heat, moisture, and drought. His organism responds as many plants do to needs from within and to supply from without. All supplies must yield to the laws of assimilation within the organism dr they fail to help it sustain life. Sooner or later we are led to see that man is himself a member</page><page sequence="3">ORACLE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 259 within nature and the introducer of problems. Questions rise within him and because of him. The mind for which alone the problems of nature exist is itself of nature and its ultimate problem. The first motions and noises of man's experience are probably within himself though memory fails to record them and inclines to suggest outside sources. At some stage in development man began to name things and to account for them. He did this very largely on the basis of conscious, personal experience of a too subjective kind perhaps, but how else could he proceed ? Reflection has been busied ever since with the fast accumulating data of observation and inter- pretation, seeking to bring truth and order into being for the mind. Reflection could not begin without data and it cannot rest until the material has been tested and organized. The sights and sounds of nature must early have suggested to animistic mankind realms of invisible being dealing with man. If man formed the conception of communication between the parts and spirits in nature he had plenty of prompting thereto in his own constitution and in human experience about him. Religious history makes it clear that expectation is likely to have what it wants or an acceptable substitute. Once expectation 'is aroused, gratification in some form or degree is certain to follow. If the fashion of the day is for glossolalia, voices, portents, fainting fits, etc., according to our instructed wishes, the experience that is in current demand is the experience that will prevail. The prior question is, "How [i.e., by what stimuli] was the expectation born; what direc- tion and quality did it show ?" If nature is in any degree considered divine, then experience is to that degree a continuing theophany. If gods are anywhere in nature they may occasionally be met, or fail- ing that, expected. Nature is more eloquent to some souls than to others and, often the favored ones are more eloquent or forward persons. As in the case of the material resources of nature, fire, food, metals, etc., man at some stage began to seek and to try to control the oracular resources. He wished to have them in readiness against need. Such intangible resources seemed often to be connected in some hidden way with the tangible. Fountains, trees, and many objects, places and creatures were vocal. Man learned the orthodox methods of search for the more spiritual goods of the world. It would</page><page sequence="4">260 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES appear that the oracle was the apex and consummate achievement of a cycle of religious investigation carried on through all but incon- ceivable times and toils. It may have been the historical era's inheritance from the prehistoric ages. Professor Toy thought that "in general, the organization of oracular shrines grew in proportion to the rise of manlike gods-deities whose relation to men was socially intimate."' The experience of communication with the divine is, in its attempt and consummation, one of the most fruitful practices in man's reli- gious history. The effort runs the gamut, animism, fetishism, magic, divination, oracle and prayer. Oracle seems to be the central term of these. Excluding the last, it is the most articulate and it seems to be the norm upon which prayer was expanded. As with the tele- scope and microscope man seeks to extend his vision, and with teleph- ony he seeks to extend audition, so with oracle he has sought to extend his range of counsel. Oracle is a case of what Marett calls transvaluation of culture or a devulgarization of value.2 Oracle has persisted and is found today, often changed into some of the finest forms of religious activity. The ancient interpretation of theophanic and oracular usage was based upon too small a knowledge of man's physical and mental nature. It belonged to the current anthropomorphisms. Science and religion today make out a different case. But we still use many of the naive concepts of early man as symbols of our different ideas and explanations. We still speak figuratively of the voice of nature, the voice of the divine. Once this poetry was realistically employed. Indeed, modern mystical writers claim the substance of that which mystics in all ages have held, viz., direct access to the divine and the reality of communication, vision, and even, in cases, audition, etc. "All religions depend for their origin and continuance directly upon inspiration, that is to say upon direct intercourse."3 The same author (p. 113) quotes, approvingly from Brierly: "A saintly life makes a man an auditory nerve of the Eternal."4 Professor Jones 1 Introduction to History of Religion, ?927, p. 426. 2 Psychology and Folklore, p. 99 and Chap. v. 3 R.

The prophet suppressed his reason to become a passive lyre for the Spirit and whatever might come through his lips in this state was oracular. .... It was the oracular prophecy of Dodona and Delphi in a new dress and baptized with a new name."' In the Preface to his volume on Muhammad, Margoliouth speaks of the value, in his own investigations, " of biographies of persons who have convinced many of their fellows that they were in receipt of divine communications" (p. vii). Present-day followers of psychical research and spiritists readily credit the better ancient oracles and their prophets with success in efforts to reach objective reality and to sustain real communication therewith. There have been a few among physicists and psychologists who have inclined to similar opinion but who cannot be said to have converted their brethren. As would be expected, Frazer's massive collections in The Golden Bough have material illustrating our theme though his larger interest is in another direction. He might well add a volume to the series and entitle it "The Speaking God." Tylor gives us valuable notes and reflections. Vocal trees, winds, birds and insects, earth- quakes, springs, wizards, apparitions as in dreams, ghosts and spirits are well known in the rich lore of peoples. "It is as widely recognized among mankind that souls or ghosts have voices as that they have visible forms, and indeed the evidence for both is of the same nature. Men who perceive evidently that souls do talk when they present themselves in dream or vision, naturally take for granted at once the objective reality of the ghostly voice and of the ghostly form from which it proceeds. .... The more modern doctrine of the subjec- tivity of such phenomena recognizes the phenomena themselves but offers a different explanation of them."2 Tylor notes that such ghostly sounds as chirping, murmuring and whistling are the appropriate voices of ghosts and spirits and reminds us of the classical instances of murmuring and twittering mentioned in the Iliad, 23: 100, and 1 Op. cit., pp. 48 ff. 2Tylor, Primitive Culture, I, 452.</page><page sequence="6">262 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES in Ovid, Fast. V: 457,1 and the Isaianic passages (Isa. 8:19; 29:4). Data flow in from investigations the world around to show that sincere and pretended wizardry abounds and that the prophetic frenzy and other psychic states are held in high regard by those who would seek guidance. Epileptic fits are suffered or simulated. Ven- triloquism is employed. Hysteria, idiocy, and madness are made to serve the purpose. In Kamchatka there are female shamans. Fijian priests give divine answers. Oracles are given in the Sandwich Islands by the shrill cries supposed to issue from the god Oro. In China, mediums thought to be possessed are available for divination purposes while in the Australian wilds "demons whistle in the branches, and stooping . . . . seize the wayfarer." "In Tahiti. .... men who in natural state showed neither ability nor eloquence, would in . . . . convulsive delirium burst forth into earnest, lofty declama- tion, declaring the will and answers of the gods and prophesying future events in well-knit harangues full of the poetic figure and metaphor of the professional orator. But when the fit was over and sober reason returned, the prophet's gifts were gone."2 The same authority cites cases of Indians who through fasting become especially susceptible to apparitions, sounds, etc., and thus qualified to act as guides to life for their clients. Tylor finds a similar animistic origin for sacrifice and prayer, "as prayer is a request made to a deity as if he were a man, so sacrifice is a gift made to a deity as if he were a man."3 "Prayers, from being at first utterances as free and flexible as requests to a living patriarch or chief, stiffened into traditional formulas whose repetition required verbal accuracy."4 This, we think, neither Tylor nor any other author has made out. All analogy and the very data so carefully gathered convince us that prayer was learned at first through what was essentially oracular practice and always had a certain stateliness and awesome manner in its early instances. Prayers negligee are a sign of decadence and not of primitiveness. A simple sacrifice of a creature accompanied by a petition, or the mere act of killing accompanied by a word though scarcely more than a breath, or the calling of a potent name with no specification of desires, or such an act as that of Hannah (I Sam. 1: 13), 1 Text C.

Law and medicine have their ancient analogies in the decisions and healings for which the gods were besought at oracle-seats. Laws need the oracular quality for their greater dignity and we know that dicta resembling legislation very closely have grown up from shrinal practice. The frequent claim of law to a divine origin (cf. Moses, Solon, Hammurabi, etc.) joins it in some way, in tradition at least, to our conception of oracle and theophany. Before there was a science of medicine there was an art and when this latter was in the control of priests and shamans it was often a curious mingling of magic with common-sense. The art reached high achievement among the Egyptians and Greeks whose observations laid the bases for more scientific study. Prophecy is connected with oracle. This is apparent in the earlier forms of prophecy. The attendant at the shrine or the custodian of the images and other instruments of oracular practice seem to have a primitive priestly function but the interpreter of omens is associated in our thought with prophetic activities. These two offices were often lodged in one. "Communion" and "guidance" in their ancient guise were products of the oracle. For the early peoples of the Levan- tine area, Semitic and others, the world seemed peopled with the seen and the unseen much as the present Arabs fancy the presence of jinns, afrits, ghouls, angels, and shaytans quite as real as humans. The desert places hold many apparitions and demons and the wilder- ness and sown lands are spirit inhabited.' Thesefantastic folk were familiar to Hebrews, Assyrians, and Babylonians and gave rise to the queer shapes of dragons, satyrs, griffins, whether pictured or told. The natural good and evil of man's world was augmented by this uncanny population. Blessings and trouble, sickness, luck, annoy- ance, and timely aid had unseen causes. Magical practices and secret powers were joined. These powers were conceived in ranks and stations, the most dignified being represented, among Semites of all ages, by the concept of ilu, el, ilat, allah, elohim. Each tribe or 1 Ed. Meyer, Gesch. d. A. I, p. 368 .</page><page sequence="8">264 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES nation was dependent for existence upon its true conception of this folk-,endowing power usually designated by a name that became also the name of the people. Such were the folk and deities, Assur, Amurru, Edom, Gad, Abram, Nasr. Sometimes it was an ancestral name that was indicated as borne by this power. The power or powers, for they were numerous and frequently associated in groups, often appear to be abstractions of man's experience with the forces of nature and his superstitious fears of what might befall him there. Anything weird, fantastic, lunatic or mad in humans was attributed to this world of the unseen. Disease was so accounted for and ecstasy was plainly derivable not from the ordinary certainly, there- fore from the extraordinary. Order came into this spiritual welter and clearer notions of its control produced rituals, cults, and theol- ogies. We know that in Greece this regulating service was ren- dered by the oracles. "A great part of the function of the oracles in Greece was to instruct the worshipper to what deity, under what particular name he should pray."' The proto-Elijahs of Semitic peoples led their clans to discriminate and to become fierce partisans of the better ways (Exod. 34:12 f.; I Kings 19:10). They enjoyed the ecstatic states in which they believed themselves to be in "imme- diate converse with God" which was to them "the subjective attesta- tion of their vocation." HithnabbA meant in Hebrew "to behave as a prophet" also "to behave madly."2 (I Sam. 18:10). The tendency and frequent effect of oracle practice in Greece and of prophecy in Semitic lands was to disclose a person who though not a monotheist was a partisan of a single deity. The specialization of service thus induced was eventually suggestive of monotheism. Any degree of selective devotion and interpretation afforded a mental fulchrum, a tangible measure and standard which helped the servant of the cult to secure bearings and orientation in the vast field of ancient observation and superstition and thus to make possible a real advance looking toward the emancipation of philosophy, medi- cine, law, and other branches of knowledge. Unusual fulness of detail is obtainable concerning the cultivation of oracles in those lands of which we have literary remains. This is 1 Farnell, Cults of the Greek States, I, 35. SN61ldeke, Sketches from Eastern History, p. 7.</page><page sequence="9">ORACLE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 265 notably so in the Levantine countries. In larger Syria, Cilicia, in Hellenic lands and almost anywhere in the brilliant arc of the eastern Mediterranean the examples multiply. These reveal all the grades of sincerity and naivete, of dignity and hocus-pocus. The principle underlying the false and the honest is discernible. So eager are the people at times and in places to be gratified with the ideal which they have proposed that they do not take even the simplest means to detect fraud. So sincere often are the devotees and custodians of shrines that they are doubtless misled without fraud being intended. So dignified and of such proved worth through ages are the results of the oracular that it would be a hardy person indeed who would suggest anything but divine validity. Note for example in Syria the use of the image of the bearded Apollo, perhaps a form of Hadad' for oracular purposes. When carried by the attendants (priests) it led them in directions of its choice and signified answers favorable and unfavorable by a forward or retrograde motion. It "was known to leap from one priest to another or rise up into the air spontaneously." In fact, it seems to be the earliest analogue of the ouija board. It may have been the same deity whose temple at Heliopolis was an oracle seat,2 under the name of Jupiter Heliopolit- anus. Written questions were submitted and answers written in hexameter measure were vouchsafed.3 Measures and verse made the oracular responses more impressive, as Philostratus noted4 although as he remarks they might as well have been in terse prose. In a similar manner the pagan Arabian augurs gave oracles in the form known as the saj.5 Jaribolus at Palmyra suggests one of those numerous Bels of Western Asia. His was a fountain-oracle. At Daphne ecstatic priests presided at an oracle and answered inquirers. At Gaza was Marnas, at Abydos the god Besa, on Mount Carmel a sanctuary stood in the open under the sky, and there was also the well-known shrine on Mount Casius. The catalogue could be made a long one. The traditional remains weave about the lands of Canaan-Palestine with a fairly similar oracle-practice, the similarity is but thinly disguised by the different Greek and Latin names given I According to Macrobius; vide Bouchier, Syria as a Roman Province, p. 261.

A strong impression is made of an indigenous oracle cult preceding all the historic faiths. "In Assyria religious visions and oracles played an important part, constituting a regular means of communication between man and the gods. Oracles were sought by Esarhaddon, Ashurbanipal and the kings in general upon all sorts of occasions, public and private."' "Where conflicting claims arose within the community, they might be settled (perhaps) by an appeal to the oracle of the god Hubal, whose minister decided by the drawing of arrows; or the opinion of a sorceress might be asked. These sibyls indeed play a rather important part in the early history of Arabia, combining the professions of lawyer, phy- sician, and priest, they yet enjoyed little respect."2 Dillman com- ments on Gen. 25:22: "It is implied that there already existed places where divinely inspired responses were given or that there were seers and priests of the true God to whom people might apply for explana- tion and advice in such circumstances."s In Gen. 14:7 we have "the well of decision." Professor A. T. Olmstead has called my attention to a rarely valuable reference in II Kings, chapter 16, where in con- nection with Ahaz's introduction of the Assyrian worship and a new altar, mention is made of the use to be made of the brazen altar. The king says to Urijah the priest "but the brazen altar shall be for me to inquire by" (II Kings, 16: 15; cf. 1:2). There is a strong family likeness noticeable in all the oracle cults in the Levant when we consider the objects sought and the lesser tools of the practice. Naturally drought was a common experience and the need of rain a common burden of inquiry everywhere in that part of the world, as in the case of Elijah on Carmel. Musical instruments are frequently met with from the time of Saul onward. Priests, lots, entrails, arks, garments, cups, rods, altars, torahs have a strong likeness as one looks about the field of eastern motives and methods for approaching the divine powers in the perplexities of life. Religion whenever oracular was often a practical work-a-day means to the accomplishment of human desires. On the one side of our central term, oracle, the investigation dis- closes the lower ranges of magic and divination and on the other the 1 J. M. P. Smith, The Prophet and His Problems, p. 6, and M.

The oracles organized both these sides and continued their use in some form. As societies or individ- uals retrograde they still tend to employ magic, divination, clairvoy- ance. As they progress the ideals connected with sacrifice, prayer, and communion are refined. The ideal underlying all these grows, perhaps, from the instinct for fellowship. It is the range of this con- ception, viz., that men may voice the meanings of the gods, or gather that voice in multitudinous ways, times, and places, that is so amaz- ing. "There is historical continuity between Shamanism and the heights of mystical rapture."' We shall hope sometime to have a better understanding of the rise of the conception of converse between God and man. To say that it is an anthropomorphism built upon an animistic philosophy is not completely satisfactory. Man who makes and understands articulate sounds naturally draws the analogy that other beings in the world are making similar sounds when he hears the "voices of nature" and he comes to believe that dertain of those beings or forces are gods.2 But this does not cover the case. Not only have we in the Old Testament, for example, reports of rational discourse by the deity, the content of which is analogous with human reflections and possibly evolved from the conception of divine sounds, but we have the accounts of conversations between God and man, in the Hebrew language. Such ideas which are commonplace in the scriptures and in different religions must have had a rise rather different from the primitive animistic source mentioned above. These are conceptions which when once possessed go on to complicated refinement, but we suggest that the concept of conversation at its simplest is not an immediate corollary of sound or voice. At some point in the spiritual history of man somebody entered upon the new concept, either that God spoke to him (essentially theophanic), or that he himself ventured to speak to the deity and that response was afforded which was either thought to come in an actual word, or was symbolized in terms of language (essentially oracular). The reporters of human-divine conversations have perhaps ever been divided between those who took that way of describing the experience, either as a figurative, or as a 1 Coe, Psychology of Religion, p. 266. 2 Cf.

We know how easy it is to use the concept in a thoughtless way and how narrow is the dividing line between reverence and irreverence in this subject. As has already been indicated, the question whether the Hebrews thought that it was a man or a deity who made the first advance in fact to the other, is an interesting one. But the nearer problem in historic time is whether there were in Hebrew practice numerous occasions when man frankly used oracle means to secure help and advice. If he did then we probably have echoes of such a custom in the Hebrew scriptures. If at any time oracle practice was known and customary it would be easy to see how writers of the day would incline to project it into their accounts of past times which may or may not have known it. If there was one time more likely than another when a practice of oracles similar to the practice among other Levantine peoples was carried on among the Hebrews that time was during the period from Moses to Samuel. This has been freely acknowledged in one way or another by modern writers.1 It is not meant that oracles began with Moses nor ended with Samuel but it seems reasonable to suppose that that was their flourishing period when they had the full sanction of the best minds of the nation. Oracles continued to be used long after Samuel's age, but Israel by that time was entering on the age of the greater prophets whose remarkable personal consciousness was to supersede in importance the service of the prophetical attendants at the oracle seats. And following the prophets came the priestly class of legalists and his- torians who worked out the constitution, ritual, and revised literary monuments of the Jews. These priests in their turn were more scientific and important than the type of priest which used to preside at the oracle seats. Though the color of oracular practice is often missed in our Old Testament literature that literature is nevertheless instinctively oracular. The oracle style was never lost but rather augmented in successive literary schools and descended to all three of the Semitic 1 Moses "took up his abode at Kadesh, the old centre of the Leah tribes and devoted his life to the consolidation of the results that he had already achieved. Here he estab- lished an oracle of Yahweh which was consulted in all disputes between tribes and between individuals and through it he gave decisions that carried with them the formidable sanc- tions of religion. These oracular decisions (toroth) soon constituted a body of precedents on which later jurisprudence depended."-L. B. Paton, Early History of Syria and Pal- estine, p. 142. Vide T. J. Meek, in AJSL, XXXVI, 118, certifying Wellhausen.</page><page sequence="13">ORACLE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 269 religions. Two things happened. Under the strong influence of the oracle habit the literary workers of the schools of prophets and priests wrote up the ancient past as if in those days the saints had much easier access to the divine counsels and the prophetic teachers and leaders deepened the tendency to couch all their leadings through any sense or medium whatever in the forms of a divine voice speaking in their inner consciousness. The habit of speaking to God and listening to the words of God has fastened on their successors until it seems the perfection of orthodoxy to account for most spiritual leadings through the figure of the sense of hearing and it seems strange, to say the least, when any religious enthusiast nowadays says that he or she has visions or tangible evidence of the divine, while to taste or smell the powers would generally be abhorrent to piety (Ps. 34:8, "taste and see that the Lord is good"). We find trace of a suggestion of the medium of taste in Ezekiel (3:1-3), of smell in Gen. 27:27,1 and of touch in Isaiah (6:7) and Jeremiah (1:9) and must remember the testing of the fleece, wet and dry (Judg. 6:36-40). But sight and hearing are the more usual senses employed and among the Hebrews hearing is the more favored. Sight might have led more often to idolatrous practices. This latter consideration would have had more weight in the Deuteronomic age and later. Among the Levantines the oracle was a potent factor in guiding the people in their thinking and acting. Back of the idea of oracular revelation was a conviction of unseen powers vouchsafing signs of guidance, whether by voice, word, burden, message, torah, or other symbol. While the senses were the media the mind used several con- cepts notably that of space because perhaps it seems more sensuous. Place or an occurrence or object in space would include tree, spring, cave, mountain, spot of ground, bush, storm, lightning, rock, building, altar, pillar, shrine. The thought of place is easier than that of time. Later, the concept of time was drawn on as in Sabbath, Holy Days, Sunday, seasons, etc. To the writers of the Bible, Palestine of the past and the past itself were much more oracular than their present experience.

The tendency has persisted to this hour of speaking of the ages of the great saints as times of easy converse with heavenly powers. The more remarkable thing is the claim that such an experience of communication is actually achieved in the present consciousness of spiritual folk and to this day scores of persons may be found who habitually think and talk of guidance in the terms of the favored sense of hearing and give us to suppose that they are in receipt of revelations of this order. They have in their habitual religious description reduced all the media, or pretty largely so, by which divine powers influence us, to this one expression and figure. When we examine the Old Testament scriptures in order to set forth the data concerning divine speech we are confronted with various documents and layers of tradition. - We need to sort the testimony according to its class or period and to ask within each class, how near to the experience described does the author stand, and what can be said of the sources which he employs ? We remember the character- istic types of literature and the varying strands of the Jehovist, Elohist, Deuteronomist, Priest, and Chronicler. A comparison of Genesis 1 and 2 is suggestive of the preliminary literary problem. These chapters treat of the same general subject and represent two periods of Hebrew thought as far apart as our date is from that of Columbus. The first chapter is later. In it God is more often repre- sented as speaking than in the second chapter where divine activities are described without an indication of utterance until 2:16 where "Jehovah God commanded the man." This difference in the chap- ters is typical of what a comparison of "J" and "P" discloses and we incline to think that the excess of instances of divine speech in the first chapter is due to cogitation rather than to further enlighten- ment as to objective facts. When such a transcendental document as "P" permits more frequent reference to the divine as speaking than "J" in treating of the same theme we attribute the difference to style of thought and writing rather than to source information. Had we the sources used by the second chapter we should discover whether they were more or less reserved in attributing speech to the divine being. This point becomes especially important in the narrative</page><page sequence="15">ORACLE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 271 after the eleventh chapter of Genesis. Our inclination to use the second chapter more confidently for the special item of information we are seeking is somewhat affected by the consideration that it, too, is a more or less cogitative piece. In the outside mythical lore we notice similar reserve concerning divine speech. In the Babylonian Creation Epic, tablet I, the first utterance of any kind is Tiamat's roar, then Apsu cries and speaks. In another account, in which Marduk is represented, he speaks a little earlier, perhaps, in the course of the narrative. The broken condition of the early lines in the epic makes these remarks less significant.' The history of sources must necessarily be obscure as we seek to penetrate back of "J" and "E," neither of which are primitive but simply early. The early stories in Genesis helped to answer many questions concerning the fundamental relationships of life. Such questions were something like the following. Whence arise the axiomatic common stores of man's wisdom, the unwritten laws of ethics which soon or later reach codified form ? Moderns would answer with the aid of the concept of evolution working in experience. Ancients, as many orientals to-day, would say that they come from God, spoken through accredited agents. Such an answer is given in Genesis 2 and 3, mixed with aetiological accounts of the phenomena of experience. We shall gain clearest ideas of the thought of each period of Hebrew history if we study the literatures in the order of age. The JE age, if so it may be called, covers the period from about 900 to 650 B.C., from the separation of the Hebrew kingdoms to the eve bf the newer prophecy of Josiah's day (250 years). The Deuteronomic age runs approximately from 650 to 500. The Priestly age from 500 to the flourishing period of the school which compiled the books of Chronicles, Ezra, and Nehemiah, sometime in the third century B.c. The thought of both the J and the E writers as reflected in our documents was realistic, dramatic, anthropomorphic, but in varying degree, according to the different components and strands. Never- theless, it generally shows remarkable reserve and complete reverence. It does not merely recount tales of the long ago when the divine and the human conversed together nor suggest that the privilege was 1 See also the completer Assyrian version.

It indicates that such a privilege was accorded to the most favored or important mortals and that it was after the analogy of some practice of which the JE age had a nearer experience. What was that practice, probably current, which pro- vided the forms and gave the analogy according to which those more ancient conversations were conceived ? Our thought is that it was current oracular practice which gave illustration and set the forms for much of the literary anthropomorphism. While the J and E schools were composing their histories, the custom of referring many questions to representatives of the deity at various seats and shrines was still in vogue. People went to God, i.e., they went to Bethel and Shiloh and other places where God was more readily approached because a priest, or seer, or prophet or the instruments of consulta- tion were there. Thither they took their troubles, questions, and gifts. The idea of the speaking divinity is a part of the anthropomorph- ism which prevails generally in religious thought and language. It was common with all the Levantine peoples, Greeks, Hebrews, and others. In Homer, the gods and goddesses talk as freely with humans as they do in the earlier Hebrew scriptures. Later Greek writers as they developed the drama gradually gave up the concept. Among the Hebrews, throughout the schools, the fashion of putting words into the divine mouth prevailed but the realism of the instances diminished. The concept of the speaking divinity in later Greece had to do chiefly with the oracles.' It is well to remember that most of the Hebrew literature remaining to us from the JE age in Pales- tine is of the prophetic type and temper. It is fairly clear that the prophetic function was developed in some relation to a practice of investigation, consultation, seership, and at seats, shrines, and oracle centers where prophet and priest may at first have been scarcely dis- tinguishable but were gradually differentiated as a custodian is differentiated from an interpreter. But the prophetic group came to expect that God would speak in the inner consciousness enabling them to speak authoritatively. When, however, they described the remote past they loved to picture it under the forms of a society of which God was audibly and, occasionally, visibly a member. The 1 Cf. Acts 14:12.</page><page sequence="17">ORACLE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 273 nearer past, as said, was essentially oracular. 'Either their sources told of oracles or else much current practice made that an accustomed and expected form. Not until Hezekiah, or, possibly Josiah, was there any prophetic antipathy to oracles as such. The objectors would be a small group in any case. The most that we can say is that the prophetic literature proceeded from a group which was not prejudiced in favor of continued use of oracles. The accounts in the Bible often preserve but one side of an oracu- lar experience, say the divine response, taking for granted the mechan- ism of approach, much as religious people will often refer to results of guidance without necessarily making mention of prayer and other acts of worship Wvhich may have preceded. A complete oracular event would include the approach of a suppliant or consulter to a certain seat with gifts and petitions and the receipt of responses. All of these items appear in the Old Testament. But usually we have a divine utterance with accompaniments which would suggest the fuller event in certain instances. The oracular habit of speech persisted in the presentations of ancient words of wisdom, a few of which may have descended to us in a poetic form which reflect actual oracle seats and interpreters. Sometimes the privileges of a higher practice are purposely contrasted with the divination and necromancy of the day (Isa. 8:19).' The mode is seen affecting such late passages as Isa. 65:1 and Ezek. 33:30 ff. In such passages we have the oracle instinct and style although their authors may be a long distance from consultation at shrines and on the way to a more spiritual conception of the interpre- tation of the divine. Such a passage as Gen. 2:15-25, with an echo of the oracular and its trace of the theophanic, acquires a dignity not possessed by other literature. We have never appraised the enhanced loftiness given to the Hebrew Bible style by this oracular quality. The same verbs are used as are employed in describing the utterance of man but with how noble a distinction the reverence of the ages will testify. No literature outside the Old and New Testament has anything like this sonorous and impressive tone until we come to another of the Semitic line, the Koran. 1 See note on Isa. 65:4, McFadyen, "Isaiah," The Bible for Home and School, 1910.</page><page sequence="18">274 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES Contradiction of the word of the divine seems to be dealt with in the interesting story in Genesis, chapter 3.1 The serpent is repre- sented much as a pseudo-oracle and essays a solemn statement which leads to mischief. But the voice of God was heard by the guilty pair in the breeze sounds. Gen. 3:8 f. makes the presence of the divine seem real and the communication with the supernatural perfectly natural without any descent to grotesqueness or lessening of the sense of reality. It was easy for students to whom this type of teach- ing was offered to name the human conscience the voice of the divine and thus gain the most powerful aid imaginable in the service of moral education. In 3:14 ff. are three significant words, (1) against the serpent, (2) announcing the law of travail in human birth and the subjection of woman to man, (3) a theory of the perversity of agri- cultural ground and of man's trouble to gain a crop from it. (1) is a theological, (2) a sociological (biological) and a legal, while (3) is an industrial dictum. Thus we have in sentences ascribed to God observations which would seem to be hard earned lessons of evolving experience. Is this what the voice of God means ? Or do these lessons seem to be said to us in the sounds of nature and in the expected responses at places of worship and consultation, as at shrines, or after meditation? Similar dicta have been vouchsafed at Sinai and Delphi. They are just such as the brainier custodians of early shrines attributed to divine inspiration. The dicta of experience are credited to a divine source and given dracular aspect as the words of God spoken in an age when heaven and earth were in easy communication. This scriptural manner has too often led the unthinking and the lazy of later times to hope for unearned incre- ments of wisdom. The bases of such dicta were approved in the moral consciousness of the higher grade prophets and have been found in the best oracular responses of earlier days. The compact, artistic form is probably due to some leader or school near a shrinal or cul- tural center. Such schools and individual leaders were found among the prophets and in the so-called Wisdom School but what about the earlier analogues and origins of such ? Certain of these concise dicta were probably possessions of the Hebrews before the Jehovistic school composed its writings. Did 1 Note the impressive plural form of the verb in fIn, 3:3 f.

There is no lack of suggestion that in either case the intel- lectual ancestors were familiar with the use of oracles. Literary tradition would fain give credit to one's own physical ancestors and one's own past for all lessons of life. In many of these dicta of the Old Testament one may hear echoes of the original cryptic and epi- grammatic core of utterance and see in addition the amplifying dress of literary elaboration. In Gen. 4:1 we have possibly one of those half-histories of ora- cular practice referred to above: "I have gotten a man from J1." In this the thought is, probably, that the mother had asked God for a child. Probably the offerings of Cain and Abel (4:3 ff.) were thought of by the Hebrews as approaches to JI which usually meant to appear with gifts and to seek aid by sign or oracle. Abel was favored in the responses and Cain was not. The prophetic explana- tion was a moral one. Gen. 4:6 f., "And the Lord said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth ? and why is thy countenance fallen ? If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted ? and if thou doest not well, sin coucheth at the door: and unto thee shall be his desire, and thou shall rule over him." This which is difficult of interpretation in its present literary setting (see the versions) may be regarded as the echo of a cryptic, possibly of an oracular, word which needs the restoration of its source to make it perfectly clear. The Greek renders "unto thee its return and thou shalt rule over it"; Syriac, "thou shalt return to him and he shall rule over thee." Mitchell ("Genesis," in Bible for Home and School) interprets "he who does a wrong act puts himself in danger of becoming the slave of evil." The thought reminds us of the Wisdom of the Hebrews. The thinkers who pro- duced such passages or collected them are the fore-runners of the classical Wise Men. Shall we see the rise of Hokhmah in these prophetic schools and the style of its literary masters in the oracular style of the interpreters developed to the point of producing such works as Proverbs, Job, and Ecclesiastes ? Doubtless there is much to be said in favor of such an explanation.' But the difference of mental constitution between the non-mystical speculator and the 1 See D.B. Macdonald in Studia Semitica et Orientalia, Glasgow, 1920.</page><page sequence="20">276 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES mystical prophetic interpreter was illustrated very early in Israel and the dual product has never ceased to appear. See Gen. 4:9, 15. It is interesting to find, in the poetic fragments of the older Hebrew song, couplets which seem like the echo of some early oracle. Such is Gen. 4:24, If Cain shall be avenged seven-fold, Truly Lamech seventy and seven-fold. It is possible that this couplet is older than those which precede it (24b,c) to which 24a was attached as introduction by the story- teller. Verse 24 seems to be the basis of the prose parallel in verse 15. But whether these poetic verses be ballad, pure and simple, or oracle lore, or embryonic bit of Hokhmah, the measured stress which marks the poetic form arises from related causes, the intense emotion or enthusiasm of balladist, oracle, or sage. Emotional utterance tends to the regular cutting of lines and to the rhythm that is inherent in strong feeling. At times of strong emotion there seems to be a cor- relation between the organic beat, heart, viscera, etc., and one's mental activity. A man out of breath, frightened, awed, or under other pronounced stress will exhibit the rudiments of the same phe- nomenon as that seen in the case of the emotional genius who creates artistic utterance. It has often been noticed that anger has led to unusual eloquence. Profanity and vituperation employ a rotun- dity of expression that is unwonted. Intoxication of several varieties has been sought to increase eloquence. It is plain that the addicts to such methods sought inspiration. In Gen. 6:3, in the nalive philosophy of that day, it was thought that some definite word of God had set the bounds of human lon- gevity. It was natural to theorize that primitive man had a dictum for every act and turn of his life. The easy converse in the Flood Story illustrates this, while it explains certain atmospheric facts. Such a question as that answered in Gen. 6:3 is often taken to oracles. What more natural than to garb such wisdom or science in the oracle form! "yet shall his days be an hundred and twenty years." The fashion of couching all convictions and knowledge in direct quotation of the deity grew naturally in an oracle atmosphere, Gen. 6:7, 13. It would not seem natural for us to write our narrative, history, theory of agriculture, weather, and a hundred other matters in words purporting to be the words of a divine speaker as is done in Gen.</page><page sequence="21">ORACLE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 277 7:1; 8:15 ff.; 8:21. These are aetiological passages suggestive of backlying sources in poetic form analogous with Judges, chapter 5. We should have to distinguish between the truly primitive and passages showing literary assimilation to the oracular style. Genesis 9:25-27 contains a justification for the subjugation of Canaan. Noah's curse seems like the pronouncement of oracular authority. The modern way of forestalling dispute about legal possession or title is to go before a court and secure the necessary decision. In old Israel these matters were taken to God, that is to Bethel or some other shrine, before the authorities who represented the divinity and the sanctions required were established beyond reasonable dispute. War would be entered upon, under such a mandate, with confident abandon, Judg. 5:12b. In late Judaism the actual names of the authorities, lawyers, rabbis, etc., were known to the record and we have them named frequently, but in early Israel the consultees are disguised under the conventional literary expression and with true oriental logic the words are taken back to their ultimate authority. It is this customary reference to first cause probably that accounts for the frequent impression given us in the Old Testament that a theo- phany originated the divine-human communication. See, for example, Gen. 12:6, 8; 13:14. Gen. 12:6-8 mentions the tere- binth of Moreh at Shechem, thought to have been an oracle-tree. Abram built an altar there. A second altar was built between Bethel and Ai. It may be that a Shechem tradition and a Bethel tradition are blended in this passage, though the analysts usually treat it as a whole.' Those literary theologians who gave us the accounts of the occupa- tion of Canaan by the chosen people would have been surprised indeed if they had known that their words would ever be interpreted as meaning that the constitutional position of Israel in the land was based upon occasional conversations even between God and humans, instead of the firm basis of oracular dicta, the laws of the divine, the covenant. This sure word came at every need; to preserve the purity of Sarah, to decide in the quarrel in Abraham's household in 1 See Mitchell, in loc., "Genesis" (Bible for Home and School) re Shechem: ".Its cen- tral location . .. as well as the popularity of its oracle and the sanctuary connected therewith made it a favorite place for great meetings." Cf. Gibecath Ham-more=hill of the oracle; Paton, E.R.I., 58.</page><page sequence="22">278 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES the dispensation which involved the child of Sarah and that of Hagar. The concept corresponded to what we call divine guidance, Providence. We should like, of course, to know the nature of the source immedi- ately back of J and E, whether it was the same for the two and whether the prophetic schools did any blending of variant source material or whether a distinction is possible between Babylonian and Canaanitish data. Did these schools ever see any pure Babylonian material or was it all Canaanized as it reached them ? When we pass to the combined JE stories there is a reduction of the easy, marvelous scope allowed in the prophetic portions of the first eleven chapters of Genesis. Vision and dream, usually ascribed to E, enter and share the attention with speech as such and the con- cept of intermediate agency plays a prominent part. See Gen. 15:1, 5; 20:3; 21:12. In the last of these passages, the voice of Sarah carries the same content as the voice of the divine being. ". .... in all that Sarah saith unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in Isaac shall thy seed be called." This instance eases the way to the sug- gestion that to ascribe direct speech to the divine may be a way of asseverating the truth of what Sarah said. In Genesis, chapter 16, is the first instance in J where the angel is the medium of the divine communication. Verse 13 says that "she called the name of Ji that spake unto her, Thou art a God that seeth." This easy assumption by which we pass from an angel to the deity himself is an identification which often takes place between God's minister and God himself (cf. Exod. 3:14, E, and the Priestly Exod. 6:3). Perhaps we have here the speaking or moving waters motif (Gen. 16:7 f). Gen. 18:1, "And JI appeared unto him by the terebinths of Mamre, as he sat in the tent door." There is no necessary suggestion that the writer thinks that this is the beginning of the sacredness of the famous trees, or that Abraham was unconscious of their sacred character, or quite unprepared for the visitation at that time and place. We enjoy the gifted story-teller's charm revealed in the natu- ralness of the tale which disguises the visit of the patriarch and his wife to one of the seats of divine counsel. The three men who appear to the patriarch have the unusual knowledge that marks the divine as sought by cultivators of oracle and divination. Evidently Abra- ham had met the terms of oracular consultation and his first words</page><page sequence="23">ORACLE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 279 to the divine men, perhaps the attendants, were, "Oh Lord if now I have found favor in thy sight. ... ." Abraham and Sarah were there seeking for an heir as is customary for a husband and wife, in the Orient, to go together for the blessing. As in Gen. 25:21ff and Judg. 1:1, we appear to have cases of oracle-inquiry. That which was at first oracular was often woven into later theophanic story, as Gen. 22:1 perhaps. If the Hebrews had an instrument by which they secured divine counsel it is easy to surmise how they came to conceive that divine speech was a possibility and that it was more freely vouchsafed in the ages preceding their own. Two things seem prob- able, that the instrument was divination in some form and that ora- cular practice was fairly well known (Ezek. 21:21 E.V). Without such an explanation as the essentially oracular our difficulties are unusual. Perhaps they are unnecessary. Trees,' caves, and springs have been, of old, places of expectancy. There spirits have dwelt and been consulted, in most lands. Professor L. B. Paton has listed the numerous references in the Old Testament to such abodes of the powers and with his pupil, Professor W. Carleton Wood, has studied the subject exhaustively. Mountain sanctuary, burning bush, rock, earthquake, lightning, fire, any concrete spot or manifestation of natural phenomena focuses the attention of essentially religious man and suggests submission and consultation. We have no reason to supposethat man of a given grade of culture in early Canaan was different from his contemporary in culture in other parts of the world. Instances of survival in modern Canaan are very suggestive as showing what has been obscured by the superimposition of cults. The beginnings of prophetic practice and literatures in the JE age scarcely shut the door upon a luxuriant pre-prophetic practice which resembles other Levantine customs more closely.2 Oracular seats belong to the period of localized deities. With the evolution of monotheism goes the progressive delocaliza- tion of deity and the lessening significance of places, seats, and shrines. According to the degree of clearmindedness on this subject of mono- theism depends the degree of detachment of devotion from localities.3 Corresponding with these considerations we should not expect details of the approach to oracles in those prophetic writings which overlook the media so often in contemplation of the great relationship between 1 Gen. 35:8. 2 See Marett, Psychology and Folklore, p. 134. ' Ibid., p. 164.</page><page sequence="24">280 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES the worshiper and the sole deity. Obedience and righteousness of life are the great points of emphasis in our Bible. Out of the belief in the success of these inquiries by the ancient Hebrews grew the concept of the tender regard of God for all need. We find it in Gen. 21:17 ff (God and Hagar), "God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is." Any cry from anywhere is heard, even though it be the cry of the child of an Arab slave-girl in the desert, Ishmael the traditional ancestor of the Ishmaelites. This developed sense of a just and compassionate providence available at any time and in any place was long in arriving but in due time it appeared as the higher idealism of the prophetic folk. According to Gen. 26:24, Isaac slept at the shrine of Beersheba. In 28:13 ff we are told similarly of Jacob that consciously or uncon- sciously he slept at a shrinal spot, Bethel, and received the appropriate communication. We can discern between the position of the writer to whom ancient Canaan was essentially oracle ground and the sur- prise of the till then uninstructed patriarch who learns that there is one more place than he had thought where God might be approached. The distinction between open theophany and dream seems to be one of literary style, partly at least, as will be observed in the J and the E elements in the Jacob and Joseph stories in Genesis. "The angel of God said unto me in the dream Jacob: and I said, Here am I," . . . . "I am the God of Bethel where thou anointedst a pillar, where thou vowedst a vow unto me; now arise, get thee out from this land, and return unto the land of thy nativity" (Gen. 31:11, 13). With these E passages compare Gen. 12:1 (J) to which reference is evidently made. See, further, Gen. 31:24 and 32:24-29 ff., to which may be added the following E passages, Gen. 35:1; 37:5 ff.; 40:8; 41:25; 41:28, 32; 46:2. Once we have the clue to primitive practice, the comparative method seizes upon rich data scattered in our scriptures which show pretty clearly what the prophets sought to wean Israel from as they upheld the loftier ethical, spiritual conceptions of Hebrew religion. There is more than a figure of speech in such a passage as Josh. 24:27 where "Joshua said unto all the people, Behold this stone shall be a witness against us; for it hath heard all the words of JI which he spake unto us; it shall be therefore a witness against you, lest ye deny your God." God spoke to the primitive Canaanite in the</page><page sequence="25">ORACLE IN THE OLD TESTAMENT 281 thunder as he does to many a primitive mind in Palestine today. He clothed himself with militant heroes and acted through them. See Judg. 6:34 and 11:29. Priests and prophets were largely engaged in interpreting the meaning of these many vehicles of divine utterance in early Canaan. The nabi' was a proclaimer of answers from the divine (I Sam. 9:9). The k6h4n was the priestly attendant who obtained oracular answers for inquirers. W. R. Smith in reviewing Wellhausen's "Gesch. Israels," in Lectures and Essays, p. 606, speak- ing of the time of the Judges, says, "The chief function of the priests was to give oracles; and oracles in such a state of society must have been in great demand." Shrines continue in vogue in the Levant much as of yore except for the frowning of certain officials of religion in places. S. I. Curtiss' tells of the shrine of Aaron on Mount Hor which modern Arabs believe the saint visits two days a week. Cf. also the saint of Nebk, named Mohammed el-Ghuffary, who "appears in various forms, sometimes as an old man, sometimes as a young man in white, but always in human form." A Moslem said of this saint, "I have seen his spirit because I love the saint and he loves me. He appears to me by day and by night like a middle-aged man wearing a green robe. I speak to him and we converse together." It is possible that theophanic and oracular motive was the origin of many an altar placed upon the holy spot where notable experience was had. This would be contrary to the thought of the passage in Toy's Introduction, section 297, and more in agreement with section 1081 of the same work. But a counter consideration must be added. Sometimes it is as important to suppress voice and sign as to invoke them, for the manifestation might be ill-timed and awkward if not dangerous. Frazer (M.A., II, 204) tells us of the Bolivian Indian women who, while at work on pottery, "observe certain ceremonies and never open their mouth, speaking to each other by signs, being persuaded that one word spoken would infallibly cause all their pots to break in the firing." A clumsy Aladdin might rub the lamp at an ill-omened moment and be confronted by a genius whom he could not employ suitably.. What did the Jews think would happen if the divine name represented by the tetragrammeton were pronounced ? Would it in any sense constitute an unhallowed oracular summons ? 1 Primitive Semitic Religion To-Day, p. 79.</page></plain_text>
