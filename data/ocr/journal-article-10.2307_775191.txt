<plain_text><page sequence="1">James Smith Pierce Architectural Drawings and the Intent of the Architect According to Le Corbusier, "certain poets and proph- etesses" cried out against his work saying, "Monsieur, you are a dirty engineer, without soul or sensibility; you have no artistic conscience." A victim of his own early 'functionalist' propaganda, he answered the charge with a single sentence and a series of sketches for the Villa Meyer project of 1925. "This house," he wrote, "rose from garden to roof-garden opposite the park of the 'Folie Saint-James,' with its artificial ruin, and the pond which has reflected it since the days of Louis XVI."' His sketches (Fig. 1) present the villa as a series of pictures, including a 'picture window' framing a prospect of the pond and tempietto worthy of Claude himself. By using his building as a frame, Le Corbusier made a picture of an eighteenth-century park inspired, in turn, by seven- teenth-century paintings. Linking himself in this way with the Picturesque tradition, he demonstrated his sen- sibility and escaped the charge of being nothing more than a "dirty engineer." In answer to a contrary charge, however, that he was an aesthete, all sensibility and no sense (a more likely charge these days), Le Corbusier, a versatile stylist, could have pointed to other drawings- hard, sharp, and clear-cast in the mold of the machine aesthetic and ringing with objectivity: isometric projec- tions with a strong structural emphasis, devoid of any in- dication of landscape or the experience of the viewer, drawings given a depersonalized air of precision and pre- fabrication with Zip-A-Tone overlays and stenciled num- bers (Figs. 2 and 3). Despite the dubious and highly selective nature of Le Corbusier's defense, his procedure of referring to his drawings as signs of his intentions could be used by crit- ics and historians of architecture more effectively than it usually is. It is an especially helpful method to use when evaluating the work of architects who, unlike Le Corbu- sier, never defended themselves in print. Sympathetic study of the surviving drawings of an architect can save us from irrelevant criticism by helping us to understand his goals. Consideration of the particular subject-matter of the drawings for a project may enable us to determine the relative importance of functional, structural, or ex- pressive requirements.

This essay is an attempt to indicate the value of such an ap- proach by suggesting something of the range of graphic means developed by architects in the past and the significance of their choices as clues to their aims and as- sumptions. Examples have been drawn from a number of periods to suggest the special value original architectural drawings can have as supplements to the usual photo- graphs and modern measured drawings now used almost exclusively in teaching architectural history.2 I. Consiaeration of the subject-matter of architectural drawings, analysis of just what is presented and what is not, can tell us much about the general approach of an architect. James Ackerman is one of the few masters of this sort of detective work. He finds that what is missing from architects' drawings can be as significant as what is presented. "What is curious about High Renaissance drawings," he tells us, "is not that they are so frequently plans and details but that they are seldom anything else."3 During the High Renaissance "the plan dominat- ed architecture as never before or since," but plans are often found incomplete, without any indication of the exterior: only the line of the inner wall is drawn, the outer surface is not even considered. From this Ackerman deduces that the High Renaissance architect had a "painter's concept of architecture"; architects imagined themselves at the center of their projects, looking out- ward. "This is why they were so attached to the central plan and, to go a step further, to scenografia: two ways of making it possible to view the whole environment from a single point." When they did start to consider the treatment of the exterior, however, they seldom began by making a scale drawing of the whole elevation; they began by drawing details. This leads Ackerman to the conclusion that the architect of the High Renaissance thought of the elevation "as a neutral field into which plastic incidents are set at intervals." Consequently fa- cades of palaces, at any rate, could be "expanded and con- tracted at will." This attitude Ackerman thinks may be explained, in part, by the absorption of Renaissance ar- chitects with Roman ruins: "architects' drawings after antiquity were almost all plans and details-of necessity, since so few ancient elevations remained elevated." Ackerman might also have commented on the gener- al absence, in Renaissance architectural drawings, of in- dications of the settings of buildings, even in plans. This is a corollary of the neglect of facades. Leonardo's sketches for centralized churches, for example, although they are devoted to studies of exteriors as well as plans and interior perspectives, include no indication of a specific site at all; they are ideal solutions to abstract for- mal problems. Solely on the evidence of these studies for perfectly complete and self-contained structures, one might conclude that it was Leonardo's opinion that "a building should always be detached on all sides so that its form may be seen."4 The relation of building .and site is usually an im- portant critical consideration and in analyzing drawings it is important to gauge the degree to which existing structures and landscape elements appear to have entered into the architect's thinking: the surroundings may be totally ignored and the building considered self-sufficient as in Leonardo's projects for centralized churches, the surroundings may be indicated but simply treated as 'en- tourage,' or features of the site may be carefully integra- ted with a proposed structure to create significant exteri- or spaces. Examples of this last approach, in which the building is considered in relation to its environment, would be such Picturesque studies as the drawing for the 1Le Corbusier, Creation is a Patient Search (New York, 1960), p. 74.

Fig. 4. Heinrich Christoph Jussow: Sketch for the Aqueduct, Wilhelmsh6he. Staatliche Kunstsammlungen, Kassel "Aqueduct" (Fig. 4), an artificial ruin with cascade, in the Park at Wilhelmsh6he, near Kassel, made by Hein- rich Christoph Jussow before work was begun in 1788. Even more comprehensive are the before-and-after 'slides' that Humphry Repton made for the 'Red Books' which he gave his clients to give them an idea of the capabili- ties of their country seats; in these studies, buildings, even those yet to be built, are considered as subsidiary elements in the composition of a broad and unified 'pros- pect.' Among the watercolor sheets from the Red Books that Repton reproduced in Observations on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening (London, 1803) is one showing a project for a new house and grounds at Bayham Abbey where, as he tells us, he strove to create an effect of magnificence and sublimity by employing the principles of extension and continuity. So that his read- ers might judge the efficacy of these principles in produc- ing the intended effect, he refers them to the sketch "where both the actual size of the house and its compara- tive proportion to the surrounding scenery are ascer- tained." The precise scale is indicated on the 'before' overlay (Fig. 5a) by the carriage and the poles (marking a distance of 150 feet) right of center, the site of the pro- posed mansion. The castellated mansion is seen in its re- lation to the new landscape composition when the over- lay is folded back (Fig. 5b). This sort of 'proto-organic' Picturesque approach to architecture was not unheralded; evidence of a con- cern for the integration of buildings with their sur- roundings is frequently found in the drawings of seven- teenth-century architects. A dramatic example is one of the drawings for Carlo Rainaldi's project for twin churches in the Piazza del Popolo showing them as part of a broad perspective of a whole section of that quarter of Rome.5 A broad wash drawing (Fig. 6) for one of Ra- inaldi's less familiar projects, an arcaded forecourt for St. Peter's, reveals his concern for the creation of a great ex- terior space by his attention to the general massing of surrournding units, quite apart from specific detailing or any but the most summary indication of the proportions of subordinate elements. The cast shadows in this draw- ing, probably from Rainaldi's own hand, play a particu- larly important part in bringing out, indirectly, the char- acter of the imponderable volume. This expansive Ba- roque approach is symbolized in Bernini's quick sketch of St. Peter's showing his colonnades, which superseded Rainaldi's projected arcades, as though they were quite literally the arms of the Church stretching out to em- brace all believers.6 Rainaldi formed a more modest piazza before his fa- cade for S. Andrea della Valle simply by utilizing the " Vatican Library, cod. Chig. P VII 13, f. 26v/7.

The drawing can also be seen as an example of the special category of symbolic drawings used as demon- strations of an anthropomorphic theory of architecture. Other examples would be Francesco di Giorgio's dia- grams showing the conformity of human and architec- tural proportions through the superimposition of human figures on columns and church plans and of human heads on capitals (see Roberto Papini, Francesco di Giorgio Architetto, Florence, 1946, II, pls. 12, 69, 70, 284, 286). In his Cours d'Architecture (Paris, 1750, I, pl. XI), Jacques-Frangois Blondel superimposes the profile of a man's head over the profile of an entablature. For more recent demonstrations of the anthropomorphic theory see the drawings in Claude Bragdon, The Beau- tiful Necessity (New York, 1910). Le Corbusier's draw- ings of his Modulor man are only the latest contribu- tions to this venerable genre.

The site with proposed alterations including a castellated house and a lake. walls of existing buildings. In a drawing for the project (Figs. 7 and 8), signed by Carlo Fontana who was Rainal- di's assistant at the time, we can see how the architects intended to set back the facade of the church from the street, giving it a breathing space (again emphasized by shadows) and enhancing its dignity by contrasting its height with the lower walls of surrounding buildings. With the removal of the block of houses to the left of the church and the consequent revelation of its rather bald flank, the lack of correspondence between the Rainaldi- Fontana facade and the body of the church (begun by Giacomo della Porta and completed by Carlo Maderno) became painfully evident (Fig. 9). Fontana's drawing, however, makes it clear that a charge of 'facade architec- ture' is here quite beside the point since only the front of the church was visible from the square before it. That the facade was conceived as a separate entity is clear from the plan of the surrounding buildings (Fig. 7): the inscription marking the square reads, "Piazzetta avanti La Chiesa e facciata," indicating a separation of church and facade in the minds of the architects. The facade of S. Andrea della Valle is a monument, a great piece of sculptural decoration, to be looked at from the outside.

Instead of being conceived as a solid object to be looked at from the outside, the Miesian glass box is conceived as an environment from which one can look out at nature. This reversed orientation is foreshadowed, early in the nineteenth century, in Repton's projects for transparent conservatories as adjuncts to old country houses, in which one could sit comfortably inside and enjoy the pictur- esque pleasures of the prospect outside.' A taste for the effects of transparency spreads with iron and glass con- struction until, with Mies, the view at times becomes 51 Pierce: Architectural Drawings and the Intent of the Architect</page><page sequence="5">more palpable than the building itself. This is certainly true of his collage perspectives in which photographs of the principle views, with a full range of values, are past- ed directly onto unmodelled line drawings of the interior.8 Formerly, buildings were conceived as having two clearly separate aspects, an inside and an outside, al- though care was sometimes taken to bring out the corre- spondence of the two aspects. In the thirteenth-century sketchbook of Villard de Honnecourt, for example, inte- rior and exterior bay elevations of Reims Cathedral are set side by side,9 but even the glass box of the Gothic ca- thedral presented an opaque exterior, the harmony of in- side and outside was not instantaneously perceptible. With the Renaissance, and throughout the Baroque peri- od and the ensuing classical revivals, walls became more massive. Windows are presented as blank, often black, " Repton describes his iron and glass conservatories in Observations on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening (London, 1803). The description is reprinted in Humphry Repton, The Art of Landscape Gardening, ed. John Nolen (Boston, 1907), pp. 146-147. Repton's Fragments on the Theory and Practice of Landscape Gardening (London, 1816) includes color prints of two contrasting interiors, showing the old and new approach to the relation of the inside to the outside. The first shows a dark Baroque interior with chairs arranged in a circle, but without any people; they have apparently gone outside to enjoy the weather and the view since a door to the outside is ajar. The second, the bright and cheery Repton interior, shows everyone inside having a fine time and enjoying good views of the outside through a big picture window, a spacious conservatory directly adjoining the room, and a huge mirror over the mantel- piece opposite the window, reflecting views of the con- servatory or of the window according to one's position in the room. Repton's print is contemporaneous with the rise of the popular Romantic theme of the window picture (see Lorenz Eitner, "The Open Window and the Storm-tossed Boat: An Essay in the Iconography of Romanticism," Art Bulletin, XXXVII, 4 (December 1955), (pp. 281-290). Drawings by Soane and his office also show portions of the landscape through the windows of projected interiors. Earlier, Horace Walpole had in- cluded the view from a window of the great bedchamber at Strawberry Hill in his Description (Strawberry-Hill, 1784) of the villa, but this was after it had already been built.

Today, however, when glazing details, which make up a large percentage of the working draw- ings for curtain-wall construction, are a central critical issue (according to Reyner Banham, the very essence of Mies' aesthetic)'o effects of transparency are valued so highly that matters of convenience and economy, even safety, are set aside. The two formerly separate aspects of a building, the inside and the outside, are now simulta- neously visible. Much is made of this in presentation drawings: people are shown both behind and in front of large sheets of glass, hovering banks of fluorescent tubes inside the building are revealed as they pass athwart the serried mullions of the outside." Ephemeral effects, ig- nored by draughtsmen in the past, are painstakingly de- picted: walls reflect each other at re-entrant angles, glass "?Reyner Banham, "Almost Nothing is Too Much," Architectural Review, CXXXII, 786 (August, 1962), pp. 125-128.

Many buildings today are made to be seen, according to one's mental set, as structures at which one looks, into which one looks, out of which one looks, and through which one looks. Some presentation draw- ings, such as those for Paul Rudolph's Art and Architec- ture Building at Yale, provide for all these possibilities in a single perspective view.12 1I. We have already begun to touch on not only what is presented (the general subject of the drawing) but also on how it is presented (its particular form). One of the most telling clues to an architect's approach to architec- ture is how he chooses to represent space. The effect of a building will vary considerably with the method of pro- jection used. It may appear markedly different when presented in pure elevation, in axonometric, isometric, or oblique projection, or in perspective views with the building at normal eye-level, in bird's-eye perspectives, or in projections showing the building as though seen from beneath the ground in the manner of Choisy (Fig. 10). Choisy, trained as an engineer, was primarily interested in structure and his highly abstract drawings, some of them combining plan, elevation and multiple sections in a single atypical worm's-eye view, are as disinterested as a Cubist still-life; they emphasize the building as a struc- . . .. . .. . .. .

Views from above, even those in perspective, may indi- cate a conception of the building as an independent enti- ty removed from the experience of the viewer. This is especially likely when there is little or no indication of surroundings, as in Leonardo's variations on the theme of the centralized church, most of Du Cerceau's views of chateaux, or Le Corbusier's drawings for standardized housing (Fig. 2). Perspective views showing the building at eye-level or as normally seen from the ground below, however, stress the relation of the building to the perceiver, espe- cially views in which the building is set at an angle rath- er than presented frontally and symmetrically (Fig. 4). The angle perspective is now the standard method used in presentation drawings and betrays the Picturesque heritage of even the most austere structural classicist. Angle views abound in the drawings and paintings of art- ists from the sixteenth century on; the angle perspective, in fact, became, by the seventeenth century, the usual method chosen by painters to render existing buildings.'4 Yet, it was not until the eighteenth century, when Juvar- ra and J. B. Fischer von Erlach began to present some of their projects in this way, that the method was used con- sistently by architects. It is not surprising to find, at the same time, the development in actual building of wings projecting at an angle, as in Juvarra's Stupinigi palace, so that no matter where one stands some surfaces will al- ways recede at an angle. The distance chosen for the station point may also play an important part in the effect of the presentation. When the building is shown at a sharp angle, a near view may emphasize monumentality, as in the drawings and etchings of Piranesi and his host of admirers, among them Sant'Elia, the Futurist, whose drawings for airship hangars and power stations for his multi-level Cittaz Nuova15 appear to have been made under the old spell of the Carceri for all their modernity. In direct line of de- scent from Sant'Elia's projects are the drawings for El Lissitsky's Wolkenbiigel project (Fig. 11) in which two- point perspectives with station points close to the build- ings invest their dramatic cantilevers with a soaring dy- namism. Sometimes an architect may choose a station point so close that the viewer seems to be included direct- ly within the ambient of the building even when it is shown from the outside. In Wright's perspective drawing of his son's house6 or in the bold sketch by Mendelsohn for his Dallas synagogue project17 the buildings appear to sweep up and pass behind the viewer, apparently in- cluding him within the picture space. Shifts in modes of spatial presentation may reflect fundamental changes in conceptions of architecture and mark major turning points in architectural history. We have already noted the close correspondence of the rise of Picturesque architecture and the architect's use of the painter's angle view. Even more marked is the shift from a linear conception of architecture in the Gothic period to a plastic conception during the Renaissance, signaled by the appearance of perspective drawings which clearly mark the location of masses in space (Fig. 12). It is not surprising that the revival of Roman architectural forms, with their play of mass and volume, should coincide with the rebirth of illusionism in painting. Although no an- cient Roman architect's rendering has survived, architec- tural decorations at Pompeii and Herculaneum certainly indicate the existence of a highly developed scheme of spatial representation fully in harmony with the spatial grandeur of Imperial Roman architecture. It was this ar- chitecture that inspired Brunelleschi, who is both the traditional inventor of systematic single focus perspective and the first important classic revival architect. " See the drawings in Auguste Choisy, Histoire de l'Archi- tecture (Paris, 1899). For an excellent discussion of the impact of Choisy's drawings and his structural theories on the Modern Movement see Reyner Banham, Theory and Design in the First Machine Age (London, 1960), Chapter 3. 1" Hogarth, in the Analysis of Beauty (London, 1753), states the painter's preference in his chapter on "Uni- formity, Regularity, or Symmetry": It is a constant rule in composition in painting to avoid regularity. When we view a building, or any other object in life, we have it in our power, by shifting the ground, to take that view of it which pleases us best; and in consequence of this, the painter, if he is left to his choice, takes it on the angle, rather than in front, as most agreeable to the eye; because the regularity of the lines is taken away by their run- ning into perspective, without losing the idea of fit- ness: and when he is of necessity obliged to give the front of a building, with all its equalities and parallel- isms, he generally breaks, as it is termed, such dis- agreeable appearances, by throwing a tree before it, or the shadow of an imaginary cloud, or some other object that may answer the same purpose of adding variety, which is the same with taking away uniformity. The same tricks are employed by professional renderers today to get a dull design past the building committee. 1 See the drawings reproduced in Francesco Tentori, "Le origini liberty di Antonio Sant'Elia," L'Architettura, I, 2 (July-August, 1955), pp. 206-215.

The Renaissance interest in solid masses and posi- tive volumes is made strikingly clear in a new method of architectural presentation exploiting Brunelleschi's in- vention: a plan and a cross-section are coordinated in a single perspective projection so that the building appears to be sliced open like a melon. This cutaway method ap- pears to have been developed by Leonardo, whose inter- est in defining negative volume may be judged by the fact that he was the first to discover the precise shape of the cavities inside the brain-a feat he accomplished by filling them with molten wax in the manner of a bronze caster (Fig. 13).

" Reproductions of cutaway drawings of the Renaissance may be found in Wolfgang Lotz, "Das Raumbild in der Italienischen Architekturzeichnung der Renaissance," Mitteillungen des Kunsthistorischen Institutes in Flo- renz, VII (1956), pp. 193-226. Cutaway drawings are usually found among studies for churches where the harmony and interdependence of the parts is a major concern. The attitude of the later Renaissance toward palace design, as Ackerman points out (loc. cit., p. 9) was apparently more arbitrary, somewhat similar to the retractable and extensible 'belt' compositions that Fred- erick Hartt has shown to be characteristic of the later Renaissance. For a discussion of the significance of the belt composition see Hartt's Giulio Romano (New Haven, 1958), I, p. xx. ART JOURNAL XXVII 1 56</page><page sequence="10">at a glance. In such drawings, we sense the shift from the notion of a building as a collection of separate parts to a view of a building as a unified and harmonious whole, to which ideally nothing may be added and nothing taken away. The spatial relationship of all the parts is perfectly systematic and instantly clear. There is a sharp contrast between these drawings of a volume, through which one can imagine himself walking, and Villard de Honne- court's scattered drawings of separate bays, disconnected towers, and partial plans. Renaissance architects, as Ack- erman points out, were very interested in details too, but they are Roman details-parts of an organic whole. To stress the relationship of the parts to the whole such ar- chitects as Giuliano da San Gallo, in their sketchbooks, coordinated plan and elevation on the same page and drew them to the same scale. Another method Giuli- ano used to display the correspondence of interior and exterior parts allowed him, at the same time, to indulge his new and nostalgic fondness for ruins: he gives us cut- away views of the interiors of Roman temples by draw- ing them as more ruinous than they actually were!20 Ser- lio's use of these coordinated schemes for the illustrations of projected buildings (Fig. 15), as well as the ruined monuments of antiquity (Fig. 16), in his treatise on ar- chitecture helped standardize them and spread them throughout Europe. III. No matter what method of presentation an architect chooses, he must select a medium with which to set it down. The particular medium he selects and the way in which he handles it may tell us as much about his ap- proach to design as the subject of the drawing or the method of projection he uses. Renaissance architects usu- ally preferred the pen (Fig. 12). It was particularly suited for the distinct outlining of the individual elements which, in Renaissance composition, always preserve their identity. High Renaissance architects began to use washes to emphasize the mass of individual forms, but the boundary of each element remains inviolate. By the later sixteenth century, the architectural drawings of men like Buontalenti and Cigoli, in keeping with the develop- ment of Italian drawing style as a whole, are much freer: doorways and window surrounds, even facades, are broadly conceived in groups of dark hollows and bright projections. The richly ornamental surface play of spar- kling lights and sudden darks that one sees in such draw- ings as those Cigoli made for the facade of S. Maria del Fiore (Fig. 17) is palpably realized in models (Fig. 18) and finished facades. During the seventeenth century, whole facades were set down with the brush alone (Fig. 6). Drawings of fa- cades, rare in the Renaissance, abound in the seventeenth century when architects sweep down broad washes to study the play of light and dark across the entire surface. There may be no firm outlines at all; washes alone sug- gest the edges of columns; sometimes boundaries are only implied. This is true of the surprisingly broad wash drawings of the conservative Carlo Rainaldi as well as the flashing drawings of Bernini. Where there are lines they break and wriggle. In the agitated drawings of Bor- romini, edges sometimes dissolve in a flurry of broken lines simulating, with remarkable accuracy, the flickering of the facades as built.21 In the seventeenth century, the total effect counts more than the details. The Baroque penchant for the brush and the broken line implies a preoccupation with the over-all massing of elements that are less important in themselves than as members of groups and clusters that catch and break the flow of light. Baroque architecture is highly pictorial and the full range of Baroque pictorial means was exploited to cap- ture fleeting effects of light and shadow even before the buildings were built. The breathless descriptions of these effects by critics today may sound like bad prose poetry, but they are not simply projecting their own values back into the past. Ephemeral effects of light and shadow were fully appreciated by Baroque architects and intentionally built into their architecture. Their drawings are the best evidence (Fig. 19; cf. Figs. 8 and 9). The drawings technique itself may even, in some cases, determine the form of the building, because it is through drawings that architectural ideas are usually de- veloped. Certain ideas may come more readily in one medium than another. Ideas generated with the brush, we have seen, may be different from those developd with the pen. Vincent Scully suggests that Paul Rudolph's technique of defining surfaces with parallel hatching may " See the reproductions of cutaway drawings in Cristano Huelsen, Il Libro di Giuliano de Sangallo (Turin, 1910, pls. 37, 38, 42. Antonio da Sangallo the Younger reveals an almost obsessive attention to the correspondence of interior and exterior by adapting his uncle's cutaway technique to drawings for his own projects in which a sectional perspective of a whole interior is coordinated with a plan, as Giuliano had done, but, in addition, the most crucial parts of the exterior elevation are also drawn, so that they overlap the view of the interior as though they were the fragments of a ruin (see Uffizi A 1152 reproduced in Lotz, p. 225, fig. 33). This is a more complete and unified approach to the revelation of in- terior and exterior correspondences than Villard's juxta- position of two distinctly separate aspects of a single bay, or at most three bays, completely isolated from any indi- cation of the building as a whole. " See the drawings reproduced in Eberhard Hempel, Francesco Borromini (Vienna, 1924). Compare, especially, the remarkable prediction of shadow effects in the draw- ing of the facade of the Oratorio di S. Filippo Neri (pl. 38) with the photograph of the facade as executed (pl. 39) 57 Pierce: Architectural Drawings and the Intent of the Architect</page><page sequence="11">Al ........... .. ...... . .. ...........

Cathedral Museum, Florence. have influenced his choice of a striated surface for the concrete in his Art and Architecture building: "Natural- ly enough, the linear striations were entirely in accord with his drafting technique."22 No matter where one goes he is trapped by Rudolph's pencil: "Whoever uses the building is caught up in . . . that insatiable will and un- appeasable anxiety . . . One senses the fast-drawing pencil with its compulsively neat, parallel linear shadings, which studied each nook and cranny time after time, pro- liferating forms, breaking them down, recombining." This interpretation may be too extravagant for some people to accept, but certainly, during the Renaissance, when working drawings were more like pictures than precisely measured diagrams, when Michelangelo drew details intended to convey to his masons "a vivid experi- ence rather than calculated measured instructions for carving,"'23 as Ackerman puts it, the impression conveyed by a chalk drawing, or one in wash, would be different from one in pen and it seems likely that this difference would affect the work of the stone-carver using it as a Fig. 19.

When these drawings still exist they have much to tell us about the intended effect of the details. Certain accents or exaggerations in an architect's drawing help us determine his special concerns. When Michelangelo reinforces a torus profile, making it swell and bulge by pressing on his pen, we sense the "muscu- larity" of his mouldings, his anatomical conception of architecture. Villard de Honnecourt brings out the soar- ing verticality of slender shafts and colonnettes by inking in the spaces between them so that they stand out against a dark ground (Fig. 20), but when Leonardo hatches in the space between the walls of his ground plans, just as delicately as he darkens the cavities of the brain in the section at the top of Fig. 13, we sense his feeling for space as a significant volume, not an empty void. When Le- doux, and the other French 'revolutionary' architects rediscovered by Emil Kaufmann, emphasize edges and sharpen the contrast of shadows, they reveal their special concern for rational stereometry and we sense their kin- ship with the Constructivists of another revolutionary period (Fig. 11).24 It would be unfair, even in this hour of the resur- gent Picturesque, to condemn the French revolutionary architects for a neglect of Picturesque values in the han- dling of their surfaces, because the graphic mode cho- sen for the presentation of their projects emphatically announces their intention to make a clean break with the 'painterly' tradition of the Rococo. Their choice of the 'linear' Neo-Classical style for their drawings clearly links their architectural ambitions with the striving for the monumental and the timeless so obvious in Neo-Classical painting. Similarly, it would be beside the point to con- demn Borromini (and this is less likely today) for lacking the linear clarity of Palladio when the painterly qualities of his drawings are so vividly realized in his buildings.25 Once we have determined what an architect intended to do and what he did not intend to do, we may choose to judge his buildings according to our own absolutes, but it is only fair to consider first his most conspicuous inten- tions and tacit assumptions. If he has not set down his purpose in writing and his age has left no substantial body of theoretical writing or criticism to help us gauge his intent, we must follow the traces of his hand preserved in those drawings that are records of his mind and spirit. But even when architects, such as Wright or Le Corbusier, leave us a substantial body of opinion in writing, their drawings, as the man who was called a "dirty engineer" knew, speak louder than their words. Consider, in conclusion, an analogy: an architect's drawings are like a musical score. A musical composition should not be judged solely on the strength of a single performance. Why should we judge the work of an archi- tect solely by the piles of masonry that happen, often only vaguely, to be attributed to him? They are not real- ly his buildings any more than a particular performance of a symphony is the composer's. Each mason, as each musician, is responsible for his own part of the work; the competence with which he performs it will certainly affect the work as a whole. The conductor assigns the parts to the musicians and the contractor assigns each mason his particular job. Sometimes the architect is his own contractor just as the composer is sometimes his own conductor, but when this is not the case we should, whenever possible, consult the architect's 'autograph score,' with all its deletions and additions. The architect's 'notes,' although probably less complete, may be more valuable than the composer's. The particular character he gives each line will express the intended effect of the finished performance far more forcibly than the conven- tional symbols of the composer, because they are visual notations of a visual art.

For drawings of Russian revolutionary architects see Erich Mendelsohn, Russland, Europa, Amerika: Ein Architektonischer Querschnitt (Berlin, 1929). " The linear-painterly distinction here is intentionally reminiscent of W61ifflin. All five of Wl6fflin's familiar po- larities (linear-painterly, plane- recession, closed form-open form, multiplicity-unity, clear-unclear) can be handily ap- plied to architectural drawing, where, reduced to a con- venient common denominator, the shared qualities of the visual arts of a period became more evident. A search for the presence of one set of these formal characteristics over the other in architectural drawings, especially in presenta- tion drawings and idea sketches, may also bring out sharper distinctions between an objective classic ap- proach to architecture and a more subjective pictorial approach than might, at first, be apparent in the build- ings for which the drawings were made. 59 Pierce: Architectural Drawings and the Intent of the Architect</page></plain_text>
