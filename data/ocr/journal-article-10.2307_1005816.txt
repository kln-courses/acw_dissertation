It is not an attempt to reconstruct a philosophic system which might be called Aristotelianism nor to axiomatize his metaphysics. It does not try to explain away the apparent inconsistencies or even to deal in detail with Aristotle's scientific and philosophic conclusions. Its purpose is simply to uncover as far as possible what a great philosopher took for granted and thus to suggest the ideas which seemed self-evident to him and to members of his school. The Table of Contents indi- cates more or less succinctly what these assumptions were. Readers of this book may wonder why there is not more evidence of my having read the numerous works which deal with some of the points made in it. This is attributable not to any contempt for the studies of other historians nor to complete ignorance of their contributions, but to a desire on my part to base my conclusions on my own independent reading and inter- pretation of the text. Both may be mistaken; indeed it would be miraculous if they were not erroneous in some detail. But there comes a time in every man's life when he wishes to read a document for himself as if no one had ever read it before and to draw his own conclusions. Moreover, I think that I have put questions to Aristotle which are not in the tradition of historical investigation. This does not mean that I am not deeply indebted to others. On the contrary, such debts, particularly to the two friends to whom I have dedicated my book, will be obvious to readers familiar with Aristotle and Aristotelian studies. Others will not be offended by what seems to the specialist like ingratitude. I have, moreover, tried to confine myself to the corpus itself and to avoid wran- gling with other scholars except, as in Chapter VII, it was unavoidable. This may help to explain the brevity and the apparent dogmatism of my views. Baldwin, Maryland, 1958 G.

INTRODUCTION In making this study of what Aristotle took for granted, I am myself making certain assumptions. Principal among them is the assumption that no state- ment is self-evidently true, in the sense that what it says is incontrovertible, unless it is a tautology or is de- rived from one by purely logical devices. I do not deny that nominal definitions may be called self-evi- dent, if one wishes, but since they are prescriptions about the use of words, it is questionable whether they ought to be called true or false at all. But inferences drawn from definitions may or may not follow logi- cally and since it is customary to call deductions which are logically sound "true," one might say that such a deduction from a nominal definition was true. If then a triangle is defined as a three-sided plane figure, one can infer without geometrical training that a figure with more than three sides is not a triangle. Any statement of the form, A is not not-A, being the trans- lation of a tautology, may be called self-evident, especially if A refers to such a symbol as that of a term or assertion.' But one should always distinguish 1 A is not not-A, when A is a term, is tautological when the fact which it expresses is frozen as of a given date. If this is not granted, one runs into all sorts of sophistries based upon the neglect of the temporal dimension of "things." It was observed early in the history of Greek philosophy that "things" changed and, if the rate of change was rapid, then Gorgias soon got the upper hand. But it should be noted that no term is in itself contradictory of any other term; only assertions can contradict each other. The assertion-a propositional function in this case-that A is not not-A is a truism whatever A may symbolize, but nevertheless A and not-A cannot be said to contradict each other unless A symbolizes an assertion, says something. between two senses of the word "truth," truth to fact and logical consistency. When I speak of self-evi- dence, I am thinking of the former kind of truth and I am saying that even the supposed self-evidence of simple sensory observations can be questioned. They can be questioned because their predicates are more than the qualification of a sensory experience. I assume that they refer to some subject-matter which lies beyond or outside of that experience. If I say, "That leaf is green," either I am simply saying that I see a green shape at this moment or I am talking about a leaf which I also assume not to be an halluci- nation or dream-image. I grant that, if I begin with the premise that I must infer the existence of a non- psychological world on the evidence of admittedly purely psychological data, my evidence for the ex- ternality of such a world is weak. But I also feel no compulsion to begin with premises which make it impossible to distinguish between some of the primary data of experience, the difference between imaginary, hallucinatory, illusory, and oneiric experience and what are usually called real objects. My reason for this is that, if our observations were all "subjective," the distinction between a real and a subjective realm would never have arisen. That it has arisen and does arise in everyone's life no one has ever doubted, though many have doubted that the distinction is legitimate. To put the matter in a quite different way, I assume that the distinction between knowledge and its sub- ject-matter is ultimate. If that is justified, then even the simplest and most obvious judgments require 5 79 79 79 82 84 85 86 88 90 91 96</page><page sequence="5">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE evidence to support them and, though the evidence of the senses under controlled conditions is often the best and most reliable that we can obtain, it is still evidence. The best evidence for the color of anything is visual. But when we speak about the color of something, we either are talking about its color now, here, at a given distance, under specifiable illumina- tion, to a person with "normal" eyesight, or we are thinking about the object as if it persisted in main- taining certain properties over a long period of time, of "the object" as a self-identical entity persisting un- changed. These qualifications when brought into the open demonstrate some of the conditions under which alone such simple sensory observations are true. The fact that they are the normal or customary conditions does not weaken in any way their conditional nature. These conditions are both epistemological and meta- physical. When we speak of the color of an object as that color seen by normal vision, under a certain illu- mination, at a given distance, we are stating how we are to observe the color. We are admitting that the color seen is relative to a number of circumstances which can be varied independently of one another and that the sensory datum is a function of them all. These variables are not by any means all intra- somatic, so that, even though one cannot see a color if one does not have eyes, the color seen is not ex- clusively determined by the fact that we do have eyes. But when we think of "the object" as something which persists unchanged for a certain amount of time, as when we speak of it as an Aristotelian subject having attributes, we are stating metaphysical conditions. Neither of these sets of conditions is unwarranted and I am far from wishing to set up a kind of Pyrrhonian scepticism. But nevertheless it is worth our while to be aware of what we are doing when we make the ordi- nary judgments of daily life, as well as when we make the more startling judgments of science or philosophy. Judgments-assertions-may become self-evident when we are habituated to using certain types of evi- dence to prove them. As in much of our life we drop out of consideration those factors which determine our knowledge. When, for instance, we have judged a person to be pleasant or unpleasant, we overlook the circumstances in which such a judgment was originally made, just as when we are bored by a piece of music, we call the composition boring in itself. Our cogni- tive program is to set up a large system of judgments upon which we can rely, that is, judgments which we feel sure will not be contradicted in the future. When we have done so, we call that system a true description of the world or, if we are unusually careful in our use of words, we shall call it a true description of the world as we have known it. When, however, we discover that our experience does not harmonize with that of other people, that the leaf which we call green they call grey, that the person whom we find delightful they find revolting, that the music which we find boring they find interesting, we demand an explanation of these differences of opinion. The following solutions are open to us: (1) to think of such experience as a function of two variables, an external world and an observer, and to attribute the variations to the persons having the experience while retaining the stability of the external characters ;2 (2) to admit that the exter- nal world has inconsistent traits and to establish if possible rules in accordance with which the inconsist- encies are found; (3) to maintain that the observers are ineffectual in determining what they experience and to attribute all the variations to the external objects. Historically, I think, though I may well be wrong, the general tendency has been to assume a stable world of objects and to seek those experiences of it which have outstanding stability, to attribute whatever traits vary to a high degree to the observer, and to seek those conditions under which the varia- tions occur. But such qualifications as an outstanding stability, a high degree of variation, and the like, are too vague to satisfy some philosophers. For one of the aims of philosophy, even when the philosopher despairs of achieving it, is complete precision. To attain such precision demands a peculiar kind of world, a world which is the same for all observers regardless of place and date. To get such a world, philosophers are likely to set up at least three "realms of being," the realm of purely private entities: dreams, halluci- nations, illusions; the realm of purely human experi- ences, which may or may not be private: Locke's sec- ondary qualities, Berkeley's ideas, Kant's phenomenal world; and finally the realm of inter-personal experi- ences which accurately reflect the structure and prop- erties of the non-human world. Somehow or other philosophers have usually confined the adjective "real" to this third realm. It is supposed to be a realm to which human observations "make no difference," a realm which is above all characterized by immutability and a high degree of homogeneity. Time and change are always excluded from it, for the dominant trend of European philosophy has always been the escape from time. But all such programs rest upon certain assumptions both about what is worth knowing and about what nature would be like if no human beings existed. This is particularly well illustrated by what is left of early Greek philosophy. Those Pre-Socratics who are said to have been specially interested in finding a primordial substance out of which everything else was composed,3 surely must have seen that everything did not look like water or air or even "The Indefinite." But these substances, like the hydrogen of Prout, 2 That is, the leaf is green and its differences in color are attributable exclusively to something in the observer. 3Though Harold Cherniss has shown how prejudiced such an interpretation of their program actually is. See his Aristotle's criticism of presocratic philosophy, Baltimore, Johns Hopkins Press, 1935. Hereafter this work will be cited as Cherniss, Presocratics. 6 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="6">INTRODUCTION while appearing as various, really remained the same. The philosophers could presumably have stated the conditions under which water, for instance, appeared to be earth, air, and fire, but if they maintained that these three were really water-or whatever primordial substance they happened to choose-they meant by "really" "water-under-the-conditions-stated." The difficulty of such a position arises from the fact that the substance chosen always has two forms equally open to inspection. . If the substance had been some- thing below the level of perception, like the corpuscles of Hobbes or the atoms of Democritus, some of whose properties could be inferred from observation but which as a whole never appeared to human eyes, the theories in question would have been more plausible. But in Plato and Aristotle also, reality is identified with the unchanging, and, interestingly enough, when we come to the ethical philosophers, we find that they too wanted a Sage who would not be disturbed by the fluctuations of change, whose character, on the con- trary, would be so firm that it could withstand all mutability. This would be the "real" character of the Sage, though flesh and blood Sages could hardly be expected to exemplify it perfectly. The notion that reality is something beyond time and change appears even in belles-lettres, at least from the days of Theophrastus down, when he gave the greatest popu- larity to the idea that every human being has some permanent character. Indeed the theory of consist- ency of character was used as a rule for dramatists and novelists as well as for critics. Achilles, as Horace insisted, must be always Achilles and when he hid himself among the women he presumably revealed his "real" character when the disguised pedlar showed him the weapons. Intermittances du coeur are a modern discovery. There were, to be sure, dissident philosophers in Greece, amongst whom are the Megarians and Sophists. But their writings have not been preserved nor did they contribute anything towards forming the great philosophic tradition of our culture, except by providing arguments which the classic philosophers had to answer. Yet their very existence shows that it was possible to debate a point which most subse- quent thinkers took for granted. That there must be some stratum of existence which is immutable and homogeneous was assumed by almost everyone. And when Christianity turned into a kind of philosophy, which it did by the time of Saint Augustine, change and diversity had been ruled out of court. The search for the timeless was pursued in a variety of directions but no one seems to have doubted the importance of the search. The real must be stable and unified, in spite of the viciously indefinite meaning of both terms. What A. 0. Lovejoy has called the metaphysical pathos of the timeless was apparently too overwhelm- ing to be resisted. It now looks as if such pathos alone created the atmosphere of self-evidence sur- rounding descriptions of the real, an atmosphere moreover which made it seem plausible to ascribe existence to something called Reality which was not any real thing in particular. It is our thesis in this study that assumptions of this type can be discovered by the examination of philosophical texts. One need not and should not try to imagine what the authors of such texts "must have assumed"; one must on the contrary see, where it is possible, what they actually did assume. Where a writer has left a copious body of writings, it might even be possible to untangle most of his assumptions from his inferences and lay them out like the axioms in a formal system for the scrutiny of others. Whether internally consistent or not, they would form a protophilosophy, a set of ideas which seemed to the philosopher in question to be self- evident and therefore incontrovertible. If we have chosen Aristotle as our victim, this is because the body of his works is not only large but covers a uniquely various subject-matter, running from logic through physics and zoology to human affairs and metaphysics. Moreover, he was, at least in the works which remain, a singularly dry and plain- spoken writer. There are only rarely sparks of humor in anything left of him and, though he can be eloquent, his eloquence is seldom of the sort which obscures his argument.4 In this respect he is the polar antithesis of his master whose dialogues are tantalizing because of their literary beauty. How much trouble and boredom would have been spared if philosophers reading Plato had had a normal sense of the dramatic, had been sensitive to humor, or had had even a modi- cum of imagination! The fortunes of Plato have been more ironical than most of what Plato had to say himself. In Aristotle's case, though the interpretation of the text is often difficult, the difficulty for the most part arises out of the condition of the text itself, not out of the allusive character of the ideas incorporated in it. When after centuries of obscurantism he returned to the Western world, he must have seemed like a burst of sunlight breaking through heavy clouds, or as he himself says of Anaxagoras, like a sober man in contrast to his incoherent predecessors. It is indeed exasperating at times to read him, for never did a man make assumptions which proved more fertile in inconsistencies. And yet, because both of the in- trinsic interest of what he had to say and of his extraor- 4 It may be unnecessary to point out once more that Aristotle's style was praised by Cicero when he speaks of his works as characterized by a dicendi incredibili quadam quum copia, turn etiam suavitate. This will be found in the exordium to Cicero's Topica, amusingly enough addressed to Trebatius who, he says, found Aristotle's obscurity too great: Sed a libris te obscuritas rejecit. Cicero also says in Hortensius (ap. Nonius, Book IV) that magna animi contentio adhibenda est in explicando Aristotele, a thought which is frequently overlooked by historians. But regardless of whether the works to which Cicero refers were beautifully written or not, I am dealing with the corpus as we have it, not to Jaeger's reconstruction of the Dialogues. 7 VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959]</page><page sequence="7">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE dinary influence on later thinkers, it seems to be worth while to uncover his assumptions. For these assump- tions turn out to be the nucleus of whatever is permanent in the philosophic traditions of the Occident. Some of them were taken over from Plato, some were contra- dictions of Plato, but on the whole it was he, rather than his master, who was responsible for philosophic method, for scientific facts, and for much of the meta- physical core of later thinkers. I. METHODOLOGICAL ASSUMPTIONS 1. INTRODUCTORY Amongst these assumptions are certain which deter- mine Aristotle's method. Though no methodology is independent of the subject-matter which it handles, yet it can always be distinguished from it on paper. Such a distinction must be understood to exist only for purposes of discussion. For even Aristotle's ter- minological inventions, such as the difference between the essential and the accidental, matter and form, potentiality and actuality, were made to name certain differences which, he believed, existed "in nature." Yet once made they also determined how he would study natural occurrences and, it goes without saying, what he would accept as natural. If one grants the difference between the essential and the accidental as rooted in the natural order and not simply as a con- venient way of classifying certain properties, one will also explain some events as natural and others as artificial or even unnatural. And once our observa- tions are declared to be of unnatural events, we can relegate them to the wastebasket of the trivial, of that about which we need not worry, and even, in Aristotle's case, of the unintelligible and the evil. We no longer know whether Aristotle was first concerned with the discovery of that which happens, as he says, "on the whole," and then called it natural or essential, or whether he first noticed that every common noun named a class of things and then decided that what- ever the members of that class had in common and which nothing outside the class possessed was to be called its essence, whereas everything else was to be called its accidents. We do not even know whether he began his work with his logic or his zoology, his politics or his metaphysics. Though various scholars have tried to draw up a chronological list of his works, their results are still largely conjectural.1 Any 1 Among these scholars the most famous and the most influ- ential is of course Jaeger. Jaeger has convinced a great many contemporary students of Aristotle that his chronological ar- rangement of the writings is correct. This arrangement is based on the assumption that the more Aristotle's ideas resemble those of Plato, the earlier they are. The problem arises because of the inconsistencies in the corpus. The most striking inconsistencies, in his opinion, are those between the dialogues and the treatises which now exist. See his Aristotle, 21, 2d ed., Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1948. The dialogues as he reconstructs them support themes which are Platonic and are therefore early. Yet we find attempt to describe the actual working of his mind, in so far as it is not exhibited in his authentic writings, would it goes without saying be equally conjectural. In the field of methodology certain questions are bound to arise whatever factual problem one is trying to solve. These questions include the following at a minimum. (1) What are the factual premises which I shall take for granted? These premises may express the "hard facts," the pre-analytical data, to use Dr. J. Loewenberg's term,2 the indubitables, the reasonable common-sense ideas without which neither questions nor answers can be phrased. Among such methodological premises are of course the "laws of logic," the validity of ordinary arithmetic, the usual tests of factual truth such as the need for repeatable experiments, the empirical corroboration of inferences, the Principle of Parsimony, and tests for the identifi- cation of whatever it is one is studying. (2) But since many such premises have been re- jected as the sciences and philosophy have developed, thanks to a critical examination of their reasonable- ness, philosophically minded men have begun to ask how they are discovered. Do we get our factual premises from our own individual observations, from (p. 66) in his discussion of the Protrepticus, as used by Iamblichus, that "the main thought of the first section is specifically Aristo- telian, and so is the way in which it is developed." This, I suppose, means that the main thought of this work resembles, or is consistent with, certain thoughts in the extant treatises, though Jaeger at this point in his argument is showing that Aristotle is still Platonic. In any event the order of the treatises turns out to be as follows: De caelo; De motu animalium; Physics, I, II, III, IV, V, VI; Metaphysics, Delta, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Kappa, Mu; Eudemian ethics; Physics, VIII; Metaphysics, Lambda, first chapters; Nichomachean ethics; and Metaphysics, Lambda, chapter 8. The Metaphysics itself is further broken down. Deuteron alpha becomes (p. 169), "a remnant of notes taken at a lecture by Pasicles." Alpha, Beta, and Gamma belong together. Delta is said to have been known as an independent work in Alexandrian times. Epsilon is a short transition to Zeta, Eta, and Theta as a unit. Kappa is simply another form of Beta, Gamma, and Epsilon. Lambda is an isolated lecture. And Mu and Nu have no relation to the preceding books. We are not competent to debate the argument which Jaeger uses to establish his order and are full of admiration for his ingenuity and industry. But we cannot resist pointing out (a) that an idea cannot more or less resemble another idea; it is either con- sistent with it or inconsistent with it; (b) the number of ideas in a given work which resemble-or are consistent with-those of another must always be measured against the number of ideas contained in the work which are not consistent with those of the other author before one can conclude that there is an historical affiliation between the two works; (c) that inconsistencies in a philosopher may not occur in any logical order whatsoever-vide the various systems of Schelling, the order of which we know and which show no evolutionistic dimension. What would a man like Jaeger make of the first and fourth books of Locke's Essay? But this note is already too long and was written to indicate the elements of conjecture in one hypothesis, and that the most plausible, about the chronological arrangement of Aristotle's works. 2 See J. Loewenberg, Pre-analytical and post-analytical data, Jour. of Philosophy 24 (1): 5, 1927. 8 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="8">METHODOLOGICAL ASSUMPTIONS such observations checked by those of other people, by the consensus gentium, by the application of Cartesian doubting, by the lumen naturale, by revelation, by intuition, by the principle of authority, by Royce's reflective method, by conjecture and repeated tests under varying conditions, or in still some other way? In spite of the claims of some extreme empiricists, we do not trust to our individual observations for reasons which were discovered as early as the sixth century B.C., if not earlier. When we check our observations by those of others, we introduce a further assumption into our methodology to the effect (a) that two or more observers under standardized conditions will perceive the same things and (b) that nature can be described in a set of propositions expressing such uniform observations and finally (c) that the truth about facts must be inter-personal. We have learned not to trust the consensus gentium in factual matters since we know that it has varied from time to time and from area to area. That is, matter could change its weight or even be imponderable, according to the consensus gentium roughly up to the end of the eighteenth century; since then mass was constant, until it began to be believed that at extremely high velocities it could change. As for the place where the consensus is expressed, we have learned how some beliefs, such as that in witches and ghosts, which were almost universally held in some cultures have died out in others, though there seem to be survivals of earlier cultures in later ones. In fact, one might properly question the very existence of a consensus gentium in any strict sense of the term. The question may arise about the efficiency of Cartesian doubt. Though Descartes himself thought he was doubting everything, nevertheless he too took certain things for granted.3 Moreover, there is some question whether the primary premise which his method gave him was quite as he believed it to be. For though he himself rejected the idea that the ergo in his cogito ergo sum was a logical ergo, yet even if he thought he was conscious of himself as a subject doubting in the act of doubting, it is just as plausible that he was conscious merely of the act of doubting and not of any agent. The natural light (lumen naturale) the existence of which he never doubted, though not much different from the consensus gentium, did not demand an actual universal agreement about everything; it was simply the power which we had by nature of grasping self-evident truths. But even when it appeared to be in operation, it illuminated so many conflicting ideas and produced so many that had to be corrected later, that it too could not with- stand criticism. One could of course maintain that the natural light evolved through time towards greater and greater accuracy. Such a theory would be analo- gous to Philo's interpretation of the story of the three 3See my Dominant themes of modern philosophy, 92, New York, Ronald Press, 1957. Patriarchs and the education of the Nous, or that of Lessing in his Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts. I know of no writer who has ever maintained such a theory about the natural light but, if someone did maintain it, he would also have to agree that all knowl- edge was tentative and subject to later correction.4 As for revelation, it has seldom been appealed to for what I can only call ordinary factual premises, though when people took the first two chapters of Genesis as the expression of geological and biological theories, revelation was indeed called upon to establish fact as well as to provide edification. Whatever its field may properly be, it is beyond criticism in that field and the fact that different and conflicting truths have been revealed to different individuals and peoples is not a demonstration of its untrustworthiness. To demon- strate that, we should have also to assume a priori that all truths are inter-personal, a reasonable but not a necessary assumption. For people who hold to revelation often also hold to "levels of truth," so that, as in much of Christian exegesis, a single statement may "mean" four different things, the difference being determined by the level. Hence one could also main- tain that a given person or a given tribe, though en- dowed with revealed truth, for some reason or other perceived only one of its "meanings." The reasons might run from sheer ignorance or imbecility to wickedness or depravity. When Christians say that the New Testament fulfills the Old, they certainly do not mean that it in any way contradicts the Old. The New Dispensation was inherent in the Old as Aristotle's forms were inherent in their matters. The reflective method of Royce will work satis- factorily when we are seeking those very general premises which we need in metaphysics. But there are so few assertions whose contradictions reassert them that the method cannot be applied to the ordi- nary judgments of daily life or even to those of science. Even such general principles as the Law of the Con- servation of Energy cannot be tested by such a method, nor can the postulates of Euclidean geometry. By an additional assumption one can argue that all propositions can be deduced from a few which are established by the reflective method. On the other hand, regardless of that, it would be agreed that his- torical statements could not be deduced from universal propositions.5 No such statement can ever be estab- lished or refuted on purely logical grounds, unless it contains a contradiction in terms, in which case it is neither true nor false. It is, for instance, untrue that at this moment I am seeing a coconut palm tree outside 4 In a way, I suppose, Comte's Law of the Three States might be such a theory. But in the two later states there were survivals of earlier ways of thinking, so that the natural light in, for in- stance, the positivistic state would be threefold in its conclusions. 5 By historical statements I mean propositions in which time and place are integral parts of what is asserted, not merely statements about what is popularly called history. VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] 9</page><page sequence="9">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE my study window, but the falsity of the proposition is surely not revealed in its logical form. It might be quite true as far as its form is concerned. It just happens to be false. If there actually were some propositions of fact whose denial entailed their reasser- tion, a man would be hard put to it to reject them. Moreover, it is difficult to imagine what temptation he would have to reject them. But we are not here engaged in defending or attacking any of these methods of reaching premises. We are merely listing them and trying to clarify them. Of intuition, to continue, one can say only what has been said about revelation: it is private and hence unassailable unless one also eliminates a priori all judgments which are not corroborated by persons who did not originally make them. If one does eliminate all such judgments, the price is a heavy one. For in that case it has to be granted that no individual has a private life at all. I am not referring here merely to dreams and hallucinations, but to any somatic sensations. Is one to argue that a physician should not ask a patient for his symptoms but should draw his conclusions exclusively from physiological dis- orders which are open to his own scrutiny? If now one reply that intuition usually is supposed to reveal facts of a kind quite different from somatic sensations, dreams, illusions, and hallucinations, it turns out that one's suspicions of intuitive judgments are based not on the instrument by which they are framed, but on the kind of fact which they assert. It is no longer the privacy of the subject-matter, but the subject-matter itself which is rejected. Thus a whole audience may see a magician pull a rabbit out of a hat and what they see is corroborated by all who see it. Yet no one actually believes in the uncriticized report of percep- tion. It runs counter to principles which are taken from a body of scientific theorems, none of which are ostensibly related to the perceptual experience before one. Authority, like intuition and revelation, is in a privileged position. We are forced to rely on au- thority for most of our factual information. Other- wise lexicographers, encyclopedists, almanac makers would go out of business at once. At the same time we are likely to demand that each authority be subject to the same critical standards as those to which we submit ourselves. We do not say that something is true simply because someone has said it was; on the contrary, we maintain that a man becomes an au- thority when he tells the truth. The distinction between the ratio essendi and the ratio cognoscendi is always preserved when the appeal to authority is made, except perhaps in theological and legal debates. If the courts make the law in the sense of determining its meaning, then clearly the law has no meaning apart from the interpretations of the courts. The meaning of a law then can change and its symbolism is not fixed like that of mathematics and science. On the other hand, even in those domains someone has to read the symbols and reading is interpretation. (3) Once our primary data are established, what is to be done with them ? Are they that whose existence is to be explained or are they that by means of which other existences are to be explained? Are they to be organized into complex structures analogous to the molecular formulas of chemists or are they to be thought of as precipitated out of a larger mass of existents according to statable laws? Are these primary data declarative, i.e., do they "say"anything or are they that about which something is to be said ? If the former, what means have we for knowing what they declare or assert? If I see a red apple, must I be committed to saying, "That apple is red" or may I also say, "That apple is ripe," or even, "That apple is not a Grimes Golden?" May I ask on seeing it, "How does it happen that that particular apple has turned red when the others on the tree are still green?" Is the message of the data self-evident? If so, do they say the same thing to all people under all condi- tions, being completely univalent? (4) Is the world entirely intelligible or are there possible areas whose existence may be conjectured but about which we can know nothing else? If we mean by "intelligible" "describable in a set of consistent assertions," what are we to do with logical surds, such as "existence" itself? Whence do we derive the justi- fication for our concept of "the world"? Have we any grounds for using such terms as "everything that exists," "all things," "the universe as a whole," "being"? Are we expanding our experience of isolable material things in an unjustified fashion or have we some reason to believe that the finite collection of things or entities is of such a nature that we can make certain assertions about it which will be true of it as a whole ? Do we reach such assertions, if their formulation is possible, by purely logical procedures? We do extra- polate into the remote past physical laws which we believe to hold good of the material world at present. Can we do the same as regards remote regions of inter- stellar space? Eddington as recently as 1927 spoke of the annihilation of matter as a "promising hypoth- esis" to explain the aging of stars.6 More recently still Hoyle has spoken of its creation as equally promis- ing, indeed as being the case. Both of these hypoth- eses violate the classical law of the conservation of matter. Is this enough to warrant our rejecting the hypotheses or must we conclude that the law is limited in its application ? On what basis would we determine such a limitation?7 For instance, as far as I know, no one has said that striking a match was a serious viola- tion of the second law of thermodynamics. Are such 6A.

(5) In accordance with what general principles are we to organize our knowledge? That is, when we come upon connections of one kind or another which are usually believed to hold between things, are we to assume that all such connections are of one kind, i.e., that they are all causal or purposive or hierarchical (in the Plotinian sense) or genetic? Are we to assume that there is one such principle which is universally at work or that there may be several? If several, how are we to limit their number? Or are we not to limit it? What evidence shall we accept for the predomi- nance of one or two such types over the others? If they are basic metaphors, are we at liberty to use any that may occur to us or have we some means of select- ing some as more appropriate than others? What means are there? As an example, we have the preva- lent view which Huxley once named "the Miltonic hy- pothesis." This explains the beginning of things as the creation ex nihilo of an eternal God. The things are not only the stellar universe but the various kinds of matter, plants, and animals. It assumes as a methodological principle that there is a whole, that the whole had a beginning, and that it came into existence by divine command. The nearest experience which we have to that sort of event is artistry, which in medi- eval language is production, not creation. The artisan has to work on pre-existing matter, as God formed Adam out of the dust of the ground and Eve out of Adam's rib. Is creation simply production minus the pre-existence matter? In some cultures the beginning of the world is though of as a birth out of a pre-existing egg. In still others it is thought of as a birth following procreation. Each of these hypotheses is based on a figure of speech, for to say that the universe had a beginning is also metaphorical, since it transfers to that which it calls "the world" a characteristic of living beings and artifacts. If, however, we refuse to assign a beginning to "the world," then we must have some reason for denying the universal applicability of our analogies. What will such reasons be? (6) Finally, what are we to assume about the tradi- tional categories, such as unity and diversity, immu- tability and change, substance and attribute, activity and passivity, cause and effect? What use are we to make of the distinction between appearance and reality? Is philosophy or science an organization of ideas or of things? If of ideas, are they ideas about things or events or are they projections of the Idols of the Tribe? Assuming that we know what we mean by causation, are we inevitably to assume also that every change which occurs is attributable to some cause or that there are some changes which are un- caused? Are we to admit the legitimacy of several types of explanation, that is, are the words "why" and "because" ambiguous? Must we assume that ex- planations can be found which are omnicompetent or may we grant that we shall endeavor to extend them as far as we can into the unknown while admitting that we shall always fall short of our goal ? And how do we discover that a type of explanation has become inadequate? Besides such questions, we must decide upon the role which deduction and other forms of inference, observation, analogy, "experience," are to play in our enterprise. But the situation has already been shown to be complicated enough for our present purposes. Most of what we have said is known to all philoso- phers, if not to all scientists. It is outlined here simply as a reminder of certain questions which have to be answered before inquiry can begin. If we study the assumptions of any single philosopher, we shall have a pretty good portrait not only of his individual mind but also of the regnant ideas of his time. In general the ideas which are unquestioned are those which seem unquestionable. But much intellectual progress is made precisely by denying that anything is unquestionable. I am far from maintaining that there exist group-minds, Zeitgeister, collective uncon- sciousnesses, or self-evident truths. No historian of ideas is unaware of the fact that every theory is con- structed in part out of criticism of existent theories. The history of philosophy and of science is not simply the record of those men into whose hands has passed the ownership-or tenancy-of eternal truths. On the contrary, there is every reason to believe that real discoveries have been made and that change has occurred not only in the subject-matter of science and philosophy but also in our ways of thinking them- selves. We shall now turn to Aristotle's methodo- logical assumptions. 2. SERIAL ORDER One of the basic assumptions of Aristotle is that events are organized in a serial order, an order which permits him to use the words "prior" and "posterior" not only to indicate the position of terms in a series, but also to direct the reader's attention to that which is of greater scientific importance. In the Categories, chapter 12, five senses of "priority" are listed.8 Things may be prior in time, in an irreversible series, in order of exposition as in science and oratory, in "nature," and in causality. Temporal and causal priority are easily enough understood. But when we come to Aristotle's third type of order, a difficulty arises. For the example he gives of scientific exposi- 8 W. D. Ross in his Aristotle, 24, n. 2, 2nd ed., London, Meth- uen, 1930, says that chapters 10-15 "are commonly regarded as spurious," though on page 10 he says, "They may well be the work of Aristotle." I am accepting them as genuine largely on the basis of I. Husik's arguments in his essay, The categories of Aris- totle, now available in Philosophical essays, ancient, mediaeval and modern, ed. Nahm and Strauss, Oxford, Blackwell, 1952. But even if the tenth chapter of the Categories is spurious, the distinc- tions of the five senses of "priority" is not in disagreement with other authentic lists of meanings. VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] 11</page><page sequence="11">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE tion is that of geometry and the order involved is that of inference, the order which runs from premises to conclusions. One would be tempted to see in this nothing more mysterious than logical order were it not that he also cites as an example of the type the case of grammar where he says that the letters in a word are prior to the syllables. By this he would seem to mean either that we learn our letters before we learn syl- lables or that the letters are that which compose the syllables or both. If this is so, then this type of order is both temporal and genetic. Another example which he gives is the order of speeches in which the exordium is prior to the narrative, an order which again is tem- poral, though he may also have been thinking that as conclusions follow logically from premises in geometry, so the narrative follows logically from the exordium in speeches, or at least ought to. Since, however, he does not list logical order elsewhere, we shall conclude that he is thinking of it here. Natural priority, as given in this passage, entails a higher degree of value than natural posteriority. And though he points out that this use of "prior" is far-fetched, nevertheless else- where, as we shall see, he puts great weight on it. The meaning of causal priority is obvious; the cause is prior to its effects. But since the word "cause" has a fourfold meaning, the priority of the cause is not always temporal. In the so-called Philosophical Lexicon (Metaphysics, Delta, chapter 11) the treatment is somewhat dif- ferent. He lumps together various forms of serial order, temporal, spatial, dynamic; gives as his second type epistemological order, in which he distinguishes between the priority of the universal in knowledge and the priority of perception in the acquistion of knowl- edge and, as a second example, the priority of acci- dents to the qualified individual which has them. His third type is the priority of the attributes of prior things and his fourth, natural and substantial priority. Here he extends his examples of natural priority, making it clear that the subject is prior to its attributes as the substratum is prior to whatever qualifies it. This is accompanied by still another distinction, for he says that in regard to potentiality some things are prior, whereas others are prior in regard to actuality. His conclusion is especially worth noting, for he says, In a way then all things that are called prior and posterior are so called according to these principles. For some things in respect to generation can come into being without others, such as the whole without the parts, but others in respect to destruction, such as the part without the whole. And likewise in the other cases (Metaphysics, 1019 a 11).9 It will be observed that here too Aristotle does noth- ing with logical order, except in so far as the relative positions of universal and particular, substance and attribute, may be called logical. But if all things are ordered in accordance with natural and substantial 9 All references to Aristotle are to Bekker's text unless other- wise noted, and I cite simply the first line of the passages discussed. priority and posteriority, we have at least one princi- ple which will cover all cases. The problem is to discover just what natural and substantial order is. But before going into that we should mention the kinds of priority and posteriority which are given in Physics, VIII, chapter 7. Here three senses of these words are listed. (1) A thing is prior to another if it can exist without the other, whereas the other cannot exist without it. This would be the case of the whole which might exist without some of its parts, as a man can exist with only one arm, whereas an arm cannot exist apart from the whole man. (2) Temporal priority. (3) Priority KaT' ovaolav.10 The first of these permits a series only when one can set up a group of things in which A can exist without B, but not B without A; B without C but not C without B; and so on. I point this out since it would be essential if one wished to establish a cosmic hierarchy. Temporal order again is obvious. Priority Kar' ovolav might permit the establishment of a hierarchy of classes, if "reality" can be graded, though Aristotle makes little use of such permission. Since the ordering of things from prior to posterior is so important a part of Aristotelian method and since the mixture of descriptive and normative meanings is utilized in the ordering of things, it is important to see how much he assumes and how much he attempts to demonstrate. There is clearly no logical connection between the temporally prior and the better, in spite of the long tradition of chronological primitivism. Aristotle is not in general inclined to praising the past simply because it is past. Indeed when he discusses his predecessors it is usually to show that they were all heading in his direction, their ideas being, so to speak, matter to the Peripatetic form. The only interest he seems to take in their views-other than the in'terest which we all have in showing our forebears to have been wrong-is to indicate the extent to which 10 Hardie and Gaye translate this "in perfection of existence," which gives it a Plotinian flavor. Carteron translates simply selon la substance, which puts the burden of interpretation on the reader. One might translate "in essence," since essences might be arranged in a logical order which would not be identical with the order of whole and part or with temporal order. There is, however, as we shall try to show later, no evidence that Aristotle thought that there was such a thing as a logical hierarchy, though genus would be prior to species. Cherniss in correspondence suggests translating "prior in reality" and supports his suggestion by copious textual references, including Metaphysics, 1050 a 2, where KaT' ovo'lav is coupled with Kara &gt;&amp;ovov. But he also points out that priority KaT,' oaoiap in Physics, 260 b 18 is said not to apply to the very example of it which is used in Metaphysics, 1019 a 2. In any event in De generatione animalium, 742 a 20 Aristotle says that the end is prior to the potency and since in natural change the essence and the final cause are identical, it may be possible that in the passage we are discussing oovaa should be "essence." The ambiguities of the term in Aristotle are notorious, though attempts have been made to iron them out. See, for instance, B. Weber, De obvO-as apud Aristotelem notione eiusque cognoscendae ratione, Bonn, 1887, which reduces them all to "essence," by the simple means of neglecting all passages in which the word clearly means something else. 12 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="12">METHODOLOGICAL ASSUMPTIONS they approximated his philosophy. The clearest example of this, if one is needed, is in the introductory chapters of the Metaphysics, the purpose of which is to show to what extent they utilized one of his four causes. On the other hand he does insist that all science which deals with an historical subject-matter should begin with the temporally first things. Thus in the Politics, 1252 a 24, we find him stating firmly that "should one look at things as they first begin to grow, as in other matter, so in this [politics] he would have the best view of them." And later (1260 b 37) he begins his own discussion of politics with the divi- sion of property in the community, since it is the natural beginning of differentiations in political organi- zations. And when we come to his discussion of the causes of revolution (ibid., Book V, chapter 3, esp. 1303 a 12-1303 b 16), we see that excessive differences in the distribution of wealth are one of the main causes. We too, of course, usually begin historical accounts with the temporally prior and the custom has made us overlook its conventionality. One cannot begin a history anywhere but at the present, though when we come to write down what we have found out, we may well begin with the past. For in order to begin with temporally first things, one must know that series of events of which they are the first. And the only way to know it is to see something in the present, or at some date which one treats as if it were the present, which, if one believes in causality, is the terminal effect of a long series of past causes. One then proceeds to trace that series backward; but when one comes to writing it up, one turns the process about and begins with the beginning. This is simply the difference between the order of discovery and the order of exposition. Perhaps one of Aristotle's reasons for emphasizing the importance of beginning with the temporally prior is given in the Nichomachean Ethics (1112 b 23), where he says that the last in the order of analysis is the first in the order of genesis. This is not an assumption, but is based on the prior assumption that only one analysis of a given thing is possible. The letters of the alphabet are genetically prior to the syllable, to use one of his own examples, but we discover them after analyzing the syllable. And similarly, though our abstract ideas, according to Aristotle, are ab- stracted from perceptual experience and hence are historically later than those experiences, yet the com- plete is said to be prior in nature, definition, and time to the incomplete (Physics, 265 a 22). This might seem to be in contradiction to the principle stated. But the complete is the form and the form is prior in all ways to the potential.'1 Hence the complete is 1 Aristotle believes that genetic series have termini determined by nature. They can be indefinitely repeated. Biological series, from egg to chicken, are repeatable in kind. In art the series from rough stone to statue obviously does not give birth to more rough stone, but the sculptor who, so to speak, contains the prior in time to that which is in process of being com- pleted, though in any individual's history the incom- plete is encountered before the complete. It is for this reason that Aristotle is able to assert the apparent paradox that the last term in a process is the first in time, which means nothing more than that the actu- ality is potentially present in the seed (Metaphysics, 1049 b 17), though it sounds far different. Be that as it may, since we reach our knowledge of universals, that is, forms, from a study of particulars, the principle that the analytically posterior is the temporally prior becomes justified. And the order of acquiring knowl- edge is seen to be different from the inner order of the knowledge already acquired. But this gives us two temporal orders, that of the cosmos or nature, and that of the individual's life history. I do not add history in some general sense. The former is a cyclical process represented best by the everlasting movement of the stellar bodies and also exemplified in human history. The cosmos in Aristotle's opinion has no beginning or end. It has always existed and always will exist. Human history also seems to be everlasting. Each art and science, he says (Metaphysics, 1074 b 11), has often been developed as far as possible and has been lost only to be developed again.12 In the Politics (1264 a 1) when he is arguing against the communism of Plato's Republic, he says that, if the idea were worth anything, it would have been put into practice already, since almost everything has already been discovered. Yet both in the movements of the heavens and in human history there is temporal order. Its difference from the temporal order of a man's biography lies in the latter's coming to a stop and its beginning at a definite moment. The cyclical motion of cosmic and human history in the large sense is not reproduced in any individual's life. The Neo-Pythagorean-and possi- bly Stoic-notion that exactly the same individuals reappear in later cycles is not foreshadowed in Aristotle.l3 The realization of forms is all that cor- responds to cosmic history on the terrestrial plane. Here there is generic repetition only. There is always room for variation in each specimen of a process of a general type. Therefore, in the acquisition of knowl- edge a man may begin with that which is logically posterior to arrive at that which is logically prior, whereas sub specie aeternitatis the individual's ter- minus is the prior. The discrepancy between the order in which we entelechy of the statue in his mind, may make a replica of it. The assumption of natural beginnings and termini is essential to Aristotle's metaphysics. 12 See the opening of R. Eucken's early book, Die Methode der Aristotelischen Forschung in ihrem Zusammenhang mit den philo- sophischen Grundprinzipien des Aristoteles, Berlin, 1872. 13 See A. 0. Lovejoy and G. Boas, Primitivism in antiquity, 82 and 84, Baltimore, Johns Hopkins Press, 1935, for examples of the belief that not merely kinds of things but actual individuals will recur. 13 VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959]</page><page sequence="13">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE discover things and the order in which they exist is common knowledge. But the order of existence may be of several kinds. There may be a causal order in which the cause always precedes the effect; an order of growth, seen in plants and animals, from the seed to the mature organism; a teleological order from intention to accomplishment; a logical order from premises to conclusions; and serial orders such as those of mathematics. Some of these involve discrete terms, whereas in others the terms are intellectual constructs out of a continuum. Aristotle's purpose apparently was to combine all such orders, and what- ever others there may be, in one which he called nature. But this order was clearly not that of dis- covery, for we may hit upon any term in a series first and step by step work out the whole series. But if the philosopher can map out the natural order, he may then be able to give clues to the investigator by means of which the natural order may be found. In this way knowledge will become adequate to the facts. He can thus play upon two senses of the word "prior," the sense of natural priority and that of epistemological priority. That the natural is prior to the unnatural is asserted in so many words in De caelo, 286 a 18. The contrast between the natural and the unnatural in this place is that between the logically organized and the random, the purposive and the purposeless. For, as I hope will be made clearer below, the order of nature is both a logical and a teleological order. In Metaphysics, 1010 b 37, we find the phrase, "The mover is prior by nature to the moved." The phrase is used to prove that there must be something prior to sensation which will be the object of sensation. In other words we could have no sensation unless there already existed something of which we might have the sensation. Here the order of nature and the order of discovery meet: the object of sensation already exists and later we human beings come into contact with it. Further on in the same treatise (1018 b 9) he equates natural priority with "absolute" priority and speaks of things which are "nearer some beginning" in the various natural series, such as that of time or movement. Yet natural priority is not identified with temporal priority, for the Unmoved Mover has natural priority and yet must not be earlier in the temporal series than that which He moves. He has of course no place in the temporal series at all. He is, in Aristotle's words (Metaphysics, 1072 a 25), "eternal, substance and actuality." The mover in a temporal series may or may not cease to exist after the initiation of the series, as any cause may cease to exist once it has caused something. The analogy between such a cause and the Unmoved Mover lies merely in its function as mover. Natural priority here, i.e., in the case of motion, would seem to mean proximity to the mover. There must then be a kinetic series in which a first mover moves something close to it, which in turn moves something close to it, and so on, a series which exists independently of human beings. Each prior member of the series might continue to exist after it had moved something and at any point in the series there might exist all the prior members, though they need not be moving anything. The one series similar to this which Aristotle describes is that of the spheres, though there the motion never stops. Since we can know only classes of things and not the things them- selves, for they are open only to perception which is not knowledge, the kinds of movers might be arranged in a logical order and, when that would be done, the temporal and the logical series might merge. In the Categories (14 b 12) Aristotle says that the cause of a thing "may reasonably be said to be by nature prior to the effect." The example given is especially interesting in that here the naturally prior is not temporally prior except in the order of discovery. The fact which is correctly expressed is in no sense of the word determined by what people think about it; it is whatever it is and its character is uninfluenced by knowledge. The "objective" character on the con- trary determines what we may know about it and in that sense of the word "cause" it is the cause of our knowledge. In short a new temporal series is begun at the moment when it swims into our ken and in that series the priority of the caused is reckoned as if the chain of events from the moment of our coming into contact with it were a new natural order. Thus the position of any fact, any thing, any event, may differ according to the various orders in which it participates, though there is one over-all order, the order of nature, which presumably absorbs all the other orders. But Aristotle does not tell us what that order is, for the existence of chance events stands in his way. It turns out that he has two worlds, as he has two temporal series, one of which is-or might be-the logical sequence of classes and the other the random world of "experience." It is in the former that natural priority is to be found and it can be found only because Aristotle is willing to admit that knowledge is re- stricted within its borders. But of that more later. If natural priority is something of a puzzle, it is no more so than logical priority which, as I have said, does not appear in his lists. The order of the cardinal numbers in the Categories (14 a 29) is not given as an example of logical order but of the order of a "sequence of being." "If 2 exists, it follows directly that 1 must exist, but if 1 exists it does not necessarily follow that 2 exists." This looks as if Aristotle was thinking of arithmetical order as a kind of causal or genetic order, as if the existence of an effect or product allowed us to infer the previous existence of its cause or source, whereas, as we have pointed out above, the existence of a cause is not sufficient ground for inferring the existence of its effect. To think of any number as the cause or source of any other is foreign to us who have been influenced by the work of Frege and his succes- 14 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="14">METHODOLOGICAL ASSUMPTIONS sors. We should begin with a definition of the relation which determines the sequence of the cardinal numbers and would probably not utilize the notion of existence at all.14 Once the serial order has been defined, the numbers fall into place and no number causes any other. But in this passage logical order is classified with rhetorical order, as simply a kind of order, as if there were no peculiarly important differentia of it which he felt in need of pointing out. Yet the concept of logical order is an integral part of his philosophy, for his whole method depends on one's ability to reason from one thing to another. Such reasoning itself depends at a minimum upon the existence within any subject-matter of (a) the hierarchy of classes, (b) the four causes, and (c) the relation of potentialities to actualities. With these three data he can construct his accounts of any subject-matter and, as is well known, he relies on them almost everywhere when he is not exclusively engaged in criticizing other people or in simply collecting facts. Epistemological priority is much more important in Aristotle's opinion, as is overtly stated, than logical priority. He assumes that the world is intelligible, but its intelligibility has never the same limits as those of the natural order. The natural order is limited by the imperfections of the material world which pre- sumably are the conditions of chance, corruptions, perversions, and failures in the process of actualiza- tion. In so far as the world is imperfect, in so far as it exhibits change (Metaphysics, 1010 a 8), we cannot know it; we can observe it, but we cannot know what we are observing. Knowledge is always knowledge of four causes (ibid., 994 b 29), amongst which is matter, and complete accuracy is to be found only in the realm of universals where there is no matter.15 Among the subjects which have epistemological priority is first the changeless (ibid., 1063 a 13). Attacking the sensationalists, Aristotle points out that there are some things in nature which do not change and that knowledge should begin with them rather than with the flux. The flux exists, to be sure, and enters into man's experience, but it cannot be known. The essence of things is revealed by their qualities, not by quantity (ibid., 1063 a 27), and the flux is explicable only to the extent that it is a flux of quali- ties. These, once they have arisen, may disappear, but their quality never changes, never increases or diminishes. Increase and diminution are terms which simply do not apply to qualities. Since all change is reducible to the realization of forms, even in the case of locomotion, there is a changeless factor in all change: the forms which are in process of realization. Such processes always exhibit a fixed pattern. But 14 1 have not found a discussion of this passage in Sir Thomas Heath's Mathematics in Aristotle, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1949. But for Aristotle 1 is not a number (Metaphysics, 1088 a 6). 15 Perhaps there is noetic matter, whatever that is. See Ross's edition of the Metaphysics 2: 199, comment on 1036 a 9. one cannot observe the forms during the process of their realization because (a) the process may through accident cease before it reaches its termination and (b) the form does not appear until the process is com- pleted. One must therefore know a priori what kind of process is being observed. Presumably we should know the things needed for knowledge if we began our education with philosophy, for philosophy is abso- lutely true. Its truth arises from its having to do with eternal, not temporal, things. Yet Aristotle nowhere explains how man living in time can reach eternity. It probably did not appear to him to be a problem. For he identifies man with the reason and the reason is the locus of the eternal. When a man thinks, eternal beings make their presence felt spon- taneously. The nearest approximation to such beings in our temporal life is the things that happen "on the whole." These, as we shall try to show, are as near as matter can get to the timeless. To know what is epistemologically prior is to start building on a safe foundation. Such knowledge will eliminate at once all unnatural events, for nothing unnatural is eternal (De caelo, 286 a 17); it will elimi- nate all incapacity, for incapacity is unnatural (ibid., 288 b 24); it will not eliminate all motion, for some natural things move (Physics, 185 a 12); it will elimi- nate the imperfect, for the eternal is perfect (Meta- physics, 1051 a 19). It ought to make all science purely deductive. It could never occur to one who dealt entirely with the eternal that there could be a material world, a world in which chance might be found, in which any process could go wrong, in which anything might happen "contrary to nature." Such information would arise from perception, though how one could know what was wrong or contrary to nature is not explained. Perception, not being knowledge, might furnish one with problems, but it could scarcely tell one anything. Sometimes Aristotle speaks of the prior without qualification. Thus, to recall a passage already referred to (De caelo, 286 a 18) the natural is prior to the unnatural; in the Metaphysics (1010 b 37) the mover, the essential (1065 b 2), the changeless (1063 a 13), the form (1084 b 5) are all prior. In De caelo (286 a 25) the positive is prior to its privation, the one to the many within a genus, the simple to the complex (286 b 16). In all of these cases Aristotle is speaking about epistemological priority, though he does not say so, and asserting that one cannot know the unnatural, the moved, the accidental, the chang- ing, the privative, the many, the complex, until one has known the appropriate natural, the unmoved, the essential, the unchanged, the positive, the one, the simple. But when we speak of "knowing" these things, we cannot mean by "to know" "to have knowl- edge of the four causes," for none of them has any causes. They are themselves essences which serve as causes for other things, final and formal causes, VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] 15</page><page sequence="15">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE not efficient or material. They must be known in some other fashion. And that other fashion is contemplation. That Aristotle believed in the mind's power to con- template universals needs no proof. But if one desires a clear statement of what such contemplation would be like, one of the best would be in the third book of De anima, chapter 7. There actual knowledge, as differentiated from potential, is said to be identical with its object. In his own words, "In general the mind in its actuality is the thing of [which it is thinking]."'6 This is not unlike the mystic vision of God in its identification of subject and object. There can be no falsity here, for falsity occurs only in syn- thesis (ibid., 430 b 2). Synthesis is effectuated through the power of reasoning, but why the reasoning power should make these syntheses is left obscure. For contemplation could not be mistaken about a complex intelligible. At the risk of over-simplification, then, we can say that Aristotle assumes a serial order to exist in all subject-matters. This order makes a chain of reason- ing possible, for by its means one can pass from posterior to prior and sometimes from prior to pos- terior. The order is at times broken in the world of observation where chance events occur, but that world is not subject to rational discourse. Though Aristotle uses empirical observation to refute others and sometimes to corroborate his own ideas, as we shall see, he does not use it to justify his belief in order. Order is not simply a descriptive term; it is also normative. For that which is prior in any sense of the term is better than that which is posterior, in spite of the fact that Aristotle is not a laudator temporis acti. The things which he lists as prior in some sense are always the better and he also maintains that "where one is better and another worse, the better is always prior" (Metaphysics, 999 a 13). In this passage he is thinking of forms or genera and, since later thinkers believed that the genera were susceptible of a hier- archical arrangement, it was possible for them to read into their logical hierarchy a hierarchy of value. On that basis the Neo-Platonists were to identify the ens realissimum with the ens perfectissimum and goodness was to be measured by a degree of "reality." The only good for anything was to be itself, not, however, as an individual with all an individual's peculiarities, but as the exemplification of a class. The eternal forms, being the standards of perfection, could not be bad. Perversions, on the other hand, just because they were not anything completely, were intrinsically evil (Metaphysics, 1051 a 21). In accordance with this we are to assume, he says (Physics, 260 b 22), that the better exists in nature. So again he says in the Politics (1252 b 34) that the final cause and end of 16 Op. cit., 431 b 16. He had previously said (430 a 4), "Theo- retical understanding and that which is understood through it are the same." a thing is the best or comes out with the principle, "Nothing that is contrary to nature is good" (ibid., 1325 b 9). This principle had of course been used frequently before, notably by the Cynics; it was part of Greek proverbial philosophy. But in Aristotle its meaning had become the very reverse of what it had been for either the Cynics or any of the other cultural primitivists. In them it entailed taking the savages and animals as exemplars of the good life. In Aristotle on the contrary it meant following the gods, seeking the Unmoved Mover. For to him that which was contrary to nature was bound to be either that which did not achieve its natural purpose or that which realized one of its accidents rather than its essence. Thus evil could be identified with the incomplete. It ought by now to be clear that, if Aristotle thought of things and events as being ordered in various series and directed attention to the prior rather than to the posterior, it was because the prior was always better than the posterior. The man who studies the be- ginnings of things will have insight into their "real" nature, their essential character, and thus acquire the means of seeing their relation to other members of the logical matrix which is the secret of the universe. But the fact that things are arranged in a serial order is not developed in any detail in the corpus. On the contrary, priority and posteriority are usually men- tioned as obtaining between two things, not a whole collection. Even in the Organon there is nothing re- sembling the Tree of Porphyry though the materials are there for such a development. But we are post- poning any discussion of possible hierarchies until later. 3. PERCEPTUAL EVIDENCE It has been customary in some quarters to contrast Aristotle and Plato as men who relied on experience and on reason respectively. When it is said that one must be either an Aristotelian or a Platonist, a choice seems to be indicated between empiricism and ration- alism, as if philosophy could utilize experience un- organized by reason or reason detached from experi- ence. The justification for emphasizing the empiricism of Aristotle, aside from Pliny's story of Alexander's sending him back specimens from Asia for biological investigations, is found both in the kind of evidence which he calls upon in his works and the principles of methodology which he assumes to be right. Some of his works open with discussions of his predecessors' views, discussions which attempt to refute them or to show their incompleteness, but which look like examinations of logically possible doctrines which are to be objectively studied. In fact, he has usually been cited as the first of the historians of philosophy. Then there are such works as the Athenian Constitutions, the Sophistic Refutations, and in part the Historia Animalium, which look like collec- tions of data which he and subsequent scholars might 16 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="16">METHODOLOGICAL ASSUMPTIONS study without having to collect the material them- selves-in short, source books. There is also the tradition which is passed on by Diogenes Laertius (V, 29) that "The criterion of truth in the field of that which is apprehended by perception is sensation, but in the field of ethics, politics, and household manage- ment, it is the reason." This distinction, like most of the dicta of Diogenes, is false. Aristotle used ordinary experience in all fields when it suited his purposes. For instance, in the Nichomachean Ethics (1104 a 13) he says in so many words that "it is necessary to use the evidence of the sensible when studying the non- sensible." And as an example he cites the effect of immoderate drinking, eating, and exercise on health in support of his doctrine of the mean. In the very opening of the Physics he asserts that we must begin with the things which are "more knowable to us" and proceed thence to the things which are "more know- able in their nature." The former are what we perceive, the latter the physical laws which we erect upon them. "That which is obvious and clear to us in the first place is things which are mixed conglom- erates; later from these arises the knowledge of the elements and first principles through analysis" (Physics, 184 a 21). The former are particulars, the latter universals (ibid., 189 a 7). And when he criticizes the Italian philosophers "known as Pythagoreans" in De caelo (293 a 20) for their doctrine of the counter-earth, he says, "They are not seeking for the reasons and causes of what they observe, but drawing on their own reasons and opinions and trying to adjust observations to them." In the same treatise (295 b 20) he appeals to observation to prove the earth's sphericity; and in De generatione et corruptione (314 b 12) he appeals to fact to establish the existence of alteration. Perhaps the clearest statement of the empirical side of his thinking is in De caelo (279 b 18), where he says, "We should rationally assert only what we see occurring in many or all cases." The reason has its object in the universal and the closest one can get to the universal in experience is that which occurs "on the whole." This is never the true universal which can be reached only by the reason, but never- theless observation is both used by him to back up his a priori arguments and justified by his methodological assumptions.'7 In spite of all this Aristotle cannot be justly called an empiricist if by that term is meant someone who maintains that truth can be obtained exclusively through perception. He does say that sensations are always true (De anima, 428 a 11), but there he means simply that when one is seeing red or tasting sweet, one cannot be deceived into thinking the former to be blue and the latter bitter. But this is not scientific 17 See among dozens of other places De anima, 421 b 8, where he is discussing smell, and De generatione animalium, 729 b, on the part played by the semen. knowledge. The relation between scientific knowl- edge and observation is expounded most clearly in the Posterior Analytics, Book I, chapter 31. There he says, Understanding is not acquired through sensation. For even if sensation is of some specific quality and not of a thing of such a quality, nevertheless one must perceive some particular specimen and somewhere and now. But the universal and that which occurs in all things it is im- possible to perceive. For the universal is not a "this" nor is it now. For if it were, it would not be universal. For we say that a universal is always and everywhere. Since then deductive proofs are universal and cannot be per- ceived, it is evident that there is no scientific understanding through sensation. But it is obvious that even if one could perceive that the triangle had angles equal to two right angles, we should still seek proof and not, as some say, perceive it. For one must perceive particulars and scien- tific understanding is knowledge of the universal. Where- fore even if we were on the moon and saw the earth ob- scured, we should not know the cause of the eclipse. For we would perceive that it is eclipsed now and in no wise why, for perception is not of that which always happens. Of course in spite of this, through seeing it happen frequently, by hunting for the universal we should have a proof. For from several particular observations the universal becomes evident. And the universal is valuable because it makes manifest the cause. So that concerning such things as those whose cause is other than themselves, knowledge of the universal is more valuable than perceptions and ra- tional insight (vooiowcos). But of first things there is an- other theory. It is evident that it is impossible for per- ception to understand anything of deductive proof, unless someone should call this perception, that is, having under- standing through proofs. Nevertheless sometimes prob- lems arise through a blockage of perception (els ala6Omro-?s EKXE\tLV). For if we should see some things, we should seek no further, not that we know by seeing, but because we obtain the universal from seeing. Such a case would occur if we should see the burning-glass penetrated and the light passing through, it would be obvious why a flame arose, because we should be seeing it separately in each case and would know at once that in all cases it would happen in this way. There are three details in this account which call for comment. First, Aristotle makes a sharp dis- tinction between sensory perception and scientific un- derstanding; the former is always of particulars, lo- cated in space and time, the latter of universals. Second, universal knowledge can be obtained by observing a large number of particulars and abstract- ing that which is common to them all. Third, sci- entific knowledge is knowledge of the why. In regard to the first point, Aristotle must here be identifying perception with a kind of judgment, an assertion of something or other, not with the simple apprehension of sensory qualities such as have ap- peared in the tradition called English Empiricism or in our own times Neo-Realism. For obviously, "red," "sweet," "hard," are neither true nor false, whereas the propositions, "This apple is red," "This lump of sugar is sweet," "This stone is hard," may be true or false and also may be verified by perception. To put such judgments into words raises the problem of the 17 VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959]</page><page sequence="17">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE Meno, for we could not make the judgments without previous knowledge of the universals involved, at least in the subjects of our propositions. Second, apparently Aristotle assumes that such universals are present in the particular experiences, since he says that we can abstract them from the experiences. But if they are present there, there is no reason to seek further for them. One experience ought to suffice. The fact that such universals appear here and now might simply imply that universals can appear in space and time. Indeed if they could not, a thousand instances would be no better than one and the use of the terms, "everywhere," "always," and "on the whole," would be at best metaphorical. No one will deny that experience is localized and dated and that one cannot reach the "always" and the "everywhere" from a finite number of dates and locations. At most one could conclude that as far as one's own experience was concerned and as far as it was confirmed by reports of the experience of others, such and such always happens everywhere. If we assume that given certain conditions, all human ob- servation will be alike, then obviously we ought to be able to state those conditions and draw from experi- ence certain universal traits. But the assumption begs the question, for what we are trying to do is to derive a homogeneous quality from admittedly heter- ogeneous experiences. If we set up conditions which will make the experiences homogeneous, then clearly they will be homogeneous. Third, the knowledge which the universals give us is not the apprehension of universal qualities or configurations or sequences, but of the cause, the why. If we are on the moon and see the earth passing between us and the sun or see our planet, Luna, pass between the sun and the earth, and if we see this happen frequently, we may conclude that the cause of the eclipse is the relative position of the three bodies in question. It is hard to see why more than one experience of this sort would be needed either to see an eclipse or to demonstrate the cause of eclipses. In fact, once given the movements of the three bodies in question, it seems hardly necessary to do more than reason to the possibility of one's ob- scuring the light of the other. The possibility is not of course an actuality, but once foreseeing the possi- bility, the experience would be simply an instance of what had been foreseen. At the end of the Posterior Analytics, as in the first chapter of the Metaphysics, Aristotle takes up this question again. In the former place (99 b 20) he says, That one who does not know the primary immediate premises cannot have understanding through proofs has been said above. But one might raise questions about knowledge of the immediate, whether it is the same or not the same or whether there is understanding of each [or not], or whether knowledge of the one is of a kind different from knowledge of the other, or whether the faculties are innate or, if innate, whether they are unconscious. If on the one hand we do have it, it is strange. For it would mean that, though we have knowledge more precise than proof, it is occult. But if on the other hand we did not possess it a priori, how would we know and learn from knowledge which we did not possess? For it would be impossible, as we also said in the case of proof. Therefore, it is obvious that we neither have such nor could it arise in us if we have no knowledge and no such faculty. Hence we must have some potentiality of knowledge but not such as to be of a higher degree of accuracy. And this appears to reside in all animals. For they have an innate power of judgment which they call sensation. And of the innate sensation in some animals only the sensory object inheres, but in others it does not. Hence those in which it does not inhere have no knowledge beyond what they sense, either totally or of those things of which they do not possess knowledge innately. But those which do perceive it [the sensory object] retain it in the soul. Yet there is a difference among many such, so that to some there is born an understanding out of a single one of such percep- tions, to others not. From perception comes memory, as we say, and from memory of the same thing frequently repeated comes experience. For many memories are one experience. And from experience or from the whole re- maining as a whole in the soul comes the one superseding the many, which would retain its unity in [the variety of] these things, the source of art and science; if it should be concerned with coming into being, art; if with being, science. His conclusion is that knowledge is neither innate nor an emanation of higher powers of the soul, but is derived from sensation. The conclusion that the Les, the soul's power of forming general ideas, can be synthesized out of a number of perceptions, rests upon the assumption that each percept has a definite isolable quality which can be repeated identically. This is harmonious with another assumption of Aristotle which he uses in his discussion of qualitative change, to the effect that whenever such a change occurs, floating qualities pass from one object to another. We shall discuss this when we come to the topic of change. But we may now say that he is driven to some such assumption by his fear of having to accept Plato's myth of reminis- cence as a solution to the problem of the Meno. The soul's function of skimming off the identities in per- cepts which are otherwise diverse, needs no special explanation since after all the soul has to have some function and by this one it can provide itself with those general ideas which it requires for both art and science. That science might be based upon universals would be disputed by no one before the seventeenth century, if after; that art too is based upon them could be asserted only by a man who believed that works of art somehow embodied generic traits, that is, that they should all be classified in genres. This would be plausible whether one was talking of works of fine art or of the crafts. For whether one is think- ing of statues of the gods or allegories of the virtues and vices, whether one is talking of the making of shoes or the curing of diseases, there is a sameness in each field which permits the laying down of rules 18 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="18">METHODOLOGICAL ASSUMPTIONS according to which the practitioner may operate. We shall omit any discussion of whether Greek art was more standardized than ours. At any rate Aristotle's Poetics shows that as far as dramatic literature was concerned, he thought it possible to establish certain genres and to draw up the rules for embodying each. The introduction of the animals into this argument is of interest because it illustrates an assumption of which Aristotle makes use only occasionally. That is the assumption that from the minerals to man there is a series of psychic levels, not continuous to be sure, but nevertheless susceptible of being so arranged that the "lower" levels will stand as matter to the upper. It comes out most clearly when he is speaking of biology and psychology and is one of the details which gave some reason to later thinkers who wanted to find a chain of beings in Aristotle. Such later thinkers are to be found of course among the Neo-Platonists, who in distinction to Aristotle built up a hierarchy with no gaps in it whatsoever. Aristotle, it should be emphasized, does not say that the lower orders of existence evolve into the higher or that they emanate from the higher. But he does say in his psychological treatises that man has three psychic faculties corre- sponding to the three animate kingdoms, that the vegetative powers are matter in relation to the sensi- tive, the sensitive being matter in relation to the rational. Oddly enough, to return to our main thread of exposition, there are two ideas needed for the forma- tion of universals which could not by their very nature be consolidated out of individual concepts: the ideas of "always" and "everywhere." Though one might perceive redness or sweetness or Aristotle's favorite "snubness," one cannot perceive temporal and spatial universality. These, as was to be argued by Kant, are prior to all perception. Even if one translate "always" into "always within my experience," that is not the same thing as perceiving "always." For at most one perceives a collection of things and, unless there is in each percept a given characteristic, one cannot perceive it, however much one may justly infer its existence. But no percept has the character of either "always" or "everywhere." Moreover, even if a memory, the consolidation of a set of percepts, has a given characteristic, that characteristic is a static being, given here and now, when and where the memory arises. It cannot bridge the gap between past and present, to say nothing of projecting itself into the future. I am far from arguing that we do not extrapolate our perceptions into the past and future and in the interperceptual moments. I am simply saying that this is very different from apprehending the universality of universals in perception. Univer- sality is probably conferred upon experiences by us, as if we were setting up hypotheses to be upset, if necessary, at a later date. But that is not Aristotle's way of treating the problem. He is anxious to base all knowledge on sensation in such a manner that the most general ideas may be a purification of it by the "natural" process of actualization. The Kantian problem was not anticipated by him and in the Categories, chapter 9, he simply dismisses time and space as "easily understood." My point then, let me say at the risk of tiresome repetition, is not simply that even a large collection of experiences does not equal "always" and "everwhere," but that the Aris- totelian method of abstracting qualities in order to get universals will work only if the universals are present in each member of the collection. A score of snub noses has snubness present in each nose. But a million snub noses do not have "always" and "every- where" present in any snub nose. One of the differentiae of this type of philosophy is the relegation of time to so unimportant a position that it need scarcely be mentioned. To define it as the measure of motion locates it well this side of eternity and Aristotle in his Metaphysics clearly wishes to describe all true being as motionless. The world of observation, which is the world of matter, diversity, chance, perversion, monsters, and other entities irreconcilable with a world of reason, is not a mere "apparent" world. It has its own reality. But at the risk of being anachronistic we may say that it is the world of natural science, not the world of philosophy. Aristotle takes over from his prede- cessors, especially from Plato, the distinction between the realm of observation and the realm of reason, but, unlike his predecessors, he attempts here and there to show how the latter might emerge out of the former. But he is incapable of accepting change as an ultimate reality. The flux had to be explained away and one of his fundamental problems was that of showing how it could be explained away. When observation gives him corroboration of what the reason demands, he is only too happy to say so. When it fails to give him what reason says it ought to give him, he is also willing to correct his, though it is usually other people's, reasoning. He is, for instance, willing to accept the irregular movements of the planets on the basis of what he sees. But when he comes to his fundamental metaphysical concepts, such as matter and form, essence and accident, actuality and potentiality, he is so tied to them that it makes little difference whether their presence can make itself felt in observation or not. Certain things must be, and that is the end of it. One of the most famous examples of what must be, whether one can find any empirical evidence for it or not, is the distinction be- tween the active and the passive reasons. Another is the existence of an Unmoved Mover for whatever is in motion. But such details will be taken up in more appropriate places. 19 VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959]</page><page sequence="19">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE 4. EX NIHILO NIHIL The thesis that nothing can come from nothing was attributed to Epicurus by Lucretius and attributed to him as one of the greatest benefactions that any philosopher had ever conferred upon the human race. In De rerum natura the thesis is interpreted in two ways: (1) as maintaining that all things emerge out of pre-existing matter, and (2) that there is a set of irrefrangible laws in accordance with which all change takes place, in other words, a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for all changes. The reduction of all being to constellations of atoms is an example of the first usage; the emphasis upon the purgative effects of the knowledge of natural law is a good example of the second. As he says (De rerum natura, V, 55-8), . . . rationes persequor ac doceo dictis, quo quaeque creata foedere sint, in eo quam sit durare necessum nec ualida ualeant aeui rescindere leges . . . Such laws need not be descriptive of the behavior of material bodies at all, though, I imagine, Lucretius thought that it all could be reduced to such laws. For even the laws of the falling atoms were interrupted when the atoms swerved. Lucretius's piety to his master caused him to over- look the use of the same assumption in Aristotle. We find in De caelo (302 a 3), "It is possible for one body to be generated out of another . . . but it is impossible for a body to be generated from no preexisting quan- tity." Here the principle refers to the generation of material objects only. Just what Aristotle meant by corporeal quantity is not clear. Stocks translated the Greek equivalent "mass." But this is anachronistic. The word is unqualified in this passage, but Aristotle is probably referring to spatial extension. For in the Physics (255 b 23) he speaks of the quantitative spreading out of bodies as if volume were the distin- guishing mark of corporeal quantity. Yet again in De caelo (273 a 24) weight is directly correlated with it in the argument that an infinite body would have to have infinite weight. This may not, to be sure, be an inconsistency, inasmuch as he probably means by an "infinite body" a body of infinite extent. The question became of some importance in the subsequent history of natural science, for by the assumption of ex nihilo nihil a search had to be made for the pre- existing body out of which the post-existing was generated. How was one to find it? Was one to measure the volume of the latter and see whether it equaled the volume of the former? Or was one to weigh the two and establish an identity of weight? As we now know, it was finally decided about the time of Lavoisier that weight was the criterion of "amount," though even after his time there were people who be- lieved in the existence of imponderable bodies, caloric for instance. Hence the principle ex nihilo in material changes was translated into the formula, "The weight of the product must be equal to the weight of its ma- terial source."18 The principle appears in such a doctrine as that of the conservation of mass which in practice was determined by weighing substances both before and after changes had taken place. Hence the creation of matter was flatly denied as a possibility. This first form of the principle is seen most clearly in De generatione et corruptione. On the foundation of the belief that every genetic change may go in either of two directions, in the direction of a form or of its privation, Aristotle lays down the postulate that all perceptible matter is composed of the four elements which in turn are combinations of two qualities and their privations: heat and cold, moisture and dryness. Heat and moisture are the positive qualities, cold and dryness their privations. Beneath these elementary qualities lies the substratum which is undifferentiated and serves only as a subject for the attributes named. For Aristotle has to have a sub- ject for any attribute. The substratum does not itself change; indeed nothing happens within it. If the nineteenth century invented the ether as a subject for the verb "to undulate," so Aristotle invented the substratum as a substance which might have the primary attributes. It is the elements, Fire, Air, Water, and Earth which change (De generatione et corruptione, 328 b 36). Though I am repeating the obvious, let us note that Fire is hot and dry, Air hot and moist, Water cold and moist, and Earth cold and dry (ibid., Book II, chapter 4). All that has to happen is that one of the qualities be lost for one element to be transmuted into another. In this way Fire can turn into Air by losing its dryness, for the privation of dryness is moisture. If Air loses its heat only cold can take its place, and thus Water will come out of it. If Water loses its moisture, it will turn into Earth and one half of the cycle of transmutations is completed. The other half begins when Earth loses its coldness and becomes Fire.19 More complex changes need not be discussed here since we are in- terested only in Aristotle's use of the principle ex nihilo. And since Aristotle has no theory of creation to contend with, but believes in the eternity of the cosmos, the cycle goes on forever and always has been going on. Now it is noticeable that Aristotle does not make any serious attempt to state the conditions under which the cyclical change in the elements takes place, unless it is due to the Sun's relation to the ecliptic 18 It is obvious, I trust, that I am not attributing this formula to any specific scientist. 19 It may be noted in passing for what it is worth that the only element which possesses two positive qualities is Air. Yet in Meteorologica, 379 a 16, he says that Earth, Water, and Air are as matter to Fire. Cf. De generatione et corruptione, 335 a 19. It is strange to find something resembling a form which is quali- fied by a privation. 20 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="20">METHODOLOGICAL ASSUMPTIONS (cf. De generatione et corruptione, Book II, chapter 10), which is doubtful. The question of why Fire should ever lose its heat or Water its moisture does not seem to arise. To discover now why he does not raise such questions would require a kind of mind-reading of which I confess to being incapable The probability is that he was satisfied to posit this cycle of changes as "natural" and for that reason needing no explanation. This then is an example of the first use of the dictum, the use which treats the preposition ex seri- ously, so that the result actually comes out of its source. But Aristotle also uses it in the second sense, that nothing happens without a cause if the occurrence is "in accordance with nature." In fact, though he believes in chance events, he treats chance as if it too were a cause and not simply a name for occurrences whose cause he is unable to identify (Cf. Below chap- ter 2, section 2). The doctrine of the four causes is a doctrine which lays down those items which must be discovered if any event is to be understood and it is assumed that, since the cosmos is intelligible, they can all four be discovered. If one knows what the final cause of an event is, only certain things can happen, all of which may be summed up in the phrase, "the realization of forms." This does not deny the possibility of accidents happening or of artificial changes taking place. In the purely material realm the elements can be displaced and in the biological the plants and animals can be eaten before they reach maturity and produce young. But physical science is to his way of thinking the science of how things would behave if there was no interference with the processes of nature. Once envisioned in this way, Lucretius' praise of Epicurus could well be applied to Aristotle also, for in his view there is a limit to caprice too. Not everything can happen. The preposition ex is now interpreted metaphorically and signifies the necessary and sufficient conditions for a natural change. It operates as the principle of the uniformity of nature operated in the nineteenth century, as a check upon fantasy. As Aristotle says himself (ibid., 333 b 5), "All things which come to be naturally come to be either always or on the whole; but the things which do not come to be always or on the whole are the results of chance or spontaneity." This sentence comes from a criticism of Empedocles who, he main- tains, does not show us why man always comes to be from man and wheat from wheat and so on.20 That men are not born of dogs or wheat from clover could be observed, but that all changes occur in a uniform fashion is an assumption. It is an assumption to be sure which anyone makes who wishes to give a ra- tional account of things, though it should also be granted that, if a common noun is used as a classifier, any event which differs in its pattern from any other will be given a separate name. Thus, if we did find 20 The weakness of his criticism of Empedocles is clearly shown by Cherniss, Presocratics, 120. something that looked like a baby emerging out of a cabbage, we should be forced either to set up two varieties of human beings or to deny that the creature was a human baby. Aristotle almost reaches this latter point when he discusses slavery in the Politics (Book I, chapter 5), for he insists that natural slaves are closer to animals than to men. In fact he says that nature desires to make the differentiation her- self, since she makes slaves strong for labor and free- men upright (1254 b 25). But, he admits with a certain regret, both types of anthropoid are men. One of the cardinal principles of Aristotle's method of identification and hence of classification is uni- formity of behavior. It is a commonplace upon which I shall not dwell that in the Organon one de- fines by genus and differentia and that the definition expresses the essence. But since in all natural change the essence and the final cause are identical and since the final cause is manifested by the persistent un- deviating pursuit of a single end, it is not surprising to come upon a sentence such as that in the Politics (1253 a 23) to the effect that things are defined by their function and potency (&lt;poyC KaL r.j bvva'&amp;tE). Or again in De anima (416 b 23) that all things ought to be named after their ends, their final causes, a doc- trine which is repeated in the Nichomachean Ethics (1115 b 23). Aristotle obviates the difficulty of an end's emerging ex nihilo by his invention of poten- tiality. If the end, the final cause, is somehow or other in the first term of a natural series, the principle will not be contradicted. But it is so present in living beings in the entelechy and in non-living in their potencies. Potentiality is little more than a word for the fact that processes do follow a regular course when left alone, that is, when no accidents happen. To say that the chicken is potentially in the egg is not to anticipate the doctrine of pre- formationism: Aristotle is not saying that a micro- scopic chicken is in the egg. He is simply saying that, other things being equal, the egg will hatch into a chicken and not into something else. It is a short- hand expression for a complicated description of a total event. Nevertheless, he speaks of the dynameis as if they were somehow or other present in the matter, developing step by step into the final stage of their evolution. Thus he satisfies the demands of the principle ex nihilo and at the same time recognizes the perceptible differences between the completed being and the inchoate or incomplete being. More- over he seems to fulfill its twofold demand, that of the pre-existence of the effect in the cause and that of uniformity of behavior. Regardless of this, it is obvious that something in the effect is not detectible in the cause or, if one prefer, in the initial stages which lead up to the effect. That is, of course, whatever differentiates the latter from the former. No one ever thought that a chicken looked like an egg or behaved like an egg. 21 VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959]</page><page sequence="21">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE As the egg develops, it changes continually in some respects; otherwise one would not be able to tell the egg and the chicken apart. The emergence of these new properties is not explained on the principle ex nihilo in so far as that principle demands that nothing new occur. The later philosophers-in which term I include scientists-relegated everything which could not be attributed to whatever existed in the initial stages of a process or to the cause to a secondary kind of being, usually called appearance or the subjective. This was not Aristotle's technique. He did, to be sure, retain something identical throughout his proc- esses, namely primary matter, but it was the pri- mary matter which did not change. It was there simply to sustain the changes. It served the same function as mass in classical physics or as those things which had the primary qualities in Locke or, for that matter, the atoms in Democritus. Yet ver- bally Aristotle could say when challenged that nothing was in the effect which was not previously in the cause since it all was there potentially. A second immutable was the pattern of the change. Here the principle once more switches its meaning and that which happens always or on the whole be- comes that which is real. By emphasizing one side of the interpretation or the other one can turn Aristotle into a Whitehead avant la lettre or into an old fashioned materialist. The root of the ambiguity lies in the con- fusion of basic metaphors. In terms of artistry, the matter is inert, molded by the artisan into a fixed form. There is nothing materially in the statue which was not present in the matter-though a good bit of the original matter has been discarded if not lost. In terms of growth, there is a good bit in the terminus which was not present in the beginning but the design of the process is uniform. The problem which confronted Aristotle and which he seems never to have clarified in his own mind was that of choosing between these two figures of speech. Should he anial- yze the world into a sheaf of processes or events each with a temporal dimension, or into a collection of things which moved about in space but which never changed internally? The doctrine of potentiality and actuality was undoubtedly based upon the observa- tion of processes which occurred in a regular fashion.2' But a longitudinal section of such processes would have shown him that the doctrine violated the strict interpretation of the principle. Hence he preferred to think of them as if each stage in the process en- 21 The word 5bbpauts had a variety of meanings in Greek. It could be used for the virtue of a drug, the power of a number, strength, and so on, as Liddell and Scott will show. But Aristotle himself uses the word in several senses. Some of these are dis- tinguished in Metaphysics, Theta, chapter 1, e.g., the power of acting to produce certain effects and the power of being acted upon in certain ways. These powers are clearly limited. For instance, Fire has no power to cool things and liquid Water has no power of being carved into cubes. But see Bonitz's Index s.v. for further information. veloped that which pre-existed in the earlier stages. In other words he attempted to interpret processes as if they had no temporal dimension and were things. And if one took the notion of potencies literally, then indeed the final cause could be seen to have pre- existed in the matter and the principle was saved. But there was always the world of observation to prevent complete uniformity. By making a distinc- tion between the natural and the unnatural and treating the latter as if it were of little philosophic importance, Aristotle was able to retain the uniformity of nature and forget the irregularities. In his defence it must be said that the most mathe- matical of scientists of our own times will be confronted with an analogous dilemma. If he is going to describe nature as it seems, that is, as it exists outside of lab- oratories, raw nature, he will clearly not have the beautiful orderliness which he needs. That nature is various, changing, unreliable, except in so far as common language orders it by means of its nouns, adjectives, and relational phrases, the meaning of which we try to keep constant. He too has a second world, the world of facts under laboratory conditions, the world which is as he describes it to be ceteris paribus or mutatis mutandis. It too is an ideal world, not in the sense that he imagines it or that it exists as he would like it to be or as it ought to be, but in the sense that it exists on paper or in the purified realm of thought. The pragmatic value of such a construc- tion is very great and surely needs no justification, especially from one who is not a scientist. But when it is constructed, the philosopher will be bound to consider its relation to the world of observation. Much of Aristotle is closer to common-sense ob- servation-the physical writings in particular-than what one finds in contemporary science. And this merely proves that science should not be too faithful to common-sense if it is to be rational. 5. THE PRINCIPLE OF PARSIMONY The principle of parsimony is usually phrased in mediaeval Latin: Entia non multiplicanda sunt praeter necessitatem. This sentence, erroneously attributed to William of Occam,22 leaves two terms undefined, entia and necessitas. I point this out since those entities which enter into the discussion must be chosen in accordance with some principle of selection. If they are simply the crude facts, they will be relevant to nothing. For instance, as I look out of my window, the variety of perceptual components in the scene are so various that, before anything of rational interest can be said about them, I have to classify them. As a visual experience they raise no particular identi- 22 On the principle of parsimony in Occam, see W. M. Thor- burn, The myth of Occam's razor, Mind 27: 345, 1918. Cf. P. E. B.

I must first have some questions to put to them. As soon as I do that, the details begin to sort themselves out. For example, I see some oak trees the terminal leaves of which have turned brown, although I am writing these words in July. The concessive clause here points to the prob- lem. I also see a bank of sand stretching into the little bay which lies before the house in which I am staying and which was not there last year. There is a new house in the middle distance. Some of the trees have lost their crowns. And so it goes. My sense of curiosity selects novelties in the situation and before I realize what I have been doing, I have begun to arrange what I see into the familiar and the un- familiar. The entities about which I am thinking are no longer differentiated simply by their sensory char- acteristics; they are differentiated on the basis of what I already thought would be there and what is either no longer there or what is now there and was not there previously-as far as I can recall-the last time I saw this landscape. But my curiosity could orient itself in quite different fashion.- If I were a painter, I might observe the pattern of shapes and colors, the interplay between lights and darks, the changes in color as the scene recedes, the striations of blue, green, and grey in the water, the glaring whiteness of a gull which has just alighted on the bay. If I were a botanist or a geographer, I would see still other en- tities and neglect those which are actually of interest to me who am none of these things. All this is obvious. When then one speaks of the multiplication of entities, one always has in mind preliminary classifi- cations in terms of which relevance will be established. These classifications will serve both to simplify the scene and to permit throwing out certain data as of no interest. But I take it for granted that, if I am awake and not dreaming, only certain things can happen and those things, however much they may be controlled by forces over which I can exercise no power, can be observed only if I already possess some clue as to what is likely to happen and what not likely. These clues are of course acquired in my past experience, which term has to include my education, but no one's education covers all possibilities. The matter of necessity is still more difficult to resolve. We must first decide what we need the entities for. If our purpose is to make as complete an inventory of the data as is possible, we need as many entities as we can gather to complete the job. We shall probably first lay down the conditions of observation: are they to be the naked eye, the eye plus other sense organs, sense organs supplemented by certain instruments such as microscopes of various degrees of power? Then there is the question of the frame of observation in terms of which we shall limit the frontiers of the scene and these must be both spatial and temporal: how inclusive are "here" and "now"? But there are other customary questions in which we may be interested, as many as the number of our fundamental metaphysical categories, whether we use the categories of Plato or Aristotle or Kant or some invented by ourselves. Aristotle's correspond pretty closely to what grammarians call the parts of speech, plus the voices'and tenses of the Greek verbs. Like most of his logic, they come from a codification of common sense. Each category can raise a question to which certain entities will be relevant and others not. Moreover, each will determine limits of rele- vance in the sense that they will tell us how far we have to go in answering the questions which we have to put to the facts. Thus, if we are interested in dates, it is not necessary to introduce data such as color or shape unless we have previously discovered that a correlation can be made between them and dates. Fruits and flowers, for instance, change their color and shape as they mature and animals change their shape and sometimes their color. Hence it is safe to say that the determination of the limitations of multiplication is prior to inquiry. In Aristotle's opinion these limits are laid down by nature which exhibits a pattern in terms of which basic classifications must be made. If there are only four elements, one cannot introduce a fifth when one stumbles against some apparent fact which does not manifest one or a combination of the rules in accord- ance with which the four accepted elements behave.23 If, for instance, one comes upon a stone which rises automatically into the air, one can only say (1) that it contains some air or fire within it, or (2) that the occurrence is an accident, an illusion, or, of course, a miracle, or (3) that some aerial blast has propelled it into the air. One cannot say that it contains an anti-terrine principle, for that would be multiplying entities beyond necessity. The behavior of the four elements and the compounds will suffice to explain the event. Thus in criticizing the followers of Anaxa- goras (De caelo, 302 b 21), Aristotle points out that there is no necessity of postulating an infinity of elements since a finite number will give the same results. In the Physics (259 a 12) again he asserts that the existence of one mover is sufficient to explain all motion and hence one need not assume the exis- tence of several. In the Metaphysics (990 a 34) he assails those who "posit the ideas as causes" on the same ground and later (991 a 9) argues that the ideas contribute nothing to sensible things, either to their being known or to their being.24 It will also be re- called that, when he is discussing the kinds of locomo- tion (Physics, 243 a 16) and decides that they are four in number, pulling, pushing, carrying, and twirl- 23 What follows is irrelevant to the reasons for Aristotle's in- troducing the fifth substance, the aether in De caelo, Book I, chapters 2 and 3. 24 This is repeated almost verbatim in Metaphysics, Mu, chapter 5. 23 VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959]</page><page sequence="23">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE ing, he immediately proceeds to demonstrate that they can be reduced to two, pushing and pulling. Since carrying must be done by a vehicle which is itself pulled, pushed, or twirled, and the object carried may be stationary on the vehicle, there is no need to posit carrying as basic. And since twirling consists of pull- ing one part and pushing another at the same time, twirling may also be eliminated. Thus carrying and twirling are unnecessary. Now as far as observation is concerned, carrying and twirling exist. They are unnecessary only if one's primary task is the intellectual simplification of ob- servation. To say that of two perceptually different things one is a form of the other is not to deny their difference but to assert conditions under which the difference will be observed. The reduction of twirling to pushing and pulling is an explanation of the occur- rence of something seen, namely twirling, not its an- nihilation. In fact the preliminary classification of the four kinds of locomotion is a recognition of the real existence of those kinds which it will be his purpose to explain. But to explain something is not to eliminate it except in so far as it is puzzling. One can say, if one wishes, that twirling does not "really" exist, but in that case the adverb "really" is equiva- lent to the more cumbersome phrase, "in the realm of discourse chosen." So a philologist may say that the words, "war," "guerre," "guerra," are all "really" "wehr," since they are all derived from it.25 Or a chemist might say that a compound is "really" the elements which compose its molecules. But this is a transfer of the entities of science or epistemology to ontology. The adverb in fact introduces more prob- lems than it solves. The principle of parsimony is a methodological principle, not a metaphysical principle. Metaphysically it has at times taken the form of asserting that nature always follows the simplest course. If it is simpler to produce an effect with one cause rather than with two, then nature will produce it with one. That great advances have been made in the sciences by adhering to this principle is undeniable. But the advances are in the direction of greater in- telligibility, not in that of simplifying nature itself, in reducing the multiplicity which exists. We do not know what nature finds simple and what complex; the attribution of such motivation to nature is myth- ological in any case. It anthropomorphizes the ob- jective world in a manner which might well turn into superstition. After all the simplest thing for nature to have done was to leave the universe in its primor- dial state of undifferentiated matter. To have done nothing at all would be even simpler. If in place of nature we substitute the word "God," we are no better off, for as soon as the Creator said, "Let there be light," difference entered the scene and with it complexity. We have to distinguish here between 25 I trust that no one will think that any philologist ever did say so. the needs of cognition and the needs of that which is cognized. Apparently the latter can tolerate so great a diversity of kinds and manners that imprecise writers often call it infinite. It need not be infinite in any literal sense to be highly bewildering to the lovers of simplicity. But it is, regardless of that, very great. Knowledge itself is the simplifier, not God or nature. They are the complicators. As long as we think of cognition as a reflection of the objective order, then our cognitive simplifications will be thought of as the uncovering of an underlying arrangement of things. But that arrangement may be nothing more than a projection of our technique of classification into our subject-matter. Suppose, to take an imaginary example, that Heraclitus's reason for saying that all was Fire was his belief (1) that there was no stability in the world and (2) that the only ever-changing substance was Fire, and (3) that nothing would change unless it were composed of a constantly changing substance. Fire in that case would not necessarily be only the fire which we know on the perceptual level, hot and burning. It would be both that and whatever changes. The latter, since it might not-and often would not-look like Fire, would have to be "scientific" Fire, much as the atoms and the nuclear components of atoms are sometimes called scientific objects. Its existence would be justi- fied on rational grounds even if there were no way of perceiving it. Its effects alone would be evidence of its being and on the principle that only Fire could cause change, those effects would be attributed to its presence. There would thus be said to be two kinds of Fire, the empirical and the rational. It would not take long for scientists to argue that empirical Fire must contain, or be really. though not perceptually, rational Fire, its perceptual properties being merely subjective. For the function which rational Fire would have would be that of simplifying the number of kinds of things in the world. It should be noted, however, that this function would be invoked only if it were first assumed that the generic varieties required simplification and if for some reason or other it was also assumed that the behavior of perceptual Fire must be the effect of some cause. Neither of these assumptions is obligatory. But the first may be thought of as the essential task of an intellectual interpretation of nature; the second then becomes one of the ways in which such simplification can be achieved. The principle of parsimony in Aristotle is undoubt- edly related to a curious idea which is expressed in the Metaphysics (1076 a 3) and which might be called the principle of Cosmic Good Government: ra e 6'vra ov obXoXercaL roXtreuecOaL KaKwS. What Aristotle means by good government here is monarchy and he proves the unity of cosmic rule by this axiom. In his works the ruler is the Unmoved Mover and concretely this being could be called the form of the world. Unfortunately 24 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="24">METHODOLOGICAL ASSUMPTIONS it is not like other forms since it is separate from its matter, as the active reason in the human psyche is separate from the body. Yet it seems to stand for nothing more than that general order which he believes the cosmos to exemplify. In fact it is this notion of a single order which permits him to call ria o6Ta a cosmos. That there could be order without a superhuman mind to do the ordering seemed as impossible to him as it seemed impossible to Descartes that there could be thinking without a thinker. Though Socrates was probably right when he said that the Nous of Anaxa- goras did nothing, Aristotle's Unmoved Mover, which was a descendant of the Nous, became the model for Christian and other mediaeval theologians and it was not long before it became identified with God. Yet the God of the Bible had many traits which were incompatible with those of the Unmoved Mover. First, God created the world. Aristotle's world was not created but was without beginning or end. Second, God was more anthropomorphic than the Unmoved Mover. He could have feelings, for in- stance, feelings of love for His creatures, to say nothing of the even more human feelings of anger, jealousy, and revenge. The Unmoved Mover had no feelings whatsoever. He was the object of love, not a lover. Third, the government of God was not uniform in that He could work miracles, interfere in the course of human and non-human events through catastrophes and, as far as Christianity was concerned, could and did incarnate Himself. The Unmoved Mover gov- erned in an absolutely uniform fashion. He was not responsible for accidents or monstrous occurrences, in which respect he might be thought of as less than omnipotent. He was especially non-Christian in that it was impossible for him to be incarnated, to be made human, though men in their active reason resembled him. Fourth, the Unmoved Mover was that which nature was striving to attain and only in that sense did he govern anything. God was more like a terrestrial monarch who governed through acts of will. But it is also true that in the passage referred to above, Aristotle does use the political metaphor and quotes in support of Cosmic Good Government the reply of Odysseus to Thersites in the Iliad, "The rule of many is not a good thing. Let there be one ruler." He does not finish the sentence as Homer did. In the Physics (260 b 22)26 Aristotle says that we should always assume that the better occurs in nature. Here the contrast is between the natural and the un- natural and the better is, as we shall see when we come to Aristotle's teleology, the regular or the orderly. To his way of thinking the worst that can happen is failure to attain one's goal. The regularity with which natural processes go on from beginning to end is to him proof of their purposiveness and hence 26 Cf. ibid., 259 b 10 and De somno, 469 a 29. of their goodness. What is nowadays called the gap between fact and value is bridged by his assumption of the goodness of the natural and the identification of the natural with the orderly sequences found as much in biological growth as in dynamics. If he had been a statistician, he would have equated the natural with the normal and indeed his language suggests that equation. Hence the principle of parsimony is rooted in the cosmic order and Aristotle's methodological and metaphysical principles are intertwined at this point, so that it is impossible to tell which were historically prior. 6. ANALYSIS Though the whole is always prior to the part (Politics, 1253 a 19 and elsewhere), Aristotle lays it down as a methodological principle that compounds should always be resolved into their elements or least parts (ibid., 1252 a 20, 1253 b 4). He can be thinking here only of wholes which are composites, not of simples. For simples, he maintains against his prede- cessors (Metaphysics, 988 b 32), can give rise to nothing, since all generation is either separation or combination. Simples are everlasting and, though he reduces through logical analysis the qualities of the elements to two and their opposites, those two never come into being nor will they ever be annihilated. Since the privation of an elementary and simple quality is its opposite, cold being the privation of hot as well as its opposite, privations are perceptible entities. The combinations of the four qualities give us, as we have seen, the four material elements and it would be theoretically possible to construct every- thing material in the universe out of them. Aristotle does not accomplish this program, as we all know, but he makes a good start towards its accomplishment by pointing out the correlations which exist between the various kinds even of living beings and the predomi- nance in their makeup of one of the elements. But he never shows us how the analysis proceeds. Analysis in modern chemistry is always the result of certain operations which are reactions either to other chemicals or to heat or electric currents or light or something similar. If we know what the chemical elements are, we can discover their presence in a com- pound by various tests. These tests are themselves the reactions of the supposed elements to various other substances or to temperature changes and so on. The supposed compounds are also submitted to similar tests and, if as a result the known elements appear, then it is concluded on the principle ex nihilo that those elements must have been present in the compounds before being separated out of them. The matter can be checked by reversing the process, that is, by re- combining the elements. In Aristotle no such tests are possible. One does not take a bone, for instance, and reduce it to Earth and then remake the bone out VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] 25</page><page sequence="25">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE of the resulting Earth. The one test for the presence of any element is direct perception. The hot, the cold, the moist and the dry can all be felt by the unaided sense-organs. So can the natural motions up and down. And since every eletnent is a combina- tion of two of the primary qualities, every element can be discovered in the same fashion. How Aristotle knew that hotness and moisture were the "positive" qualities and coldness and dryness their privations is not disclosed, but once they had been posited as ele- mentary simple qualities, then the privations were discovered by traditional grammatical usage. An opposite is always the contradictory of something, not one of its contraries. But how does anyone find out that something cannot be both hot and cold at the same time and in the same respect? Here we can resort only to conjecture. Etymologically an opposite is something which is placed in a position facing something else, which means along the same straight line and facing in the reverse direction. If up and down, or left and right, are opposites, their opposition must be defined geo- metrically. In a physics which is based upon absolute space with an absolute center, coordinates obviously can run through that center and these coordinates will determines opposition. If then the four elements are disposed by nature, not simply by thought, in concentric spheres about the center and if each is composed of two elementary qualities, then the oppo- sition of qualities is correlated with spatial position. The metaphor of opposition in such cases seems to lose its figurative meaning, a meaning which is pre- served in the description of two enemies being in opposition when their champions face each other in battle. But strictly speaking only specimens of the hot and the cold, the moist and the dry, would be in opposition, for along any sphere there could be other specimens which might not be in opposition with given specimens. So two individual planets might be in opposition at some date and not at others. But we are perhaps pressing the point too severely. Moreover, it is a fundamental assumption of Aristotle that there are two sorts of position, those determined by nature and those determined by force. Since qualitative opposition is based on natural po- sitions, it is possible to identify that whose natural position is on the periphery of the sublunary world with Fire and that whose natural position is at the center with Earth. The dislocation of the elements is always attributable to an interference with the natural arrangement of things. Hence, when we say that opposition loses its figurative meaning in Aris- totelian physics, we mean simply that the geometrical structure of his physical world permits him to inter- pret opposition in spatial terms. Mixed up with the theory of opposites is Aristotle's assumption that nature always does the best possible thing (De caelo, 288 a 2). He uses this assumption to explain the direction of the heavenly motion. Having stated the absoluteness of directions and the superi- ority of up to down, right to left, and front to back, he attributes to the heavens the better direction. That certain directions are inherently better than their opposites is a dogma which recalls the Pythagorean table of opposites as given in the Metaphysics (986 a 22). The left-hand side of that table lists the good qualities and the right-hand side the bad. It is pos- sible that the right hand side listed privations, so that the absence of limitation was the unlimited, the ab- sence of the odd the even, and so on. In general then it could be argued that evil was simply the privation of good, as Saint Augustine, some of the Stoics, and perhaps also Plotinus, maintained. To think of all the characteristics listed in the right-hand list as privations would strain our imaginations; why should the female be the absence of maleness, or the oblong the absence of squareness? It may be wiser to accept Ross's suggestion that the terms with the bad con- notations be listed as "indefinite" terms, for the in- definite is clearly the privation of limits.27 But this too has its weaknesses. If our conjecture is reasonable, then opposition is related to spatial position whether the opposing things are in space or not. Some ground then is given for the notion which played so great a role in mediaeval thought, that the center of the cosmos is the worst place whereas the periphery is the best. Be that as it may, analysis into elementary parts is still left unexplained except in so far as it is applied to material objects. We can tell what they are composed of by their motions and thus can analyze them. But when we come to other analyses, such as the analysis of the possible types of society, the process is always verbal. Thus, his list of the three types of government, monarchy, aristocracy, and polity, is based on the number of individuals who rule without any regard for actual conditions. Logically we know that there are only two arithmetical opposites, the one and the many, but by making a distinction between the many and the few, Aristotle can set up three kinds of rule. When he comes to the question of good and bad kinds, he has a straight opposition, for there are only two possibilities here: governing for the sake of the ruler or for the sake of the governed. If one knows the meaning of "for the sake of," no analytical problem arises. The trouble comes when one tries to apply the differentia to existing forms of government. Forms of government are not the result of the analysis of one idea. If generation is combination or separation, then it would seem that all things which come into being must be molecular in structure. And that may be why Aristotle insists that there must always be an agent present when generation occurs. 27 See his commentary on Metaphysics, loc. cit. 1: 150. Bekker's text does not list the opposites in columns, but it is standard practice to do so in translations. 26 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="26">METHODOLOGICAL ASSUMPTIONS The general rule behind the categories of activity and passivity is probably grammatical, derived from the active and passive voices of the verb, though, if Aristotle was merely following grammar, he might have added a third category corresponding to the middle. However that may be, action and passion are two opposites, according to De generatione et corruptione (Book I, chapter 7), but I have found no passage in which Aristotle says that one is a privation of the other.28 It would seem as if there were logi- cally a third possibility, that of neither acting nor being acted upon, the state of simply existing. If the cosmos is a whole and includes both the Unmoved Mover and the substratum, then the whole as a whole would neither act nor be acted upon. But since the Unmoved Mover is separate from that which he moves, there is no union between them. It is likely therefore that to Aristotle's mind the two opposites were all-inclusive: everything must be either an agent or a patient, though of course it might be both in relation to different things. But when he says, as he does in De anima (430 a 10), that in everything there is something which is matter and something which is form and that the latter is always active, he is opera- ting on the assumption that all change is combination or separation caused by an agent. Yet the parts of the soul are not, as the parts of a material object, externally joined to one another. For since each psychic function stands as either matter or form to some other part and since matter is never separated from form, except in the active reason, these parts could not have been joined together from a previous state of isolation. On the whole then it must be concluded that Aristotle is usually thinking of logical analysis and logical synthesis when he urges his readers to resolve compounds into their simplest parts. But since he also assumes that knowledge is a reflection of the structure of its objects, he must also have thought that analysis reflected the actual composition of things. This conclusion is fortified by his use of the likeness- postulate to the effect that there is always something common in agent and patient (De anima, 407 a 18).29 28 The whole contrast between activity and passivity is one which requires further study. Aristotle is not alone in using the terms as if their meaning were obvious. We may have some idea of what it means for us to be acted upon, as when we are struck by a weapon, or blown over by the wind, or influenced by a drug. But even in these cases there is reaction on our part if only the physical resistance of our bodies. If there were not, it is doubtful whether we would feel anything. The Ideologues in France at the end of the eighteenth century were specially interested in the problem of how far we were active in perception, much as the English Platonists were insistent on introducing an "active sagacity of the mind" to explain the rise of judgment. But neither group ever clarified just what they meant by "activity," in part perhaps because they were never clear about what the agent actually was. The use of personal pronouns in the nomi- native case apparently sufficed to justify their use of the term. 29 The likeness-postulate is discussed in part in De generatione et corruptione, Book I, chapter 7, along with action and passion. Thus the nous can know all things since all things are either sensory or noetic objects (ibid., 431 b 21).3? This involves a community of nature which establishes in its turn the likeness required. The likeness-postu- late is needed to help obviate the difficulty of com- pletely random occurrences. If anything whatsoever can happen, if anything can act on anything else, then there would be no order in the world and the cosmos would be unintelligible. There are unintelligible hap- penings going on, but they are not natural. We shall discuss them when we come to Aristotle's assumptions concerning nature. 7. ACTION AT A DISTANCE That there can be no action at a distance is asserted in De generatione et corruptione, 322 b 23. The agent here is thought of as a human agent which mechanically operates upon a given patient. Such an axiom oriented European thought in the direction of corporeal causes for every change and was there- fore ultimately responsible for such problems as that of the relation of mind and body in seventeenth- century metaphysics. That problem arose because of the difficulty of making intelligible the contact between a corporeal and an incorporeal substance. But Aristotle's whole conception of change demanded that there be both an agent and a patient which are two different beings.3' This is clearly put in the third and fourth chapters of Metaphysics, Alpha. Nothing, it there appears, could change "of its own accord," an axiom which continued to influence people through Renaissance science. A problem arose only when a change occurred, not when something persisted "in its own nature." We have an analogy to this in Galilean physics when a moving body exemplifying the first law of motion requires no explanation. Explanation is demanded when it ceases to follow that law and comes to rest or swerves from a straight course. More- over, the problem arises at precisely the point of coming to rest or swerving. Since it could not change its direction "of its own accord," an agent external to the body and its motion is sought for. In the case of locomotion each kind of object had its natural path, as is well known, determined by the kind of matter of which it was composed. The move- ment of material objects to their natural position was the fulfillment of their potencies and therefore was self-explanatory. But pushing and pulling, which, it The opening of the De sensu of Theophrastus divides Greek epistemologists into those who accept and those who reject the postulate. 30 Cf. the argument in Aristotle's De sensu, 445 a 18, on why food must be composite. 31 Here again if Aristotle had tried to base his metaphysics exclusively on Greek grammar, the middle voice and for that matter the reflexive pronouns in the accusative might have made him hesitate before insisting on the existential duality of agent and patient. Nor could he have been unaware of one of the two most famous Greek sentences, "Know thyself."

The difference lay in part in the spatial gap between the two. And yet they must come in contact if the action of the agent was to be effective. I have not found in Aristotle any awareness of the problem which was to be so influential in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries through the work of Cordemoy and Malebranche in France, and later of Hume in Great Britain. Contact to these men was impossible, for if two material objects were really in contact, their particles would merge and they would become one. If there were any empty space between them, how did the energy leap through it from one to the other?32 If the space between them were really empty of all matter, there would be no vehicle for the energy; if on the contrary, it were full, then there would be no con- tact. Out of this arose the occasionalism of Male- branche and Geulincx, a very special theory with theological implications, but the problem which gave rise to it might just as well have occurred to Aristotle. The difficulty is increased in his case since the natural motions of the elements, which in the final analysis are going to explain the local motions of all material objects, may well exist below the perceptual level, for the naked sense-organs always perceive the elemen- tary character of the composites with which they are confronted. To make matters worse, propulsion removes a body often from its natural position and thus does violence to the natural order. When a man throws a stone into the air, the return of the stone to earth is natural, but the upward throw is unnatural. Strictly speak- ing, it ought to be unintelligible, for all unnatural oc- currences are irrelevant to science. But Aristotle maintains that the distance it attains is a function of the force which is imparted to it. What is this force? Note that only the hand comes in contact with the stone and that the only measure of the force is the distance upwards which the stone reaches before re- turning to its natural position. "Time is the measure of motion" (Physics, 219 b 1). Though the word KLV7T0LS which Aristotle uses here would seem to suggest local motion, the motion of which time is the measure is any kind of change. In fact he says himself that when discussing the nature of time one need not dis- tinguish between kinetic displacement and change (Physics, 218 b 19: KlvaLV,w 7tEraaoXo). The measure of local motion must be the time it takes for the stone to leave the hand and to reach some designated point either in its ascent or its descent. But this time can- 32 I have obviously paraphrased the argument of these men, omitting the detail found in Cordemoy and Malebranche and in fact in all the modern Neo-Platonists who added to the problem the axiom that matter was inert and had no power of action whatsoever. not also be the measure of the force imparted to the stone for obvious reasons. If the force is not itself a material object, it cannot come into contact with the stone. Moreover, in some cases, such as the locomotion of animate beings, it is the psyche which moves the body through space and not a material object in contact with it. Purpose, for instance, is one of the dominant forces in the locomo- tion of animate beings and purpose is attraction rather than propulsion. In the physical writings Aristotle concludes that the cosmic motions are all attributable to the attraction which all things find in the Unmoved Mover, Dante's love which moves the sun and the other stars. There is no reason why Aristotle should not believe in two kinds of kinetic power, if he wishes, that of attraction and that of propulsion. But if both can result in local motion, either they can both be re- solved into one or there must be two sets of kinetic laws. What is interesting is that when he lists the kinds of motion, attraction is not included. This is because Aristotle adopted the second of these solu- tions, if we are willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, one set of laws for superlunary motion and one for sublunary. But though each planet is moved by the intelligence which guides it, as a group the planets are attracted to the Unmoved Mover. The situation is also complicated by the fact that this side of the moon there are also two kinds of local motion, that which is inherent in the elements and that which is imposed upon them and their compounds by propulsion and traction. We conclude that the assumption of no action at a distance applies exclusively to unnatural motions.33 Like the likeness-postulate, this assumption is needed to prevent more randomness than it is absolutely necessary to grant. It was all very well to say that the world of observation contained chance, random, and unnatural events. But Aristotle understandably enough seems to have wanted to keep their number down to a minimum. If contact was needed for un- natural locomotion, that would at least establish some sort of limiting condition of what might occur. The difficulty of defining contact would be compensated by the advantages of asserting its necessity. Human beings have an immediate awareness of touch and they know that until they have that sensation, they cannot push or pull things. To elaborate this simple experience into a physical principle was to anthro- pomorphize non-human events. But that was no more of an obstacle to Aristotle than it was to the Mediaeval Christian philosophers. In fact one has only to look at the theory of how the animal spirits moved the muscles and thus transported the skeleton to see how the idea of locomotion through contact dominated the imagination of western scientists. It was a serious question whether the substitution of 33 More will be said about the effect of the Unmoved Mover on the planetary intelligences below. See p. 87a. 28 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="28">METHODOLOGICAL ASSUMPTIONS attraction for propulsion was an improvement on Aristotle. The advantage lay, one suspects, in pro- viding a measure of attraction which could be ex- pressed in mathematical language and thus serve as a basis of measurement as well as of the coordination of all motions. There could be nothing similar to the Law of Gravitation in Aristotle since he was unaware of the possibility of one universal set of kinetic laws. He had made such assumptions about the structure of nature that laws of such generality would have been impossible. This does not deny his extraordinary ability as a scientist, for his organization of fact was greater, as far as the literary evidence shows, than that of any of his predecessors. No one to date has made all empirical observations fit into a single cosmic order. Indeed the very feasibility of such a program is dubious, for what experience gives us is precisely the disordered or, if one prefer, the unordered, which it is the scientist's business to organize. If a deduc- tion about what ought to be observed under specified conditions is contradicted by an observation, then experience will have judicial supremacy over deduc- tion. But one can never make a deductive system so detailed that it will permit one to infer the exist- ence-not the possibility-of such failures. If p strictly implies q and we fail to corroborate q in observation, that is irrelevant to logic. We can, if we wish, say that what we have found was not a true case of q, that we failed to perform the correct experi- ment, that by improving our technique we shall one day succeed in finding it. A description of nature so complete that all peculiarities, all variations, all mon- sters and sports would be included in it would be a portrait of the world but scarcely science Moreover, nothing is a variety of a species, a sport, a deviation an exception unless a general rule has already been established from which the incident in question can vary or deviate. What we observe may be simply that which our education leads us to expect. Such expectations are embedded in our daily vocabulary which provides us with those preliminary classifica- tions made by the sciences of the past. But such classi- fications are prognostic of our intellectual manners. If like our forefathers we include spiders, crocodiles, and crustaceans in the class of insects, we shall expect them to behave like all other insects When we dis- cover that they do not so behave, we shall conclude either that insects cannot be handled scientifically or that the term must be restricted to a smaller group of animals. 8. CONCLUSION Aristotle's methodological assumptions were bound to end in a distinction between the rational and the surd, just as any others would. The rational became whatever his method could handle; the surd all the rest. We shall be forced, for instance, to posit some kind of serial order in our data, though it may not be one of Aristotle's. The materialism of tradition, for example, demanded that all investigators first look for those material events from whose occurrence ob- servable changes could be deduced. If, to oversim- plify, one knew the atoms in a molecule, one would be able to infer the characteristics of the molecule; if one knew the characteristics of the molecule, one ought to be able to infer the behavior of molar objects; if one knew the behavior of molar objects, one could infer the behavior of groups of them and so on. This program was essentially that of Auguste Comte, though he was hardly a materialist. In the opinion of some scientists, psychology demanded reinterpre- tation in terms of biology, biology in terms of bio- chemistry, biochemistry in terms of physics, and phys- ics in terms of mathematics. At most the logically prior sciences could provide the conditions under which the facts of the posterior would appear; they could not deny their existence. No one needed to know the color or the odor of a billiard ball in order to formulate the Law of the Parallelogram of Forces, but that did not in itself deny that each billiard ball had some color and odor. And even if colors and odors turned out to be dependent on moving particles whose motions were describable in physical terms, they still could not have been explained if they had not existed. Just as we shall always assume some serial order in our facts, so we shall utilize empirical observation much as Aristotle did, that is, to create problems and to stimulate our curiosity, to suggest generalizations, and to disprove them. As for the principle ex nihilo nihil, we shall probably reinterpret it exclusively as the principle that there must be some general conditions antecedent to the event under scrutiny which will determine its occurrence and in the absence of which it will not occur. This interpretation will, however, one imagines, be weakened by the influence of sta- tistics. Statistical groupings have already fortified our belief that classes are made by men, not by God. God seems to have created individuals, not species. But even statistical generalizations are generaliza- tions. As for the principle of parsimony, this is in- herent in any intellectual operation, even on the rudi- mentary level of common nouns. For when we call two or more things by one name, we have selected out of their many characteristics a few which we say they have in common and have decided to confine our at- tention to those few alone. We are perhaps a bit more sophisticated in our use of this principle than Aristotle was, since we do not personify Nature as if the term referred to some superhuman being who acts in a human fashion. We shall probably see that the phrase praeter necessitatem refers to our needs and not to those of this goddess. The principle of analysis will also be retained, though we are more willing than Aristotle to attribute to compounds characters which did not pre-exist in their elements. Analysis has worked most successfully in chemistry where (1) de- VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] 29</page><page sequence="29">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE composition could be followed by recomposition and (2) where something, weight, was discoverable in both elements and compounds to be identical, making equa- tions possible. It is only the denial of action at a distance which has required modification to such an extent that it can be said to have been rejected. It is still utilized in whatever is retained of classical and pre-classical physics; no one thinks that a billiard ball can be propelled without its having been touched by a cue. But no one any longer thinks of the behavior of billiard balls as paradigmatic of all change. Where, however, the concept of agent and patient are re- tained, the principle itself is likely to be retained. And that concept remains useful at least as a meta- phor wherever human beings intervene in the course of natural happenings to change them. We should be perhaps a bit more careful in analyzing the causal situation; we should probably be aware that, if one thing acts upon another, there is a simultaneous re- action of the other upon the one, that is, running from patient to agent. That a cause can produce an effect without being modified by that upon which it acts to produce the effect would probably be denied by all. Therefore, if we extend our philosophic meditations into theology, we shall see that God as a cause must suffer as well as act, an idea which would be repugnant to most theologians. But we could still separate out of the great tangle of occurrences certain strands of interest to us and describe them in isolation and as if they had but one direction. It is, as we have said above, impossible to discover now whether Aristotle's methodological assumptions were prior to his metaphysical assumptions or whether the metaphysical were prior to the methodological. Assumptions often, indeed usually, are made because they are obvious, the uniquely true or self-evident ideas which no one would dream of doubting. No method is so satisfactory and so universally applicable that nothing escapes its net. We begin to doubt with common sense, that is, with what we have picked up from rough and ready experience, and there seems to be no incongruity between our method and our sub- ject matter for the very reason that there is a constant interplay between the two. Subject matters will take on a character which is inevitably determined by the method used to study them and the method will be constantly revised as it fails to handle certain prob- lems. But we shall also make certain assumptions about our subject matter which are logically distin- guishable from our methodological assumptions. We shall now turn to one set of these in Aristotle. II. THE TWO WORLDS 1. APPEARANCE AND REALITY The problem of appearance and reality arises on the empirical level when one realizes that something is not what it seems to be. But to judge that something is really not what it seems to be presupposes that some- one has judged it to be something or other, in short a member of a class whose generic characteristics are known either to him or to some other person who has communicated them to him. One does not have to be very precise in one's pre-judgment; indeed, if one were, no confusion would be likely to occur unless the similarities between the object under inspection and the class of objects to which it is supposed to belong were unusually great. If a child confuses smoke and steam, we may take it for granted that he has first made the acquaintance of, let us say, smoke and later has come across steam and has failed to notice any- thing but their resemblance. The order in which he becomes acquainted with them is unimportant. If there were no resemblance whatsoever between the two, it is hardly likely that one would appear to be the other. The same may be said of the confusion between two human beings, or for that matter between any two things. If one sees a man and thinks it is John Smith, that is probably because he looks like John Smith, talks like John Smith, or in some other way resembles John Smith. And if I pick up a hat which I think is mine but which belongs to someone else, that is because it looks like mine or is where I think I left mine. Such would seem to be the source of the distinction between appearance and reality on the empirical level. I am myself making an obvious assumption here, that philosophical distinctions have their origin in empirical distinctions. All distinctions arise in lan- guage, for there is no other way in which they can make themselves known, and language, I assume, can be used uncritically by anyone whether he is a phi- lospher or not. A large part of philosophy consists of linguistic criticism, of trying to make words univalent which have become ambiguous. To point out that a word is used in two senses would seem to necessitate a prior knowledge of the meaning of at least the sen- tence in which the words are customarily found. The larger dictionaries do most of the preliminary work for us, for they list the various meanings of ambiguous terms, much as Aristotle tried to list them in certain chapters of his works. Among these Metaphysics, Delta, is perhaps the best known. But, however reasonable my assumption may be, it is not the only guide to philosophical discussion which has appeared in history. Quite the contrary. There have been philosophers who have assumed that there exists a special philosophical faculty called variously intuition, the heart, insight, Vernunft as contrasted with Verstand, the inner light, common sense, and animal faith, which leads the man who possesses it to the more profound philosophical truths. My own position, for what it is worth, is that as far as distinctions are con- cerned, the philosopher finds them first in ordinary speech, corresponding to uncriticized opinion, and then proceeds to see whether or not they are justified. 30 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="30">THE TWO WORLDS And I also take it for granted that such verbal differ- entiations have their origin in differences perceived by someone, either the person announcing them or another person whose opinion he accepts. But the characteristics which differentiate things or which amalgamate them into a single class need not be sensory qualities, colors, sounds, odors, and so on. They may be ways of behaving which, to be sure, have to be sooner or later witnessed by sensory observation or to be of such a nature that they can be described in terms which are analogous to those used in describing the perceptual. Thus ice, water, and steam may be said to be "really" the same thing, though they appear to be different. There is a sensory difference of which everyone is aware among the three states of water, differences in looks, texture, density, temperature, to take only the most obvious. When one says that they are really the same but only seem different, just what does one mean by the adverb "really"? One can only mean that, if they are all submitted to certain chemi- cal tests, it will be found that all three are composed of molecules containing two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen. A principle of unification has been introduced which is not applicable in the realm of raw perception. If three perceptually different things react to the same tests in the same way, then it will be concluded that they are "really" one though ap- parently different. In this case the material composi- tion of the three is proof of their identity and their raw perceptual qualities are irrelevant to their material composition. But such identity is merely a shorthand expression for the fact that they do react in the same way to the given tests. It is not evidence of some "deeper" reality, for it too has to be submitted to per- ceptual observation, not to the inspection of the heart or the Vernunft, or any of the other instruments of metaphysical depth. One has, to be sure, simplified appearances enormously by combining a group of them under one chemical symbol, but that has not elimi- nated such differences as make ice, water, and steam vastly different for practical purposes. No chemical identity will justify a locomotive engineer's putting blocks of ice in his boiler and expecting them to drive his pistons. Another common example of this is found when adults tell children that diamonds, char- coal, and graphite are really the same thing; they surely do not mean that they all look alike, but clearly that chemically they are all carbon and nothing but carbon. And this is determined in the same way as the identity of ice, water, and steam is determined. Thus identity of material substance is one of the pri- mary meanings of what a thing really is in distinction to what it appears to be. This is so familiar that it has been incorporated into popular slogans, such as that a man is nothing but sixty cents worth of chemi- cals, hydrogen, oxygen, potassium, phosphorous, sulphur, and so on. It is only the words "nothing but" to which one can take objection, if the financial value of the chemicals is correctly estimated. If I put this first on the list, it is not because material identity has logical priority over other types, but because it has a certain historical priority, if Aristotle's account of the Milesian philosophers is sound.1 The search for and discovery of a primordial substance out of which everything else is composed could have justi- fied such assertions as that Thales said that all was water, Anaximenes that all was air, Anaximander that all was The Indefinite. It makes little difference for our present purposes whether this is or is not histori- cally right; what is of importance is that Aristotle made them. We know next to nothing of these phi- losophers and that little comes from Aristotle supple- mented by Theophrastus and the later doxographers, who knew even less about them than he did. But we cannot suppose that they believed everything to look like their archai. Things appeared to be diverse sub- stantially, but really were not. In our own times one sometimes hears scientists say that things really are combinations of the various 92 elements, whatever they may appear to be, just as Democritus is reported by Galen to have said that by custom things were colored and sweet and bitter but that in truth-or really-they are nothing but atoms moving in the void. Whatever Democritus may have meant by "custom" and "truth," he certainly did not mean that things looked like atoms moving in the void. One might also remember that unless something claims to be something which it appears to be or unless someone makes the claim for it, it is not reasonable to charge it with appearing to be something which it is not. If one is satisfied with perceptual evidence-and no one, to be sure, always is and for all purposes-then nothing could appear to be what it is not, for everything would be what it appears to be. The claim in question is of course always made by philosophers and I am in- cluding in that class of people men who are amateur or common-sense philosophers or what used to be called the man-in-the-street. For everyone some- times makes mistakes and most people find it out. If a person turns up who claims to be the lost Dauphin, Louis XVII, he makes his own claim. And similarly when a dream or an optical illusion deludes us into thinking that they are something which they really are not, we can figuratively say that they have led us astray or, if one wish, that they too have made their own claims. But we often correct our errors by applying tests which we have learned from experience, tests such as touching something which looks like a physical object but which is an illusion, or asking the lost Dauphin to translate a line of French or to recall something which we have reason to believe he would know if he were the real Dauphin. So the old woman 1 That it is not sound will be evident to anyone who reads Cherniss, Presocratics, especially pp. 359 ff. But what I say, if taken with a grain of salt, will do as a logical example. 31 VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959]</page><page sequence="31">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE in the nursery rhyme said, "If I be I as I think I be, then my little black dog will remember me," a test which is as old as the Odyssey, mutatis mutandis. Here there is a hint of what some metaphysicians have used as a general test for all reality, namely, the per- manence of certain characteristics. One may assume that the little old woman took it for granted that, however much she might have changed, she had one trait which was persistent, her ability to arouse a statable reaction in her dog. Similarly, when we touch something to see whether it is real and not an illusion, we assume, I suppose, that material objects in space have tactual properties which do not change, however much their other properties may come and go from moment to moment. It may well be that this crude notion of a permanent core in all things is behind the dictum ex nihilo nihil when that dictum is interpreted substantialistically. The question which one would like to answer at this point is what justification anyone has ever found for the assumption of a "permanent core" in things. No answer can be given to this question since no one has ever left any record of why he ever made the assump- tion. In ordinary experience we have two bits of evidence for permanence, both of which fail to with- stand criticism: tactile feelings which change very slowly and the intuition of personal identity. If one translate the former into a more sophisticated form and call it the principle of the conservation of mass, one is simply taking a methodological rule and calling it an ontological axiom. Regardless of contemporary reinterpretations of the relation between mass and energy, all one has in the ordinary chemical equations is evidence that the weight of whatever is symbolized on one side of the equation is equal to the weight of whatever is symbolized on the other, plus the informa- tion that a certain operation can be performed. But weight is not a material hard core. The fact that two pounds of sugar in two different bags weigh exactly the same amount does not establish material identity between the two nor would anyone in his right mind argue to the contrary.2 Our intuition of personal identity is perhaps better evidence of a permanent core, for at least no one can deny that another person possesses it. But to project our feelings into the, cosmos as a whole is a risky business, however usual, and the distinction between the Ego and the experi- ences of the Ego, the former being permanent and the latter fleeting, is a distinction which itself cannot be accepted without question. Yet even if it is justified, all it proves is that we have created the world in our own image. If the assumption of a permanent core which is reality is accepted, then the word "really" means obedience to some rule of identification. But it surely 2 I trust that no one will interpret this as saying that weight and mass are identical. must be obvious that, if we are thinking in terms of things, rather than structures or processes, then we shall be forced to look for something which the name of the thing can name. And as all names of things which are not proper names are names for what a group has in common, the individual thing may exist but for a moment and yet really be the thing in ques- tion. A rainbow or a sunset or a snowflake is no less really a rainbow, sunset or snowflake for its transiency. The adverb "really" applies to a class as a whole and not to the individual member of the class which happens to be under consideration. To say that something is really an alpha is to say that the traits of the class alpha, which are permanent, are exemplified in it. But that is not equivalent to saying that no other traits, those of the classes beta, gamma, or delta, are present. Such traits may also be present but if so another question will inevitably be raised: what is the relation of such traits to those of alpha; are they, in traditional language, phenomenal or real? If the former, the question will in all probability have been decided on the basis of their permanence. But that would entail the belief that the real nature of nothing can be momentary. So that one ends up by saying that it is the class, not its members, which is real. For the class alone is permanent. Certain generic char- acteristics are specified as marks of identification and to ask whether an object is really this or that is to ask whether it has the identifying marks of the class to which it claims to belong or to which someone judges it to belong. It cannot fail to have been observed that this conclusion is very close to Platonism in so far as that doctrine locates reality in the world of ideas. Individuals present different problems. To ask whether George Washington really existed, as for a short time in the nineteenth century people wondered whether Jesus or Homer really existed, is not to ask whether men really existed between 1732 and 1799, whether there was a first president of the United States, whether Virginia landowners ever existed, or questions of that type. These are three classes to which George Washington belonged. Given the existence of George Washington, one can locate him in a great variety of classes and though in actuality only one person belonged to them all-in fact, only one person belonged to one of them, the first president of the United States-one cannot deduce from a pos- sible coincidence of many classes that any existent individual exemplified that coincidence. Like all ex- istents, existent individuals have to be discovered, not deduced. And they are usually discovered by other people and their agreement on his self-identity. In historical instances such discoveries are made at second hand, but, however they are made, they are not based on the generic traits of the various classes of beings to which the individual in question is believed to have belonged. Naturally, if it were to be proved that none of these classes of beings had ever had any 32 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="32">THE TWO WORLDS members, were by their very nature null-classes, the individual too would have to be declared non-existent. Such a case is nonsensical, since no one could imagine a being every one of whose properties was impossible of actualization, though the group might be. We can argue that mermaids as a class could not exist, but we do so on the basis of the incompossibility of their various properties. This, it should be observed, is not logical incompossibility, however, for there is no logical contradiction between women's torsos and fishes' tails. The combination may be a physiological im- possibility, though that might also have been said of the oviparous mammals. Along with permanence go certain other properties, such as unity and even spacelessness. In time it turns out that since individuals have to be observed and are therefore in space and time, mutable and diverse, being born and dying, they cannot be real. There is immediately a wedge driven between what one experiences in the world of space and time and what is really real. One is forced up the logical hier- archy and to seeking membership in more and more general classes and one finally begins to overlook the specification that appearances always claim to be members of some class, the class of existent rather than non-existent beings, the class of material rather than immaterial beings, the class of objects in the waking world rather than in the dream world, and one begins to talk about the real without qualification. Similarly one talks about appearance as if a being could simply appear without appearing to be anything. This is done by abstracting the conditions under which things are said to be something from the conditions of their being that something which they appear to be.3 But if I ask, "What does it mean for something to be visible?" all I can reply is that it means for it to be able to be seen. But that is a tautology. And if I ask, "What does it mean for something to be real without further specification?" I can only reply that it means that it meets the conditions of belonging to some undesignated class. If we call individuals classes of one member, then everything is as real as everything else and the adjective "real" adds nothing to our knowledge. It furnishes no information whatsoever. It becomes a universal predicate which because of its very universality is non-selective. And since every- thing belongs to some class or other, whether the class has one or more members, everything again is really something or other. But if the tests of reality are the tests of belonging to some class whose traits can be specified, then one can abstract such tests and examine them to see whether they all have some characteristics in common. 3 I am happy to find in a recent book of J. H. Randall, Jr., Nature and historical experience, 126, New York, Columbia University Press, 1958, another critique of the notion of bare reality, made, however, from a different but not contradictory point of view. It will be observed, it goes without saying, that the members of any class may become extinct, but that does not militate against its reality as a class We know what is meant by the dodo or the cave bear, just as we know what is meant by chiliagons, that darling of seventeenth and eighteenth-century epistemolo- gists. We therefore can know what is meant by a real dodo and a real chiliagon. If the tests are such that they do have common traits, no matter what, then those traits can be abstracted and erected into a uni- versal. But it will be the class of those beings which share the traits which will be real and not the members of that class. We are thus back in the situation where caninity or humanity will be real but not dogs or men. This is the position, it will be recalled, of the mediaeval realists. If it runs counter to common sense, that is because common sense is not asking the same question as philosophy asks. Common sense does not want to know whether something is real or not without speci- fication. It wants to know whether a given object is a real or a counterfeit five dollar bill, a real or an illusory ghost, a real landscape or a painted backdrop. The tests for common sense are tests which include membership in some specificable class, not in the general class to which all tests of reality without speci- fication can be put. If the distinction be made be- tween the real and the imaginary, the real and the fictitious, the real and the illusory, the real and the oneiric, in each case tests can be stated in terms of which the two large classes can be defined. And since the two together presumably exhaust the possibilities, a sort of dualism results which is not necessarily a dualism of substance. It becomes a dualism of be- havior or structure or function, depending on how we determine difference. If we accept the theory of molecular structure literally, then, as Meyerson showed, the difference between two compounds of the same atomic substance, such as molecular oxygen and ozone, or water and hydrogen peroxide, is the spatial arrangement of the atoms, for substantially there is nothing in ozone which is not in oxygen and nothing in hydrogen peroxide which is not in water. This does not permit us to say without qualification that the two members of each pair are alike; they are substantially alike. But if we use the tests of common sense, oxygen and ozone, water and hydrogen peroxide, behave differently, that is, they do not give us the same perceptual qualities when we observe them; they do not react to other substances in the same way; they cannot be used for the same purposes technically. If laws are a description of the ways things behave under specifiable conditions, then the laws relevant to these substances will also be different. To say that oxygen and ozone are really the same though apparently dif- ferent is to mislead through oversimplification, an over-simplification which is achieved-perhaps only for rhetorical purposes-by omitting the very qualifi- cations which would expose it.

The reason is a rejection of common sense, of crude experience, of raw fact. What laws give us is a highly generalized account of things which by its very nature omits and has to omit those features of experience which indi- vidualize. This again is a tautology, but it is one which has apparently been taken too seriously. When, for instance, we say that two men have their humanity in common, we cannot then infer that they have a common substance which exists beneath, above, or beyond their differences. George Washington and Abraham Lincoln were both men, to be sure, but that does not imply that they were not also and just as really two different men with as many differences as similarities. Nor does it imply that we should first confine our attention to what they have in common as if that were of some greater importance than their differences. The occasions and purposes which guide our investigations are going to determine whether we look for general traits or individual differences. If we charge the word "really" with greater importance than "apparently" has, we do so because of the importance which general descriptions can give us, not because such information frees us from illusions or dreams or hallucinations or errors in general. The man who would argue that because water and hydrogen peroxide are really the same-meaning "in substance"-and then proceeded to drink them both indifferently when thirsty would soon find out that his metaphysics had led him into a foolhardy adventure, an adventure quite as foolhardy as that of a man who would accept his dreams as reality and his waking life as illusion. The split then between the realm of observation and that of reason is unavoidable as long as we have to think in general terms. We shall now see what assumptions were made by Aristotle about the rela- tions between the two realms. 2. OBSERVATION AND REASON The split of which we are speaking arises because of the exigencies of thinking and of our methods of sym- bolizing thought in language. But in Aristotle it was also an ontological split. On the one hand he found a mass of particular things and events with which one came into contact through observation. On the other was a set of general laws descriptive within certain limits of the former. The former group or collection was given significance by the latter, in the sense that without the latter no one would be aware of the order which somehow or other was embedded in it. Such a qualification as "within certain limits" indicates the point at which the relation between the two realms became a problem. The universal principles or laws were believed to be true of the mass of observations, and yet any single observation might, and usually did, vary from what the principles prescribed. I am not saying that Aristotle was the first philosopher to feel the sting of this problem. It probably lies at the very heart of Heraclitus and was, as everyone knows, one of the major problems of Plato. Moreover, there seemed to be another profound difference between the two realms. The interrelations amongst the inhabi- tants of the world of observation were causal, pro- ductive, dynamic; those of the world of laws were on the contrary logical, implicative, and immutable. Two material objects could collide; two declarative sentences could contradict each other but could scarcely do more The logical relations between two ideas might be thought of as either faint copies of the dynamic relations between those things of which they were the ideas, as the photograph of a married couple might suggest the conjugal felicity of the man and woman represented. Or on the other hand they might be thought of as patterns which those dynamic relations exemplified. But the more one examined the two worlds, the more one was convinced that the gap be- tween them was ultimate and that the supposed simi- larity between what it has become customary to call the universal and the particular was only about as close as that between what ought to be and what is. One of the major obstacles to settling this problem was the peculiar conception of knowledge which runs through the Aristotelian corpus. Knowledge to Aristotle, like perceptual observation, was an image of its objects. But it was an image which also said something and its message was never ambiguous. Consequently the contents of the message must be found in objective form in its subject-matter, and the correspondence between the cognitive symbol and that which it symbolized was like that of a picture and that of which it is a picture. But then too the message, if it was to make sense, had to be translated into sen- tences and in the nature of the case the sentence could not shift its meaning while it was under consideration. On the contrary, it must remain fixed. But percep- tual experience was fugitive and, as Heraclitus amongst others had pointed out, one no sooner looks at something than it begins to glide away. Hence one might say that every sentence expressing percep- tual experience was true only at the moment when it was pronounced, whereas what we need is ideas which will be lastingly true. Such are supposed to be the laws of the scientists, true without reference to dates and places. They are of the form, "All S is P," not, "This S which is before me is P."4 4 This, if I am not mistaken, is the traditional view of the problem. It should be noted, however, that a true description of a particular event including date and place and, if one will, the observer himself, does not cease to be true when the object changes. At the instant it is made it may be true of that object and as a sentence will remain true regardless of what happens to the object. All one has to do is to be careful to include in the sentence temporal and local qualifications. If this were not so, no historical judgment would be true after the event. But what 34 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="34">THE TWO WORLDS Fortunately Aristotle, like all other philosophers, had specimens of that kind of knowledge in mathematics. As he says himself (Metaphysics, Kappa, 1061 a 28) the mathematician studies abstractions, eliminating all sensible qualities. The objects of mathematics, the triangles, the proportions, the relations between quantities, never seemed to change and one could be confident that once a theorem in geometry had been proved, it would stay proved. To men hungry for something stable, something which would not suffer the buffets of time, mathematics was a model for all knowledge to copy. This involved two other ideas: (1) the idea that, when one possessed this kind of knowledge, one had only to look and see for oneself what was entailed in it; (2) the idea that the world of observation, the phenomena, the material objects, the living beings, all of which, in so far as they could be known, seemed to obey the strictures of mathe- matical knowledge, were imperfect exemplars of the cognitive models. The justification of the second of these two ideas, aside from the acceptance of tradition, was the observation that the world of perception did indeed submit itself within a certain margin of error to mathematical manipulation. In other words, the wheels of the wheelwright were almost but not quite circular, and moreover, when the wheelwright wanted to make a good wheel, he could do so best by trying to follow the dictates of the geometry of circles. The former idea was harder to justify, for the Greeks surely must have known plenty of men who could con- template a theorem and see no truth in it and no im- plications. But apparently the fact that perception seemed to be no more than looking and seeing gave rise to the metaphor that all knowledge was equally contemplation. The irony of the situation lay in basing a metaphor for knowledge on an experience which sooner or later everyone had to admit was not knowledge and indeed something whose traits were antithetical to those of knowledge. If knowledge was contemplation and its expression a picture of what one saw, then two realms of being had to be provided for it. One of these would be the objects of true knowledge, eternal, immutable, with only logical interrelations; the other would be the objects of perception, temporal, mutable, with dy- namic interrelations. And since there was supposed to be a one-to-one correspondence between the mem- bers of both worlds, one had to find some explanation of their differences. In discussing the assumptions which Aristotle made about these two worlds, I shall call one the Order of Nature and the other the World of Observation. Nature was first assumed to be an order attained by the reason and imperfectly found in observation. The Aristotle wanted, what all scientists and philosophers want, is sentences which will be true regardless of times and places and consequently they have to find objects which are non-temporal and non-spatial. imperfection was attributed to the presence of matter which could suffer change and which consequently was in time. Time in all the classic philosophers, in what might be called the dominant tradition of occidental thought, was a blemish on the cosmic picture. The occidental philosophers were looking for a world which would be eternally self-identical. Matter too was an unhappy necessity, something to be given as insigni- ficant a role as possible in one's metaphysics. In Aristotle primary matter, the substratum, was a gram- matical necessity as well as an ontological necessity: something to serve as a universal subject for the totality of predicates as well as something out of which all observable things could be made, something to serve as a universal patient, something to be poten- tially everything and actually nothing. That things sometimes go wrong this side of reason needed no proof. It was the most usual of experi- ences. To go wrong was to fail to exemplify the laws of science. When one discovers as a child that-to take one of the most ordinary examples-there are no perfect circles, one discovers the basis of a metaphysics of one's own. For one has only to ask why to raise this most troubling of metaphysical questions. One can lay the blame either on the circles which one en- counters or on geometry. Or of course one can ask oneself why anyone should have expected that there would be perfect circles. If one imagines that true knowledge must be true of something, then one has to conclude that geometry cannot be true of the world in which circles drawn on paper or cut out of wood exist. One can then ask about the origin of geometrical knowledge if one has the audacity to do so. But if it has already been ingrained in one to consider mathe- matics as beyond criticism, then one will ask for that item of corruption which makes our world so imper- fect. That item of corruption in Aristotle was called Chance. Just what he meant by chance is far from clear. But it should be noted that he never seeks to prove its existence; he assumes it. Whatever else chance may be, it is something con- trasted with nature. Nature has no element of chance in it. The collection of natural happenings is not only different from that of fortuitous happenings, but is described in a set of propositions which are contra- dictions of that set which might describe chance happenings. This is illustrated by such assertions as the following which occur frequently in one form or another throughout the corpus, so frequently that it would be absurd to list them all here. Nature leaves nothing to chance (De caelo, 290 a 31). In this pas- sage the axiom is used to prove that stars would have organs of motion if they moved. Nature is no wanton or random creator (ibid., 291 b 14). Therefore, if the stars moved, they would have a shape adapted to motion. No natural fact can originate in chance (ibid., 301 a 11). In these three sentences "by chance" means clearly "without a purpose," "in vain." They VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] 35</page><page sequence="35">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE consequently mean about the same thing as the famous Aristotelian phrase, "Nature does nothing in vain." They do not, however, imply that chance events are illusory or "mere" appearance or are so called because of our ignorance or because they do not occur. On the contrary, Aristotle is emphatic in maintaining that they do occur and need not be inter- preted as concealing a rational character beneath their superficial appearance. But they are not natural. If then both chance events and natural events occur, and if no chance events occur in nature, then there must be two utterly different kinds of events in the uni- verse, those which occur by chance and those which occur in accordance with nature. In the Physics (188 a 31) he says that the only random events are accidental. This is what rhetoricians used to call "granted matter." The sentence contains material for a definition of chance events. Since every event for Aristotle is the realization of a form or final cause, we may define a natural event as one in which the form or final cause is identical with the essence; in such events there is a coincidence of formal and final causes. An unnatural event then becomes one in which the final cause is an accident. Among acci- dental events chance will be found; no purpose will be realized which could properly be called a natural purpose. On the whole such events take place through the intervention of human wills in the natural course of things, though there are other sources as well. When Aristotle is talking of nature in the simplest manner, he is thinking of the cosmos minus mankind; without man very general laws can be phrased and purely theoretical science can be organ- ized. But when human beings come upon the scene, the sciences which include their affairs, such as ethics, politics, and poetics, lack exactitude and are only more or less true. We find something like this today when scholars utilize statistics in dealing with the social sciences and rigorous mathematical formulas when dealing with the natural sciences.5 Aristotle's most detailed account of chance is to be found in the Physics (196 b). He there makes a dis- tinction between those events which happen always or for the most part and those which occur only some- times. The first differentia then of chance events is the irregularity or infrequency of their occurrence. The second is found in the distinction between the essential and the accidental cause of an event, the latter being chance. To use his own example, the natural cause of building a house is architectural knowledge-he actually says the art of architecture (ibid., line 20)-but the architect may also be white and a musician, but his complexion and avocations are only chance causes. (He does not ask whether houses built by white and musical architects would be any 6 "Today" perhaps should be replaced by "yesterday." Since the development of quantum mechanics, the situation has changed. different from those built by dark non-musical archi- tects.) When then the cause of a purposive event is accidental, we call the event fortuitous. Again, to take another of his examples, a man may run into one of his debtors in the market place and by chance collect his debt. His purpose in going to the market place was not to collect the debt but to conduct other business. But since he was there and met his debtor, he was able to collect the money owing him. "It is clear then," he says (ibid., 197 a 5), "that chance is an accidental cause in such things as are purposive or according to choice." This means, he continues, that chance as a cause is indeterminate and obscure and that there is a certain justification in people's saying that it is not a cause. So too it is reasonable to say that chance is irrational, "for reason is concerned either with the things that always happen or happen for the most part whereas chance is found in those things which happen in a contrary manner" (ibid., 197 a 19). This would be clear enough if it were the sole account which Aristotle offered of the subject. We know the difference between events which happen always and those which happen rarely, though there might be some question of how an event which occur- red with extreme rarity could be named. Let us pass over that difficulty, however, to indicate another which Aristotle brought up himself. He immediately makes a new distinction between chance events and those which happen spontaneously,6 "of their own accord." The former occur in events in which human choice is found and here "chance" involves the signi- ficance of either good or bad luck. Hence beings like animals and children cannot have good and bad luck for the simple reason that they are incapable of choice. But similarly in occurrences in which nonliving things participate, something may happen for an end which in the nature of the case could not have been planned. A three-legged stool may fall in such a manner that it stands upright and hence can be sat upon. This is a spontaneous event. One might imagine that the rarity of such things would be enough to warrant our calling them chance events, but Aristotle is so struck apparently by the actualization of unplanned purposes that he makes a special class of the events which lead up to them. The identification of chance events with accidental events, in the technical sense of "accidental," is sup- ported by Aristotle's definition of "chance" in the Rhetoric (1369 a 32). "Chance events," he says there, "are those which occur without a determinate cause and not for the sake of something and neither always nor for the most part nor regularly." Here he is not limiting the events to cases where choice or delibera- tion might enter in and is willing to overlook the ele- ment of conscious purpose. On the contrary he is thinking of a class of happenings which are distin- 76 ro rvxrs and &amp;iro rabro.Larov respectively. 36 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="36">THE TWO WORLDS guished by their infrequency, their purposelessness, and their irregularity. The distinction thus is clearly between chance and nature. If now one look up the definition of the accidental in the Philosophical Lexicon (Metaphysics, Delta, chapter 30) or later in Metaphysics, 1065 a 1, one will have few doubts that the fortuitous is brought about by an accident's be- coming a final cause. In fact the fortuitous as the ac- cidental is also used in the Magna moralia (1206 b 38) where the infrequency of chance events distinguishes them from natural events and in the Eudemian Ethics (1247 a 32) where the same distinction is made. This leads one to believe that it became part of the Peripa- tetic tradition. The fundamental distinction then be- tween natural and chance events is that between con- stant, regular events which can be described in what we would call a law, and irregular and infrequent events. It should be clear that if an event occurs only once, then its cause, whether natural or not, cannot be determined, for there is no knowable cause of a par- ticular event which is also unique in kind; knowledge is possible only of classes of things. We may then observe or perceive or feel individual events, but we cannot have knowledge of them. This is derivative in all probability from the Platonic tradition of the distinction between knowledge and opinion, knowledge in both Plato and Aristotle pertaining to universals, opinion to particulars. Opinion, when put into words, will masquerade as knowledge, since language will use symbols which are the names of universals. Thus we can be led astray by it. We should perhaps refrain from trying to verbalize it.7 But this would be a 7 Aristotle's use of the word 36oa in general is as a name for beliefs of whose truth or falsity we cannot be sure; an opinion may be true or false (Topics, 123 a 17). It is frequently dis- tinguished from knowledge (frLoTir7) or scientific understanding which is held to be always true (Posterior analytics, 89 a 2; Topics, 121 a 23; Metaphysics, 1008 b 27; Nichomachean ethics, 1142 a 33 and 1143 a 2). This is a commonplace in the corpus. But the distinction between knowledge and opinion goes back at least to the poem of Parmenides in which "the way of opinion" is contrasted with "the way of truth," where opinion is equated with unsubstantiated belief, not necessarily with the apprehen- sion of particulars. In the Peripatetic Rhetorica ad Alexandrum (1431 b 9) "opinion" is defined as the speaker's "declaration of thoughts about things," that is, his beliefs. The problem which this distinction involves is that of how a man can have true knowledge and beliefs which may be either true or false if our judgments are reflections of objects. To explain this Aristotle invokes the existence of two kinds of object; those which cannot be otherwise, which are the objects of knowledge, and those which can be otherwise, the objects of opinion (cf. inter alia, Posterior analytics, 89 a 2). To be otherwise is to change and hence the object of opinion is in the realm of change. It should be added that the objects in question in at least one place (De somniis, 458 b 10) are things as distinguished from qualities, for there he points out that, when in a dream we see a horse or a man or something which is white or beautiful, we cannot be mistaken about the whiteness or the beauty but might be about the horse or the man. This is pointed out since sensory perception of qualities is always true (De anima, 428 a 11). Since there are no sensory percepts in dreams and since opinion depends upon counsel of despair, since one of the major tasks of philosophy is the clarifying and stabilizing of opinion. If the world were perfect, there would presumably be no objects of opinion in it. All things would fall into classes whose general traits would permit the formulation of laws. But the world is imperfect since universals are always incorporated. The incorpora- tion of a timeless being is a mystery, since nothing whatsoever ought to happen to such a being. Worst of all, if we can have only perception of particulars and no knowledge, how do we evade the contemplation of the universal when it is embedded in matter? Would it not have been as reasonable to maintain that the contemplation of a particular is also the contemplation of the incorporated universal? It would have been a simpler theory as far as a theory of truth was con- cerned but Aristotle, like all philosophers, had to grant the occurrence of error. Hence he was willing to confer upon some unknowable something, i.e., matter, the power of degrading the universals, so that an in- corporated essence is not only unknowable but is also imperfect, approximating but never attaining its ideal form. The question consequently arises of how far we can know the forms in their incorporated state, since every incorporation deforms them. The answer should be that we never can know them, but, as readers of De anima will recall, Aristotle is himself in a state of indecision on this point. He believes (1) that sensory objects are particulars (De anima, 417 b 22) and the objects of scientific understanding universals and (2) that sensation is the receptacle of "sensible forms without their matter" (ibid., 424 a 18; 425 b 23). But a form, whether sensible or not, without matter cannot be a particular and, if it is not a particular, then sensation cannot be alteration as he maintains it is in still another passage (ibid., 415 b 24; cf. 416 b 34). We are thus back once more at the problem of the Meno: how can one know, in the Aristotelian sense of some sensory experience, our judgments in dreams cannot be opinion but must be a special class of beliefs. If then we can have opinions only about things as distinguished from sensory qualities, opinion always refers to the realm of change, time, chance, and particulars. The object of knowledge, however, must be immutable, eternal, necessary, and universal. What else can it be but Plato's world of ideas? When Aristotle says that knowledge, as distinguished from opinion, is the apprehen- sion of a truth which cannot be otherwise (Posterior analytics, 89 a 7), he must be thinking of objects which are not in the world of time. But when he says in the Topics (121 a 23) that opinion may be about things which do not exist but that this is not true of knowledge, he must again be implying that the objects of knowledge do exist and such things are ideas. That is perhaps why in the Metaphysics (1009 a 7) he couples opinion with phenomena as that which distinguishes it from knowledge (cf. ibid., 1039 b 34). It is then, I feel, no distortion of his assump- tions to say that corresponding to the world of nature and the world of observation and chance are two kinds of cognition, knowledge and opinion respectively. And this in spite of the fact that he characterizes the doctrines of his predecessors as opinions, even though they are far from exclusively concerned with phenomena. VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] 37</page><page sequence="37">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE "know," what one is observing? To know it requires knowing its form at least and that form is a universal. But one is confronted with particulars in perception. The problem might be expected to have been solved by the doctrine of potential forms and no doubt Aristotle thought it was so solved. But since the forms are corrupted by incorporation, one never knows what one has before one's eyes, however clearly one may perceive it. It may be on this account that Aristotle insisted on the natural's being that which always happens, so that repetition is necessary. For repetition eliminates the peculiarities of particu- lar occurrences. If, for instance, something happens ten times, there will be both a variety of qualities before one and also a residue of sameness. It is that residue which gives one the universal. But clearly if the repetition is a repetition of things perceived, then we must rely on our memory for skimming off the variety. The fact that memory too is not the simple retention of the past but on the contrary modifies the past and selects from it certain features which might be said to be "of interest" to us, is not a problem for Aristotle. To him memory is a state of perception (De memoria, 449 b 25); it is, he says (ibid., 450 a 23), a possession of that part of the soul to which images (apavTariat) belong; it is a sort of picture; it is like the imprint made by a seal.8 But this figure of speech makes matters worse than before, for all that could be retained in memory would be that which was im- pressed upon the soul in perception and we are back where we were before, namely at the point where we must decide whether there is something in all percep- tions of a given type which is identical, in which case generalizations become unfailingly true. But gen- eralizations are not unfailingly true. Thus Aristotle is caught in his own figure of speech. What he says about memory and sensation is basic to all his thinking about knowledge. Knowledge for him is not a set of judgments made by human beings on historical occasions, judgments which are tested for their reliability in a variety of ways, but is some- how or other, as we have said above, a reflection of the structure of its subject-matter. By his time it was taken for granted that an external world affects the human mind by transferring to it some of its proper- ties. These properties in the Middle Ages became the sensible species, but even before Aristotle they could be found in the eidola of Democritus and possibly in the "qualitative atoms" of Anaxagoras. The mind as a wax tablet on which external objects made an impression was accepted as a basic metaphor for cog- nition well up into our own times. It seemed to justify the slogan, Nihil in intellectu quod non prius in sensu which appeared in different form in De anima (432 a), where Aristotle states flatly and without 8 Beare in the Oxford translation refers the simile of the seal to Theaetetus, 191 D. But it should be pointed out that Plato's inference is quite different from Aristotle's. qualification that even concepts are in the sensible forms. As we shall see, I hope, when we come to his assumptions about change, something similar hap- pened when alteration took place: what we shall call floating qualities passed from one bit of matter to another. At most all that cognition could acquire through perception would be a selection of the attri- butes of the external world and beyond that selection -if there is anything beyond it-all would be un- known and unknowable. For even if we had some revelation of a causal principle which would induce us to attribute certain causes to observed data, (1) it is never good procedure to argue from effect to cause and (2) rules of procedure are not themselves objects of observation. For this reason too there would be a split in Aristotle's world. 3. NECESSITY AND CHANCE The gap between Aristotle's two worlds is deepened by the discrepancy between necessity and chance. "Necessity," the word, is defined in Metaphysics, Gamma, chapter 4 (1006 b 31), as the impossibility that a thing not be. But under what conditions a thing can or cannot be is not discussed there. Never- theless, it would seem to follow that, if there was some- thing which always was, neither coming into being nor passing away, that thing would be necessary. Amongst such things would be the "simples." For he says (ibid., 1015 b 11), "First and above all the neces- sary is the simple; for this cannot exist in several ways, now being one thing, now another. For then it would be various. Hence if it is both eternal and unmoved, none of the simples would be subject to force or con- trary to nature."9 Here the contrast is between the necessary and that which is subject to force (or violence), for force is that which upsets the order of nature. There is, moreover, a similar contrast be- tween the necessary and the unnatural. It is force which moves the elements out of their natural posi- tions back into which they move when the force is exhausted. Finally, variation in this passage seems to refer specially to alteration, qualitative change, or else to increase and diminution. The simple could move about in space without losing its simplicity and, as we know, the floating qualities did so move about without losing their simplicity or suffering any internal change. If, however, a simple were to come into being or pass away, the principle ex nihilo, in one of its two senses, would be violated. Yet qualitative change occurs instantaneously and what happens to the qualities between their disappearance and their re- 9 The critic of Aristotle would be tempted to ask what is the antecedent of "it." If Aristotle is talking of a simple such as a patch of red, there is no red something except the patch. If where there is now red, there appears green, there is no "it" to turn green; green appears where red was. But Aristotle is in- capable, except when talking of the sensible species, to think of attributes which are not the attributes of a subject. 38 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="38">THE TWO WORLDS appearance is nowhere discussed. Presumably they move from one part of space or one bit of matter to another, as in the passage in the Metaphysics (1034 a 26) where Aristotle speaks of how heat moves- probably from a hand-into a body which is being rubbed. In Metaphysics, Delta, chapter 5 (1015 a) the defi- nitions of the necessary are fivefold. It turns out to be (a) that without which, as a condition, a thing cannot live; (b) the conditions without which good cannot be or come to be; (c) that which impedes or hinders the fulfillment of impulse and purpose; (d) that which cannot be otherwise; (e) the logically necessary. Here the five classes of the necessary can be reduced to three: (a) the conditions without which something, either living or non-living, valuable or simply existing, cannot be or come into being, the conditiones sine quibus non; (b) compulsions, such as restraints and frustrations; (c) logical necessity. The first two obvi- ously are to be found only in the world of change and becoming, the latter in the world of eternity. Let us call the first kind of necessity "causal" to distinguish it from logical necessity. Whether Aristotle himself would agree to this reduction of the three kinds of necessity is doubtful, for in Metaphysics, Lambda, chapter 7 (1072 b 11) he retains the distinction be- tween the existence of things and that of the good. We can only conjecture his reason for this, but when we remember that the good is determined by dialectic, not by observation, his reason seems clearer. The good for man is deduced from his essential nature, not from an inventory of the ends which men actually pursue. To put the matter most simply, man's end is the realization of his essential nature and that will be discovered in the definition of the concept "man." This, as I say, is nothing more than guesswork on my part, but at any rate it gives some justification for the distinction between the conditions under which alone the good can be attained and those under which things in general come into being. If we are right, then behind all this reasoning about necessity lies the dis- tinction between the two worlds, that of reason and that of observation. The former alone is susceptible of scientific treatment. In accordance with this we find Aristotle in the Metaphysics (1064 b 30) arguing that it is impossible to have science of the accidental will be evident should we try to know what the accidental is. We say that everything either exists always and from necessity (and we use the word "necessity" not as we do when speaking of things caused by force, but in the sense in which it is used when speaking of logical demonstration) or that it occurs for the most part, or else neither for the most part nor always and necessarily but as it happens.10 For instance, it might be cold in the dog-days, but this happens neither always and necessarily nor for the most part, but it might happen sometime or other. The acci- 10 6rcows ruxev. I should have translated this "as luck would have it," if that did not seem to beg the question. dental then is that which occurs neither always nor from necessity nor for the most part. We have then told what the accidental is, and wherefore there is no science of it is clear. For all science is of that which always exists or exists on the whole, but the accidental is of neither sort. Few assertions could be more forthright than this. There is no scientific knowledge of the accidental and the reason why is that such knowledge is always of universals, that which happens "on the whole" being as close to the universal as experience can come. The accidental exists but there is no accounting for it be- cause it happens irregularly. It has no knowable cause, since one can find a cause only in eventswhich follow a definite pattern. It is possible but not pre- dictable. And the reason why prediction is impossible is the very absence of the universal, that in whose absence syllogisms are also impossible. One sees then that "on the whole" is just a sop thrown to those critics who might maintain that experience does well enough by us if it gives us rough generalizations. But Aristotle is anxious that they be not too rough. Strictly speaking they ought not to be rough at all. Yet one criticism seems to have escaped Aristotle's mind. Where is one going to cut off the events which are accidental? If it is cold in the dog-days, is the event the temperature or the temperature-in-the-dog- days? If we have knowledge of why temperature in general drops, then we can understand why it should drop in the dog-days. If, however, rises and falls in temperature have to be integrated into the seasons of the year so that cold-in-the-summer is inherently dif- ferent from cold-in-the-winter, the generalization which explains the occurrence of cold in general will not apply to cold-at-a-given-season. So a modern physician might have information about the aetiology of pneu- monia but also find that some of his patients do not get the disease as some of his other patients do, that is, there will be some deviations from the general rule. The more one includes the connections between things in one's delimiting of events, the more difficult it will be to show why any cause should exist which would be responsible for them. And since one would have to push one's inquiry back into the beginnings of time and forward into its end, one would sooner or later reach the point where unintelligibility would have the upper hand. The cutting off of things and events from one another is a process which is bound to be conventional, sometimes determined by one's tradi- tional vocabulary, sometimes by the tradition of scientific method, and occasionally by one's own deci- sion independent of these factors. It will not have escaped one's notice that the adjec- tive "universal" is used in two ways. First, it seems to refer to sensory qualities, colors, sounds, tastes, and the like, which appear to be self-identical wherever they occur. These are the sensible species, derived from Aristotle's theory (De anima, 424 a 18), of which we have already spoken, that "sensation receives the VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] 39</page><page sequence="39">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE sensible species (rwv atlaffrwv e1wv) without the matter." These forms and ideas conceived in their likeness, such as geometrical shapes and other abstrac- tions, in short anything named by an abstract noun, are not believed to vary from occurrence to occurrence. But second, the universal may be the way in which something occurs, the rule itself, e.g., that Fire always moves out to the periphery of the sublunary world; that men always beget men and cocks chickens. The former type of universal could reasonably be said to be observable, but the latter for obvious reasons could not. The most that one could say about them is that as far as our memory goes, they are universal. But to give them universality in the strict sense of the word is to extrapolate their data well beyond one's experi- ence into the past and future as well as into remote regions of space. We should of course be inclined to identify the usual, that which happens on the whole, with the statistically modal and to base our calculations of probability on it. If Aristotle were to be understood as an empirical scientist, he would have had to do so too. He did to be sure make some concessions to the world of chance in the De partibus animalium (639 b 23) where he distinguished between absolute necessity which is found in things eternal and conditional necessity which is found in everything that is generated by nature as well as in those made by art. But conditional neces- sity is the kind of necessity belonging to the conditions needed for reaching a certain end, our first set. It is not necessary that the end be reached, but, if it is to be reached, then certain preliminary steps or conditions are needed. The birth of a child, the building of a house, the writing of a poem are not inevitable con- sequences of their appropriate beginnings. In each case, it will be noticed, an individual or particular event is involved. But we can safely say that if such particular events are to take place, then certain prior events must also have taken place. We discover the necessity of the prior conditions by observation and presumably by generalization, though it might be pos- sible to discover them by reasoning alone. For though Aristotle distinguished between the natural-physical -sciences and demonstration, pointing out that dem- onstration begins in that which exists and that natural sciences begins in that which is to be (ibid., 640 a 3), and that consequently the kinds of necessity differ in each, nevertheless in the Physics he does not hesitate to use formal reasoning to prove his points nor would he maintain that physics was merely a practical science, like ethics or politics. In the Physics (Book II, chapter 9) there is a long discussion of necessity as both conditional and simple or absolute. Here conditional necessity is seen to reside in the material cause, for without the material cause the end would not be reached. But the final cause determines also what the matter should be, for one cannot reach any end whatsoever by means of any matter whatsoever. Yet final causes in natural change can be determined by logic through definition. For final causes in natural changes are, as we have said, always the essence of that which is undergoing the change. Hence absolute necessity in physics appears in the discussions about the order of nature as dis- tinguished from discussions about the world of obser- vation. The latter events are contingent, if not acci- dental. In spite of his theory of natural teleology, he is willing to admit that sometimes necessity, in the sense of compulsion, may frustrate the achievement of natural ends (Posterior Analytics, 95 a 1),11 as when a stone is thrown upwards, which is contrary to its natural motion. Most natural science can do no better than to deal with the necessary in the sense of the usual or the con- ditions without which a given event cannot occur. For instance, when he discusses our need for sleep (De somno, 455 b 23), he is found to say, The state of being awake is the end. For sensation and thought are the ends of all things which possess one or both of them. For these are the best and the end is the best. So that it is necessary that each animal have sleep. But I use the word "necessary" in the conditional sense: if an animal is to exist and have its own nature, it must neces- sarily have also certain capacities, and if these exist, then others must exist. Sleep therefore is needed if an animal is to achieve its end, being awake. That sleep is a condition of being awake is discovered by pointing out that sensation is a form of motion and that sleep is a rest. Either Aristotle is arguing dialectically on the ground that change always proceeds from a state to its opposite or he has observed that sleep actually rests the body and mind, in which case he is simply punning on the word "rest." The determination of the end, however, is made by logic alone. The animals are distinguished from plants by their possession of sensation,'2 from man by his possession of reason. Therefore, the end of animals must be the realization of their essential nature, vegetation plus sensation; that is an absolute necessity, though it may be frustrated. Whatever is needed to insure the realization of that end is necessary only conditionally. This is clarified in a well-known passage of De interpretatione, chapter 9, in which Aristotle, discussing the necessity of future events, points out that the alternative, "A either will or will not occur," is not equivalent to the alternative, "A either must or must not occur." It is true that John Doe either will or will not die tomorrow, but it is not true that he either must or must not die tomorrow. The former is a logical, the latter a causal sentence. One needs nothing more than a knowledge of elemen- 11 Yet nothing happens for an end by chance, ibid., 95 a 9, in spite of his example of the three legged stool. I see no way of "reconciling" these inconsistencies and shall not attempt to do so. Cf. Nichomachean ethics, 1153 b 18. 12 Plants, lacking sensation, do not sleep. See De somno, 454 a 16. 40 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="40">THE TWO WORLDS tary logic to make the former judgment, but to make the latter requires a knowledge of existent causes which no one has. There could scarcely be a clearer presentation of the difference between formal and existential sentences. Unfortunately, Aristotle also assumes that logic agrees with ontology. The interrelations between logical and causal neces- sity are expanded in De generatione et corruptione (337 b) where the argument is directly concerned with the distinction between the necessary and the contin- gent. The question is raised whether all things that come to be are contingent or whether some are neces- sary. Here he distinguishes between the things that cannot possibly not-be and the things that can not-be. A house cannot come into being unless the foundations exist. But the foundations may exist and the house never be finished.'3 This is the existential analogue of the fallacy of affirming the consequent to prove the antecedent in a hypothetical syllogism. The result of this state of affairs, observation of which is empirical- for who would know without experience that the rela- tion of implication was not symmetrical?-is that in order to avoid an infinite regress the necessary coming- to-be must be cyclical. This immediately puts us back into the realm of logical necessity and the eternal. For in the series of cycles it is the kind of thing which is repeated, not the thing itself. It is perhaps for that reason that Aristotle in the Physics (199 b) attempts to iron out the difficulties caused by the different kinds of necessity. In that place he introduces a definition and illustration of conditional necessity which is in harmony with the others which we have quoted. He points out that it "exists in all things which involve production for an end" (ibid., 200 a 7), that is, in instruments. Here the instrument is as it is because of the end for which it is designed, but the end cannot be realized unless the instruments are made of a certain kind of matter. If, for instance, a saw is to fulfill its function, it must be made of iron. It may not be necessary to have saws, but if we are to have them, then we must also have iron. Yet the end, he says, is the definition of the instrument. And certain ends demand certain materials for their realization. Natural necessity is "plainly what is called matter and the changes [or motions] therein" (ibid., 200 a 30). Thus the relation between a given end and a given kind of matter would seem to be determined by logical necessity which, in spite of its being logical, is condi- tional and not absolute. But one could not also con- clude that the existence of the appropriate matter was ground for predicting the existence of its end. The sharp distinction between absolute and con- ditional necessity is plausible only if one have reason to believe that logical demonstration is divorced from the world of observation and if the rules for manipu- lating propositions are somehow or other acquired in 13 Cf. Metaphysics, 1003 a 2, on the possibility of unfulfilled potencies. independence of what is ordinarily called "experience." Such rules in Aristotle's philosophy would be the Laws of Thought, especially the Law of Contradiction and the Law of Excluded Middle. We shall postpone a discussion of the relation between these laws and the realm of observation and content ourselves here with repeating once again how Aristotle accepted the gap between the two worlds which in Neo-Platonism were called the Intelligible and the Sensible Worlds. On the one hand, we have a necessary linkage of ideas, on the other an apparently necessary linkage of causes and effects, of means and ends. Nothing, says Aristotle in De caelo (287 b 25) and elsewhere,'4 which concerns the eternal can be a matter of chance and spontaneity; therefore the eternal is necessary. The eternal, however, in Aristotle is not always the time- less; sometimes it is the everlasting. If it could be definitely equated with the former, one could assert with confidence that in his opinion absolute necessity is always logical necessity. But in the passage of De caelo to which we have just referred the necessity is both absolute and, since it is found in the heavens, must be admitted to occur in the observable world. No one could of course observe the everlasting repeti- tion of the celestial motions, though Aristotle is sure that they are everlasting, without beginning or end, since they are circular.'5 The fusion between the idea of the eternal and the everlasting or constant is so often asserted in the corpus that it is perhaps ostentatious to give references here, but we might cite such different works as the Topics (112 b), De memoria (451 b 12), Metaphysics (1088 b 24), Nichomachean Ethics (1139 b 24), De generatione et corruptione (335 a 29), and finally De anima (430 a 23) where the immortality of the active reason is coupled with eternity. The iden- tification of the eternal, the necessary, and that which always happens or which happens on the whole sur- vived into the Peripatetic tradition, as we see in De mundo (401 b 8), where Necessity is identified with God (Zeus).16 A methodological problem confronted Aristotle at this point. Science to him, as we have already pointed out, was based on knowledge of the four causes. One could have scientific knowledge only of the orderly and the orderly was repeated indefinitely. The order in question was exemplified in the actualization of potencies. But if one began with observation, how was one to know which series of events were such actualizations and which were not? Eggs, for in- stance, in modern America more often turn into some- 14 See Metaphysics, Lambda, chapter 6; De generatione et corruptione, 338 a 1; De partibus animalium, 639 b 24. 16 See De caelo, Book I, chapter 5; Book II, chapters 4 and 6. 16 But see Theophrastus, Metaphysics, chapter 11 (10 a 26) and chapter 34 (11 b 15), ed. Ross, where the purposive is contrasted with the necessary. Here the distinction seemed to be that between antecedent causation and final causation. See also, for what it is worth, Divisiones, cod.

This may sound facetious, but if a man be asked to rely on his observation of what happens for the most part and regularly, he should not also be asked to overlook his daily observations. The changes which I have listed are undeniably in Aristotle's opinion accidental and not natural. Yet they are orderly and to make them unnatural or con- trary to nature, one must define "nature" as the natural order minus mankind and, in the case of acorns, pigs. But since every change is bound to be the actualization of some form, whether one inherent in the matter, as in living beings, or introduced into the matter, as in artistry, the mere fact that one observes the process of actualization going on before one's eyes does not give one ground for thinking that one is observing the exemplification of a law of nature. Consequently, one must look for another criterion. And that criterion, as we have said, is regular sequences. Nature thus takes on two distinct mean- ings: (1) the logical order and (2) observed regular sequences. The second is assumed, not proved, to be an image of the first. But like time in Plato, it is a moving image of eternity. First, then, nature is said to follow a cyclical course so that no single process will be endless. And here the paradigm is the repetition of the life-cycle from egg to maturity (De generatione animalium, 741 b 18); the uniformity of the human mind (De interpretatione, 16 a 5); and the absence of random action in nature (Physics, 188 a 31 and fre- quently elsewhere). But Aristotle also seems to have seen that the repetition is never exact. For he says, for instance, in De partibus animalium (663 b 27), as so often, "It is necessary to find nature by looking at a large number of cases; for the natural is either in the whole or in what happens on the whole." To distin- guish then between those apparently regular sequences, of which we have given three examples above, and those which are a manifestation of natural law, we have to turn to another principle, for observation clearly is not sufficient. We cannot observe what always happens in a superhuman way and when we look at what most frequently happens, it may turn out to be unnatural or artificial. The principle which we are looking for is given in the Nichomachean Ethics (1115 b 22): "Each thing is defined by its end." This is really not very different from the more ordinary statement that a definition gives the genus and differentia, since a definition pro- vides the essence of the definiendum and the essence in natural change is, as we have repeatedly said, the final cause. Hence, when we are seeking natural sequences, we have to define the end by the general process during which matter takes on form. But this tosses us back into the empirical, for even in the case of familiar animals, we could not deduce by logical means alone the end of any of them. For statistically we have no way knowing whether the most frequent sequences are natural in Aristotle's sense of that word or not. To resort to definition demands knowing to what genus the definiendum "naturally" belongs, as well as knowing its differentia. It may be granted that once one possessed this information, one would always know whether a given change was natural or not. The Tree of Porphyry, if developed to the point where all its branches and twigs were delineated, would provide us with the necessary data, but there is always the question of how the divisions are to be determined. Porphyry made them, to be sure, by the process of dichotomy. But he never tells us how he decided what the principle of division was to be. How did he know that Being was to be divided first on the principle of corporeality? Was this an empirical observation or was it implicit in the concept of Being? Neither he nor anyone else to the best of my knowledge has ever done more than tell us the rule for a sound division and, though one would be foolish to deny that a dichotomy exhausts the class which it divides, the value of any kind of division lies not only in its ex- haustiveness but also, if it is to have ontological sig- nificance, should, as Socrates says in the Phaedrus, cut at the joints as prescribed by nature. In any event Aristotle does not limit the kinds of division to two; he believes that there are four kinds: those which will give one the so-called opposites, the contraries, the privations, and the contradictories (Topics, 109 b 15). When one is determining contraries and con- tradictories, one has only to manipulate one's termi- nology. But there seems to be no purely formal method of determining what the opposite or the priva- tion of a quality would be. Given a term such as "white," one can immediately derive from it "non- white," but not "black." For to know that "black" is the opposite of "white" requires experience.17 One could always lay it down as a rule that when a term is under consideration, its attribution to a subject can be denied; but that is no evidence of what the absence of the attribute would "look like." My point here reduces to the argument that a negative of an attribu- tion is always indefinite unless one has prior informa- tion (a) that the Law of Excluded Middle is exempli- fied and (b) of what its exemplification would result in. Otherwise one might have on one's hands a large number of contraries, all of which are included in the symbol "Non-A." Whence does that prior knowl- edge come? Presumably from observation, in spite of the limits of observation. Observation could show that "on the whole" when white disappears black takes its place or that when something loses its heat, it becomes cold. But either the second terms in these 17 In the Categories, chapter 10, Aristotle discusses the four kinds of opposition in more detail: (1) the opposites as correla- tives to each other; (2) as contraries to each other; (3) as priva- tives to positives; (4) as affirmatives to negatives. But again only the fourth can be determined a priori. 42 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="42">THE TWO WORLDS and similar pairs are simply names for the absence of certain "positive" states or qualities, or they are the names for perceptible qualities which are discovered to appear when certain other states or qualities dis- appear. This would suffice to link together certain experienced states or qualities in pairs but would not suffice to reveal which was positive and which negative or privative. Empirically there is nothing negative or privative or relative in any observation, if we are thinking of perceptual units such as the various sen- sory data. But if one first assumes that the collection of possible data can be simplified by coupling opposites together, then of course one will look for verification of that assumption. It was no mean discovery to have seen that a moving object may go up but not down at the same time, while it can go up and also become hot, or, let us say, red at the same time. But all such events take place in the world of perceptual observation, not in the world of logic, for in that world there is no change of any kind. Let us return then to the last chapter of the Posterior Analytics where Aristotle gives us one of his clearest accounts of the genesis of our knowledge of the "pri- mary immediate premises" (ras irpwras apXas ras aLo-ous). He denies that such knowledge is innate, since it seems incredible to him that we should possess it and yet fail to be conscious of it. If on the other hand it is acquired, how could we know and learn anything in the absence of previous knowledge? "It must be that we have some potency [of these states of knowledge and learning], but not such that it will be superior in accuracy" (ibid., 99 b 32). This potency is shared by the beasts, but some beasts have only sensory perception which is an innate judicial power (5vvaatv av/uvrTov KpLTLKJv). Out of sensation arises memory and many memories constitute a single ex- perience. Some animals do not have memory, others do. Out of experience emerge the universals, "the one beside the many" (ro9 evos ,rapa ra 7roXXa, ibid., 100 a 7). At this point one expects some account of how this emergence can take place. But such expec- tations are not fulfilled. Aristotle simply asserts that "one perceives the particular, but sensation is of the universal, for instance, of man, but not of Callias the man" (ibid., 100 a 16). The distinction between the verb alarOaverat and the noun a'ofrOas is radical. The noun seems to name that which is acquired from the act named by the verb.l8 That a variety of universals 18 Mure in the Oxford translation renders this passage, "Though the act of sense-perception is of the particular, its content is universal-is man, for instance, not the man Callias." But if in the act of perception one perceives Callias the individual, how is he differentiated from the universal, man? Ross in his commen- tary on this says, "These words serve to explain how it is that the 'standing still' of an individual thing before the memory is at the same time the first grasping of a universal; this is made easier to understand by the fact that even at an earlier stage- that of perception (icaL yap allafveraL)-the awareness of an individual is at the same time awareness of the universal present might emerge in this way and not merely the universal "man," is not mentioned by Aristotle, probably be- cause he thought that there were certain "natural" universals which would emerge out of the welter of perceived data "of their own accord." At any rate he does maintain that from the preliminary universals others more general would emerge until one reached those primary and immediate principles, the categories. These principles are apprehended by the nous, for that alone grasps truths which are as incon- trovertible as the truths of scientific knowledge. Behind all this lies the assumption of which we have already spoken, of a one-to-one correspondence between the elements of knowledge and of reality. Otherwise, though there might exist an evolution of universals out of perception, there would be no reason to believe that they revealed anything about the non- perceptual world. Aristotle is not interested in show- ing how a logically consistent system of ideas might arise in this fashion but in showing how a factually true set of ideas might so arise. This is harmonious with his entire theory of truth, which is discussed elsewhere. The first universals to be apprehended by perception must reflect common characters which have some sort of ontological superiority over all other possible characters. Out of them and what proceeds from them by induction must appear the genuine structure of the cosmos, a structure which could serve as a model for such philosophers as Plotinus when they set up their cosmic hierarchies. If one may abuse a fragment of Heraclitus, the way up and the way down would be the same and it would make very little dif- ference where one began the search for the primary premises.19 But again Aristotle gives no clue to the correct method of determining whether the universals which one has induced out of perception are the right ones. The clearest hint is to be found in the doctrine of chance as the unusual. Chance events are those which occur "contrary to what happens always or on the whole" (Physics, 197 a 20). They always occur as accidental causes, not essential (ibid., 196 b 23; cf. Posterior Analytics, 87 b 19). For that reason they are not subject to demonstration. If then certain universals always or for the most part were appre- hended in a set of similar experiences, they would be "natural" universals. For, as we have said, nature shows itself in regularities and nothing regular can be the effect of chance. That would be too much to believe (De caelo, 289 b 24). Hence a person by chance might in the individual; we perceive an individual thing, but what we perceive in it is a set of qualities each of which can belong to other individual things." This is all very well, and certainly Ross's knowledge of the subject is firmer than mine, but if we do perceive universals in experience, if there is a distinction to be made between perception and its "content," then what is there left over beside the content to be particular? 19 Is it superfluous to point out that Plotinus quotes this frag- ment in Ennead IV, viii, 1? VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] 43</page><page sequence="43">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE derive the wrong universal from perception, but he would not be likely to do so constantly.20 There are then two kinds of occurrences, those which happen always or for the most part and those which happen occasionally; this needs no further proof. But since chance is more characteristic of "the things that die" (De partibus animalium, 641 b 19) than of the heavens, and since human beings live among such things, one might imagine that there would be greater variation in their experience than he is willing to admit. There is, to be sure, a parallel in human nature to the struc- ture of nonhuman nature. For reason is analogous to nature and can know the things that are constant, whereas perception is analogous to chance, now seeing this, now that. But reason could furnish us with an escape from the realm of chance and disorder only if it were somehow or other independent of it, as it appears to be in modern formal logic. If, however, its roots are in perception which stands, so to speak, as the potentiality of reason, then one is still left with the problem of how it comes about that the eternal arises out of the temporal. More puzzling still is the belief that, though chance events cannot be the subject of demonstration (Posterior Analytics, 87 b 19), nevertheless chance can be a true cause of things. One must avoid the temp- tation of interpreting Aristotle as a disciple of Pro- fessor Bridgman and saying that he means by the natural merely the regular and that all he means by chance is the unusual. On the contrary, he hypos- tatizes both chance and nature. He devotes a whole chapter of the Physics (Book II, chapter 5) to de- fending chance as a cause and the preceding chapter to attacking the people who deny it. The fact that it is only an accidental cause does not imply its in- efficiency. Things can happen "contrary to nature." Perverted governments, for instance, are a good ex- ample of this, if examples are needed. Aristotle is far from saying that such occurrences are rare; in fact, they occur so regularly in the field of politics that Aristotle might be expected to conclude that perver- sion of the good follows a law of nature and is for that reason a good too. But this is doubtless just one of those slips on his part which make the systematizing of his thought so awkward.2' To return to our main point, chance could not be a cause in his philosophy if it were not existentially distinct from that upon 20 Though I am almost ashamed to do so, I add the following references to those already given on the regularity of the natural: De generatione et corruptione, 333 b in Aristotle's criticism of Empedocles; De partibus animalium, 641 b 19; Nichomachean ethics, 1099 b 9, the discussion of whether happiness can be attained by chance; Magna moralia, 1207 b 37; Eudemian ethics, 1247 b 2; Rhetoric, 1361 b 40, 1369 a 31. 21 Another such slip is found in Rhetoric, 1365 a 27, where he says that what is natural is better than what is acquired, since it is harder to come by. Yet the natural, if it is that which happens always or for the most part, ought to be easier to come by. which it acts, the patient. This distinction is con- stantly present when Aristotle discusses any change in which a cause is involved. And in his analysis of change in two passages in the Physics (224 a 34 and 236 b 2) he sets off the patient as a separate entity. In the former passage he mentions five factors, the agent, the patient, the time, the terminus a quo, and the terminus ad quem; in the latter he mentions only three, the patient, the time, and the terminus ad quem. The existential gap between the agent and the patient is never denied even when, as is the case of the Unmoved Mover, it raises new problems. Chance is then an agent but as to its nature, we are given only information about its effects. We said at the opening of this section that the necessary could be found in three groups of events, the conditiones sine quibus non, compulsions, and logi- cal implication. If chance as a cause is an accidental cause, then it could also be one of the conditions without which its effect would not occur, or it might be compulsion, but it could not be logical implication. Moreover, chance could be the cause only of an indi- vidual event, not of a class, except in so far as events caused by chance could all be grouped together in one class. It could be one of the necessary conditions, however accidental, since without it the result would have been different. One of Aristotle's examples of an accidental cause is the presence of a man in a place where he is driven by a storm at sea (Metaphysics, Delta, chapter 30). This is accidental because the man did not plan to go there. In this example chance is contrasted with purpose. But presumably if the storm is the cause of his going there, it is because if there had been no storm he would not have gone there. It follows that in this case a chance event is an illus- tration of conditional necessity. 'But it could also in the same example be a case of compulsion, since the ship was driven to the place by the force of the wind and could not avoid going there. But one could not cite this example unless one had general knowledge of what happens to ships when beaten by heavy winds. And obviously in the last analysis this knowledge is derived from physics. In fact, there is nothing in compulsive necessity which conflicts with general knowledge. But the ship in Aristotle's case was actually driven to the island of Aegina and this removes the incident from the general class of storm- driven ships. It becomes an illustration of a dated and localized event, that is, an historical event. The ultimate difference between accidental and necessary events lies in the logical nature of the latter. For, as we have seen, there is no demonstrating why chance occurrences take place, no predicting them, where as necessary events are by their very nature knowable. One could predict that if heavy winds drove the ship out of its course, it might hit an island, but one could not predict that heavy winds would arise on the day in question, would then drive it out of its course, 44 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="44">THE TWO WORLDS and finally would send it to Aegina. After the occur- rence of the event, one can explain it by causal ex- planation. But as the ship put out from the Piraeus, one could not with the data at hand infer logically what was going to happen to it. This being so, the rarity of fortuitous events is not their differentia but simply a mark by means of which we can spot their occurrence. All events are translatable into those which exemplify universal logical principles and those which do not. But the latter will be individual his- torical events. What then does one do with individuals? There is no knowledge of individuals, says Aristotle in the Metaphysics (1003 a 13). In formula-i.e., rationally-the universals are prior, in perception the individual (ibid., 1018 b 32). The priority of the universal is a logical priority, that of the individual is historical or chronological. But this reduces to saying that "existence" is a-logical, a conclusion which is reinforced by Aristotle's refusal to identify sensation with knowledge (ibid., 999 b 1). If nothing existed apart from individuals, there would be no objects of thought but all things would be objects of sensation. Consequently there could be no knowledge of existence as distinguished from essence, unless one identified knowledge and perception. In spite of the non- cognitive nature of perception, Aristotle does not deny -for how could he ?-that we can make true and false propositions about individuals and he himself devotes a good bit of the Metaphysics to expounding his own knowledge of at least one individual, the Unmoved Mover. He can do so only in so far as this individual belongs to a larger class, that of movers, differentiated from them by his being unmoved. From then on he has to infer logically what sort of being such a one would be, i.e., how a being could move without being moved. If he had been able to assert that sensation was knowledge, he could have introduced a distinction which has become traditional in modern epistemology, that between immediate and mediated knowledge. The distinction has perhaps been more trouble than it was worth, but nevertheless it did permit men to make true and false judgments of individuals, judgments made by inspection. But Aristotle is firm in his belief that sensation is not knowledge for the very reason that it is always of individuals. This is in spite of his also believing, as we have pointed out, that sensation is apprehension of the universal. When I say that Aristotle does not accept the dis- tinction between immediate and mediated knowledge, I mean simply that he does not anticipate certain modern epistemologies which assign immediacy to perception. He has his own kind of immediacy. Our knowledge of the first principles is an example of it. He uses the term nous to name it (Posterior Analytics, 100 b 8) and distinguishes it from scientific knowledge, of which it is the source. But the process of attaining the apprehension of the first principles is never ex- plained except by metaphor, for Aristotle seems to think that step by step it will arise out of perception by the successive purifications of what we contem- plate. But it is much easier to say that, when we have seen Callias, Socrates, and Anacharsis, the uni- versal man emerges from our sight of them than it is to explain how a timeless and spaceless being could arise out of temporal and spatial beings; how "human- ity," even if it be nothing more than "rational ani- mality," could float out of beings who are seen, heard, smelled, in other words simply perceived. For to be a rational animal, according to Aristotle, is not to do anything perceptible whatsoever. It is one thing to see a body doing something; it is quite another to know what it is doing. And oddly enough, as I trust we have seen, when Aristotle is anxious to distinguish between sensation and knowledge, he makes this point himself. But when he is interested in the genesis of knowledge, he forgets his distinction.22 This introduces us to another fundamental conflict in Aristotle's thinking. In De anima (417 b 19) he says that perception when actualized is always of indi- viduals, whereas knowledge, as he so frequently says, is of universals. But if sensation is an actualization, it cannot be of particulars, for only universals, forms, can be actualized. The particularization of forms is brought about by their incorporation and strictly speaking the only difference between one red patch and another is the matter in which they are located. Yet the individual and the universal have identical properties in logic, individual propositions being treated as if they were universal. If he means that a given sensory faculty is actualization as the actualiza- tion of John Doe's eyesight or hearing or what not, then his science of psychology disintegrates, for ac- cording to his own principles as we have seen, we can have scientific knowledge only of universals. This may be behind his obvious wobbling on the question of the particularity of sensory objects. When he is not distinguishing sensation from understanding or scientific knowledge, he says that sensation is the receptacle of the "sensible forms without their matter" (De anima, 424 a 18; cf. 427 a 8). But how can a form without matter be a particular? Yet note that unless it be a particular, sensation cannot be alteration which he says it is (ibid., 415 b 24; 416 b 34). And if he means that a given sensory faculty is actualization as the actualization of that faculty in general, that is, of seeing, of hearing, and so on, then it cannot be of particulars. 22 Aristotle's interest in genesis is curious in view of his con- clusion that the cosmos has no beginning or end and that all natural change is cyclical. As far as I have been able to discover the only two things which seem to have no origin according to him are the Unmoved Mover and his analogue in the human soul, the Active Reason, though even the latter is doubtful. To assume that one of the fundamental problems of philosophy is origins is not self-justified and probably is a projection of birth into non-living events or of artistry. VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] 45</page><page sequence="45">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE The difficulty is compounded by his assertion of the truth of sensation (ibid., 427 b 12; 428 a 11; 418 a 14), which we have mentioned above. In the first of these passages Aristotle simply means that when we see a color, for instance, we cannot be mistaken about whether it is red, green, or yellow (428 b 21). How can one reconcile this with the axiom of the particu- larity of sensory objects? If thought is distinguished from sensation by the universality of its objects and both sensation and thought are said to be identical with being acted upon by the forms (427 a 8), which really means "receiving the forms," it follows that there is an identity of subject and object when one thinks, which he grants (407 a 7). This leads to the conclusion that both scientific knowledge and the nous are infallible (428 a 17). For if the form is directly present, how could one be in error about it? False- hood, according to Aristotle, always arises in syntheses (430 b 2), that is, when we combine two or more intel- ligibles. A synthesis, however, cannot be made by thought, for thought is the direct contemplation of the intelligible-as distinguished from the sensible- forms; it cannot be made by sensation, for sensation is the direct contemplation of the sensible forms. It must therefore be made by the process of reasoning (bapvota) through the use of the categories, though again a mystery arises over why reasoning should ever make the wrong syntheses.23 For if the qualities are apprehended in combination, there would be no error, and if a complex intelligible is contemplated by the nous, there could be none either. Things might have come out differently if it had not been for Aristotle's conception of all knowledge as a replica of its objects. This theory works out beauti- fully when we are interested in constructing a theory of truth, for all we have to do is to say that truth is "that which is" as grasped, apprehended by, reflected in, intuited by, impressed upon the mind. In sensory perception, at least when it is of extra-somatic objects, we seem to be confronted by qualities singly and in combination about which we are never in error. Somatic sensations are less easy to identify, but tradi- tionally epistemology begins with objects outside our skin. One looks and sees and that is all there is to it. Our primary empirical judgments seem to be simply verbal symbols for what we see. With this as a basis one then proceeds to construct the rest of our cognitive life. But we soon arrive at the point where we need certain properties which by their very nature cannot be found in the direct perception of static qualities here and now. These are properties information about which rests on information about the past or the future or both and sometimes about regions of space well beyond our present location. In an ex- perience which is here and now there is no evidence of 23 Maybe the imagination, which constructs one image out of several, is the synthesizer. See De anima, 434 a 9. a there and then, for, even if our perceptual powers sweep through a certain portion of space, there is always a horizon, and even if we recall things just past while perceiving something now, there is also and always a temporal horizon. How then on the basis of direct contemplation can one acquire information about things which are not enclosed within it? But there are also traits of knowledge which are those of universals or general principles. These traits are supposed to be antithetical to those of particulars. If the particular is in time, the universal, it is agreed, is timeless; if the particular is supposed to be here or there, the universal is supposed to be nowhere or, if one will, anywhere. If one says that the universals are always incorporated when experienced, then ex- perience is not particularized and one has the problem on one's hands of observed deviations from what the universal demands. And when one arrives at Aristotle's categories, the primary ideas, one is driven as he was, to a mystical intuition of them (Posterior Analytics, 100 b 9). Would it not then be better to abandon the metaphor of direct knowledge, whether of particulars or universals, and find a better one? At the root of all this confusion lies the assumption of the two worlds, so different in character that no one set of laws seems applicable to them both. Time as against eternity, unity as against multiplicity, immu- tability as against change, universality as against par- ticularity, reason as against observation. There are, however, reflections of the world of time in the world of eternity, some more, some less perfect. The move- ments of the heavenly bodies are the clearest picture which we have of the natural and eternal order, those of living beings-and one surmises especially of human beings-are the most obscure. When man can un- tangle from the heterogeneous world of observation a set of regular occurrences, he will conclude that they represent or exemplify the order of nature; when this is impossible, he has to resign himself to saying that what he is observing is unintelligible and the result of chance. Between the movements of the heavenly bodies and those of terrestrial conglomerates there are various degrees of regularity. For instance, the be- havior of material beings, compounds of the four elements, is very regular. The social and political behavior of humans, on the other extreme, is very irregular. The irregularity is attributable to the number of causes which may determine an event and it is assumed, or inferred from observation, that more such causes enter into human life than into the be- havior of material objects. Such an inference or assumption, one guesses, follows from the preliminary divisions or classifications of kinds of things upon which Aristotle bases his philosophy. Much of it was taken over from Plato and earlier philosophers, much from folklore. For instance, the recognition of the 46 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="46">VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] four elements was not initiated by Aristotle but by Empedocles. Aristotle took it for granted and then proceeded to simplify the inventory by compounding each element out of the logically possible pairs of ele- mentary qualities and their privations. The idea of universals and particulars seems to have come from Plato, as did the theory that two kinds of cognition were required for apprehending them. The division of living beings into three classes, plants, animals, and humans, probably was derived from folklore, though it corresponded roughly to linguistic usage and hence to ordinary observation. Three faculties of the soul may have been borrowed from Plato, for the vegetative, sensitive, and rational faculties roughly parallel the appetitive, irascible, and rational faculties in the Republic. The differentiation of the three classes of living beings on the principle of the kinds of souls which each class possessed seems to have been Aristotle's own. No one can be sure of how Aristotle reasoned to his conclusions when he does not tell us, but his assumption that the procedures of the reason were descriptive of the cosmic order undoubtedly led him towards first making certain logical operations, divisions, classifications, possible combinations, and then looking for their exemplification in the empirical world. By his assumption of an hypostasized chance, he was able to accept deviations, unnatural events, exceptions to the rule with a tolerance which some- times seems to amount to indifference. If his method of reasoning had been less dominated by Greek gram- mar, he might have begun with observing various degrees of regularity in the empirical world and have approached something like a statistical interpretation of it. But to his way of thinking, a word had to name an invariable; what it named had to be self-identical in all its supposed exemplifications. He could handle quantitative differences easily enough by simple arith- metic, but when he was confronted by degrees of qualitative difference, he was frustrated. That he recognized the existence of logical surds was a great achievement indeed, but they seem to have given him no clue to the weakness of his ontology. A long tradition in Greek thought had given to the terms "natural" and "according to nature" a eulogistic con- notation and he worked within that tradition. What- ever else nature was to be, it had to have such char- acteristics as would raise it in the esteem of the Greeks. The ambiguity of the term itself even in Aristotle is such that we may assume that it seemed to people to require little if any elucidation. For the lists of meanings which Aristotle gives us in the Metaphysics (Delta, chapter 4) and the Physics (Book II, chapter 1) are far from complete. It is a word which is as multivalent in Greek as it is in English.24 24 See Bonitz's Index, s.v., for its various meanings in Aristotle and Lovejoy and Boas, Primitivism in antiquity, Appendix, "Some Meanings of 'Nature' " (by A. 0. Lovejoy), p. 447. III. NATURE1 1. THE PRIMARY MEANING OF THE TERM In the Metaphysics (Delta, chapter 4) five senses are given of the word "nature" from which Aristotle draws the conclusion (1015 a 13) that "the primary and strict meaning of the word is the essence of things which have a source of movement (or change) in themselves as such." This is the sense which we have in English when we speak of the nature of a vertebrate or the nature of a planet. The behavior of such things requires no further explanation, when they are not being acted upon by some outside force, than that "this is their nature." From this primary meaning he attempts to derive the other meanings, the identification of nature with the matter, the pro- cess of coming into being and of growth, and the source of motion(or change). The nature of a thing is its matter since the kind of matter is in part a deter- minant of what it can do; e.g., if the thing is made of Earth, it will not be able to move upward of its own accord. The two processes mentioned furnish one meaning of the word, since there are only certain ways in which specific things can come into being and grow; it is their nature to do so. Since the source of motion (or change) may be either potentially present or ac- tually present, and is also the nature of the thing in question, it results that nature becomes a name for all four of the causes, the material, the efficient, the formal, and the final. These four must be present in any process and can be distinguished only for purposes of discourse. Hence "nature" here is simply a blan- ket-term and, just as Aristotle in the first book of the Metaphysics tried to show that the main error of his predecessors was selecting one of these meanings as the only right and proper meaning, so here he writes as if a treatise de rerum natura should constantly keep in mind the unity of all the meanings. But while he is saying this in effect, it should not be forgotten that frequently Aristotle qualifies the changes of which he is speaking by the term 0o-iL, "in nature," "naturally," or "in accordance with nature." This is introducing a new meaning, one which we have already pointed out, namely "the way things happen on the whole or for the most part," that is, when nothing interferes with their normal behavior. Thus when he speaks of nature as the motion itself of the things which change, he adds that it is of "the things that naturally exist" which are the subjects of his inquiry. Again, when he speaks of nature as the source of the change, it is a source which applies only to those things which exist in nature. This would seem to be a curious kind of circular argument made by a man who in his logical works had warned his 1 I apologize for the repetitions of previous remarks which will be made in this chapter. But in a study of this kind such repe- titions are inevitable. To avoid them would involve frequent references back to earlier pages, which would prove annoying. NATURE 47</page><page sequence="47">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE readers against it. Prior to this discussion then would seem to be an idea that there are two kinds of events which occur in this world, those which occur on the whole or always, and these are natural, and those which occur now and then, and these are not natural. The four meanings which he then introduces in the chapter of the Philosophical Lexicon are not only four uses of the word in philosophical writings, but four characteristics of the natural in this prior sense. If I speak only of four, instead of five meanings, it is be- cause the first is the meaning given to the term by people who mispronounce it in Greek, and need not be considered. Nature then in its primary sense can be defined as that system of things which change in a recognizable fashion from an observable or definable start to a fixed end, from matter to form, whether the change be growth as in living things, or manufacture as in the arts. But living things, at least in this passage, furnish the image which he wants to vivify, the idea in the back of his mind. That the processes of artistry are like those of growth is seen in the Poetics and the Rhetoric and in fact in all the practical treatises in which Aristotle lays down rules for the accomplish- ment of given ends. It would be folly to say that the famous phrase, "Art imitates nature," means exclu- sively that artistry imitates the process of growth, but nevertheless the entelechy which guides the growth of a living being is paralleled in artistry by the idea which the artist has in his mind and which controls his work. It is the persistent following of this idea which gives order to the artist's working and also, as anyone can see, makes it possible to group the mani- fold works of art under a relatively few generic names. Because of this a statue may result from a process of artistry with only those accidents which may happen anywhere and to anything. The sculptor is not work- ing by chance or in a random fashion or automatically. The stone will not turn into a statue "of its own ac- cord." To become a statue requires human interven- tion. But the sculptor intervenes as if he were taking the place of one of the natural factors in all change. If there were no popular or common sense meanings to the terms which are used in philosophy, that sub- ject would be even more opaque than it is. In taking the word, "nature," as the target for one of his inves- tigations, Aristotle is doing what we all do, that is, using a common word to express a technical idea and then refining the idea. In the Physics (Book II, chap- ter 1) Aristotle gives the denotation of the term. He begins by distinguishing between those things which "exist by nature" and in contrast to these, those "that exist from other causes." The former are animals and their parts, plants, and the four elements. The others are the things that are made by art, that is, by man. But the fundamental difference between the two types lies in natural things possessing within them- selves "the source of motion and rest, whether it be in reference to position, increase and diminution, or alteration" (Physics, 192 b 13). "Motion" and "rest" here are equivalent to "change" and "fixity." But now there is a change of emphasis and hence a shift in meaning. Nature, he continues (ibid., 192 b 21), is the source of the causes of motion and rest in that in which it exists primarily, in its own right and not acci- dentally. It has become hypostatized, as chance was, and is existentially different from that order which natural changes manifest. It is a source and a cause. It is no longer simply a name for all four causes lumped together or the name for a type of event. It is itself reified. Its presence or absence can thus be used to distinguish between two kinds of events, those which he will call natural and those which he will call unnatural. But what sort of thing among those which Aristotle has assumed to be irreducible or real can be identified with such sources and causes? Only matter and form (ibid., 193 a 10 and 193 a 28).2 For the efficient cause and the final cause will be the entelechy in living things. In non-living nothing more is needed than the inherent motions of the elements, and these are involved only when the elements-or of course com- pounds of them-are displaced. But the displacement of the elements is always attributable to some force or other and, if such forces were eradicated from the cosmic scene, all the elements would presumably be found in concentric spheres about the earth as a center. If this is so, then nature becomes simply matter and form conjoined in nonhuman events or, in the case of human beings, their birth, growth, and death, together with the procreation of other human beings, in so far as they do not let their reason change the course of their lives. For it is precisely the human reason which raises man above the level of the beasts in Aristotle's opinion and which-and this he does not seem to see-brings about all the irregularity which individual lives display. The biography of any in- dividual chosen at random would be almost indistin- guishable from that of any other individual if one consider only his vegetative and animal souls. It is obvious that with very minor differences we are all conceived, born, and reared, to say nothing of dying, in the same way, if we subtract from the manner in which these events take place the influence of the social customs and laws which vary them. It may well have been for this reason that such Cynics as Diogenes of Synope, who wished to live a life "in ac- cordance with nature," eliminated everything which art and science had introduced into human living. But for Aristotle the reason was, as we all know, the differentia of man and if one was going to absorb man into nature, then the reason could not be excluded as either accidental or unnatural. But it is also of the nature of man to be somehow unnatural. Almost all 2 For an illuminating analysis of these passages, see Cherniss, Presocratics, 242. 48 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="48">VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] philosophers, Pagan as well as Judeo-Christian, who have criticized the vagaries of desire, have seen in human history some moment at which men fell from the primordial natural state. And whether they ac- cepted the simple story of the Hesiodic Ages or that of Genesis, whether they interpreted one or the other allegorically or literally, they seemed agreed that the state of nature had a kind of simplicity about it which made generalizations easy. It is interesting to ob- serve how once man had fallen, diversity became more common than unity. This diversity may have consisted merely in setting boundaries to the fields, initiating the custom of private property, speaking different languages, the invention of money with sub- sequent variations in wealth, or injustices of other sorts depending on the special point of view of the critic. Oddly enough Aristotle followed none of these leads. On the contrary, when he came to discuss the role of reason in human affairs, he always gave it a beneficent task to perform. But here he was at odds with himself, for, if the rational animal were natural in the same manner in which everything else was na- tural, i.e., in having one matter and one form or in exhibiting in behavior the same four causes in a regular way, then there should have been no need for such advice as was given in the Ethics, the Politics, and the Poetics. The political animal, if he was nat- ural in the same sense that other things were, should have shown much more uniformity in his standards of behavior, his cities, and his works of art. This is all the more curious in that reason to Aristotle was a faculty which, wherever incorporated, would reach the same ends. Two men, if they reas- soned, ought never to disagree. Yet it was only too obvious that men did disagree and Aristotle could hardly have said that this was because too few of them were rational. He believed, to be sure, that natural slaves existed and they were not rational, but also it was not they who set the standard for humanity. Man, the wisest of the animals (De generatione ani- malium, 744 a 30), shows his wisdom by using it to control his lower nature. And I think that no argu- ment is required to show that the wise man, that is, the man who lives in accordance with reason, would be an exemplar for all men. In fact he is said to be the most natural of all bipeds (De incessu, 706 b 10). In other words, there are not several ways of being wise-or rational-and if man's nature lies in his essence and if his essence is his rational animality and if the natural is always uniform, only one conclusion is possible. In the Politics (1254 b 4) the results of the rule of reason are expounded. As the soul, he says, should rule over the body, so ought the reason to rule over impulse or desire. But what prevents its doing so? The reason, as natural, when in power would produce uniform results, whereas when the lower faculties take over, disorder and diversity re- sult. This is quite in line with Aristotle's theory of nature. But on the other hand, the instrument which historically has brought disorder into life is now called upon to eliminate it. I do not say, be it noted, that Aristotle himself charges the reason with having been the source of diversity; I am inferring on my own account that this must have been so if we accept Aristotle's psychology. For the irrational animals live in a uniform manner, each according to its kind. They follow nature or instinct, since after all they have no reason to follow.3 It might have been argued that a process of evolu- tion was going on, that there existed a natural hier- archy showing an increasing attempt to achieve unity, the rule of reason; that from minerals, through plants and animals, to man there was steady progress to- wards the rational and that the day would come when the cosmos as a whole and in all its parts would ex- hibit a picture of harmony and law. Aside from the fact that what we would call the minerals were more regular in their behavior than the animals and man, there was indeed in some parts of the corpus material on which such an inference might be made. But Aristotle did not make it. There is no hint on his part of anything resembling an elan vital which, unlike Bergson's, had a rational goal. The realm of chance was not gradually moving towards order at all; if it had been, it would not have been chance. It remained a realm of disorder, fundamentally unintelligible, and an evolutionistic interpretation of Aristotle would be a radical misinterpretation. The deviations from what "ought to be" as the product of accident were needed by him to symbolize, if nothing more, the actual disorder which he found in experience. Though men might be called upon to organize their lives ra- tionally, controlling their vegetative and sensitive souls, one could scarcely preach to the cosmos. The closest approach to an evolutionist cosmology is in his description of the relation of the Unmoved Mover to the spheres, but even there one finds no suggestion that the lower levels of being were striving to reach the higher. On the contrary, each sphere took care of itself. The Unmoved Mover, like everything else in Aristotle's cosmos, seemed quite content to be itself and not strive after anything more. We have then, if my interpretation of the relevant passages is correct, a view of nature which makes that term a name either for the four causes acting together or for matter and form in the process of realization. We have earlier in this book tried to show that it is also the name for the rational order of the cosmos as 3 In the eighteenth century in France this problem was again raised. Did the reason or the heart bring about the regnant disorder? Those whom later writers were to call Voltaireans blamed the heart, the emotions, the passions; the so-called Rousseauists, the reason. I have said something about this question in French philosophies of the Romantic Period, Baltimore, Johns Hopkins Press, 1925. But it will be recognized by those who know their history of philosophy as a continual source of debate. NATURE 49</page><page sequence="49">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE contrasted with the random order of the world of observation. But it must also be pointed out that it is a name for something behind or within the four causes or the process. The distinction is important if only to explain the occurrence of unnatural events. For if every change were natural, then nature would be responsible for the disorder as well as for the order and that presumably would have been intolerable. 2. NATURE AS PURPOSIVE There is also another idea about nature in Aristotle which personifies it still more, making it more like "Mother Nature" in popular speech. This appears in the famous slogan, "Nature does nothing in vain." This principle, there is perhaps no need of saying, is used as a premise over and over again, but it is far from being part of Aristotle's protophilosophy. On the contrary, he attempts to prove the purposiveness of nature in the Physics (Book II, chapter 8). Here his argument makes a primary distinction between events which occur because of necessity and those which are moving towards a goal. An example of a necessary happening, as contrasted with a purposive one, is rainfall. Zeus, he says (Physics, 198 b 18), causes the rain to fall not in order to help the crops but because when water is drawn upwards by evapora- tion, it is cooled, condensed, and then can do nothing but fall back to its natural position. The increase in the harvest is accidental. Similarly if the crops perish because of excessive dampness, one cannot say that the dampness was sent by Zeus in order to rot the grain; that unhappy event was also an accident. Why not then, like certain philosophers, maintain that everything happens without regard to any end? Before giving Aristotle's reply to this question, let us indicate what is involved here. (1) In this special case, purpose must be deliberate, conscious purpose, not a purpose achieved as a by-product of an event, (2) In introducing God, Aristotle emphasizes the an- thropomorphic side of purpose; this is not a case of a bird's building a nest without knowing what she is doing and yet doing it as a place in which to lay eggs and hatch them. (3) The result which either helps or hinders a human purpose is unusual, thus con- forming to the rule previously laid down that chance events are rare. (4) The event which seems to be purposive can nevertheless be explained on non-pur- posive grounds, thus seeming to follow the principle of parsimony: that is, since rainfall can be explained on the basis of physical law alone, there is no need to invoke teleology. To return now to our principal theme, Aristotle gives five reasons of his own why the theory which in the nineteenth century would have been called mech- anism is untenable. (1) Repeating the formula that natural events hap- pen always in the same way or for the most part, whereas chance events occur occasionally, he infers that natural events must be purposive. This argu- ment rests upon the premise that there are only two kinds of occurrences, purposive and what I shall call mechanistic. If natural events and unnatural events are identified respectively with regular and irregular events, and if the irregular events (which are acci- dental) are not purposive, then the natural events can be only purposive. This is a purely formal argu- ment, as one sees, but it contains at least one point of general interest: the identification of the purposive with the regular. This seems to me to be the very opposite of what we today would call purposive ac- tion. I imagine that we should be inclined to say that one can spot purposive action by the variety of means used to reach a given end. If a human being wishes-ta get to a certain point and finds his road blocked, he will try to go round the block, climb over the block, tunnel under it, or seek another path alto- gether. The dogged repetition of the same mode of behavior in the face of failure would not, unless I am quite wrong, be thought of as an example of teleology. Quite the contrary. We should call a man who be- haved like Fabre's famous dung beetle a poor machine. If the man were propelled from behind by forces im- pinging upon him as if by a billiard cue, he would be- have like the beetle. But to Aristotle the very reverse is true when he is speaking of nature. It is the regu- larity of events of the same kind which proves their purposiveness.4 If now one say that Aristotle does not maintain that every step in a process of actualization must be repeated in exactly the same manner each time the total act is repeated, that would be true; but it would also imply that purposiveness means merely that a given form is always actualized by a given kind of matter, that is, that eggs always turn into chickens and acorns into oaks, barring accidents. But that would be simply a restatement in somewhat new lan- guage of his primary assumption that all change moves from matter to form, which in the final analysis is the belief that natural sequences are orderly. Earth falls to the center, Fire rises to the periphery, vegetables nourish and reproduce themselves, men reason. But to distinguish between various degrees of regularity is scarcely to prove that some degrees are purposive and other not, except by fiat. But as a matter of fact, Aristotle's second argument, vague though it is, seems to suggest that the steps in a purposive process are all alike in each example of the process. (2) In whatsoever things there exists an end, there is a sequence [I take it that this sequence is temporal] from the prior to the later terms for the sake of this end. There- fore, as a thing is made, so it occurs naturally, and as things occur naturally, so is each thing made, unless some- thing prevents. But things are made in view of an end; and hence things occur naturally in view of an end. If, 4 For a detailed study of the justice of Aristotle's attack on the mechanists, see again Cherniss, Presocratics, 252. 50 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="50">VOL. 49. PT. 6, 1959] for instance, a house were among those things which come into being naturally, it would come into being as it now does from art. But if the things which occur in nature were not only produced by nature but also by art, they would be produced just as they now occur. The earlier steps in the process are for the sake of the later (Physics, 199 a 9). The congruence between the steps of an artistic or technical process and those of a natural process is assumed. Whether this is evidence that Greek artists and technicians were more ritualistic in their proced- ures and in choosing their subjects than ours, I do not know. But in all probability Aristotle is simply saying that, just as in artistry a form is put into matter and the matter shaped with a view to em- bodying the form, so in nature the seeds of living things always terminate in a given type of plant or animal or else perish. Moreover, the sequence of events from seed to plant is regular in that in each case of vegetable life the same steps are found in the same order, the seed swelling, dicotyledons, for ex- ample, next appearing, the seedling growing, flowers appearing, flowers going to seed, and the plant wither- ing. So in artistry, the sculptor takes his crude stone, begins chiseling away until he reaches a rough sem- blance of, again for example, a human body, more stone being chipped off, until finally the finished statue appears and is recognized as an Apollo. If artistry is admitted to be purposive, there would be no need to deny that natural processes also are pur- posive. The argument is analogical. Nature is imi- tating art, rather than art imitating nature. But again, if sculptors made only one or two kinds of statue, all looking alike, and made them all in the same way, would anyone see in the process anything whatsoever rising above the level of the bird building her nest, the spider spinning her web, or the bee making its hive? These activities too may be called purposive, in the sense that when the products are completed, they serve a purpose. But that is some- what different from deciding on an end and realizing that end by improvisation if necessary, in short by thinking. (3) Not only does nature imitate art, but art "com- pletes what nature is unable to bring to a conclusion" (ibid., 199 a 15). This is as if Fabre helped his beetle over the obstacle which he had erected to see whether the beetle were more than Sisyphus. In both nature and art the prior is for the sake of the posterior. The intervention of art into natural processes could apply only to human affairs, such as the restoration of health to a sick man, agriculture, engineering, and the like. The word "nature" here is no longer the cosmos as a whole, for surely Aristotle could not believe that in the non-human world there were cases where nature was unable to bring to completion a natural process. Presumably education, like artistry, can supply the deficiencies of nature (Politics, 1337 a 1) and, if it is called upon to do so, it must be because such defici- encies exist. This does not prevent his saying in the Nichomachean Ethics (1106 b 14) that as virtue is better and more exact than any art, so is nature. But it is impossible to eradicate all such inconsistencies. Aristotle here is merely trying to make the analogy between artistry and natural processes a bit closer, and if artistry can actually bring to a successful con- clusion the incompleted acts of nature, that must be because there is no disharmony between their two methods. If one wished to pursue the matter further, the problem would have to be faced of the identification of incompleted natural processes. One would first of course make a survey of what types of things happened "on the whole," and call them natural. Each type would be seen to have its peculiar beginning and end. If then one found a process the beginning of which led one to think that its end would be of such and such a sort and if one observed that its end was not as pre- dicted, one could conclude that it was an incomplete process. But this would assume that nature "ought" to be regular and if it turned out not to be regular, some explanation would have to be sought. The ex- planation in Aristotle is, as we may have seen, the intervention of chance. If, to take a simple example, it is assumed that all babies "ought" to grow up and live to the age of three score and ten, after which they would decline and die, and if a child is found who dies at the age of eight, one can say, if one wishes, that a natural process has not been completed. If medicine can prolong a life which looks as if it were to be soon terminated, one can also say that art has completed what nature was unable to do. But two other things at least might be said: (1) that dying before seventy is also explicable on natural grounds since the victim must be integrated into a series of events which include the absorption into his system of a certain poison, let us say, which is known to be fatal; and (2) that the order of na- ture is far from uniform and things of various kinds hap- pen to occur. The first of these assumptions is methodo- logical and demands a kind of analysis of natural events which goes below the surface of common-sense observation. Ovum to man to death is good enough if all one wants is a very rough generalization. Its very superficiality makes it safe from attack. But such threads of history are too thin for scientific use and must be recognized as getting entangled with scores of other threads before any such gross process is completed. The second would make it difficult, if not impossible, to infer purposiveness from natural processes, especially if the differentia of both purpose and nature were regularity. Statistics alone could help and Aristotle can scarcely be blamed for not hav- ing anticipated statistics. Yet such points might be taken seriously by those philosophers who think we can "go back to Aristotle." (4) At this point Aristotle introduces as a differentia NATURE 51</page><page sequence="51">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE of the natural the absence of "art, research, or deliber- ate planning" (TerxvY oVTre irTacirarTa ovIre 3ovXevoaiueva). The animals and even the plants do things which "are useful for an end" (Physics, 199 a 24) Spiders spin webs and ants have a kind of state and even plants produce leaves to shelter their fruit. But this kind of thing cannot be the result of intelligence (nous) and Aristotle concludes that they come about by nature. The best one can do to find an English substitute for "nature" in this place is the old-fashioned word "in- stinct." The contrast is that between innate and acquired traits, between instinct and learning, a con- trast such as appears in the proverb, "Poets are born and not made."5 In men who preferred things called natural to things which are called artificial, great admiration is expressed for the products of instinct and indeed the animals, who are supposed to be more natural then man, become exemplars for men to follow. Whether this arose because of an admiration for any- thing called natural or whether people called what they admired natural, I have no way of knowing. Men may differ in this respect. Aristotle, when he speaks of the spider, the ant, and the swallow, though he uses examples common to all writers who admire the beasts, does not draw the conclusion that we ought to live like them. His purpose is to prove that one can find teleology where there is no conscious seeking of an end and that it is therefore possible-but he says it is true-that all natural processes are purposive. But if this is so, then why cannot one conclude that Zeus does send the rain in order to make the crops grow? If conscious deliberation is not required to define the purposive, then we must conclude that the one differentia left is regularity of occurrence. But this would pertain to any mechanical series of events just as well as to those in which purpose is recognizable. (5) His final proof is dogmatic. "Since," he says (ibid., 199 a 30), "nature is twofold, on the one hand matter and on the other form, and this (form) is the end, and the other things exist for the sake of the end, this would be a cause and that for the sake of which the others exist." It is of course the final cause. If the form is the purpose of the matter and all things are composed of matter and form, then clearly all things have a purpose. This is demonstration by definition. But an opponent might very well ask, "How can a thing which does not achieve its purpose be said to have one, except on the analogy of human failures?" That is, we know that sometimes we have purposes and are unable to carry them out; are in- complete processes in the non-human world the same? If so, then how does one determine what the purpose 6 For the depreciation of learning in classical antiquity, see Theognis, 429-438; Pindar, Nem. III, 40; Pyth. VIII, 44; 01.XIII, 13. Cf. Lovejoy and Boas, Primitivism in antiquity, 196 n. 8. Those who may be curious about the future history of this idea will find one of its ramifications in my The happy beast, Baltimore, Johns Hopkins Press, 1933. of non-conscious things is? The answer would prob- ably be, "By taking the usual outcome of the process as its purpose." But this proof is circular and need not detain us longer. A distinction must again be made between those ends which are purposes in the sense of their being obviously of some good to that of which they are the ends and those which are simply termini. It is easy to see that the nest of the swallow and the web of the spider are ends in the first sense; the creatures in question utilize them. They are not themselves the termini of acts in the same way as a chicken is the terminus of the egg's development. They are useful as means to other ends. But of what use is the chicken to the egg? Of what use is the upward mo- tion of Fire to Fire? This somewhat vulgar question may exasperate the philosopher who insists that some things are just ends, have terminal value, are good-in- themselves. Granted that there are some ends which justify all action, the distinction must still be made between those instruments which animals use and the dogged persistence of a course of action which is there- upon labeled good-in-itself. This is not the place to trace the rise of terminal values out of instrumental, but it may be well to point out that except in the case of human beings, we have no way of knowing what is the end of anything or how to determine it. When we say that the spider spins her web to catch flies, we are probably right, but we are nevertheless reading into the spider's behavior a motive such as that which we would have, if we spun webs. But when we move beyond the organic kingdoms into the inorganic, the sole evidence which Aristotle can provide for teleology is the regularity of certain changes. In such a piece of literature as the Hymn to Zeus of Cleanthes, this kind of regularity is thought of as a result of the de- crees of a supernatural lawgiver. But Aristotle is not so anthropomorphic as that. The general laws which are exemplified in the behavior of the kinds of things in the cosmos make up the Form of the World. His famous metaphor of the Unmoved Mover as the be- loved who attracts the lover serves merely to show that here is a kind of action which does not require change in the agent. That this order is good-in-itself is simply one of his assumptions. But to whom is it good? Not to the Unmoved Mover, for he lacks nothing and hence wants nothing and cannot be moved to pleasure or pain. This is the standard example of autarky, self-suffici- ency. In the Philebus (60 B) we find Socrates saying that the being who possesses perfect goodness is never in need of anything and is perfectly self-sufficient. And we learn that Antisthenes held a similar theory of the highest good, though we learn it from a usually poorly informed source, Diogenes Laertius (Book VI, 11). Indeed it was a common mark of the finis bonorum, being expressed not only by the philosophers mentioned, but also by Epicureans and Stoics. To 52 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="52">VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] reach a point of self-sufficiency, however, would be impossible this side of the Whole. For there is no need of expatiating upon the interdependence of all beings within the Whole. In so far as nature is iden- tical with the cosmic order, it is self-sufficient arid to follow nature or to live in accordance with nature would be equivalent to being as self-sufficient as pos- sible. One could discover in human life a parallel to the natural order in the operation of the active reason and a similar parallel to the realm of chance in the doings of man's lower nature. But no one could say that the end of the cosmos was self-sufficiency for the simple reason that it already possesses it. Even to say that its end is self-maintenance is absurd, since it is self-maintaining anyway. The Unmoved Mover continually thinks about thinking; the planetary in- telligences keep on moving their planets in circles; the elements move to their natural positions; and matter keeps actualizing its potential forms. This is the ever- lasting picture of the Whole. Hence when Aristotle speaks of natural teleology, one cannot be sure in just what sense of "natural" he is using that adjective. All we know is that, whatever he meant by it, he thought that he had proved that purposive action was natural and that one did not need deliberation to attain natural ends. We can also be fairly certain that he believed the highest good to be self-sufficiency. "Self-sufficiency" is defined in the Politics, Book VII, chapter 5, as having all things and wanting nothing. Shortly before this passage (1326 b 3) we are told that the state ought to be self-sufficient. But even earlier (1253 a 1) Aristotle had said that self- sufficiency is the end and the best; it is the end of the state, its final cause. He uses this assumption in Book II, chapter 2, to prove that the state must not be so unified that it be reduced to families or individ- uals, for they are more dependent on others than a composite state would be. But self-sufficiency cannot be the goal of the individual, for if the individual were to make himself self-sufficient, as Diogenes did, he would become a-social and man is by nature a social animal. Therefore his purpose would seem to be, at least in the Politics, a successful adjustment to the social organization as Aristotle describes it. For since, as he says (Politics, 1288 a 26), the whole is superior to the part, and therefore the king who stands for the whole is superior to his subjects, a man, one might think, ought to consider his highest duty to be that of being a good citizen. This becomes the more plausible in that he thinks the city to exist not merely for life but for the good life (inter alia, Politics, 1252 b 29; 1278 b 16), as the good life is outlined in the Nicho- machean Ethics. But if the good life can be achieved only in society, then it becomes doubtful whether the good man is any more self-sufficient than the bad man. For in the analogy to a well-governed state which is given in De motu animalium (703 a 30), we see that "there is no need for a separate monarch for each act which takes place, but each man does his task as has been ordered, and one thing follows another according to habit." Aristotle here is clearly thinking of a monarchy, for he gives to the soul of each animal a special residence from which it can govern the parts of the body, much as in De mundo God governs unseen from within His palace. The similarity of this to the Stoic conception of the universe as a great animal is irresistible,6 and if the similarity is as great as I think it is, then in Aristotle, as in the Stoics, there was a paradoxical strain according to which the highest good was self-sufficiency and yet it was to be attained only by taking one's place in a larger whole where one could not be self-sufficient. In the Stoics an apathetic res- ignation to the fulfillment of one's role took the place of self-sufficiency. In Aristotle the only substitute was happiness as described in the Ethics. In the con- clusion of the Nichomachean Ethics it is clear that he had planned the Politics as a sequel which would show the kind of state which alone would make happiness possible.7 But I find no recognition on Aristotle's part of this paradox. If the end or final cause of a thing is iden- tical with its essence in natural events, then the final cause of man would be the exercise of rational ani- mality. This would imply that there is no special end for individuals, but on the contrary each individ- ual must try to achieve the end of his species. But since neither children, nor the mentally deficient, nor natural slaves are rational animals-and only children out of the three groups have the possibility of becom- ing rational-a distinction must be made between an- thropoids and real men. The famous description of happiness in the Nichomachean Ethics (Book X, chap- ters 6, 7, and 8) gives us no hint of the need of a virtuous man's fulfilling any social duties whatsoever. Happiness is an activity, has terminal rather than instrumental value, and is self-sufficient (Chapter 6). It is the contemplation of the truth, which may be enjoyed by the philosopher even when by himself (KaL KaO' aborv ebv, ibid., 1177 a 33). In short, in so far as happiness is attainable, a man has no need of anyone or anything beyond himself. The happy man, as Aristotle says (ibid., 1177 b 21), self-sufficient, at lei- sure, and unwearied is in a state which seems to be beyond the reach of most of us, and Aristotle agrees. But in his agreement he says something which seems to reject the very bases of the argument which estab- lished happiness as our end and highest good. For he says (ibid., 1177 b 26) that it is not as a man that he should live such a life but "in so far as there is something divine in him." Nor is this just a casual 6 In fact, Farquharson in his translation of De motu (in the Oxford translation) gives the appropriate references to the Stoics and points out how the simile is worked out in De mundo. It is thus more obvious than I thought when writing the body of my text. 7 It is interesting that this is not so at the end of the Eudemian ethics. NATURE 53</page><page sequence="53">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE use of the word "divine" as a term of high praise. "We must not," he says, "take the advice of those who say that we must think of human beings because we are human beings and of mortal things because we are mortal, but in so far as we can, we should be im- mortal and do all things in life in accordance with the sovereign power within us." This power is the con- templative reason, which lifts us out of the temporal world of chance, sensation, imperfection, perversion, into the eternal world of logic. In its purest form it is the life of the gods and we approach it when we have most likeness to the gods (ibid., 1178 b 25). At this point Aristotle, as if suddenly aware of his switch in attitude, returns to his primary argument, saying that reason is the differentia of man and really is identical with the human essence and that on that basis alone should be recognized as his highest goal. But it is a goal which is not completely attainable on this earth, with the result that man of all creatures cannot ac- tualize his form. Such a position could turn into a kind of romantic striving for striving's sake, knowing that the end will never be reached. But Aristotle is no Fichte. Man, ironically enough, thus seems to be the most unnatural of beings from the base of the four elements to the Unmoved Mover. I am aware that ethics in Aristotle's opinion is not an exact science and the un- naturalness of man would explain why, though it would not explain it in Aristotelian terms. Nor am I saying that the goal which he sets for man is ignoble. I am simply pointing out that it is discordant with the assumptions upon which he erects his theory. In the case of everything else with which he deals he assigns ends which are inherent in the matters con- cerned. That which is natural is that which is the rule. But when it is a question of mankind, though the end is the essence, the achievement of the end is seldom, if ever, reached. If now we turned the con- ception around and began by asserting that what occurs on the whole reveals the natural, man's nature would be precisely to fail in the realization of his potencies. Nor is this merely a minor blemish in the ethics. On the contrary, it causes his whole theory of values to totter. And what is more, after pointing out that man's goal is unattainable this side of heaven, he goes on to say that a man will also require wealth and a healthy body and food and other necessary services. This is without doubt true. But surely these are not things which are needed by a self-suffi- cient person except to the extent that they make it possible for him to liberate his reason. Their objects may not be part of the human essence, but they are ancillary to the realization of that essence. That being so, one is forced to return to the psychological treatises and remember that man is not only a reason but a reason incorporated in an animal body. Fur- thermore, if forms do not exist apart from their ap- propriate matter, then one should understand at the outset that the reason cannot exist apart from the body and the lower levels of the soul. One could then argue that the realization of man's essence was the realization of rational animality, not merely of reason. Aristotle in fact would appear to recognize the inter- dependence of the various psychic faculties when he says that no man can attain perfect happiness. But in that case, might it not have been more reasonable for him to maintain that the end of man was not per- fect happiness but something which he condemns, namely something purely human and mortal? With- out intending to labor the point, I must recall that in the Metaphysics (1015 a 13) he had said-or at any rate the ancient editors have so arranged things that he says this first8-that "Nature in the primary and strict meaning of the word is the essence of things which have a source of movement (or change) in themselves as such." If the end of all things is the realization of their essences and if "to be in accordance with nature" is to realize one's essence, then it be- comes stranger than ever that man's purpose in life is to go beyond his essence.9 Our purpose in this section has not been merely to show the various meanings which the word "nature" had in Aristotle, but also to indicate if possible why such ambiguities were not eliminated. Anyone read- ing such a work as the Metaphysics will have noticed the importance which its author puts upon the way in which terms are used, as well as upon common opinion. He never, to the best of my knowledge, simply announces how he intends to use a term, giving a nominal definition, but on the contrary assumes that words have real meanings somehow or other implicit in them. The various ways in which a word is used seem to him to adumbrate if not one fundamental meaning, at least no more than one or two. That is why he can speak of the "strict sense" of a word. But he also wishes to be supported by the wisdom of the past. In the passage which we have quoted on hap- 8 I insert the parenthesis because of disputes about the chron- ology of Aristotle's writings. For Jaeger, Delta was later than anything in the Physics except Book VIII and was known as an independent work in Alexandrian times. See his Aristotle, English Translation, 169, 2d ed., Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1948. 9 A critic who has read this book in manuscript remarks that I "seem to overstate Aristotle's position, which is precisely that 'there is something divine in man' (1177 b 27) which is thus part of his essence." Need it be pointed out that the conclusion does not follow? The essence of a class of things is given in its definition and there is no definition of "man" in Aristotle which includes his resemblance to divinity. There is something vegetable and something animal also in man, but by making man a rational animal, Aristotle clearly included in man's essence his vegetative and animal natures. Moreover, it should be clear that I have been using rational animality as Aristotle's definition of "man"; that I have accepted Aristotle's equation of the definition with the essence; and that my argument is based exclusively on that and not on other comments which Aristotle makes about mankind. Finally, if man's resemblance to the divine is also part of his essence, then a new complication which amounts to inconsistency has been introduced into our author. 54 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="54">VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] piness, he seems glad to point out that "the opinion of the sages" agrees with his reasoning (Nichomachean Ethics, 1179 a 17). He is always happy to bring in a quotation from the poets and to treat their opinions seriously, especially when he agrees with them. It is his philosophic predecessors whom he takes to task, not common opinion. The opening of the Topics, after pointing out that some premises are self-evi- dently true, goes on to say that some premises are opinions which are generally accepted. Such gen- erally accepted opinions are held "either by all men or by the wise (i.e., the philosophers), and by such either as a whole or for the most part or by those specially well known or generally esteemed." But this tendency on his part must not be exaggerated.'o 10 Eucken makes a good bit of this in his admirable Die Methode der Aristotelischen Forschung, uisw., already cited. "So finden wir," he says (p. 4), "denn bei A. mehrfach Versuche die Mythen in Sinne seiner Philosophie zu erklaeren, er legt ausdruecklich Werth darauf, dass seine Aussichten mit ihren uebereinstimmen." This is probably true if mehrfach is not exaggerated. It is also true, as Eucken says later (p. 18), that Aristotle did not cut himself off from the popular tradition, as he maintains that Bacon and Spinoza did, citing the opening of the De intellectus emendatione to support his view: "Postquam me experientia docuit, omnia quae in communi vita frequenter occurrunt, vana et futilia esse." On the other hand one can find passages in Aristotle, such as Politics, 1268 b, in which he wants to show that legal reform is a good thing and in which he calls the ancient customs simple and barbarous and the remains of the old laws absurd, concluding that the primaeval men were no better than ordinary and simple-minded folk of his own times. Sometimes, as in Physics, 191 a 24, he says flatly that the first scientists were wrong, not because of their rudimentary culture, but because of their lack of experience. Again, as in De anima, 427 a 21, and Meteorologica, 353 a 34, he does not hesitate to disagree with the Ancients on the ground of their faulty premises; elsewhere, as in De partibus animalium, 640 b 5, he maintains that they were half right; and sometimes, as in Metaphysics, 1069 a 25, he thinks that they were more right than the generation which followed them. Sometimes, as in De caelo, 310 b 1, and De generatione animalium, 716 a 16, he tries to reinterpret their dicta so as to make what seems better sense to him. And some- times he cites not the opinions of the Ancients or those of the mythographers, but "commonly accepted opinion," as in Topics, 119 a 38 and 108 b 12; De caelo, 303 a 19; and, if one accepts the Rhetoric to Alexander as genuine, on page 1430 a 23. It is true that he believes in the frequent recurrence of ideas; in fact he says in De caelo, 270 b 19, that the same opinions or doctrines have been discovered "times without number," and in Physics, 196 a 8, as in Politics, 1264 a 3, he utilizes the assumption that all things which are worth while have been already discovered to infer that novelties are hardly worthy of serious consideration. It is also true that one can find passages in which he treats the myths as allegories, for instance, Metaphysics, 1074 b, where he gives an interpretation of the ancient belief that the stars were gods. But I see no overt statement that there has been an eternal recurrence of ideas. Bidez in his Un singulier naufrage litteraire dans l'antiquite, 32 (misprinted as 22), Bruxelles, 1943, says that the first book of De philosophia developed Aristotle's conception of the eternal recurrence of man's doctrines. I have found no evidence of this in the fragments usually attributed to that lost work, though its author does mention the views of earlier philosophers. But that was common practice throughout the corpus and certainly no proof of eternal recurrence. One might interpret him rather as saying that theie is a struggle for existence amongst ideas and a survival of the fittest; as he says 3. NATURE AS GOOD Nature has another characteristic to which we shall now turn. It is the model of goodness. One of the simplest and clearest statements of the goodness of nature is found in De caelo (288 a 2): Nature always does the best possible thing. The best possible thing in this passage is movement in a spatial direction. Having laid down the absoluteness of di- rections (ibid., Book II, chapter 2) and the superiority of up to down, right to left, and front to back, Aristotle concludes that the heavens must have the better di- rections. For the heavens are without question per- fect exemplifications of the natural. In a passage of this sort Aristotle is thinking of nature in the sense of the cosmic scene without living beings. And if the goodness of certain directions is taken over from the Pythagorean Table of Opposites which lists only very general terms, then we have to reconcile this with the assumption in De caelo (286 a 23), "If one of the opposites is natural, the other must be natural too." Aristotle uses this assumption to prove that, if Earth exists, Fire must also exist, since Fire is the opposite of Earth. This would seem to imply that, if goodness is natural, then evil must be equally natural; if the One is natural, so must the Many be. The bad quali- ties then-unless they are privations-must be as natural as the good. Moreover, Fire, we must re- member, is somehow more real than the other ele- ments. It is that element which corresponds to form while Earth corresponds to matter, being respectively the absolutely light and the absolutely heavy (De caelo, Book IV, chapter 4). Form is better than matter and, if both contraries are natural, then evil again is as natural as good and we cannot explain it away as simple privation. We thus find that there is an irremediable confusion here: an equation be- tween the natural and the good, between the unnatural and the bad; an assertion that both opposites are natural if one is; another assertion that in some cases one opposite is bad and the other good. Moreover, we have also the theory expressed in the Nichomachean Ethics and elsewhere that, regardless of the natural- ness of two opposites, both can be bad and only the mean between them good. Though there is an extended discussion of the na- ture of goods in the Nichomachean Ethics (1096 a 11) and the Rhetoric (1362 a 15), the presentation of the problem most useful for our present purposes occurs in the Politics. For in that treatise are to be found several presuppositions which clearly assert the ex- in Rhetoric, 1355 a 20, "In the natural course of events the true and the just are stronger than their opposites." It is also pos- sible that in view of his belief in the eternity of the world, he may also have believed in the constant repetition of kinds of things, so as to avoid an infinity of kinds. My own conclusion is the Scotch verdict, for there is evidence both for a belief in a consensus gentium, and other ideas usually associated with that, and against one. NATURE 55</page><page sequence="55">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE istence of non-human goods resident in the natural order whose value is independent of human valuation. The following would seem to be the most important. (1) The superiority of the final cause and end of a thing (Politics, 1252 b 34; cf. Metaphysics, 982 a 14). (2) The superiority of the self-sufficient (1253 a 1). (3) The superiority of the whole to the part (1288 a 26). (4) The evil of things which are contrary to nature (1325 b 9). (5) The goodness of the mean (1295 b 3). If the natural is the purposive and the unnatural the random, then the first of these assumptions becomes clearer, for purpose always strives for an end and the end is the final cause. The fourth assumption, that the unnatural is evil, implies that the random would be evil, especially if the purposeless is the unnatural. So in Politics, 1323 b 27, Aristotle argues that external goods which come "of themselves" and by chance are inferior to happiness and, later in the same treatise (1332 a 30) it appears, as we have seen it appear in the Physics, that the alternatives to chance are knowl- edge and purpose. In accordance with this principle, that chance is worse than the purposive, he maintains (1252 a 31) that "that which can foresee by the exer- cise of the mind is by nature intended to be lord and master." The only logical process in Aristotle's writ- ings by means of which one can foresee anything is bound up with the linkage of classes. Thus one can predict that, if a present member of a species has certain characteristics, then any future members of that species will have them too and so will any mem- bers of sub-species. This by the dictum de omni et nullo. For it goes without saying that the character- istics of the more inclusive classes are shared by the members of the included classes. But it is also true that the characteristics of the species, like those of the genera, are the final cause of the members of the species. Consequently, in the Nichomachean Ethics, when Aristotle is discussing the end of man, he points out first the differentiae of man which will alone de- termine the final good of all men. The problem of the man who would be virtuous becomes the problem of realizing his human-not his personal-character, that which he shares with all men and which neither unnatural, perverted, immature men nor animals nor plants can manifest nor can they in the nature of things attain. If my reasoning is correct, then numbers 1, 2, 3, and 4 can be absorbed into the one assumption, The good is the natural, where "natural" will mean, "that which is in accordance with the logical order." But this principle would not account for whatever goodness there may be on the left-hand side of the Pythagorean table or for the fifth of our assumptions of value, the goodness of the mean. Aristotle probably took over the idea that the mean is better than either extreme from proverbial philos- ophy. He uses related standards, excessive size, sym- metry, regularity, in quasi-aesthetic discussions: e.g., political revolutions spring from a disproportionate increase in any part of the state (Politics, 1302 b 34); extreme democracy and oligarchy are self-destructive (1309 b 23); it is necessary to limit the size of a popu- lation (1326 a 31); cities must be planned (1330 b 22). That the mean is more natural than the extremes could not be proved, for the Aristotelian logic with its law of excluded middle would seem to preclude the natural existence of means. In general means are found only in the ethical and political treatises, though there are hints of others in, for instance, De generatione et corruptione, (318 b 27), where Water and Air, are held to be more real than Earth and less real than Fire, and of course there are the zoophytes which come between plants and animals. Yet even in the Nichomachean Ethics (1104 a 10), the mean is intro- duced almost with an apology. Good behavior, to be sure, is a kind of art; it is not instinctive. And con- sequently the value of the mean might be more properly considered as pertaining to artificial rather than to natural change. It is impossible, it would seem, to make the doctrine harmonious with the theory of opposites, in so far as one is the privation of the other. Let us suppose that we have identified the good with the natural and postpone other criteria of value for the time being. This identification is overtly used by Aristotle on several occasions. Thus he argues from the rightness of the natural to there being some justi- fication for self-love (Politics, 1263 a 40). Second, he was to infer from the self-sufficiency of the state and the dependence of the individual the greater natural- ness of the state and its priority to the individual (ibid., 1253 a 25). In the third place, he could prove that tyranny, oligarchy, and democracy were bad be- cause they were perverted and unnatural forms of government (ibid., 1287 b 39). At the same time it must be said that he is far from consistent. In Poli- tics, Book I, chapter 6 (1255 b 3) he says that nature does not always accomplish its purposes and later (1259 b 1) he grants, as he had elsewhere, that there are exceptions to the order of nature. This is simply an admission of chance in the sphere of political phi- losophy, analogous to that which occurs in the field of natural science. Again, when he is discussing the three things which make men good and virtuous, he points out clearly that nature is not enough (ibid., 1332 a 38). In fact, in at least one place he reasons that "men do many things contrary to habit and na- ture, if they should be persuaded by their reason that it is better to do otherwise" (ibid., 1332 b 6). But how reason could persuade anyone to do something contrary to nature is left obscure. The sentence fol- lows almost immediately upon his saying, as men- 56 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="56">VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] tioned above, that there are three things which make men good and virtuous, nature, habit, and reason. Man's superiority to the beasts lies in his ability to guide himself by reason rather than relying exclu- sively on nature and habit. But here he means by "nature" the specific innate psychological equipment of the individual, what might loosely be called an individual's instinctive feelings, and not human na- ture in general. It is possible for a man's personal nature to be in conflict with human nature and yet for him to be rational and to pursue human rather than personal ends. There is no inconsistency in be- lieving that there is a conflict between individual character and human nature as a whole; it is similar to that between nature and chance. What requires explanation is the apparent contradiction between an individual's being able to control his own nature and orient it in the path of reason-nature in the larger sense-when it is innately set upon a diverging path. Moreover, if each man has his own nature which may be in conflict with the general order of nature or with human nature as a whole, should not the potentialities of such conflict be an integral part of human nature or should not one revise his conception of the possi- bility of abstracting homogeneous class-concepts from a mass of radically different things? If one say that the universal, Humanity, is characterized by inner conflict, real diversity, then what possibility is there of skimming off a supposititious similarity which will be the universal? For in Aristotle's thought, it should not be forgotten, the universals are precisely the resid- ual identities existing amongst individuals when their differences are subtracted. I hope to have shown that in his normative, as in his descriptive, concepts the two ideas of nature are discordant: nature as a system of fixed species in which the principle of excluded middle rigidly ob- tains, and chance as a realm of disorder. Man's ethi- cal problem is to make his life, which is partly lived in the latter realm, approximate the standards of the former. When the former concept is confused with a second picture of nature as a series of levels between which there is progress from matter to form, there is no means of reconciling the two. But alongside of these difficulties lies another. This difficulty is in- herent in any theory which (a) believes nature to be uniform and (b) absorbs man into the natural order and (c) infers that he ought to be what he is not. In Aristotle man is to be sure in one sense part of the natural order. But why, if nature is uniform, is he not what he naturally is? In other words, how can he fail to realize his essence? The answer to this problem is, one supposes, the interference of chance in things this side of the moon. But that is little more than admitting the existence of irregularity and pretending to explain it by naming it. Aristotle's tolerance for irregularity is all the more surprising since whenever he gets an opportunity to speak of the uniformity of nature he does so, even when he is not engaged in natural science. In the De interpretatione (16 a 5), for instance, he points out that, though men have different languages and forms of writing, yet the mental states "which these symbolize" are the same for all, as are the things for which they stand. How different was the approach of his pupil Theophrastus who turns the matter about in the opening of his Characters and asks how it happens that "we Greeks," who speak the same language and have about the same education, should yet be so different. The duality between things and their images in experience and between ideas and their subject-matter is one which might be accepted by anyone. But the em- phasis in the passage from De interpretatione is on the unity and permanence of the mental states and that to which they correspond in the objective world. All men in reality have minds which are alike, but in appearance their identity is concealed behind a screen of difference, in this case the words and images which they use. But why, one asks, if people are so uniform, should they use such different symbols to express iden- tical thoughts? And why should the objects of ex- perience, which are individually unchanging in reality, enter our experience in diversified images? The iden- tity as well as the differences is qualitative, not ex- istential, for Aristotle was not maintaining that all minds form one mind or that all objects fuse into one. The substratum, which cannot be perceived, is exis- tentially cut up by spatial positions, but that is not in question here. What is in question is the qualita- tive diversification of that which is supposed to be homogeneous. This diversification is not explained by Aristotle but is simply accepted as a basic fact. It is accepted as the world of chance is accepted. Nevertheless, just as in physics Aristotle believes that he can discover uniform laws which reveal the natural, not the fortuitous, so even in biology where diversi- fication is more striking than uniformity, he insists that "we have to consider nature as that which exists universally or for the most part" (De partibus animal- ium, 663 b 28). No scientist in his right mind would disagree, but in addition he would add that we must also consider to what degree variety exists and under what conditions. Aristotle by using a formula such as this one thinks he has the right to neglect a certain amount of diversity, but he nowhere tells one how much one can neglect. The nature which exists universally or on the whole is not supposed to lie hidden behind the scenes when he is dealing with physics or biology, but is exemplified on the level of observation. He is not talking about "animality" or "vegetality," as he might in De anima, but about the way flesh and blood animals subject to, human inspection behave and are constituted. But human inspection is perception, as is obvious, not logic, and, whatever irregularities are discovered, they are discovered this side of "reality" or "nature," that NATURE 57</page><page sequence="57">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE is, they are found in the world of appearance or chance. But in that world one must be resigned to opinion at best, for it is here, not in the order of nature, that monsters, perversions, and unnatural events occur. Hence at times we find him setting up three realms of being: nature as a system of logical order, chance which is unknowable but observable, and between them, so to speak, orderly and fairly uniform regu- larities. It is likely that he thought the third to be susceptible of logical manipulations, for even when he is dealing with what he admits to be the subject- matter of an inexact science, he nevertheless formu- lates general principles from which he deduces certain logical consequences. If in the Politics (1259 b 1) he observes that "unless something happens contrary to nature, the male dominates the female," and the old the young, yet he deduces from this-and does not observe-a form of government for the household on the premise that what is natural should become a rule of action.11 He thus moves from factual observation to the erection of rules for reform, or, in the language of the schools, from fact to value. Since nature as the logical order is always a standard of goodness, then that image of the natural which is seen in regular se- quences becomes also a standard of goodness. But the realm of disorder, being evil, must be brought back to the point at which it most closely approximates nature. The direction of reform, let us say, is always to- wards order, towards nature, and it requires but a brief survey of some of his assumptions concerning value to see this. Since nature is purposive as well as logical, we find his assumptions about value most clearly when he is speaking of natural teleology. Thus he declares that when nature achieves her pur- poses, she always follows the best course (De caelo, 288 a 2); that nothing contrary to nature is good (Politics, 1325 b 9); that nature is better and more exact than any art (Nichomachean Ethics, 1106 b 14). These three statements are used to prove respectively (1) that the heavens follow a circular path, though here he shows some hesitation; (2) that the rule of a really virtuous and wise man ought to be obeyed, since to follow virtue and wisdom is natural; (3) that virtue must aim at the mean, just as good artists do, avoiding excess and defect. The first and third of these premises are aesthetic in their connotation and are proposed as self-evident truths. No reason is given in De caelo why circularity is better than any other shape, though in the Metaphysics (1016 b 16) he tries to justify his belief in the superiority of circu- larity by pointing to its "unity." But unity is simply another ultimate term and its superiority to multi- plicity is never argued for. The superiority of the circular is posited along with that of the upper regions of the world and forward movement, as if it were part 11 Cf. Saint Paul, Ephesians 5: 22. of general knowledge, knowledge which may be pre- served in our English use of "superior" for "better." The second premise also had become by Aristotle's time a bit of popular philosophy, so that it was of little importance just what precise meaning the word "nature" had. For when one accepts proverbial wis- dom, it seems to require no analysis. If it did, one would not accept it. Its very vagueness adds to its plausibility. The goodness of the logical order, in which the achievement of purpose could at a minimum be pre- dicted, appears in an argument in the Politics (1323 b 27), in which the equating of this type of order with nature is indubitable: Things which come by chance are not so good as things which come from knowledge and purpose. For this reason external goods, which come by chance, are worse than happiness which, ac- cording to the Nichomachean Ethics (1099 b 20), comes from study. Therefore, neither animals nor children can be happy. Aristotle is willing to accept any bless- ings which come his way, but he insists (Politics, 1332 a 31) that virtue and goodness in the state are not a matter of chance but the result of knowledge and de- liberate purpose, which sets up a parallel between the good man, that is the happy man, and the good state. It is not hard to understand why this should be so. If virtue is an end, the final cause of something, it fits into the natural order and the technique of dis- covering the end of man is to discover his "natural" final cause. Since the only way of knowing the na- tural order is through the reason, the only way of pursuing virtue would be first to learn its character through rational inquiry. The intellectualistic slant of Aristotle's ethical thinking is an old story which needs no retelling, but it sometimes makes its presence felt in unsuspected ways. Thus when he is discussing slavery, he points out the uselessness of studying cor- ruptions: we can find the intentions of nature only "in things which are natural" (Politics, 1254 a 36), or, as Jowett translates the passage, "in things which retain their natures," not in things which are being cor- rupted. But it is clear that such things could bediscov- ered only by rationalistic rather than empirical methods. And these methods could at best show one simply the logical genera of things. From that knowledge one might deduce the purposes of the various members of the genera, but not whether any such genera were actually existent on earth. Hence nature's intentions might, as a matter of fact, never be met with in cor- poreal form. It must not be forgotten that Aristotle himself seldom uses the rationalistic technique of dis- covering what is according to nature and what not. He seems to know the natural "instinctively," or at any rate he states flatly what is and what is not na- tural, as if no problem was involved in detecting them. For instance, in the passage just referred to we learn that the rule of the soul over the body and of the in- tellect over the appetites is natural; that tame animals 58 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="58">VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] are superior to wild animals; that men are superior to women. Whether he saw that any methodological problems were involved in the formation of such opinions we have no way of knowing, but he is so convinced of their truth that he is willing to say that "nature wishes to make the bodies of freemen and slaves different, the latter strong for hard labor, the former upright and useless for such things, but fit for political life" (Politics, 1254 b 27). But he does not tackle the question of why nature's desires are not satisfied. That they are not satisfied is only too clear (cf. ibid., 1255 b 2 and 1259 b 1). The answer no doubt is that matter impedes the fulfillment of the natural order and the old conflict in Aristotelianism which we have seen operating in other contexts ap- pears once more.12 If nature is found in the logical hierarchy, then one ought not to be forced to turn to observation to dis- cover her. But Aristotle does turn to observation frequently and nothing is more interesting in his works than the occasions on which he does so. Con- sider his treatment of pleasure as a norm. There is no systematic reason why good deeds should be pleas- urable; good deeds are simply those which actualize man's essence as man. But he observes (Nichoma- chean Ethics, 1157 b 16) that "nature seems especially to flee from the painful and to seek the pleasant." This can at best be nothing but an empirical induc- tion. It is given in the place cited as the reason why old people and sour people do not easily make friends. But one might with equal cogency argue that old people-if not sour people-might be expected to have realized rational animality more completely than the young and that therefore, whether their company is pleasant or not, one ought to cultivate their friendship. The more so since he also maintains that strength is found in young men and wisdom in old (ibid., 1329 a 14).13 If the society of old men is really unpleasant, its dis- agreeableness ought to be a sign of something due to chance, not to nature. Now Aristotle does not say in this place that pleasure is a sign of goodness and that one ought to seek the pleasant and avoid the painful. But he does nevertheless use the hedonistic norm elsewhere. For instance, when he is arguing against communism (ibid., 1263 b 5), he says that a commu- nistic regime would deprive a man of the pleasure of making gifts to his friends and this is held to be con- 12 The place of matter in Aristotle's system, if it is a system, is tantalizing. Prime matter, the substratum, is not capable of doing anything in particular, but can become anything what- soever in general; it is in other words a receptacle for the forms. Its status was clarified for what seems to me, if not to others, the first time in Plotinus. The matter which is composed of the elements should not be able to impede any actualization, since change is precisely the actualization of the forms resident in such matters in potentia. Aristotle's admission of nature's failures and frustrations is all in his favor as evidence of his sincerity; but he no more accounts for it by invoking matter than he accounts for error in human cognition. 13 Cf. Ps-Aristotle, Problemata, 955 b 22. clusive. Again (1119 a 22) when he is discussing self-indulgence and cowardice, he graduates the amount of reproach which these sins deserve by the amount of pleasure which they offer. There is, to be sure in Aristotle, a difference between psychic and bodily pleasures (1117 b 28); the bodily are worse than the psychic because they bring us closer to the beasts (1118 b 2) and therein, we may assume, they cause us to descend the scale of being and obstruct the realization of our human form or purpose. Psy- chic pleasures are approved by Aristotle. They ap- pear to accompany voluntary acts and voluntary acts are precisely the subject-matter of ethics. Pain is in fact the consequence of compulsion. And praise and blame are properly given only to the acts which are within our control (1109 b 30). It cannot then be said that Aristotle is indifferent to the hedonistic coefficient of behavior but only that he hesitates to use it as a standard of good and bad. Another complication lies in Aristotle's reading into a rudimentary hierarchy of living beings a hierarchy of value. The vegetable kingdom exists for the sake of the animal, the animal for the sake of mankind (Politics, 1256 b 15). In the human psyche, as is well known, these three kingdoms are reproduced in the vegetative, sensitive, and intellective faculties, the vegetative existing for the sake of the sensitive, the sensitive for the sake of the intellective. Yet within each kingdom the good of the individual spe- cies is realized in the actualization of its own essence, the good of a horse being presumably different from that of a cow, the good of an oak from that of an olive tree. But Aristotle makes nothing of this and the hierarchy of values, from those of plants to those of mankind, comes into play only when he is talking about the place of human beings in the universe. Among other services, it renders that of providing an argument for natural slavery and just war and against manual labor. Speaking of the kinds of music which may be played in the good state, Aristotle distin- guishes between that fit for free and educated men and that which should be played to mechanics, la- borers, and the like. The latter group have souls "perverted, as it were, from their natural condition" (Politics, 1342 a 22). But whether he means that labor perverts the soul or that one must first have a perverted soul in order to labor is not clear. There is reason to interpret him in both senses, for he be- lieves (1) that manual work is itself fit only for slaves (ibid., 1277 a 35) and (2) that no man can live a virtuous life who is engaged in mechanical work (1278 a 20).14 Manual work would presumably be unworthy of a rational animal because it does not require-at least in Aristotle's opinion-the use of reason; but why should he believe that the reason, which is after all the contermplation of eternal beings, 14 Cf. Metaphysics 981 a 30 and b 17. NATURE 59</page><page sequence="59">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE could fall into desuetude from lack of exercise? It may be that he means that "natural" laborers would be men incapable of reasoning, but in that case the practice of the manual arts could do no harm if a rational man were to engage in it. Once more Aristotle has reached that point at which reason and observation are in conflict: reason would show him simply that the good is the life of reason; observation that the life of reason demands leisure (ibid., 1337 b 32), just as philosophizing does (Metaphysics, 981 b 20). His observation is backed up by the general opinion of his fellow citizens, if we may trust him, for he says in the Politics (1269 a 34), "That in a state which is to be well governed there should be leisure from the necessities of life is generally granted." He is thinking of course only of the citizens, not of all the inhabitants, and it goes without saying that citi- zens must be fit for happiness. To construct a social order in which such men can live the life of what he calls action (rpatts) rather than that of production (roliaLs) is the aim of all political reform (ibid., 1254 a 7). The net result of all this is that only a few people within the state can ever be happy and, what is more important for those who look to Aristotle for guidance, the structure of the state is determined by the ethical needs of a very small part of the population."5 This group will be naturally free, a class to whom the state will grant leisure and who will be supported by the labor of The Many. If one ask why this group should have leisure and be supported by the work of others, there is no theoretical answer at hand that I have found. There is only an empirical answer, the value of which depends and must depend on the harmony between our observations and those of Aristotle. In fact, as we have suggested, there should theoretically be no need for leisure if the activity of thinking is the end of mankind, for the exercise of reason, since it employs no bodily organs, ought to proceed without hindrance from the body's demands. It is strange that since Aristotle took over the foundations of his ethical and political reforms from observation rather than from theory he should not have extended its implications. The cause of this was probably that he was scarcely aware of what he was assuming and believed that he was consist- ently rational rather than empirical. On several oc- casions he makes it clear that he is persistently mak- ing the final cause and end of a thing its good. To take but one example, in the Nichomachean Ethics (1094 a 5) he says in so many words that, wherever there is an end beyond an activity itself, the end is always better than the means. A similar re- mark is made in the Politics (1252 b 34). This signi- fies that means have only instrumental value and apparently he never thought of the possibility, which 16 Cf. Politics, 1328 a 35. became a reality in certain romantic writers, that means might become valuable in themselves regard- less of their end. The logic of his position was simple enough: means are devised to attain certain ends-we drink to quench our thirst; we eat to sustain life; we carve stone to make statues, and so on. Therefore, if the means would not be what they are if it were not for the ends, the ends contain, so to speak, the value which justifies the means. Psychologically, however, people become interested in certain activities, regard- less of their aim or even their success, and these ac- tivities or means become valuable in themselves. Here we have Lessing's search for truth rather than its possession, Novalis's pursuit of the blue flower, Lucinde's longing for longing's sake, Stevenson's end- less road to El Dorado. This possibility, as we say, apparently did not occur to Aristotle. On the con- trary, he dogmatically lays down the rule that actions do not differ as honorable and dishonorable in them- selves so much as in the end and intention towards which they are aimed (Politics, 1333 a 9), though this opinion is somewhat qualified in the Nichomachean Ethics (1110 a 14) by the statement that the end of an action is determined relative to the occasion on which it is performed. His use of this qualification shows that he is thinking of occasions on which a greater end is substituted for a lesser, thus causing a shift in criticizing the action. His example is the justifiable jettisoning of goods during a storm at sea in order to lighten the ship's load. Thus ends may change, at least as far as human activities are concerned. How then can one tell what ends are good and what bad? In terms of his primary assumptions the an- swer should have been, "There is only one good for everything-the realization of each thing's natural form." If the natural order were exemplified in the world of appearance, there would be no interruption to the achievement of goodness. And when Aristotle comes to consider the highest good for mankind, he finds it, as should be expected, in that which is pecul- iarly human. But at the same time he does not rely entirely on this argument, but takes over an additional Platonic criterion. When he introduces the concept of happiness in the Nichomachean Ethics, instead of defending it as the realization of rational animality, he justifies it on the ground of its being not only final but self-sufficient. So in the Politics (1253 a 1) he asserts that "to be self-sufficing is the end and the best." Consequently, the state must not be so unified that it is reduced to families or individuals, and, if self-sufficiency is to be sought, then a lesser degree of unity is desirable. This we have seen above. But now there are many forms or final causes or ends, as one chooses, which are not self-sufficient. In fact, when Aristotle is thinking of the three levels of life, all ends below that of man become means to the attainment of man's ends and it is possible, if one so 60 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="60">VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] wishes, to interpret him as saying that only one end is self-sufficing, namely the realization of "the form of the world." This is, moreover, in keeping with certain critical principles of Aristotle, some of which we have indi- cated above: (1) the whole is superior to the part (Politics, 1288 a 26); (2) change is bad (Nichomachean Ethics, 1154 b 26); (3) unity is better than variety (cf. Politics, 1252 b 1); (4) to act is better than to be acted upon (De anima, 430 a 18). The only complete whole is the cosmos; the only thing which does not change is the natural order; the only perfect unity is the form of the world; the only agent which is never acted upon is the Unmoved Mover. If one followed this set of clues, Aristotle would turn into a sort of Plotinian mystic. For the one good being would even then transcend the realm of existence, not as Plotinus's One transcends it, that is metaphorically, but literally. This would be so since the realm of chance is not a part of the world of nature in Aristotle or an emanation from it. There is no way whatsoever in which one can pass from one to the other. The problem of evil might possibly be translated into the problem of chance. But there would be no help coming from that quarter, since the realm of chance is observed, not explained or even capable of explanation. IV. CHANGE In the Categories (15 a 14) Aristotle distinguishes between six kinds of change (KLV?0-LtS). These are gen- eration and corruption, increase and diminution, alter- ation, the opposites of which will be given immedi- ately below, and locomotion and rest. These might be called change in existence, in quantity, in quality, and in position. The type of change which is called alteration has two opposites (ibid., 15 b 6): the quality of a thing may remain constant or it may change into its opposite quality, as, for instance, white changing into black. But the former is simply the general opposite to any kind of change, whether the change be alteration or generation or increase in size, for it stands for nothing more than the fact that something does not change but remains as it has been. Aristotle does not tell us why he singled out alteration as peculiar in having two opposites, but there is some likelihood that as regards the other kinds of change, he felt them to be more "normal" if one may say so, more inherent in the nature of the things undergoing the changes in question. Genesis and corruption would thus normally be found in living beings, loco- motion in the heavenly bodies, increase and diminu- tion again in living beings, whereas alteration might be less frequently found in natural processes. All this, however, is speculation on my part and of no exegetical value. That some things change and others remain unchanged is not only obvious but is pointed out by Aristotle in the Physics (232 a 12, 238 b 23) where he says that everything is either in motion or at rest and the word for motion (KLv/OLns) is the same word as that which he uses in the passage cited from the Categories to name any kind of change. Hence his reason for giving two opposites to alteration and not to the others is obscure. By subsuming all kinds of change under one head- ing, Aristotle commits himself to looking for certain constant features in them all. And of course he finds them. To begin with, in all change there must be both an agent and a patient, a mover and a moved. This appears throughout the corpus, but it will be especially recalled that in his discussion of the four causes in the Metaphysics (Alpha, chapters 3 and 4) and in the Physics (194 b) he includes both an efficient cause, the agent, and the material cause, the patient. In the Physics the material cause is defined as "that from which something comes into being and which is immanent in it," and he cites the bronze of a statue as an example; whereas in the Metaphysics no mention is made of coming-to-be and the material cause is simply named as "the matter and the substratum." Again the formal cause in the Physics is given as the species (etSos) and the model, "the formula (X6'yos) of the essence and the genera of it"; in the Metaphysics it is "the substance and the essence" and is identified with the "why" as the definition or formula (X6yos). In short, if you know what a thing "really" is, you will know why it is. In the Physics the efficient cause is "the primary source of the change" (no longer Klv7aLs but AteracoXt/) or of rest; in the Metaphysics nothing is said about rest and the cause is the cause of motion, as if rest were that which was to be ex- pected, the normal situation requiring no explana- tion. In the Physics the final cause is "the end, that for the sake of which," the purpose; in the Metaphysics it is "the cause opposed to [the source of the change], that for the sake of which and the good." In what sense the final cause is the opposite of the efficient cause is difficult to grasp, unless one think of the effi- cient cause, the source of the change, as an agent who, so to speak, plans to do something which he then pro- ceeds to do. The final cause in that case would be the opposite of the efficient cause in the sense of being the last thing to be realized, whereas the efficient cause has to initiate the train of events before any- thing happens. But this interpretation is shaky, for some efficient causes have to continue their action throughout a process of change and cannot withdraw from the scene after giving the command to proceed; others cannot plan anything except in the most far- fetched manner, in a manner which would be ludi- crously anthropomorphic. Ross points out in his Commentary on the Meta- physics that Aristotle nowhere shows us how he reached the doctrine of the four causes "nor offers any logical deduction of it" (p. 126). It would appear then that the doctrine is assumed as fundamental. CHANGE 61</page><page sequence="61">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE It can be interpreted most favorably to Aristotle as a basic metaphor in which the agent resembles a human artist fashioning some material into a shape prede- termined by him. Or, in view of his peculiar notion of the potential as something residing within matter, as the power resides within a drug, he may have inter- woven with this strand of imagery, another coming from the practice of medicine. (It is worth remem- bering in this connection how often Aristotle uses the arts of sculpture and architecture along with "the art of healing" as examples of causality.) In such art- istry, the artist, if we may call him such, has an idea in mind before he sets to work; for if one thing can be said definitely and firmly about Greek artistry, it was not random and automatic. He is also a being cut off from the material with which he is working. When he is a sculptor or architect, he is present guiding the work as it progresses; when he is a physician he is not always present and is also cooperating with the vis mediatrix naturae. But if one is going to apply such a figure of speech to the growth of a plant or the na- tural motion of a stone or flame, there is no discover- able agent external to the patient and the invention of the word "entelechy" to cover the former situation, if not the latter, only emphasizes the metaphorical character of the discussion. Now in the opening of the fifth book of the Physics, Aristotle sets down an analysis of all change, an anal- ysis in which there are five elements, the agent, the patient, the time, the terminus a quo, and the terminus ad quem. Yet later in the same work (Physics, 236 b 2) the number of elements is reduced to three, the patient, the time, and the terminus ad quem. One might identify the agent with the efficient cause, the patient with the material, but the time and the two termini have no strict analogues in the doctrine of the four causes. It is true that the terminus ad quem is always the final cause when things go as they should, that is, in accordance with nature, but Aristotle here is not so much concerned with that aspect of change as with those which might be relevant to dynamics. But it becomes a paradigm for all events and certain of its elements raise problems which might not have been raised if a different analysis had been made. For instance, if in all change there is an agent which is existentially different from the patient, that is, if nothing changes "of its own accord," where there is no agent which appears on the surface of things, one must be either invented or discovered beneath the surface. In Aristotle's biology this is the entelechy, the final cause which is immanent in the matter or potential in it, and in the generation of bisexual ani- mals it is the semen. But the growth of an animal is clearly different from its procreation and when one says that it is attributable to the immanence of an en- telechy, one has said nothing more than that the growth follows a determinable direction which is uni- form within the species or genus, other things being equal. The objection has become a commonplace and a frequent object of satire and I shall do no more with it except to point out that on a grand scale the doctrine of agent and patient gave rise to the universal agent, the Unmoved Mover, and the universal pa- tient, the Substratum. Though this result was pleas- ing to Christian theologians who proceeded to identify the Unmoved Mover with God, it was an anomaly in the Aristotelian philosophy. For the Unmoved Mover was both efficient and final cause and final causes were essences. But essences are always the characteristics of classes of things, not of individuals. And the Unmoved Mover was not a class. Hence nothing could be said of him whatsoever, in so far as his individuality is concerned. For one must dis- tinguish between individuals and classes of which only one member exists. Moreover, this aspect of change left open the ques- tion of what the agent actually does. From the his- torical point of view the two most important problems stimulated by this question are (1) does the agent create, or (2) does he simply rearrange elements al- ready pre-existing? It would look as if Aristotle believed that literal creation was impossible, not only because of his methodological assumption of the prin- ciple ex nihilo, but also because of his criticism of those of his predecessors who posited only one of the ele- ments as the arche (Metaphysics, 988 b 32). If the elements are really simple, none of them could arise out of any of the others, for genesis is always either combination or separation. In his own theory, as we have said above, the four elements are composites of the opposites in potentia, heat and coldness, moistness and dryness (De generatione et corruptione, 329 a 24). Of these the cold and the wet are privations, so that the two irreducible qualities are dryness and heat, perhaps a curious survival from the philosophy of Heraclitus. These are replaced in the transmutation of the elements by their respective opposites or priva- tions. Since the elemental qualities are only two, and no object can possess at one time both a quality and its opposite, the number of combinations which are possible is only four and we get the four elements of Empedocles in this manner. The pattern of elemental genesis was to be applied to all qualitative change, for, as readers of De genera- tione et corruptione will recall, the cycle of elemental transmutations is terminated when either Fire or Earth is reached. This cycle may move quickly when an element loses only one quality; for instance (ibid., 331 a 26), Fire will turn into Air if it loses its dryness, or Water will result from Air, if Air loses its heat. But it will take more time if, for example, Fire is to turn into Water or Earth, for then obviously more than one quality will have to be lost or gained, as one chooses to look at the process. Under what condi- tions these changes take place is not told us by Aristotle, though he is firm in his belief that they do 62 [TRANNS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="62">VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] take place and that furthermore Earth is to Fire as matter to form. One ought to be able to restate this cosmic fact as saying that Earth exists for the sake of Fire, just as in the psychological works, the body exists for the sake of the soul. Furthermore, he says flatly that change is always into opposites (ibid., 332 a 7). This principle is repeated as an axiom in the Physics (224 b 28), with the qualification that he is speaking about non-accidental change and the addi- tion that it also occurs among intermediates and con- tradictories. He is apparently aware of the possible objection that an intermediate might not be an oppo- site, for he argues the point, saying, "There is change from an intermediate, for it serves as an opposite to each of the extremes. Indeed it is in away an extreme." His example is the median note which is low in relation to the highest note and high in relation to the lowest; so grey is black in relation to white and white in rela- tion to black. But this is far from explaining why one extreme should ever turn into an intermediate between itself and the other extreme or why the inter- mediate should turn into one rather than the other of the two extremes. This is all the more curious in that early in the first book of the Physics (chapter 5) he tries to justify his view that change can occur only between opposites and he does so in order to support the methodological principle that "not everything can happen because of anything," in other words, that change is orderly and predictable. But shortly after this passage he re-introduces the intermediates but explains their origin as being in the extremes and again concludes, "Hence all things that have come into being naturally would be opposites or from opposites. "1 The principle of the polarity of change serves the purpose of cutting off the chronological ends of events, so that the investigator may know where to begin and where to stop. If these termini were not definite, there would be no telling what caused what. Aris- totle's science is based on the notion of material things which correspond to the grammatical subject, things which can have attributes which are, so to speak, de- tachable. But he has also to provide for living beings which grow from seed to maturity and then produce other living beings resembling them. Just as he fuses two metaphors when talking of causation, that of the artisan and that of the virtue or power of drugs, so he fuses two others derived probably from these when speaking of change. When a material sub- stance is shaped by a potter, the substance is not chemically changed but simply takes on a new shape; it could be said to retain its essential nature as matter throughout the formative process. Hence the begin- ning, end, and efficient cause are easily identified. When it is a case of living beings, it is only by an 1 The axiom of the polarity of change is repeated frequently in the corpus and is such a commonplace that I see no need of further citations here. But should anyone question this, let him consult Bonitz's Index, 391 b 49. als ob that he can find any matter which does not change its nature, for he could not go so far as to say that the flesh and blood of a growing child was indis- tinguishable from the catamenia furnished by the mother. But by once again utilizing the notion of an entelechy, he can keep identity through time and also, he thinks, provide for change. He manages in this way to have discrete things (res) in both inorganic and organic occurrences. These discrete things serve the following purposes: (1) each can correspond to a common noun; (2) each can have varying qualities or observable traits while maintaining certain "essen- tial" traits; (3) groups of them can be classified as sharing in a common essence; (4) scientific knowledge can handle the essences and not trouble about the varying characteristics or accidents; (5) a one-to-one correspondence can be set up between things and propositions in which the essences are named. The fifth point gives Aristotle the material for a theory of truth, as what I can only call a reflection of the order of nature. We shall return to this later. The polarity of change would appear to be indis- pensable to Aristotle, if my reasoning is correct. It is used, for instance, to prove that where there is no opposition, there is no change, as we have already seen. Now opposition always occurs within a given genus, so that if all the genera could be subsumed under one all-inclusive genus, as in Plotinus, then at best change could take place only among things which are not behaving according to nature. As we ap- proach order and definiteness, we move away from the mutable. He himself says (De partibus animalium, 641 b 18), "The orderly and the definite are seen much more in heavenly things than amongst us, but change and chance happenings are rather amongst the perish- able things." We can skip over the tautological fea- ture of the word perishable (literally, "things that die") and simply point out here again how we have two worlds on our hands, though now one of these worlds, the heavenly, is not so sharply cut off from the other as in some other of Aristotle's assertions. If he is thinking of living organisms, as he is in the passage quoted, then the genus is the natural class to which the organism belongs and the change is simply the process of growth from seed to maturity. The genus clearly undergoes no change and the design of the process of growth is fixed; it is the individual members of the genus which change. The polarity here, however, that between matter and form, is hardly the kind of opposition of which he speaks when dealing with qualitative change, alteration. For in alteration a quality disappears to be replaced by its opposite, whereas here the form is steadily being realized in time instead of suddenly appearing as its "opposite" matter disappears, even though in the order of nature it is prior to matter. In his biological treatises Aristotle is interested only in genera and quite rightly so, since he believes that there is no CHANGE 63</page><page sequence="63">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE knowledge of individuals. Therefore, since growth is an essential element of the genus and a definitive pattern of each specific kind of growth can be de- scribed, this type of change is not subject to the re- strictions which he lays upon some of the others. It is orderly in the sense that, barring accidents, it is always repeated. But its polarity is not the polarity of alteration. Locomotion also requires qualification. Locomo- tion (Physics, 261 a 29) may be, but is not always, continuous and eternal. "That of the other kinds of motion none can be continuous is obvious from these considerations. For all motions and changes are from opposites to opposites, motions such as genesis and cor- ruption having as limits being and non-being, alteration the opposite qualities, andincreaseanddiminutiongreat- ness and smallness or completeness and incomplete- ness of size." For each species of thing or event there is a natural size. We can omit any discussion of what is meant by "size." As Aristotle's argument de- velops, it turns out, as is well known, that only circular motion can be continuous and eternal (Physics, Book VIII, chapter 8), for any rectilinear motion must come to an end, there being no infinite extent in space which it might traverse, and, if it turned back, it would, according to Aristotle, have to come to rest at the point at which it began to retrogress.2 The only motion of this eternal sort is that of the planets. Sublunary locomotion is never continuous and eternal and consequently it too, like other forms of change, occurs only between opposites. Here oppositions may be interpreted literally as spatial direction. Such op- posites are the natural positions of the elements and at times seem to be certain directions, such as up and down, right and left, before and behind, obviously the six directions of three dimensional space.3 Each of these pairs of directions contains one good and one bad member, but whether the bad are privations of the good, I do not know. The elements move only up and down, unless force is applied to them; the heavenly bodies move from left to right; animals and plants may move in any of the directions. Aristotle defines motion as "the actualization of the potential" (Physics, 201 a 10). And in the definition he includes alteration as well as the other kinds of change. But he also maintains, as we have seen, that all change takes place in time. Hence alteration must also take place in time and in fact in at least one place (ibid., 249 a 29) he raises the question of how to determine the relative velocities of two different alter- ations. Yet if alteration is always the appearance and disappearance of a floating quality and if it can 2 According to Heath, Mathematics in Aristotle, 1, there is no mention of conic sections in the corpus. But the finitude of space would have made any endless curves unrealizable except the circle. 3 For his use of this idea, see De caelo, Book IV, chapter 4, and even De incessu, 705 a 26. occur only between opposites, that would seem to imply that it is instantaneous. For the qualities are eternal and come and go in atomic blocks. In fact when Aristotle is combatting Melissus (ibid., 186 a 10), he definitely asserts the possibility of change "all at once." Genesis and destruction, being combina- tion and separation, should also be instantaneous, for in the last analysis what is separated or combined can be only the atomic floating qualities. Increase and diminution, being change of quantity, might be ex- pected to take time, but matter is not atomic in Aristotle and hence cannot be supposed to grow by imperceptible and ultimate units added to one another over a period of time, each unit being added instan- taneously. Primary matter cannot be added to or subtracted from anything, for it fills all space. Sec- ondary matter, the elements, can move in blocks from point to point and thus can increase and diminish the amount of such matter in any given position. But there must be a minimum amount which is added in the case of increase and subtracted in the case of de- crease, which amounts would occupy the same posi- tion in Aristotle's physics as the atoms did in the physics of Democritus. These basic amounts would have to appear and disappear instantaneously. Now since the elements can move only in predetermined directions, the appearance of, say, a bit of Water on the level of Earth could be attributable only to (1) force, some unnatural dislocation of it, or (2) its having been previously drawn down from its natural location and its present effort to regain its natural position. The former case is scientifically inexplicable, being a random event, unnatural, unpredictable, observable, but not knowable. The second is the realization of the bit of matter's potencies; its coldness and wetness. Both of these qualities are unfortunately privations and privations are supposed to be unnatural. Be that as it may, what happens when some water appears on the surface of the earth is the appearance of two float- ing qualities in a position in fixed space. We are back at the kind of occurrence which we had in the case of alteration. Finally, the same remarks can be made about sublunary motion, all of which is the realization of potencies-the realization of the hot and dry, the hot and wet, and cold and wet, and the cold and dry.4 The outcome of the principle of the polarity of change is that we have to recognize two physical systems in Aristotle, (1) that of fixed position, the cosmic map in which everything is located "where it ought to be"; and (2) that of motion or change in the observable world where change exists but is funda- mentally inexplicable. The assumption of the polarity of change goes hand in hand with that of the finitude of change, though it 4 Aristotle admits that there are at least two changes which are instantaneous: pleasure comes into being all at once (Nichoma- chean ethics, 1174 b 9) and so does freezing (Physics, 253 b 25). 64 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="64">VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] goes without saying that changes might come to an end without the terminus being the polar opposite of anything else. But Aristotle is convinced that the endless would be unnatural. "Nature avoids the in- finite," he says in the De generatione animalium (715 b 15), and the reason for this is that the infinite is by definition without an end and nature always seeks an end. The word "infinite" in Greek-as in English for that matter-is a privative term, and literally means "without limit." But so is the word "endless," and Aristotle, like so many other philosophers, plays on the two meanings of "end," that of a termination and that of a purpose. Temporal endlessness is not objectionable in his eyes, for historically the cosmos has no beginning or end. But teleologically its pur- pose is always in process of attainment, for the Un- moved Mover is its final cause. Thus motion in the sense of change-in-general is endless (Physics, 251 b 29), though each change by itself has both a begin- ning and an end. But the endlessness of motion is demonstrated to prove that "there never was a time nor will there be when motion was not or will cease to be" (ibid., 252 b 5). This does not imply, however, that all things are always in motion (ibid., 253 b 6); it is apparently meant merely to say that somewhere in the universe something is always changing (ibid., 253 a 27). It may seem strange to find Aristotle arguing this point since he has already been so insistent on the termination of all change. But since he has assumed that in all change there is an agent, as well as a patient, he has to argue that somewhere there is a universal agent which is not itself moved, for other- wise he would fall into what he believes to be the error of an infinite regress. But the moment such an agent ceases to act, he would cease to exist and, I suppose, the world would come to an end. Similarly there must be a patient somewhere which moves nothing. Of these two beings we have already spoken. In the Physics (256 b 15), he introduces a third factor, "that by means of which the motion is effected." This means of motion is itself both moved and moving. For instance, a billiard player while playing billiards is an agent who moves but is not moved; the cue which strikes the ball is moved by the player and it- self moves the ball; and the ball itself is the patient which is moved but moves nothing else.5 It will be observed by anyone who reads the Eighth Book of the Physics that Aristotle never seems to suspect that there might be a reaction on an agent by a patient. I am not criticizing him for not having discovered the Third Law of Motion, but it would seem obvious that in any change the cause is as much affected by the patient as the patient is by it. Thus, though we attribute physiological changes to certain drugs, the drugs themselves are affected by the physiological 6 To make my illustration apt, we must assume either that the player is practising with one ball or is a bad player. system; otherwise they would not work. But if he had understood this, then he could not have located Matter and the Unmoved Mover at the two termini of his cosmos. For the former would have reacted and thus would not have been absolutely passive, and the latter would have been acted upon and therefore would not have been absolutely active. I have no explanation to offer for this and Aristotle is far from being unique in this respect. Activity without any trace of passivity was an ideal in ethics, as is seen in Stoicism; the Christian God when turned into a meta- physical principle or first cause could not be affected by what He created; and many arguments for free will turn upon the possibility of an agent's existing which will be affected only by what it considers to be right and wrong. This sort of thing is held to be perfect sovereignty. Aristotle's own handling of this problem is found in his discussion of whether a thing can come into con- tact with a second thing and yet not be touched by that thing. For in the Physics (202 a 5) he had laid it down as a general principle that when a mover moves something, it does so by contact and conse- quently is moved by it. This is repeated in De genera- tione et corruptione (323 a) where, wishing to establish the legitimacy of acting without being acted upon, he makes a distinction between acting and moving. In order to do this persuasively he points out that a mover may move without being itself moved, "as we sometimes say that a man in grief touches us but not that we touch him" (ibid., 323 a 33). This is about as bad a piece of philosophical punning as history affords, and moreover is quite unnecessary, since the action of which he is trying to prove the independence is that of attraction, not propulsion. Furthermore, though this is a bit beside the point, the untouched God who moves the universe by the love which the universe has for Him, is one more step removed from the Hebraic-Christian God who also loves His creation. Aristotle also wants one kind of locomotion to be temporally without end, that is, circular motion. There is obviously no end spatially to a circular line. But the fact that a body is moving in a circular path does not in itself imply that it will continue to do so forever. Early in the Physics (223 b 20) he says that only locomotion can be continuous and lays that down as the reason why time is thought to be the motion of the sphere. In the last book of the same work (chapter 9) he proceeds to prove that rotation is the primary form of all motion. Rotary motion can be eternal, whereas this is not true of any other kind, for reasons already given. Moreover, all the other kinds can be derived from it. These other kinds are rectilinear motion or mixed motion. Mixed motion would be motion the direction of which wobbled. It must be "posterior" to both rectilinear and circular motion, since it is composed of them both, though Aristotle does not tell us how the composition CHANGE 65</page><page sequence="65">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE is determined.6 He may have thought this to be self-evident. That rectilinear motion cannot be in- finite in extent is proved in the Physics (265 a 19) by pointing out that nothing can traverse an infinite ex- tent. No distinction is made in this place between a line infinite in extent and the time it would take to cover it. If such a line existed, it would be impossible for a moving body to traverse it in a finite number of temporal units, but since the universe will last forever, what importance would such a consideration have? Probably the more telling argument against it is that which we have mentioned before, that the spatial universe is finite in extent, bounded as he says in De caelo (Book II, chapter 4) by a sphere. Conse- quently, the farthest that a straight line could stretch would be the length of one of the sphere's diameters, though, since no moving object is at the center of the earth and all of them close to its surface, the longest real course of a moving object would be something approximating the distance from the surface of the earth to the sphere, or the cosmic boundary. If now one should raise the usual argument against the fini- tude of space and insist that a last point would of necessity "imply" a point beyond it, as in the first antinomy of Kant, one would have misunderstood Aristotle's position. To him an actual infinite was an impossibility; it would be imperfect and therefore contrary to nature. The determination of the im- perfect can be made only by applying a standard of perfection.7 But similarly time and change are blem- ishes on the natural order and can be conceived only in contrast with the timeless (the eternal) and the immutable. It is this type of purely dialectical argu- ment on which the sphericity of the cosmos is based. The second book of De caelo begins by stating what its author will set out to prove and it is worth while taking the time to examine his reasoning, for it pecul- iarly illustrates how his assumptions about method- ology, nature, and values come into play in a single demonstration. The thesis of this part of the work, then, is stated as follows: "That the whole heaven neither came into being nor can it be destroyed ... but is one and eternal, having neither beginning nor end of its whole duration but having and containing within it infinite time." A limit, he continues (ibid., 284 a 6), "is a kind of boundary, and this circular motion,8 which is perfect, contains those imperfect motions which have a limit and a point at which they stop, itself, however, having no beginning or end but without cessation during infinite time is the cause of the be- ginning of some and of others acting as the stopping point." The unlimited thus is conceived of as a pri- vation which can be understood only in relation to that which it lacks. But since the heaven is spherical, perfect, one, and eternal, "it suffers from no mortal 6 Cf. Heath's Mathematics in Aristotle, 146. 7 Cf. St. Thomas's fourth proof of the existence of God. 8 Reading KvKXofopla with Bekker. troubles"; it proceeds "without labor"; it has no need of "the force of necessity which would act to prevent its being borne off on a path inherent in it by nature"; for such constraint would "have no part in the best of conditions" (ibid., 284 a 14). Aristotle thereupon reverts to his appraisal of the six possible directions in three dimensional space which he expresses also in De incessu animalium and points out that motion in any direction must have a starting point. The start- ing point of growth is "above," that of locomotion the right, sensation out in front (ibid., 284 b 26). Now since only animate things have an implanted direc- tional matrix, and since the heaven is animate (eAvuxos De caelo, 284 a 29), the heaven must also have certain directions implanted in it. But since it is perfect, it must move in the better directions,9 though the cosmos as a whole possesses all six directions. But whether the better directions are determined prior to the de- termination of the movement of the heaven or whether these directions are better because they are the move- ment of the heaven is hard, if possible, to say. The argument now becomes increasingly dialecti- cal. First, Aristotle points out (ibid., 286 a 8) that everything which has something to do, exists for the sake of its task; in other words for its final cause or actualization. "But the actualization of God is im- mortality" (ibid., line 9). Consequently the move- ment of anything which is divine is eternal and, since the heaven is divine, it must move in an eternal motion and hence that motion must be circular. But this further entails the proposition that there must be something at rest in the center of the sphere. That which is at rest is the earth. By fusing the earth as a material body and Earth, the element, to- gether, the argument proceeds to show that, if Earth exists, then so must Fire, "for of opposites, if one exists by nature, so must the other exist by nature, if it be really opposite" (ibid., line 23). But further (line 25) the positive is prior to its privation, hotness to coldness, and Earth is cold; hence its positive, Fire, must exist. And this method can be used to prove the existence of the other two elements as well. The observation of the four elements is thus fortified by a rational demonstration of their existence. So much then for the local motion of inanimate things. We shall now turn to those changes which occur in living organisms. The principal changes which occur in them are obviously generation, growth, locomotion, and death. Locomotion forms a special problem since animals which move do not do so under impulsion from material objects in contact with them. Following his usual procedure, Aristotle has to ex- plain each of these sets of phenomena by assigning to 9 Cf. De caelo, 288 a 5. In the Middle Ages much was made of the supposed fact that the periphery of the universe was better than the center where man had been placed. See, for instance, A. 0. Lovejoy's Great chain of being, 101, Cambridge, Harvard University Press. 66 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="66">VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] them all a cause which is external to them, even if not external to the organism. He cannot simply state that one of the differentiae of living organisms is that they grow or move; he must find somewhere in them a "source" of growth or movement. For instance, in De motu animalium (698 a 8) it is said that the source of movement in the self-moved must be itself unmoved and hence the biologist must look for something which is at rest within the animal which can be such a source (ibid., 698 b 5). Or again, when he is discussing growth in the animal in De generatione animalium, he says (735 a 13), "Nothing can generate itself; but when it is born, it can grow by its own means.... That must first come into being which contains a source of growth within it." These "sources" are not a figure of speech for the fact that things are born and grow under statable conditions. On the contrary, -they are things in their own right. In the case under discussion it turns out to be the heart or "that which does the service of the heart" in animals which do not have one.10 For, as he points out in De partibus animalium (666 a 14), "It is necessary that the source, wherever possible, be one. And the place best suited by nature is the center. For the center is one and is equally or almost equally distant from all [the rest of the body]." Moreover, he continues, the heart is the first organ to appear in the embryo, thus balancing his a priori arguments with empirical data. In De generatione animalium he is similarly faced with a problem which arises because of his presuppo- sitions. He begins with the familiar distinction be- tween the four causes and then has to find at least an efficient and a material cause of generation, the final and formal causes being known. Here the distinction of the two sexes lies ready to be properly interpreted and we discover that the male contains the efficient cause of generation, the female the material (ibid., chapter 2). For, as he says (729 a 24), "there must be something which generates and something from which it generates, even if they should be combined in one animal, differing at least in form and in formula (X6yos), and in those which have these powers in sepa- rate beings, they must be different in their bodies and in their natures, one being active and the other pas- sive." This is purely a priori reasoning, based on his primary distinction between the two kinds of cause which he then couples with the two categories of activity and passivity. But if the question should arise of why the two causes should not be contained in the one animal, the answer is metaphysical. Three things are involved in this, he says (ibid., 731 b 21): he must show that bisexuality is derived from neces- sity and the prime mover; that the two sexes are formed of a certain kind of matter; and that they are differentiated because of the best, the final cause. The reason why animals are generated is immediately 10 Cf. De partibus animalium, 665 a 12. stated to be because soul is better than body; the living, since it has by definition a soul, is better than the inanimate; and existence and life are better than non-being and lack of life. The best of all is the eternal and divine which always exists. Animals can- not continue to exist forever as individuals-why not?-but their species can do so. The cycles of generation are then a mirroring of the eternality of the Unmoved Mover. But that cycle cannot go on with- out there being males and females to serve as its effici- ent and material causes. And since the efficient cause, the male, is inherently better than the material cause, the two must be kept separate, for clearly a single thing cannot be both better and worse. The generation of animals in this way reproduces the eternal order of nature and exemplifies the basic for- mula of all change: an efficient cause acting upon passive matter. And all this is done for the sake of an end.1' What is this end? The end is discovered in the scale of animate being. And the rungs on that ladder are determined by the manner in which the various forms of life bring forth their young. "It must be observed," says Aristotle (De generatione animalium, 733 a 32), "how well and in what order Nature brings things into existence. For the more perfect and warmer of the animals bring forth their young completed as far as their quality is concerned (though in respect to quantity none of the animals do this, for all once born begin to grow), and moreover generate these animals in themselves right away." That is, they are viviparous. But the second do not generate completed animals from the first (for they give birth to living animals from eggs) but they do produce them outside themselves. Then some do not give birth to a completed animal, but produce an egg and this egg is perfect. Then those which have a nature colder than these bring forth an egg not perfect but still an egg, only it becomes perfect outside of them, for instance, the race of scaly fishes and the soft-shelled ani- mals [the crustaceans] and those without shells [the mollusks]. And the fifth and coldest do not bring forth eggs from themselves, but acquire this characteristic [of being an egg] outside [the parent's body]. . . . Thus the insects produce 'larvae first. And the larva as it develops becomes egglike, for the so-called chrysalis has the function of an egg. And then from this an animal is born, reaching in the third change the end of its coming- to-be. There are two outstanding characteristics of this scale of animal life. In the first place the height of the scale is measured by the completeness of the young; in the second by the warmth of the animal's nature. A human baby is complete in the sense that, unless it is a monster, it has all the qualities of the adult, though not its size. Moreover, such animals bring their young to completion within themselves n For an excellent brief summary of Aristotle's argument showing the similarity of the life-cycle to the eternal motion of heaven, see Ogle's translation of De partibus animalium, in the Oxford translation, p. 640 a.

In this they resemble, however imper- fectly, the cosmos as a whole, which has nothing ex- ternal to it to keep it going. They have in short a certain degree of self-sufficiency as far as generation is concerned. But the scale of temperature is some- what different. Life depends on heat, which ulti- mately is the fiery element, the natural position of which is at the periphery of the sub-lunar world, and hence it is in the best of sub-lunary positions. Death in fact is the extinction of the vital heat (De respira- tione, 479 a 15). Cold blooded animals and plants ought to be immortal, but they get their heat from outside sources. The animal kingdom then is a rep- lica of the cosmic system, running from the least per- fect, the coldest, the most dependent on external aids, to the most perfect, the warmest, the most self-depend- ent. The microcosm in such a passage as this is not the individual human being but the whole animal kingdom. Since perfection in the sense of completion is as- sociated with autarky and autarky with goodness and since the positive is better than the privative, the scale of animals runs not simply from the insects up to the viviparous animals, but from worse to better. There is, however, an apparent anomaly which it may be interesting to point out: in the animal, as we have seen, the heart from which all life proceeds is in the center of the body and much stress is laid on this and on its being the first organ to appear in the embryo. If the microcosm-macrocosm parallel were to be worked out thoroughly, the sun might be expected to be in the center of the cosmos. But whatever may be the case in animals, the center of the cosmos, as we know, is the worst place and it is occupied by Earth, which is the worst element and corresponds to inactive matter. The sun, however, in Aristotle is not made of fire, but warms the earth because of the rapidity of its motion and its proximity to the earth (Meteor- ologica, 341 a 20). In this respect the parallel breaks down. I indicate this in the interest of those who might like to interpret Aristotle as if he were Pico della Mirandola. Another temptation to read a natural hierarchy into Aristotle is held out to us in De anima where the scale of life seems to be even more complete, since plants also are included in it. That plants have a soul is asserted on the basis of their being alive (De anima, 410 b 22; 411 b 27) and one can infer that they can die. But their soul consists exclusively of the nutritive faculty (ibid., 414 a 34) which is one with the reproductive (416 a 19). Animals have both a nutritive and a sensitive soul (413 b 2), while man has both plus intellect. Animals are thus both vegetative and animal; men are vegetative, animal, and intellec- tual. Man in this respect seems to recapitulate all life. Furthermore, each kind of soul is matter to the type just above it, as body is matter to soul in general. And in the famous, and obscure, passage on the intel- lect as passive and active (430 a 10), we find that even within the intellectual faculty there must be a division into matter and form, so that what we have become accustomed to call the active reason-a term not found in De anima-becomes the final cause of all life and is "separate and impassive and unmixed, being in its essence an actualization" (430 a 17). These adjectives are those applied also to the Un- moved Mover and one could easily think of the active reason as an image of the Unmoved Mover. The separateness of the active reason, which is the form of the passive reason and the final cause of all life, is an oddity in the system since no form is supposed to be separate from its matter.12 And, moreover, Aris- totle declares in De anima itself (414 a 19) that soul cannot exist without body, though it is not of course itself a body. And later (432 a 3) he is equally em- phatic in maintaining that there is nothing whatsoever outside of and separated from sensible magnitudes and that our noetic objects are always in sensible forms. But the Unmoved Mover too is separate from that which He moves and at the same time is the final cause of all else in the universe. There might be some question of how any individual could be a final cause or to what extent one could tell what it was. For the final causes or forms of ordinary individuals are what the individuals have in common; that is their essence; it is what they do or are on the whole. But if the cosmos is an individual which is unique, it is not a member of any class with whose other members it might be compared. Whatever it did or was would be its final cause or form, but there would be no method by which that could be discovered. If it went through certain cycles which were repeated, that could of course be at least theoretically discovered, and it is possible, indeed likely, that Aristotle believed such to be the case. He maintains (De generatione animalium, 742 b 18) that "they do not speak well or give a necessary cause who say that things always happen in such and such a way and think that this is the first cause-or source of coming into being-as Democritus the Abderite does etc. etc." Hence a simple statement of the most general facts is not an explanation in his opinion. Presumably we know what are the first principles of eternal things by a kind of intuition, for he says that it is not through proof (ibid., line 32). It is the kind of intuition by means of which we come to know the categories. But 12 This is indeed sometimes held to be the critical difference between Aristotle and Plato. See, for instance, Windelband's History of philosophy, tr. by James H. Tufts, 140, 2d ed., New York, 1893. But the non-separable forms are insisted upon by Aristotle himself. See inter alia Posterior analytics, 79 a 7; 83 a 33; 85 b 19; De caelo, 278 a passim; De anima, 403 b 2. But the most famous argument against the separate forms is in Metaphys- ics, Beta, chapter 4. 68 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="68">VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] the categories after all are common to many groups of things and their exemplification can be observed. To say that there must be a final cause of the cosmos- or any other kind of cause for that matter-is simple dogma based on the assumption that all things have such causes and that the cosmos is a thing like any other. But Aristotle gives us no reason to believe that the cosmos really is a thing like any other. And on the principles of his logic he ought not to believe that there could be any knowledge of it if it were. We have already spoken of Aristotle's most general assumptions about change, including the polarity of change and the extreme opposition of contraries. It appears in De sensu (441 b 8) that when we are acted upon, our "passions" too are produced by their con- traries. These three statements together would make it appear that there is in any change simply a passage from one state to its opposite, the opposite being fundamentally the last term in a series of degrees. Usually, as we know, one extreme is simply the priva- tion of the other. But the loss of a quality should be instantaneous, as we have pointed out above, and there should be no middle point between its presence and its absence (cf. ibid., 447 a 1). It is either present or not. But in biological events one has the phe- nomenon of growth to account for; processes, which take time, are the rule, not the exception. Hence those changes which are of interest to a psychologist must, to be sure, have opposite termini but must also have a middle point. Further assumptions are needed to explain their occurrence. Hence we come upon the following: in so far as there is something common to two things, the one seems to be active and the other passive (De anima, 429 b 25). Because of this Aristotle maintains that the intellect (nous) is poten- tially all things and can thus know all things. For he also assumes that all things can be known, since they are all either sensory or noetic objects (ibid., 431 b 21). Since there must be a common nature between agent and patient, nothing can enter into human con- sciousness which is not to some degree like human consciousness. Curiously enough this does not com- mit Aristotle to a doctrine which nowadays would be called one of the forms of idealism since the sensible species, which we apprehend in perception, are neither material nor mental. They are sui generis and may appear either embedded in matter or in consciousness. To what extent they are like the mind would be dubious, unless one were to interpret mentality as a function and not a substance. In that case sensation as the function of perceiving tle sensibilia would re- semble the intellect as the function of contemplating the sensibilia minus their matter. The objects of knowledge would not then act upon a substance, which by hypothesis would have to be like it, but would be simply established by a relation between a cognitive subject and a term or group of terms the "nature" of which might be anything whatsoever. But unfortu- nately this interpretation will not work for De anima as a whole, for we find its author saying (415 b 24; cf. 416 b 34) that sensation appears to be a sort of alteration. Alteration is a form of change which always moves from one extreme to the other, as we have seen. And where there is alteration there is also passivity; to perceive, says Aristotle (ibid., 424 a 1), is to be acted upon. But he also believes that sensation is a kind of actualization: "The sensitive faculty (r6 acaOcrTLKov) potentially is what the sensory object (rb ala-O-rov) is actually" (ibid., 418 a 3). So that when one sees the color red, for instance, the sense of sight becomes red. Aside from the meaning of this sentence, there is an inherent logical puzzle, a puzzle that arises from the conflict between the notions of alteration and actual- ization. Actualization is said not to be alteration (ibid., 417 b 5), or is a special kind of alteration. If sensation is alteration, it is the appearance and dis- appearance of the opposing sensible species. And when Aristotle is interested in the objective basis of sensation, the passive side of sensing, he emphasizes its alterative nature. But when he is interested in the functional side of sensing, he emphasizes what one might call its "energetic" nature. But the shift from sensation as alteration to sensation as actualization has an important theoretical interest. For Aristotle believes that the objects of actual sensation are always particulars, whereas those of scientific knowledge are universals (ibid., 417 b 22). But if sensation be an actualization, it cannot be of particulars, for only universals-forms-can be actualized. This difficulty is fundamental to the whole Aristotelian system. The particularization of forms is brought about by their incorporation and strictly speaking the only difference between John Doe and Richard Roe is their matter, though Aristotle sometimes writes as if the forms of individual human beings individuated them. In any event the individ- ual and the universal have identical properties in logic and Aristotle frequently transfers some of them to metaphysics, for he speaks as if individuals had forms distinct from the form of the nearest species to which they belong. But if he means that a given sensory faculty is actualization as the actualization of John Doe's eyesight, then his science of psychology disintegrates for, according to his own principles, we can have science only of universals. A closer scrutiny of his text will show that he wobbles on the question of the particularity of sensory objects. When he is not distinguishing sensation from understanding or from knowledge, he says that sensation is the recep- tacle of the "sensible forms without their matter" (ibid., 424 a 18; 427 a 9). But how can a form without matter be a particular? Yet note that unless it is a particular, sensation cannot be alteration. And if he CHANGE 69</page><page sequence="69">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE means that a given sensory faculty is actualization of that faculty in general-that is, of seeing, of hearing, and so on-then it canrnot be of particulars. The assumption of the particularity of sensory ob- jects gives rise to still another difficulty when Aristotle lays down as a rule that "the sensation of the things proper to each sense is always true" (ibid., 427 b 12).13 This means that when one sees a color, one cannot be mistaken as to whether it is red or green or yellow. Error enters when one tries to identify the particular thing which is red or green or yellow (ibid., 428 b 21). If the sensory objects are sensory qualities, then they cannot be particulars; if they are complexes of quali- ties, quantities, matter, in other words, if they are physical objects, then they are particulars but one can obviously be in error about them. Aristotle's belief that thought is distinguished from sensation by the universality of its objects is in con- flict with a passage in De anima (427 a 8) which says that sensation and thought are identical with being acted upon by the forms, which really means "re- ceiving the forms." Since thought is the receptacle of the forms, it follows that there is an identity of subject and object in thought (ibid., 407 a 7). This leads to the conclusion that not merely sensation, but also scientific knowledge and the intellect (nous) are infallible (ibid., 428 a 17). For if the form is directly present to the intellect, one could no more be in error about it than one could be in error about sensory qualities when they are present to the senses. False- hood, as we have said when discussing Aristotle's methodological assumptions, always arises when one makes a synthesis of two or more intelligibles. The synthesis cannot, however, be made by thought, for thought is the direct contemplation of the intelligible forms; it cannot be made by sensation, for sensation is the direct contemplation of the sensible forms. Something else must be provided to make wrong syntheses and that turns out to be the process of reasoning (b&amp;avora). Reasoning through the use of the categories may be in error, though why it should make the wrong syntheses is shrouded in mystery. It might of course be said that the synthesizing power is in the imagination, for Aristotle speaks of the capacity which we have of constructing one image out of several (ibid., 434 a 9). But such images are not thoughts. Again, if the floating qualities are perceived in com- bination, there could be no error, and if a complex intelligible is contemplated by the nous, there could be none either. Error may also arise from desire. For, he says to begin with (ibid., 434 a 3) that, where there is sensa- tion, there too are pain and pleasure, and where these are, there must necessarily be desire as well. This does not make it clear whether pleasure or pain ac- companies all sensation or whether they are simply 13 Cf. De anima, 418 a 15; 428 a 11; and De sensu, 447 a 17. never found apart from sensation. But it is certain that he believes desire to be a kind of appetite (ibid., 433 a 26) and to be an appetite for pleasure, the con- trary of which is the desire to avoid pain. The sig- nificance of this is that desire becomes the opposite of the logos and thus is a source of error in action. If we were to follow reason, we should never leave the realm of the good, evil being a privation (ibid., 430 b 22). But when we follow desire, we hit upon either good or evil (ibid., 433 a 28). We should therefore so arrange our lives that we may live in accordance with reason, which is identical with living "in accordance with nature." But this is impossible if we accept his basic assumptions. For the nous does not cause motion without appetite (ibid., 433 a 23), even though it be the practical, as distinguished from the theoretical, reason. Aristotle's own account of the matter runs as follows: "All appetite is for the sake of something. And that for which there is appetite is itself the source of the practical reason. And the last term-or end-is the source of the action" (ibid., 433 a 15). But this would seem to imply that, if one has a desire for a certain pleasure, that very pleasure which is the goal of the desire becomes the source of the practical reason. This results in the conclusion admitted by Aristotle that "there is no change, or motion, without desire" (ibid., 433 a 21). If one were to spend all of one's life in thinking, one would not act at all, but would live a life of contemplation. This would be action as opposed to passion, but would not be action in the sense of that which is directed by the practical reason. It looks then as if it would be only an accident if a man's desires happened to be for something which Aristotle would have called really good, for even the practical reason could not create the desire. Hence the very basis of his ethics is undermined by his own assumptions. One more difficulty and we shall have terminated our discussion of change. Motion in the psychological realm is always flight from or search for something (ibid., 432 b 28). This is in keeping with the natural teleology of the system as a whole. One would imagine, however, that since nature does nothing in vain, the apparent goods of appetite would be real goods. But Aristotle has no sentimental regard for beasts, children, or savages and, forgetting his natural teleology, he is willing to admit that our instincts may be wrong. This is to be sure sound common sense on his part but it introduces a curious problem. If our acts are purposive and reason cannot influence them, what control have we over our behavior? Should not Aristotle have concluded to the melancholy picture of man as an animal which sees the good and can attain it only by chance? These difficulties are all bound up with his assump- tions about cognition. We shall now turn to them. 70 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="70">VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] V. COGNITION "We think that we know," said Aristotle (Meta- physics, 994 b 29), "when we know the causes." In this place the sentence is used to prove that there cannot be an infinite number of kinds of causes since, if there were, we could not know them. The assump- tion behind this is that the world is intelligible. Such an assumption seems innocent enough, for we all make it, compelled either to deny the existence of cognition as an orderly series of judgments, which would be absurd, or to admit that however limited the range of knowledge, it is the only means we have of satis- fying one of the most common of human instincts, curiosity. The problems of cognition are of course numerous. One must have some theory of truth, since sometimes we err. One must distinguish be- tween the various types of cognition, perceptual ap- prehension, intuitions, assumptions, logical relations of ideas to one another, and above all the contribution of intellectual methods to what we believe. When Aristotle identifies knowledge with knowledge of the causes, he is thinking of knowledge as complete ex- planation, as an answer to the question, "Why?" Among the four causes is matter. And Aristotle had also maintained elsewhere (ibid., 1059 b 26; 1060 b 20, 1003 a 15, and 33) that knowledge is always of the universal. This kind of knowledge is scientific know- ledge or understanding (rLorouM) from which alone deductions can be drawn. He contrasts it, as we have already seen, with perception which is always of par- ticulars (Posterior Analytics, 87 b 38; De anima, 417 b 23). But universals have no matter, unless they have "noetic matter" (Metaphysics, 1036 a 9). What- ever else noetic matter may be, it is not itself a uni- versal, though it seems to belong to universals. And even though it were a universal, the matter of sensible things would still be an unknowable. For Aristotle is emphatic in his assertion that universals are im- material, while also insisting that they are usually found incorporated. Hence, if we take the assertion that knowledge is always knowledge of the four causes and assume that he means here by knowledge the knowledge of universals, then we shall be forced to conclude that one of the four causes will always elude our cognitive apprehensions. If, however, we lay that down as one of his cardinal principles, we have to face the difficulty that he recognizes our knowledge of secondary matter, if not of primary, for we can truly know that a statue is made of bronze or marble or that the soul is the form of that of which the body is the matter. In the Nichomachean Ethics (Book VI, chapter 6) is a passage which elucidates another difficulty which Aristotle himself saw. That difficulty is our knowl- edge of the first principles, the universal premises from which demonstrations follow. They cannot be scientifically known, since they are that upon which science rests; nor can they be the object of art or pru- dence, since art and prudence deal with changeable things and the first principles are eternal. Conse- quently they must be apprehended by a special faculty. To this faculty he gives the name of nous, which might be rendered "intuitive insight," "intelligence," or "reason," in the sense that Kant and other Germans often gave to Vernunft. In any event it is an appre- hension of the first principles by a kind of natural light. But what is apprehended? Presumably the summa genera, the categories, or any premise which has to be accepted as true in order to start a series of demonstrations.1 The categories themselves might be expected to delimit areas of investigation such that each would specify a scientific subject-matter. One might then imagine that Aristotle was positing ten sciences, each dealing with the subject matter appro- priate to a single category, a science of space, a science of time, and so on. But on the contrary, since a given thing may be categorized in several ways, being, for instance, spatial, temporal, qualified, quantified, active and passive as well as the rest, the sciences are defined by the genera to which their subject-matters belong. "A single science," he says (Posterior Analyt- ics, 87 a 38), deals with a single genus, studying whatever is composed of its first principles, that is, their parts or properties in themselves. And one science differs from another in so far as its principles are neither derived from the same principles as those of the other nor serving as the first principles of the other.2 A sign of such difference is found when one reaches the indemonstrables. For these must belong to the same genus as what is demonstrated. And a sign of this is found when what is proved by them is in the same genus and of the same kind. There are at least two features of this statement which demand comment: (1) the genera are cut off from one another, must not overlap, and in that respect they resemble the categories; (2) Aristotle speaks of the genera of the scientific statements, not of those of their subject-matter. The first comment is in agreement with Aristotle's notion that knowledge cannot ever reach a point where it will all flow from one premise. For though he may have defined the subject of metaphysics as being qua being, he did not maintain that the kinds of being could be deduced any more than he attempted a post- Kantian deduction of the categories.3 In fact, his 1 We are more aware than Aristotle was of the possibility of a large number of possible premises from which by the rules of the syllogism a single true-to-fact conclusion may be drawn. Thus by two false-to-fact premises we can conclude to a true conclu- sion. Witness the following syllogism in Barbara: All triangles are mortal, Socrates is a triangle, therefore, Socrates is mortal. But Aristotle, though obviously interested in the formal proper- ties of propositions, took it for granted that his logic was a tool for helping us make true-to-fact inferences. 2 For a more literal rendering of this sentence, see Mure's translation in the Oxford series. 3 Cf. especially Posterior analytics, 76 a 16. COGNITION 71</page><page sequence="71">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE repeated attacks on the method of dichotomy as a means of breaking up the more inclusive genera in order to reach the less inclusive, is sufficient evidence of his disapproval of a universe without logical gaps. He is only too willing to admit that some ideas must be taken for granted; in the Posterior Analytics (76 b 11) they are the selection of the distinct genus whose properties are to be studied, the axioms from which demonstrations are to follow, and the properties of the members of the genus. But if one is to posit these three, the only task left for reasoning will be that of organizing what one has posited into a rational system, in Aristotle's case, a system of syllogisms. The prop- erties of the members of the genus will be ob- served, not proved, and some way will have to be found for them to turn into universals which alone make demonstration possible. The second comment raises a question more difficult to handle. For it involves the basic metaphor which determines the nature of any kind of cognition. That metaphor makes cognition, whether perceptual or scientific, a reflection of something in the world of existence, a sort of copy. Though Aristotle refuses to grant that perception is knowledge, nevertheless, as we have doubtless seen, perception is an absorption by the mind of certain aspects of the non-human world, the sensible species. On that analogy, the nous absorbs or reflects its peculiar subject-matter, the universals. When he says (De anima, 429 a 17) that as sensation is to the sensitive object, so is the nous to the noetic object, he announces the parallel of which I am speaking. But here he runs into the obvious difficulty that sensation is inarticulate. It may be always true in the sense that one cannot be mistaken about the color which one sees or the sound which one hears, but falsehood also, he maintains (ibid., 430 b 2), always arises when one attempts to combine two or more sensibles. Presumably such combinations would be expressed in the form of judg- ments, which alone can be true or false. But judg- ments cannot be the object of either perception or reason. The former may apprehend qualities or groups of qualities; the latter may apprehend uni- versals. But neither in itself expresses anything whatsoever. For "redness" or "justice" in isolation are not assertions. The metaphor thus creates the problem of the rise of judgments-or propositions- out of terms. The description at the end of the Posterior A nalytics of the emergence of knowledge out of the gradual transformation of perception into memory, memory into experience, and experience into universals, leaves us with a collection of universals in our minds-assum- ing that the phrase "in our minds" is not nonsense- but it does not tell us how or why we make judgments out of these universals. And since in the case of im- material things the nous and the noumenon are the same (De anima, 430 a 3), it would look as if knowledge of the universals, which are certainly immaterial, was simply a fusion between them and the intuiting sub- ject. In other words, in the light of such a passage there is no separate nous to judge anything. There is simply the occurrence or appearance of a universal somehow in a human soul. This is not an impossible epistemology, for one might maintain that judgments or assertions automatically expressed themselves at certain points in their careers. On the analogy of seeing, one might easily say that the soul "saw" the implications of, for instance, the concept of circularity as soon as, or immediately after, the concept itself arose out of experience. But then there would be no need to have a subject of knowledge, a knowing ego or nous, and Aristotle throughout his works insists upon the need of agents to perform acts. Moreover, he definitely assumes that there is an existential duality between knowledge and its objects (Categories, chapter 7), as there is between perception and its objects. And he always hypostatizes functions into faculties. Furthermore, there can be no question about the separateness of the nous. In the famous passage on the active reason in De anima (430 a 10), we find that it is "separate," "impassive," and "pure" (unmixed) in its essential nature.4 The separateness of the nous may be motivated in De anima, (413 a 6) where Aristotle says that nothing would prevent a part of the soul from being separate if it were not the actuali- zation of some part of the body. Since thinking goes on without the aid of any bodily organ, its agent could well be separate. But if it is separate and an agent, it must do something and not simply lie dormant until a universal emerges before it. It is, to be sure, nothing in actuality until it thinks (ibid., 429 a 24), but when it thinks it is engaged in an act, though how an im- mortal and timeless being can now act and now not act is left unexplained. As the final cause of all psychic functions, it might be simply analogous to the Unmoved Mover, but the analogy must not be pushed too far, for the cosmos always moves towards the Unmoved Mover, whereas a man is not always think- ing. Reasoning (6tavota) and thinking (pop6vatns) are not, however, identical with knowledge (~crLor'tA7). Aristotle distinguishes between such processes leading to an end and the end itself. If we think of knowledge as the end, it can be envisioned as something complete in itself, as the work of art is the actualization of the artist's intentions or the mature animal the actualiza- tion of its vital potentiality. This would appear to be Aristotle's meaning when he says that the nous is impassive and identical with its noetic objects. For on the analogy of sensation, knowledge would then become pure contemplation. Judgment may then be needed for the processes of achieving knowledge, but when the mind possesses knowledge, no judgment is 4 Cf. De anima, 429 b 5, 413 b 22, 408 b 18. 72 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="72">VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] needed. But as a glance at Bonitz's Index will show, such terms are far from univalent. The strict parallelism between knowledge and exist- ence appears most clearly in the Metaphysics. Even in the Philosophical Lexicon, when Aristotle is defining "false" (Chapter 19), he is willing to apply the term to things as well as to sentences. A false thing is a thing which is not "put together" or cannot be.5 It might also be something, he says, which appears to be what it is not, a drawing or a dream, of which we would have good illustrations in trompe-l'eil paintings. Such things, one might say, make false claims. False propositions (logoi) are propositions which are applied to things "of which they are not true," and the example which Aristotle gives here is the application of what is true of a circle to a triangle. But now when is a proposition true? In another chapter (Eta, chapter 4) we find that "truth and falsity are not in things, such that the good is true and evil at once becomes false, but in thinking" (1027 b 25). This would seem to mean that when Aristotle is not merely listing verbal usage, he refuses to qualify things and universals as either true or false and reserves the adjectives for our thoughts about them. In Meta- physics, Theta (1051 b 1) we find that being and non- being in the strictest sense are truth and falsity and I suspect that what he means by "in the strictest sense" is "real" being and "real" non-being. For he im- mediately expresses a correspondence theory of truth. "It is not through our thinking truly that you are white which makes you white, but through your being white that when we say so we are telling the truth" (ibid., line 6). He then distinguishes between contin- gent and necessary things and points .out that in regard to the former we may be right at one time and wrong at another, whereas in regard to the latter we must always be either right or wrong. The contingent things are things in the world of time and space, the realm of perception, and of these, as we have repeatedly pointed out, no knowledge is possible, though we may have opinion about them. The necessary things are actualized universals. Here there can be no error, he says (1052 a 2), but only ignorance. To know them is to know the truth. One could scarcely find a better illustration of his manner of conceiving knowledge as simple contemplation of really existing beings. That this relationship is not possible with regard to changing things, which are the objects of perception, becomes understandable. For as we look at them, they change. As long as knowledge is a reflection of an object in the mind, as the reflection of something in a mirror-but a mirror which does not reverse its 6 I submit to the decision of Ross in his Commentary on this passage and his translation in the Oxford series. But the ex- amples which Aristotle himself gives are assertions, not things. A false thing might be something the parts of which could not be composed for they entailed incompossible traits, such as round- squares, bitter-sweets, or possibly white-odors. images-the Heraclitean denial of knowledge of the mutable will hold. For not only must there be an image, there must also be a word or statement which will symbolize it in an eternal, anti-historical manner. And if knowledge is, moreover, knowledge of the four causes, it is clear that at most one could know only the efficient and material causes of things in process of change. Becoming as such gives no hint of a formal and final cause; to discover them, one must wait until the process is completed. This is why Aristotle when he came to his classification of the sciences (ibid., Eta, chapter 1) set the theoretical sciences apart from the practical and poetic and reserved for that rubric mathematics, physics, and theology. These sciences study that which is closest to the divine, for mathe- matics talks about its subject-matter as if it were immutable and immaterialized; physics, though it deals with mutable and materialized beings, neverthe- less also studies the eternal courses of the heavens; and theology, which here means metaphysics, obvi- ously studies beings which are both timeless and im- mutable. The problems of how by contemplating the eternal and immutable essences one could ever come to know that there exist also temporal and changing things, how that which exists without matter could ever give us a hint that there are material things also in the universe, as well as the problem which we have already mentioned of how we could know the four causes of that which has no causes but is self-subsist- ent, these problems are not discussed in this place. On the assumption that when the nous knows, it becomes identical with its object, Aristotle should land in mysticism when he tries to know the Unmoved Mover. This in itself would be no cause for alarm unless one had reason to believe that mystical knowl- edge was somehow or other discreditable. Alarm is evoked when one sees that one could never know the Unmoved Mover at all if Aristotle's assumptions about the nature of cognition were accepted. For each act of cognition is the realization of a form and the only hindrances to knowledge of any type are those inherent in this particular doctrine. Though Aristotle says that perception is not knowledge, it is nevertheless that out of which all knowledge eventually arises. The principle nil in intellectu quod non prius in sensu was firmly laid down by him in De anima (432 a 3). Even the abstractions are there. If the Unmoved Mover were simply the Form of the World, in the sense either that he was that towards which all change was moving or some general quality of things fused into one form- as the essences of classes are-then one could under- stand how by a gradual refinement of perceptual ex- perience he might emerge detached from all material embodiments. But this does not appear to be the case. He is, to be sure, the Form of the World, but like the active reason he is detached from that which is his matter. One cannot, if one is faithful to the texts, interpret Aristotle's theology as some form of COGNITION 73</page><page sequence="73">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE pantheism in which the Unmoved Mover would be immanent in all changes. The text is too definite about his separateness to permit that. Nor can one say that he is separate only for purposes of conversa- tion, as mathematical objects are said to be. For it is insisted that he is immaterial. The argument to the existence of an Unmoved Mover need not concern us here, for we are interested only in what Aristotle took for granted. But one of his assumptions was that in all changes one must posit an agent and a patient. In the human soul, he says in the passage on the two reasons, there must also "be something to serve as matter for each genus and which is all the members of the genus potentially, and another which is the cause and agent by the fact that it makes all . . ." (De anima, 430 a 10). It presum- ably receives from the passive reason the forms, though the process is very obscure, and, once they are re- ceived, they and the nous are identical. He compares its activity to that of light which actualizes potential colors. Hence it has to be both separate from that which it knows and identical with it, separate both as agent and as final cause. But similarly the whole cosmos has to have an agent and a final cause and that of course is the Unmoved Mover. The two basic metaphors of change as the fashioning of matter by an artist and change as organic growth keep interfering with each other. In the former there is an obvious agent existentially separate from the matter which he is fashioning; in the latter by the verbal invention of the entelechy the agent is situated within the matter. It must be evident that if the cosmos were to have an agent analogous to an artist, he must be completely outside the material world, either as a creator or as a governor. He could not be a creator in Aristotle's system since the cosmos was everlasting. He could then be a governor. But a governor is not a final cause of that which he governs, though he may act as an efficient cause. He might govern in several ways, for instance, as a set of natural laws which were per- fectly consistent and universally applicable, or he might be a person like the Zeus of Cleanthes. Other possibilities will occur to various imaginations. If, on the other hand, the metaphor of the organism were to be applied to the cosmos, the Unmoved Mover would not be separate from that which moved and would be eternal only in the sense that the order mani- fested by cosmic cycles and rhythms are invariable. But it is doubtful that he could be both unless one was enamored of logical incoherence. Now there is nothing of a Tertullian in Aristotle, in spite of his believing in certain absurdities. The description of the Unmoved Mover begins in the sixth chapter of Metaphysics, Lambda. The argu- ment naturally has to be purely dialectical, for there is no other way, except through a mystic vision, of proving the existence of something which by its very nature eludes observation. It will be recalled that at the very start Aristotle makes a distinction between the physical substances, which are movable or mutable, and a substance "which must be eternal and immu- table." This depends upon his assumption that in all change there are both a mover and a moved, but here he thinks that the mover must be external to the moved, as if it were a human agent, let us say an artist. He then brings in a conclusion of which we have already spoken, that change or motion like time must be everlasting and that the only continuous and ever- lasting motion is locomotion in a circle. Such motion too demands a mover and by the axiom that all poten- tialities need not be realized, he concludes that the agent of eternal motion must be actual. "There must then be a first principle (arche) such that its essence [or substance?] is an actuality" (1071 b 20). This follows only if one believes that the world has no be- ginning or end and Aristotle does believe that. We need not consider the possibility that it might pass successively through a series of stages, such as the Empedoclean cycles of Love and Strife, in which two or more agents govern things. Such a substance, says Aristotle, must, if eternal, be also immaterial. For material things would not be eternal. The reasoning here must have jumped a point or two, for though material things do change, they are not bound to change. They are mutable potentially, but again, since all potentialities need not be realized, the poten- tialities of some material things could remain potential. Moreover, there are some passages in the Metaphysics itself (e.g., 1028 b 36) which make it clear that the substratum, which is one kind of matter, has no attri- butes whatsoever and is pure potentiality. But Aristotle knows that at least some potentialities are realized and in their case an agent is required. As Newton was to say in his General Scholium, if one finds an invariable law, there must be an invariable lawgiver. It is easy to see that the similarity between agent and effect is assumed in such an argument, as if an agent could not cause anything which had proper- ties antithetical to its own. More puzzling still a new difficulty arises. How can an eternal and immutable cause bring about temporal and mutable effects, if we retain the assump- tion just mentioned? There are four kinds of sub- stances involved in change: (1) those which are moved and move nothing; (2) those which are moved and also move something; (3) those which are unmoved and move something; (4) those which are unmoved and move nothing. These possibilities are purely logical and need not be exemplified, though in Erigena we find all four laid down as existing in nature.6 In the movement of the sphere of the fixed stars we have something which has continuous and eternal motion. It is the cause of all motion "below" it. At this point Aristotle might have turned to his biological metaphor 6 In the opening of De divisione naturae which was condemned in 1225 by Pope Honorius III. 74 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="74">VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] and concluded that the cosmos was, to use a Stoic phrase, a Great Animal, and in its eternal motion was simply fulfilling its inherent entelechy. But on the contrary he relies on his other metaphor of the agent and the patient and concludes that they must be moved by something "which moves but is not moved, eternal, being both substance and actuality" (1072 a 25). This, the Unmoved Mover, moves, as is well known, by the love which he inspires in all that is beneath him. He is in short the final cause of the whole cosmos though not, as in Christianity, its creator. If it be asked how Aristotle knows that there must be an Unmoved Mover, the answer must be that his existence is entailed by certain assumptions which have been made about change, assumptions which we have already indicated. If these assumptions are known by the nous as the archai are known, they must of course be true, but if they are abstracted from per- ceptual experience, then they must be "in" perceptual experience. But perceptual experience is (a) always changing and (b) it contains unnatural events. The principle that only what happens on the whole is natural cannot itself be found in perception, for all one could deduce from perception would be that some things happen on the whole and some occasionally. Hence that principle, like all first principles, must be intuited. And we are landed in another form of the schema of Two Worlds, this time one in which one world is that of the intuited principles, the other that of perceptions.7 It must be by means of the former that we conclude to the existence of the Unmoved Mover. But that does not eliminate the difficulty of knowing him if knowing the immaterial is to be the immaterial. A dialectical method such as is exemplified here depends ultimately upon the acceptance of the three so-called Laws of Thought. And in spite of Aristotle's invectives against those who use the method of dichot- omy, the Laws of Thought presuppose it. For the Law of Contradiction, as given in the Metaphysics (1005 b 19), runs, "It is impossible for the same thing at the same time both to belong and not belong to the same thing and in the same respect." The important words in this formula are obviously "at the same time" and "in the same respect." Thus, he says a little later in attacking the Neo-Heracliteans (1005 b 30), "It is impossible for the same man to suppose that the same thing both exists and does not exist at the same time." But the insertion of the temporal qualification grants that at different times the same thing may have different properties, whether these be existence or qualities.8 He says himself that this law cannot be 7 Note that in the Metaphysics (Gamma) 1005 a 34, Aristotle says, "Nature is one kind of being," and thus ranks the physicist below the metaphysician. 8 The trouble with this formula is the word "same." If a thing changes, it would seem not to be the same as it was, and yet certain changes are permitted and do not violate self-identity. demonstrated since it is one of those axioms upon which all thinking depends. But in the realm of the eternal there are no times and the best one can do is to use the analogical phrase of the totum simul to make the law applicable.9 Strictly speaking, one should conclude that in the eternal realm both contradictories are true and one would have a metaphysics similar to the negative theology, though for different reasons. But if one presupposes the actuality of both realms, one of which is directly accessible to us and is known to have certain properties, the other world may be said to have the "opposite" properties. If one world is temporal, the other will be timeless; if one is material, the other will be immaterial; if one is mutable, the other will be immutable. And so one will continue. Hence one can make true statements about the second world simply by asserting things about it whose pred- icates are the opposites of those which are attributed to the first world. How does this differ from the method of dichotomy? The Law of Excluded Middle (Metaphysics, Gamma, chapter 7) states that there is no intermediate between two contradictory propositions. A sentence is either true or false. This precludes any idea of degrees of truth, as were found in Hegelian and post-Hegelian philosophies. It obviously also precludes any inter- mediary between the true and the false. It is worth observing that Aristotle's demonstration of this is based upon his conception of change, that change is always from opposite to opposite. If it were possible for a sentence to be neither true nor false, then it ought to be possible for something which was not not-white to become white and that is impossible. Though Aristotle is willing to admit the existence of some intermediaries, he also maintains that when they change, they change into one of the two extremes between which they exist, as we have already seen. Hence they stand as extremes in situations of change. But when it is a question of truth and falsity, that is An egg which develops would probably be called the same egg or the same organism at least throughout the process of develop- ment. We permit certain changes and forbid others. In any event it is clear that, if a thing changed one of its essential properties, we would say that it was no longer the same thing, and our problem would then be the discovery of an antecedent for "it." When we say that the same thing cannot both exist and not exist at the same time and in the same respect, we are caught in the curious dilemma of arguing in a circle: either it makes sense to speak of a thing's both existing and not existing at the same time or it does not. But if it does, then "existence" is a predicate which may or may not be attached to a subject and we have the problem on our hands of Kant's imaginary and real sum of money. If it does not, then the whole question is non- sensical. If, on the other hand, we say that the Law of Contra- diction is a rule in formal logic, we can omit dates and respects and simply say that p and not-p are not both true, i.e., if p is true then not-p is false. But once more we should point out that Aristotle is not interested in a purely formal logic. 9 There is a hint of this in De interpretatione, chapter 7, (17 b), where Aristotle distinguishes between contradictory and con- trary propositions. But it is only a hint. COGNITION 75</page><page sequence="75">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE an impossibility and the false becomes the privation of the true. Though the true and the false are not listed in the Table of Opposites (Metaphysics, 986 a 22), yet in Metaphysics, Gamma (1004 b 27), he says that all opposites can be reduced to being and non- being, the one and the many, "rest coming under the head of unity, motion of multiplicity." This state- ment he backs up with general opinion and accepts. Hence when he comes to truth and falsity (ibid., chapter 4), the opposition between being and non- being becomes the basis of one of his arguments for excluding the middle. This special opposition holds good whether the word "being" means existence or is used simply as a copula. This should be borne in mind when commentators are tempted to interpret Aristotle as if he were a Neo-Platonist, for one of the cardinal tenets of Neo-Platonism, as that doctrine is represented by Plotinus, is the belief in degrees of being and reality. The Law of Identity is never explicitly phrased by Aristotle but is constantly used.10 Book VII of the Topics takes up the several meanings of "the same" draws certain conclusions about the interrelations of things which are the same. Thus, if justice and courage are the same, the just man must also be coura- geous. Again since (Topics, Book I, chapter 7) things may be the same numerically, specifically, or generi- cally, two things may be the same though given dif- ferent names or because they belong to the same species or genus. This could give rise to the Law of Identity but is really only a lexicographical observa- tion. The closest approach to a formal statement of the Law is in the Metaphysics (1006 a 28) where Aristotle warns against the use of ambiguity in demonstration and insists that a word must have a definite meaning. And when he is discussing the meaning of "muti- lated" (Metaphysics, Delta, chapter 27), he points out that it is senseless to call a thing mutilated unless there is some essential identity between the thing before and after the mutilation. This would be a case of numeri- cal, not qualitative, sameness. In all his discussion of sameness Aristotle swings between the idea that a term or perhaps a proposition must not change its meaning during an argument and the idea that it is a character- istic of things to maintain a stable "nature" through time. There is no saying which of these interpreta- tions is the more faithful to Aristotle's intentions since his logic is so intimately connected with his ontology. To maintain numerical identity through time depends on there being a radical distinction between essence and accident, so that, though the accidents may change, the essence remains the same. But essences 10 Cf. L. M. Bochenski, Formale Logik, 70, Freiburg, K. Alber, 1956: Wdhrend Aristoteles das spater so oft erorterte Identitdtsprinzip wohl kannte, aber nur fiichtig erwdhnte... and refers to Prior Analytics, 68 b 20. This passage makes use of the Law by pointing out that the middle term in a syllogism must not change its meaning, though Aristotle does not put it in that way. are discovered only by an examination of classes of things, no individual having any essence apart from the species or genus to which it belongs. And since he assumes that all knowledge begins-temporally- with perception, he has to invent some way in which the essences can be abstracted from the world of non- essences. This is a serious problem since what we perceive has characteristics which are the very antith- eses of those inherent in essences: the objects of perception being mutable particulars and consequently not susceptible of logical manipulation as he conceives of logic. No particular can be the opposite of any other; it is the attributes alone which can be in opposi- tion. By his assumption of the real distinction be- tween subject and attribute, he can of course posit something which changes only in the sense that its attributes change, but the problem is to transform these attributes as well as their compounds into essences. It is interesting to observe that the Law of Identity is the only one of the three Laws of Thought which does not depend upon the method of dichotomy. The process of abstraction which is described in the last chapter of the Posterior A nalytics may be said to be an adequate explanation of how we perceive in particu- lars those attributes which in De anima (403 a 25) he calls the X6'yot evvXot. If they are simply essences, forms, eternal qualities, we could perceive them directly, and though the process of how immaterial and eternal beings could get into matter and time is not explained, once they did get there, they could certainly be appre- hended. But this is far from making clear how the particular composite which either may be said to characterize a particular, Socrates, or this horse, or is Socrates or this horse, can be known rather than simply seen. There is nothing corresponding to the haecceitas of Duns Scotus in Aristotle or to Plotinus's view that there are ideas of individuals. On the con- trary, all existence is a surd and he never wearies of repeating the phrase that there is no knowledge of particulars. This in spite of his doctrine that indi- vidual propositions have the logical properties of uni- versals. It is to be sure only common sense to say that we know about Socrates from knowing Socrates, but common sense does not make the same assump- tions which Aristotle makes. In him we have knowl- edge-about through the forms-in-matter and if there is no form-in-matter, we can have no knowledge. Since the forms have certain traits, unity, eternality, and immutability, which by their very nature cannot be found in the mutable world of particulars-with the exception noted above-there is no way of deriving knowledge-about them from knowledge-of them. Trouble of this sort is bound to arise when one assumes that logic is a sort of ontology. When Aristotle says that the truth is that which is and falsity is that which is not," he ties his logic to the structure 11 It is amusing to see how this formula remains in the history of philosophy until modern times. See amongst others Bossuet's 76 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="76">VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] of the world and laudably enough attempts to give an explanation of "factual truth." He wavers between the idea that truth and falsity are traits of judgment and that they are different names for existence and non-existence. By fusing the notions that only simi- lars can stand in the relation of cause to effect and that all change is the realization of potentialities, he thinks presumably that he can join the objective world to the mind without explaining away the vast differences between them. By the first principle he provides the mind with a nous which has characteristics similar to those of the essences; by the second he can always say that the end term in a process is occultly present in the initial term in potentia. In this way the doctrine that there is nothing in the intellect which was not pre- viously in sensation can be retained by arguing that what is in the intellect was potentially, if not actually, in sensation. There is another weakness in any epistemology which makes the objects of knowledge timeless and knowledge itself a reflection or impression of its objects. That is the obvious objection that one of the outstanding traits of at least the world we live in is time. Aristotle, as we have said, confuses the timeless with the everlasting and in the field in which we are at present interested he sees in processes which are cyclical an image of the timeless. Aside from the in- exactitude of maintaining that any individual can ever experience anything which goes on forever-an ob- servation which may be considered pedantic-there is a radical difference between a quality like a color which is the same, let us say, wherever it happens to be and a pattern of change which is repeated. It may be true that the pattern is exactly repeated step by step, but one of its essential features is that there is a before and an after in it. This is not the case with mathe- matical series since in them before and after are in no way temporal. If one eliminate the temporal order from a cycle, it turns into a logical or mathematical formula; it may serve, and indeed usually does serve, as a description of a process, but the fact remains that there is nothing kinetic within it. The verbal symbol for it eliminates precisely that which makes it a process and its truth for that very reason is not a copy of that which it describes. If one were to name Aristotle's theory of knowledge by a modern name, one would call it an iconic theory. Naturally enough such a theory has to assume that the icons are perfect replicas of really real things or are themselves the really real. The really real in Aristotle may be either the essences of classes of things or whatever organization may exist of such essences as they are exemplified in the order of nature. But in spite of his assumption of the epistemological priority of the immutable (Meta- physics, 1063 a 13), of the natural priority of the cause to the effect (Categories, 14 b 12), and of the temporal De la Connaissance de Dieu et de Soi-meme; Le vrai est ce qui est, le faux, ce qui n'est pas (I quote from memory). priority of the potential to the actual (Nichomachean Ethics, 1112 b 23), no citations are needed to show that he also believes that substances in the sense of individ- ual things, which may be the subjects of sentences but never attributes, are equally real. When in the Cate- gories (3 b 10) he says that "All substance seems to mean the individual," though he uses that multivalent term ovaia for substance and speaks of primary sub- stances rather than secondary, he insists that the secondary substances are only apparently substantial. And earlier he had emphatically asserted (ibid., 2 b 5) that if these primary substances, individuals, did not exist, "It would be impossible for any of the others to exist." The reason is that the others, the secondary, must inhere in some matter. Again, in De sophisticis elenchis (169 a 35) it is "to the one and to substance that individuality and being seem especially to belong." But such a being would appear to be an individualized form, that is, a form incorporated, and in De anima (412 a 20) the soul is said to be the form of the body almost immediately after Aristotle has argued that it is a substance "according to definition," that is, it is an essence or final cause. To be a "this somewhat" is never really defined by Aristotle. Quali- ties become particularized by spatial position, but men become particularized by their souls. The former is understandable, even if not very persuasive, for with absolute space and with the necessity for every quality's being somewhere, one can see how a quality would become individuated by space. But spatial positions are themselves unique and are presumably posited as such. Unless the soul were similarly unique and individual in itself, which it is not-since it is a final cause and an essence-only the body could indi- viduate it. And since all human bodies, when they act in accordance with nature, act alike, the amount of individuality which each might possess would be negligible. Furthermore the icons which constitute the material of knowledge cannot be icons of separate individuals, for, if they were, they would serve no more intellectual purpose than percepts do. Nor is there any evidence that Aristotle thought of them as visual symbols, like the emblems of the Renaissance. The locus classicus of Aristotle's theory of substance, in so far as the concept is used metaphysically rather than logically, is in Metaphysics, Zeta, chapters 16 and 17 and Eta, chapters 1 to 4 inclusive. The conclusion of Zeta, chapter 16, is that "no universal is substance nor is any substance made out of substances." In a sentence such as this it is clear that Aristotle could not have meant by "substance" an essence. In Chapter 17 (1041 a 9) substance is a "first principle and a cause." And the conclusion of this chapter is that substances are "natures" and that natures are final causes or purposes of things, for the final cause is the primary cause of the being of anything (ibid., 1041 b 28). The opening of Eta gives us a list of sub- stances. It begins with the elements, continues with COGNITION 77</page><page sequence="77">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE plants and animals, together with their parts, and ends with "heaven and the parts of heaven" (1042 a 10), a list which is repeated from Zeta, chapter 2. Each of these, it will be observed, is or may be considered to be, an individual; at any rate none are attributes. Each, moreover, is open to perceptual inspection. Each is natural, in the sense of not being artificial. As for the substantial nature of ideas and mathematical beings, the discussion of that question is to be post- poned. At this point he introduces the essence (r6 rt Lv tetva) and the substratum also as substances, though the former has no individuality and the latter is everywhere. The point is that any essence, as well as the substratum, may be the subject of a sentence and thus have attributes, in spite of his having said in Zeta, chapter 13, that universals cannot be sub- stances and essences are indubitably universals. But still one can discuss redness or primary matter as if it were "separate" from everything else, and thus gram- matically they can be subjects. Aristotle himself says that the substratum is a substance since "it is an indi- vidual (a this) potentially if not actually" (ibid., 1042 a 27), and that the logos and the form of a thing is a substance since it is separable at least in discussion (r0c X6o7y). But he reverts to his earlier statement of the case by concluding that the compound of matter and form is a substance since it alone has "simply separate existence" (XwpL-rorv airXAw). The separate- ness of substances is here emphasized and by "sepa- rateness" it looks as if Aristotle meant merely things which have a beginning and an end and are also not bound to something else as attributes are bound to their subjects. Of these three the substratum cannot be perceived in itself but only through its attributes; it is something whose existence is demanded by reason- ing to support the attributes. The logos and form- and here Aristotle uses the word for "shape" or struc- ture, rather than the word for final cause-are not perceptible, though a shape in the literal sense of the word might be; yet when conjoined with the logos, which is, I suppose, that which is expressed in a defi- nition, it is an object of thought and has to be ab- stracted from particular experiences. The compound of matter and form is clearly perceptible, but as a per- ceptible entity it is not an object of knowledge. The confusion of ideas in this paragraph is probably attrib- utable to Aristotle's prior confusion of knowledge- about with knowledge-of, description with acquaint- ance, a confusion more commonly found in so-called empiricists than in rationalists. Yet if one is going to try to derive concepts from percepts, one is bound sooner or later to fall victim to this confusion. In the final analysis it reduces to the assumption that cogni- tion is an absorption of external beings into the mind, rather than something which human beings do to external existence. A situation of this type can be understood only by examining the basic metaphors by means of which its nature is expressed. Such English terms as "sensory impression," "sensory apprehension," "sensory per- ception," "immediate knowledge," seem to have arisen out of the idea that a knowing subject is confronted with something external to him which either does something to him, as-to use the ancient figure of speech-a seal makes an impression on wax, or is grasped as a physical object is grasped by the hand, or is reflected as an object is reflected in a mirror. I am not here arguing from etymologies, though I may seem to be doing so, but from what the people who believe in such experiences say about them. To speak about sensory data as if they were given to the knowing sub- ject as they are, in independence of his expectations and other attitudes, is to maintain that immediate knowledge is the simple apprehension of such beings, beings which enter into the mind as if it were a recep- tacle, without changing any of their essential prop- erties. The entrance into the receiving mind seems to have caused no great disquietude on the part of epistemologists, but the alteration of the entrants did. The size of the sensory object as perceived was obvi- ously not that of the size of the physical object as known (cf. De sensu, 448 b 11). For instance, it has always been believed that the physical moon was many thousand times greater in diameter than the perceived lunar disk. It was also known that the size of perceiv- ed objects varied with distance, that the farther away such an object moved, the smaller it became until it vanished. There was also the question of variations in the reports which perceivers gave of what they per- ceived and this seemed peculiar since they were all supposed to be apprehending the same thing. Finally, there were certain perceptual illusions which were known at a very early date, and these would not have been misleading if they had not looked like veridical perceptions. All such remarks are commonplaces and I shall not prolong the inventory. I introduce it simply to suggest the kind of problem which arose because of the assumption that perception was a grasping of entities as they exist outside of the mind. In Aristotle the animal soul was able to grasp the sensible qualities without their matter. The mecha- nism by which this was done need not concern us. Once these beings got into the mind various things could happen to them. The similarity between sensa and images, between images and concepts, made it possible to think that concepts were the sensible species in a new context or form. Dreams could be explained as complexes of sensible species which might or might not have originals in waking life. And by erecting a scale of ideality within the mind, it was possible to think of each rung of the ladder as matter for the rung above it and as form for the rung below. But the trouble here was that usually when matter became actualized into a form there was an inherent difference between the two stages. Not only do chickens not look like eggs but they are not eggs, do 78 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="78">GOOD AND EVIL not behave as eggs do, serve entirely different pur- poses. But when sensible species turned into images or concepts, this seemed hardly to be the case. For once the qualities of the sensible object were skimmed off as sensible species, they lost their matter in the ordinary sense of that word and from then on simply appeared in different mental contexts. It is precisely this ability to appear here and there, even when the spatial terms are metaphorical, that vivifies the resem- blance between the sensible species and things. The various substances which Aristotle lists, plants, ani- mals, and their parts have definite spatial frontiers at any one time and, though plants are not naturally movable through space, yet they can be sharply cut off from the medium in which they live, air and earth. They are individuals, not universals. They can be the subjects of sentences and are never attributes. It would seem likely that when Aristotle speaks of the logos and form of a thing as a substance, he was con- ceiving it as a thing in this manner. Now if there could be no error in the apprehension of sensible species, there should be no error in the apprehension of anything else as long as it is merely seen, contemplated, immediately observed. And Aristotle seems to realize this when he insists that error arises in synthesis. The synthesis is made by the knowing mind in the form of judgments, for the union of several qualities by the common sense is not synthesis in this sense of the word. Such judgments are attributions of predicates to a subject. It is at this moment that knowledge-of turns into knowledge- about. But the change is not merely the actualization of a potency, for in such cases, unless something happens contrary to nature, there would be no possi- bility of error. Knowledge-about or judgment is an act of the mind committed in partial independence of the objects which it might be contemplating. In his own terminology, though what I say must not be attributed to him, knowledge-about would be the cor- relative of knowledge-of, as an action is correlative to a passion. But as soon as one says that, the scale of gradual actualizations has to be abandoned. Sensible species turning step by step into concepts demands no interference from a judging mind. It could occur by itself under appropriate conditions. That is why the nous and the noumenon may become identical. It would probably not be a falsification of the Aris- totelian epistemology to say that just as chance or force may prevent the realization of natural potencies in the non-psychic world, so judgment may do the same in the psychic. Unfortunately, Aristotle is not worried about this problem and is content to dwell upon the eternality and immutability of the noetic objects. If they really are eternal and immutable, and if, moreover, they are identical with the contem- plative nous, then no force or chance could affect them. And what is worse, there could be no question of the truth or falsity of such knowledge, for its objects, though in some mysterious fashion translatable into descriptions of the world of experience, are not them- selves to be found in that world. They are as sepa- rate (xcpLts) as any idea of Plato's. Consequently, to classify Aristotle as an empiricist is extremely mis- leading, since we have his word for it that no knowl- edge is possible of what modern philosophers call experience. Added to his own admissions, we have enough theoretical obstacles to make such an inter- pretation impossible. This could have been seen by anyone willing to read the texts and think through the problem. But since the time of Hegel it was thought necessary that Plato's pupil provide an antithesis to his master's philosophy. VI. GOOD AND EVIL 1. THE GOODNESS OF THE NATURAL Assumptions which are either overt statements of the goodness of the natural or which reduce to an identification of goodness with the natural have already been discussed in our chapter on Nature, section 3. There is no point in repeating them here. We have concluded that as a general rule the natural is better than the unnatural. The question now arises of just what goods nature would give to mankind, or more precisely what goods Aristotle assumes she would give to mankind. 2. THE GOODNESS OF ACTION In De anima (430 a 18) it is said without proof that to act is nobler than to be acted upon. To be acted upon (raicxvE) is the correlative of to act (7roLtEv) and since the only being in the universe who is never acted upon is the Unmoved Mover, there must be one being which never acts but is always acted upon, the Sub- stratum. Between these two termini of the universe of beings everything both acts and is acted upon. Hence, if to be acted upon is less noble than to act, it is not because it is less natural in the sense of being less usual. But the kind of action of which Aristotle was thinking is the life of reason. This appears of course in his discussion of happiness. And if that life approaches thinking about thinking, then it will have approximated the activity of the Unmoved Mover and there will be something very close to action without passion. There will be even action without any object external to it, a sort of intransitive activity, if such a phrase is not a contradiction in terms. The assignment of this value to action, coupled with the idea of a scale of beings, would give added reason for reading into the order of nature a hierarchy of values. For it might be maintained that as one went up the scale one came upon more and more activity. The notion of degrees of activity naturally raises the question of how one being can be more active than another. There are at least two possibilities here, one VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] 79</page><page sequence="79">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE of which we can be fairly certain was not in Aristotle's mind. That possibility is the measurement of activity in terms of the number of times in a career a being is active or passive. A man given over to his animal nature might be considered to be less active than one who spends most of his time in philosophic discourse. If I say that this is probably not Aristotle's measure, it is because it seems that pure activity, as exemplified both in the life of the active reason and that of the Unmoved Mover, is timeless. Thinking about think- ing is not a temporal activity at all and consequently there can be no "more or less" in the sense of duration. Moreover, if time is defined as the measure of motion, there would have to be a kinetic factor in thinking in order for its temporal span to be measured, and, as I say, there is none. The second possibility might reside in the extent to which a species-or perhaps even an individual-was independent of external con- ditions in realizing its form.1 But first we must inves- tigate just what "to act" denotes in Aristotle. The two correlatives, to act and to be acted upon, are, as is well known, categories. When the terms are introduced in the Categories (2 a 3), they are defined solely by grammatical examples: "to cut," "to burn," vs. "to be cut," "to be burned." In Chapter 9 of the same work, it is pointed out that action and passion both admit of contraries and also of variations of degree. The influence of Greek grammar is noticeable here, since "to burn" is the opposite of "to be burned" only as the active and passive voices of the verb are opposites. But it is clear, one hopes, that the opposi- tion makes itself felt only as a subject is given to the verb. A man may either burn something else or be burned by something else, but, since Aristotle never thinks of events other than as attached to a subject or substance which may act as agent or be the target of another agent's activity, the grammatical factor can- not be dismissed as irrelevant or trivial. Hence what- ever else activity and passivity are, they are intelligible only as they have agents and patients "understood." For clearly to an outside observer it is indifferent whether a man is burning something else or being burned by something, as long as the observer is inter- ested in oxidation, and not in, let us say, the treatment of burns or the prevention of fires. A chemist might well say that all burning is simply a form of oxidation and that is the end of it. But this would be nonsense to Aristotle, for he could not imagine fire breaking out simply because of the interaction of two substances under certain conditions. On the contrary, there must be an agent to be the efficient cause of the burn- ing, an agent which was not itself an integral element 1 A third possibility, which we shall not discuss, is to measure activity in terms of the absence of passivity. Thus the planets are less passive than plants, for they are acted upon only by the Unmoved Mover, whereas plants are subject to the action, such as it is, of the elements, animals, men, the heavenly bodies, and of course the Unmoved Mover. in the oxidation; otherwise the event would not take place. This is the more obvious when we read the parts of De generatione et corruptione (Book I, chapters 7-9) which make a detailed analysis of the problems in- volved in the presence of these two categories. These problems turn out to be "what action and passion are, to what things they happen, by what and how, and how they are possible" (324 b 22). The analysis begins with an account of what certain of Aristotle's predecessors said on the question of what kinds of terms could sustain this relation. And their views are taken up only in so far as they touch upon the question of whether only similars or dissimilars can act upon each other. This reduces the categories themselves to causal categories and even a superficial reading of the text will show that Aristotle is thinking here of action as the production of a change of some sort in a patient. His conclusion is that one must not confuse total similarity with partial similarity. He argues that if two beings are totally alike in every respect, one cannot in any way be acted upon by the other (323 b 19). His first proof of this is that there would be no more reason for one to act than for the other, but he does not tell us here what he means by a reason. Unfortunately he puts this in the form of a rhetorical question without stating any of the reasons why things do act upon one another. His second proof is even more strange, for he says that if two similar things could affect each other, a thing might act upon itself and "there would be nothing indestructible or immov- able (immutable)" (323 b 23). And presumably he believes either that everyone would grant that there is something indestructible or that he has already proved such a being's existence. At any rate we can see that in this part of his argument he is thinking of action as that which an efficient cause does to some- thing. This also appears to be true in what follows, for he there introduces a presupposition which we have already listed in our chapter on change, that only con- traries and not anything whatsoever can sustain the relation in question. His conclusion is that, since contraries are found only within a given genus, the agent and the patient must be alike generically but unlike specifically, so that "it is obvious that agents and patients are opposite to each other and also inter- mediaries; for every case of destruction and genesis occurs in these" (324 a 8). It would be easy to build upon this foundation a theory of morals which identified the good with causal activity, bringing about changes, such as might be found in artistry, in medicine, in statesmanship. Such a theory might not go so far as to preach "the strenu- ous life," but it would still be far from the contem- plative life which Aristotle extols in the Nichomachean Ethics. But lest we read into Aristotle more incon- sistency than the text reveals, it should be pointed out that in a treatise on generation and corruption he 80 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="80">GOOD AND EVIL could scarcely be expected to think of action and passion otherwise than as forms of kinesis. This would not imply that the two categories were not also found in other domains. Nevertheless, the kinetic example is repeated in this treatise even in reference to the Unmoved Mover who is a final cause. "That which moves," he says (324 a 26), "has a double meaning. For that in which the source of motion is seems to move (for the source of motion is the first of the causes) and again that which is the last term in relation to the moved and to the process of coming- into-being (genesis)." In motion the first mover may be unmoved while the last "always moves when moved." Similarly the first agent need not be affected while acting, whereas the last agent acts only when acted upon. This is once more an indication that for Aristotle causation is not inherently a reciprocal rela- tion. The physician, he says, is like the first agent; he acts without being acted upon. The drug acts by being acted upon. It is acted upon by the body into which it is introduced. The notion that somehow or other a cause can be unaffected by the events which it causes is essential to his whole philosophy and it reappears throughout western philosophy over and over again. One of its most dramatic appearances, outside of theology, is in discussions about freedom of the will. For in many such discussions, if the human will is swayed by any cause outside itself, it loses its freedom to that extent; it must be self-caused, abso- lutely autonomous. How .such a state differs from caprice, I have not discovered. Now which are the agents which may act without being acted upon? They are (324 b 4) "those which do not have their form in matter." One would imagine that those beings whose forms are not in matter would be limited to the active reason and the Unmoved Mover. But, it will be recalled, both the active reason and the Unmoved Mover are final causes and Aristotle immediately points out that the final cause is not active (324 b 14), except metaphorically. Are we then to say that the final cause of human life, the active reason, and the final cause of the cosmos, the Unmoved Mover, in spite of their names are passive?2 Such a conclusion would run counter to everything which Aristotle says of them when he speaks of them. Yet in this place he insists that "forms and ends are states (geLs)." And a state is a condition in which something is; it is not a process of becoming something. Consequently it cannot act. We can only conclude either that Aristotle had for- gotten what he said about the Unmoved Mover as the final cause of the cosmos or had not yet said it. And when he did say it, he apparently forgot what he had 2 I realize that the precise term, "active reason," does not occur in Aristotle, but he does speak of what all historians call by that name as "impassive," and that can mean nothing other than "active." said in this place.3 Or, it goes without saying, this passage could be rejected as spurious. Moreover, though both the active reason and the Unmoved Mover are "states," in the sense of not being processes, they are not states in the sense of being states of any- thing other than themselves. How now is it possible for there to be action and passion ? Here Aristotle discusses the mechanism by which effects are brought about. After a lengthy criticism of his predecessors, he gives his own theory (Book I, chapter 9). First, he points out that it is in so far as something has a given quality in potentia, that it can be acted upon throughout and not merely in certain of its parts. But it may be "more or less"-poten- tially-of a given quality; the degree of potentiality, as exemplified by Aristotle, is the possession in a mixture of substances of parts which are potentially of the quality in question. But this is simply a special case in which the principle is not changed. For such parts are as a whole capable of realizing their potenti- alities. The process of becoming something due to the action of an agent therefore is simply the process of the realization of a form. But this cannot occur, we learn (327 a 1), if the supposed patient is "naturally composite and one," for in that case it is impassive. One might imagine that any composite, whether natural or artificial, could be broken down into its parts, as a living organism could have its head chopped off. But Aristotle does not explain his meaning here. Moreover, no change of this type can be brought about unless the agent is in contact with the patient or in contact with a medium which in turn is in contact with the patient-the principle of no action at a distance. If contact is to be established between agent and patient, once again we see that Aristotle here can be thinking only of material agents and hence of changes or effects which happen to material things. As for the latter, we already know that immaterial beings are by nature impassive, but we have been given reason to think that they are essentially active and yet they cannot touch anything. Aristotle is himself somewhat ill at ease over this question of contact. Before bringing up the larger question of what action and passion are, he had said that contact could be predicated only of such things as are in space (322 b 33). Such beings all have both weight and lightness, or one or the other (323 a 8). But then there is the problem of the mover which is not itself moved. Such movers cannot act if to act is to cause alteration, that is, qualitative change. But, he continues, to move may mean more than to act, 3 According to Jaeger, op. cit., 139, the Unmoved Mover as "transcendental," guiding the world "as its final cause, by reason of the perfection of his pure thought," is the "original nucleus of Aristotelian metaphysics." But in his "later meta- physics" the Unmoved Mover is still "immaterial and separated from the world as pure Form." On this particular point there was in Jaeger's opinion no change throughout Aristotle's career. VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] 81</page><page sequence="81">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE and presumably a mover can move without acting in the technical sense. In general, that is, within ordi- nary experience, there is reciprocal contact between mover and moved. But where there is an unmoved mover, it can touch what it moves without being touched by it. Then comes the pun to which we have alluded before: "We say sometimes that a man's grief touches us but not that we ourselves touch him" (323 a 32). This type of evidence does not seem very convincing, for like most philosophical punning it evades the issue. The basic trouble in this argument is Aristotle's insistence upon his assumption of natural opposition in which the two poles must be kept com- pletely apart and of antithetical properties. But what seems specially strange is that, though here he insists on action being of narrower extension than moving, yet when he deals with action and passion his only examples are of moving and being moved. One can in this case, as indeed in the case of most assumptions, only guess at why action seemed nobler to Aristotle than passion. The probability is that an agent is closer to autarky, in so far as it is not acted upon, than a patient. Such a phrase as "closer to autarky" is of course open to serious criticism, since it might be thought that independence of external things was not subject to degree. But if activity and passivity do not form a reciprocal relation and some- thing can be active without being acted upon, as is apparently his belief, then one could at least imagine that possible agents might be arranged in a series from the substratum to the Unmoved Mover such that those agents nearest the former were dependent on more things external to themselves than those nearest the latter. There is, however, no textual evidence for this. But when one considers the active reason, one sees that in the opinion of its inventor it mirrors the nature of the Unmoved Mover, while nevertheless being the actuality of the body. Its independence is something which it achieves if the person to whom it belongs has attained happiness. The microcosm con- tains all four elements in physiological form,4 the three organic kingdoms, and the active reason, just as the macrocosm does. If then man's active reason ap- proaches the kind of life which is found in the Unmoved Mover, one has some sort of evidence for its nobility. But the question still remains of whether the Unmoved Mover is the pattern of the highest good because he is active or because he is that for which the cosmos exists. If the latter, it is final causes which justify all activity, and one cannot argue that activity is in itself a good. 3. THE SUPERIORITY OF THE WHOLE TO THE PART In discussing monarchy and those men who are fit to be kings and to be governed by kings (Politics, Book III, chapter 17), Aristotle says that the whole is by nature superior to the part and adds that the man 4 That is, the four humors. of great virtue who is fit for kingship is as the whole to the part. Thus, the active reason, being the final cause of the human being, and the Unmoved Mover, being the final cause of the cosmos, are both in the position of kings and represent the whole.5 In the Metaphysics (1023 b 26) he makes a distinction be- tween a whole which is a "natural whole," none of whose parts are missing and "a universal which contains its members so that they form a unity." A natural whole would presumably be exemplified by individual plants and animals. The superiority of a universal to its particulars and that of the "organic" whole to its parts is probably based on their unity, for, as we have said above, Aristotle also assumes that unity is better than variety. In accordance with this he says in the Politics (1252 b 3) that every instrument is best when it is made for one purpose.6 In the natural order each process has one and only one pur- pose or final cause; the assignment of several purposes to things is made by transforming an accident into a final cause. It is the unity of natural ends which in the long run makes general laws possible. Hence the notion that wholes are inherently better than parts is derived from their unity and the value given to unity, it would seem reasonable to say, is derived from the ways of Nature. This would also be true of wholes which are uni- versals. The universal, Mankind, may be said to be inherently better than any man since all men naturally strive to attain the perfection of Mankind. That is what living in accordance with nature means. When in the Poetics (1451 b 5) Aristotle says that poetry is more philosophical and more serious than history, he gives as his reason that poetry expresses the universal and history the particular. It utilizes probability or necessity to tell how a person of a given sort will act rather then telling how an actual historical person did act. It therefore approaches scientific knowledge in the information which it communicates, rather than opinion or perception. And thus its imitation of nature is imitation of the universal. This appraisal of poetry is therefore analogous to his appraisal of science and philosophy. One could construct the following argument to sum up his views on this subject. 1. The natural is better than the unnatural. 2. But natural processes are the attainment of purposes. 5 Something of this sort may have been in the back of his mind when he said that plot was the most important part of a tragedy, for plot is a brief summary of the whole drama. 6 Yet he points out (De partibus animalium, 659 a 18) that the elephant uses its trunk both as nostril and forefeet; that the human tongue is used for the perception of savors and also for speech; that the mouth in general is used for alimentation and also for a weapon, speech, and respiration (662 a 20); that tails both cover the anus and also serve other unspecified purposes. Yet where it is possible, there is but one use for each part (683 a 20). But when is it not possible? Cf. in this connection De respiratione, 476 a 17. 82 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="82">GOOD AND EVIL 3. These purposes are homogeneous within any natural class. 4. When abstracted from the world of observation, they are universals. 5. These universals are both wholes and units, as distinguished from particulars which are collections of more or less diverse things. 6. They may be incorporated both in natural beings and in products of artistry, both of which, since they contain matter, will never be perfect. 7. But since we should aim at perfection, we must try as far as possible to purge ourselves and the prod- ucts of our artistry of all imperfections. 8. We shall thus make them more whole and unified and therefore more in accordance with nature. I trust that it is unnecessary to point out that this argument is nowhere found in Aristotle in this form. That human life and all particulars are imperfect in the Aristotelian sense of that term needs no proof. But what requires some discussion is why, if "the world (ra oTra) does not wish to be governed badly" (Metaphysics, 1076 a 4) and good government is mon- archy, Nature's aims should ever be frustrated. If they are frustrated from time to time, and they are, then one might accept a dualistic ontology with two "principles," one making for unity, the other for diversity and multiplicity. Or one might accept the world of multiplicity as the only "real" world and develop an epistemology capable of handling it. The distinction between what ought to be and what is need not be a metaphysical distinction; it can always remain a distinction within the realm of human desires. That the world or that nature gives us a standard of what ought to be and that the standard is not to be found in what is seem at best paradoxical. The paradox was attenuated in Plato since he frankly admitted that the Ideas were separated from facts which were but a faint copy of reality. He did not say, as we all learn early in our career as students of philosophy, that the ideal world was embedded in matter while the material world was far from being what it ought to be. The substantialization of such concepts as Chance is of no help in this particular situation since the forms in Aristotle are inherently present in natural objects. In art to be sure the case is different, but we are not talking about art when we are discussing the laws of nature. Works of art may imitate natural objects and artistry may imitate natural processes of actualization, but in spite of that artistry is a human practice and its laws are subject to the desires of men. But nature, even when the term includes human nature, is said to be invariable and its invariability is what permits us to have sciences. Consequently one would expect Aristotle to elaborate a set of general theorems which would be only accidentally true to fact. But if he had done so, he would have had to abandon his theory of abstraction. To save truth to fact he assumed (a) the strict parallelism between existence and knowl- edge, (b) a universe of things or substances, and (c) the determination of essence and accidents "by nature" rather than by convention. But these as- sumptions were not sufficient to provide a logic which would meet the exigencies of thinking as well as those of being. In general, as is well known, he believed logical sentences to be composed of a subject and predicate joined by a copula which could be modified only by negation. But in De interpretatione (chapter 12-13) he introduced modal qualifications of the copula, possibility and necessity, impossibility and probability. But when one changes the sentence, "Peter is a musician," into "Peter may be a musician," or "Peter must be a musician," one is not qualifying either the subject or the predicate but the verb. And one might even maintain that this modification refers to the doubts of the man who made the judgment and not to "the facts" at all. In the Metaphysics the analysis of the term "unity" is much more extended than the analysis of the term "a whole." In Book Delta, chapter 6, we have first a distinction between that which is one by its own nature and that which is accidentally one. The latter are simply subjects plus their non-essential attributes. The former are roughly speaking grammatical subjects, whether composed by art or brought into existence by nature; substrata, whether elemental or derivative from the elements; members of a given genus, even when belonging to different species; things which have the same definition, for the definition expresses the essence of things; things which have a single form. Summing up (Metaphysics, 1016 b 31) Aristotle says that things may be one in number, in species (or perhaps form), in genus, or by analogy. Examples of these are matter, definitions (logoi) which state the essences of things, things grouped under the same category, and the things that bear a likeness to other things. Since in all these examples Aristotle uses the word "one" to define what he means by units, it is clear that he is simply engaging in a lexicographical exercise. This is understandable in that the book from which the examples are taken is usually inter- preted as a philosophical lexicon, not as a metaphysical investigation. Yet in the first chapter of Book Iota, Aristotle attempts to find something common to all these mean- ings. This primary meaning turns out to be (1052 b 18) "the first measure of each kind of thing and above all of quantity." This would seem to mean that all meanings of "unity" are derivative from a unit of quantity. But Aristotle no sooner impresses this upon us than he also says that "in all cases we seek as the measure something which is one and indivisible; and this is the simple either in quality or in quantity" (ibid., line 33). The qualitative units are no doubt undifferentiated percepts, patches of color, notes, savors, textures, much like the sensa of recent Anglo- American "realists." It is the undifferentiated sim- VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] 83</page><page sequence="83">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE plicity of the quality which gives it its unity. But just how the qualitative unit measures quality and in what sense of the word a quality can be measured is left unexplained. The discussion continues, in spite of the obscurity, by pointing out that unity like being is a universal predicate and not a substance. (Nevertheless, he has used it as the grammatical subject of several sen- tences.) A thing cannot just be a unit; it has to be a unit of something or other. Similarly, one might add, a thing cannot just be; it has to be something or other. Like being, unity has as many meanings as there are categories and the categories differentiate these mean- ings, and "the being of the one is the being of the individual" (ibid., 1054 a 19). This reduces unity to a characteristic of particulars. If we assume that such particulars are wholes, then the superiority of the one may be simply the superiority of the whole to its parts. But if the one is nothing more than a measure of some- thing, then the measure is better than that which it measures, on the analogy perhaps of the superiority of the agent to the patient. But of this we cannot be certain, since Aristotle, like most traditional philoso- phers, sees a positive value in unity regardless of what is unified. The triumph of monotheism over poly- theism, with its use of adjectives derived from unity as terms of praise, is a good illustration, if any is needed, of how men have invested a numerical term with value-connotations.7 In the eighth book of the Physics (259 a 8) where Aristotle is describing the Unmoved Mover, the ques- tion was raised whether there is one or several such beings. He argues that "we must think of him as one rather than many and finite rather than infinite. Other things being equal, the limited should be pre- ferred. For in natural things there ought to be the limited and the better, as far as possible. And it is sufficient that there be one, the first of the unmoved who, being eternal, will be the source of motion in the others." Here the Principle of Parsimony comes into play, but it is also clear that Aristotle reads into the notion of the finite and unified a value greater than 7 See of course Plotinus, Ennead III, viii, 9 and VI, ix. But this praise of unity became a commonplace even in religious and pseudo-religious literature. I see no reason to cite more than one or two passages. See, for instance, the Prayer for the Church Militant in the Book of Common Prayer, "The spirit of truth, unity, and concord." Or Robert Bridges' Hymn of Nature, "Live thou thy life beneath the making sun/Till Beauty, Truth, and Love in thee are one." Finally, there is the well-known conclusion of Tennyson's In Memoriam, "One God, one law, one element, And one far-off divine event/To which the whole crea- tion moves." Or should I perhaps quote from Onward Christian Soldiers the verses, "We are not divided,/All one body we...," lines ironically enough, written by a Protestant. The fusion of everything real and good into a unity is far from being the general doctrine of the Old Testament, in so far as there is one general doctrine in an anthology of that sort, and there are only hints of such a fusion in Saint Paul. I suppose that the first explicit statement of the idea is in Plotinus, though the Neo-Pythagoreans may have anticipated him. that which may exist in the infinite and multiple. There are, to be sure, other arguments for the existence of one Unmoved Mover, but they do not concern us here. For it is clear that whatever is natural must be the better of two possibilities, no matter what other arguments may arise. It is impossible, one suspects, for Aristotle to imagine anything natural which is bad, in spite of Nature's mistakes and failures, and for that reason alone there must be only one Unmoved Mover. That the first cause of all things must be "divine," appears also in Theophrastus (Metaphysics, 4 b 15) and throughout the Pseudo-Aristotelian De mundo. But why there should be a first cause, in view of the great mixture in the world of good and evil, homo- geneity and heterogeneity, is not raised by Aristotle, though it is by his disciple, Theophrastus.8 In general it is probably not much of an exaggera- tion to conclude that Aristotle's main assumption about the good is that the good is the natural. The goodness of action rather than passion, of the whole and of unity rather than the part and multiplicity, follow from this or are interpretations of it. Just what was natural and what not, is hardly so easy to say. For, if the natural is the cosmic order, we have to have more details about that order before we can state in any concreteness just what Aristotle had in mind when he identified the natural and the good. If it is "that which happens on the whole," then all the information which we have about it is that it does happen on the whole. If it is the process of realizing potentialities, then we have merely the information that when a potentiality is realized, something good has been achieved. The qualifications of activity, wholeness, and unity give us little additional guidance, for nothing this side of the Unmoved Mover is purely active, purely whole, and purely unified. And though one might urge men to imitate the Unmoved Mover as far as possible, it is a grave question whether the impedi- ments to a complete imitation can be removed by them. The problem of strengthening the will to the point where one can overcome the limitations of ter- restrial or, if one prefer, corporeal life, is not raised by Aristotle, as it was to be raised by the so-called ethical schools and later by the Patristics. He seemed to think, though he nowhere says so, that to know the good is to do it. VII. HIERARCHIES Unlike the other chapters in this study, this chapter will be on something which Aristotle did not assume, the existence of hierarchies. There are many passages in his works which can be made the foundation of a hierarchical universe, but it is one thing to infer from 8 Op. cit., 8 a 21. As a matter of fact, Theophrastus has doubts about many of his master's conclusions, if not of his assumptions. His Metaphysics is made up of a list of problems which were left unsettled by Aristotle. 84 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL.

THE CONCEPT OF A HIERARCHY The word "hierarchy" itself in Greek is first found in Pseudo-Dionysius and in a Boeotian inscription (apud Boeck, Volume I, p. 749). It does not occur in classical Greek. In Pseudo-Dionysius it is found in the titles of his two most famous books, The Celestial Hierarchy and The Ecclesiastical Hierarchy. Etymo- logically it means power over sacred things and a hierarch is a priest. The fact that the word is recorded for the first time so late in intellectual history would not in itself mean that the idea it names was new; in fact, the idea was not new in the fifth century for it had been expounded by Plotinus in the third. The Boeotian inscription does no more than use the word hierarch and, as far as is known, Greek priests were not organized into a single ecclesia such as we now have in the Roman Catholic and other episcopal churches. Pseudo-Dionysius, it is probable, got the idea of a celestial hierarchy of angels and of an ecclesiastical hierarchy of the religious modeled upon it from some Neo-Platonist, but that is no more than probable. Plotinus himself, in whose works there are three hier- archies, the logical, the ontological, and the axiological, may have derived the idea from the Egyptian priest- hood. But all such matters are purely conjectural. The earliest reference to an ecclesiastical hierarchy which is published with the approval of the Church is in the Clementine Epistle to the Corinthians, pre- sumably a first century document. There we find the simple statement that Christ sent forth the Apostles to preach the Gospel throughout the earth and that they instituted bishops and deacons under them1 This is of course not the outline of a complete hier- archy from the Pope to the catechumens, but never- theless hints at ecclesiastical rank. In the Epistle of Cornelius I, 'tva B6 yv-s, to Fabius, Bishop of Antioch (third century), we find it set forth that there is one supreme bishop, the Bishop of Rome, 46 presbyters, seven deacons, seven sub-deacons, 42 acolytes, 52 exorcists, and 52 lectors, together with sextons and thousands of widows and paupers.2 This simply indi- cates ranks without stating what the relationship of power or rule was amongst them. A similar list is found in the canons of the Lateran Council (seventh century) where the heretics, Theodorus, Cyrus, Sergius, Pyrrhus, and Paul are anathematized; it runs, bishops, presbyters, deacons, monks and laymen.3 Finally, at the Council of Trent in the session of July 15, 1563, in the canons on the sacrament of ordination, 1 See Denziger's Enchiridion, 42, Friburgi Brisgoviae, Herder, 13th ed., 1921. 2 Ibid., 45. 3 Ibid., 272. we find the words, Si quis dixerit, in Ecclesia catholica non esse hierarchiam divina ordinatione institutam, quae constat ex episcopis, presbyteris et ministris: A.S.4 But by this time there was no question that the hierarchy was one in which power extended downward from the Pope to the laymen through the ranks of the religious. This is a hierarchy of which the best modern and secular example is in the armed services, where the upper ranks have power over the lower and where the lower have none over the upper-except illegitimately -and where the number of potentates grows smaller and smaller as one goes up the ladder until there is one supreme commander. Let us call this a hierarchy of power. A hierarchy of power is also a hierarchy of prestige by the very nature of things. And when the power is taken away, as it has been in England, or as it was during the period of the Shoguns in Japan, and trans- ferred to others, the prestige remains. Rank may still be an important factor in social problems, as anyone who has ever had any contact with the diplomatic service knows, and though it may have been deter- mined historically by the power appertaining to it, it does not lose its importance when that power is lost. Mediaeval literature is full of references to dignitates and it seems to have been assumed that each level of the hierarchy contained an inherent value. This was not merely a question of the privileges which would be given to a human being of a certain rank but to things themselves, for it was easy apparently to transfer the concept of levels of power and worth from people to arts, sciences, the senses, the organic kingdoms, and to whatever might be arranged in levels. But now the question arises of what a level is when no power is involved. There are two historically prevalent ways of determining a level, one through an elaboration of the logical hierarchy, the other through the notion of degrees of value. The logical hierarchy as we know it comes to us as a series of classes and classes of classes according to which individuals are grouped into species, species into genera, genera into groups of genera, continuing until one reaches what is believed to be the all-inclusive class. In modern biology we find this sort of thing exemplified on a less than cosmic scale in the King- doms, Phyla, Classes, Orders, Families, Genera, Species, and Sub-species. This may be said to be based on a logical hierarchy in that as one goes up- wards the extension of the class increases and the in- tension decreases. Its original is probably the famous Tree of Porphyry, expounded in his Introduction to the Categories of Aristotle and passed on to Latin Europe in the translation of Boethius. The Tree, as outlined by Porphyry, runs from Substance to Material Sub- stance, to Animate Material Substance, to Rational Animate Material Substance, to individual men, 4 Ibid., 966. See also the Index systematicus, II a. VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] 85</page><page sequence="85">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE Socrates and Plato. The principle of division is always dichotomous and Porphyry points out that the differentiations which give rise to the less inclusive classes must be inseparable accidents, such as the snubness of a nose, or the blindness of eyes, thus following Aristotle closely as far as this detail is con- cerned (e.g., Metaphysics, 1025 b 30). The inclusion of individuals in the Tree is peculiar since there is clearly no logical way of dividing up rational animals so as to reach Plato and Socrates. Such a principle of division would have to give us both individuation and existence and in Aristotle both are logical surds. This was apparently overlooked by Porphyry as it was by most mediaeval philosophers up to the thirteenth century. A third hierarchy is a hierarchy of value, as we have said. This is so common to human thinking that it requires no detailed comment. Everyone in all prob- ability likes some things better than others or thinks that he should like some things better than others whether he does so or not. Scales of preference could be roughly sketched out by most of us, though whether we could fill in the pattern completely from those things which we consider to be the worst up to those which we consider to be the best is doubtful. But both moral and aesthetic criticism often take the form of pointing out just about where in the scale a given act or a given work of art is to be placed. In ethical matters the position might be of some vital impor- tance, for a decision about what course to take might well depend upon the relative value of two or more courses of action. In aesthetic matters it is at least of some importance to the critic or perhaps even to the artist to know whether tragedy is a higher form of literature than comedy or whether King Lear is supe- rior to Hamlet. How the relative values are deter- mined need not concern us here; the one point which is of interest is the ranking of a series of things from lowest to highest in value. A final hierarchy is the hierarchy of "reality." In Neo-Platonism it is clear that the Way up was a gradual ascent of a scale of value. The Ens perfectis- simum was also the Ens realissimum. Just what it means for something to be real without being qualified in some manner or other, that is, without being a real this, is doubtful. But in any event from at least the third century the concept of degrees of reality was common. In Plotinus to be "really real" meant to be eternal, immaterial, immutable, and unified. Since there was always a confusion between the timeless and the everlasting, it was easy to find things which lasted longer than other things, their "natures" remaining unchanged. And it was excusable, if somewhat pathetic, to believe that this type of persistence was nobler than mutability. One could make out a good case for believing that even the earliest philosophers were seeking something which did not change as the rock upon which to build their universes. The escape from time, which involved change, was contrived in a variety of ways, by finding some material substance underlying the perceived changes in things, by inter- preting the world through the reason's findings rather than through those of perception, by looking for mathematical laws which would point to an immutable structure of whatever changes were actually found, and of course by a special intuition such as was sought by the various types of mystic. The conflict between mutable experience and immutable knowledge was faced by almost all the Ancients as it has been by most of the modern philosophers. If the real is equated with the durable, then, as we say, it is at least theoretically possible to organize a series of things or types of thing in order of durability On the one extreme one would have the momentary, on the other the everlasting. Whether there would be some other trait of the two extremes which would unify them is another question which cannot be settled a priori. In other words, is it inevitable that the everlasting be also immaterial, divine, and so on, and if so, does it follow that there is only one example of such being? Similarly, do all momentary things have some other common traits, such as materiality? Once these questions are answered, the further question arises usually, though there is no logical compulsion to answer it, of whether the real is to be equated with the good. And the usual answer is in the affirmative. The outstanding case of a philosopher who could not accept this identification is Schopenhauer who both believed that the Will to Live was the one reality in the cosmos and also that it was inherently evil. We shall now try to see whether Aristotle assumed principles which entailed any of these hierarchies. 2. THE HIERARCHY OF POWER One would expect to find such an idea above all in the Politics, but throughout that treatise the basic idea of government is the direct rule of a governor or group of governors upon the governed. Between the king, the aristocrats, and the demos on the one hand, and those whom they are governing there is no series whatsoever of officials having less and less power as they approach the level of the people. The state seems to be modeled after the family in which the father is supreme ruler over his wife, his children, and his slaves. In good forms of government they rule for the good of their subjects, but the subjects are not organized according to the power which they might exercise. The nearest approach to a hierarchy of power on the cosmic plane is the relation between the Unmoved Mover and the spheres. In Metaphysics, Lambda, chapter 8, we have the demonstration that there must be one Unmoved Mover for the whole world and a reference to Physics, Book VIII, chapters 8 and 9, as well as to De caelo, Books I, chapter 2 and II, chapters 86 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="86">HIERARCHIES 3 to 8, where it is demonstrated that each of the planets must have its own mover who is unmoved and eternal. The number of the spheres, Aristotle con- cludes (Metaphysics, 1074 a 10), is fifty-five, if we include the spheres which move the sun and moon. This, he says (ibid., line 15) is probable and adds that the demonstration of its necessity must be left to men of greater power. In chapter 10 of the same book he goes on to say that the world is an organic whole (1075 a 16): "All things are connected together some- how, but not in the same way, fishes and birds and plants." The situation is compared to that of a household where the freemen may act as they will but most things serve their purposes, whereas the slaves and animals do not share in the common good but, one might add, help in its realization. It will be ob- served that as far as this passage goes, all that has been accomplished is (1) the statement that things in the universe are somehow or other connected, (2) that there is one being, a substance, which rules the uni- verse, (3) that each planet has a mover of its own, and (4) that their motions are caused by final, not efficient, causes. Physics, Book VIII, chapter 8, builds up the argu- ment that the only continuous motion is circular and that it is unified; it alone can go on forever. Chapter 9 points out that such motion is prior to all others, in nature, in definition, in time, "for the perfect is prior to the imperfect and the everlasting to the perishable" (265 a 22). The passages in De caelo to which we have referred demonstrate first that there is a motion sepa- rate from and different from the motions of the four elements and their composites and that its nature is nobler in so far as it is distant from the things here below (269b 15). Second (Chapter4), it is argued that the shape of the heaven is spherical and that its motion is the swiftest of all motions. Third (Chapter 5), its direction is the best of directions. Fourth (Chapter 6), its motion is regular. Aristotle's conclusion then about the heaven is that it is everlasting, having no beginning and about to have no end, and also that its movement is regular. Chapter 8 takes up the motions of the stars. Aristotle concludes that they move with the circles to which they are attached. But they are not self-moved. Each circle has its own inherent motion. Nothing in any of these passages would lead one to believe that the motion of the Unmoved Mover is passed on to the outermost of the spheres, that there- upon its motion is passed on to the next and so on down to the earth. As a matter of fact, if the motion imparted by the Unmoved Mover is that of attraction, then each sphere must be thought of as trying to imitate the immobility of the Unmoved Mover. Aristotle does indeed raise the question of why the entire body of the heaven is not like the outermost sphere (286 a 12) and answers that at the center of a rotating sphere there must be something at rest. That something is the earth. But this does not explain why the planetary motions are sometimes retrograde, an observed, not deduced, fact which is the cause of his calculating that the number of spheres is fifty-five. The periodic generation and destruction of things below the moon is explained by the annual motion of the sun in the ecliptic (De generatione et corruptione, Book II, chapter 10), which is now nearer to the earth, now farther from it. But that is a dif- ferent problem. In spite of this, we find so eminent and scrupulous a scholar as the late Leon Robin saying, Dans l'Aristotelisme, tout le reel est constitue par un enchainement et une hierarchie de formes. Elles se com- mandent en quelque sorte les unes les autres, en ce sens que chacune est plus precise en ses determinations et, par consequent, plus completement intelligible que celles qui sont au-dessous d'elle. Le terme de cette hierarchie, c'est la forme pure, qui est le determine mreme, par oppo- sition a l'indetermine de la puissance. C'est a la fois l'intelligible par excellence et l'intelligence tout en acte. En elle reside donc le principe supreme de l'explication des choses; non seulement toutes les choses sont suspendues a cette chose qui seule est par elle-meme; mais, bien plus, comme aucune d'elles n'est que par sa forme et que toutes les formes sont en acte dans cet intellect essentiellement actif, il s'ensuit que tout ce qui fait la realite des choses, tout ce qui en est la raison d'etre et la cause se trouve veritablement contenue dans cette cause derniere.5 This is a beautiful example of how easy it is to turn Aristotle into a Neo-Platonist by emphasizing what one thinks he ought to have said instead of confining oneself to what he did say. It is true that the Unmoved Mover is pure actuality, but nowhere does Aristotle conclude that all forms are in actu in the Unmoved Mover. Nor does he even debate the ques- tion of whether all the forms form a hierarchy of forms. He does, as we have seen, maintain that all things are connected together in some sort of organic whole, but he does not say that this whole is a hierarchy of power, however easy it might have been for him to say so. Even in the human being where the three kingdoms are, so to speak, recapitulated, and the vegetative soul stands to the sensitive as matter to form, the former is not contained in the latter or dependent upon the latter or set into action by the latter. And the same is true, mutatis mutandis, of the relation between the sensitive and the intellective faculties. If Robin's theory were true, one might as well maintain that there was no need for programs of reform in Aristotle's ethics and politics, for all would have been taken care of by the higher forms spreading their power through the lower. Moreover, why should there be Chance in this world if toutes les choses sont suspendues d cette chose qui seule est par elle-meme? Chance, failures, mishaps are an integral part of Aristotle's philosophy and, though they may be a blemish on the rational perfection of the cosmos, nevertheless they exist. 6 Thorie Platonicienne des idees et des nombres d'apres Aristote, 206, par. 36, Paris, Alcan, 1908. 87 VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959]</page><page sequence="87">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE Had Aristotle said that his cosmos was a hierarchy of power, then the retrograde motion of the planets, though observable, might have been inexplicable. For why should any stellar body fail to copy perfectly the regular motion of the first heaven? This would be all the more curious in that Aristotle maintains firmly that the same causes always produce the same effects (De caelo, 295 a 28). If the perfection of the Unmoved Mover causes the perfection of the move- ment of the first heaven, why should not the perfect movement of the first heaven cause perfect movements in the planets? If the imperfections of things that come to be and pass away are attributable to their remoteness from the Unmoved Mover, as generation and destruction are caused by a thing's proximity and remoteness from the sun (De generatione et corruptione, 336 b 27), then the question arises and is never answered how anything can be either near or far from an immaterial being in space or from an eternal being in time. If Aristotle had read into the activity of the Unmoved Mover a force like that of propulsion, then one might think that the force grew weaker in propor- tion to the distance from him. But that is in no way his thought. There may, however, be reasonably said to be a hierarchy of degrees of perfection in the stellar uni- verse. By observation Aristotle notes the irregularity of planetary motions and by assimilating regularity to perfection, he might have argued that those planets farthest from earth were more regular and perfect than those nearer to the center, and that the simplicity and regularity increased directly with the planet's prox- imity to the sphere of the fixed stars. This, however, is not the case. The regularity of the heavenly bodies is the regularity of recurrence, which is more or less duplicated, as we have pointed out, in the generative cycles of organic life. On this grand scale there are two sorts of things: above the moon an unceasing repetition of the same motions; below the moon irregu- larity, chance, and accidents. A contrast of this sort, though not complete-since there is also enough regu- larity here below to permit the formulation of scientific laws is quite in keeping with Aristotle's logic, with his constant use of contraries and contradictories, and specially his assumption of natural oppositions. One can scarcely maintain that the intelligences which move the planets are of decreasing degrees of intelli- gence and, as for myself, I can only agree with Ross that "the intelligences must be inferior to the prime mover, but their actual relation to God is left quite obscure, as is also their mode of operation on the spheres."6 One cannot but wonder whether the notion of an Aristotelian hierarchy of power in the cosmos is not based on the Pseudo-Aristotelian De mundo, rather than on any genuine work. For in De mundo (397 b 24) we find that God has the highest place in the 6 W. D. Ross, Aristotle, 98. cosmos and that "the body closest to him most enjoys his power, and then the one after that one, and so in succession until the regions where we are. For this reason earth and the things upon the earth, being farthest away from the benefits of God, seem to be weak and confused and full of disorder." Thereupon follows the famous comparison of God with the Great King, who rules through deputies and never personally soils his hands with the details of government, surely one of the most eloquent of religious parables. But who would dare attribute it to Aristotle ? The closest approach to this in the genuine works is the description of the Unmoved Mover, but in that there is nothing said of a gradual decrease in causal power until we reach the inert realm of the substratum. 3. THE LOGICAL HIERARCHY There is a passage in the Posterior Analytics (83 b 2) which speaks of going up and down in the scale of classification, a passage which is put in to say that the scale is not indefinite but limited. Such a passage, together with the notion of a science of Being-as-being, may well have given Aristotle's readers the idea that he believed all thought to be organized into a series of classes or essences like that of the Tree of Porphyry. But Aristotle makes nothing of this. In fact, in the Metaphysics (998 b 22) he flatly declares that neither being nor unity is a genus and they would have to be general if the logical hierarchy were to be taken seri- ously. His point obviously is that everything is both one and existent in some way and that universal predi- cates cannot be kinds of things. He gives no indica- tion of what the genus of all genera would be if there were one and, as far as one can tell, he did not even consider such a possibility. This interpretation of his attitude is supported by the fact that he believed the ten categories to be cut off from one another; they could not be obtained by dichotomizing the summum genus. For it is possible, indeed usual, for a given thing to fit into several categories: for instance, if an instance is needed, Aristotle himself had positions in space, moved about in time, acted and was acted upon, was a substance, sustained various relations to other people and things, weighed a certain amount, and had various qualities. No category can be derived from any other according to the Aristotelian logic. Plotinus who is the extant source of the notion of a logical hierarchy, distinguishes between genera and cate- gories (Ennead, VI, i. 1) and concludes that categories cannot constitute genera. What then would be left in the Organon to indicate various levels of abstrac- tion? All this is commonplace and my only reason for introducing it here is to show the obvious obstacles to turning Aristotle into a Neo-Platonist. Yet however obvious the obstacles may seem to us, they were evidently fairly well concealed to others. We find, for instance, Barthelemy Saint-Hilaire a 88 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="88">HIERARCHIES hundred years ago saying in the preface to his trans- lation of the Metaphysics, Selon les genres, selon les especes, selon les individus, ou on les contemple, elles [things] forment une continuite et une chaine, qui s'etend, du monde obscur ou nous sommes, jusqu'au sommet de l'Etre, et au supreme ordon- nateur, qui est Dieu (p. xl). More recently the German philosopher F-J. von Rintelen in his Der Wertgedanke in der Europdischen Geistesentwicklung (Halle, 1; 98, 1932) asserts that there is in Aristotle a cosmic hierarchy, a hierarchy of value, and a striving (streben) on the part of all things for higher levels. He even goes so far as to say (p. 108), Je mehr aber von dem M6glichen zur Aktualitat fiber- gegangen ist, eine desto hohere Stufe des Seienden haben wir erreicht, welche dann dem Wertgrad entspricht. Die ihm zukommende Seinsform setzt zugleich fur sich eine jeweils niedere Form als ihre (relative) Materie voraus. Der Aufstieg ist der zu einer h6heren Realitdt, Seinskraft, Aktualitdt und Vollkommenheit des Guten in Richtung auf die oberste Seinsform des tatigen Geistes (italics in text). The Aufstieg in question begins with a Sehnsucht on the part of matter for Form.7 But where in Aristotle could one find evidence for the idea that forms them- selves are integrated into "higher" forms? Or for an even stranger notion which another German writer advances that God is die Idee der Ideen?8 A scholar whose opinions on this question must be taken more seriously is Leon Robin, whom we have already quoted on the cosmic hierarchy. In his Aristote (Paris, 1944) he admits (p. 37) that one cannot pass from one science to another, from arithmetic to geometry.9 But he also insists that du point de vue . . . de l'analogie reduction is a necessity, since the termination of reduction is the basis of analogy. It is indubitable that an analogy can be sound only if there is a similarity between two things and the analogy between two sciences might well lie in their logical structures. In the Posterior Analytics, Book I, chapter 27, to which Robin refers in this connection, we learn that the more accurate and prior a science is one which is of the that and the wherefore, but not of the that separate from the wherefore, and one which is not related to a sub- stratum is [more accurate than and prior to] one which is related to a substratum; for instance, arithmetic is more accurate than and prior to harmonics; also a science built upon few additional elements is [more accurate than and prior to] one which is built upon more, for instance, arith- metic is [more accurate than and prior to] geometry. By "additional elements" I suggest as an example a unit 7 Cf. also pp. 103, 105, 114. But the whole section on Aristotle should be read as an example of how preconceived ideas may carry a historian away. 8 Erich Neubauer, Der Aristotelische Formbegriff, 32, Heidel- berg, Geier, 1909. 9 Robin was talking of Aristotle, not Descartes. He could back up the principle of irreducibility by Metaphysics, 1024 b 10, at least as far as some things are concerned. which is a substance without position, while a point is a substance with position. The latter contains an additional element. But this passage merely describes the relative accu- racy and priority of two sciences and does not by any means say that there is a scale of accuracy running down from the one science which is the most accurate and prior to all the others to that which is least accu- rate and posterior to all the others. Indeed it would be straining a point even to say, as is customary, that such a notion is "implied" in this passage, for it opens with a simple distinction which does not admit of degree: the distinction between treating the that (or what exists) and the that plus the why. Of the sciences which treat of the that, one cannot treat of it more or less and, with appropriate changes in phrase- ology, the same is true of the second group of sciences. As for the "additional elements," a translation which I lift from Mure, there is no indication on Aristotle's part that one science is built on one additional element, another on two, and so on until one reaches the maxi- mum number. If there were two sciences which were built on the same number of additional elements, there would indeed be a likeness between them and therefore the basis for an analogy, but that would no more reduce one to the other than one could reduce psy- chology to dietetics because they both deal with human beings Nor does harmonics reduce to arith- metic just because it utilizes arithmetic in selecting the proportions on the basis of which tonal relations will be determined. If the relation of a note to another an octave above is as two to one, the quantity being determined by the length of the string which is plucked or struck to produce the notes, the ratio is of course part of the subject-matter of arithmetic. But arithmetic says nothing whatsoever about music and the musical details are the additional element involved. Arithmetic is more accurate than har- monics because there is less chance for error when it is pure and not applied; it is prior to harmonics because one cannot determine ratios of the strings of a lyre- or of anything else for that matter-without it. There is, it goes without saying, a classification of the sciences in Aristotle which is known to everyone: their division into speculative, practical, and produc- tive (Topics, 145 a 15).10 But this, though it may be called a hierarchy of value, does not imply that the worse develop into the better or are a degeneration of the better. Each science pursues its special end. It therefore seems unjustified to conclude with Robin (p. 39) that la hierarchie des sciences correspond A cette hierarchie des realit6s qui met tout en haut la "forme" pure, laquelle est 10 See also Topics, 157 a 10; Nichomachean ethics, 1139 a 27; Metaphysics, 981 b 25, 993 b 20. Cf. also Posterior analytics, 78 b 35, on the relations between certain problems and the various sciences. But, as I suggest, the division of the sciences is a commonplace.

En resume la science . . . est la connaissance de l'essence intelligible, et le degre hierarchique d'une science se mesure A la formalite de son objet. There can be no doubt that in Aristotle science deals with intelligible, not sensible, essences, but no one essence is in itself any more or less formal than any other. In so far as it is an essence, it is a form. In Metaphysics, Epsilon, Chapter 1, Aristotle does say that some sciences treat of essences which are sepa- rable from matter, and some deal with essences incor- porated; some with immovable things and some with movable. But he does not set up a scale of materiality here any more than he does elsewhere, but is faithful to his general conception of essences cut off from one another. It is here also that he speaks of a science of being-as-being, but he does not say that being is the final cause of all individual beings towards which all things move or to which they approximate more or less. Hence I fail to see why Robin was able to infer that the "Supreme Individual," presumably God, pure actuality, is le principe par rapport auquel se hierarchisent toutes les autres "formes," selon qu'elles sont plus ou moins empe- trees dans les conditions materielles de leur existence; en d'autres terms, il est le fondement et la source de cette immense analogie que constituent toutes les substances d6pendantes" (p. 92) [italics in text]. For, as we have seen, even the movers of the planets, which are in closest analogy to the Unmoved Mover, stand in an obscure relation to him and, though the motions which they produce are irregular whereas his are regular, there is no graded series of more or less regularity indicated. The analogy which holds among the various dependent substances, of which Robin speaks, is in their nature as substances and whether something is or is not a substance is not a matter of degree. They may individually be more or less perfect, their forms being more or less realized. Thus a man may die as a baby, as a child, as a youth, or as a mature or senile adult. But in each case he is a substance. The passage from the end of the Posterior Analytics on the development moving from perception to mem- ory to experience to art and science and the unanaly- zables is of course a genetic series in that there is a passage from one to the next above it. And so is the development in the individual human soul from sensa- tion to ideas. The recapitulation of the three organic kingdoms in the human soul with the lower orders serving as matter to those next higher is again a genetic series, and, if Aristotle had said that on the cosmic scale minerals turned into plants, plants into animals, animals into human beings, individual human reasons turning into the cosmic reason (the Unmoved Mover), it might be reasonable to maintain that the Plotinian cosmic anabasis was anticipated by Aristotle. But Aristotle leaves no doubt in a reader's mind that the Unmoved Mover is a separate being; in fact, he is unique in being an unincorporated form. If the series from Plotinus's One down to undifferentiated Matter is a hierarchy, then the series from the Unmoved Mover down to the substratum must be given a dif- ferent name. Moreover, in Plotinus there are no gaps in the series of beings and also the connection between the levels of existence is clear and definite, as far as a metaphor such as that of emanation can be clear and definite. 4. THE HIERARCHY OF REALITY In Neo-Platonism, where abstractness or generality was equated with reality and with goodness, it made sense to say that some things were more real than others. In a philosophy which permits existential gaps, it is less likely that degrees of reality will be implied, for everything will be real in its own way and after its own kind. But whatever adjective corres- ponds to the word "real" will be used in a non- comparable manner. A thing will be real or unreal. As we have said above, the general trend in Greek philosophy as it survives was to seek the immutable as something more valuable than the mutable. But that did not involve one in asserting that slow changes were metaphysically on a higher plane than rapid ones. Aristotle too preferred the eternal to the tem- poral, but some changes to his way of thinking were instantaneous and all natural changes exemplified universal laws. If he preferred human life to vege- table life, it was hardly because it took a longer time for men to grow up to maturity. The order of nature was an order and it was precisely that order which interested him as the proper study of philosophers. But that order also was contrasted with disorder and, as far as I have been able to discover, he laid out no inventory of disorderliness to show how some forms of it were less disorderly than others and therefore more real. Both the Unmoved Mover and the sub- stratum were immutable, but Aristotle does not be- lieve them to be equally good. The substratum could not do anything, though it became everything; the Unmoved Mover, though himself eternal, was the source and goal of temporal changes. What happens to the substratum is the reception and loss of forms. When the cycle of elemental changes takes place, and it is always taking place, the pairs of primary qualities pass from here to there, but no primary quality itself ever changes. When Fire loses its dryness and be- comes Air, the dryness does not turn into something else but moves off into some other region of space; that is, it becomes embedded in some other part of the substratum. The Unmoved Mover, when he is thinking about thinking, does not change since he is pure actuality, nor do his thoughts change as if he 90 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL. SOC.</page><page sequence="90">HIERARCHIES were day-dreaming (Metaphysics, Lambda, Chapter 9). In between the two cosmic termini there is mutability and the rates of change obviously differ (De generatione et corruptione, 336 b 10). But, as I say, there is no indication in Aristotle that he thought the slow rates more real then the fast ones. The pattern of change was universal in so far as it was the passage from potentiality to actuality. That pattern at least was invariable, though accidents might happen to prevent the actualization of some potentialities. One might call the pattern real, if one wished to, but by the very nature of the basic idea, there could be no pattern which was more real than another. For they were all alike. Since the cyclical character of actual- ization reproduces the immutability of the Unmoved Mover as far as anything beneath him can do so, for that reason alone one would be prevented from reading into the total system any hierarchy of reality. When it is a question of growth, as in the biography of living organisms, then one could say reasonably enough that a man is more real than a child. But "real" in that case would be equated with "actual" or "complete." Similarly one could say that a fin- ished work of art was more real than an unfinished one. The child is not yet a man and a man is what nature intends him to be, if all goes well. Such use of the adjective is properly confined to individual his- tories which, according to Aristotle, have termini. But where accidents do not happen, it makes no sense to say that a man is more real then a tree or a planet more real than a man. In fact, the genius of Aristotle was to imagine a single general design for all change, a design which could be found even in the simple motions of the elements. He may not have suc- ceeded in showing that it was everywhere identical, for the instantaneous shifts in qualitative appear- ances are difficult to assimilate to the slower proc- esses of growth. But that is beside the point. The point is that when a form is realized, there is reality; when it is not, there is imperfection or un- reality. If certain types of event were less capable of realizing their potentialities than other types, one might call them less real than the others on the ground of their incapacity. But that is not the case. Inca- pacity occurs here below the moon, but it does not occur more among minerals than among vegetables, more among vegetables than among animals, more among animals than among men. All sublunary events are subject to accidents and that is a cardinal factor in the Aristotelian philosophy. He gives us one world in which there is always the likelihood of imperfection and another in which there is no imper- fection but completeness. One does not merge into the other. 5. THE HIERARCHY OF VALUE As for a hierarchy of value, it goes without saying that Aristotle like everyone else who ever thought about the matter thought some things were better than others and that there was something best and something worst. The natural is the best and the contrary to nature the worst. And in so far as the three kinds of soul in a human being develop upwards towards the active reason, I suppose that one could say that animality was better than vegetality and humanity better than animality. But this is con- fined to human life and Aristotle makes no assump- tions about cosmic process in which the greatest good is achieved in various degrees on the different levels. The very fact that nature can be defeated or obstruc- ted in her aims and sometimes requires the aid of art should be enough to make one reject such an inter- pretation. His basic assumption that the universe must always be conceived in terms of contraries, op- posites, and similar dualities, could not be accom- modated to a hierarchical universe in which a scale of values was identified with a scale of reality. Some things may be better than other things, but in general, that is, when Aristotle is not expressing his admiration for the Unmoved Mover, they are things like knowl- edge or friendship or other human goods. Even in the Metaphysics (Lambda, Chapter 10) where he identifies the life of the Unmoved Mover with the highest good and points out that all things are interconnected "somehow," he does not establish a hierarchy of value. Though he concludes with the necessity for cosmic good government, the rule of one, he again does not say that such unity is more fully achieved on the higher level than on the lower, that the purely ma- terial world of the elements is less unified than that of the vegetables. Nor could he, for it is too clearly described as subject to very few laws and those very simple. On the contrary, the unity which is goodness is something which human beings have to achieve; it is not inherent in them "by nature." It might be maintained that Aristotle's assumption of a natural order in which some things are prior to others and in which the prior are better than the posterior (Topics, 116 b 17) is evidence of a value- hierarchy integrated into a natural hierarchy. But some things, forms and essences, are prior to others, matter and accidents, without there being any steps between them in the process of realization. The mo- tions of the spheres are completely actual and perfect; there is a distinction to be made in them between their movers and what they move, between their form and their matter, and both the rriovers and the forms are prior to the moved and the matter. But since the motions are everlasting and have no temporal begin- ning or end, there is no moment at which the form is incomplete or the mover capable of being frustrated. Qualitative change again, as we have said, may take place instantaneously, and usually has to, and here too a distinction may be made between the prior and the posterior, but there is no measurable series of stages during which one can say that perfection is VOL. 49, PT. 6, 1959] 91</page><page sequence="91">BOAS: SOME ASSUMPTIONS OF ARISTOTLE being approached as a limit and that something is becoming better and better. In growth and in artistic production, as we have also pointed out, one ap- proaches the form in time, but even when the form has been achieved, the matter is still present. Hence temporal priority and posteriority can in no sense be identified with natural priority and posteriority and, as Aristotle says himself, the genetically posterior is the naturally prior. Thus the body is prior to the soul in the order of generation and the irrational to the rational. But they are both posterior in nature. Our conclusion then is that, though there are in both the ethical and the political realms scales of values, these scales are not reproduced in the cosmic order. The development of logical, ontological, and axio- logical hierarchies and their fusion into one would seem to be a contribution, such as it is, of Neo- Platonism, of which the first clear and unmistakable presentation is in the Enneads of Plotinus. We do not deny that much of the material out of which this curious idea was developed could have been found in Aristotle, but we see no evidence in what is left of him that he either assumed it or inferred it. Though we can only speculate upon the reasons for this, it should be noticed that the idea of a hierarchy is essentially one that arises out of the exercise of power. Either power is directly wielded by a ruler upon the ruled or through a series of intermediaries. It is unlikely, though not impossible, that a man educated in the Athenian tradition of government should have con- ceived of the second of these alternatives as a model for his universe. Aristotle's universe does have a ruler, but he rules through the attractive force of love. Anything whatsoever can love him and some imitate his perfection more successfully than others. But, as all commentators are agreed, the power which he exerts upon the spheres immediately below him is left unclarified and he nowhere speaks of it, as Plotinus does, as a kind of force emanating from him down through levels of reality, goodness, and generality to the least real, worst, and most concrete, and then re- turning upwards.11 If there was ever what William James called a block-universe, it is Aristotle's. To those who would attribute to Aristotle a belief in a natural hierarchy, our reply would be "Not Proven." n For a typical example of emanationism which is not in Plotinus, see the selection attributed to Linus in Stobaeus, Book I, Chapter 10, 5 (ed. Meineke) 76, Leipzig, 1860. I cite this because it seems to me to show how current the idea was in post-classical times. 92 [TRANS. AMER. PHIL.
