Siegler Carnegie-Mellon University RICHARDS, D. DEAN, and SIEGLER, ROBERT S. The Effects of Task Requirements on Children's Life Judgments. CHILD DEVELOPMENT, 1984, 55, 1687-1696. Although children's understanding of the concept of life has been studied extensively in the past 50 years, findings have been contradictory. Some results have supported Piaget's contention that children identify life with function, motion, or autonomous motion; other results have not. The 4 experiments of our study were designed to establish the conditions under which children exhibit different understandings of life by varying task requirements within a common procedural framework. When children were asked either to name living things or to judge the life status of particular entities, they almost never indicated that inani- mate objects were alive. When asked to justify their judgments, however, young children frequently cited the object's capacity for movement. In addition, emphasizing the motion states of objects caused 4- and 5-year-olds, but not older children, to judge whether objects were alive on the basis of whether the objects were moving. Overall, the results suggested that even 4- and 5-year-olds know that people and other animals are alive and that almost all inanimate objects are not. However, they also indicated that young children relate motion to life in a greater number of contexts than do older children. Variations in the type of data emphasized, the choice of stimuli, and the stage classification criteria appear to account for the diversity of previous conclusions. The distinction between living and non- living things is of fundamental importance in biology, in several branches of philosophy, and in people's understanding of their envi- ronment. Empirical reports of how under- standing of the life concept develops have been remarkably inconsistent, however. Vari- ations in the methods used to assess concep- tual understanding may account for the differ- ing findings. The purpose of our study, therefore, was to establish the conditions under which children manifest alternative understandings of the life concept. Piaget (1973) provided the earliest exten- sive account of children's knowledge about the concept of life. He suggested that children progress through four stages of understanding. Children in Stage I (up to age 6) attribute life to things that perform a function or are active. This includes people and animals, and also bicycles and ovens. In Stage II (age 6-8), chil- dren narrow their definition, regarding as alive only things that move. Thus, people, other animals, vehicles, and the sun are con- sidered alive, but trees and other plants are not. Children in Stage III (age 8-12) regard as alive only things that move autonomously, in- cluding people, other animals, and the sun. Stage IV children attribute life to either ani- mals or to animals and plants. Replications of Piaget's work have cre- ated more conflict than confluence.1 First con- sider data on the fit of Piaget's stage model to children's performance. Although Russell (1940) disagreed with Piaget's age norms, he reported that more than 98% of children could be classified into one of Piaget's four stages. Other investigators have reported difficulties in classifying children's performance into Piagetian stages, but have differed as to the source of the discrepancies. Laurendeau and Pinard (1962) reported that children of all ages equated life with many different properties rather than defining it in terms of a single 1 We limited consideration of existing studies to experiments in which children were asked "Is an X alive?" Studies that focused on whether children interacted differently with animate and inanimate objects (e.g., Golinkoff &amp; Harding, Note 1) were excluded.

Berzonsky (1973, 1974) concluded that different children of a single age used different criteria for attribut- ing life, with reflective children engaging in less animistic thinking than impulsive chil- dren. Carey (Note 2) found that fairly substan- tial percentages of preschoolers met Piaget's Stage IV criteria, though the majority did not. Huang and Lee (1945), Klingensmith (1953), and Klingberg (1957) found no evidence that children ever consistently judged nonliving objects as living, although they reported that some children occasionally did so (see Looft &amp; Bartz [1969] for a more extensive review). Piaget's explanation for why children re- ported nonliving things to be alive-because they identified life with motion or function-- also has been disputed. Huang and Lee (1945) and Klingberg (1957) suggested that young children do not identify life with movement but rather occasionally are misled in their life attributions by salient characteristics of some objects. Klingensmith (1953) suggested that children sometimes report that nonliving things are alive because they interpret the word "alive" metaphorically rather than liter- ally. Laurendeau and Pinard (1962) suggested that children identify the presence of life with a large number of anthropomorphic traits, of which movement is merely one example. Carey (Note 2) argued that, whatever children intended by reporting that inanimate objects were alive, they were not implying that they in general were like animals. Much of the disagreement over how the concept of life develops may result from three types of methodological variation: type of data emphasized, scoring criteria, and choice of stimuli. The procedures of the investigators who found the least evidence that children consistently judged nonliving things to be alive-Huang and Lee, Klingberg, and Kling- ensmith-differed from those of other inves- tigators on each of these dimensions. With re- gard to the type of data emphasized, Huang and Lee, Klingberg, and Klingensmith appear to have based their conclusions entirely on children's judgments of life status. Piaget, Russell, Berzonsky, Dennis (1953), Lauren- deau and Pinard, and Carey relied on chil- dren's explanations as well. Huang and Lee, Klingensmith, and Klingberg were also far less stringent in their criteria, concluding that children understood the concept of life if most of their answers were correct. Laurendeau and Pinard, Dennis, and Carey classified chil- dren as not identifying life with living things if they judged even one inanimate object to be alive. (Piaget's and Russell's classification cri- teria are not clear from their reports.) The in- vestigators also differed in the number of ex- traterrestrial bodies and natural forces that they included as stimuli. Huang and Lee, Klingensmith, and Klingberg asked about only one or no such objects. The other inves- tigators presented between two and six. In this paper, we attempt to establish which conditions, if any, lead young children to identify life with movement. The purpose of Experiment 1 is to identify rules children use to judge whether objects are alive. The purpose of Experiment 2 is to provide con- verging evidence for the Experiment 1 results by asking children to name objects that they think are alive. Experiment 3 has two pur- poses: to determine the relation between chil- dren's judgments and their explanations, and to determine the effects of including extrater- restrial objects in the stimulus set. The pur- pose of Experiment 4 is to determine whether emphases in the particular questions children are asked influence their performance. The overall goal is to indicate how particular pro- cedural variations lead children to display par- ticular conceptual understandings. Experiment 1 The first experiment was designed to de- termine the rules that 4-7-year-olds use to judge whether objects are alive.2 Claims that young children confuse life with motion (e.g., Piaget, 1929/1973) suggested four rules for ex- plicit test: rule 1-things that have an inher- ent capacity for motion are alive; rule 2- things that are moving are alive; rule 3- people and other animals are alive; and rule 4-people, other animals, trees, and other plants are alive. Next, problems were designed by which adherence to these rules could be tested. Six categories of objects were included: people, other animals, trees, other plants, vehicles, and other objects.3 Examples of these catego- 2 In the studies reported in this paper we utilized children ranging from 4 to 11 years. Piaget's research indicated that this subsumes the age range where an identification between life and motion is most likely. Although we initially planned to include older children in Experiment 1, pilot results suggested no tendency by younger children to identify life with motion, making it unlikely that older children would do so. 3 The six categories were generated as follows. First, objects were divided into animate and inanimate. Next, the animate category was divided into animals and plants. Then, the animal cate-</page><page sequence="3">Richards and Siegler 1689 ries were presented in three different states of motion: moving by themselves, being moved by an outside agent, or staying stationary. Of the 18 logically possible combinations, three were physically implausible (trees, other plants, and stationary objects moving them- selves) and thus were not presented. As shown in Table 1, the four rules yielded dis- tinctive answer patterns for each of the 15 re- maining types of problems. The pattern of re- sponse on these problems was used to assess children's rules as in Siegler's (1976) rule as- sessment approach. Method Participants and problems.-The chil- dren in the experiment were 16 4- and 5-year- olds (M = 55 months, SD = 4.2) and 16 6- and 7-year-olds (M = 80 months, SD = 3.8). In this as well as subsequent experiments, equal numbers of males and females were included in each age group. On each of the 15 types of problems shown in Table 1, four examples were created. Each example consisted of a picture and a one-sentence story. Illustratively, chil- dren were shown a picture of a tree in a wagon and told, "The cherry tree was moved to its new home. Was the cherry tree alive?" The 60 pictures and stories were presented in stratified random order. Procedure.--Children were brought indi- vidually to a vacant classroom and told to look at each picture, listen to each story, and judge whether the object was alive. To be classified as using a rule, a child needed to answer at least 51 of the 60 questions as predicted by that rule and not fit any other rule as well.4 Results and Discussion Although all 32 children met the rule us- age criteria, no children used rule 1 (things that can move are alive), and only one child (a 5-year-old) used rule 2 (things that are moving are alive). Twelve of the 4- and 5-year-olds judged only people and other animals to be alive (rule 3), and three judged both animals and plants to be alive (rule 4). Among the 6- and 7-year-olds, eight used rule 3 and eight used rule 4. A 2 (age) x 15 (type of problem) ANOVA of the number of correct answers revealed significant effects for age, F(1,30) = 5.88, p &lt; .05, and problem type, F(14,420) = 51.95, p &lt; .01, and no significant interaction, F(14,420) = 1.64, p &gt; .05. (As no significant sex differ- ences were found in this or the following ex- periments, the ANOVAs were collapsed across sex.) Older children answered correctly more often than younger children (86% vs. 69% of trials), and all children produced more correct answers on problems involving peo- ple, animals, vehicles, and objects (93%- 100% correct) than on those involving plants and trees (31%-39% correct) (Newman-Keuls analysis, df = 420, p &lt; .05). Only 10 of the 32 children ever attributed life to a nonliving object. With one exception, these children did so only rarely. Life was at- tributed to vehicles on only 6% of trials and to stationary objects on only 1%. In sum, most 4- 7-year-olds judged people and other animals as being alive, and a sizable minority judged people, other animals, trees, and other plants as being so. All but one child would be classified at Piaget's Stage IV. Experiment 2 The results of Experiment 1 revealed lit- tle tendency for children to judge inanimate moving things to be alive. It was possible, however, that children do believe some ob- jects besides animals and plants are alive (e.g., the sun), but that we simply did not ask about those exceptions. It also was possible that children can perform the recognition task of Experiment 1 more accurately than a task in- volving production of living things. The second experiment was designed to investigate these possibilities. The experi- menter asked children to list as many living things as they could. This method has been utilized by Nelson (1974) and Rosner and Hayes (1977), among others, to determine de- gory was divided into people and other animals and the plant category into trees and other plants. Finally, the inanimate category was divided into vehicles (inanimate objects strongly associated with motion) and other inanimate objects. This procedure yielded the six types of problems that we presented: people, other animals, trees, other plants, vehicles, and other nonliving objects. 4 Rule use criteria in this and subsequent experiments were chosen so that the probability of a random responder being classified as using one of the rules was less than .05. This probability was determined by dividing the number of response patterns that met rule use criteria by the total number of response patterns. In Experiments 1 and 4, there were 2'6, or slightly less than 1.153 x 1018 different answer patterns (60 problems, each of which could be answered one of two ways), of which less than 2.6 x 1016 would be classified as evidence of use of one of the four rules. Thus the probability of classifying a random responder as a rule user was less than .03. In the case of Experi- ment 3, 2,047,252 of the 268,435,456 possible answer patterns (less that 1%) met rule usage criteria.</page><page sequence="4">1690 Child Development TABLE 1 PREDICTED ANSWERS FOR EACH PROBLEM TYPE FOR CHILDREN USING EACH RULE: EXPERIMENTS 1 AND 4 RULES 1 2 3 4 PROBLEM TYPES: (Capacity (People OBJECT AND for (In and Other (All Animals MOTION STATE Motion) Motion) Animals) and Plants) Person: Was still .........

Method Participants and procedure.-Sixteen people of each of five ages participated: 4- and 5-year-olds (M = 56 months, SD = 4.3), 6- and 7-year-olds (M = 78 months, SD = 3.6), 8- and 9-year-olds (M = 102 months, SD = 4.2), 10- and 11-year-olds (M = 129 months, SD = 3.8), and college undergraduates. All subjects were new to experiments on the life concept. Children aged 7 or less were brought in- dividually to a vacant classroom. A tape re- corder positioned near the children was started, and they were asked, "Can you tell me some things that are alive?" If the children paused for more than 30 sec, they were en- couraged to continue. The procedure con- tinued until 5 min had passed, or until the children expressed a desire to stop, whichever came first. Children aged 8 or more were pre- sented the task in groups of 16 and were given 5 min to write their answers on a sheet of pa- per (up to a mtximum of 24). Results and Discussion Fewer than 1% of objects that children said were alive were not. One-way ANOVAs revealed increases with age in the number of animals, F(4,75) = 15.90, p &lt; .01, the number of trees, F(4,75) = 7.57, p &lt; .01, and the num- ber of other plants, F(4,75) = 7.32, p &lt; .01, cited. The three older groups cited more ani- mals than did 6- and 7-year-olds, who cited more than 4- and 5-year-olds. The three older groups also cited more plants other than trees than did the 4-7-year-olds. The adults and 8- and 9-year-olds cited more trees than did 4-7- year-olds. (All differences, df = 75, p &lt; .05, by Newman-Keuls analysis.) The number of children in each age group mentioning at least one member of each of these categories is listed in Table 2. The number mentioning at least one tree in- creased with age, F(4,75) = 10.88, p &lt; .01, as did the number mentioning at least one other plant, F(4,75) = 14.20, p &lt; .01, and the num- ber mentioning at least one part of a living thing, F(4,75) = 3.17, p &lt; .025. A greater number of adults named at least one tree than did members of any other age group, and a greater number of 10- and 11-year-olds named at least one tree than did 4- and 5-year-olds.

No significant age differences emerged in the number of children and adults naming peo- ple, other animals, and inanimate objects as alive, all F's &lt; 2.00, p &gt; .05. It could be argued that the greater num- ber of responses produced by older children was due to younger children responding orally and older children responding in writ- ing. This interpretation seems unlikely, how- ever, for at least two reasons. First, older chil- dren's more frequent citation of trees and other plants was exactly what would have been expected from the rules they used in Ex- periment 1, where the task was identical for older and younger children. Second, the less laborious nature of oral responses would, if anything, seem likely to reduce differences between the number of responses produced by younger and older children, not increase them. The results of Experiments 1 and 2 pro- vided no evidence that children pass through a developmental stage in which they identify life with motion. Instead, most 4- and 5-year- olds appeared to believe that only animals and people are alive. By age 8, children usually added plants and trees. These results sup- ported the conclusions of Huang and Lee (1945), Klingberg (1957), and Klingensmith (1953), but not those of Laurendeau and Pinard (1962), Piaget (1929/1973), Russell (1940), and Carey (Note 2). Several methodological differences dis- tinguish the two groups of studies. One was that we and the other investigators who found that young children identified life only with living things relied solely on children's judg- ments. In contrast, investigators who reached other conclusions based their conclusions in large part on children's explanations of their judgments. Second, investigators who found that children identified life with living things omitted or included only one natural force or extraterrestrial object. The other investigators presented between two and six such forces and objects. The impact of these two meth- odological differences was investigated in Ex- periment 3. Experiment 3 Consider a situation in which a child is asked if a dog is alive and responds, "Yes." The child then is asked, "Why do you think so?" He or she might interpret this question to mean "What defining feature or formal class membership makes you think that dogs are alive?" This interpretation suggests the expla- nation that a dog is alive because it is a dog or because it is an animal. Another possible in- terpretation of the question, however, would be, "What do dogs do that makes you think they are alive?" This interpretation allows ex- planations that refer either to characteristic features of dogs or to defining features of life. Keil and Batterman (Note 3) found that 4- and 5-year-olds emphasized characteristic features of objects in judging whether concepts were applicable to new situations, whereas older children relied on defining features. A paral- lel interpretation might lead 4- and 5-year- olds to frequently explain their attributions of life status in terms of characteristic features such as movement. Now consider a situation in which a child is asked whether an extraterrestrial object or natural force, such as fire, is alive. Determin-</page><page sequence="6">1692 Child Development ing whether fire possesses defining properties of living things is difficult. Does fire grow? Does it eat? Does it reproduce? These are not simple questions even for adults. The situa- tion may be further confused by the child hav- ing encountered anthropomorphic references to natural forces and extraterrestrial bodies. Even elementary school reading books often depict the sun, moon, and wind in humanlike form. As Carey (Note 2) has suggested, given such a confusing situation, children might conclude that these forces and distant bodies are at least in some sense alive. Experiment 3 was designed to examine the effects of these methodological differ- ences. To establish the relation between chil- dren's judgments and their explanations, and also to determine whether asking for explana- tions altered children's judgments, we fol- lowed the same basic procedure as in Experi- ment 1. However, after each judgment we asked children "Why?" or "Why not?" In ad- dition, to establish children's views of natural forces and extraterrestrial objects, we added four such entities to our list of stimuli. This addition also allowed us to test an additional rule, rule 2', corresponding to Piaget's Stage III. Within this rule, things that move autono- mously-animals, natural forces, and extrater- restrial objects-are alive. Method Participants and procedure.-The partic- ipants included 16 children of each of four ages. They were 4- and 5-year-olds (M = 54 months, SD = 4.8), 6- and 7-year-olds (M = 78 months, SD = 4.4), 8- and 9-year-olds (M = 101 months, SD = 4.6), and 10- and 11- year-olds (M = 124 months, SD = 4.0). The procedure was identical to that used in Experiment 1 in all but three ways. First, there were seven rather than six types of ob- jects, with the new class of objects being four autonomously moving entities: the sun, the moon, lightning, and the wind. Second, the motion states of the objects were not varied. These two changes reduced the number of items to 28, four each of seven problem types. The third change was that, after they judged an object to be or not to be alive, children were asked, "Why?" or "Why not?" In cases where children provided more than one justification for a particular problem, only the first justification was recorded (in fact, such situations were rare, occurring on less than 1% of the problems). To be classified as using a particular rule, a child was required to answer 24 of 28 prob- lems as predicted by that rule, and to fit no other rule as well or better. In the case where only one type of problem distinguished one rule from another (e.g., rules 1 and 2'), chil- dren were required to answer three of the four items as predicted by that rule. Where two types of problem distinguished one rule from another, children had to answer at least five of the eight items as predicted by that rule. Results and Discussion Judgments.-A 4 (age) x 7 (type of prob- lem) ANOVA of the number of correct an- swers made by children in Experiment 3 re- vealed significant effects for age, F(3,30) = 7.19, p &lt; .01, type of problem, F(6,360) = 17.93, p &lt; .01, and the age x type of problem interaction, F(18,360) = 2.93, p &lt; .01. The main effect of age reflected the fact that 8- and 9-year-olds and 10- and 11-year-olds answered correctly more often (90% and 95%, respec- tively) than 6- and 7-year-olds (83%), and that the latter group answered correctly more often than the 4- and 5-year-olds (76%) (Newman- Keuls analysis, df = 60, p &lt; .05). The main effect of type of problem reflected a signifi- cantly greater number of correct answers on problems involving vehicles, other inanimate objects, animals, and people (between 93% and 100% correct) than on problems involving autonomously moving objects (79% correct), and a greater number of correct answers on problems involving autonomously moving ob- jects than on problems involving plants and trees (70% and 68% correct, respectively) (Newman-Keuls analysis, df = 360, p &lt; .05). The cause of the significant interaction be- tween age and type of problem can best be understood by analyzing the rules used by the children. Forty-eight of the 64 children met the rule use criteria. Among these, only one child, an 8-year-old, used rule 1, and no children used rule 2'. Instead, eight 4- and 5-year-olds, five 6- and 7-year-olds, two 8- and 9-year-olds, and one 10- and 11-year-old reported that peo- ple and animals were alive (rule 3), and four 4- and 5-year-olds, six 6- and 7-year-olds, eight 8- and 9-year-olds, and 13 10- and 11-year-olds reported that people, animals, plants, and trees were alive (rule 4). The number of chil- dren using rule 3 decreased with age, X2(3) = 10.53, p &lt; .05, whereas the number of chil- dren using rule 4 increased with age, X2(3) = 9.34, p &lt; .05. Of the 64 children who participated in Experiment 3, four 4- and 5-year-olds, five 6- and 7-year-olds, five 8- and 9-year-olds, and two 10- and 1 1-year-olds met no rule usage criteria. Ten of these 16 children followed a similar pattern; they reported that people, ani-</page><page sequence="7">Richards and Siegler 1693 mals, plants, and trees were alive, and also that two, three, or four of the autonomously moving objects were. Such a response pattern could not be considered an identification be- tween autonomous motion and life (rule 2') since the children included six of the eight plants and trees. Instead, these children ap- peared to consider all living objects and cer- tain autonomously moving nonliving objects to be alive. Explanations.-The children's explana- tions of their answers were classified by two independent raters into the seven categories listed in Table 3. The first two categories, for- mal class membership and motion, were in- spired by Piaget's account. The third category contains the four qualities most cited by biol- ogy texts as essential to life--reproduction, growth, food consumption, and respiration. Explanations dealing with qualities of animals and plants other than these four, those dealing with traits of nonliving things, other answers, and "I don't know" answers were assigned to the remaining categories. The raters agreed initially on the categorization of 91% of the children's explanations. On the remaining 9%, they resolved their initial disagreement through discussion. Piaget reported that motion explanations indicated immature thinking, whereas expla- nations referring to formal class membership were indicative of mature thought. The results reported in Table 3 provided only weak sup- port for this assertion. Four- and 5-year-olds advanced a nonsignificantly greater number of motion explanations than older children, F(3,60) = 1.69, p &gt; .05, whereas the older children advanced a nonsignificantly greater number of class membership explanations, F(3,60) = 2.45, p &gt; .05. Contrary to expecta- tions derived from Piaget's reports, but consis- tent with the reports of Laurendeau and Pinard (1962) and Carey (Note 2), children fre- quently advanced justifications other than identity, defining characteristics, or motion. Children's judgments and their explana- tions were only loosely related. Although 24% of the explanations of 4- and 5-year-olds and 16% of those of all of the children referred to motion, only one child (2% of the sample) used a motion rule to make judgments. Ironi- cally, this child was less likely than the group as a whole to justify his answers in terms of motion. Only 11% of his explanations cited motion. Thus, children in Experiment 3 fre- quently used motion explanations to justify their answers, providing some support for the view that reliance on explanations led some investigators to suggest that young children associate life with motion. However, at no age did children produce motion explanations on more than 24% of trials, which does not seem sufficient to conclude that they identified life with motion. Moreover, requiring children to explain their answers did not increase the number of motion rule users on the judgment task. Rather, the results suggested that 4-11- year-olds sometimes interpret the request for explanations as a request to indicate a feature characteristic of living things rather than as a request for a defining feature or a class mem- bership. What other factors might account for the variability in findings concerning children's knowledge of the relation between life and motion? One possibility is that some proce- dures for assessing children's knowledge may have emphasized the motion states of objects more than others. Experiment 4 was designed to explore this possibility. Experiment 4 As noted above, being asked to judge whether objects are alive and to justify what- TABLE 3 PERCENTAGES OF EXPLANATIONS GIVEN BY EACH AGE GROUP: EXPERIMENT 3 AGE GROUP ANSWER CATEGORIES 4-5 6-7 8-9 10-11 Formal class membership ....................... 6 17 19 21 M otion .. .................................. 24 16 13 10 Essential qualities of animals and plants ...........19 20 25 38 Nonessential qualities of animals and plants ........ 27 13 16 13 Traits of nonliving things ......................14 23 23 17 Other answers .. ............................. 1 8 3 1 "Don't know" answers ......................... 9 3 1 0</page><page sequence="8">1694 Child Development ever answer they give may constitute an am- biguous situation for young children. Indeed, several of Piaget's (1929/1973) protocols illus- trate that children were not overly confident of their explanations. In such an uncertain situation, any subtle sign of the experiment- er's hopes or preferences might influence children's behavior. Experiment 4 was designed to test whether emphasizing objects' motion states could influence children's judgments of whether the objects were alive. The experi- menter presented children with the same 60 stimuli as in Experiment 1. This time, how- ever, the experimenter's questions included a tag phrase emphasizing the motion state of the object. For example, while showing a picture of a seated boy, the experimenter said, "Jimmy sat waiting his turn. Was Jimmy alive while he was sitting still?" Method Participants and procedure.-The chil- dren were 16 4- and 5-year-olds (M = 56 months, SD = 4.4), 16 6- and 7-year-olds (M = 79 months, SD = 4.0), and 16 8- and 9-year- olds (M = 104 months, SD = 3.6). The 60 items presented to children were identical to those used in Experiment 1, except that a tag phrase, emphasizing whether the object was moving, was added to the end of each item. The procedure followed with the 4-7-year- olds was identical to that used in Experiment 1. The procedure employed with the 8- and 9- year-olds was similar, but the pictures were shown to groups of 16 children by way of overhead transparencies, and the children wrote out their answers. The same rule crite- ria were used as in Experiment 1. Results and Discussion In sharp contrast to the previous findings, most 4- and 5-year-olds in Experiment 4 used the in-motion rule (rule 2). Ten of the 16 pre- schoolers used this rule, whereas 3 used rule 3, one used rule 4, and two met no rule use criterion. On the other hand, motion emphasis did not affect the judgments of the 6-9-year- olds. Nine of the 6- and 7-year-olds reported that people and animals were alive (rule 3). The remaining seven 6- and 7-year-olds and all 16 of the 8- and 9-year-olds reported that people, animals, plants, and trees were alive (rule 4). Thus, there were significantly more motion rule users among the 4- and 5-year- olds than among either of the two older age groups, in both cases ?2(1) = 11.79, p &lt; .01, and significantly more motion rule users among the 4- and 5-year-olds in this experi- ment than in Experiment 1, X2(1) = 8.86, p &lt; .01. A 3 (age) x 15 (type of problem) ANOVA of number of correct answers indicated significant effects for age, F(2,45) = 53.73, p &lt; .01, type of problem, F(14,630) = 15.73, p &lt; .01, and the age x type of problem interac- tion, F(28,630) = 6.68, p &lt; .01. The main ef- fect for age reflected an increase with age in number of correct answers, from 60% for the 4- and 5-year-olds, to 88% for the 6- and 7- year-olds, to 98% for the 8- and 9-year-olds. The causes of the main effect of type of prob- lem were more complex than in the previous experiments. Newman-Keuls tests indicated that children were significantly more accurate on problem types involving people and ani- mals moving themselves, people and animals being moved by an external force, and vehi- cles and objects staying still than on problems involving vehicles moving themselves, vehi- cles and objects being moved, and people and animals staying still. In addition, they were more accurate on the latter problems than on problems involving plants and trees being moved and were more accurate on these than on problems involving plants and trees sitting still, df = 630, p &lt; .05. In sum, accuracy was highest when both the animals rule and the in-motion rule led to the correct answer, next highest when the animals rule did, next high- est when the in-motion rule did, and lowest when neither rule did. The age x type of problem interaction can be understood by referring to Table 4. The 4- and 5-year-olds were more accurate on problems involving living things moving and nonliving things remaining stationary than on problems where living things were stationary or inanimate objects moving. The 6- and 7- year-olds were more accurate in classifying animals and objects than in classifying plants. The 8- and 9-year-olds were equally accurate on all problem types, df = 630, all p's &lt; .05. In sum, 4- and 5-year-olds were most accurate on problems where the in-motion rule led to correct answers, 6- and 7-year-olds were most accurate on problems where the animals rules led to correct answers, and the 8- and 9-year- olds were consistently correct on all types of problems, as implied by the animals-plus- plants rule. The results of Experiment 4 demon- strated that question wordings that emphasize the motion state of each object can have large effects of young children's performance. Such wordings led the majority of4- and 5-year-olds to use motion rules to determine what things were alive. The judgments of older children were unaffected by the same phrasings.</page><page sequence="9">Richards and Siegler 1695 TABLE 4 PERCENTAGES CORRECT BY EACH AGE GROUP FOR EACH PROBLEM TYPE: EXPERIMENT 4 PROBLEM TYPES: AGE GROUP OBJECT AND MOTION STATE 4-5 6-7 8-9 Person: Moved self ....... 94 100 98 Was moved ...... 86 97 100 Was still ......... 44 100 100 Animal: Moved self ....... 89 100 98 Was moved ...... 84 98 97 Was still ......... 48 100 98 Tree: Was moved ...... 48 56 98 Was still ........ 17 56 98 Plant: Was moved ...... 53 59 97 Was still ......... 13 61 97 Vehicle: Moved self ....... 36 100 98 Was moved ...... 53 97 100 Was still ......... 84 100 100 Object: Was moved ...... 58 100 100 Was still ......... 89 100 98 General Discussion The results of the four experiments dem- onstrated both the existence of conditions under which children identify life with living things and the existence of conditions under which they do not. By varying task conditions within a common procedural framework, it was possible to gain a perspective on when children manifest particular understandings of the life concept. Under most conditions, preschoolers and older children did not identify life with mo- tion. In Experiments 1 and 3, most 4- and 5- year-olds judged only people and other ani- mals to be alive. The remaining preschoolers judged as alive people, other animals, trees, and other plants. By the age of 8, the majority of children judged people, other animals, trees, and other plants to be alive. A similar result was obtained in the production task of Experiment 2. Neither preschoolers nor elementary school children cited nonliving, moving objects such as the sun and moon as examples of living things. Nor, as suggested by Klingensmith (1953), did children invoke metaphoric uses of the concept. Only when motion was emphasized in the question did many young children rely on it in judging life status. These experiments suggested that the ex- tension of life status to plants and trees, rather than its removal from inanimate moving ob- jects, was the dominant developmental trend. All four experiments provided compelling evidence that the number of children who be- lieve that plants and trees are alive increased substantially between the ages of 4 and 8. There were indications that the change fol- lows a none-to-all pattern (although the lack of longitudinal data makes caution necessary in such conclusions). No children in Experi- ments 1 and 3 classified more than 25% but less than 62% of trees and other plants as be- ing alive. The pattern suggested that children either learn that plants as a class are alive or that they generalize to the class after learning that a very small number of particular plants are alive. Since animals and plants differ radically on just about every dimension of morphology and behavior except those relating to life pro- cesses, it is not surprising that young children do not immediately group them in a single category of living things. It is interesting to note here that Laurendeau and Pinard (1962), Piaget (1929/1973), Russell (1940), and Carey (Note 2) placed children reporting that ani- mals were alive in the same stage as children reporting that animals and plants were alive. Yet children who believe that only animals are alive have a different understanding of the concept of life than children who believe both animals and plants are alive. Besides the obvi- ous fact that the former group underextends the concept, these children would also be ex- pected to have different views concerning the important attributes of living things. The results also render comprehensible the discrepant findings of previous inves- tigators. Each of the three methodological variations identified above seems to have in- fluenced the results obtained. The inves- tigators who reported the closest identification between life and motion relied heavily on children's explanations. Those who reported the least identification relied totally on judg- ments. In the results of Experiment 3 of our study, reliance on explanations suggested a closer identification between motion and life than did sole reliance on judgments. The particular objects included as stimuli also seem to have played a role. The inves- tigators who claimed that children identify life with motion presented a number of extrater- restrial objects or natural forces to children. The investigators who found the least identification presented few if any such ob- jects. In Experiment 1 of our study, children</page><page sequence="10">1696 Child Development were presented no extraterrestrial objects and almost never judged the inanimate objects that were presented to be alive. In Experi- ment 3, they were presented extraterrestrial objects and frequently judged these, though not other inanimate objects, to be alive. The judgments did not reflect a general autono- mous motion criterion for attributing life, since most children who judged two or more such objects to be alive also judged plants and trees to be alive. The choice of objects to ask children about may have interacted with the scoring system used. The investigators who con- cluded that children closely link life and mo- tion used scoring systems in which even one attribution of life to an inanimate object was sufficient to conclude that the child did not understand life. For the investigators who concluded that even younger children under- stand the life concept, the criterion of under- standing was usually judging correctly. The interaction of these two methodological deci- sions is illustrated by the results of Experi- ment 3 of our study. In this study, if we in- clude responses to the distant objects and natural forces, and if we adopt a criterion in which only children who never attribute life to inanimate objects understand the concept, even 8- and 9-year-olds would be said not to understand. However, if we either exclude the data on the distant objects and natural forces or adopt a more lenient criterion of understanding, we would conclude that chil- dren as young as 4 years do understand.
