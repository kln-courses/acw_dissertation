<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> TANIA MUNZ* “My Goose Child Martina”: The Multiple Uses of Geese in the Writings of Konrad Lorenz ABSTRACT In 1935, the graylag goose Martina (1935–?) hatched from an egg in the home of the zoologist Konrad Lorenz (1903–1989). Martina imprinted on Lorenz, slept in his bedroom, mated with the gander Martin, and flew off in 1937. Over the following decades, Konrad Lorenz helped to establish the discipline of ethology, received a share of the 1973 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, and continued to write about his famous goose Martina. This essay examines the different instantiations of the geese in general, and Martina in particular, in Lorenz’s writings aimed at read- erships that included prewar zoologists, National Socialist psychologists, and popular audiences from the 1930s to 1980s. By developing an animal with her own biogra- phy, Lorenz created an individual whose lived and rhetorical agency made her espe- cially well suited to perform widely divergent aspects of his evolving science. While a significant literature in the history of science has explored the standardization and stabilization of animals in science, I show how Lorenz’s creation of a highly protean and increasingly public Martina was co-constitutive of the establishment of his science and public persona.

This image of the world-famous ethologist will be remembered above all after his death.1 In a  letter, Konrad Lorenz (–) reported enthusiastically to his mentor, the ornithologist Oskar Heinroth, “the geese are truly delightful. Martina still goes up the stairs each night to my bedroom and flies out the window in the morning.”2 Lorenz was one of the key founders of the disci- pline of ethology—the approach to animal behavior that sought evolutionary explanations of complex instincts and informed European studies of behavior for much of the twentieth century. He was also one of three winners of the  Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine and became most famous for his work on graylag geese.3 Much of his writing centered on the animals’ complex instincts and social interactions. The Martina mentioned in the letter referred to one of the first graylag geese that Lorenz reared from egg to adulthood. The animal hatched in  and over the course of the next couple of years shared the Lorenzes’ bed- room—each night she slept next to their bed and flew through the window in the morning. In  she mated with a gander, whom Lorenz named Martin. Then, around , the pair flew off never to be seen again. The same year the geese took flight, Martina appeared for the first time in a publication aimed at scientific audiences under the designator “Ma.”4 Lorenz would continue to write about Martina in the decades to come, despite the hundreds of other graylag geese he would keep in his various research locations. In , she made her final appearance in Lorenz’s Here I Am—Where Are You?

The author explained, “the species Anser anser [graylag goose] owes its path to fame and significance to the graylag gosling Martina. She was the first of her kind to adopt the twenty-nine-year-old Konrad Lorenz in her mother’s place and thereby drew his attention to the inborn behavioral program of imprinting —mockers maintain that Lorenz, in turn, imprinted on the devoted gosling with its fluffy down coat.”5 Media outlets throughout the world carried the news of Lorenz’s death; by the late s the ethologist had become a scien- tific celebrity whose reputation extended well beyond German-speaking Eur- ope. But Lorenz’s fame was not a solitary achievement. Indeed, the geese and especially Martina had become intimately associated with his public persona and found their way into the living rooms of thousands of readers through popular books, educational and popular films, and journalistic coverage.6 While considerable scholarship has documented the life and work of Konrad Lorenz and the development of the discipline of ethology, none has offered a detailed analysis of how, over the course of his career, Lorenz developed the geese in his writings—and how this development can be read as constitutive of his own evolving scientific persona. This is surprising, in that Lorenz emerged as one of the most important voices on animals in postwar Europe, and the popular press, historians, and Lorenz himself have acknowledged (if not fully explored) the cen- trality of these animals to Lorenz’s scientific and public life.7 In this paper, I offer a close examination of Martina. Rather than follow her path from egg to her departing flight from the Lorenzes’ home, this article .

In his various writings, Lorenz mobilized his first gosling to perform widely differing—and at times, contradictory—aspects of his evolving scientific agenda. In this multi- decade process that continued long after the bird herself had flown away, Martina distinguished herself from the generic flock of her species to become an individual and eventually a figurehead. Thus, in addition to developing the goose as a typological animal for which Lorenz’s science would come to be known, he also developed a parallel biographical and individualized animal. But rather than offering a repudiation or alternative to the idea of the animal type, Martina, in Lorenz’s hands, proved a remarkably flexible and effective instantiation of it. This paper is divided into four parts, each of which focuses on a particular presentation of graylag geese or Martina.9 The first, “Anser anser,” offers an introduction to graylag geese in Lorenz’s early programmatic writings of the . A detailed analysis of the history of ethology as a discipline is beyond the intent and scope of this study. Rather, the paper proceeds from an understanding that Lorenz was considered an impor- tant figure in the establishment of the discipline. The concern here is to show how the goose was used by Lorenz to perform various aspects of his science as he was in the process of building his own scientific persona as a cofounder of a new discipline.

While it is likely that Lorenz based at least some of the observations in these early papers on observations of Martina, he did not yet mention her by name. Indeed, in these publications Lorenz was not interested in speaking of any one goose because he wanted to demonstrate the stereotyped behaviors that held true for the species of geese. </page> <page sequence="6"> 410 | M U NZ In the second part, “Ma and M,” we catch the first glimpses of an individ- uated Martina and her male companion Martin. This happens during the Nazi period in an article aimed at a specialist audience of German psychologists. The article would come to haunt Lorenz’s reputation and that of ethology. To date, several historians have focused on both his involvement with the Nazi Party— he joined in , shortly after Germany’s annexation of Austria—and his trou- bling writings about evolution and degeneration from this period.10 While my account corroborates their general conclusions, I concentrate instead on how— to appease this particular audience—Lorenz manipulated the description of his animals’ behaviors so as to facilitate the extrapolation from animal to human behavior. I offer a degree of detail here as to the precise character of the animals that were called upon to stand in for what were deemed desirable and undesir- able members of society. In an effort to appeal to the “new German psychol- ogy,” Lorenz presented the graylag Ma and M as paragons of successful pair bonding and contrasted them to the threatening and overly sexualized domes- tic-graylag hybrid geese. Thus, even as they were, for the first time, individu- ated, they simultaneously became representative, not so much of their species, as of a particular type—a pure type. The third part, “Martina and Martin,” focuses on the portrayal of the geese in Lorenz’s popular Er redete mit dem Vieh, den Vögeln und den Fischen (King Solomon’s Ring: New Light on Animal Ways), first published in . At this junc- ture, Lorenz presented imprinting as the formation of an intense personal bond between himself and Martina. His adaptation of Oskar Heinroth’s work is espe- cially revealing here: subtle differences between the two scientists’ accounts show how Lorenz constructed himself as a critical component of the imprinting dyad. In this new account aimed at general audiences, the geese were highly individua- lized and their habits and behaviors recounted as unique events. Lorenz became not just the father of the goose but also her faithful chronicler. The last section, “My First Goose,” offers the final portrayal of Martina in Lorenz’s  Here Am I—Where Are You? Against the backdrop of a science that had both matured and become somewhat dated, a radically different goose emerged: Martina was cast as an extra-scientific artifact of Lorenz’s own scientific development. That is, now Lorenz presented her not so much as a valid source of scientific data and information, but simply because she had been his first goose. Thus, Lorenz fully shifted the significance of the ani- mal from the scientific to the biographical. Surprisingly, where in the earliest .

Just as Lorenz’s science of the s and s had become somewhat marginalized in the scientific climate of the s, so too did Martina, its most famous product and subject, become marginalized in Lorenz’s writings. Thus, Lorenz’s creation of an increasingly public but highly variable Martina was co-constitutive of the establishment of his own scientific persona over the course of his career. Historians of science have emphasized the significance and role of animals in the development of the life sciences. Robert Kohler, in his groundbreaking work on T. H. Morgan’s fly group at Columbia University, explored the devel- opment of the fruit fly as a model organism for the field of genetics. In Kohler’s account, the development of both the fly and researchers gave rise to a new scientific moral economy and sociability that owed many of its features to the particular bodily and social features of the fly it studied. In the case of Lorenz and the goose, a similar story might be told in which Lorenz’s sociopolitical and scientific ambitions combined with the particular features of the goose to give rise to a particular program of animal behavior studies. But while this is, in part, the purpose of my paper, I do not think this sufficiently describes what happened in the case of Lorenz and Martina. My study of Martina’s varied lives, as recorded by Lorenz in his various writings, suggests that in those cases where animals are not merely tools for science but also objects of behavioral study, something stronger than the material agency of the organisms of science is required.11 Lorraine Daston and Gregg Mitman suggest that “even in cases of complete ventriloquism in which thinking with animals is reduced to a bla- tant projection of human thoughts, feelings, and fantasies, there is some added value in the fact that the blank screen for these projections is an animal.”12 The “blank screen for these projections” is of course never blank, and it behooves us to pay close attention to the nature of the beast and to distinguish between the standardized rat of the laboratory and Lorenz’s goose Martina. While we cannot . As such, the paper aligns itself with recent works in the history of science that focus on nonstandardized animals.

And this is how Lorenz presented her—as an animal with a unique biography, one that first chose Lorenz in lieu of another parent, picked a mate, and ultimately flew off. Lorenz’s devel- opment of Martina’s life alongside his own and across genres lent her a coherence and robustness that made her especially well suited to embody the changing aims of his science. As such, by focusing on Martina and Lorenz, the paper shows the important role individualized animals can play in the development of science and its practitioners.13 Even if an animal’s agency is highly constrained by its relation- ship to humans and their practices, its capacity for agency—whether real or imagined—makes it a powerful resource for scientists in the development and presentation of their work and personae.

Nonetheless, it was published in the Journal für Ornitho- logie and two years later made available in translation to Anglophone readers. Indeed, the piece was to become one of the primary vehicles through which scientists abroad would come to know his work.16 The essay was a lengthy exposition on the inborn social behaviors of birds and the kinds of physical and behavioral structures that triggered them.17 It was based on observations of hundreds of free-flying birds Lorenz had been keeping over the past several years at his home in Altenberg near Vienna.18 He painstakingly listed each species and the number of birds in his possession, because he “place[d] great value on keeping as many representatives of each kind as possible to prevent [him]self from making false generalizations.”19 But despite this assurance, his statements on graylag geese in the paper were based on only two adult animals, which he had received in the spring of  from the director of Vienna’s Schönbrunn Zoo, Otto Antonius. To make up for this dearth of firsthand experience, he relied on observations by his men- tor, the ornithologist and director of the Berlin Aquarium Oskar Heinroth, and on Bengt Berg, a nature writer whose photographs Lorenz greatly admired. Lorenz was especially interested in the kinds of inborn behaviors that caused other members of the species to behave in predetermined ways. For example, when a mother bird arrives at the nest, the sight of her offspring’s .

Lorenz labeled these triggers of instinctive behaviors—such as the open beak—“releasers” (Auslöser), a term that would become unmistakably associated with the new discipline of ethol- ogy. Releasers could be behaviors as well as physical structures. Of all the pos- sible stimuli a baby bird might send out, an inborn template or schema (later called the Innate Releasing Mechanism, IRM) in the mother bird caused her to respond to a unique combination of features (or releasers) in the young. This view was indebted to the Baltic theoretical biologist Jakob von Uexküll but also influenced by the Gestalt psychology Lorenz imbibed while studying with his teacher Karl Bühler.20 A companion described the way in which a conspecific appears to an animal in a particular context. Burkhardt’s transla- tion of the term as “buddy” aptly captures its meaning. The parent bird does not appear as a unified individual toward which the young directs all its inborn “child behaviors.” Rather, there are many functional contexts, which require a specific set of releasers and which, in turn, elicit specific behaviors. In some species, there might come a time when a parent bird incubates a new clutch of eggs and no longer allows an older offspring access to the nest. At this point, the parent will chase away the older offspring when it approaches. The older child flees, as its parent appears to it as an “enemy companion” and no longer as a “parent companion.” Thus, while the animal treats its parents in a manner appropriate to each context, it is not necessary for the offspring to carry with it a unified recognition of the other animal as its parent. According to Lorenz, the fragmentation of companions in a given species varied considerably. At one extreme of the continuum were what he termed mosaic types—birds that were born with many different preexistent, nonover- lapping templates. These included the jackdaws, which Lorenz had kept for . The paper was dedicated to Jakob von Uexküll on the occasion of his seventieth birthday. Lorenz had hosted von Uexküll on a couple of occasions in Altenberg in  and wrote enthu- siastically of the older scientist’s approach to animals.

The graylag geese, by contrast, were considered extreme “regulative types,” which meant they possessed a more unified conception of conspecifics and their behaviors towards them were far less automatic or “blind” than they were in other bird species.22 Where the extreme mosaic types resembled invertebrates in their behaviors towards members of their species, the graylag geese were deemed more like humans in their ability to recognize their con- specifics, not just as members of their species but as distinct individuals. Heinroth had already argued that among birds, the graylag geese behaved the most according to learned traditions rather than instinctive behaviors.23 Lorenz went so far as to characterize the animals’ lack of inborn behaviors as a “super achievement (Spitzenleistung)” among birds.24 He argued that this characteristic feature could be traced to the earliest moment of the goose’s social interactions—the moment of imprinting.25 Among birds, graylags were known to be “almost waiting” to imprint. Their imprinting was so complete and their companions so unified that they directed all subsequent child reactions at the object they encountered after hatching. Recall that Lorenz had kept only two of these animals by the time he wrote “Companionship in Bird Life,” and that he had received them as adults (well past the imprinting stage). Nonetheless, he felt that the phenom- enon was significant enough to describe here at some length. He quoted from Heinroth’s  paper on duck behavior: Without revealing any fear, the [freshly hatched goslings] quietly observe the human.

Imprinting was to provide an important conceptual and methodological tool for Lorenz. Some animals were so shy that no proper observations could be performed on them unless they imprinted on a human observer and the technique allowed him to draw distinctions between innate and inborn schema. </page> <page sequence="12"> 416 | M U N Z even for a short time, one cannot be rid of them so easily anymore. They squawk and tweet pitifully when one turns away and soon follow one faithfully. I have experienced that the creature just [a] few hours after I took it from the incubator was only happy when it could lay below the chair on which I was sitting!26 In the original, Heinroth went on to describe the failed attempts to reintroduce “the little orphan” to an established goose family with goslings of roughly the same age. Initially, he explained, the parents would mistake the newly added gosling for one of their own and direct aggressive behaviors toward the intruding human. But ultimately the reintroduction of the gosling would fail, not so much because of the adult animals but because of the obstreperous offspring: “The bad ending still awaits. The young gosling does not think of viewing the two old ones as members of its kind (Artgenossen). It runs away tweeting and if by chance a human happens to come by, it will follow him, [because] it considers humans its parents.”27 Thus, Heinroth’s account emphasized the irreversible “bad ending” of the wrongly imprinted animal. Although the goose “parents” might adopt the gosling into their fold, the young animal refuses to comply and runs after any human in the vicinity. “Such a creature,” Heinroth lamented, “is unfor- tunately only too trusting towards the human, a behavior which can become fairly unpleasant for it in a zoo.”28 As we shall see in Part III, Lorenz would later tell a strikingly similar story to popular audiences about his own “goose child Martina.” However, while Heinroth’s gosling presented a practical problem for the zookeeper interested in preserving and showing his animals without complications, Lorenz would reinvent the phenomenon as a power- ful tool of investigation. And where Heinroth’s gosling would just as soon run towards any human, Lorenz would emphasize his own role as ersatz parent.29 While the graylag geese were seen by Lorenz to be much like humans in their behaviors toward conspecifics, this did not mean that he saw them as behaving independent of strongly mechanical drives.

In , three years after “Companionship in Bird Life,” an essay based solely on the graylag goose appeared in the Zeitschrft für Tierpsychologie (Journal for Animal Psychology) as “Taxis und Instinkthan- dlungen in der Eirollbewegung der Graugans (Taxis and Instinctive Action in the Egg-Retrieving Behavior of the Graylag Goose).”30 Lorenz and another as-yet unknown young animal behaviorist, the Dutchman Niko Tinbergen, had done the research on which it was based during the spring of , when Tinbergen had traveled to Lorenz’s house in Altenberg to perform investiga- tions on bird behavior.31 The two scientists filmed and carefully analyzed the behaviors and move- ments of a goose when she rolls a stray egg back to her nest with the crook of her beak. They could take away the goose’s egg once she had begun her rolling motions and the animal would continue its motions unperturbed as if she was returning the phantom egg to its rightful place.32 Lorenz and Tinbergen explained that the empty execution of an instinct, once begun, suggested that seemingly complex sequences of movements were governed neither by insight into their ultimate purpose nor by further sensory input. The two scientists provided systematic empirical investigations of these beha- viors. By replacing the egg with oddly shaped objects, such as very large and lopsided artificial eggs and cubes, the scientists concluded that sensory input only affected the side-to-side movements to ensure that the egg would not slip out from under the animal’s neck. But the longitudinal motion towards the nest, once begun, would always and quite mechanically be brought to its con- clusion. While Lorenz had already written about the intercalation of instinc- tive behaviors and taxes in his  paper “Betrachtungen über das Erkennen der arteigenen Triebhandlungen der Vögel (Observations on the Recognition of Species-specific Instincts in Birds),” it was here that it would get its most memorable treatment. Indeed, scenes of black-and-white footage of this remarkable spectacle, in which a hand moves into the frame to snatch away the egg from under the goose’s neck mid-motion, have become classics in .

When he wrote up an extensive comparative duck study in , he discussed twenty different species of ducks and geese.34 The graylag goose was just a data point in this larger phylogenetic project (Fig. ). In “Companionship in Bird Life,” as I’ve shown, the geese were part of a larger investigation that was to set the theoretical foundations of a new science of beha- vior, which focused largely on instinctive behaviors. Lorenz at the time had observed only the two adult geese he had received from the Schönbrunn Zoo. Nonetheless, he afforded the animals an important place in this analysis. Along the continuum between the most instinctively governed and the most human-like birds, the graylags were deemed closest to humans, as few inborn templates deter- mined their social interactions. Nonetheless, Lorenz and Tinbergen showed in the “Egg-Retrieving” paper that geese too were very much governed by instincts. Once these instincts were set in motion, they progressed according to a rigid and mechanical sequence of events that not even an egg-gone-missing might abort. This meant that the animal did not need to have an understanding of the final goal of its actions as had been proposed by subjectivist psychologists. Nonetheless, according to Lorenz and Tinbergen, the behavior would be subject to evolutionary laws and therefore benefit the species. Because the behaviors of species and their relation to evolutionary descent were at the heart of these early programmatic publications, there were no traces of individual animals. This, despite Lorenz’s private enthusiasm for his goose Martina. But that was soon to change.

Lorenz continued to lecture and publish explicitly about the compatibility of his science with the goals of the German Reich, and more generally between evolutionary theory and National Socialism.42 In his party applica- tion, he professed that his “entire scientific life’s work, which foregrounds questions of descent (Stammesgeschichte), race, and social psychology, stands in the service of National Socialist thinking.”43 While not all of Lorenz’s writ- ings of this period were overtly racial or political, the problem of degeneration of instinctive behaviors through domestication, interbreeding, and urbaniza- tion would become a major part of his research program in the late s and early s.44 Here I focus on Lorenz’s  publication “Durch Domes- tikation” to consider his presentation of geese. As we shall see, Lorenz wrote about the very same individual animals—Martina and Martin—in this and later publications. But their portrayal here would offer striking contrasts to his postwar descriptions of the animals. In the paper, Lorenz argued that his findings would be especially useful to those entrusted with matters of selection, precisely because they focused on instinctive, that is, inborn behaviors. By presenting what he deemed to be “some extremely proximate inferences from the animal to the human,” he hoped that his own work might “seem suitable to opening the eyes of those called upon to [perform] selection to those values, which must necessarily fall under the purview of selection, because they are practically not modifiable through education.”45 He argued that the same types of abnormalities that were exhibited in domestic breeds were seen in overcivilized human inhabi- tants of urban spaces (Großstadtmenschen). In a by now oft-quoted final pas- sage, he pitched his impassioned plea on behalf of the racial health of the Völkskörper: This valuation of our species-specific and inborn social behaviors is of the highest biological importance, because in nothing other than in them lies so immediately .

Central to Lorenz’s argument was the claim that healthy, wild type animals and humans could be visually distinguished from their domesticated and degenerate counterparts. Always privileged in Lorenz’s writings, the skilled eye was called upon here to discern whether a member of the species was healthy or of the “invirent” type. The wild types shared certain features across species: They were lean, their bodies hard and capable of withstanding stren- uous exertion. In contrast, the domestic species were short, soft-bodied, and more closely resembled the neonatal features he would identify as the Kind- chenschema at the end of the paper. While members of a species felt an inborn aversion to those members of the species that suffered the effects of domesti- cation, this same ability was threatened in humans, who tellingly preferred what Lorenz considered horribly overwrought domesticated animals, such as pugs and poodles.47 In a letter to Oskar Heinroth dated January , , Lorenz included what he called a “‘caricature sketch,’ that shows those traits which are especially important to me in my current work” (Fig. ). In the left column he juxtaposed wild type animals with their domestic counterparts, drawn with an arrow to show the degenerative process over time. At the top of the animal column were the graylag and domestic goose. The right column was reserved for humans.

In the actual paper, Lorenz included photo- graphs (many of which originated either in Heinroth’s private collection or the archive of the Berlin Zoo). The strong visual component of the argument in the paper was accompa- nied by descriptions of (mostly mating) behavior in birds. Much of ethology </page> <page sequence="21"> “MY GOOSE CH I LD ” | 425 during this period and later focused on mating in birds, and Julian Huxley, with whom Lorenz had been in touch since , had famously published on the mating behavior of the great crested grebe.48 Here Lorenz compared the graylag goose, the domestic goose, and various hybrids he had been breed- ing. He felt that the graylag geese were especially well suited to observations on social behaviors, because they exhibited social and especially familial struc- tures that closely paralleled those of humans. In his  paper, Heinroth had emphasized that “[t]he main feature of the ethology of geese is the pro- nounced and deep family life.”49 According to Heinroth, the nuclear family bond of the geese was so strong that the animals did not engage in a pecking order within the family (which was undergirded by the strong pair bond between the male and female), but only between families.50 Following Heinroth’s lead, Lorenz argued that the mating routines of geese were to be seen as two separate functional events—the courting and the copulatory behaviors. In healthy, that is, purebred wild type birds, the pre- copulatory behaviors comprised what he termed the “falling in love” phase. According to Lorenz’s description, his geese fell in love with one another much like he believed humans did: suddenly and without warning. The male’s beha- vior especially changed completely as a consequence of this event. When in the company of “his chosen,” the bird would walk about with a notable strut, “turning himself curiously stiffly and self-importantly from right to left.”51 In addition, the bird undertook daring flying maneuvers in front of the female. These involved flying curves at high speed, wildly accelerating, and then preci- pitously stopping. He likened these behaviors to the foolhardy maneuvers of young men trying to impress women with their motorcycle antics—a compar- ison that struck close to home for Lorenz, who was an avid motorcyclist throughout much of his young adulthood and would be made motorcycle instructor in the German Wehrmacht before he was reassigned to psychological services (Fig. ).52 .

Courtesy of ÖsterreichischeNationalbibliothek, Vienna. In addition to these boastful behaviors of the male toward the female, Lorenz reported more subtle manifestations of “falling in love” between two geese. In a remarkable passage, he described how furtive glances suggested mutual affections between the animals: When one has learned to determine the sight lines of a bird and to follow his glances, which requires considerable practice, then one sees that the impressing gander generally keeps a very particular young goose in his view just as she glances at him. In the beginning of this mutual looking at one another (gegen- seitiges Sichansehen), it is extremely suggestive that each of the two birds quickly looks away when one meets the other’s eyes. This is especially the case with the virginal female.53 Here again Lorenz emphasized what skillful observations might reveal. The male’s overtures and the female’s coy responses, he argued, would soon lead to the second stage of courting—the “triumph cries.” . Lorenz, “Durch Domestikation” (ref. ), . </page> <page sequence="23"> “MY GOOSE CH I L D ” | 427 This next phase of courting began with the call-and-response “triumph cries” and subsequently transitioned into the pair’s joint defense of their chosen nesting spot, the nest itself, and ultimately the young. Lorenz called this alliance between the male and female the “fighting union,” which he also adopted from Heinroth. The female’s reluctance to mate was a prominent feature of the early back-and- forth between the male and the female. But rather than deeming this reticence an obstacle to the impending union, Lorenz considered it a necessary element of its fruition.54 In the absence of the female goose’s resistance, animals lapsed into premature and indiscriminate couplings.55 In Lorenz’s account, the strong pair bond of the healthy wild type animals was the only means by which monogamy could be achieved and indeed served as the foundation of a healthy family. As an example of this process, Lorenz offered the story of Martina, “the goose that had been raised by me in isolation,” and the gander Martin. The ani- mals were referred to as “Ma” and “M,” and described as “one of his most full- fledged (vollwertigste) goose pairs.” Lorenz reported that on March  following the year of Martin’s birth, the gander for the first time directed gentle triumph calls at Martina. Lorenz stressed that these triumph cries were uttered before there was any hint of head diving, which was the precursor to copulation. The same afternoon, he attacked the gander A, “the despot of the colony.” According to Lorenz, now Martin began increasingly to defend Martina. He even followed her on her nightly walks through the Lorenzes’ home into the living room and all the way up the winding staircase. He did so “with the greatest agitation, almost constantly hissing and intermittently emitting warn- ing cries.” This proved to Lorenz that the gander was willing to take great danger upon himself for the sake of his goose: “This accomplishment must strike anyone as heroic who knows what enormous inhibitions a wild, freely reared gander has towards entering an enclosed space.”56 In this account, these early signs of devotion served the goose couple well in their common future; the gander would remain forever faithful to his “spouse.” . The assumption that the female was more coy than the male in a mating situation was of course neither new nor uncommon in studies of animal behavior. Darwin’s theory of sexual selection famously hinged on the notion that females carefully select their mates.

It was, indeed, no accident that Lorenz praised Martin for his ability to withstand the advances of the hybrid females, as the latter posed a formidable challenge to the graylags’ domestic bliss: “Unmarried half-blood females were in the habit of answering the courting initiations of graylag couples by scaring away the female of the pair through violent attacks just as she assumed the mating position.” Without so much as a head submersion, the domestic females inserted themselves into the imminent pairing by assuming the coupling stance where the wild geese had lain just moments before.57 The early maturation of the animals’ sexual drives presented another manifestation of domestication. A domestic goose was generally ready tomate dur- ing her first year, while graylag geese reached full sexual maturity only in their third year. This sexual precociousness posed problems for the domestic animals, because the courting behaviors so critical to pair bonding did not develop apace. Conse- quently, the domestic geese’s behaviors were plagued by what Lorenz termed an “indiscriminate promiscuity” that was fueled by their rampant sexual appetites. From opportunistically attempting to snatch away the shy graylag’s rightful gander to youthful homosexual dalliances that were later replaced with indiscriminate incestuous relations, the domestic geese displayed a range of deviant sexual beha- viors, which compromised their prospects of forming long-term unions. This pro- blem was especially evident in females: “The restraint so characteristic of the wild type and critical to selection inmarriage formation is completely lost [in the hybrid geese] due to the off-the-charts strength of the coupling drive. This difference is especially crassly noticeable in the behavior of the young females.”58 To Lorenz’s mind, this absence of female restraint in domestic geese not only thwarted their familial prospects, it threatened to corrode the very fabric of goose society. How- ever, despite the females’ ceaseless efforts to secure a purebred male, “only the pure-blood females were ever ‘married’; the hybrids merely mated.”59 Heinroth had also distinguished between domestic and graylag geese. Like Lorenz, he believed that the domestic goose departed quite strongly from the graylag geese and that domestic traits were persistent and difficult to breed out of the race. Heinroth had reported certain “finer inhibitions” that were lost in domestic geese, including their reluctance to make noise. Domestic geese . Ibid., . . Ibid., . . Ibid., . </page> <page sequence="25"> “MY GOOSE CH I LD ” | 429 were also more likely to adopt a strange gosling as their own, had increased in body size, and lost much of their seeming willingness and ability to fly.60 But in contrast to Lorenz, Heinroth argued that these differences did not present the animals only with disadvantages. In a discussion of how domestic and graylag geese managed a fence barrier, Heinroth reported that the domes- tic geese were much more adept at finding a gap in the fence than the more flight-oriented graylags: “This ‘labyrinth experiment’ [that tests] their flight and crawling skills reveals the wild and domestic goose as capable in very diverging areas and in keeping with their differing physical predispositions. It is therefore difficult to draw general conclusions about their intelligence.”61 Thus, Heinroth was more likely to see the appearances of domestication as a trade-off in which some losses might be compensated by other gains. While the domesticated geese were far less willing and able to fly, they were much more enduring on foot than their wild counterparts. The passage also makes clear another aspect of the geese’s lives in Heinroth’s care. Unlike in Lorenz’s accounts, in which all traces of human intervention are downplayed or omitted, Heinroth’s writing contains unselfconscious traces of the jarring interactions among humans, animals, and the zoo environment. He told of throwing stones at geese that seemed unwilling to move out from under a bridge and shooting geese for unspecified reasons.62 In most cases, these events were presented as a consequence of animal management. Where Lorenz considered the trimming of wings in adult birds a potentially lethal intervention that caused the animals depression and could even lead to their death, Heinroth seems to have made wide use of the technique and offered no reflection on the potentially deleterious effects on the geese’s mental states.63 Even though Lorenz’s early account of the graylag geese owed much to that of Heinroth, his disdain for the domestic animals, especially in his Nazi publication, went beyond that of his mentor. Thus, at a time when Lorenz was especially keen to advance his own career and secure German sources of funding, Martina and Martin were called upon to embody and enact Nazi ideals of race purity and family harmony. In his effort to reach new audiences and establish his reputation as someone who was politi- cally reliable and at the forefront of a discipline that was compatible with and .

His expert vision, he suggested, was rele- vant not only to studies of animals, but could serve as a model for those entrusted with evaluating humans. In this construction of himself, Martina and Martin were presented as one of his “most full-fledged goose pairs, whose behavior cer- tainly differs especially little from that [of] normal free-living [animals].”64 He offered this conviction of the “normality” of their behaviors, despite the fact that Martina had been hand-reared and thoroughly imprinted on his person. Where an animal’s proximity to himself was identified as a source of concern in two ear- lier pieces on the jackdaw Tschock, he now glossed over his own role in the beha- vior of the animals. Instead, he argued, their complex social and family behaviors could best be explained by their inborn, that is, racial dispositions. When Martina and Martin flew away, Lorenz presented this too as a sign of the wild type animals’ superior standards in this telling. Domestic geese were quite content to cram into any space available to them, while the gray- lags had to rear their young in suitably undisturbed conditions: “Unfortu- nately, precisely this pair flew away after they were repeatedly bothered during their search for a nesting site by other birds.”65 PART I I I—MARTINA AND MARTIN A chapter in Er redete mit dem Vieh entitled “The Goose Child Martina” ensured that Martina was known not just to Lorenz’s scientific collea- gues but also to a large lay readership.66 Since the second half of the .

The  King Solomon’s Ring fit well within the tradition of many of the most prominent scientific authors writing for wider, popular audiences and thereby contributing to the education of the Bildungsbürgertum.68 The book was adorned with Lorenz’s own illustrations and would become an international hit; it went through some forty printings and was translated into twelve foreign languages (including Danish, Chinese, Afrikaans, and Serbian). In it, Lorenz again returned to the moment of imprinting that he had des- cribed in his “Companion” piece. But now, instead of relying on Heinroth’s account, he told in his own words of his first encounter with the gosling Martina. After removing one of the eggs from an incubating clutch, Lorenz watched the chick slowly labor out of its confinement. Soon after hatching, the little animal looked up and held its onlooker’s gaze. The emphasis on this event is of course significant in light of Lorenz’s science—it dramatized the moment of imprinting and in the story marks the point after which the animal was irreversibly devoted to him.69 .

I pushed my goose child deep under the old one’s soft warm belly and was convinced of having done my part. But much remained to be learned. After I sat in front of the doghouse for a few minutes in happy contemplation, a quiet questioning whisper sounded from beneath the white one: wiwiwiwiwi? The old goose replied placatingly in matter-of-fact fashion with the same call [Stimmfühlunglaut] but in her own pitch: gangangangang. But instead of calming down, like any reasonable goose child would have, mine quickly crawled out from under the feathers, looked up with one eye into the foster mother’s face and promptly ran from her loudly crying: pfühp, pfühp, pfühp. That’s approxi- mately what the abandonment call of the immature graylag goose sounds like, which all nest-fleeing birds share to some extent. Stretching tall while calling relentlessly, the poor child stood halfway between the goose and me. Then I made a small movement—the crying immediately stopped and the child came running with its outstretched neck, eagerly greeting me: wiwiwiwi.70 Lorenz’s cartoon-like description of his “goose child,” who took one look at its designated foster mother before running screaming the other way is, of course, charming and highly evocative of human relations. But just when the narrative threatened to lapse into crude anthropomorphism, he provided readers with scientific context to remind them of his pedagogical intentions.71 Lest his reader overindulge the notion that the “pfühp, pfühp, pfühp” was akin to a child running away while wailing for its mother, he explained that the call had ornithological meaning. Such allusions to more technical reasoning and information were frequent in his popular writings but only rarely fol- lowed up by clarification or more detailed information. In the book, Lorenz’s successive attempts to place the gosling with its intended foster mother were unsuccessful. Although he knew the phenomenon well from Heinroth’s writings (as we saw in Part I), he framed the encounter as though he had been surprised by the gosling’s sudden attachment. Lorenz assured his read- ers that despite this at times trying level of attachment, Martina was “a wonder- fully good child” whose attachment was due to an evolutionary imperative rather than obstinacy. In nature, he instructed, being separated from its mother and sib- lings spelled certain death for a little bird. To accommodate the gosling’s urges, . Lorenz, Er redete (ref. ), . .

The account begins quite literally wrapped around one of Lorenz’s drawings of the flying geese (Fig. ). The text surrounding the flying flock of geese explained: “One misty spring morning I went down to the Danube. The river was still shrunk to its winter proportions, and migrating goldeneyes, mergansers, smews, and here and there a flock of bean- or white-fronted geese came flying along its dark and narrowed surface. Among these migrants, quite as if they belonged to them, a flock of graylag geese winged its way.”73 The majestic beauty of the geese soaring overhead was a common trope in Lorenz’s writings. But here the story was not just about their beguiling appearance. When Lorenz saw the animals flying overhead, he recognized one of the birds. He wrote: I could see that the goose flying second on the left of the triangular phalanx had lost a primary. And in this moment there flashed across my inward eye vivid reminiscences of this goose with its missing primary and of all that had hap- pened when it was broken. For, of course, these were my graylag geese; there are indeed no others on the Danube even at migration time. The second bird on the left wing of the triangle was the gander Martin.74 It turns out that Martin’s missing primary feather had resulted from an accident in Lorenz’s house. Martin had followed Martina inside, despite his trepidations: Among the graylag geese, the young betrothed [gander] now accompanied his bride like a shadow. But because Martina moved about all of our rooms com- pletely freely and fearlessly, without concerning herself after the groom, [who] grew up outdoors, he was compelled to dare enter unknown spaces. When one knows of the compunctions of the graylag goose, which is a bird of free spaces, to even just venture between shrubs and under trees, Martin appears to us a little hero, as he followed his beloved with outstretched neck through the main door and into the main hall and then even up the stairs all the way to the bedroom.75 .

Although this was also to some extent true of his writings aimed at scientists, subtle shifts in language between the professional and popular writings may be gleaned. Where in the domestication paper (discussed in Part II) Lorenz had called the gander’s actions seemingly “heroic,” here he designated the ani- mal itself a “little hero.” Similarly, while in the previous recountings the gan- der’s brave venture into the Lorenz home was portrayed as a repeated display of his devotion, here it is presented as a singular event that would forever leave its mark, not just on Lorenz, but also on the animal’s body: I still see him standing in the room, his feathers flattened against his body with fear, shivering with tension, but proudly erect and challenging the great unknown by loud hisses. Then suddenly the door behind him shut with a bang. To remain steadfast now was too much to ask even of a graylag goose hero. He spread his wings and flew, straight as an arrow, into the chandelier. The latter lost a few appendages, but Martin lost a primary. So that is how I know about the missing feather of the goose flying second in the left wing of the triangle.76 Thus, Lorenz taught his reader through text, image, and narrative how to recognize Martin from the generic flock of his fellow geese. The geese in King Solomon’s Ring were highly individualized and closely tied to Lorenz’s person. Their significance with respect to Lorenz was reflected in the animals’ human names; Martin became engaged to Martina and got his name because of his association with her and the increased proxi- mity this brought him to Lorenz. The scientist explained that “before, he was just a number, because only the geese that are hand-reared by me receive a name.” Here the individual animal rather than its race or species came to the fore just as general occurrences of previous writings were now dramatized to convey biographical events. When Lorenz tried to push the gosling towards its “intended foster mother,” the animal rebelled. Thus, Lorenz told a story of resistance and devotion between the lines of his popular account. And while this brings us scarcely closer to a reliable recovery of animal agency as it was exercised in Lorenz’s home in the mid-s, a strong, rhetorical agency was on display at least in the pages of his popular book. In effect, this strongly biographical telling elided interpretive moments—the animals lived their lives . Ibid., . </page> <page sequence="32"> 4 36 | M U NZ while Lorenz recorded. In an effort to present not just his animals but also himself to his readers, Lorenz on occasion broke the richly affective narrative to insert references to the lessons of his science. The gosling Martina’s call served an evolutionary function, and the geese flying overhead were not ordinary geese, but rather Lorenz’s graylags. In this way, Martina and Martin were enlisted to help carry the man and his science to the public long before Lorenz was honored with a share of the Nobel Prize. PART IV—“MY FIRST GOOSE” In , Lorenz published for the last time about Martina in his goose magnum opus, Hier bin ich—wo bist du? (Here I Am—Where Are You?).77 Here I Am offered a comprehensive account of the behaviors and develop- ment of graylag geese and was a remarkably thorough testament to Lorenz’s science. By the time the book appeared, Lorenz was in his mid-eighties and half a century had passed since Martina had hatched from her egg. The inter- vening period spanned much of Lorenz’s professional life and the coming of age of the science of ethology. But the most active centers of ethological activ- ity had shifted to Great Britain and the U.S., and Lorenz had endured a sub- stantial attack at the hands of a young American scientist, Daniel Lehrmann. Many of his conceptual innovations of the s had suffered erosion, and the field of animal behavior studies had developed a strong quantitative thrust that lay beyond Lorenz’s inclination and skills.78 Nonetheless, in his native Austria and in continental Europe, more generally, Lorenz remained a highly visible and much-adored public figure and came to be known as the father of ethology. He had become a vocal opponent of proposed nuclear and hydro- electric power plants in Austria and a public decrier of the ills of modern civi- lization through his controversial writings on human and animal aggression.79 Journalists continued to be drawn to the man and his work and often paired their pieces with photographs of the bearded scientist and his goslings walking along garden paths or of their swimming together in the Danube (Fig. ). .

In , the same year he traveled to Stockholm to receive the Nobel Prize, Lorenz retired from his institute in Seewiesen and once again moved with his geese, this time from Seewiesen in Oberbayern to a research station in Grünau in upper Austria.80 The research station was set in the midst of a large game preserve and housed around  geese, some of which could be traced back to a colony of geese he had established in  (at his first Max Planck Society– funded research station in Buldern, Germany). The new research station boasted three lakes that allowed the geese to spend all four seasons in the vicinity.81 The geese no longer lived in the Lorenz home and the science practiced by the Lorenzians in Grünau had become a decidedly collective endeavor. . The Max Planck Society, the German Academy of Sciences, and the Cumberland Foun- dation ensured that Lorenz and his collaborators would be able to continue their work on geese.

Ibid., . </page> <page sequence="34"> 4 38 | M U NZ Reflecting these changes and Lorenz’s advanced age, Here I Am was authored with the help of two of his young collaborators, Michael Martys and Angelika Tipler. By the time of the book’s publication, generations of students had successfully reared goslings; some of them had become etholo- gists in their own right. Lorenz’s students and successors had expanded on his work to give detailed accounts of the social role of triumph calls, the peck- ing order within and between goose families, and the adverse effects of stress on the development of geese.82 The emphasis in Grünau was on longitudinal studies that tracked and chronicled the animal over the course of its life. Beyond the individual animal, the goal was to study the flock over genera- tions and as a complex social unit. Lorenz now explicitly aligned his work with other long-term longitudinal studies, including Jane Goodall’s work on chimpanzees and Masao Kawai and Shunzo Kawamura’s study of macaques on Japan’s island of Koshima.83 Logs were kept over the course of the indivi- dual animal’s life that tracked its dates of birth and death as well as mating behaviors and important social alliances and interactions. A small group of technicians coded the birds’ behaviors for statistical processing. It was against this backdrop that Lorenz now declared, “‘The graylag goose,’ of which so many authors and I myself have spoken, does not exist.”84 But to be sure, despite this disavowal of the single animal that stood for all others, such declaration marked a change of rhetoric and sensibility more than a true rejec- tion of typological thinking. Indeed, it was in the context of Lorenz’s endur- ing fascination with the normal and abnormal that Martina would take on her final role on behalf of his science. In a chapter dedicated to Martina, Lorenz acknowledged the substantial passage of time since he had kept the goose. But he assured readers that the animal lived on vividly in his memory and that he felt confident that he could retell her life story accurately.85 And yet, despite the professed fidelity of his recollections, we find in these pages a goose remarkably altered from her ear- lier instantiations. As such, the account serves perhaps less as a time capsule of Lorenz’s early science than it offers us a glimpse of a lens polished by the intervening decades of research and scientific ambitions. Where Martina had served in his  piece as the premier example of her species and a . Ibid., . . Ibid., . . Ibid., . . Ibid., . </page> <page sequence="35"> “MY GOOS E CH I L D ” | 4 39 member of his “most full-fledged pair,” she was now thickly wrapped in qualifications and dysfunction: “Based on our current level of knowledge, her life story does not at all conform to that of a ‘normal’ graylag goose, because she was from the very beginning reared inappropriately (nicht artgerecht) and under much stress.”86 Ever the astute reader of the winds of social change and trends, Lorenz now couched his description of Martina in ethically inflected language. The s and s were a time of intensifying concerns with animal rights, especially in Britain but also in Germany and Austria. Much of this discussion focused on the appropriate keeping and care of livestock and poultry as well as animals used in scientific research. In response to growing public pressure, Germany and Austria passed far-reaching legislation to protect animals in these industries in  and , respectively.87 Lorenz’s final account of Martina reflected this trend in its repeated emphasis on the damage the goose suffered because she was reared under conditions inappropriate to her kind. In Here I Am, Lorenz also suggested that the circumstances of Martina’s early life had compromised the scientific validity of the work conducted on her. He now relegated the formerly “scientific” observations of the animal to a section entitled “Chance Observations on Martina.” Nonetheless, he believed that it was important to include the account in the book: “By start- ing with the life story of my first goose, I do my best to show the develop- ment of my own knowledge of graylag geese.”88 Thus, Lorenz invoked the story of Martina in an effort to construct a scientific autobiography, and the stories of the man and his goose were here self-consciously juxtaposed and entwined. Once again, the account began with the moment of imprinting. Lorenz recounted how the freshly hatched gosling Martina refused to relent in her devotion once she set her sights on him. Much like in his popular account, Lorenz recounted the gosling’s attachment in endearingly droll terms: “Understandably I was moved to the highest degree [by] how the poor child came after me crying loudly all the while it was still toddling and sometimes .

The meaning of this was clear: It considered me its mother, not the white domestic goose.”89 Here, like in his popular piece, Martina was presented with will and agency. The meaning of her behavior was clear: she considered Lorenz her mother and acted accordingly. But despite the familiarity of the anecdote, the tone of the account and many of its details differ in remarkable ways from the earlier tellings. For the first time, we learn of Martina’s brothers and sisters. The gosling, it turns out, was not the only goose that imprinted on Lorenz that spring. Of the twenty eagerly anticipated graylag goose eggs, Lorenz had ten incubated by a domesticated goose. Of these, Martina was the first to hatch. Lorenz decided to lead all the goslings from the clutch but intended to tie Martina especially closely to his person by keeping her somewhat separate from the other goslings. Although the exact mechanics of this attempt are unclear, Lorenz was now unambiguous about its failure: “As soon became evident, the isolated gosling [Martina] followed me much less well than the sibling flock in its entirety. Martina alone was constantly somewhat ‘nervous,’ that is, ready to flee. She tended to utter the cries of abandonment and seemed overall less active than the other goslings in the flock.” Lorenz’s follow-up sentence is also revealing of the transformation of his explanatory framework. He continued, “The feed- back [of] social stimuli is indispensable to the maintenance of a normal level of general arousal.”Here the appeals to “feedback” and “general arousal” as expla- nations of Martina’s behavior are startlingly different to the earlier descriptions of the animals and especially Martina. The terms were consistent with the cybernetically inflected Here I Am. In this late work, the goose could only be understood as part of a larger whole or system in which social stimuli were received and sent out; the flock provided an essential context to the develop- ment and analysis of individual behaviors.90 In addition to the negative effects Martina suffered because of her isolation from her species mates, Lorenz himself appeared now as a source of stress and disturbance in her development. He ruefully conceded to having made “many mistakes, the roughness and brutality of which I realized only much later.” Lorenz had privately written in letters about eating some of his experimental animals and had reported high mortality rates among his experimental ani- mals during cold snaps and food shortages. But this was the first such public . Ibid., –. . Ibid., , . </page> <page sequence="37"> “MY GOOSE CH I LD ” | 441 admission of ill treatment of an animal at his hands. He recalled having led Martina through the busy streets of Altenberg, where “curious people, dogs, and noisy vehicles” constantly accosted her. When all this became too much for the animal, Lorenz would take her under his arm. This treatment, he explained, had caused the animal severe stress and had led her to “develop more poorly than her foster siblings and . . . caused her to reach sexual matur- ity earlier.”91 As in his earlier piece, early sexual maturation was invoked as a symptom of abnormal development and disturbance. But in contrast to his earlier account, it was Martina who now suffered from the condition. The courting and mating between Martin and Martina also underwent changes in this telling. We now learn that the animals mated when they were only around one year old. In addition, Lorenz for the first time wrote of Martin’s provenance. The gander, it turns out, had hatched from the same clutch of graylag eggs that gave rise to Martina. But their pairing, Lorenz assured, had been “completely ‘normal’” because the two animals did not recognize one another as siblings. Nonetheless, the exemplary restraint and enduring bond of Martina and Martin that had previously served as the pin- nacle of purebred superiority were now all but forgotten and replaced with the possibility of an incestuous union. Closely connected to these unintended abuses that Martina had suffered at the hands of the inexperienced scientist were the harms she endured in her ill- suited environment. The Lorenz home no longer served as the amiable space of the gentleman scientist and his favorite charge but instead became an inap- propriate place for the animal and the science. Teaching her to ascend the stairs to the upper story and bedroom—of which he had previously written enthusiastically—now became a source of trial and stress for the animal. Early on in their cohabitation, Lorenz would simply carry the gosling up the stairs. But eventually she learned to ascend them on her own. About the latter achievement, Lorenz wrote, “Although this exerts the little goose tremen- dously, it nonetheless taxes her nervous system less than being grabbed and carried.”92 While training Martina to ascend the stairs, Lorenz also observed the per- sistence of habitual behaviors. Geese, he informed his readers, tend toward the light. Martina would at first run to the window each time he brought her into the living room. Gradually he was able to entice her to leave the . Ibid., , . . Ibid., . </page> <page sequence="38"> 442 | M U NZ window and make her way first to the stairs and eventually up them. But even when the animal had learned to climb the stairway, she would still make a brief pause and then a sharp angular kink towards the window on her way to the stairs. On one occasion, she allegedly left out this digression to the win- dow and went straight up the stairs only to freeze moments later on the fifth stair, turn around, and recover the missed motion to the window. This “sla- vish adherence” to a behavior, he reasoned, was a consequence of the species’ lack of causal reasoning and capacity for abstraction.93 In this final account, then, Martina harbored certain similarities to the generic instantiation of Anser anser of the s. Like the goose that continued to roll her nonexistent egg toward the nest, so too did Martina now rigidly move toward light like invertebrates and phototropic plants were known to do. As is known from Lorenz’s previous accounts, Martina and Martin did not linger long. Shortly after they mated, the animals took flight never to be seen again. While Lorenz again raised the possibility that the birds left because they did not find a suitable nesting place near his home, he now offered an additional explanation in keeping with the general tenor of the book: “What seems to me today more probable, [is that] they withdrew themselves by their escape from the stress to which they were constantly exposed.”94 Thus, where Martina began her public life as Lorenz’s healthiest animal, the best example of graylag fidelity and fitness, she ended her career much like Tschock the jackdaw, as Lorenz’s most neurotic little charge. In Here I Am, the entwinement of Lorenz’s scientific persona with Martina’s life had become so complete that Lorenz included the biography of the goose as a testament of his own scientific development. Just as Lorenz had become a world-famous scientist, so Martina, too, had become known to thousands of readers. But while in the earlier accounts she had been exemplary of Lorenz’s successful blending of home and science, she now showed signs of stress and strain pre- cisely because of her social isolation, treatment by Lorenz, and inappropriate environment. She was now adduced as the embodied critique of his earlier science.95 Thus, at the same time that Lorenz claimed her as “his first goose,” he disowned her as a useful member of his scientific flock. And yet, as the first companion to the man who spoke goose, her value was inestimable and went . Ibid., . . Ibid., . .

Indeed, she accompanied him on the messy and winding path of the establishment of his science and persona. CONCLUSION Lorraine Daston and Otto Sibum locate the scientific persona “between the individual biography and the social institution: a cultural identity that simul- taneously shapes the individual in body and mind and creates a collective with a shared and recognizable physiognomy.”96 The image we have of Konrad Lorenz fits this description well. Over the course of his long career, he emerged as a kind of larger-than-life animal charmer and scientific pioneer, who spoke on issues that included human aggression, the ills of ecological exploitation, domestication, and not least, the complex instincts that govern animal and human behaviors. But as the Spiegel obituary with which I opened demonstrates, memory played homage not just to the man and his accom- plishments, but also to his favored research subject—the goose Martina. In this paper, I have gathered and juxtaposed some of the remarkably differ- ent instantiations of the geese and especially Martina against the backdrop of Lorenz’s efforts to establish a new science of animals. In his early programmatic essay “Companionship in Bird Life,” Lorenz was eager to establish his scientific credentials and sought to provide a new theoretical basis for inborn behaviors. In this account, the graylag geese provided an important conceptual counter- point to most other birds, because few inborn schemas governed their beha- viors. Unlike in earlier studies, in which Lorenz had dismissed Tschock the jackdaw as a “captivity specimen” and “runt (Kümmerling),” he now celebrated as their most valuable feature the graylag geese’s propensity to imprint.97 Following Oskar Heinroth’s account, he described the initial encounter between a human and a graylag. Once fixed on a parent object, the animal directed all its complex social behaviors at unified, individual animals—be they goose or human. But unlike Heinroth, who presented imprinting as a problem for zoo animals that would approach any humans freely, Lorenz placed himself firmly at the center of his interactions with Martina. Imprinting, for Lorenz, became a means of staging not only his animals but also himself and his science. .

Lorenz, “Beiträge” (ref. ). </page> <page sequence="40"> 444 | M U NZ In the late s and early s, as Lorenz sought to bring himself and his science in alignment with the political and scientific climate of the German Reich under National Socialism, he emphasized the sexually incontinent behaviors of domestic-graylag hybrid females. In their licentious advances on virtually any gander that moved (but especially those “happily” mated to purebred females), these animals posed a threat to the harmony of goose society. Thus, just as Lorenz styled himself a reliable Nazi to German collea- gues and funding bodies, so too did he slot the geese into the racial and social categories of Nazi ideology; Martina and her gander Martin (Ma and M) were written to model the virtuous domestic bliss of the sexually contained wild type in allusion to their rural, human counterparts. In the popular King Solomon’s Ring, Lorenz’s postwar animals were richly affective and evocative of the familial. The story of imprinting (with which Lorenz was well acquainted by the time Martina emerged from her egg) was retold here with an element of surprise. The account was not so much about the phenomenon of imprinting, in general, as it was about a particular animal and its relation to Lorenz. Where in the earlier account Martina had represented wild type animals and rural peoples, here she emerged as his goose child (Fig. ). And it was this richly biographized animal that would play a central role in establishing Lorenz as a household name in German-speaking Europe and beyond. By the s, Lorenz and Martina had attained scientific cult status. But the science of ethology had changed considerably, and even those of Lorenz’s stu- dents who followed in his footsteps with respect to the study of geese embraced new ways of keeping and studying the animals. The geese of Grünau roamed large, open spaces, and long-term longitudinal studies were designed to interfere as little as possible with the animals’ social structures and behaviors. Much of Lorenz’s Here I Am paid tribute to this new approach and explicitly referenced longitudinal primate studies and the ethics of keeping animals for scientific research. In this context, in which researchers carefully negotiated tensions between habituation and contamination of the animals they studied, Lorenz’s former science seemed quaint and out-of-date. Martina, too, had lost much of her former luster—she was now stressed and abused and came to embody all that was wrong with Lorenz’s early ways. By rendering her irrelevant to his science but significant to his intellectual development, Lorenz fully folded the biography of his “first goose Martina” into his own. Thus, as Lorenz pushed Martina to the margins of his scientific flock, she came to occupy a central role in the crafting of his scientific self. </page> <page sequence="41"> “MY GOOSE CH I LD ” | 445 FIG. 7: A cartoon by Sidney Harris that poked fun at Lorenz for American audiences, published in Discover Magazine, Aug 1981.

From Lorenz’s writings over the years, there emerged an increasingly strong sense of biographical richness and coherence to the goose Martina that played centrally into Lorenz’s creation of his scientific persona. It was precisely the establishment of Martina as an animal with her own, recognizable biography that lent her a literary coherence and agency that elided much of Lorenz’s </page> <page sequence="42"> 446 | M U NZ interpretive maneuverings—Martina had a life and lived it; Lorenz merely recorded and reported, or so the story went. Lorenz made the gosling his pre- mier example of imprinting and presented the phenomenon as a moment of unexpected resistance and agency. Martina rejected the intended foster mother and instead chose Lorenz. And while it is likely neither more nor less possible to recover a reliable account of agency for the goose as she lived and breathed than it is for the fruit fly, Martina’s evolving persona as a biographized and individualized animal offered a broad range of rhetorical agency that Lorenz could deploy in his accounts. It was through Martina’s capacity for agency, then, and Lorenz’s skillful mobilization of this resource to his own ends, that the biographies of the man and his goose coalesced. As such, their case offers a valuable example of how the animal with its own, distinct persona—as opposed to animals that serve merely as standardized tools or objects of study—can serve the scientist as a powerful ally in the evolving project of science and self.
