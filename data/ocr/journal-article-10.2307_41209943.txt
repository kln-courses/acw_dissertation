<plain_text><page sequence="1">Wordsworth's Urban Theater and the Imaging of Community Nicole LaRose University of Florida William Wordsworth's contentious relationship with the city is often la- beled by literary scholars as contempt. But the dismissal does not consider Wordsworth's struggle to explain his understanding of London, particularly his understanding of rapidly developing industrial capitalism. Rethinking Words- worth's opinion on and use of London suggests a new understanding of Words- worth's attitude toward place. The focus on place permits, on one hand, a recon- sideration of key passages in Wordsworth studies, specifically "Composed Upon Westminster Bridge" and the seventh book of The Prelude. The focus on theo- ries of place also elucidates how Wordsworth recognized the spectacular nature of the metropolis and responded theatrically to the alienation caused by the me- tropolis. Wordsworth's attempt to reconcile the alienation of the city with the imagination permitted in nature reveals a more completely defined idea of Wordsworth's idea of the imagination. The breadth of Wordsworth's poetry proves that he preferred the country to the city for nurturing the imagination, but he did not absolutely demonize and detest the city, particularly London. Instead, Wordsworth became a cautious and critical traveler to the captial, one who at- tempted to intellectualize his preference for the natural life by understanding worldly differences on display in London. The city became a way for him to develop more fully the relationship between place and the imagination. In London, Wordsworth found imaginative stimulation in the theater and the theatricality of the environment. Wordsworth came to London for his longest stay after earning his degree at Cambridge in 1791; this foundational visit serves as the chronological referent for the seventh book of The Prelude, "Residence in London" (7.57-72). l He visited London several more times during the following years. As his perpetual return suggests, Wordsworth was drawn to and intrigued by the captial city. Book Seven reveals a young Wordsworth quite excited by the creative prospects of the London theater: [E]nough is said To shew what thoughts must often have been mine At theatres, which then were my delight, A yearning made more strong by obstacles Which slender funds imposed. Life then was new, The senses easily pleased; the lustres, lights, The carving and the gilding, paint and glare, _</page><page sequence="2">And all the mean upholstery of the place, Wanted not animation in my sight (7.436-44) More so than any other aspect in London, Wordsworth characterizes the theater with absolutely positive "delight," and he attaches a profound "yearning" for the theater to satisfy what he calls "The senses easily pleased." Using language characteristic of his response to the natural, Wordsworth describes how the thea- ter sparked his senses and imagination through its beauty, original perspective, and specific detail. But despite the many theaters in London, Wordsworth can- not fulfill his desire for the theater because of "slender funds." Wordsworth's acknowledgement of both the commodity of the theater and the alienation of capital indicates an awareness of how the economics of the city rules the day-to- day. In substitution for trips to the theater, he becomes a spectator of the theatri- cality of London street life, most obvious in the climactic Bartholomew Fair scene. Although reading the theatricality of London in The Prelude is not a new critical strategy,2 I intend to show that Wordsworth's performance of London reveals that his discomfort with the urban environment derives from material concerns about subjectivity and community, not from a preference for the natu- ral that requires a binary between the natural and the urban. Disavowing this binary reveals Wordsworth as an epistemological poet concerned with the spaces of community - spaces that proffer a Utopian existence through a collec- tivity of imagination. London does not provide Wordsworth with the spaces he comes to find absolutely necessary, but it does make the desire for such spaces obvious. Wordsworth's interest in the theater teeters between the hope for mere en- tertainment and the hope for profound imaginative growth. Early in the book when the poet sets the scene for his eventual experiences in London, it is clear that his expectations for the visit to the city lack preconceived expectations: Yet undetermined to what plan of life I should adhere, and seeming thence to have A little space of intermediate time Loose and at full command, to London first I turned, if not in calmness, nevertheless In no disturbance of excessive hope, At ease from all ambition personal, Frugal as there was need, and though self-willed, Yet temperate and reserved, and wholly free From dangerous passions (7.63-72) As characteristic of youthful idleness, Wordsworth reveals here that he comes to the city without having made up his mind about how the environment will affect him. He is willing to allow this visit to open him up to the "spots of time" 75</page><page sequence="3">(11.258) most often found in the natural; the similar diction in the phrase "A little space of intermediate time" shows his willingness for the city to spark his imagination. Although "not in calmness," he does not mandate an inevitable fall or an essential transcendence from this experience. He has not come to London expecting moral corruption, like the fate of the son in "Michael." Conversely, he learned when a young schoolmate traveled to London that one could emerge from the environment with ". . . the same / Appearance, the same body, not to find / Some change, some beams of glory brought away / From that new region" (7.101-04). He has conditioned himself to maintain an open mind and welcomes the theatricality embodied within London. Locating the origin of theatricality within the environment, and not the poet, is an important distinction for this ar- gument. Although Wordsworth's performance brings the theater to life, it is a response to his environment just like much of his country poetry is a response to the natural environment. In London: The Biography, Peter Ackroyd explains the "essential theatricality of the city" by acknowledging Wordsworth's perspective (152). Ackroyd goes as far as to lump Wordsworth with the more traditionally celebrated London writers, Lamb, Macaulay, Boswell, and Dickens: "For each of these Londoners, whether by birth or adoption, the theatricality of London is its single most important characteristic" (152). Ackroyd calls Wordsworth a Londoner because of Wordsworth's intuitive understanding of the metropolis at a time when rapid development made absolute knowledge impossible. Wordsworth makes the theatricality most apparent through his repetition of catalogues, much like a list of characters, and their corollary descriptions. These descriptions set the stage, embedding narrative within the scene instead of per- mitting the poet to create it himself. One of the first catalogues establishes an aristocratic scene: Marvellous things My Fancy had shaped forth, of sights and shows, Processions, Equipages, Lords and Dukes, The King, and the King's Palace, and not last Or Least, heaven bless him The renowned Lord Mayor (7.108-12) This catalogue reveals two features that recur throughout the listings; first, the fantastic representation of spectacle, and second how the spectacular reveals and critiques the political environments displayed through the listings. Wordsworth explains that this listing of empowered characters is a fantasy, and then he con- trasts it with the later multicultural listing that reveals the reality of the city's "thickening hubbub" (7.227): Among the crowd, conspicuous less or more, As we proceed, all specimens of man Through all the colours which the sun bestows, And every character of form and face; HI</page><page sequence="4">The Swede, the Russian; from the genial South, The Frenchman and the Spaniard; from remote America, the Hunter-Indian; Moors, Malays, lascars, the Tartar and Chinese, And Negro Ladies in white muslin gowns (7.235-43) In this section, Wordsworth thoroughly captures the heterogeneous nature of London; similarly, Ackroyd explains London: "The city's topography is a pal- impsest within which all the most magnificent or monstrous cities of the world can be discerned" (771). Wordsworth's cast of characters includes such variety, extending beyond the expected nationalities of immigrants or visitors, that Wordsworth constructs a global environment - the scene is a construct of "all specimens of man," including an anachronistic palimpsest that merges individ- ual histories into the global. By defining these people as what they represent, Wordsworth displays an example of Guy Debord's definition of spectacle: "All that once was directly lived has become mere representation" (12). Although Debord's argument derives from the specific historical developments of the twentieth century, he bares comparison to Wordsworth because each responds to rapid commercialization and corruption of identity; each addresses the corrup- tion and disruption caused by different stages in the development of capitalism. While Wordsworth's catalogue has the potential for a Utopian community (he even includes females and everybody seems to be getting along [243]), the lack of an English representative in the crowd suggests a problematic. The first list, because of its aristocratic characters, insinuated only the English within the city, but this catalogue only includes the singular Englishman, Wordsworth, and highlights the alienation of the metropolis. The difference between the two lists epitomizes Kristina Straub's argument about how spectacles can affect observ- ers. By looking at eighteenth-century theater, Sträub identifies that an "empiri- cal, rational observer" would establish self-identity by defining the observed as "other" (3). By not including a referent for the English in the catalogue, Words- worth questions the subjectivity of all inhabitants of a city - including the objec- tified others and the crowd-intoxicated poet. It is not inconsequential that Wordsworth follows this stanza with a stanza about "the Spectacles / Within doors" (7.245-46), which includes the panorama exhibitions. These simulacra enclose reality within an easily ordered and understandable framework, which contradicts the city's actual character of chaotic, endless proliferation. In his work on Victorian writings of the city, Julian Wolfreys explains this conflict: "Theatricality proffers a form of shallow textuality, beyond which there is no discernible anterior meaning; it thus promotes the play of difference typical of the city which appalls Wordsworth, through the constant recycling of imitations and simulacra" (125). Besides an emotional response, which Wolfreys sees as 77</page><page sequence="5">disgust, we must address what type of textual mask Wordsworth actually selects. If he does, as Wolfreys argues, choose "citephobia" than his discussion of dif- ference reveals a fear of English superiority, marked by the grandeur of the role of the Romantic poet, being attacked by the convergence of many cultures. I would suggest that it is never easy to classify Wordsworth. Instead, a more productive model for understanding Wordsworth's perspec- tive in the city is Walter Benjamin' s flâneur. As Wordsworth occupies a similar, privileged bourgeois perspective as the flâneur, becoming the flâneur allows Wordsworth to look "around as in a diorama" (35), and, more successfully than Baudelaire in the Paris Arcades, respond to the conditions within the scaled down model. Just as the Arcades create the aimless, wandering flâneur, London, especially the Fair, makes Wordsworth into its observer. The flâneur may be- come an object or commodity of the model that it examines, but Wordsworth's emphasis on understanding the imagination within a commodity culture proves that critique can occur from a corrupted position. And while the flâneur may never understand that his idleness provides an understanding and critique of the economic control of capitalism, Wordsworth does realize that the individual and the imagination are under attack by this economic control. In Wordsworth 's Historical Imagination, David Simpson offers a material reading of Wordsworth's texts in order to present a theory of displacement, a mode to understand the political and social climate that Wordsworth lived within and responded to in his writing. Explaining Wordsworth's "model envi- ronment," Simpson establishes what Wordsworth saw as essential when he managed to look as Benjamin suggests at a scaled down model of commodity culture: This environment had to be rural (indeed marginal), sparsely populated by both natural objects and other people, and governed by a subsistent rather than a surplus economy. A world in which there are few "objec- tive" elements for attention and distraction provides the necessary space and time for the "second look" that provides the opportunity for the correction of improper figuration, and the modification of authentic ones. (60) As Simpson argues, the city never becomes the "model environment," nor does it exhibit any characteristic of the environment. What Simpson does not realize is that the city is important because Wordsworth's experiences there permit him to see the material necessity for such an environment. Simply put, without the contrast of the city, Wordsworth could have neither identified what made the model environment so much more appealing nor could he have searched for it in the country. _</page><page sequence="6">Criticizing the urban environment in the 1802 Preface to Lyrical Ballads, Wordsworth talks about the effects of urbanization, especially in terms of the labor issues troubling cities: For a multitude of causes, unknown to former times, are now acting with a combined force to blunt the discriminating powers of the mind, and unfitting it for all voluntary exertion to reduce it to a state of almost savage torpor. The most effective of these causes are the great national events which are daily taking place, and the increasing accumulation of men in cities, where the uniformity of their occupations produces a craving for extraordinary incident. (599) The national event that Wordsworth names, the growth of the metropolis, re- veals the need to address labor issues and conditions. Although Wordsworth belittles the literature and theater of the day for pandering to the spectacle-loving "men in cities," he does focus his poetic treatise on saving the imagination from the corruption of capitalism. Simpson explains Wordsworth's critique of labor development, in spite of his elitist attitude towards the role of literature. Simp- son argues, "the continual performance of the same limited task by the same worker renders him passive and alienated. His craving for relief then becomes all the greater, but because work discipline has made creative leisure impossible, this can only take the form of superficial and passive consumption of whatever distractions are most readily available" (62). The repetition of catalogues as the descriptive mode in Book Seven reveals Wordsworth using his labor, that of a poet, in order to identify with the social hardships of the majority of the city's inhabitants. Part of the city spectacle de- scribed by Wordsworth includes "the string of dazzling Wares, / Shop after shop" (7.173-74) and "Advertisements of giant-size" (7.210). He lumps con- sumerism with a circus, complete with peep shows and wild animals, in order to show how trivial and commodified self-identity has become for the urban la- borer encountering any moment of leisure. In this way, Wordsworth supports one of his main argument in the Preface - the poet should be a "man speaking to men" (603). Admittedly, the catalogues are typically read as Wordsworth's in- ability to sympathize with the laborers, but this reading is based on the superior- ity of the individual subjectivity of the poet instead of the collective ideals of the poet. Through his critique of subjectivity in the spectacle laden city, while put- ting himself within the environment he critiques, Wordsworth achieves what he calls, "the wish of the Poet to bring his feelings near to those of the persons whose feelings he describes, nay, for short spaces confound and identify his own feelings with theirs" (604). When we relate Wordsworth's poetic theorizing about collective identity then relate it to Book Seven, Simpson's theory of dis- placement seems better thought of as Wordsworth's discomfort with place. This 79</page><page sequence="7">rethought term permits us to see a distance between the spatial and the social in Wordsworth's writing, and thus we can identify his developing concerns about community organization. A main benefit of rethinking displacement as discomfort with place is that the second concept removes the negativity of complete alienation foundational to Simpson's concept of displacement. Several critics of Book Seven have made similar gestures to disavow the binary between the response to the country (the positive) and the urban (the negative).3 Simpson even argues in this mode: London, though much more of a shock to the senses, was less so to Wordsworth himself by virtue of his early Cantabrigian training in the ways of the world. He was able to survive the deconstruction of the au- thentic self that was threatened by the metropolis. . . But to those who do not have the poet's special experiences ornature and of Cambridge, London is a fiercely negative environment. (122) The reality of oppressive labor conditions confronting the majority of Londoners makes it difficult for most to think of the city as anything but "a fiercely nega- tive environment;" laborers do not have the privilege of education and leisure like Wordsworth, but his concern for labor conditions and his desire to be a "man speaking to men" support reading Wordsworth's critique of London as an attempt to save the imagination from corruption. Simpson addresses the salva- tion through the idea of the "authentic self," but I wish to explore how Words- worth finds subjective empowerment in the city by comparing his famous sonnet "Composed Upon Westminster Bridge" to The Prelude. This comparison proves Wordsworth's commitment to fully conceptualiz- ing the city in his writing, despite his discomfort towards the environment. The absolute serenity depicted by Wordsworth's early morning vision of the city from the bridge is often times labeled as a contrast to the chaotic theatricality typically associated with London in The Prelude. The stereotypical argument requires accepting the description of London in "Westminster Bridge" as a natu- ralization of the urban. While looking at how Wordsworth molds the image of London in the sonnet is essential, it is not a naturalization, but instead a gro- tesque reforming of the theatrical London. Wordsworth has managed such an accomplishment because he retains his subjectivity by internalizing the carniva- lesque reality of the city. In Rabelais and His World, Mikhail Bakhtin explains the grotesque tradition that Wordsworth draws on for his city descriptions. If we think, as Bakhtin suggests, of the grotesque as deformity in need of reforming, and acknowledge that the grotesque is most frequently represented through im- agery of the human body (19-20) then the London of "Westminster Bridge" does not conflict with Wordsworth's later attitude toward the city in his epic work. To better see the relationship between these two poems we must establish a chronology in Wordsworth's life and texts, but he has made this quite difficult ~80</page><page sequence="8">for us. The Prelude 's development follows the chronology of a personal epic, but as an autobiography it cannot escape the conflation of memories and experi- ences outside of linear temporality. "Westminster Bridge" offers a specific mo- ment, September 2, 1802 (even though Dorothy Wordsworth's journal gives a date a few months earlier), locating it after the official "Residence in London" in 1791. But we have already seen how Book Seven mixes Wordsworth's many visits into one. Instead of thinking of a chronological development of Words- worth's attitude towards London, we must look at his epistemological develop- ment. His initial reaction to the grotesque theatricality of London found him as one of the "captivated Flock" (7.566) since his "mind / Turned this way, that way!" (470-01); but because of his previous experiences in Cambridge, Words- worth manages to escape from the objectifícation of the self created by observ- ing spectacle and finds a way to control the spectacle - "Westminster Bridge" is the epitome of controlled spectacle. As the controller, or in the language of theatricality the director, Words- worth must work with his spectacular character, namely an already theatrical city. In the terms of the Bakhtinian grotesque, Wordsworth dresses up the an- thropomorphized city: "The City now doth like a garment wear / The beauty of the morning" (4-5). The amorphous nature of the image becomes most obvious by comparing the sonnet to Dorothy's journal article based on the same scene. She records: we mounted the Dover Coach at Charing Cross. It was a beautiful morning. The City, St Pauls, with the River &amp; a multitude of little Boats, made a most beautiful sight as we crossed Westminster Bridge. The houses were not overhung by their cloud of smoke &amp; they were spread out endlessly, yet the sun shone so brightly with such a pure light that there was even something like the purity of ones of nature's own grand Spectacles [sic]. (123) It seems that Dorothy had some effect on Wordsworth's sonnet as both writers focus on the absence of industrial markers despite their ever-expanding urban environment, but Dorothy's description also lacks all markers of the theatrical - the grotesque, the personified, and the chaotic. Even when she exhibits a similar style to Wordsworth through her catalogue, "The City, St pauis, with the River &amp; a multitude of little Boats," the emphasis on description separates her from Wordsworth's object driven lists. Notice that the preposition in Dorothy's list creates a relational image of the river and its surroundings, including the overtly described boats. This comparison suggests that Wordsworth makes a conscious choice of the costume that he gives to the living city. The costume is not exactly the natural but instead is constructed through negatives, meaning constructed out of everything that the city is not. 81</page><page sequence="9">J. Hillis Miller provides a deconstructive reading of the poem in "The Still Heart: Poetic Form in Wordsworth." He argues that the negatives in lines one, nine, and twice in line eleven are fundamental to this poem because they invite the reader to *4hink of all those other contexts, scattered through Wordsworth's poetry and usually involving pastoral rather than urban landscapes, in which the poet responds to what he sees with a combination of deep excitement and calm, calm hovering on the edge of ecstasy" (305). Identifying "Westminster Bridge" as an urban landscape embraces negation as foundational to the poem. Reading the poem as an urban landscape shows that Wordsworth has not conservatively resorted to naturalization in order to find "a calm so deep" ("WB" 11), but in- stead he has found a perspective within the city that permits him to maintain an imaginative identity born outside the city. In this poem, imagination, particularly through the anthropomorphic, triumphs. Following the explicit dressing of the city, Wordsworth includes perhaps his most famous catalogue of objects, "silent, bare, / Ships, towers, domes, theatres and temples lie / Open unto the fields, and to the sky" ("WB" 6-8). This catalogue accomplishes an absolute objectification of the most social components of the city - most obviously commerce, history, art, and religion. The objectification prepares the audience for the sonnet's con- cluding argument, that only imaginative freedom allows an inhabitant to main- tain subjectivity in the city. In terms of Miller's argument, "The poem might be defined as the epitaph for a dead city" (308), imagination can only survive at the expense of the city's conceptual demise. The sacrificial death of the city at the poem's end reveals Wordsworth sav- ing imaginative subjectivity at the cost of social critique. Because of his overall discomfort with place, Wordsworth does not manage to create a collective envi- ronment that could nurture imagination. He has attempted creation but could only achieve escape from the chaos of city life for the individual, himself. His failed experience of imaginatively conquering the city forces Wordsworth to kill it off and reform his image elsewhere in his writing (the consistency of the re- writing of London only reconfirms the grotesque). The poem's last three lines reveal much about his poetic perspective and desire to find terms that permit him to feel at least somewhat at ease in the city. The poem ends: The river glideth at his own sweet will: Dear God! The very houses seem asleep; And all that mighty heart is lying still! (12-14) The position that Wordsworth establishes in the poem's title, upon a bridge, primarily provides him with a circumspect position somewhat above the city (or at least outside of the "thickening hubbub" (7.227)) but still inside the city. He has the ability to create a spatially vast image of the city, including the suburbs "open unto the fields, and to the sky." ~82</page><page sequence="10">This perspective also positions him upon the most striking natural feature of London, the Thames. In a poem that takes a bridge and the river it crosses as essential to its point of view, the river does not make an explicit appearance un- til line twelve. The personification of the river, "glideth at his own sweet will," within the already personified city, reveals an empowerment given to mobility, particularly unhindered, free-flow. Identifying this ability as an afterthought to the overall image of personified life suggests that Wordsworth is not sure how to handle the mighty potential of the river. Instead, he turns the anthropomorphized city into a corpse, halting its heart right after he proved that the veins, the river, must continue to flow. Just as Wordsworth emphasizes the river in "Westminster Bridge," the be- ginning of Book Seven is laden with language connotative of water. "Poured" (7.1), "deep" (7.5), "water-spout" (7.9), "interrupted stream" (7.10), and "flowed" (7.11) all shape the introduction of this book as a free-flow into the city. This introduction connects to an attempt to rewrite, or better yet parody, the sonnet a hundred lines later in Book Seven: Vauxhall and Ranelagh, I then had heard Of your green groves, and wilderness of lamps, Your gorgeous Ladies, fairy cataracts, And pageant fireworks; nor must we forget Those other wonders different in kind, Though scarcely less illustrious in degree, The River proudly bridges, the giddy Top And whispering Gallery of St. Paul's, the Tombs Of Westminster, the Giants of Guildhall, Bedlam, and the two figures at its Gates, Streets without end, and Churches numberless, Statues, with flowery gardens in vast Squares, The Monument, and Armoury of the Tower. (7.123-35) This section of lines, nearly a sonnet in form, follows a metapoetic commentary on the "power of words" (7.121); this statement links power to the "meaning which they [words] bring" (7.122). Wordsworth explicitly acknowledges the manipulative power of poetic language when he shows that it can misconstrue an image or reality in order to bring a "sweet" meaning. This somewhat lengthy description of the city is such an occasion. Mimicking "Westminster Bridge," Wordsworth valorizes the potential perspective of the city given to the viewer from a bridge. The bridge serves to once again connect the poet to the city's natural lifeblood - the moving river - while also connecting him to its commer- cial, historical, political, and religious immensities. 83</page><page sequence="11">As parody must, this section points out the fallacy of the circumspect per- spective from a bridge. The inclusion of "Streets without end" within the list of the city's landmarks gives power to endlessness. But in this book, the chaotic street life, which never does end, becomes the reality facing Wordsworth. Wordsworth realizes this disappointment when he eventually "looked upon the real scene" (7.139). This endless situation creates a lack of connections between people, overall a lack of community - immensely frightening to Wordsworth. In the stanza preceding this repeated imagined city, Wordsworth laments, Above all, one thought Baffled my understanding, how men lived Even next-door neighbours, as we say, yet still Strangers, and knowing not each other's names. (7.1 17-20) This sentiment of social isolation and uncultivated community reappears both implicitly and explicitly throughout The Prelude. Famously explaining Wordsworth's reaction to the conditions of living in the city, Raymond Williams asserts, whereas "Blake saw a common condition of 'weakness and woe.' Wordsworth saw strangeness, a loss of connection, not at first in social but in perpetual ways: a failure of identity in the crowd of others which worked back to a loss of identity in the self, and then, in these ways, a loss of society itself (150). As indicated by the title of Williams's work, The Country and The City, his argument, like Simpson's identifies a clear relation- ship between Wordsworth's attitudes towards both locations. The labor issues of the city that so clearly concerned Wordsworth extend beyond a typical material- ist critique. He saw labor practices as indicative of the social organization of the city. A lack of community stood to challenge selfhood, which ultimately made workers accept themselves as commodities. Their identity as commodities for- bids them from becoming part of a society of workers, a collectivity absolutely essential to Marx's plight against the oppression of workers. Still, Wordsworth does not give up hope for social reorganization. The medium that Wordsworth turns to in order to save subjectivity for all workers, poets or laborers, and create community out of the places that cause him discomfort is the imagination. Geoffrey Hartman provides the most thorough critical examination of Wordsworth's understanding of imagination and the powers that it has on his life. Explaining the social impetus of Wordsworth's attitude towards imagina- tion in The Prelude, Hartman argues that "Books VI through IX interpret the fact that the imagination, though naturalized, exceeds nature, as a providential widening of imaginative interests that are to wean the poet from nature and turn him toward social life. Only at the depth of his crisis does Wordsworth ade- quately recognize the imagination as a power satisfied by neither nature nor man" (234). Hartman's argument responds to Wordsworth's use of the natural to breed imagination; at first the natural and the imaginative are synonymous for "84</page><page sequence="12">Wordsworth, particularly because the cultivation of both immensely appeals to Wordsworth. But the city forces him to problematize this relationship because he is directly confronted by "the spontaneous overflow of powerful feelings" (61 1) in the city's spaces of community, but these feelings differ because in the city he struggles to internalize the ideas as he has in nature. In this light, "West- minster Bridge" may be one of Wordsworth's most imaginative poems because it completely removes nature and man, which Hartman suggests do not satisfy the imagination. In London, Wordsworth seeks alternative methods to create an imaginative subjectivity. Theatricality is the most direct method of this alterna- tive; but as Mary Jacobus identifies, what emerges is "the theatrical underworld of The Prelude, that mingled threat to and seduction of the imagination" (111). No place Wordsworth takes us in London more directly confronts the imagina- tion and forces it to make a statement than at Bartholomew Fair (7.649-95). In seventeenth-century London, fairs were quite popular, but the most popu- lar was Bartholomew's Fair at Smithfield. Peter Ackroyd details the popularity and history of the fair in his biography of London (148-49). He reveals that it continued throughout the century despite political climates that did not harbor appreciation for such festivities, including during the Puritan Commonwealth. Early in the eighteenth century, officials shortened the festivities from several weeks to a few days in order to calm the riotous crowds. The shortened, con- trolled fair is the type Wordsworth attended, but it certainly does not seem less riotous. Wordsworth is so dumbfounded by the condition that he evokes a Muse as protection: For once the Muse's help will we implore, And she shall lodge us, wafted on her wings, Above the press and danger of the Crowd, Upon some Showman's platform: what a hell For eyes and ears! what anarchy and din Barbarian and infernal! 'tis a dream, Monstrous in colour, motion, shape, sight, sound. (7.656-62) Calling for a Muse allows Wordsworth to use poetic tradition as his shield from confronting the "anarchy and din" directly. He isolates himself, the poet, and his imagination because he fears the anarchy overtaking. The isolation at the fair contradicts his desire for the poet to be a "man speaking to men" in the very spaces that make such a goal very possible. Despite the moment of failure, he does not retreat into total isolation, but in- stead he attempts to shape London into a place where all can speak. In Book Seven, there is a global-utopia created by the catalogue of inhabitants shopping and bartering in the streets, and this scene is a reworking of that global camara- derie because the Fair represents Utopian equality. As Ackroyd reveals, "Within 85</page><page sequence="13">Bartholomew Fair itself there was a complete erasure of ordinary social distinc- tions. One of the complaints against it lay in the fact that apprentice and lord might be enjoying the same entertainments, or betting at the same gaming ta- bles" (149). The theatrical performance of equality in the city continually draws Wordsworth to these scenes of heterogeneous crowds, scenes that respond to Wordsworth's worry over the leisure of the urban laborer, but his immersion in them only proves that the chaos has sacrificed community for heterogeneity. The absolute corruption of community is a dystopian reality for Wordsworth. Wordsworth critically relays this reaction to Coleridge, saying "the face of every one / That passes by me is a mystery" (7.597-98). Unlike his encounters with beggars and travelers along the country roads, the complete chaos of the city does not give Wordsworth enough time to learn or even imagine the narratives of his neighbors. Hartman explains the effect of the Fair on the imagination: "Their existence shows the imaginative impulse asserting itself blindly, yet be- ing reduced to superstition and torpor by too quick or crude a satisfaction. The imagination, in Wordsworth's view, is marked by activity not only in presence but also in the absence of immediate external stimuli, and even creates that ab- sence when necessary" (239). Evoking the Muse is Wordsworth's attempt at an absence, or at least an absenting of himself from his commitments to a revolu- tionary poetic and social praxis. He tries to identify the spaces of community that he finds necessary, thinking that the theatrical environment surely should provide him with this opportunity. Unfortunately, the chaotic, or "This Parlia- ment of Monsters" (7.692), refuses him the personal and emotional connection to a community. The only places that Wordsworth manages to find pure connections to oth- ers occur on an individual level: sharing a moment with the blind beggar; help- ing the discharged soldier; hearing the story of Margaret from the peddler. Simpson explains the result of this connection: "But in representing himself as speaking for or about the wanderers of the earth, Wordsworth was himself, as we have seen and will see again, at a distance from them, in a no man's land between the bourgeois commitment to place and property and the vagrant ease imaged in the gypsies' tents" (126). Wordsworth's bourgeois privilege creates a "no man's land" that isolates him from the Utopian collectivity harbored by the imagination. He searches for a place that could harbor his interest in an imagina- tive subjectivity that sprouts from the spaces of community, the spaces that nur- ture these emotions, but he cannot undo or refuse the bourgeois experiences that ensnare the imagination within a prescribed realm of acceptance. Although he could not create a static, accessible space of community in his poetry, Words- worth's constant quest is a testament to his radical poetic. He attempts to under- stand how the imagination is affected by the rise of the capitalist metropolis, and _</page><page sequence="14">through his search, he reveals how labor, for the factory worker and the poet alike, cannot ignore the power of the imagination.

Stoddard reveals that "a close reading shows the controlling tone of the London book to be an irreconcilable mixture of gaiety and repugnance, the typical response to the grotesque, that than univocal criticism" (40); Francois Hugo more simply explains that in London, "Wordsworth experiences shock and dismay, rather than contempt" (6).
